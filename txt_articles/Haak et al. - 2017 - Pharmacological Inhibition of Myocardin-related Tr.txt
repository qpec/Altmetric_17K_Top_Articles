Abstract
Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer with
the majority of deaths arising from metastatic disease. Evi-
dence implicates Rho-activated gene transcription in melano-
ma metastasis mediated by the nuclear localization of the
transcriptional coactivator, myocardin-related transcription
factor (MRTF). Here, we highlight a role for Rho and MRTF
signaling and its reversal by pharmacologic inhibition using in
vitro and in vivo models of human melanoma growth and
metastasis. Using two cellular models of melanoma, we clearly
show that one cell type, SK-Mel-147, is highly metastatic, has
high RhoC expression, and MRTF nuclear localization and
activity. Conversely, SK-Mel-19 melanoma cells have low
RhoC expression, and decreased levels of MRTF-regulated
genes. To probe the dependence of melanoma aggressiveness
to MRTF transcription, we use a previously developed small-
molecule inhibitor, CCG-203971, which at low micromolar
concentrations blocks nuclear localization and activity of
MRTF-A. In SK-Mel-147 cells, CCG-203971 inhibits cellular
migration and invasion, and decreases MRTF target gene
expression. In addition, CCG-203971–mediated inhibition of
the Rho/MRTF pathway significantly reduces cell growth and
clonogenicity and causes G1 cell-cycle arrest. In an experimen-
tal model of melanoma lung metastasis, the RhoC-overexpres-
sing melanoma cells (SK-Mel-147) exhibited pronounced lung
colonization compared with the low RhoC–expressing SK-Mel-
19. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of the MRTF path-
way reduced both the number and size of lung metastasis
resulting in a marked reduction of total lung tumor burden.
These data link Rho and MRTF-mediated signaling with aggres-
sive phenotypes and support targeting the MRTF transcription-
al pathway as a novel approach to melanoma therapeutics.

Introduction
Rho GTPases play significant roles in human cancer (1).
Although RhoA and RhoC share considerable homology, they
may coordinate different aspects of cancer progression. RhoC
appears to be most important for cellular invasion and
metastasis (2) while RhoA plays a role in transformation and
tumor proliferation (3). In a screen designed to identify
genes important for melanoma metastasis, RhoC was found
to be upregulated and it contributed to melanoma lung
metastasis (4). Rho GTPases are well-known for regulating
the actin cytoskeleton (5). RhoA/C activation causes the
formation of myosin-rich F-actin bundles called stress fibers
through their downstream effectors Rho-associated kinase
(ROCK) and Diaphanous-related formin-1 (mDia1; refs. 6,
7). By modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases also
regulate gene expression though myocardin-related transcrip-
tion cofactors (MRTF-A/B) also known as megakaryoblastic
leukemia proteins (MKL1/2). In the nucleus, MRTF cooperates
with serum response factor (SRF) to induce transcription of
genes involved in proliferation, migration, invasion, and
metastasis (8, 9). In the N-terminal region of MRTF are two
G-actin–binding RPEL motifs which sequester MRTF in the
cytoplasm. Rho activity reduces cytosolic G-actin, allowing
MRTF to translocate into the nucleus and activate gene tran-
scription. Stable knockdown of MRTF or SRF in B16M2
melanoma or human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with
high RhoC expression results in a dramatic reduction of in vivo
lung metastasis and in vitro cellular migration (10). This
evidence suggests that gene regulation through MRTF med-
iates RhoC-induced cancer metastasis.
To assess the potential for targeting MRTF-regulated gene
transcription in cancer metastasis, we used a previously iden-
tified small-molecule inhibitor of the MRTF pathway (11). Our
initial compound, CCG-1423, selectively blocked Rho GTPase–
regulated prostate cancer cell invasion at low micromolar
concentrations (11). Further structure–activity relationship

 and to enhance potency resulted in a new analogue (13), CCG-
203971, that also blocks MRTF-induced gene expression and
prostate cancer migration. The Rho/MRTF pathway has also
recently been highlighted as a major signaling crossroad in the
development of pathologic fibrosis in diseases including
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma, and Crohn disease
(14, 15). We have recently shown efficacy of CCG-203971 in a
murine model of skin fibrosis (16) but a close examination of
MRTF pathway inhibitors in models of cancer progression has
not been performed.
Here we investigate the Rho/MRTF pathway in two metastatic
melanoma cell lines, SK-Mel-19 and SK-Mel-147. There is a
clear dichotomy between the two lines where the high level of
RhoC, constitutive MRTF-A nuclear localization, and function
in SK-Mel-147 is associated with in vivo and in vitro correlates of
cancer metastasis including clonogenicity, migration, and inva-
sion. As a novel approach to antimetastasis therapeutics, our
MRTF pathway inhibitor, CCG-203971, blocks cellular migra-
tion and invasion and profoundly suppresses SK-Mel-147 lung
metastasis in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and proliferation
Human cutaneous melanoma cell lines, SK-Mel-19 and SK-
Mel-147, obtained from Dr. Maria Soengas at the University of
Michigan, were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supple-
mented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies) including penicillin/
streptomycin (Life Technologies). Short tandem repeat profiles
were conducted on the melanoma cell lines (Genewiz). The
profiles obtained for the melanoma cell lines do not match any
established published profiles, and we are unable to identify
published profiles for SK-Mel-19 and SK-Mel-147. Cells were
expanded and frozen immediately prior to authentication and
then resuscitated only two to three months before experiments.
We verified the driver mutations in our laboratory using MSU
Sanger sequencing service expected from previous reports (i.e.,
BRAFV600E for SK-Mel-19 and NRASQ61L for SK-Mel-147;
refs. 17, 18). For proliferation experiments, 1 � 104 cells were
plated into 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells
were allowed to attach overnight and then medium was
replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. After 72 hours of
growth, cells were stained with 0.4% Trypan blue stain (Invi-
trogen). Cell counting was performed using the Countess
Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions.
Immunocytochemistry and F-actin staining
Cells (1 � 105) were plated onto fibronectin-coated cover-
slips in DMEM with 10% FBS and allowed to attach overnight.
Medium was changed to DMEM with 0.5% FBS for 24 hours
plus the indicated concentration of CCG-203971 or 0.1%
DMSO. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10
minutes at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.25%
Triton X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature. For immu-
nocytochemistry studies, primary antibody for MRTF-A (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, cat# SC-21558) was diluted 1:100 and
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Fluorophore-con-
jugated secondary (Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey Anti-Goat IgG,
Invitrogen) was diluted 1:1,000 and added for 1 hour. For stress
fiber assays, a final concentration of 100 nmol/L Acti-Stain
phalloidin (Cytoskeleton) in 100 mL 1� PBS/1% BSA was
added to each coverslip for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Cells were mounted (Prolong Gold antifade-reagent with DAPI,
Invitrogen) and imaged on an upright fluorescence microscope
(Nikon E-800) at 60� magnification.
Real-time PCR
Cells (1 � 106) were plated into 60-mm dishes and starved
overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were lysed and
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer's instructions. DNAse-treated RNA (1 mg) was used
as a template for synthesizing cDNA utilizing the TaqMan
Reverse-Transcription Reagents Kit (Invitrogen). SYBR green
qPCR
(SABiosciences)
was
performed
using
a
Stratagene
Mx3000P (Agilent Technologies) and Ct values were analyzed
relative to GAPDH expression. Primer sequences used were as
follows: GAPDH: 50-GGAAGGGCTCATGACCACAG-30, 30 ACA-
GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTG-50; CTGF: 50-CAGAGTGGAGCGCC-
TGTT-30, 30-CTGCAGGAGGCGTTGTCA-50; CYR61: 50-CGCGC-
TGCTGTAAGGTCT-30, 30–TTTTGCTGCAGTCCTCGTTG-50; MYL9:
50-CATCCATGAGGACCACCTCCG-30,30–CTGGGGTGGCCTAGT-
CGTC-50.
Scratch migration assay
Cells (4 � 105) were plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS in
a 12-well plate. After 24 hours, a scratch was made using a 200-
mL pipette tip. Medium was replaced with DMEM containing
2.0% FBS and images of the wound were taken at time ¼ 0 and
24 hours using a bright field microscope (Olympus CKX41).
Area quantification of the scratch was determined using ImageJ
software as described previously (13, 19). Briefly, the binary
(white and black) threshold for each image was manually
adjusted to leave only the open area of the scratch black. The
area of this scratch was determined and the percent closure was
calculated by comparing the difference in area from t ¼ 0 hour
to t ¼ 24 hours.
Transwell migration assay
Cells (5 � 104) were added to the top of an 8-mm pore
diameter Transwell chamber (Millipore) in DMEM containing
0.5% FBS with 10 mmol/L CCG-203971 or 0.1% DMSO con-
trol. Medium containing 0.5% FBS and compound or DMSO
was also added to the bottom chamber. Cells were allowed to
migrate for 6 hours, and after wiping the remaining cells off the
top of the Transwell chamber, cells which migrated were fixed
and stained in 4% formaldehyde/0.5% crystal violet. The num-
ber of migrated cells for each well was determined by exam-
ining four random nonoverlapping fields of view at 20�
magnification using a bright field microscope (Olympus
CKX41). For knockdown experiments, cells transfected for 48
hours with siRNA pools were plated, allowed to migrate, and
analyzed as stated above.
siRNA knockdown
ON-TARGET plus SMART pools (GE Dharmacon) targeting
human MRTF-A (GE cat# L-015434-00) or nontargeting pool
control (GE cat# D-001810-10-05) were used according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 25 nmol/L siRNA
smart pools were transfected using DharmaFECT (GE cat# T-
2001-01). Western blot validation of MRTF-A expression was

 conducted using a fraction of the same transfected population
used for the Transwell assays.
Label-free migration and invasion assay
Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) of cell invasion was monitored
using a CIM-plate 16 and xCELLigence DP System (Acea Biosci-
ence, Inc). Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences) 5% (v/v) was diluted
1:20 in basal RPMI media and was added in the top chamber
and allowed to equilibrate for 4 hours in an incubator at 37�C in
5% CO2. Cells (3 � 105/well) were added at t ¼ 5 hours. For
compound effects in invasion assays, cells were treated with 10
mmol/L CCG-203971 upon placement into the top chamber. Cell
index was measured every 30 minutes.
Luciferase assay
Cells (3 � 104) were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM
containing 10% FBS overnight. Cells were then cotransfected with
56 ng SRE.L- Luciferase reporter selective for Rho/MRTF described
in ref. 20, and 2.3 ng RhoC plasmid diluted with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). After 6
hours, compounds were added for overnight treatment. The next
day, WST-1 (10 mL/well) reagent (Promega) was added to mea-
sure viability. After 1 hour, absorbance was read (450 nm) before
lysing the cells for luciferase measurement (Promega Luciferase
Assay System).
Clonogenic assay
Cells were grown for 6 days in DMEM with 2.0% FBS. Two
hundred live cells, determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay,
were seeded into a 6-well plate and allowed to form colonies in
DMEM containing 2.0% FBS for 10 days. Colonies were fixed
and stained in 3.7% formaldehyde/0.5% crystal violet for 10
minutes at room temperature. Only cell clusters consisting of at
least 50 cells were counted as colonies. For CCG-203971
treatment, cells (2 � 105) were seeded into 6-well dishes and
allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, the medium
was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and 0.1%
DMSO or 10 mmol/L CCG-203971 was added. Seventy-two
hours later, 200 or 1 � 103 cells were plated per group in
DMEM with 10% FBS in 6-well dishes and allowed to form
colonies for 7 days. Colonies were fixed and stained as stated
above. Colony counts and mean area quantification were
determined using ImageJ software. Briefly, the image threshold
was adjusted to black and white and further processed to
smooth colony pixilation. The images were then analyzed for
colony size (pixel2) fixed at 50–infinity and for circularity
defined at 0.2–1.0.
Flow cytometry
Cells (5 � 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes in DMEM with
10% FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. Media were replaced
with DMEM with 0.5% FBS, and 0.1% DMSO or 10 mmol/L CCG-
203971 was added. Cells were allowed to grow for 72 hours
and were then collected using 1� versene (Gibco), permeabilized,
and fixed using 70% ethanol for 30 minutes on ice. Cells
were centrifuged (200 � g, 5 minutes), and resuspended in DNA
extraction buffer (192 mL 0.2 mol/L Na2HPO4, 8 mL 0.1 mol/L
citric acid, pH 7.8, filter sterilized) for 5 minutes. Cells were
centrifuged (300 � g, 5 minutes) to remove DNA extraction buffer
and resuspended in 250 mL of freshly prepared DNA staining
solution (2 mg/mL propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/mL RNase A in 1�
PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the
dark. Fluorescence was detected using a C6 BD Accuri flow
cytometer (BD Accuri). Fluorescence was quantified using CFlow
software (BD Accuri). Cell-cycle analysis was conducted using
FlowJo v10.0.8 software (Tree Star, Inc.). A total of 1 � 104 events
were detected in experimental triplicate for untreated cells, 0.1%
DMSO, and 10 mmol/L CCG-203971. Three independent experi-
ments were conducted.
Western blot analysis
Cells were starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS.
Cells were lysed [10 mmol/L Tris-Cl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 140 mmol/L NaCl, protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche cat# 11873580001)], sonicated two times for
15 seconds, and centrifuged to quantitate soluble proteins
using a BCA protein assay as recommended by the manufac-
turer (Pierce BCA Protein Assay, Thermo Scientific). Protein
lysate (20 mg) were resolved using 15% SDS-PAGE gels, trans-
ferred to PVDF membranes, and blocked in 5% dried milk
in Tween Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated
in 1:1,000 diluted primary antibodies RhoC (Cell Signaling
Technology, cat# 3430), RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat#
SC-418), MRTF-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat# SC-21558),
or GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, cat# 14C10) overnight
at 4�C. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology, sc-2060), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Sigma-
Aldrich, A0545), or HRP-conjugated bovine anti-goat (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, cat# SC-2352) antibodies were diluted
1:10,000. Blots were developed using SuperSignal Pico chemi-
luminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Bands were visual-
ized and quantified using a LI-COR Odyssey Fc or visualized
using Kodak X-OMAT Film Developer and quantified using
ImageJ software.
Mouse metastasis model
Ten-week old, female, NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD SCID)
mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (stock number:
001303). The mice were separated into three groups of 6. One
group received tail vein injection of GFP-expressing SK-Mel-19
(2 � 106 cells). The other two groups were injected with GFP-
expressing SK-Mel-147 (2 � 106 cells). Following tail vein
injection, the SK-Mel-147 mice began twice daily intraperito-
neal injection of 100 mg/kg CCG-203971 or 50-mL DMSO
(vehicle control). After 18 days, the mice were euthanized and
lungs were collected for histologic analysis. All studies were
performed according to protocols approved by the University
of Michigan, University Committee on the Use and Care of
Animals (UCUCA).
IHC
For the quantification and imaging of lung tissue from the
mouse metastasis model, paraffin-embedded sections were
dewaxed, unmasked, and treated as described previously (21).
To visualize GFP-expressing melanoma cells in the lung section,
the Vector Rabbit-on-Mouse basic kit (Vector Laboratories) was
utilized according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each
experiment, two tissue sections from the same animal were
developed: one with primary antibody [rabbit anti-GFP (1:250
Invitrogen A-6455)] included and one with the primary antibody
left out of the reaction. Visualization of GFP was done using the
Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), used according to

 the manufacturer's instructions. All sections were developed using
3,30-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Images were taken at 20� magnification using
a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope with MMI Cell Tools software,
Version 3.47. (MMI). Treatment and control slides were imaged
using the same exposure time and LUT settings. The slides were
blindly quantified for the number of metastatic nodules on each
section followed by the use of ImageJ software to determine the
cross-sectional area (mm2) of each nodule. The area was repre-
sented as an average size for each mouse and the total tumor
burden was calculated by adding the total cross-sectional areas for
all tumors in each mouse then averaged for each group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA comparison
followed by Bonferonni posttest for multiple comparisons where
�P > 0.05, ��P > 0.01, ���P > 0.001, and ����P > 0.0001. Com-
parison of survival curves was performed by log-rank method
where �P > 0.05 and ��P > 0.01.
Results
SK-Mel-147 exhibits aggressive in vitro phenotypes and
overexpresses RhoC
Previously published results showed that SK-Mel-147 cells
were highly metastatic in immunocompromised mice while
SK-Mel-19 cells were not (22), so to confirm these observa-
tions, we compared phenotypes of SK-Mel-147 and SK-Mel-19
using in vitro models of cancer aggressiveness. SK-Mel-147
readily forms colonies while SK-Mel-19 is unable to form
quantifiable colonies under these conditions (Fig. 1A). We
next examined cellular migration and invasion using the
scratch-wound migration assay (Fig. 1B) as well as Matrigel
invasion assay (Fig. 1C), respectively. Consistent with previous
results, SK-Mel-147 cells were much more migratory and
invasive than SK-Mel-19. Rho GTPase signaling has been
shown to promote cellular migration and invasion (23). More
specifically in melanoma, RhoC expression was elevated in cell
lines selected in mice for increased metastatic behavior (5). To
determine the relative Rho signaling potential within SK-Mel-
147 and SK-Mel-19, we quantified RhoA and RhoC protein
expression (Fig. 1D and E). RhoC protein is overexpressed in
the more aggressive melanoma cell line, SK-Mel-147, while
RhoA levels are not significantly different between the cell lines
(Fig. 1E). RhoA plays an important role in proliferation and
cytokinesis, whereas RhoC seems to be more involved in
migration, invasion, and metastasis (3, 4). In addition to
increased RhoC expression, SK-Mel-147 also shows modestly
increased MRTF-A expression levels compared with SK-Mel-19,
but it is not statistically significant (Fig. 1D and E). To under-
stand the potential contribution of RhoC and MRTF in clinical
melanoma, we explored survival data for cutaneous melanoma
datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ref. 24). Strat-
ification of high top quartile versus low bottom quartile MRTF-
A or RhoC expression levels shows a significant reduction of
percent survival in patients with high MRTF-A or RhoC expres-
sion (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, stratification of RhoA, RhoB, and
MRTF-B high versus low expression does not result in signif-
icant differences in melanoma patient percent survival (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1). Of note, the yes-associated protein (YAP)
and its paralog (TAZ), which have been reported to regulate
similar genes as does MRTF-A, such as CYR61, and CTGF (25),
did not show significant differences in patient survival based
on high versus low expression levels in cutaneous melanoma
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
SK-Mel-147 cells exhibit spontaneously nuclear and active
MRTF-A through F-actin stress fiber formation
To evaluate MRTF activity, we started by detecting stress
fiber formation in the two melanoma cell lines. Stress fiber
formation leads to G-actin depletion and MRTF translocation
into the nucleus (8). SK-Mel-147 cells exhibit strong F-actin
staining and stress fiber formation in the absence of serum
stimulation (Fig. 2A). SK-Mel-19 showed reduced F-actin stain-
ing and very little stress fiber formation. Consistent with the
actin-based mechanism governing MRTF localization and
activity, SK-Mel-147 also exhibited spontaneously nuclear
MRTF-A under these conditions (Fig. 2A). To show that
MRTF-A localization was dependent on F-actin dynamics, we
stimulated SK-Mel-19 cells with 20% FBS to induce stress fiber
formation which induced MRTF-A nuclear localization (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2). We also treated SK-Mel-147 cells with
latrunculin B which inhibits F-actin formation and MRTF-A
relocated to the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. S2). MRTF activity
is also regulated by the relative levels of G-actin (26). To assess
MRTF activity, we determined the mRNA expression of three
known Rho/MRTF target genes, myosin regulatory light chain 9
(MYL9), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), and
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Consistent with the
predominantly nuclear MRTF-A, SK-Mel-147 shows dramati-
cally increased expression of these three Rho/MRTF-regulated
genes compared with SK-Mel-19 (Fig. 2B). Along with being
MRTF target genes, MYL9, CYR61, and CTGF play important
roles in cellular migration and metastasis (10, 27). SK-Mel-147
cells clearly have increased MRTF activation as compared with
SK-Mel-19 cells, suggesting that this may contribute to the
metastatic potential of these cells.
MRTF pathway inhibitor CCG-203971 blocks MRTF-A nuclear
accumulation and transcription activity
We next assessed the potential for using a novel small-
molecule inhibitor of the Rho/MRTF pathway to block in vitro
and in vivo models of melanoma metastasis. To evaluate tran-
scriptional activity of MRTF, we performed luciferase assays
with a modified serum response element promoter (SRE.L) that
is selective for MRTF/SRF but does not respond to TCF/SRF
complexes (11, 28). CCG-203971 inhibits RhoC-induced SRE-
Luciferase expression in SK-Mel-147 cells with an IC50 of
approximately 6 mmol/L. CCG-203971 does not cause cellular
toxicity up to 100 mmol/L using the WST-1 viability assay in a
24-hour time period (Fig. 3A). In addition, CCG-203971
reduces the nuclear localization of MRTF-A in SK-Mel-147 cells
in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). By inhibiting
the Rho/MRTF pathway, treating SK-Mel-147 cells with CCG-
203971 also reduces the expression of endogenous MYL9,
CYR61, and CTGF (Fig. 3C).
CCG-203971 causes G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and inhibits
clonogenicity

 with the less aggressive cell line (SK-Mel-19), we determined
the effect of Rho/MRTF pathway inhibition on cellular prolif-
eration. While it had no effect on cell numbers at 24 hours,
CCG-203971 caused a significant reduction in the number of
SK-Mel-147 cells at 72 hours. CCG-203971 is more potent in
reducing cell numbers in our cell proliferation assay in the SK-
Mel-147 cell line compared with SK-Mel-19 (Fig. 4A). To
understand whether CCG-203971 affected cell proliferation

 or induced apoptosis, we conducted cell-cycle analysis using
flow cytometry in SK-Mel-147 cells following 10 mmol/L CCG-
203971 treatment for 72 hours. CCG-203971 caused G0–G1
arrest as evidenced by a significant increase in G0–G1 phase
and a decrease in S-phase compared with DMSO control
treatment (Fig. 4B and C). CCG-1423, the precursor com-
pound to CCG-203971, has been shown to downregulate
genes that are involved in cell cycle, specifically G1–S transi-
tion, including targets of the transcription factor E2F (GEO
Accession number: GSE30188; ref. 29). There was no signifi-
cant increase in sub-G1 in CCG-203971–treated SK-Mel-147
cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that CCG-203971 does not induce
apoptosis. Consistent with the effects of CCG-203971 to
induce G0–G1 cell-cycle arrest, it also inhibited the clonogeni-
city of the SK-Mel-147 cells. Following a 72-hour treatment
with DMSO or CCG-203971, equal numbers of viable cells
were plated for colony formation in the absence of our Rho/
MRTF
pathway
inhibitor.
The
CCG-203971–treated
cells
formed roughly half as many colonies compared with control
treatment and the colonies which formed were approximately
50% reduced in size (Fig. 4D).
CCG-203971 inhibits cellular migration and invasion
To determine whether inhibition of MRTF localization and
activity affects phenotypes of the aggressive melanoma line, we
investigated the influence of CCG-203971 at the cellular level.
Using Transwell migration and label-free Matrigel invasion
assays, we found that 10 mmol/L CCG-203971 inhibited cellular

independent experiments with at least 100 cells scored blindly for each condition. For stress fiber quantification, only cells expressing prominent stress fiber
bundles were determined to be "stress fiber positive". Results are expressed as the mean (�SEM) of triplicate experiments (��, P < 0.01 vs. SK-Mel-19). Scale bar

 migration (Fig. 5A) and invasion (Fig. 5B) of the RhoC-over-
expressing melanoma line SK-Mel-147. This migratory phenotype
is consistent with an action on MRTF-A as siRNA knockdown of
MRTF-A expression (Fig. 5C) inhibits SK-Mel-147 Transwell
migration (Fig. 5D).
CCG-203971 blocks melanoma lung metastasis
To compare the metastatic potential of the high versus low
RhoC-expressing cell lines, we injected mice with GFP-expres-
sing SK-Mel-19 and SK-Mel-147 cells. The RhoC-overexpres-
sing SK-Mel-147 cells readily formed lung metastases follow-
ing intravenous injection (Fig. 6A). The SK-Mel-147–injected
mice not only displayed more metastatic nodules (�3�) than
did SK-Mel-19–injected mice, but the tumors were much
larger (�5� greater area) than those in the SK-Mel-19–
injected mice (Fig. 6B). Thus, the total tumor burden was
greater by approximately 15 times. To determine the potential
for MRTF pathway inhibitors as metastasis-targeting therapeu-
tics, we treated mice with CCG-203971 (100 mg/kg twice
daily) or vehicle control for 18 days following tail vein
injection of GFP-expressing SK-Mel-147 cells. The CCG-
203971–treated group had about half as many tumors which
were also about 1/4 the size. This resulted in a final tumor
burden around 7 times lower than in the vehicle-treated group
(Fig. 6B).
Discussion
Mutations in BRAF and NRAS, leading to constitutive acti-
vation of the MAPK pathway, are found in nearly approximate-
ly 60%–70% of primary human cutaneous melanomas (30).
However, these driver mutations do not appear to govern the

 propensity for metastasis; BRAF vs. NRAS mutation status does
not predict patient overall survival (31). In addition, current
targeted therapeutics, such as the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemur-
afenib, demonstrate profound initial results in a majority of
BRAFV600E-expressing melanoma tumors (32). However, these
responses are limited in duration and resistance typically devel-
ops within months. Consequently, it is important to better
understand factors that drive aggressiveness and metastasis of
human melanomas. On the basis of the role of RhoC and
MRTF-regulated gene transcription in genetic studies in mouse
B16F2 melanoma and breast cancer models (2, 4, 11) and in
the TCGA dataset (24), we wanted to explore the role of those
mechanisms in human metastatic melanoma utilizing our
novel Rho/MRTF pathway inhibitor, CCG-203971.
While mutations in Rho proteins are rare, review of cancer
genomic information through cBioPortal, (33) showed that
31% of cutaneous melanomas had amplification or mutation
of RhoA/C, MKL1/2 (gene names for MRTF-A/B) or upstream
activators (GNA12, GNA13, GNAQ, GNA11, or ARHGEF11).
Furthermore, an outlier analysis of melanoma in Oncomine,
(34) showed that 5%–20% of melanomas across several
studies had marked upregulation of RhoC at the transcription-
al level. Mechanisms driving this are not known but could
include regulation by the ETS-1 transcription factor (35, 36).
Loss of E-cadherin in melanoma leads to ETS-1 activation and
enhanced RhoC expression (37). RhoC induces c-Jun expres-
sion (likely through MRTF/SRF mechanisms) which contri-
butes to cell survival (37). This could partially explain the
increased clonogenicity observed in SK-Mel-147, the RhoC-
overexpressing melanoma cell line, as well as the increased
lung colonization.
In light of the multiple genes and pathways that can lead to
activation of Rho and MRTF-regulated transcription (38, 39),
inhibition at a downstream step in the pathway would be
beneficial to disrupt signals from the numerous activation
mechanisms (40, 37). Interestingly, CCG-203971 treatment

 appears to influence SK-Mel-147 cellular morphology in such a
manner that SK-Mel-147 cells more closely resemble SK-Mel-19
cellular morphology. Further studies will need to be conducted
to better understand this observation. Our compound, CCG-
203971 prevents the nuclear accumulation of MRTF but the
molecular mechanism remains uncertain. Two proposed mod-
els include direct binding to MRTF (41) or modulation of the
intranuclear actin regulation by MICAL2 (42). Genetic valida-
tion of our pharmacologic approach to suppress metastasis has
already been shown for both melanoma and breast cancer
using MRTF-A/B double knockdown or silencing SRF (11). We
also confirm that in SK-Mel-147 cells, siRNA knockdown of
MRTF-A alone is sufficient to markedly reduce migration in
vitro. The majority of recent literature strongly implicates MRTF
and SRF as being critical factors in the regulation cell motility
(43–45). Despite the commonality between MRTF/SRF- and
YAP/TEAD–regulated target genes, as well as cell type–specific
mutual coactivation of gene expression (46), only MRTF-A
expression levels were correlated with patient survival (Fig. 3;
Supplementary Fig. S2).

 The potential for an antimetastatic small-molecule thera-
peutic that targets this gene transcription mechanism is illus-
trated by our result showing marked suppression of SK-Mel-
147 lung metastasis by in vivo treatment with CCG-203971.
While it has been argued that antimetastatic therapies are not
useful or are difficult to test clinically, there is increasing
recognition that this approach has value (47). CCG-203971
also effectively causes G1 cell-cycle arrest which is a phenotype
shared with current MAPK pathway–targeted therapeutics (48,
49). As G1-arrested melanoma cells have increased sensitivity
to MAPK pathway inhibitors (49) this suggests the potential
benefit of combination treatment with Rho/MRTF pathway
inhibitors and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Continued efforts
to optimize MRTF transcription inhibitors like CCG-203971
will be needed. In particular, enhancing potency along with
reduction of acute toxicity (12, 13) is required for chronic
treatments that would be required for antimetastasis therapies.
Furthermore, improved bioavailability and pharmacokinetics
would
facilitate both preclinical
and potentially clinical
studies.
In addition to melanoma, spontaneous nuclear localization of
MRTF-A has been reported in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(11). The MDA-MB-231 cells are often used as a model of
aggressive breast cancer cells. Intriguingly, they also harbor a Ras
mutation (KRASG13D; ref. 50) similar to the NRASQ61N in SK-Mel-
147. Additional work is needed to assess the generality of these
observations.
In this report, we provide evidence that Rho-regulated,
MRTF-mediated gene transcription signaling plays an impor-
tant role in migration, invasion, and metastasis of human
cutaneous melanoma. Thus, expression levels of RhoC and
MRTF target genes may provide useful biomarkers to identify

Rho/MRTFpathway effect on experimental lung metastasis. A, Immunocompromised mice were separated into three groups. One group received tail vein injection of
GFP-expressing SK-Mel-19 (2 � 106 cells). The other two groups were injected with GFP-expressing SK-Mel-147 (2 � 106 cells). Following tail vein injection,
the mice began twice daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg CCG-203971 or 50-mL DMSO (vehicle control). After 18 days, the mice were euthanized and lungs
were collected for histologic analysis. Sections from each lung were immunohistologically probed for GFP. Images were taken at 20� magnification, shown
are two representative images of metastatic colonies from each group. Scale bar represents 400 mm. B, Each slide was visually scanned for total number of lung
colonies, and the average tumor area was determined using image analysis software. The total tumor burden was calculated by adding together the total cross-
sectional area of all colonies identified within each mouse. Data is represented as the mean (�SEM) of n ¼ 6 (SK-Mel-19þDMSO and SK-Mel-147þDMSO)
