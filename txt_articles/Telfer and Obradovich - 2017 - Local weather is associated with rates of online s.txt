Abstract
Weather conditions are commonly believed to influence musculoskeletal pain, however the
evidence for this is mixed. This study aimed to examine the relationship between local mete-
orological conditions and online search trends for terms related to knee pain, hip pain, and
arthritis. Five years of relative online search volumes for these terms were obtained for the
50 most populous cities in the contiguous United States, along with corresponding local
weather data for temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation.
Methods from the climate econometrics literature were used to assess the casual impact of
these meteorological variables on the relative volumes of searches for pain. For tempera-
tures between -5˚C and 30˚C, search volumes for hip pain increased by 12 index points, and
knee pain increased by 18 index points. Precipitation had a negative effect on search vol-
umes for these terms. At temperatures >30˚C, search volumes for arthritis related pain
decreased by 7 index points. These patterns were not seen for pain searches unrelated to
the musculoskeletal system. In summary, selected local weather conditions are significantly
associated with online search volumes for specific musculoskeletal pain symptoms. We
believe the predominate driver for this to be the relative changes in physical activity levels
associated with meteorological conditions.
Introduction
It is a commonly held belief that a causal relationship exists between local weather conditions
and the joint pain and stiffness associated with musculoskeletal disorders [1,2]. These previous
studies have generally been limited in terms of the time period assessed [3,4], geographical
scope [5,6], or have focused on seasonal–rather than precise meteorological—variation [7].
Recently, researchers have begun to explore the potential of online search behavior as a
method to infer information about health trends at the population level, exploiting the fact
that the internet has become one of the primary sources used by individuals seeking health
information [8,9]. Non-traditional data sources including Google Trends, Wikipedia page

 view data and Twitter data have the potential to be a rich source of information for healthcare
researchers on population and regional level trends [10–12]. The potential utility of these data
in the area of musculoskeletal health research has been demonstrated, with search volume-
based time series data from the Google Trends tool having being found to contain significant
seasonality and long term trends for searches related to foot and ankle pain [13].
If a relationship between relative search volumes for arthritis and general joint pain related
terms and localized weather conditions exists, it may provide indirect evidence of the pur-
ported causal effect of weather conditions on these musculoskeletal issues at a population level,
based on the assumption that elevated symptoms would drive an increase in information seek-
ing behavior related to the condition and symptoms. Therefore, in this study, an analysis of
localized online search volume for terms related to musculoskeletal joint pain and arthritis and
their relationship to corresponding meteorological variables was explored.
Materials and methods
Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this study as it did not involve col-
lecting data directly from human participants. Search strategy reporting has been based on the
checklist developed by Nuti et al. [14]. The top 50 cities in the United States by population
were identified (based on 2014 estimates from the US Census Bureau) and the Google Trends
web interface was used to obtain weekly relative search volumes for terms related to knee pain
and stiffness (KNEE PAIN: “knee pain + painful knee + sore knee + stiff knee + knee stiff-
ness”), hip pain and stiffness (HIP PAIN: “hip pain + painful hip + sore hip + stiff hip + hip
stiffness”), and arthritis (ARTHRITIS: “arthritis + arthritic”) between 2011/01/02 and 2015/
12/26 for these municipalities. In addition, weekly relative search data for one further search
term (STOMACH PAIN: “stomach pain + painful stomach”) was obtained, this was designed
to be a control term for pain searches unrelated to musculoskeletal problems. Note that in the
Google trends tool, the “+” symbol in search terms represents the Boolean notation “OR”. The
knee and hip were chosen as they are sites with a high prevalence of pain and injury [15,16],
and pain and stiffness terms were used as these are often the primary symptoms of musculo-
skeletal disease or injury [17,18]. It is important to note that the Google Trends tool only pro-
vides relative data, normalized to a value of 100 index points which represents the peak search
volume during the period of interest, therefore it is not possible to determine the exact number
of searches being carried out. There were significant changes made to the geographical bound-
ary definitions used by Google Trends on the start date used in this study, therefore trend data
prior to this may not be directly comparable. Search terms were in the English language only,
the all query category was used, and searches were carried out on 2016/03/01.
Corresponding daily summaries of historical local weather data from January 1st 2011
to December 31st 2015 for each city were obtained from the closest weather station that moni-
tored temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Complete details
of the station locations are included in S1 Table. These weather variables were chosen as
changes in these have previously been suggested to be associated with increases in musculo-
skeletal pain symptoms [3,5,19,20].
Data processing
All analyses were carried out in R version 3.3.3. Complete datasets and analysis code are avail-
able at https://github.com/Telfer/GTrends_Arthritis_2016/.
For the search term data, city time series that were incomplete or displayed insufficient vol-
ume to provide a continuous series across the period of interest were not included in the analy-
sis, nor were those that did not have a unique geographical region definition in the Google

 Trends tool. The weather variables maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average
relative humidity, average barometric pressure, and sumtotal precipitation were extracted as
daily time series from the weather datasets for each city. Cities with data that were incomplete
for the period studied were not included in the analysis. To synchronize the weather data with
the internet search volume data, each daily time series was converted to weekly time series
data by averaging or summing over the relevant seven-day period.
Our theoretical relationship of interest is the effect of meteorological conditions on pain-
related search activity of US residents. We empirically model this relationship as:
Yist ¼ f ðtempistÞ þ Xz þ gt þ nis þ �ist
ð1Þ
In this time-series cross-sectional model fitted via ordinary least squares, i indexes cities,
t indexes calendar weeks, and s indexes years. Our dependent variable Yist is an index that rep-
resents the relative search activity on the specific topic in city i on calendar week t in year s.
Our main independent variable, tempist, represents the weekly average of daily maximum tem-
peratures over the contemporaneous week. Our relationship of interest is represented by f
(tempist), which provides separate indicator variables for each 5˚C weekly average maximum
temperature bin, allowing for flexible estimation of a nonlinear relationship between tempera-
ture and search activity [21,22]. We omit the 25–30˚C indicator variable, and thus interpret
our estimates as the change in search activity associated with a particular temperature range
relative to the 25–30˚C baseline for each of our search pain topics.
Further, the Xz term in Eq 1 represents an additional set of meteorological variables that
include weekly sumtotal precipitation, average diurnal temperature range, average barometric
pressure, and average relative humidity. We include these other meteorological variables as
their exclusion might bias our estimates of the effect of included meteorological variables [23].
Unobserved characteristics may influence search activity in a particular city in a particular
week. For example, people may exercise more–and thus search for exercise related pain more–
in cities with better infrastructure or on days when they are more likely to have leisure time. To
be sure that geographic and temporal factors like these do not bias our estimates, we include γt,
and νis in Eq 1. These terms represent calendar week and city-by-year indicator variables that
account for unobserved characteristics constant across cities and weeks as well as temporal fac-
tors that might vary differentially by city [24]. Our identifying assumption, consistent with the
literature [23,25,26], is that meteorological variables are as good as random after conditioning
on these fixed effects. The estimated model coefficients can thus be interpreted as the effect of
meteorological conditions on observed search activity [27,28].
Results
Full results from the regression analysis are presented in Table 1. Fig 1 panel (a), which presents
the estimates of f(tempist) from Eq 1, indicates hip pain related search activity increases up to
25–30˚C and decreases past 30˚C, though effects at higher temperatures are estimated with
greater error. Average maximum temperatures around 0˚C produce a reduction of approxi-
mately index points in hip pain search activity as compared to the 25–30˚C baseline (coefficient:
-6.874, p: 0.005, n: 9,087). Panel (b) of Fig 1 estimates Eq 1 for knee pain related searches. Aver-
age maximum temperatures around 0˚C produce a reduction of approximately 12 index points
in knee pain search activity as compared to the 25–30˚C baseline (coefficient: -11.53, p: <0.001,
n: 10,387). Panel (c) of Fig 1 produces estimates for arthritis pain related searches. We observe
no significant effects of cold temperatures on arthritis search rates, though temperatures above
35˚C produce a reduction of approximately 8 index points in arthritis pain search activity as
compared to the 25–30˚C baseline (coefficient: -7.812, p: 0.006, n: 11,687). Finally, panel (d) of

 Fig 1 suggests that the relationship between maximum temperatures and stomach pain related
search activity is inverted from the musculoskeletal search activity. Cold temperatures and hot
temperatures increase stomach pain related search activity relative to more mild temperatures.
In addition to the effect of temperature on search activity, we observe a smaller, statistically
significant linear effect of weekly precipitation (in centimeters) on both hip and knee pain
related search activity (hip coefficient: -0.3, p: 0.025, n:9,087; knee coefficient: -0.443, p:,
n:10,387).

 Discussion
This study analyzed online search volume data for musculoskeletal pain related terms in cities
across the contiguous United States and found statistically significant associations with local
temperatures and precipitation. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to use this
type of methodology to investigate the relationship between local weather patterns and muscu-
loskeletal pain symptoms. Although search volume data is a proxy measure of symptom preva-
lence, the 5-year analysis period here is considerably longer than most previous studies in this
area, and covers a potential sample size of tens of millions, based on the population of the cities
studied and adjusted for internet users and users of the Google search engine.
The most notable associations were found between increasing volumes of knee and hip
pain searches and increasing temperatures (up to 25–30˚C). These findings appear to be robust
in terms of internet search data, as the search volumes for stomach pain, our control term,
were found to have a very different pattern relative to temperature. Stomach pain information
was more searched for during weeks where the temperature was either relatively low or high,
and the minimum occurred between 15–25˚C. As this type of pain is unlikely to be driven by
the same mechanisms as musculoskeletal pain, the discordance between the search volume
patterns provides confidence that the associations found between weather and searches for
musculoskeletal pain are not simply an artifact of general internet usage during different
weather conditions.
This analysis assumes that individuals with musculoskeletal problems will search for infor-
mation about their condition and its symptoms during periods where those symptoms are ele-
vated. Previous studies using online trend data to study healthcare related problems have
shown good correlations between search data and safety alerts [12] and seasonality in pre-
scribed pharmaceuticals [11]. While duplicate search terms from the same computer are not
included in the analysis, it is possible that other search terms relating to the topics of interest
Fig 1. Maximum temperatures and searches for pain symptoms. This figure draws from the estimation of the model in Eq 1 on the weekly search
behavior of citizens in 45 US cities between 2011 and 2015. It plots the estimated search activity associated with each maximum temperature bin for each
search topic. Search activity for hip pain (panel (a)) and knee pain (panel (b)) increases up to 25–30˚C (77-86F) and begins to decline past that point, though
the effects of hotter temperatures are estimated with higher uncertainty. Search activity for arthritis symptoms (panel (c)) shows no significant effect of cold
temperatures, but shows some decrease for markedly hot maximum temperatures. Search activity for our measure of non-musculoskeletal pain, stomach
symptoms (panel (d)), indicates an inverse relationship, with search activity increasing in both cold and hot temperatures relative to more mild temperatures.
Shaded error bounds represent 95% confidence intervals.

 could have been used. Search volume data is currently only available in weekly intervals for the
period studied, somewhat limiting the temporal resolution of the analysis. Because search
activity is geolocated to the city-level, measurement error may exist between the temperatures
observed at a weather station and the temperature that an individual actually experienced, pos-
sibly attenuating the magnitude of our estimates [29]. We do not have information about the
individuals performing the searches. Sampling bias may be present due to age, income, or pre-
ferred internet search engine. For example, older adults have the greatest prevalence of arthri-
tis symptoms, and are less likely to use the internet. However, these usage rates are increasing:
in the USA in 2014 over half of those over 65 reported being regular users [30], and in some
cases searches may be conducted by another individual on behalf of the person with the symp-
toms. Due to insufficient data, several of the top 50 cities monitored had to be left out of the
analysis. The Google Trends tool only records search volumes if the number of searches is
greater than a certain threshold, the level of which is unknown, meaning that at certain times
the data were missing or only available in monthly detail. It is possible that further develop-
ments to the Google Trends Tool, leading to better geographical boundaries will improve this.
There have been previous reports of elevated temperatures leading to increased pain after
orthopaedic trauma [31], however studies in patients with arthritis have found no such rela-
tionship [3], or in some cases have reported negative correlations [5]. The positive correlation
seen between temperature and joint pain search volumes in the present study may relate to
general increases in activity patterns during warmer temperatures, potentially leading to more
overuse and acute injuries during these periods [32,33]. In addition, small decreases were seen
for knee and hip pain searches when temperatures increased to over 30˚C. We can hypothesize
that this pattern may be explained by individuals becoming more active—and therefore more
at risk of injury—as temperatures increase up to a certain level, until it becomes too hot to
exercise comfortably. This proposed pattern of increasing activity levels until a certain temper-
ature has been reached and thereafter a decline in activity levels is supported by recent findings
[34]. In the present study, no clear pattern was seen for arthritis related search terms as the
temperature increased to 25–30˚C, however we did see a significant reduction in search vol-
ume as temperatures increased above 30˚C, similar to that seen for the knee and hip pain
terms. The driving mechanism for this may also be related to a reduction in activity, or it may
be due to some other effect that requires further investigation.
Other weather variables were found to be associated with search volumes. Most notable
among these was precipitation, which was associated with a small but significant reduction in
hip and knee pain search volumes. This again we hypothesize to be driven by a reduction in
activity levels during periods of rain [34]. A significant effect of barometric pressure on knee
pain searches was found. Increases in pain have been found to be associated with low baromet-
ric pressures after orthopaedic trauma [31], however in people with arthritis the opposite
effect tended to be shown [6,19]. In contrast to barometric pressure and temperature, relative
humidity was not found to be associated with any of the search term volumes. This weather
variable has mixed evidence in for an effect on people with arthritis, with several studies find-
ing an association [5,19,35], but others finding no effect [4,6,20]. Additional weather variables
such as dew point may be more reflective of our perception of comfort than humidity [36],
and could be the subject of further research to investigate this finding.
Future work will explore the relationship between internet search data and musculoskeletal
pain further and may have implications for healthcare provision. These searches are rarely pre-
ceded by consultation with a medical professional, particularly in younger individuals [9],
therefore, if significant and clinically relevant effects are reflected in the individual-level data,
this information may allow healthcare providers to allocate resources more efficiently or pro-
vide different treatment strategies during time periods when temperatures are elevated, or by

 developing a surveillance tool using a model based on the search volume data and other factors.
Online search data however requires careful assessment and use [37]. Perhaps the highest profile
use of this type of data was in the case of Google Flu Trends [10], which showed initial promise
as a surveillance tool that was able to detect regional influenza outbreaks faster than traditional
disease monitoring techniques. However, reductions were subsequently found in the prospective
accuracy of the tool and although modifications to the original tool have again improved its accu-
racy by, among other amendments, regularly updating the model using Center for Disease Con-
trol data [38], this case demonstrates the care that has to be taken with this type of data. Bearing
in mind these caveats, these novel data sources do however remain an active area research, with
many groups around the world applying it to different healthcare related problems [39–42].
A model to predict the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain would require significant further
development of the methodology and validation against individual level data to determine if
changes in search volumes are indeed related to changes in individual specific pain and health-
care seeking behavior. External factors such as economic conditions have been shown to be
associated with increases in musculoskeletal search volumes and may need to be included in
any predictive model [43]. In addition, future work may supplement these analyses by study-
ing search terms in different languages, and across different regions to determine if these
results are consistent on a global scale.
This study provides further confirmation that the study of online search data may have the
potential to provide insights into healthcare related issues at the population level. Further
work is required to determine if a local surveillance tool for musculoskeletal conditions can be
developed based on the search volume data.
