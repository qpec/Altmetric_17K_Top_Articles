Abstract
Background. The aim of this study was to build a detailed, integrative profile of the correlates
of young adults’ feelings of loneliness, in terms of their current health and functioning and
their childhood experiences and circumstances.
Methods. Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth
cohort of 2232 individuals born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. Loneliness was mea-
sured when participants were aged 18. Regression analyses were used to test concurrent asso-
ciations between loneliness and health and functioning in young adulthood. Longitudinal
analyses were conducted to examine childhood factors associated with young adult loneliness.
Results. Lonelier young adults were more likely to experience mental health problems, to
engage in physical health risk behaviours, and to use more negative strategies to cope with
stress. They were less confident in their employment prospects and were more likely to be
out of work. Lonelier young adults were, as children, more likely to have had mental health
difficulties and to have experienced bullying and social isolation. Loneliness was evenly dis-
tributed across genders and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Conclusions. Young adults’ experience of loneliness co-occurs with a diverse range of pro-
blems, with potential implications for health in later life. The findings underscore the import-
ance of early intervention to prevent lonely young adults from being trapped in loneliness as
they age.
Introduction
Loneliness is a distressing and pervasive experience, defined as the feeling that one’s desired
quantity or quality of the social connection is unfulfilled (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). Among
older people, it is associated with a diverse range of health outcomes, including cardiovascular
disease and stroke (Valtorta et al. 2016), increases in blood pressure (Hawkley et al. 2010),
changes in gene expression (Cole et al. 2007), elevated cortisol (Adam et al. 2006), cognitive
impairments (Shankar et al. 2013) and physical decline (Perissinotto et al. 2012). A large body
of epidemiological evidence has established loneliness as a strong predictor of premature
death, with effect sizes similar to or greater than other well-established risk factors such as
smoking and obesity (Elovainio et al. 2017; Holt-Lunstad et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2012).
According to a cross-national study by the Office for National Statistics (2014), the percentage
of the UK population with access to supportive social relationships is the third-lowest of all
the 28 EU nations. This makes loneliness a public health concern of particular relevance to
the UK.
Although widely studied from a gerontological perspective, loneliness is not confined to old
age and is particularly prevalent among young adults (Victor & Yang, 2012; Qualter et al.
2015). A survey by the Mental Health Foundation (2010) has indicated that the proportion
of people in the UK who often feel lonely, worry about feeling lonely, and seek help for lone-
liness is highest among younger people (aged 18–34 years) compared with older age groups.
More than half of young adults surveyed reported having felt depressed at some time because
they felt alone, compared with one-third of older respondents. Given this high prevalence,
young adults today could be particularly at risk for loneliness-related health problems in
later life. This high occurrence of loneliness among the young also underscores the need for
greater understanding of how loneliness impacts young people’s lives and the early factors
that contribute to its emergence.

 Feelings of loneliness have been shown to predict increases in
depressive symptoms in both older and younger people (Cacioppo
et al. 2010; Vanhalst et al. 2012). As well as being a risk factor for
psychopathology, loneliness may co-occur with a broad variety of
other health and lifestyle-related impairments, making it a risk
marker of high clinical relevance. This could be particularly
true for young adults, given the high prevalence of loneliness in
this group and the life changes that take place at this age, such
as entering the labour market and leaving the family home. The
burden of loneliness may undermine young people’s confidence
in their employment prospects or lead them to adopt maladaptive
coping strategies and behaviours detrimental to later health.
Wide-ranging descriptive research on loneliness is required to
study its pervasiveness across different domains of health and
functioning.
As well as examining the profile of loneliness in terms of its
correlates in adulthood, it is important to consider individuals’ child-
hood history and experiences that may shape individuals’ vulnerabil-
ity to loneliness. On the one hand, loneliness is likely to be an
adversitythatcanbefallpeoplefromadiverserange of socioeconomic
and family backgrounds. On the other hand, emotional problems or
difficulties with peer relationships in the childhood years may fore-
shadow greater feelings of loneliness in young adulthood. The inves-
tigation of these potential risk factors can help to identify groups of
children who are particularly vulnerable to becoming lonely in
adulthood and to identify targets for preventative interventions.
The aim of the present study was to examine the profile of
loneliness in a prospective, contemporary, nationally representa-
tive cohort of 18 year-olds living in the UK. Cross-sectional
data were used to investigate the functioning of lonely young
adults in four domains: mental health, physical health and health
risks, coping and functioning, and career prospects. Longitudinal
data were used to examine the childhood history of lonely indivi-
duals, in terms of the family environment, child characteristics,
mental health, as well as victimisation and social relationships.
Methods
Participants
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk)
Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the development of a
birth cohort of 2232 British children. The sample was drawn
from a larger birth register of twins born in England and Wales
in 1994–1995 (Trouton et al. 2002). Full details about the sample
are reported elsewhere (Moffitt & E-Risk Study Team, 2002).
Briefly, the E-Risk sample was constructed in 1999–2000, when
1116 families (93% of those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old
twins participated in home-visit assessments. This sample com-
prised 56% monozygotic (MZ) and 44% dizygotic (DZ) twin
pairs; sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male).
Families were recruited to represent the UK population with
newborns in the 1990s, to ensure adequate numbers of children
in disadvantaged homes and to avoid an excess of twins born
to well-educated
women
using
assisted
reproduction.
The
study sample represents the full range of socioeconomic condi-
tions in Great Britain, as reflected in the families’ distribution
on
a
neighbourhood-level
socioeconomic
index
[ACORN
(A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods), developed by
CACI Inc. for commercial use] (Odgers et al. 2012a, b).
Specifically, E-Risk families’ ACORN distribution matches that
of households nation-wide: 25.6% of E-Risk families live in
‘wealthy achiever’ neighbourhoods compared with 25.3% nation-
wide; 5.3% v. 11.6% live in ‘urban prosperity’ neighbourhoods;
29.6% v. 26.9% live in ‘comfortably off’ neighbourhoods; 13.4%
v. 13.9% live in ‘moderate means’ neighbourhoods; and 26.1%
v. 20.7% live in ‘hard-pressed’ neighbourhoods. E-Risk underre-
presents ‘urban prosperity’ neighbourhoods because such houses
are likely to be childless.
Follow-up home visits were conducted when the children were
aged 7 (98% participation), 10 (96%), 12 (96%) and at 18 years
(93%). There were 2066 children who participated in the E-Risk
assessments at age 18, and the proportions of MZ (55%) and
male same-sex (47%) twins were almost identical to those
found in the original sample at age 5. The average age of the
twins at the time of the assessment was 18.4 years (S.D. = 0.36);
all interviews were conducted after their 18th birthday. There
were no differences between those who did and did not take
part at age 18 in terms of socioeconomic status (SES) assessed
when the cohort was initially defined (χ2 = 0.86, p = 0.65), age-5
IQ scores (t = 0.98, p = 0.33), or age-5 emotional or behavioural
problems (t = 0.40, p = 0.69 and t = 0.41, p = 0.68, respectively).
Home visits at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 years included assessments
with participants as well as their mother (or primary caretaker).
The home visits at age 18 included interviews only with the par-
ticipants. The Joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute
of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee approved each phase of
the study. Parents gave informed consent and twins gave assent
between 5 and 12 years and then informed consent at age 18.
Measures
Loneliness
Loneliness was assessed when participants were 18 using four
items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Version 3 (Russell,
1996): ‘How often do you feel that you lack companionship?’,
‘How often do you feel left out?’, ‘How often do you feel isolated
from others?’ and ‘How often do you feel alone?’ A very similar
short form of the UCLA scale has previously been developed
for use in large-scale surveys and correlates strongly with the
full 20-item version (Hughes et al. 2004). The scale was adminis-
tered as part of a computer-based self-complete questionnaire.
Interviewers were blind to participants’ responses. The items
were rated ‘hardly ever’ (0), ‘some of the time’ (1) or ‘often’ (2).
Items
were
summed
to
produce
a total
loneliness
score
(Cronbach α = 0.83). The heritability of loneliness has been
reported in a previous study of the E-Risk cohort (Matthews
et al. 2016), in which 38% of the variance in loneliness was esti-
mated to be explained by genetic influences.
Correlates of loneliness in young adulthood
Functioning in adulthood was measured in terms of mental
health, physical health and health risks, coping and functioning,
and employment prospects. Mental health measures comprised
past year diagnoses of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, alcohol dependence
and cannabis dependence, as well as any instances of self-harm or
suicide attempts between ages 12 and 18. Participants also reported
whether they had seen a GP, psychiatrist, counsellor or psycho-
therapist for mental health problems in the past year. The physical
health and health risk domain comprised measures of body mass
index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation),
day-to-day physical activity and daily smoking. The coping and
functioning domain included life satisfaction, coping with stress

 and problematic technology use. Participants were asked about
their highest qualification level, and whether they were currently
in employment or studying. Participants also completed question-
naires about their job search behaviour, their optimism about
opportunities to succeed in their career, and their perceived job
preparedness. Full details of measures are shown in Table 1.
Childhood predictors of loneliness in young adulthood
Childhood measures were collected between the ages 5 and 12.
Predictors were grouped in four domains: family environment,
child characteristics, child mental health, and experiences of vic-
timisation and social relationships. Family environment variables
included maternal warmth, maternal depression, parental anti-
social behaviour and exposure to domestic violence. Child charac-
teristics captured IQ, theory of mind, and personality traits such as
openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeable-
ness and neuroticism. Child mental health variables were symp-
tom counts of depression, anxiety, ADHD, conduct disorder and
substance use (alcohol, tobacco and other drugs). Victimisation
comprised measures of physical maltreatment by an adult and
bullying by peers, while social relationships were indexed by social
isolation. Full details of measures are shown in Table 1.
Data analysis
Concurrent associations between loneliness and mental health
diagnoses, self-harm, suicide attempts and service use in young
adulthood were tested using logistic regressions. Associations
between loneliness and measures of physical health and health
risks, coping and functioning and employment prospects were
tested using linear and logistic regressions. Loneliness was entered
as the independent variable in each analysis.
Longitudinal analyses were conducted using linear regression
with age-18 loneliness as the outcome variable. Childhood predic-
tors were entered individually. As a further step, to test the inde-
pendence of the associations, the variables that were significantly
associated with loneliness were entered together in blocks by
domain (family environment, child characteristics, child mental
health, victimisation and social relationships). Significant predic-
tors from each domain were then entered into a final model.

 The proportion of participants with missing data from the inter-
view assessments was ⩽10% for all variables except CRP (13%).
Cases with incomplete data were excluded listwise in all regression
analyses. Participants in this study were pairs of same-sex twins,
and therefore each family contained data for two individuals,
resulting in non-independent observations. To correct for this, all
regression analyses were based on the Huber–White or sandwich
variance (Williams, 2000), which adjusts the estimated standard
errors to account for the dependence in the data. Regression ana-
lyses were conducted in Stata, version 14 (StataCorp, 2015).
Results
Prevalence of loneliness
In response to the four items about feelings of loneliness, 23–31%
of participants reported experiencing any of these feelings ‘some of
the time’, and 5–7% reported feeling them ‘often’ (Fig. 1). These
rates indicate that feelings of loneliness in the general population
of young adults are not uncommon but their frequency is high
only in a small group. All subsequent analyses were conducted
using the summed scale of these items (M = 1.57, S.D. = 1.94).
Mean levels of loneliness did not differ across genders (males
M = 1.51, females M = 1.62; p = 0.22), nor across SES groups
(low M = 1.69, middle M = 1.52, high M = 1.49; p = 0.09).
Correlates of loneliness in young adulthood
Lonelier 18 year-olds were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria
for depression, anxiety, ADHD, conduct disorder, alcohol and
cannabis dependence, to have self-harmed, and to have attempted
suicide (Table 2). Loneliness was most strongly associated with
depression and anxiety, the odds of which more than doubled
with a one standard deviation increase in loneliness. The overlap
between loneliness and these two disorders is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Lonelier individuals were also more likely to have sought help for
mental health problems from a GP, psychiatrist, counsellor or
psychotherapist in the past year.
Loneliness was not associated cross-sectionally with indicators of
poor physical health, such as BMI or CRP (Table 2). However, it was
associated with risk behaviours that predict future ill health: lonelier
individuals engaged in less day-to-day physical activity and were
more likely to be daily smokers. Lonelier young adults had lower
overall life satisfaction, reported more problematic technology use,
and used more negative strategies to cope with stress, such as with-
drawing and obsessing about problems rather than seeking help or
taking pragmatic steps to rectify the situation. Loneliness was unre-
lated to individuals’ efforts to seek employment. Nonetheless, lone-
lier 18 year-olds were more likely to be out of work and education,
and to have low educational qualifications. Regard to job market pre-
paredness, lonelier individuals rated themselves lower in terms of
their personal attributes (e.g. team working), but not their practical
skills (e.g. computer programming). They also reported lower opti-
mism about their ability to succeed in life.
Tests of robustness and independence
The associations between loneliness and each mental health disorder
were tested further by controlling for prior symptoms of the disorder
in childhood. All associations remained significant (Table 3). As a
furtherstep,to testthe independence of eachassociation,allcomorbid
mental health problems in young adulthood were additionally
controlled for. Loneliness remained independently associated with
Fig. 1. Prevalence of reported feelings of loneliness among young adults.

 depression, anxiety, ADHD, conduct disorder, self-harm and suicide
attempts, but not with alcohol or cannabis dependence.
The independence of the associations between loneliness and
life satisfaction, coping, problematic technology use, job market
preparedness (personal attributes) and optimism were tested by
controlling for mental health problems. All associations remained
robust to these controls (life satisfaction β = −0.29, 95% CI −0.34
to −0.25; coping β = −0.27, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.22; problematic
technology use β = 0.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.23; job market pre-
paredness β = −0.20, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.14; optimism β =
−0.20, 95% CI −0.25 to −0.15). Furthermore, the associations
between loneliness and lower job market preparedness and opti-
mism remained significant when controlling additionally for
being not in employment, education or training, and for having
low qualifications (job market preparedness β = 0.19, 95% CI
−0.26 to −0.14; optimism β = −0.19, 95% CI −0.24 to −0.14).
Childhood predictors of loneliness in young adulthood
Loneliness was not associated with aspects of the early family
environment, including maternal warmth, maternal depression,
parental antisocial behaviour and domestic violence in the
home (Table 4). However, children who had higher levels of neur-
oticism, depression or anxiety, or who experienced bullying or social
isolation in childhood were lonelier at age 18. When these predic-
tors were considered together, they all remained independently
associated with loneliness, although the effect sizes were small. IQ
and theory of mind were associated with loneliness in the univariate
analyses but became non-significant when controlling for other
variables. Childhood ADHD, conduct disorder and substance use
did not predict loneliness when controlling for depression and anx-
iety. Physical maltreatment was not associated with loneliness after
social isolation and bullying were accounted for.

 Discussion
Loneliness is an important determinant of long-term health and
functioning. Although often presumed to be an affliction of
older age, this study demonstrates that loneliness is also a com-
mon experience in young people, occurring indiscriminately
across genders and socioeconomic strata. The findings also
show that loneliness is a marker of poor functioning across
many different domains of well-being and health. To reduce the
public health burden of loneliness in later life, the experience of
feeling lonely in this age group merits particular consideration.
This study builds upon previous research showing that loneli-
ness is robustly associated with depression (Cacioppo et al. 2010;
Vanhalst et al. 2012) and extends these findings to a range of
other
mental
health
problems.
Despite
high
comorbidity
between the disorders under investigation, loneliness was inde-
pendently associated with each one. The only exceptions to
this were alcohol and cannabis dependence, possibly because
substance abuse is a social activity among young adults (Borsari
& Carey, 2001). This pervasiveness of loneliness across different
mental health disorders could imply either that loneliness’ effect
on psychopathology is pleiotropic in nature or, conversely, that

 individuals with any mental health disorder are more likely to feel
lonely and marginalised.
With regard to physical health, long-term outcomes of loneli-
ness may not present until later adulthood, and this could explain
why no differences were found in BMI in this young cohort,
whereas such an association has been found in other samples of
adults (Lauder et al. 2006). The null association with CRP, how-
ever, is consistent with other findings which suggest that objective
social isolation, rather than feeling lonely, may be more strongly
associated with inflammation (Shankar et al. 2011). Nonetheless,
the finding that lonelier individuals were more likely to engage
in physical health risk behaviours could signal cause for concern
with regard to health outcomes later in adulthood. Furthermore,
a previous study using the same cohort (Matthews et al. 2017)
found that lonelier individuals had poorer sleep quality in young
adulthood, which may further compromise health over time.
Feelings of loneliness co-occur with difficulties in other
domains of functioning, beyond mental and physical health. For
instance, lonelier individuals reported poorer global satisfaction
with their lives and adopted more negative ways of coping with
stress. Regarding technology use, although social media and mes-
saging apps could provide lonely individuals with opportunities to
form and strengthen social connections with others (Nowland
et al. 2018), lonelier young adults in this study reported using
technology compulsively, at the expense of other activities and
obligations. Excessive use of electronic devices may, in turn, con-
stitute an additional risk for impaired sleep quality (Carter et al.
2016).
School leavers in the UK today enter an economy still recover-
ing from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. Low wage growth,
decreased job security and rising house prices mean that young
people face considerable challenges and uncertainty in their pur-
suit of financial stability (Belfield et al. 2014). Even though they
were from similar socioeconomic backgrounds, lonelier young
adults had lower educational attainment by age 18 than their non-
lonely peers and were more likely to be out of work and educa-
tion. This suggests either that loneliness could be a force for
downward social mobility, or alternatively that being unemployed

 could itself diminish individuals’ sense of belonging. Although
they were no less committed to job-seeking, lonelier young adults
were less optimistic about their career prospects. Lonely indivi-
duals
are
characterised
by shyness
and
lower
self-esteem
(Cacioppo et al. 2006), and these traits may undermine their con-
fidence in their ability to compete in the labour market. Low
income and unemployment may, in turn, contribute to feelings
of loneliness (Luhmann & Hawkley, 2016).
The longitudinal findings indicate that young adults’ propen-
sity to feel lonely can be shaped by experiences earlier in life.
Adversities in the family environment, though important for
other emotional and behavioural outcomes (Caspi et al. 2004;
Jaffee et al. 2007), do not appear to be associated specifically
with loneliness. Instead, early risk factors for loneliness lie with
children’s own emotional health and experiences with their
peers. It should be noted, however, that the effect sizes of these
factors were small. Furthermore, while parental psychopathology
and domestic violence did not predict loneliness, this does not
rule out a potential role of other factors in the home, such as neg-
lect or sibling relationship quality.
This study has some limitations. First, as loneliness was mea-
sured only at one time point, the directionality of the associations
could not be tested. Further longitudinal research is needed to
advance causal hypotheses about the observed associations.
Second, it was not possible to investigate the stability of loneliness
from childhood to adulthood. Different trajectories of loneliness
during childhood and adolescence may predict different outcomes
(Qualter et al. 2013). Third, because the sample consisted of
twins, all participants had at least one sibling, which could
mean that the correlates of loneliness are underestimated.
Nonetheless, the prevalence of loneliness in this sample is similar
to that found in other studies of young people (Mental Health
Foundation, 2010; Victor & Yang, 2012). Fourth, this study
focused on residents of one particular country, and the generalis-
ability of these data to other regions of the world is not clear.
Similar research in different populations is required to establish
whether loneliness and its correlates differ across national and
cultural demarcations.
Conclusion
The implications of chronic loneliness for longevity (Holt-Lunstad
et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2012; Elovainio et al. 2017) attest to the
importance of intervening early to prevent loneliness persisting
across time. However, simply increasing individuals' amount of
social contact with others is unlikely to be sufficient, as loneliness
can be experienced even in the company of others. A meta-ana-
lysis of interventions to reduce loneliness indicates that the most
successful strategies involve addressing destructive patterns of
social cognition in a counselling or psychotherapeutic setting
(Masi et al. 2011). Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate
that strategies to prevent the emergence of loneliness in young
people should devote particular attention to children who experi-
ence problems of an internalising nature, or who are bullied or iso-
lated by their peers.
