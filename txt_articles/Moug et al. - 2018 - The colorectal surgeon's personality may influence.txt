Abstract
Aim Colorectal surgeons regularly make the decision to
anastomose, defunction or form an end colostomy
when performing rectal surgery. This study aimed to
define personality traits of colorectal surgeons and
explore any influence of such traits on the decision to
perform a rectal anastomosis.
Method Fifty attendees of The Association of Colo-
proctology of Great Britain and Ireland 2016 Confer-
ence participated. After written consent, all underwent
personality testing: alexithymia (inability to understand
emotions), type of thinking process (intuitive versus
rational) and personality traits (extraversion, agreeable-
ness, openness, emotional stability, conscientiousness).
Questions were answered regarding anastomotic deci-
sions in various clinical scenarios and results analysed to
reveal any influence of the surgeon’s personality on
anastomotic decision.
Results Participants were: male (86%), consultants (84%)
and based in England (68%). Alexithymia was low (4%)
with 81% displaying intuitive thinking (reflex, fast). Par-
ticipants scored higher in emotional stability (ability to
remain
calm)
and
conscientiousness
(organized,
methodical) compared with population norms. Personal-
ity traits influenced the next anastomotic decision if: sur-
geons had recently received criticism at a departmental
audit meeting; were operating with an anaesthetist that
was not their regular one; or there had been no anasto-
motic leaks in their patients for over 1 year.
Conclusion Colorectal surgeons have speciality relevant
personalities that potentially influence the important
decision to anastomose and could explain the variation
in surgical practice across the UK. Future work should
explore these findings in other countries and any link of
personality traits to patient-related outcomes.

What does this paper add to the literature?
The personality of the colorectal surgeon has not been
documented before. Traits that are favourable to such a
specialty – intuitive thinking, conscientiousness, open-
ness and the ability to understand emotions – have been
found. In addition, some personality traits appear to
influence the individual surgeon’s operative decision-
making.
Introduction
In colorectal surgery, rectal anastomotic leakage is the
single greatest risk factor for perioperative mortality
leading to poorer long-term oncological outcomes and
quality of life [1–4]. Surgeons must take an individual
patient-centred
approach
when
deciding
the
best
option: primary anastomosis alone; primary anastomosis

 anastomosis and reduce the need for reoperation); or
permanent end colostomy (usually for poorly function-
ing or high-risk patients) [5–8]. However, anastomotic
practice across the UK varies despite the likelihood that
surgeons with similar levels of experience are operating
on
similar
patients
with
similar
intra-operative
factors [9].
Heuristics in surgery is a growing academic area
striving to identify biases, particularly situational factors
and personality traits that are unrelated to patient char-
acteristics. Such insights are desirable to ensure that
predictable flaws or biases are identified, acknowledged
and subsequently modified to prevent flawed decision-
making and improve outcomes; the published work on
heuristics in prevention of major bile duct injury during
cholecystectomy is an example [10–12].
In the first work to explore the heuristics of rectal
anastomosis, a survey of the Colorectal Surgical Society
of Australia and New Zealand (75% response rate) sug-
gested that older surgeons and those more likely to
take risks in their personal life were less likely to form
stomas in patients undergoing resection for rectal can-
cer [13]. The authors highlighted that the impact of
surgeon age on stoma formation was converse to risk-
taking behaviour in the general population, which
declines with age [14]. The same group confirmed
these findings in UK colorectal surgeons (lower survey
response rate of 19%), additionally reporting that sur-
geons who believed that they had a lower than average
anastomotic leak rate were also less likely to choose
stoma formation [15].
To advance understanding of the heuristics of rectal
anastomosis we performed a Delphi exercise with three
aims: to describe personality traits of colorectal sur-
geons; to describe anastomotic decisions by individual
surgeons in different anastomotic scenarios to confirm
variation in practice; and to explore the influence of
personality traits on anastomotic decisions.
Method
The Edinburgh Delphi (whEn to avoid or DefunctIoN
a rectal anastomosis: what Behaviours and situational
factors UndeRlie the decision-makinG patHway) was
developed with the support of the Association of Colo-
proctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) and
executed at their annual meeting (4 July 2016, in Edin-
burgh, Scotland, UK) [16]. ACPGBI initiatives involv-
ing
clinical
and
patient
groups
had
previously
highlighted anastomotic decision-making in rectal sur-
gery as a key research area [17,18].
The design was based on the modified Delphi
method that can be used to achieve expert consensus
in situations where established theory or evidence does
not create an absolute answer [19]. A steering group
consisting of a health research psychologist, two patient
representatives,
colorectal
trainees
and
consultants
designed and executed the meeting which comprised
two rounds: Round 1, psychological and personality
questionnaires followed by case presentations; Round 2,
clinical scenarios with interactive Delphi facilitated by a
panel of steering group members and real-time voting.
Participants
The total of 50 participants was pragmatically selected
to allow every participant the opportunity to express his
or her viewpoint in the interactive discussion sections.
For inclusion, participants had to be making regular
independent rectal anastomotic decisions: postfellowship
exam surgical trainees (i.e. speciality trainee level 7/8);
post-CCT fellows (completion of Certification of Train-
ing); staff grades and consultants. An open invitation
was made for volunteers via ACPGBI mailing lists and
social media with the information that the Edinburgh
Delphi was investigating factors influencing the anasto-
motic decision and that completion of psychological
and personality questionnaires was required. Ethical
approval was obtained from the School of Psychology
Ethics Committee, University of Nottingham (reference
number 849; 13 June 2016) and each participant com-
pleted a written consent form.
Round 1: psychological and personality questionnaires
Demographics, institutional details and surgical experi-
ence were recorded and each participant completed the
following questionnaires: Toronto Alexithymia Scale
[20–22], Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) [23] and the
Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) [24] (Appen-
dices S2–S4 in the online Supporting Information).
Each participant had 3 min to complete each question-
naire in silence and without interpersonal interaction.
Alexithymia
Alexithymia is the inability of an individual to identify
and describe feelings both in themselves and others.
The validated Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) con-
sists of 20 items with participants rating their affinity
for each characteristic item on a five-point Likert-scale
(1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree) result-
ing in a score ranging from 20 to 100 [20–22,25–27].
Using predetermined cut-offs, an individual is consid-
ered to have high alexithymia if the TAS-20 score is 61
or greater, borderline if 52–60 and not present if 51 or
less.

Personality influences decision-making
S. J. Moug et al.
 Cognitive Reflection Test
The CRT is a three-question test that measures the abil-
ity of the participant to switch from system 1 thinking
(intuitive, type 1 thinker) to system 2 thinking (rational,
analytical, type 2 thinker) [23]. Each of the three ques-
tions had a correct analytical answer and an incorrect
intuitive answer and all had to be completed within
3 min. Each correctly answered question scored one
point, resulting in a range of scores from 0 to 3, with
higher scores equating to a greater use of rational, ana-
lytical processing.
Personality
Personality was assessed using the validated TIPI, a short,
easy to use and valid personality score. Ten pairs of adjec-
tives assess the big five personality domains: extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and
openness to experiences [24]. For each pair, participants
were asked to consider the statement ‘I see my self as . . .’
and responded on a seven-point Likert scale (1 for
strongly disagree up to 7 for strongly agree). Each adjec-
tive pair has an opposite statement where the scoring
from 1 to 7 is reversed. For example, extraversion was
scored from ‘I see myself as enthusiastic and extraverted’
with the reverse scoring for ‘reserved and quiet’. The two
scores for each pair were added together then divided by
two to give a single score for each of the five personality
groups, higher scores equating to higher levels.
Round 1: case presentations
In silence and with no interaction, each participant
completed six case presentations (Table 1). With the
aim of establishing a variation in anastomotic practice
by the participants, all cases were designed to highlight
common patient and operative situations that a colorec-
tal surgeon may encounter when making an anasto-
motic decision in anterior resection. Each scenario had
three possible answers: anastomosis; anastomosis with
defunctioning stoma; no anastomosis with end stoma.
Each participant had 2 min to individually answer each
scenario anonymously via a keypad. To minimize exter-
nal influence, each table completed the scenarios in a
different order from other tables and the results were
not displayed at any point.
Round 2: clinical scenarios and interactive Delphi
Each scenario was designed to explore situational influ-
ences on participants that did not relate to patient or
intra-operative factors. In order, each of the seven scenar-
ios was explained to the participants, followed by ‘How
does this influence your next decision to perform an
anastomosis?’ and then all participants were invited to
discuss. During each scenario discussion, participants
voted at any point on a keypad using a Likert scale from
1 (‘not at all likely’) to 10 (‘very likely’). If the keypad
was pressed more than once it would register the last
input, allowing participants to change their answer dur-
ing the room discussion. The voting was displayed in real
time on the room monitors to allow participants to be
influenced by consensus. Each question closed with a 5-s
countdown.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis was performed to summarize partici-
pants’ demographics and surgical experience. For the cases
in Round 1, if 75% or more of participants agreed on one
answer, the steering group defined this as a consensus, a
level defined from a recent systematic review [28]. In
Round 2, scenarios were explored for the influence of the
psychological and personality profiling on the next deci-
sion to anastomose using Spearman’s rho and comparison
across decision-making scenarios using repeated measure
ANOVAs. One-sample t-tests were used to compare the
surgeons’ means on personality variables compared with
normative data. All tests were two-tailed and performed
using SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM Corp. Released
2013, Version 24.0. Armonk, New York, USA).
Results
The demographics and surgical experience of the 50
participants are displayed in Table 2.
Round 1: psychological and personality questionnaires
Alexithymia
The surgeons scored 43.08 (SD = 8.57) on average.
Application of the cut-offs, resulted in: 82% no alex-
ithymia (n = 41); borderline 12% (n = 6) and 4% high
alexithymia (n = 2).
CRT
The mean score was 0.80 (SD = 0.78). Overall scores
were: 0, 40% (completely intuitive); 1, 41%; 2, 16% and
3, 2% (completely rational). Table 3 shows other popu-
lations for comparison.

(6.1, tone-sample(49) 5.55, P < 0.001 and 5.4, tone-sample
(49) 3.48, P = 0.001, respectively).
Correlation between psychological and personality
profiling found that those high in openness (open to
new experiences, creative) were less likely to be rational,
system 2 thinkers on the CRT (q = �0.42, P = 0.002)
and those who scored higher in alexithymia were likely
to be less agreeable (sympathetic, warm) (q = �0.49,
P = 0.001).
Round 1: case presentations
Consensus was achieved in cases 1, 2 and 4 with partici-
pants giving consideration to the patient’s wishes, but
ultimately choosing the safest option for each patient
(Table 5).
Consensus was not reached in cases 3, 5 and 6, pri-
marily because many clinical variables were presented
creating room for differential weighing of factors by dif-
ferent surgeons. However, there were themes that may
be drawn. In case 3, with variables including emergency
procedure, localized abscess, high vessel ligation and
obesity, few colorectal surgeons would consider a pri-
mary anastomosis alone, with 80% of participants creat-
ing a stoma. Case 5 is a comparable elective equivalent
of case 3, with just intra-operative details provided.
Here, few surgeons would perform an end-colostomy
(4%). The last case focused completely on the influence
of the surgeon with few patient details provided. The
influence of previous anastomotic leaks almost equally
divided the participants, between primary anastomosis
alone and anastomosis with defunctioning ileostomy.
Round 2: clinical scenarios and interactive Delphi

in scenarios 5 and 7 (Figs. 1–7). To explore the

Case description
1
An 85-year-old woman has a confirmed mid rectal cancer (T3a N0) on MRI. She has a past medical history of
ischaemic heart disease, coronary stent insertion 7 years ago and osteoarthritis affecting her hands. She is supported
by her family in wishing to have surgical resection but has expressed a wish not to have a stoma. She is concerned
that a stoma will have a severe impact on her independence, which is important to her
2
A 31-year-old woman with learning disabilities undergoes an emergency laparotomy for recurrent sigmoid volvulus
that could not be decompressed endoscopically. She was judged as lacking the capacity to consent and treatment was
initiated in her best interests with the agreement of a colleague and next of kin. There is minimal physiological
compromise and the bowel appears healthy, albeit chronically dilated. The patient’s family and carers expressed
concern preoperatively that a stoma would lead to significant behavioural problems and greater dependence
3
An obese 64-year-old male undergoes an emergency distal sigmoid resection for suspected perforated cancer within a
diverticular segment with a localized abscess present. Ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery is undertaken at
origin, given the concern about malignancy. The abdominal wall adiposity is such that full splenic flexure
mobilization is required to deliver a stoma to the skin surface. His only other comorbidities are hypertension and
gout.
4
A 49-year-old man has undergone long-course chemo-radiotherapy for a rectal tumour residing 8 cm from the anal
verge with a threatened circumferential resection margin. He is otherwise fit and well. He works as a manual
labourer on sites with restricted toilet facilities and is concerned about the social stigma of a stoma among fellow
workers. He also has limited sick leave. The operation is generally ‘oozy’ and total blood loss is 700 ml.
5
An elective resection for chronic diverticular disease in a 53-year-old woman is planned. At operation, the sigmoid
colon is thickened and adherent to the bladder, with a loop stuck on to the upper rectum in the pelvis. Following a
difficult mobilization, the offending segment is resected, with the distal resection margin at the upper rectum, below
the pelvic brim. The remaining rectum seems mildly thickened but this is thought to be reactive. There is no
evidence of a fistula into the bladder on pressure testing or on preoperative imaging.
6
A 61 year-old healthy woman with a screen-detected upper rectal cancer is undergoing elective anterior resection.
The total mesorectal excision is relatively uneventful. You carry out the highest number of rectal cancer resections in
your department with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates over the past few years. By chance, two patients
under your care with anastomotic leaks were discussed at last week’s audit meeting. One patient had been salvaged
during a protracted hospital stay and the other had been defunctioned but had required drainage of a pelvic abscess.
Consultant outcome publication is due to be published in a fortnight and you are already aware that your mortality
is the highest in your department, and higher than the national average, although within confidence intervals. The
procedure is uneventful but the anastomosis will be low.

ear trend (F(1, 46) 114.0, P = 0.000, e2P = 0.71) The
trend across scenarios is shown in Fig. 8 with the likeli-
hood of the next anastomotic decision being signifi-
cantly less influenced by scenario 5 (high-risk patient
who you will personally review every day) and scenario
7 (patient or their partner is a medical malpractice solic-
itor) compared with scenarios 1, 2 and 3 which were
greatly influenced (no anastomotic leak for over a year;
recent criticism of an anastomotic leak at departmental
audit meeting; and recent death of a patient who had
an anastomotic leak, respectively).
In relation to personality, there were significant asso-
ciations between personality and the surgeons’ self-
reported decision to anastomose or not. For scenario 1
(no anastomotic leak for over a year) those surgeons
who scored high in openness were more likely to say
they would be influenced in their decision (q = 0.30,
P = 0.039). For scenario 3 (recent criticism of an anas-
tomotic leak at departmental audit meeting) those par-
ticipants high in conscientiousness were less likely to say
this was an influence on the decision about their next
anastomosis (q = �0.44, P = 0.0003). For scenario 6
(operating with an anaesthetist who is not your regular
one) those high in alexithymia (q = 0.30, P = 0.041),
those with a more rational thinking style (q = 0.32,
P = 0.025) and those lower on openness (q = �0.31,
P = 0.028) were more likely to state their next anasto-
motic decision would be influenced.
Discussion
This is the first study to explore the influence of person-
ality on the heuristics of colorectal surgeons. Surgeons
reported traits that appear favourable to their chosen
speciality: thinking processes that are predominately
intuitive, low levels of alexithymia and high levels of
conscientiousness and emotional stability. Consensus in
the decision to anastomose in rectal surgery was evident
in some case presentations and clinical scenarios, but
not in those with increasing complexity. When this vari-
ation in practice was explored, the personality of the
individual surgeon was found to be a potentially influ-
encing factor.

The higher levels of conscientiousness and emotional
stability
reported
in
this
group
of
surgeons
alongside low alexithymia challenge the perceived ‘sur-
gical personality’ stereotype of arrogance, impatience,
extraversion and being unfriendly and distant [30]. This
stereotype was also challenged in a recently published
personality survey on nearly 600 surgeons of all speciali-
ties [31]. High levels of conscientiousness and emo-
tional stability would appear to be desirable traits in
colorectal surgeons, with the former being associated

Personality influences decision-making
 with academic achievement, precision, organizational
skills and efficiency whilst the latter reflects the individ-
ual’s ability to remain calm under pressure and not dis-
play extremes of emotion that is commonly associated
with being a leader [32,33]. In addition, the low levels
of alexithymia reported in this group of colorectal sur-
geons compare favourably with higher levels reported in
two large European population studies (4% vs 10% and
13%), which is clinically relevant as empathy has been
shown to correlate with improved patient compliance
and satisfaction [34–37].
The decision to anastomose or not in rectal surgery
is multifactorial with no ‘right’ answer for all patients,
which is reflected in this study where agreement was
found in just half of the case presentations, with increas-
ing case complexity
producing greater variation in
responses. With 88% of participants working in the UK,
these results support the variation in anastomotic prac-
tice that is known to exist in the UK [9]. To further
analyse this variation in practice, the clinical scenarios
were developed to explore the response of individual
surgeons to commonly encountered situations. Being
the only surgeon in the unit whilst colleagues are away
or operating on a medical malpractice solicitor or his or
her relative were strongly reported as not influencing
the next anastomotic decision. However, the remaining
scenarios did influence the next anastomotic decision,
including and perhaps reassuringly, a recent fatal anasto-
motic leak and recent criticism at one’s unit departmen-
tal audit meeting about a leaked anastomosis.
In relation to the influence of personality, three sce-
narios appeared to be influenced. In the first the sur-
geon was working with a relatively unknown and
untested anaesthetist where the last two patients had
died of an anastomotic leak. There was no comment on
the competency of the anaesthetist in this question,
allowing focus on the surgeon’s interpretation of why
the anastomotic leaks had occurred. If the surgeon’s
personality was high in alexithymia, high in slow,
rational process thinking or less open then their anasto-
motic decision was likely to be influenced in this sce-
nario. Interestingly, these three influencing personality
traits share a lesser or slower ability to learn from mis-
takes or losses [38].
In the second scenario, surgeons high in openness
were more likely to let a recent good spell of no anasto-
motic leaks for over a year influence their next anasto-
motic decision. Openness is associated with engaging

 with new ideas, intellectual curiosity and, as a result,
nontraditional ideas including superstition [39]. Many
of the participating surgeons will know their individual
yearly anastomotic leak rate from national audits [9] so
logically this statistic should not influence individual
cases, but these results tentatively suggest that it does,
perhaps as a result of the individual surgeon’s personal-
ity.
The last scenario to be influenced was where the sur-
geon had received recent criticism at his or her unit
departmental audit meeting about a leaked anastomosis.
Overall colorectal surgeons reported this scenario as
influencing their next anastomotic decision, but greater
influence was reported in those with higher levels of
conscientiousness, perhaps reflecting that these surgeons
value their colleagues’ opinions and are more prepared
to listen and reflect to improve their performance.
These early results suggest that the surgeon’s person-
ality influences the heuristics of rectal anastomosis
beyond the established patient and operative factors,
but with only a small sample size definitive conclusions
are limited. However, if future work with larger number
of participants supports these findings, then the next
step would be to link heuristics and personality to indi-
vidual surgeons’ outcomes, such as: number of rectal
cancer cases a year, stoma formation (and type) rate and
anastomotic leak rate. The identification of such traits
may provide an opportunity to develop personality/be-
haviour-modifying interventions to minimize variation
in practice, especially as recent work in personality the-
ory has found that traits are not fixed, but instead
change throughout an individual’s life. This can be in
response to one’s environment (work, university, per-
sonal life), training (including surgical programmes)
and/or targeted therapeutic and psychological interven-
tions [40–46]. It is important to highlight that any of
these therapeutic or psychological interventions would
not seek to remove a personality trait but modify it
instead as there is no such thing as a ‘good’ or ‘bad’
personality trait as within each one there exists a
‘bright-side’
and
a
‘dark-side’
depending
on
the
demands of the situation or context [44]. As an exam-
ple, anxiety (emotional stability) at high levels is a bene-
ficial response to immediate danger, but these same
levels also impede optimal physical performance as
widely accepted and addressed by sport psychologists
(the inverted-U hypothesis) [45].
An alternative strategy could be the development of
‘matched’ operators where two surgeons with differing
personalities are teamed up to provide optimal heuris-
tics. This matching could be started preoperatively,
increasing the patient’s opportunity for shared decision-
making,
and
intra-operatively
to
maximize
the
attainment of the optimal outcome as defined by each
individual patient. For example some patients may wish
to avoid a defunctioning stoma whilst others may wish
to avoid long-term functional control problems and
request a permanent end-colostomy.
The steering group acknowledge the limitations of
this work. First, this work represents a self-reporting
theoretical exercise where surgeons may be reluctant to
comment openly or anonymously (via voting) for fear
of criticism and/or they may lack insight into a discrep-
ancy between what they think they do surgically and
what they actually do. This could be explored by linking
personality and heuristics to the outcomes for each indi-
vidual surgeon. Second, it is possible that the results
may not be generalizable to all UK colorectal surgeons
as only a small pool of UK surgeons participated and as
they volunteered, selection bias cannot be excluded.
Conclusion
Consensus on when to anastomose, defunction or form
an end-colostomy in rectal surgery can be difficult to
achieve, especially in complex cases. Colorectal surgeons
have speciality-relevant personality traits, and when a
consensus is not achieved variations in these traits may
have an influence on the anastomotic decision, poten-
tially explaining the variation in anastomotic practice
across the UK.
