Abstract
Background & aims
Musculoskeletal pain, the most common cause of disability globally, is most frequently man-
aged in primary care. People with musculoskeletal pain in different body regions share simi-
lar characteristics, prognosis, and may respond to similar treatments. This overview aims to
summarise current best evidence on currently available treatment options for the five most
common musculoskeletal pain presentations (back, neck, shoulder, knee and multi-site
pain) in primary care.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted. Initial searches identified clinical guidelines, clinical
pathways and systematic reviews. Additional searches found recently published trials and
those addressing gaps in the evidence base. Data on study populations, interventions, and
outcomes of intervention on pain and function were extracted. Quality of systematic reviews
was assessed using AMSTAR, and strength of evidence rated using a modified GRADE
approach.
Results
Moderate to strong evidence suggests that exercise therapy and psychosocial interventions
are effective for relieving pain and improving function for musculoskeletal pain. NSAIDs and
opioids reduce pain in the short-term, but the effect size is modest and the potential for
adverse effects need careful consideration. Corticosteroid injections were found to be bene-
ficial for short-term pain relief among patients with knee and shoulder pain. However, cur-
rent evidence remains equivocal on optimal dose, intensity and frequency, or mode of
application for most treatment options.

 Conclusion
This review presents a comprehensive summary and critical assessment of current evi-
dence for the treatment of pain presentations in primary care. The evidence synthesis of
interventions for common musculoskeletal pain presentations shows moderate-strong evi-
dence for exercise therapy and psychosocial interventions, with short-term benefits only
from pharmacological treatments. Future research into optimal dose and application of the
most promising treatments is needed.
Introduction
Pain as a result of musculoskeletal problems of the back, neck, shoulder, knee and multi-site
pain is an increasing cause of diminished quality of life, and increased demands on healthcare
[1–3]. Prognosis is often poor with many people reporting persistent symptoms 6 to 12 months
after consulting their primary care practitioner [4, 5]. Furthermore, the likelihood of persistent
or recurrent clinical symptoms may accentuate the physical, psychological, and socio-eco-
nomic impacts of musculoskeletal pain.
Musculoskeletal pain is managed by a plethora of treatment options, most delivered in pri-
mary care by first contact clinicians such as general practitioners, physiotherapists, chiroprac-
tors and osteopaths. These include non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. self-management
advice and education, exercise therapy, manual therapy and psychosocial interventions), com-
plementary therapies (e.g. acupuncture), and pharmacological interventions (e.g. analgesics,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections). For those with
refractory symptoms, surgical interventions (e.g. arthroscopic debridement, total knee replace-
ments, and laminectomies) may be considered. However, for the overarching aim of reducing
pain and improving function, recommendations are equivocal in respect to the effectiveness of
various treatment options that are used across a range of common musculoskeletal pain pre-
sentations. For example, evidence for the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for relief of
shoulder or knee pain is inconsistent [6, 7]. Similarly, the efficacy and safety of simple analge-
sics and NSAIDs for reducing symptoms associated with osteoarthritis and back pain is uncer-
tain [8–11]. In order to provide optimal care to patients with musculoskeletal pain and ensure
the efficient use of healthcare resources, a comprehensive overview of the available evidence
for the most effective treatment options for musculoskeletal pain presentations is essential.
Evidence from trials and systematic reviews indicate that most treatments for musculoskel-
etal pain provide small to moderate short-term benefits, with a lack of evidence for long-term
effectiveness [12]. Also, there appears to be a wide heterogeneity in the response of patient
symptoms to treatments, suggesting that some patients may benefit more from some treat-
ments than others [12]. Due to an apparent lack of information on the comparative effective-
ness of available treatment options, there is a need to summarise current evidence regarding
the best treatments for musculoskeletal pain presentations.
Previous reviews and guidelines that describe the effectiveness of treatments for musculo-
skeletal pain specifically focus on single regional pain sites, such as shoulder pain [13, 14],
knee pain [15, 16] or low back pain [17–20]. However, research evidence suggests that in the
general population and those presenting to primary care, localised musculoskeletal pain fre-
quently coexists in more than one body region [21, 22] and that those with different regional
pains share similar underlying attributes, course of symptoms and prognostic factors [23, 24].
Nevertheless, for many patients, clinical decision-making regarding treatment is often

 focussed on the specific body region without much recourse to the potential influence of prog-
nostic factors or other co-existing pain problems. As a result, informed choices about which
treatment might work best for which individual also remain a substantial clinical challenge. A
more holistic view is perhaps difficult to obtain since trials and systematic reviews usually
focus on a specific musculoskeletal pain site, comparing only two or three treatment options.
To our knowledge there are no published reviews in which evidence regarding the compara-
tive effectiveness of a wide range of treatments is systematically synthesised for the most com-
mon musculoskeletal pain presentations.
The aim of this study was to critically appraise current best evidence regarding the effective-
ness of treatments to reduce pain and /or improve function for people with the five most com-
mon musculoskeletal pain presentations in primary care (i.e., back, neck, shoulder, knee and
multi-site pain as indicated by Jordan et al.[25]). The specific objectives of this review were to:
1. identify effective treatment options for the five most common musculoskeletal pain presen-
tations and
2. highlight gaps in evidence and priorities for policy or future research.
The review also identified, where available, evidence regarding patient subgroups most
likely to respond to different treatment options.
Methods
Sources of data and search strategy
Integrated information from higher levels of evidence has been suggested as an “ideal source
of evidence for clinical decision-making” by the Evidence Based Practice group (http://hsl.
mcmaster.libguides.com/ebm). Therefore, using national clinical guidelines, policy docu-
ments, care pathways such as Map of Medicine (MoM), and clinical evidence summaries as a
starting point, the search for evidence for this overview followed a pyramidal tract through a
hierarchy of available evidence. Sources of evidence for the overview included: Clinical Knowl-
edge Summaries, Map of Medicine, TRIP Database (systematic reviews and clinical guide-
lines), the Cochrane Library (including Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Database
of abstracts of reviews of effects, Health technology assessment database), MEDLINE and
EMBASE (using specific search filters to retrieve systematic reviews and clinical guidelines),
reference lists of included systematic reviews and guidelines, research stakeholders and experts
in the field of musculoskeletal research. Evidence sources were initially accessed in January
2014 and regularly checked for new updates at eight week intervals through to March 2015
whilst the review was ongoing. A Cochrane library search update was conducted in February
and August 2016 in order to identify newly published Cochrane reviews.
All Cochrane reviews matching the inclusion criteria were included in the synthesis.
Relevant non-Cochrane systematic reviews were added where there were no (up-to-date)
Cochrane reviews summarising the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Additional searches
of the bibliographic databases, MEDLINE and EMBASE (using narrow or specific search
filters to retrieve systematic reviews and clinical guidelines) were carried out to identify
and retrieve (1) relevant systematic reviews, and (2) more recently published relevant RCTs
that had not yet been summarised in reviews or guidelines or where evidence gaps clearly
existed. For the bibliographic database searches, retrieved search results were limited to pub-
lished articles from 2000 until December 2014 initially, and then updated in August 2016.
The search strategy and search terms for these additional searches are profiled in supplemen-
tary S1 File.

 Relevant publications (guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs as well as
recent RCTs which are yet to be summarised in reviews) were obtained and assessed against
predefined eligibility criteria according to the study protocol by two reviewers.
Inclusion criteria.
• Study populations: Reviews/studies of adults (18 years and over) presenting with at least
one of the five most common musculoskeletal pain presentations: back, neck, shoulder, knee
and multi-site pain (the latter defined as musculoskeletal pain in more than one area of the
body).
• Type of treatments: Reviews/studies of currently available treatments (including self-manage-
ment advice and education, exercise therapy, manual therapy, pharmacological interventions
(oral and topical analgesics, local injections), aids and devices, and other treatments (ultra-
sound, TENS, laser, acupuncture, ice / hot packs)) for musculoskeletal pain patients consult-
ing in primary care were considered. Referral options for psychosocial interventions (such as
cognitive-behavioural therapy and pain-coping skills) and surgery were also included. Com-
parison groups could include usual care, no intervention or other active interventions.
• Outcomes: Reviews/studies had to report outcomes of pain (e.g. intensity, widespreadness,
bothersomeness, number of episodes, duration), and/or functional disability. These were
considered primary outcomes for this review. Secondary outcomes such as psychological
well-being / depression, catastrophising, quality of life (QOL), work related outcomes (e.g.
sickness absence, return to work, days off work), and cost of treatment were highlighted, but
were not required for inclusion in the review.
Exclusion criteria.
• Narrative reviews, letters, editorials, commentaries, and meeting abstracts were excluded, as
were biomechanical, laboratory studies, animal studies as well as previous RCTs that were
already summarised in included reviews, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
• Reviews/studies published in other languages than English.
• Reviews/studies of musculoskeletal pain populations with suspected serious pathologies (e.g.
suspected fracture, cancer, cauda equina syndrome), inflammatory arthritis, crystal disease,
spondyloarthropathy, polymyalgia rheumatica, whiplash injuries, pregnancy-related pain
problems, and vulnerable patients (e.g. experienced significant recent trauma, cognitive
impairment, dementia, terminal illness).
Quality appraisal
In order to weigh the conclusion of reviews within our evidence summaries, the methodologi-
cal quality of non-Cochrane systematic reviews was assessed using the 11-item ‘assessment of
multiple systematic reviews’ (AMSTAR) checklist [26]. The guidelines and care pathways
which were included in this evidence synthesis were not quality assessed as they all made use
of published development processes based on explicit methodology.
Extraction of data
Data were extracted by one reviewer using a data collection form and independently checked
for consistency and completeness by a second reviewer. Clarifications were sought where
needed and disagreements between reviewers resolved by discussion. Data were extracted on

 the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical treatments for each
musculoskeletal pain presentation separately, and where available, guidance or conclusions
regarding patient subgroups mostly likely to respond to specific treatments. More specifically,
data were extracted regarding:
• population characteristics (e.g. age, gender, symptom duration, musculoskeletal pain site
and where possible musculoskeletal pain condition/diagnoses,
• treatments (type/intensity/dosage),
• primary and secondary outcome measures (as stated above),
• estimates of treatment effect (where pooled, and as presented in the systematic reviews),
• estimates of treatment effect for patient subgroups (where available),
• treatment setting (e.g. primary care), and
• sources of evidence.
Treatments were assessed for short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (greater than 6
months) effectiveness based on the primary outcomes of pain and function.
Grading of evidence
Summaries of the overall evidence for the effectiveness of treatment options and strength of
recommendations for each pain site were assessed based on (a modified) GRADE rating
(http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). Summary evidence from all included reviews and
guidelines were graded, taking into account the:
• Primary sources of data (e.g. guidelines, systematic reviews, RCTs): expert opinion or con-
sensus in guidelines was rated as very weak evidence, while RCTs, systematic reviews and
evidence-based guidelines were graded as higher level of evidence
• Quality of systematic reviews (Cochrane reviews or high methodological quality as assessed
by AMSTAR checklist)
• Magnitude of effect where a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.2 was considered
small, 0.5 as medium, and 0.8 as large according to Cohen [27], and for binary outcomes suc-
cess rate, relative risk (RR) >2 was considered a medium to large effect size [28]
• Level of precision (confidence interval and level of significance; p<0.05)
• The consistency of results across systematic reviews or RCTs.
For each treatment option, evidence was graded as:
1. “Very weak evidence”—based solely on expert opinion or consensus in guidelines only or
in the absence of systematic review evidence
2. “Limited evidence”—in the presence of little evidence from systematic reviews/evidence-
based guidelines AND when there were small, inconsistent, or non-significant treatment
effect sizes
3. “Moderate evidence”–in the presence of little evidence from systematic reviews/evidence-
based guidelines (as in 2) but showing a medium to large treatment effect OR in the pres-
ence of strong evidence from high quality systematic reviews, but with small or inconsistent
treatment effect sizes

 4. “Strong evidence”—in the presence of strong evidence from high quality systematic reviews
and evidence-based clinical guidelines AND medium or large effect sizes.
Each summary of evidence / analysis was graded using the adapted GRADE criteria as
described above and a narrative synthesis was subsequently presented, indicating the strength
of the evidence as very weak, limited, moderate, or strong.
Evidence synthesis
A narrative synthesis approach was undertaken. Given expected heterogeneity of sources of
evidence, treatment settings, and the wide remit of this review (which covered currently avail-
able treatments in primary care and referral options for one or more musculoskeletal pain
presentation), the evidence was summarised at a high level (using systematic reviews and
guidelines where available), and therefore no new meta-analyses were conducted. However,
pooled estimates of treatment effectiveness from systematic reviews, as well as comments on
the consistency and magnitude of treatment effects were extracted and reported. Additional
information from policy documents and guidelines on treatment recommendations and prior-
ities, including the type of evidence from which it was generated (i.e. whether from RCTs, sys-
tematic reviews or expert opinion) was also noted. The gathered evidence was included in
summary tables (S1–S7 Tables) to enable (indirect) comparisons to be made across pain sites
for the various treatments. Gaps in the evidence were noted where no guidelines, systematic
reviews or RCTs were found.
Results
Search results
A total of 3,588 unique citations (including Cochrane reviews) were retrieved from the elec-
tronic bibliographic databases. On assessing titles, abstracts and full texts against the inclusion
criteria, 71 Cochrane systematic reviews met the selection criteria and were included. Non-
Cochrane systematic reviews (n = 75) were only included where a gap not already covered by
Cochrane reviews was identified, or if they represented new research that had not yet been
considered within updated guidelines and care pathways. The remaining papers were excluded
because they were not a systematic review (n = 798), focused on an area already covered by
one of the included Cochrane systematic reviews (n = 234), were duplicate publications or did
not fit the inclusion criteria (n = 2131). A summary of the review process outlining the selec-
tion of evidence is presented in Fig 1.
Quality appraisal
As Cochrane reviews followed a generic protocol specifying methods and review protocols
go through a comprehensive peer review process prior to publication, the methodological
quality of most Cochrane reviews included in this evidence synthesis was satisfactory (Fig 2).
Cochrane reviews had flaws mainly associated with lack of searches for grey literature and/or
no formal assessment of publication bias (Fig 2). As shown in Fig 3, methodological quality
was less strong for non-Cochrane reviews, especially in terms of the comprehensiveness of the
search strategy (including searches for grey literature), and listing of excluded studies (10%).
Most reviews (81%) carried out some form of quality appraisal of included studies but study
quality was not always incorporated into the evidence synthesis nor appropriately used to for-
mulate conclusions (68%). Over half of the reviews (� 65%) minimised the risks of reviewer
error and bias via duplicate processes for study selection and data extraction; and a very low
proportion of reviews (16%) assessed the likelihood of publication bias.

 Included reviews and guidelines
Our searches identified reviews, guidelines and care pathways that covered a large range of
treatment options for each musculoskeletal pain presentation. Based on specific review ques-
tions, authors of each review used particular criteria for identifying relevant trials in terms of
setting, participants and interventions, resulting in variation across reviews in terms of the
musculoskeletal condition, type and number of trials included, interventions, and reported
outcomes of the reviews. A detailed description of the settings, populations, treatments and
outcomes is provided in S1–S7 Tables. Each of the pain presentations (back, neck, shoulder,
knee, multi-site pain) include several diagnostic categories, which are also summarised in the
supplementary evidence tables.
Evidence synthesis
Effectiveness of available treatments for musculoskeletal pain was highlighted in the following
order: self-management advice and education, exercise therapy, manual therapy, pharmacological

 interventions, aids and devices, other treatments (including ultrasound, TENS, laser, acupunc-
ture, ice / hot packs), psychosocial interventions and surgery. A summary of the findings is
presented in Table 1. The overall grade of evidence from included reviews and guidelines on
effectiveness of treatment options was fairly consistent for each of the five musculoskeletal pain
presentations. For instance, the strength of evidence in support of the beneficial effects of exercise
therapy for all the five musculoskeletal pain sites ranged between moderate and strong whilst
there was generally limited evidence for low to medium effectiveness of manual therapy across
the pain sites. There was wide variability in terms of the application and mode of delivery of even
the same treatments. Within guidelines, there was little evidence regarding specific patient sub-
groups and predictors of response to treatments. However, any information extracted, regarding
patient subgroups most likely to respond to specific treatment options is summarised in the evi-
dence tables (S1–S7 Tables).
Self-management advice and education.
Evidence base: Evidence was extracted from
two clinical guidelines, one clinical pathway and eight reviews about the effectiveness of self-
management advice and education. As assessed by AMSTAR, the methodological quality of
systematic reviews was moderate or high but the primary studies within those reviews were
generally low or moderate in quality. Given mostly in the form of oral and / or written infor-
mation, advice and education was directed at improving patients’ understanding of their
musculoskeletal pain, and self-management techniques, addressing patients’ concerns about

 serious causes and outcomes, supporting return to function, and minimising dependence on
healthcare providers [20, 29–38].
Magnitude of effects: Self-management advice and education was typically provided to
either individuals or patient groups, as part of an intervention programme and were not
tested in isolation against a control treatment (S1 Table). Therefore, the evidence for the effec-
tiveness of self-management advice and education alone on the outcomes of pain and function
was difficult to assess. Where estimated, summary effect sizes were usually small and/or not
statistically or clinically significant. For instance, for back pain patients who received self-man-
agement advice, Oliveira et al [37] reported a pooled Mean Difference (MD) at short-term (up
to 3 months) follow-up for pain of -3.2 points on a 0–100 scale (95% CI, -5.1 to -1.3) and of
-2.3 points (95% CI, -3.7 to -1.0) for function. There was no evidence regarding patient sub-
groups most likely to respond to self-management advice and education.
Strength of evidence: The evidence for self-management advice and education supporting
expert opinion in clinical guidelines and consensus meetings as well as systematic reviews
showed small effects on pain and function. Pooled results from meta-analyses tended to have
wide confidence intervals although recommendations for the use of advice and education were
consistent. Overall strength of evidence was graded as limited.
Bottom line: Despite the limited evidence-base, there were strong recommendations for the
use of self-management advice and education as a first line treatment option for musculoskele-
tal pain.

 Exercise therapy.
Evidence base: Synthesized evidence for the effectiveness of exercise on
musculoskeletal pain included 10 Cochrane reviews [13, 18, 39–46], four guidelines [16, 20,
29, 47] and three policy documents [38, 48, 49]. Evidence from other reviews (n = 22), [36, 50–
71] and one additional trial [72] were also considered. Quality of reviews ranged from moder-
ate to high.
Magnitude of effects: Exercise therapy was determined to be beneficial for pain, function
and quality of life in all five pain presentations [13, 16, 18, 20, 29, 36, 38, 47, 55, 56, 58–60, 63].
See supplementary S2 Table. Reviews and guidelines on exercise for neck pain [38, 58, 66] gen-
erally found exercises to be beneficial for function but no pooled estimates were provided.
Exercise therapy led to clinically significant improvements in pain, function and quality of life
for shoulder, knee, back and multi-site pain. In addition, medium to large summary effect
sizes were reported in favour of exercise across the body of evidence, for example; RR 7.74; CI,
1.97 to 30.32 and RR 1.53; CI, 0.98 to 2.39 for improvement of shoulder pain and function
respectively [13]; MD -1.46, CI -2.39 to -0.54 on a scale of 0 to 10) for pain as well as function
(SMD 1.10, 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.63) for knee pain [46]; and MD 7.3 (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.9 points on
a scale of 0–100) for low back pain [18]. With respect to multi-site pain[41], aerobic exercises
was found to lead to improvement in global well-being (SMD 0.49, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.75), phys-
ical function (SMD 0.66, 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.92) and pain (SMD 0.65, 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.39).
There appears to be little empirical evidence in favour of any particular exercise type, pro-
gramme or mode of delivery, either as structured individual or group treatment for musculo-
skeletal pain [18, 39, 41, 48–50, 57, 65, 66, 68–70, 72, 73], although functional exercises (which
adapt patients’ exercises to their activities of daily living, and enables them to perform such
activities more easily and without injuries) appear to be more beneficial than exercises not spe-
cifically targeting function. There was no evidence regarding patient subgroups most likely to
respond to exercise therapy. While some contributing reviews included information on
whether patient symptoms were acute and chronic, it was difficult to assess if any particular
exercise therapy had better effects on acute or chronic symptoms.

 Strength of evidence: On the basis of medium to large summary effects sizes from high
quality reviews, and clinical guidelines, the strength of evidence for the effectiveness of exercise
therapy for pain, function, and quality of life for patients with musculoskeletal pain, was
graded as strong.
Bottom line: Current evidence shows significant positive effects in favour of exercise on
pain, function, quality of life and work related outcomes in the short and long-term for all the
musculoskeletal pain presentations (compared to no exercise or other control) but the evi-
dence regarding optimal content or delivery of exercise in each case is inconclusive.
Manual therapy.
Evidence base: Six Cochrane reviews [44, 45, 74–77], three guidelines
[20, 38, 78], and 15 other systematic reviews [54, 58, 66, 79–90] contributed to the evidence
synthesis on the effect of manual therapy for the five most common musculoskeletal pain pre-
sentations. The effects of manual therapy on pain and function were mostly examined in com-
bination with other treatments and mostly for non-acute pain. Methodological quality of
reviews was moderate or high, although as highlighted in many of the reviews, a number of the
primary trials on which reviews were based were of low quality.
Magnitude of effects: Pooled estimates for the effectiveness of manual therapy for mu-
sculoskeletal pain were generally statistically significant, but variable in terms of size of the
treatment effect S3 Table. Manipulation, mobilisation and massage (where indicated) were
reported to be beneficial for immediate and or short-term (4–6 weeks) improvement in range
of motion and function in both acute and chronic neck pain patients as well as those with
whiplash [38, 58, 66, 78, 91]. For instance, thoracic manipulation was found to lead to signifi-
cant pain reduction (number needed to treat (NNT) 7), and increased function (NNT 5) in
acute neck pain patients whilst a single session of thoracic manipulation was reported to result
in immediate pain reduction for chronic neck pain patients (NNT 5) compared to placebo
[44]. In a recent Cochrane review of manual therapy for adhesive capsulitis, 46% of partici-
pants reported treatment success with manual therapy and exercise compared with 77% who
had corticosteroid injections (summary RR 0.6, 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.83), with an absolute risk dif-
ference of 31% (13% to 48%). The number reporting adverse events did not differ (summary
RR 1.07, 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.49) between groups [45]. As with neck pain, manual therapy offers
some benefits for range of motion and function in shoulder pain presentations [54, 79, 80, 82,
83, 89].
For back pain, evidence suggests that manual therapy alone or in combination with other
treatments may offer some benefit for pain and function [20, 81, 85, 88]. Most authors pre-
sented no pooled estimates of treatment effects due to large heterogeneity among included
trials. Where presented, summary effect sizes were generally small compared to no manual
therapy or other control (e.g. SMD -0.25 (95% CI, -0.46 to -0.04 for pain and SMD -0.22, (95%
CI, -0.36 to -0.07 for function) with negative SMD indicating lower levels of pain or functional
limitation for manual therapy) in the short term [75, 76]; and (MD -0.46 (95% CI, -1.18 to 0.26
on a scale of 0 to 10) for pain in the long term [76]. Compared with other treatments (e.g. gen-
eral practitioner care, acupuncture, ultrasound, standard physiotherapy, analgesic therapy,
exercise, or back school), manual therapy appears to confer little or no clinically important ef-
fect on pain intensity, functional status, global improvement or return to work among patients
with acute, subacute or chronic back pain with or without sciatica [74–77, 92, 93]. Type and
experience of professional delivering the therapy did not show any clinically significant effect
of on musculoskeletal pain [73]. There was low quality evidence that the efficacy of manual
therapy might differ for subgroups of patients, with manual therapy tending to be more effec-
tive for acute non-specific low back pain patients with mobility deficit [90].
Strength of evidence: Despite several high quality reviews examining the effects of manual
therapy on pain and function for neck, shoulder and back pain, current evidence generally

 shows small summary effect sizes or concludes no clinical effectiveness of manual therapy
compared to sham or other active treatments. Overall strength of evidence was graded as
limited.
Bottom line: Current evidence regarding manual therapy is beset by heterogeneity across
clinical trials. Due to paucity of high quality evidence, it is uncertain if the efficacy of manual
therapy might be different for different patient subgroups or influenced by the type and experi-
ence of professional delivering the therapy. On the whole, available evidence suggests that
manual therapy may offer some beneficial effect on pain and function but it may not be supe-
rior to other non-pharmacological treatments (e.g. exercise) for patients with acute or chronic
musculoskeletal pain.
Pharmacological treatments—Analgesics (oral & topical).
Evidence base: Thirty sys-
tematic reviews of pharmacological interventions for musculoskeletal pain examined the effec-
tiveness of analgesics (opioids and non-opioids) in the short and long-term as well as in acute
and chronic pain presentations. Comparisons were against placebo [94, 95], other pharmaco-
logical agents [48, 49, 96–100], corticosteroid injections [101], and no treatment [102, 103]. A
few comparisons were made with other treatments such as laser and acupuncture [7]. Over
60% of the reviews on oral and topical analgesics were of high methodological quality while
the rest were moderate. Reviews highlighted that the quality of included primary trials ranged
from low to high quality.
Magnitude of effects: Compared to placebo, acetaminophen (paracetamol) was not more
effective (SMD 0.13, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.22) for relieving knee and back pain [94, 100, 103].
NSAIDs and opioid analgesics (especially for acute pain) were generally found to be effective
but beneficial effects were evident mostly in the short-term [7, 14, 16, 29, 38, 94, 104, 105].
Cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 selective inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib), were found to be effective for
musculoskeletal pain relief. However, these were more likely to be associated with higher risks
of adverse cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events (hazard ratio 2.18, 95% CI 1.82, 2.61),
compared to non-selective NSAIDs [48, 49]. In the long-term and for more chronic pain pre-
sentations, stepwise analgesia according to the WHO analgesic ladder (mostly based on expert
opinion) may be recommended [20, 29, 106–109]. Medium effect sizes were commonly
reported S4 Table. For instance, topical NSAIDs were found to be more beneficial compared
to placebo with summary RR of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.2) and a NNT of 4.6 (95% CI, 3.8 to 5.9)
in the short-term [98, 99, 110, 111]. Furthermore, duloxetine, commonly used for multi-site
pain may be carefully considered where there has been inadequate clinical response to initial
pharmacologic treatments [48]. The effects of analgesics for improving function were less
often reported in included reviews and guidelines.
Strength of evidence: With consistent medium summary effect sizes reported across moder-
ate to high quality systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, there is moderate evidence that
pharmacological therapies are beneficial for the short-term relief of musculoskeletal pain.
Overall strength of evidence was graded as moderate.
Bottom line: NSAIDs, Cox-2 selective inhibitors and opioids reduce pain in the short-term,
but the effect size is modest and the potential for adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleed-
ing and opioids-induced hyperalgesia need careful consideration.
Pharmacological interventions–injections.
Evidence base: The evidence base for the
effectiveness of injections for musculoskeletal pain involved the synthesis of three clinical
guidelines [16, 112, 113] and one care pathway document [38], six Cochrane reviews [104,
114–118] and 13 other systematic reviews [7, 64, 66, 101, 119–127]. The systematic reviews
were mostly high in methodological quality.
Magnitude of effects: A care pathway document [38], one guideline [49] and seven system-
atic reviews [64, 101, 116, 117, 119, 120, 125] supported evidence for the short-term (<4

 weeks) benefits of corticosteroid injections for relieving moderate to severe shoulder pain
(summary RR 1.43 (95% CI, 0.95 to 2.16) for corticosteroid injection compared with NSAIDs
[119]). Likewise for knee pain, corticosteroid injections were found to be effective in the short-
term for relieving moderate to severe pain compared to placebo ((summary RR: 3.11 (95% CI,
1.61 to 6.01); NNT 3 to 4) [115, 128]. Though corticosteroid injections were found to relieve
pain, there was a lack of evidence for clinically significant effects on function [115]. For knee
pain, viscosupplements such as intra-articular hyaluronate injections were found to be better
than placebo (SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83) for reducing pain and improving function
(SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.87) in the short term (1–4 weeks). However, high clinical and sta-
tistical heterogeneity, evidence of publication bias and low quality trials preclude definitive
recommendations about routine use in clinical practice [49].
Furthermore, the available evidence did not suggest injections are effective for the manage-
ment of neck pain [66, 113, 121–124] or back pain [38, 104, 118]. Overall, there was no strong
evidence for the use of epidural spinal injections with or without steroids, as benefits (immedi-
ate reductions in pain) were small and not sustained [114, 126, 127]. It appears the short-term
pain relief offered by epidural spinal injections are hampered by significant heterogeneity, and
that the severity and subtype of pathology may affect outcome [114, 126, 127].
Generally, in the long-term, injections may be no more effective than non-pharmacological
interventions such as exercise [7, 64, 113, 116, 117, 119, 120, 125]. Evidence also suggests that
the addition of corticosteroid injections to local anaesthetic does not confer improved symp-
tom relief in the long-term [121, 122] however, expert opinion and guideline recommenda-
tions support its use prior to, or alongside, exercise and self-management advice [38, 64, 101,
112, 113, 119]. Although injections were often offered for acute pain relief and to enable
patients to tolerate exercise therapy, there was no evidence regarding patient subgroups most
likely to respond to injections.
Strength of evidence: Supported by high quality reviews, and clinical guidelines, medium to
strong effect sizes across the various sources of evidence, injections offer clinically significant
benefits for relieving moderate to severe shoulder and knee pain but in the short-term (up to 3
months) only. Overall, the strength of evidence was graded as strong.
Bottom line: The evidence indicates that injections offer short-term pain relief for shoulder
and knee pain but effectiveness for back and neck pain is uncertain. Across the musculoskele-
tal pain presentations for which pharmacological injections may be given for pain relief, cur-
rent evidence is equivocal on the optimal procedure (e.g. guided vs. unguided), frequency,
dose and active component of the injections (though corticosteroid injections are more often
reported in literature).
Aids & devices—Orthotics, tapes, braces, cervical collars and other support devices.
Evidence base: The evidence for the effectiveness of aids and devices for pain and function
included five guidelines [16, 20, 47, 112, 129], one clinical pathway [38], four Cochrane reviews
[66, 77, 130–132], two best evidence syntheses [58, 133] and a meta-analysis [134]. The quality
of reviews was moderate.
Magnitude of effects: Either as stand-alone treatment or mostly in combination with other
treatments, aids and devices for musculoskeletal pain have generally shown small effects (see
supplementary S5 Table) on pain, function or work outcomes [16, 20, 38, 58, 66, 77, 131–133].
Routine use of collars has not been found to confer any clinically significant benefits for neck
pain [38, 58, 66, 133]. This may be attributed to marginal pain relief (in the short-term), and
inclination to induce rest and inactivity hence prolonging disability. Patellar taping has been
shown to have some beneficial effects (in the short-term) on pain and function in patients with
patellofemoral pain [16, 20, 47, 112, 129]. Warden et al.[134] reported significantly less pain
on a 100-mm scale (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -20.1, 95% CI, -26.0 to -14.3, p <

 .001) for patellofemoral pain patients treated with medially directed tape compared to patients
treated with no tape or patients treated with sham tape (WMD = -13.3, 95% CI, -18.1 to -8.4, p
< .001). There is very weak empirical evidence for the beneficial effects of knee braces but in
grade II and III collateral ligament injuries, short-term (4–6 weeks) application of a hinged
brace may be considered as part of rehabilitation [38, 47]. Empirical evidence suggests lumbar
supports are not effective for improving pain and function in back pain patients [20]. This
review did not find any evidence regarding specific patient subgroups for which aids and
devices might be most beneficial.
Strength of evidence: Supported mostly by expert opinion or consensus in guidelines as
well as small, inconsistent, or non-significant treatment summary effect sizes from systematic
reviews, overall evidence for the use of aids and devices in the management of musculoskeletal
pain is graded as limited.
Bottom line: For neck, shoulder, back and knee pain presentations, available evidence does
not justify routine use of aids and devices for effective improvement of pain, function, and / or
work outcomes.
Other treatments: Acupuncture, ultrasound, TENS, laser, ice / hot packs.
Evidence
base: Contributing evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture, therapeutic ultrasound,
TENS, laser, and superficial ice / hot packs for pain and function included five guidelines [16,
20, 47, 112, 129], one policy and one clinical pathway document [38, 48], 14 Cochrane reviews
[13, 48, 76, 135–148] and 18 systematic reviews [36, 55, 59, 149–159]. The quality of reviews
was mostly moderate with some reviews having high methodological quality. However, within
the reviews and clinical documents, there was large heterogeneity and significant publication
bias in primary studies.
Magnitude of effects: Compared to treatments such as analgesia, and exercise, these inter-
ventions have been less frequently evaluated, and the quality of RCTs is generally low. Also, for
many of these treatments (i.e., therapeutic ultrasound, laser, and superficial ice / hot packs),
reports of high clinical and methodological heterogeneity within the trials contributing to
reviews preclude statistical pooling of effect estimates. There was also no evidence regarding
specific patient subgroups which might benefit most from these treatments.
For acupuncture, available evidence from a good quality individual patient data meta-anal-
ysis suggests that acupuncture may be effective for short-term relief of back pain and knee
pain with medium summary effect sizes (SMD 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.58) and (SMD 0.42
(95% CI, 0.37 to 0.46)) respectively compared with usual care or no acupuncture [158]. How-
ever, effects on function were reported to be minimal and not maintained at longer-term fol-
low-up [20, 139, 149, 152, 158]. Similarly for neck and shoulder pain, acupuncture was only
found to be effective for short-term (immediately post-treatment and at short-term follow-up)
symptom relief (SMD -0.37 (95% CI, -0.61 to -0.12)) and (WMD 3.53 (95% CI, 0.74 to 6.32 on
a scale of 1–100)) compared to placebo [140, 148].
TENS was no more effective for reducing pain than placebo in chronic back pain [136, 141,
160, 161], neck pain [142], shoulder pain [145], knee [147] and chronic musculoskeletal pain
[144, 150]. Ultrasound and shockwave therapy do not appear to significantly improve clinical
outcomes for acute and chronic low back pain [162]. Also, for those with shoulder and/or
neck pain, evidence suggests ultrasound does not confer significant or added benefit over pla-
cebo or other treatments [47, 55, 101, 140, 153, 157]. The evidence on effectiveness of laser
therapy for shoulder pain [59, 159], or acute or chronic neck pain was inconclusive [151].
With regards to knee pain, other treatments including ultrasound, electromagnetic fields, low
level laser therapy, TENS, biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation may confer
added benefits to exercise and / or surgical treatment but empirical and clinical effect sizes are

 small and only supported by weak evidence [16, 47, 48, 112, 129, 143, 146, 147]. (Please refer
to supplementary S5 Table for more details regarding other treatments).
Strength of evidence: There was little empirical evidence for the effectiveness of other treat-
ments including ultrasound, TENS, laser, and superficial ice / hot packs. Presented summary
effect sizes and estimates were often small, inconsistent, and non-significant. Although
medium short-term effects were found for the effects of acupuncture on back and knee pain,
overall strength of evidence was graded as limited.
Bottom line: The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of most of these other treatment
options was not substantiated by strong evidence. Either as stand alone or in combination
with other treatments, the often small effect sizes as a result of these treatments for improving
musculoskeletal pain and function was mostly not clinically significant.
Psychosocial interventions.
Evidence base: Evidence base for the effectiveness of psycho-
social interventions (referred to various interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy
and pain-coping skills, used to support people for overcoming challenges and maintenance of
good health) included one guideline [20] and an overview of guidelines [163], one care path-
way [38], four Cochrane reviews [164–168] and seven systematic reviews [17, 133, 169–173].
The quality of reviews ranged from moderate to high. Due to gaps in available systematic
reviews of shoulder pain regarding psychosocial interventions, additional evidence from RCTs
[174, 175] was extracted for shoulder pain.
Magnitude of effects: Reviews of psychosocial treatments for the management of musculo-
skeletal pain included a wide range of approaches that aimed to achieve increased self-manage-
ment, behavioural and/or cognitive changes alongside biomedical management of pain S6
Table. Interventions were often multimodal and involved multidisciplinary treatment. At
long-term follow-up, medium summary effect sizes (e.g. SMD 0.23; (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.040)
compared to usual care and SMD 0.48 (95% CI, 0.93 to 0.04) compared to other active treat-
ments [172]) were reported for pain, function and/ or other psychosocial related-outcome
measures such as quality of life. With the exception of a few studies in back pain and neck
pain, where patient recruitment and outcome reporting were based on targeted groups of
patients receiving a psychosocial intervention according to baseline complexity of patients’
pain presentations [38, 164, 173], there was wide variability in the characteristics of patients
included in trials. The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the management of
shoulder, knee, and neck pain presentations was less well researched compared to those of
back pain. Psychosocial interventions in combination with other treatment options appear to
provide additional benefit for all musculoskeletal pain presentations. However, there was no
consensus on specific treatment components, providers and settings for optimal outcomes [20,
38, 163–167, 170, 172–175]. Furthermore, methodological issues regarding primary studies
reported by the systematic reviews, such as high attrition rates, incomplete outcome reporting,
mixed treatment regimens and generally low sample numbers and patient heterogeneity made
conclusions tentative.
Strength of evidence: Except for shoulder and knee pain, where the strength of evidence
was limited, current evidence for the beneficial effects of psychosocial interventions for neck,
back and multi-site pain is supported by moderate to high quality reviews, medium effect sizes
with precise confidence intervals and this is consistent across sources of evidence. Overall, the
strength of evidence was graded as moderate.
Bottom line: Available evidence suggests beneficial effects of psychosocial interventions,
particularly for patients identified as having a poor prognosis prior to treatment. Also, out-
come of psychosocial treatment appears to be influenced by other factors such as patient prog-
nosis, the healthcare professional providing treatment, the settings for treatment delivery and
the components of treatment.

 Surgery.
Evidence base: Evidence for the effectiveness of surgery for the musculoskeletal
pain presentations (excluding multi-site pain) was synthesised from one guideline and a care
pathway document [38, 47], nine Cochrane reviews [176–184] and eight systematic reviews
[66, 185–191]. Reviews were mostly high in methodological quality.
Magnitude of effects: Most guidelines specify that surgical treatments are indicated in a
small proportion of patients (as low as 8%) for neck, shoulder, back and knee pain presenta-
tions [38, 47, 181]. Within the body of synthesised evidence (supplementary S1 and S7 Tables),
the presence of serious pathology, substantial pain and disability or symptoms which are
refractory to conservative treatment were prominent indications for surgery [38, 47, 180, 191],
but the roles of such factors in determining the long-term clinical outcome of treatment was
equivocal [38, 180]. Based on clinical judgement and expert opinion, current evidence suggests
early surgical intervention may be considered on a case by case basis [38, 47]. Generally for
neck, shoulder, knee and back pain, when indicated, there is moderate evidence that surgical
intervention does provide benefits for pain, and function compared to waiting list controls or
conservative treatments including analgesia and exercise in the short-term [38, 66, 176, 178–
180, 187]. In specific cases, such as arthroscopic debridement and joint lavage of the knee,
available evidence indicates no clinically important benefit (SMD -0.11, 95% CI, to 0.42 to
0.21) for pain or function compared to control (SMD -0.10, 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.11) at three
months [182]. Available evidence suggests there are no long-term benefits of surgical proce-
dures for clinical outcomes compared with conservative treatment [177, 184–188, 190]. Nei-
ther was there strong evidence for a significant difference in favour of any particular surgical
technique for any of the pain sites [182, 183, 189, 191].
Strength of evidence: Though reviews were mostly high in methodological quality, sum-
mary effect sizes were small. Overall strength of evidence of long-term effectiveness of surgery
is limited except where directly indicated by specific serious pathology such as end-stage
degenerative knee joint disease, persistent pain and functional limitation which are refractory
to conservative treatments.
Bottom line: The effectiveness of surgery as a first line treatment option is not established in
current literature. The current evidence base is limited in terms of quantity, especially compar-
ing surgical versus conservative interventions but there is moderate evidence from guidelines,
Cochrane reviews and other systematic reviews to support short-term efficacy of surgical inter-
ventions for pain and function for specific neck, shoulder, knee and back pain presentations.
Available evidence also suggests that surgery is not superior to conservative treatment options
in the long-term.
Discussion
This review has systematically identified, synthesised and graded a large body of evidence on
the effectiveness of treatment for musculoskeletal pain presentations. For most pain presenta-
tions, non-pharmacological treatments especially exercise therapy as well as psychosocial
interventions, produced medium to large effects on pain and function, with corticosteroid
injections potentially offering short-term benefit in those with knee and shoulder pain.
NSAIDs and opioids (where appropriate) also offer short-term benefit for musculoskeletal
pain, but the potential for adverse effects need careful consideration.
The effectiveness of exercise therapy, psychosocial interventions and corticosteroid injec-
tions was consistently supported by empirical evidence of mostly medium effect sizes provided
by meta-analyses of RCTs, by guidelines, and expert opinion for musculoskeletal pain. With
regard to intensity, and modes of applications of most treatments, the amount of clinical con-
tact, the type of provider, setting, and delivery modes/techniques for effective treatment varied

 widely and, as yet, there is limited evidence to support choices regarding optimal delivery of
these treatments. Therefore, further research to investigate the optimal dose and application of
these treatment options is needed.
In this review, there was little information within the evidence base in relation to patient
subgroups most likely to respond to different treatment options. Where available, for each
treatment option, evidence regarding patient characteristics such as baseline pain severity and
function, duration of pain, and previous pain episodes have been documented S1–S7 Tables.
For most treatment options apart from manual therapy (due to low quality evidence for differ-
ential effects of manual therapy across patient subgroups), and psychosocial interventions
(where moderate evidence supports targeting patient subgroups to psychosocial intervention
according to baseline complexity), it is not certain if clinical outcomes for most treatment
options may be improved by targeting patient subgroups. Given that there are many factors
(including patient characteristics and risk of poor outcome) which may influence outcome of
treatment, it is likely that, an optimal approach to management of musculoskeletal pain may
involve strategic selection of treatments best suited for different patients. Future trials should
be designed to bridge this gap in evidence for the management of musculoskeletal pain.
It is worth noting that in many of the reviews, guidelines and trials contributing to this evi-
dence-base, individual treatments were rarely used in isolation. Therefore, the evidence for the
isolated effectiveness of treatments in some reviews was difficult to assess. For instance, self-
management advice and education was typically provided as part of intervention package
rather than tested in isolation against a control treatment. Consequently, there was little
empirical evidence about its effectiveness despite consistent support of the beneficial effects
(by expert opinion and consensus in guidelines). This could impact the quality and level of evi-
dence for the beneficial effects of otherwise promising treatments.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
As expected, given the breadth of this review there was wide heterogeneity in study popula-
tions, outcomes, and statistical methods for estimating summary effect measures in the
included systematic reviews. Interpreting findings within this overview was also complicated
by variability in both the intervention and control conditions (placebo, no treatment, active
treatments) examined within the reviews, making it difficult to summarise evidence regarding
the magnitude of treatment effects. Furthermore, in this overview, the treatments provided in
individual studies could not be described in detail; settings, exact content, intensity or dose of
interventions may have varied; many interventions may have required specialist staff (e.g.
injection, acupuncture, manual therapy, surgery) and the training and skills of providers are
likely to have varied over time and locations. Control conditions were frequently not described
in reviews and trials, and the definition of terms “routine care”, “standard care” or “no inter-
vention” may vary depending on setting and country. In the conduct of this study however,
concerted efforts were made to capture and report available contextual information when
summarizing evidence regarding treatment effectiveness.
Strengths and limitations of the review
Where possible, given the wide remit of this review, a number of steps were taken to ensure
methodological rigour. The focus was on publications providing high quality evidence or rec-
ommendations, including Cochrane and other high quality reviews, well-developed clinical
guidelines that met specific quality assurance criteria, and evidence-based multidisciplinary
care plans as outlined in care pathways. For Cochrane reviews, all reviews used protocols that
aimed to minimise bias whilst for non-Cochrane reviews, evidence of using systematic

 methods was a pre-requisite for inclusion in this study. In addition, separate structured and
systematic searches of bibliographic databases were conducted to identify additional trials not
covered in previous reviews, where gaps concerning the effectiveness of specific treatment
options were identified.
This review provides evidence summaries regarding the effectiveness of a wide range of
treatments for the five most common musculoskeletal pain presentations in primary care,
drawing together findings from a large evidence base. To facilitate this rapid evidence sum-
mary, the methodology evolved as a rapid application of systematic review methods to synthe-
sising evidence. Efforts were made to capture, appraise and synthesise the best available
evidence in a systematic yet rapid fashion. Definitive elements of typical systematic review
methods such as a comprehensive and systematic search of best available evidence, pre-speci-
fied inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality appraisal and synthesis have all been preserved.
Further strengths of this review included independent assessment of eligibility for inclusion
and data extraction for contributing reviews, data checks, appraisal of the quality of systematic
reviews, and a standardised approach to synthesising evidence.
There are several limitations to this review. First, there was no independent assessment of
the methodological quality of primary trials that were included in the reviews. As this is an
overview of current best available evidence, methodological quality assessment of included pri-
mary studies depended largely on the ratings of systematic review authors rather than our own
assessment of the details presented in the individual studies. The overview of evidence incor-
porating reviews of multiple interventions across many musculoskeletal pain conditions there-
fore may not follow strictly the process generally applied in a single systematic review of one
intervention on a single target population. However, much care has been taken to ensure that
our approaches to searching for evidence, quality appraisal and grading of available evidence,
and synthesis (as highlighted in the methods section) were as rigorous and as transparent as
possible.
In this overview, evidence on effectiveness of treatment options for musculoskeletal pain
has been presented based on pain presentations at different body regions rather than on spe-
cific clinical diagnoses given available evidence of similarity of patient characteristics, progno-
sis and clinical course of musculoskeletal pain presentations irrespective of specific clinical
diagnoses [23, 24]. However, information on the specific clinical diagnosis for which evidence
was derived is indicated in the supplementary evidence S1–S7 Tables.
Practice implications
Across health systems globally, there is wide variation in clinical management of musculoskele-
tal pain patients whereby the most effective treatment options are not consistently used, leading
to inefficient care, unnecessary costs and in some cases harm [3, 192]. In a clinical field with so
many treatment options, this summary of evidence provides patients, clinicians, managers, pol-
icy-makers, and researchers with a helpful “one stop” overview of the evidence for treatments.
In this review, despite an extensive search for evidence, there was a paucity of evidence on
treatment for those with multi-site pain. This musculoskeletal pain presentation, often man-
aged as chronic widespread pain and / or fibromyalgia has been less examined in the literature
because effectiveness of most treatment options has traditionally been compared on a pairwise
basis and according to individual regional pain presentations. However, regional pains are
known to co-exist in individual patients [84]. Patients included in most of the studies address-
ing management of single site pain are likely to have pain in other sites as well. Hence future
research needs to investigate interventions that address these multiple sites of pain, in order to
better inform clinical practice.

 The lack of information regarding patient subgroups most likely to respond to specific
treatment options, equivocal recommendations on the optimal mode of treatments, as well as
the obvious focus of treatment approaches on single pain sites rather than the individual with
multi-site musculoskeletal pain are key specific gaps in the current body of knowledge identi-
fied in this review.
Conclusions
Effective healthcare depends on high quality evidence. Best available evidence shows that
patients with musculoskeletal pain problems in primary care can be managed effectively with
non-pharmacological treatments such as self-management advice, exercise therapy, and psy-
chosocial interventions. Pharmacological interventions such as corticosteroid injections (for
knee and shoulder pain) were shown to be effective treatment options for the short-term relief
of musculoskeletal pain and may be used in addition to non-pharmacological treatments.
NSAIDs and opioids also offer short-term benefit for musculoskeletal pain, but the potential
for adverse effects must be considered. Furthermore, the optimal treatment intensity, methods
of application, amount of clinical contact, and type of provider or setting, are unclear for most
treatment options.
