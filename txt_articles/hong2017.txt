IMPORTANCE Clinicians who order unnecessary radiographic imaging may cause financial
harm to patients who have increasing levels of cost sharing. Clinician predictors of low-value
imaging are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE To characterize clinician predictors of low-value imaging for acute uncomplicated
back pain and headache, including clinicians who saw both conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multivariate logistic regression modeling of imaging
rates after acute uncomplicated back pain and headache visits as indicated by January 2010
to December 2014 commercial insurance claims and demographic data from a large US health
insurer. Participants included 100 977 clinicians (primary care physicians, specialist
physicians, and chiropractors).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Imaging after acute uncomplicated back pain and headache
visits was recorded. We identified whether the clinician’
s prior patient received imaging,
whether the clinician was an owner of imaging equipment, and the varying impact by clinician
specialty. We then used high rates of low-value back imaging as a predictor for low-value
headache imaging.
RESULTS Clinicians conducted 1 007 392 visits for 878 720 adults ages 18 to 64 years with
acute uncomplicated back pain; 52 876 primary care physicians conducted visits for 492 805
adults ages 18 to 64 years with acute uncomplicated headache; 34 190 primary care clinicians
conducted 405 721 visits for 344 991 adults ages 18 to 64 years with headache and had also
conducted at least 4 visits from patients with back pain. If a primary care physician’
s prior
patient received low-value back imaging, the patient had 1.81 higher odds of low-value
imaging (95% CI, 1.77-1.85). This practice effect was larger for chiropractors (odds ratio [OR],
2.80; 95% CI, 2.74-2.86) and specialists (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.88-3.07). For headache, a prior
low-value head image predicted 2.00 higher odds of a subsequent head imaging order (95%
CI, 1.95-2.06). Clinician ownership of imaging equipment was a consistent independent
predictor of low-value imaging (OR, 1.65-7.76) across clinician type and imaging scenario.
Primary care physicians with the highest rates of low-value back imaging also had 1.53 (95%
CI, 1.45-1.61) higher odds of ordering low-value headache imaging.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinician characteristics such as ordering low-value imaging
on a prior patient, high rates of low-value imaging in another clinical scenario, and ownership
of imaging equipment are strong predictors of low-value back and headache imaging.
Findings should inform policies that target potentially unnecessary and financially
burdensome care.

 I
n the quest to contain the rapid growth of medical spend-
ing in the United States, policy makers have focused on
clinically unnecessary, or low-value, services. Such waste-
ful care may account for up to one-third of all medical
expenditures.1 Low-value services also can uncover findings
that trigger downstream cascades of unnecessary care and
clinical harm.2
Studies3-7 have found that individual clinician practice
variation drives unnecessary care. For example, individual cli-
nician-level variation has been noted in low-value cancer care
in Medicare,7 and clinician ownership of imaging equipment
has been associated with increased overall imaging use.8-13
Clinicians cite patient demand as a major driver of unnec-
essary medical care, particularly of imaging.14-17 Patient de-
mand for services was the secondmost-cited barrier to avoid-
ing low-value care in a recent physician survey, after
malpractice concerns.18 However, commercially insured pa-
tients are now responsible for a rapidly growing proportion of
their medical expenses,19 which may reduce patient demand
for low-value services.
We examined clinician characteristics as predictors for 2
commonlow-valueservices:inappropriatebackpainandhead-
ache imaging. In the absence of certain signs or symptoms in-
dicating a serious underlying cause—such as neurologic prob-
lems, history of cancer, or unexplained fever—radiograph,
computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) imaging within the first 6 weeks of acute uncompli-
cated back pain adds little to no clinical value.20 Similarly, for
headache without neurologic symptoms or signs of a serious
underlying cause—such as trauma or history of cancer—CT or
MRI imaging are not recommended.21
Methods
The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care institutional review board ap-
proved the research protocol.
Data Source
We used deidentified Optum data (OptumInsight), a medical
claims data set from a large commercial health insurer. It in-
cludes enrollment and demographic information for nearly 29
millioncommerciallyinsuredmembersacrossall50statesfrom
January 2010 to December 2014.
Patient Characteristics
Member demographic characteristics included sex and age.
From 2000 US census member block group data and a sur-
name-derived ethnicity variable, we used validated ap-
proaches to generate an indicator for race/ethnicity.22 As prox-
ies for individual socioeconomic status, we classified
neighborhoods as high-poverty and low-education based on
the proportion of households below the poverty level or whose
members had lower than a high-school education.23-28
Study Outline
We examined individual clinician predictors by modeling low-
value back imaging (study sample 1) for different clinician spe-
cialties: primary care physician, chiropractor, and specialist
physician. We then examined individual clinician predictors
across clinical scenarios by modeling primary care physician
ordering behavior for low-value headache imaging (study
sample 2), and modeling how back image ordering is associ-
ated with headache image ordering (study sample 3).
Study Sample 1: Low-Value Back Imaging by Clinician Type
We identified acute uncomplicated low-back pain visits among
patients ages 18 to 64 years (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
We were guided by the clinical recommendation against in-
appropriate back pain imaging defined by Choosing Wisely, a
campaign developed by the American Board of Internal Medi-
cine Foundation and other medical specialty groups to re-
duce unnecessary care.29 We also used a well-established
claims-based algorithm for low-value back pain imaging in the
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set30 adapted
for use in the literature.31-34 The algorithm uses International
Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), codes to iden-
tify low-back pain visits and exclude high-risk diagnoses, and
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to identify ra-
diograph, CT, and MRI back images.
Clinicians who billed for visits were categorized as pri-
mary care physicians if their specialty description included in-
ternal medicine, general medicine, or family practice; other
nonradiologist, nonemergency physicians were categorized as
specialist physicians. The most common specialties (account-
ing for two-thirds of specialist visits) were orthopedic sur-
gery, neurosurgery, back and spine surgery, physical medi-
cine,andrheumatology.Chiropractorsweredefinedseparately.
Ordering Clinician | We used the vendor-generated anonymous
identifier for the billing clinician on a visit claim. We attrib-
utedorderedimagestocliniciansbyincludingonlyimagesthat
occurred within 7 days after an index visit with no interven-
ing visits to another clinician. We trimmed to exclude clini-
cians who billed for more than the 99th percentile of visits in
each scenario (62 visits for back pain, 61 visits for headache).
Clinician Ownership of Imaging Equipment | We flagged clinician
ownership of imaging equipment by identifying nonradiolo-
gist clinicians who billed for technical or global claims for any
Key Points
Question Given that information concerning geographic variation
in health care usage and higher overall radiographic imaging
among clinicians who own imaging equipment is well described, is
there evidence that ownership of imaging equipment, prior
ordering history, and ordering behavior in other clinical scenarios
are associated with low-value imaging?
Findings Clinician specialty, imaging for the prior patient,
ownership of imaging equipment, and very high rates of low-value
imaging for other clinical scenarios are strong predictors of
low-value imaging, after adjusting for patient demographics.
Meaning There are several strong clinician predictors of low-value
imaging that can guide intervention targets to improve the value
of care for patients.

Study Sample 2: Low-Value Headache Imaging
We created a second study sample to analyze low-value
headache imaging among primary care physicians. Our
claims-based definition to identify uncomplicated headache
visits (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) was similarly applied
to patients ages 18 to 64 years. We were guided by the
definition of inappropriate headache imaging as outlined
by Choosing Wisely, as well as the literature.31,33,36 We
used ICD-9 codes to identify visits and exclude high-risk
diagnoses, along with CPT codes for CT and MRI of head
images.
We required patients in both samples to be continuously
enrolled during the span used to scan for any red-flag diagno-
ses (12 months prior to the visit for back pain, 3 months prior
for headache). We also excluded inpatient and emergency de-
partment visits.

 Study Sample 3: Subset of Primary Care Physicians
Who Saw Both Back Pain and Headache Visits
After creating 2 separate samples of visits for uncomplicated
low-back pain and headache, we explored whether primary
care physicians with the highest rates of low-value back
imaging were also more likely to order low-value headache
imaging. We restricted our analysis to primary care physi-
cians who had seen both uncomplicated headache and back
pain visits. To define a high rate of low-value back imaging,
we eliminated clinicians who had seen fewer than 4 uncom-
plicated back pain visits, due to the unreliability of imaging
rates for clinicians with too few visits. We then defined high-
imaging clinicians as those with a low-value back imaging rate
at or above the 95th percentile (66.7%), and used this as an in-
dependent predictor of low-value headache imaging.
Statistical Analysis
To determine whether individual clinician practice ex-
plained a significant proportion of low-value imaging variabil-
ity, we used a nonlinear random-effects model with logit link
function to estimate the level of unexplained variation in low-
value imaging across clinicians.7,37,38 We used the clinician
identifier as the random effect and generated the logit prob-
ability of low-value imaging. From this model, we calculated
the median odds ratio of low-value imaging to quantify the be-
tween-clinician variation in the use of imaging.39
After developing this estimate of clinician-level varia-
tion, we quantified the strength of the clinician effect by de-
veloping a logistic regression model to predict low-value
imaging after a visit. Drawing from the literature,7 we re-
strictedthesampletoclinicianswhosawaconditionmorethan
once. We used the result of a clinician’
s prior encounter as a
predictor for low-value imaging in the subsequent patient with
the respective condition, excluding a clinician’
s first encoun-
ter from the sample.
The primary predictor of low-value back and headache
imaging in the first 2 samples was the clinician’
s prior patient
result. The predictors for the third sample, low-value head-
ache imaging among primary care physicians who saw both
back pain and headache patients, were the clinician’
s prior
headache patient result, and also whether the clinician was at
or above the 95th percentile for rate of low-value back imaging.
We then added clinician ownership of imaging equipment
to each of the models to report its impact on the clinician pre-
dictors and its magnitude as an independent predictor.
We also used marginal effects methods with a binary
distribution40 to adjust the imaging rate for available covari-
ates (patient age, region, sex, race, poverty level, education
level) and clinician predictors. This allowed us to compare
imaging rates across clinician subtypes.
We used SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and
Stata/SE v12.1 (StataCorp) for statistical analyses.
Sensitivity Analyses
Studysample3includedonlyprimarycarephysicianswhosaw
an uncomplicated headache visit and 4 or more uncompli-
cated back pain visits. We conducted sensitivity analyses re-
stricting the sample to clinicians who saw at least 5, 6, 7, or 8
uncomplicated back pain visits. We also reanalyzed after ad-
justing our definition of high rate of low-value back imaging
by lowering to the 90th percentile (35.7% imaging rate).
We ran additional analyses controlling for patient out-of-
pocket expenses and observed its impact on our results. See

Results
Study Sample 1: Low-Value Back Imaging
The cohort of acute uncomplicated low-back pain visits con-
sisted of 1 007 392 visits from 878 720 patients. The sample in-
cludedvisitsto57 859uniqueprimarycarephysicianswhosaw
a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 7 (4-13) acute uncompli-
cated back pain visits; 27 583 chiropractors who saw a median
(IQR) of 10 (5-19) back pain visits; and 15 535 specialist physi-
cians who saw a median (IQR) of 5 (3-9) visits. Refer to Table 1
for a full reporting of clinician and patient visit characteristics.
Inthemixed-effectsmodelwithrandomclinicianeffect,the
medianoddsratiowas2.59.Thisindicatesthat,comparedwith
another random clinician, the odds that a clinician would order
low-value imaging was 2.59 times higher if the clinician had or-
dered low-value back imaging for the prior patient.
In the multivariate logistic model (Table 2), if a primary
care physician had ordered imaging for the prior patient seen
for acute uncomplicated low-back pain, the odds of imaging
were 2.08 times higher (95% CI, 2.04-2.12) than for clinicians
who did not previously order imaging. Adjusting for clinician
ownership of imaging equipment attenuated the effect to 1.81
(95% CI, 1.77-1.85).
For chiropractors and specialists, there were varying, but
overall higher, odds of low-value back imaging if the prior pa-
tient had received imaging (chiropractors: 2.80; 95% CI, 2.74-
2.86 vs specialists: 2.98; 95% CI, 2.88-3.07). For all 3 clinician
types, ownership of imaging equipment was a significant in-
dependent predictor of low-value back imaging: primary care
physicians had 2.06 increased odds (95% CI, 2.03-2.10); chi-
ropractorshad7.76increasedodds(95%CI,7.51-8.01);andspe-
cialist physicians had 4.96 increased odds (95% CI, 4.78-
5.15). See Table 3 for predictors by clinician type.
Study Sample 2: Low-Value Headache Imaging
The cohort of acute uncomplicated headache visits consisted
of 492 804 visits from 417 010 patients. The overall imaging
rate was 7.5%. Patients were seen by 52 876 unique primary
care physicians, who saw a median (IQR) of 7 (4-13) acute un-
complicated headache visits.
In the mixed-effects model with random clinician effect,
the median odds ratio was 2.49. This indicates that, com-
pared with another random clinician, the odds that a clini-
cian would order low-value imaging was 2.49-fold higher if the
clinician had ordered low-value headache imaging for the prior
patient.

 In the multivariate logistic model (Table 2), if a clinician
had ordered imaging for the prior patient seen for uncompli-
cated headache, the odds of imaging were 2.20 higher (95%
CI, 2.13-2.25). Adjusting for clinician ownership of imaging

Study Sample 3: Whether High Rate of Back Imaging
Predicts Low-Value Headache Imaging
The 34 190 unique primary care physicians who saw patients
with both conditions of interest accounted for 405 721
headache visits from 344 991 patients. The median (IQR) num-
ber of headache visits for these clinicians was 9 (5-17). Clini-
cians actively generated claims for a median (IQR) of 7 (5-8)
quarters.
In the multivariate logistic model (Table 2), if a primary
care physician had ordered imaging for the prior patient with
a headache, the odds of head imaging were 1.91 higher (95%
CI, 1.84-1.97). Adjusting for ownership of imaging equipment
attenuated this effect to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.74-1.86), and owner-
ship of imaging equipment remained an independent predic-
tor of low-value headache imaging (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI,
1.59-1.72).
Finally, if the clinician exhibited a high rate of low-value
back imaging (≥ 66.7%), then there were 1.78 higher odds of

persisted after adjusting for ownership (1.53; 95% CI, 1.45-
1.61). See Table 4 for the impact of addition of ownership to
the model across clinical scenarios.
With a concern for collinearity between high rates of low-
value back imaging and imaging equipment ownership, we re-

imaging and the odds ratio for ownership changed mini-

creased odds of low-value back imaging for primary care phy-
sicians who ordered prior imaging translated to an adjusted
imaging rate of 20.3% (95% CI, 20.0%-20.6%) among those
who ordered prior imaging vs 12.5% (95% CI, 12.4%-12.6%)
among those who did not. The 1.53 increased odds of low-
value headache imaging for primary care physicians who had
high rates of low-value back imaging translated to an ad-
justed rate of 11.2% (95% CI, 10.7%-11.7%) among frequent im-
agers vs 7.6% (95% CI, 7.5%-7.7%) among infrequent imagers.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses using higher minimum numbers of back
pain visits (from 4 to 8 visits) to define clinicians with a high
rate of low-value back imaging did not change results. Low-
ering the threshold to define high rate of low-value back
imaging from the 95th percentile of clinicians to the 90th per-
centile led to small decreases in the magnitude of the clinician-
level predictors that do not alter our overall findings (eAppen-
dix 2 and eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Controlling for expected patient out-of-pocket expendi-
ture for imaging led to nearly imperceptible changes to our re-
sults (eAppendix 3 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Running
the models on only a patient’
s first visit or a random visit for
patients with multiple visits also did not change our conclu-
sions (eAppendix 4 and eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Among commercially insured patients, a clinician’
s prior
imaging pattern and ownership of imaging equipment were
strong independent predictors of low-value back pain and

 headache imaging. The magnitude of these associations was
greater among chiropractors and specialists. Primary care phy-
sicians who exhibited the highest rates of low-value back pain
imaging also had higher odds of ordering low-value headache
imaging.
Similar to prior studies, our findings confirm clinician-
level variation in imaging,11,41,42 specifically low-value
imaging.7 Although prior studies associated ownership of
imaging equipment with higher rates of radiological
imaging,8-13 we add the finding that such patterns persist spe-
cifically for low-value imaging and across clinician types. Delv-
ing into explanations for the different rates of low-value
imaging across these clinician types deserves further study.
Our finding that primary care physicians with very high
rates of low-value back pain imaging have increased odds of
ordering low-value headache imaging adds to the literature by
identifyingclinicianswhoordermorelow-valueimagingacross
multiple clinical scenarios. Some approaches to change clini-
cian behavior have shown promise,43-46 particularly audit-
feedback mechanisms, where clinicians receive regular feed-
back on specific performance metrics, in comparison to peers.
However, targeting each clinical scenario individually might
not address underlying drivers such as varying levels of dis-
comfort with clinical uncertainty,47,48 overestimating the ben-
efits of testing,49 group practice trends,50 and other practice-
related factors.51 It also does not directly address the pervasive
fear of malpractice. Other interventions are needed to im-
prove communication between patients and clinicians, and to
help both sides deal with uncertainty in clinical decision
making.
Addressing ownership, previous legislation has limited
imagingequipmentownershipandclinicianself-referral;how-
ever, exceptions have been made for patient convenience and
evolving practice models. As a result, these laws may be less
effective than intended.8,52 Although there are payment pro-
gramsthatholdhealthcareprovidergroupsresponsibleforthe
cost of care, early evidence shows that their effectiveness at
reducing low-value care has been modest, even among self-
selected provider groups.44 Finally, ongoing consolidation of
practices and health systems may have an impact on low-
value care usage that remains underexplored.53,54
Our findings also have implications for patients. Commer-
cially insured patients have experienced large increases in cost
sharing,particularlyunderhigh-deductiblehealthplans.19Cost
sharing is promoted as a means of motivating patients to avoid
unnecessary care,55 yet it is not clear that financially moti-
vated patients are able to avoid low-value imaging.34,56 Pre-
vious research has found that patients gain little reassurance
from a negative low-value study,57 and because of increasing
patient cost sharing, low-value imaging will increasingly cause
“financial toxicity”58 to patients. Future interventions to re-
duce low-value care could attempt to convey these important
findings to patients and clinicians.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. We were unable to adjust
for potentially relevant clinician characteristics such as train-
ing, demographics, practice type, and compensation struc-
tures. Although ownership of imaging equipment captures a
very important financial incentive, we do not capture arrange-
ments where clinicians might gain financially despite not di-
rectly billing for imaging. We focused our analysis on outpa-
tient visits because clinician identifiers did not adequately
distinguishindividualcliniciansinnonoutpatientsettings,lim-
iting generalizability of our findings to other settings such as
the emergency department. Additionally, our findings apply
only to commercially insured patients. Finally, claims data
might not fully capture concerning signs or symptoms of low-
back pain and headaches, but we used standard claims-based
definitions and any misclassification is unlikely to be large
enough to change our conclusions.
Conclusions
Among commercially insured patients, strong predictors of
low-value back pain and headache imaging included a clini-
cian’
s history of ordering low-value imaging, a high rate of
imaging in another low-value clinical scenario, and clinician
ownershipofimagingequipment.Stakeholdersshouldusethis
information to design clinician-targeted interventions to re-
duce low-value care.
