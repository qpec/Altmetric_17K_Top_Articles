Abstract
The epigenetic modifier EZH2 is in the center of a repressive complex controlling differentiation of normal cells. In cancer
EZH2 has been implicated in silencing tumor suppressor genes. Its role in melanoma as well as target genes affected by
EZH2 are poorly understood. In view of this we have used an integrated systemsbiology approachto analyze 471 cases of
skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for mutations and amplifications of EZH2.
Identified changes in target genes were validated by interrogation of microarray data from melanoma cells treated with
the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. We found that EZH2 activation by mutations, gene amplification and increased transcription
occurred in about 20% of the cohort. These alterations were associated with significant hypermethylation of DNA and
significant downregulation of 11% of transcripts in patient RNASeq data. GSK126 treatment of melanoma lines
containing EZH2 activation reversed such transcriptional repression in 98 candidate target genes. Gene enrichment
analysis revealed genes associated with tumor suppression, cell differentiation, cell cycle inhibition and repression of
metastases as well as antigen processing and presentation pathways. The identified changes in EZH2 were associated
with an adverse prognosis in the TCGA dataset. These results suggest that inhibiting of EZH2 is a promising therapeutic
avenue for a substantial fraction of melanoma patients.

Introduction
During cancer progression a tissue-specific dedifferentiation towards an
immortal state takes place [1], a change that requires concerted alterations
at the genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptional level [2]. The polycomb
repressive complex (PRC) 2 is instrumental for chromatin remodeling
and recruitment of proteins required for epigenetic modifications [1,3].
Crucial to PRC2 activity, the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste
homolog 2 (EZH2) [GenBank:2146] tri-methylates lysine 27 of histone
3 (H3K27me3), leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional
repression. EZH2 can also direct DNA methylation via recruitment of
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), thus linking histone methylation to
DNA methylation [3]. The cellular networks targeted by EZH2 are
essential in early development but downregulated in normal adult tissues.
In many types of cancers including lymphomas and leukemia,
EZH2 is postulated to exert its oncogenic effects via aberrant histone
and DNA methylation, causing silencing of tumor suppressor genes
[4–9]. Recent studies have identified reversible H3K27me3 levels in
response to aberrant EZH2 activity in melanoma suggesting
suitability for pharmacological targeting [10–14]. In particular our
recent studies have shown that small molecule inhibitors of EZH2
could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of melanoma cells
harboring somatic mutations of EZH2 [14].

 In this study, we capitalize on the druggability of EZH2 and shed
light on its role as an epigenetic regulator. We apply a comprehensive
systems biology approach to the skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM)
dataset of 471 patients and in total to 12366 Pan-cancer specimens of
32 tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We connect
somatic mutations and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) of
EZH2 to epigenetic and transcriptional control of its target genes.
Methylation status and transcriptional activity of target genes is
combined with the transcriptional response of cellular melanoma
models of activating EZH2 mutations to treatment with an EZH2
inhibitor. The rationale behind combining transcriptional data from
inhibitor studies is to reveal or confirm genes repressed by EZH2
activation.
Methods
We utilized files from 471 SNP arrays, 120 whole-genome, 339
whole-exome, and 440 clinical datasets with normal reference samples
from 471 TCGA SKCM patients. In addition, we selected 458
patients of the SKCM cohort with complete methylome and
transcriptome data. Genomic regions of TCGA SKCM data set
aligned to HG19 were determined using the tool genomic
identification of significant targets in cancer 2.0.21 at confidence
level of 0.99 and cutoff q-value of 0.01. Somatic mutation and
somatic copy number alterations were assessed for 32 different cancer
tissues covering a total cohort size of 9833 and 6506 TCGA patients
for somatic copy number alteration data and whole exome sequencing
data, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). The study was carried out
as part of IRB of the University of California Merced approved study
dbGap ID 5094 “Somatic mutations in melanoma” and conducted in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The results shown
are based upon next generation sequencing data generated by the
TCGA Research Network http://cancergenome.nih.gov. Restricted
access clinical, RNASeq, and whole-exome sequences were obtained
from the TCGA genome data access center and the data portal.
Illumina HiSeq 2000 V2 RNA Sequencing by expectation-
maximization normalized Log2 data was filtered for differential
expression in patients with activating EZH2 mutations in two-tailed
Z-tests and p-values below 0.05 in 458 and 12633 patients in TCGA
SKCM and Pan-cancer, respectively. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
was calculated for paired differential methylation and RNASeq data
classified according to moderate negative correlation (-0.2 ≥ ρ N -0.4)
or strong negative correlation (-0.4 ≥ ρ) and associated with
methylation dependent transcriptional silencing. Pairwise average-
linkage in combination with Pearson’s correlation was used as
distance measure for both, column (patients) and row (genes or
markers) hierarchical clustering. Methylation data was thresholded for
differential methylation in patients with activating EZH2 mutations
in two-tailed Z-tests and p-values below 0.05. Differentially regulated
methylation markers were mapped to HG19 and only kept if a gene
association was detected at least twice. Statistical hypotheses testing,
in detail Fisher’s exact method, was used to determine significant
enrichment of somatic mutation in given patient cohorts. Microarray
analysis was performed on two melanoma cell lines, IGR1 and
MM386, each conducted as duplicates 48 hours after treatment with
DMSO as control or 7.5 μM GSK126 (IC 50 value between 5-8 μM)
[PubChem CID:68210102]. Transcriptomic data were normalized
using the normal-exponential deconvolution method, corrected for
multiple samples in two-tailed T-tests, and adjusted p-values below
0.05. Pathway enrichment was determined using the web-based gene
set analysis toolkit at p-values below 0.05 and mapped onto the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).
Somatic mutations of selected PRC genes were called by multi-step
filtering after cohort selection, mapping of human genome and
patient specific somatic references, assessment of recurrence,
evolutionary conversation, basal mutation rate based on frequency
of mutations of introns vs exons, and structural analysis [10]. TCGA
patients showed recurring mutations TCGA-BF-A1PV-01
EZH2(Y641N), TCGA-D9-A1JW-06 EZH2(Y641F), and
TCGA-EE-A3AF-06 EZH2(Y641N). EZH2 Y641 mutant melano-
ma cell lines C001 and MM386 were a generous gift from Dr. Chris
Schmidt and Dr. Nick Hayward, QIMR, Brisbane, Australia. IGR1
cells were gifted from Dr. David Adams of the Welcome Trust Sanger
Institute, Cambridge, UK. EZH2 wild type status Y641 of MELJD,
ME1007, and KMJR138 cell lines was confirmed by sequenom or
sanger sequencing, while IGR1 had in-frame point mutations
EZH2(Y641N), MM386(Y641H) and C001(Y641S). All cells lines
were authenticated by short tandem repeat validation. Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum (AusGeneX, Brisbane, Queens-
land, Australia) and Pen/Strep (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Human
dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and human epithelial melanocytes (HEM)
were used as untransformed controls (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
HEM were cultured in M254 containing HGMS and all cells were
maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Cell pellets were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA)
buffer and subjected to western blot analysis. Total protein was
determined using a BCA assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Labeled bands were detected by Immune-Star horseradish peroxidase
chemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and images
were captured by the Fujifilm LAS-4000 image system. Antibodies
used were as follows: EZH2 (5246, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA), Beta Actin (AC-74, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), p21
(SC-397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). GSK126
[PubChem CID:68210102] was purchased from Medchemexpress
(New Jersey, NJ, USA) and dissolved in DMSO that was used as the
vehicle control in all experiments. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates
and treated the following day with DMSO, 2.5 μM, 5 μM or 7.5 μM
GSK126. After 48 hours RNA was extracted from cells using the
RNeasyPlus mini prep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified
using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1 μg
was reverse transcribed using SuperScriptIII (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was amplified using the AB7900
real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) system (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) using Universal PCR Mastermix and Taqman
probes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) specific for
CDKN1A [GeneBank:1026] (Hs00355782_m1) and normalized
to levels of 18 s (Hs99999901_s1).
Results
Enrichment of Activating Somatic Mutations of EZH2 in
Melanoma
EZH2 has somatic mutations in several regions of the molecule.
The proportion of mutations that affect the different domains of
EZH2 is similar between the melanoma cohort and the Pan-cancer
average (DMNT binding domain 42. 9%/39.3%, CDYL binding
domain 21.4%/16.7%, CXC domain 14.3%/13.1%, SET domain
21.4%/30.9% in SKCM and TCGA Pan-cancer respectively)

 (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1). Alternative splice events in
exons 3, 4, and 8 give rise to at least 5 mRNA isoforms (Figure 1B). In
total, 100 coding mutations including 22 silent mutations were
detected in EZH2: TCGA SKCM showed a mutation frequency of
4.1% in 339 exomes and TCGA Pan-cancer 1.3% in 6506 exomes.
However, a somatic mutation in the center of the active site of the
SET domain at residue Y641 was recurring. It was detected in 7 cases
of all reported whole exome sequencing melanoma studies and 5
times across the TCGA Pan-cancer cohort. There were 2 cases in 278
metastatic tumors of TCGA SKCM; 1 case in 61 primary tumors of
TCGA SKCM (Figure 1C); 2 cases in 121 metastatic Broad tumors; 2
cases in 91 metastatic Yale tumors [10,13,15]. The replacement of the
JAK2 phosphorylation target residue Y641 alters EZH2 conforma-
tion, increasing its tri-methylation activity and stabilizing the protein
[16,17]. Therefore it is expected that EZH2 Y641 mutants in
melanoma cells exhibit increased H3K27me3 levels. High levels of
activating mutations affecting the SET domain were also evident in
other cancers such as Lymphoid Neoplasm Diffuse Large B-cell
Lymphoma (DLBC) including 2 Y641 mutations, uterine corpus
endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), lung cancer (LUAD), colorectal
cancer (COAD), stomach cancer (STAD), and acute myeloid
leukemia (LAML). Isoform-specific RNASeq analysis resolved splice
variants of EZH2 (Figure 2A).

Extension of Exon 8, Hence Down-Stream Somatic Mutation
Target Location is at Y641
Next, we investigated the TCGA RNASeq dataset to identify
which isoforms of EZH2 were predominantly transcribed. Across the
TCGA PAN-cancer panel, the predominantly transcribed isoform is
mRNA transcript variant 3 [GeneBank:NM_001203247], 746
amino acids [GeneBank:NP_001190176], corresponding Uniprot
entry [Swiss-Prot:Q15910-1], lacking a short segment at the end of
exon 8 coding for 5 amino acids (Figure 2A). This is in contrast to
the longest and first described transcript variant 1 [Gene-
Bank:NM_004456], 751 amino acids [GeneBank:NP_004447],
corresponding Uniprot isoform 2 [GeneBank:Q15910-2], [18].
While consistently being the major transcript across TCGA
Pan-cancer as well as SKCM, Melanoma patients show 1.46-fold
higher expression of the major EZH2 transcript compared to the
TCGA Pan-cancer median in Z-tests with p-values below 1.0e-10
(Figure 2A). Patients with Y641 mutations share the common
transcript [GeneBank:NM_001203247] and no switching of the 5’
splice donor site of exon 8 was detected. Other alternative minor
transcripts detected in cancer lacked mRNA segments in exon 3, 4,
and 14 result in shorted isoforms, [GeneBank:NM_152998], 707
amino acids and [GeneBank:NM_001203248], 737 amino acids,

sequence as filled and empty diamonds, respectively. Amino acid residues with recurring mutations across TCGA Pan-cancer tissues are
shown as stacks of multiple diamonds: Y641 in red has three recurrences in melanoma, and two in lymphoma; D185H, R497Q, Q540P/*,
K660E/R, and E740K/fs, each have recurrences in TCGA Pan-cancer.

 which did not affect the SET-domain. Given the consistent and
predominant transcriptional pattern of EZH2, we recommend
cataloging of isoform [GeneBank:NM_001203247] as canonical
transcript (Figures 1B and 2A). Numbering according to this
transcript identifies the recurring somatic mutation in the SET-
domain as Y641 (Figure 2B).
Significant Copy Number Gain of EZH2 in Melanoma
In addition to activating somatic mutations, TCGA melanoma
patients showed strong somatic copy number alterations of EZH2
(Figure 3A). The EZH2 locus is over-expressed at the level of somatic
copy number alterations (5.0% significant SCNA gain with a q-value
below 0.01), which is higher than the TCGA Pan-cancer average of
1.8% (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 2). The EZH2 locus at band
7q36.1 chr7:148,504,464-148,581,441 is in close proximity (8Mbp)
to BRAF [GeneBank:673] and CDK5 [GeneBank:1020]. These and
other proto-oncogenes share a hotspot at the end of the q-arm of
chromosome 7 which is implicated in a significant amplification event
with q-values below 10e-05 at a frequency of more than 50% for
WGS (120 patients) and SNP-arrays (471 patients) (Figure 3B).
Transcriptional levels of EZH2 are also increased in a subset of
melanoma patients and 14.2% of patients showed differentially
upregulated RNASeq levels. As expected, SCNA amplification of
EZH2 correlates with mRNA upregulation and patients with SNCA
gains showed increased EZH2 expression at the RNASeq level
(Figure 3C). In comparison to Pan-cancer levels, the normalized
RNASeq reads of EZH2 of SKCM patients are elevated by 46.7%
(Figure 2A). Further, the pattern of SCNAs in melanoma is tightly
linked to its mutational signature and tumor samples of patients with
EZH2 and BRAF mutations are significantly enriched in somatic
copy number amplifications with p-values below 0.05 and q-values
below 10e-05 in comparison to BRAF wild type status (Figure 3C).
EZH2 activation correlates with decreased patient survival (Figure 4).
Kaplan–Meier curves of patients with EZH2 activating mutation,
EZH2 amplification, or high normalized RNASeq counts show
reduced patient survival of 1.8 years in comparison to curves of
patients with EZH2 wild-type status (Figure 4A). RNASeq expression
levels of EZH2 correlate with reduced overall median survival of
melanoma patients of 1.8 years (Figure 4B).
Multi-Omics Study of Cancer Patient Data Correlates
Epigenomic Silencing, DNA Hypermethylation, and Tran-
scriptional Derepression by EZH2
We sought to identify EZH2 target genes in melanoma by combining
three separate data sets. We combined gene transcription and DNA
methylation data from the SKCM cohort in the TCGA with our own
gene expression data based on response to small molecule inhibition of
EZH2 in melanoma cell lines with activating mutations (Figure 5).
In SKCM, about 1/5th of the patient cohort is affected by somatic
mutations, somatic copy number amplification, or transcriptional
upregulation of EZH2. These tumors were considered likely to have
high EZH2 activity and were compared to all other SKCM tumors.
Comparing these cohorts, we overlaid gene sets of the TCGA SKCM
transcriptome and methylome data looking for genes with both
decreased expression and increased DNA methylation (Figure 5, A–B).
In addition to histone tri-methylation, which compacts chromatin
structure and represses transcription, EZH2 recruits DNA methyl-
transferases to methylate DNA and thereby enhances transcriptional
repression. We therefore considered that EZH2 target genes would
show decreased transcription and increased DNA methylation levels in
the patient tumor data. To further increase confidence that these were
EZH2 targets, we combined these results with expression array results
from melanoma cells treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126
[PubChem CID:68210102] (Figure 5, A–C).
Figure 2. Isoform-specific RNASeq data across PAN-cancer panel assigns recurring somatic mutation of EZH2 in cancer to Y641 in center
of SET domain. (A) Distribution of RNASeq data show isoform-specific counts for PAN-cancer and TCGA SKCM patients across 12633 and
458 specimens, respectively (somatic genotype and TCGA patient ID are indicated). Transcript NM_001203247 is the predominant
isoform of wildtype and somatically mutated EZH2. We recommend mRNA transcript NM_001203247 and its corresponding 746 amino
acid-long protein as canonical sequence framework. Asterisk indicated significant difference by Z-test with p-value below 1.0e-10
between isoforms or between TCGA Pan-cancer and SKCM cohorts. (B) The residue with the most frequent recurring somatic mutations

 As expected, patients with high EZH2 activity had differentially
expressed genes that were mostly decreased (55.8% down) (Figures 5B,
6). Specifically, there were 2052 of 18088 transcripts differentially
down regulated. Heatmaps of RNASeq data of top 50 genes with
somatic EZH2 alterations visualize the transcriptional response
(Figure 6). Also as expected, these patients showed mostly increased
gene hypermethylation (74.7% up)—consisting of 82639 (61703 up,
mapped to 12125 genes) of 485577 CG islands (Figure 5B).
Following treatment of melanoma cells with EZH2 inhibitor
GSK126, H3K27me3 levels are expected to be decreased leading to
increased transcriptional levels of EZH2 target genes. We performed
protein immunoblotting to analyze the impact of EZH2 on
H3K27me3 levels in melanoma cell lines. Common to all tested
melanoma cell lines was presence of H3K27me3 that could be
reduced by the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 (Figure 7A). GSK126 is a
competitive inhibitor of EZH2’s methyltransferase activity that does
not degrade EZH2 protein. Cell lines with active site mutations in
the SET domain at Y641 had elevated H3K27me3 levels compared
to wild-type cells. Upon treatment with GSK126, all tested cell lines
had strongly reduced H3K27me3 levels (Figure 7A). In our
experiments 539 transcripts showed significantly deregulated gene
expression following GSK126 treatment with log2-fold changes
above 2 and p-values below 0.05 (Figure 5B). 74.6% (402) of the
deregulated genes were increased. Candidate EZH2 target genes were
taken to be those both repressed in the SKCM cohort with EZH2
amplification or activation (threshold p-value below 0.05) and
increase of transcription in melanoma cells following EZH2
inhibition by GSK126 (p-value below 0.05). The overlap of
TCGA and drug response transcriptomes resulted in 98 responsive
genes, of which 65 genes also showed DNA hypermethylation in
TCGA tumors with high EZH2 activity (Figure 5B and C,
Supplementary Table 3). These 65 candidate EZH2 target genes
in melanoma included CDKN1A [GeneBank:1026] (Figures 7, B–
C and 8), NDRG1 [GeneBank:10397], NFKB2 [GeneBank:4791],
NFKBIA [GeneBank:4792], EPAS1 [GeneBank:2034], JUN [Gen-
eBank:3725], JUND [GeneBank:3727], FOS [GeneBank:2353],

 Multi-Omics Study Shows Enrichment of Transcriptional
Silencing of Important Tumor Suppressors, Differentiation
Factors, and Immune Response Genes
In order to assess any potential functional impact of high EZH2
activity in melanoma, we conducted a gene enrichment analysis of the 65
candidate EZH2 target genes derived from the above analysis. A KEGG
pathway analysis showed that these candidate genes were significantly
enriched in pathways deregulated in cancer including CDKN1A,
NFKB2, NFKBIA, EPAS1, JUN, FOS, ITGA3, and PLCG2 (KEGG
ID:05200; p-value = 6.33e-08; Supplementary Table 5). In addition,
genes involved in antigen processing and presentation were significantly
enriched (KEGG ID: 04612; p-value = 1.02e-05; Supplementary Table
5). We conducted a motif search of corresponding promotor and
transcription start sites to identify transcriptional cooperation of PRC2.
The identified target genes share a purine-rich motif of GGA(G/A)(G/A)
at their promotors typical for recognition by E2F-related factors. We
further assessed the DNA methylation pattern of this test group of
silenced target genes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of their DNA
methylation pattern recapitulated EZH2 status (Figure 9). The effect on
DNA methylation was particularly pronounced in patients with
activation mutations of EZH2 (Figure 10). Specifically we analyzed all
CpG markers with significant elevation of methylation in patients with
enhanced somatic EZH2 activity. The relative locations of methylation
revealed accumulation of methylation sites at the transcription start site of
candidate target genes. Besides chromatin histone tri-methylation by
somatically activated EZH2 (Figure 7, Supplementary Table 4), such
DNA hypermethylation pattern contributes to dampening the transcrip-
tional response of affected target genes (Figures 6, 9, and 10).
Activating Somatic Mutations of EZH2 Y641 Contribute to
Melanomagenesis by Tumor Suppressor Gene Silencing
Of the identified genes, we selected CDKN1A for characterization by
RT-qPCR and western blot analysis (Figure 7). EZH2 may exhibit its
oncogenic potential through CDKN1A by transcriptionally downregu-
lating its gene product, the tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator p21
(Figure 7B) [17,19]. While EZH2 is absent or lowly expressed in human
epithelial melanocytes (HEM) or human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), it is
highly expressed in melanoma cells MELJD, ME1007, KMJR138
(Figure 7B). We were able to identify three cellular melanoma models,
IGR1, C001, and MM386, which recapitulate the Y641 point
mutations. All three melanoma cell lines showed evidence of expression
of EZH2 at the protein level (Figure 7A). The gene productof CDKN1A,
p21, is absent in melanocytes but present in melanoma cells. In stark
contrast, melanoma cell lines with activating EZH2 mutations show
absence of p21 (Figure 7B). Using a small molecule EZH2 inhibitor, we
monitored the transcriptional response of CDKN1A by RT-qPCR.
MM386 and IGR-1 cells showed a dose dependent upregulation of
CDKN1A by RT-qPCR (Figure 7C), following treatment with GSK126,
which is a competitive inhibitor of EZH2s methyltransferase activity [20].
Taken together, the transcriptional reactivation of CDKN1A following
EZH2 inhibition by GSK126 shows reversal of the transcriptional
silencing observed with activating EZH2 mutations.
Interaction of EZH2 With DNA Remodelers
Lastly, we sought to investigate if EZH2 alterations co-occur with
changes to other DNA remodelers. Overexpressed in many types of
cancers, EZH2 is postulated to exert its oncogenic effects via aberrant
methylation, causing silencing of tumor suppressor genes. It
tri-methylates histones, ultimately causing gene repression by

 with whole exome sequencing data. The mutational signature of
EZH2 (5.04% of SKCM patients) (Figure 1A) is mutually exclusive
to non-synonymous somatic mutations in DNMT3A [Gene-
Bank:1788] (occurring in 2.88% of patients) or DNMT3B
[GeneBank:1789] (4.68% of patients) with an odds-ratio of 3.8,
but is not strictly mutually exclusive to DNMT1 [GeneBank:1786]
mutations (6.47% of patients) (Figure 10). EZH2-D142V in the
DNMT binding domain and DNMT1-I531R co-occur as well as
EZH2-C535W and DNMT1-R1466C. Further somatic mutations
of PRC-associated DNMTs occur in methyltransfer domains,
replication foci domains, and bromo-adjacent homology domains
displaying an EZH2-distinct route of epigenetic changes in cancer.
The mutual exclusivity (reflected in all cancers including blood-
derived cancer with high EZH2 alterations LAML, acute myeloid
leukemia, and DBLC, Lymphoid Neoplasm Diffuse Large B-cell
Lymphoma) points towards a potential mechanism of somatic
mutations in PRC2 driving cancer through EZH2 or alternatively
DNMT3A/B (Figures 9, 10). Identification of genes whose
expression is specifically modulated by EZH2, DNMT1 vs
DNMT3A/B, and combination of EZH2 and DNMT inhibitors
are the next logical steps in this line of research. Taken together,
amplified methylation patterns as observed in EZH2-activated
patients are part of the transcriptional response of affected target
genes and regulate gene clusters critical for oncogenic signaling.
Discussion
This analysis on the large SKCM dataset from TCGA appears to have
revealed several hitherto unappreciated aspects of EZH2 biology in
melanoma. Although the analysis verified that activating mutations of
EZH2 are relatively uncommon [15] when added to copy number
Figure 5. Multiomics analysis of EZH2 activation across different platform combined with responsiveness to drug treatment in melanoma.
(A) The histone methyltransferase EZH2 transcriptionally silences target genes by tri-methylation of histone 3 K27. Cooperation with DNA
methyltransferases helps manifest the transcriptional inactivation. 88 patients with EZH2 somatic mutations, somatic copy number
amplification, and/or somatic mRNA upregulation were combined into a subhort comprising about 20% of all patients. Melanoma cells of
TCGA patients with activating somatic mutations of EZH2(Y641) were cultured and subjected to a drug response assay using the EZH2
inhibitor GSK126. (B) Three genomics datasets, TCGA RNASeq, TCGA MethylSeq, and microarray of the drug response of cell lines, were
filtered by p-value threshold below 0.05 and sorted by significantly up or down regulation. (C) EZH2 target genes show overlap of

 gains and amplification of gene expression the number of patients
with dysregulation of EZH2 approaches 20% of patients (88 of 471
patients). Pathological hyperactivity of EZH2 can arise from somatic
amplification persisting at the transcriptional level or from somatic
mutations but both events eventually result in a disruption of the
epigenetic homeostasis. By looking into isoform-specific RNASeq
data of more than 12,000 patients we were able to map the major
cancer transcript [GeneBank:NM_001203247] of EZH2, which is
an essential step to unambiguously identify non-synonymous somatic
mutations. Irrespectively of lengths of N-terminal domains, somatic
mutations across different cancers hit a unique phosphorylation site in
the center of the SET domain resulting in hyperactivation and
increased tri-methylation activity. Somatic Y641 mutations correlate
with hypermethylation and lead to prominent gene suppression in the
TCGA dataset. Patients with somatic copy number amplifications of
EZH2 showed a similar functional impact: gene suppression was
most pronounced in cases where SCNA events translated to
significant upregulation of EZH2 transcripts. Importantly, the
SCNA event amplifying EZH2 impacts a broad genomic environ-
ment including CREB3L2 [GeneBank:64764], KIAA1549 [Gene-
Bank:57670], KDM7A [GeneBank:80853], BRAF [GeneBank:673],
CDK5 [GeneBank:1020], and KMT2C [GeneBank:58508]. This
suggests that a broader genomic context of chromosome 7 is functionally
important for the tumor instead of a focal event amplifying an isolated
proto-oncogene in melanoma. Our analysis identified a coincidence of
BRAF activation with EZH2 amplification providing a mechanistic link
for previous studies, which showed an association between BRAF
mutations and DNA hypermethylation [21].
Abnormal DNA methylation of CpG markers is a well-known
epigenetic feature of cancer [22]. Melanoma exhibits global
hypomethylation within the bulk genome and local hypermethylation
at specific tumor suppressor genes [23,24]. Gene-specific DNA
hypermethylation might serve as classifier for melanoma, as studies
indicate that multilocus DNA methylation signature genes may
differentiate melanomas from nevi [25]. The characterized and
confirmed candidate target genes susceptible to reversible EZH2
histone modification upon drug treatment agreed with the
transcriptional signature of TCGA SKCM patients with EZH2
hyperactivity. The majority of the 98 candidate target genes also
showed high levels of DNA methylation. This is consistent with
suggested concerted action of histone modifiers and DNA methyl-
transferases at the epigenomic level resulting in transcriptional
repression [2]. Methylation data in TCGA showed that DNA
methylation appeared to be the common cause of gene suppression
associated with EZH2. This may not be that surprising given that
DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B are
closely associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 and are
required for epigenetic modifications [1,3]. The mechanism of
suppression of genes not associated with DNA methylation may
represent transcriptional repression resulting from EZH2 mediated
histone methylation but was not further explored in this analysis.
Recent studies in murine melanoma models and human melanoma
cultures have supported a role for EZH2 in the proliferation and
metastasis of melanoma and have linked these properties to expression
of possible suppressor genes identified in TCGA [10–14]. Gene
expression studies carried out on melanoma lines with known

 activating mutations of EZH2 before and after treatment with the
GSK126 inhibitor were a valuable resource to identify genes linked to
EZH2 activation in the TCGA data set and allowed for detailed study
of their epigenetic DNA makeup in SKCM patients. The test group
of silenced candidate target genes recapitulated EZH2 status in
unsupervised hierarchical clustering of their DNA methylation
pattern and revealed accumulation of methylation sites at the
transcription start site of candidate target genes.
The tissue-specific effector genes of the histone modifier EZH2 vary
greatly. In vitro studies of cancer cell lines recapitulating activating Y641
mutations show a more than three-fold increase of tri-methylation of
H3K27me3, a histone mark connected with gene silencing [11–14].
Activated EZH2 is associated with decreased transcription of tumor
suppressor genes as well as antigen presentation in melanoma patients.
Gene enrichment analysis of the genes combined from the GSK126
inhibitor studies with that of genes repressed in the TCGA dataset
identified genes with well-known tumor suppressor activity, regulation of
cell division, invasion and metastases. JUN, JUND, FOS, and FOSB
implicated in our study are part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex
that induces differentiation. EZH2 knockout studies in mice showed that
in early development, EZH2 in the skin prevents premature AP-1
binding and maintains the epidermal progenitors until the precise
moment differentiation is appropriate, sparked by a decline in EZH2
[26,27]. It has been suggested that aberrant EZH2 activity in cancer
maintains the cells in a stem like state, therefore EZH2 inhibitors may
represent a strategy to induce differentiation and repress tumor growth.
Transcription of putative targets CDKN1A, BCL6, BOK, NDRG1, and
NFKB is significantly reduced in SKCM patients with EZH2 activation.
Although involved in different signaling axes—often with feed-back loops
and dual impact in tumor promotion and suppression—these important
regulators have in common that they can promote proliferative events, if
suppressed [28].
We were able to confirm transcriptional reactivation of the tumor
suppressor CDKN1A in EZH2 Y641 mutated melanoma cells, using
an EZH2 inhibitor. CDKN1A encodes the cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitor p21, which activates multiple tumor suppressor pathways
including cell cycle arrest, differentiation and cellular senescence.
These findings are consistent with a previous report that demon-
strated EZH2 depletion in melanoma lead to reactivation of p21 and
inhibited the growth of xenografts in mice [17,19]. Patients with
activating EZH2 mutations, show hypermethylation and transcrip-
tional silencing of the tumor suppressor CDKN1A resulting in
absence of p21, the gene product of CDKN1A. Inhibition of EZH2
by small molecule drugs reactivates CDKN1A and illustrates how
epigenetic control by EZH2 can regulate the plasticity of melanoma.
An unexpected finding was the repression of many genes associated
with immune responses in patients with EZH2 dysregulation.
However, this is consistent with increasing appreciation that activated
EZH2 is associated with decreased transcription of genes involved in
antigen presentation in melanoma patients. Recent data suggests that
specific oncogenic signals can mediate cancer immune evasion and
resistance to immunotherapies [29] and specifically EZH2 can
dampen the anti-tumor immune response via repression of MHC-II
genes [30,31]. In support of this we identified downregulation of
CD74 [GeneBank:972], an important chaperone that associates with
MHC-II to regulate antigen presentation for immune responses, in
addition to chemokines/chemokine receptors, CCL28 [Gene-
Bank:56477], CCL3L1 [GeneBank:6349] and CCR7 [Gene-
Bank:1236], known to activate T cells and B cells [29].
Modulation of immune potentiation via epigenetic signals may
point toward new candidate targets for melanoma treatment. A group
of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes stood out as enriched
cluster in transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis. HLA genes
controlled by epigenetic pattern may contribute to observed
regulation and diversity of neoantigens in melanoma [32].

 Conclusion
In summary these studies indicate that dysregulation of EZH2 is a
relatively common occurrence in patients with melanoma and that
this has negative implications for patient survival. Somatic events
across different omics levels were associated with repression of genes
involved in suppression of tumors as well as immune responses
against cancers. The isoform-specific RNASeq analysis unambigu-
ously identifies the major transcript of EZH2 and the copy number
analysis shows functional amplification events of EZH2 across
melanoma patients. The data also suggests that the previously
described association of BRAF V600 mutations with methylation of
DNA may be linked to overexpression of closely associated regions on
chromosome 7. Repression of the EZH2 target genes appears to be
largely due to both tri-methylation of H3K27 as well as methylation
of DNA and this provides a basis for investigating combinations of
both EZH2 and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in patients with
over expressed EZH2. Taken together, the PRC2 displays enhanced
activity in melanoma. Hyperactivation of EZH2 by somatic copy
number amplification, activating somatic mutations, or transcrip-
tional upregulation correlates with DNA methylation and epigenetic
silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression and immune
responses in melanoma. Further studies are needed to determine
whether inhibitors of EZH2 may also have a role immunotherapy
with checkpoint inhibitors. Sophisticated chromatin immunoprecip-
itation experiments will closely decipher interaction of EZH2 with its
target genes, chromatin modifiers and DNA methyltransferases.
Taken together, EZH2 and its associated chromatin remodeling
machinery represent a promising opportunity for therapeutic
intervention in melanoma.
