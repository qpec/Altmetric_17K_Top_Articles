ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To assess the association of low socioeconomic 
status and risk factors for non-communicable 
diseases (diabetes, high alcohol intake, high 
blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity, 
smoking) with loss of physical functioning at 
older ages.
DESIGN
Multi-cohort population based study.
SETTING
37 cohort studies from 24 countries in Europe, 
the United States, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, 
1990-2017.
PARTICIPANTS
109 107 men and women aged 45-90 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Physical functioning assessed using the walking 
speed test, a valid index of overall functional 
capacity. Years of functioning lost was computed as 
a metric to quantify the difference in walking speed 
between those exposed and unexposed to low 
socioeconomic status and risk factors.
RESULTS
According to mixed model estimations, men aged 
60 and of low socioeconomic status had the 
same walking speed as men aged 66.6 of high 
socioeconomic status (years of functioning lost 
6.6 years, 95% confidence interval 5.0 to 9.4). The 
years of functioning lost for women were 4.6 (3.6 to 
6.2). In men and women, respectively, 5.7 (4.4 to 
8.1) and 5.4 (4.3 to 7.3) years of functioning were 
lost by age 60 due to insufficient physical activity, 5.1 
(3.9 to 7.0) and 7.5 (6.1 to 9.5) due to obesity, 2.3 
(1.6 to 3.4) and 3.0 (2.3 to 4.0) due to hypertension, 
5.6 (4.2 to 8.0) and 6.3 (4.9 to 8.4) due to diabetes, 
and 3.0 (2.2 to 4.3) and 0.7 (0.1 to 1.5) due to 
tobacco use. In analyses restricted to high income 
countries, the number of years of functioning lost 
attributable to low socioeconomic status by age 
60 was 8.0 (5.7 to 13.1) for men and 5.4 (4.0 to 
8.0) for women, whereas in low and middle income 
countries it was 2.6 (0.2 to 6.8) for men and 2.7 (1.0 
to 5.5) for women. Within high income countries, the 
number of years of functioning lost attributable to low 
socioeconomic status by age 60 was greater in the 
United States than in Europe. Physical functioning 
continued to decline as a function of unfavourable risk 
factors between ages 60 and 85. Years of functioning 
lost were greater than years of life lost due to low 
socioeconomic status and non-communicable disease 
risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS
The independent association between socioeconomic 
status and physical functioning in old age is 
comparable in strength and consistency with those for 
established non-communicable disease risk factors. 
The results of this study suggest that tackling all these 
risk factors might substantially increase life years 
spent in good physical functioning.
Introduction
In the context of a rapidly aging world population, 
global health strategies have considered healthy 
aging as a public health priority.1 2 The World Health 
Organization Global Action Plan for the Prevention 
and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, for 
example, has set member states a goal by 2025 to 
reduce premature mortality from chronic diseases

by 25%.3 This is to be achieved by targeting high 
alcohol consumption, insufficient physical activity, 
tobacco use, high blood pressure, excess salt intake, 
diabetes, and obesity. Recent studies suggest that 
targeting adverse socioeconomic circumstances or 
low socioeconomic status in addition to these risk 
factors might lead to additional gains in longevity.4 5 
Socioeconomic status is a sociological construct 
referring to an individual’s relative position in the 
social hierarchy, as measured by indicators such as 
occupational group, educational attainment, level of 
income and wealth, and place of residence.
In addition to prevention of age related morbidity 
and premature mortality, minimising the time that 
people spend living with disability and dependence 
is a major public health challenge. Although several 
investigations have found socioeconomic status and 
risk factors for non-communicable diseases to predict 
mobility and disability,6-18 whether socioeconomic 
status has a similar predictive value for functioning 
as 
established 
non-communicable 
disease 
risk 
factors has not yet been explored. Using national data 
across different contexts and regions to examine the 
consistency of the associations of socioeconomic status 
and non-communicable risk factors with physical 
functioning and mortality within a single analytic 
setting would be useful because of implications for 
priority setting of risk factors as well as planning 
health and social policies. We hypothesised that 
socioeconomic status is related to greater absolute 
differences in physical functioning at older ages 
than younger ages as is the case for established non-
communicable disease risk factors.
We compared the association between socio-
economic status and physical functioning with those 
between established non-communicable disease 
risk factors and physical functioning from early to 
advanced age. To obtain reliable and generalisable 
estimates, we pooled harmonised individual level data 
from 37 studies spanning 24 countries from Europe, 
the United States, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and 
Asia. We used walking speed as a measure of physical 
functioning because it is a simple and sensitive 
indicator of overall functional capacity.19 As walking 
is a complex task requiring energy, balance, movement 
control, and coordination of the musculoskeletal, 
nervous, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems,19 
disturbance or deterioration in any of these 
modalities tends to affect the speed of walking.20 21 
Furthermore, walking speed declines with age and 
predicts functional limitations, hospital admission, 
clinical and subclinical disease, comorbidities, frailty, 
admission to residential care, and mortality,19 22-28 
even in old age.29
Methods
Study populations
The present study is part of an EC Horizon 2020 
consortium, the LIFEPATH project. In the present 
analysis we included a total of 37 studies comprising 
109 107 men and women aged 45 to 90 years from 
24 WHO member countries: UK, France, USA, Mexico, 
China, Ghana, India, Russia, South Africa, Costa Rica, 
Taiwan, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, 
Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, 
Sweden, and Switzerland. We chose the 45-90 age 
range as few data were available for younger or older 
age groups and the meaning of walking speed in the 
age group 30-40 years is unclear.
Data were collected between 1990 and 2017. All 
studies included data on socioeconomic status and 
walking speed. We excluded people who used walking 
aids because walking speed was used as a proxy 
measure of overall functioning, and the assessment 
is not reliable among participants using walking 
aids. The relevant local or national ethics committees 
approved each study, and participants gave informed 
consent to participate. Six datasets were part of the 
LIFEPATH Consortium (the GAZEL, ELSA, WHITEHALL 
II, CONSTANCES, TILDA, and EPIPORTO studies), 
six were part of the WHO Study on global AGEing 
and adult health (SAGE), 12 were from the Survey of 
Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 
four were from the InterUniversity Consortium for 
Political and Social Research (MIDUS, HEPESE, SEBAS, 
and NSHAP), one was from the Health and Retirement 
Study (HRS), two were from the Wisconsin Longitudinal 
Study (WLSG and WLSS), three were from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 
III, NHANES 1999, and NHANES 2001), two were from 
the Costa Rican Longevity and Health Ageing Study 
(CRELES Pre 1945 and CRELES RC), and one was from 
the Health and Ageing Study in Africa: A Longitudinal 
Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa 
(HAALSI). The appendix provides details of the study 
design, participants, and cohort descriptions.
Risk factors
In the LIFEPATH Consortium, we used a predefined 
harmonised definition of socioeconomic status, 
as described in previous papers.30 31 We used 
information on several social indicators available in 
the participating cohort studies—education, own and 
father’s occupational class, and income. For adults, 
we assigned socioeconomic status to cohort members 
using information on the last known occupational title 
at study enrolment. To obtain a harmonised measure 
of occupational class across the study cohorts, we 
classified occupations according to the European 
socioeconomic classification, which is a classification 
based on the nature of employment relationships.32 
We predefined and harmonised such data across 
the study cohorts before analyses.4 We categorised 
occupational class into high (higher professionals 
and managers, higher clerical, services, and sales 
workers 
(European 
socioeconomic 
class 
1-3)), 
intermediate (small employers and self employed, 
farmers, lower supervisors and technicians, class 
4-6), or low socioeconomic status (lower clerical, 
services, and sales workers, skilled workers, semi-
skilled and unskilled workers, class 7-9).33 Given the

occupation, in the case of HAALSI, we used a measure 
of wealth categorised in thirds.
Self reported smoking was categorised into 
current, former, and never. Alcohol consumption was 
measured in alcohol units weekly, and we categorised 
participants as non-drinkers (0 units/week), moderate 
drinkers (1-21 units/week for men, 1-14 units/week 
for women), or harmful drinkers (>21 units/week for 
men, >14 units/week for women). Leisure physical 
activity was measured with different questions in each 
study, making it impossible to derive a comprehensive 
definition. As a result, we dichotomised leisure physical 
activity as sufficient or insufficient in each study 
using study specific thresholds (see supplementary 
appendix 2). Height and weight were measured using 
standard procedures; body mass index (BMI) was 
calculated as kg/m2 and categorised as normal (18.5 
to <25), overweight (25 to <30), or obese (≥30), with 
those who were underweight (<18.5) excluded from 
the BMI analyses. Hypertension was defined as the 
presence of at least one of systolic blood pressure 
≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, 
current antihypertensive treatment, or self reported 
hypertension. Diabetes was defined as the presence 
of at least one of fasting glucose concentration 
≥7 mmol/L, post-load glucose concentration >11.1 
mmol/L at two hours, glycated haemoglobin A1c level 
≥6.5%, or self reported diabetes.
Covariates
We considered age, height, and year of birth (five 
year intervals) as potential confounders. Height is a 
correlate of walking speed, as longer legs are associated 
with higher walking speed (allometric dependence 
of walking speed). In addition, height is a marker of 
childhood health or disease, which can affect both 
walking speed in adulthood and functioning in old 
age. In supplementary models, we also controlled for 
ethnic origin and baseline health status.
Walking speed
In all cohorts, participants were instructed to walk at 
their usual pace. The setup differed among cohorts, 
(see supplementary table S1 for details). The distance 
walked varied from 8 feet (2.4 m) in ELSA, WHITEHALL 
II, NHANES III, and HEPESE to 15.24 m in MIDUS. 
Walking time was recorded with photoelectric devices 
for some cohorts and manually by an interviewer for 
others. In all studies, time walked was averaged across 
multiple trials and was then converted into an overall 
measure of speed, expressed as metres travelled per 
second (m/s). Walking speed was assessed at the same 
time as participant risk factors.
Mortality
In a subset of 24 cohorts (table 1), 83 783 participants 
were linked to national mortality registries that 
provided information about vital status. We set the 
baseline for mortality analysis at the same wave in 
which gait speed measures were obtained. Mean 
mortality follow-up ranged between 2.9 years (MIDUS) 
and 21.4 years (NHANES 3), with a mean of 8.1 years 
(SD 5.2 years) across cohorts.
Statistical analysis
Walking speed and age
We used a generalised additive mixed model (GAMM)34 
to estimate walking speed, with age and height as fixed 
effect predictors and study as random effect at the 
intercept and age slope. GAMM is a semi-parametric 
model that uses a family of splines to obtain a smooth 
representation of the dependence of walking speed 
with age. The algorithm implemented in the R package 
gamm4 automatically selected the number of knots in 
the splines.35 We computed 95% confidence intervals 
from the uncertainty of the estimated smoothing 
function.
Years of functioning lost
We computed the number of years of functioning lost 
from the mixed model predictions of walking speed 
along with age. The mixed model of walking speed 
included a random effect of study at the intercept and 
age slope. Fixed effects included age, age2, height, 
year of birth, distances walked, the risk factor under 
study (minimally adjusted models) or all risk factors 
(mutually adjusted models), and an interaction term 
between age and the risk factor. The structure of the 
models was determined through likelihood ratio tests.
Confidence intervals for years of functioning lost 
were determined through 5000 bootstrap samples, 
applying a model based parametric bootstrap 
method.36 For all examined risk factors, we computed 
the years of functioning lost associated with exposure 
by predicting the chronological age of the unexposed 
group equivalent to the walking speed at age 60 (or 
85) of the exposed group. Years of functioning lost 
was then obtained as (60 (or 85) age reference). This 
method allows years of functioning lost at a given 
age to be calculated retrospectively, as opposed to the 
classic years of life lost calculated prospectively.
Years of life lost
Years of life lost were used as a secondary outcome, 
and we compared this with years of functioning lost, 
our primary outcome. We calculated years of life lost 
as the difference between the areas under the survival 
curves (from age 60 to 85) of the population exposed 
to a given risk factor compared with the unexposed 
reference population. Survival curves were estimated 
using Kaplan-Meier adjusted curves, conditional on 
survival to age 60 years. We ran a shared frailty Cox 
model19 with age as time scale, stratified by the levels 
of the given risk factor and year of birth as covariate 
(for minimally adjusted models) or year of birth and the 
remaining risk factors as covariates (mutually adjusted 
models). The shared frailty variable was introduced to 
account for study effect.19

Results
Thirty seven studies from 24 countries were included. 
Of 140 092 participants with data on walking speed, 
we excluded 30 985 (8912 were outside the studied 
age range (45-90 years), 18 545 (14.1%) lacked data 
on socioeconomic status, 1468 lacked data on one or 
more of the covariates, and 2060 (1.9%) used a walking 
aid). This left 109 107 participants for analysis (fig 1). 
Compared with those included in the analyses, the 
excluded participants were younger (58.1 v 63.7 years, 
this is because we set 45 years as the minimum age), 
of a lower socioeconomic status (36.7% v 32.2%), and 
more likely to be women (64.8% v 49.4%). They were 
also more likely to have a normal BMI (46.8% v 41.0%), 
abstain from alcohol (64.3% v 42.9%), be physically 
inactive (32.4% v 29.4%), have hypertension (59.4% v 
55.2%), and smoke (22.1% v 15.2%).
Of the 109 107 participants, 14 368 (13.2%) were 
aged 75-90 and 41 656 (38.2%) were younger than 
60. The mean age for men was 63.9 (SD 9.4) and 
for women was 63.6 (SD 9.8); 49.4% were women 
(table 1). About one third of participants were in or 
had been in a low occupational class; 35.4% of men 
and 24.8% of women were in or had been in a high 
occupational class.

Figure 2 shows the age related decline in walking 
speed in 55 255 men and 53 852 women predicted 
using the GAMM model, conditioned to the average 
height of men and women. For men, walking speed 
declined from 1.19 m/s (95% confidence interval 1.08 
to 1.30) at age 45 to 0.95 m/s (0.83 to 1.08) at age 90. 
For women, the decline was from 1.15 m/s (1.03 to 
1.26) at age 45 to 0.81 m/s (0.70 to 0.92) at age 90. 
Age related decline in walking speed was not linear but 
accelerated after the ages of 65-70 for both men and 
women.
Years of functioning lost by age 60 and 85
Figure 3 shows the years of functioning lost by age 
60 due to exposure to suboptimal risk factors, as 
measured by differences in walking speed. A 60 
year old man of low socioeconomic status had the 
same walking speed as a 66.6 year old man of high 
socioeconomic status (95% confidence interval 5.0 
to 9.4), whereas for women the difference was 4.6 
(3.6 to 6.2) years. Years of functioning lost due to 
low socioeconomic status were comparable to years 
of functioning lost due to obesity, diabetes, and 
physical inactivity (range 5.1 to 5.6 for men and 5.4 
to 7.5 for women), but they were greater than years 
lost due to tobacco smoking, hypertension, and high 
alcohol intake (range 0.7 to 3.0 for men and 3.0 to 
−0.1 for women). Results were comparable in analyses 
mutually controlling for all risk factors. Analyses 
were repeated using a two step approach including 
cohort specific analyses and pooling of cohort specific 
estimates using meta-analysis (see supplementary 
appendix 4). The approach yielded results similar to 
those found in the main analysis (see figure 3). Finally, 
we also estimated years of functioning lost by ages 50

and 70 (see supplementary appendix 3, figures S2 and 
S3); the pattern and magnitude of the associations 
between risk factor and years of functioning lost were 
comparable to those observed by age 60.
In analyses restricted to high income countries, years 
of functioning lost attributable to low socioeconomic 
status by age 60 were 8.0 (95% confidence interval 
5.7 to 13.1) for men and 5.4 (4.0 to 8.0) for women 
(see supplementary appendix 3, figures S4 and S5). In 
low and middle income countries, the corresponding 
years of functioning lost were 2.6 (0.2 to 6.8) for men 
and 2.7 (1.0 to 5.5) for women. Within high income 
countries, years of functioning lost attributable to 
low socioeconomic status by age 60 were greater in 
the United States than in Europe (see supplementary 
appendix 3, figures S6 and S7): 19.7 (13.2 to 27.4) v 
6.0 (3.8 to 12.1) for men and 15.8 (10.8 to 21.4) v 3.9 
(2.6 to 7.2) for women. This was also the case for years 
of functioning lost attributable to other risk factors, in 
particular current smoking and high alcohol intake.
In a sensitivity analysis including participants who 
used walking aids, the number of years of functioning 
lost attributable to risk factors by age 60 did not 
materially differ from those reported in the main 
analysis (see supplementary appendix 3, figure S8). 
In supplementary multivariate analyses, adjusting 
for physical inactivity, ethnicity, or health status (see 
supplementary appendix 3, table S2-S4), or for the 
number of other risk factors to which participants were 
exposed (see supplementary appendix 3, table S6), 
years of functioning lost attributable to the risk factors 
by age 60 did not differ from those reported in the main 
analysis.
In an additional analysis where the maximum 
number of participants for each risk factor was used 
irrespective of the availability of socioeconomic status 
data (see supplementary appendix 3, table S5), the 
estimated years of functioning lost attributable to the 
non-communicable disease risk factors by age 60 did 
not differ from those reported in the main analysis. The 
association between obesity and walking speed was 
little changed at age 60 after inclusion of underweight 
participants in the reference group (see supplementary 
appendix 3, table S7).
Figure 4 shows years of functioning lost due to 
suboptimal risk factors by age 85. Walking speed 
continued to decrease as a function of risk factors 
between ages 60 and 85 (see supplementary appendix 
3, figure S1), in particular for those of low versus high 
socioeconomic status (11.1 (95% confidence interval 
7.1 to 15.7) years of functioning lost at age 85 for men 
and 6.7 (4.5 to 11.2) for women) and for those with 
insufficient versus sufficient physical activity (16.7 
(10.5 to 25.8) years of functioning lost at age 85 for 
men and 16.3 (10.7 to 24.8) for women).
Years of life lost between ages 60 and 85
Years of functioning lost were greater than years of 
life lost due to low socioeconomic status and non-
communicable disease risk factors. Between ages 60 
and 85 years, low socioeconomic status was associated 
with a loss of 0.6 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.9)

discussion
Based on individual level data from 37 cohort studies 
and more than 109 000 adults, our analyses showed 
that 
adverse 
socioeconomic 
circumstances 
and 
exposure to major non-communicable disease risk 
factors are robustly associated with loss in physical 
functioning from early to a more advanced old age. By 
age 60, about six years of good physical functioning 
were lost due to poor socioeconomic circumstances. 
The years of functioning lost were comparable (ie, 
5-7 years) for obesity, diabetes, and insufficient 
physical activity, and lower (between <1 and 3 
years) for tobacco smoking, hypertension, and high 
alcohol intake. Exposure to adverse socioeconomic 
circumstances and the non-communicable disease 
risk factors continued to be associated with physical 
functioning after age 60, with increasing differences 
in functioning between exposed and unexposed 
groups at age 85. Years of functioning lost at older ages 
generally exceeded the years of life lost, suggesting 
that an exclusive focus on morbidity and mortality 
might lead to underestimation of the potential benefits 
of targeting poor socioeconomic circumstances and 
risk factors highlighted in global health strategies. 
The years of functioning lost due to these factors were 
particularly large in high income countries.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
We used walking speed to assess physical functional 
capacity. Previous research has shown that walking 
speed declines with age and is an independent 
predictor of survival, functional limitations, hospital 
admission, and cognitive decline.19 22 23 Compared 
with other measures of physical functioning, such as 
grip strength, walking speed requires the coordinated 
action of several different physical systems, including 
the nervous, musculoskeletal, and cardiopulmonary 
systems.37 Furthermore, walking speed is widely 
used in aging research as it is easily measurable in 
population surveys as well as in clinical settings. 
However, heterogeneity did exist in the measurement 
of walking speed between studies, which we partially 
accounted for through a mixed statistical modelling 
framework. Since walking speed is unlikely to capture 
all important aspects of “overall functional capacity,” 
further research with other indicators of physical 
functioning, such as grip strength and lung function 
would provide a useful comparison.
As our analyses relied on cross sectional data, these 
findings should be interpreted cautiously and should 
not be considered as causal estimates of the impact of 
socioeconomic status on health. For example, selection 
bias would attenuate observed associations if non-
participation in studies was greater among those with

poor functioning. Similarly, physical inactivity and 
obesity may be both a cause and a consequence of 
impaired mobility, potentially inflating the observed 
associations. However, our findings highlight the 
potential importance of socioeconomic status for 
physical functioning at older ages, and motivate 
further research to establish the causal nature of the 
observed associations. Randomised trials and quasi-
experimental studies are required to evaluate the extent 
to which intervening on socioeconomic adversity and 
standard non-communicable disease risk factors might 
improve functional capacity in old age.
Occupational class was used as an indicator of 
socioeconomic status, as there were data available 
for this measure across the cohorts included in our 
study and occupational class was comparable between 
countries. Occupational class may not entirely reflect 
current socioeconomic conditions, particularly for 
older participants, although pensions and benefits 
after retirement are often a function of employment 
during active life. Since we compared the associations 
of low socioeconomic status with those of major non-
communicable disease risk factors that are currently 
targeted by global health strategies, we did not include 
additional factors that might also affect functional 
capacity, such as psychosocial stress, social isolation, 
and exposure to environmental pollutants; the effects 
of these factors are an important topic of further 
studies.
Socioeconomic 
status 
and 
non-communicable 
disease risk factors were assessed using broad 
categorisations, and for some of the cohort studies 
only self reported data were available. Furthermore, 
the success in harmonisation varied between cohort 
studies depending on the availability of data. As 
a result misclassifications might exist, potentially 
underestimating or overestimating the associations 
between socioeconomic status, non-communicable 
disease risk factors, and physical functioning.
Comparison with previous studies
Our study shows that the number of years of functioning 
lost due to adverse socioeconomic circumstances is 
comparable to or larger than the number of years lost 
due to major risk factors for chronic diseases, such 
as insufficient physical activity, diabetes, obesity, 
and tobacco consumption. Interestingly, this pattern 
persisted in models that controlled for all risk factors 
simultaneously. Risk factors, including socioeconomic 
adversity, tend to cluster in the same individuals, 
but our findings suggest that the association of low 
socioeconomic status with physical functioning is not 
attributable to non-communicable disease risk factors.
Years of functioning lost due to low socioeconomic 
status were greater in high income countries than in low 
to middle income countries. A potential explanation 
of this finding includes regional differences in the 
social patterning of major risk factors, such as physical 
inactivity, obesity, and diabetes. Unlike in high 
income countries, lower socioeconomic status is not 
always associated with a higher prevalence of these 
risk factors in low to middle income countries.38 39 In 
addition, classifying individuals into occupational 
classes in low to middle income countries is difficult 
as large fractions of the population have informal jobs 
or employment contracts, and misclassification of 
occupational class may have attenuated the observed 
associations. Furthermore, life expectancy is shorter 
in low to middle income countries and this may lead 
to greater selection bias attenuating associations in 
studies from these countries.
Insufficient physical activity, obesity, and diabetes 
were strong independent predictors of loss of functional 
capacity (5-7 years of functioning lost), whereas the 
association of tobacco consumption, high alcohol 
intake, and hypertension with loss of functional 
capacity was weaker (0-3 years of functioning lost). 
The result was expected, given the adverse impact of 
insufficient physical activity, obesity, and diabetes 
on the musculoskeletal system. Our findings are 
consistent with studies showing that physical activity 
might improve physical performance15 40 even at older 
ages,41-43 although part of the observed effect is also 
likely to be due to a reverse causation process whereby 
decreasing mobility induces reductions in physical 
activity. Our study confirms the existing literature 
linking obesity and diabetes to walking performances, 
the plausible underlying mechanisms including the 
excess risk of osteoarthritis in the legs44 and lower 
extremity function in people aged 45-90 with obesity 
and diabetes.45
Meaning of the study
Our findings suggest that policies to deal with poor 
socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to common 
non-communicable disease risk factors, might be 
critical to strategies for the promotion of healthy 
aging. As such, this study supports the hypothesis 
that a successful implementation of the WHO Global 
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-
Communicable Diseases and policies to reduce 
socioeconomic adversity might benefit physical 
functioning of the population. As with standard 
non-communicable diseases risk factors, the social 
environment is modifiable by policies at the local, 
national, and international levels.46 47 Examples 
of potential interventions include promoting early 
childhood development, tackling poverty and living 
circumstances, ensuring that all children have access 
to high quality education, and creating safe school 
and work environments by legislation.48 49 Given that 
the present study is based on observational data, 
our study informs about associations but cannot 
provide evidence of causality. Further research is 
needed to determine whether interventions targeting 
non-communicable disease risk factors and adverse 
socioeconomic circumstances early in life can 
potentially slow functional decline.
Conclusions and implications for future research
Current global health policies are targeted towards 
established risk factors of health, such as smoking and

physical inactivity. Much of the evidence of the benefits 
of reducing these factors involve hard endpoints, such 
as mortality and morbidity, whereas few studies have 
focused on additional intervention targets such as 
socioeconomic circumstances, or broader measures 
of wellbeing, such as physical functioning. Our 
findings from cohort studies in Europe, the United 
States, Latin America, Africa, and Asia address this 
limitation and show comparable associations of 
adverse socioeconomic circumstances and standard 
non-communicable disease risk factors with reduced 
walking speed, a measure of physical functioning 
from early old age onwards. Years of functioning lost 
were greater than years of life lost due to these risk 
factors. This evidence calls for interventional research 
on potential benefits of broader health policies dealing 
with socioeconomic adversity, in addition to standard 
risk factors.
