Summary
Although all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is a key regulator of intestinal immunity, its role in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We found that mice with colitis-associated CRC had a 
marked deficiency in colonic atRA due to alterations in atRA metabolism mediated by microbiota-
induced intestinal inflammation. Human ulcerative colitis (UC), UC-associated CRC, and sporadic 
CRC specimens have similar alterations in atRA metabolic enzymes, consistent with reduced 
colonic atRA. Inhibition of atRA signaling promoted tumorigenesis whereas atRA 
supplementation reduced tumor burden. The benefit of atRA treatment was mediated by cytotoxic 
CD8+ T cells, activated due to MHCI upregulation on tumor cells. Consistent with these findings, 
increased colonic expression of the atRA-catabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, correlated with reduced 
frequencies of tumoral cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and with worse disease prognosis in human CRC.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the U.S. (Haggar 
and Boushey, 2009), and ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory condition of the 
colon, has been shown to predispose individuals to CRC (Ullman and Itzkowitz, 2011). 
Despite advances in therapy, however, 20–30% of UC patients still undergo colectomy 
because they are refractory to current therapy or because they have developed CRC. 
Unfortunately, surgery is often associated with significant postoperative morbidities (Biondi 
et al., 2012). Thus, there remains an urgent need for improved therapy and effective 
chemoprophylaxis in UC and UC-associated cancer.
The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) is required for several crucial 
physiological processes (Clagett-Dame and DeLuca, 2002; Mark et al., 2006; Obrochta et 
al., 2015). In recent years, atRA has been shown to regulate both the innate and adaptive 
immune systems and, in particular, to play a requisite role in shaping intestinal immunity 
(Cassani et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2011b). atRA maintains immune homeostasis in the 
intestinal lamina propria mainly by potentiating the induction and maintenance of regulatory 
T-cells and reciprocally inhibiting the development of Th17 cells (Benson et al., 2007; 
Cassani et al., 2012; Coombes et al., 2007; Mucida et al., 2007). Additionally, in certain 
pathological settings, atRA can also elicit proinflammatory effector T-cell responses (Allie 
et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2011a). However, despite the 
critical influence of atRA on intestinal immunity, its role in CRC has not been previously 
investigated.

 We hypothesized that a local deficiency of atRA might promote the development of CRC, 
especially in the context of intestinal inflammation. Therefore, we studied atRA metabolism 
in colitis-associated CRC. Our findings reveal a link between microbiota-induced intestinal 
inflammation, atRA deficiency, and CRC in mice and humans, as well as a strong anti-tumor 
effect of atRA mediated through CD8+ effector T-cells.
Results
Mice with colitis-associated cancer are deficient in colonic atRA due to altered atRA 
metabolism
To investigate the role of atRA metabolism in CRC development, we used a mouse model 
that recapitulates progression from colitis to cancer: the AOM-DSS model (Tanaka et al., 
2003). In this model, the colonotropic carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) is combined with 
the inflammatory agent dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce chronic intestinal 
inflammation and tumor formation in the distal colons of mice within nine to ten weeks, 
with dysplasia appearing as early as week three. In contrast, mice administered DSS alone 
develop chronic colitis without tumorigenesis (Wirtz et al., 2007).
In line with our hypothesis that a local deficiency of atRA might promote the development 
of CRC, colonic atRA levels, as measured by quantitative mass spectrometry, were 
significantly reduced in mice with colitis-associated cancer (CAC) as early as four weeks 
after AOM-DSS induction, when mice had chronic inflammation with dysplastic changes in 
the colon. atRA levels further declined to approximately half the normal colonic atRA level 
by week nine, when carcinomas became apparent (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). To 
investigate whether this deficiency could result from altered expression of atRA metabolic 
enzymes, we analyzed the colonic expression of key enzymes that function in the synthesis 
of atRA—the retinaldehyde dehydrogenases, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3—and 
the catabolism of atRA—the cytochrome p450 (CYP) family members, CYP26A1, 
CYP26B1, and CYP26C1—during progression from colitis to cancer. Because ALDH1A1 is 
the most abundantly expressed ALDH1A isoform in the normal mouse colon (data not 
shown), and CYP26A1 is the most catalytically active of the three CYP26 enzymes 
(Kedishvili, 2013), we focused our analyses on these enzymes. Colonic ALDH1A1 protein 
expression declined in mice with chronic colitis and in mice with CAC throughout disease 
progression, ultimately decreasing by 50–70% compared to age-matched normal mice 
(Figure 1B–D and Figure S1B,C). This reduction was also observed at the transcript level 
(Figure 1E,F). ALDH1A2 protein expression remained unchanged (Figure S1D), whereas 
ALDH1A3 was consistently decreased during disease progression (Figure S1E).
In contrast to the atRA synthesis enzymes, the colonic transcript levels of the atRA 
catabolizing enzyme CYP26A1 were increased four-fold in mice with chronic colitis (Figure 
1G), and three-to eight-fold (depending on the CYP26 isoform) in mice with CAC. 
Upregulation was observed as early as one week after AOM-DSS induction, with levels 
declining thereafter (Figure 1H and Figure S1F,G).
We next sought to partition out the contribution of various cell types to the colonic atRA 
deficiency. Although Aldh1a1 expression was reduced in colonic epithelial cells, T-cells, and

 macrophages or dendritic cells in CAC mice (Figure 1I), Cyp26a1 expression was increased 
only in the epithelial compartment (Figure 1J). Given the relative abundance of epithelial 
cells compared to immune cells (Figure 1K) and the observation that epithelial cells exhibit 
alterations in both Aldh1a1 and Cyp26a1, the atRA deficiency observed in colitis or CAC 
can largely be attributed to the epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
mice with CAC have a marked decrease in colonic atRA as a result of a decrease in the 
atRA-synthesizing ALDH1A enzymes and an increase in the atRA-catabolizing CYP26 
enzymes.
Abnormal atRA metabolism is a common feature of ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer 
in humans
To assess whether atRA deficiency is present in UC-associated CRC, we examined the 
expression of ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 in colonic resections from UC and UC-associated 
CRC patients. In specimens from UC patients, there was a significant decrease in 
ALDH1A1 and a corresponding increase in CYP26A1 in colitis regions compared to 
matched uninvolved regions of tissue (Figure 2A,B) and in dysplastic tissue compared to 
matched colitis tissue (Figure 2C,D). ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 were also lower and higher, 
respectively, in colon adenocarcinomas compared to matched normal regions (Figure 2E,F). 
Using a tissue microarray, we found that the same ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 differential 
expression was conserved in sporadic adenocarcinomas compared to normal colons and 
adenomas (Figure 2G,H). Transcript expression of ALDH1A1 was also decreased and 
CYP26A1 increased in colon cancer specimens from an independent microarray dataset, 
GSE39582 (Figure 2I) (Marisa et al., 2013).
These findings show that patients with sporadic CRC, UC and UC-associated CRC have 
similar alterations in atRA metabolism in affected tissues, consistent with the reduced 
colonic levels of atRA observed in the mouse model of CAC.
Inflammation triggered by intestinal microbiota induces atRA enzyme alteration in mice 
with CAC
To investigate whether atRA deficiency can exacerbate CRC tumorigenesis, we treated mice 
with the pan-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) inverse agonist BMS493 (Germain et al., 2009) 
four weeks prior to and throughout disease progression following AOM-DSS induction. This 
treatment led to a significant increase in tumor burden (Figure 3A), compelling us to 
investigate the mechanism responsible for the atRA enzyme deregulation observed in mice 
with CAC. Several investigators have demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic effects of intestinal 
microbiota in CRC (Arthur et al., 2012; Couturier-Maillard et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2013), 
with broad-spectrum antibiotics dramatically reducing tumor incidence in animal models of 
CRC, including the AOM-DSS model (Grivennikov et al., 2012; Zackular et al., 2013). We 
therefore hypothesized that bacterial influx into the colon, due to defective barrier 
permeability, could induce colonic atRA enzyme alteration in the context of colitis and 
CRC. In accord with our hypothesis, pretreatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics 
completely prevented both the decrease in Aldh1a1 and increase in Cyp26a1 in mice with 
CAC (Figure 3B and Figure S2A,B). Antibiotic-treated AOM-DSS mice also exhibited

 significantly increased body weights and dramatically reduced tumor burdens compared to 
untreated AOM-DSS mice (Figure S2C,D).
Having demonstrated that atRA enzymes are altered not only in CAC but also during chronic 
colitis (Figure 1), we hypothesized that inflammation driven by gut microbiota could 
contribute to the altered enzyme expression. In line with our hypothesis, the colons of 
antibiotic-treated AOM-DSS mice not only had healthier colitis scores compared to 
untreated AOM-DSS mice (Figure 3C and Figure S2E), but also showed a striking reduction 
in the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-17A, 
IL-12, IL-6 and IL-23) (Figure S2F). To test whether these proinflammatory cytokines could 
be altering atRA enzymes in colitis or CAC, we asked whether culturing epithelial organoids 
with these cytokines, or whether injecting these cytokines into the mucosal wall of the distal 
colon of antibiotic-treated mice (Figure S2G), could alter the expression of Aldh1a1 and 
Cyp26a1. In both contexts, the proinflammatory cytokines induced a significant decrease in 
Aldh1a1 and increase in Cyp26a1 (Figure 3D,E).
Next, we investigated the cell types responsible for secreting the various proinflammatory 
cytokines in the colons of mice with CAC. The myeloid compartment secreted a wide range 
of these cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12, while the epithelial cells 
secreted TNFα and T-cells secreted IL-17A (Figure 3F and Figure S2H). Antibiotic 
treatment not only markedly reduced cytokine secretion from all these cell types, but also 
substantially reduced immune cell infiltration into the colon (Figure 3F,G and Figure S2H). 
These results show that expression of the atRA metabolic enzymes is altered by 
inflammatory cytokines released from colonic epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells 
in response to the influx of gut microbiota across a defective mucosal barrier.
atRA supplementation decreases tumor burden in mice with CAC
Given the altered atRA metabolism in AOM-DSS mice as well as in human CRC, we 
assessed whether treatment with atRA could decrease tumor burden. We used two distinct 
methods for this purpose: 1) intraperitoneal injection of atRA and 2) oral administration of 
Liarozole, an inhibitor of the CYP26 enzymes that catabolize atRA (Van Wauwe et al., 
1990). Liarozole’s ability to increase available endogenous atRA was demonstrated in vitro 
using RARE-luciferase assays (Figure S3A,B) on two colon cancer cell lines, MC38 and 
CT26, and in vivo via mass spectrometry of colons of AOM-DSS mice orally gavaged with 
Liarozole (Figure S3C). atRA was administered to AOM-DSS mice either starting early, 
when acute colitis was established, or later, after dysplastic changes had occurred in the 
colon. In both cases, tumor burden in atRA-treated mice was reduced by more than half 
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 4A,B). Consistent with atRA treatment, Liarozole 
treatment also resulted in a 50% reduction in tumor burden (Figure 4C). These data 
demonstrate a robust therapeutic benefit conferred by atRA supplementation.
atRA treatment elicits a pronounced CD8+ T-cell response in mice with CAC
Next, we sought to identify the mechanism responsible for the anti-tumor effect of atRA. 
Since CD8+ T-cells play a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity, we examined the CD8+ T-cell 
response in AOM-DSS mice treated with atRA. A significant increase in the percentage of

 CD8+ T-cells expressing the early activation marker CD69 was seen in tumors and MLNs in 
atRA-treated mice (Figure 5A,B and Figure S4A). The atRA-mediated increase in activated 
CD8+ T-cells was more pronounced in the lamina propria (LP) than the intra-epithelial 
lymphocyte (IEL) layer of the tumor (Figure 5C). In addition, the percentage of proliferating 
intratumoral CD8+ T-cells nearly doubled in atRA-treated mice (Figure 5D). Thus, a robust 
CD8+ T-cell response is induced by atRA treatment of mice with CAC.
The anti-tumor effect of atRA is CD8+ T-cell dependent
To determine the functional relevance of the CD8+ T-cell response elicited by atRA 
treatment, we evaluated the therapeutic benefit of atRA in AOM-DSS mice depleted of 
CD8+ T-cells (Figure S4B) as well as in CD8-deficient (Cd8a−/−) mice. atRA had no effect 
on tumor burden in either CD8+ T-cell-depleted mice or Cd8a−/− mice (Figure 5E,H), 
demonstrating that the therapeutic effect of atRA is dependent on CD8+ T-cells. Consistent 
with this idea, we observed a four-fold increase in tumor cell death in atRA-treated AOM-
DSS mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 5F,G), with CD8+ T-cells in close 
proximity to TUNEL+ tumor cells in the atRA-treated condition (Figure S4C). This increase 
in tumor cell death was completely abrogated in CD8+ T-cell-depleted mice (Figure 5F,G). 
Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of atRA treatment in Cd8a−/− mice was restored upon 
adoptive transfer of CD8+ T-cells (Figure 5H and Figure S4D). Although mature CD4+ T-
cells can be reprogrammed in an atRA-dependent manner into MHCII-restricted CD8αα+ 
IELs with cytotoxic functions (Mucida et al., 2013; Reis et al., 2014), in the context of CAC, 
atRA treatment did not increase the frequency of this cell type (Figure S4E). These results 
therefore demonstrate that the therapeutic benefit conferred by atRA is dependent on CD8+ 
T-cells.
A detailed analysis of CD4+ T-cells did not reveal any significant changes in the number 
(Figure S5A) or activation status of these cells in the tumors and MLNs of atRA-treated 
mice (Figure S5B,C). Moreover, CD4+ T-cells isolated from the tumor or surrounding tissue 
from atRA-treated mice did not show any differences in TNFα, IFNγ, or IL-17A secretion 
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure S5D,E). Interestingly, there was a significant 
increase in the frequency of CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in tumors of atRA-
treated mice (Figure S5F); however, this increase in tumoral Treg cells was observed in 
atRA-treated Cd8a−/− mice as well (Figure S5G), which are refractory to the therapeutic 
benefit of atRA, indicating that the anti-tumor effect of atRA is not mediated through Treg 
cells alone.
In a study in mice with DSS-induced colitis, atRA supplementation suppressed colitis by 
inducing γδ+ T-cells to secrete IL-22 (Mielke et al., 2013). However, in our studies, atRA 
treatment of Tcrd−/− mice still significantly decreased tumor burden, indicating that γδ+ T-
cells are not required for the anti-tumor effect of atRA (Figure S5H). Nonetheless, we 
observed that the colonic tissue surrounding the tumoral regions in atRA-treated mice had 
reduced inflammation scores, which could contribute to the atRA-mediated reduction in 
tumor burden in parallel with the CD8+ T-cell mechanism (Figure S5I,J).

 atRA upregulates MHCI expression on tumor epithelial cells to promote T-cell cytotoxicity
Given that CD8+ T-cells are the dominant mediator of the anti-tumor effect of atRA, we 
sought to determine the mechanistic basis of the CD8+ T-cell-dependent effect of atRA 
treatment on CAC. Since CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity is MHC class I-restricted, we 
analyzed the expression of MHCI on the tumor epithelial cells before and after atRA 
treatment and found that mice treated with atRA exhibited a significant increase in MHCI 
(Figure 6A and Figure S6A). Interestingly, this atRA-mediated increase in MHCI was 
abrogated when the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) was deleted from intestinal 
epithelial cells using Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl mice (Figure 6B). In line with the direct mode of 
action of atRA on tumor epithelial cells, exogenous addition of atRA to the human colon 
cancer cell line Caco-2 in vitro also increased MHCI expression (Figure 6C).
Next, we considered the possibility that increased MHCI expression on tumor epithelial cells 
could render them more susceptible to CD8+ cytotoxic-T-cell killing. Indeed, Vil1-cre-
Rarafl/fl mice that lack the atRA-mediated upregulation of MHCI were resistant to the anti-
tumor effects of atRA (Figure 6D). Consistent with this, intratumoral CD8+ T-cells in atRA-
treated AOM-DSS wild-type mice expressed higher levels of granzyme B, indicating 
increased cytotoxic activity (Figure 6E and Figure S6B), which was not seen in Vil1-cre-
Rarafl/fl mice (Figure 6F). Consequently, untreated Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl mice induced with 
AOM-DSS had a trend toward a higher tumor burden than control mice (Figure S6C). To 
determine if atRA acted on epithelial cells, and not myeloid cells or CD8+ T-cells, to 
mediate its anti-tumor effects, we tested whether mice lacking RARα expression in 
macrophages (Lyz2-cre-Rarafl/fl mice), dendritic cells (Itgax-cre-Rarafl/fl mice) and CD8+ T-
cells (through adoptive transfer of CD8+ T-cells from Cd4-cre-Rarafl/fl mice into Cd8a−/− 
mice, as CD8+ T-cells in these mice lack the receptor due to cre expression in the double-
positive thymocytes) were responsive to the anti-tumor effects of atRA. Importantly, all of 
the aforementioned mice exhibited lower tumor burdens upon atRA treatment, confirming 
that the anti-tumor effect of atRA was not dependent on direct effects of atRA on these cell 
types (Figure S6D–F). These results demonstrate that atRA acts directly on tumor epithelial 
cells to upregulate MHCI, thereby rendering them sensitive to CD8+ T-cell-mediated killing.
To assess our findings in another model of CRC, we investigated whether the MC38 
subcutaneous tumor model was similarly responsive to atRA through a CD8+ T-cell-
mediated mechanism. In line with our observations from the AOM-DSS model, we found 
that, while wild-type mice subcutaneously implanted with MC38 were responsive to the 
anti-tumor effect of atRA, Cd8a−/− mice were not (Figure S7A,B). Moreover, atRA-treated 
MC38 tumor mice had a significantly higher expression of MHCI on their tumor cells 
compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure S7C).
CYP26A1 in colon carcinoma correlates with reduced cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell frequency and 
worse disease prognosis
The findings from our mouse studies suggest that intestinal atRA deficiency dampens the 
CD8+ T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses, which is known to correlate with overall 
survival in CRC (Deschoolmeester et al., 2010; Galon et al., 2006; Koelzer et al., 2014). We 
therefore correlated ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 expression in each core biopsy from the

 sporadic colon cancer tissue microarray with tumoral CD8+ T-cell density and granzyme B 
expression to determine if atRA metabolism could predict cytotoxic T-cell potential. Indeed, 
there was a significant negative correlation between CYP26A1 expression and both tumoral 
CD8+ T-cell density (Figure 7A–C) and percentage of CD8+ T-cells expressing granzyme B 
in CRC specimens (Figure 7A,B and D). We found no significant correlation with 
ALDH1A1 (data not shown). We also tested whether ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 mRNA 
expression correlates with disease prognosis using the GSE39582 dataset (Marisa et al., 
2013). This dataset has a large number of CRC samples obtained from a multi-center cohort 
(n=566) containing information on overall survival and disease-free survival. Although 
ALDH1A1 expression did not correlate with disease prognosis, CYP26A1 expression 
correlated inversely with both overall survival and disease-free survival (Figure 7E,F).
Discussion
atRA has shown promise in the treatment of several malignancies. In acute promyelocytic 
leukemia, it is known to act by inducing post-maturation apoptosis of the leukemic cells 
(Jimenez-Lara et al., 2004). Despite its established regulatory role in intestinal immunity, the 
influence of atRA on CRC development has not been previously examined. Our findings 
reveal that mice with CAC have significantly reduced levels of atRA in their colons due to a 
marked decrease in atRA-synthesizing ALDH1A enzymes and an increase in atRA-
catabolizing CYP26 enzymes, imputing an important role to atRA in CRC.
Direct evidence of the adverse effect of an atRA deficit was demonstrated in mice with 
CAC. In these mice, further inhibition of atRA signaling increased tumor burden, while, 
conversely, atRA supplementation reduced tumor burden. Interestingly, depletion of the 
intestinal microbiota in AOM-DSS mice prevented the alteration of the atRA enzymes. The 
absence of intestinal bacteria in germ-free mice and antibiotic-treated mice has been 
demonstrated to dramatically reduce tumor formation in several models of CRC 
(Grivennikov et al., 2012; Zackular et al., 2013). Increased inflammation and production of 
genotoxic metabolites are among the mechanisms by which microbiota potentiate colon 
carcinogenesis (Belcheva et al., 2014; Grivennikov, 2013). However, our study demonstrates 
yet another mechanism by which intestinal microbiota may promote CRC—by altering atRA 
metabolism.
An important finding of our study is that CRC patients have similar alterations in atRA 
metabolism in their tumors irrespective of whether they had a history of colitis. High inter-
patient variability in our tissue microarray analysis of ALDH1A1 and CYP26A1 in sporadic 
colon carcinomas and adenomas may reflect differences in the extent of barrier permeability 
or associated inflammation. Similarly, adenocarcinomas may exhibit lower expression of 
epithelial tight junction proteins and greater barrier permeability compared to adenomas, 
possibly explaining the more pronounced enzyme changes in carcinomas (Nakayama et al., 
2008; Soler et al., 1999). Nevertheless, when compared with normal colonic mucosa, colitis, 
dysplasia and colon carcinoma are all characterized by a decrease in ALDH1A1 and a 
concomitant increase in the CYP26A1, indicative of reduced colonic levels of atRA. These 
findings are in accord with recent investigations of sporadic CRC (Kropotova et al., 2014), 
including a study demonstrating that CYP26B1 expression directly correlates with disease

 prognosis (Brown et al., 2014). In the present study, we found a significant correlation 
between CYP26A1 transcript expression and both overall survival and disease-free survival 
in a multi-center cohort of CRC patients (Marisa et al., 2013). Our findings that abnormal 
atRA metabolism correlates with clinical prognosis and is present across most pre-neoplastic 
and neoplastic conditions of the colon, combined with the observed exacerbation of disease 
in mice with CAC upon inhibition of atRA signaling and the therapeutic benefit of atRA 
supplementation, suggest that atRA deficiency is an important factor in the pathogenesis of 
CRC.
A number of possible mechanisms might explain the beneficial anti-tumor effect of atRA. In 
a mouse model of Crohn’s disease, atRA supplementation attenuated disease progression by 
promoting Treg cell-mediated intestinal tolerance (Collins et al., 2011). In another study, 
atRA supplementation ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, but through a mechanism that was 
γδ+ T cell-dependent. (Mielke et al., 2013). However, in our studies, the anti-tumor effect of 
atRA was found to be independent of γδ+ T-cells. Since in vitro studies have shown that 
atRA can induce apoptosis of colon cancer cell lines, albeit at high non-physiological 
concentrations (Bengtsson et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2000), we considered the possibility that 
the therapeutic benefit of atRA was due to a direct apoptotic effect on the tumor cells. In our 
studies, atRA treatment did lead to tumor cell apoptosis in vivo, but, surprisingly, the 
therapeutic effect of atRA was mediated by CD8+ T-cells rather than through a direct anti-
tumor effect.
Previous studies have shown that atRA can elicit CD4+ or CD8+ effector T-cell responses in 
the context of infection (Guo et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2011b). Here, in CAC, we found that 
atRA treatment led to an increase in tumoral CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, 
using Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl mice we found that atRA treatment directly acts on tumor epithelial 
cells to upregulate MHCI expression, thereby rendering them more susceptible to killing by 
CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Consistent with this mechanism, previous in vitro studies 
have demonstrated that MHCI is a direct transcriptional target of atRA (Balmer and 
Blomhoff, 2002; Jansa and Forejt, 1996; Nagata et al., 1992). Untreated Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl 
mice induced with AOM-DSS did not develop more tumors than control mice, but since 
mice with CAC already have dramatically reduced levels of atRA, the absence of RARα on 
epithelial cells likely would have had little impact on tumor burden.
Our findings from the mouse model of CAC suggest that atRA deficiency in human CRC 
could impair effector cytotoxic T-cell function, resulting in accelerated growth of tumors. 
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found a strong negative correlation between abnormal 
atRA metabolism and both tumoral CD8+ T-cell frequency and granzyme B expression in 
human CRC. Several studies have shown that infiltration of T-cells, especially CD8+ T-cells, 
as well as MHCI expression by tumor cells, correlates with improved CRC prognosis 
(Deschoolmeester et al., 2010; Galon et al., 2006; Koelzer et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 
2010). Our work not only provides a potential explanation for these phenomena, but also 
suggests that restoration of atRA levels in the colon could provide a therapeutic benefit in 
human CRC by promoting MHCI expression by tumor cells and cytotoxic T-cell function.

 Experimental Procedures
Patient specimens
Patient specimens were obtained from the Stanford Tissue Bank and from the Toronto 
General Hospital (Ontario, Canada) under protocols approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB, Stanford) and the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (Toronto 
General Hospital).
Mice
C57BL/6 mice, Cd8a−/−, Vil1-cre mice, Lyz2-cre mice, Cd4-cre mice and Tcrd−/− mice were 
from The Jackson Laboratory. Rarafl/fl mice were a kind gift from Dr. Yasmine Belkaid 
(NIAID, Bethesda, MD).
DSS and AOM-DSS mouse models
The DSS and AOM-DSS mouse models of chronic colitis and CAC, respectively, were 
established using the protocol described by Wirtz et al. (Wirtz et al., 2007), with slight 
modifications. In brief, for the development of chronic colitis, mice were given 3% DSS salt 
in drinking water for 7 days, followed by drinking water for 14 days. This cycle was 
repeated twice. For CAC, mice were given an initial i.p. injection of AOM at the beginning 
of the chronic colitis protocol.
Antibiotic treatment of AOM-DSS mice
Antibiotics were supplied in water before induction with AOM-DSS. The antibiotics used 
were ampicillin (1g/L), metronidazole (1g/L), vancomycin (0.5 g/L), and neomycin (1g/L) 
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Bacterial culture on Agar plates
Fecal extract from antibiotic-treated mice were cultured on LB Agar and Blood Agar (TSA 
with 5% Sheep Blood) plates.
atRA treatment of Caco-2 cell line
Caco-2 cells were cultured in complete EMEM medium and treated with 1μM atRA or 
DMSO. They were harvested for analysis 72 hrs later.
Luciferase assay
CT26 or MC38 cells were transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a 
pGL3-RARE-responsive promoter (Addgene) and a renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. atRA 
or vehicle was added along with increasing amounts of Liarozole, and the activity of both 
reporters was recorded.
Intramucosal colonic injections
Antibiotic-treated C57BL/6 mice were injected intramucosally in the distal colon with a 
cytokine mixture containing 100ng each of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-6, IFNγ and

 IL-17A (Peprotech) or 1% BSA in PBS (vehicle), and the distal colonic tissues were 
collected for qRT-PCR analyses.
Intestinal organoid culture and cytokine treatment
Organoids derived from tumors of AOM-DSS mice were cultured with a cytokine mixture 
containing 50ng/mL each of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-23, IL-6, IFNγ or 1% BSA in PBS 
(vehicle) for 48 hrs and then harvested for qRT-PCR analyses.
Quantitation of all-trans retinoic acid expression in mouse colonic tissue
atRA was extracted from mouse colons as described (Kane et al., 2008). Quantification of 
retinoids was done using LC-MS/MS with an alternate LC separation.
Drug treatment
200μg BMS493 (Tocris Bioscience) or DMSO alone (vehicle) was i.p. injected into female 
C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks prior to induction with AOM-DSS and continued until the end of the 
AOM-DSS treatment period. 200μg atRA or DMSO alone (vehicle) was i.p. injected into 
AOM-DSS mice either twice a week or every other day. 80 ppm Liarozole (Tocris 
Bioscience) was incorporated into a base diet containing 4 IU/g of vitamin A (Research 
Diets). Mice were orally gavaged with 400μg Liarozole or polyethylene glycol-200 (vehicle) 
after induction with AOM-DSS daily until the end of week 4.
CD8+ T-cell depletion
500μg rat anti-mouse CD8α antibody (clone YTS169.4, BioXCell) was injected i.p. into 10-
week-old C57BL/6 female mice once a week, from week 4 to week 9 after disease 
induction. The control group received the same amount of isotype control antibody (clone 
LTF2, BioXCell).
Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T-cells into Cd8a−/− mice
CD8+ T-cells were isolated from the spleen, MLNs and other lymph nodes from DSS-treated 
C57BL/6 mice and adoptively transferred into Cd8a−/− mice (8×106 cells per mouse) 2 
weeks after induction with AOM-DSS (Figure S4D). atRA or vehicle was administered 
every other day to recipient mice from the day of adoptive transfer to the end of week 9.
Immunoblotting
Protein lysates were prepared from the distal half of the colons using RIPA lysis buffer. 
Primary and secondary HRP-labeled antibodies were used at 1:500 and 1:2000 dilutions, 
respectively, in 5% milk in PBS-Tween.
Real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
Transcript expression was determined using the Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix 
(Applied Biosystems) and the 7900HT real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). For 
quantification of 16s rDNA, mouse fecal DNA was extracted using the REDExtract-N-
Amp™ Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma Aldrich) and purified of inhibitors (Zymo Research).

 Histology and Colitis grading
Disease diagnosis and colitis grading of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were 
determined by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist at Stanford University who was 
blinded with respect to treatment. For colitis grading, the scheme from Geboes et al. was 
used (Geboes et al., 2000).
Immunofluorescence staining
OCT-embedded colonic sections were post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 
10% goat serum. They were subsequently stained with primary and secondary antibodies.
Flow cytometry
Isolated colonic and MLN cells were resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1% BSA in 
PBS and stained with antibodies. Flow cytometric data acquisition was performed on a 
LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Statistics
Experimental data were analyzed with the Mann Whitney U-test using Prism (GraphPad 
Software), unless otherwise stated. Tissue microarray data were analyzed using the One-way 
ANOVA test, and correlation analysis was performed using the Pearson’s correlation test. 
Kaplan Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were generated and 
analyzed with Prism (GraphPad software) using the Log-rank (Mantel Cox) test. Results are 
represented as mean ± SEM. p<0.05=*; p<0.01=**; p<0.001=***.
Animal Study Approval
All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Stanford University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

 Figure 4. atRA supplementation decreases tumor burden in AOM-DSS mice
(A,B) Graphs represent tumor analyses in AOM-DSS mice treated with 200μg atRA twice a 
week starting from day 10 (A) or every other day from week 4 (B) after disease induction 
compared to vehicle-treated mice. Representative image of mouse colons from (B). Data 
represent pooled data from 2 independent experiments with n=10 mice per group in (A) and 
n=9–13 mice in (B). (C) Tumor analyses in AOM-DSS mice fed with a diet containing 
Liarozole compared to a control base diet from day 10 after disease induction. 
Representative of 3 independent experiments (n=10 mice per group). Results are represented

 Figure 5. atRA reduces tumor burden in AOM-DSS mice through a CD8+ T-cell-dependent 
mechanism
(A–D) Flow cytometry data of percentages of CD69+ CD8+ T-cells (A,B,C) and Ki67+ 
CD8+ T-cells (D) in tumors (A,D), surrounding distal colonic tissue (A,D), IEL and LP 
layers of the tumors (C) and MLNs (B) of vehicle-or atRA-treated AOM-DSS mice. Data 
were pooled from 3 independent experiments with n=14 mice per group (A) and n=8 mice 
per group (B), and from 2 independent experiments with n=6–10 mice per group (C) and 
n=6 mice per group (D). (E) Tumor analyses of vehicle- or atRA-treated AOM-DSS mice 
injected from week 4 to week 9 with isotype control or anti-CD8α depleting antibody. Data

n=8 mice in the CD8-depleted group. (F) Immunofluorescence images showing EpCAM 
(green), DAPI (blue) and TUNEL (red) in colonic tumor sections from atRA- or vehicle-
treated isotype-injected and CD8-depleted AOM-DSS mice. Representative image from n=6 
per group in the isotype-treated group and n=4 mice in the CD8-depleted group. Scale 
bar=50 μm. (G) Relative number of TUNEL+ cells quantified by normalizing to tumor crypt 
area in (F). (H) Tumor analyses in Cd8a−/− mice induced with AOM-DSS, and Cd8a−/− mice 
adoptively transferred with CD8+ T-cells, treated from week 3 to week 9 with atRA (n=6–9 
mice per group). Results are represented as mean ± SEM. p<0.05=*; p<0.01=**; 
p<0.001=***, Mann Whitney U-test. See also Figure S4 and S5.

 Figure 6. atRA upregulates MHCI expression on tumor epithelial cells, leading to increased 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(A,B) Flow cytometry plots of geometric mean intensity (MFI) of MHCI expression on 
tumor and surrounding epithelial cells (EpCAM+) from atRA- or vehicle-treated normal age-
matched (A) or Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl (B) AOM-DSS mice. Also shown are representative 
histograms of MHCI from the tumor epithelial cells. Data were pooled from 2 independent 
experiments with n=8–9 mice per group. (C) MHCI MFI on Caco-2 cells 72 hrs after in vitro 
treatment with 1 μM atRA compared to vehicle (DMSO). Shown are 3 independent 
experiments and a representative histogram. (D) Tumor analyses of vehicle- or atRA-treated 
Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl mice induced with AOM-DSS. Data were pooled from 2 independent 
experiments with n=8–9 mice per group. (E,F) Flow cytometry data of percentage of 
granzyme B+ CD8+ T-cells in the tumors and surrounding distal colonic tissue from atRA- 
versus vehicle-treated normal age-matched (E) or Vil1-cre-Rarafl/fl (F) AOM-DSS mice. 
Data were pooled from 2 independent experiments with n=6 mice per group. Results are 
represented as mean ± SEM p<0.05=*; p<0.01=**; p<0.001=***, Mann Whitney U-test.

 Figure 7. CYP26A1 in colon carcinoma correlates with reduced CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity as well 
as with worse disease prognosis
(A,B) Representative images of core biopsies of adenocarcinomas showing high and low 
CYP26A1 staining (red) and corresponding serial sections showing CD8+ T-cell staining 
(green) and granzyme B staining (red). Scale bar=50 μm. (C,D) Correlation between 
CYP26A1 staining intensity (in arbitrary units (AU)) and CD8+ T-cell density normalized to 
tumor area (C) and percentage of CD8+ T-cells expressing granzyme B (D) in sporadic
