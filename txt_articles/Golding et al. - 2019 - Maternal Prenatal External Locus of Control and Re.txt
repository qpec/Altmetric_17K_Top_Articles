A personality scale that identifies individuals’ general attitude to what happens to them
as largely a matter of luck or fate or of powerful others (externality) or whether they
feel they can influence the consequences (internality) is known as locus of control
(LOC). A continuous scale can distinguish those who are more external from those
who are more internal. Lower scholastic achievement is associated with externality and
higher achievement with internality, but little is known about the association of parental
LOC on children’s academic performance. Data collected within the Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) are analyzed to assess associations between
mothers’ LOC orientation, measured during pregnancy, and their children’s abilities in
mathematics and science reasoning. We found that maternal external LOC is associated
with lower scores for her child assessed by tests measuring mental arithmetic as well
as understanding of mathematical and scientific concepts. Additionally, we determined
the extent to which three separate sets of factors previously found to positively influence
the developing child’s ability mediate these findings: (a) perinatal and infant exposures,
such as prenatal smoking, binge drinking, consumption of oily fish, and postnatal breast
feeding; (b) parenting attitudes and strategies; and (c) the interface of the parents with
their child’s school. The three factors identify at least 50% of the mechanism by which
maternal externality is associated with poor academic outcomes in her child and may
be candidates for further investigation as possible intervention targets.

INTRODUCTION
As Meadows et al. (2008) have stated: ‘Improving numeracy learning has been a dominant
educational theme throughout the development of statutory education over the last 100 years or
so.’ At an individual level, numeracy has a profound effect on overall quality of life, self−identity
and the capacity to function in an ever more complex world; and at a macro level, the success of

Prenatal LOC/Offspring Math/Science Abilities
society depends on a well−educated, numerate and adaptable
workforce. However, with the recent advent of the digital age
and the need for skilful use of information communications
technology, the importance of children becoming proficient with
numeracy skills is becoming ever more pressing’ (Meadows
et al., 2008). Almost equally important nowadays is the parallel
development of scientific understanding.
In this paper we attempt to determine a pathway to increased
ability in maths and science by assessing ways in which the
mother’s locus of control (LOC) may influence the child’s
outcome. Rotter (1966) first introduced the concept of LOC,
which he defined as follows: ‘Internal versus external control
refers to the degree to which persons expect that a reinforcement
or an outcome of their behavior is contingent on their own
behavior or personal characteristics versus the degree to which
persons expect that the reinforcement or outcome is a function
of chance, luck, fate, is under the control of powerful others, or
is simply unpredictable. Such expectancies may generalize along
a gradient based on the degree of semantic similarity of the
situational cues.’
The introduction of the concept of LOC was greeted positively
by both the psychological and educational communities. One
of the reasons it has maintained its popularity, as reflected
in the well over 17,000 studies that have used it (Nowicki
and Duke, 2016), is because of its association with academic
achievement. In the same year that Rotter introduced the
concept, Coleman et al. (1966) published the results of a national
study of half a million students showing their own LOC to
be one of the best predictors of their academic achievement.
Since that time the LOC, academic achievement association
has been examined in many ways, but most often by simply
correlating students’ LOC orientation with some measure of
academic achievement such as grades or standardized tests.
Two major reviews (Findley and Cooper, 1983; Kalechstein and
Nowicki, 1997) of the LOC, academic achievement association,
separated by nearly a decade and a half, came to almost identical
conclusions: internally controlled children of all ages did better
academically than their externally controlled peers, even when IQ
was controlled for.
While most past studies have concentrated on correlating
individuals’ LOC with some current measure of academic
achievement, others have attempted to use LOC to predict future
outcomes tied to academic achievement. One example was a
study completed by Flouri (2006) who used data from the
British Cohort Study (BCS70), a longitudinal study originating
in 1970 that included a representative sample of children born
in different regions of Great Britain. She found that 10-year-
olds’ LOC scores as measured by an Anglicized form of the
Nowicki-Strickland Internal External control scale (Nowicki
and Strickland, 1973), predicted their educational attainment
some 26 years later. Taking account of factors such as parental
social class, cognitive ability, socioeconomic disadvantage and
maternal educational attainment, analyses of the responses of
1,326 men and 1,578 women revealed that their own internality
in childhood, along with their mothers’ greater interest in their
children’s achievements, were related to their final educational
attainment in both the men and women.
Thus, (1) we know internality is associated with greater
academic
achievement
throughout
the
lifespan
and
(2)
both mothers’ interest in their children’s academic pursuits,
coupled with the children’s internality, predict future academic
accomplishment. However, somewhat surprisingly, we know
relatively little about the contribution of parents’ own LOC
orientation to their children’s future academic achievement.
From what we know about the LOC construct, however, it is
likely that parental LOC orientations may affect how they may be
able to deal with the everyday challenges of raising their children
to be successful academically.
Some help in predicting how the LOC orientation of
parents may be associated with the upbringing of their children
comes from a summary of study results. Nowicki (2016b)
suggests, compared to internals, externals generally: (1) show
less persistence in attempting to solve problems, (2) feel less
responsibility for their behavior, (3) are rarely relentless in
the pursuit of information, (4) cannot tolerate long delays of
gratification, and (5) show less resistance to being coerced;
characteristics that may not be helpful in attempting to parent
successfully.
Based on empirical findings and Rotter’s assumptions
regarding LOC, we predicted that children whose mothers are
more external will: (a) have poorer educational achievements;
(b) have relationships between maternal LOC and the child’s
mathematical and science abilities that will be mediated
through maternal lifestyle, parenting behaviors and attitudes to
education.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Study Sample
This study takes advantage of the data collected as part of the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
a pre-birth cohort which was designed to determine the
environmental and genetic factors that are associated with health
and development of the study offspring (Golding and ALSPAC
Study Team, 2004; Boyd et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013).
ALSPAC recruited 14,541 pregnant women resident in Avon,
UK with expected dates of delivery 1st April 1991 to 31st
December 1992 (an estimated 80% of the eligible population).
14,541 is the initial number of pregnancies for which mothers
enrolled in the ALSPAC study had either returned at least one
questionnaire or attended a hands-on assessment (“Children in
Focus” clinic) by the 19th July 1999. Of these initial pregnancies,
there was a total of 14,676 fetuses, resulting in 14,062 live
births and 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year of age.
Data were collected at various time-points using self-completion
questionnaires, biological samples, hands-on measurements, and
linkage to other data sets. Please note that the study website
contains details of all the data that are available through a fully
searchable data dictionary and variable search tool: http://www.

The study design included a concerted effort before the child’s
birth to obtain from the parents details of their personalities,
moods and attitudes, including a measure of their LOC. This
involved the pregnant women completing four questionnaires
during the pregnancy, one of which contained the LOC scale; in
parallel they were sent two questionnaires for their partners to
complete, one of which included the identical LOC scale.
The LOC Measure
The LOC measure used in the present study is a shortened version
of the adult version of the Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External
locus of control scale (ANSIE) comprising 40 items in a yes/no
format to assess perceived control (Nowicki and Duke, 1974).
This measure was chosen over other scales more specifically
related to perceived control over health, as it was considered
that this more generalized scale would relate to other factors in
addition to health outcomes. Construct validity for the scale has
been found in the results of over a 1000 studies (Nowicki, 2016a).
The version used in the present study comprises 12 of the original
40 items which were chosen after factor analysis of the ANSIE
administered as a pilot to 135 mothers. The 12 questions loaded
onto a single factor of general LOC. The 12 questions used are
shown elsewhere (Golding et al., 2017b). From the responses a
‘LOC score’ was derived, the higher the score the more external
the LOC. The scores ranged from 0 to 12. For this study, external
LOC was defined as having a score greater than the median. This
cut-off identified 45.2% of the women and 46.6% of the men as
externally controlled (ELOC).
Test–retest reliability was assessed in this study by comparing
the results 6 years later. The correlations were strong for both
men and women (r > 0.50).
Outcome Measures
Mathematical Reasoning
These tests were devised by Nunes and Bryant for the ALSPAC
study. Their aim was to assess children’s understanding and use
of quantitative relations to solve mathematical problems.
Two different Mathematical Reasoning tasks were designed.
The one containing 17 items, was given to school-children inYear
4 (N = 5275, mean age 8 years 9 months). Three types of
item were included in the Year 4 Mathematics Reasoning Task:
additive reasoning items about quantities, additive reasoning
items about relations, and multiplicative reasoning items about
quantities. The assessments used in Years 6 and 8 included
six types of item: additive reasoning items about quantities;
additive reasoning items about relations; multiplicative reasoning
items about quantities; multiplicative reasoning items involving
relations (i.e., proportions); items about spatial reasoning and
items about fractional quantities.
The aim of each task was to assess children’s reasoning about
quantities and the relations between quantities in mathematical
problems independently of their computation skills. None of the
items in these tests contained difficult calculations; the children
had to reflect on the relations between quantities in each item
in order to decide how to solve the problem. All the items were
presented with the support of drawings; the children could use
counting to solve many of the problems if they did not know
the number facts that might be used in the solution. All the
problems were presented orally by the teachers to avoid an undue
influence of reading difficulties on the children’s performance
(Nunes et al., 2009).
Analyses of their internal consistency using Cronbach’s α
showed that on all three occasions the mathematics reasoning
tasks had good levels of inter-item reliability: 0.74 at Year 4
(N = 5275), 0.89 at Year 6 (N = 7881) and 0.91 at Year 8
(N = 2755). This high internal consistency justifies the addition
of all the items into a single score.
Mental Arithmetic
Mental Arithmetic was measured as part of the WISC (Wechsler
et al., 1992) intelligence test administered at 8 years by trained
psychologists. The raw scores at age 8 years were measured using
alternate questions as for the WISC test in general (Golding et al.,
2017a). The scores were approximately normally distributed.
As reported by Nunes et al. (2012): “the split-half reliability
for 8-year-olds is 0.78 (Wechsler, 1992, p. 60); and the average
correlation with the Wide Range Achievement Test Arithmetic
Score is 0.62 (Wechsler, 1992, p. 76), which makes this a valid and
economical assessment of children’s arithmetic knowledge, thus,
suited for large-scale studies such as this.”
Scientific Understanding
This used a test designed to examine the child’s understanding
of the concepts used in science. It was designed by Terezhina
Nunes (TZ) and Peter Bryant (PB) to be administered in school
(Bryant et al., 2015). This was undertaken in School Year 6 at the
same time as the year 6 maths test (see above). Cronbach’s alpha
for this task with the sample of 4,046 children who participated
in the study was 0.721, and Bryant et al. (2015) showed strong
correlations with the SATS 2 scores.
Variables Controlled For
All analyses included the sex of the child together with
the mother’s parity (i.e., the number of previous pregnancies
resulting in a live- or still-birth) at the time of birth of the
study child (0, 1+). In addition, the following analyses were
undertaken.
Prenatal Chemical Exposures
The following variables were included since there is considerable
evidence to implicate them in neurocognitive development:
(i) maternal cigarette smoking mid-pregnancy (yes/no); (ii)
maternal binge drinking mid-pregnancy (4 or more units of
alcohol on at least 1 day in the past month) (yes/no); (iii)
frequency of maternal consumption of oily fish in third trimester
(none/any); (iv) duration of breast feeding (none or < 4 weeks/at
least 4 weeks).
Parenting Strategies in Early Childhood
The factors included were: (i) frequency mother sings to the
child at 24 months; (ii) the frequency that the mother reads to

the child at 24 months; (iii) a parenting score derived from the
frequency with which the mother attempts to teach and interact
with the child at 24 months (<33/33+ score ranged from 18 to
40); (iv) frequency with which mother takes the child to a library
at 30 months (rarely or never v. at least several times a year); (v)
frequency mother takes child to places of interest at 30 months
(never vs. at least several times a year); (vi) frequency is allowed
objects to build with (once a week or less vs. more than once a
week); (vii) exposed to people smoking when aged 3; (viii) has a
diet of ‘junk’ food at age 3 (see Feinstein et al., 2008); (ix) mother’s
partner reads to the child at age 57 months (often/<often).
Variables Based on Fostering Educational
Achievements
The following variables were included in this analysis: (i) no. of
books owned by the child at age 6 (<20, 20–49, 50+); teacher
report of the following: (ii) no. of children excluded from school
in year 3 (0,1+); (iii) no. of children receiving free school meals
in year 3 (0, 1–14, 15+); (iv) no. of disadvantaged pupils in the
school (continuous); (v) frequency child does homework in year
3 (never vs. rest); (vi) teacher report of how supportive the study
child’s parents are (very supportive vs. rest).
Statistical Approach
The analyses are designed to determine the relationship between
the children’s mean scores on the mathematics and science
tests and the mother’s LOC orientation. The basic data use
backward stepwise multiple regression adjusted for sex and parity
since these are not open to modification once the child is
conceived. For each analysis we noted the regression coefficient
(b), the measure of variance explained (R2) and the statistical
significance (P). The analysis was then repeated but taking
account of the prenatal chemical exposures (Model A). A separate
analysis allowed for the parenting strategies (Model B), and a
further analysis combined factors A and B (Analysis C). The
fourth analysis allowed for factors indicating the fostering of

the school-age child’s ability (Analysis D). Subsequent analyses
enabled all the factors in C and D to be taken into account
together. Comparison of the regression coefficients and the
amount of variance explained for each model was used to deduce
the contribution of the different factors in explaining the ways in
which the maternal LOC may have impacted on the child’s scores.
The analytic strategy is illustrated in Figure 1.
RESULTS
Response Rates by Maternal LOC
With the exception of the mental arithmetic score, which was
only obtained by the study if the child was brought to the
ALSPAC research clinic, the other tests of mathematics and
science depended on the response rates of teachers rather than of
the study families. As can be seen from Table 1, for the measures
assessed in school, compared with all children, the proportions of
responders whose mothers were external varied little, but there
was a difference for the mental arithmetic with proportionately
fewer children of external mothers.
The ways in which the basic social and environmental
measures varied with the groups of children who completed the
different measures is illustrated in Supplementary Table 1. In
general there were few differences, although the group of children
who completed the mental arithmetic test were less likely to
have young mothers, mothers who smoked in mid-pregnancy or
mothers with low levels of education.

The basic details of each score are shown in Supplementary

shown in Table 2. There are correlation coefficients ranging
from 0.388 to 0.590 for the relationships between the test
scores, and from 0.424 to 0.592 for their relationships with
the total IQ score. Interestingly the maths scores tended to
have relatively low correlations with the science reasoning score
(range 0.388–0.480).
Initial Analyses by Maternal LOC
Allowing for sex of the child and maternal parity we show
in Table 3 that the children of mothers with an external
LOC have strong negative relationships with the results of
the tests, with results varying from differences of 0.92–2.82
SDs and P-values of 10−22 to 10−62. These results took
account of the child’s sex which showed female reductions
of between 0.25 and 1.79 SDs for the mathematics reasoning
and arithmetic tests, with P-values from 0.006 to 10−27,
but no sex differences for the science reasoning test. Parity,
as a proxy for the presence of older siblings, was only
independently associated with maths and science reasoning
in Year 6; both indicated that having an older sibling was
associated with poorer achievement. It is clear from the
results of all five tests that maternal external LOC has the
largest associations (<−2 SDs) with mathematical reasoning in
school years 6 and 8, although all the differences are highly
statistically significant.

Explanation by Features of Pregnancy,
Infancy, and the Preschool Period
We examined the extent to which factors relevant to pregnancy
and infancy and known to be associated both with the
mother’s LOC and the child’s cognitive development, might
explain a proportion of the mechanism by which the mother’s
externality is associated with a reduction in maths and
science abilities (Analyses A). Thus, in Table 4 we show
the change in effect size associated with a combination of
maternal youth, failure to eat oily fish, prenatal smoking in
mid-pregnancy, binge drinking mid-pregnancy and failure to
breast feed at or beyond 4 weeks of age. The reduction
of maths and science scores attributed to external LOC
reduced by about a third, but mental arithmetic by slightly
less (27%).

Offering all features of Analyses A and B to the regression
(Analyses C; Table 6) indicated that they explained between
47 and 65% of the reduction in scores of the children of
externally oriented mothers. The size of the reduction was
greatest for mathematical reasoning in School Year 8, and least
for scientific reasoning.
Explanation by School-Age Factors
For Analyses D we took account independently of the following
variables: number of books owned by the child, whether children
had been excluded from the child’s class, no. of children in the
class receiving free school meals, teacher reports that the parents
are very supportive toward the child’s learning, and the frequency
with which the child does school homework. Unfortunately, the
data provided by schools resulted in a reduction in numbers
such that only 618 children could be considered in analyzing
Mathematics in Year 8. Consequently, those relationships were
omitted from Table 7. For all the remaining tests, these school-
age learning related variables were responsible for between 31
and 47% of the poor achievements of the children of the
external mothers.
Overall Explanation
The results of the full analyses are shown in Table 8. This
illustrates the fact that the mothers’ external LOC remains
significantly associated with poor achievement in these tests,
but that around half of the difference in the scores achieved by
children of parents who were internally oriented is related to
behaviors and choices made by the parents in regard to lifestyle,
parenting, and schooling.
DISCUSSION
Overview of Results
We hypothesized and found that children whose mothers were
more external : (a) have poorer educational achievements; and
(b) that the relationships between the maternal LOC and the
child’s mathematical and science abilities would be mediated
through maternal lifestyle, parenting behaviors and attitudes
to education. Children of mothers who are externally oriented
scored significantly lower on tests of mathematics and scientific
understanding than children of mothers who are internally
controlled. At least half of the variance was associated with
mothers’ parenting behaviors and lifestyles.
Placing the Results in Context
The present study concentrated on assessments of mathematical
and science reasoning which were designed specifically for
the ALSPAC study and administered in schools. We used
these data rather than data from national tests, because they
assessed mathematical and scientific reasoning. Past research
has shown that these maths tests (as assessed in school year
4), together with the child’s ability in mental arithmetic,
make independent contributions to children’s achievement
in mathematics in the national tests (Nunes et al., 2012).
Additionally, the science reasoning test has been shown to
be strongly predictive of the results from subsequent national
science tests (Bryant et al., 2015).
This is not the first study using the ALSPAC cohort to have
shown a cognitive association with maternal LOC. Previously,
Golding et al. (2017a) found maternal external LOC to be
associated with decreased ability in offspring IQ, as measured

using the WISC, with children of externally oriented mothers
having a disadvantage of approximately 7 IQ points at age
8. In that study we also investigated possible mechanistic
explanations for the results by determining the extent to which
three separate sets of factors known to be associated with the LOC
orientation might explain the findings. We found (a) perinatal
life-style exposures, (b) parenting attitudes and strategies and (c)
socio-economic circumstances, largely explained the mechanism
through which the externality of the mother may be associated
with influencing the cognition of the child. In fact, perinatal life-
style exposures and parenting attitudes and strategies explained
about 50% of the difference found between the abilities of
children of internal and external mothers.
Limitations of the Study
We list our study limitations below.
(1) We did not allow for concurrent social circumstances as we
wished to concentrate on factors that could be changed for
mothers to become less external and more internal.
(2) The mental arithmetic scores used were confined to the
children who attended the clinic held at the ALSPAC
offices when the children were aged 8. As with all such
attendances, there was a bias in that children whose
mothers were externally oriented were less likely to attend.
This bias must be borne in mind when interpreting the
results.
(3) It is possible that there are other confounders that should
have been taken into account, and which would have
reduced the associations.
(4) To our knowledge there are no similar longitudinal
datasets which could be used to determine whether these
results can be repeated. Such repetition would currently
provide additional support for our hypotheses.
Strengths of the Study
(1) In comparison with studies on this topic, this sample size is
numerically large.
(2) Although almost all longitudinal studies find attrition in
attendance for measurements as their study population
ages, in contrast, for the ALSPAC tests of maths and science
reasoning, all children in a school class were included, and
consequently bias related to the LOC of the study mother
was reduced.
(3) The mothers’ LOC was measured in the first 6 months
of pregnancy (90% by 28 weeks gestation), and can be
considered a baseline, largely unaffected by the outcome
of the pregnancy. The consistency of the LOC personality
characteristic over time is shown by the correlations of the
pregnancy measure with repeated measures of her LOC
(r = 0.55 and 0.54) using the same questions obtained after
6 and 18 years respectively (Nowicki et al., 2018).
Is the Relationship Causal?
We demonstrated significant associations between mothers’ LOC
and their children’s mathematics and science reasoning tasks, but
a key question concerns whether the findings imply causality.
One set of results is consistent with such an assumption; factors
we have shown elsewhere to explain about half of the original
association with both maternal LOC and subsequent parenting
behavior.
There are two ways in which the relationship between
maternal LOC and the child’s scholastic abilities could be more
convincingly shown to be causal – the first concerns the repetition
of the findings in other communities, but more convincing would
be the undertaking of randomized controlled trials comparing
groups who had been encouraged to become more internal with
those where no such intervention had occurred. Opportunities
for such interventions could be based in secondary schools
and/or provided to women attending antenatal classes.
CONCLUSION
In this paper we have used tests of mathematical and scientific
understanding since they illustrate fundamental abilities which
will provide the basis for educational achievement in technical
spheres in the future. We have concentrated the analysis on
features of the mother that could be altered (in theory at least).
It is also true that because LOC orientation is learned, it can be
changed at any stage of life through learning. In the present study,
we showed that children of an externally oriented mother are
more likely to score poorly on tests concerning the understanding
of fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts compared
to children of an internally controlled mother, and, importantly,
we found that about half of this is due to features of the behavior
of the mothers. Programs to enable mothers to become more
internally oriented may also help them use behaviors resulting
in long-term benefit to the child’s educational achievements, but
further research is needed to ensure that the relationship we
have shown between parental LOC and child achievement results
is causal.
