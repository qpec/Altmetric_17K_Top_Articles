BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are noteworthy and costly complications.
New recommendations from a national organization have urged the elimination of tradi-
tionalsurgeon’
scaps(surgicalskullcaps)andmandatedtheuseofbouffantcapstoprevent
SSIs.
OBJECTIVE: To report SSI rates for >15 000 class I (clean) surgical procedures 13 mo before
and 13 mo after surgical skull caps were banned at a single site with 25 operating rooms.
METHODS: SSI data were acquired from hospital infection control monthly summary
reports from January 2014 to March 2016. Based on a change in hospital policy
mandating obligatory use of bouffant caps since February 2015, data were categorized into
nonbouffant and bouffant groups. Monthly and cumulative infection rates for 13 mo before
(7513 patients) and 13 mo after (8446 patients) the policy implementation were collected
and analyzed for the groups, respectively.
RESULTS: Anoverallincrease of0.07% (0.77%-0.84%)inthe cumulative rate ofSSI inallclass
I operating room cases and of 0.03% (0.79%-0.82%) in the cumulative rate of SSI in all spinal
procedures was noted. However, neither increase reached statistical significance (P > .05).
The cumulative rate of SSI in neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy cases decreased from
0.95% to 0.75%; this was also not statistically significant (P = 1.00).
CONCLUSION: National efforts at improving healthcare performance are laudable but
need to be evidence based. Guidelines, especially when applied in a mandatory fashion,
should be assessed for effectiveness. In this large, single-center series of patients under-
going class I surgical procedures, elimination of the traditional surgeon’
s cap did not
reduce infection rates.

 HEADWEAR DOES NOT INFLUENCE SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS
(OR),1-3,6 including the use of a head cover by OR personnel.9-12
Nevertheless, numerous questions remain regarding the most
effective way to cover the surgeon’s head. More opinion than
science exists in this regard.
Multiple types of head coverings, including skull caps/surgeon’s
caps, bouffant caps, and/or hood-style hats, have been available
to the surgeon and associated OR personnel to cover the hair
on the face and scalp when in the OR.3,13 The Association of
periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) has advised banning
surgical caps in favor of hoods or bouffant-style coverings, and
regulatory and accrediting bodies are now enforcing that recom-
mendation. Surgeons and staff may have personal preferences
based on comfort; and for those using surgical headwear, such
as magnifying loupes and headlights, the need for proper fitting
and reasonably comfortable head covering is more than simply a
style preference.
Our multihospital institution was cited after an external
reviewer at one of the affiliated hospitals noted the use of
surgeon’s caps and incomplete hair covering. Surgeon’s caps made
of disposable or reusable cloth were banned from the OR. This
event provided an opportunity to review the effect, if any, of
removing surgeons’ caps from the OR at our hospital.
METHODS
Ethical Considerations
Our institutional review board reviewed the protocol for this study
and deemed it not human research.
Data Acquisition
SSI data at a single site with 25 ORs were acquired from hospital
infection control monthly summary reports from January 2014 to March
2016. Based on the change of hospital policy mandating obligatory
use of bouffant caps since February 2015, we categorized the data into
nonbouffant and bouffant groups. The nonbouffant period included the
time before February 2015, when surgeons and other personnel had a
choice of using a surgeon’s cap or a bouffant cap to cover the head in
the OR; personnel with beards were required to use a hood style hat
to cover the hair on face and scalp. The bouffant cap period included
the time after the implementation of hospital policy, when all personnel
were required to wear a bouffant cap to cover the head in the OR; the
requirement for the hood style hat for bearded personnel remained in
place. Surgical personnel performing total joint replacement procedures
utilized fully ventilated hoods throughout the period. No other new
infection control practice was implemented for clean class I cases during
this interval. Alcohol-based skin preps and hand scrub techniques were
routinely used but not mandated by the institution. Similarly, the use
of double-glove technique was at the discretion of the surgeon and not
mandated by the institution.
Data obtained from hospital infection control monthly summary
reports included the number of SSI in all class I OR cases, number
of SSI in all spinal procedures, and number of SSI in all neurosurgery
craniotomy/craniectomy cases (these cases were performed by the neuro-
surgical service only), along with the total numbers of all class I OR cases,
all spinal procedures, and all neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy
cases. Individual patient or operative information was not acquired for
the purpose of this study. Similarly, other factors that may influence infec-
tious outcomes, such as OR ventilation, number of people in the OR,
length of surgical procedures, and surgical scrubbing, were assumed to
be constant throughout the study period, and therefore not recorded for
the purpose of this study.
Monthly and cumulative infection rates for 13 mo prior to the
hospital’s implementation of the new headwear policy were collected for
the nonbouffant group; similarly, monthly and cumulative infection rates
for 13 mo after the implementation of this policy were collected for the
bouffant group. The infection rates in February 2015 were excluded as
an acclimation and standardization period for surgical staff.
Data Management and Statistical Analyses
Data were recorded in an Excel spreadsheet (2016 Microsoft Inc,
Redmond, Washington), and SAS
R
� 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
North Carolina) was used for the analysis. Descriptive statistics for each
of the continuous variables were performed for reporting of mean and
standard deviation. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to determine
whether the SSI rates were normally distributed. A 2-sample t-test (for
normally distributed data) and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (for abnor-
mally distributed data) were used to compare the distributions of SSI
rates between the headwear groups. A P-value of <.05 indicated that
the distributions of the SSI rates were significantly different by headwear
group. The Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the
overall response of the 2 headwear groups. A P-value of <.05 indicated
that the overall SSI rate may be related to a specific headwear group.
RESULTS
The cumulative rates of SSI for all class I OR cases, spinal
procedures, and neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy proce-
dures in the bouffant and nonbouffant groups are summarized
in Table 1. The Figure shows the scatter plots for monthly rates
of SSI for each subgroup in the bouffant and nonbouffant groups;
the monthly rate of SSI in each subgroup appears to be randomly
dispersed and not follow any particular trend.
Comparison of Cumulative Rates of SSI During the Study
Periods
When overall infection rates in the 2 13-mo periods were
compared (Table 1), an increase of 0.07% (0.77%-0.84%) was
apparent in the cumulative rate of SSI in all class I OR cases.
Similarly, there was an increase of 0.03% (0.79%-0.82%) in the
cumulative rate of SSI in all spinal procedures. However, neither
increase reached statistical significance (P > .05). Although the
cumulative rate of SSI in neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy
cases decreased from 0.95% to 0.75%, this change was also not
statistically significant (P = 1.00).
Comparison of Monthly Rates of SSI During the Study
Periods
Results of the descriptive statistics and comparison of SSI rates
before and after the implementation of hospital policy on the
use of bouffant caps are given in Table 2. The mean monthly
rate of SSI in all class I OR cases was 0.79 ± 0.44% before

implementation of hospital policy mandating use of bouffant
caps; this increased to 0.85 ± 0.42% in the year subsequent to
the mandate. However, this increase was not statistically signif-
icant (P = .75). Similarly, the mean monthly rate of SSI in all
spinal procedures was 0.82 ± 0.73% before the use of bouffant
caps; there was an increase in this rate to 0.88 ± 0.91% when
bouffant caps were used by OR personnel. Again, this increase
was not statistically significant (P = .54). The mean monthly rate
of SSI in neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy procedures was

to 0.78 ± 1.50% with bouffant cap use; this change also failed to
reach statistical significance (P = .92).
DISCUSSION
Rationale for Using Headwear in the OR
Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are constantly being shed and
dispersed from the human body along with the normal desqua-
mation of skin.5,14-16 Airborne contaminants from surgeons and
medical staff are considered a major source of contagion in the
OR,17-20 thereby necessitating measures to prevent the spread of
microbes causing SSI.
Human hair of the scalp is a common reservoir of
pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative
bacilli.16,17,21,22 The shedding of these microorganisms from
hair has been recognized as a potential source of bacteria
in the OR,1,3,9,11,12,22-24 hence a cause of postoperative
infection.7,22,23,25-27 Covering the hair of the surgical staff and
patients for major and minor surgical procedures and sometimes
even for re-dressing of wounds is recommended.22,23,25 Although
wearing caps has been a routine practice at many hospital ORs
since the beginning of the 20th century,22 epidemics of wound
infections associated with S aureus in the scalp/hair have been
reported.7,23,27 Although there is considerable data on the appro-
priate choice of headwear during certain orthopedic procedures,
19,20,24,28 the type of headwear for OR personnel in general has
not been adequately addressed in the literature.13,15
On the basis of available evidence in the literature and strong
theoretical rationale, the 1999 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Prevention of Surgical Site
Infection strongly recommended wearing a cap or hood in the
OR to fully cover the hair on the head and face.7 However, the
choice of headwear was not clearly defined in the CDC guide-
lines. Recently, the AORN Guideline for Surgical Attire suggested
the use of headwear that would cover all the hair on the head,
including the ears, scalp, sideburns, and nape of the neck.25,29-31
This has been interpreted to emphasize the use of bouffant caps
as the proper hair attire in the OR.13,32 The AORN guidelines
specifically state that surgical skull caps should not be worn25,29
and cite the 1999 CDC guidelines, which in fact do not mention
surgical caps or any other specific type of cap.
Use of Bouffant Caps in ORs
Bouffant caps have increasingly been integrated into medical
staff attire, sometimes replacing the traditional and customary
skull caps. Although some argue that bouffant caps are effective
to protect patients when worn correctly, many times they are not
donned properly.13 The elastic at the edges of the bouffant cap is
not always the perfect way to confine the hair. As a result, inten-
tional and unintentional instances of hair appearing outside the
bouffant cap have been reported,13 especially when a headlight or
neurosurgery loupes are applied, removed, and otherwise maneu-
vered around the surgeon’s headwear. In addition, complaints
of difficulty hearing and uncomfortable elastic bands have also
been reported as reasons to wear the bouffant cap off the ears;
as expected, some hair remains uncovered because of this as
well.13 Furthermore, in our personal experience, bouffant caps
were noted to brush against and contaminate the sterile draped

surgical microscopes that are routinely used for many neurosur-
gical procedures.
Effect of Headwear Choice on Rates of SSI
The mandatory use of bouffant caps as a variation in headwear
for infection control purposes has been questioned due to the lack
of evidence in the current literature. Our results comparing the
use of bouffant caps with other choices of headwear indicate that
for class I OR cases, the use of bouffant caps instead of other types
of head covers does not influence the rate of SSI. In fact, for all
class I OR cases and for all spinal procedures, the rate of SSI had a
nonstatistically significant increase after the use of bouffant caps
in the OR became mandatory in accordance with hospital policy
(Table 2). Similarly, there was a nonstatistically significant change
in the class I SSI of all neurosurgical craniotomy/craniectomy
procedures (Table 2). In essence, the use of bouffant caps in the
OR in place of other types of head covers does not appear to
provide any additional protection against class I SSI.
A study comparing the OR bacterial count with the use of cloth
caps vs cloth hoods showed no significant difference in contami-
nation between the 2 types of head covers.10 Additionally, Gordon
et al15 described a study comparing the use of Barrier theatre caps
(Mölnlycke Healthcare, Oldham, UK) and Barrier surgical hoods
(Mölnlycke Healthcare); again, there was no statistically signif-
icant difference in the contamination rates when either of the 2
was used, despite surgical hoods covering a greater surface area
of the head including the forehead, eyebrows, and ears. Notably,
this study was significantly limited by small sample size and low
occurrence of positive results.15 Similarly, an investigative study
on an outbreak of Group A Streptococcus infection of a surgical
wound showed that it originated from a staff member who was
not directly involved in patient care and was wearing a “shower
cap-style headwear made of paper,” ie, a bouffant cap.27 Studies
investigating the OR bacterial count and SSI rates without the
use of a head cover have had contradictory results,2,3,9-12,15 and
some have even suggested discontinuing the use of headwear for
nonscrubbed staff.1,11 We recommend that the use of a surgical
head cover should be continued by all personnel in the OR;
however, the options for type of headwear do not need restric-
tions. The choice of headwear worn in the OR does not seem to
influence the bacterial counts as long as hair is covered and appro-
priate ventilation is in place.9,11,12,15
Use of Surgical Caps (Skull Caps) in ORs
Surgical caps or skull caps are historically very popular and
prevalent in many hospitals throughout the course of every kind
of surgery. There is no data in the literature to suggest that surgical
caps may have a negative influence on the bacterial counts in the
OR or cause an increase in the risk of SSI. It can be argued that
surgical caps can be used as appropriate surgical headwear in low-
risk procedures as long as they are either disposable or laundered
by industry standards in a healthcare-accredited laundry facility
after daily use or when contaminated.5,30 There was a statisti-
cally nonsignificantly lower rate of SSI at our institution when
primarily disposable skull caps were used and cloth caps were
also permitted. There may be a difference between disposable
and cloth skull caps, however, that is beyond the scope of this
study. We believe that although certain orthopedic procedures
need special headwear, the choice of headwear for other proce-
dures does not affect our care of patients in the OR.
Limitations
This study is limited by the inherent nature of a retrospective
review from a single institution. Moreover, because this study
investigated the rate of SSI over a longitudinal period before
and after a change in hospital policy, other factors with potential
influence on rates of SSI were not recorded and assumed to be
constant throughout the study period. The possible bias during
the implementation period was addressed by excluding the data
during that period to allow for acclimation and standardization of
the use of bouffant caps. However, there were no data on differing
use of types of headwear during the nonbouffant period.
CONCLUSION
Although there is conflicting evidence in the literature
regarding the use of head covers in the OR, we support the use of
headwear for all personnel present in the OR. Heeding published
recommendations on hair coverage should help minimize the
incidence and risk of SSIs; however, preliminary data show that
choice of headwear does not appear to influence the SSI rates, and
therefore, need not be mandated in the hospital setting. Specifi-
cally, our data show that banning of traditional surgical skull caps
does not improve the rate of SSI.

hen the rules change in ways that seem unfair and illogical, simply
complaining rarely does any good. You must play within the
new parameters. Across the United States, draconian dress codes have
been imposed on surgeons and other operating room personnel. Many
years of accepted customs have been upended. These regulations are not
based on evidence but now have the backing of state regulatory agencies.
If surgeons find these new rules disruptive, the most effective way to
counter them is by - yes - evidence-based medicine.
The authors’ “multihospital institution was cited after an external
reviewer at one of the affiliated hospitals noted the use of surgeon’s
caps and incomplete hair covering.” They decided to strike back, and
compared the rate of surgical site infections in clean (Class I) cases over
2 13-month periods, before and after the implementation of new rules
that proscribed the use of surgical caps, and mandated bouffant head
covers instead. No statistically different changes in infection rates were
found. This included all cases, spine surgeries, and cranial operations.
The authors reasonably conclude that operating room staff should cover
their hair with the headwear of their choice.
Still to come: challenges to uncomfortable “beard masks” and
operating room jackets. Perhaps the authors can take these on, or others
will do likewise. Evidence-based medicine may seem like the basis for
a variety of annoying guidelines. But we can use the concept to our
advantage as well.

nfection is one of the major challenges that held back neurosurgery
for much of history, and infection control measures well deserve
the serious consideration they still merit.
Medicine looks back with
some chagrin now on the story of Ignaz Semmelweis and the difficulty
he had spreading the practice of handwashing in the 1800s. Yet one
recalls that the real lesson of that story is that he had evidence to back
him up that was not understood or was ignored at the time.
Since
then, with the additional insights of Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur and
others, we have assembled a powerful framework for understanding both
infection and how to use rational paradigms and evidence to improve our
practices.
The question of “best practices” today confronted in this paper might
have seemed to be a simple one at the outset. There is a new practice to
lower infection rates regarding headwear. People do not want to change,
but must for the sake of the goal of reducing infection. Are we still stuck
in the nineteenth century?
In fact, however, as the authors point out, there is very little evidence
for one form of headwear over another, or any headwear at all. Humans
have a limited capacity for changing behavior per unit time; therefore,
arguably, our efforts for change should be aimed at those practices that

are most likely to have a desirable impact, and which are based on
sound evidence (since that will further reinforce our willingness to change
when needed). The authors should be applauded for putting forth so
much effort to address this question, which one suspects they did out of
annoyance as much as anything else. They are quite right. This study
should actually have been done first, and without either a rationale or
evidence to support a headwear change, no change should have been
made.
Effort put into bouffant caps would have been focused on
something else more profitable, and our belief in a system based on
evidence would be further strengthened in the process. Let the truth
shine through, and let us commit to change promptly the next time real
evidence rightly does demand it.
