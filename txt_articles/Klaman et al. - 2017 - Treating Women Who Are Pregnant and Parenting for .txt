Objectives: The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) during
pregnancy is increasing. Practical recommendations will help pro-
viders treat pregnant women with OUD and reduce potentially
negative health consequences for mother, fetus, and child. This
article summarizes the literature review conducted using the RA-
ND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method
project completed by the US Department of Health and Human
Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration to obtain current evidence on treatment approaches for
pregnant and parenting women with OUD and their infants and
children.
Methods: Three separate search methods were employed to identify
peer-reviewed journal articles providing evidence on treatment
methods for women with OUD who are pregnant or parenting,
and for their children. Identified articles were reviewed for inclusion
per study guidelines and relevant information was abstracted and
summarized.
Results: Of the 1697 articles identified, 75 were included in the
literature review. The perinatal use of medication for addiction
treatment (MAT, also known as medication-assisted treatment),
either methadone or buprenorphine, within comprehensive treatment
is the most accepted clinical practice, as withdrawal or detoxification
risks relapse and treatment dropout. Medication increases may be
needed with advancing pregnancy, and are not associated with more
severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Switching medication
prenatally is usually not recommended as it can destabilize opioid
abstinence. Postnatally, breastfeeding is seen as beneficial for the
infant for women who are maintained on a stable dose of opioid
agonist medication. Less is known about ideal pain management and
postpartum dosing regimens. NAS appears generally less severe
following prenatal exposure to buprenorphine versus methadone.
Frontline NAS medication treatments include protocol-driven meth-
adone and morphine dosing in the context of nonpharmacological
supports.
Conclusions: Women with OUD can be treated with methadone or
buprenorphine during pregnancy. NAS is an expected and manage-
able condition. Although research has substantially advanced, oppor-
tunities to guide future research to improve maternal and infant
outcomes are provided.

O
pioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic disease
with potentially serious negative consequences for
individuals—particularly so for pregnant and parenting
women and their children—and society. (This document uses

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 2013.) Since 2002, prescription opioid use and misuse has
significantly increased among men and women (pregnant and
nonpregnant) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Qual-
ity [CBHSQ], 2015b). In 2013–2014, the number of women
aged between 15 and 44 years who reported past-month non-
medical use of psychotherapeutics, OxyContin (oxycodone)
type, increased to 98,000, up 5.4% from 2011 to 2012. The
number of women aged between 15 and 44 who reported past-
month heroin use increased to 109,000 in 2013–2014, up 31%
from 2011 to 2012 (CBHSQ, 2015a, Table 6.71A).
Infants exposed to tobacco, alcohol, prescription medi-
cations, and illicit substances may exhibit signs of physiologic
withdrawal from these substances after birth. Neonatal absti-
nence syndrome (NAS) is a broad, nonspecific term assigned
to this type of presentation in the newborn. It is widely applied
both clinically and in the published literature to infants
withdrawing from opioids. However, the more specific term
neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is becoming
more widely used. The utility of the more specific NOWS
term is to capture more accurately the numbers of infants
experiencing withdrawal from opioid exposure in utero. This
is important because specific screening and treatment proto-
cols can be used to promote the best outcomes for these
infants, whereas infants not exposed to opioids may require
different assessment and management. However, the pub-
lished literature uses the more general NAS term and, in
clinical practice, substance-exposed infants are typically
exposed to multiple substances.
NAS incidence increased nearly 2-fold from 2009 to
2012 (Patrick et al., 2015). NOWS or NAS signs and symp-
toms occur 48 to 72 hours postbirth following discontinuation
of prenatal opioid exposure (eg, Patrick et al., 2012; Jones and
Fielder, 2015). Compared with pregnant women treated for
OUD with methadone or buprenorphine, an untreated OUD
group had more adverse maternal-fetal and maternal-infant
health outcomes, including elevated risk of low-birth-weight
newborns, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental
changes (Binder and Vavrinkova
´, 2008). Research to develop
evidence-based criteria or consensus statements for the treat-
ment of pregnant and parenting women with OUD and the
concurrent care of their infants and children is largely absent.
Thus, practical recommendations derived from appropriate
and accepted clinical experiences are urgently needed.
An effective method for assessing the validity of clinical
procedures with limited scientific evidence is the RAND
Appropriateness Method (RAM), developed in the 1980s
by the RAND Corporation and the University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA). A PubMed search for ‘‘RAND/UCLA
Appropriateness Method’’ indicates the RAM has been used
in 127 articles, 77 of which were published in the last 5 years,
including the American Society of Addiction Medicine
(ASAM) National Practice Guideline for the Use of Medi-
cations in the Treatment of Addiction Involving Opioid Use
(Kampman and Jarvis, 2015) and the Practice Guidance for
Buprenorphine for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders:
Results of an Expert Panel Process (Farmer et al., 2015).
The foundation of any appropriateness study is a critical
literature review. However, unlike a meta-analysis, which
combines the results of different studies to allow for the
use of inferential statistical methods, the RAM literature
review objective is to produce a synthesis of all available
evidence, including the collective judgment of expert
opinions, on a particular topic. The RAM literature review
is typically less strict in inclusion criteria than a Cochrane
review and, where evidence is lacking, may include lower-
quality evidence, such as cohort or case studies (see Fitch
et al., 2001, for RAM methodology details).
The RAM literature review presented in this article was
undertaken for the US Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA). SAMHSA used the RAM to
assess the appropriateness of clinical procedures to treat
pregnant and parenting women with OUD and their children
and to ultimately develop guidance for healthcare providers
who evaluate and treat this population.
As part of the RAM, SAMHSA convened a Federal
Steering Committee (Table 1) and an Expert Panel (Table 2).
The Federal Steering Committee and the Expert Panel recom-
mended and evaluated the literature (see Search Method 3).
This literature review, which arose as part of the RAM
process, is intended primarily for researchers and policy-
makers in the areas of OUD and pregnant women whose
opioid exposure also exposed infants in utero. In addition,
healthcare providers interested in reviewing the evidence for
treating such women and their infants and children will find
this review useful.
Together, this literature review and the SAMHSA RAM
report provide the foundation for a critically needed guidance

 document (hereafter referred to as the Guide) that will include
practical recommendations for assessing and treating preg-
nant and parenting women with OUD and their infants and
children. (SAMHSA’s detailed RAM process and results are
described in the report entitled Advancing the Care of Preg-
nant and Parenting Women With Opioid Use Disorder and
Their Infants: A Foundation for Clinical Guidance, available
at
https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=SAMHSA-
2016-0002-0001) The Guide, which is intended for healthcare
providers, will be published by SAMHSA after a period of
public review and comment.
The current literature review has 4 aims: (1) to sum-
marize current evidence on treatment approaches for pregnant
and parenting women with OUD and their children; (2) to
identify the current state of the research; (3) to identify gaps in
the research evidence; and (4) to derive recommended ques-
tions to guide future research.
METHODS
The RAM process took place from May through Sep-
tember 2015. Given the methodology used for this analysis,
the research did not meet criteria for institutional review board
review. SAMHSA instructed the Federal Steering Committee
and the Expert Panel to recommend articles for inclusion in
the literature review that were specific to treatment of preg-
nant or parenting women with OUD. Thus, articles pertaining
to tobacco or alcohol cessation recommendations during
pregnancy were not included. Additionally, the literature
review excluded topics lacking literature; for example, treat-
ment for depression or anxiety in pregnant or parenting
women with OUD, or maternal, fetal, and child safety and
efficacy data in the United States regarding naltrexone use in
pregnant or postpartum women with OUD. The first step of
the RAM process is to conduct a literature review of historical
and newly published research. The RAM literature review
took place between April 2013 and April 2015.
This RAM literature review used 3 separate search
methods (Fig. 1) to identify peer-reviewed journal articles
providing evidence on treatment methods for pregnant or
parenting women with OUD, and for their children. Excluded
were (1) review articles, as the literature review focused on
primary research publications; (2) commentaries; and (3)
articles not focused on opioid use and misuse in pregnant
women or the effects of prenatal OUD on children (both
immediate and long-term effects).
Search Method 1: Use of Bibliographies From
Guidelines
For the first search method, relevant peer-reviewed
primary research articles were extracted from the bibliogra-
phies of guidelines shown in Table 3, as well as recent
compilations of materials devoted to substance use disorders
and their treatment among pregnant or parenting women, and
neonatal withdrawal from psychoactive substances.
A total of 404 articles were identified in theguidelines and
bibliographies. Articles that were cited more than once were
considered ‘‘critical articles’’ and were selected for inclusion,
resulting in 29 articles. These articles may have included self-

 citations, but this was not analyzed. Of these 29 articles, 2 were
cited 5 times, 4 were cited 4 times, 3 were cited 3 times, and 20
were cited twice. The titles andabstracts of the articles cited only
once were also reviewed by the Expert Panel Chair to identify
additional essential articles, resulting in 12 additional articles
being selected for inclusion in this literature review. This method
yielded 41 articles for in-depth review.
Search Method 2: Use of World Health
Organization Search Method
To identify additional articles published between April
2013 and April 2015, the second search method replicated the
literature search method used in the World Health Organiz-
ation’s (WHO’s) Guidelines for the Identification and Man-
agement of Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders in
Pregnancy (WHO, 2014). The initial search produced 467
articles. A research librarian modified and added to the WHO
search terms to identify additional relevant articles. Consist-
ent with the WHO method, the librarian searched PubMed,
PsycInfo, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature), Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane
Center Register of Controlled Trials) databases using the
listed search terms (see Appendix A, http://links.lww.com/
JAM/A53).
This search method yielded 819 articles. Combining the
2 strategies produced a total of 1286 articles. Of those, 1158
articles were excluded, yielding 128 articles from search
method 2.
Search Method 3: Federal Steering Committee
and Expert Panel Literature Review
The 169 articles from search methods 1 and 2 were then
reviewed independently and in depth for a second time for
relevance to the topic of OUD in pregnant and parenting
women. This review reduced the article total from 169 to 110.
The Federal Steering Committee and the Expert Panel
reviewed the list of 110 articles. Federal Steering Committee
members recommended a review of National Institute on Drug
Abusegranteepublicationsfrom April2013 toApril2015.That
review identified 74articles, of which 46were novelarticles not
identifiedusingthe first2 searchmethods. TheFederalSteering
Committee and Expert Panel members also recommended
including another 12 articles. Of these 58 articles, 7 met
eligibility criteria, yielding a total of 117 articles.
A final overview of the 117 articles was conducted to
remove duplicate results and articles with insufficient numbers
of subjects or inappropriate use of statistical methods. Forty-
two articles were dropped, leaving a final list of 75 articles (see
Appendix B, http://links.lww.com/JAM/A54) selected to
identify relevant evidence regarding treatment of pregnant
and parenting women with OUD and their infants and children.
Creating the Abstraction Table
Three public health doctoral students with experience in
conducting systematic literature reviews independently read
the 75 articles. They abstracted relevant information from the
eligible articles to generate a summary table presenting the
key details of the study design and major findings (see
Supplemental Material, http://links.lww.com/JAM/A51). To
ensure fidelity to the process, the students began with a review
of 3 articles. Their independent reviews resulted in complete
agreement with regard to which data to extract. They then
divided the remaining articles and worked collaboratively to
create the abstraction table. The Expert Panel members then
reviewed the abstraction table to inform their initial RAM
literature review judgments.
RESULTS
All articles found through any of the search methods
were included in the initial review. The earliest article was
published in 1975, the latest in 2015. Included were 5
guidelines (see Table 3) that summarized the state of the
field through early 2015. Of the 1697 articles identified, 75
were included in the literature review. This final list of 75
articles was selected to identify relevant evidence regarding
treatment of pregnant and parenting women with OUD and
their infants and children.
The current literature review covers 3 overlapping
areas: (1) prenatal, (2) postnatal, and (3) neonatal. Most
literature addresses methadone and buprenorphine, with lim-
ited data regarding buprenorphine þ naloxone (Debelak et al.,
2013; Jones et al., 2013a).
Prenatal
Medication-Assisted Withdrawal
Medication-assisted withdrawal is known to have a high
relapse rate (Jones et al., 2008b). The subsequent return to use
of illicit opioids subjects pregnant women and the fetus to all
the risks associated with such psychoactive substance use
(eg, Kaltenbach et al., 1998; Mattick et al., 2009). Despite this

 concern regarding opioid use relapse, a secondary data
analysis reported that a few studies support the concept that
a small minority of women (16%) are successful at complet-
ing medication-assisted withdrawal and remaining in drug-
free treatment until delivery (eg, Lund et al., 2012).
Medication for Addiction Treatment (MAT) (also
known as medication-assisted treatment) and the
Fetus
Opioid agonists cross the placental barrier (Zharikova
et al., 2007) in concentrations consistent with maternal dose
(Concheiro et al., 2010; de Castro et al., 2011), and may
adversely affect the fetus. Given the inability to measure fetal
physiologic behavior directly, fetal impact from opioidagonists
has focused on measures of heart and movement activity. In a
secondary data analysis from the Maternal Opioid Treatment:
Human Experimental Research (MOTHER) study, a large-
scale trial comparing maternal and neonatal outcomes in 175
pregnant women randomly assigned to methadone or bupre-
norphine pharmacotherapy and provided with comprehensive
care throughout their pregnancy, Jansson et al. (2011) found
that compared with methadone-exposed fetuses, buprenor-
phine-exposed fetuses had significantly higher levels of fetal
heart rate variability, more fetal heart rate accelerations, and
greater coupling between fetal heart rate and fetal movement.
Compared with the methadone-exposed group at 24 and 28
weeks’ gestation, the buprenorphine-exposed fetuses displayed
significantly less motor activity suppression and longer
duration of movements than the methadone-exposed fetuses.
In another secondary analysis of MOTHER study data, Salis-
bury et al. (2012) reported that, at 31 and 33 weeks of gestation,
compared with buprenorphine-exposed fetuses, methadone-
exposed fetuses were more likely to have a nonreactive (abnor-
mal) nonstress test, fewer fetal heart rate accelerations, and
lower biophysical profile scores (hence, more negative) at peak
dosing. These findings suggest more optimal fetal indicators
with buprenorphine than with methadone. These indicators
were equivalent in the 2 groups of fetuses before dosing,
suggesting that the medication was the only critical variable.
Kakkoetal.(2008)prospectivelyfollowedbuprenorphine-
exposed pregnancies compared with retrospective methadone-
exposed pregnancies. Their data support a greater incidence of
intrauterine growth restriction in the methadone-exposed than in
the buprenorphine-exposed fetuses, a conclusion based on a
nonsignificantly higher number of cesarean deliveries in the
methadone-exposed than the buprenorphine-exposed group.
Finally, Jansson et al. (2012) reported that—in a pro-
spective sample of women undergoing 36-week fetal monitor-
ing—fetal heart rate, fetal heart rate variability, and fetal
activity were lower in methadone-exposed fetuses relative
to the nonpsychoactive-substance-exposed fetuses, measured
at peak dosage levels of methadone. Moreover, fetal move-
ment at trough (just before maternal methadone dose)
measurement was significantly lower in the methadone-
exposed fetuses than in the fetuses who were not exposed
to psychoactive substances, which was interpreted as a meth-
adone persistent effect.
With regard to fetal heroin and methadone exposure, 2
studies provide conflicting results and conclusions. A meta-
analysis suggests that continued use of heroin while receiving
methadone counteracts the birth-weight advantage gained
from methadone alone (Hulse et al., 1997). In contrast, a
cohort study suggests that methadone remains advantageous
for the maternal-fetal dyad regardless of continued heroin use
(Buckley et al., 2013). In a surveillance study, methadone
alone has also not been shown to increase fetal or infant
mortality (Kelly et al., 2012).
Postnatal
Methadone and Buprenorphine: Pain Medication
During Pregnancy, Delivery, and Postpartum
Individuals with long-term exposure to opioids experi-
ence tolerance (reduced analgesia)andhyperalgesia (increased
sensitivity to pain) (Savage, 1996). Therefore, pregnant and
postpartum women using MAT or with a history of long-term
exposure to opioids will likely need higher doses of opioid
agonist medication during labor, delivery, and the postpartum
period (Alford et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2007, 2010). Further-
more, opioid agonist-antagonist medications (eg, nalbuphine or
butorphanol)shouldbeavoidedowingtotheriskofprecipitated
withdrawal in women receiving opioid agonists(eg, methadone
or buprenorphine) (Savage, 1996; Cassidy and Cyna, 2004;
Jones et al., 2014b). Jones et al. (2009) examined postpartum
pain management in women with severe OUD in the Pregnant
and the Reduction of Opiates: Medication Intervention Safety
and Efficacy (PROMISE) study, a small-scale trial comparing
maternal and neonatal outcomes in 30 pregnant women ran-
domly assigned to methadone or buprenorphine pharmacother-
apy. On average, buprenorphine-receiving women decreased
their daily ibuprofen dose, whereas methadone-receiving
women increased their daily ibuprofen dose.
Methadone and Buprenorphine: Postpartum
Dosing
It is well established that women need increases in
methadone dose with advancing gestation (eg, Jones et al.,
2005). A similar yet less conclusive pattern is seen with
buprenorphine (eg, Jones et al., 2005). Dividing the dose of
methadone in half (split dosing) is an approved protocol for
women in the third trimester of pregnancy because of the
shorter half-life and larger clearances of medications during
pregnancy (eg, Bogen et al., 2013). There is mixed evidence
supporting the need to lower methadone or buprenorphine
doses after delivery (Jones et al., 2008a; Bogen et al., 2013;
Pace et al., 2014; Bastian et al., 2016).
Methadone and Buprenorphine: Breast Milk
Limited research has focused on concentrations of opioid
agonist medication in breast milk; firm conclusions are difficult
given the generally small sample sizes. However, assays clearly
suggest that concentrations of both buprenorphine (eg, Ilett
et al., 2012) and methadone (eg,Jansson et al., 2008b) in human
breast milk are quite low, and pose little risk for neonates.
Methadone and Buprenorphine: Breastfeeding
Women maintained on a stable dose of methadone or
buprenorphine should be encouraged to breastfeed (WHO,
Klaman et al.

 2014) unless specifically contraindicated (eg, maternal human
immunodeficiency virus positive [HIVþ]). Few studies of
opioid agonist pharmacotherapy for pregnant women with
OUD have focused on breastfeeding as an outcome (notably,
Johnson et al., 2001; Abdel-Latif et al., 2006; Abrahams et al.,
2010; Debelak et al., 2013). The US literature typically shows
low rates of breastfeeding among postpartum women with
OUD (eg, Jansson et al., 2008a; Jones et al., 2010b; Pritham
et al., 2012).
Impact of Breastfeeding
A study of neonates prenatally exposed to methadone or
buprenorphine for a minimum of 30 days found that breastfed
neonates had significantly shorter lengths of hospital stay and
need for pharmacotherapy for NAS (Wachman et al., 2013).
Abdel-Latif et al. (2006) examined the impact of breastfeed-
ing in a retrospective chart review of women with opioid
dependence (not all of whom were maintained on methadone;
none were maintained
on
buprenorphine),
who
either
breastfed or formula fed their neonates on day 5 of life.
The breastfed neonatal group had lower withdrawal scores
for the first 9 days postpartum, a lower rate of need for
pharmacotherapy for withdrawal, a longer median time to
such pharmacotherapy, and shorter hospital stays. Although
relevant research is inconclusive, breastfed neonates may be
exposed to small amounts of either buprenorphine or meth-
adone, thereby avoiding the withdrawal symptoms that might
be caused by an abrupt cessation of opioid exposure (Malpas
and Darlow, 1999). It has also been postulated that NAS
severity is mitigated by the act of breastfeeding rather than the
amount of medication in breast milk (eg, WHO, 2014).
Methadone and Buprenorphine: NAS
Measurement and Treatment Incidence
Widely different NAS prevalence rates are reported in
the research, which largely consists of retrospective cohort
studies (see Jones et al., 2012, for a comprehensive bupre-
norphine review). These discrepancies are likely due to 4
factors. First, the studies have different inclusion criteria (eg,
including women who were using benzodiazepines), and
inclusion and/or exclusion criteria for nonrandomized studies
were often not reported (Jones et al., 2012). Second, there is
wide variability in the measurement of NAS. For example,
many scoring systems, such as the modified Finnegan, allow
clinicians to assess the severity of NAS. However, as with all
behavioral measures, such Finnegan scores are fallible; more-
over, interrater reliability has often been reported to be poor or
substandard. Although the Finnegan scoring system is used to
assess opioid and nonopioid withdrawal, shortened or sim-
plified versions of this scoring system have not been widely
adopted (Kocherlakota, 2014). Third, examiners’ skills vary.
For example, the Finnegan scoring system requires consider-
able training for reliable use, yet even trained raters have
difficulty accurately judging some items, such as the differ-
ence between ‘‘mild’’ and ‘‘marked’’ tremors (Jones and
Fielder, 2015). Fourth, there are differences in NAS treatment
initiation and weaning protocols, because the healthcare
provider needs to customize each infant’s treatment to reflect
withdrawal intensity and gestational period (Kocherlakota,
2014). Additionally, initiation of treatment and weaning of
medications will differ depending on the standardized scoring
system used and the protocol used (Teague et al., 2015). The
current consensus is that the NAS incidence is similar for
buprenorphine and methadone, at approximately 50%. More-
over, research indicates that compared with methadone-
exposed neonates, buprenorphine-exposed neonates require
less morphine to treat NAS, spend less time in the hospital
medicated for NAS, and have a shorter hospital stay (Jones
et al., 2005, 2010b, 2012).
Methadone and Buprenorphine: Maternal Dose-
response Relationships to Neonatal Outcomes
Retrospective
studies
examining
the
relationship
between methadone dose (and, to a lesser extent, buprenor-
phine dose) and neonatal outcomes have yielded inconsistent
findings (see Jones et al., 2013c, 2014a, for reviews of these 2
lines of research). The need to examine whether there was a
relationship between dose and neonatal outcomes was stimu-
lated by the concern that higher methadone doses might harm
the fetus and result in more severe NAS. Jones et al. (2013c,
2014a) used MOTHER data and found no relationship
between either methadone or buprenorphine dose and peak
NAS score, total amount of morphine needed to treat NAS,
duration of neonatal hospital stay, duration of pharmacother-
apy for NAS, estimated gestational age at delivery, Apgar
score at 5 minutes, and neonatal head circumference, length,
and weight at birth. These findings on the lack of a link
between methadone or buprenorphine dose and NAS extend
the results of a meta-analysis (Cleary et al., 2010) that found
that the severity of NAS was unrelated to methadone dose, and
strongly suggest that the practice of reducing maternal opioid
agonist medication to protect the fetus is unwarranted.
Weight-Based Versus Symptom-Based
Pharmacotherapy for NAS
Beginning with Finnegan et al.’s (1975) guidance
regarding weight-based pharmacotherapy for NAS, treatment
for NAS has been weight based with few exceptions (notably
the Jones et al., 2010b, MOTHER study). However, pharma-
cotherapeutic dosing for NAS based on symptom severity may
be more efficacious than pharmacotherapeutic dose based on
neonatal weight (Jansson et al., 2009). At present, the dosing
regimen is thought to be complex, and dependent on both
initial assessment of NAS severity and response to treatment.
Methadone and Buprenorphine: NAS Signs and
Time Course
Gaalema et al. (2012) compared the NAS signs of
methadone-exposed and buprenorphine-exposed infants in
the MOTHER study, who had been assessed for 10 days
following delivery using the study’s modified Finnegan scale
(MOTHER NAS Scale [MNS]; Jones et al., 2010b). The
authors found that undisturbed tremors and hyperactive Moro
reflex occurred significantly more often in the methadone-
exposed neonatal group, and nasal stuffiness, sneezing, and
loose stools occurred significantly more often in the buprenor-
phine-exposed neonatal group. The methadone-exposed group
had higher mean MNS scores than did the buprenorphine-

183
 exposed neonatal group, marked by higher scores on disturbed
and undisturbed tremors, hyperactive Moro reflex, excessive
irritability, and failure to thrive; sneezing was significantly
higher among buprenorphine-exposed neonates. Gaalema et al.
(2013) also found that in a secondary data analysis the mean
time (hours:minutes, interquartile range) to initiation of phar-
macotherapy for buprenorphine-exposed neonates was signifi-
cantly longer compared with methadone-exposed neonates
(71:02, 44:21–96:27 vs 34:12, 21:00–55:41, respectively,
P < 0.001), a finding consistent with the MOTHER study
and a previous smaller trial (Fischer et al., 2006). The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that both groups of
neonates be monitored for NAS for a minimum of 5–7 days
(120–168hours) was crafted to ensure that no infant is sent
home too early to determine whether NAS treatment is needed
(Hudak and Tan, 2012).
Other Factors Affecting NAS
A number of studies have focused on elucidating the
factors that exacerbate or minimize NAS. The extent of
nicotine use has been found to be a robust factor in increasing
NAS expression (eg, Jones et al., 2013b). Furthermore, the
presence of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or
benzodiazepines may also exacerbate NAS expression (Kal-
tenbach et al., 2012).
Rooming-in to Reduce NAS
Recent research suggests that the first-line approach to
managing neonates prenatally exposed to 1 or more classes of
opioids may be a rooming-in model that minimizes stimu-
lation from outside sources (eg, by using low lighting),
maximizes maternal-infant contact, and encourages breast-
feeding (eg, Abrahams et al., 2010).
Measurement of NAS
Several studies have attempted to develop alternative
measures to the Finnegan scoring system, also referred to as
the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (NASS). Moreover,
many of the measures in clinical use are modifications of the
NASS, making comparisons among cohort studies difficult if
not impossible. The psychometric properties of both the
NASS and the MNS certainly seem deficient (Jones et al.,
2016c), suggesting a need to develop new NAS measures.
(See Jones and Fielder, 2015, for a review of these measures
and the issues in the measurement of NAS.) Research aimed at
developing short forms of the NASS and the MNS that are
easier to administer consistently has shown promise (eg, Jones
et al., 2010a, 2016b).
NAS Medication Treatment Protocol
Paregoric was originally the treatment of choice for
NAS; it is found in the initial treatment protocol presented by
Finnegan et al. (1975). Diluted tincture of opium was also
once popular, but concerns about its high alcohol content and
the possibility of its confusion with deodorized tincture of
opium (both are commonly abbreviated DTO) led to calls for
use of oral morphine sulfate instead. Oral morphine sulfate
was found to be as efficacious as diluted tincture of opium in a
randomized controlled trial (Langenfeld et al., 2005). Oral
morphine use has been complicated by a retrospective review
suggesting that methadone may be just as efficacious (Lain-
wala et al., 2005). Buprenorphine holds promise as a first-line
NAS treatment (eg, Kraft et al., 2008, 2011).
Although research indicates that clonidine or pheno-
barbital may be used as second-line medications for infants
with more severe NAS not completely controlled with mor-
phine or methadone (eg, Coyle et al., 2002; Agthe et al.,
2009), ongoing research is still trying to determine the safety
and efficacy of clonidine (Bada et al., 2015).
Future Research Topics
This RAM literature review highlights the complexity
of issues and practices affecting the treatment of pregnant and
parenting women for OUD and the concurrent care of their
infants and children. Ongoing research on the prenatal, post-
natal, and neonatal periods is needed. To that end, the chair of
the Expert Panel, Hendre
´e E. Jones, PhD, a senior author of
this article, in collaboration with SAMHSA staff drew up a list
of future research topics, presented in Table 4. The selected
topics have been the subject of promising but not yet definitive
research. Although not exhaustive, the table highlights
important areas for future study that might lead to meaningful
advances in the care and outcomes of mothers who have OUD
and their children.
CONCLUSIONS
The number of women aged between 15 and 44 who
reported past-month nonmedical use of psychotherapeutics,
OxyContin (oxycodone) type, and the number of women aged
between 15 and 44 who reported past-month heroin use
increased from 2011–2012 to 2013–2014 (CBHSQ, 2015a,
Table 6.71A). In addition, the prevalence of OUD during
pregnancy more than doubled between 1998 and 2011, to 4
per 1000 deliveries (Maeda et al., 2014). Given that women
with OUD have a higher frequency of additional risk factors
for adverse pregnancy outcomes than do pregnant women
who do not use opioids, evidence-based clinical guidance on
the treatment of these women and their children is needed.
The present article, developed as part of a RAM process,
serves as the basis for a series of recommendations for
researchers and policymakers in the areas of OUD and
pregnant women whose opioid exposure also exposed infants
in utero. Healthcare providers interested in reviewing the
evidence for treating such women and their infants and
children may also find this review useful. This work supports
and extends the ASAM National Practice Guideline for the
Use of Medications in the Treatment of Addiction Involving
Opioid Use, which includes guidance on treating pregnant
women (Kampman and Jarvis, 2015).
Several recent reviews have similarly discussed use of
prescription opioids during pregnancy and birth outcomes.
Zedler et al. (2016) found evidence that buprenorphine treat-
ment for OUD during pregnancy demonstrates lower risk of
preterm birth, greater birth weight, and larger head circum-
ference compared with methadone treatment. Yazdy et al.
(2015) found evidence that head circumference and birth
length have no association with opioid use. (The present
status of research does not indicate that opioid agonist

 pharmacotherapy during pregnancy exposes the fetus to
greater teratological risk than found in the non-opioid-
exposed fetus; however, to date, no research has been reported
indicating that MAT during pregnancy is associated with birth
defects.) This RAM literature review is broader in scope than
these recent reviews and makes a significant contribution to
the literature by providing substantial recommendations for
future research.
The present article summarized the results from 75
studies that focused on prenatal and postnatal OUD treatment
of women and their prenatally opioid-exposed infants and
children. The collective literature review points to several
conclusions:
� Although withdrawal from opioids to an opioid-free state is
possible during pregnancy, relapse rates are high and
repeated cycles of intoxication and withdrawal are associ-
ated with possible adverse effects.
� The accepted treatment for OUD during pregnancy is long-
acting opioid agonist MAT that includes methadone or
buprenorphine provided within the context of a compre-
hensive program of obstetrical care and behavioral inter-
vention.
� For the fetus, steady states of buprenorphine appear to have
a less sedating effect than single daily dosing of meth-
adone. Split dosing of methadone in the third trimester may
also have a less suppressive effect on the fetus. At this time,
the postnatal and longer-term effects of suppression of fetal
parameters remain unknown.
� As gestation increases, higher doses of methadone and
possibly buprenorphine appear to be needed.
� Postpartum women with OUD may need greater amounts
of pain relief medication compared with women without
such opioid experience.
� Breastfeeding among women not using other substances
and maintained on methadone or buprenorphine can
encourage and promote maternal-infant bonding, and
likely have mitigating effects on NAS severity.
� NAS severity may be less with buprenorphine than with
methadone; however, other factors such as maternal
tobacco use, maternal benzodiazepine use, dyad genetics,
NAS medication regimens, and hospital protocols deter-
mining where infants reside (eg, neonatal intensive care
unit or rooming-in) may alter this relationship.
Although NAS has been an issue of focus, it is an
identifiable and treatable condition that is only one aspect
of the complete risk/benefit ratio decision for any patient and
her provider to make during pregnancy. For a sustained
recovery, the maternal-fetus/maternal-infant dyad must be
considered as a whole and in the context of the dyad’s risk
and protective life factors.
The summary of research found in the present article
must be considered within the context of its limitations. These
include the fact that different literature search methods may
find different articles and possibly lead to different con-
clusions. Several studies may have limited generalizability
to the US population, in large part because of cultural and
health system differences. Furthermore, the descriptive and
correlational designs of some studies may have resulted in
several biases (eg, selection bias weakens the study results,
confounding psychosocial factors).
Although this literature review identified evidence from
recent clinical research studies providing support for the
Guide, substantial questions for future research, as noted in
Table 4, still remain. Further research that focuses on those
questions is likely to have an impact on the treatment of
pregnant and parenting women and their infants and children.
In conclusion, both methadone and buprenorphine pro-
vide effective treatment for OUD before, during, and after
pregnancy; however, neither medication is a ‘‘cure.’’ For the
mother, both medications offer benefits to support behavioral
change. For the fetus, buprenorphine appears less sedating
than methadone. For the neonate, collective randomized
controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective data, show
a less severe NAS for buprenorphine than methadone
exposure in utero. However, NAS is only one aspect of the
complete risk/benefit ratio decision that must be made. Any
MAT plan for OUD must be developed in the context of
a comprehensive care program that is supportive of and
responsive to women and the maternal-fetus/maternal-infant
dyad.
