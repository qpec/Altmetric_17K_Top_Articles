to quantify the relationship between
recreational arts engagement and mental
well-being in the general population

Abstract
Background: Little is known about the dose–response relationship between recreational arts engagement (for
enjoyment, entertainment or as a hobby, rather than therapy) and mental well-being in the general population.
The quantification of this relationship is of value to: (1) health professionals, clinicians and researchers interested
in utilising the arts as a method for improving mental health; (2) to health promoters and policy makers in the
development of population based health messages, policy and practice; and (3) to members of the general
public in maintaining or improving their own well-being. As guided by theories of social epidemiology and the
biopsychosocial model of health, the first aim of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between
arts engagement (hours per year) and mental well-being in the general population. If an association was
demonstrated, the second aim was to quantify this relationship.
Methods: A random sample of 702 Western Australian adults aged 18+ years (response rate = 71 %) were invited
to take part in a telephone survey. The survey took 15 min to complete and included questions about arts
engagement, mental well-being, demographics and potential confounders/effect modifiers. The dependent variable
was subjective mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, WEMWBS). The independent
variable was hours engaged in the arts in the last 12 months.
Results: Respondent engagement in the arts ranged from zero to 1572 hours/year (mean = 100.8 hours/year,
SD = 206.0). The prevalence of engagement was 83 %. The average WEMWBS score was 53 (SD = 7.4). After
adjustment for demographics (i.e. sex, age group, location, income, education, marital status, children), general
health, sports engagement, religious activities and holidays, respondents with high levels of arts engagement
(100 or more hours/year, WEMWBS score = 55) had significantly better mental well-being than those with none
(0 hours/year, WEMWBS score = 53), low (0.1–22.9 hours/year, WEMWBS score = 52) and medium (23–99.9 hours/
year, WEMWBS score = 53) levels of engagement (p = 0.003). Respondents with none, low and medium arts
engagement had similar WEMWBS scores (p = 0.358). The relationship between arts engagement and WEMWBS was
nonlinear with evidence of a minimum threshold at 100 or more hours/year (p = 0.0006).

Conclusion: Evidence of an arts-mental health relationship was found in this study. Those who engaged in 100 or
more hours/year of arts engagement (i.e. two or more hours/week) reported significantly better mental well-being
than other levels of engagement. The suitability of the arts as a population based strategy to influence the mental
well-being of the general population should be investigated further.

Mental Well-being Scale
Background
With an emphasis on self-expression, creativity, enjoy-
ment and social inclusion the arts are receiving increasing
attention from health professionals, researchers, clinicians,
policy makers and the general community as a means of
improving population health and mental well-being [1–3].
Evidence of the benefits of recreational arts engagement
has been mounting since the 1990s [4], yet little is known
about how much arts engagement is needed for good
mental health (i.e. dose–response). Good mental health or
being ‘mentally healthy’ [5] can be defined as a state of
well-being whereby an individual is able to contribute to
their community, cope with the stresses of everyday life, is
able to realise their potential and work productively [6].
Good mental health is essential for individual and com-
munity well-being. Poor mental health is a leading cause
of mortality, disability and burden of disease [7]. World-
wide, over 450 million people suffer from mental illness
[8]. Overall, women compared to men; unmarried com-
pared to married/de-facto; single parent with children
compared to couple only households and younger com-
pared to older people experience higher rates of mental
illness [9, 10]. Engagement in physical activity [11, 12],
spirituality [13], good general health [5], and holidays [14]
are associated with mental well-being, while poor educa-
tion and low income are associated with a higher preva-
lence of mental disorders [9, 15].
Arts engagement
Arts engagement can be defined as active (e.g. making
art) or receptive (e.g. attending concerts) involvement in
creative events or activities within a variety of art forms
such as the performing arts, visual arts and literature [16].
Arts engagement by members of the general popula-
tion is high. For example, it is estimated that 78 % of
British (16+ years), 86 % of Australian (15+ years), 85 % of
New Zealander (15+ years), and 99 % of Canadian adults
(15+ years) take part in creative events and activities each
year [17–20].
Arts engagement and mental health
Clinical studies have found that arts engagement pro-
motes patient recovery, relaxation and reduces patient
stress, anxiety and depression [21–23]. In cancer patients
the arts have been used to enhance quality of life after
medical treatment [24]. Arts programs for people experi-
encing mental ill-health have been linked with improved
confidence, self-esteem and self-understanding [25, 26].
In the elderly, arts engagement reduces depressed mood,
enhances self-worth and promotes positive aging [27, 28].
Arts programs for young people have been linked with
improved motivation, self-image, hope for the future and
self-esteem [29]. Where population-based studies have
been conducted, arts engagement has been associated with
perceptions of happiness and stress reduction [30, 31].
Study aims
The arts may have a unique contribution to make to popu-
lation health however, evidence-based, dose–response re-
search about (1) the general population, and (2) the art
people do as part of their everyday life, for enjoyment, en-
tertainment or as a hobby, rather than therapy, is limited
[32–34]. As pressure on health resources grow, many are
calling for holistic solutions that provide members of
the general population with knowledge, choice and the
capacity to attain higher levels of wellness and self-care
[35, 36]. A better understanding of the arts-mental health
relationship could contribute to population-based health
messages, strategies, policy and practice (e.g. social pre-
scribing or arts-on-prescription programs) [37]. As guided
by theories of social epidemiology [38] and the biopsycho-
social model of health [39], the first aim of this study was
to determine if there was a relationship between arts en-
gagement and mental well-being in the general popula-
tion. If an association was demonstrated, the second aim
was to quantify this relationship.
Methods
Participant recruitment and survey
Between September 2011 and May 2012, telephone in-
terviews were conducted with the Western Australian
community (18+ years). Western Australia is representa-
tive of the broader Australian population in terms of key
health and socio-demographic indicators [40]. Residen-
tial telephone numbers were randomly selected from the
Australian Electronic White Pages telephone directory.
The availability in Australia of a single telephone dir-
ectory in computer format presents a comprehensive

Page 2 of 10
 and cost-effective listing of residential “land-line” num-
bers [2, 41]. So as to be representative of the Western
Australian population, (1) the survey research centre was
given a sample target for location (30 % country) and sex
(50 % female), and (2) once contacted, the adult in the
household who would next be celebrating a birthday was
invited to participate in the study.
The telephone survey was developed by the research
team and guided by an online survey of 280 inter-
national experts in the field of the arts or arts-health re-
garding the definition of arts engagement for population
based research [16]. The resulting telephone survey was
reviewed by a panel of ten experts with experience in
market research, the arts and/or public health and carried
out by trained interviewers using a computer assisted tele-
phone interview system [42]. The survey took 15 min to
complete and included questions about mental well-being
(dependent variable), arts engagement over the previ-
ous 12 months (independent variable), and eleven pos-
sible confounding or effect modifying variables to the
arts-mental well-being relationship (i.e. sports engage-
ment, religious activities, holidays, general health, and
demographics).
Dependent variable: subjective mental well-being
The dependent variable in this study was subjective men-
tal well-being and measured by asking respondents the 14
items contained in the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-
being Scale (WEMWBS), i.e. I’ve been feeling … optimistic,
useful, relaxed, interested in others, good about myself,
close to others, confident, loved, cheerful; I’ve had energy to
spare; I’ve been … dealing with problems well, thinking
clearly, able to make up my own mind and interested in
new things [43]. WEMWBS measures the mental well-
being of the general population. The scale includes
hedonic (i.e. happiness, life satisfaction) and eudaimo-
nic (i.e. positive relationships, psychological functioning)
items which together measure mental well-being [44].
WEMWBS is designed to assess mental well-being itself
and not the determinants of mental well-being (i.e. resili-
ence, problem solving, etc.) [43]. WEMWBS was scored
by summing responses (i.e. 1 = none of the time to 5 = all
of the time) to each of the 14 items. WEMWBS popula-
tion scores approximate to a normal distribution, with a
minimum possible score of 14 and a maximum score of
70 (population average = 51) [43]. The scale has good face
validity, test-retest reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.83) and
internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89) [43]. WEMWBS
has been adapted for cross-cultural use in a number of
different countries and has been translated into several
languages [45]. Permission to utilise WEMWBS was
granted by the University of Warwick.
Independent variable: hours engaged in the arts
The independent variable in this study was total hours
engaged in the arts in the last 12 months. Quantifying
engagement by asking questions about: (1) activities and
events over the last 12 months, and (2) measurement in
terms of time, are common in the literature [46–49]. As
shown in Fig. 1, arts engagement was measured by
asking 14 questions, that is, attendance at arts events
(6 questions), participation in the arts (5 questions),
learning (1 question), work/volunteering (1 question)
and arts related membership (1 question).
For each survey item, respondents were asked if they
had engaged in the arts in the previous 12 months
A
Attendance: In the last 12 months, have you visited or attended any…
…performing arts events like plays or theatre events, arts house movies, dance 
performances, music recitals, live performances and concerts
…visual arts events at galleries and studios or art exhibitions of things like paintings, 
sculptures, craft, photography, fashion, jewellery, ceramics or textiles
…literary events such as book launches, author talks or book readings
…community arts festivals, fairs or cultural performances
… Artist talks or lectures about their work
…listened to or viewed an artwork, performance or literary event via a website, web 
stream or podcast
B
Participation: In the last 12 months have you …
…made or created any types of visual art such as paintings, drawings, craft, sculpture, 
photography, fashion, jewellery, ceramics or textiles
…written any literary art such as short stories, poetry, a novel or script
…made an electronic, digital or online art work such as an electronic painting, digital 
photography, animation, film or music recording
…participated in an event as a performer, dancer, singer, actor or musician
…participated in arts related rehearsals 
C
Learning: In the last 12 months did you take part in any arts related classes, 
workshops or training programs?
D
Work or volunteering: In the last 12 months did you work or volunteer in the arts? 
E
Membership: In the last 12 months, were you a member of an arts related society, 
club or organisation?

 (yes/no). If ‘yes’
, they were asked to describe the activity or
event. Respondents were then asked approximately how
many days in the last 12 months they had engaged in each
type of activity or event, followed by (on a typical day), how
many hours they spent engaging in that activity or event.
Confounding and effect modifying variables
To control for the influence of confounding and effect
modification, information about eleven possible covari-
ates to the arts-mental health relationship were collected
(Table 1). This included demographics (i.e. sex, age

 group, location, income, education, marital status, chil-
dren) and a self-assessment of general health. Respon-
dents were also asked if during the last 12 months, (1)
they partook in a holiday or break from work for two or
more consecutive weeks; (2) if at least once a week for
most weeks, they attended a religious service/event at a
place of worship (e.g. church, mosque, temple); or (3) if
at least once a week for most weeks they engaged in
sport (i.e. participation in sports activities, and/or at-
tendance at sports events as a spectator, and/or member-
ship of a sports organisation, society or club).
Data analysis
The analysis strategy involved a descriptive investigation
of the data followed by Pearson chi-square tests to explore
differences by arts engagement and ANOVAs to explore
differences in average WEMWBS scores. Arts ‘attendance’
in the previous 12 months was calculated based on re-
spondents indicating they had attended one or more of
the six survey items relating to attendance. Similarly,
‘participation’ in the previous 12 months was calculated
based on respondents indicating they had participated in
one or more of the five survey items relating to participa-
tion. A respondent was considered to be engaged in the
arts in the previous 12 months (prevalence) if they had
attended an arts event, and/or participated in the arts,
and/or took part in arts related learning, and/or worked
or volunteered in the arts (on a non-professional basis)
and/or had been a member of an arts organization, club
or society. ‘Total days engaged in the arts in the previous
12 months’ was calculated by summing together the
number of days respondents spent attending, partici-
pating, learning, working/volunteering or being a mem-
ber of an arts organization, club or society. ‘Hours per day
engaged in the arts in the previous 12 months’, was calcu-
lated by first multiplying hours on a typical day by number
of days engaged in each type of arts activity over the last
12 months, this was then summed and the total divided
by the sum of days engaged in each type of arts activity.
‘Hours per year engaged in the arts’, was calculated by first
multiplying hours on a typical day by number of days
engaged in each type of arts activity in the previous
12 months and summing each sub-total together. As the
distribution of arts engagement was positively skewed (i.e.
17 % did not engage in the arts at all, median = 23 hours/
year and 75th percentile = 100 hours/year) and the rela-
tionship between mental well-being and arts engagement
was non-linear, ‘hours per year engaged in the arts’ was
grouped into four categories: no art = 0 hours/year, low
arts engagement = 0.1 to 22.9 hours/year, medium arts en-
gagement = 23 to 99.9 hours/year and high arts engage-
ment = 100 or more hours/year. This was followed by
linear regression analyses to investigate the association be-
tween arts engagement and WEMWBS scores. Overall,
three models were fitted. The first model estimated the
direct (unadjusted) effect of arts engagement; the second
model estimated the effect of arts engagement after ad-
justment for demographics (i.e. age, sex, location, income,
education, marital status and children); and the third
model adjusted for demographics, general health, engage-
ment in sport, religious activities and holidays from work.
With the exception of the effect modification (i.e. inter-
action) analyses, results were assessed at the 0.05 level of
significance. Effect modification was assessed at the 0.01
level of significance to reduce the possibility of a finding
due to chance. The data were analysed using SPSS for
Windows (Version 21) and SAS for Windows (Version
9.3).
Ethics, consent and permissions
Potential respondents were provided with an explanation
of the study and invited to provide consent to participate
at the beginning of the telephone interview. The respon-
dents who agreed to take part in the study were assured
that their answers were confidential, that they could
withdraw from the study at any time and that all ques-
tions were voluntary. Respondents were made aware that
the information collected would be used for research
and publication purposes. Permission to conduct this
study was granted by The University of Western Australia
Human Research Ethics Committee (RA/4/1/2490).
Results
Overall, 989 phone numbers were called, of which 281
community members (28 %) declined to participate and
708 (72 %) completed an interview. Six respondents were
excluded from the analysis as they were professional art-
ists. This resulted in a sample of 702 community mem-
bers. A sample size of 702 provides 90 % power to detect
a difference of 0.25 standard deviations in average mental
well-being (WEMWBS) for higher versus lower levels of
arts engagement. Table 1 shows the demographic, engage-
ment and WEMWBS characteristics of respondents. For
comparison purposes the 2011 Western Australian popu-
lation profile was also included [50, 51].
Overall, 50 % of respondents were female, 9 % were
18–29 years, 9 % 30–39 years, 16 % 40–49 years, 24 %
50–59 years and 42 % 60+ years. Approximately two
thirds of respondents lived in the metropolitan area,
were married or in a de-facto relationship, engaged in
sport and had not attended a religious service/event in
the last 12 months. Twenty-eight percent of respondents
had a household income less than AUD$39,999 while
39 % reported their household income was AUD$80,000
or above. Approximately one third of respondents held
a university or higher degree. Most respondents described
their general health as good or very good (78 %). Approxi-
mately half of all respondents had taken a holiday or break
Davies et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:15 
Page 5 of 10
 from work (for two or more weeks) in the previous
12 months. Most respondents did not have children in
their household (71 %).
Arts engagement
As shown in Table 2, in the previous 12 months, 78 % of
respondents had attended an arts event; 48 % partici-
pated in the arts; 11 % took part in arts related learning;
11 % worked or volunteered in the arts and 10 % were a
member of an arts society, club or organisation. The
highest number of respondents attended a performing
arts (63 %) or visual arts event (51 %). On average, in
the previous 12 months, respondents spent 16 hrs at-
tending arts events; 63 hrs making or creating art; 5 hrs
learning about the arts; 9 hrs working or volunteering in
the arts (on a non-professional basis) and 7 hrs as a
member of a arts society, club or organisation. The
prevalence of arts engagement was 83 %. Respondents
spent an average of 101 hours/year engaging in an arts ac-
tivity or event (SD = 206, median = 23 hrs, minimum =
0 h, maximum = 1572 hrs).
When the data was grouped, 17 % of respondents did
not engage in the arts, 33 % had low arts engagement
(0.1 to 22.9 h/year), 24 % had medium arts engagement
(23 to 99.9 h/year) and 26 % had high arts engagement
(100 or more hours/year). As shown in Table 1, females
were significantly more likely to be engaged in the arts
than males (χ2 = 27.2 df = 1 p < 0.001); as were younger
compared to older respondents (χ2 = 12.7 df = 4 p = 0.013).
Arts engagement also significantly increased by education
(χ2 = 16.7 df = 2 p < 0.001), and was more likely in those
who also engaged in sport (χ2 = 17.1 df = 1 p < 0.001),
attended religious services/events (χ2 = 7.9 df = 1 p = 0.005)
and those who had taken a holiday or break from work for
two or more weeks in the previous 12 months (χ2 = 20.8
df = 1 p < 0.001).
Arts engagement and mental well-being
The WEMWBS mean score for respondents was 53.4
(median = 54.0, SD = 7.4, minimum = 21.0, maximum =
70.0). As shown in Table 1, respondents who were mar-
ried or in a defacto relationship had higher average
WEMWBS scores than unmarried respondents (F = 8.57
df = 1 p = 0.004); as did older compared to younger re-
spondents (F = 2.91 df = 4 p = 0.021). Average WEMWBS
scores were also significantly higher for those with good
general health (F = 24.63 df = 4 p < 0.001) and those
who had taken a holiday or break from work for two
or more weeks in the previous 12 months (F = 20.23
df = 1 p < 0.001).
As shown in Table 3, Model 1 (unadjusted), respon-
dents who engaged in a high level of arts engagement
had higher average WEMWBS scores (54.8) than those
who did not engage in the arts (52.8) or who had low
(52.6) or medium (53.4) levels of engagement. With the
exception of having “energy to spare”, for 13 out of the
14 WEMWBS questions, item means were highest for high

 religious activities and holidays (Overall Test - 4 groups
p = 0.003), it was found that people with a high level of
arts engagement (i.e. 100 or more hours/year) had
higher WEMWBS scores than those with none, low or
medium engagement. In comparison, people with none,
low and medium levels of arts engagement were found
to have similar WEMWBS scores (Model 3, Overall Test -
3 groups p = 0.358), therefore a trend analysis was not ap-
plicable. Overall, the relationship between arts engage-
ment and WEMWBS was nonlinear with evidence of a
minimum threshold at 100 or more hours of arts engage-
ment per year (i.e. high engagement vs non/low/medium
engagement, Model 3, Overall Test - 2 groups p = 0.0006).
A small decrease in significance level was found after
adjustment for confounding variables, while effect modifi-
cation by demographic, sport, religious activites, holidays
or general health was not found to be significant. In
general, respondents who participated in 100 or more
hours of arts engagement per year had WEMWBS scores
approximately two points higher than other levels of
engagements (i.e. one third of a standard deviation).
Discussion
This is the first study to quantify the dose–response rela-
tionship between recreational arts engagement and mental
health in a general population and is a starting point as to
whether a population-based arts engagement strategy can
be utilised to improve the mental well-being of the general
population. Encouraging the population to “shift” their
behaviour to encourage well-being is a common strategy
in the public health literature as this approach can benefit
more individuals (overall) than targeting only high risk
individuals. For example, a population approach to redu-
cing overweight/obesity might be to encourage the general
population to modify their diet and engage in adequate
levels of physical activity. Likewise, population-based strat-
egies to improving mental health could be to encourage
the general population to engage in activities and behav-
iours (e.g. via the arts) that foster well-being.
The literature suggests that two hours per week of
volunteering can increase mental well-being in older adults
[52]. A dose–response effect between psychosocial well-
being and leisure related physical activity (i.e. at least two
hours/week) has also been proposed [12]. After controlling
for a variety of covariates, an association between subject-
ive mental well-being (WEMWBS) and arts engagement
was found in this study. The relationship was nonlinear
with evidence of a minimum time threshold at 100 or
more hours of arts engagement per year (i.e. two or more
hours/week). The possibility of a threshold level of arts
engagement to obtain health benefits was alluded to by
McCarthy and Ondaatje who suggested that emotional
gains were likely to accrue once an individual attained a
certain level of understanding and knowledge about
an art-form, activity or event [53]. The group of re-
spondents who participated in 100 or more hours of

 arts engagement per year (high arts engagement) had
an average WEMWBS score approximately two points
higher than other groups highlighting the possibility
of a dose–response health effect.
This paper provides three important findings for health
professionals, clinicians, researchers, policy makers and
the general population, and as Western Australia is rep-
resentative of the broader Australian population, these
findings could be generalised to other Australian states/
territories and to countries with similar mental-health
and socio-demographic profiles to Australia. First, 100 or
more hours/year (i.e. two or more hours/week) of arts
engagement may have the potential to enhance mental
well-being in the general population. Second, when en-
gaging in creative activities and events, the amount of
time engaged in the arts, or ‘the art dose’, may be import-
ant in obtaining mental health benefits. Third, in time, if
the relationship between hours engaged in the arts and
good mental health is found to be causal, there is po-
tential for new and innovative ‘time based’ arts-mental
health campaigns, such as those used to promote the
health benefits of physical activity. For example, in West-
ern Australia, the National Heart Foundation and the
Department of Health were successful at developing and
implementing the ‘Find 30 – it’s not a big exercise’ and the
‘Find 30 everyday’ campaigns to promote the health bene-
fits of physical activity to the general population and
increase awareness of the amount of moderate-intensity
physical activity needed for good health (i.e. 30 min each
day) [54].
Conclusion
Strengths of this population-based study include its large
sample size, high response, detailed quantification of arts
engagement (hours per year), adjustment for a wide range
of confounders/effect modifiers to the arts-mental health
relationship and that the sample was representative of the
Western Australian population in terms of sex, location,
income, marriage and sports engagement. Limitations of
this study were that only people who had phone numbers
listed in the Australian Electronic White pages were asked
to participate and that there was an over representation of
older adults, people with a university or higher degree and
people without children in their household. As this study
was observational, it also precludes our ability to deter-
mine causality. For researchers to determine whether or
not a causal relationship exists between arts engagement
and mental well-being the following needs to occur: (1) a
plausible conceptual framework of the relationship be-
tween arts engagement and mental health including pos-
sible confounders and effect modifiers needs to developed;
(2) good study designs, that consider coherence and tem-
poral order, need to be employed; and (3) the strength,
consistency and specificity of the arts-mental health
relationship needs to be considered [55]. The cross-
sectional design of this study was cost-effective and ad-
equate as a starting point for assessing the relationship
between arts engagement and mental well-being how-
ever, future research should extend on current findings
via more robust study designs (e.g. prospective cohort
studies). Enablers and barriers to the arts-mental health
relationship should also be investigated, as should the in-
fluence of art form (e.g. visual arts, performing arts, etc.),
type (i.e. active versus receptive engagement), and mode
of engagement (e.g. attendance, participation, etc.) to de-
termine which elements have the most impact on mental
well-being. As arts engagement has also been linked with
social and physical health benefits [31], further research is
needed to quantify and explore the arts-social health and
the arts-physical health relationship. The ability of the arts
to promote, maintain and improve population health re-
quires further investigation as arts activities and events
have the potential to contribute to health promotion strat-
egies and have implications for innovative public health
policy and practice.
