Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine
whether microglial activity, measured using translocator-
protein positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, is in-
creased in unmedicated persons presenting with subclinical
symptoms indicating that they are at ultra high risk of
psychosis and to determine whether microglial activity is
elevated in schizophrenia after controlling for a translocator-
specific genetic polymorphism.
Method: The authors used the second-generation radio-
ligand [11C]PBR28 and PET to image microglial activity in the
brains of participants at ultra high risk for psychosis. Partic-
ipants were recruited from early intervention centers. The
authors also imaged a cohort of patients with schizophrenia
and matched healthy subjects for comparison. In total, 56
individuals completed the study. At screening, participants
were genotyped to account for the rs6971 polymorphism in
the gene encoding the 18Kd translocator protein. The main
outcome measure was total gray matter [11C]PBR28 binding
ratio, representing microglial activity.
Results: [11C]PBR28 binding ratio in gray matter was elevated
in ultra-high-risk participants compared with matched com-
parisonsubjects(Cohen’sd .1.2)andwaspositivelycorrelated
with symptom severity (r=0.730). Patients with schizophrenia
also demonstrated elevated microglial activity relative to
matched comparison subjects (Cohen’s d .1.7).
Conclusions: Microglial activity is elevated in patients with
schizophrenia and in persons with subclinical symptoms who
are at ultra high risk of psychosis and is related to at-risk
symptom severity. These findings suggest that neuroin-
flammation is linked to the risk of psychosis and related
disorders, as well as the expression of subclinical symptoms.

Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized
by psychotic and cognitive symptoms, and it is a leading cause
of global disease burden (1). It is generally preceded by
a prodromal phase of attenuated psychotic symptoms and
functional impairment (2). Individuals meeting standardized
criteria for this phase have an ultra high risk for developing
a psychotic disorder, in most cases schizophrenia (3). Ap-
proximately 35% of high-risk persons will develop a psy-
chotic disorder within 24 months (4).
While the pathoetiology of schizophrenia is not fully
understood, there is increasing evidence for the involvement
of neuroinflammatory processes. Microglia are the resident
immune cells of the CNS, and several lines of evidence in-
dicate microglial involvement in the pathology of psychosis
(5–7). In ultra-high-risk individuals, there are elevations in
the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (8), which are also
elevatedinpatientswithschizophrenia(9).Thelevelsofsuch
peripheralmarkershavealsobeenassociatedwithreductions
in gray matter volume in both ultra-high-risk individuals (10)
and patients with schizophrenia (11). Postmortem investi-
gationofbrain tissue has foundelevatedmicroglial cell density
(with a hypertrophic morphology) in persons with schizo-
phrenia compared withcontrol subjects(5), particularly in the
frontal and temporal lobes (12), although some studies have
found no differences (13). However, since microglial activity is
dynamic, postmortem studies may miss alterations early in the
development of the disease.

ARTICLES
 using PET in schizophrenia, in a cohort of 10 patients, revealed
a total gray matter elevation of microglial activity in the 5 years
following diagnosis (6). The most recent investigation in seven
chronically medicated patients with schizophrenia using
(R)-[11C]PK11195 demonstrated an elevation in hippocampal
binding potential and a nonsignificant 30% increase in total
gray matter binding potential (7).
While these studies indicate elevated microglial activity
in schizophrenia, they included patients in whom the dis-
order was already established. It is therefore unknown whether
this elevation predates the onset of, or becomes evident after,
the first episode of frank psychosis.
Therefore, in the present investigation, we sought to de-
termine whether microglial activity was elevated in ultra-high-
risk individuals using the novel TSPO radioligand [11C]PBR28.
Our a priori hypothesis was that microglial activity would be
elevated in the total gray matter in ultra-high-risk individuals
relative to matched comparison subjects. An additional pre-
diction was that this elevation would be evident in frontal and
temporal cortical regions,brainareasthathavebeenparticularly
implicatedinultra-high-riskpathophysiology(15).[11C]PBR28is
asecond-generationTSPOtracerwithahigheraffinityforTSPO
than (R)-[11C]PK11195 (16). Recent in situ binding evidence
showsthatageneticpolymorphism(aC/Tsubstitutionatrs6971)
influences the binding of TSPO tracers, including [11C]PBR28.
ThisresultsinthreeTSPObindingprofiles:high-affinitybinders
(C/C)havethegreatesttraceraffinity;low-affinitybinders(T/T)
have a 50-fold reduction in affinity; and mixed-affinity binders
(C/T) express both high-affinity binder and low-affinity binder
TSPOin approximatelyequal proportion (17). In viewof this,we
included a cohort of patients to test the hypothesis that TSPO
binding is elevated in schizophrenia after adjusting for this
polymorphism, since this has not been taken into account pre-
viously. We also tested the secondary hypothesis that there
would be a positive relationship between total gray matter
microglial activity and symptom severity.
METHOD
The study was approved by the local research ethics com-
mittee and was conducted in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. After complete description of the study to
the subjects, written informed consent was obtained.
Participants
A total of 56 individuals were recruited and completed the
study. Fourteen participantswho met ultra-high-riskcriteria,
as assessed on the Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk
Mental States (2), were recruited from OASIS (Outreach and
Support in South London) (18) (mean age=24.3 years
[SD=5.40]; male:female ratio=7:7). Fourteen age-matched
(SD=5 years) comparison subjects were recruited through
newspaper and poster advertisements. Fourteen persons
with schizophrenia (mean age=47.0 years [SD=9.31]; male:
female ratio=11:3) were recruited from mental health centers
inLondon(SouthLondonandMaudsleyNHSFoundationTrust).
An additional 14 age-matched (SD=5 years) healthy subjects
wererecruitedforcomparisonwiththissecondcohort(Table1).
All participants met the following inclusion criteria: 1)
aged $18 years, 2) no significant physical or psychiatric
health contraindications on assessment and medical exam-
ination by a trained physician.
Subjects were then screened based on the following ex-
clusion criteria:
1. Exposure to any medications, including anti-inflammatory
medications, in the last 1 month (see the data supplement
accompanying the online version of this article).
2. History of substance abuse/dependence as determined
by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I
Disorders, Clinician Version (SCID-CV) (19).
3. Benzodiazepine use, whether prescribed or not (20). One
subject was excluded due to a positive result for benzo-
diazepines on the scan day.
4. Historyofheadinjuryresultinginunconsciousness,orany
physical medical condition associated with inflammation.
5. Atthetimeofscreening,participantsweretestedforTSPO
genotype to determine binding status (17). Those with
a low-affinity binder genotype were excluded.
6. In ultra-high-risk individuals and comparison subjects:
antipsychotic medication exposure.
7. Significant prior exposure to radiation.
8. Pregnancy or breast feeding.
Healthy comparison subjects with a personal history
of a psychiatric disorder or a first-degree relative with
schizophrenia or a psychotic illness were excluded.
Clinical Measures
At screening, all participants were assessed using SCID-CV
(19). Ultra-high-risk individuals were assessed with the
Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk Mental States (2)
by a trained investigator, and patients with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia were assessed with the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (21) by a clinician on the day of the
PET scan. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (22).
PET Imaging
An initial low-dose transmission CT scan (0.34 mSv) was
acquired for attenuation and scatter correction using a
Siemens Biograph TruePoint PET/CT scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Participants then
received a bolus injection of [11C]PBR28 (mean Mbq activ-
ity=325.31 [SD=27.03]) followed by a 90-minute emission
scan. PET data were coregistered with whole-brain structural
imagesacquiredwitha3TMRIscanner(Trio,SiemensMedical
Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A 32-channel coil was used for
all but one scan, where a 12-channel coil was used instead.
PET Acquisition
PET data were acquired dynamically over a 90-minute time
window and binned into 26 frames (durations: 8315 seconds,

 331 minute, 532 minutes, 535 minutes, 5310 minutes).
Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection,
which provides better data quality and signal-to-noise ratio
overiterativemethods(23),andcorrectedforattenuationand
scatter. During the PET acquisition, arterial blood data were
sampled via the radial artery using a combined automatic-
manual approach. A continuous (one sample per second)
sampling system (Allogg ABSS, Mariefred, Sweden) mea-
sured whole-blood activity for the first 15 minutes of each
scan (see the online data supplement).
Structural MRI
Each subject underwent a T1 weighted MRI brain scan. MRI
images were used for gray/white matter segmentation and
region of interest (ROI) definition. A neuroanatomical atlas
(24) was coregistered on each subject’s MRI scan and PET
image using a combination of Statistical Parametric Mapping
8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and FSL (http://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl-4.1.9/) functions, implemented in
MIAKAT (http://www.imanova.co.uk). The primary region
ofinterestwastotalgraymatter.Secondaryregionsofinterest
were temporal and frontal lobe gray matter (12).
Image Analysis
All PET images were corrected for head movement using
nonattenuation-corrected images, since they include greater
scalp signal, which improves realignment compared with
attenuation-corrected images (25). Frames were realigned to
a single “reference” space identified by the individual
T1-weighted MRI scan. The transformation parameters were
then applied to the corresponding attenuation-corrected
PET frames, creating a movement-corrected dynamic im-
age for analysis. Regional time-activity curves were obtained
by sampling the image with the coregistered atlas. Hence
quantification of [11C]PBR28 tissue distribution was per-
formed using the two-tissue compartmental model ac-
counting for endothelial vascular TSPO binding (2TCM-1K)
(26), since this has been shown to have improved perfor-
mance compared with the two-tissue compartmental model
not accounting for endothelial binding (2TCM) (26). Nev-
ertheless, for completeness, we analyzed the data using the
2TCM as well (see Table S1 in the online data supplement).
Even after accounting for genotype, high intersubject vari-
ability is seen in imaging with TSPO tracers. With PK11195,
plasma protein binding is evident and may account for some
levels of variability with TSPO imaging (27). Indeed, TSPO
ligand quantification approaches mostly use tissue reference
methodologies (28). Analysis of PK11195 is conducted using
simplified reference tissue models and supervised cluster
analysis(29).Thismethodisnotapplicabletosecond-generation
TSPO tracers, including PBR28, since the higher ligand af-
finity leads to appreciable endothelial binding in the blood
brain barrier (26). As a result, it is not possible to identify
a supervised cluster for reference. Our outcome measure
therefore was the distribution volume ratio (the ratio of the
VT [volume of distribution] in the region of interest to VT in

MICROGLIAL ACTIVITY IN PSYCHOSIS RISK
 the whole brain) because this accounts for intersubject
variabilityintheinputfunction.Inthesecondaryanalyses,we
tested the regional specificity of group changes by comparing
distribution volume ratio between groups in regions (the
cerebellum and brainstem) where we did not expect marked
inflammatory changes based on the postmortem studies and
gray matter changes seen in people at risk of psychosis (30).
To test for nonspecific effects of normalization, our param-
eters used to normalize the PET signal were tested for group
differences. There are no differences in blood input function
or VT in normalization regions used (see Table S2 in the
online data supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Data, other than for gender and genotype, were shown to have
a normal distributionfollowing a Shapiro-Wilktest (31). Hence
parametric tests were implemented for all but gender and af-
finity analyses, where a Mann-Whitney U test was used. De-
mographic data and tracer activity data were analyzed using
independent-samples t tests. Multiple analysis of covariance
withBonferronicorrection(32)wasusedtodeterminewhether
there was an effect of group on [11C]PBR28 binding associated
microglial activity in the total gray matter, frontal lobe, and
temporal lobe. Therearedata to suggest that cortical microglial
density,hence TSPObinding, is elevatedwith aging(33),which
isalsoevidentinourdata(seeTableS3inthedatasupplement).
For this reason, we performedgroup-levelanalysis using age as
a covariate. There is a significantly higher binding of tracer in
high-affinity binders than mixed-affinity binders, and the
variation in signal from high-affinity binder and mixed-affinity
bindersubjectsishigh,with alargedegreeofoverlapacross the
binding statuses (see Figure S3 in the data supplement). Hence
we pooled the binding statuses in our groups and covaried for
genotype in our analysis (17). For all statistical comparisons,
alpha was set at a 0.05 threshold (two-tailed) for significance.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21 (IBM,
Armonk, N.Y.). Partial correlation analysis was used to test the
association of microglial activity with symptom severity and
total gray matter volumes, with age and affinity as covariates of
no interest.
RESULTS
Demographic Comparisons and Tracer Dosing
No significant demographic differences between the two
groups of comparison subjects and respective patient groups
were observed (Table 1). There were no differences in the
injected dose, injected mass, specific activity, parent plasma
fraction, or plasma over blood ratio between ultra-high-risk
individuals or patients with schizophrenia and their re-
spective comparison subjects (see Table S4 in the data
supplement).
[11C]PBR28 Distribution in Total Gray Matter Regions
The [11C]PBR28 distribution volume ratios in total gray
matter and frontal lobe and temporal lobe gray matter were
significantly increased in ultra-high-risk individuals when
compared with matched comparison subjects (Table 2,
Figure 1A). Similarly, patients with a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia had elevated [11C]PBR28 distribution volume ratios
in total, frontal lobe,and temporal lobe gray matter compared
with matched comparison subjects (Table 2, Figure 1B).
Secondary analysis to investigate regional specificity re-
vealed no difference between ultra-high-risk individuals or
schizophreniapatientsandrespectivecomparisonsubjectsin
cerebellar or brainstem distribution volume ratio (Table 2).
Representative PET images of comparison subjects, ultra-
high-risk individuals, and patients with schizophrenia are
presented in Figure 1C. When comparing regions using VT,
with either 2TCM or 2TCM-1K, no significant group dif-
ference was observed (see Table S5 in the data supplement).
Two subjects in the ultra-high-risk group had taken
citalopram in the past. However, only one was using the
medication at the time of the scan, and no other ultra-high-
risk participants had taken psychotropic drugs. Reanalysis
excluding the two subjects who had taken citalopram did not
alter the significant elevation in the [11C]PBR28 distribution
volume ratio in the high-risk group in the total (F=6.601,
df=22, 3, p=0.018) and frontal lobe (F=5.392, df=22, 3, p=0.030)
gray matter, but the finding in the temporal cortex was no
longer significant (p=0.149).

 Genotype-specific analysis. In further sensitivity analyses, we
repeated the analyses separately for high-affinity binders and
mixed-affinity binders in the ultra-high-risk group. This
showed that the elevation in the ultra-high-risk individuals
was present irrespective of whether the analysis was re-
strictedtohigh-affinitybindersormixed-affinitybinders(see
Table S6 and Figure S3 in the data supplement).

In patients with schizophrenia, there was no significant
correlation between total gray matter distribution volume
ratio and total PANSS score (see Figure S2 in the data sup-
plement). There was no relationship between depressive
symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory score) and

 normalization regions. Cerebellar normalization did not alter
the major regional findings (frontal lobe: p=0.001; temporal
lobe: p=0.006). White matter normalization performed simi-
larly to the cerebellum (see Table S7 in the data supplement).
DISCUSSION
Our main finding is that [11C]PBR28 binding ratio, a marker of
microglial activity, is elevated in people at ultra high risk of
psychosis, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d .1.2). Fur-
thermore, [11C]PBR28 binding ratio was associated with the
severity of symptoms in ultra-high-risk individuals, linking
elevated microglial activity to the expression of subclinical
psychotic symptoms. Importantly, we found no relationship
with depressive symptoms, suggesting elevated microglial
activity is specific to the development of psychotic-like
symptoms, rather than psychiatric symptoms in general. It
would be valuable to examine change in [11C]PBR28 signal
during the course of the prodromal period to determine
whether there is a change during the prodromal phase. Be-
cause the ultra-high-risk group, who had recently presented
to psychiatric services, was medication naive and had no
history of psychotic disorder, these findings cannot be at-
tributed to effects of previous illness or its treatment. In-
terestingly, at the time of this writing, one ultra-high-risk
participant transitioned to first-episode psychosis. This
participant had the highest total gray matter [11C]PBR28
signal in the cohort (distribution volume ratio=2.14). Follow-
up of the remaining participants is required to determine the
role of elevated TSPO availability in the onset of psychosis.
The present findings are consistent with recent evidence
of elevated peripheral inflammatory markers in people at
high risk of psychosis (8, 10) and suggest that elevated
microglial activity predates the onset of frank psychosis. We
also found evidence of elevated microglia activity in people
with schizophrenia relative to comparison subjects, with
a large effect size (Cohen’s d .1.7). This extends previous
PET studies that have not controlled for TSPO genotype (34),
a potential confound because genotype influences binding, by
showing that TSPO binding is elevated after controlling for
TSPO genotype. Our findings are also consistent with the
findings of a postmortem study in schizophrenia, which also
used PBR28. However, because it was in vitro, a two-point
assay was used to quantify specific PBR28 binding to show
elevated PBR28 binding in schizophrenia (35). We did not
find the same symptom correlation in schizophrenia patients
aswedidinultra-high-riskindividuals.Thismaybeduetothe
fact that these patients were not acutely unwell.
Limitations
Antipsychotic treatment is a potential confound in the
schizophrenia group (see Table S6 in the online data sup-
plement) but not the ultra-high-risk group. There is growing
evidence to suggest an influence of antipsychotic medication
on microglial cell dynamics, including evidence that anti-
psychotics may reduce microglial activity (36–38). Hence, in
future studies it would be preferable to investigate patients
with schizophrenia who are medication naive.
In the present investigation, we have used an approach to
analysis (accounting for endothelial and vascular binding)
that has been shown to be more reliable than alternative
approaches (26). This was applied in a standardized auto-
mated manner across groups and also applied to control
regions (brain stem and cerebellum) to examine the speci-

imaging microglia, including with [11C]PBR28, is that the
outcome measure is VT. Thus, the elevation in gray matter
could reflect increased nonspecific tracer binding as well
as biological signal. However, blocking studies have shown
that a substantial proportion of VT for [11C]PBR28 is spe-
cific binding to the TSPO (39), although the proportion in
schizophrenia remains to be determined.
In our sample, plasma input analysis resulted in an ap-
proximate 30% level of VT variability using the 2TCM ap-
proach. This variability is due in part to a small free fraction
(fp), which has been reported to introduce 29% variability
(see Table S8 in the data supplement [also see reference 26]).
This being the case, the noise and measurement error from fp
appears to be greater than the component it represents (40)
and obscures the signal difference in our cohorts. Indeed, the
variability of fp in our cohorts reaches 35% (9.9 [SD=3.5]),
resulting in a large VT variability. Further work is needed to
assess the full consequences of fp variability. Our normali-
zation approach does, however, remove individual variation
in fp, thus reducing intersubject variability.
We used the distribution volume ratio, in this case with
whole-brain signal as the normalization region, as our out-
come measure. We also showed that the main findings

 remained significant when other regions were used, sug-
gesting that the findings are robust to the method of nor-
malization. The use of distribution volume ratio analysis is
a standard approach in PET imaging that has recently been
appliedtosecond-generationTSPOtracers(41,42),including
using whole-brain normalization (43), as well as to the first-
generation TSPO tracer PK11195 (44, 45). Preclinical studies
have demonstrated that the distribution volume ratio ap-
proach is able to detect microglial changes due to in-
flammatory stimuli and have confirmed that elevated
distribution volume ratio signal corresponds to elevated
levels of TSPO and other markers of microglia measured ex
vivo using immunohistochemistry and/or autoradiography
(46–49). These preclinical studies thus indicate the func-
tional significance of elevated [11C]PBR28 distribution vol-
ume ratioand support further in vivoinvestigation in patients
to confirm the functional significance.
Normalization by the whole-brain VT raises a conceptual
issuebecausethewhole-brainVTincludesthegraymatterVT
as one constituent. The whole-brain VT also includes the VT
in other tissue compartments, including white matter and
subcortical structures.Thus, theelevation weseein theultra-
high-risk and schizophrenia groups could indicate a reduced
VTinoneormoreoftheseothercompartments.Furtherwork
to investigate changes in these compartments, for example,
using selective TSPO blockers, is required to test this
interpretation.
The normalization approach would likely account for
global group differences in nonspecific binding, but we can-
not exclude a gray matter selective increase in nonspecific
binding contributing to the elevations seen. While the signal-
to-noise ratio of [11C]PBR28 PET imaging is better relative to
first-generation tracers, it remains relatively low. However,
thisnoisewouldobscureadifferencebetween groups andthus
is unlikely to account for our findings. In this study, we did not
correct for possible partial volume effects. Given that brain
volume is generally reduced in schizophrenia, these would
tend to underestimate the elevations observed here and not
account for our group differences. There is a relatively higher
binding in comparison subjects matched to patients with
schizophrenia over those matched to the ultra-high-risk group.
This can be explained in part by age-associated increases in
TSPO but also by an increased number of mixed-affinity
binders in the ultra-high-risk matched comparison subjects.
Finally, it is important to note that not all the ultra-high-risk
participants will go on to develop a psychotic disorder, and we
will conduct clinical follow-up to determine whether the el-
evated microglial activity is specific to the development of the
disorder or risk factors for psychosis.
Implications
While TSPO may be expressed on astrocytes (49) and some
neuronal subtypes (50), it is predominantly expressed on
microglia (51). The direct biological relationship between
microglia and TSPO binding in vivo is not fully understood.
However, in nonhuman primates inflammation-induced
increases in microglial activity cause marked increases in
[11C]PBR28 signal, confirmed postmortem to be largely a
result of microglial binding (52). Microglia perform immune
surveillance roles, mount inflammatory response to injury
(53), and are involved in synaptic modulation in experience-
dependent plasticity (54). Interpretation of elevated activity
is therefore complex and not defined by “activated” or
“resting” states. The elevations presented here might reflect
aprotectiveresponsetriggeredbyassociatedpathology,suchas
glutamatergic excitotoxicity (55), or indicate a primary neu-
roinflammatory process linked to risk factors for psychosis and
the development of subclinical symptoms. When our findings
are interpretedwith evidence that anti-inflammatorydrugs are
effective in schizophrenia (56), particularly in addressing early
negativesymptoms(57),theysuggestthataneuroinflammatory
process is involved in the development of psychotic disorders.
While this indicates that anti-inflammatory treatment may be
effective in preventing the onsetof the disorder, furtherstudies
are required to determine the clinical significance of elevated
microglial activity.
Patient Perspective
Patient 1: Clinical vignette
“Well I like the idea of taking part in research. It’s nice to
try to help people find out what’s wrong.”
Patient 1 was the first patient I (P.S.B.) had met while
conducting clinical academic research. I had spoken to
her care coordinator with the local mental health trust in
South London, and after talking on the telephone, she
visited the Hammersmith Hospital. We had a long chat
about the research, and I, with support from Dr. Selvaraj,
screened her for the study. Patient 1 had lived in London
for her adult life and relied greatly on support from her
family and the local mental health trust; she had been
diagnosedwithschizophrenia13yearsago,atwhichpoint
she was placed under section (involuntary admission).
She spoke of her experience of schizophrenia and her
struggles to find a suitable medication; she was experi-
encing extrapyramidal side effects from her current re-
gime of paliperidone; however, she was “sticking with it
for now.” Following the MRI scan, she seemed glad to be
out of such a confined space and responded in a more
positive way to the open space of the positron emission
tomography scanner. I telephoned her after 24 hours to
check on the arterial site condition, which was “a little
bruised but getting better.” We stayed in touch during
the study, and she asked to be informed of more research
opportunities.

MICROGLIAL ACTIVITY IN PSYCHOSIS RISK
 CONCLUSIONS
Here we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of
elevatedbrainmicroglialactivityinpeopleatultrahighriskof
psychosis and show that greater microglial activity is asso-
ciated with greater symptom severity. We also demonstrate
the first in vivo elevations of TSPO binding in schizophrenia
with a second-generation tracer after adjusting for TSPO
genotyping. These findings are consistent with increasing
evidence that there is a neuroinflammatory component in the
development of psychotic disorders, raising the possibility
that it plays a role in its pathogenesis.
