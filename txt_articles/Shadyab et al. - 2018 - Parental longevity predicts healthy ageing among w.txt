Abstract
Objective: to examine the association of parental longevity with healthy survival to age 90 years.
Methods: this was a prospective study among a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 22,735 postmenopausal women
from the Women’s Health Initiative recruited from 1993 to 1998 and followed through 2017. Women reported maternal
and paternal ages at death and current age of alive parents. Parental survival categories were <70, 70–79 (reference), 80–89
and ≥90 years (longevity). Healthy ageing was defined as reaching age 90 without major chronic conditions (coronary heart
disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or hip fracture) or physical limitations.
Results: women whose mothers survived to ≥90 years were more likely to attain healthy ageing (OR, 1.25; 95% CI,
1.11–1.42) and less likely to die before age 90 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68–0.83). Women whose fathers survived to ≥90 years
did not have significantly increased odds of healthy ageing but showed 21% (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70–0.90) decreased odds
of death before age 90. Women whose mother and father both lived to 90 had the strongest odds of healthy ageing (OR,
1.38; 95% CI, 1.09–1.75) and decreased odds of death (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85). The proportion of healthy survivors
was highest among women whose mother and father lived to 90 (28.6%), followed by those whose mother only lived to 90
(23.2%).
Conclusions: parental longevity predicted healthy ageing in a national cohort of postmenopausal women, supporting the
view that genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors transmitted across generations may influence ageing outcomes
among offspring.

 Introduction
Achieving healthy ageing has become an important public
health priority in light of the rapidly growing ageing popula-
tion in the USA. The traditional definition of healthy ageing
encompasses the ability to reach old age with delayed onset
of age-related diseases and disabilities [1]. Individuals with
exceptional survival often remain healthier for longer peri-
ods of time and enjoy better physical function in late life,
such that their number of years of survival spent in good
health (i.e. healthspan) approaches lifespan [2, 3]. Although
genetic, epigenetic, behavioral and lifestyle factors may play
a role in this phenomenon [2, 4], factors predicting healthy
ageing remain incompletely understood.
Offspring of long-lived parents are more likely to not
only live longer, but to also delay onset of age-related dis-
eases (e.g. cardiovascular disease [CVD] and diabetes), have
fewer CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and have slower
declines in physical and cognitive function [5–20]. In the
New England Centenarian Study, offspring of centenarians
had 78%, 83% and 86% lower risk of developing myocar-
dial infarction, stroke and diabetes, respectively, than a simi-
larly aged referent cohort [5]. Among Ashkenazi Jewish
adults, individuals with either one or two compared with no
parents who survived to age 95 had reduced decline in
objectively-measured physical function during a median
3-year follow-up period [17].
Few studies have examined parental longevity in relation
to a composite measure of healthy ageing that includes
both avoidance of major diseases and disability. Previous
studies were also limited by small sample sizes and case-
control designs. A greater understanding of the role of par-
ental longevity in offspring ageing outcomes will shed light
on the interplay between demographic, lifestyle and inher-
ited factors allowing some individuals to age successfully.
Among the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), we examined
associations of maternal and paternal longevity with healthy
ageing, defined as survival to age 90 without major chronic
conditions (coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, diabetes,
cancer or hip fracture) or physical limitations.
Methods
Study population and design
The WHI is a large, prospective study investigating major
risk factors for chronic diseases among women. Study
details are described in Supplementary Methods, available at
Age and Ageing online and elsewhere [21]. Women were
recruited from 1993 to 1998 and participated in one or
more of three clinical trials or an observational study. This
study was restricted to participants born on or before 28
February 1927 who had potential, because of birth year, to
survive to age 90 during the follow-up period ending 28
February 2017. Only women who had complete informa-
tion on maternal or paternal survival, survival status and
physical function at age 90 were included, leading to an
analytic cohort of 22,735 women with up to 22 years of
follow-up. All participants provided written informed con-
sent, and institutional review board approval was received
by all participating institutions.
Parental survival variables
At baseline, women were asked, by questionnaire, whether
their natural mother and/or father was still alive. Women
who responded affirmatively were asked their natural
mother’s or father’s current age (<70, 70–79, 80–89, 90–99
or ≥100 years). Women with deceased parents were subse-
quently asked at what age their biological parents died,
selecting from the following categories: <40, 40–49, 50–59,
60–69, 70–79, 80–89, 90–99 or ≥100 years. Parental lon-
gevity was defined as having a mother or father who sur-
vived to ≥90 years. Maternal and paternal survival variables
were categorized as follows: <70, 70–79, 80–89 or ≥90
years. These variables included women whose natural par-
ent died and those whose natural parent was still alive and
≥90 years; women whose natural mother or father was still
alive but did not reach age 90 were excluded from these
variables (n = 121). A third variable representing the num-
ber of long-lived parents was created among women with
deceased parents, with the following categories: no parent
lived to 90; only father lived to 90; only mother lived to 90
and both mother and father lived to 90.
Study variables
At baseline, participants completed questionnaires assessing
age, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, diet
quality, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity,
depressive symptoms and self-rated health. Trained clinic
staff measured height and weight at baseline. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. Information on history of age-
related diseases (CHD, stroke, cancer, diabetes and hip frac-
ture) was collected at baseline and follow-up (Supplementary
Methods, available at Age and Ageing online).
Study outcome
Participants were classified as having survived to age 90 or
died before this age. Trained physician adjudicators con-
firmed deaths according to hospital records, autopsy or cor-
oner’s reports or death certificates. Periodic linkage to the
National Death Index was performed for all participants,
including those lost to follow-up, for verification if medical
records or death certificates were not available.
Healthy ageing was defined as survival to ≥90 years
without a history of major age-related diseases and with no
limitations in physical function. Although there is no stand-
ard definition of healthy ageing, previous definitions were
based on Rowe and Kahn’s model, which includes avoid-
ance of major diseases and the maintenance of high phys-
ical function [1, 22–24]. Late-life physical function status
was determined using the physical function subscale of the
854

 RAND 36-item Health Survey collected within 2 years of
the 90th birth year and with the least missing data [25].
Values on this scale range from 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating better function. Good physical function was
defined as not reporting any of the following limitations, as
previously described: limited at least ‘a little’ on moderate
activities (moving a table, vacuuming, bowling, or golfing;
climbing one flight of stairs; walking more than one mile;
walking several blocks or bathing or dressing) or limited ‘a
lot’ on difficult activities (running, lifting heavy objects or
strenuous sports; lifting or carrying groceries; climbing sev-
eral flights of stairs; or bending, kneeling or stooping) [22].
The outcome variable had three categories, defined similarly
to previous studies: healthy survival (survived to age 90 and
met the definition of healthy ageing); usual survival (sur-
vived to age 90 but did not meet the definition of healthy
ageing) and died before age 90 [22–24].
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of baseline characteristics by maternal sur-
vival, paternal survival and number of long-lived parents
were performed using chi-square tests for categorical vari-
ables. Normally distributed and non-normally distributed con-
tinuous variables were compared by parental survival using
analysis of variance and Kruskal–Wallis tests, respectively.
The analytic approach for this study was similar to pre-
vious studies examining predictors of ageing outcomes
[22–24]. Multinomial logistic regression models were used
to examine associations of maternal survival, paternal sur-
vival and number of long-lived parents with healthy ageing,
with results reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI). Separate models were fit for each par-
ental survival variable. The reference category for parental
survival variables was 70–79 years, because this age range
includes the current average age at death, 78.8 years, in the
USA [26]. Usual survivors were considered the reference
category for the outcome in the analyses. Multivariable
models were adjusted for potential confounders including
baseline age, WHI study membership (clinical trial or
observational study), race/ethnicity, education, marital sta-
tus, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet
quality, depressive symptoms, self-rated health and BMI,
variables associated with longevity and healthy ageing [22–
24]. Tests for linear trend were performed by including
parental survival variables as continuous predictors in the
models.
In sensitivity analyses, to check for potential bias due to
missing late-life functional data, women who survived to age
90 but had missing information on physical function were
assumed to have physical limitations at this age in the
models. To test the robustness of our definition of healthy
ageing, alternative definitions were considered using differ-
ent classifications for physical limitation. First, physical
function was categorized according to the median, with
good function indicated by a total score >45. Second,
rather than including all domains of function, only
mobility was examined; women who reported that their
health limited ‘a lot’ or ‘a little’ their ability to walk one
block or climb one flight of stairs were classified as having
mobility disability.
P-values were two-tailed and considered statistically sig-
nificant at P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS
Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Women were aged 73.5 (standard deviation 2.6; range, 68–81)
years on average at baseline. Among the overall cohort, 19.0%
experienced healthy survival to age 90, 27.6% had usual sur-
vival to age 90, and 53.5% died before age 90.
At baseline, women whose mothers lived longer were
more likely to be white, college graduates, married or living as
married, and current drinkers, and have excellent self-rated
health, higher incomes and higher diet quality (Table 1). They
were less likely to be obese, have depressive symptoms, or
experience age-related diseases including CHD, stroke or
diabetes. Similar differences were observed when comparing
women according to paternal survival and number of long-
lived parents (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1, available at
Age and Ageing online).
Compared with women whose mothers lived to 70–79
years, women whose mothers lived to ≥90 years had 25%
(OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11–1.42) increased odds of survival
to age 90 without major diseases or physical limitations
(Table 3). Women whose mothers lived to ≥90 years had
25% (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68–0.83) decreased odds of
death before age 90. Compared with women whose fathers
lived to 70–79 years, women whose fathers achieved lon-
gevity did not have increased odds of healthy ageing (OR,
1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.29) but had 21% (OR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.70–0.90) decreased odds of death before age 90. Increasing
maternal and paternal survival were significantly linearly asso-
ciated with healthy ageing (P-values for trend = 0.008 and
0.006, respectively) and death before age 90 (P-values for
trend = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively).
Compared with women without any long-lived parents,
women with only long-lived mothers had increased odds of
healthy ageing (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06–1.32), whereas women
with only long-lived fathers did not have increased odds of
healthy ageing (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.95–1.32) (Table 3).
Women with a single long-lived parent had similar decreased
odds of death before age 90 (Table 3). The strongest odds of
healthy ageing were among women whose mother and father
both lived to 90 (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09–1.75); these women
were also the least likely to die before age 90 (OR, 0.68; 95%
CI, 0.54–0.85). Women with two long-lived parents had the
highest proportion of healthy survivors (28.6%), and women
with no long-lived parent had the highest proportion of death
before age 90 (56.2%) (Supplementary Figure 1, available at
Age and Ageing online).
In sensitivity analyses assuming that women with missing
data on physical function had physical limitations at age 90,
findings in multivariable models were similar. In analyses using

 alternative classifications for physical limitation in definitions
of healthy ageing, findings were similar (data not shown).
Discussion
Among a national cohort of >22,000 postmenopausal
women, parental longevity predicted survival to age 90 free
of major age-related diseases and physical limitations.
Women whose mothers survived to ≥90 years had 25%
increased likelihood of achieving healthy ageing. Having
both a mother and father who achieved longevity was asso-
ciated with the strongest likelihood of healthy ageing. These
findings support the notion that individuals with familial
longevity may be more likely to not only achieve longevity

bidity or disability.
Our findings agree with prior studies showing that off-
spring of long-lived parents may live longer and healthier
lives [5–20]. A study among Italians observed that, com-
pared with an age-matched group without long-lived parents
and from a similar birth cohort, offspring of centenarians had
lower BMI and smaller proportion of obese individuals, and
were also more likely to be able to walk 500 meters without
requiring help [20]. In a recent study among >186,000 par-
ticipants, increasing parental survival was associated with
greater education, higher income, more physical activity,
less smoking and lower prevalence of obesity, similar to
our study [6]. We found that parental longevity predicted

Parental longevity predicts healthy ageing among women
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/47/6/853/5067592 by guest on 04 June 2019
 healthy ageing after adjustment for these confounders,
suggesting that sociodemographic and lifestyle factors do
not entirely explain associations of parental longevity with
healthy ageing.
Parental longevity likely represents the combined effects
of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors transmit-
ted across generations that, throughout the life course,
influence ageing outcomes among offspring. The protective
association between parental longevity and adverse health
outcomes may be largely due to genetic factors [4, 27, 28].
In a recent genome-wide association study, 10 genetic loci
were associated with attained parental age, including
APOE, a gene associated with longevity [4, 27, 28]. In the
WHI, single nucleotide polymorphisms representing vari-
ation in APOE were associated with longevity and a com-
posite outcome of healthy ageing defined similarly to the
one used in the present study [27]. Offspring may inherit
genetic factors that protect against major diseases and dis-
ability; however, it is unknown whether a similar set of gen-
etic factors influences both disease and disability.
The ability to maintain physical function in old age is a
key component of healthy ageing [1]. Parental longevity has
been linked to less decline in physical function in ageing
[17, 18]. Besides environmental factors, variation in late-life
disability is also partly attributable to genetic factors [29,
30], a finding that is supported by the association of paren-
tal longevity with survival to age 90 without physical limita-
tions in the present study. Variation in APOE has been
associated with increased risk of gait speed decline and
disability among community-dwelling older adults and was
associated with disability-free survival in the WHI [27, 30].
Our study has several limitations. Women who con-
sented to further follow-up were more likely to be white,
educated, and healthier at baseline than those who were lost
to follow-up, thus findings may be biased by selective attri-
tion. Parental age at death was based upon participant
report and not validated, which may have resulted in mis-
classification. Women whose natural mother or father was
still alive but did not reach age 90 were not included; how-
ever, as reported, a small number of women met this criter-
ion. We did not evaluate cognitive outcomes, such as
dementia, in our definition of healthy ageing, due to limited
data because they were not collected regularly among all
WHI participants. Finally, we lacked information on paren-
tal cause of death.
Strengths of our study include the ethnically diverse
cohort, large sample size and 22 years of follow-up with
information on late-life physical function. Our study exam-
ined a large number of women who survived to age 90 and
who achieved healthy ageing as defined by this study. We
were able to examine both paternal and maternal survival
and had information on many confounders and adjudicated
chronic diseases. Finally, any confounding due to birth
cohort effects was minimized due to the narrow baseline
age range of the cohort.
In summary, maternal and paternal longevity predicted
survival to age 90 without major chronic conditions or
physical limitations in a national cohort of postmenopausal

 women. Our findings suggest that daughters of long-lived
parents may be more likely to live a long and healthy life.
From a public health perspective, future studies with life
course data are needed to clarify how environmental factors
and behaviors, some of which are transmitted across gen-
erations, interact with genetic and epigenetic factors to
influence ageing outcomes.
Key points
• We examined the association between parental longevity
and healthy ageing to 90 years among women.
• Women whose mother and father both lived to 90 had
the greatest chances of achieving healthy ageing.
• Examined separately, maternal, but not paternal, longevity
was associated with increased likelihood of healthy ageing.
• Daughters of long-lived parents may be more likely to live
a long and healthy life.
• Genetic, environmental and behavioral factors transmitted
across generations may influence ageing outcomes among
offspring.

Abstract
Objective: research on the role of positive affect, such as happiness, on health outcomes is burgeoning. Within this context,
evidence for an inverse effect of happiness on mortality is inconclusive. Furthermore, few studies link happiness with mor-
tality among older people, and in Asian populations. We examine the association between happiness and all-cause mortality
among older people in Singapore.
Methods: data for 4,478 Singaporeans aged ≥60 years enrolled in a nationally-representative longitudinal survey (three
waves: 2009; 2011; 2015) were utilised. Happiness, at baseline, in 2009, was measured using three positively-worded items
from the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and considered in two distinct ways in the analyses—con-
tinuous (‘happiness score’ [0–6]) and binary (happy [score = 6]/unhappy). All-cause mortality, until 31 December 2015, was
