There is growing concern about how participation in contact sports affects the brain. 
Retrospective evidence suggests that contact sports are associated with long-term 
negative health outcomes. However, much of the research to date has focused on 
 
former athletes with significant health problems. Less is known about the health of current 
athletes in contact and collision sports who have not reported significant medical issues. 
In this cross-sectional study, advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to 
evaluate multiple aspects of brain physiology in three groups of athletes participating 
in non-contact sports (N = 20), contact sports (N = 22), and collision sports (N = 23). 
Diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess white matter microstructure based on mea-
sures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD); resting-state functional MRI 
was used to evaluate global functional connectivity; single-voxel spectroscopy was used 
to compare ratios of neural metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine 
(Cr), choline, and myo-inositol. Multivariate analysis revealed structural, functional, and 
metabolic measures that reliably differentiated between sport groups. The collision group 
had significantly elevated FA and reduced MD in white matter, compared to both contact 
and non-contact groups. In contrast, the collision group showed significant reductions in 
functional connectivity and the NAA/Cr metabolite ratio, relative to only the non-contact 
group, while the contact group overlapped with both non-contact and collision groups. 
For brain regions associated with contact sport participation, athletes with a history of 
concussion also showed greater alterations in FA and functional connectivity, indicating 
a potential cumulative effect of both contact exposure and concussion history on brain 
physiology. These findings indicate persistent differences in brain physiology for athletes 
participating in contact and collision sports, which should be considered in future studies 
of concussion and subconcussive impacts.

While the majority of athletes who participate in collision and 
contact sports do not present with debilitating clinical outcomes, 
there is a growing concern for the long-term brain health of 
these athletes. These concerns largely stem from studies that have 
identified elevated risk of depression, memory problems, cogni-
tive impairments, and earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease among 
former professional football players (1–3). In addition, there is 
literature linking repetitive head impacts to neurodegeneration 
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) (4, 5), although the 
etiology of CTE is the subject of ongoing debate. To date, there has 
been limited research examining the brain health of athletes who 
are actively participating in contact sports. These athletes may be 
exposed to hundreds of impacts over a single season (6, 7) and 
may be at risk of cumulative effects caused by repeated subcon-
cussive blows (8). However, there have been inconsistent findings 
regarding the negative short-term cognitive effects of athletes 
exposed to repetitive head impacts over a single season compared 
to non-contact athletes (9–12). Evaluating the brain physiology 
of current contact and non-contact athletes may therefore help 
improve our understanding of the etiology underlying potential 
long-term health consequences of contact exposure.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive 
technique that is capable of measuring alterations in the brain 
structure, function, and neural metabolite concentrations. 
In recent years, several studies have used MRI sequences to 
demonstrate longitudinal changes in neurobiology associated 
with subconcussive impacts. Chun et al. (13) used diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the microstructure of white 
matter in a group of high school football players, showing a 
correlation between white matter abnormalities and exposure to 
head impacts. Similarly, another study by Abbas et al. (14) used 
functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate functional connectivity of the 
resting brain for football players over a single season, showing 
increased functional connectivity between brain regions associ-
ated with the default mode network (DMN) (15). In alignment 
with these findings, Johnson et al. (16) also reported altered 
functional connectivity of the DMN for rugby players following 
participation in a full-contact game. In addition, Poole et al. (17) 
used single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) to quantify metabolite lev-
els in the brains of football players before and after a competitive 
season, showing significant deviations from baseline at the end 
of the season. Collectively, these results demonstrate significant 
variations in the brain structure, function, and neural metabolite 
levels among contact sport participants within a single game or 
over the course of a season.
To date, studies have primarily focused on male, American 
football players spanning a single season. Much less is known 
about MRI measures of brain structure and function associated 
with sport participation across the wider sporting community, 
which encompasses male and female athletes at different levels 
of contact exposure. In addition, prior studies examining contact 
sports have focused exclusively on a single MRI parameter, 
providing limited information about the relationship between 
the different MRI measures of brain structure and function. As 
defined by Meehan et al. (18), sports may be categorized into 
three subsets based on the level of contact exposure: non-contact, 
contact (body-to-body contact allowed, but not purposeful colli-
sions), or collision (routine, purposeful body-to-body collisions). 
It is currently unknown whether there are consistent differences 
in brain structure, function, and neural metabolites associated 
with participation in these different sport categories.
In the present study, these gaps in knowledge are addressed 
by providing a comprehensive examination of MRI measures 
of white matter microstructure (DTI), resting brain function 
(fMRI) and neural metabolites (SVS). Three groups of athletes 
(i.e., drawn from non-contact, contact and collision sports) were 
examined preseason, to determine whether there are persistent 
“baseline” neurobiological differences between groups. This has 
significant implications for neuroimaging of athletes, by estab-
lishing whether there are persistent markers of contact exposure 
which are not attributable to recent concussive or subconcussive 
impacts acquired during competitive play. This study employed 
a representative sample of the currently active athlete popula-
tion, which included healthy athletes who do not present with 
significant clinical impairments. Each MRI measure was tested 
for reliable differences between groups using a flexible multivari-
ate modeling approach. An additional set of analyses examined 
whether brain regions that showed significant effects of contact 
exposure were also affected by prior concussion history.

Participants
Sixty-five athletes were recruited from interuniversity (“varsity”) 
teams at a single institution via the Sport Medicine Clinic, includ-
ing 20 athletes from non-contact sports, 22 athletes from contact 
sports, and 23 from collision sports. Athletes were approached 
during preseason baseline testing and were reimbursed for their 
time with a token monetary compensation, in accordance with 
Research Ethics Board (REB) guidelines. Imaging was conducted 
at the start of their respective competitive seasons to focus on 
persistent markers of contact sport participation, control for 
transient physiological effects during competition and minimize 
exposure to recent subconcussive impacts. Athletes were matched 
across groups on sex and prior concussion history, both of which 
have been previously identified as risk modifiers for concussion 
(19). Participant demographics and sport representations are 
listed in Table 1. All athletes were required to have sustained no 
concussions within the 6 months prior to imaging; for athletes 
with a history of concussion, the median time since their last 
injury was 2 years (range: 9 months to 8 years). Preseason assess-
ments were also conducted in-clinic using the Sport Concussion 
Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) (20) to evaluate symptoms, cognitive 
function, and balance. This study was carried out in accordance 
with the recommendations of the Canadian Tri-Council Policy 
Statement 2 and the REBs of the University of Toronto and 
 
St. Michael’s Hospital, with written informed consent from all 
participants. All participants gave written informed consent 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol 
was approved by the REBs of the University of Toronto and 
 
St. Michael’s Hospital.

Magnetic resonance imaging
Participants were imaged at St. Michael’s Hospital using an 
MRI system operating at 3 T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens, 
Erlangen, Germany) and standard 20-channel head receiver coil. 
Multimodal MRI was acquired for all participants, with analysis 
and preprocessing details provided below.
Anatomical Imaging
To perform between-subject alignment of fMRI data, T1-weighted 
MPRAGE was obtained, with field of view (FOV) = 24 cm × 24 cm, 
240 × 240 × 192 acquisition matrix, 0.9 mm isotropic voxels, 
bandwidth = 250 Hz/Pixel, inversion time (TI)/echo time (TE)/
repetition time (TR) = 850/2.63/2,000 ms, and flip angle = 8o. 
In addition, FLAIR was obtained to assess for structural lesions, 
with FOV = 22 cm × 18.6 cm, 256 × 196 acquisition matrix, 
1.1 mm × 0.9 mm × 3.0 mm voxels, TI/TE/TR = 2,200/96/9,000 ms. 
Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired to assess for vascu-
lar abnormalities, with 220 × 192 FOV
, 0.6 mm × 0.6 mm × 1.2 mm 
voxels. TE/TR = 20/28 ms, flip angle = 15°, 384 × 307 with encoding 
gap of 0.2 mm.
White Matter Microstructure
Diffusion-weighted imaging was acquired with 30 encoding 
directions (b = 700 s/mm2, FOV = 24 cm × 24 cm, 120 × 120 
acquisition matrix, 66 axial slices, 2 mm isotropic voxels, 
TE/TR = 83/7,800 ms, bandwidth = 1,736 Hz/Px). The FSL1 
eddy_correct protocol was used to perform simultaneous

correction of eddy currents and rigid-body motion correc-
tion, bet was used to mask out non-brain voxels, and dtifit was 
used to calculate voxelwise measures of fractional anisotropy 
(FA), which reflects the directionality of water diffusion 
in white matter tracts and mean diffusivity (MD), which 
quantifies the total amount of water diffusion, independent 
of direction. The individual subject FA and MD maps were 
co-registered to a common template space, based on the FSL 
FDT protocol: (1) individual masked FA maps were eroded 
by 1 voxel width at brain edges and co-registered to the 
FMRIB58 template (1 mm3) via affine transform, using flirt; 
 
(2) a symmetric, study-specific template was computed by aver-
aging transformed FA maps and then re-averaging with flipped 
left/right orientations; (3) the average template was used as a 
reference and non-linear registration of FA maps performed 
using fnirt, which were used to update the study-specific tem-
plate; and (4) the FA maps were registered to the new template 
via fnirt and the mean template was updated again. During the 
final registration step, images were resampled to 2 mm3 resolu-
tion. Prior to analysis, images were also convolved with a 6-mm 
full width at half maximum (FWHM) 3D Gaussian smoothing 
kernel, to minimize the effects of local variations in white 
matter structure. The analyses were performed within a mask 
of regions with a mean FA > 0.20, to restrict analyses to prob-
able white matter tracts. The brainstem and cerebellum were 
also manually segmented and removed, to avoid confounding 
effects of spatial registration errors caused by significant mag-
netic field inhomogeneity in these regions. Subsequent analyses 
compared FA and MD brain maps between the sport groups.
Brain Function
Resting-state fMRI was acquired via multi-slice T2*-weighted echo 
planar imaging (FOV = 20 cm × 20 cm, 64 × 64 matrix, 32 slices, 
3.125 mm × 3.125 mm × 4.5 mm voxels, TE/TR = 30/2,000 ms, 
flip angle = 70°, and oblique axial interleaved), producing a 
time series of 194 images. During acquisition, participants were 
instructed to lie still with their eyes closed and not focus on any-
thing in particular. Processing and analysis were performed using 
the Analysis of Functional Neuroimages (AFNI) package2 and 
customized algorithms developed in the laboratory. This included 
rigid-body motion correction (AFNI 3dvolreg), removal of outlier 
scan volumes using the SPIKECOR algorithm,3 slice-timing cor-
rection (AFNI 3dTshift), spatial smoothing with a 6-mm FWHM 
isotropic 3D Gaussian kernel (AFNI 3dmerge), and regression 
of motion parameters and linear-quadratic trends as nuisance 
covariates. To control for physiological noise, data-driven correc-
tion was performed using the PHYCAA + algorithm,4 along with 
regression of white matter signal, using the FSL fast algorithm to 
segment the T1 anatomical scan and regress out mean signal in 
white matter voxels (p > 0.95). The fMRI data were coregistered 
into a common template space by computing the rigid-body 
transform of the mean fMRI volume for each participant to 
their T1-weighted anatomical image and the 12-parameter

affine transformation of the T1 image for each participant to the 
MNI152 template. The transformation matrices were concat-
enated and the net transform applied to fMRI data, resampled 
at 2-mm3 resolution. Global functional connectivity (Gconn) 
was then estimated for each voxel, by computing the functional 
connectivity with all other brain voxels, as the Pearson correlation 
between fMRI time series. Gconn was measured as the mean of 
all (positive) connectivity values, providing a voxelwise measure 
of total integrative function. Subsequent analyses compared the 
Gconn brain maps between the different sport groups.
Neural Metabolites
Single-voxel 1H spectroscopy data were acquired for two regions 
of interest, placed on left and right hand motor knobs. This 
was obtained via stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) 
for 2 cm isotropic voxels (TM/TE/TR = 10/30/2,000 ms; 
bandwidth = 1,200 Hz; FA = 40°; 100 acquisitions; 1,024 
points). Regions were placed on an AC-PC-oriented axial slice 
corresponding to the region of interest first and confirmed 
using coronal and axial views to ensure adequate distance from 
ventricles, fatty tissue, and bone. Processing and analysis was 
conducted using the TARQUIN software package5 with default 
preprocessing parameter settings for STEAM, to obtain relative 
metabolite concentration values. The following metabolites were 
then analyzed: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine 
(Cr), and myo-inositol (Ins). All six unique pairwise ratios of 
the different metabolites were compared between sport groups 
(NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, Ins/Cr, Ins/Cho, Cho/Cr, and NAA/Ins), 
after averaging ratio values across left- and right-side motor 
cortex.
statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB. An initial 
set of analyses compared the symptom score profiles for the non-
contact, contact and collision groups. The SCAT3 symptom sever-
ity scores were based on a 22-item symptom scale, each assessed 
on a 7-point Likert scale. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests 
were used to compare SCAT3 total severity (summed over all 
symptom subscales), along with cognitive and balance error 
scores for athletes in contact and collision sports, relative to non-
contact athletes. In addition, total severity was compared for four 
specific symptom clusters: somatic (headache, pressure in head, 
neck pain, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, balance 
problems, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to noise), cognitive 
(feeling slowed down, feeling “in a fog,” “don’t feel right,” difficulty 
concentrating, difficulty remembering, confusion), fatigue and 
sleep problems (fatigue/low energy, drowsiness, trouble falling 
asleep), and emotional (more emotional, irritability, sadness, 
nervous/anxious). Correction for multiple comparisons was 
subsequently performed across all subscales, at a false-discovery 
rate (FDR) of 0.05.
Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was per-
formed for each MRI measure (FA, MD, Gconn, and metabolite 
ratios). This widely used linear latent variable model identifies

brain regions that show significant covariation across groups 
(21–23). Mean-centered task PLS was used to identify patterns 
of brain voxels (FA, MD, and Gconn) or metabolite ratios that 
show covariation across the three sport groups (non-contact, 
contact, and collision). Each task PLS analysis produced a pat-
tern of “voxel” (or “metabolite”) saliences, reflecting the impor-
tance of specific brain regions (or metabolite ratios), and a set of 
“group” saliences, reflecting how much each group expressed the 
associated brain pattern. The first PLS component is reported 
for each MRI modality, which explains the greatest amount of 
data covariance.
The significance of PLS saliences was evaluated via bootstrap 
resampling (1,000 iterations for each analysis). The significance 
of voxel (or metabolite) saliences was expressed as the bootstrap 
ratio of (mean/SE) for each variable. For FA, MD, and Gconn, 
correction for multiple comparisons was obtained by apply-
ing a voxel-level significance threshold of p < 0.005, followed 
by cluster-size thresholding using AFNI (see text footnote 
2) program 3dFWHMx to estimate spatial smoothness and 
3dClustSim to identify the minimum cluster size at an adjusted 
p = 0.05 threshold. Thresholded brain maps are shown as maxi-
mum intensity projections in each imaging plane, centered on 
the MNI space coordinates (x = 8, y = −14, and z = 6). For 
SVS, correction for multiple comparisons was performed at an 
FDR of 0.05. Post hoc bootstrapped p values were computed 
on the difference in group saliences between each pair of sport 
groups, also corrected at an FDR of 0.05. Finally, the distribu-
tion of subject MRI values was plotted for each sport group, by 
computing the average over all significant voxels (or metabolite 
ratios) for each athlete.
For each MRI measure, further analysis was performed to 
determine whether the brain regions (or metabolite ratios) show-
ing significant variation across sport groups were also affected 
by concussion history. The mean value was computed within 
significant brain regions for each subject, and then the mean 
difference was computed between all athletes with a history of 
concussion (n = 27) relative to those without prior concussion 
(n = 37). Bootstrap resampling was then performed to obtain the 
95% confidence interval (CI) on mean differences, along with the 
empirical p value, under the one-tailed hypothesis that concussion 
shows a similar direction of effect as contact exposure. For MRI 
measures showing a significant relationship, an additional set of 
post hoc analyses tested for differences associated with concussion 
history within individual sport groups (non-contact, contact, and 
collision), to determine whether a specific sport group showed 
greater effects of concussion history.

clinical Data
Table 1 summarizes the demographic information for each of the 
three athlete groups. There were no significant between-group 
differences for sex and prior concussion history (p ≥ 0.11 uncor-
rected for all comparisons, Mann–Whitney tests). Examining 
preseason symptom scores, total symptom severity was not 
significantly different between groups (p ≥ 0.18, all pairwise

comparisons). Only somatic complaints showed a significant 
difference between groups, with higher scores for collision sports 
compared to non-contact sports (mean difference ± SE: 1.0 ± 0.5; 
p = 0.017), although the effect was non-significant after adjust-
ing for multiple comparisons at an FDR of 0.05. Cognitive and 
balance scores also showed no significant differences between 
groups (p ≥ 0.26, all pairwise comparisons). These results indicate 
a general absence of significant clinical differences between the 
sport groups in this study.
neuroimaging Data
Figure 1 plots PLS analysis results for the DTI measures of FA 
and MD. Figure 1A depicts voxel saliences for FA, where a set of 
white matter clusters showed significant positive bootstrap ratios, 
indicating reliable differences in FA values across groups (see 
Table 2 for cluster report). This included clusters in the splenium 
of the corpus callosum, fornix, internal and external capsules, and 
corona radiata. Figure 1B depicts the distribution of mean subject 
FA values averaged over significant brain regions, for each group. 
Athletes in collision sports had significantly higher FA than non-
contact and contact sports (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively, 
significant at FDR = 0.05), while non-contact and contact groups 
were not significantly different (p = 0.21). Figure 1C shows voxel 
saliences for MD, where a set of significant clusters also indicate 
reliable differences in MD across groups (see Table 3 for cluster 
report). Similar to FA, significant effects were seen in the corona 
radiata and internal capsule; however, distinct clusters were also 
seen in the cerebral peduncle, sagittal striatum, and hippocampus. 
Figure 1D plots the distribution of mean subject MD values, aver-
aged over all significant brain regions, for each sport group. The 
trend was the opposite of FA, where athletes in collision sports 
had significantly lower MD than non-contact and contact sports

map in Figure 2A, a set of brain regions were identified with sig-
nificant positive bootstrap ratios, indicating reliable differences 
in Gconn across groups (see Table 4 for cluster report). This 
included multiple regions implicated in visual processing and 
attention, including superior parietal lobe, precuneus, superior 
occipital lobe, calcarine sulcus, and fusiform gyrus. Significant 
regions were also implicated in motor coordination, including the 
supplementary motor area and cerebellum. In addition, the hip-
pocampus showed significant effects; this brain region is impli-
cated in non-verbal memory. Figure 2B depicts the distribution 
of mean subject Gconn values, averaged over significant brain 
regions, for each sport group. Gconn was highest for athletes in 
non-contact sports, intermediate for athletes in contact sports, 
and lowest for athletes in collision sports. However, only collision 
and non-contact sports were significantly different after correct-
ing for multiple comparisons (p < 0.001, significant at an FDR of 
0.05), whereas contact sport athletes could not be distinguished 
from either non-contact or collision sport athletes (p ≥ 0.13 for 
both comparisons).
Figure 3 plots PLS analysis results for brain metabolite ratios. 
In Figure 3A, saliences are plotted for all analyzed metabolite 
ratios, ordered by effect size. Only the NAA/Cr ratio showed sig-
nificant between-group differences after correcting for multiple 
comparisons at FDR = 0.05, although NAA/Cho and Ins/Cho 
ratios were significant at p < 0.05 before correction. Figure 3B 
plots subject NAA/Cr ratios per group, showing progressive 
effects, with the highest values for athletes in non-contact sports, 
intermediate values for athletes in contact sports, and lowest 
values for athletes in collisions sports. Only the difference in 
NAA/Cr values between athletes in non-contact and collision 
sports was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons 
(p < 0.001, significant at FDR = 0.05), while contact sport athletes 
could not be distinguished from either non-contact or collision 
sport athletes (p ≥ 0.35 for both).
Table 5 reports neuroimaging parameter values for athletes 
with and without a history of concussion, for each sport group. 
Combining all sport groups, FA within brain regions implicated 
in contact exposure showed significant effects of concussion his-
tory (mean increase: 0.0069, 95% CI: 0.0187, 0.0007; p = 0.029), 
whereas MD did not (mean decrease: −0.022 × 10−5, 95% CI: 
−1.697 × 10−5, 0.983 × 10−5; p = 0.47). Similarly, Gconn showed 
significant effects of concussion history (mean decrease: −0.021, 
95% CI: 0.004, 0.055; p = 0.034), while effects on the NAA/Cr 
ratio were non-significant (mean decrease: −0.037, 95% CI: 
−0.174, 0.029; p = 0.18). Supplemental analyses of FA and Gconn 
examined whether specific sport subgroups were more sensitive 
to the effects of prior concussions. For FA, none of the individual 
sport subgroups showed a significant association with concus-
sion history (p ≥ 0.11 for all), but for Gconn the non-contact 
group showed significant effects (median decrease: −0.042, 95% 
CI: 0.007, 0.104; p = 0.026), while other sport groups were non-
significant (p ≥ 0.059 for both).
DiscUssiOn
This article presents a detailed comparison of white matter 
microstructure, resting brain function and cerebral metabolites, 
for athletes in sports associated with different levels of contact 
exposure. By imaging athletes prior to the start of their respective 
sporting season, the analyses focused on persistent markers of 
contact sport participation, limiting potential confounds associ-
ated with recent concussive and subconcussive impacts. The MRI 
data were analyzed using PLS, as this flexible multivariate model is 
sensitive to spatially distributed effects of contact exposure on the 
brain. For each MRI modality (DTI, fMRI, and SVS), the analyses 
showed significant variations between non-contact, contact, and 
collision sport participants providing a neuroimaging basis for 
the sport classifications defined by Meehan and colleagues (18).

The DTI analyses showed elevated FA and reduced MD for 
the collision sport group, whereas the non-contact and contact 
sport groups were overlapped. Thus, white matter microstructure 
appears to be fundamentally distinct among athletes that are 
exposed to routine, purposeful body-to-body collisions; this is 
supported by a previous DTI study in which cumulative effects 
of contact exposure were seen within a single season (13). The 
effects of contact exposure on DTI parameters are also consist-
ent with the long-term effects of sport concussion, as increased 
FA and decreased MD have previously been reported (24–26), 
suggesting that both concussive and subconcussive impacts have 
similar effects on white matter microstructure. In this study, 
white matter regions where FA was related to contact exposure 
also showed significant effects of concussion history, whereas this 
was not observed for MD. This may be due to the concussion 
having more spatially sparse long-term effects on MD, as previ-
ously reported in Ref. (26). As the effects of contact exposure on 
FA and MD appear to be comparable in this study (i.e., the extent 
of significant brain regions and between-group differences), this 
suggests that MD may have more specificity for subconcussive 
contact exposure than FA. It is important to note that the trends 
in this study were opposite to those seen in more severe TBI 
(27–29), where decreased FA and increased MD are commonly 
reported markers of axonal injury. Thus, both concussion and 
participation in collision sports showed microstructural effects 
that appear to be distinct from the pathophysiology of more 
severe TBI. The cause of elevated FA and decreased MD in this 
cohort has not been definitively established, but may reflect adap-
tive growth processes in response to neural injury, e.g., axonal 
budding (30) or gliosis (31). Alternatively, these effects may be 
due to structural reorganization of white matter (32, 33), either 
to compensate for greater frequency of impacts, or in response to 
specific cognitive demands associated with collision sports. This 
is an important area of future research, where more advanced 
diffusion-weighted techniques may provide improved neurobio-
logical specificity (34, 35).
The fMRI analyses showed a more gradual decrease in Gconn 
with greater contact exposure, as the intermediate contact group 
was overlapped with both non-contact and collision groups. The 
brain regions where Gconn was associated with contact exposure 
also showed significant effects of concussion history. These 
effects are consistent with previous studies of subacute concus-
sion, where reduced connectivity has been observed (36, 37) and 
where a greater number of prior concussions was also associated 
with lower connectivity (36). In the present work, the observed 
connectivity changes were primarily seen in regions implicated in 
visual-motor function. The functioning of these brain regions is 
critical for sport performance, as well as avoiding injury during 
competition. Moreover, vulnerability of these domains to concus-
sive and subconcussive impacts is supported by clinical literature,

where visual-motor impairments are often observed follow-
ing a concussion (38–40). Both Abbas et al. (14) and Johnson 
et al. (16) have previously examined subconcussive effects on 
the DMN, showing complex changes in network connectivity, 
both positive and negative. Consistent with these studies, no 
significant between-group differences were seen in Gconn for 
elements of the DMN, including the posterior cingulate, middle 
temporal lobes, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (15), indicat-
ing the absence of a global shift in connectivity strength for this 
network (i.e., a uniform increase or decrease in connectivity). The 
decreased Gconn with greater contact exposure signifies reduced 
integrative brain function, which may stem from a combination 
of metabolic changes, altered cerebral blood flow, and injury to 
the neuroanatomical substrate (41, 42).
The analysis of cerebral metabolite ratios also showed consist-
ent differences between sport groups. The only significant ratio 
was NAA/Cr, which decreased in sports associated with greater 
contact exposure. A decline in NAA has been previously observed 
in TBI patients (43, 44) and concussed athletes and may persist 
from days to months postinjury (45, 46), although non-significant 
findings have also been reported (47). The current findings sug-
gest that the effect of participating in contact sports also exists 
along this spectrum. Although the specific function of NAA is 
disputed, it is thought to play a role in mitochondrial function 
and osmoregulation (48–50), and decreased NAA has been 
interpreted as a marker of neuronal loss (51) and/or reversible 
neurometabolic dysfunction (52). Cr is considered a stable refer-
ence peak for comparing metabolite ratios, due to the majority 
of Cr synthesis occurring external to the brain (53); therefore, 
the significant change of NAA relative to Cr is expected. The lack 
of significant group differences for Cho and Ins suggests that 
the primary effect of contact exposure is unlikely to be due to 
ongoing cellular degeneration or reactive gliosis, as Cho is usually 
implicated in cell membrane density, while Ins is implicated in 
glial cell proliferation (53). This further supports the decreases in 
NAA/Cr as an indicator of mainly neurometabolic dysfunction 
for athletes in contact and collision sports.
The present study describes a neurobiological “signature” of 
contact exposure in despite a lack of significant clinical impair-
ments, which underscores the functional resilience of the brain,

for active university-level athletes. Nonetheless, these results may 
provide a biological basis for the negative cognitive effects that 
have been reported with greater levels of contact exposure (9, 
10), which may be driven by altered tissue microstructure and 
reduced neurometabolic function. The present findings also 
suggest persistent but potentially reversible effects of contact 
exposure, as white matter does not exhibit the reduced FA and 
elevated MD typically associated with more severe injury (27–29). 
In addition, decreased functional connectivity was associated 
with reduced NAA/Cr, indicating that the decreased functional 
integration may be driven by reduced neurometabolic activity 
(52). The observed physiological effects are highest for athletes 
in sports with greater contact exposure and with a history of 
concussion. An important question for future research is whether 
these MRI markers can be used to detect an “exposure threshold” 
to contact participation for which the brain cannot adapt, which 
may explain the negative long-term health consequences seen in 
a minority of athletes.
Although this study reported multiple neuroimaging mark-
ers that are consistently associated with participation in contact 
and collision sports, enhancing confidence that the findings are 
reliable, there are some limitations that should be considered for 
future research. One limitation is that the current study combined 
multiple different sports into contact and collision categories. 
Exposure to collisions may vary by sport within these catego-
ries, a hypothesis that is supported by epidemiological studies 
showing differences in concussion incidence across sports (54). 
Similarly, the prevalence and types of subconcussive impact may 
depend on the player position, playing style, and level of play; for 
example, Crisco et al. found that among collegiate football play-
ers, the frequency, location, and magnitude of impact vary with 
position (7, 55). Further research is required to determine how 
these factors influence neuroimaging markers. In addition, while 
the present study controlled for recent concussions, athletes may 
participate in preseason or off-season sports, leading to exposure 
to repetitive head impacts, which may confound the present 
findings. Nonetheless, the present results are encouraging, given 
the robust effects seen for a heterogeneous sample of different 
sports. At present, it cannot be determined to what degree the 
present results are driven by repeated subconcussive injury or by 
a previously undiagnosed concussion (56, 57). Future research 
should examine contact participation prospectively across the 
three different sport groups, using objective measures such as 
impact sensors and video monitoring to quantify the relationship 
between severity and frequency of impacts and neuroimaging 
biomarkers. Finally, future research should also examine how 
advanced MRI measures relate to other objective biomarkers. 
For example (58), reported significant correlations between 
participation in collision sports and expression of inflammatory 
blood biomarkers in healthy athletes. Integration with non-
neuroimaging modalities will help to develop a more complete 
picture of the biological consequences of participating in contact 
and collision sports.
In summary, this study comprehensively examined neuro-
biological MRI markers in a group of healthy athletes sampled 
preseason. We identified robust effects on white matter micro-
structure, brain function, and neural metabolites in athletes who 
play sports with greater exposure to purposeful collisions. Our 
findings of MRI markers associated with contact exposure are 
qualitatively similar to the literature that has examined the meas-
ures in concussion, suggesting a continuum of changes even in 
the absence of diagnosed concussion, with greatest effects among 
athletes in collision sports. These findings provide important 
information about how MRI markers of brain health and concus-
sion vary across athlete cohorts, improving our ability to model 
accurately the long-term effects of brain injury and exposure to 
repetitive impacts in sport.
