Abstract
Background: Despite strong efficacy in randomized trials, the population effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids in long-term
smoking cessation is lacking, possibly because of confounding (factors that are associated with both pharmaceutical aid use
and difficulty quitting). Matching techniques in longitudinal studies can remove this confounding bias.
Methods: Using the nationally representative Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS), we
assessed the effectiveness of medications to aid quitting among baseline adult smokers who attempted to quit prior to one
year of follow-up in two longitudinal studies: 2002–2003 and 2010–2011. Pharmaceutical aid users and nonusers with com-
plete data (n ¼ 2129) were matched using propensity score models with 12 potential confounders (age, sex, race-ethnicity, ed-
ucation, smoking intensity, nicotine dependence, previous quit history, self-efficacy to quit, smoke-free homes, survey year,
and cessation aid use). Using matched data sets, logistic regression models were fit to assess whether use of any individual
pharmaceutical aid increased the proportion of patients who were abstinent for 30 days or more at follow-up.
Results: Propensity score matching markedly improved balance on the potential confounders between the pharmaceutical
aid use groups. Using matched samples to provide a balanced comparison, there was no evidence that use of varenicline
(adjusted risk difference [aRD] ¼ 0.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ –0.07 to 0.11), bupropion (aRD ¼ 0.02, 95% CI ¼ –0.04 to
0.09), or nicotine replacement (aRD ¼ 0.01, 95% CI ¼ –0.03 to 0.06) increased the probability of 30 days or more smoking
abstinence at one-year follow-up.
Conclusions: The lack of effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids in increasing long-term cessation in population samples is not
an artifact caused by confounded analyses. A possible explanation is that counseling and support interventions provided in
efficacy trials are rarely delivered in the general population.
With cigarette smoking causing substantial health consequen-
ces (1) and quitting smoking being so difficult for many smokers
(2), it is of considerable public health importance that effective
treatments are developed and disseminated to assist the large
number of current smokers attempting to quit. US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)–approved pharmaceutical cessation
aids started to become available in the early 1990s, many of
which doubled the cessation rate in efficacy randomized trials
(3). Since the year 2000, the US Clinical Practice Guidelines (4,5)
have suggested that all smokers trying to quit should be recom-
mended to use a pharmaceutical aid. Yet, despite substantial
marketing (6), no more than 30% of US smokers who quit used a

 pharmaceutical cessation aid in any given year (7). Some stud-
ies have suggested that the population effectiveness of these
aids did not match the results of the efficacy randomized trials
(7–10), and some smokers report concern about effectiveness as
a reason for not wanting to use available pharmaceuticals (11).
There is a considerable literature on why randomized trials
may
not
generalize
to
the
population
(12–14).
However,
population-based observational studies can also be biased, be-
cause the same individual factors making quitting difficult may
also be related to self-selected use of pharmaceutical aids when
trying to quit (15). For instance, heavier smokers are more likely
to use a cessation aid and also less likely to successfully quit.
Other potential confounders include sociodemographics (age,
sex, race-ethnicity, education), smoking characteristics (previ-
ous quitting, nicotine dependence), self-efficacy in quitting, and
having a smoke-free home (11). The use of regression adjust-
ment in population studies does not remove bias from noncom-
parable groups (nonexchangeability) on important potential
confounders (16,17).
To best estimate the impact of pharmaceutical aids on ces-
sation in the population and remove potential sources of bias to
ensure fair comparisons, we used two nationally representative
population cohort studies where variables related to either use
of pharmaceutical aids or poor cessation outcomes were mea-
sured prior to the quit attempt in question and used propensity
score matching (PSM). This method improves our ability to
make a balanced comparison of cessation success with and
without pharmaceutical aids (18,19).
Methods
Data Source
The US Current Population Survey (CPS), undertaken by the US
Census Bureau, includes a nationally representative civilian,
noninstitutionalized adult sample and provides monthly esti-
mates for a number of population characteristics (20). Tobacco
Use Supplements (TUS), coordinated by the National Cancer
Institute, have been added to these surveys at regular intervals
since 1992 (21). When supplements are run for the same month
on two separate years, there is an overlap sample, creating a co-
hort of respondents who provide surveys at two time points.
This was arranged in 2002–2003 and 2010–2011 for the TUS-CPS.
These two cohorts are the focus of our study. The initial base-
line CPS response rates were 92.9% for both February 2003 and
May 2010, the TUS-CPS supplement response rates were 83.7%
for the February 2002 survey and 82.2% for the May 2010 survey,
and follow-up response rates were 66.8% for the 2002–2003 co-
hort and 67.9% for the 2010–2011 cohort (22–25). As we focused
on detailed smoking behaviors at both baseline and follow-up,
we further restricted the sample to individuals who self-reported
their smoking behaviors at both baseline and follow-up (2002–
2003: n ¼ 15 846; 2010–2011: n ¼ 18 499), who were smokers at the
baseline survey (2002–2003: n ¼ 2801; 2010–2011: n ¼ 2787), and
who attempted to quit smoking for at least one day between the
baseline and follow-up surveys (2002–2003: n ¼ 1094; 2010–2011:
n ¼ 1071), resulting in a combined sample of 2161 individuals; af-
ter excluding observations with missing covariate data, the sam-
ple was reduced to 2129. The public use tape has no personal
identifiers, and the study was exempted from human subject
protections review at University of California, San Diego.
Cigarette Smoking Measures
The TUS-CPS uses the standard national tobacco questions,
including “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your en-
tire life?” to identify ever established smokers, followed by “Do
you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?”
to identify current and former smokers. Smoking intensity was
queried for all smokers, and we use both continuous data as
well as the following categories of fewer than 10, 10 to 19 and 20
or more cigarettes per day.
Cessation Behaviors at Follow-up
On the follow-up survey, current frequent smokers (�12 of last
30 days) were asked, “During the past 12 months, have you
stopped smoking for one day or longer because you were trying
to quit smoking?” Infrequent smokers (<12 of last 30 days) were
alternatively asked, “During the past 12 months, have you tried
to quit smoking completely?” Respondents who reported a quit
attempt but did not supply a length of quit were credited with a
one-day quit. Respondents who reported current smoking at
baseline but at follow-up said they now smoked “not at all” were
asked, “About how long has it been since you completely quit
smoking cigarettes?” We used 30 days or more of abstinence at
the follow-up survey as an early marker of successful cessation.
Use of Pharmaceutical Assistance During Most Recent
Quit Attempt
At follow-up, current and former smokers who reported a quit
attempt were asked about use of the following products on the
most recent attempt: “nicotine patch, nicotine gum or nicotine
lozenge, nicotine nasal spray or nicotine inhaler; a prescription
pill, called Chantix or varenicline; a prescription pill, called
Zyban, bupropion, or Wellbutrin; or another prescription pill.”
Chantix/varenicline was only commercially available for the
2010–2011 surveys.
Other Potential Confounders at Baseline
There were 12 potential confounders that we controlled for in
the matching analyses. These were: age, sex, race-ethnicity, ed-
ucation, smoking intensity, nicotine dependence, previous quit
history, a combination of interest in quitting and self-efficacy to
quit, smoke-free homes, survey year, and other cessation aid
use. The TUS-CPS uses standard national questions to query
sociodemographics. The respondent’s age was queried in indi-
vidual years, and we used a continuous variable in analyses;
however, for descriptive purposes, we used three groups (18–34
years, 35–54 years, 55 years and older). We used binary classifi-
cations for sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white or other),
and educational attainment (any college vs no college).
Previous quitting history was assessed with the questions
“Have you ever tried to quit smoking completely?” and “During
the past 12 months, have you stopped smoking for one day or
longer because you were trying to quit smoking?” Smoke-free
homes was assessed with “Which statement best describes the
rules about smoking inside your home?” A smoke-free home
was indicated by the response “No one is allowed to smoke any-
where inside your home.”
Two potential confounders were queried only on the 2010
baseline survey. Nicotine dependence was queried with “[On
the days that you smoke,] how soon after you wake up do you

 typically smoke your first cigarette of the day?” Responses of
less than 30 minutes were classified as more nicotine depen-
dent (26). The second variable was a combination of interest in
quitting and self-efficacy for quitting (27) and was queried with
two questions: 1) “Overall, on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is not
at all interested and 10 is extremely interested, how interested
are you in quitting smoking?” Those with a response greater
than 1 to this question were further queried with 2) “If you did
try to quit smoking altogether in the next six months, how
likely do you think you would be to succeed (not at all, a little
likely, somewhat likely, or very likely)?” From these questions
we categorized respondents into three broad groups, “not at all
interested in quitting,” “not at all/a little likely,” and “somewhat
likely/very likely” to succeed at quitting.
Statistical Analysis
Pharmaceutical aid usage and cigarette abstinence were de-
scribed using percentages according to sociodemographic and
smoking characteristics, with the statistical significance of dif-
ferences tested using the weighted v2 test. We then used PSM to
balance groups of respondents on use of pharmaceutical aids
with respect to potential confounders and the year of interview
as covariates, following reporting guidelines outlined by Yao
et al. (28). First, we fitted logistic models with the covariates
entered in the regression equation and the outcomes set as one
of the pharmaceutical aid variables. Likelihood ratio tests sug-
gested that quadratic specification of age or cigarettes per day
(vs
linear)
improved
the
fit
of
the
logistic
models
(Supplementary Tables 1–4, available online). Using the best-
fitting models, we estimated each respondent’s propensity to
use each of the pharmaceutical aids. Visual comparisons of ker-
nel density plots of the resulting propensity scores, as well as
the standardized mean differences of each covariate, were used
to
judge
whether
matching
improved
balance.
We
used
“nearest-neighbor” matching
(29),
without replacement,
to
match observations from the group of respondents who did not
use the pharmaceutical aid under study to respondents who
did. Matching two treated controls to one treatment provided
the greatest improvement in balance for bupropion and vareni-
cline (all standardized mean differences < j0.1j), and matching
one control to one treatment provided the greatest improvement
in balance for the “any” pharmaceutical aid variable and for
nicotine products (Supplementary Table 5, available online).
The
best-performing
nearest-neighbor
matching
algorithms
obtained comparable (nicotine products) or greater (any pharma-
ceutical aid, bupropion, varenicline) improvements in balance

 than “subclassification” PSM matching using n ¼ 6 propensity
score quantiles (Supplementary Table 6, available online).
The literature includes different recommendations for esti-
mating treatment effects. While some suggest that once data
are balanced, a difference of proportions test is sufficient for in-
ference (30), others recommend using the typical parametric
statistics on the balanced data set (19). As such, we used both
approaches. We report estimates using crude risk differences
(RDs), multivariable-adjusted risk differences (aRDs) on the full
data set, as well as RDs and aRDs on the matched data set. RDs
and aRDs, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), were calculated from logistic regression models and by us-
ing 1000 draws from the multivariable normal distribution with
the mean equal to the maximum likelihood point estimate and
the variance equal to the coefficient covariance matrix (31).
When using a multivariable regression, we set all covariate val-
ues to their respective sample mean values.
We also conducted sensitivity analysis to assess potential
confounding due to the questions that were specific to the
2010–2011 cohort. Missing values were handled using listwise
deletion, as all variables had 1.7% or less missing. All analyses
were performed using R version 3.4.1, all tests were two-sided,
and statistical significance was assessed at an a of .05.
Results
The majority of the sample was age 35 to 54 years (51.3%), fe-
male (58.1%), non-Hispanic white (82.1%), had not taken college

 courses (55.0%), did not have a smoke-free home (61.2%), usu-
ally smoked less than a pack of cigarettes a day (64.1%),
intended to quit smoking in the six months following the base-
line survey (57.0%), and had tried to quit smoking prior to the
baseline survey (82%) (Table 1). Study responses were equally
likely to come from either longitudinal study. Thirty-four per-
cent of respondents used a pharmaceutical aid during their
most recent quit attempt, and 18% were abstinent for 30þ days
or more at the time of their follow-up survey.
Use of a pharmaceutical aid during the most recent quit at-
tempt was more frequent among respondents who were older
than age 35 years (age 18–34 years: 25.2%; age 35–54 years:
37.1%; age 55þ years: 36.4%, P < .001), female (female: 36.0% vs
male: 31.2%, P ¼ .03), white (white: 36.9% vs nonwhite: 20.7%,
P < .001), and had completed at least some college (any college:
36.9% vs no college: 31.2%, P ¼ .01) (Table 1). Similarly, use of
pharmaceutical aids was higher among adults who smoked
more cigarettes at baseline (<10 CPD: 27.1%; 10–19 CPD: 33.3%;
20þ CPD: 41.2%, P < .001), intended to quit in the six months fol-
lowing their baseline survey (intent: 37.1% vs no intent: 29.9%,
P ¼ .001), and among those who had previously tried to quit
smoking prior to their baseline survey (previous quit: 36.1% vs
no quit: 24.3%, P < .001). The percentage of smokers using a
pharmaceutical aid did not change statistically between the two
longitudinal surveys (2002–2003: 34.8% vs 2010–2011: 33.2%, P ¼
.45), nor did it differ by presence of a smoke-free home (smoke-
free home: 33.0% vs no smoke-free home: 34.7%, P ¼ .45).
Respondents who were abstinent for 30 days or more at
follow-up were typically younger (age 18–34 years: 23.9%; age
35–54 years: 14.5%; age 55þ years: 18.6%, P < .001), had com-
pleted at least some college (any college: 21.5% vs no college:
14.9%, P < .001), had a smoke-free home (23.2% vs 14.5%, P <
.001), and smoked fewer cigarettes at their baseline survey (<10
CPD: 22.7%; 10–19 CPD: 17.0%; 20þ CPD: 14.0%, P < .001) (Table 1).
A larger proportion of the 2010–2011 cohort was abstinent for
30þ days at follow-up than the 2002–2003 cohort (2002–2003:
14.8% vs 2010–2011: 21.0%, P < .001).
The PSM procedures suggested an imbalance between those
who used pharmaceutical aids and those who did not with re-
spect to the potential confounders that we assessed (Figure 1).
Those who did not use pharmaceutical aids appear to have
lower propensity scores than those who did (left column), and
matching appears to improve this balance (right column). After
matching, all standardized mean differences were below j0.1j
for each covariate, indicating that good balance was achieved
by conventional statistical thresholds (Table 2).
In the logistic models estimating the association between use
of pharmaceutical aids and smoking cessation in the matched
data sets (Figure 2), there was no evidence that use of any phar-
maceutical aid to quit was associated with an increased probabil-
ity of 30 days or more smoking abstinence at one-year follow-up
(aRD ¼ 0.01, 95% CI¼ –0.03 to 0.05). A null association of pharma-
ceutical aid use and probability of 30 days or more smoking
abstinence at one-year follow-up was observed for varenicline
(aRD ¼ 0.01, 95% CI¼ –0.07 to 0.11), bupropion (aRD ¼ 0.02, 95%
CI¼ –0.04 to 0.09), and nicotine replacement (aRD ¼ 0.01, 95%
CI¼ –0.03 to 0.06). These null associations were independent of
our choice of model specifications, as the null association was
observed in the unadjusted models on the full data set, the mul-
tivariable models on the full data set, the unadjusted models in
the matched data set, and the multivariable models in the
matched data set (Figure 2). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis,
adjusting for additional baseline questions (nicotine dependence
and interest/self-efficacy for quitting), which were only available
for
the
2010–2011
cohort,
did
not
modify
these
results
(Supplementary Figure 1, available online).
Discussion
Our analysis of these two large population longitudinal surveys,
approximately 10 years apart, supports conclusions from previ-
ous cross-sectional analyses (7–10), that pharmaceutical aids
for smoking cessation, despite strong evidence for efficacy from
randomized
trials,
have
not
been
effective

 successful quitting in the United States. Our analysis is a meth-
odological advance on previously published work as we use pro-
pensity
score
matching
to
adjust
for
factors
that
could
potentially confound estimates of the association between use
of pharmaceutical aids and smoking cessation in observational
data.
The consistency of the null effect size between our matched
and unmatched analysis suggests that this lack of effectiveness
does not appear to come from differential use patterns of phar-
maceutical aids between subpopulations. One alternative expla-
nation is that exclusion criteria in efficacy trials would remove
half of the real-world smokers, thus seriously limiting general-
izability (32). Another alternative is that the explanation
comes from the way that pharmaceutical aids are made avail-
able in the general population. For instance, in two recent,
well-designed efficacy trials, large numbers of participants
were
randomly
assigned
to
multiple
interventions
that
included both pharmaceutical and behavioral components.
In the Eagles trial (33), in addition to receiving a pharmaceuti-
cal aid, each participant completed up to 15 face-to-face visits
and 11 telephone visits during the 24-week trial. Best-practice
smoking cessation (34) counseling (10 minute sessions) was
given at each clinic visit. In a different open label study, Baker
et al. (35) investigated cessation treatments that could “be dis-
seminated broadly via healthcare systems.” However, each
treatment group, in addition to a pharmaceutical aid, received
five in-person counseling sessions (20 minutes) and one
phone call (10 minutes). The counseling interventions in-
cluded in the above trials do not appear less intensive than
those used on the majority of quitlines that include proactive
calls after the initial contact. These have been assessed as ef-
fective in promoting successful quitting (36), and a recent trial
has confirmed the effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids plus
counseling
in
promoting
successful
quitting
in
Medi-Cal
smokers (37). While free quitline programs are in every state
within the United States, commonly only 1% to 2% of smokers
report using them (38).
A strength of this study is the use of two similar, nationally
representative longitudinal cohorts with 12-month follow-up
undertaken about a decade apart. One limitation that could in-
fluence our results is the nonresponse to the follow-up survey.
Also, while the findings are generally consistent with evidence
that the proportion of ever smokers who have quit did not in-
crease substantially from 2002 to 2011 (1), reliance on recall
meant that the study probably underestimated the actual pro-
portion
of
smokers
who
made
a
quit
attempt
(39,40).
Additionally, while we expect that supplementing use of phar-
maceutical aids with behavioral support would improve their
effectiveness, we could not assess this hypothesis using TUS-
CPS, as use of counseling was rare among pharmaceutical aid
users. For instance, in our sample only 32 out of 186 buproprion
users and nine out of 118 varenicline users used any form of be-
havioral counseling. Similarly, we could not assess duration of
use of the pharmaceutical aids.
Nonetheless, this study strongly suggests that the lack of
effectiveness of pharmaceutical aids in increasing long-term
cessation in population samples is not an artifact caused by
confounded analyses. There is a considerable literature of the
efficacy of pharmaceutical smoking cessation aids; however,
in these studies, the intervention is usually paired with smok-
ing cessation counseling, which has been shown to be an ef-
fective intervention in itself. Thus, these results suggest a
need for reconsidering how cessation assistance is provided at
the population level, as the simple provision of pharmaceuti-
cal aids to smokers does not appear to be an effective way to
increase the proportion who successfully quit for the long
term.

nent from smoking for at least 30 days between adults who used or did not use
pharmaceutical aids, among adults who made quit attempts in the Tobacco Use
Supplement to the Current Population Survey, United States, 2002–2003 and
2010–2011. The dots and lines represent means and 95% confidence intervals for
the risk difference. The first two models estimating risk differences in each box
are logistic regression models fit to the full unbalanced data set, and the next two
models are logistic regression models fit to the data sets that were balanced using
matching. The crude models include only the use of medication, while the multi-
variable models include the use of medication and a number of treated controls.
Nearest-neighbor matching was used to balance samples for every medication
assessed. A 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching ratio was used for matching the any
pharmaceutical aid and nicotine groups, and a 2:1 nearest-neighbor matching
ratio was used for matching the bupropion and varenicline groups.
