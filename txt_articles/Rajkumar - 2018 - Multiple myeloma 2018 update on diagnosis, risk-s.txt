Abstract
Multiple myeloma accounts for approximately 10% of hematologic malignancies. The diagnosis
requires �10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells or a biopsy proven plasmacytoma plus evidence
of one or more multiple myeloma defining events: CRAB (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, or
lytic bone lesions) features felt related to the plasma cell disorder, bone marrow clonal plasmacyto-
sis �60%, serum involved/uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio �100 (provided involved FLC is
�100 mg/L), or >1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with del(17p), t(14;16),
and t(14;20) have high-risk multiple myeloma. Patients with t(4;14) translocation and gain(1q) have
intermediate-risk. All others are considered standard-risk. Initial treatment consists of bortezomib,
lenalidomide, dexamethasone (VRd). In high-risk patients, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone
(KRd) is an alternative to VRd. In eligible patients, initial therapy is given for approximately 3-4
cycles followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Standard risk patients can opt for
delayed ASCT at first relapse. Patients not candidates for transplant are treated with VRd for
approximately 8-12 cycles followed by lenalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. After
ASCT, lenalidomide maintenance is recommended for standard risk patients, while maintenance
with a bortezomib-based regimen is needed for patients with intermediate or high-risk disease.
Most patients require a triplet regimen at relapse, with the choice of regimen varying with each
successive relapse. Aggressive relapse with extramedullary plasmacytomas or plasma cell leukemia
may require anthracycline containing combination chemotherapy regimens.

| DISEASE OVERVIEW
Multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all cancers and approximately
10% of all hematologic malignancies.1 Each year over 30 000 new
cases are diagnosed in the United States, and over 12 000 patients
die of the disease.2 The annual age-adjusted incidence in the United
States has remained stable for decades at approximately 4 per
100 000.3 Multiple myeloma is slightly more common in men than in
women, and is twice as common in African-Americans compared
with Caucasians.4 The median age of patients at the time of diagno-
sis is about 65 years.5
Unlike other malignancies that metastasize to bone, the osteolytic
bone lesions in multiple myeloma exhibit no new bone formation.6
Bone disease is the main cause of morbidity and can be detected on
routine skeletal radiographs, low-dose whole body computed tomogra-
phy
(WB-CT),
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI),
or
fluoro-
deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomographic
scans (PET/CT).7,8 Other major clinical manifestations are anemia,
hypercalcemia, renal failure, and an increased risk of infections. Approx-
imately, 1% to 2% of patients have extramedullary disease (EMD) at
the time of initial diagnosis, while 8% develop EMD later on in the dis-
ease course.9
Almost all patients with multiple myeloma evolve from an
asymptomatic premalignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance (MGUS).10,11 MGUS is present in over
3% of the population above the age of 50,12,13 and the prevalence is
approximately 2-fold higher in blacks compared with whites.14,15
MGUS progresses to multiple myeloma or related malignancy a rate
of 1% per year.16,17 Since MGUS is asymptomatic, over 50% of indi-
viduals who are diagnosed with MGUS have had the condition for
over 10 years prior to the clinical diagnosis.18 In some patients, an
intermediate asymptomatic but more advanced premalignant stage
referred to as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) can be recog-
nized clinically.19 SMM progresses to multiple myeloma at a rate of

sis, 3% per year over the next 5 years, and 1.5% per year thereafter.
This rate of progression is influenced by the underlying cytogenetic
type of disease; patients with t(4;14) translocation, del(17p), and gain
(1q) are at a higher risk of progression from MGUS or SMM to multi-
ple myeloma.20–22

| DIAGNOSIS
The revised International Myeloma Working Group criteria for the
diagnosis of multiple myeloma and related disorders are shown on
Table 1.1 The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires the presence
of one or more myeloma defining events (MDE) in addition to evi-
dence of either 10% or more clonal plasma cells on bone marrow
examination or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma. MDE consists of
established CRAB (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, or lytic bone
lesions) features as well as 3 specific biomarkers: clonal bone mar-
row plasma cells �60%, serum free light chain (FLC) ratio �100
(provided involved FLC level is �100 mg/L), and more than one
focal lesion on MRI. Each of the new biomarkers is associated with
an approximately 80% risk of progression to symptomatic end-organ
damage in two or more independent studies. The updated criteria
represent a paradigm shift since they allow early diagnosis and ini-
tiation of therapy before end-organ damage.
When multiple myeloma is suspected clinically, patients should be
tested for the presence of M proteins using a combination of tests that
should include a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum immuno-
fixation, and the serum FLC assay.23 Approximately, 2% of patients
with multiple myeloma have true nonsecretory disease and have no
evidence of an M protein on any of the above studies.5,24 Bone mar-
row studies at the time of initial diagnosis should include fluorescent in
situ hybridization (FISH) probes designed to detect t(11;14), t(4;14), t
(14;16), t(6;14), t(14;20), trisomies, and del(17p) (see Risk-Stratification
below).25 Conventional karyotyping to detect hypodiploidy and dele-
tion 13 has value, but if FISH studies are done, additional value in initial
risk-stratification is limited. Gene expression profiling if available can
provide additional prognostic value.26 Serum CrossLaps to measure
carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) may be useful in assessing
bone turnover and to determine adequacy of bisphosphonate ther-
apy.27,28 The extent of bone disease is best assessed by low-dose WB-
CT or PET/CT imaging.8 MRI scans are useful in patients with sus-
pected SMM to rule out focal bone marrow lesions that can be seen
before true osteolytic disease occurs. MRI imaging is also useful in
assessing EMD, suspected cord compression, or when detailed imaging
of a specific symptomatic area is needed. Conventional skeletal survey
is less sensitive than low-dose WB-CT and PET/CT and recommended
only if resources for more advanced imaging are not available.
The M protein is considered to be measurable if it is �1 g/dL in
the serum and or �200 mg/day in the urine. The M protein level is
monitored by SPEP and serum FLC assay to assess treatment response
every month while on therapy, and every 3–4 months when off-
therapy. The serum FLC assay is particularly useful in patients who lack
a measurable M protein, provided the FLC ratio is abnormal and the
involved FLC level is �100 mg/L.29 Urine protein electrophoresis is
recommended at least once every 3–6 months, to follow the urine M
protein level as well as to detect other renal complications that may
result in albuminuria. Response to therapy assessment and minimal
residual disease (MRD) evaluation is based on the revised International
Myeloma Working Group uniform response criteria.30

| MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION
Although multiple myeloma is still considered a single disease, it is in
reality a collection of several different cytogenetically distinct plasma
cell malignancies (Table 2).31,32 On FISH studies of the bone marrow,
approximately 40% of multiple myeloma is characterized by the pres-
ence of trisomies in the neoplastic plasma cells (trisomic multiple
myeloma), while most of the rest have a translocation involving the
immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus on chromosome 14q32 (IgH
translocated multiple myeloma).33–36 A small proportion of patients
have both trisomies and IgH translocations. Trisomies and IgH translo-
cations are considered primary cytogenetic abnormalities and occur at
the time of establishment of MGUS. In addition, other cytogenetic
changes termed secondary cytogenetic abnormalities arise along the
disease course of multiple myeloma, including gain(1q), del(1p), del
(17p), del(13), RAS mutations, and secondary translocations involving
MYC. Both primary and secondary cytogenetic abnormalities can influ-
ence disease course, response to therapy, and prognosis. Importantly,
the interpretation and impact of cytogenetic abnormalities in multiple
myeloma vary depending on the disease phase in which they are
detected (Table 3).37

| PROGNOSIS AND RISK
STRATIFICATION
Survival estimates in multiple myeloma vary based on the source of the
data. Data from randomized controlled trials using modern therapy
show that the median survival in multiple myeloma is approximately 6
years.38 In the subset of patients eligible for ASCT, 4-year survival rates
are more than 80%39; the median overall survival (OS) among these
patients is approximately 8 years.40 Among elderly patients (age >75
years), median OS is lower, and is approximately 5 years.38 These num-
bers likely underestimate current survival probabilities since they pre-
date the arrival of monoclonal antibodies and several other new agents
that have been introduced in the last 3 to 5 years. Conversely, they
may be overestimates of the true population-based survival since they
are derived from randomized controlled trials where patients with poor
performance status and comorbidities are typically excluded. Neverthe-
less, these estimates are valuable benchmarks, and appear generalizable
to newly diagnosed myeloma patients in good performance status.41
More precise estimation of prognosis requires an assessment of
multiple factors. As in other cancers, OS in multiple myeloma is
affected by host characteristics, tumor burden (stage), biology (cytoge-
netic abnormalities), and response to therapy.42,43 Tumor burden in
multiple myeloma has traditionally been assessed using the Durie-
Salmon Staging44 and the International staging system (ISS).45,46 Dis-
ease biology best reflected based on the molecular subtype of multiple
myeloma (Table 2), the presence or absence of secondary cytogenetic
abnormalities such as del(17p), gain(1q), or del(1p).25,32 In addition to
cytogenetic risk factors, two other markers that are associated with
aggressive disease biology are elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase
and evidence of circulating plasma cells on routine peripheral smear
examination (plasma cell leukemia). The Revised International Staging
System (RISS) combines elements of tumor burden (ISS) and disease
biology (presence of high risk cytogenetic abnormalities or elevated lac-
tate dehydrogenase level) to create a unified prognostic index that and
helps in clinical care as well as in comparison of clinical trial data (Table
4).47 To ensure uniform availability, only 3 widely available cytogenetic
markers are used in the RISS; the Mayo Clinic mSMART risk stratifica-
tion (www.msmart.org) (Table 5) has additional detail that is valuable in
formulating a therapeutic strategy.48
Treated appropriately, the survival of patients with certain high
risk categories can approach that of patients with standard risk disease.
In a large trial using bortezomib-based induction, early tandem ASCT,
and bortezomib maintenance, the median OS of patients with del(17p)
was approximately 8 years (8-year survival rate of 52%), and was iden-
tical to patients with standard risk multiple myeloma. In contrast, sur-
vival was lower for patients with t(4;14) translocation (8-year survival
rate, 33%) and for patients with gain(1q) abnormality (8-year survival
rate, 36%). These findings underscore the limitations of current risk
stratification models in the context of modern therapy and highlight
the need to stratify multiple myeloma based on individual cytogenetic
groups rather than arbitrary heterogeneous risk categories.31

outlined in Table 1. In earlier trials, treatment of asymptomatic patients
with SMM was associated with a benefit in progression free survival

 (PFS) but not OS.49 However, a recent randomized trial found that
early therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with
high risk SMM can prolong PFS and OS.50 Although these results need
further confirmation, they indicate the potential benefit of early inter-
vention in selected asymptomatic patients.

| TREATMENT OF NEWLY DIAGNOSED
MYELOMA
Survival in multiple myeloma has improved significantly in the last 15
years.51 The initial impact came from the introduction of thalido-
mide,52 bortezomib,53 and lenalidomide.54,55 In the last 5 years, car-
filzomib, pomalidomide, panobinostat, ixazomib, elotuzumab, and
daratumumab have been approved by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma, and
promise to improve outcomes further. Numerous combinations have
been developed using drugs that have shown activity in multiple
myeloma, and the most commonly used regimens are listed in Table
6.56–75 These drugs work through a variety of mechanisms, some of
which are not fully understood. Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and
pomalidomide are termed immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs). IMiDs
bind to cereblon and activate cereblon E3 ligase activity, resulting in
the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of two specific B cell
transcription factors, Ikaros family zinc finger proteins Ikaros (IKZF 1)
and Aiolos (IKZF3).76–78 They may cause direct cytotoxicity by induc-
ing free radical mediated DNA damage.79 They also have anti-
angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and tumor necrosis factor alpha
inhibitory properties. Bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib are pro-
teasome inhibitors.80–82 Elotuzumab and daratumumab are monoclo-
nal antibodies targeting SLAMF7 and CD38 respectively.73,83,84
Panobinostat is a deacetylase inhibitor.75,85
The approach to treatment of symptomatic newly diagnosed multi-
ple myeloma is outlined in Figure 1 and is dictated by eligibility for
ASCT and risk-stratification. The data to support their use from recent
randomized trials using new active agents for multiple myeloma are
provided in Table 7.38,39,60,86–88 There is an ongoing “cure versus con-
trol” debate on whether we should treat multiple myeloma with an
aggressive multi-drug strategy targeting complete response (CR) or a
sequential disease control approach that emphasizes quality of life as
well as OS.89,90
Recent data show that MRD negative status (as estimated by
next generation molecular methods or flow cytometry) has favor-
able prognostic value.30 However, additional trials are needed to
determine if changes in treatment need to be made based on MRD
status. At present, MRD results are recommended mainly as a prog-
nostic metric and not for used in making treatment decisions. We

 also need additional data to determine if MRD negativity can be
used as a surrogate endpoint for regulatory approval, and if sus-
tained MRD negativity may be a marker of cure in at least a subset
of patients.91
6.1 | Initial treatment in patients eligible for ASCT
Typically, patients are treated with approximately 3–4 cycles of induc-
tion therapy prior to stem cell harvest. After harvest, patients can
either undergo frontline ASCT or resume induction therapy delaying
ASCT until first relapse. There are many options for initial therapy, and
the most common treatment regimens are discussed below. These regi-
mens can also be used at the time of relapse. In general, the low-dose
dexamethasone regimen (40 mg once a week) is preferred in all regi-
mens to minimize toxicity. In a randomized trial conducted by the
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the low-dose dexameth-
asone approach was associated with superior OS and significantly
lower toxicity.58
6.1.1 | Bortezomib-containing regimens
Bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (VRd) is the current standard
of care for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. In a recent randomized
trial conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), response
rates, PFS, and OS were significantly superior with VRd compared with
Rd (Table 7).38 If lenalidomide is not available for use as initial therapy or
in the presence of acute renal failure, other bortezomib-containing regi-
mens
such
as
bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone
(VTd)
or
bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (VCd) can be used instead
of VRd. A recent randomized trial found that VTd results in superior
response rates compared with VCd, but impact on long-term outcomes is
not known.88 Therefore both are reasonable alternatives to VRd.
In initial studies, peripheral neuropathy was a major concern with
bortezomib therapy. Neuropathy with bortezomib can occur abruptly,
and can be significantly painful and debilitating. However, the neuro-
toxicity of bortezomib can be greatly diminished by administering bor-
tezomib
once
a
week
instead
of
twice-weekly,61,62
and
by
administering the drug subcutaneously instead of the intravenous
route.92 The once-weekly subcutaneous bortezomib schedule (Table 6)
has made serious neuropathy an uncommon problem, and has made
regimens such as VRd, VCd, and VTd much more tolerable. Bortezomib
does not appear to have any adverse effect on stem cell mobilization.93
6.1.2 | Lenalidomide-low dose dexamethasone (Rd)
Rd which combines lenalidomide with a lower dose of dexamethasone
(40 mg once weekly) is an active regimen in newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma, and has less toxicity and better OS than lenalidomide plus
high dose dexamethasone or MPT.58,87 Currently Rd is recommended
mainly for patients who are unable to tolerate a triplet regimen due to
advanced age, poor performance status, or comorbidities. Stem cell col-
lection with granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone may be
impaired when Rd is used as induction therapy.94 Thus, patients over
the age of 65 and those who have received more than 4 cycles of Rd
stem cells must be mobilized with either cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF
or with plerixafor.95,96 All patients treated with Rd require anti-
thrombosis prophylaxis. Aspirin is adequate for most patients, but in
patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis, either low-molecular
weight heparin or warfarin is needed.97–99
6.1.3 | Carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd)
Two phase II trials have reported excellent results with the newly
approved proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib when used in combination
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.100,101 However, more data on safety and efficacy of KRd
are needed before this regimen can be recommended in newly diag-
nosed multiple myeloma, except in young patients with high risk
cytogenetics. A randomized trial in the United States (referred to as
the Endurance trial) is currently ongoing comparing VRd versus KRd
as initial therapy.

 multiple myeloma, but there are no clear data from randomized con-
trolled trials that they have an effect on long-term endpoints compared
with the regimens discussed earlier.
Recommendations
� In standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients eligible for ASCT, I
favor VRd as initial therapy for 3–4 cycles, followed by ASCT and
lenalidomide maintenance therapy. In patients who are tolerating
therapy and responding well, an alternative is VRd for 8 to 12 cycles
followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy; in such patients
stem cells must be collected for cryopreservation after the first 3–4
cycles of VRd, and ASCT must be considered at first relapse.
� In high-risk patients, I favor KRd as initial therapy for 3–4 cycles fol-
lowed by ASCT and then maintenance with a proteasome inhibitor-
based regimen.
� In patients presenting with acute renal failure suspected to be sec-
ondary to light-chain cast nephropathy, I prefer VCd or VTd as initial
therapy in conjunction with plasma exchange (or dialysis with high-
cut-off filter). Plasma exchange is continued daily until the serum
FLC levels are less than 50 mg/dL and then repeated as needed till
chemotherapy is fully effective.
� In patients presenting with plasma cell leukemia or multiple extrame-
dullary plasmacytomas, I prefer VDT-PACE as initial therapy fol-
lowed by ASCT and then maintenance with a bortezomib-based
regimen.
� Once weekly subcutaneous bortezomib is preferred in most patients
for initial therapy, unless there is felt to be an urgent need for rapid
disease control.
� Dexamethasone 40 mg once a week (low-dose dexamethasone) is
preferred in most patients for initial therapy, unless there is felt to
be an urgent need for rapid disease control.
6.2 | Initial treatment in patients not eligible for ASCT
In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not
candidates for ASCT due to age or other comorbidities, the major
options for initial therapy are the same as those discussed earlier
for patients eligible for ASCT. Typically treatment is given with a
bortezomib-based regimen for approximately 8–12 cycles followed
by maintenance. Although melphalan-based regimens have been
extensively tested in these patients, they are not recommended due
to concerns about stem cell damage and secondary myelodysplastic
syndrome and leukemia. In the United States transplant eligibility is
not determined by a strict age cut-off, and many patients enrolled
in the melphalan-based clinical trials would be considered candidates
for ASCT.
6.2.1 | Bortezomib-based regimens
VRd has shown a survival benefit compared with Rd, and is the pre-
ferred choice for initial therapy in patients who are not candidates for
ASCT (Table 7).38 VRd is administered for approximately 8–12 cycles,

 followed by maintenance therapy. Alternatives to VRd include VCd and
VTd as discussed earlier. In patients in whom initial therapy with VRd is
not possible mainly for logistical reasons (such as problems with com-
pliance due to need for parenteral administration), ixazomib can be
considered in place of bortezomib.
6.2.2 | Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd)
Rd is an option for the treatment of elderly patients with newly diag-
nosed multiple myeloma who are unable to tolerate triplet therapy
due to advanced age, poor performance status, or co-morbidities. An
international phase III trial compared MPT versus Rd for 18 cycles
versus Rd until progression in 1623 patients.87 PFS was superior
with Rd until progression compared with the other two arms; OS
was superior with Rd until progression compared with MPT. This trial
provided the first evidence that OS can be improved in patients who
are not eligible for transplant using a regimen that does not contain
melphalan.
6.2.3 | Melphalan-based regimens
VMP is a bortezomib-based regimen that has shown better OS com-
pared with MP.60,86 Substituting melphalan with thalidomide in the
VMP regimen has not shown a benefit.61 Melphalan-based regimens
are considered only if there is problems with access to lenalidomide.
Even in these situations, the risks of melphalan can be reduced by using
cyclophosphamide instead, and studies show this substitution does not
alter efficacy.104 Thus, the VCd regimen can be considered as a minor
modification of the VMP regimen, in which cyclophosphamide is used
as the alkylating agent in place of melphalan. This variation has the
advantage of not affecting stem cell mobilization, and dosing is more
predictable. Randomized trials have found superior PFS and OS with 4-
drug regimens such as daratumumab-VMP and VMPT compared with
VMP, but the contribution of the fourth drug to the induction compo-
nent cannot be ascertained from these trials and more data on overall
survival are needed.62
Recommendations
� In standard-risk patients, I prefer VRd as initial therapy administered
for
approximately
8–12
cycles,
followed
by
lenalidomide
maintenance
� In frail elderly patients, I prefer Rd as initial therapy, administered
until progression. Dexamethasone may be started at 20 mg once a
week, then reduced as much as possible after the first 4–6 cycles,
and possibly discontinued after the first year.
� In intermediate- and high-risk patients, I favor VRd as initial therapy
for approximately 8–12 cycles followed if possible by a lower intensity
(one dose every two weeks) maintenance schedule of bortezomib.
6.3 | Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
6.3.1 | Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
ASCT improves median OS in multiple myeloma by approximately 12
months.105–108 However, randomized trials found similar OS with early
ASCT (immediately following 4 cycles of induction therapy) versus
delayed ASCT (at the time of relapse as salvage therapy).109–111 A
recent trial by the Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome (IFM) com-
pared early versus delayed ASCT in patients treated with VRd followed
by lenalidomide maintenance.39 Patients were randomized to receive
either VRd (3 cycles) followed by ASCT and then VRd consolidation (2
cycles) versus VRd 3 8 cycles with ASCT reserved for relapse. Both
arms received lenalidomide maintenance for one year. A significant
improvement in PFS was seen as expected with early ASCT, but this
has so far not translated into a difference in OS (Table 7). Based on
these results, it is reasonable to consider a delayed ASCT in patients
with standard-risk multiple myeloma who prefer such an approach for
personal and logistic reasons.
The role of tandem (double) ASCT is unclear. In earlier random-
ized trials, an improvement in OS was seen in two studies,112,113
but other studies failed to show such an improvement.114,115 More
recent data are available from two other randomized trials are also
inconclusive. In a trial conducted in Europe, an improvement in PFS
and OS was seen with tandem ASCT in both standard and high risk
patients.116 However, no survival benefit was seen in a randomized
trial conducted in the United States by the Bone Marrow Trans-
plantation Clinical Trials Network (BMT-CTN) in standard or high
risk multiple myeloma (BMT-CTN 0702 trial).117 The US trial more
likely reflects the impact of tandem ASCT in the context of modern
therapy when most new options for salvage are available. Thus rou-
tine tandem ASCT is not recommended outside of a clinical trial
setting except in selected young patients with high risk multiple
myeloma.
6.3.2 | Post-transplant consolidation
Consolidation therapy is a term used for the administration of a short
course of therapy, usually with 2 or more drugs, prior to the start of
long-term maintenance. The BMT-CTN 0702 trial had an arm that
investigated the benefit of post-transplant consolidation therapy fol-
lowed by lenalidomide maintenance versus lenalidomide maintenance
alone. In this trial, additional cycles of VRd chemotherapy administered
as consolidation after ASCT did not result in significant benefit. Unlike
earlier trials, the BMT-CTN 0702 trial specifically isolated the effect of
consolidation and is therefore more compelling than trials where one
could not ascertain the precise added value of consolidation therapy
on PFS and OS. Consolidation therapy after ASCT is not recommended
and patients should proceed to standard low-intensity maintenance
therapy.
6.3.3 | Allogeneic transplantation
The role of allogeneic and nonmyeloablative-allogeneic transplantation
in multiple myeloma is controversial with studies showing conflicting
results.118,119 The treatment related mortality (TRM) rate (10%-20%)
and GVHD rates are fairly high.120 Although allogenic transplantation
should still be considered as investigational, it may be a consideration
for young patients with high-risk disease who are willing to accept a
high TRM and the unproven nature of this therapy for a chance at bet-
ter long-term survival.

 Recommendations
� ASCT should be considered in all eligible patients. But in standard-
risk patients responding well to therapy, ASCT can be delayed until
first relapse provided stem cells are harvested early in the disease
course.
� Tandem ASCT is not recommended outside of clinical trials except in
selected young patients with high risk multiple myeloma.
� At present, allogeneic transplantation as frontline therapy should
largely be considered investigational.
6.4 | Maintenance therapy
Maintenance therapy is indicated following ASCT. Maintenance ther-
apy should also be considered in following completion of 8–12 cycles
of initial therapy in patients treated without ASCT. Lenalidomide is the
standard of care for maintenance therapy for most patients.87,121–125
In a meta-analysis of randomized trials, a significant improvement in
PFS and OS was seen with lenalidomide maintenance compared with
placebo or no therapy.126 Lenalidomide maintenance is associated with
a 2–3-fold increase in the risk of second cancers and patients must be
counseled in this regard and monitored.
The impact of lenalidomide maintenance in patients with interme-
diate- and high risk multiple myeloma is unclear. In the meta-analysis,
no significant OS benefit was seen in these subsets of high risk
patients.126 In contrast, bortezomib administered every other week has
been shown to improve OS, particularly in patients with del(17p).124
Bortezomib-based maintenance may thus be preferable for intermedi-
ate- and high-risk patients.
The benefit of maintenance therapy in patients who did not
undergo upfront ASCT is less clear. Based on the results of the
SWOG trial, maintenance therapy with lenalidomide or Rd should be
considered in patients who are in good performance status after
completion of initial 8–12 cycles of triplet therapy. Patients who are
treated with double therapy with Rd due to frailty or performance
status are usually treated with this regimen until disease progression.
After the first 18 cycles, the dose of dexamethasone can be lowered
to minimize side effects. In some patients dexamethasone may need
to be discontinued.
Although the benefit of maintenance is now established, data on
optimal duration are lacking. We also need to consider the cost, toxic-
ity, and inconvenience of long-term indefinite maintenance therapy.
Many patients seek a drug-free interval. An ECOG trial is comparing
lenalidomide maintenance given until progression versus a limited dura-
tion of 2 years. Trials are also examining if the duration of maintenance
can be modified based on MRD results.
Recommendations
� I recommend lenalidomide maintenance for standard-risk patients
following ASCT. I also recommend lenalidomide or Rd maintenance
following 8–12 cycles of initial therapy among patients who did not
receive ASCT as part of initial therapy.
� I recommend maintenance with bortezomib (or an alternative pro-
teasome inhibitor) for patients with intermediate- and high-risk mul-
tiple myeloma

| TREATMENT OF RELAPSED MULTIPLE
MYELOMA
Almost all patients with multiple myeloma eventually relapse. The
remission duration in relapsed multiple myeloma decreases with each
regimen.127 The median PFS and OS in patients with relapsed multiple
myeloma refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib is poor, with
median times of 5 months and 9 months, respectively.128 The choice of
a treatment regimen at relapse is complicated and is affected by many
factors including the timing of the relapse, response to prior therapy,
aggressiveness of the relapse, and performance status (TRAP). Patients
are eligible for an ASCT should be considered for the procedure if they
have never had one before, or if they have had an excellent remission
duration with the first ASCT defined as a remission of at least 36
months or longer with maintenance. In terms of drug therapy, a triplet
regimen containing at least two new drugs that the patient is not
refractory to should be considered. An approach to the treatment of
relapsed multiple myeloma is given in Figure 2. Major regimens used in
the treatment of multiple myeloma, including relapsed disease are listed
in Table 6. Recent advances in the treatment of relapsed multiple
myeloma, including new active agents and results of major randomized
trials are discussed below (Table 8).68,70,71,73–75,130–134 One important
consideration is that the lenalidomide-containing regimens listed in
Table 8 were tested mainly in patient populations who were not previ-
ously exposed to lenalidomide. In contrast, current clinical practice typi-
cally consists of patients who have been treated with lenalidomide and
are often relapsing while on a lenalidomide-containing regimen. In
patients who are considered refractory to lenalidomide, one option is
to consider pomalidomide-based regimens.

bortezomib-based triplet is reasonable and also carries lower cost and
risk. As in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, VRd, VCd, and VTd are
active regimens in relapsed disease.136,137
7.2 | Daratumumab
Daratumumab targeting CD38 has shown promise in relapsed, refrac-
tory multiple myeloma.83 In a phase II trial, daratumumab as a single-
agent was produced a response rate of approximately 30% in heavily
pretreated patients.84 Based on these findings, daratumumab was first
granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2015 for the treatment of
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior
lines

 immunomodulatory agent, or who are double-refractory to a protea-
some inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Subsequently 3 other
daratumumab-based combinations have shown efficacy and have been
approved by the FDA. These include daratumumab, lenalidomide, dexa-
methasone (DRd), daratumumab, bortezomib, dexamethasone (DVd),
and daratumumab, pomalidomide, dexamethasone (DPd) (Table 8). The
various triplets available for use in relapsed disease have not been com-
pared head-to-head, but daratumumab-based regimens appear to have
the greatest reduction in risk of progression, and may be preferred for
first relapse subject to availability and cost considerations.138
7.3 | Carfilzomib
Carfilzomib is a novel keto-epoxide tetrapeptide proteasome inhibitor ini-
tially approved in 2013 for the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple
myeloma in patients who have been previously treated with lenalidomide
and bortezomib. In a phase 2 study (PX-171-003-A1), of 266 patients
(80% of patients whom were refractory or intolerant to both bortezomib
and lenalidomide), single-agent carfilzomib resulted in a response rate of
24% for a median duration of approximately 8 months.139 KRd has been
subsequently shown to be effective in a randomized trial, and is a major
option for the treatment of relapsed disease (Table 8).68 In another
randomized trial carfilzomib plus dexamethasone was associated with an
improvement in PFS and OS compared with bortezomib plus dexametha-
sone in relapsed multiple myeloma.133,134 However, the dose of carfilzo-
mib used in this trial (56 mg/m2) is twice the standard dose, and carries a
much higher cost compared with bortezomib. Carfilzomib is typically
administered twice-weekly at a dose of 27 mg/m2 (refer to Table 6), but a
once-weekly schedule of 70 mg/m2 may be equally effective and safe,
and more convenient. Carfilzomib carries a lower risk of neurotoxicity
than bortezomib, but a small proportion (5%) of patients can experience
serious cardiac side effects. Carfilzomib-based regimens are important
options at relapse, and can work well even in patients who are refractory
to a bortezomib-containing regimen.
7.4 | Pomalidomide
Pomalidomide is an analog of lenalidomide and thalidomide initially
approved in 2013 for the treatment of relapsed refractory multiple
myeloma. It has significant activity in relapsed refractory multiple
myeloma, even in patients failing lenalidomide.140,141 Response rate
with pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (Pd) in patients refractory to
lenalidomide and bortezomib is approximately 30%.59,142 In a
randomized trial, Pd was found superior to high-dose dexamethasone

 in patients refractory to other forms of therapy for multiple myeloma
(Table 8).132 Pomalidomide-containing triplet regimens such as dara-
tumumab, pomalidomide, dexamethasone (DPd) and carfilzomib,
pomalidomide, dexamethasone (KPd) are active and are important
options at relapse for patients who are considered lenalidomide-
refractory. In frail patients and in those with indolent relapse, the
doublet regimen of Pd is a reasonable option for patients with indo-
lent relapse.
7.5 | Elotuzumab
Elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the signaling lymphocytic
activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7).73 Unlike daratumumab, elotuzumab
does not have single-agent activity but shows synergistic activity when
combined with Rd. In a phase III trial of 646 patients, elotuzumab, lena-
lidomide, dexamethasone (ERd) was superior to Rd (Table 8).73 Elotuzu-
mab is well tolerated, and was initially approved in 2015 by the FDA to
be given in combination with Rd for the treatment of patients with
multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies.
7.6 | Ixazomib
Ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor that is active in both the
relapsed
refractory
setting
and
in
newly
diagnosed
multiple
myeloma.74,143 It has the advantage of once-weekly oral administra-
tion. Compared with bortezomib it has more gastrointestinal adverse
events, but lower risk of neurotoxicity. In a randomized controlled
trial in relapsed multiple myeloma, ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexameth-
asone (IRd) was found to improve PFS compared with Rd (Table 8).74
Based on these results ixazomib was initially approved by the FDA in
2015 to be given in combination with Rd for the treatment of
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior
therapy.
7.7 | Doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin
Anthracyclines have marginal single-agent activity in multiple myeloma.

 doxorubicin compared with bortezomib alone, 9.3 months versus 6.5
months, respectively, P < 0.001.144 OS at 15 months was also superior,
76% compared with 65%, respectively, P 5 0.03. Despite this study, lip-
osomal doxorubicin is infrequently used in the treatment of relapsed
multiple
myeloma
given
availability
of
other
active
agents.
Doxorubicin-containing regimens such as PAD or VDT-PACE may be
useful in the treatment of patients with aggressive multiple myeloma
refractory to other standard myeloma agents.
7.8 | Panobinostat
Panobinostat is a pan-deacetylase inhibitor initially approved by the
FDA in 2015 for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who
have received at least two prior standard therapies, including bortezo-
mib and an immunomodulatory agent.75 Its putative mechanism of
action is blockade of the aggresome pathway, an alternative route for
cells to bypass the lethal effects of proteasome inhibition. By combin-
ing bortezomib and panobinostat, there is simultaneous blockade of
both proteasome and aggresome pathways.145,146 In a randomized trial
of 768 patients, bortezomib/dexamethasone plus panobinostat was
associated with superior PFS compared with bortezomib/dexametha-
sone plus placebo.75 However, panobinostat therapy is associated with
grade 3 diarrhea in approximately 25% of patients, and care should be
exercised when using this drug. I recommend a lower initial dose of
panobinostat than the approved starting dose, and that bortezomib be
used in the once-weekly subcutaneous schedule rather than the twice
weekly regimen used in the pivotal trial (Table 6)
7.9 | Other options
Despite the multiple option available, more patients eventually become
refractory to all drug classes. Some additional options to consider for
relapsed disease in refractory multiple myeloma include bendamustine-
containing regimens such as bendamustine, lenalidomide, dexametha-
sone or bendamustine,
bortezomib,
dexamethasone.147,148
Other
options include the addition of panobinostat to a proteasome-inhibitor
containing regimen, or the use of quadruplet regimen in which daratu-
mumab is added to a standard triplet regimen. Venetoclax is not
approved for use in multiple myeloma, but is commercially available,
and appears to have single-agent activity in patients with t(11;14) sub-
type of multiple myeloma.149 For young high-risk patients with a suita-
ble donor, allogeneic transplantation is an option as well.
7.10 | Emerging options
There are several investigational approaches that are promising and
patients should be considered for clinical trials investigating these
approaches. Two of the most exciting options include antigen receptor
T cells (CAR-T) targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) such as
bb2121,150 and GSK2857916 (a humanized anti-BCMA antibody that
is conjugated to monomethyl auristatin-F, a microtubule disrupting
agent).151 Other agents with single-agent activity that are promising
include isatuximab (a CD38 monoclonal antibody), marizomib (a new
proteasome inhibitor), oprozomib, (an oral proteasome inhibitor related
to carfilzomib), filanesib (a kinesin spindle protein inhibitor), dinaciclib (a
cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor), and LGH-447 (a pan PIM kinase
inhibitor).
Recommendations
� Patients who are eligible for ASCT should consider ASCT as salvage
therapy at first relapse if they have never had a transplant before, or
if they have had a prolonged remission with the first ASCT.
� If relapse occurs more than 6 months after stopping therapy, the ini-
tial treatment regimen that successfully controlled the multiple
myeloma initially can be re-instituted when possible.
� At first relapse, for patients who are not refractory to lenalido-
mide, my preferred option is DRd. Alternatives include KRd, IRd,
and ERd.
� At first relapse, for patients who are refractory to lenalidomide, my
preferred option is DPd. Alternatives include DVd, KPd, and VCd
� Patients who have an indolent relapse or who are frail can be treated
with oral regimens such as IRd or Pd.
� At second or higher relapse, I switch to a triplet regimen that con-
tains at least 2 new drugs that the patient is not refractory to.
� Additional options to consider in patients with multiple relapses and
disease
that
is
refractory
to
conventional
regimens
include
bendamustine-based regimens, the addition of panobinostat to a
proteasome-inhibitor containing regimen, quadruplet daratumumab-
containing regimens, multi-drug chemotherapy regimens, allogenic
transplantation in young high risk patients with a suitable donor, and
venetoclax in patients with t(11;14) multiple myeloma.
� Patients with more aggressive relapse with plasma cell leukemia or
extramedullary plasmacytomas often require therapy with a multi-
drug anthracycline containing regimen such as VDT-PACE.
� The duration of therapy has not been well addressed in relapsed
multiple myeloma, and in some regimens such as those employing
parenteral proteasome inhibitors it may be reasonable to stop ther-
apy once a stable plateau has been reached to limit minimize risks of
serious toxicity.

| SMOLDERING MULTIPLE MYELOMA
SMM is a stage that is clinically positioned between MGUS and mul-
tiple myeloma.135 It comprises of a heterogeneous group of patients,
some of whom have multiple myeloma which has not yet manifested
with MDEs, and some who have premalignant MGUS. Patients with
SMM have a risk of progression of approximately 10% per year for
the first 5 years, 3% per year for the next 5 years, and 1% per year
thereafter.19 Patients with the highest risk of progression (ultra-high
risk) have now been reclassified as having multiple myeloma by the
new IMWG criteria.1 Within the current definition of SMM (Table 1),
there are two groups of patients: high risk (25% per year risk of pro-
gression in the first 2 years) and low risk (� 5% per year risk of pro-
gression).135 Criteria for high risk SMM are given on Table 9.

 Presence of one or more of these factors is associated with a median
TTP to multiple myeloma of approximately 2 years. Early studies in
SMM failed to show an advantage to early intervention, but were
limited by lack of power, safe and effective drugs, and a risk-adapted
strategy.152,153 A recent randomized trial conducted in Spain found
that patients with high risk SMM had significant prolongation of PFS
and OS with Rd compared with observation.50,154 These are very
promising results, and further confirmatory studies are ongoing.
Observation is still the standard of care for SMM; however, selected
high risk SMM patients with multiple risk factors can be considered
for therapy. They are also candidates for clinical trials testing early
intervention, some of which are testing intensive therapy with cura-
tive intent.155
Recommendations
� I recommend observation for most patients with SMM.
� Consideration of multiple myeloma therapy can be given to the small
subset of patients with SMM who have multiple high risk factors
especially if there is progressive rise in monoclonal protein levels.
