territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2017

Summary
Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk 
assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising 
evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to 
incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–
outcome associations.
Methods We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in 
exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and 
location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 
2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence 
of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort 
studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, 
adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure 
level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the 
relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable 
burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into 
six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; 
(3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; 
(5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted 
death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure 
levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.
Findings In 2017, 34·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3–35·0) deaths and 1·21 billion (1·14–1·28) DALYs 
were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61·0% (59·6–62·4) of deaths and 48·3% (46·3–50·2) of DALYs were 
attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10·4 million (9·39–11·5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, 
followed by smoking (7·10 million [6·83–7·37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma 
glucose (6·53 million [5·23–8·23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4·72 million 
[2·99–6·70] deaths and 148 million [98·6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1·43 million [1·36–1·51] 
deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4·9% (3·3–6·5) between 2007 
and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and 
risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23·5% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of 
changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18·6% increase in 
DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI 
(O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This 
result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a 
population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given 
SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was 
high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; 
south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was 
smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for 
unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East 
were notably low.

Interpretation By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this 
assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights 
current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have 
largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the 
combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing 
trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and 
opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. 
Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are 
overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a 
benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure 
monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they 
highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that 
help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
Population-level estimates of individual risks have been 
produced periodically by both WHO and UNICEF, whereas 
independent scientific publications provide risk estimates that 
are limited in the number of risks assessed and population size 
evaluated. Since 2010, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has produced comprehensive 
assessments of risk factor burden by age, sex, cause, and location. 
The previous iteration of this study, GBD 2016, assessed 
84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic 
risks between 1990 and 2016, with major updates in the 
assessment of second-hand smoke, alcohol use, and diet. 
The GBD study remains the only peer-reviewed, comprehensive, 
and annual assessment of risk factor burden by age, sex, cause, 
location, and year that complies with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.
Added value of this study
GBD 2017 expands the scope of GBD 2016 with the estimation 
of one new risk factor—bullying victimisation—and 80 new 
risk–outcome pairs, with a total of 476 risk–outcome pairs. 
GBD 2017 incorporates 46 749 sources. We have expanded our 
estimation locations with the addition of subnational locations 
for Ethiopia, Iran, Norway, and Russia, and estimates for Māori 
and non-Māori populations in New Zealand. We implemented 
broad improvements to methods to better estimate risk factor 
exposures and relative risks. Notably, we have moved from 
total cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
implemented continuous measures of exposure for smoking, 
and updated the ambient particulate matter pollution model 
with new ground measurement data from almost 4000 sites. 
We expanded upon our decomposition analyses to investigate 
the drivers of risk-attributable burden and the changes in 
burden by country, and to decompose risk-attributable changes 
between broad categories of risks, thus providing deeper 
insight into changing patterns of risk-attributable burden and 
their underlying causes. We broadened our analyses of 
geographical and temporal trends in risk exposure and burden 
by estimating expected risk-weighted prevalence of exposures 
based on Socio-demographic Index. We explored the observed 
relationship between development status and risk exposure 
across all locations and years, and for the first time we described 
spatiotemporal patterns in the ratio of observed-to-expected 
levels of risk exposure.
Implications of all the available evidence
Decomposing trends by their underlying drivers reveals 
improvements in risk-deleted burden (ie, burden not 
attributed to risks in the GBD analysis), and broadly, 
improvements in exposure to environmental and behavioural 
risks. Conversely, increasing exposure to metabolic risks is 
driving increases in burden, indicating a crucial need for risk 
mitigation policies in this area. By quantifying the relationship 
between development and risk exposure, we highlight which 
risks appear sensitive to development and, of those, which are 
likely to improve or worsen with development. This analysis 
highlights areas where countries are either overperforming or 
underperforming relative to their economic peers and provides 
insight into areas where risk-modification strategies might be 
the best targets to improve health.
Introduction
The environmental, behavioural, and metabolic risks 
that drive injury and disease are the mechanisms by 
which public health efforts can most efficiently and 
effectively prevent health loss. Effecting population 
health improvements, therefore, requires understanding 
of not only the injuries and diseases that drive 
health burdens, but also the risks that drive injury and 
disease. Through a constantly evolving collection of 
cohort studies, randomised trials, and case-control 
studies, decades of epidemiological research have worked 
to quantify the nature and magnitude of associations

between risk exposures and outcomes in studied pop-
ulations. Moving beyond individual studies of individual 
populations, this raw evidence can be synthesised to 
draw the comprehensive and robust conclusions that are 
necessary to inform good public health policy. The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a com-
prehensive and comparable approach to risk factor 
quantifi 
cation that offers a useful tool for synthesising 
evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With 
each annual GBD, we update the GBD CRA to incor-
porate new data on risk–outcome pairs, risk exposure 
levels, and risk–outcome associations.
Previous GBD studies have assessed the relationship 
between development, as measured by the Socio-demo-
graphic Index (SDI), and both the magnitude and 
composition of disease burden.1–4 The results of those 
analyses highlighted the dramatic declines in com-
municable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 
(CMNNDs) that have generally occurred with increases 
in socioeconomic development as well as the subsequent 
increases in life expectancy and absolute burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs)—a pattern referred to as 
the epidemio 
logical transition. Previous GBD analyses 
also estimated the expected burden for each cause in 
every location and year, based on that location’s SDI. The 
comparison of observed burden to the burden expected 
based on SDI offered insight into the relative performance 
of countries at similar levels of development. Here, we 
extend those methods to analyse epidemiological 
transition with regards to risk exposure and risk-
attributable burden. This analysis allows the identification 
of risks that are positively associated with development, 
negatively associated with development, or independent 
of development status. By estimating the levels of risk 
exposure and risk-attributable burden on the basis of 
SDI, and comparing these expectations to observed 
levels, it is possible to identify locations that either 
underperform or overperform compared with similarly 
developed countries.
The GBD 2017 CRA includes 84 risk factors and 
476 associated risk–outcome pairs. We expanded the 
scope of GBD 2016 with the inclusion of 80 new outcomes 
for existing risks and one new risk factor: bullying 
victimisation. The study provides estimates of exposure 
and attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) for 195 countries and territories for 1990 through 
2017, including new subnational estimates for Ethiopia, 
Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia. We explored 
changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing 
those changes into six main component drivers of 
change, explored the relationship between risk exposure 
and SDI, and estimated the ratio of observed-to-expected 
levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. 
As with previous iterations of GBD, the GBD 2017 CRA 
results presented here supersede all previously published 
GBD CRA estimates.
Methods
Overview
The CRA conceptual framework was developed by 
Murray and Lopez,5 who established a causal web of 
hierarchically organised risks that contribute to health 
outcomes and facilitate the quantification of risks at any 
level in the framework. In GBD 2017, as in previous 
GBDs, we assessed a set of behavioural, environmental 
or occupational, and metabolic risks that were organised 
into five hierarchical levels (appendix 1 section 5). At 
Level 0, GBD 2017 reports estimates for all risk factors 
combined. Nested within Level 0, Level 1 includes three 
risk categories: environmental and occupational, meta-
bolic, and behavioural risk factors. This hierarchical 
structure continues, with each subsequent level 
including more detailed risks factors that are nested 
within the broader category above it. There are 19 risks at 
Level 2, 39 risks at Level 3, and 22 risks at Level 4, for a 
total of 84 risks or risk groups, where all risks (Level 0) is 
included as a risk group. Although we have added 
bullying as a new risk factor, the total number of risk 
factors remains un 
changed from GBD 2016 because of 
the merging of two risk factors: we previously estimated 
second-hand smoke and occupational exposure to 
second-hand smoke as two separate risks but have 
incorporated the two exposures into one second-hand 
smoke Level 3 risk for GBD 2017
. Each risk factor is 
associated with an outcome or outcomes, and each 
combination of risk and outcome included in the GBD is 
Key messages
• 
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 expands on 
GBD 2016 with the estimation of one new risk factor—bullying victimisation—and 
80 new risk–outcome pairs, making a total of 476 risk–outcome pairs. The study further 
investigates the drivers of changes in risk-attributable burden and explores the 
relationship between development and risk exposure.
• 
In 2017, 34·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3–35·0) deaths and 1·21 billion 
(1·14–1·28) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to risk factors 
included in GBD 2017. All included risks combined contributed to 61·0% (59·6–62·4) 
of deaths and 48·3% (46·3–50·2) of DALYs worldwide.
• 
The five leading risks in 2017 were high systolic blood pressure, smoking, high fasting 
plasma glucose, high body-mass index, and short gestation for birthweight.
• 
DALY-based ranks for all metabolic risks increased between 1990 and 2017 for both 
males and females. Consequently, four of the five leading risks were behavioural risks 
in 1990, whereas three of the five leading risks were metabolic risks in 2017.
• 
Between 2007 and 2017, the absolute number of risk-attributable DALYs declined by 
3·44% (95% UI 2·47–4·40). During that period, exposures to behavioural, 
environmental, and occupational risks declined (improved), but these gains were 
somewhat offset by increases in exposure to metabolic risks, population growth, 
and population ageing.
• 
Socioeconomic development was strongly associated with exposure levels for many 
risks. Among the leading risks, unsafe water, household air pollution, and child 
wasting show pronounced decreasing trends with development. Conversely, smoking, 
alcohol use, drug use, and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol all show a 
pronounced increasing trend with development.

referred to as a risk–outcome pair. Risk–outcome pairs 
were included on the basis of evidence rules (appendix 1 
section 5). To date, we have not quantified the con-
tribution of distal social, cultural, and economic risk 
factors; however, our analysis of the relationship between 
risk exposures and socio 
demographic development, 
measured with SDI, offers insights into the relationship 
between economic context and risk factors.
This analysis largely follows the CRA methods used in 
GBD 2016.2 Given the scope of the analysis, we offer a 
high-level overview of the study methods and analytical 
logic, detailing areas of notable change and innovation 
since GBD 2016 and include risk-specific details in 
appendix 1 (section 4). This study complies with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting statement6 (appendix 1 section 5).
Geographical units of analysis and years for estimation
For GBD 2017, we have estimated risk factor exposure 
and attributable burden by age, sex, cause, and location 
from 1990 to 2017
. GBD locations are arranged in a nested 
hierarchy: 195 countries and territories are within 
21 regions and these 21 regions are within seven super-
regions. Each year, GBD includes sub 
national analyses for 
a few new countries and continues to provide subnational 
estimates for countries that were added in previous cycles. 
Subnational estimation in GBD 2017 includes five new 
countries (Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, Russia) 
and countries previously estimated at subnational levels 
(GBD 2013: China, Mexico, and the UK [regional level]; 
GBD 2015: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, 
Sweden, and the USA; GBD 2016: Indonesia and the UK 
[local government authority level]). All analyses are at the 
first level of administrative organisation within each 
country except for New Zealand (by Māori ethnicity), 
Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), and the UK 
(by local government authorities). All subnational 
estimates for these countries were incorporated into 
model development and evaluation as part of GBD 2017
. 
To meet data use requirements, in this publication we 
present all subnational estimates excluding those pending 
publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Sweden, 
the UK, and the USA; appendix 2). Subnational estimates 
for countries with populations larger than 200 million 
(measured using the most recent year of pub 
lished 
estimates) that have not yet been published else 
where 
are presented wherever estimates are illustrated with 
maps but are not included in data tables.
Attributable burden estimation
Four components were used for the calculations to 
estimate the attributable burden for a given risk–
outcome pair: (1) the estimate of the burden metric 
being assessed for the cause (ie, number of deaths, 
years of life lost [YLLs], years lived with disability 
[YLDs], or DALYs); (2) the exposure levels for the risk 
factor; (3) the counter 
factual level of risk factor exposure 
or theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL); 
and (4) the relative risk of the outcome relative to the 
TMREL. For a given risk–outcome pair, we estimated 
attributable DALYs as total DALYs for the outcome 
multiplied by the population attributable fraction (PAF) 
for the risk–out 
come pair for each age, sex, location, 
and year. The same logic applies to estimating 
attributable deaths, YLLs, and YLDs. The PAF is the 
proportion by which the outcome would be reduced in 
a given population and in a given year if the exposure to 
a risk factor in the past were reduced to the 
counterfactual level of the TMREL. The PAF for each 
individual risk–outcome pair is estimated independently 
and incorporates all burden for the outcome that is 
attributable to the risk, whether directly or indirectly. 
For example, the burden of ischaemic heart disease 
attributable to high body-mass index (BMI) includes 
the burden resulting from the direct effect of BMI on 
ischaemic heart disease risk, as well as the burden 
through the effects of BMI on ischaemic heart disease 
that are mediated through other risks (eg, high systolic 
blood pressure [SBP] and high low-density lipoprotein 
[LDL] cholesterol). When aggregating PAFs across 
multiple risks we used a mediation adjustment 
to compute the excess attenuated risk for each of 
205 mediation-risk-cause sets (appendix 1 section 5).
Estimation process
Information about the data sources, estimation methods, 
computational tools, and statistical analyses used to 
derive our estimates are provided in appendix 1 
(sections 1–4). The analytical steps for estimating the 
burden attributable to single or clusters of risk–out 
come 
pairs are summarised in the appendix 1 (section 2). 
Table 1 provides definitions of exposure for each risk 
factor and the TMREL used. Although the approach taken 
is largely similar to GBD 2016, we have implemented 
improve 
ments to methods and incorpor 
ated new data 
sources. Appendix 1 (section 4) details each analytical step 
by risk. Citation information for the data sources used for 
relative risks is provided in an online source tool.
We report all point estimates with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). To ensure that UIs capture uncertainty 
from all relevant sources (uncertainty in exposures, 
relative risks, TMRELs, and burden estimates) we 
propagate uncertainty through the estimation chain 
using posterior simulation using 1000 draws, from which 
we derive the lower and upper bounds of the UI based on 
the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles. Where reported, esti-
mates of percentage change were computed on the basis 
of the point estimates for the timepoints being compared.
Summary exposure values
For each risk, we produced a summary measure of 
exposure, called the summary exposure value (SEV). The 
metric is a risk-weighted prevalence of an exposure, and 
it offers an easily comparable single-number summary

of exposure to each risk. SEVs range from 0% to 100%, 
where 0% reflects no risk exposure in a population and 
100% indicates that an entire population is exposed to the 
maximum possible level for that risk. We show estimates 
of SEVs for each risk factor (table 2; appendix 2) and 
provide details on how SEVs are computed for categorical 
and continuous risks in the appendix 1 (section 2).
Updates to spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression
Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression has been 
used in previous versions of GBD to estimate exposure 
for many risks, typically those with rich age-sex-specific 
data. It synthesises noisy data by borrowing strength 
across space, time, and age to best estimate the underlying 
trends for a given risk. With sufficient data, spatiotemporal 
Gaussian process regression is a fast and flexible 
modelling strategy for fitting non-linear temporal trends. 
Although methods were detailed for previous iterations of 
GBD,2 we have implemented several improve 
ments for 
GBD 2017
. First, we have added a space-time interaction 
weight, which flexibly adjusts the spatial weight of 
datapoints as an inverse function of data density over

time. Second, we refined our method for calculating 
model uncertainty to ensure that modelling CIs aligned 
better with observed data variance and were more resilient 
to parameter changes. Finally, we improved raking, a 
post-processing step that ensures internal consistency 
between nested locations (sub 
nationals) and their parents. 
Specifically, we implemented an option to rake in logit 
space, ensuring that raked estimates of prevalence data 
are naturally constrained between 0 and 1. More details 
are given in appendix 1 (section 2).
Drivers of trends in DALYs
We decomposed temporal changes in DALYs into six main 
component drivers of change: (1) population growth; 
(2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in 
exposure to environmental and occu 
pational risks; 
(4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks, (5) changes 
in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all 
other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and 
DALY rates. The risk-deleted rate is the death or DALY 
rate that would be observed had we removed all risk 
factors included in GBD 2017
. In other words, the risk-
deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we 
reduced exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors 
included in GBD 2017
. Changes in risk-deleted rates might 
reflect changes in risks or risk–outcome pairs that are not 
included in our analysis, or changes in other factors like 
improved treatments. We used methods developed by 
Das Gupta7 and adapted in GBD 2016 to ensure that 
decomposition results are linear aggregates over time or 
risk. We did a decomposition analysis for the 10-year 
period of 2007–17, for individual risks and the all-risk 
aggregate, accounting for risk mediation at the Level 4 risk 
and cause level. The contribution of changes in exposure 
to the individual risks was scaled to the all-risk effect. The 
contribution of risk exposures at higher cause and risk 
aggregates (eg, all-cause attributable to Level 1 GBD risks), 
or for all ages and both sexes combined, were calculated as 
the linear aggregate of the effect of individual risks for 
each cause, age, and sex.
Epidemiological transition
SDI is a composite indicator of development status that 
was originally constructed for GBD 2015, and is derived 
from components that correlate strongly with health 
outcomes. It is the geometric mean for indices of the 
total fertility rate among women younger than 25 years, 
mean education for those aged 15 years or older, and lag-
distributed income per capita. The resulting metric 
ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values corresponding to 
higher levels of development. SDI estimation methods 
and estimates are detailed in appendix 1 (section 2). We 
examined the relationship between SDI and SEV to 
understand the relationship between development status 
and risk factor exposure levels. For each risk factor, we fit a 
separate generalised additive model with a Loess smoother 
on SDI for each combination of age group and sex. Inputs 
to this model were age-sex-specific SEVs for all Level 4 
risks in the GBD risk hierarchy, for all national GBD 
locations and years between 1990 and 2017
. Using an 
analogous modelling framework, we estimated the 
expected age and sex structure by SDI and used these 
expected age and sex proportions to calculate age and sex 
aggregates of expected exposure. For each risk–outcome 
pair, we used the expected SEVs to calculate expected 
PAFs. Because the SEVs for a given risk are not cause 
specific, the expected PAF estimates were then corrected 
using cause-specific correction factors that were derived by 
calibrating expected PAFs against empirical PAFs. To 
estimate expected risk-attributable burden, we drew from 
the CRA methods, first calculating the joint adjusted 
expected PAF for all risks for a cause using mediation 
factors (appendix 1 section 2). We then drew from the 
methods for observed risk-attributable burden calculation, 
using expected YLLs, deaths, and YLDs (appendix 1 
section 2) to generate expected burden for a given SDI.
New risks and risks with substantial changes in the 
estimation methods compared with GBD 2016
Bullying victimisation is a new risk factor for GBD 2017
. 
We estimate two outcomes for bullying in the GBD 
analysis: anxiety disorders and major depressive 
disorder. Bullying is commonly conceptualised as the 
intentional and repeated harm of a less powerful 
individual by peers and defined in the GBD as bullying 
victimisation of children and adolescents attending 
school by peers. This does not mean that bullying 
occurs exclusively at school and includes bullying that 
might occur to and from school as well as cyberbullying. 
We developed inclusion criteria that were robust 
while adaptable to the hetero 
geneity in largely non-
health literature. Prevalence data were sourced from 
multicountry survey series including the Global School-
based Student Health Survey and the Health Behavior in 
School-aged Children survey, as well as peer-reviewed 
studies, and were available for 153 GBD locations, 
covering all seven GBD super-regions. To reflect the 
exposure data and the definition of bullying victimisation 
in GBD, we adjusted prevalence estimates for the 
proportion of young people attending school using 
data published by the UN Educational, Scientific, and 
Culture Organization. Because the effect of bullying on 
depressive and anxiety disorders has been reported to 
wane over time and because prevalence estimates were 
from surveys of young people reporting current bullying 
victimisation rather than estimates of past exposure at 
the time the outcomes occur (ie, retrospective estimates), 
we developed a cohort method in which the prevalence 
of bullying victimisation exposure was tracked for the 
cohort of interest and relative risks varied with time 
between exposure to bullying and the point of estimation.
In GBD 2017, the modelling process for air pollution, 
including ambient, household, and ozone exposure 
sources, was substantially improved. We adjusted the

risk hierarchy, retaining air pollution as a Level 2 risk, 
adding particulate matter pollution at Level 3, and 
moving both household air pollution due to exposure to 
smoke from solid cooking fuels and ambient particulate 
matter pollution to Level 4 of the hierarchy. Developed 
for risk attribution for particulate matter pollution, the 
integrated exposure response curves combine epidemio-
logical data from ambient, household, second-hand, and 
active smoking sources to construct a risk curve for the 
full exposure range. We updated the integrated exposure 
responses to include studies on ambient air pollution 
cohorts that were published after we completed our 
literature review for GBD 2016, systematic reviews of all 
active smoking cohorts, and a systematic review of 
second-hand smoke and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD). We also developed a strategy to map 
cohort studies of household air pollution to exposure 
levels of particulate matter less than 2·5 µm in diameter 
(PM₂.₅) to incorporate them into the curves.
We did a systematic search of the scientific literature of 
health outcomes resulting from long-term exposure to 
ambient particulate matter pollution and, consequently, 
included type 2 diabetes as a new outcome for both 
ambient and household air pollution. Evidence suggests 
that exposure to PM₂·₅ might be mechanistically linked 
to type 2 diabetes through altered lung function, vascular 
inflammation, and insulin sensitivity.8
We estimated ambient PM₂·₅ exposure by combining 
satellite data with a chemical transport model and land 
use infor 
mation. We calibrated satellite measurements 
to ground measurements using the Data Integration 
Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ).9 We made three 
not 
able improvements as follows: (1) we expanded our 
database of ground measure 
ments from approximately 
6000 to 9700 sites; (2) we made updates so the calibration 
model varies smo 
othly over space and time in data-dense 
regions; and (3) we improved uncertainty estimation by 
sampling from the DIMAQ’s poster distribution in each 
grid cell (appendix 1 section 4).
For previous GBDs, we have calculated relative risks 
from the integrated exposure response curves to produce 
PAFs and attributable burden for ambient particulate 
matter and household air pollution using the same 
TMREL for both risk factors. However, were a population 
to reduce one of the component exposures (ie, either 
household or ambient pollution), the other would 
remain. To capture this, we used a proportional PAF 
approach in which the integrated exposure response is 
used to calculate a relative risk and PAF for exposure to 
particulate matter from both ambient and household 
sources, and these are then weighted by the proportion of 
individuals exposed to each source (appendix 1 section 4).
In GBD 2016, we estimated the burden attributable to 
low intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, where low 
intake was the result of polyunsaturated fatty acids being 
replaced by saturated fats. Considering that it is equally 
harmful to replace polyunsaturated fatty acids with either 
saturated fat or carbohydrates,10 we have redefined the 
risk factor as low polyunsaturated fatty acids intake 
where these were replaced by either saturated fatty acids 
or carbohydrates. In this approach, the TMREL for poly-
unsaturated fatty acids does not account for saturated fat 
intake.
For estimating consumption of whole grains, we 
developed an approach to use UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) data, notably increasing our data 
coverage across countries and through time. First, we 
separately estimated total grain and refined grain avail-
ability, where availability includes domestic production, 
adjusted for imports, exports, waste, and animal feed. 
With whole grains and refined grains representing the 
entirety of all grain available, we calculated the availability 
of whole grains as the difference between total and 
refined grains. Finally, we adjusted these estimates using 
24-h dietary recall data to represent consumption.
In past cycles of GBD, given the strength of the causal 
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage intake 
and BMI compared with the association between sugar-
sweetened beverages and disease endpoints, we 
estimated the disease burden of high intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages through its effect on BMI. This 
decision was based on the observation that evidence 
supporting a causal relationship between sugar-
sweetened beverages and BMI was stronger than

evidence for a direct causal relationship between sugar-
sweetened beverages and disease endpoints. In GBD 
2017, we reassessed all existing evidence on causal 
relationships between sugar-sweetened beverages and 
disease endpoints, and found sufficient evidence for a 
causal relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages 
and ischaemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. There-
fore, we have updated our approach and quantified the 
burden of disease attributable to the direct effect of 
sugar-sweetened beverages on disease endpoints.
We added four new outcomes for high BMI as follows: 
type 2 diabetes, liver cancer due to non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and intra-
cerebral haemorrhage. We applied the relative risk of 
diabetes only to type 2 diabetes. Relative risks for the 
association between high BMI and all liver cancers were 
used for both liver cancer due to non-alcoholic fatty liver 
and liver cancer due to other causes. Similarly, relative 
risks for the association between high BMI and haemor-
rhagic stroke were used for both subarachnoid haemor-
rhage and intracerebral haemorrhage.
We added five additional outcomes for high fasting 
plasma glucose (FPG) as follows: type 1 diabetes, type 2 
diabetes, liver cancer due to non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease,11 subarachnoid haemorrhage, and intracerebral 
haemorrhage.12 Because an increased FPG concentration 
is the hallmark of diabetes, we assumed the PAFs were 
1·0 for FPG and both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. 
Relative risks for the association between high FPG and 
all liver cancers were used for liver cancer due to non-
alcoholic fatty liver and liver cancer due to other causes. 
Similarly, relative risks for the association between high 
FPG and haemorrhagic stroke were used for both 
subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemor-
rhage.
We made four important changes related to the 
estimation of burden attributable to iron deficiency. 
First, the definitions of the GBD cause “dietary iron 
deficiency” and the risk factor “iron deficiency” are no 
longer iden 
tical. The GBD cause name was changed 
from “iron-deficiency anaemia” to “dietary iron 
deficiency” to clarify the focus on inadequate intake and 
exclusion of other causes that can manifest as absolute 
or functional iron deficiency. Second, although the 
GBD risk factor name remained “iron deficiency”, the 
exposure estimates were expanded to include all iron 
deficiency, irrespective of whether or not inadequate 
dietary intake is the underlying cause (appendix 1 
section 4). This change was based on review of the 
Child Health Epidemiology Research Group (CHERG) 
Iron Report,13 whose com 
ponent studies revealed no 
distinction as to the aetiology of iron deficiency. Third, 
on the basis of the studies included in the CHERG Iron 
Report,13 which only assessed overall maternal mortality 
as an outcome, we added all subcauses of maternal 
disorders as outcomes of iron deficiency (the risk), 
leading to higher estimates of the burden attributable to 
iron deficiency among women of reproductive age. 
Fourth, on the basis of the absence of evidence 
supporting dietary iron deficiency as a primary cause of 
death, dietary iron deficiency was removed from the 
GBD 2017 cause of death analysis, resulting in zero 
mortality burden and lower overall estimates of burden 
for dietary iron deficiency (the cause). Dietary iron 
deficiency (the cause) is expressed in terms of prevalence 
and YLDs, but the exposure to iron deficiency (the risk) 
remains expressed as the counterfactual haemoglobin 
concentration that would be present in a given popu-
lation group in the absence of all causes of anaemia that 
manifest as iron deficiency.
We made three major improvements to our analysis of 
low birthweight for gestation and short gestation for 
birthweight. First, we added individual-level linked birth 
and death cohort data from nearly 25 million births in 
Japan and Singapore to strengthen our analysis of the 
joint mortality risk surface. Second, we drew on the 
strong correlation between birthweight and gestational 
age that we identified in our microdata analysis and used 
birthweight data to inform exposure estimates of short 
gestation. We also strengthened the link between non-
fatal and risk analyses to ensure estimates of preterm 
birth were fully consistent throughout GBD 2017
. The 
addition of individual-level linked birth and death cohort 
data resulted in higher estimates for low birthweight 
prevalence, mostly in data-sparse locations, whereas 
the consistency changes resulted in higher exposure 
estimates for both low birthweight and for short 
gestation, particularly in the late neonatal period. Third, 
we corrected an error where the risk attributable to low 
birthweight was mistakenly attributed to short gestation 
and vice versa in GBD 2016. This correction has no effect 
on the aggregate risk of low birthweight and short 
gestation but is the chief driver of differences in each 
individually.
We have moved from estimating total cholesterol 
in GBD 2016 to estimating LDL cholesterol for GBD 
2017
. During the past two decades, substantially more 
data have been collected on LDL cholesterol than total 
cholesterol concentrations. The strong statistical rela-
tion 
ship between total and LDL cholesterol also allows 
us to model LDL cholesterol when other cholesterol 
sub 
fractions, such as high-density lipo 
protein, are 
reported, but LDL cholesterol concentrations are not.14 
The use of LDL cholesterol improves the policy rele-
vance of our estimates, because LDL cholesterol is the 
key target of cholesterol-lowering medications and is 
the most com 
monly used laboratory biomarker for 
clinical decision making. We applied this change to the 
full dataset, including data that were newly extracted for 
GBD 2017 and data that had been extracted in previous 
iter 
ations of GBD.
To estimate smoking-attributable burden for GBD 
2017, we transitioned from using 5-year lagged daily 
smoking prevalence (ie, the prevalence of smoking 
 Global Health Metrics
1938 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
5 years before the date for which estimates are being 
produced) and the smoking impact ratio to using 
continuous measures of exposure that incorporate 
cumulative effects among daily, occasional, and former 
smokers for 47 smoking-attributable health outcomes. 
We continue to use 5-year lagged daily smoking 
prevalence as the measure of exposure for ten outcomes. 
We estimated exposure among current smokers for two 
continuous indicators: cigarettes per smoker per day, 
and pack-years. We estimated exposure among former 
smokers using years since cessation. We estimated 
non-linear dose-response curves using a Bayesian 
meta-regression model for each of these continuous 
exposures. For nine out 
comes with significant differ-
ences in effect size by sex or age, we produced sex-
specific or age-specific risk curves (appendix 1 section 5). 
We included all forms of smoked tobacco in our exposure 
estimates and, given data limitations, assume that the 
risk of non-cigarette smoked tobacco products is the 
same as the risk of cigarettes; given the scarcity of data, 
we do not include electronic cigarette or vaporiser use in 
our exposure estimates.
We added two new outcomes for high SBP: sub 
arachnoid 
haemorrhage and calcific aortic valve disease. For both 
outcomes, we estimated relative risks on the basis of data 
from a pooled cohort study of 1·2 million participants.15 
We know of no large cohort that has reported age-sex-
specific relative risks of either sub 
arachnoid haemorrhage 
or calcific aortic valve disease due to increased SBP, and 
used proxy causes for each as follows: we estimated the 
relative risks for subarachnoid haemorrhage on the basis 
of all stroke and those for calcific aortic valve disease on the 
basis of other cardiovascular disease. For each cause, we 
estimated age-sex-specific relative risks associated with a 
10 mm Hg increase in SBP using the DisMod meta-
regression tool (appendix 1 section 2).
We have improved the exposure-modelling framework 
for unsafe water and sanitation. We estimate exposure

levels for unsafe water and sanitation using ordinal 
categories. For example, we estimate the prevalence of 
exposure to three levels of unsafe water: piped, improved, 
and unimproved drinking water. Previously, the preva-
lences of piped and improved water were modelled 
independently, and we derived the prevalence of unim-
proved water as one minus the sum of piped and 
improved water. For GBD 2017, we modelled the preva-
lence of piped water as before, but now explicitly model 
the prevalence of improved and unimproved water 
separately as proportions of the unpiped envelope. This 
approach enables us to use the exposure category for 
which we have the most data (ie, piped water access) 
while also ensuring that the three exposure categories 
sum to one. The modelling process for unsafe sanitation 
was revised in an analogous way.

Results
Global exposure to risks
We observed diverse temporal trends for levels of exposure 
to different risk factors between 1990 and 2017 (table 2). 
During that time, SEVs for two risks increased by more 
than 40%: SEVs for high BMI increased by 70·4% (95% UI 
57·1–84·5) and SEVs for ambient parti 
culate matter 
pollution increased by 41·2% (32·1–52·0). Conversely, 
SEVs for four risks decreased by more than 40%: SEVs for 
child underweight decreased by 44·4% (41·2–48·1), 
household air pollution by 45·8% (41·5–49·8), diet high 
in trans fatty acids by 46·6% (32·8–66·3), and unsafe 
sanitation by 47·8% (43·2–52·1).
SDI and SEVs were strongly associated for many risks 
(figure 1; for all risks, see appendix 2). Unsafe water source, 
unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, lead exposure, 
child underweight, child wasting, child stunting, iron 
deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, low calcium, and intimate 
partner violence all show a pronounced decreasing trend 
with increasing SDI. Conversely, discontinued breast-
feeding, smoking, alcohol use, drug use, high red meat 
consumption, high processed meat consumption, high 
sugar-sweetened bever 
age consumption, and high LDL 
cholesterol all show a pronounced increasing trend 
with increased SDI. Other risks show no clear association 
with SDI, including ozone, radon, low whole grains, 
and low fibre.
Global attributable burden for all risk factors combined
Globally, 61·0% (95% UI 59·6–62·4) of deaths and 
48·3% (46·3–50·2) of DALYs were attributed to the risk 
factors addressed in GBD 2017 (appendix 2). The largest 
percentage of deaths attributable to risk factors were 
among NCDs at 64·8% (63·1–66·6), followed by 
CMNNDs at 61·6% (59·0–64·4), and injuries at 24·4% 
(22·2–26·5). For DALYs, the largest risk-attributable 
proportion was among CMNNDs (64·0%, 61·8–66·0), 
followed by NCDs (45·6%, 42·8–48·4), and injuries 
(22·1%, 20·2–24·0). Risk-attributable DALYs declined 
4·9% (3·3–6·5) and deaths declined 8·3% (6·9–9·5) 
between 2007 and 2017
. The numbers of risk-attributable 
deaths and DALYs in 2007 and 2017 are provided for each 
cause in table 3. 
In 2017, NCDs had the largest risk-attributable burden, 
with 26·6 million (95% UI 25·8–27·5) deaths and 
706 million (659–756) DALYs attributable to all risk 
factors combined (appendix 2). The five leading 
NCD causes of absolute risk-attributable DALYs were 
ischaemic heart disease, intracerebral haemorrhage, 
type 2 diabetes, COPD, and ischaemic stroke. In 2017, 
95·0% (95% UI 93·4–96·3), and 93·8% (91·3–95·9) 
of ischaemic heart disease DALYs and deaths were 
risk attri 
butable, resulting in 162 million (158–166) 
risk-attributable ischaemic heart disease DALYs, and 
8·38 million (8·10–8·65) risk-attributable ischaemic 
heart disease deaths. After ischaemic heart disease, intra-
cerebral haemorrhage had 57·9 million (55·2–60·6) risk-
attributable DALYs (89·8% [87·0–92·3] of all intracerebral 
haemorrhage DALYs), type 2 diabetes had 57·4 million 
(45·0–71·9), COPD had 54·9 million (48·1–60·4; 67·3% 
[60·8–72·8] of all COPD DALYs), and ischaemic stroke 
had 47·8 million (43·4–52·3; 86·7% [82·7–90·8] of 
ischaemic stroke DALYs). Because we estimated a PAF of 
1·0 for high FPG and type 2 diabetes, 100% of type 2 
diabetes DALYs and deaths were attributed to risk factors 
addressed in GBD 2017
.
Among CMNNDs, 6·40 million (6·00–7·00) deaths 
and 446 million (419–475) DALYs were attributable to 
risks. The five leading causes of absolute risk-attributable 
DALYs among CMNNDs were lower respiratory infec-
tions, diarrhoeal diseases, neonatal preterm birth com-
plications, neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia 
and trauma, and HIV
/AIDS resulting in other diseases. 
In 2017, 80·5% (95% UI 77·4–83·4) and 64·0% 
(59·9–68·1) of lower respiratory infection DALYs and 
deaths were risk attributable, resulting in 76·9 million 
(66·1–92·8) risk-attributable lower respiratory infection 
DALYs and 1·64 million (1·51–1·77) risk-attributable 
lower respiratory infection deaths. Diarrhoeal diseases 
had 76·9 million (66·1–92·8) risk-attributable DALYs 
(94·9% [89·8–97·7] of all diarrhoeal diseases DALYs), 
neonatal preterm birth had 70·2 million (64·4–77·2; 
100% of all neonatal preterm birth DALYs, since we 
estimate a PAF of 1·0 for this risk factor), neonatal 
encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma had 
41·2 million (36·7–45·0; 72·9% [66·6–78·3] of neonatal 
encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma 
DALYs), and HIV
/AIDS resulting in other diseases 
had 32·6 million (29·1–36·3; 77·5% [75·6–79·2] of 
HIV
/AIDS resulting in other diseases DALYs).

Among injuries, 1·09 million (0·99–1·19) deaths and 
55·9 million (49·6–62·5) DALYs were attributable to 
risks in 2017
. The five leading injury causes of risk-
attributable DALYs were falls, self-harm by other 
specified means, motor vehicle road injuries, pedestrian 
road injuries, and motorcyclist road injuries. In 2017, 
34·1% (95% UI 30·7–38·2) of DALYs and 43·4% 
(40·6–46·6) of deaths from falls were risk attributable, 
resulting in 12·2 million (9·93–15·0) risk-attributable 
DALYs and 302 000 (275 000–330 000) risk-attributable 
deaths from falls. Self-harm by other specified means 
had 8·07 million (5·50–10·7) risk-attributable DALYs 
(25·7% [17·6–33·9] of all DALYs from self-harm by other 
specified means), motor vehicle road injuries had 
5·95 million (5·19–6·70; 24·2% [21·3–27·0] of all motor 
vehicle road injury DALYs), pedestrian road injuries 
had 5·50 million (4·76–6·28; 23·4% [20·8–26·1] of 
pedestrian road injury DALYs), and motorcyclist road 
injuries had 4·05 million (3·46–4·64; 29·0% [25·3–32·4] 
of motorcyclist road injury DALYs).
Levels and trends in the burden attributable to risk 
factors
In 2017, 34·1 million (95% UI 33·3–35·0) deaths and 
1·21 billion (1·14–1·28) DALYs were attributable to 
GBD risk factors (table 3). Between 2007 and 2017, the 
number of all-age risk-attributable YLLs declined from 
1·04 billion (1·02–1·07) to 944 million (922–968), and age-
standardised YLL rates declined from 16 359 (16 005–16 748) 
per 100 000 to 12 509 (12 205–12 837) per 100 000. Age-
standardised risk-attri 
butable death rates declined from 
531 (520–544) per 100 000 in 2007 to 448 (437–460) per 
100 000 in 2017
. Conversely, during that period, the absolute 
number of risk-attributable deaths increased from 
31·5 million (30·9–32·2) to 34·1 million (33·3–35·0). 
During the same period, there was no significant trend in 
risk-attributable non-fatal burden because there was no 
statistically significant trend in non-fatal burden: age-
standard 
ised risk-attributable YLD rates were 3442 
(2593–4374) per 100 000 in 2007 and 3357 (2528–4275) 
per 100 000 in 2017; and the absolute numbers of risk-
attributable YLDs were 227 million (170–288) in 2007 and 
263 million (198–336) in 2017
. The largest percentage 
declines in the number of risk-attributable DALYs are for 
measles; the largest per 
centage increases are for 
osteoarthritis. Globally in 2017, high SBP was the leading 
risk factor, accounting for 10·4 million (9·39–11·5) deaths 
and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking 
(7·10 million [6·83–7·37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] 
DALYs), high FPG (6·53 million [5·23–8·23] deaths and 
171 million [144–201] DALYs), high BMI (4·72 million 
[2·99–6·70] deaths and 148 million [98·6–202] DALYs), 
and short gestation (1·43 million [1·36–1·51] deaths and 
139 million [131–147] DALYs; table 3).
Behavioural risk factors accounted for 43·6% (95% UI 
41·7–45·5) of all DALYs in 1990, followed by environ-
mental and occupational risk factors at 17·4% (15·9–19·0) 
and metabolic at 10·3% (9·63–11·1). Between 1990 
and 2017, these percentages declined by 16·2% for 
behavioural risk factors, which accounted for 36·5% 
(34·7–38·4) of all DALYs in 2017, and 29·3% for environ-
mental and occupational risks, which accounted for 
12·3% (11·5–13·3) in 2017
. Proportions increased by 
63·7% for metabolic risks, which accounted for 16·9% 
(15·6–18·3) of all DALYs in 2017
.
The proportion of all DALYs attributable to each Level 1 
risk also varies with SDI (appendix 2). Metabolic risks 
accounted for increasingly large proportions of DALYs 
with increasing levels of SDI, up to high-middle SDI: 
metabolic risks accounted for 8·31% (95% UI 7·69–9·00) 
of DALYs in low SDI, 13·6% (12·6–14·7) in low-middle 
SDI, 21·3% (19·6–23·0) in middle SDI, 24·8% 
(22·7–27·2) in high-middle SDI, and 20·7% (18·4–23·1) 
in high SDI countries. Conversely, both behavioural and 
environmental and occupational risks accounted for 
smaller proportions of DALYs in higher SDI regions. 
Behavioural risks accounted for 38·8% (37·2–40·4) of 
DALYs in low SDI, 38·5% (36·8–40·2) in low-middle 
SDI, 35·2% (33·2–37·2) in middle SDI, 37·4% 
(34·9–39·7) in high-middle SDI, and 30·2% (28·1–32·4) 
in high SDI countries. Environmental and occupational 
risks accounted for 16·9% (15·6–18·3) of DALYs in 
low SDI, 14·1% (13·0–15·3) in low-middle SDI, 11·1% 
(10·2–12·0) in middle SDI, 9·61% (8·85–10·4) in high-
middle SDI, and 6·56% (5·92–7·23) in high SDI 
countries (appendix 2).
Changes in leading risk factors
Between 1990 and 2017, high SBP was consistently 
responsible for the largest number of all-cause deaths, 
followed by smoking then high FPG. The fourth leading 
risk for mortality in 1990 was child wasting, which was in 
21st position in 2017
. The fourth leading risk for mortality 
in 2017 was high BMI, which increased in rank from 
1990 when it was ninth. High LDL cholesterol remained 
the fifth leading cause of risk-attributable deaths in 1990 
and 2017
. These rankings and trends differ for DALYs. In 
1990, the five leading risks for DALYs were child wasting, 
short gestation, low birthweight, smoking, and high 
SBP, whereas in 2017, the leading five risks were high 
SBP, smoking, high FPG, high BMI, and short gestation 
(figure 2A).
Leading risks differ for males and females. For males, 
the leading risks in 2017 were (in order of descending 
rank) smoking, high SBP, high FPG, alcohol use, and 
short gestation; the leading risks for females were high 
SBP, high FPG, high BMI, short gestation, and low 
birthweight. Three of the five leading risks for males 
were behavioural risks, whereas three of the five leading 
risks for females were metabolic risks (figure 2B, C).
DALY-based ranks for all metabolic risks increased 
between 1990 and 2017 for both males and females, 
whereas changes in ranks were more heterogeneous for 
environmental and occupational and behavioural risks. In

1990, six of the ten leading risks were behavioural risks, 
three were environmental, and one was metabolic. Of 
the ten leading risks in 2017 for both sexes, five were 
behavioural, four were metabolic, and only one was 
environ 
mental. Broadly, in terms of their relative impor-
tance, metabolic risks rose in rank whereas environ-
mental and occupational risks fell. Within behavioural 
risks, 13 of the 15 dietary risks increased rank. Appendix 2 
shows trends in leading risk factors within each SDI 
quintile and trends in leading risk factors for deaths and 
DALYs by location.
Drivers of changes in risk-attributable burden
Changes in the absolute number of DALYs over time are 
the result of changes in six underlying components: 
(1) population growth; (2) population ageing; (3) changes 
in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; 
(4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in 
exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all 
other (ie, risk-deleted or residual) factors. Figure 3 shows 
the changes in these components for each Level 1 cause, 
and for all causes combined (for Level 2 causes, see 
appendix 2). Broadly, in the absence of demographic 
changes, changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs 
would have led to a 23·5% decline in DALYs between 2007 
and 2017 in both sexes. Conversely, in the absence of 
changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, 
demographic changes would have led to an 18·6% increase 
in DALYs during that period. Comparing drivers of change 
for males and females, females have generally had greater 
declines in risk exposure: the aggregate effect of changes 
in exposure across all risks would have led to a 6·93% 
decline in DALYs from all causes for males, versus a 9·08% 
decline for females (figure 3).
Of all individual risk categories, changes in exposure 
to behavioural risks have driven the largest change in 
burden: declines in exposure to these risks would have 
resulted in a 7·41% decline in DALYs from all causes in 
both sexes combined. For both males and females, 
changing exposures to behavioural risks drove declines 
for NCDs and CMNNDs and increases for injuries 
(figure 3). Changes in exposure to environmental and 
occupational risks would have resulted a 2·59% decline 
in DALYs from all causes for both sexes, and it is the 
only risk category that was a driver of decline for all 
cause groups and both sexes. Conversely, in the absence 
of changes from other drivers, changes in metabolic 
risks would have resulted in a 2·15% increase in all-
cause DALYs for both sexes.
Among the three cause groups, CMNNDs are the only 
Level 1 cause group for which combined effects of 
improve 
ments in risk exposure and risk-deleted burden 
have outweighed the effects of demographic changes 
for both males and females. Declines in risk exposure 
would have resulted in a 12·0% decline in DALYs 
from CMNNDs among males and a 14·8% decline in 
females. For NCDs, increasing exposure to metabolic 
risks has largely offset health gains from improvements 
in environ 
 
mental and behavioural risks. In aggregate, 
changes in risk exposure would have resulted in a 
2·83% decline in DALYs from NCDs in males and a 
2·29% decline in females. Among both males and 
females, changes in exposure to environ 
mental risks, 
behavioural risks, and all risks combined would have 
resulted in reduced injury burden.
Drivers of changes in risk-attributable DALYs were 
spatially heterogeneous (figure 4). Broadly, population

level, 1990, 2007, and 2017, for both sexes (A), females (B), and males (C)
Risks are connected by lines between time periods; solid lines are increases and 
dashed lines are decreases. Statistically significant increases or decreases are 
shown in bold (p<0·05). DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years. LDL=low-density

Results are shown for all causes combined, CMNNDs, NCDs, and injuries. The black dot on each bar shows total 
percentage change. The risk-deleted DALY rate is the expected DALY rate if the exposure level for all risk factors 
were reduced to the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. Changes in the risk-deleted rate might result from 
changes in risks and risk–outcome pairs that are not currently included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study or changes in other factors such as treatment. The change in CMNNDs and injuries due to 
metabolic risk exposure for both males and females is not zero but is too small to visualise because of the small 
number of risk–outcome pairs. CMNNDs=communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases.

growth has driven increases in risk-attributable DALYs 
across most locations except for Eastern Europe, Cuba, 
Greenland, Guyana, Japan, and Portugal. Population 
ageing has driven increases in most locations, with notable 
exceptions in central, eastern, and western sub-Saharan 
Africa, and parts of the Middle East and south and southeast 
Asia. Conversely, all-cause risk-deleted DALY rates have 
declined across most locations; however, they have 
increased in a number of subnational locations in Brazil, 
China, the UK, India, Mexico, and the USA. Broadly, 
DALYs attributable to metabolic risk exposure have 
increased in most locations and DALYs attributable to 
environmental and occupational and behavioural risks 
have largely declined.
Observed versus expected summary exposure values
Estimating the expected SEV for a given risk factor at a 
given level of SDI, a comparison can be made between 
observed exposure levels in a given place and time and 
their expected levels based on SDI. An observed to 
expected ratio (O/E ratio) of 1·0 indicates that observed 
exposure levels equal our expectation; O/E ratios less 
than 1·0 indicate that observed exposures are better than 
expected (ie, at levels associated with lower risk); 
and O/E ratios greater than 1·0 indicate that observed 
exposures are worse than expected (ie, at levels associated 
with greater risk).
Across leading environmental risks, O/E ratios for 
ambient particulate matter pollution showed no 
consistent trends across regions, whereas there were 
nearly univer 
sal increases in O/E ratios for household air 
pollution and unsafe water (figure 5A). In 2017, O/E ratios 
for ambient particulate matter pollution were notably 
high in north Africa and Middle East (2·03) and south 
Asia (1·81). O/E ratios for household air pollution were 
notably high in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania 
(3·05) and central Europe, eastern Europe, and central 
Asia (1·73). Between 1990 and 2017, O/ E ratios for unsafe 
water increased across all super-regions, with the largest 
changes in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (85·6% 
increase; ratio of 1·75 in 2017), north Africa and Middle 
East (57·8% increase; ratio of 1·02 in 2017), and south 
Asia (55·5% increase; ratio of 1·41 in 2017).
Among the leading behavioural risks between 1990 
and 2017, there were near universal declines in O/E ratios 
for both smoking and alcohol use, and incon 
sistent 
trends in O/E ratios for low birthweight (figure 5B). 
The range of O/E ratios between regions is especially 
broad for alcohol use. These ratios were consis 
tently 
high in sub-Saharan Africa (O/E ratios declined from 
2·10 to 1·49 between 1990 and 2017), Latin America and 
the Caribbean (ratios declined from 1·83 to 1·54), and 
central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia (ratios 
declined from 1·82 to 1·68). O/E ratios for alcohol use 
were consistently the lowest in north Africa and the 
Middle East, declining from 0·38 to 0·21 between 1990 
and 2017
.
Trends in O/E ratios for leading metabolic risks 
were hetero 
geneous across super-regions (figure 5C). 
For high SBP, O/E ratios improved by more than 5% 
between 1990 and 2017 for two super-regions: 27·1% 
decrease in the high-income region and 8·05% in the 
central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia region. 
By contrast, ratios for high SBP increased by more than 
5% in three super-regions: 22·0% in sub-Saharan 
Africa, 16·4% in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, 
and 9·67% in south Asia. In 2017, ratios for high SBP 
were highest in sub-Saharan Africa (1·19) and central 
Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia (1·19) and 
were lowest in the high-income region (0·77). O/E 
ratios increased for both high FPG and high BMI across 
all super-regions between 1990 and 2017
. The north 
Africa and Middle East region stands out as having the 
highest O/E ratios for both high FPG and high BMI 
across many years.
Expected attributable burden
Broadly, total expected risk-attributable burden declines 
with increasing SDI (figure 6). At an SDI of 0·1, we 
expect 101 000 risk-attributable DALYs per 100 000 males 
and 90 600 per 100 000 females; at an SDI of 0·5, we 
expect 20 200 per 100 000 males and 16 300 per 
100 000 females; and at an SDI of 0·9, we expect 
15 900 per 100 000 among males and 9640 per 100 000 
among females.
Increasing SDI was associated with dramatic declines 
in the expected burden attributable to environmental 
risks in both sexes: the expected burden attributable to 
environ 
mental risks declines from 41 600 DALYs 
per 100 000 people (31·6% of total burden) with an SDI of 
0·1 to 1870 DALYs per 100 000 people (10·6% of total 
burden) with an SDI of 0·9. The pat 
tern for behavioural 
risks was more complex and heterogeneous. Although 
the expected burden attribu 
table to malnutrition declined 
with increasing SDI, the expected burden attributable to 
tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use, and most dietary risks 
generally increased with increasing SDI. At an SDI value 
of 0·1, behavioural risks accounted for 65·0% of the total 
expected risk-attributable burden, at an SDI of 0·75 they 
accounted for 51·5%, and at an SDI of 0·9 they accounted

risk-deleted DALY rates (C), changes in exposure to environmental and

and changes in exposure to metabolic risk factors (F). The risk-deleted DALY rate 
is the expected DALY rate if the exposure level for all risk factors were reduced to 
the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. Changes in the risk-deleted rate 
might result from changes in risks and risk–outcome pairs not included in the

for 52·9%. The expected burden attributable to metabolic 
risks increased with increasing SDI up to an SDI of 0·65, 
then declines with increasing SDI above that level. At an 
SDI value of 0·1, metabolic risks accounted for 3·44% of 
the total expected risk-attributable burden, at an SDI of 
0·75 they accounted for 37·6%, and at an SDI of 0·9 they 
accounted for 36·4%.
Observed versus expected attributable burden
In males, the two leading risk factors were smoking and 
high SBP (in varying order) in four of the seven super-
regions (figure 7; appendix 2). The three exceptions were 
sub-Saharan Africa (unsafe sex was the leading risk with 
an O/E ratio of 14·9 followed by child wasting with a ratio 
of 0·71), Latin American and the Caribbean (alcohol use 
with a ratio of 1·19 then high FPG with a ratio of 0·78), 
and the high-income super-region (smoking with a ratio 
of 0·65 then high BMI with a ratio of 0·83). In females, 
the leading risk factors were either high BMI or high 
SBP in four of the seven super-regions (figure 7; 
appendix 2). The three exceptions were sub-Saharan 
Africa (as for males, unsafe sex was the leading risk 
among females, with an O/E ratio of 5·51, followed by 
child wasting with a ratio of 0·63), south Asia (short 
gestation with a ratio of 0·79, followed by high SBP with 
a ratio of 0·79), and the high-income super-region 
(smoking with a ratio of 0·98 followed by high BMI 
with a ratio of 0·91). High FPG was the second leading

risk factor in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania 
(O/E ratio of 0·78) and Latin America and the Caribbean 
(O/E ratio of 0·84) for females. Notably, the O/E ratios 
exceed one for all five leading risk factors for males for 
the central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia 
regions, and for nearly all countries within those regions.
The highest O/E ratios for environmental and occu-
pational risks were in southern sub-Saharan Africa and 
south Asia, driven largely by air pollution and unsafe 
water, sanitation, and handwashing in both regions 
(figure 8). For behavioural risks, high O/E ratios were 
recorded in southern sub-Saharan Africa, driven largely 
by higher than expected unsafe sex and intimate partner 
violence, and eastern Europe, largely due to higher than 
expected alcohol and drug use. The burden attributable 
to metabolic risks was higher than expected in Oceania 
and much of the central Europe, eastern Europe, and 
central Asia super-region.
New risks, leading risks, and risks with significant 
changes in GBD 2017
Globally, bullying victimisation is the leading risk factor 
for mental disorder DALYs in 2017 (other risks factors are 
lead exposure, intimate partner violence, and childhood 
sexual abuse) and the 35th leading risk factor of all 
54 risks for all NCDs. However, for major depressive 
disorder, bullying accounts for fewer DALYs than 
childhood sexual abuse or intimate partner violence. In 
2017, 2·57 million (95% UI 1·54–3·97) DALYs were 
attributable to bullying victim 
isation, by peers, of 
children and adolescents attending school. This was 
distributed relatively evenly between anxiety disorders 
(1·36 million DALYs [0·81–2·13]) and major depressive 
disorder (1·21 million DALYs [0·69–1·94]). Globally, 
bullying victimisation accounted for 5·01% (3·40–6·83) 
of all anxiety disorder DALYs and 3·68% (2·37–5·21) of 
all major depressive disorder DALYs.
In 2017, high SBP was the leading risk factor globally, 
accounting for 10·4 million (95% UI 9·39–11·5) deaths 
and 218 million (198–237) DALYs. Overall, 8·74% 
(7·78–9·68) of total DALYs were attributable to high SBP. 
Most of the burden attributable to high SBP was due to 
ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and high SBP 
accounted for 55·7% (48·1–63·1) of DALYs due to 
ischaemic heart disease and 57·1% (49·4–63·8) of DALYs 
due to stroke. Globally, age-standardised DALY rates 
attributable to high SBP declined between 1990 and 2017 
(25·8% decrease [24·3–27·5]). Notable declines occurred 
in the high-income (54·5% [53·1–56·0] decline), north 
Africa and Middle East (32·6% [28·7–35·7]), and Latin 
America and Caribbean (32·4% [30·7–34·1]) super-
regions.
In 2017, smoking was the second leading risk for both 
deaths and DALYs. It was responsible for 7·10 million 
(95% UI 6·83–7·37) deaths (12·7% [12·2–13·2] of all 
deaths globally) and accounted for 182 million (173–193) 
DALYs (7·31% [6·81–7·80] of all DALYs globally). 
Although smoking-attributable age-standardised mort-
ality rates declined 38·2% (36·4–40·0) between 1990 and 
2017, the total number of smoking-attributable deaths 
has increased by 24·9% (21·3–28·6). In 2017, smoking 
accounted for a larger proportion of deaths among men

Stacked curves show males (left) and females (right) after adjusting for mediation, scaling to account for overlapping risks, and aggregating so that total expected 
DALY rates reflect the true all-cause total expected DALY rates attributable to all risk factors. The y-axis shows lowest SDI (0·09) to highest SDI (0·92) for all 
GBD countries and territories, 1990–2017. Coloured regions are the proportion of the total attributable DALY rate corresponding to that risk factor.

in high-middle SDI countries (27·1% [26·3–27·9]) than 
in low SDI countries (10·2% [9·23–11·0]; appendix 2). 
Between 1990 and 2017, among men, the percentage of 
all-cause all-age deaths attributable to smoking in high 
SDI countries decreased, whereas it increased in all other 
SDI groups. Levels and trends in smoking prevalence 
and attributable burden vary by gender. As a risk factor 
for all-cause all-age deaths, smoking ranks first among 
men and eighth among women, reflecting both the lower 
prevalence and lower intensity of smoking among 
women. In 2017, the four Level 3 causes with the largest 
number of deaths attributable to smoking were ischaemic 
heart disease (1·62 million [1·54–1·69] deaths), COPD 
(1·23 million [1·12–1·35] deaths), tracheal, bronchus, 
and lung cancer (1·19 million [1·15–1·23] deaths), and 
stroke (887 000 [833 000–944 000] deaths), and together 
account for 69·4% of total smoking-attributable deaths 
(table 3). For lung cancer and COPD, changing from

indirect estimation using the smoking impact ratio to 
direct estimation using measures of cumulative lifetime 
exposure resulted in large changes in smoking-
attributable burden estimates in countries with scarce or 
low-quality data on lung cancer mortality. At the all-cause 
level, using measures of continuous and cumulative 
exposure that take into account risk among former 
and occasional smokers has resulted in increases in 
attributable burden in 71·8% of countries compared with 
previously published estimates.
In 2017, low birthweight and short gestation was the 
third leading Level 3 risk factor globally for all-age 
DALYs. Age-standardised DALY rates attributable to 
this risk declined from 4558 (95% UI 4347–4739) DALYs 
per 100 000 in 1990 to 2680 (2543–2812) DALYs per 
100 000 in 2017
. Although exposure to low birthweight 
and short gestation decreased globally between 1990 
and 2017, most of the declines in risk-attributable 
burden came from declines in mortality from causes 
attributable to this risk. For low birthweight, the biggest 
improvements in risk-attributable mortality were in 
Saudi Arabia, Maldives, and Singapore (appendix 2). 
Increasing SDI was associated with decreasing 
exposure and decreasing attributable burden. Exposure 
and attributable burden were highest in eastern, 
central, and western sub-Saharan Africa. For short 
gestation, the biggest improve 
ments were in Saudi 
Arabia, Maldives, and Turkey. Similar to low birthweight 
trends, increasing SDI was associated with a decrease 
in exposure, as well as a decrease in attributable burden. 
Exposure and attribut 
able burden were highest in south 
Asia and eastern, central, and western sub-Saharan 
Africa.
High BMI accounted for 4·72 million (95% UI 
2·99–6·70) deaths and 148 million (98·6–202) DALYs 
globally in 2017 (table 3). It ranked fourth among risk 
factors for mortality, primarily due to the effect of high 
BMI on cardiovascular disease. Globally, the SEV for high 
BMI for both sexes has increased 70·4% (57·1–84·5) 
since 1990 (table 2), and trends among children suggest 
that this will continue to rise. The resulting disease 
burden is large and increasing, with the absolute number 
of DALYs attributable to high BMI increasing by 36·7% 
(31·5–44·5) between 2007 and 2017 and by 127% 
(99·5–172) between 1990 and 2017, and age-standardised 
DALY rates attributable to high BMI increasing 6·84% 
(2·60–13·0) between 2007 and 2017 and 19·3% 
(4·83–43·2) between 1990 and 2017
. In 2017, high BMI was 
the leading cause of premature mortality, as measured by 
YLLs, in seven countries and territories: Ecuador, Peru,

Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and 
American Samoa. Among risk factors assessed in GBD 
2017, BMI prevalence continues to have one of the highest 
rates of increase over time. Trends in BMI prevalence and 
burden exhibit marked geographical variation, with the 
highest levels among wealthier countries.
Globally, high FPG was the third leading risk factor for 
both mortality and DALYs in 2017, accounting for 
6·53 million (95% UI 5·23–8·23) deaths and 171 million 
(144–201) DALYs. Cardio 
vascular disease was the leading 
Level 2 cause of death due to high FPG, accounting for 
54·5% of deaths attributed to the risk. Diabetes and 
kidney diseases was the second ranking Level 2 cause of 
disability attributable to high FPG and accounted for 
51·9% of DALYs attributable to this risk.
In 2017, 5·25% (95% UI 4·49–6·01) of all deaths were 
attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution, 
making it the eighth leading risk for deaths, with a total 
of 2·94 million (2·50–3·36) deaths globally, and 
1·05 million (0·88–1·22) deaths in southeast Asia, east 
Asia, and Oceania. It has increased from 15th leading 
risk for deaths in 1990, with 1·75 million (1·48–2·03) 
deaths, with a percentage change of 67·7% (56·6–79·3). 
It is among the top ten ranked Level 4 risk factors for 
deaths in 95 of the 195 countries and territories for which 
we produce estimates. Mortality rates attributable to 
ambient particulate matter pollution are notably high in 
Bahrain (11·9% [10·2–13·3] of all deaths were attributable 
to ambient particulate matter; fourth leading risk factor 
for deaths), Egypt (11·8% [9·07–14·4]; sixth leading risk 
factor), and Kuwait (10·6% [8·94–12·3]; sixth leading risk 
factor). The Level 3 causes with the largest proportion of 
burden attributable to ambient particulate matter 
pollution are COPD and lower respiratory infection: 
ambient particulate matter is responsible for 19·3% 
(12·6–25·4) of all COPD DALYs, 17·4% (13·7–21·6) of all 
lower respiratory infection DALYs, and 17·5% (13·2–22·7) 
of lower respiratory infection DALYs in children younger 
than 5 years. In GBD 2017, we added type 2 diabetes as 
an outcome of ambient particulate matter pollution, 
which contributes 10·5 million (6·70–13·9) or 12·6% of 
the 83·0 million (71·4–94·3) DALYs attributable to 
ambient particulate matter pollution in 2017 (table 3).
In 2017, 4·32 million (95% UI 3·33–5·44) deaths and 
94·9 million (78·8–112) DALYs were attributable to high 
LDL cholesterol. Overall, 3·80% (3·14–4·56) of total 
DALYs were attributable to high LDL cholesterol. The age-
standardised DALY rate in males (1480 per 100 000 
[1230–1750]) was higher than in females (880 per 100 000 
[714–1070]). Globally, between 1990 and 2017, age-
standardised DALY rates declined markedly (29·9% 
[28·1–31·7] decline). Notable reductions in age-stan-
dardised DALY rates occurred in both the high-income 
(61·8% [60·4–63·2] decline) and Latin America and 
Caribbean super-regions (40·7% [38·9–42·5] decline).
Globally in 2017, dietary risks were the leading Level 2 
risk factor for deaths and the second leading Level 2 risk 
factor for DALYs, accounting for 10·9 million (95% UI 
10·1–11·7) deaths and 255 million (234–274) DALYs 
(table 3). Among dietary factors, high intake of sodium 
was the leading risk for mortality, accounting for 
3·20 million (1·42–5·45) deaths. Low intake of whole 
grains was the leading risk factor for DALYs, accounting 
for 82·5 million (59·0–109) DALYs. Diet with high sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption continues to show a 
marked increasing trend in overall attributable burden, 
with SEVs for this risk increasing 12·1% (7·02–18·2) 
between 2007 and 2017 and 17·1% (8·34–28·0) since 1990 
(table 2).
Discussion
General findings
We estimated the burden of disease attributable to 
84 metabolic, environmental and occupational, and 
behavioural risk factors or clusters of risks from 1990 to 
2017 in 195 countries and territories, based on 46 749 data 
sources. In 2017, all included risks combined contributed 
to 61·0% (95% UI 59·6–62·4) of deaths and 48·3% 
(46·3–50·2) of DALYs worldwide, compared with 61·4% 
(59·9–62·7) of deaths and 52·4% (50·4–54·5) of DALYs 
in 1990. With each iteration of GBD, including GBD 2017, 
an increasing proportion of burden of disease has been 
attributed to risk factors. The contributions of risk factors 
to total deaths in the year 2010 (the most recent year for 
which we have comparable estimates from the most GBD 
iterations) were estimated to be 55·7% in GBD 2013, 
57·3% in GBD 2015, 60·2% in GBD 2016, and 61·3% in 
GBD 2017
. Similarly, in 2010, the contribution of risk 
factors to DALYs was 40·4% in GBD 2013, 41·5% in 2015, 
46·5% in 2016, and 49·5% in 2017
. This increase stems 
from the growing collection of risk–outcome pairs 
included in each iteration. With the addition of new risk 
factors and new risk–outcome pairs, future iterations of 
the GBD study should explain an increasing portion of 
the remaining unattributed burden of disease.
The role of changes in risk factors in explaining 
changes in deaths and DALYs varies considerably across 
causes and ages. Since 1990, in the 64 individual or 
Level 4 risks, exposure levels increased significantly for 
20 risks, did not change significantly for 14 risks, and 
decreased significantly for 31 risks. The risks with the 
highest increases in SEVs globally include high BMI, 
ambient particulate matter pollution, and high FPG; the 
risks with the largest decreases in exposure are unsafe 
sanitation, diet high in trans fatty acids, and household 
air pollution. These trends are consistent with what are 
expected with socioeconomic development.
We found considerable heterogeneity across super-
regions in the leading risk factors. Some notable patterns 
are the role of unsafe sexual practices as a driver of the 
HIV
/AIDS epidemic in eastern and southern sub-
Saharan Africa and the role of alcohol consumption in 
eastern Europe and central Asia. There are also marked 
spatial patterns for other risks such as high BMI in 
 Global Health Metrics

central America, north Africa and the Middle East, and 
Oceania. Interpretation of spatial patterns needs to take 
into account the fact that some risks have a strong 
relation 
ship with socioeconomic development. The 
numbers of some environmental and behavioural risks, 
including unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing, 
household air pollution, and childhood growth failure, 
decrease rapidly with increased development. Other risks 
tend to increase with development, including high BMI, 
high SBP, red meat consumption, high sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption, and drug and alcohol use.
Risk exposure and socioeconomic development
Risks form clusters with regard to the nature of their 
association with development. In this regard, we 
observe four categories of risks as follows: (1) risks 
positively associated with SDI; (2) risks negatively 
associated with SDI; (3) risks with clear, but non-
monotonic associations with SDI; and (4) risks that 
show little association with SDI.
The category of risks that are positively associated with 
SDI includes smoking, high BMI, alcohol use, and high 
LDL cholesterol. This category includes predominately 
behavioural and meta 
bolic risks that are associated with 
NCDs. The category of risks that are negatively associated 
with SDI includes child wasting, unsafe water source, 
diet low in fruits, household air pollution, unsafe 
sanitation, and no access to handwashing facility. This 
category includes pre 
dominately environmental and 
behavioural risks that are associated with CMNNDs. The 
category of risks that have non-monotonic associations 
with SDI includes high FPG and ambient particulate 
matter pollution, which both follow an inverted U-shaped 
association with develop 
ment, and low birthweight, 
which has a U-shaped association with development. 
The category of risks showing little association with SDI 
includes high SBP and diet low in whole grains.
Notably, for some risks, the trends of O/E ratios and 
SEVs are in opposite directions. For example, O/E ratios 
for household air pollution and unsafe water increased 
between 1990 and 2017, indicating that, for a given level of 
SDI, exposure levels have increased during that period. 
Conversely, SEVs for those risks declined during the 
same period. Thus, although exposure to these risks is 
broadly improving with socioeconomic development and 
time, improvements in development are occurring more 
rapidly than are improvements in the underlying risk 
structure in a population. For other risks, SEVs show 
temporal trends that run counter to trends expected on 
the basis of SDI. For example, although SDI was strongly 
positively associated with smoking, both SEVs and 
O/E ratios for smoking have declined despite concurrent 
increases in SDI. The marked declines in O/E ratios for 
smoking across all super-regions again suggest that the 
expected increase in smoking has not been fully realised 
with increasing SDI. In the case of smoking, the declining 
O/E ratios probably reflect benefits of smoking-reduction 
policies.16 Similarly, alcohol use was strongly positively 
associated with SDI, and trends in alcohol use SEVs did 
not change greatly, resulting in reductions in O/E ratios 
for alcohol use in all super-regions except south Asia.
Risk exposure and sex
In addition to spatiotemporal variation in risk exposure, 
there were important differences between males and 
females within a given location. Females had notably 
higher SEVs for household air pollution, second-hand 
smoke, low bone mineral density, and diet low in fibre, 
legumes, calcium, and vegetables; whereas males had 
notably higher SEVs for lead exposure, smoking, alcohol 
use, ambient particulate matter pollution, red meat 
consumption, and most occupational risks.
For smoking, SEVs were higher for males than for 
females at all SDI levels, and, for both sexes, SEVs 
increased with increasing SDI. However, although 
smoking SEVs for males increase nearly linearly with 
SDI, smoking SEVs for females remain very low at lower 
SDI, and then increase rapidly between SDI values of 0·6 
and 0·9. This suggests that smoking interventions that 
target males might be most effective in lower SDI set-
tings, whereas interventions in higher SDI settings 
should target males and females more equally. Similarly, 
alcohol use remains low among females across lower 
and middle SDI levels but increases with SDI at higher 
SDI levels, suggesting that interventions should target 
males in low to middle SDI settings, but be targeted 
more broadly in higher SDI settings.
SEVs for high BMI increased for both sexes between 
1990 and 2007, 2007 and 2017, and 1990 and 2017
. 
Although this increase continues for males across the 
entire range of SDI, the increase for females slows and 
the curve flattens at an SDI of 0·66. Consequently, 
although females have higher BMI SEVs than males at 
low and middle SDI, they have lower SEVs than males at 
high SDI. Similarly, there was a crossover in sex 
differences for high SBP. Although high SBP SEVs for 
females decline slightly with SDI, they increase slightly 
with SDI for males. Consequently, expected SBP SEVs 
are lower for males than for females where SDI is 0·36 
or below, and they are higher for males than for females 
where SDI is greater than 0·36.
Cross-cutting themes
The number of all-cause DALYs declined for both males 
and females between 2007 and 2017, because the effects of 
improvements in both risk exposures and risk-deleted 
DALY rates have outpaced the opposing effects of 
population growth and ageing. Decreases in risk-deleted 
DALY rates are probably a function of improvements in 
treatments and improvements in risk factors that are not 
captured in the GBD analysis, as well as uncaptured 
social, cultural, and economic factors. Although changes 
in environmental and occupational and behavioural risks 
have driven declines in all-cause DALYs, increasing 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018 
1977
exposure to metabolic risks has had the opposite effect. 
This pattern is remarkably consistent across geographies. 
Consequently, increasing exposure to metabolic risks 
stands as one of the key drivers of increasing DALYs from 
NCDs. Although concerns about NCD burden have 
historically focused on high-income countries, previous 
iterations of the GBD study, as well as other studies, have 
clearly shown the large and growing problem of NCDs in 
low-income and middle-income settings.4,17 Similarly, 
although metabolic risk factors such as high LDL 
cholesterol, high SBP, and high BMI have historically 
been viewed mostly as challenges in high-income settings, 
these key metabolic risk factors are now commonly 
increased even in low-income settings. Between 1990 and 
2017, 47 countries and territories had greater than 100% 
increases in SEVs for high BMI and, of these, 37 (79%) 
had an SDI that was less than the median value in 1990. 
Although these increases have occurred in connection 
with increasing SDI, increasing O/E ratios show that 
trends in these metabolic risks are outpacing the 
expectations based on development.
High LDL cholesterol and high SBP are among the 
leading risk factors for all-cause risk-attributable burden in 
2017
. Both are commonly increased even in low-resource 
settings, and both are increased by obesity. Although both 
are also easily reduced or treated with inexpensive and 
cost-effective medications, these treatments remain inac-
cessible to broad segments of the world’s population.18 
Growing evidence from studies such as the SimCard Trial19 
in rural India and China suggests that effective methods 
exist to deliver these kinds of important pharmacotherapy, 
even in the most resource-limited locations. A 2018 trial 
of a fixed low-dose triple-combi 
nation antihypertensive 
drug tested in urban Sri Lanka, consisting of amlodipine, 
telmisartan, and chlorthali 
done, showed substantial im-
prove 
ment in control of blood pressure compared with 
usual care at 6 months, and no difference in adverse 
events.20 Another trial from 2016 showed that lowering 
LDL cholesterol with a high-potency statin was effective 
even among individuals only at intermediate risk of 
cardiovascular events.21 Efforts to improve universal health 
coverage must directly address how these therapies can be 
delivered even more effectively. Studies have further 
identified public health interventions that are cost-effective 
outside of high-income settings. Legislative interventions 
targeting sodium and trans fat, improve 
ments in food 
labelling and advertising, and health-focused and diet-
focused media campaigns are cost-effective interventions 
in south Asia, for example.22 Fortunately, philanthropic 
donors are beginning to identify cardiovascular risk as an 
important target for improving global health.23
O/E ratios offer a useful benchmarking tool for national 
policy makers who are hoping to compare the risk 
exposure against an empirical standard for countries at 
a given level of development. Although the burden 
attributable to a given risk indicates the risks for which 
exposure reduction can offer the greatest health gains, 
O/E ratios offer insight into what might be achievable 
given the resource constraints that exist at a certain level 
of development. For example, in the southeast Asia, 
east Asia, and Oceania super-region, high SBP and high 
FPG are among the leading risks, but both have SEV 
O/E ratios below 1·0. This suggests that, despite the 
high risk-attributable burden, the countries in this 
super-region show better than expected performance in 
managing exposure to these risks. Conversely, ambient 
particulate matter pollution and household air pollution 
are the tenth and 15th leading risks in the super-region, 
but the corresponding SEV O/E ratios are 1·32 and 3·05, 
suggesting that the countries in the super-region have 
greater exposure to these risks than other countries at 
similar levels of development. The degree of under-
performance suggests that gains in managing these risks 
might be more easily achieved than would be gains from 
risks in which the super-region is already outperforming 
its peers.
Important changes in GBD 2017 compared with 
GBD 2016
GBD 2017 marks the first time that bullying victimisation 
by peers of children and adolescents attending school 
has been included as a risk factor. It is one of only 
three psychosocial risk factors to be included in GBD, 
one of only two risk factors for major depressive disorder, 
and the first-ever risk factor for anxiety disorders in 
GBD. The substantial proportion of major depressive 
disorder and anxiety disorder YLDs attributable to 
bullying victimisation highlights the importance of 
considering psychosocial risk factors when assessing 
health outcomes. The small number of risk factors for 
mental disorders has been an ongoing criticism of GBD, 
especially considering that mental disorders are a leading 
cause of disability worldwide.24 GBD estimates suggest 
that the prevalence of mental disorders has changed little 
in the past few decades despite growing recognition of 
the associated burden. Psychosocial risk factors can be 
challenging to assess and quantify, which in turn can 
make them easy to overlook. However, bullying 
victimisation has an operationalised definition, can be 
measured in population surveys, and is consistently 
associated with risk of mental disorders.25,26 Scientifically 
assessed school-based interventions that address bully-
ing show positive programme effects.27 A reduction in 
the prevalence of bullying victimisation could help 
reduce the prevalence, and therefore burden, of major 
depressive disorder and anxiety disorders later in life. 
Crucially, the inclusion of bullying victimisation as a risk 
factor in GBD might motivate investment in intervention 
pro 
gram 
mes to reduce bullying. The inclusion of 
bullying victimisation in GBD also shows the importance 
of integrating cross-disciplinary research in the identi-
fication of the complex aetiology of mental disorders.
Using continuous and cumulative measures of 
smoking, which capture both former and occasional 
 Global Health Metrics
1978 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
smokers, has shown that the burden of smoking is 
higher than previously thought. The implications of the 
new methods on attributable burden varies across out-
comes and locations. For 71·8% of countries, the burden 
attributable to smoking has increased as a result of 
the new methods. For the largest causes of burden 
(ischaemic heart disease, COPD, lung cancer, and stroke) 
there are differential trends across countries and by sex. 
By quantifying this dose-response relationship, we are 
able to highlight the potential health benefits of policies 
and programmes that reduce smoking. We have also 
produced a globally complete time series of estimates for 
age of initiation that shows that the average age of 
initiation has changed little across time, even in locations 
with strong and successful tobacco control. Targeting 
interventions to reduce the initiation rate in the critical 
age window of 13–23 years will yield substantial health 
benefits.28 Finally, the concept of capturing exposure over 
an individual’s life course can and should be extended to 
other risk factors, for which the health effects are 
probably the result of cumulative exposure.
Comparison of GBD 2017 to other estimates
The GBD study is the most comprehensive population-
level CRA across countries and risks. For several risks, 
including ambient particulate matter pollution, house-
hold air pollution,29 intimate partner violence,30 unsafe 
water source,31,32 breastfeeding,33 and lead exposure,34 GBD 
estimates are generally lower than published WHO 
estimates.30–32,34,35 These discrepancies can be attributed to 
different definitions, methods, granularity, and input 
data. For some findings, annual estimates might disagree, 
but regional patterns are consistent between WHO and 
GBD. UNICEF produces estimates for child stunting36 
that are lower than GBD estimates, with some dis-
agreement in which locations progress has been made. 
There is more consistency in estimates between UNICEF 
and GBD for child wasting and child underweight.36 GBD 
estimates for the prevalence of low birthweight and short 
gestation are slightly lower than the WHO estimates but 
show similar geographical patterns.37 Scientific literature 
reveals similar results to GBD for impaired kidney 
function38 and low birthweight and short gestation.39 
Research published on iron-deficiency anaemia40 differs 
from GBD in methods and definitions, resulting in 
generally higher GBD estimates. GBD estimates were 
much lower than published research on occupational 
estimates,41–43 largely because of different cause–outcome 
pairs and GBD’s application of the CRA approach.
Improvements in our smoking estimation methods 
have resulted in higher estimates of smoking-attributable 
burden. Although smoking estimates from previous 
iterations of the GBD study were slightly lower than 
those published by WHO,35 our GBD 2017 estimates 
show marked similarities. Among the 142 countries and 
territories included in the WHO report and estimated in 
GBD, the correlation coefficient for 2017 smoking 
prevalence estimates for females was 0·91 and for males 
was 0·85. Where estimates diverge, these differences 
can be attributed to differing modelling methods or data 
sources. For example, the WHO model was fit on 
1175 country-year data sources whereas the GBD model 
was fit on 2870 country-year data sources.
Future directions
As with previous iterations of GBD, we have continued 
to use the World Cancer Research Fund criteria of 
convincing or probable evidence as the threshold for 
including a risk–outcome pair in GBD 2017
.44 The 
subjectivity of some aspects of these definitions might 
result in differing interpretations of the available evi-
dence and different conclusions about the strength of the 
evidence supporting the inclusion of a given risk–
outcome pair. Moving toward more objective and quanti-
fiable criteria could help reconcile these different 
interpretations. Quantifiable criteria would also permit 
simplified evidence scores that could help policy makers 
who, faced with scarce resources, might choose to 
prioritise interventions that address risks supported by 
the strongest evidence base. Objective and quantifiable 
criteria would facilitate such comparisons, allowing 
stakeholders to more easily understand the variable 
strength of evidence supporting the causal connection 
for each risk–outcome pair. In an effort to summarise the 
evidence base for each risk–outcome pair in GBD 2017, 
we present the number of studies that are available, 
by type of study design. However, we recognise that 
quantifying the strength of evidence requires moving 
beyond simple quantification of the number of studies. 
To that end, we have begun to extract detailed information 
from all 3638 studies used across risk–outcome pairs. 
This effort includes details about study design, the 
study population and sampling, exposure measurement, 
outcome assessment, potential sources of bias and 
confounding, and analytic efforts to address bias and 
confounding. With this information, we can system-
atically analyse the degree to which different study 
limitations affect the resulting strength of associations, 
allowing us to objectively assess study quality. Looking at 
the studies for a given risk–outcome pair, we can then 
calculate an objective evidence score based on the 
number and quality of the supporting studies, and the 
potential for publication bias. Such a score would 
facilitate evidence-based decision making in the face of 
scarce political and financial resources, allowing 
attention to be focused on risks with both the greatest 
attributable burden and strongest supporting evidence.
The inclusion of bullying as a new risk in GBD 2017 
suggests potential areas for future work. We hope that 
its inclusion will help in setting a higher standard of 
measure 
ment in future research on both the occurrence 
and health effects of bullying. It also provides a starting 
point for including additional risk factors related to 
violence against children, such as non-sexual forms of 
 Global Health Metrics

1979
child abuse in addition to childhood sexual abuse, which 
is the only GBD 2017 risk factor pertaining to child 
maltreatment.
A growing body of research has shown direct 
connections between ambient temperature and health 
outcomes. For example, the Multicountry Observational 
Study,45 the largest study of all-cause mortality risk 
and ambient temperature to date, estimated that 7·71% 
(95% CI 7·43–7·91) of deaths were attributable to 
suboptimal ambient temperature: 7·29% (7·02–7·49) of 
deaths were attributable to low ambient temperatures 
and 0·42% (0·39–0·44) were attributable to high 
temperatures. The growing evidence base, especially in 
the context of global concerns about the potential health 
effects of climate change, makes the inclusion of 
meteorological risk factors a priority for future iterations 
of GBD. We have already begun work to estimate the 
cause-specific burden directly attributable to effects of 
ambient temperature, with plans to include suboptimal 
ambient temperature as a risk in future estimations of 
GBD. The inclusion of exposure to suboptimal tem-
perature is intended also to lay the groundwork for 
exploring other components of weather and climate in 
future GBD analyses.
Limitations
A study of this scope has many limitations. The new 
proportional PAF strategy that we have implemented for 
particulate matter pollution reflects a broader challenge 
with disentangling inherently connected risks with non-
linear relationships between exposure and disease risk. 
In the case of particulate matter pollution, risk for a given 
outcome rises sharply with increased exposure at the low 
end of the exposure range, and the marginal increase in 
risk declines as the risk curve flattens at the upper end 
of the exposure range. Two risks compose particulate 
matter pollution: ambient particulate matter pollution 
and household air pollution. If exposure to each of these 
two sources were sequentially reduced to the TMREL, the 
reduction in burden per µg/m3 reduction in exposure for 
whichever source is removed first will be less than the 
reduction for the source that is removed second. This 
occurs because, for the first source, the exposure 
reduction occurs where the risk curve is flatter, whereas 
for the second source, exposure reduction occurs where 
the risk curve is steeper. No clear solution to this problem 
that does not raise a new problem exists within the CRA 
framework. Treating each exposure in isolation, as we 
did in previous GBD iterations, results in overestimates 
of attributable burden, because both risks will have their 
burden estimated from the steepest part of the risk curve. 
Considering both exposures together and treating each 
exposure as the first to be removed, in line with the CRA 
approach, results in underestimates of risk, because both 
risks will have their burden estimated from the flattest 
part of the risk curve. We have chosen instead to estimate 
burden for total particulate matter pollution and divide 
this total burden proportionately between the two 
sources. This accurately captures burden but deviates 
somewhat from the CRA approach. The challenge 
extends beyond ambient and household particulates. 
Smoking and second-hand smoke are additional sources 
of particulate matter exposure that we have not yet 
incorporated into our proportional burden strategy. This 
is a limitation of the CRA approach, and other areas 
probably have similar challenges with non-linear and 
inherently connected risks that have not yet been 
identified and corrected.
Bullying is characterised by intention to harm, a power 
imbalance, and repetition; however, studies vary greatly 
with regard to how they specifically define these criteria. 
For example, we were unable to include many studies 
where the threshold for repetition was either insuf-
ficiently specific or not reported. Second, the relative risk 
data used in the calculation of PAFs were only from high-
income countries. The magnitude of the association 
between bullying victimisation and outcomes might 
differ between high-income countries and low-income 
and middle-income countries.
Our updated continuous measures of smoking better 
capture true risk, but also introduce new challenges. 
First, because of data limitations, we assume the risk of 
all smoked tobacco products is equivalent to the risk 
of cigarettes. Second, smoking histories were recon-
structed on the basis of cross-sectional survey data, not 
longitudinal data. Third, we were not able to effectively 
adjust for illicit tobacco in our estimates of supply-side 
consumption. Fourth, we have not incorporated the 
effects of tobacco-control policies on various exposures. 
Consequently, if no survey data are collected after 
implementation of a tobacco-control policy, the impact of 
that policy will not be reflected in the modelled estimates. 
Fifth, insufficient evidence is available to estimate risk-
reduction curves for individuals with different smoking 
histories, so the rate of risk reduction has been assumed 
to be the same for all levels of exposure. Sixth, we 
recognise that our exposure definitions are summaries of 
an individual’s smoking history, and that more nuanced 
exposure definitions might perform better for individual-
level risk prediction.
Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive and comparable 
assessment of 84 environmental and occupational, 
behavioural, and metabolic risks across locations and 
time. By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to 
risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this 
assessment offers insights into past programme and 
policy successes and highlights the current priorities for 
public health action. Our findings show that improve-
ments in behavioural, environmental, and occupational 
risks, and decreases in risk-deleted DALY rates have 
largely outpaced the effects of population growth and 
ageing, in terms of absolute burden. Sustained efforts in

reducing these risks are crucial to maintaining trends 
in declining burden from injuries and CMNNDs. 
Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic 
risks and population ageing will probably continue to 
drive the increasing trends in NCDs at the global level, 
which presents both a public health challenge and 
opportunity. Working down from the global to national 
level reveals considerable heterogeneity in levels of 
risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although 
development underlies some of this hetero 
geneity, ratios 
of observed burden to the burden expected based on SDI 
reveal risks for which countries are overperforming or 
underperforming relative to their level of socioeconomic 
development. As such, these ratios provide a bench-
marking tool to help focus local decision making. Our 
findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure 
monitoring and epidemiological research to assess 
causal connections between risks and health outcomes, 
and they highlight the essential role of GBD in 
synthesising data to draw the comprehensive and robust 
conclusions that are necessary to inform evidence-based 
policy.
