Abstract 
The Vaccines for Children program is a US government intervention aimed at increasing 
vaccination uptake by removing financial barriers that may prevent American children from 
accessing vaccinations. This study examined the impact that this intervention had on race- and 
ethnicity-related and income-related disparities for diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, 
measles-mumps-rubella, and polio vaccinations using data from the National Immunization 
Survey, 1995–2013. Vaccination rates increased across all races, ethnicities, and income groups 
following the introduction of the Vaccines for Children program. Disparities among race and 
ethnic groups narrowed considerably over time since the introduction of the vaccine program, 
although income-related disparities changed at different rates within race and ethnic groups and 
in some cases increased. Government interventions aimed solely at reducing certain financial 
barriers to vaccination may fail to address other important aspects of cost or perceived benefits 
that influence vaccination uptake, especially among poorer children. 
 
 
 Childhood vaccines for common communicable diseases are among the most beneficial 
health care interventions used worldwide. In the United States alone, it is estimated that 
childhood vaccinations will prevent an estimated 322 million bouts of illness and 732,000 deaths 
over the course of the lifetimes of children born between 1994 and 2013, benefitting under the 
Vaccines for Children program (VFC).[1] It is estimated that three vaccines in particular, 
diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), and polio will 
prevent 210 million bouts of illness and 600,000 deaths.[1]  
The VFC program is cited as a successful example of a federally funded initiative 
established to widen access to vaccinations (currently vaccines for sixteen diseases designated by 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are eligible) and to ameliorate the impact of 
low income on access to vaccines. The VFC program specifically seeks to improve access for 
children who are uninsured, whose insurance fails to cover vaccinations, who have Medicaid, or 
who are American Indian or Native Alaskan. Prior to the vaccine program, children from poorer, 
often non-white families had lower vaccination rates and higher rates of vaccine-preventable 
illnesses than those who were white and/or more well-off.[1,2] By 1997, 74 percent of all 
childhood vaccinations were received from providers enrolled in the program.[3]  
The VFC program is widely credited with reducing or removing cost barriers that 
contributed to disparities in vaccination rates across households differentiated by race and 
ethnicity,[2,4,5] and households differentiated by income.[6] No study, however, has examined 
income-related disparities in vaccination coverage between and within race and ethnic groups, 
nor what policy implications such an examination might offer. In this study, we examined 
income-related disparities in vaccination uptake within and between race and ethnic groups since 
the implementation of the program on October 1, 1994, until the most recent period where data is 
 available (2013). The study sought to use differences in the impact of the VFC program on 
income-related disparities within groups differentiated by race and ethnicity to assess the role of 
federally funded programs targeted at financial barriers to access. The study focused particular 
attention on the relative success of the program in respect of children from lower socioeconomic-
status families.  
 
Survey Data And Methods 
Data from the National Immunization Survey were used in this study. The survey was 
established partly in response to the introduction of the Vaccines for Children program, and data 
from it are used as an official source of information on vaccination rates in the United States by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government agencies.[7] Data from 
1995 to 2013 were available from the survey, which allowed us to examine vaccination uptake at 
the beginning of the VFC program (1995–97) up to the most recent period available (2011–13). 
In order to examine vaccination uptake over time, six time periods were created by merging data 
from separate years in order to boost sample size and avoid the potential impact of an aberration 
in any one year upon results.[8] Apart from information on vaccination uptake, the survey 
includes a range of sociodemographic information on the child and family including 
race/ethnicity, family size, and household income.  
The National Immunization Survey gathers data on children ages 19–35 months using a 
random-digit-dialing phone survey of households across the fifty states and the District of 
Columbia (information on Guam and the US Virgin Islands are also gathered, although not 
included in this study).[9,10] The survey also uses a mail version to collect data from providers 
 on the types of vaccinations administered, the number of doses, and the dates the vaccines were 
given.[11] The provider data is gathered after parental or guardian consent is given.  
The three vaccinations seen to have prevented the majority of vaccine-preventable bouts 
of illness and deaths,[1] DTaP, MMR, and polio vaccinations, are the primary vaccinations 
examined in this study. Analysis on Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B (HepB), 
and varicella (chickenpox), which are also recommended by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices and are included in the National Immunization Survey from the earliest 
period, are presented in the online Appendix.[12] 
Analyses undertaken in this study included unadjusted vaccination rates, adjusted 
vaccination rates (multivariate probit analyses controlling for a range of covariates), and 
concentration index analyses for the estimation of relative disparities in vaccination usage across 
income groups. Concentration indices (C) are an established method for quantifying 
socioeconomic-related disparities in health care utilization,[13-16] which allows for robust 
comparative analysis of income-related disparities (in this case) across race and ethnic groups. 
Concentration indices have been used in a variety of contexts including earlier studies of 
childhood vaccination uptake.[17-22] The disparity measured by concentration indices are 
bounded between -1 (extreme pro-poor disparities, that is, only the poorest are vaccinated) and 
+1 (extreme pro-rich disparities, that is, only the richest are vaccinated), with a concentration 
index equal to 0 denoting vaccination rates that do not differ across children with different 
incomes. In this analysis, we used the concentration index advocated by Adam Wagstaff for use 
with a binary dependent variable (whether the child had up-to-date vaccination uptake).[22]  
Equivalized household income is used to measure income-related disparities. Equalizing 
income accounts for household size that will affect the consumption potential (for example, 
 $50,000 in a two-person household should not be treated the same as $50,000 in a four-person 
household). Household income in the National Immunization Survey is provided in categorical 
ranges with a different number of categories used at different times. Eleven categories are 
included between 1995 and 1998, fifteen categories between 1999 and 2004, and fourteen 
categories between 2005 and 2013.[23] To adjust for the multiple categories in the survey, 
equivalized income was estimated by taking the mid-point for each category and dividing it by 
the square root of the number of people in the household (Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development square root equivalence scale).[24]  
Multivariate probit regressions were used to examine between-group differences in 
disparities by interacting race or ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic; children of other race or 
ethnicity were excluded) and equivalized household income (partitioned into tertiles to produce 
low-, middle-, and high-income households). This allowed us to include nine race and income 
dummies in our analyses to estimate vaccination uptake disparities, with high-income white 
children used as the base category in all cases. While poverty status of the household may be a 
more appropriate measure of socioeconomic deprivation, the categories in the 1995–97 period do 
not correspond to the categories in the later periods and could not therefore be used consistently 
across time. Other characteristics of the child and the household that were included in the 
regression analyses were mother’s education, parents’ marital status, child’s sex, state of 
residence (including the District of Columbia) fixed effects, and year fixed effects to account for 
differences in vaccination policies across states and over time. Other variables available in the 
2005–07, 2008–10, and 2011–13 periods were whether the child was the first born, whether the 
child was breastfed for six months after birth, the mother’s age, and insurance status. Separate 
analyses were undertaken in these later periods with these additional variables for confirmatory 
 purposes with no material differences observed with the results presented here. Results are 
presented as marginal effects instead of odds ratios to allow for comparability of results across 
vaccines and time periods.[25,26]  
To enhance the precision of estimates, and to allow for results to be nationally 
representative, all results were estimated using the random-digit-dialing weights. The accuracy 
of the estimates using these weights has been shown to allow for a total error of less than 1.72 
percent from the true population estimate.[27]  
A total of 342,062 children ages 19–35 months (51,950 in 1995–97; 61,178 in 1998–
2000; 81,416 in 2001–04; 51,529 in 2005–07; 49,191 in 2008–10; and 46,798 in 2011–13) were 
included in our study after observations without household income information (35,626) were 
dropped.[28]  
 
Study Results 
Unadjusted Vaccination Rates 
Vaccination rates increased since introduction of the Vaccines for Children program 
(1995–97) (Exhibit 1). More details on the vaccination rates for Hib, HepB, and varicella along 
with concentration indices for those vaccinations are available in the Appendix.[12] Exhibit 1 
shows that for DTaP and MMR overall, however, a slight reduction occurred between the two 
most recent periods included in 2008–13. Vaccination rates also changed at different rates across 
race/ethnic and income groups over time. At the beginning of the VFC program, significant 
racial- and ethnicity-related disparities in vaccination rates were observed. Higher vaccination 
rates were observed among white children with almost a 5 percentage-point difference in uptake 
of the DTaP between whites and blacks and almost a 9 percentage-point difference between 
 whites and Hispanics and smaller, but noticeable, differences in the MMR and polio vaccines. 
Vaccination rates converged between income and ethnic groups over time, especially in the 
2008–10 period. Hispanic children had the highest uptake rate of MMR (and HepB and varicella, 
see Appendix Exhibit A2[12]) in the latest period. In the 2011–13 period, income differences had 
increased slightly. 
With respect to income, significant income-related disparities were observed at the start 
of the VFC program. Higher-income children had vaccination rates greater than low-income 
children (DTaP: 88.0 percent versus 74.6 percent; MMR: 94.0 percent versus 86.4 percent; polio: 
93.5 percent versus 86.9 percent). Absolute differences in vaccination rates across income 
groups reduced considerably in the 2008-10 period for MMR and polio but remained large for 
DTaP (90.2 percent for high income versus 80.8 percent for low income). 
Income-related disparities in vaccination uptake differed across race and ethnicity 
(Exhibit 2). For additional details, see Appendix Exhibit A2.[12] And it is clear that income-
related disparities have changed over time at different rates among white, black, and Hispanic 
children.[12] At the beginning of the vaccine program, high-income white children were more 
likely to be vaccinated relative to high-income black and Hispanic children. However, the latest 
period’s vaccination rates among high-income children, regardless of race, were similar. The 
highest uptake of MMR and polio vaccinations was seen among high-income black children in 
2011–13. 
Among white children, differences in vaccine uptake rates have decreased overtime 
between high- and low-income children, halving for MMR and polio, although remaining similar 
for DTaP. Among black children, vaccination rates among high-income families increased at a 
much greater rate than that observed for low-income families. While in 1995–97, there was an 
 approximately 8 percentage-point difference in DTaP vaccination rates between high- and low-
income black children, in the latest period this had increased to approximately 13 percentage 
points. Increases in disparities between high-income and low-income black children were also 
seen for MMR and polio over time. 
The largest increase in overall vaccination rates over time was observed among low-
income Hispanic children. While low-income Hispanic children consistently had the lowest 
vaccination rates of all groups at the beginning of the VFC program, this was not the case in later 
periods. Differences in vaccination rates between high- and low-income Hispanic children were 
reduced (for DTaP) or were eliminated (for MMR and polio) by 2008–10, although disparities in 
rates of uptake for the DTaP and polio vaccines reemerged in 2011–13, with small declines in 
uptake among low-income Hispanics and small increases in uptake among high-income 
Hispanics. 
Concentration Indices 
Income-related disparities measured using concentration indices discussed below and in 
Appendix Exhibit A3[12] illustrate that while pro-rich income-related disparities (C > 0) were 
large in 1995–97, income-related disparities were reduced between 1995–97 and 2008–10 but 
again trend upwards in 2011–13. This confirms what is shown in Exhibit 2, where in the most 
recent period children in high-income households increased vaccination while poorer children 
did not.  
The largest reduction in overall US income-related disparities was observed for MMR 
vaccinations (C = 0.20 in 1995–97; C = 0.09 in 2011–13) (Exhibit 3). Income disparities went 
down among white and Hispanic children (where no statistically significant disparity was 
 observed in the two most recent periods) but went up among black children (C = 0.06 in 1995–
97; C = 0.16 in 2011–13). 
The largest income disparities among the ethnic groups was observed for DTaP (Exhibit 
4). While income disparities decreased in the 2008–10 time period, they increased once more in 
the latest period. Disparities remained relatively constant over time for white and Hispanic 
children. Black children once more saw an increase in income disparities in the two most recent 
periods. 
Compared to 1995-97 there was a reduction in income disparities up to the 2008–10 
period for polio vaccination uptake but an increase in the 2011–13 period (Exhibit 5). Disparities 
remained fairly constant for whites and Hispanics, although a slight increase in disparities were 
seen in 2011–13 for the latter group. For black children, income disparities were more than twice 
as high in 2011–13 (C = 0.22) as they were at the beginning of the VFC program (C = 0.09). 
Multivariate Analysis 
Marginal effects from multivariate analyses illustrate that the likelihood of vaccination 
uptake has changed considerably over time (Appendix Exhibit 4).[12] Results show that at the 
beginning of the vaccine program, vaccination rates among high-income white children were 
greater than in all other groups. The largest differences were observed relative to low-income 
black and Hispanic children. 
Differences between high-income white children and the other groups decreased over 
time for MMR and polio vaccinations, with differences between high-income whites and low-
income Hispanics in particular having a large reduction with a not statistically significant 
difference observed in 2011–13.  
 However, disparities remained as large for DTaP vaccination uptake in the latest period 
as they were in the earliest period. In 2011–13, controlling for a range of other characteristics, 
high-income white children had DTaP vaccination rates 13 and 16 percentage-points higher than 
low-income white and low-income black children, respectively, and rates approximately 8 
percentage-points higher than middle- and low-income Hispanics. 
 
Discussion 
The benefits of childhood vaccinations for communicable diseases in the United States 
and worldwide are widely acknowledged. They have been shown to be among the most cost-
effective health care interventions[29,30] and are estimated to have contributed significantly to 
reductions in morbidity and mortality.[1] This study has echoed that of others in showing that the 
Vaccines for Children program coincided with increased uptake of common vaccinations and 
reductions in disparities in vaccine uptake rates across races and ethnic groups and families from 
different socioeconomic situations.[2,4,5] Additionally, this study has added to existing 
knowledge in three areas.  
First, it has demonstrated the value and importance of examining within each group, as 
well as among groups, with groups being differentiated on the basis of race and ethnicity and 
income. Only by examining within-group disparities related to income, for example, is it possible 
to discern the very different experiences of black and Hispanic children in uptake of the MMR 
vaccination over time (Exhibit 3). As the VFC program developed, disparities between blacks 
and Hispanics relative to whites decreased. However, among blacks, income-related disparities 
increased, while those among Hispanics decreased. Similarly, the very different experiences 
within ethnic groups was evident (Exhibit 2). Here, it was seen that low-income Hispanics 
 increased uptake of virtually all vaccines to a greater extent, and in a more sustained manner 
over the duration of the vaccines program, than was the case among the other low-income 
groups. This provides a more nuanced insight into the experiences of different groups, calls for a 
more thorough investigation of the factors underlying variations in uptake, and perhaps a more 
nuanced policy response than simply reducing financial barriers to access that the VFC program 
(and lately the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which removed cost-sharing requirements from 
vaccines) has done. 
Second, the study demonstrates that the reductions in disparities over the operation of the 
VFC program did not occur evenly over time, across vaccines, or among different groups. In the 
case of DTaP, MMR, and polio vaccines, much of the increase in uptake by disadvantaged 
groups can be seen to have occurred in 2005–07 instead of earlier. Indeed, as the analysis shows, 
in the last period observed in this study (2011–13), there has been a discernible if slight widening 
of income disparities in respect of several vaccines including DTaP and MMR. That the impact 
should change over time suggests that other factors complemented the impact the vaccines 
program had on changing disparities in vaccination uptake. As with the examination of within 
race and ethnic group differences, this again points to the need for a nuanced understanding of 
what and how factors other than the reduction in financial barriers to access affected uptake. 
Whether these changes related to health promotion activities, increased public awareness 
associated with disease outbreaks, or changes in other factors seemingly unrelated to the value of 
vaccines for children is unclear. What is clear is that only a more thorough investigation of the 
changes in other factors that coincided with changes in vaccine uptake will provide a fuller 
understanding of the contribution of the VFC program to the increases in uptake and reductions 
in disparities.  
 Third, changes in disparities occurred at different rates across vaccines. It is tempting to 
posit a relationship between the number of shots associated with a particular vaccine and its 
uptake specifically for the relatively low uptake and large disparities observed for DTaP. 
However, while uptake is lower and disparities higher with DTaP (which requires four shots for 
children of this age) than with MMR (which requires one shot for children of this age), uptake of 
polio (where three shots are recommended) and disparities in uptake, are of a similar order of 
magnitude as with MMR. One potential future avenue of research in this sense may be into the 
perceived benefit of some vaccines, the perceived severity of illness that vaccines prevent, and to 
what extent these perceptions influence the decision of parents and vaccination providers (that is, 
physicians) to request or suggest vaccination. 
Among low-income Hispanics, both the extent of the reduction in income-related 
disparities and the patterns across vaccines are different to that among whites and blacks. Again, 
this suggests factors other than cost--whether financial or related to inconvenience associated 
with repeat practitioner office visits--underlie uptake and differences in uptake across groups. 
Similarly, it is also interesting that vaccination uptake among high-income black children 
increased at a greater rate than for low-income black children. These distinctions are important in 
the sense that while the increase in receipt of vaccines facilitated by the VFC program benefited 
all groups, it did not benefit them uniformly to eliminate all disparities between and within 
groups. Indeed, as the experience among black children shows, our findings suggest that broad 
instruments such as widening access by reducing financial barriers for all could serve to sharpen 
instead of reduce within-group income-related disparities by benefiting high-income families to a 
greater degree than poorer families.  
 As noted, results from this study also show that while income-related disparities 
decreased over time, there was an uptick in disparities in the latest period. This period 
corresponds to the introduction of the ACA, which required all new private insurance plans 
beginning September 23, 2010, to cover Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ 
recommended vaccinations without any cost-sharing requirement. To what extent the ACA 
affected results in the most recent period is difficult to ascertain. However, it is reasonable to 
expect that the requirement of private insurance to wave all cost-sharing for vaccinations would 
benefit richer, insured families to a greater degree than poorer, uninsured families thereby 
increasing income-related disparities.  
An important finding of this study is that while racial and ethnic disparities in 
vaccinations were large at the beginning of the vaccines program, vaccination rates across 
ethnicities have narrowed considerably, which is to be welcomed. Socioeconomic disparities, as 
measured by household income, however, remain. The question of why some children, 
specifically those from lower socioeconomic groups who prior to the establishment of the VFC 
program had greater incidence of vaccine-preventable disease,[1,2] still do not undergo 
vaccination, even after the removal of many financial barriers through the program, is one that 
requires greater scrutiny from both researchers and policy makers. It seems unlikely that the 
lower rates of uptake in poor children could be explained by laws allowing nonmedical 
exemption in many states, since the evidence from studies on the impact of nonmedical 
exemption laws also clearly indicates that those who fill out exemptions are more likely to be 
from richer families, not those from lower-income households.[31,32]  
While this study has examined the impact of the VFC program on vaccination behavior, 
it is acknowledged that other factors and policies, such as state exemption changes,[33] removal 
 of insurance cost-sharing requirements,[34] and exogenous factors such as the specious linkage 
of the MMR vaccine to autism, may have affected vaccination behavior. Approximately 10 
percent of children in the National Immunization Survey were dropped because of missing 
income information, which may lead to an underestimation of the disparities observed.[28] 
Furthermore, the lack of information on the insurance status of the child in each year of the 
survey prevented the examination of what impact the program had on children in different 
insurance statuses. 
 
Conclusion 
There was a significant increase in the uptake of many common vaccines and a reduction 
in disparities across ethnic and racial groups subsequent to the introduction of the Vaccines for 
Children program in the United States. These gains may well be attributable to the impact of the 
program in reducing financial barriers to access. The pattern of uptake, however, requires a more 
nuanced explanation, since it varied within groups differentiated by race and ethnicity over time. 
A deeper explanation might be required than just simply referring to a reduction in financial 
barriers to access. A failure to explore such patterns and seek a fuller explanation for the patterns 
of uptake observed not only means valuable insights may be missed that could inform policy but 
may fail to counter recent reversals in the reductions in disparities observed in respect of the 
uptake on many common vaccines.  
It is clear that policies aimed at improving vaccination behavior warrants careful 
consideration and with a specific focus on poorer families. More nuanced and creative 
interventions are needed if the benefits of these highly effective interventions are to be shared by 
those who stand to benefit the most, specifically among poorer children.
