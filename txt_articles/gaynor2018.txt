Abstract
OBJECTIVES: Pregnancies with congenital heart disease in the foetus have an increased prevalence of pre-eclampsia, small for gestational
age and preterm birth, which are evidence of an impaired maternal–foetal environment (MFE).
METHODS: The impact of an impaired MFE, defined as pre-eclampsia, small for gestational age or preterm birth, on outcomes after car-
diac surgery was evaluated in neonates (n = 135) enrolled in a study evaluating exposure to environmental toxicants and neuro-
developmental outcomes.
RESULTS: The most common diagnoses were transposition of the great arteries (n = 47) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 43).
Impaired MFE was present in 28 of 135 (21%) subjects, with small for gestational age present in 17 (61%) patients. The presence of an im-
paired MFE was similar for all diagnoses, except transposition of the great arteries (P < 0.006). Postoperative length of stay was shorter for
subjects without an impaired MFE (14 vs 38 days, P < 0.001). Hospital mortality was not significantly different with or without impaired
MFE (11.7% vs 2.8%, P = 0.104). However, for the entire cohort, survival at 36 months was greater for those without an impaired MFE (96%
vs 68%, P = 0.001). For patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, survival was also greater for those without an impaired MFE (90% vs
43%, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: An impaired MFE is common in pregnancies in which the foetus has congenital heart disease. After cardiac surgery in
neonates, the presence of an impaired MFE was associated with lower survival at 36 months of age for the entire cohort and for the sub-
group with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

INTRODUCTION
The placenta plays a key role in the development of a foetus in a
normal maternal–foetal environment (MFE) setting [1, 2]. Poor
growth of the foetus, maternal complications and preterm birth
(PTB) are signs of an impaired MFE. Gestational hypertension,
pre-eclampsia (PE), small for gestational age (SGA) and PTB are
associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity in newborns
without congenital heart disease (CHD). Maturation of organ sys-
tems continues throughout late gestation [3]. PE, SGA and PTB
(even by a few weeks) result in functional immaturity of multiple
organ systems; PE is associated with increased neonatal mortality
[4], and SGA is associated with impaired heart and lung function
[5–8]. There is increasing evidence that the placenta and MFE are
abnormal in many foetuses with CHD [9–11]. Pregnancies with
CHD in the foetus have an increased prevalence of PE, SGA and
PTB [12–14]. PTB and SGA have been associated with increased
early mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery in neonates
[15–17]. We hypothesized that an impaired MFE (defined as the

 presence of gestational hypertension/PE, SGA or PTB) would
have an adverse impact on early and intermediate-term out-
comes in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS
The study cohort comprised neonates enrolled in a prospective
observational study of the impact of prenatal exposure to envir-
onmental toxicants on neuro-developmental outcomes after car-
diac surgery. The inclusion criterion was CHD necessitating
cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass prior to 44 weeks
completed post-conception age. Exclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: (i) a known genetic syndrome, (ii) a major extracardiac
anomaly and (iii) language other than English spoken at home.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Written informed consent
was obtained from parents or guardians of all the participants.
Details of the prenatal course and perioperative outcomes
were documented from medical records. As part of the parent
study, surviving subjects underwent neuro-developmental evalu-
ation at 18 months of age. Survival data and vital status were as-
certained from medical records and contact with the parents or
guardians.
For the purpose of this study, an impaired MFE was considered
to be present if one or more of the following occurred: gesta-
tional hypertension, PE, SGA or PTB. Gestational hypertension
was defined as 2 blood pressure measurements higher than 140/
90 mmHg at least 4 h apart at >20 weeks gestational age. PE was
defined as gestational hypertension with proteinuria or end-
organ (liver or kidney) injury. SGA was defined as birthweight
below the 10th percentile for gestational age. PTB was defined as
birth prior to 37 weeks gestational age. Placental weight, birth-
weight and foetal echocardiography data were obtained from
prenatal and birth records. Placental weights and foetal echocar-
diography data were not available for infants followed up pre-
natally or born at other institutions and for those without a
prenatal diagnosis of CHD. The umbilical artery pulsatility index
(PI) and the umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio (S/D) from the
foetal echocardiogram at the last prenatal visit were used to as-
sess
placental
vascular
resistance
and
potential
abnormal
perfusion.
Patients were evaluated by a genetic dysmorphologist. Genetic
testing was performed as indicated. Neonatal recognition of dys-
morphic features may be difficult; therefore, some patients were
enrolled for whom the diagnosis of a genetic syndrome was not
made until the 18-month neuro-developmental evaluation.
Patients were classified as having no definite genetic syndrome
or chromosomal abnormality (‘normal’) or as having a definite or
suspected genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality (‘ab-
normal/suspected’).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis proceeded in 2 discrete stages, a descriptive phase
and an inferential phase. To fully familiarize ourselves with the
data, and because of the non-normative nature of many of the
distributions, parametric as well as non-parametric measures of
central tendency (mean and median) and variability (standard
deviation and interquartile range) were computed for all relevant
variables in the data set, with a specific emphasis on the MFE
variables. When foetuses were used as the unit of analysis,
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test for differences be-
tween those with and without impaired MFEs for umbilical artery
PI, umbilical artery S/D and placental weight. However, when in-
fants were used as the unit of analysis, both Fisher’s exact test (for
gender, race, cardiac diagnosis, genetic anomaly and hospital
survival) and Wilcoxon rank-sum difference test were used [for
gestational age, birthweight and postoperative length of stay
(LOS)], depending on the characteristics of the data. Mortality
rates were estimated for babies from impaired and non-impaired
MFEs using the Kaplan–Meier survival curves and then compared
using log-rank tests, for the cohort as a whole as well as the
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) subsample. Mortality was
defined as death at the last follow-up with time 0 defined as the
date of birth. The criterion for statistical significance was at an
unadjusted a = 0.05 level. All analyses were conducted using SAS
v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Between 8 September 2011 and 13 August 2015, 140 neonates
were enrolled in the primary study. Of these, 135 underwent car-
diac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass prior to 44 weeks
completed post-gestational age and formed the study popula-
tion. Subject characteristics of the cohort are listed in Table 1.
The cohort was largely male (59%) and Caucasian (77%). The
most common cardiac defects were transposition of the great
arteries (TGA, 35%) and HLHS (32%). Suspected or definite gen-
etic anomalies were identified in 25% of neonates. Demographic
and patient-specific factors are listed in Table 1.
An impaired MFE was present in 28 (21%) subjects. SGA was
the most common adverse outcome of an impaired MFE and
occurred in 17 of 135 (13%) subjects. It is important to recognize
that SGA is not equivalent to low birthweight as the birthweight
was >
_2500 g for 8 of 17 (47%) subjects who met the criterion for
foetal growth restriction. SGA is defined as a birthweight <10th
percentile for gestational age. It is not a specific weight. Low
birthweight is commonly defined as a birthweight <2500 g.
Depending on the gestational age at birth, a baby may weigh
more than 2500 g but still meet the criterion for SGA. The second
most common condition associated with impaired MFE was PTB
that occurred in 10 of 135 (7%) subjects. Gestational hyperten-
sion occurred in 3 of 135 (2%) pregnancies and PE in 7 (5%). In 7
of 28 (25%) pregnancies with an impaired MFE, more than one
diagnostic criterion was present.
The last foetal echocardiogram was performed at a median of
36.4 weeks gestational age (30–39 weeks). Umbilical artery PI
(n = 108, 1.21 ± 0.36 vs 1.03 ± 0.22, P = 0.012) and the umbilical ar-
tery S/D (n = 108, 3.45 ± 1.35 vs 2.84 ± 0.65, P = 0.015) were higher
for foetuses with an impaired MFE, consistent with increased pla-
cental vascular resistance and altered perfusion. Placental weight
(n = 110) was lower for babies with an impaired MFE compared
with those without evidence of an impaired MFE (425 ± 164 vs
460 ± 116 g, P = 0.046).
Patients with impaired MFE were more likely to be male and
non-Caucasian than those without evidence of impaired MFE
(P = 0.009 and P = 0.044, respectively) (Table 1). The occurrence
of impaired MFE was similar for all types of CHD, except TGA
(P = 0.006). An impaired MFE was identified in 30% of HLHS pa-
tients; 29% of those with interrupted aortic arch/ventricular sep-
tal defect; 4% of those with TGA; 30% of those with tetralogy of
Fallot; 17% of those with truncus arteriosus; and 32% of those

 with other types of CHD. As would be expected from the diag-
nostic criteria for an impaired MFE, gestational age and birth-
weight were lower for babies with an impaired MFE (both
P < 0.001). Occurrence of an impaired MFE did not vary if there
was a suspected or confirmed genetic anomaly (P = 1.000).
Postoperative LOS was shorter for subjects without an im-
paired MFE (14 ± 14 vs 38 ± 65 days, P < 0.001). There were 6 early
deaths, 3 of 28 (10.7%) among patients with evidence of an im-
paired and 3 of 107 (2.8%) among those without evidence of an
impaired MFE. However, hospital mortality did not differ be-
tween the 2 groups (P = 0.104). The survivors have been followed
up for a median of 37 months (0.4–64.2 months). There have
been 6 late deaths and 5 of 6 occurred in patients with an im-
paired MFE. For the entire cohort, survival at 36 months was sig-
nificantly lower for those with impaired MFE compared with a
normal MFE (68% vs 96%, P < 0.001; Fig. 1). For patients with
HLHS, survival at 36 months was also significantly lower for those
with impaired MFE (43% vs 90%, P < 0.001; Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that an impaired MFE characterized
by gestational hypertension, PE, SGA and PTB is common in neo-
nates with complex CHD, and depending on the specific type of
CHD, impairment may be present in up to 30% of neonates. The
occurrence of impaired MFE was similar for most types of CHD,
except TGA. In addition, the presence of a known genetic
anomaly did not alter the risk for an impaired MFE. PE and SGA
are thought to result from placental dysfunction, and there is evi-
dence that placental malperfusion may also be a cause of PTB
[18]. In our study, newborns with impaired MFE had lower pla-
cental weights and increased umbilical artery PI, which are
markers of placental insufficiency. The possibility of a common
mechanism for placental insufficiency and CHD, perhaps related
to abnormal angiogenesis, has been suggested by other investi-
gators [12, 19, 20]. Presence of an impaired MFE was associated
with prolonged hospitalization after cardiac surgery and signifi-
cantly worse intermediate-term survival, both for the entire co-
hort and patients with HLHS. Previous studies have shown that
SGA and PTB are associated with increased mortality and mor-
bidity early after cardiac surgery in neonates [15–17]. This study
demonstrates that the adverse effects of an impaired MFE extend
long after the neonatal period. It is possible that impairment of
the MFE results in functional immaturity of multiple organ sys-
tems. Furthermore, multiple studies have also shown abnormal
structure and function of the heart in foetal growth restriction
foetuses, leading to decreased biological reserve and thus lower
survival after cardiac surgery in neonates [5, 21].
There is increasing evidence that the MFE and placenta are ab-
normal in many foetuses with CHD and adversely affect the de-
velopment
of
the
foetus.

 children with CHD [22]. Several subtypes of CHD were associated
with smaller head circumferences, including HLHS, other single-
ventricle CHD, TGA, tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal de-
fects and major ventricular septal defects. Overall, the birthweight
z-score was modestly smaller than the head circumference
z-score in all children with CHD. In the same cohort, we
evaluated the associations between all major subtypes of CHD
and placental weight at birth, and the association between
placental weight and measures of both overall and cerebral
growth in foetuses with CHD [9]. Placental weight z-score was
associated with birthweight and head circumference z-scores in
all subtypes. Interestingly, tetralogy of Fallot, double-outlet right
ventricle and major ventricular septal defects were significantly
associated with smaller placental size at birth.
Andescavage et al. [10] used 3D volumetric magnetic reson-
ance imaging to evaluate the placenta in foetuses with CHD and
showed that impaired placental growth in CHD was associated
with younger gestational age and lower birthweight at delivery
[10]. They concluded that decreased placental growth in the CHD
foetus may be associated with impaired foetal growth and pre-
mature delivery, each outcome an independent risk factor for
neonatal mortality and morbidity [10]. Cedergren and Kallen [23]

 evaluated the outcomes of pregnancies with an infant affected by
CHD in a prospective population-based cohort study from
Sweden (1992–2001). Outcomes for 6346 singleton pregnancies
with infants affected by CHD were compared with all delivered
women. In the cohort of infants with CHD, there were signifi-
cantly increased risks of PE, SGA, Caesarean section or instru-
mental delivery, PTB, meconium aspiration and foetal distress
[23]. Foetal thrombotic vasculopathy is characterized by region-
ally distributed avascular villi and is often accompanied by
thrombosis in placental foetal vessels [24]. Jones et al. [25] investi-
gated placental histopathology in foetuses with CHD. Compared
with controls, gross pathology of HLHS cases demonstrated sig-
nificantly reduced placental weight and increased fibrin depos-
ition. Histological examination showed decreased terminal villi,
reduced vasculature and increased leptin expression in syncytio-
trophoblast and endothelial cells.
It is increasingly being recognized that CHD in the foetus may
adversely affect the health of the mother. For example, pregnan-
cies with foetal CHD have an increased prevalence of PE.
Brodwall et al. [12] investigated the association between maternal
PE and offspring risk of severe CHD using the Medical Birth
Registry of Norway, 1994–2009. When adjusting for potential
confounders, the risk ratio for severe CHD in the
offspring of
mothers with any PE was 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1–1.5),
and in pregnancies with early-onset PE, the risk ratio was 2.8
(95% confidence interval 1.8–4.4). Auger et al. [26] investigated
the relationship between CHD and PE using population-based
data from Quebec. They found an elevated prevalence of heart
defects among infants of women with PE compared with no PE.
Women with early-onset PE had significantly greater prevalence
of infants with CHD, whereas women with late onset had only
marginally greater prevalence [26].
Several studies have shown that foetal CHD impairs foetal
growth, which in turn adversely affects surgical outcomes. Malik
et al. [27] used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention
Study to evaluate live singleton infants born with CHD. After con-
trolling for maternal and infant covariates, infants with CHD were
more likely to be SGA than infants without CHD. In the
Paediatric Heart Network (PHN) Infant Single Ventricle (ISV) Trial,
SGA occurred in 22% of infants with single ventricle (SV) com-
pared with 10% of normal neonates [14]. Graf et al. [16] evaluated
the impact of SGA on cardiac surgery outcomes in a cohort of 41
patients in a case–control study. SGA was associated with
increased operative mortality [16] as well as an increased inci-
dence of major postoperative complications including prolonged
LOS, prolonged mechanical ventilation, postoperative cardiac ar-
rest and postoperative infection. Hospital charges for the patients
with SGA were considerably higher than for the control patients.
Sochet et al. [17] evaluated the importance of SGA status in the
risk assessment of infants with CHD in a cohort of 230 infants
undergoing cardiac surgery. Thirty-day mortality was significantly
greater in SGA infants (14% vs 3.5%, P < 0.005). Importantly, SGA
infants with normal birthweight (> 2500 g) were also at increased
risk of 30-day mortality compared with appropriate for gesta-
tional age infants (P < 0.045). However, they did not find that SGA
status was associated with longer LOS or increased postoperative
complications.
PTB is common in CHD and, not surprisingly, is associated
with a significantly increased risk of adverse outcomes after sur-
gery for CHD. In the PHN ISV Trial, PTB occurred in 16% of in-
fants with SV compared to 10% of normal neonates [14]. Cnota
et al. [28] investigated the impact of gestational age and risk of
death using 2000–03 national linked birth/infant death cohort
data sets from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
CHD deaths occurred in 4736 infants (0.04%) born between
34 weeks and 40 weeks. There was a significant, negative linear
relationship between CHD death rate and gestational age
(R2 = 0.97). Laas et al. [13] used data from the French National
Perinatal Survey of 2003 to compare the incidence of PTB in in-
fants with and without CHD. Of the infants with CHD, 13.5%
were born preterm. The odds of PTB for infants with CHD were
2-fold higher than for the general population primarily due to an
increase in spontaneous PTB. The risk of PTB persisted after ex-
clusion of patients with chromosomal or other anomalies.
Costello et al. [29] from Boston Children’s Hospital studied 971
consecutive infants with CHD. Compared with a reference group
of neonates born at 39–40 completed weeks of gestation, neo-
nates born at earlier gestational ages had significantly increased
mortality and tended to require a longer duration of mechanical
ventilation. These findings were later confirmed in a multi-
institutional study using the Society Thoracic Congenital Heart
Surgery National Database [15]. Compared with a 39.5-week ges-
tational age reference group, birth at 37 weeks or earlier gesta-
tional age was associated with greater in-hospital mortality. In
addition, complication rates were higher and postoperative LOS
was significantly prolonged for those born at 37 and 38 weeks of
gestation.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. The sample size is rela-
tively small, which may limit the ability to identify the risk factors
for an impaired MFE. Because the parent study was focused on
neuro-developmental outcomes, the study excluded subjects
with known genetic syndromes and major extracardiac anoma-
lies that may limit the generalizability. Foetal echocardiography
data and placental weights were not available for all subjects.
Finally, there are other factors that may impact the risk of an im-
paired MFE, which were not evaluated including maternal dia-
betes, tobacco exposure, multiple gestation, advanced maternal
age and socio-economic status.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we found that an impaired MFE is common in preg-
nancies in which the foetus has CHD and encompasses more fac-
tors than just low birthweight or PTB. These data support the
possibility of a common mechanism for placental insufficiency
and CHD. Our findings also support the hypothesis that impair-
ment of the MFE results in functional immaturity and abnormal
development of multiple organ systems, leading to decreased
biological reserve and thus lower survival after cardiac surgery in
neonates. The presence of an impaired MFE was associated with
prolonged LOS after surgery and a trend towards increased hos-
pital mortality. Importantly, the impact of an impaired MFE ap-
pears to extend for years after the initial surgery. After cardiac
surgery in neonates, the presence of an impaired MFE was asso-
ciated with significantly lower survival at 36 months of age for
the entire cohort and for the subgroup with HLHS. At the last
follow-up, 67% of the deaths had occurred in babies with an im-
paired MFE. For all, except 1 death, the impaired MFE was sec-
ondary to gestational hypertension/PE or SGA. Future studies are
