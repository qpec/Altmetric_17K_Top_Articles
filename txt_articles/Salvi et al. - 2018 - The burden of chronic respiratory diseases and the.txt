The burden of chronic respiratory diseases and their 
heterogeneity across the states of India: the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 1990–2016
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative CRD Collaborators*
Summary
Background India has 18% of the global population and an increasing burden of chronic respiratory diseases. However, 
a systematic understanding of the distribution of chronic respiratory diseases and their trends over time is not readily 
available for all of the states of India. Our aim was to report the trends in the burden of chronic respiratory diseases 
and the heterogeneity in their distribution in all states of India between 1990 and 2016.
Methods Using all accessible data from multiple sources, we estimated the prevalence of major chronic respiratory 
diseases and the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by them for every state of India from 1990 to 
2016 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016. We assessed heterogeneity 
in the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma across the states of India. The states 
were categorised into four groups based on their epidemiological transition level (ETL). ETL was defined as the ratio 
of DALYs from communicable diseases to those from non-communicable diseases and injuries combined, with a low 
ratio denoting high ETL and vice versa. We also assessed the contribution of risk factors to DALYs due to COPD. We 
compared the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in India against the global average in GBD 2016. We calculated 
95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
Findings The contribution of chronic respiratory diseases to the total DALYs in India increased from 4·5% 
(95% UI 4·0–4·9) in 1990 to 6·4% (5·8–7·0) in 2016. Of the total global DALYs due to chronic respiratory diseases 
in 2016, 32·0% occurred in India. COPD and asthma were responsible for 75·6% and 20·0% of the chronic 
respiratory disease DALYs, respectively, in India in 2016. The number of cases of COPD in India increased from 
28·1 million (27·0–29·2) in 1990 to 55·3 million (53·1–57·6) in 2016, an increase in prevalence from 3·3% (3·1–3·4) 
to 4·2% (4·0–4·4). The age-standardised COPD prevalence and DALY rates in 2016 were highest in the less 
developed low ETL state group. There were 37·9 million (35·7–40·2) cases of asthma in India in 2016, with similar 
prevalence in the four ETL state groups, but the highest DALY rate was in the low ETL state group. The highest 
DALY rates for both COPD and asthma in 2016 were in the low ETL states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The 
DALYs per case of COPD and asthma were 1·7 and 2·4 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, 
respectively; most states had higher rates compared with other locations worldwide at similar levels of Socio-
demographic Index. Of the DALYs due to COPD in India in 2016, 53·7% (43·1–65·0) were attributable to air 
pollution, 25·4% (19·5–31·7) to tobacco use, and 16·5% (14·1–19·2) to occupational risks, making these the leading 
risk factors for COPD.
Interpretation India has a disproportionately high burden of chronic respiratory diseases. The increasing contribution 
of these diseases to the overall disease burden across India and the high rate of health loss from them, especially in 
the less developed low ETL states, highlights the need for focused policy interventions to address this significant 
cause of disease burden in India.

Introduction
Chronic respiratory diseases include chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumoconiosis, 
interstitial lung diseases, and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Of 
these diseases, COPD and asthma are the most common.1 
COPD is one of the leading non-communicable causes of 
death globally, as well as in India.1–3 India has a population 
of 1·3 billion people living in 29 states and seven union 
territories, many of which have populations as large as 
some countries, and which often vary widely in terms 
of ecology, economy, and demography, all of which 
affect respiratory health.2,4 The Sustainable Development 
Goals aim to reduce premature mortality from non-
communicable diseases by a third by 2030 through 
prevention and treatment.5 The National Health Policy of 
India 2017 recommends that premature mortality from 
 Articles

non-communicable diseases, including chronic respir-
atory diseases, should be reduced by 25% by 2025.6
Health is a state subject in the Indian federal structure, 
with most health expenditure coming from state 
budgets.7 Accurate and comprehensive data on what is 
driving chronic respiratory disease burden in each state 
of India is therefore crucial for policy makers to be able 
to make the best informed decisions possible for 
improving respiratory health. Some attempts have been 
made previously to compile the burden of COPD and 
asthma using studies from different parts of India.8–11 
However, a systematic understanding of the distribution 
of chronic respiratory diseases and their trends over 
time is not readily available for all of the states of India.
In 2017, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative 
reported a varied epidemiological transition occurring 
among the states of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) 2016.2,3 Here, we report changes in the 
burden of chronic respiratory diseases, in particular the 
heterogeneity in the distribution of COPD and asthma, 
across all states of India between 1990 and 2016.
Methods
Overview
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative has reported 
the overall trends of diseases, injuries, and risk factors for 
every state of India from 1990 to 2016.2,3 This analysis was 
done as part of GBD 2016, which used all accessible data to 
estimate disease burden due to 333 diseases and injuries 
and 84 risk factors. The India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative was supported by the efforts of several expert 
groups and a large network of collaborators who identified 
and accessed all available data sources, assessed their scope 
and quality for inclusion, and participated in the analysis 
and interpretation of the findings. The Health Ministry 
Screening Committee at the Indian Council of Medical 
Research and the ethics committee of the Public Health 
Foundation of India approved the work of this initiative. 
Detailed descriptions of the metrics and analytical 
approaches used in GBD 2016 have been reported 
elsewhere.1,12–16 Here, we report findings on the burden of 
chronic respiratory diseases, in particular COPD and 
asthma, and their heterogeneity across the states of India 
from 1990 to 2016. The GBD 2016 methods relevant to this 
Article are described in the appendix (pp 3–22), and a 
summary of the key points follows.
Estimation of prevalence and years lived with disability
The prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases was esti-
mated by location, age, sex, and year using DisMod-MR 
version 2.1, an updated Bayesian regression analytical 
tool used in GBD to estimate non-fatal health outcomes.14 
The major data inputs for estimating the prevalence of 
chronic respiratory diseases in India were population-
representative surveys and cohort studies, including 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and publicly available reports for 
estimates of the burden of chronic respiratory diseases, 
including COPD and asthma, across the states of India using 
the search terms “asthma”, “burden”, “cause of death”, 
“chronic respiratory disease”, “death”, “DALY”, “epidemiology”, 
“India”, “lung diseases”, “morbidity”, “mortality”, “prevalence”, 
“pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive”, and “trends” on 
March 26, 2018, without language or other publication 
restrictions. Although previous attempts have been made to 
assess the burden of COPD and asthma in some parts of the 
country, there have been no reports summarising the burden 
of chronic respiratory diseases or a comprehensive 
compilation of the prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for COPD 
and asthma across all states of India over a prolonged period 
of time.
Added value of this study
This report highlights the disproportionate burden of chronic 
respiratory diseases in India, which has 18% of the world’s 
population, but 32% of the global DALYs from these diseases. 
We provide a comprehensive assessment of the burden of 
COPD and asthma in every state of India from 1990 to 2016, 
based on all accessible data and using the standardised Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
methodology. The highest rates of age-standardised DALYs 
from COPD and asthma in 2016 were in the relatively less 
developed states in north India. An important finding of this 
study is that most states in India have higher DALYs rates due 
to COPD and asthma than do other locations around the 
world at similar levels of sociodemographic development. 
The finding that DALYs per person with COPD and asthma in 
India are 1·7 and 2·4 times higher than the global average, 
respectively, points to the need to improve the detection and 
management of these diseases. Furthermore, the findings 
highlight that air pollution was the leading risk factor for 
COPD in India in 2016, being responsible for more COPD 
burden than smoking.
Implications of all the available evidence
This comprehensive assessment of the burden of chronic 
respiratory diseases in every state of India from 1990 to 2016 
points to the clear need for health system strategies to address 
these diseases, given that there is currently no large-scale 
systematic effort to control this burden at the population level 
in India. While nationwide strategies are needed to bring more 
prominence to the control of COPD and asthma, the state-level 
findings can provide useful guidance on how to modify the 
efforts based on the disease burden and risk factor trends in 
each state of India.

published and unpublished studies (appendix pp 23–33). 
The Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Initiative Survey 
(BOLD) was one of the major data sources used to 
estimate COPD prevalence in India. The Indian Study on 
Epidemiology of Asthma, Respiratory Symptoms and 
Chronic Bronchitis in adults (INSEARCH), and the 
International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood 
(ISAAC) were the major data sources used to estimate 
asthma prevalence in India.17–19
All available and accessible data on prevalence, 
incidence, and remission were used in the modelling if 
they met the quality and inclusion criteria. The estimation 
included ascertainment of the severity distribution of 
sequelae, incorporation of disability weights, and 
comorbidity adjustment of sequelae. Years lived with 
disability (YLDs) were calculated by multiplying the 
prevalence of each sequela by its disability weight for the 
corresponding health state.
GBD uses covariates, which are explanatory variables 
that have a known association with the outcome of 
interest, to arrive at the best possible estimate when data 
on the outcome are scarce but data on the covariates are 
available.12–16 This approach was part of the estimation 
process for the findings presented in this report.
Estimation of deaths, years of life lost, and disability-
adjusted life-years
Deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases were 
estimated with Cause of Death Ensemble modelling. For 
this estimation, the completeness of death records was 
assessed using statistical models, and recorded deaths 
were mapped with the International Classification of 
Diseases versions 9 and 10 codes to enable a consistent 
classification of the causes of death. The garbage codes 
for specific chronic respiratory disease causes of death 
were redistributed proportionally using regression 
models. The CoDCorrect algorithm was used to adjust 
the estimates such that the predicted number of deaths 
from the components (eg, COPD deaths) added up to the 
total for chronic respiratory diseases, and the sum of 
deaths from all causes added up to the total deaths.1,12 
Years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death were 
estimated using the GBD normative standard life 
expectancy at each age. Disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs for 
each cause.
The major data inputs for the estimates of mortality 
due to chronic respiratory diseases included Sample 
Registration System cause of death data, Medical 
Certification of Cause of Death data, and other verbal 
autopsy studies (appendix pp 23–33).
Estimation of risk factor exposure and attributable 
disease burden
The GBD comparative risk assessment framework was 
used to estimate risk factor exposure related to chronic 
respiratory diseases and the attributable disease burden.16 
Exposure data for risk factors with a categorical or 
continuous distribution were collated from all available 
data sources that could be accessed, including survey and 
other data, adjusted by use of age–sex splitting, and 
strengthened with the incorporation of covariates for 
modelling. The modelling approach integrated multiple 
data inputs and borrowed information across age, time, 
and location to produce the best possible estimates of 
risk exposure by location, age, sex, and year. For each risk 
factor, the theoretical minimum risk exposure level was 
established as the lowest level of risk exposure below 
which its relationship with a disease outcome is not 
supported by the available evidence.16 Estimates of mean 
risk factor exposure, strengthened by covariates, were 
used to calculate summary exposure values for each risk, 
a metric ranging from 0% to 100% to describe the risk-
weighted exposure for a population or risk-weighted 
prevalence of exposure.
Estimation of attributable disease burden included 
ascertainment of relative risk of disease outcomes for 
risk exposure–disease outcome pairs with sufficient 
evidence of a causal relationship in randomised con-
trolled trials, prospective cohorts, or case-control studies, 
as assessed with an approach similar to the World Cancer 
Research Fund grading system, and then estimation of 
population attributable fractions for diseases caused by 
each risk factor.16 Estimates of deaths and DALYs 
attributable to each risk factor were produced by location, 
age, sex, and year. A detailed description of exposure and 
attributable disease burden estimation for the major risk 
factors associated with chronic respiratory diseases, 
including GBD exposure definitions and statistical 
modelling, is described in the appendix (pp 3–22), and 
provided elsewhere.16
The major data inputs for risk factors for chronic 
respiratory diseases in India included nationwide 
household health surveys, air pollution monitoring 
and satellite data, youth and adult tobacco surveys, 
occupational surveys of the National Sample Survey 
Organisation, and several other large population-level 
surveys (appendix pp 23–33).
Analysis presented in this paper
Findings are reported for 31 geographical units in India: 
29 states, the Union Territory of Delhi, and the union 
territories other than Delhi (combining the six smaller 
union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, 
Lakshadweep, 
and 
Puducherry). 
The 
states 
of 
Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created 
from existing larger states in 2000, and the state of 
Telangana was created in 2014. For trends from 
1990 onward, the data for these four new states were 
disaggregated from their parent states on the basis of 
data from the districts that now constitute these states. 
The findings are also presented for four groups of states 
based on their epidemiological transition level (ETL), as

described previously.2 Briefly, ETL state groups were 
defined on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from com-
municable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 
to those from non-communicable diseases and injuries 
combined in 2016, with a lower ratio indicating higher 
ETL: low ETL (ratio 0·56–0·75), lower-middle ETL 
(0·41–0·55), higher-middle ETL (0·31–0·40), and high 
ETL (<0·31).2 We have previously reported that epi-
demiological transition ratios of the states of India have a 
significant inverse relation with the Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI) calculated by GBD based on income, 
education, and fertility levels, suggesting broad corre-
spondence between the ETL state groups and socio-
demographic development levels.2
We present findings on deaths and DALYs due to 
chronic respiratory diseases and each of the component 
causes by sex in India in 2016. We present comparisons of 
the prevalence of, and deaths and DALYs due to COPD 
and asthma in the states of India from 1990 to 2016. We 
report age-specific and sex-specific prevalence of COPD 
and asthma in India in 2016. We report the change in 
case-fatality rates for COPD and asthma in the ETL state 
groups from 1990 to 2016. We present the COPD DALYs 
attributable to risk factors in India and at the level of the 
ETL state groups in 2016. Additionally, we assessed the 
ratio of the observed-to-expected DALY rates of COPD 
and asthma in each state as compared with other locations 
worldwide at a similar level of SDI.  We also compared the 
prevalence and DALYs per case of COPD and asthma in 
India versus the global average in GBD 2016.20
We present both crude and age-standardised estimates 
as relevant. Crude estimates provide the actual situation 
in each state, which is useful for policy makers, and age-
standardised estimates allow comparisons over time and 
between states after adjusting for the differences in the 
age structure of the population. Age-standardised rates 
were based on the GBD global reference population.12

respiratory diseases in 2016 and asthma 20·0%. After 
ischaemic heart disease, COPD was the second leading 
cause of disease burden in India,2 contributing 
8·7% (7·8–9·5) of the total deaths and 4·8% (4·3–5·3) of 
the total DALYs. The proportions of deaths and DALYs 
from pneumoconiosis were significantly higher in men 
than in women, but the proportions for COPD, asthma, 
and interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis 
were similar among men and women (table 1).
The crude prevalence of COPD in India in 2016 was 
4·2% (95% UI 4·0–4·4), which was an increase of 29·2% 
(27·9–30·4) from 3·3 (3·1–3·4) in 1990 (table 2). The 
crude prevalence increased significantly from 1990 to 
2016 in all ETL state groups. In 2016, the crude prevalence 
of COPD was highest in the high ETL state group, 
whereas age-standardised prevalence was highest in the 
low ETL state group. The highest crude COPD prevalence 
in an individual state was 2·1 times that of the lowest in 
2016 (figure 1). The crude prevalence was highest in the 
contiguous north Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, 
Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Haryana, which 
were distributed across lower-middle, higher-middle, 
and high ETL state groups. The next highest COPD 
prevalence values were in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh 
(low ETL) and Punjab (high ETL) in the north, Mizoram 
(lower-middle ETL) in the northeast, and Maharashtra, 
Goa, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, 
which belonged to the higher-middle and high ETL state 
groups in the west and south of India. The number of 
COPD cases in India increased from 28·1 million 
(95% UI 27·0–29·2) in 1990 to 55·3 million (53·1–57·6) 
in 2016. The number of COPD cases in each state in 
2016 is shown in the appendix (p 34).
The crude prevalence of asthma in India in 2016 was 
2·9% (95% UI 2·7–3·1%), which was similar to the rate 
in 1990 (table 2). There was no gradient between the ETL 
state groups for either crude or age-standardised asthma 
prevalence in 2016, and there was no significant change 
from 1990 to 2016 for any ETL state group. The ratio of 
highest to lowest prevalence across the states in India 
was 2·0 in 2016. Asthma prevalence in 2016 was highest 
in the northeast states of Sikkim, Tripura, and Nagaland 
(lower-middle ETL), and in southern state of Kerala (high 
ETL) (figure 1). The next highest asthma prevalence was 
in Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal (higher-middle ETL) 
and in Meghalaya (low ETL). The number of asthma 
cases in India increased from 22·9 million (21·5–24·3) 
in 1990 to 37·9 million (35·7–40·2) in 2016. The numbers 
of asthma cases in each state in 2016 are shown in the 
appendix (p 34).
The age-specific prevalence of COPD increased rapidly 
after the age of 30 years, with a greater increase in men 
than in women, reaching the highest prevalence among 
men in the 80 years or older age group (37·8%, 95% UI 
35·7–40·0) and among women in the 75–79 years age 
group (19·7%, 18·5–21·0; figure 2; appendix p 35). 
Asthma prevalence dropped slightly after the age of 
9 years and increased after the age of 25 years, reaching 
the highest prevalence in the 75–79 years age group, at 
12·1% (10·7–13·5) among men and 10·4% (9·1–11·9) 
among women.
The crude case-fatality rate of COPD in India in 
2016 was 1·53% (95% UI 1·44–1·63), which was 
30·9% (17·2–39·2) less than in 1990 (2·2%, 1·88–2·53; 
appendix p 36). There was an increasing gradient in the 
crude and age-standardised COPD case-fatality rate from 
the high ETL state group to the low ETL state group 
(figure 3). The reduction of the crude and age-
standardised COPD case-fatality rates from 1990 to 2016 
was smallest in the low ETL state group (appendix p 36). 
The crude asthma case-fatality rate in India was 
0·48% (0·33–0·62) in 2016, a reduction of 45·9% 
(31·0–59·0) from the rate in 1990 (0·89%, 0·61–1·22). 
However, this rate was significantly higher in the low 
ETL state group than in the high ETL state group in 2016 
(figure 3). The case-fatality rate for asthma also had an 
increasing gradient from the high ETL state group to the 
low ETL state group. The number of COPD deaths in 
India increased from 624 000 (508 000–741 000) in 1990 to 
848 000 (765 000–939 000) in 2016, while the number of

asthma deaths in 2016 was 183 000 (118 000–247 000), 
which was not significantly different from that in 1990.21 
The number of COPD and asthma deaths in each state in 
2016 are shown in the appendix (p 34).
The age-standardised COPD DALY rate in India 
decreased by 36·2% (95% UI 26·1–42·7) from 1990 to 
2016 (appendix p 37). The reduction in crude COPD 
DALY rate during this period was similar across the 
ETL state groups, although the reduction in the age-
standardised DALY rate was lower in the low ETL and 
lower-middle ETL state groups. The age-standardised 
COPD DALY rate in the low ETL state group was 
2·1 times higher than that in the high ETL state group. 
The highest crude COPD DALY rate for an individual 
state was 4·0 times that of the state with the lowest rate 
in 2016 (figure 4). The crude rate was highest in the 
north Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh 
(low ETL) and Uttarakhand (lower-middle ETL), followed 
by Himachal Pradesh (high ETL).
The age-standardised asthma DALY rate in India 
decreased by 54·1% (95% UI 44·0–64·1) from 1990 to 
2016 (appendix p 37). The age-standardised DALY rate of 
asthma in the low ETL state group was 2·4 times higher 
than that in the high ETL state group. The ratio of the 
highest asthma DALY rate to the lowest rate across the 
states of India in 2016 was 3·5 (figure 4). The two large 
north Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh 
(both low ETL) had the highest DALY rate due to asthma.
In 2016, the age-standardised DALY rate due to COPD 
in India was 2·3 times higher than that of other locations 
globally with a similar level of SDI, and the DALY rate of 
asthma was 1·6 times higher. Every state in India except 
Nagaland in the northeast had a higher DALY rate due to 
COPD than the rates globally for their respective levels of 
SDI, and most states had higher DALY rates of asthma 
(figure 5). This ratio of the observed-to-expected DALY 
rates was generally highest in the north Indian states.
Of the COPD DALYs in India in 2016, 53·7% (95% UI 
43·1–65·0) were attributed to air pollution, 25·4% 
(19·5–31·7) to tobacco use, and 16·5% (14·1–19·2) to 
occupational risks, making these the leading risk factors 
for COPD. Among the components of these groups of 
risk factors, 33·6% (21·7–46·7) of COPD DALYs could be 
attributed to ambient air pollution, 25·8% (16·9–39·8) 
to household air pollution, and 21·0% (15·4–27·1) to 
smoking. It is important to note that the cumulative 
impact of the risk factors would be less than the simple 
addition of their individual contributions because the risk

factors overlap. Additionally, the population attributable 
fractions of the individual components can add up to 
more than their sum even if they are independent. The 
proportional contributions of household air pollution 
and second-hand smoke to COPD DALYs were greater 
in women than in men, whereas the contributions of 
smoking and occupational risks were greater in men 
(figure 6). The contribution of household air pollution 
to DALYs due to COPD was larger in the low ETL state 
group, and there was a decreasing gradient for both 
ambient and household air pollution going from the 
low ETL state group to the high ETL state group 
(appendix p 38). There were wide variations between the 
states in terms of the relative contributions of the different 
risk factors for COPD DALYs (appendix p 39). The 
heterogeneity of air pollution exposure and smoking 
prevalence across the states of India have been reported 
elsewhere.2,3,21,22
The age-standardised prevalence of COPD in India was 
1·5 times the global average prevalence in 2016, and the 
age-standardised DALYs per person with COPD were 
1·7 times the global average (appendix p 40).20 The age-
standardised prevalence of asthma in India was 0·7 times 
the global average in 2016, but the age-standardised 
DALYs per person with asthma were 2·4 times the global 
average.20
Discussion
Our findings highlight the increasing contribution of 
chronic respiratory diseases to the disease burden in 
India over the past quarter century, with COPD now 
ranking as the second leading individual cause of disease 
burden in India. With 18% of the global population, India 
has a disproportionately high 32% of the global DALYs 
from chronic respiratory diseases.
In 2016, the prevalence of COPD in India was 4·2% and 
the prevalence of asthma 2·9%. India has a prevalence of 
COPD that is higher than the global average, as well as 
more DALYs per person with COPD or asthma than the 
global average. Most states in India had higher rates of 
DALYs from COPD and asthma compared with locations 
elsewhere in the world at similar levels of SDI. However, 
there were substantial variations between the states. The 
case-fatality rates for COPD and asthma decreased across 
all ETL state groups from 1990 to 2016, but these rates 
were twice as high in the less developed low ETL state 
group than in the high ETL state group in 2016. The 
DALY rate due to COPD varied four times between the 
states, and that of asthma three times. Rajasthan and 
Uttar Pradesh in north India, both of which are in the 
low ETL state group, had the highest DALY rates of 
COPD and asthma in 2016.
From 1990 to 2016, the crude prevalence of COPD in 
India increased by 29% and that of asthma by 9%. 
However, age-standardised prevalence declined by 5% for 
COPD and 4% for asthma. This finding suggests that the 
overall increases in prevalence are mainly due to ageing of 
the population in India. Understanding changes in the 
risk factors for COPD, which makes up three-quarters of 
the chronic respiratory disease burden in India, would be 
instructive for placing the changes in prevalence in 
perspective. The dominant risk factor for COPD in India 
in 2016 was air pollution, which contributed more than 
half the DALYs due to COPD, followed by smoking, which 
contributed a quarter of the COPD DALYs. As described 
previously by the India State-Level Disease Burden 
Initiative, ambient air pollution exposure has increased 
in most parts of India since 1990, whereas exposure 
to household air pollution has decreased because of a 
reduction in the use of solid fuels, although it is still quite 
high.2,3 The prevalence of smoking has also decreased 
in all parts of India since 1990, as reported in an

accompanying Article.22 The mixed pattern of changes in 
these major risk factors for COPD are likely to have played 
a part in the small change in age-standardised prevalence 
of COPD from 1990 to 2016, although there is likely to be 
a range of other factors also that are contributing to this 
trend. There have been increasing attempts in India to 
understand the association between causes other than 
smoking and COPD, given that a substantial portion of 
COPD cases occur in people who have never smoked.23 
Findings from studies in India have identified associations 
between chronic respiratory diseases and non-smoking-
related factors, such as outdoor air pollution from 
particulate matter, indoor air pollution from biomass 
fuels, occupational exposure to crop dust, dust from 
mines, chemicals, poor socioeconomic status, poor 
nutrition, overcrowding, and residence in urban slums.23–25 
From a global perspective, the proportion of COPD DALYs 
attributable to smoking in India is smaller than the global 
average in 2016, whereas the proportion of COPD DALYs 
attributable to air pollution is larger.20
Despite declines in crude and age-standardised DALY 
rates of COPD and asthma, suggesting improvements in 
health care, India still has substantially higher DALYs per 
person with COPD and asthma than the global average. 
This high rate of health loss from COPD is due to issues 
related to its relatively late diagnosis and management, 
even with the improvements in health care over time in 
India. Evidence suggests that COPD is underdiagnosed 
in India, partly because diagnosis is mostly based on 
symptoms rather than spirometry and also because 
symptomatic people are often late in seeking care 
because of insufficient awareness of the disease.26,27 The 
prescription of inhalation devices, which is often needed 
to manage the late stages of COPD, is often perceived as 
a stigma in rural areas.27 Most symptomatic individuals 
tend to seek treatment from the non-formal health 
practitioners of alternative medicines and faith healing, 
who often prescribe harmful and toxic agents. Women at 
the early stages of the disease are less symptomatic than 
men, which, combined with their less common health-
seeking behaviour, poses additional challenges to COPD 
diagnosis.28
The larger than average disease burden per person with 
asthma in India indicates poor management of this disease

in India. This finding is consistent with results from a 
multicentre study done in several different parts of the 
world, which showed that asthma management was worst 
in India among the Asia-Pacific countries studied.29 Unlike 
COPD, which is mostly associated with ageing, asthma 
affects all age groups including school-going children. 
Inadequate clinical knowledge of asthma among practising 
physicians, poor utilisation of diagnostic tools for asthma, 
limited use of inhaled medications, and the existence of 
several misconceptions and misbeliefs in the community 
seem to be the likely contributing factors to the high DALY 
rate per person with asthma in India.29–31 Studies have 
suggested that poor management of asthma in childhood 
also affects lung growth and increases the risk of 
developing COPD at later ages.32 Another challenge in the 
adequate management of asthma is the misclassification 
of asthma as COPD, and vice versa, because their clinical 
features overlap. Furthermore, an asthma–COPD overlap 
syndrome has been described in which patients have 
mixed features of asthma and COPD with air flow 
limitation.33
The National Programme for Prevention and Control 
of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke 
was launched in 2010 and a component for chronic 
respiratory diseases was added later.34 However, this 
respiratory disease component represents a small part 
of the programme, involving only referrals of suspected 
cases to the district hospitals. Important components, 
such as health promotion, early diagnosis, and manage-
ment, are lost in the mix of other non-communicable 
diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
There have been calls for a national programme on the 
control of COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases 
in India so that these diseases can receive attention 
commensurate with their contribution to the disease 
burden.26 A task force of India’s health ministry that 
focuses on comprehensive primary health-care rollout 
proposed in 2014 that health promotion activities, 
screening, and management guidelines for COPD, 
asthma, and pneumoconiosis be included in the service 
packages, in addition to other non-communicable 
diseases.35 These activities related to chronic respiratory 
diseases are yet to be implemented on a large scale. 
There are some examples of efforts by the public sector 
towards the early detection and management of COPD, 
as in the state of Kerala.36 However, much more extensive 
efforts are needed in India to improve early detection 
and management of COPD and asthma. These further 
efforts come in addition to the need for adequate 
measures to reduce exposure to risk factors for these 
major chronic respiratory diseases. Ongoing efforts to 
control smoking and reduce household solid fuel use 
are having positive effects, and these need to be sus-
tained and enhanced.2,3,22,37,38 Additionally, huge multi-
sectoral efforts are needed to reduce the high level of 
exposure to ambient air pollution in all parts of India, 
especially in the northern states.2,3
The general limitations of the GBD methods,12–16 and 
those for chronic respiratory diseases, have been discussed 
previously.1 A limitation specific to India in ascertaining 
the causes of death is an incomplete reporting system for 
medically certified causes of death, which only covers a 
small proportion of deaths and has variable coverage 
between states. This limitation is partly addressed by the 
inclusion of population-based verbal autopsy cause-of-
death data from the Sample Registration System, which 
covers every state.2 Data on COPD and asthma morbidity 
and sequelae have been reported from some states as part 
of the BOLD, INSEARCH, and ISAAC studies,17–19 but are 
not available for many states. When data are scarce, GBD 
uses covariates with known associations with the outcome 
of interest to arrive at the best possible estimates. More 
efforts are needed in India to understand the natural 
history of COPD and asthma in different parts of the 
country. It would also be useful to develop occupational 
health registries to better understand the contribution of 
occupational exposures to chronic respiratory diseases. 
The strengths of the findings presented in this report are 
the use of standardised GBD methodology and the 
inclusion of all accessible data from multiple sources, as 
well as the substantial contributions from a large network 
of experts from India in the analysis and interpretation of 
the findings.
In conclusion, a third of the total global health loss 
from chronic respiratory diseases occurs in India. There 
is marked heterogeneity between the states of India in 
this burden and the associated risks, highlighting the 
need for individual states to adopt different policy 
approaches according to the trajectory of the disease 
burden they are facing. The almost negligible large-scale 
effort to address major chronic respiratory diseases at the 
population level in India must be improved rapidly to 
reduce the current disproportionately high health loss 
from these diseases across India.
