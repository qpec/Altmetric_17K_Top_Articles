Abstract Cladribine is a purine nucleoside analogue that se-
lectively depletes peripheral lymphocytes without a major im-
pact on cells of the innate immune system. An oral formula-
tion of cladribine has been developed to be given as short
courses over two annual cycles. Oral cladribine results in the
peripheral depletion of lymphocytes that is gradual, occurring
over several weeks, and is not associated with a cell lysis
syndrome, has a greater impact on B cells than T cells, and
is followed by gradual reconstitution of the peripheral lym-
phocyte counts over several months. Oral cladribine is effec-
tive in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. As a selective
immune reconstitution therapy (SIRT), cladribine acts as a
short-term immunosuppressant, relative to other maintenance
immunosuppressive therapies that result in long-term immu-
nosuppression. The main safety signal that has emerge relates
primarily to herpes zoster infection, which was more common
in patients with higher grades of lymphopenia, in particular
grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia. Data from the oral cladribine
extension trial and safety register, and reanalysis of the pivotal
phase III trial has indicated that oral cladribine is unlikely to be
associated with an increased short- to intermediate-term risk
of malignancy.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoim-
mune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) character-
ized by inflammation, demyelination, and variable degrees of
axonal loss and gliosis. Inflammation is considered to be a
pivotal component of MS pathology and involves both T
and B cells and their products. Targeted reduction of lympho-
cyte subtypes is a successful therapeutic approach. Cladribine
is a synthetic small molecule that depletes lymphocytes,
which acts both in the periphery and possibly within the
CNS [1–3].
Cladribine, a synthetic purine nucleoside analog, is a
prodrug, that is resistant to deamination by the enzyme aden-
osine deaminase, but which undergoes intracellular phosphor-
ylation by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK). Its active metabolite,
cladribine triphosphate, accumulates within the cell, resulting
in disruption of cellular metabolism, DNA damage and sub-
sequent apoptosis [4, 5]. Cladribine preferentially targets lym-
phocytes owing to their relatively high ratio of DCK to 5’-
nucleotidase, producing rapid and sustained reductions in
CD4+ and CD8+ cells and rapid, though more transient, effects
on CD19+ B cells. Cladribine is relatively sparing of other
immune cells [4, 5]. Cladribine was developed as a result of
the understanding of the molecular basis of the genetic disease
adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. In this condition,
children experience severe immunodeficiency resulting from
accumulation of toxic deoxyadenosine nucleotides in lympho-
cytes [2, 4]. The effects of cladribine mimic the intracellular
process that occurs in ADA deficiency. Parenteral cladribine is
licensed for the treatment of active hairy-cell leukemia; exten-
sive clinical experience with cladribine in oncology has been
accumulated over >3 decades.

 Cladribine’s mechanism of action provided the rationale to
develop cladribine tablets as a potential agent for the treatment
of MS. In clinical trials, cladribine has been found to be active
in patients with relapsing–remitting forms of MS (RRMS) [3,
6, 7]. Reductions in lymphocyte counts are accompanied by
reductions in proinflammatory cytokines, serum, and cerebro-
spinal fluid chemokine levels, adhesion molecule expression,
and mononuclear cell migration [8–11].
Following the encouraging results with short treatment
courses of parenteral cladribine in patients with MS [3, 6, 7],
an oral tablet formulation was developed. The efficacy and safe-
ty of cladribine tablets were investigated in a 96-week, phase III,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal trial in pa-
tients with RRMS: the CLARITY (CLAdRIbine tablets
Treating multiple sclerosis orallY) study (clinicaltrials.gov iden-
tifier: NCT00213135, EudraCT number: 2004-005148-28)
[12]. Cladribine tablets differ from currently available MS treat-
ments because they are given as short-course orally, requiring
only 8 to 10 days of treatment per 48-week cycle.
This article will review the mechanism of action of
cladribine tablets, summarize data from clinical trials in pa-
tients with MS, and provide guidance on the management of
these patients in clinical practice.
Mechanism of Action
The cladribine molecule (also referred to as 2-CdA) is an aden-
osine analogue, which enters cells via specific nucleoside trans-
porter proteins. Cladribine acts as a prodrug, and its activity is
dependent on the intracellular accumulation of its active tri-
phosphate, which occurs preferentially in certain cell types
[13]. Three intracellular enzymes play a key role in determining
the availability of its active form (Fig. 1), 2-CdATP: 1) DCK
(catalyzes the first of the 3 phosphorylation steps required to
convert cladribine into its biologically active nucleotide triphos-
phate, 2-CdATP; 2) 5’-nucleotidase (5’-NTase) (catalyzes the
reconversion of phosphorylated cladribine to the cladribine nu-
cleoside; 3) ADA (in addition to dephosphorylation by 5’-
NTase, deamination by ADA can also remove phosphorylated
nucleotides via deamination by ADA; however, cladribine is
resistant to deamination by ADA owing to the substitution of a
hydrogen atom by a chlorine atom).
The accumulation of the active 2-CdATP compound is
dependent on the ratio of DCK, which creates it, to 5’-
NTases, which break it down [13]. This ratio varies between
different cell types. Data from mRNA profiling studies in the
public domain (BioGPS Database) [14] show that levels of
DCK and the ratio of DCK:5’-NTases are high in T cells
(CD4+, CD8+), B cells, and dendritic cells. In contrast, ratios
are very low in numerous nonhematological cell types, includ-
ing liver, heart, skin, brain, lung, kidney, ovarian, testicular,
and germ cells. This results in selective accumulation of
CdATP in lymphocytes, allowing cladribine to preferentially
target these cells [15]. As the active compound 2-CdATP
builds up within lymphocytes, it results in inhibition of
DNA synthesis and repair, disruption of cellular proliferation
in actively dividing lymphocytes, and apoptosis and/or au-
tophagy of quiescent lymphocytes through the accumulation
of DNA strand breaks [15–18]. Alteration of cytokine patterns
and induction of T-helper T-related cytokines may also con-
tribute to the sustained effects of cladribine tablets seen in
clinical trials [19].
Early Studies
Cladribine has been used extensively in a variety of hemato-
logical disorders [20, 21]. Parenteral cladribine is used as a
treatment for hairy cell leukemia [15]. Cladribine has been
investigated in several other autoimmune disorders, including
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus-
associated glomerulonephritis [6, 22, 23]. Parenteral
cladribine has been evaluated in both relapsing and progres-
sive forms of MS. Three randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group, placebo-controlled, phase II/III trials have been con-
ducted at the Scripps Research Institute (Scripps-C, MS-
Scripps, and MS-001) [5, 7, 24]. In the placebo-controlled
phases of these studies, 183 patients received intravenous or
subcutaneous cladribine, at doses of 0.7 to 2.8 mg/kg, admin-
istered in monthly 5 to 7-day courses for 2 to 6 months, and
were followed for up to 24 months [24]. In all studies, paren-
teral cladribine was associated with a statistically significant
improvement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures
of disease activity regardless of dosing regimen or route of
administration [24]. In the 18-month Scripps-C study, patients
with RRMS received cladribine, 2.1 mg/kg subcutaneously, or
placebo, and were followed for a further 12 months [7].
Treatment with parenteral cladribine led to a significant reduc-
tion in the number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions at 12
months compared with placebo (p = 0.0001), which remained
significantly lower at 18 months (p = 0.002) [7]. There was a
significant reduction in a combined measure of the frequency
and severity of relapses in patients receiving cladribine com-
pared with those receiving placebo from months 7 to 12 (p =
0.021), which was maintained at month 18 (p = 0.010) [7].
Patients with progressive forms of MS received parenteral
cladribine in the 12- month MS-001 and 24-month treatment
crossover MS-Scripps studies [5, 24]. In MS-001, cladribine
(0.7 or 2.1 mg/kg) reduced the number and volume of T1 Gd-
enhancing lesions (p < 0.003) [5]. Prior to treatment crossover
in the MS-Scripps study (after 12 months), significantly fewer
patients receiving cladribine (2.8 mg/kg) than placebo had
Gd-enhancing lesions: 2 of 24 patients receiving cladribine
and 12 of 24 receiving placebo had Gd-enhancing lesions (p
< 0.001) [24]. Furthermore, disability and neurological

 performance scores were significantly better in patients re-
ceiving cladribine than in those receiving placebo (p <0.01
and p <0.001, respectively) [24]. These latter results are diffi-
cult to interpret as patients with both secondary and primary
progressive MS were included.
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
These parenteral studies showed encouraging results, which
led to the development of an oral tablet form of cladribine.
Oral cladribine is rapidly absorbed with a Cmax that is reached
within 30–50 min of oral administration [25]. Oral bioavail-
ability is between 37% and 51% and food intake does not
significantly affect absorption of cladribine [25, 26]. Up to
20% of cladribine is plasma protein bound [25]. The metabo-
lism is not extensive; after oral administration 25 ± 21% of a
dose is excreted unchanged in urine and 3.8 ± 1.9% as a
metabolite [27]. Importantly in the context of MS cladribine
is able to cross the blood–brain barrier, reaching a concentra-
tion in the cerebrospinal fluid of approximately 25% of that in
the periphery. This should allow lymphocyte levels to be re-
duced at sites of focal inflammation in the brain, as well as in
the periphery [28]. Cladribine has preferential and sustained
activity in lymphocytes, reducing the circulating populations
most notably for CD4+ lymphocytes, CD8+ lymphocytes, and
B lymphocytes, with effects sustained for ≥ 10 months follow-
ing the last dose of either parenteral cladribine [5, 24, 29] or
oral cladribine tablets [30], which is likely due to cladribine’s
effect on both resting and actively dividing lymphocytes, in-
cluding quiescent progenitor cells [1, 31]. This prolonged re-
covery of lymphocyte populations allows for infrequent dos-
ing and underpins the strategy of using an annual short-course
treatment schedule. Cladribine has comparatively mild, tran-
sient effects on innate immune cells such as neutrophils fol-
lowing parenteral administration [5], an effect that was ob-
served in the subsequent clinical trial of cladribine tablets
[30]. This should allow, at least theoretically, relative preser-
vation of an immunocompetent state [32].
The Phase III CLARITY Study
A pivotal phase III trial (CLARITY) placebo-controlled study
was completed of cladribine tablets as monotherapy in RRMS
[12] (Tables 1 and 2). In this 96-week trial, cladribine tablet
therapy was studied as an annual short-course oral therapy for
RRMS. Patients were assigned 1:1:1 to receive a cumulative
dose over the 96-week study of either cladribine 3.5 mg/kg,
cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, or placebo. Treatment was adminis-
tered orally as short courses, where each course consisted of
once-daily dosing for 4 to 5 days. Patients received 2 or 4 short
courses at 28-day intervals at the start of each 48-week treat-
ment period. Eligible patients had RRMS [33], with lesions
consistent with MS confirmed in prestudy MRI scans accord-
ing to the Fazekas criteria [34], at least 1 relapse within 12

 months of study entry, and an Expanded Disability Status
Scale score between 0 and 5.5. The primary endpoint was
the rate of relapses at 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included
proportion of patients who were relapse-free, time to sustained
progression of disability, time to first relapse, proportion of
patients receiving rescue therapy, MRI endpoints, and safety
assessments. In total, 1326 patients were enrolled, 1184 com-
pleted the full 96 weeks of study, and 1165 completed treat-
ment [12]. Demographics and baseline characteristics were
generally well balanced between groups, although mean du-
ration of disease was shorter in patients in the cladribine 3.5
mg/kg group (p < 0.05 for the overall comparison across treat-
ment groups). Approximately 70% of patients had not re-
ceived prior disease-modifying drugs (DMDs). Of 456, 433,
and 437 patients randomized to 5.25 or 3.5 mg/kg cladribine
tablets or placebo, respectively, 87% to 92% completed the
96-week study and 86% to 91% completed full-course treat-
ment to week 52. The respective rates of treatment compliance
(i.e., the number of tablets taken relative to the number of
tablets expected to be taken) were 99.7%, 99.9%, and
99.8%, and the median time in study was longer with
cladribine 5.25 or 3.5 mg/kg than placebo at 41.2 and 43.0
versus 36.1 weeks, respectively.
Clinical Efficacy
The annualized relapse rates (ARR) at 96 weeks were signif-
icantly reduced in both cladribine tablets groups versus place-
bo (0.14, 0.15, and 0.33 in the 3.5 mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg and
placebo groups, respectively, for relative reductions of 57.6%
and 54.5% vs placebo, respectively; each p < 0.001) [12]
(Tables 1 and 3). Early benefit of treatment effect was seen,
with significantly lower relapse rates in both cladribine arms
versus placebo by 16 weeks. The advantage of cladribine tab-
lets over placebo in reducing ARR was seen across a range of
clinically important patient subgroups in post-hoc analyses,
when patients were stratified by factors including age, sex,
prior DMD use, and baseline disease severity [35]. A signifi-
cantly higher percentage of patients remained relapse-free at
96 weeks in both cladribine tablets groups versus placebo
[79.7% and 78.9% of patients in the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/
kg groups were relapse-free, respectively, vs 60.9% in the
placebo group (each p < 0.001 vs placebo)] [12]. Time to first
relapse was significantly longer in both the cladribine tablets
groups compared with placebo (each p < 0.001). In the place-
bo group, the fifteenth percentile of time to event was 4.6
months versus 13.4 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.44] and
13.3 months (HR 0.46) in the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg
groups, respectively. Significantly more patients in the place-
bo group required rescue therapy compared with those receiv-
ing cladribine tablet treatment [6.2% in the placebo group vs
2.5% (p < 0.001 for the comparison) and 2.0% (p = 0.003) in
the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups, respective-
ly]. The time from last dose to rescue therapy was similar
across groups, with a median of 178 (range –4 to 678) days
for 5.25 mg/kg, 131 (range 60–300) days for 3.5 mg/kg, and
163 (range 31–592) days for placebo. Time to 3-month
sustained change in Expanded Disability Status Scale score
was significantly longer in patients receiving cladribine tablets
treatment [13.6 months in each cladribine arm vs 10.8 months
with placebo; HR 0.67 (p = 0.02) in the 3.5 mg/kg group and
HR 0.69 (p = 0.03) in the 5.25 mg/kg group]. The odds of
remaining free of 3-month disability progression were in-
creased in both the cladribine treatment groups versus placebo
[odds ratio (OR) 1.55 (p = 0.02) and OR 1.46 (p = 0.03) in the
3.5 mg/kg and 5/25 mg/kg groups, respectively].
MRI analyses at 96 weeks showed relative reductions in
T1 Gd-enhancing lesions with cladribine in the 3.5 and 5.25
mg/kg groups of 85.7% and 87.9%, respectively, versus
placebo (both p < 0.001) [12, 36]. Relative reductions in
active T2 lesions of 73.4% and 76.9% were observed with
cladribine tablets therapy in the 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups,
respectively, versus placebo (both p < 0.001). Relative re-
ductions of 74.4% and 77.9% in combined unique lesions
were observed with cladribine tablets therapy in the 3.5 and
5.25 mg/kg groups, respectively, versus placebo (both p <
0.001). Significant improvements in MRI outcomes were
consistently observed in clinically relevant patient sub-
groups stratified according to baseline disease severity
[37]. When stratified by baseline relapse rate, the relative
reductions in combined unique lesions/patient/scan for the
3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups were 74.8% and 75.5% (≤ 1
relapse), 83.1% and 86.7% (2 relapses), and 76.7% and
90.0% (≥ 3 relapses), respectively (all p < 0.001).
Similarly, relative reductions were 73.5% and 75.2% for
patients without T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, and
80.8% and 84.9% for patients with ≥ 1 T1 Gd-enhancing
lesion(s) at baseline, respectively (all p < 0.001) [37].
Disease activity-free status, or NEDA (no evident disease
activity), a composite measure of efficacy, was analyzed post-
hoc and confirmed the efficacy findings [38]. In the cladribine
tablets 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg versus placebo groups, respective-
ly, 67.3% and 69.7% versus 38.9% of patients were disease
activity-free over 24 weeks; 54.2% and 56.1% versus 23.9%
over 48 weeks; and 44.2% and 46.0% versus 15.8% over the
entire 96-week study (all p < 0.001 for active treatments vs
placebo) [38]. Significant differences between cladribine tab-
lets and placebo disease activity-free status were seen across
patient subgroups, including patients who had received prior
disease-modifying therapy (37.2% and 42.9% for cladribine
tablets 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg vs 16.2% for placebo) and treat-
ment-naïve patients (45.0% and 45.0% vs 15.9%); patients
with baseline disease duration < 3 years (38.1% and 46.5%
vs 8.2%), 3 to 10 years (47.0% and 40.3% vs 15.5%), and > 10
years (41.8% and 47.8% vs 22.1%) (all p < 0.001 for active

 treatments vs placebo) [38]. ORs for patients remaining dis-
ease activity-free with cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25
mg/kg treatment versus placebo were 3.99 [95% confidence
interval (CI) 2.89–5.49] and 4.24 (95% CI 3.09–5.82), respec-
tively (each p < 0.001) [38].
In the CLARITY study, the effect of 2 years’ treatment on
annualized percentage brain volume change (PBVC/y) was
evaluated. Compared with placebo (–0.70% ± 0.79), PBVC/y
was reduced in patients treated with cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/
kg (–0.56% ± 0.68; p = 0.010) and 5.25 mg/kg (–0.57% ± 0.72;
p = 0.019) [39]. In this analysis, after adjusting for treatment
group, PBVC/y showed a significant correlation with the cu-
mulative probability of disability progression (HR 0.67, 95%
CI 0.571–0.787; p < 0.001), with patients with lower PBVC/y
showing the highest probability of remaining free from disabil-
ity progression at 2 years and vice versa [39].
Considerations for Patient Management
The efficacy and safety findings in the CLARITY study were
associated with additional benefits in reducing healthcare re-
source utilization [41]. In a comparison of resource use across
treatment arms, the outcomes observed during the CLARITY
study were associated with a reduced consumption of
healthcare resources and a decreased need for medical and
societal support, suggesting a potential economic benefit of
treatment with cladribine tablets [41]. Compared with place-
bo, the mean number of hospital days per patient over 96
weeks was 3.90 days and 1.92 days fewer in the cladribine
tablets 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups, respectively (both p
< 0.01) [41]. The number of emergency room visits, clinic
visits, and missed work days was also significantly lower for
both cladribine tablets treatment arms compared with placebo.
Additionally, corticosteroid use was lower amongst patients in
the cladribine tablets groups than in the placebo group (mainly
owing to fewer relapses) [41].
Comparing CLARITY with CLARITY Extension
A post-hoc analysis evaluated the longitudinal effect of
cladribine tablets by comparing key outcomes in treatment
groups at the end of CLARITY Extension with the outcomes
in the same patients at the end of CLARITY (i.e., comparing
the same patients at different times). This showed that ARR
and the proportion of relapse-free patients were broadly sim-
ilar between CLARITY and CLARITY Extension (Fig. 2A,
B). In patients randomized to placebo in CLARITY
Extension, the benefits of treatment with cladribine tablets in
CLARITY were largely maintained. As expected, patients
randomized to placebo in CLARITY (for ethical reasons,
these patients were allocated to cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg
during CLARITY Extension) showed significant improve-
ments in ARR and the proportion of relapse-free patients [42].
Lymphocyte Counts During CLARITY
and CLARITY Extension
Immunosuppressive agents like cladribine have pronounced
effects on immune function, and it is relevant to assess the
effects of treatment on lymphocyte counts. Analysis of pooled
data from patients treated with cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg in
CLARITYand CLARITY Extension showed rapid reductions
in absolute lymphocyte counts in the first and second years of
active treatment, followed by a gradual return to the normal
range towards the end of each treatment period with median
lymphocyte counts within the normal range from the end of
the second year of treatment onwards (Fig. 3) [43].
Considered in the context of the durable outcomes obtained
in CLARITY Extension (Fig. 2), these findings indicate that
the lasting efficacy of cladribine tablets occurs against a back-
ground of significant changes in lymphocyte counts and sub-
populations [43] .
ORACLE-MS
The ORAl CLadribine for Early MS (ORACLE-MS) study
assessed the use of cladribine tablets in patients with early
disease (clinically isolated syndrome), who were at high risk
of conversion to MS. ORACLE-MS was a 2-year (96-week)
randomized, double-blind study in patients who had experi-
enced a first demyelinating event [44] (Table 1). Although the
ORACLE study was terminated early by the study sponsor,
because of a negative regulatory decision in relation the
CLARITY data, compared with placebo, cladribine 3.5 and
5.25 mg/kg significantly delayed conversion to clinically def-
inite MS using Poser criteria (primary efficacy endpoint; p <
0.0001 for each), and the 2005 McDonald criteria (main sec-
ondary endpoint; p < 0.0001 for each) [44].
Safety and Tolerability
Cladribine tablets have a safety and tolerability profile that has
been established and shown to be consistent across several studies
(Tables 4 and 5). In CLARITY and CLARITY Extension, ap-
proximately 90% of actively treated patients completed each
study, and there were relatively few study discontinuations due
to AEs [12, 45, 46]. Most AEs in each study were classed as mild
or moderate, and most occurred at similar frequencies across
treatment groups, with the exception of lymphopenia, which
was higher in groups treated with cladribine tablets [45, 46].
The early termination of ORACLE-MS means that the rate of

 discontinuations cannot be compared with CLARITY and
CLARITY Extension. In general, the incidence and severity of
AEs (most were classed as mild or moderate) in ORACLE-MS
was comparable acrosstreatment groups, except for lymphopenia,
which was higher in groups treated with cladribine tablets.
AEs of Special Interest
Lymphopenia
Lymphopenia is an expected event based upon cladribine’s
mechanism of action, but efforts should be made to avoid se-
vere, sustained lymphopenia. A retrospective analysis of
CLARITY showed that severe lymphopenia could be avoided
or reduced by using retreatment guidelines. Severe lymphopenia
was not observed in patients who had a normal absolute lym-
phocyte count at CLARITY baseline and who recovered to
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 0 or
1 lymphocyte counts before retreatment with cladribine tablets.
The efficacy of cladribine tablets in terms of reducing ARR in
these patients was comparable with the overall intent-to-treat
population in CLARITY [47]. The benefits of this approach
are illustrated in a year-by-year analysis of lymphopenia by
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade in
CLARITY and CLARITY Extension. In patients who were
treated with cladribine tablets 3.5mg/kg in CLARITY and with
cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY Extension according
to retreatment guidelines, > 85% of patients had recovered to
grade 0 or 1 lymphocyte counts and no patients had grade 4
lymphopenia at the end of each treatment year [43]. Treatment
with cladribine tablets was associated with significant reductions
in lymphocyte subtypes implicated in the pathogenesis of MS.
The largest and most rapid reduction was in numbers of CD19+
B lymphocytes, which showed a nadir approximately 13 weeks
after dosing and recovery towards the normal range from 24 to
48 weeks after dosing [43, 48]. Moderate, proportional reduc-
tions in T-lymphocyte counts occurred after treatment with
cladribine tablets, with CD8+ cells showing a smaller decrease
and faster recovery than CD4+ cells [43, 48]. The clear dose
effect in relation to T-lymphocyte depletion, but not B cells,
suggests that cladribine’s mode of action is more likely to be
due to its effect on B cells. It should be noted that at the end of
CLARITY, counts of CD19+ cells had recovered to within the
normal range, and showed no sign of significant overshoot [48],
a phenomenon observed with other immunosuppressant thera-
pies like alemtuzumab [48].
Infections
In CLARITYand CLARITY Extension, incidence rates of the
most common infections, including severe infections, were
similar across groups, including patients treated with placebo.
The only exception to this was herpes zoster, which was more
frequently observed in patients treated with cladribine tablets
than with placebo [12, 45, 46].
Malignancies
In CLARITY, the incidence of neoplasms (including benign,
malignant, or unspecified) reported as a serious AE was slight-
ly higher in patients treated with cladribine tablets 3.5 and
5.25 mg/kg (1.4% and 0.9%, respectively) than with placebo
(0.0%) [12]. In CLARITY Extension, the incidence of malig-
nant or unspecified tumors population was 1.4% across all
groups in the safety population. No clustering of malignancies
with a common origin, and no hematological malignancies
associated with immunosuppression was seen [12].
In ORACLE-MS, the incidence of neoplasms (benign, ma-
lignant, or unspecified) was lower in the cladribine tablets 3.5
and 5.25 mg/kg groups (<1.0% and 1.0%, respectively) than
in the placebo group (3.0%) [44]. Data from CLARITY and
ORACLE-MS were included in an independent meta-analysis
of malignancy rates in phase III clinical trials of DMDs in
patients with RRMS. This found that the cancer rate was not
increased versus treatment groups in other studies, and the risk
difference for cladribine tablets versus placebo was not higher
compared with DMDs in other studies [49]. The follow-up of
979 patients treated with cladribine for hairy cell leukemia, for
a median of 5.1 years, reported an observed to expected fre-
quency of secondary tumors of 1.50 (95% CI 1.14–1.93),
indicating a significant (p < 0.05) increase in risk for patients
treated with cladribine compared with a normal population
[50]. The 61 malignancies were most commonly lymphoma
(n = 13 patients), prostate (n = 16), gastrointestinal (n = 6),
breast (n = 5), bladder (n = 3), and lung (n = 3), and also CNS,
stomach, ovary, melanoma, sarcoma, testicular, and myeloid
leukemias [50]. However, these values are consistent with the
increase already associated with hairy cell leukemia, which
led to the conclusion that cladribine can be administered to
patients with hairy cell leukemia without a significantly in-
creased risk of secondary malignancies [50].
The apparent increased rate of malignancy in the
CLARITY study and the fact that only one pivotal phase III
study was initially submitted was the primary reason the
European Medicine Agency did not approve oral cladribine
in 2011. However, the analysis of the second phase III study
(ORACLE), follow-on safety data from a safety register
(PREMIERE study), epidemiological data indicating that
there is no clear increased risk of secondary malignancy with
cladribine, a modified dosing schedule to reduce the risk of
persistent grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia, and a change in the
regulatory environment led to a successful resubmission and
licensing by the European Medicine Agency of oral cladribine
for the treatment for relapsing MS in 2017. The latter explains
Cladribine to Treat Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis
881
 why the oral cladribine development programme took so long
to complete.
Deaths
There were 4 deaths during the study and 2 deaths after pa-
tients were withdrawn from study (withdrawals had been due
to AEs); the 6 deaths were equally distributed across the 3
treatment groups [40]. Causes of death during the study were
suicide (placebo), hemorrhagic stroke (placebo), acute myo-
cardial infarction (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg), and drowning
(cladribine 5.25 mg/kg) [40]. Causes of death following study
withdrawal were metastatic pancreatic carcinoma (cladribine
3.5 mg/kg group) and acute cardiopulmonary arrest
(cladribine 5.25 mg/kg) [40]. The patient who died from met-
astatic pancreatic carcinoma was a 61-year-old woman in the
3.5 mg/kg group who was discontinued from the study fol-
lowing her week-72 visit due gastrointestinal and constitu-
tional symptoms. She was subsequently diagnosed with met-
astatic pancreatic carcinoma and initiated chemotherapy but
died about 3 months after diagnosis [40]. The acute cardio-
pulmonary arrest was considered to be related to an exacer-
bation of pre-existing tuberculosis. A 21-year-old woman in
the 5.25 mg/kg group received a single treatment course of
cladribine tablets (0.875 mg/kg); approximately 1 week after
her last dose of cladribine she developed pancytopenia after
which she was permanently withdrawn from treatment. A
second episode of pancytopenia occurred approximately 2

 months after the end of cladribine treatment. A chest X-ray at
this stage showed bilateral alveolar-interstitial infiltrates and a
bone marrow biopsy performed 6 days later showed Bslight
myelodysplasia^. At approximately 5 months after the last
dose of cladribine tablets, the patient experienced a third ep-
isode of pancytopenia. A chest X-ray showed recurrent bilat-
eral alveolar-interstitial lung infiltrates and a repeat bone mar-
row examination revealed an apparent myelodysplastic syn-
drome. The patient died from an acute cardiopulmonary arrest
approximately 6 months after receiving a single 0.875 mg/kg
treatment course of cladribine. The diagnosis of tuberculosis
was obtained postmortem, and the chronic pathological na-
ture of lesions in the liver and lungs, together with the tem-
poral relationship between treatment and acute onset of
symptoms, suggested that the tuberculosis was long-
standing and present prior to cladribine treatment [40].
Cladribine therapy is likely to have contributed to the wors-
ening of the tuberculosis infection. The myelodysplasia-like
condition was probably reactive bone marrow changes
caused by the chronic tuberculosis infection and upon review
this was determined not to be a case of true myelodysplastic
syndrome as there were no cytogenetic abnormalities and its
presentation was not consistent with the natural history of
myelodysplasia [40].
Pregnancies
Contraception was specified for women and men of childbear-
ing potential during clinical trials with cladribine tablets; how-
ever, pregnancies have occurred. A small number of pregnan-
cies occurred during CLARITY [12], and CLARITY
Extension (Cladribine-Placebo 3.5 mg/kg, n = 1; Placebo-
Cladribine 3.5 kg/mg, n = 2), but the outcomes were not re-
ported. In ORACLE-MS, 7 pregnancies were reported (place-
bo, n = 3; cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg, n = 1; cladribine tablets
5.25 mg/kg, n = 3), 5 of which resulted in the birth of healthy
infants (1 patient in the placebo group had a spontaneous
abortion, and the outcome was unknown in 1 patient treated
with cladribine tablets 5.25 mg/kg). It was also reported that
the partners of 4 male patients in ORACLE-MS became preg-
nant (1 in each active treatment group and 2 in the placebo
group). The outcomes of the placebo-group pregnancies were
unknown, but the 2 pregnancies in patients treated with
cladribine tablets resulted in the birth of healthy infants [44].

 attenuated live vaccines is contraindicated. Cladribine tablets
are administered during very short treatment courses and the
use of live or attenuated live vaccines should be avoided dur-
ing treatment, and afterwards for as long as patients’ white
blood cell counts are not within normal limits.
Follow-On Studies
To provide long-term safety data all patients who have partic-
ipated in clinical trials of oral cladribine are eligible for the
PREMIERE study (the PRospective observational long-term
safEty registry of MS patIEnts who have participated in clin-
ical trials with cladRibinE tablets) [51].
Conclusion
In an increasingly complex and competitive treatment land-
scape oral cladribine is likely to be used in patients that are
medication-naïve and as switch therapy in patients with sub-
optimal control of their disease on another DMT or with poor
tolerance of their existing DMT. The posology of oral
cladribine as a pulsed immune reconstitution therapy (IRT)
with effectiveness beyond 2 years of treatment may make in
an attractive option to some patients, for example women
wanting to start and/or extend their families. Oral cladribine
will need to used carefully after other immune-depleting ther-
apies to reduce the risk of long-term lymphopenia. Similarly,
the slow reconstitution of lymphocyte subsets after oral
cladribine has implications for sequencing of therapies post-
cladribine. Finally, the availability of relatively cheap generic
parenteral cladribine may allow people with MS living in
resource-poor environments easier access to an effective
DMT albeit it not the licensed oral formulation.
