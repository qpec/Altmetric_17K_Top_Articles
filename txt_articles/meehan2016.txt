Among hospitalized patients, malnutrition is prevalent yet often overlooked and undertreated. We
implemented a quality improvement program that positioned early nutritional care into the nursing
workflow. Nurses screened for malnutrition risk at patient admission and then immediately ordered
oral nutritional supplements for those at risk. Supplements were given as regular medications,
guided and monitored by medication administration records. Post–quality improvement program,
pressure ulcer incidence, length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and costs of care were reduced.
Key words: malnutrition, medication administration record, nutrition, nutrition risk screen-
ing, oral nutritional supplements, quality improvement

disease-associated malnutrition is a com-

malnutrition or its risk occurs in as many
as 50% of patients admitted to hospitals in
the United States and around the world.1-3
Yet, malnutrition is often overlooked and

(traditional preparation for surgery, missed
mealtimes for medical procedures, and NPO
(nil per os) orders,7 insufficient hospital
staffing or education about nutrition care,8
and patients’ disease-related barriers to food
intake (disease-related anorexia, too tired to
eat, or feeding difficulties).6,9 Older adults
are particularly vulnerable to undernutrition
or specific nutrient deficiencies because they
often have diseases and disabilities that limit
dietary intake.3,10-12
Malnutrition has negative impacts on pa-
tients and the health care system, leading
to more complications, slowed recovery, and
higher costs of care. Study results show that
malnourished hospital patients, compared
with their adequately nourished peers, are
more likely to experience pressure ulcers,13
postsurgical infections,14,15 and falls16 and are
at greater risk for death.17,18 These adverse
outcomes contribute to the excessive finan-
cial burden on our health care system in the
form of costly complications, longer hospital
stays, and more frequent readmissions.2,19,20
Nutrition screening and interventions (eg,
oral nutritional supplements [ONS]) have
proven effective for improving patient out-
comes and reducing overall costs of care
for patients who are malnourished or at risk
for malnutrition.21-28 For example, several
studies of hospitalized patients showed that
nutrition screening and assessment, when
followed by intervention as needed, could
shorten length of stay (LOS) by at least
2 days.24,28,29
Given their integral role during a patient’s
hospital stay, nurses are ideally positioned to
identify patients at risk for malnutrition and
facilitate their treatment.30-32 A nurse-led pro-
gram was initiated at Akron General Medi-
cal Center ([AGMC], Akron, Ohio), a Magnet
hospital and level 1 trauma center, and a re-
cent addition to the Cleveland Clinic Health
System, to update the hospital nutrition care
process and streamline its delivery. The pro-
gram followed a quality improvement pro-
gram (QIP), starting with the establishment
of an interdisciplinary core team. The team’s
objectives were to (1) identify specific pro-
cess reforms to improve the efficiency and
rate of providing nutritional support for pa-
tients admitted to AGMC, and (2) determine
whether such reforms would lead to positive
outcomes, both clinical and economic.
METHODS
Quality improvement nutrition team
An interdisciplinary quality improvement
(QI) team was assembled to evaluate and re-
vise the hospital process for nutrition screen-
ing and intervention. The number of team
members varied over time, ranging from 7 to
20, depending on activities in different phases
of the QI project. Members represented the
following departments, all of which were
relevant to the nutrition administration pro-
cess: nursing, nutrition (dietitians), adminis-
tration, pharmacy, data analysis and research,
information technology, and medicine (physi-
cians). The team’s review of the literature re-
vealed that use of ONS during hospitalization
can benefit patients who are malnourished
or at risk of malnutrition.25,27,33,34 Ultimately,
the team developed a system in which nurses
screened patients’ nutritional status on admis-
sion and prescribed ONS for those at malnutri-
tion risk. The ONS prescription was recorded
in the electronic medical record (EMR) and
was linked to the medication administration
record (MAR), which, in turn, sent cues to
the nurse for ONS dose, delivery, and record
of compliance.
Population, intervention, outcomes
measured
We used retrospective medical record au-
dits to assess treatments and outcomes for
adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to
AGMC between 2011 and 2013. We com-
pared records of patients admitted between
July and December 2011 with those admitted
between July and December 2013. The QI
intervention with medication pass ONS im-
plementation occurred in January 2012. We
chose the second half of 2013 as the postin-
tervention period to provide sufficient time
for the intervention to become standard of
care, and we compared similar time periods

(second half of 2011 and 2013) to control for
potential seasonal differences.
Nutritional risk was determined using the
Malnutrition Screening Tool.35 Prior to the QI
changes, patients were screened by nurses,
and those with malnutrition risk were referred
to a dietitian for nutrition assessment, who
would then write recommendations for nu-
tritional support pending physician approval.
Post-QI, nurses continued to screen patients
for malnutrition risk, but when risk was iden-
tified, nurses ordered intervention with ONS.
The nurse’s order was entered in the EMR.
The EMR automatically transmitted the ONS
prescription to the MAR and also notified
the dietitian to evaluate the patient and val-
idate the prescription. The EMR order then
electronically cued the MAR for prompt start
of medication pass ONS. ONS portions (∼90
mL/dose; Ensure Complete, Abbott Nutrition)
were given to patients 3 times each day for the
total target intake volume of 1 serving per day.
We assessed the following outcomes: (1)
time from nutrition screening to initiation of
nutrition intervention (for patients at risk of
malnutrition); (2) use of ONS by at-risk pa-
tients; (3) hospital-acquired pressure ulcers
(HAPUs); (4) hospital LOS; (5) rate of hospi-
tal readmission (within 30 days); and (6) cost
per hospitalization episode (inflation-adjusted
to 2013 dollars).
Data collection and statistical analyses
Outcomes were tabulated retrospectively
from records of patients admitted either be-
fore or after the QIP was implemented. As a
Magnet hospital, our facility routinely com-
piles data on pressure ulcers as a nurse-
sensitive quality indicator (National Database
of Nursing Quality Indicators [NDNQI]).
The proportion of admitted patients using
ONS pre-QIP was compared with the post-QIP
proportion using a 2-sample t test. For LOS,
readmissions, and hospitalization costs, mean
values with standard errors were calculated.
The sample was divided into 2 groups based
on patients’ primary diagnoses. We placed pa-
tients with the 10 diagnoses most commonly
treated with ONS in a nutrition-sensitive
group, and all other patients were placed in
the control group. A difference-in-difference
methodology was used to assess the impact of
the intervention and control for potential con-
founders. We hypothesized that if the QIP was
successful, we would see a greater change
in the nutrition-sensitive group, those with
diagnoses amenable to treatment by ONS,
than in the control group. Statistical differ-
ences were determined by means comparison
t tests.
RESULTS
Patients
Hospital records of nearly 20 000 patients
were evaluated retrospectively. The age range
was from 18 to 111 years, with an overall
mean age of 59 years, and there were slightly
more women than men (Table 1).
QIP reduced time to ONS initiation
For pre-QI measurement of time to ONS, we
conducted a retrospective chart audit of 30 pa-
tients admitted to the neuroscience unit. The
average time from identification of malnutri-
tion risk to the patient receiving intervention
was 2.3 days. Post-QI, the wait time for ONS
initiation was reduced to less than 24 hours.
Thus, having the nurse order ONS reduced
delay time by more than 1 day.
Administration of ONS to patients
increased
Comparing post-QI with pre-QI practices,
the proportion of patients receiving ONS in-
creased significantly (P < .01) by 33%: from
6.1% of total (613/10 106 pre-QI) to 8.1%
(794/9761 post-QI).
Hospital LOS and probability of 30-day
readmission decreased
The average LOS was 4.87 days in the pre-
QI control group, whereas post-QI control
patients experienced an average LOS of just
4.47 days, a reduction of 0.40 days (Table 2).
As expected, the impact of medication pass
ONS on LOS was more apparent among pa-
tients whose diagnoses were typically treated

with nutritional supplementation; the average
LOS in this group fell from 5.74 to 4.97 days—
an improvement of 0.77 days (Table 2).
The probability of readmission to the hospi-
tal within 30 days of discharge was 14.4% for
the pre-QI control group and nonsignificantly
lower at 13.8% in the post-QI group. Exami-
nation of the patients with nutrition-sensitive
diagnoses revealed a more profound improve-
ment in the probability of readmission; prob-
ability of readmission declined from 19.7%
pre-QI to 16.3% post-QI (P < .01). Consis-
tent with our hypothesis, the change in the
nutrition-sensitive group was greater than that
in the control group (P < .05) (Table 2).
HAPUs decreased
Nutrition support is thought to play a role
in preventing the development of hospital-
acquired conditions such as HAPUs. Based on
NDNQI data, there were 40 incident HAPUs
in the last 2 quarters of 2011, compared
with just 20 in the last 2 quarters of 2013,
indicating that our QI was associated with a
50% reduction in incident HAPUs (Table 2).
Cost of hospitalization reduced
Finally, we examined whether nutrition
support affects the patient’s hospital charges.
Patients whose diagnoses are commonly
treated with nutrition support saw a com-
pelling $969 (8.8%) average reduction in
their total hospital bill (P < .01). In con-
trast, patients with diagnoses not commonly
treated with nutrition support experienced a
smaller, nonsignificant, decrease in costs of
$217 (2.1%; Table 2). Such findings are con-
sistent with our hypothesis that the impact
of the QI is expected to be greater among
those with diagnoses that are considered to
be nutrition-sensitive.
DISCUSSION
This nurse-led study examined the impact
of a QI-designed nursing nutrition protocol for
hospitalized patients. According to the proto-
col, (1) nurses screened patients for malnutri-
tion risk at admission, (2) nurses prescribed
ONS for patients at risk, and (3) EMR/MAR
systems were used to support ONS distribu-
tion and audit patient compliance.
We found both expected and unexpected
benefits from the nursing nutrition proto-
col. By adding medication pass ONS to the
EMR/MAR, the nurse could initiate nutritional
intervention in an efficient and timely way.
The system automatically entered a consult to
the dietitian for a comprehensive nutritional
assessment, advice, and care, so patients did
not have to wait for dietitian recommenda-
tions before receiving nutrition support. We
also found that giving ONS with medications,
as opposed to on a meal tray, conveyed to

each patient that ONS was as important as
medication. The net result was that a higher
proportion of hospital patients received ONS;
the rate increased from 6.1% of pre-QI to
8.1% post-QI patients, which suggests that the
revised nutrition practice captured patients
who were overlooked in pre-QI practices.
In terms of timeliness, the interval between
nutritional screening and provision of ONS
decreased from more than 2 days pre-QI to
less than 24 hours post-QI. Malnutrition risk
screening within 24 hours led to prompt iden-
tification of risk, which, in turn, led to prompt
treatment with ONS. Malnutrition risk screen-
ing within 24 hours of admission is required
by The Joint Commission.36
Comparing pre-QI and post-QI outcome
measures demonstrated specific benefits to
timely nutrition care—fewer complications
(such as HAPUs), decreased LOS, and lower
rates of 30-day readmission. In turn, costs
per hospitalization episode were reduced.

Specifically, our already low incidence of
HAPUs was halved, LOS was shortened by
0.77 days in patients with diagnoses that
commonly necessitated ONS use, and rates
of 30-day hospital readmissions were low-
ered by 17% in these patients. Hospitalization
costs were reduced an average of $969 per
nutrition-sensitive patient.
Over the course of the QIP, the team ad-
dressed both perceived and actual barriers.
As an actual barrier, the initiation of the pro-
gram coincided with an upgrade in the EMR
system, resulting in a need to reexamine the
entire process of malnutrition risk screening
and nutrition support. Upgrading the docu-
mentation system meant no changes could be
made to the current documentation informa-
tion. This unanticipated event hindered our
initial plan to add the ONS to the top of the
list of oral supplements for ease of documen-
tation. Nurses had to scroll to the bottom
of a long list of supplements to document
ONS administration, product name, amount,
and time. After a few weeks of observation,
it was clear that the QI team needed to de-
velop a more efficient way to record ONS
prescription, monitor delivery as prescribed,
and audit the process. It was anticipated that
these goals could be met if the EMR was
linked to the MAR; however, the team was
concerned there would be an objection from
pharmacy administration to listing a nurse-
ordered ONS among other medications. The
issue was discussed with representatives from
pharmacy; they understood the problem in
the larger perspective and readily agreed to
include ONS in the MAR. This change was
critical to the success of the program, as it
provided a way to ensure consistent, targeted
distribution of the supplement and allowed a
means to monitor the program.
In summary, our study results underscore
the value of QI as a way to increase atten-
tion to hospital nutrition care, make nutri-
tion practice changes, and test effectiveness
of these changes. We specifically showed how
involvement of nurses in nutrition screen-
ing and ONS prescription could improve nu-
trition care and subsequent outcomes. We
streamlined nutrition practice by using the
EMR/MAR to cue ONS administration at med-
ication pass, and we found that the MAR
was a useful tool to monitor patient com-
pliance with ONS use. With all of these im-
provements and efficiencies, we showed that
timely and appropriate ONS use could yield
better health outcomes with lower costs of
care.
