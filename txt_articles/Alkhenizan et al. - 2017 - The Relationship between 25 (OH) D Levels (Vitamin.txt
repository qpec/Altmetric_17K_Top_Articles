Abstract
Background
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of osteoporosis. Vitamin D defi-
ciency has reached high levels in the Saudi population, but there is conflicting evidence both
in the Saudi population, and worldwide, regarding the existence of a correlation between
these low vitamin D levels and reduced BMD (bone mineral density), or osteoporosis.
Objective
The objective of this study was primarily to determine whether there was a correlation
between vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis in the Saudi population. We aimed to inves-
tigate whether the high levels of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency would translate to
higher prevalence of osteoporosis, and whether there is a correlation between vitamin D lev-
els and bone mineral density.
Materials and methods
This was a community based cross sectional study conducted in the Family Medicine Clinics
at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Electronic
records of 1723 patients were reviewed. Laboratory and radiology results were collected,
including vitamin D levels, calcium levels, and bone mineral density scan results.
Results
Among the whole population, 61.5% had moderate to severe vitamin D deficiency with lev-
els less than 50nmol/L. 9.1% of the population had osteoporosis, and 38.6% had osteope-
nia. Among the whole population, there was no significant correlation between spine or total
femoral BMD and serum 25(OH) D.

 Conclusion
Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the Saudi population. However, no correlation has been
found between vitamin D deficiency and reduced bone mineral density in any age group, in
males or females, Saudis or Non-Saudis, in our population in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Introduction
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone loss, with
reduction in BMD and an increased risk of osteoporosis [1,2]. The general consensus on vita-
min D deficiency suggests that deficiency exists when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are
less than 50nmol/L, with insufficiency in the range from 50nmol/L to 75nmol/L, and suffi-
ciency above 75nmol/L [3].
Vitamin D status is assessed by measurement of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in the blood. Main-
taining recommended levels of vitamin D is essential for bone health. Sources of vitamin D
include adequate exposure to sunlight and sufficient intake of vitamin D from dietary sources.
Supplements should be used if the vitamin D level is insufficient [3].
According to one of the largest and most recent studies on vitamin D status in the popula-
tion, 83.6% of the study population was vitamin D deficient. The Middle East has the highest
rates of vitamin D deficiency worldwide, despite its geography [4]. These studies show the
importance of understanding the effects of vitamin D deficiency on our local population.
Clearly the prevalence of the deficiency is startling in the Saudi Arabian population and this
should lead to an increased prevalence of osteoporosis, then we might expect a significant
increase in fractures and worsening bone health. As such, we conducted this study to investi-
gate whether such a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is correlated with an increased
prevalence of osteoporosis.
In this study we assessed the relationship between vitamin D levels and BMD within the
Saudi population in order to give us a more complete picture of factors affecting bone health
in our locality, and assist us in providing the most suitable care. Three previous studies looked
at the link between vitamin D and BMD in our local population in the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
bia [5,6,7]. However, those previous studies were smaller in size. Our significantly larger sam-
ple size gives us more power to investigate and test any association between BMD and vitamin
D levels. In addition, our study is more community based, as it was carried out at the primary
care level.
There is certainly a need for further, large, well-constructed studies to try to clear up the
controversy surrounding this issue. With this study, we hoped to increase the understanding
of the link between osteoporosis and vitamin D levels in our local population, and take another
step towards a clearer picture of this controversial topic.

 This study was conducted in the Family Medicine Department at King Faisal Specialist
Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The department of Fam-
ily Medicine provides primary care services to a catchment population of 50,000 within the
community. The electronic health records of 1723 patients who had BMD screening and vita-
min D levels documented were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic data and laboratory
results were collected, including 25-Hydroxy vitamin D levels, BMD, albumin, phosphate, and
calcium levels. All the statistical analysis of data was done by using the software package SPSS,
version 20.0 by IBM. Descriptive statistics for the continuous variables are reported as median
and mean, and categorical variables are summarized as frequencies and percentages. Categori-
cal variables are compared by use of the Chi-squared test. The level of statistical significance is
set at p < 0.05. Pearson correlation was used to test the correlation between BMD and 25
(OH) D.
Results
A total number of 1723 patients were enrolled in this study. 84.3% (n = 1452) of the study pop-
ulation were females and 15.7% (n = 271) were males. When we stratify the study population
by nationality, we have 69.2% (n = 1193) Saudi and 30.8% (n = 530) Non-Saudi. Looking at
age groups among the study population, we found 34.4% (n = 593) elderly (60 years and older)
and 65.6% (n = 1130) adult. Among the whole population, 24.8% (n = 427) have severe vitamin
D deficiency with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 25nmol/L, 36.7% (n = 633) have mod-
erate vitamin D deficiency with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 25nmol/L and
50nmol/L, 20.7% (n = 356) have mild vitamin D deficiency with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels between 50nmol/L and 75nmol/L, while only 17% (n = 302) have optimum levels of
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 75nmol/L (Table 1 & S1 Fig). The T-total score showed
that 9.1% (n = 157) of the population had osteoporosis, 38.6% (n = 665) had osteopenia, and
52.3% (n = 901) were normal. Among the whole population, there was no significant correla-
tion between spine or total femoral BMD and serum 25(OH) (Table 2).

 In addition, we stratified the participants into three groups, according to their 25(OH)D
levels, those with levels of 75nmol/l and above, those with levels 50nmol/l and above, and
finally those with levels 25nmol/l and below. We did not find any significant correlation
between spine or total femoral BMD and serum 25(OH)D in any of these groups (S1 Tables).
Furthermore, using the Chi-squared test, we did not find any statistically significant associ-
ation between BMD and vitamin D levels (>75nmol/l vs. <25nmol/l), nor with BMD and vita-
min D levels (>50nmol/l vs. <25nmol/l).
Female subset
1452 females were included in this study. 68.5% (n = 995) of them were Saudis and 31.5%
(n = 457) were Non-Saudis. The T-total score was normal in 55% (n = 798) of the females,
36.4% (n = 529) had osteopenia and 8.6% (n = 125) had osteoporosis (S2 Fig). Using chi-
square test, age and nationality have significant association with T-score with (p<0.0001). The
prevalence of osteoporosis among Saudis was 10.3% (n = 102) and 5.0% (n = 23) among non-
Saudis (p<0.0001). When we compared women by age group, we found that the prevalence of
osteoporosis among elderly females was 18.8% (87 of 464), while only 3.8% (38 of 988) of adult
females had osteoporosis (p<0.0001). Both spine and total femoral BMD failed to show any
significant correlation with serum 25(OH) D in any of the age groups in Saudi or Non-Saudi
females (Table 3). The female subset was also divided into premenopausal (age 21–49), and
postmenopausal (age >50) women. No significant correlation between spine or total femoral

 BMD and serum 25(OH)D was found in either of these groups. Similarly, this subset was
divided into elderly (60 years or above), and non-elderly (<60 years), and again no statistically
significant correlation was found in either group (S1 Tables).
Male subset
We had 271 males included in this study. 73.1% (n = 198) of them were Saudis and 26.9%
(n = 73) were Non-Saudis. The T-total score was normal in 38% (n = 103) of the males,
whereas 50.2% (n = 136) had osteopenia, and 11.8% (n = 32) had osteoporosis (S2 Fig). Using
chi-square test, age has significant association with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Osteoporosis
prevalence was 18.6% (24 of 129) among elderly males, while only 5.6% (8 of 142) of adult
males were diagnosed with osteoporosis, (p<0.0001). We did not find any significant correla-
tion between both spine and total femoral BMD with serum 25(OH) D in any age group, in
Saudi or Non-Saudi males (Table 3).
Discussion
The most pertinent findings of this study are that analysis of the data showed no significant
correlation between vitamin D and Bone Mineral Density in any age groups, in males or
females. These findings are in agreement with one previous Saudi study [7], but not the two
studies by Ardawi et al, which showed significant correlation between vitamin D levels and
BMD [5,6]. The causes of the discrepancies are not clear, but some confounding factors which
may have contributed include the fact that the two studies which found positive correlation
were located on the west coast of Saudi Arabia, in the city of Jeddah, whereas our study was
focused on patients in Riyadh in the central desert region, so there are geographical differences
which contribute to differences in environment, climate and local customs. As an example
Riyadh’s climate is generally hotter in summer, but cooler in winter, while Jeddah is signifi-
cantly more humid. In addition, Jeddah is a coastal town and the diet will reflect that, with
higher consumption of seafood. The other Riyadh study also found no significant correlation
between vitamin D levels and BMD [7]. There are also differences in patient populations, with
the Jeddah studies concentrating on Saudi Arabian nationals only. Our patient population was
drawn from community based family health clinics in Riyadh. These included both Saudi and
Non-Saudi patients. According to the census of Saudi Arabia, 33% of the population is non-
Saudi nationals, which corresponds closely to the non-Saudi population in our study with
30.8% of non-Saudi participants [8]. However, when we split up the patient population into
Saudi and Non-Saudi groups, we still were unable to find any correlation between vitamin D
levels and BMD at any site.
Among the female subset, we found that there was a significant association between T-
score and both age and nationality. Saudi women were more than twice as likely to have osteo-
porosis as non-Saudi women. This could be due to several factors including lifestyle differ-
ences, physical activity levels, direct sunlight exposure, and the fact that Saudi women are
more likely to wear Arab/Muslim style dress with full skin covering. The same nationality dif-
ferences were not found in the male subset, where Saudi men were no more likely to suffer
from osteoporosis than non-Saudi men. Similarly, as expected, elderly females were much
more likely than adult females to have osteoporosis, with the same applying to elderly males
who were also much more likely to have osteoporosis.
Vitamin D has a role to play in the maintenance of good bone health, and this has been well
documented in numerous investigations in a variety of locations, but the presence of a direct
correlation between vitamin D levels (1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D) and bone mineral density is

 still a controversial issue, with some investigators observing a significant correlation, and oth-
ers unable to find any correlation [5,7,9,10,11].
Even when we looked for an association by comparing BMD prevalence in three separate
groups, according to vitamin D levels, (<25nmol/l vs. >25nmol/l vs. >75nmol/l), we were still
unable to find any statistically significant difference in the prevalence of osteoporosis or osteo-
penia in these groups, and no significant correlation between vitamin D and BMD in any of
these groups. So no significant association was found.
Reviewing previous studies on this subject, both Saudi and international, it would appear
that there are a multitude of variables which have an impact on the presence or absence of a
correlation. These include, but are not limited to, age, sex, geographical location, hormonal
status and ethnicity/race. For post-menopausal women, a Japanese study in 2007 failed to find
a significant association between serum 25(OH) D and BMD of the lumber spine, but did find
a positive association between serum 25(OH) D and BMD of the femoral neck [9]. The Saudi
study on postmenopausal women with osteoporosis found a significant positive correlation
between serum 25(OH) D and BMD of the femoral neck in postmenopausal women with oste-
oporosis [5]. When we split our female subset into pre and postmenopausal groups, again we
were unable to find any significant correlation in either group.
Focusing on the male population, a separate Saudi study found a positive correlation
between serum 25 (OH) D and BMD of both the lumbar spine (p<0.023) and femoral neck
(p<0.036) in healthy Saudi Arabian men [6]. Racial variations were highlighted by a diverse
study in 2008 by Hannan et al, focusing on men from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds.
Interestingly, a significant positive correlation between 25 (OH) D levels and BMD was found
in White men only, while it was not significant in Hispanic or Afro-Caribbean men [12].
Conversely, many studies in both genders did not find any significant correlation between
BMD and 25 (OH) D. A recent large Chinese study (2015) with a sample size of over 10000,
did not find a significant correlation between 25 (OH) D and BMD in North-Western China
[10]. The study also showed that poor serum 25 (OH) D concentrations did not increase the
risk of osteoporosis. The same result was found in a study done in Morocco, which showed no
significant correlation between spinal or femoral BMD and 25 (OH) D levels in both genders
[13]. A further study looking into the relationship between BMD and 25-Hydroxyvitamin
D3 in Postmenopausal Iranian Women in 2001, again failed to find a significant correlation
between hip BMD and serum 25-OHD3. However, serum 25-OHD3 was found to have a weak
correlation with lumbar spine BMD [11]. Similarly, a study among healthy Saudi women did
not find any correlation between BMD values and 25 (OH) D levels [7].
Finally, a double blind randomized controlled global trial of postmenopausal women by
Lips et al in 2001, with a large sample size, found that the effect of vitamin D deficiency on
BMD was small and not significant, except for BMD of the trochanter, where a serum vitamin
D level below 25nmol/l was associated with a 4% lower BMD [14].
In conclusion, we were unable to find any significant correlation between BMD and vita-
min D in our patient population. There appear to be many factors that have an impact on
whether correlation exists as discussed. In addition, calcium intake may be a modifying factor
as well as vitamin D supplementation. Clearly with a cross-sectional study like this one, it is
quite difficult to assess the extent of calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation among
our patient population, and therefore its possible effect on the outcome of our study. Another
issue with our cross-sectional study is the fact that in our primary care clinics, the BMD scan
for males would only have been requested on higher risk patients who are more likely to have
osteopenia or osteoporosis, or those who are candidates for screening. As such, the male popu-
lation we captured might not give us a true normal range, and may skew results towards a
higher prevalence of osteoporosis.

 Another confounding factor could be the fact that there may well be other vitamin D deriv-
atives or metabolites, which are biologically active, but not reflected in the vitamin D levels
measured in our laboratories. Analysis of human serum and epidermis has revealed the pres-
ence of 20(OH)D3, 22(OH)D3 and a whole host of other vitamin D derivatives which are likely
to be biologically active [15]. This information might call into question the accuracy of our
current methods used to estimate total active vitamin D levels in the body.
Despite the sundrenched climate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we find that the preva-
lence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is strikingly high. Osteoporosis is an important
public health concern, and the more advanced our understanding of the role of vitamin D in
the disease process, the more effective our strategies will be for the local prevention of this dis-
ease, particularly since vitamin D deficiency is preventable.
