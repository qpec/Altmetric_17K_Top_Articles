Abstract
Importance—Data regarding the contribution of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and anemia to 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are conflicting. These associations have not been prospectively 
evaluated, accounting for repeated, time-varying exposures.
Objective—To determine the relationship between RBC transfusion, severe anemia, and NEC.
Design, Setting, and Participants—In a secondary, prospective, multicenter observational 
cohort study from January 2010 to February 2014, very low-birth-weight (VLBW, ≤1500 g) 
infants, within 5 days of birth, were enrolled at 3 level III neonatal intensive care units in Atlanta, 
Georgia. Two hospitals were academically affiliated and 1 was a community hospital. Infants 
received follow-up until 90 days, hospital discharge, transfer to a non–study-affiliated hospital, or 
death (whichever came first). Multivariable competing-risks Cox regression was used, including 
adjustment for birth weight, center, breastfeeding, illness severity, and duration of initial antibiotic 
treatment, to evaluate the association between RBC transfusion, severe anemia, and NEC.
Exposures—The primary exposure was RBC transfusion. The secondary exposure was severe 
anemia, defined a priori as a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL or less. Both exposures were evaluated as 
time-varying covariates at weekly intervals.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Necrotizing enterocolitis, defined as Bell stage 2 or greater 
by preplanned adjudication. Mortality was evaluated as a competing risk.
Results—Of 600 VLBW infants enrolled, 598 were evaluated. Forty-four (7.4%) infants 
developed NEC. Thirty-two (5.4%) infants died (all cause). Fifty-three percent of infants (319) 
received a total of 1430 RBC transfusion exposures. The unadjusted cumulative incidence of NEC 
at week 8 among RBC transfusion-exposed infants was 9.9% (95% CI, 6.9%-14.2%) vs 4.6% 
(95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) among those who were unexposed. In multivariable analysis, RBC 
transfusion in a given week was not significantly related to the rate of NEC (adjusted cause-
specific hazard ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.17-1.12]; P = .09). Based on evaluation of 4565 longitudinal 
measurements of hemoglobin (median, 7 per infant), the rate of NEC was significantly increased 
among VLBW infants with severe anemia in a given week compared with those who did not have 
severe anemia (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio, 5.99 [95% CI, 2.00-18.0]; P = .001).
Conclusions and Relevance—Among VLBW infants, severe anemia, but not RBC 
transfusion, was associated with an increased risk of NEC. Further studies are needed to evaluate 
whether preventing severe anemia is more important than minimizing RBC transfusion.
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a leading cause of mortality among preterm infants with 
case-fatality rates of 20% to 30%.1-3 The pathogenesis of NEC remains unclear with 
conflicting data regarding the role of 2 risk factors, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and

 anemia, on the development of NEC. A meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies 
demonstrated an association between exposure to RBC transfusion and NEC, with receipt of 
RBC transfusion being associated with an increased risk of NEC (adjusted odds ratio, 2.0 
[95% CI, 1.6-2.5]).4 However, more recent observational studies have found no association 
between RBC transfusion and NEC5,6 or have found RBC transfusion to be protective.7,8 In 
addition, a meta-analysis of randomized trials reported no difference in the incidence of 
NEC between infants receiving conservative vs liberal RBC transfusion approaches (pooled 
odds ratio, 1.67 [95% random-effects CI, 0.82-3.38]).9
Improving understanding of the role of RBC transfusion and anemia in the development of 
NEC is important because more than half of very low-birth-weight (VLBW, ≤1500 g) 
infants receive 1 or more transfusions during hospitalization.10 Some prior studies 
characterizing the associations between transfusion, anemia, and NEC were potentially 
limited by small sample size, case-control design, or lack of evaluation of time-varying 
exposures. As such, researchers have underscored the need for prospective study in which 
each RBC exposure, episode of anemia, and outcome of NEC can be systematically and 
consistently evaluated.4
This prospective study examined whether RBC transfusion and severe anemia were 
associated with the rate of NEC. The primary objective was to test whether NEC was 
increased in VLBW infants receiving RBC transfusion compared with non transfused 
VLBW infants. Further, exposure to severe neonatal anemia was examined as an 
independent risk factor for NEC.
Methods
Setting and Study Population
We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective, multi-center observational birth-cohort 
study investigating the transfusion-transmission of cytomegalovirus in preterm infants (TT-
CMV study). The study design and results of the TT-CMV study have been previously 
published.11,12 Parents or guardians provided written informed consent before enrollment of 
their VLBW infant into the TT-CMV study. All enrolled VLBW infants received follow-up 
from birth to 90 days, hospital discharge, transfer to a non-study–affiliated hospital, or 
death.
All VLBW infants born at 3 level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Atlanta, 
Georgia, were assessed for eligibility. Two NICUs were academically affiliated (Grady 
Memorial Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown) and part of a single regional 
perinatal center. The other NICU was private and not academically affiliated (Northside 
Hospital). No standard transfusion practice guidelines were in place at the 3 institutions, 
allowing for evaluation of varying transfusion practices with differing tolerance of neonatal 
anemia, all within the standards of care. Inclusion criteria were VLBW (≤1500 g) and 
postnatal age of 5 days or less. Exclusion criteria were (1) infant not expected to survive 
beyond 7 days of life based on the assessment by the treating neonatologist; (2) severe 
congenital abnormality; (3) receipt of transfusion before enrollment; or (4) maternal decision

 not to participate. This study was approved by the institutional review board and/or research 
oversight committees at all participating centers.
Definitions
All patient, laboratory, and transfusion variables were collected in standardized case report 
forms using DataFax (Clinical DataFax Systems). The primary outcome was NEC, defined 
as Bell stage 2 or greater according to established criteria.13 The primary outcome was 
ascertained by active surveillance and systematic outcome assessment for all enrolled 
VLBW infants. The Bell staging of all cases of NEC was adjudicated by an independent, 
board-certified neonatologist with extensive expertise in the clinical management of NEC by 
review of clinical notes and abdominal radiographs (actual images and reports by pediatric 
radiologists) to minimize ascertainment bias. This person was not directly involved with the 
study. The primary defined epidemiological exposure was RBC transfusion. All RBC 
transfusion exposures were recorded by research nurses in case report forms. For patients 
who developed NEC, only transfusion exposures that occurred before the onset of clinical 
symptoms consistent with NEC were analyzed. In particular, timing of exposures and 
temporality between exposure and outcome were verified on the day of NEC onset through 
additional review of medical records to ascertain, with as much accuracy as possible, the 
sequence of the onset of clinical symptoms of NEC (eg, emesis, abdominal distention, 
bloody stools) and RBC transfusion.
The prespecified secondary exposure of interest was severe anemia, defined as a hemoglobin 
level of 8 g/dL or less. The cut point of 8 g/dL for severe anemia was determined by taking 
into consideration the lower thresholds of anemia tolerated in 2 randomized clinical trials 
comparing transfusion practices in preterm infants.14,15 We performed additional analysis to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the findings using severity of anemia specified as a continuous, 
instead of categorized, variable. Hemoglobin values, including the date of testing, were 
recorded at 8 scheduled assessments (birth, 3, 7, 14, 21, 40, 60, and 90 days or hospital 
discharge), with assessment windows becoming wider over time.
Baseline and clinical characteristics were reported for both exposure (RBC transfused and 
nontransfused) and outcome (NEC and non-NEC) groups. Baseline illness severity was 
determined using the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP), a validated measure of 
neonatal illness severity.16 Race and ethnicity, which are potential predictors of mortality, 
were determined by maternal report from options defined by federally funded study 
guidelines.
Missing Data
Missing data were minimized through regular quality assurance and quality control reports 
by the TT-CMV data coordinating center to ensure all key variables were collected for 
enrolled participants. If hemoglobin level was not measured in a given week, the prior value 
was carried forward and imputed.17

 Sample Size and Power Calculations
A sample size estimation was performed in August of 2011 based on an interim analysis of 
infants completing the TT-CMV study, which reported 13 (7.5%) of 173 enrolled VLBW 
infants had been diagnosed with NEC. Assuming a NEC incidence of 7%, a final sample 
size of 535 enrolled VLBW infants was calculated to achieve 80% statistical power to detect 
a hazard ratio (HR) for NEC of approximately 2.5 for transfused VLBW infants compared 
with non-transfused VLBW infants (assuming proportional hazards), at a significance level 
of .05. Additional enrollment was continued until funds were exhausted from the TT-CMV 
study to allow retention of power after accounting for adjustment of additional covariates.
Statistical Analysis
The cumulative incidence of NEC and death was estimated using the cumulative incidence 
function for NEC and death.18 CIs were estimated using bootstrapping (1000 bootstrap 
samples), with the infant's mother as the clustering unit to account for multiple births. The 
Gray method (modified log-rank test) was used to compare NEC cumulative incidence 
according to baseline clinical characteristics.19 A competing risk analysis was performed to 
estimate the cause-specific HR and the subdistribution HR (SHR) for NEC and mortality 
using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model implemented with SAS PROC PHreg 
(version 9.4) using robust sandwich variance estimates to account for within-mother 
correlation. Time-dependent effects of RBC transfusion and severe anemia were used to 
investigate the temporal relationships between these covariates and the rate of NEC.
Because of the limited number of infants with NEC diagnosis and concern with model 
overfitting, covariates included in multivariable analyses were limited to main effects for 
baseline measures and time-dependent covariates for longitudinal measures. Tests for 
interactions between baseline covariates were not implemented. Covariate selection was 
driven by available knowledge and biological plausibility of potential confounders, taking 
into consideration the hypothesis of interest (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) and the reliability 
of the covariates as predictors of the outcome evaluated, using 1000 bootstrap samples20 
(eMethods in the Supplement). Models were adjusted for birth weight, center, baseline 
illness severity, and duration of breastfeeding and antibiotic treatment (both evaluated in the 
first 10 days after birth). The addition of gestational age, in addition to birthweight, did not 
improve estimation or change point estimates for the 2 exposures of interest and was not 
included in the final model. Correlation between parameters in the Cox regression model 
was evaluated using the estimated correlation matrix of parameter estimates. The HRs and 
related 95% CIs were calculated for each risk factor in the presence of others in the final 
model.
Additional analyses evaluated the sensitivity of estimates of association in the primary 
model (model 1), with evaluation of possible model overfitting by specifying a parsimonious 
model limited to 4 covariates (model 2), additionally controlling for severity of early 
respiratory illness (model 3), and controlling for confounding by indication for RBC 
transfusion through the use of propensity scoring with covariate adjustment using the 
propensity score (model 4), and by inverse probability of treatment weighting (model 5; 
eMethods in the Supplement). The 8 independent variables for the propensity score model

 included the following baseline covariates potentially associated with RBC transfusion 
exposure, study outcomes, or both21: mechanical ventilation on the day of birth, receipt of 1 
or more doses of antenatal steroids, birth weight, gestational age, SNAP, Apgar score at 5 
minutes, hemoglobin value at birth, and clinical center. Standardized differences were used 
to assess the balance of baseline confounders between RBC transfusion exposed and 
unexposed patients after propensity scoring (eMethods in the Supplement). Additional 
analyses, limited only to patients exposed to RBC transfusion, were performed to evaluate 
the relationship between NEC and 2 specific donor RBC characteristics: storage age of 
transfused RBCs and the duration of RBC storage after γ-irradiation. Statistical significance 
was defined as a 2-sided P value of less than .05.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
From January 2010 to February 2014, a total of 1652 infants were screened, of whom 600 
VLBW infants met study criteria and were enrolled (Figure 1). Ninety-nine percent 
(598/600) of enrolled infants were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) gestational 
age of the cohort was 27.9 (3.3) weeks and birthweight was 1015 g (273 g) (Table 1). 
Among the full cohort of 598 infants, 296 (49.5%) were female, 346 (57.9%) were black, 
138 (23.1%) were small for gestational age, and 520 (87.0%) received at least some breast 
milk during the study. When comparing baseline characteristics by exposure to RBC 
transfusion, infants who received at least 1 RBC transfusion had a lower birthweight (864 g 
vs 1189 g) and gestational age (26.4 vs 29.5 weeks) compared with non–RBC-transfused 
infants (eTable 1 in the Supplement). In addition, infants who received RBC transfusions 
had a higher SNAP on the day of birth (12.4 vs 8.1) and more commonly received 
mechanical ventilation in the first week of life (72.1% vs 26.5%, eTable 2 in the 
Supplement) compared with those who did not receive RBC transfusions.
Description of Exposures and Outcomes
A total of 48 infants developed NEC and 44 infants were diagnosed with a Bell stage of 2 or 
greater after adjudication (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The overall cumulative incidence of 
NEC at 8 weeks was 7.7% (95% CI, 5.7%-10.3%), and the cumulative incidence of 
mortality was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-5.0%) (Figure 2, eTable 4 in the Supplement). A total of 
1430 RBC transfusions and 4565 hemoglobin measurements were recorded over the 12-
week study period. Fifty-three percent (319/598) of infants received 1 or more RBC 
transfusions. Seventy-five percent (33/44) of infants with NEC received an RBC transfusion 
before diagnosis and 15.9% (7/44) received an RBC transfusion within 48 hours of 
diagnosis (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The overall RBC transfusion rate was 1.20 (95% 
CI, 1.14-1.27) per 30 infant-days, although this varied by center (eTable 5 in the 
Supplement). Eighteen percent (109/598) of infants ever had severe anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 8 
g/dL).
Risk Factors for NEC and Mortality
In a bivariable analysis, factors associated with both NEC and mortality included gestational 
age, birth weight, presence of severe anemia in a given week, and the number of days of

 antibiotic treatment in the first 10 days of life (Table 2). The unadjusted cumulative 
incidence of NEC at week 8 in RBC-exposed infants was 9.9% (95% CI, 6.9%-14.2%) vs 
4.6% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.0%) among infants who were not exposed to RBC transfusions. The 
rate of NEC was increased in VLBW infants who received RBC transfusions compared with 
infants who did not (cause-specific HR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.18-4.60]; P = .01). In addition, 
increases in the SNAP on the day of birth were associated with an increased risk of 
mortality, while more days of breastfeeding in the first 10 postnatal days were associated 
with decreased mortality.
In multivariable analysis, including adjustment for birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, 
illness severity, severity of anemia, duration of antibiotic treatment, and center, any RBC 
transfusion in a given week was not independently associated with an increased rate of NEC 
(cause-specific HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.17-1.12]; P = .09) or mortality (cause-specific HR, 1.36 
[95% CI, 0.27-6.82]; P = .71). In a given week, VLBW infants with severe anemia had a 
higher estimated rate of NEC compared with VLBW infants without severe anemia 
(adjusted cause-specific HR, 5.99 [95% CI, 2.00-18.0]; P = .001). Similar results were found 
when controlling for the severity of early respiratory illness (model 3) and the propensity for 
RBC transfusion (models 4 and 5; Table 3). Severe anemia and birth weight were 
independent reliable predictors of NEC because they appeared as significant risk factors in 
more than 50% of 1000 bootstrap models.20 Given the presence of some correlation between 
RBC transfusion and severe anemia (coefficient of −0.43), we analyzed reduced 
multivariable models without 1 of the 2 correlated exposures and found similar HR 
estimates for both RBC transfusion and severe anemia as models with both variables 
included (eTable 6 in the Supplement). However, the reduced model provided better 
precision as indicated by the reduced width of the 95% CI.
To estimate the hazard of NEC among a more homogenous population of infants, an 
analysis limited to a subset of VLBW infants who received at least 1 RBC transfusion (n = 
319) was performed. In this analysis, 2 donor RBC storage characteristics were also 
evaluated. Overall, median storage age of transfused RBCs was 9 days (interquartile range, 
7-13 days) and median duration of storage after gamma irradiation was 1 day (interquartile 
range, 0-5 days). No association was detected between NEC and the maximum storage age 
of RBCs transfused in a given week nor the maximum duration of storage after γ-irradiation 
(eTable 7 in the Supplement). In multivariable analysis, RBC transfusion was not associated 
with the rate of NEC, but severe anemia remained an independent risk factor for NEC 
(eTable 8 in the Supplement).
The sensitivity of the use of a hemoglobin cut point of 8 g/dL to categorize severe anemia 
was assessed by specifying the degree of anemia as a continuous variable (lowest nadir of 
hemoglobin). For each 1-g/dL decrease in nadir hemoglobin in any given week, the HR for 
NEC increased by 65% (cause-specific HR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.23-2.12]; P < .001) with 
reliability of 92% (eTable 9 in the Supplement). Longitudinal modeling of hemoglobin 
values, adjusted for birth weight, demonstrated that hemoglobin levels among infants who 
developed NEC and those in non-NEC infants who received at least 1 RBC transfusion 
declined similarly during 90 days of follow-up (test for interaction between time on study 
and group, P = .25). No difference was detected in baseline mean hemoglobin level (mean

 difference at birth, 0.52 g/dL [95% CI, −0.02 to 1.05]; P = .06) or lower mean hemoglobin 
by 49 to 90 days of age between NEC and non–NEC-transfused infants (mean difference, 
−1.50 g/dL [95% CI, −3.05 to 0.04]; P = .06) (eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this secondary, prospective, multicenter study, RBC transfusion was not an independent 
risk factor for NEC. These findings are in contrast to the published systematic review and 
meta-analysis of 12 retrospective studies that demonstrated an association between RBC 
transfusion and NEC4 but a reconsistent with those of Sharma et al,6 which indicated that 
RBC transfusion was not associated with the cumulative incidence of NEC. By evaluating 
each RBC transfusion exposure during hospitalization using time-varying covariates, the 
results of this study may be less subject to the biases of prior studies in which each infant 
was categorized as exposed or unexposed to any RBC transfusion or in which temporality 
between exposure and outcome was not evaluated. The prospective design helped ensure the 
accuracy and completeness of the longitudinal data.
In addition, the results suggest that severe anemia may be an important potential risk factor 
for NEC. Similarly, Singh et al23 demonstrated that each percentage-point decrease in the 
lowest measured hematocrit level was associated with an increased risk of NEC in VLBW 
infants (odds ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.18]). DeRienzo et al24 found the severity of 
pretransfusion anemia to be associated with NEC and suggested a possible interaction 
between transfusion and anemia on the outcome of NEC. The results of this study raise 
potential concern for the safety of conservative transfusion practices with transfusion 
thresholds that tolerate severe anemia, particularly since transfusion practices based on 
hemoglobin thresholds may not adequately factor in an individual patient's clinical status 
and illness severity.25 Taken in the context of recent observational studies identifying 
associations between anemia and NEC,23,24 our findings indicate that anemia, rather than 
RBC transfusion, may be a key risk factor for NEC.
Ascertaining temporality between exposure and outcome was important in determining the 
relationship between RBC transfusion and NEC because many infants received RBC 
transfusion on the day of diagnosis of NEC but after onset of clinical symptoms. It is 
possible that prior studies identifying an association between RBC transfusion and NEC 
may have been subjected to the effects of reverse causation, whereby clinical instability 
from evolving NEC leads a clinician to administer a RBC transfusion before the formal 
diagnosis of NEC is established.
An association between breastfeeding in the first 10 days after birth and a higher risk of 
NEC was found, which is in contrast to the published literature.26 The lack of a protective 
effect of breastmilk in this study may be due to the high incidence of breastfeeding (ie, small 
number of unexposed), the assessment limited to the first 10 days of age, or the favorable 
association of breastfeeding on a lower risk of the competing outcome of death.
The strengths of the study include the prospective and systematic collection of data. 
Evaluation of time-varying exposures allowed use of data from each of the numerous

 episodes of RBC transfusion and severe anemia that a VLBW infant may experience during 
hospitalization. Further, each transfusion exposure was systematically evaluated, donor RBC 
characteristics were identified, and the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome 
was determined. Only definite NEC cases (Bell stages 2-3) were included, determined by 
active surveillance by research nurses with adjudication of staging by a neonatologist not 
directly involved with the study to minimize ascertainment bias. Detection bias of NEC was 
minimized by implementing follow-up of all enrolled infants for the primary outcome. 
Attrition of infants from the study was minimal.
The study has several limitations. The observational design prohibits the establishment of 
causality between exposures to both RBC transfusion and anemia and the outcome of NEC. 
Reverse causation is possible for cases in which sub-clinical NEC may lead to severe 
anemia before clinical signs of NEC are obvious. However, no infants with severe anemia 
included in the analysis were diagnosed with bloody stool at the time of laboratory 
assessment of anemia, making this source of acute anemia in infants with NEC less likely. In 
addition, all potential confounders could not be accounted for, and residual confounding of 
the risk estimates by unmeasured variables is possible. The external validity of the study 
may be limited to centers with differing transfusion practices, including those that 
commonly use erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.
Because severe anemia, but not RBC transfusion, was a risk factor for NEC in this study, 
preventing severe anemia may be more clinically important than minimizing RBC 
transfusion exposure as a strategy to decrease the risk of NEC. However, the effect of such a 
strategy on other important neonatal outcomes is unclear, and further study is needed. 
Ongoing clinical trials comparing liberal vs conservative transfusion practices may provide 
additional experimental data regarding the risks of both severe anemia and RBC transfusion 
to NEC.
Conclusions
Among VLBW infants, severe anemia but not RBC transfusion was associated with an 
increased risk of NEC. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether preventing severe 
anemia is more important than minimizing RBC transfusion.

 Figure 1. Flow of Participation for Very Low-Birth-Weight Infants With and Without 
Necrotizing Enterocolitis
Of the 598 participants included in the analysis, 532 received follow-up until the end of the 
study (90 days or until hospital discharge) and 63 until the outcome event was reached (44 
infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and 19 deaths among infants without necrotizing 
enterocolitis). Three (0.5%) participants were transferred to a non-study–affiliated hospital 
(1 after 45, 1 after 52, and 1 after 75 days in the study). The weight inclusion criterion 
threshold was changed from 1250 g to 1500 g in November 2010 to increase enrollment.

cThe 5-minute Apgar score was unavailable for 2 infants born outside the study hospital.
dTime-dependent covariate defined as a dichotomous variable that can change, at most, once from unexposed to exposed over 12 weeks of follow-
up (ie, once exposed, always exposed).
eTime-dependent covariate. Values for some infants may change from a given week to the subsequent week (eg, not severely anemic to severely 
anemic). For cumulative number of transfusions, the total number in a given week plus the number of prior transfusions was used. For nadir 
hemoglobin level, the lowest measure in a given week was used. If no hemoglobin measurement was obtained, the previous week's hemoglobin 
value was used (last observation carried forward).
fAll observed deaths occurred in the transfusion group; therefore, hazard could not be estimated.
