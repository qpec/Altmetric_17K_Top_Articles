Abstract
Importance—Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) use is increasing among women 
with unilateral breast cancer, but little is known about treatment decision making or physician 
interactions in diverse patient populations.
Objective—To evaluate patient motivations, knowledge, and decisions, as well as the impact of 
surgeon recommendations, in a large, diverse sample of patients who underwent recent treatment 
for breast cancer.
Design/Setting/Participants—A survey was sent to 3631 women with newly diagnosed, 
unilateral stage 0, I, or II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014. Women were 
identified through the population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registries of 
Los Angeles County and Georgia. Data on surgical decisions, motivations for those decisions, and 
knowledge were included in the analysis. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression of the data 
were conducted to identify factors associated with (1) CPM vs all other treatments combined, 2) 
CPM vs unilateral mastectomy (UM), and (3) CPM vs breast-conserving surgery (BCS). 
Associations between CPM receipt and surgeon recommendations were also evaluated. All

 statistical models and summary estimates were weighted to be representative of the target 
population.
Main Outcome and Measures—Receipt of CPM was the primary dependent variable for 
analysis and was measured by a woman’s self-report of her treatment.
Results—Of the 3631 women selected to receive the survey, 2578 (71.0%) responded and 2402 
of these respondents who did not have bilateral disease and for whom surgery type was known 
constituted the final analytic sample. The mean (SD) age was 61.8 (12) years at the time of the 
survey. Overall, 1301 (43.9%) patients considered CPM (601[24.8%] considered it very strongly 
or strongly; only 395 (38.1%) of them knew that CPM does not improve survival for all women 
with breast cancer. Ultimately, 1466 women (61.6%) received BCS, 508 (21.2%) underwent UM, 
and 428 (17.3%) received CPM. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with CPM included 
younger age (per 5-year increase: odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65–0.77), white race (black vs 
white: OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34–0.74), higher educational level (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.20–2.40), 
family history (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.22–2.17), and private insurance (Medicaid vs private 
insurance: OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28–0.79). Among 1569 patients (65.5%) without high genetic risk 
or an identified mutation, 598 (39.3%) reported a surgeon recommendation against CPM, of whom 
only 12 (1.9%) underwent CPM, but among the 746 (46.8%) of these women who received no 
recommendation for or against CPM from a surgeon, 148 (19.0%) underwent CPM.
Conclusions and Relevance—Many patients consider CPM, but knowledge about the 
procedure is low and discussions with surgeons appear to be incomplete. Contralateral 
prophylactic mastectomy use is substantial among patients without clinical indications but is low 
when patients report that their surgeon recommended against it. More effective physician-patient 
communication about CPM is needed to reduce potential overtreatment.
INTRODUCTION
Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) is a controversial procedure for patients 
diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer because no compelling evidence suggests a survival 
advantage1,2 and the risk of contralateral breast cancer development is low for most 
patients.1 Yet celebrity exposure and publicity have recently drawn attention to this approach 
for the management of early-stage unilateral breast cancer.3 Rates of this aggressive, costly, 
morbid, and burdensome procedure are increasing over time both at centers of excellence 
and in the broader community,2,4–9 even among patients without high genetic risk of a 
second primary breast cancer who would otherwise be candidates for breast-conserving 
therapy.
Few studies have evaluated patients’ decision-making experiences to illuminate why CPM 
rates have markedly increased; most studies have been limited in generalizability because 
they considered patients treated at a single institution or those of young age.10–14 Such 
studies have identified worrisome knowledge deficits among patients who chose CPM and 
noted that decisions for CPM appear to be patient-driven rather than shared or physician-
driven.12,15,16 A prior study from our group described the surgical decision-making 
experiences of a population-based sample whose breast cancer was diagnosed around 2006 
in an era when over two-thirds of patients received breast-conserving therapy and fewer than

 10% received CPM.17 That study found that CPM receipt was significantly associated with 
genetic testing, strong family cancer history, receipt of magnetic resonance imaging, higher 
education, and greater worry about cancer recurrence. However, less is known about the 
knowledge regarding, motivations for, and recommendations perceived about CPM by 
diverse women treated more recently in the United States. Given that multiple studies have 
documented strong racial/ethnic and age-related differences in receipt of CPM,18 
investigation of these questions in a large, diverse sample is particularly important to inform 
the design of targeted interventions that aim to reduce the use of aggressive treatments in 
patients with a favorable prognosis. Moreover, little is known about patient-physician 
communication in this context, including the prevalence of physician recommendations 
against CPM or their influence. Evaluating the impact of surgeon recommendations is 
particularly important given that prominent professional societies have long advocated for 
detailed discussions between surgeons and patients in this setting because of concerns that 
patients may overestimate risk. However, to our knowledge, the extent to which surgeon 
communication influences patients has not yet been evaluated in population-based 
samples.19
Therefore, we conducted a large-scale survey of patients with a diagnosis of early-stage 
breast cancer and identified through 2 population-based Surveillance Epidemiology and End 
Results (SEER) registries. We specifically sought to describe consideration and receipt of 
CPM, accuracy of knowledge, motivations, and correlates of CPM receipt, with particular 
attention to the impact of surgeon recommendations in this setting.
METHODS
Sample
Between July 2013 and September 2014, we selected 3,880 women aged 20 to 79 who 
received a diagnosis of and were surgically treated for in situ or early-stage invasive breast 
cancer and were reported to the SEER registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County. 
African Americans, Asians and Latinas were oversampled in Los Angeles. As detailed in the 
eFigure in the Supplement, 249 women were subsequently found to be ineligible. Of the 
3,631 eligible women, 2,578 (71%) completed a survey. The 2,402 of these respondents who 
did not have bilateral disease and for whom surgery type was known constituted the final 
analytic sample. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional 
Review Board and received a waiver of documentation of informed consent. Financial 
compensation was provided to the patients.
Questionnaire design and content
Questionnaire content was developed based on a conceptual framework, research questions, 
and hypotheses. We selected established measures and developed new measures drawing 
from the literature and prior research from our group.17 We used standard techniques to 
assess content validity, including systematic review by design experts, cognitive pretesting 
with patients, and pilot studies in selected clinic populations.

 Data Collection
Eligible patients were identified via initial surgical pathology reports from a list of definitive 
surgical procedures. The median (SD) time from diagnosis to survey completion was 6.4 
(3.0) months. To encourage response, we provided a $20 cash incentive and used a modified 
Dillman method,20 including reminders to non-respondents. All materials were printed in 
English. We also included Spanish-translated materials for all women with surnames 
suggesting Latina ethnicity.21 Survey responses were merged with clinical data from the 
SEER registries.
Measures
CPM Consideration and Receipt—Receipt of CPM was our primary dependent 
variable for analysis and was measured by self-report. Specifically, patients reported the 
ultimate type of surgery they had received (lumpectomy, unilateral mastectomy [UM], or 
bilateral mastectomy with CPM). Consideration of CPM at the time of definitive surgical 
decision-making was measured through the patient survey using a 5-point response scale 
(very strongly, strongly, moderately, weakly, not at all).
Knowledge and Motivations—Patient knowledge was measured by inquiring (with 
response options of yes/no/don’t know) about whether removing the unaffected breast 
improves survival for all women with breast cancer and whether doing so reduces the risk of 
“the breast cancer coming back.”
Women who received CPM were asked to describe the level of importance of the following 
factors on their decision to choose CPM: their age, having a positive BRCA 1 or 2 genetic 
testing result, having a family history of breast cancer, wanting reconstruction to best match 
her breast, wanting reconstruction to change breast size, and peace of mind. Response 
options were “not at all,” “a little,” “somewhat,” “quite,” and “very.”
Surgeon recommendations—Surgeon recommendations were assessed with an item 
that asked patients how strongly the surgeons who the patient consulted recommended 
having a “mastectomy on both breasts.” Responses were grouped as having received a 
recommendation against CPM (either strong or weak), having received no recommendation 
for or against CPM, or having received a recommendation for CPM (either strong or weak).
Covariates—SEER registries provided cancer stage at diagnosis (0, I, or II); patients with 
stage III and IV disease were not sampled since the present analysis was part of a larger 
study on treatment experiences of patients with breast cancer with a favorable prognosis. 
Patients provided age at the time of the survey, information regarding race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, Latina), education (some high 
school, completed high school, attended or completed college), insurance coverage 
(Medicaid, Medicare, private/other insurance, not insured), income (grouped for analysis as 
<40,000, 40,000–89,999, ≥90,000), marital status (not married vs married or partnered), 
family history of breast cancer (grouped as present in ≥ first-degree relative vs no history), 
breast size (smaller [A, B, or C cup size] vs larger [D or larger]), and magnetic resonance 
imaging receipt (yes or no).

 We divided patients into 2 groups, based on genetic risk of developing a contralateral 
primary breast cancer. We deliberately created a conservative measure of “average risk” by 
excluding from that group not only those who reported having been diagnosed with a 
deleterious mutation on germline genetic testing but also all those patients who would be 
considered at high risk for a mutation based on criteria derived from guidelines of the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network.22 Specifically, we considered patients to be at 
high risk for a genetic mutation if they had one or more of the following factors: age at 
breast cancer diagnosis 45 years or younger; triple-negative breast cancer with age at 
diagnosis younger than 60 years; any relative with: ovarian cancer, sarcoma, or male breast 
cancer; 2 or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer; for patients diagnosed at age ≤50, 
≥1 first-degree relative with breast cancer; Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry; or family history of a 
deleterious genetic mutation (BRCA1, BRCA2, or another mutation associated with high 
breast cancer risk, e.g., TP53). SEER registries provided the information on expression of 
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and ERBB2 (formerly HER2) for this definition; 
patients self-reported the other information. Multiple variable analyses also controlled for 
geographic site (Georgia versus Los Angeles County).
Weights
Survey design and non-response weights were created to compensate for the differential 
probability of selecting patients by race/ethnicity, cancer stage, and SEER site and to adjust 
for survey non-response. The weights were normalized to equal to the observed sample size. 
All statistical models presented are weighted so that statistical inference is representative of 
our target population. All percentages reported herein are weighted, unless otherwise noted.
Statistical Methods
Weighted binomial logistic regression models and multinomial logistic regression models 
were constructed to compare surgical outcomes. Receipt of CPM was the primary outcome. 
Models included all of the theoretically prespecified covariates described above. To correct 
for the potential for bias due to item nonresponse when using complete-cases methods, 
values for missing items were imputed using sequential multiple imputations (SMI).23,24 
Model results were compared between sequential multiple imputation analyses and 
complete-case analyses of the observed data for any meaningful differences. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% CIs are reported; P ≤.05 was considered the level of significance; P values 
were 2-sided. Analysis was performed using Stata, release 14 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
Table 1 reports the characteristics of the analytic sample by surgery received. Mean (SD) age 
was 61.8 (12) years. Overall, 428 (24.9%) patients had stage 0 disease (ductal carcinoma in 
situ), 1258 (46.9%) stage I disease, and 611 (24.7%) stage II disease. A total of 1292 
(57.1%) women were white; 430 (18.0%) were black, 413 (13.7%) Latina, and 205 (8.6%) 
Asian. A total of 1260 (53.5%) had private insurance, but 682 (28.6%) had Medicare and 
328 (12.8%) had Medicaid. The sample included a wide range of family income, and 1501 
women (62.8%) were married. A total of 555 women (23.8%) reported having a first-degree 
family member with breast cancer. Preoperative MRI was performed in 1412 women

 (59.0%), and 1569 (65.5%) had neither a known deleterious mutation nor a high risk for a 
genetic mutation. Overall, 1466 (61.6%) received BCS, 508 (21.2%) underwent UM, and 
428 (17.3%) bilateral mastectomy with CPM.
Figure 1 depicts the strength of consideration of CPM in this sample, among those with 
known deleterious mutations or high genetic risk, as well as the strength of consideration 
among all others, whom we consider to be at average risk of contralateral primary cancer 
development. Overall, 1056 patients (43.9%) considered CPM and 601 (24.8%) considered 
it strongly or very strongly. Consideration of CPM was more common among the higher risk 
patients (351 [52.0%]), but was also reported by 650 (40.9%) of those at average risk for a 
second primary breast cancer (P<0.001). Of the average-risk patients, 253 (15.7%) 
considered CPM very strongly, 82 (5.2%) strongly, 153 (9.7%) moderately, and 162 (10.4%) 
weakly.
Among patients who considered CPM, 395 (38.1%) knew that it does not improve survival 
for all women with breast cancer (23.8% believed it did and 38.1% did not know); 462 
(43.5%) knew that removing the breast without cancer does not prevent cancer from 
recurring for all women with breast cancer (17.0% thought it did, and 39.5% did not know). 
Among women who actually received CPM, 158 (37.3%) believed it improves survival for 
all women with breast cancer.
Overall, 180 (26.4%) of 676 higher risk patients and 236 of 1569 individuals (14.2%) at 
average risk received CPM. As shown in Figure 2, almost all (96.3%) of patients endorsed 
peace of mind as very or quite important in motivating them to receive CPM. Substantial 
minorities cited their age, family history, or a desire to have reconstruction for symmetry as 
motivating factors; smaller minorities cited their BRCA mutation status or a desire to change 
the size of their breasts.
Table 2 presents a simple logistic regression model evaluating factors associated with receipt 
of CPM in comparison with all other treatments, as well as a multinomial logistic regression 
model that allows more nuanced comparison of CPM with UM, CPM with BCS, and UM 
with BCS. Because the models were generally consistent, we summarize here the results of 
the simpler model. Older patients were significantly less likely to have CPM (per 5-year 
increase, OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65–0.77; P < .001). Black patients were significantly less 
likely to have CPM than white patients (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34–0.74; P < .001). Patients 
who had attended at least some college were more likely to receive CPM (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 
1.20–2.40; P = .003) compared with less educated patients. Patients with Medicaid vs private 
insurance were significantly less likely to receive CPM (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28–0.79; P = .
005). Patients reporting at least 1 first-degree relative with breast cancer were significantly 
more likely to receive CPM (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.22–2.17; P < .001). Patients with larger 
breast size were significantly more likely to receive CPM (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01–1.71; P 
= .046). Having controlled for age and family history, we found that patients known to be 
deleterious mutation carriers or at high risk of genetic mutations were only marginally more 
likely to receive CPM, and this finding did not achieve statistical significance (OR, 1.33; 
95% CI, 0.99–1.79; P = .056). Finally, patients in Los Angeles County were significantly 
less likely to receive CPM (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32–0.64; P < .001) than patients in Georgia.

 Figure 3 depicts the distribution of patient-reported surgeon recommendations regarding 
CPM by treatment receipt. Overall, 859 (37.0%) patients reported that their surgeons 
recommended against CPM, of whom 19 (2.1%) received it; 1131 (46.3%) reported 
receiving no surgeon recommendation regarding CPM, of whom 240 (20.9%) received it; 
and 282 (11.1%) reported a surgeon recommendation for CPM, of whom 162 (58.9%) 
received it. Among the subset of patients without high genetic risk or a known deleterious 
mutation, 598 (39.3%) reported a surgeon recommendation against CPM, of whom only 12 
(1.9%) received it, but among the 746 of these patients (46.8%) who received no 
recommendation for CPM, 148 (19.0%) received it.
DISCUSSION
In this large survey of a recent sample of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer 
identified through population-based registries, nearly half of all patients considered CPM 
and 1 in 5 received it. Even among patients without known deleterious genetic mutations or 
elevated risk of a genetic mutation, 40.9% considered CPM and 14.2% received it. This 
strong patient interest in CPM and the substantial use of this aggressive surgical procedure 
by patients who are unlikely to develop a second breast cancer is sobering. Patient 
knowledge about CPM was low, even among those who considered or received it. Surgeon 
recommendations were strongly associated with treatment receipt, with only 1.9% of 
average-risk patients who perceived a surgeon recommendation against CPM receiving it, 
but 19.0% of those who reported receiving no surgeon recommendation doing so.
The rates of consideration and receipt of CPM are substantially higher in the current study 
than they were in a study conducted in the same geographic regions from 2005–2007. Our 
observation of higher rates of CPM consideration and receipt is concerning because second 
primary breast cancer rates in patients without elevated genetic risk have plummeted: this 
trend has been attributed to increasingly effective systemic therapy that not only reduces 
recurrence but also the development of subsequent new primaries.25,26 Breast conservation 
now results in very low in-breast event rates, especially among patients with hormonally-
sensitive disease,27 but it is unclear whether patients accurately understand their risks in this 
context. Smaller studies of selected patients have suggested that knowledge deficits 
exist.12,15 Our findings in this large, diverse sample confirm that many patients 
misunderstand crucial information for surgical decision making.
Some patients may pursue CPM for cosmetic symmetry or other reasons. However, it is not 
clear that average-risk patients who choose CPM truly understand that it will not improve 
survival or alter recurrence risk. Far higher proportions of patients choosing this procedure 
prioritize “peace of mind” than other potential reasons for its use, suggesting that they do 
believe—whether rationally or emotionally—that there is a meaningful impact of more 
aggressive surgery on the ultimate risk of recurrence or survival. Physicians must recognize 
that peace of mind motivates many patients who choose CPM, suggesting that it may be 
particularly important to explain to patients considering CPM how other therapeutic 
interventions, such as endocrine therapy in appropriate patients (which may be less easy to 
understand than a simple surgical intervention, or may not be discussed until after surgical

 decisions are complete), can offer meaningful benefits and increase the peace of mind that 
these patients ultimately seek, without the risks of more aggressive surgery.
Our observations that CPM receipt continues to be more common among advantaged groups 
(those who are white, have higher educational levels, and have private rather than Medicaid 
insurance) are consistent with other studies to date.8,9,17,28 Prior research from our group 
and others has suggested that when patients participate more in their breast cancer surgical 
decisions, they more often receive aggressive treatment.16,29 Ironically, a physician’s desire 
to support patient autonomy may result in excessive surgery if patients are misinformed, as 
our results suggest is common. Shared decision making requires that physicians participate 
actively in ensuring that patients’ knowledge is accurate. Otherwise, deference to the 
patient’s wishes constitutes an abdication of a hallowed professional obligation.
Our results are particularly noteworthy because, to our knowledge, they are the first 
population-based data that suggest a strong influence of surgeons on CPM receipt: 
approximately one-third of patients at average risk of contralateral primary cancers reported 
that their surgeons recommended against CPM, and of these, very few received it. Yet many 
patients reported that they perceived no recommendation from their surgeons, and these 
women were much more likely to receive CPM. The results of this study are observational 
and measured through patient self-report; thus, it is possible that some patients were so 
clearly committed to CPM that physicians feared to alienate them by offering alternatives, or 
that they did not recall a surgeon’s recommendation against CPM. Nonetheless, it is 
compelling that so few patients who perceived a surgeon’s active recommendation against 
CPM received it. This finding suggests that physicians can influence patients against a 
surgical option that may be more extensive than is clinically indicated. In the context of 
studies suggesting that surgeon involvement in decision making is associated with less 
aggressive treatment,13,29,30 along with studies reporting surgeons’ knowledge deficits about 
CPM and contralateral breast cancer risk,31 our findings suggest that surgeons’ knowledge 
and communication practices are targets for quality improvement interventions.
Strengths and Limitations
Aspects of the study merit comment. Strengths include the large, diverse, recent population-
based sample of women with newly diagnosed, early-stage breast cancer. We incorporated 
highly valid measures of treatment, an extensive array of patient attributes, and granular 
measures of patient experiences. Limitations of the study include potential biases due to 
survey nonresponse. However, our response rate was high, and we used weighting to ensure 
that our findings are representative of the targeted population, along with multiple 
imputation to minimize the impact of missing data due to item nonresponse. Measurement 
errors may exist in self-reported data; however, we conducted extensive pre-testing and 
relied on validated measures wherever possible.32 Patients’ recall of communication 
experiences may not be perfectly accurate, but their perceptions provide a critically 
important perspective. Finally, our results may not be generalizable to other geographic 
areas. We found substantial differences in rates of CPM in Los Angeles County vs. Georgia, 
but we investigated interaction effects and found that the correlates of use, knowledge, and 
impact of surgeon recommendation appeared generally consistent across the 2 sites. The

 mechanisms underlying the observed site differences may be particularly illuminating; 
therefore, further research is warranted to investigate the extent to which these differences 
are explained by differences in the treating surgeons’ practice settings, attitudes, and 
resources.
CONCLUSIONS
Rates of CPM are substantial even in a diverse, population-based sample, and patient 
knowledge in this context is poor. When they do not perceive a surgeon’s recommendation 
against it, even patients without high genetic risk for a second primary breast cancer choose 
CPM at an alarmingly high rate (nearly 1 in 5). However, CPM rates are very low among 
patients who report a surgeon’s recommendation against it. Our findings should motivate 
surgeons to broach these difficult conversations with their patients, to make their 
recommendations clear, and to promote patients’ peace of mind by emphasizing how other 
treatments complement surgery to reduce the risk of both tumor recurrence and subsequent 
cancer development. These findings should also motivate efforts to inform and support 
surgeons in this challenging communication context, understand surgeons’ perspectives 
more fully, and design physician-facing interventions to reduce excessive treatment.

 Figure 1. Strength of consideration of CPM by risk for contralateral primary cancer
This figure depicts the proportion of patients sampled who reported consideration of CPM, 
along with the strength of that consideration, by risk groups defined using age, family 
history, and biologic subtype, derived from the contemporaneous NCCN guidelines for 
assessment of genetic risk.

 Figure 2. Motivations for CPM receipt
The 428 women in our sample who chose CPM were asked the importance of various factors 
in their decision to have the procedure. This figure depicts the distribution of their responses 
for wanting reconstruction to change the size of the breasts, having a positive BRCA 1 or 2 
test result, having a family history of breast cancer, wanting reconstruction to best match the 
breasts, age, and wanting peace of mind.
