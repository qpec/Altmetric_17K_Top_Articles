Over 80% of African-American (AA) women are overweight or obese. A large racial
disparity between AA and European-Americans (EA) in obesity rates exists among
women, but curiously not among men. Although socio-economic and/or cultural
factors may partly account for this race-by-sex interaction, the potential involvement
of genetic factors has not yet been investigated. Among 2814 self-identified AA in
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, we estimated each individual’s degree
of West-African genetic ancestry using 3437 ancestry informative markers. We then
tested whether sex modifies the association between West-African genetic ancestry
and body mass index (BMI), waist-circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR),
adjusting for income and education levels, and examined associations of ancestry
with the phenotypes separately in males and females. We replicated our findings in
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 1611 AA). In both studies, we find that
West-African ancestry is negatively associated with obesity, especially central obesity,
among AA men, but not among AA women (p

of WHR). In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination of male gender and
West-African genetic ancestry is associated with protection against central adiposity,
and suggest that the large racial disparity that exists among women, but not men, may
be at least partly attributed to genetic factors.

African Genetic Ancestry, Sex, and Obesity
INTRODUCTION
In the United States, African Americans (AA) exhibit higher rates
of overweight and obesity. However, this trend appears to be
mainly driven by very high rates among AA women. According
to data from the Centers for Disease Control and the National
Center for Health Statistics, the proportions of overweight or
obese AA and EA women are 82.2 and 60.9%, respectively,
whereas for men, the proportions are 70.7 and 73.2%, respectively
(CDC/NCHS, 2013). A similar trend exists for rates of type-2
diabetes, whereby the race disparity is larger among women than
among men (Brancati et al., 2000; Signorello et al., 2007). This
puzzling pattern of a greater racial disparity only among women
for obesity has not yet been explored from a genetic perspective.
Previous studies have shown that West-African ancestry
(WAA) is associated with a greater body mass index (BMI)
(Fernandez et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2006; Halder et al., 2012;
Nassir et al., 2012), and greater whole-body and trunk fat
mass (Ochs-Balcom et al., 2013). On the other hand, several
studies have shown that WAA and AA race are associated with
a lower body fat percentage, including visceral fat (Yanovski
et al., 1996; Gower et al., 1999; Beasley et al., 2009; Cardel
et al., 2011). However, some of these studies examined only
women, or only BMI, or did not examine sex differences in the
association between WAA and obesity phenotypes. Therefore,
little is known as to whether this pattern differs among men
and women, potentially resulting in the striking racial disparity
observed among women, but not among men. A recent study
by Goonesekera et al. (2015) reported a stronger (positive)
association between WAA and BMI, percent body fat, and
waist circumference (WC) among women compared to men
in a cohort study of Boston residents, and a stronger positive
association between WAA and BMI among less educated women.
These findings are consistent with the epidemiological pattern
described above, and deserving of further examination.
Based
on
these
previous
studies,
it
is
possible
that
WAA, representing a collection of many individual genetic
variants, predisposes to less central/visceral adiposity, and
that sex modifies this relationship through biological and/or
environmental factors. To help further understand if genetic
factors may play a role in the large racial disparity among women,
and the relatively small racial disparity among men, we examined
the interaction of WAA with sex on BMI, WC, and waist-to-hip
ratio (WHR) in two cohorts of AA. We also examined whether
the association of WAA with these phenotypes differs according
to income, education, or menopausal status.
METHODS
Studies
We used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) study (The Aric Investigators, 1989) and from the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study (Bild et al.,
2002) (n = 2814 and 1611 AA, respectively). Briefly, ARIC is
a prospective multi-center cohort study of EA and AA, aged
45–64, to examine risk factors for atherosclerosis. The MESA
study is also a prospective multi-center cohort study of men and
women, aged 45–85, of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds,
to investigate the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We only
included self-identified AA in this study. Datasets were obtained
from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). We
obtained IRB approval from the University of Arizona.
Genotypes and Ancestry Estimation
Both ARIC and MESA participants were genotyped with the
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). To estimate WAA, we used a panel
of 3437 SNPs developed by Tandon et al. which are especially
informative for West African vs. European ancestry among
AA, are spaced throughout the genome, are not in linkage
disequilibrium with each other in the ancestral populations,
and are available on the Affymetrix 6.0 array (Tandon et al.,
2011). With the genotypes of these SNPs, we performed a
principal components analysis (PCA) on the scaled and centered
genotypes, using the prcomp function in R Statistical Software
(R Development Core Team, 2011). To confirm that PC1 of this
analysis corresponds to WAA, we used a supervised Bayesian
approach with STRUCTURE v2.3 software (Pritchard et al.,
2000) with genotypes at the same set of SNPs for HapMap
reference individuals (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria: n = 176, and
Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe:
n = 174) (The International HapMap Consortium, 2003) as
putative W. African and European parental populations. We
used K = 2, representing two founding populations, and a burn-
in length of 20,000 for 80,000 repetitions. There was a very
strong relationship between PC1 and WAA as determined by the
supervised ancestry analysis (r2 ≥ 0.96).
Phenotypes, Income, Education, and
Menopausal Status
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by squared height
(m2). Waist measurements were taken at the umbilicus to the
nearest 0.1 cm in MESA, and nearest 1 cm in ARIC. Hip
circumference was measured from the largest diameter of the
hip, to the nearest 0.1 cm in MESA, and nearest 1 cm in
ARIC. WHR was calculated by dividing waist circumference
by hip circumference. Income was recoded to correspond
to yearly household/family income in US dollars. As yearly
income intervals were presented in the questionnaires, we chose
midpoints of these intervals. In both datasets, education was
recoded to correspond to years of education (using interval
midpoints, if needed). Menopausal status was assessed as a binary
variable in both cohorts using the response to a question asking
if women had gone through menopause or not.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in WAA, phenotypes, and other characteristics were
compared across cohorts and in men vs. women using t-
tests. The difference in percentage of women having undergone
menopause between the two cohorts was tested using a chi-
squared test. We examined the distributions of these three
phenotypes as well as the distributions of WAA, income, and
education to assess normality. We then used linear regression
to test the association of WAA with each phenotype among

all, male, and female AA, in each study and in the combined
dataset. We log transformed BMI and WC to conform to the
assumptions of residual normality. We included age, sex, income,
education, and WAA as covariates. In the combined analyses,
we additionally included a two-level categorical “study” variable
(ARIC/MESA) in order to account for variation across studies.
The interaction of WAA with sex was modeled as the product
of these two variables and included as a predictor in the linear
regression model. To test whether the association of WAA
with the obesity-related phenotypes differs according to income,
education or menopausal status, we tested the interaction of
WAA with each phenotype separately in men and/or women,
including in the model all other covariates. Statistical analyses
were carried out with R Statistical software, version 2.15.2
(R Development Core Team, 2011).
RESULTS
Association of WAA with Obesity- and
Metabolic-Related Phenotypes
Characteristics of AA participants in MESA and ARIC are shown
in Table 1. In addition to mean age being higher in MESA, levels
of income, education, BMI, and WC are also higher in MESA.
The distribution of WAA in both ARIC and MESA are shown
in Figure 1. As shown in Table 1, WAA is significantly higher
among ARIC participants (88%) than among MESA participants
(80%). However, we do not find any difference in WAA between
AA men and women in either MESA or ARIC (p = 0.81 and 0.93,
respectively, see Figure 1). The main effect models for ARIC and
MESA and for each of the three phenotypes are shown in Table 2.
Notably, among AA in ARIC, WAA is positively and significantly

associated with BMI in ARIC AA (p = 0.004), but not MESA
AA (see Table 2). In general, we observe a trend of a positive
association between WAA and BMI, no consistent association
for WC, and a negative association of WAA with WHR. We
also observe that both income and education are negatively
associated with all three phenotypes, and these associations are
much stronger in women, and nearly absent in men (data not
shown).
Figure 2 shows the sex-stratified analysis of WAA with BMI,
WC, and WHR, as well as the respective interaction p-values for
the interaction of sex with WAA. The interaction of sex with
WAA is most pronounced for WHR (pinteraction = 4.14 × 10−5),
whereby we observe a negative association of WAA with WHR
among men. Among women, there is essentially no association
between WAA and WHR. The interaction trend is similar but
slightly weaker for WC (pinteraction = 1.44 × 10−4) and BMI
(pinteraction = 5.35 × 10−4). Among women, there is a trend of
a positive association of WAA with BMI and WC. Finally, we
observed a trend in which the overall association of WAA with
BMI and WC appears to be more positive in ARIC than in MESA,
which is corroborated by results of the main-effects model shown
in Table 2.
In the pooled dataset, we do not find any evidence for
statistically significant interactions of WAA with either income
or education among men or women, or of WAA with
menopausal status among women (see Table 3).
DISCUSSION
We used genetic admixture/ancestry as a tool to investigate
whether there may be a genetic basis to the large racial disparity
in obesity that exists among women, but not among men. Our
findings suggest that WAA is associated with protection against
central obesity among AA men, but not among AA women. The
pattern may explain to a great extent the much greater racial
disparity among women (or alternatively, the much greater sex
disparity among AA, as compared to EA). One interpretation is
that AAs are exposed to environmental and/or cultural factors

BMI, WC, and WHR in ARIC, MESA and in combined dataset. Error bars

that predispose them to greater obesity than EAs. Possibly, some
of the genes that are inherited as part of their West-African
ancestry are protective against obesity, thereby “canceling out”
the obesifying effects of environment/culture, but only in men.
Another interpretation is that genetic protection is afforded
to all individuals of African descent, but this protection is
overwhelmed by cultural and/or other factors in women. For
example, previous studies have found a tendency for a larger
ideal body size among AA women as compared to White women

(e.g., Rucker and Cash, 1992; Becker et al., 1999). In addition,
evidence for greater obesity risk among women than men from
socio-economic factors has been noted in a cross-country study
(Wells et al., 2012), and in several studies examining gender and
race gaps in obesity in the United States (Zhang and Wang, 2004;
Robinson et al., 2009; Seamans et al., 2015).
Our findings are quite consistent across the two cohorts
examined. However, we did observe a trend of a stronger positive
association of WAA with BMI and WC in ARIC than in MESA
in both genders. This difference could be attributed to differences
in age, WAA, or other characteristics that differ between these
two cohorts, as shown in Table 1. The pattern of stronger positive
association among women however, holds up in both cohorts for
all three phenotypes, and is quite consistent across both cohorts
for WHR.
Previous studies have shown that AA have lower levels
of central adiposity than EAs and other ethnic/racial groups
(Yanovski et al., 1996; Beasley et al., 2009), and that WAA
is associated with lower central adiposity (Cardel et al.,
2011). However, some previous studies were limited to female
participants, or did not examine sex differences in the association
of WAA with obesity phenotypes. Here, we confirm the
Goonesekera et al. finding that the association of WAA with BMI
and WC is stronger among women. Our results suggest that this
trend may be driven by the negative association of WAA with
WC and WHR among men.
This study is strengthened by the use of two cohorts of AA
with relatively large sample sizes, the use of multiple obesity-
related measurements, and the availability of thousands of SNPs
to more accurately estimate WAA. Limitations include the
lack of more refined and metabolically relevant measurements
such as amount of visceral adiposity, and the absence of
other potentially important socio-economic confounders such as
discrimination, and access to health-care. Regarding the latter
limitation, it is difficult to tease genetic factors apart from
environmental factors. Thus, it could be that variation in WAA
is also capturing variation in environmental, social, cultural
factors beyond those that we have included in our models as
covariates.
This study suggests that there are specific genetic variants
and physiological mechanism(s) that differ among West African
and European populations, which when in the context of male
sex, result in lower central adiposity. Further research, likely
requiring larger sample sizes, is needed to identify these putative
specific genetic factors and their corresponding physiological
mechanisms. The identification and understanding of these
mechanisms could lead to improved prevention and treatment
approaches. It will also be important to also consider and
examine non-genetic factors that may underlie the greater racial
disparity among women.
