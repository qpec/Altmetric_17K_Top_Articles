 Athletes and Supplements: Prevalence and Perspectives

In elite sport, where opponents are evenly matched, small factors can determine the outcome of sporting contests. Not all athletes
know the value of making wise nutrition choices, but anything that might give a competitive edge, including dietary supplements,
can seem attractive. Between 40% and 100% of athletes typically use supplements, depending on the type of sport, level of
competition, and the definition of supplements. However, unless the athlete has a nutrient deficiency, supplementation may not
improve performance and may have a detrimental effect on both performance and health. Dietary supplements are classified as a
subcategory of food, so manufacturers are not required to provide evidence of product safety and efficacy, nor obtain approval
from regulatory bodies before marketing supplements. This creates the potential for health risks, and serious adverse effects have
been reported from the use of some dietary supplements. Athletes who compete in sports under an anti-doping code must also
realize that supplement use exposes them to a risk of ingesting banned substances or precursors of prohibited substances.
Government systems of regulations do not include specific laboratory testing for banned substances according to the WADA list,
so a separate regulatory framework to evaluate supplements for their risk of provoking a failed doping test is needed. In the high-
performance culture typical of elite sport, athletes may use supplements regardless of possible risks. A discussion around
medical, physiological, cultural, and ethical questions may be warranted to ensure that the athlete has the information needed to
make an informed choice.
Keywords: dietary supplements, elite athletes, ergogenic aids, banned substances
Many athletes, at all levels of competition, place great empha-
sis on the use of dietary supplements, but of all the factors that
determine athletic performance, supplements can play only a very
small role. Compared with factors such as talent, training, tactics,
and motivation, nutrition has a small effect on performance, and
supplements can be no more than a minor part of the athlete’s
nutrition strategy. Sporting competitions are generally designed so
that individuals and teams are fairly evenly-matched: one-sided
competition gives little satisfaction to either participants or spec-
tators. Competitors are therefore anxious to seek even the smallest
advantage. At the highest levels of competition, all of the parti-
cipants will be genetically gifted, all will have trained intensively,
and all will be highly motivated. Where the margins between
success and defeat are small, the small factors can become the ones
that determine the outcome of sporting contests. This perhaps
explains why athletes are constantly searching for any opportunity
to gain an advantage over their competitors. Lack of awareness of
basic nutrition principles also leaves many athletes and nonathletes
alike open to persuasion by the advertisements of those who profit
from the sale of dietary supplements. When looking at the use of
supplements by elite athletes, it is important to bear in mind that
sports supplements are a relatively small part of a multi-billion-
dollar industry that depends primarily on fitness enthusiasts for
sales. Elite athletes, and those aspiring to elite status, comprise only
a small part of the customer base.
Definitions and Categorizations
Sports supplements have been defined and categorized in many
ways, but none of these definitions and classifications are entirely
satisfactory. In general, categories include sports foods (gels, bars,
drinks, protein powders), vitamins and minerals, herbals and
botanicals, and ergogenic supplements (Table 1). In addition, there
is a category which includes supplements for weight loss, products
for increased libido, and there are also gluten-free, lactose-free,
allergen-free, and functional foods, which may also be defined as
food. The herbs and botanicals, functional foods, and super foods
segments, which can be defined as foods, food ingredients, or
supplements, are particularly difficult to study and define, due to
the multiple, complex compounds and the heterogeneous content
of biologically-active ingredients. Nevertheless, this category has
developed fast in the last decades, driven in part by the common
perception that natural equals healthy (Silano et al., 2011). How-
ever, in contrast to this naïve perception, some natural substances
pose a serious health threat for consumers and some may cause a
failed doping test. These findings support the need for stricter
regulation, for better enforcement of existing regulations, and for
greater awareness among consumers (Avelar-Escobar et al., 2012).
Because there is no clear boundary between dietary supplement
and foods, the field is complex to navigate. Different definitions and
categorizations of supplements obviously make it difficult to com-
pare studies, and some of the differences between published studies

SCHOLARLY REVIEW
 are simply due to different definitions. A recent meta-analysis on
supplement use by athletes identified several challenges to the
interpretation of the published evidence regarding the prevalence
of supplement use within sport (Knapik et al., 2016). The major
methodological challenges in the literature seem to be:
• Different definitions of supplements
• Diverse populations and level of performance
• Different methods of data collection
• Different timeframes
Governmental Definitions
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the following
definition of supplements: “A dietary supplement is a product
intended for ingestion that contains a ‘dietary ingredient’ intended
to add further nutritional value to (supplement) the diet” (FDA,
2017). A “dietary ingredient” may be one, or any combination, of
the following substances (in tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps,
liquids, or powders):
• Vitamins
• Minerals
• Herbs or other botanicals
• Amino acids
• Dietary substances for use by people to supplement the diet by
increasing the total dietary intake
• Concentrates, metabolites, constituents, or extracts
As dietary supplements are classified as a subcategory of food,
manufacturers are not required to provide evidence of product
safety and efficacy (Denham, 2017). While medications and
drugs are governed by rigid pharmaceutical regulation, based on
premarketing authorization and end-product control, dietary sup-
plement manufacturers and distributors are not required to obtain
approval from the FDA before marketing dietary supplements. This
creates a substantial potential risk to the health of the public, and
serious adverse effects have been reported from some dietary
supplements that are currently being marketed (FDA, 2017).
Supplements are regulated on a national rather than global
basis and regulations vary between countries. Before marketing a
dietary supplement in the United States, the manufacturers are
responsible for ensuring that the specific regulations are followed:
• The products it manufactures or distributes are safe
• Any claims made about the products are not false or
misleading
• The products comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act and FDA regulations in all other respects
In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has
similar regulations and definitions on dietary supplements, and has
established a framework for regulation of vitamin and mineral
supplements to protect consumers against potential health risks
and to ensure that they are not provided with misleading information
(Directive 2002/46/EC, EFSA, 2017). They provide a list of vita-
mins and minerals that may be added for nutritional purposes, with
specific upper and lower limits of vitamin and minerals (Directive
2002/46/EC, EFSA, 2017). With the level of resources required to
control these marketing and safety regulations in this fast-growing
segment, it is reasonable that the responsibility for committing to
those regulations lies with the manufacturer. However, it can also
create some challenges. In most countries, these regulations are
enforced by periodic, but often infrequent, testing of random samples
(Norwegian Food Safety Authority, 2017; FDA, 2017). Regulatory
bodies must prove adulteration or misbranding or risk of illness/
injury before a dietary supplement can be removed from the market.
This is time-consuming and requires substantial resources.

Examples
Comments: Risk-Assessments
Sports foods: Specialized products
used to provide a practical source of
nutrients when it is impractical to
consume everyday foods
Sports drink, sports gel, liquid meal,
sports confectionery, sports bar
Most sports foods, but not all, are low risk for contamination with
prohibited substances.
Medical supplements: Used to treat
clinical issues, including diagnosed
nutrient deficiencies
Iron, calcium, multivitamin/mineral,
vitamin D, probiotics (gut/immune)
Most—but not all—vitamin and mineral supplements purchased at
a pharmacy are produced with a strict pharmaceutical control.
Ergogenic supplements: Supplements
intended to enhance performance
Caffeine, β-alanine, bicarbonate, nitrate
(beetroot juice), creatine
Ergogenic supplements that are not on the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) prohibited list are concentrates of substances
found in food. There is a risk of cross-contamination with pro-
hibited or harmful substances and of deliberate adulteration by the
addition of pharmaceutical agents.
Functional food and superfoods:
Purported to optimize health and
performance
Herbs, seaweed, spirulina organic food,
plant fibers, seeds (chia seeds), natural
alkalizing fruits, raw juice and berry,
(acai, goji) extracts
No guarantee of the amount of active biological substance. Product
heterogeneity makes it hard to identify and categorize biologically-
active ingredients. Herbal or traditional products, including animal
and plant materials, are found principally in Chinese, Korean, and/
or herbal medicine prescriptions. Governmental regulation and
policies differ between countries.
Other supplements: Includes a wide
range of herbal and botanical extracts
and concentrates
Supplements for: weight loss (shakes,
tablets), increased energy, increased
libido, prevention of hair loss
May contain central nervous system stimulants (e.g., ephedrine)
and hormones or hormone precursors (e.g., norandrostenedione and
norandrostenediol). They are considered high risk for adulteration
due to the need for rapid and noticeable results by the consumer to
promote continued use of the product. To achieve these results,
potent pharmaceuticals are sometimes added by the manufacturers.

 According to marketing regulations in the United States, a
dietary supplement cannot claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent
any disease. However, a study of 443 websites of 8 bestselling herbal
products showed that 81% made one or more health claims; 55%
claimed the product treated, prevented, diagnosed, or cured specific
diseases; and 52% of those making claims omitted the federal
disclaimer (Morris & Avorn, 2003). In another study, 75% of the
most popular herbal supplements did not include on the label the key
safety messages about warnings for medical conditions, drug inter-
actions, and side effects (Raynor et al., 2011). Undoubtedly, stricter
enforcement of the existing regulations that apply to manufacturers
and distributors is needed, but, without the necessary resources to do
tests and follow-up, the effect will continue to be limited.
The government systems of regulations and independent
manufacturing quality programs do not include specific laboratory
testing for banned substances according the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA) list. A separate regulatory framework to evaluate
supplements for their risk of provoking a failed doping test would
be needed, but there is limited interest from the regulatory bodies,
perhaps because this represents such a small part of the market.
Motivations for Supplement Use
There are several reasons why it is important to understand the
athlete’s motivation for supplements use, whereas one reason is to
develop strategies for responsible supplement use. Another reason
is to minimize the risk of excessive and harmful supplement use
and to separate sports foods and medical supplements (used to treat
clinical issues) from the use of ergogenic supplements that are
intended specifically to enhance performance. There may be
several different motivational factors for each category of supple-
ments; food and supplements containing essential nutrients (e.g.,
vitamins) are mainly used for health reasons, with performance
effects being secondary to better health, while ergogenic aids are
used with the intention of maximizing performance. Further,
athlete support staff may want to encourage a food-based approach
to nutrition education, since the literature shows that most athletes
can cover their nutrient needs through a varied diet, provided the
energy intake is moderate to high (Thomas et al., 2016).
The final reason may be to identify the “gray zone”, where
athletes who use dietary supplements may be associated with an
accepting attitude of doping at a later stage (the “gateway” theory,
presented by Backhouse et al., 2013). There are some data to
suggest that supplement users have more positive attitudes toward
doping, and that they believe that doping is an effective way to
increase performance (Backhouse et al., 2013). Others report that
there seems to be an underlying cognitive component in the
association between use of supplements and doping, and that
use of supplements may influence reasoning patterns and the
motivational incentive in favor of using prohibited substances at
a later stage, even among adolescent athletes (Barkoukis et al.,
2015). According to the literature, the prevalence of doping is
higher in supplement users than in athletes who do not use
supplements (Backhouse et al., 2013; Barkoukis et al., 2015). It
is, however, important to note that these studies were not designed
to identify a direct causality between supplement use and doping.
Prevalence of Supplement Use
Surveys regarding use of dietary supplements in the general
population have consistently shown that supplements are used
by a large part of the population, and this is substantiated by
the sales figures of what is now a multi-billion-dollar global
industry (Hämeen-Anttila et al., 2011; Timbo et al., 2006). Ac-
cording to national surveys of the general population in the United
States, more than 40% of the adult population used dietary
supplements in the period from 1988–1994, and this had increased
to over one-half during 2003–2006 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2011). The Council for Responsible Nutrition
(CRN), an industry-funded body, has an annual survey on dietary
supplements, with a national sample of 2,007 adults aged ∼18 years
living in the United States. According to the most recent survey,
71% of US adults (more than 170 million people) report use of
dietary supplements for the following reasons: “an overall health/
wellness benefit”, “to get energy”, and “to fill nutrient gaps in my
diet” (CRN Consumer Survey on Dietary Supplements, 2016).
That is an increase from 2015, where 68% reported intake of
dietary
supplements
(CRN
Consumer
Survey
on
Dietary
Supplements, 2015). The most used supplements were vitamin
and mineral products. Supplement users aged 18–34 years reported
in 2015 that they anticipated their supplement use to increase over
the next 5 years. Data from the 2016 survey suggest that this
projection is likely to be realized, as young adults are increasing
their use of dietary supplements.
Use of dietary supplements within athletic populations is
reported to be relatively high in most studies (Baylis et al.,
2001; Heikkinen et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2011; Lun et al.,
2012) (Table 2). This agrees with the study by Sobal and Marquart
(1994), who undertook a comprehensive analysis of published
studies of supplement use among collegiate athletes and elite
athletes. A total of 10,274 athletes, males and females, were
included in this meta-analysis, which showed that 46% of college
athletes and 59% of elite athletes used dietary supplements (Sobal
& Marquart, 1994).
As mentioned above, the review and meta-analysis by Knapik
et al. (2016) highlighted some of the challenges when comparing
data from different studies due to different methods of data
collection. For example, Lun et al. (2012) reported a supplementa-
tion use of 81–100% in a sample of 440 Canadian elite athletes, of
whom 76% were competing at the international level. They found
an association between total weekly training hours and supplement
use, with an increasing prevalence from 67% for <5 weekly
training hours to 95% for those training >25 hr/week. Not surpris-
ingly, the most used supplements were sports supplements, which
are often recommended by professional support staff for use in
relation to training and competitions.
The association between supplement use and training load,
found by Lun et al. (2012), agrees with the review by Knapik et al.
(2016) and with more recent reports by Erdman et al. (2006) and
Heikkinen et al. (2002), who concluded that elite athletes used
more supplements than nonelite athletes, and that sports supple-
ments were the supplement used most commonly. Further, several
studies show that athletes from endurance-based sports use supple-
ments to a greater extent than athletes from other sport categories
(Erdman et al., 2006; Heikkinen et al., 2002; Lun et al., 2012; Shaw
et al., 2016).
An alternative way of assessing the prevalence of supplement
use is by analysis of declaration forms completed by athletes who
are selected for doping control. In these settings, the athletes are
asked to declare any prescription or nonprescription medication,
vitamins, food supplements, herbal products, and any other sub-
stance they have taken within the past 7 days. Table 2 shows that
athletes declare the use of a wide range of different supplements,

 with vitamins and proteins/amino acids being the most widely-used
supplements (Corrigan & Kazlauskas, 2003; Tscholl et al., 2010;
Tsitsimpikou et al., 2009).
These data should, however, be interpreted with caution. Some
athletes (especially younger athletes) may experience doping
controls as stressful and/or consider dietary supplements as less
important information in these settings; also, the declaration of
substances is limited to a 7-days timeframe prior to testing.
Furthermore, most studies use self-reporting data via question-
naires or declaration reports and can be a valuable source of
information only if the athletes report truthfully. Athletes may
forget to declare supplements that they have been taking, or they
may be aware that contaminated supplements may cause an adverse
finding and may therefore be tempted to declare a wide range of
products “just in case”.
Prevalence and Sex
Sobal and Marquart (1994) found a higher use of dietary supple-
ment in female athletes (57%) than in male athletes (47%). Nieper
(2005) investigated the use of nutritional supplements in a small
sample of 32 national track and field athletes competing at the
World Junior Championships 2004, and found that 62% of the
athletes reported use of supplements, with a trend toward a higher
use in female athletes (75%) than in males (55%) (Table 2). In
contrast to this, however, Karimian and Esfahani (2011) examined
supplement use in 250 male and 250 female bodybuilders in Iran;
supplement use was reported by 87% of the males but by only 11%
of the females. Further, several studies did not find any difference
between sexes (Kim et al., 2013; Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2003;
Wiens et al., 2014). Wiens et al. (2014) reported no overall sex-
related difference in use of supplement per se, but they found that
male athletes were more likely to consume protein powder and
ergogenic supplements, typically associated with increased muscle
mass, whereas female athletes were most likely to consume vitamin
and mineral supplements, typically associated with increased
health. Although more sex-specific studies in elite athletes are
needed, it is tempting to conclude that sex-specific use of supple-
ments seems to be related to the type of supplements (e.g., creatine
vs. vitamins) and to the character and culture of the sports
(endurance vs. aesthetic).
Prevalence and Age
The use of supplements seems to be endemic in the athletic
population, and there is evidence that supplement use begins at
an early age. Among 164 young (aged 10–25 years) German elite
athletes, the prevalence of dietary supplement use was estimated to
be 80% (Braun et al., 2009). This is markedly higher than data of
the German National Nutrition Survey II, which showed that 16–
19% of all German adolescents (aged 14–18 years) reported using
dietary supplements (Federal Research Center for Nutrition and
Food, 2008). Braun et al. (2009) reported that the use of supple-
ments differed between the age categories and level of perfor-
mance: athletes >18 years competing at the international level
reported higher use (100%) than younger athletes competing at the
national or regional level. Several studies show the same pattern of
supplement use among young athletes, where prevalence, type, and
number of supplements used increase with increasing age and
training hours/load (Corrigan & Kazlauskas, 2003; Dietz et al.,
2014; Parnell et al., 2015; Pedrinelli et al., 2015; Petroczi &
Naughton, 2008; Tscholl et al., 2008).
Maughan et al. (2007) recommended that athletes <18 years of
age not engage in supplement use, except where medically indicted
(e.g., iron-deficiency), but the evidence suggests that this is not the
prevailing attitude in health teams and medical personnel or among
parents and coaches surrounding the athlete. Figure 1 suggests how
a progressive nutrition strategy might be developed for young
athletes.

 To conclude, the prevalence of athletes using supplements
varies greatly between surveys, with a range of reported use from
40–100%, indicating that use is widespread in athletic populations.
Sports supplements, vitamin and mineral supplements, and herbs
(dependent on country of origin) are generally the most used
supplements.
Potential Benefits of Supplement Use
in Athletes
The use of supplements in sport tends to be viewed in negative
terms, with a focus on reducing prevalence and protecting the
athlete from using supplements that may cause a positive doping
test or may be harmful to health. However, supplements may be
important in some stages in life or for some athletes with nutritional
challenges, such as the athlete who is vegan or who has a specific
medical condition. The governments in many Nordic countries
have official guidelines regarding specific supplements, such as
daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D (Nordic Nutrition
Recommendations, 2014). Others permit the fortification of spe-
cific foods with essential nutrients (iron, calcium, B vitamins, etc.).
When it comes to the athletic population, the official guidelines still
apply (Wardenaar et al., 2017), and there may be other situations
where athletes would benefit from supplements (Table 3). In these
circumstances, it may be beneficial to use a carefully-designed
program of supplementation to optimize health and performance.
Pattern and Reasoning for Use
Users cite various reasons for consuming dietary supplements,
though they are often very different from the specific uses identified
above. These reasons are more often based on unfounded beliefs
than on any understanding of the issues at stake. Dietary supple-
ments may not be promoted for the prevention or treatment of
illness, but it is obvious that many consumers use them for this
purpose. Sport-specific reasons for supplement use include a belief
that the stress of intense training/competition cannot be met by food
alone, and that supplements can offer a specific advantage in either
training or competition. There is also an awareness that successful
competitors are using supplements, and the use of supplements is
often endorsed or encouraged by influential individuals in the
athlete’s circle, including coaches, parents, and fellow athletes.
In the general population, consumption of nutritional supple-
ments is often driven by a belief that they confer health benefits
above and beyond those that can be achieved by eating normal
foods (Reinert et al., 2007). Among athletes and physically active
individuals, there are several additional issues related specifically
to the physical and mental aspects of exercise performance. Of
course, athletes are also concerned to stay healthy as neither
effective training nor successful competition is possible if health
is compromised. Illness or injury that requires periods of time out
from training can disrupt preparations, and illness at the time of key
competitions can ruin an athlete’s competitive season. Supple-
ments that promise to enhance recovery, whether from illness,
injury, or training, are obviously popular with athletes, and they
often use a combination of products (Baylis et al., 2001; Heikkinen
et al., 2002).
Reasons for using supplements among 310 competitors at the
IAAF World Championships were: to aid recovery from training
(71%), for health (52%), to improve performance (46%), to prevent
or treat an illness (40%), and to compensate for a poor diet (29%)
(Maughan et al., 2007). Corrigan and Kazlauskas (2003) found that
51% of the 2,758 athletes selected for doping control at the Sydney
Olympic Games of 2000 reported the use of vitamin supplements
for the following reasons/statements: (a) vitamins enhance perfor-
mance; (b) athletes have greater requirements than the sedentary
population; (c) fear that others who take them could have a
competitive edge; (d) if one is good, 10 or more must be better;
(e) vitamins are needed to overcome stress; (f) vitamins are lost in
the sweat during exercise; and (g) turnover of vitamins is increased
during exercise (Corrigan & Kazlauskas, 2003) (Table 2).
The available information does not provide a complete picture
of the athletes’ intentions and rationale relating to supplement use.
When comparing their reasons for supplement use with the pro-
ducts that they report consuming, there seems to be a mismatch,
especially in younger athletes (Baylis et al., 2001; de Silva et al.,
2010; Parnell et al., 2015; Trakman et al., 2016; Wiens et al., 2014).
For example, athletes reported using multivitamins to increase
athletic performance or vitamin water to gain strength and power.
A summary of the most commonly cited reasons for supple-
ment use is given in Figure 4.
Informed Choices
Some athletes use supplements on an “ad hoc basis”, unaware of
what the active ingredient(s) are or of the amount of those
ingredients. Consuming multiple supplements may increase the
risk of exposure to harmful levels of specific substances or inter-
actions causing adverse health outcomes (e.g., calcium and inter-
ference of iron uptake) (Baylis et al., 2001; de Silva et al., 2010;
Parnell et al., 2015; Trakman et al., 2016; Wiens et al., 2014). The
indiscriminate use of supplements is a cause for concern and
demands educational interventions at an early age for athletes,
coaches, and parents/family members.
There is some evidence—largely anecdotal, but supported by
some evidence from surveys—that the quantity of supplements
used by athletes often exceeds the recommended amount. This
“more is better” philosophy is encouraged by the belief that rivals
are using even higher doses. Even elite athletes may not have
access to professional advice that might counter some of these
beliefs. Heikkinen et al. (2011) reported that only 27% of the 372

 elite Finnish athletes surveyed in 2009 had an opportunity to
consult a sports nutrition professional. Even when these opportu-
nities are available, not all athletes choose to make use of them,
preferring instead to get their nutrition advice from sources that
they may see as being more congenial. Nieper (2005) showed
similar results in the 32 national track and field athletes, where 72%
of the athletes had access to a sports dietician but chose not to use
that resource. Coaches (65%) had the greatest influence on

 supplementation practices, with doctors (25%) and sports dieti-
cians (30%) being less important (Nieper, 2005). This agrees with
the study from Wiens et al. (2014), where they reported that the
main sources of information were family/friends (74%), coaches
(44%), athletic trainers (40%), medical doctors (33%), and, in a
lower place than the others, sport nutritionists (32%), which is
similar to the findings of other studies (Braun et al., 2009; Kim
et al., 2011).
According to the literature, it seems that most athletes get
dietary advice from coaches, fellow athletes, and other important

 persons such as family and friends (Denham, 2017; Heikkinen
et al., 2011; Nieper, 2005; Sundgot-Borgen et al., 2003). Athletes
who have access to a sports dietitian may choose not to use that
opportunity for various reasons. Lovell et al. (2013) observed that
athletes’ efficacy expectations of a female sports dietitian and their
willingness to work with them are influenced by the dietitians’
physical appearance: nonobese dietitians were ranked and rated
more positively by the athletes in terms of their preference to work
with them and their perceived effectiveness than dietitians classi-
fied as obese. Athletes who perceive a dietitian to be overweight
may also conclude that they have limited competence in sports
nutrition, although that may not be the case. Support staff must
fully appreciate the sports-specific culture and physiological de-
mands of the sport and must also accept that most elite athletes are
highly driven by performance, with a sometimes extreme focus on
performance rather than on health. If the athlete and dietitian cannot
engage at the same level of communication and experience, it
might be difficult to build the trust and alliances that are essential
for a “hands-on” practitioner.
A recent study from the Netherlands evaluated the effect of
dietary counseling on supplement use and found that athletes who
had counseling used more supplements than those who did not
(Wardenaar et al., 2017). The study found that the increased use
was mainly due to an increased use of vitamin supplements,
mirroring the recommendations the athletes got during counseling.
This suggests that information from a counselor may have a
positive influence, but limitations in the study design limit the
conclusions that can be drawn from this study.
Marik and Flemmer (2012) suggested that the belief that
supplements can confer health and performance benefits for the
average consumer may be erroneous. They concluded that “with
the possible exceptions of Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids there
is no data to support the widespread use of dietary supplements in
Westernized populations; indeed, many of these supplements may
be harmful” (p. 161). Though the quality of the evidence on which
these conclusions were based was often poor, and the analysis of
the evidence lacked rigor, this review does raise legitimate con-
cerns regarding the widespread assumption that supplement use
confers health benefits on the consumer and that it is free from any
risk of adverse health outcomes. This supports the view of Rock
(2007), who reported that individuals who use dietary supplements
generally report above-average dietary nutrient intakes and health-
ier diets. Nieper’s study of national track and field athletes, showed
that 83% of the athletes who did not use supplements believed they
could be harmful, compared to only 42% of those who used
supplements (Nieper, 2005). Further, athletes who used supple-
ments were also more likely to believe that exercise increases the
need for supplements (83% compared to 18%; Nieper, 2005).
Unless an athlete has a nutrient deficiency, supplementation is
unlikely to improve health or performance and can in fact have a
detrimental effect on both performance, via blunted training adap-
tation (Paulsen et al., 2014), and on health, via increased risk of
injuries and toxicity (García-Cortés et al., 2016). In addition,
athletes who compete in sports under an anti-doping code must
realize that supplement use exposes them to a risk of a positive
doping test (Maughan, 2013). Thus, there are several factors and
questions to consider if an athlete wants to use supplement:
1. Is there a scientific rationale for a potential positive effect on
health and/or performance?
2. Is it possible that the supplement can have an adverse effect on
health and/or performance?
3. Does the athlete need it?
4. Is it safe in the long-term?
If the supplement passes the questions, the practitioner has to
make sure that the supplements are used appropriately. Sometimes
athletes want to use supplements regardless of available informa-
tion and recommendations. In these cases, the practitioner should
ensure that the athlete has the information needed to make an
informed choice, as the final responsibility rests with the athlete. A
suggested flowchart related to use and evaluation of supplements is
presented in Figures 2 and 3.
Summary and Practical Implications
Many athletes place great emphasis on the use of dietary supple-
ments, but it is important to recognize that, of all the factors that

 determine athletic performance, supplements have only a very
small role. Knowing that supplement use exposes them to a risk
of ingesting banned substances or precursors of prohibited sub-
stances, a cost-benefit analysis should be part of any discussion
about supplement use. Working with elite athletes involves being a
part of a high-performance culture where performances are mea-
sured by results, and every small improvement counts. If basic
ethical guidelines regarding supplements and doping are not part of
the culture or are not clearly communicated, athletes may feel
encouraged to take high-risk decisions to prioritize performance. A
discussion around medical, physiological, cultural, and ethical
questions may be warranted, to ensure that the athlete has the
information needed to make an informed choice.
