Objective The objective of this research is to generate 
new evidence on financial implications of medicines 
out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for households. Another 
objective is to investigate which disease conditions 
contributed to a significant proportion of households’ 
financial burden.
setting All Indian states including union territories, 
1993–2014.
Design Repeated cross-sectional household surveys.
Data Secondary data of nationwide Consumer 
Expenditure Surveys for the years 1993–1994, 2004–2005 
and 2011–2012 and one wave of Social Consumption: 
Health for the year 2014 from National Sample Survey 
Organisation.
Outcome measures OOP expenditure on healthcare in 
general and medicines in specific.
results Total OOP payments and medicines OOP 
payments were estimated to be 6.77% (95% CI 6.70% 
to 6.84%) and 4.49% (95% CI 4.45% to 4.54%) of total 
consumption expenditure, respectively, in the year 2011–
2012 which marked significant increase since 1993–1994. 
These proportions were 11.46% (95% CI 11.36% to 
11.56%) and 7.60% (95% CI 7.54% to 7.67%) of non-food 
expenditure, respectively, in the same year. Total OOP 
payments and medicines OOP payments were catastrophic 
for 17.9% (95% CI 17.7% to 18.2%) and 11.2% (95% CI 
11.0% to 11.4%) households, respectively, in 2011–2012 
at the 10% of total consumption expenditure threshold, 
implying 29 million households incurred catastrophic OOP 
payments in the year 2011–2012. Further, medicines 
OOP payments pushed 3.09% (95% CI 2.99% to 3.20%), 
implying 38 million persons into poverty in the year 
2011–2012. Among the leading cause of diseases that 
caused significant OOP payments are cancers, injuries, 
cardiovascular diseases, genitourinary conditions and 
mental disorders.
Conclusions Purchase of medicines constitutes the 
single largest component of the total OOP payments by 
households. Hence, strengthening government intervention 
in providing medicines free in public healthcare facilities 
has the potential to considerably reduce medicine-related 
spending and total OOP payments of households and 
reduction in OOP-induced poverty.
bACkgrOunD 
Households’ in India bear significant finan-
cial burden on account of medical treat-
ment, as the current prepayment and risk 
pooling mechanisms are inadequate. Since 
both government funding and social health 
insurance contributions are insufficient to 
meet healthcare needs of households, over 
three-fourth of all healthcare payments are 
paid out of pocket (OOP) at the point of 
service delivery while medicines purchase 
(approximately 63%) account for the single 
largest component of these payments.1 Avail-
able literature suggests that medicine OOP 
spending has dominated total OOP payments 
over the years.2 Hence, it can be suggested 
that expenditure on medicines is major cause 
of catastrophe and impoverishment at the 
household level.3 
India has the distinction of being pharmacy 
of the global South—supplies affordable, life 
saving, quality generic medicines. It ranks 
4th in terms of volumes and 13th in terms 
of value of pharmaceuticals produced glob-
ally.4 However, according to a WHO report, 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► The study used multiple points of time and nationally 
representative data set to highlight the financial bur-
den of households out-of-pocket (OOP) payments on 
medicines in India.
 
► The paper links medicines OOP payments by house-
holds with leading disease conditions and identify 
key disease conditions which cause medicines OOP 
payments.
 
► The study has limitations as it uses arbitrary thresh-
old for measuring catastrophic payments.
 
► The ailments, disease conditions and the associated 
OOP expenditure reported by the households in the 
survey are self-reports and not clinically diagnosed.

around 68% of the Indian population have limited or 
no access to essential medicines.5 In addition, literature 
suggests that over last two decades availability of free 
medicines in public health facilities has declined from 
31.2% to 8.9% for inpatient care and from 17.8% to 
5.9% for outpatient care.6 Another study demonstrated 
that medicines purchase alone constituted over 70% of 
overall OOP payments. In addition, the study demon-
strated that by removing OOP payments for outpatient 
care on medicines, the percentage of people falling below 
poverty because of spending on health reduced to just 
0.5% whereas removing OOP payments for inpatient care 
resulted in a negligible decline in poverty head count 
ratio and poverty gap highlighting the role of medicines 
expenditure in healthcare-related impoverishment.7
Using impoverishment tool to measure affordability, 
one study assessed the impoverishment effect of medi-
cines purchases by households in 16 low-income and 
middle-income economies.8 Comparing four key medi-
cine prices to household income, and using World Bank 
poverty levels of US$1.25 or US$2 PPP per day, the study 
concluded that a substantial number of people had to 
bear financial burden due to unaffordability of medi-
cines. For example, it was pointed out that an originator 
brand atenolol purchase by individuals would push an 
additional 22% of population below the US$1.25 PPP per 
day measurement while even a generic equivalent of 
atenolol was likely to push about 7% of population below 
poverty levels in Philippines.9 Analysing economic impli-
cations of non-communicable disease (NCD) in India, 
a few studies also reported in the past that households 
incur significant OOP payment burden in certain condi-
tions like cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers.10 11 
Using 2004 National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) 
data, another study highlighted that hospitalisation with 
CVD resulted in 12% higher odds of incurring cata-
strophic spending and 37% greater odds of falling into 
poverty compared with those hospitalised with commu-
nicable conditions. For cancer, the impact was greatest 
with the odds of catastrophic expenditures 170% higher 
than the odds of incurring catastrophic spending when 
hospital stays are due to a communicable disease condi-
tion.12 However, these studies do not reflect on the rela-
tive contribution of medicine in total OOP burden for 
the diseases they analysed.
Available evidence, both global and Indian, provides 
insights about the incidence of catastrophic payments 
and impoverishment impact of rising households OOP 
payments.2 3 13–15 The literature on equity dimensions 
involving both catastrophe and impoverishment has 
attempted to address complex methodological and statis-
tical approaches in measurements. However, there is 
lack of evidence on catastrophe and impoverishment on 
account of household’s medicine OOP expenditure from 
inpatient and outpatient treatment costs perspective and 
from the disease-specific dimension. Given that medi-
cines contribute to more than 66.6% of OOP healthcare 
expenditure, the focus of this research is to explore the 
consequences of high medicines OOP spending at the 
household level. Further, we investigated which disease 
conditions are contributing to high financial burden 
on households. We attempted to answer—what is the 
relative burden of medicines OOP payments by house-
holds in total OOP payments, catastrophic and poverty 
head counts? And which disease conditions cause a rela-
tively higher financial disruption in the living status of 
households?

Data
The study uses secondary data from three waves of nation-
ally representative ‘Consumer Expenditure Surveys’ 
(CES): 1993–1994, 2004–2005 and 2011–2012, conducted 
by the NSSO. In addition, Health and Morbidity Survey 
(HMS) 2014 of the NSSO was used for disease-wise distri-
bution of OOP payment burden. While the sample size of 
CES varied between 100 000 and 125 000 thousand house-
holds across different rounds, the sample size in HMS 
2014 was approximately 72 000 households.
The CES collect socioeconomic and demographic 
information of households with key focus on household 
spending involving roughly 350 food and non-food items. 
OOP medical expenses incurred by households are sepa-
rately recorded for inpatient and outpatient services. The 
recall periods are 1 year and 30 days for inpatient and 
outpatient expenses, respectively. HMS collects detailed 
information on morbidity pattern, utilisation of health-
care services and associated expenditure by households. 
The HMS too separately records expenditure for inpa-
tient and outpatient. However, unlike in CES the recall 
period for outpatient in HMS is 15 days.
Both CES and HMS are repeated cross-sectional surveys 
that are representative at the national and state levels. All 
districts of a state are included for sampling purposes. 
Households in CES are sampled evenly in quarterly 
subrounds beginning on 1 July and ending on 30 June 
of the following year, with equal numbers of households 
allotted in each quarterly subround, to address season-
ality. In HMS, survey was completed in two subrounds 
during 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2014. All estimates in 
the present paper are sample weighted.
Outcome indicators
Using CES, we estimated four household-level indicators 
involving financial burden of illness: (1) per household 
member monthly OOP spending on medicines (infla-
tion adjusted), (2) OOP spending on medicines as a share 
of total household and non-food spending (3) percentage 
of households reporting catastrophic payments on medi-
cines and (4) percentage of households slipping into 
poverty after netting out medicines OOP payments from 
households’ total consumption expenditure. Total OOP 
spending of households was estimated by adding together 
expenditure involving different  components of OOP 
payments. For inpatient OOP payment, we considered

institutional spending on medicines, X-ray, ECG, patho-
logical tests etc, doctor’s/surgeon’s fee, hospital and 
nursing charges and other medical expenses. For outpa-
tient OOP payment, the components of expenditure are 
medicines, X-ray, ECG, pathological tests etc, doctor’s/
surgeon’s fee, family planning services and other medical 
expenses. Expenditure on medicines is directly reported 
in the data set, both for inpatient and outpatient services 
(see online supplementary tables A–I). All the anal-
yses report mean OOP spending on two parallel tracks: 
aggregated (across components of OOP) OOP payments 
(henceforth referred to as ‘total OOP’) and OOP 
payments only on account of medicine purchase (hence-
forth referred to as medicine/drug OOP).
Catastrophic payment for healthcare is defined as OOP 
payments being higher to a predefined threshold of total 
household consumption expenditure or alternatively 
household’s non-food expenditure. For measuring cata-
strophic expenditure,2 9 instead of sticking to a particular 
threshold, we considered a range of thresholds.2 16–18 We 
also considered alternative thresholds of OOP spending 
as a share of household non-food expenditure. For OOP 
payment induced poverty estimates, we used two different 
poverty lines: (1) Indian official state-specific rural and 
urban poverty lines19 and (2) international poverty line 
based on US$1 per day per person adjusted to US$1.9 
purchasing power parity (PPP) per day per person for 
the year 2011–2012.20 Yet another important poverty 
indicator, which provides estimates around magnitude of 
poverty deepening, is poverty gap. Using both the poverty 
lines separately, we also estimated mean poverty gaps for 
the poor. Details of the method used for catastrophic and 
poverty estimates are presented in (online supplementary 
annexure).
In addition, we used NSSO 2014 HMS data for estimating 
disease level total and medicine OOP spending separately 
for inpatient and outpatient. Unlike CES, OOP spending 
in HMS 2014 has not been recorded as a part of the total 
household consumption expenditure and instead of esti-
mating disease-wise catastrophic head count, we present 
distribution of disease conditions based on incidence of 
occurrence and range of OOP spending separately for 
outpatient (15 days recall converted for 30 days) and inpa-
tient (365 days recall converted for 30 days). This helped 
identifying disease conditions, separately for outpatient 
and inpatient, which are high-frequency occurrence and 
greater incidence of OOP spending.
results
First, we present basic financial burden indicators for 
the years 1993–1994, 2004–2005 and 2011–2012 in 
table 1. Over 80% of populations are reportedly spending 
OOP while seeking treatment, during 2011–2012. The 
proportion of population reporting any OOP payments 
have increased sharply from about 60% during 1993–
1994 to 80% in 2011–2012. In respect to medicines 
spending, approximately every OOP spending is associ-
ated with expenditure on medicines. There was a signif-
icant increase (more than 50%) in household’s total

consumption expenditure in real terms from INR517 in 
1993–1994 to INR794 in 2011–2012. However, during the 
same period total OOP payments increased by more than 
100% from INR26 in 1993–1994 to INR54 in 2011–2012 
in real terms. The rise in OOP payments on medicines 
has been more than 70% during the same period. Conse-
quently, the share of spending on health from households’ 
overall consumption expenditure have registered sharp 
increase during the past two decades, from a moderate 
4.8% during 1993–1994 to nearly 7% in 2011–2012. If we 
were to net out food expenditure from total household 
consumption spending, which are considered a necessity, 
the share of health spending remained stagnant but as 
high as 11%–12% during the period under consideration. 
It may be observed that in 2011–2012, medicines alone 
contributed up to 67% of the total OOP payments.
A higher burden of households’ OOP payment is often 
associated with impoverishment and catastrophe. In 
table 2, we present a set of catastrophic cut-offs measured 
as a share of OOP payments to total household consump-
tion expenditure and non-food expenditure. Estimates 
for both total OOP payments as well as medicine OOP 
payments by households are presented.
Over one-third of Indian households incurred OOP 
payments at 5% threshold of total household expendi-
ture in 2011–2012. This percentage was lower in 1993–
1994 (27%) and 2004–2005 (28%). At the 25% threshold 
of total household expenditure, over 4% households 
reported incurring OOP payments in 2011–2012. This 
essentially translates to approximately 11 million Indian 
households. Out of these, more than 4.4 million house-
holds incurred such payments only on account of 
purchase of medicines. At a lower threshold of 10% of 
total household expenditure, the number of households 
facing catastrophe is approximately 46 millions, of which 
29 million households incurred catastrophe on account 
of OOP payments on medicines alone. Considering only 
non-food expenditure of households as the basic living 
status variable, approximately similar number of house-
holds incurred medicines OOP payments in 2011–2012 
with OOP payments being as high as 40% of their 
non-food expenditure.
Next, we present implications of total and medicine 
OOP payments on poverty estimates (table 3). To facilitate 
interpretation, we present three basic head count ratio 
indicators: (1) gross head count—percentage of popu-
lation below poverty line, (2) net of OOP head count—
percentage of population below poverty line after netting 
out OOP payments from household consumption expen-
diture and (3) OOP payments induced poverty which is 
the difference of the first two reflecting rise in poverty 
ratio owing to OOP payments. The last two indicators are 
presented separately for total OOP payments and medi-
cine OOP payments. Table 3 also provides estimates on 
poverty gap representing extent of poverty deepening in 
terms of monetary value. All these indicators are estimated 
using Indian official poverty line (Tendulkar Committee 
method) and international poverty line of US$1.90 PPP.
The difference in mean head count measure of 
gross and net poverty ratios reflects the percentage of

the same measurement, the head count measure for 
households OOP payments on medicines appear to have 
marginally declined from 3.59% in 1993–1994 to 3.09% 
during 2011–2012 using the international poverty line. As 
far as poverty gap is concerned, based on the Indian offi-
cial poverty line, total OOP payments and OOP payments 
on medicines resulted in poverty deepening among poor 
by INR29 and INR23, respectively, in 2011–2012. Further 
poverty deepening because of total and medicines OOP 
payments sharply increased in 2012 compared with that 
in the years 2004–2005 and 1993–1994.
OOP expenditure by disease conditions
We also conducted a disaggregated analysis on disease-
wise expenditure with reference to total OOP payments 
and medicines OOP payments and by type of care—
inpatient care versus outpatient care. The survey results 
suggested that most common health condition for 
seeking outpatient care was fever (22.7%) and for inpa-
tient care was childbirth (27.3%). In addition, our esti-
mates suggest that households incurred highest monthly 
per capita OOP spending both for inpatient and outpa-
tient care on account of cancer treatment (INR5054 and 
INR5121, respectively) followed by injuries for outpatient 
care (INR3045) and cardiovascular events for inpatient 
care (INR2808).
We also mapped disease-wise expenditure, frequency 
of healthcare utilisation and type of care to demon-
strate that hospitalisation and outpatient care can 
lead to catastrophe and impoverishment of house-
holds (figure 1). For example, our estimates suggest 
that monthly per capita medicines OOP payments for 
cancer care were significantly higher in outpatient care 
as compared with the inpatient care. However, as far as 
total OOP spending for cancer treatment is concerned,

it is almost similar across inpatient and outpatient but 
significantly higher compared with that for other disease 
conditions. In contrast, in respect to cardiovascular 
conditions, medicines OOP payments were similar for 
both inpatient and outpatient treatment, but total OOP 
payments were significantly higher for inpatient treat-
ment as against outpatient treatment. In treatments 
involving gastroenterology conditions, however, both 
medicines OOP payments and total OOP payments were 
higher for outpatient compared with inpatient treatment. 
Similarly, for mental disorders, medicines OOP payments 
were higher for outpatient care compared with inpatient, 
but total OOP payments were almost similar both for 
outpatient and inpatient treatment. Therefore, it is noted 
that the average monthly medicines OOP payments were 
consistently higher for outpatient care as compared with 
inpatient care among key disease conditions. A relatively 
higher frequency of outpatient treatment visits compared 
with inpatient treatment coupled with a significantly 
larger medicines OOP payment may yield a higher inci-
dence of catastrophe. A detailed estimate of prevalence 
and OOP payments by disease conditions cross-classified 
by inpatient and outpatient care are presented in (online 
supplementary tables A–II).
Further, we plotted outpatient and inpatient OOP 
payments and medicine-related OOP payments with 
respect to households ‘usual’ consumption expen-
diture. In figure 2, households are ranked from the 
poorest to the richest on the X-axis based on their mean 
monthly per person consumption expenditure and on 
the Y-axis mean monthly per person OOP expenditure 
(total and medicine) are measured separately for outpa-
tient and inpatient. It is observed that for a number of 
households, average monthly outpatient expenditure is 
significantly higher in relation to household’s non-med-
ical consumption expenditure and the frequency of 
such events is higher in outpatient care as compared 
with inpatient care. In figure 2, the concentration of 
red (total OOP payment) and green (medicine OOP 
payment) spikes above the consumption expenditure 
on the right-hand side of the graph reflects that even 
among richer households total OOP and medicine OOP 
payments are significantly higher than total non-med-
ical consumption expenditure of households. Moreover, 
concentration of medicine OOP payments above house-
holds’ non-medical consumption expenditure is more 
prominent in case of outpatient compare to the inpa-
tient episodes.

DisCussiOn AnD COnClusiOn
Using standard methods of measuring catastrophe and 
impoverishment,17 18 this paper demonstrates the finan-
cial burden of households’ OOP payments on medi-
cines in India, spanning two decades from 1993–1994 to 
2011–2012. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt to 
link medicines’ OOP spending to key diseases conditions. 
Two trends stand out clearly from our findings. First, the 
households’ impoverishment on account of OOP expen-
diture is rather high and continued to be so during the 
last two decades. The impoverishment burden is largely 
driven by households spending on medicines, which 
accounted for over three-fourth of all medical impover-
ishment in India. One of the reasons could be, compared 
with OOP payments on medicines, hospitalisation/bed 
charges in India are comparatively low, and often subsi-
dised in the public sector. Second, as far the catastrophe 
measurement is concerned, applying a 10% threshold 
of OOP payment on overall consumption expenditure, 
an estimated 18% of Indian households appear to suffer 
financial catastrophe. Medicines’ OOP expenditure alone 
contributed to an estimated 11% of financial catastrophe. 
In absolute numbers, this translates to a scenario where 
an estimated 46 million households appear to face cata-
strophic expenditure on account of OOP payments while 
29 million households faced such hardship because they 
had to pay for medicines from their pockets.
Recent evidence from the National Health Accounts 
for India points out that during 2013–2014, an esti-
mated INR1331 per capita was spent on medicines, 
while households alone contributed INR1200 per 
capita, accounting for 90% of all medicines expendi-
ture in the country.1 On the other hand, past evidence 
about government expenditure on medicines in 
India, underscores that, on an average government 
spent about 10% of health expenditure on medicines. 
However, the national average masks significant under-
spending on medicines by several state governments, 
with many reportedly spending less than 5% of their 
health budgets.6 Besides poor allocation of resources, 
except for a couple of Indian states, drug procurement 
and supply chain system is inefficient and ineffective 
leading to acute shortages of key essential medicines 
and chronic stock-outs in public health facilities.21–24 
This situation has resulted in physical unavailability of 
medicines. Drawing evidence from large sample surveys 
for the period from 1986–1987 to 2004, it is reported 
the physical barrier to access to key essential medicines 
worsened during this period.15 Supply of free drugs in 
government health system in the outpatient care setting 
declined sharply from about 18% in 1986–1987 to 5% 
in 2004. For the same period, drugs prescribed during 
hospitalisation for free also declined significantly from 
one-third to about 9%.6 As a result, it is pointed out 
the number of hospitalisation episodes in which an 
ailing population paid OOP payment, has risen dramat-
ically from about 41% to close to 72%.6 Further, it was 
observed that from the period spanning mid-1990s to 
2004, patients visiting government health facilities did 
not receive medicines in over one-fourth of outpatient 
episodes. Affordability of medicines is an important 
access indicator, because it translates into poor access 
or no access for people who have low purchasing 
power.3 The consumer behavioural theory also predicts 
that raising the price (via high OOP expenditure on 
medicines or high copayment) for a service in the 
public health sector will move more consumers into the 
private sector, depending on the elasticity of substitu-
tion and transaction costs in the public sector.25
In view of inadequate availability of medicines in 
government health facilities, households end up accessing 
private facilities where they end up incurring significant 
OOP payment, in the absence of any financial risk protec-
tion. Past evidence suggests that the trend has sharpened 
in the last couple of decades. For instance, the percentage 
of population accessing private facilities for inpatient 
and outpatient treatment has accelerated significantly 
between 1986–1987 and 2004. It may be observed that 
households accessing private hospital for inpatient care 
increased from around 40% to nearly 60% in rural India 
while urban India reported a rise from 40% to 68%.26 
During the same period, outpatient care visits in private 
facilities remained high at around 75% in 1986–1987 in 
rural India and 73% in urban India stepped up to 78% 
and 80%, respectively, for rural and urban India.3
The other critical evidence emerging from this paper 
focuses on disease-specific medicines expenditure. The 
results demonstrate a pattern where households’ medi-
cine spending is concentrated on low frequency, high-
value spending and high frequency, high-value spending. 
By disease-wise classification, expenditure on treatment 
of cancers, CVDs and injuries, both for outpatient and 
inpatient care dominate the spending pattern. Available 
literature confirms such an expenditure pattern, wherein 
the share of NCDs (CVD, diabetes, cancer, mental illness, 
injuries and others) in OOP health expenses has increased 
from 31.6% in 1995–1996 to 47.3% in 2004.12 The litera-
ture further indicates high odds of catastrophic hospital-
isation expenditures for certain NCDs. For example, the 
odds for catastrophic expenditure in cancer are nearly 
170% greater, for CVDs and injuries nearly 22% greater 
than the odds due to infectious diseases. Other studies 
on CVDs highlighted that CVD-affected households had 
more outpatient visits and inpatient stays, spent extra 
money per hospitalisation11 and have high probability of 
incurring catastrophic expenditure compared with those 
using inpatient facilities for communicable conditions.27 
Another Indian study on socioeconomic inequalities 
in financing of diabetes and CVD reported that OOP 
payments for hospital treatment claimed a large share of 
annual household expenditures; 30% for CVD and 17% 
for diabetes.28 In respect to injuries (both road traffic and 
non-road traffic), high incidence of catastrophic expen-
diture was 30%, and was significantly higher among those 
belonging to the lowest income quartile and with an inpa-
tient stay greater than 7 days.29

Although public facilities have slightly stepped up their 
share in outpatient care in recent years, private sectors 
continue to dominate both in outpatient and inpatient 
care in India.30 As an increasing share of households’ 
access private health facilities, private retail pharmacies 
have become a major source of supply of key essential 
medicines. While availability of medicines may per se is 
not a challenge in the private healthcare setting, afford-
ability appears to act as critical barrier.31 Thus, pricing of 
medicines and regulation around retail medicine prices 
becomes a key factor in improving affordability and 
thereby leading to a reduction in medicine-related OOP 
payment burden. Although India had a progressive retail 
price cap policies since 1979, but over the years a policy 
of deregulation was followed.32 In 2013, the government 
of India promulgated the Drugs Price Control Order 
(DPCO), 2013 (DPCO, 2013) which primarily brought 
all essential drugs, based on National List of Essential 
Medicines, 2011, under price control.33 An evaluation 
of new price regulation has highlighted that, while few 
of the medicines (37) had an increase in sales volume 
attributable to DPCO, majority of the medicines (52) had 
a negative impact on their sales volume due to DPCO. 
Overall, the DPCO may have had a negative impact in 
terms of sales volume of medicines under price control.34 
Given that the sales volume of price-capped medicines 
has declined, households OOP spending may continue to 
increase since over 80% of retail pharmacy market is not 
price capped.
In order to improve access to healthcare and to provide 
financial risk protection to households, the central govern-
ment and several state governments have been imple-
menting a publicly funded health insurance programmes 
since 2007, whose primary aim was to provide cashless 
treatment to economically vulnerable households for 
hospitalisation episodes. Emerging evidence from micro-
level as well as macro-level studies point to a trend where 
such insurance schemes appear to have improved access to 
hospital care but have been ineffective in preventing finan-
cial catastrophe and impoverishment to households.2 35 36 
These bodies of evidence are in line with our findings 
that hospitalisation-based treatment cost constitutes only 
one-third of India’s morbidity burden. Despite implemen-
tation of several health insurance schemes, a majority of 
Indian population continues to incur a relatively signifi-
cant medicines OOP payment while seeking outpatient 
care. It would be pertinent to highlight that the frequency 
of hospitalisation is considerably smaller than outpatient 
visits in general, especially for NCDs, which are chronic in 
nature that require multiple consultations and long-term 
or lifelong medication support. Such medical conditions 
result in catastrophic expenditure for households even in 
the absence of hospitalisation episodes. Moreover, since 
a relatively larger proportion of population seeks outpa-
tient care in private facilities, which is often multiple 
times expensive than public health facilities, we observe 
a disproportionately higher burden of medicine-related 
OOP payment for outpatient care.
The evidence presented in this paper, however, suffers 
from a few limitations. The first set of challenge relates to 
comorbidities and associated expenditure. In respect to 
inpatient cases, since NSSO data capture disease expen-
diture separately for various disease conditions, the issue 
of comorbid conditions did not play major role. However, 
for outpatient cases, we had to adopt apportioning 
technique to handle comorbid conditions. The second 
set of challenge pertains to the potential recall bias for 
disease-specific expenditures, which cannot be ruled out 
especially for hospitalisation treatment since the recall 
period is a longer time span of 365 days. Lastly, although 
there are significant state-level and rural–urban differen-
tials in the estimates presented in this paper, we focused 
on the all India average and believe that the state-level 
and rural–urban analyses could be a potential research 
for the future.
The foregoing underlines several policy interventions 
and programme design that were conceived and imple-
mented in the recent past to provide financial risk protec-
tion to households. However, gross underinvestment in 
the public health system in past had led to inadequate 
prepayment and risk pooling measures.26 Several policy 
interventions and programme redesign are required to 
reverse the trend of high OOP expenditure for healthcare 
in India. An efficient and reliable medicines supply chain 
model existed for over two and half decades in the state of 
Tamil Nadu which was replicated in the state of Rajasthan 
in 2012 and has been instrumental in improving access to 
medicines in the frontline facilities in these two states.37 
Such policies and programmes governing public health 
facilities are critical. The National Health Policy 2017 
also highlighted the need for providing free medicines 
in public health facilities by stepping up funding and 
improving drug procurement and supply chain mecha-
nisms.38 A recent pronouncement by the government 
intends to bring legislation for physicians to prescribe 
drugs only in generic names, also holds promise for 
reducing households’ OOP payments on medicines and 
ultimately providing financial risk protection. To sum 
up, both national and state governments’ intervention 
is required for providing free medicines in public health 
facilities along with expanding the mechanism of price 
capping of key essential medicines in the private market.
