CD24 expression on pro-B cells plays a role in B cell selection and development in the
bone marrow. We previously detected higher CD24 expression and frequency within
IgD+ naïve and memory B cells in patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) compared with age-matched healthy controls (HC). Here,
we investigated the relationship between CD24 expression and B cell maturation. In vitro
stimulation of isolated B cells in response to conventional agonists were used to follow
the dynamics of CD24 positivity during proliferation and differentiation (or maturation).
The relationship between CD24 expression to cycles of proliferation and metabolism
in purified B cells from HC was also investigated using phospho-flow (phosphorylation
of AMPK-pAMPK), 1proton nuclear magnetic resonance and Mitotracker Far-red
(Mitochondrial mass-MM). In vitro, in the absence of stimulation, there was an increased
percentage of CD24+ viable B cells in ME/CFS patients compared to HC (p < 0.05)
following 5 days culture. Following stimulation with B cell agonists, percentage of
CD24+B cells in both naïve and memory B cell populations decreased. P < 0.01).
There was a negative relationship between percentage of CD24+B cells with MM (R2
= 0.76; p < 0.01), which was subsequently lost over sequential cycles of proliferation.
There was a significant correlation between CD24 expression on B cells and the usage
of glucose and secretion of lactate in vitro. Short term ligation of the B cell receptor
with anti-IgM antibody significantly reduced the viability of CD24+ memory B cells
compared to those cross-linked by anti-IgD or anti-IgG antibody. A clear difference
was found between naïve and memory B cells with respect to CD24 expression and
pAMPK, most notably a strong positive association in IgD+IgM+ memory B cells. In
vitro findings confirmed dysregulation of CD24-expressing B cells from ME/CFS patients
previously suggested by immunophenotype studies of B cells from peripheral blood.

CD24+B Cells in ME/CFS
CD24-negative B cells underwent productive proliferation whereas CD24+ B cells were
either unresponsive or susceptible to cell death upon BCR-engagement alone. We
suggest that CD24 expression may reflect variations in energy metabolism on different
B cell subsets.

INTRODUCTION
CD24 is one of the earliest expressed proteins during human
B cell maturation, being present at the late pro-B cell stages
alongside surface markers such as CD21 and cytoplasmic µ
heavy chains (1, 2). CD24 is a highly glycosylated protein
which is glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPA) but can
be localized to lipid rafts on the plasma membrane of B cells (3).
Its role was first described following the finding that cross-linking
CD24 on immature pro- and pre-B cells B cells could block B
cell development in a murine model by inducing apoptosis (4, 5).
The dynamic regulation of CD24 on immature bone marrow B
cells and its role in apoptosis has been confirmed in in vitro cell
cultures of mouse and human cell lines and was thus suggested
to be involved in determining the fate of B lymphoid progenitor
cells (6–8). The selection process that results in apoptosis of many
autoreactive B cells in the bone marrow is complex but involves
both the specificity of the B cell receptor (BCR) and other
signaling molecules, including CD24 (1, 9, 10). For example,
transgenic mice overexpressing CD24 exhibit a loss of late pre-
and immature B cells due to increased apoptosis (11). Cross-
linking or engagement of CD24 may regulate BCR-mediated B
cell selection in the bone marrow, consequently, the generation
and emigration of transitional B cells to the periphery.
In the peripheral lymphoid system of humans, CD24
expression undergoes continuous fluctuations in expression
throughout the lifespan of mature B cells until CD24 is lost
when B cells differentiate into antibody-producing cells (12–
14). Although the functional consequences of the changes in
CD24 expression on mature naïve and memory B cells have been
poorly studied in the human, Sanz and colleagues have described
high expression patterns of CD24 in the majority of CD27+ B
cells while the majority of CD27− B cells had low expression
in healthy subjects. Isotype analysis within the CD27+ and
CD27− B cell subsets revealed that IgM-only cells in both subsets
are a distinctive population of CD24+B220-(CD45R) cells. On
the contrary, IgG switched memory B cells were heterogeneous
in the expression of CD24 and B220 (15). While previous
studies focused on experiments crosslinking (or engaging) and
overexpression of CD24 molecules in murine models, the
functional consequences of the changes in CD24 expression on
mature peripheral blood-derived naïve and memory B cells has
been poorly studied in human health and disease.
We recently described significantly increased frequency
and expression of CD24 on subsets of IgD+IgM+ B cells
from patients suffering from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) (16), a multisystem disorder
characterized by fatigue, post-exertional malaise and cognitive
impairment (17, 18). Although CD24 plays a well-described role
in early B cell development in the bone marrow in mice and man,
our novel finding of increased CD24 on B cells as a potential
biomarker for ME/CFS patients prompted the investigation of its
possible function throughout B cell maturation in the periphery.
Here we investigated the in vitro behavior of CD24 following B
cell-directed stimulation. We describe a potential role for CD24
in the generation and maintenance of B cell fate in IgM+ memory
B cells likely mediated through a metabolic pathway involving
phosphorylation of AMPK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Healthy Controls
Patients diagnosed with ME/CFS fulfilling the revised Canadian
Consensus Criteria (CCC 2010; incorporating Canadian, CDC
and Fukuda criteria) were selected for the study at 2 ME/CFS
referral centers, namely the Royal London Hospital of Integrated
Medicine, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust (under the care of Dr.
S. Berkovitz) and St. Helier Hospital NHS Trust (under the care
of Dr. A. Bansal). Nine ME/CFS patients (6F, 3M; median age 33;
range 22-52) and 8 healthy controls (HC) (5F, 3M; median age
33; range 23–63) were included. Length of history ranged from
4 to 21 years. All were Caucasian, time of blood taking, where
0 is no symptoms and 10 most severe) were 7.3 for fatigue, 4.3
for cognitive impairment and 4 for pain. Subjects were sourced
from the same cohort of patients and controls described in detail
previously (16). Informed consent was obtained and medical
history (disease duration, the severity of symptoms and co-
morbidities) was recorded for the purpose of the study. Patients
with a confirmed history of autoimmune disease or receiving
immunosuppression were excluded, as well as those who had
a history of depression (HADS >17). Exclusion criteria for
the control group was if a first or second degree relative of a
ME/CFS patient. Healthy controls were recruited from hospital
and academic staff and volunteers amongst friends of patients
without evidence of ME/CFS on the basis of completed symptom
questionnaires. This study has been approved by the NRES
Committee London-City Road & Hampstead Research Ethics
Committee (REC reference: 14/LO/0388).
Cell Cultures and Stimulations
Whole blood from ME/CFS patients and healthy controls were
used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
by centrifugation over Lymphoprep (StemcellTM Technologies,
Vancouver BC). B cells were enriched by negative selection
using the EasySepTM Human B cell isolation kit (StemcellTM
Technologies, Vancouver BC). B cells were then stained with

the fluorescent dye Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE;
Biolegend, San Diego CA) to follow proliferation. PBMCs or
CFSE stained B cells (5 × 104 per well in 96 well flat bottom
plates) were cultured in the presence of T-dependent (TD)—
anti-CD40 (LEAFTM Purified anti-human, Biolegend San Diego
CA) anti-IgM [AffiniPure F(ab’)2 Fragment Goat Anti-Human
IgM, Fc5µ fragment specific, West Grove PA] and IL2 (Human,
PeproTech EC Ltd, Rocky Hill NJ), or additional stimulation
through Toll-like receptor 9 with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides
(ODN 2006, Invivogen, San Diego CA) + anti-IgM and IL2) or
with B cell activating factor (BAFF; R&D systems, Minneapolis
MN), a B cell survival cytokine (19). After 5 days of culture in
RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Labtech International, Heathfield
UK), B cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis and
supernatants from cultures were collected and analyzed for
immunoglobulins and sCD23 production.
Flow Cytometry
PBMCs or B cells were stained for 20 min with fluorescent
conjugates of CD19-Alexa Fluor 700, CD38-PerCP.Cy5.5, CD39-
FITC and CD73-PE (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) IgD-BV421,
IgM-BV605 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) CD27−APC and
CD24-APC eFluor780 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and a
viability marker (LIVE/DEADTM Fixable aqua dead cell stain,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were washed
(centrifuged for 5 min 300× g at room temperature) and
resuspended in PBS and acquired within 24 h on a BD LSR
FortessaTMX-20. Compensation beads (BD, Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) were used to optimize fluorescence compensation
settings for multicolour flow cytometric analysis. A minimum
of 100,000 events in the lymphocyte gate was collected. Naïve
and Memory B cell subsets were defined as in our previous
publication (16) based on the classification described in Ref
(20). Representative plots of the classical B-cell subsets defined
by IgD/CD27 and IgD/CD38 using this system are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1.
Staining of Mitochondrial Mass in B Cells
With MitotrackerTM Red FM
Freshly isolated PBMCs or cultured B cells were incubated
with 22 nM MitotrackerTM Red FM (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) in preheated (37◦C) RPMI medium 1,640
without serum for 30 min at 37◦C. Cells were then washed (5 min
300× g at RT) with RPMI, the pellet resuspended in PBS and
stained for 20 min with CD19-Alexa Fluor 700, CD27−APC,
CD24-APC eFluor780 and IgD-BV421 as indicated above.
Relationship Between B Cell Membrane
Molecules and Glycolysis During in vitro
Stimulation: 1Proton Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (1H NMR)
Briefly, 5 × 105 B cells/well from 6 Healthy donors were cultured
in the presence of BAFF, anti-CD40 + (anti-IgM+IL2) and CpG
+ (anti-IgM+IL2) stimulation (as above) in 1.5 ml complete
medium for up to 6 days in 24 wells culture plates with transwell
inserts (Corning, New York, NY). 500 uL of culture supernatants
were sampled at days 1 and 3 of which 200 uL was combined
with 200 uL of ice-cold methanol-d4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis
MO), allowed to rest for 3 min, then 200 µL ice-cold deuterated
chloroform-d (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO) was added and
mixed by vortexing. Samples were then centrifuged (13,000 rpm)
at 4◦C for 5 min to produce a biphasic mixture with a hydrophilic
phase of water/deuterated methanol and lipophilic phase of
deuterated chloroform. A 300 µL sample of the top hydrophilic
layer was added to 300 uL of 200 mM sodium phosphate in D2O
(pH 7) containing 2 mM DSS and 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide.
550 µL of supernatant was transferred to a 7-inch 5-mm 507-
grade NMR tube and run on 700 MHz (Bruker Avance Neo
700) for NMR analysis. Metabolites in samples from cultures
were analyzed as previously described by one of us (21). Flow
cytometry was used to measure percentages of live B cells and
changes in B cell phenotype markers (CD19, CD27, IgD, IgM,
and CD24) and additional surface markers involved in energy
pathways namely CD73, CD39, and CD38 at the same time
points.
Detection of Phosphorylated Adenosine
Monophosphate Kinase (pAMPK) in B Cells
Purified B cells were stained for 20 min with CD19-Alexa Fluor
700, CD27−APC and CD24-APC eFluor780 as indicated above.
Stained cells were then fixed with Cytofix fixation buffer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 10 min at 37◦C, followed by a
wash step (4 min 1,800 rpm at 4◦C) cells were permeabilized
with Phosphoflow Perm buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) for 30 min at 4◦C. After washing, cells were stained
with Phospho-AMPK Alpha rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts) for 30 min at
RT. Cells were then washed and stained with a fluorochrome-
conjugated secondary antibody, Goat anti-Rabbit FITC (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. After the final wash
step cells were fixed with 2% PFA and acquired on the flow
cytometer directly.
Measurement of Soluble Factors
Associated With B Cells Survival and
Differentiation
Commercial ELISA kit was used to measure serum soluble CD23
(sCD23) production (R & D systems Europe Ltd; Abingdon,
UK). Following B cell activation, surface expression of CD27
induces cleavage of CD23 and can for that reason be used as
a measurement of B cell turnover from naïve to memory B
cells (22, 23). Relative sCD23 levels were used to confirm the
differentiation of stimulated B cells from naïve to memory status.
Human IgM and IgG total ELISA Ready-SET-Go! R
� (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA) kits were used to measure antibody production
in culture supernatants.

RESULTS
CD24 Expression During B Cell Maturation
In healthy controls (HC) we have previously described an
increased frequency (%) of CD24 expressing un-switched-
memory B cells (IgD+CD38-) compared to that of naïve B
cells (IgD+CD38+), and that the percentage positive for CD24
subsequently decreased in post-germinal center (IgD-CD38+)
resting memory (IgD-CD38-) and plasmablasts (IgD-CD38++)
(16). In Figures 1A,B, the distribution of CD24+ B cells within
total lymphocytes and CD19+ B cell populations are shown.
The majority of B cells expressed CD24; non-B cells (CD19-
cells) which were mainly T cells did not express CD24. As
shown in Figure 1C, CD24 expression in CD27+ B cells was
significantly higher than in CD27−B cells (p < 0.0001). We also
determined levels of CD24 expression (MFI) on B cell subsets
defined using the relative expression of IgD and CD38. CD24
expression of transitional B cells newly exited from the bone
marrow through to antibody-producing plasmablasts is shown
for CD19 gated B cells (Figure 1D) in HC. CD24 expression
was found to be highest on transitional B cells (IgD+CD38++),
declined in mature naïve B cells (p < 0.0001) with expression
significantly increased in all 3 memory B cell populations
(Unswitched memory, Post GC and Resting memory B cells
respectively) compared to naïve B cells (p < 0.0001 One-way
ANOVA). Plasmablasts showed the lowest expression of CD24
with a significant difference from naïve mature (p < 0.0001) and
memory B cell subsets (p < 0.0001). Expression of CD24 thus
changed significantly throughout B cell maturation.
The Effect of Stimulation on %CD24+ B
Cells in PBMCs From Healthy Controls and
ME/CFS Patients
The changes in %CD24+ B cells in PBMCs after in vitro
stimulation with either anti-CD40 + (anti-IgM+IL2) or CpG
+ (anti-IgM+IL2) induced stimulation was followed. CpG
stimulation utilized a synthetic oligonucleotide (CpG ODN-
2006) that binds Toll-Like receptor 9, whereas stimulation
with anti-CD40 antibody mimics T cell dependent (TD)
stimulation. Both culture conditions were combined with the T
cell proliferation cytokine IL2 and anti-IgM which cross-links the
B cell receptor, and thus predominantly targets naïve and IgM
memory B cells. PBMCs were also cultured in medium alone or
in the presence of the pro-survival B cell cytokine BAFF. After 5
days of culture, cells were harvested and stained with a viability
stain, along with CD19 and CD24 fluorescent-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies. Culture supernatants were retained for

measurements of sCD23. After 5 days, the frequency of CD24+
B cells (CD19+) in cultures incubated with different stimuli
was compared between HC and ME/CFS patients (Figure 2A).
Unstimulated and BAFF containing cultures maintained higher
frequencies (%) of CD24+ B cells after 5 days of culture. The
%CD24+ B cells steeply decreased after both anti-CD40 and
CpG stimulation. A significant increase in the %CD24+B cells
compared with HC was found in PBMCs from ME/CFS patients
(p < 0.05) in unstimulated cultures. Following B cell activation,
surface expression of CD27 is associated with cleavage of CD23
from the B cell. As shown in Figure 2B, a decrease in CD24
expression after stimulation was associated with an increase of
sCD23 in culture supernatants, while unstimulated and PBMCs
cultured with BAFF did not release CD23, confirming lack of
in vitro differentiation. Post-germinal center and other memory
B cells are negative for CD23 and the relative level of the
soluble factor (sCD23) cleaved from the B cell surface during
differentiation to memory status has been used by us and others
as a surrogate measure of B cell activation/differentiation from
the naïve (20, 22, 23). No differences were found between
ME/CFS patients and HC in sCD23 levels (data not shown).
IgM and IgG levels in the same culture supernatants are shown
in Figure 2C, confirming differentiation to Ig production by
naïve and memory B cells in CpG stimulated cultures, but
not those stimulated under TD (anti-CD40) conditions. It has
previously been shown that TD stimulation through CD40L
induced proliferation of both naïve and memory B cells, but not
differentiation to plasma cells, whereas CpG induced memory
B cell differentiation resulted in immunoglobulin production
following proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells (24).
Frequency of CD24+ Naïve and Memory B
Cells Over Sequential Proliferation Cycles
Following TI Stimulation
In order to investigate the effect of proliferation on %CD24+
B cells, negatively isolated B cells from freshly isolated PBMCs
were stained with CFSE and cultured for 5 days in the presence
of CpG + (anti-IgM+IL2) stimulation. CpG stimulation is
known to induce multiple proliferation cycles of human B
cells (25). We confirmed that stimulation with CpG induced
more proliferation cycles and significantly higher IgM and IgG
antibody production over 5 days compared to anti-CD40 (TD)
stimulation (Supplementary Figure 2) and therefore results for

CpG stimulation are shown. After culture B cells were stained
with a viability stain and fluorescent conjugates against CD19,
CD27, and CD24. Figure 3A shows a representative plot of
sequential cycles during B cell proliferation of healthy controls
after a 5-day culture with CpG stimulation. The frequency of
B cells (Figure 3B) and CD24+ B cells (Figure 3C) within
CD27− and CD27+ subsets are shown over each cycle. Both B
cell subsets proliferated in response to CpG stimulus, but the
percentage of CD24+ B cells decreased with each proliferation
cycle in both CD27− and CD27+ B cells. Although there was
a higher relative frequency of %CD24+ B cells in CD27+ vs.
CD27− B cells at baseline, the rate of decrease was similar
in both subsets. Anti-CD40 (TD) stimulated B cells showed
similar patterns as CpG stimulation, although with fewer
proliferation cycles reached within 5 days culture (data not
shown and Supplementary Figure 2). When the percentage of
CD24+CD27+ B cells within each cycle was analyzed in relation
to baseline parameters in healthy controls, there was a significant
positive correlation between age and %CD24+CD27+ B cells
in Cycle 0, which was lost over sequential proliferation cycles
(Figure 4).
Changes in Mitochondrial Mass Over
Sequential Proliferation Cycles Following
TI Stimulation in naïve and Memory B Cells
As energy demand changes during B cell differentiation, we
measured mitochondrial mass (MM) in relation to CD24
expression on B cell subsets and cultured B cells with
MitotrackerTM Red FM (MTR). MTR is a fluorescent dye which
stains mitochondria within live cells, where its accumulation is
dependent upon intact cell membrane potential. In Figure 5A
MM of B cells from freshly isolated PBMCs, defined by
IgD/CD27, are shown. Compared to naïve B cells (IgD+CD27−),
memory B cells showed increased MM, with class-switched
memory B cells (IgD-CD27+), pre-switched memory B cells
(IgD+CD27+), which predominantly secrete IgM and late
resting or double negative memory cells (26) (IgD-CD27−) also
showing a significant increase in MM.
MM was also measured over each proliferation cycle in
naïve and memory B cells from HC after 5 days of culture. As
shown in Figure 5B there was no difference in MM between
each proliferation cycle, although the higher MM of memory
B cells compared with naïve B cells was maintained over
sequential cycles. The correlation between %CD24+CD27+
memory B cells and MM over sequential proliferation cycles after
CpG stimulation in HC was also investigated within individual
proliferation cycles (Figure 6). CD24+CD27+ B cells in Cycle 0
(Figure 6A) had a strong negative correlation with mitochondrial
mass. Over subsequent cycles, this correlation was gradually lost
with proliferation and increased percentages of CD24- compared
with CD24+memory B cells (Figures 6B–E).
Phosphorylated AMPK and CD24 in Naïve
and Memory B Cells
Overexpression of CD24 has been described on a number of
human tumor cells, including acute myeloid leukemia (27–
29). Microarray analyses of prostate cancer cells suggested that
CD24 had a role as a growth-promoting factor, which was
downregulated when the enzyme adenosine monophosphate
kinase (AMPK) was inactivated (30). The kinase is activated
(phosphorylated -pAMPK) in response to stresses that deplete
cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia and exercise
positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish ATP,
including fatty acid oxidation, autophagy and mitochondrial
biogenesis. In normal human B cells, it has been reported that
only memory B cells, and especially late memory B cells (IgD-
CD27−), express senescence-associated secretory phenotypes
(SASP), which are associated with spontaneous activation of
AMPK (31). We therefore examined the potential relationship
between CD24 on B cells, separated on the basis of CD27
expression, and phosphorylation of AMPK, using Phospho-Flow.
In Figure 7A a representative plot of pAMPK expression on
CD27− and memory CD27+ B cells in comparison with a
negative control (pAMPK stain without secondary antibody)
are shown. The median expression (MFI) of pAMPK on
CD27−B cells were used as a cut-off for high pAMPK
expression (referred to as pAMPK-HIGH) in comparison with
memory B cells (Figures 7Bi, 7Ci). Approximately 20% of
naïve B cells showed a “pAMPK-HIGH” expression, which
was equally distributed between CD24- and CD24+ B cells
(Figure 7Bii). In CD27+ memory B cells pAMPK-HIGH
expression was shown to be at a much higher frequency
than in naïve B cells, particularly in the CD24+ population.
Thus, this indicated a clear-cut difference in AMPK signaling
in memory B cells compared to CD27−B cells, which was
significant for CD24+ compared with CD24- memory B cells
(Figure 7Cii).

Identity of pAMPK-HIGH Population With
CD24+CD27+ Memory B Cells
Additional surface markers were then included in order to
identify the B cell subpopulation associated with pAMPK-HIGH
CD24+CD27+ memory B cells more precisely. As shown in
Figure 7D, CD24+CD27+ memory B cells in the pAMPK-
HIGH group were predominantly within the IgD++IgM++
(MFI) population. The remainder of CD24+CD27+ memory
B cells which were not pAMPK-HIGH, were mostly IgD-IgM-
(switched memory B cell phenotype) although there was also a
significant population of IgD++IgM++ B cells. The memory
(CD27+) B cell subset co-expressing IgD and IgM represent
a marginal zone or pre-switch memory B cell phenotype
(IgD+CD38-).

We
had

shown
a
tentative
association
between
CD24 expression and energy metabolism in the form of
phosphorylation of AMPK. We extended our analysis to cultured
B cells to explore the relationship between a direct measure of 2
key metabolites namely glucose (substrate) and lactate (product)
during in vitro stimulation of B cells as a proxy for glycolysis,
and B cell immunophenotype markers including CD24 and
those associated with ATP metabolism. Additional markers were
the Ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 and cyclic ADP Ribose
hydrolase (CD38) and CD27 (a differentiation marker expressed
on most Memory B cells) and the B cell receptor, IgM. Figure 8
(glucose) and Figure 9 (lactate) show fold changes in percentages
of CD24 (A), CD27 (B), CD39 (C), CD73 (D), CD38 (E), and
IgM (F) in relation to fold changes in proportion of glucose and
lactate between days 1 and 3. We found that the direction of
fold changes in both %glucose (negative) and %lactate (positive)
in culture supernatants correlated with %live CD24+ B cells
(p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) but not with those of
other phenotypic markers, except a weaker (positive) association
between CD73 and lactate production (p < 0.05).

outside the bone marrow has not been extensively explored
in man. We and others have earlier showed that CD24 has
a higher expression (MFI) in memory compared to mature
naïve B cells. We thus tested the effect of BCR stimulation
with anti-IgM, anti-IgD and anti-IgG antibodies (Goat anti-
human polyclonal antibodies) on B cell viability in CD27−
(naive) and CD27+ (memory) CD24+ B cells. Freshly isolated
B cells from healthy donors were cultured for 3 h at 37◦C in
the absence or presence of isotype-specific BCR cross-linking.
After incubation, B cells were harvested and stained for viability,
and with fluorescent conjugates against CD19, CD27, and CD24.
Figure 10 shows a representative plot of B cells divided on the
basis of CD24 expression in naïve (Figure 10A) and memory B
cells (Figure 10B). Within the CD24+ B cells, subpopulations
were identified in relation to decreasing viability. After cross
linking the BCR in both naïve and memory B cells, there was a
marked decrease in viable B cells cultured with anti-IgM. The
percentage of viable B cells was significantly less in both naïve
and memory B cells anti-IgM incubated cultures compared with
those incubated with anti-IgD or anti-IgG (data not shown; p <
0.05 for all comparisons). This may reflect the higher number (as
shown by MFI) of IgM receptors present on the surface of B cells,
compared to IgD and IgG. Nevertheless, following notably IgM
cross-linking CD24+ B cells were prominent in having reducing
viability.
DISCUSSION
Although CD24 plays a well-described role in early B cell
development in the bone marrow in mice and man, the role
of an increased frequency and expression of CD24 in human
memory B cells compared with mature naïve B cells has
not been thoroughly explored. Our novel finding of increased
CD24 expression and frequency within IgD+ memory B
cell populations, as well as IgD+ naïve B cells in ME/CFS
patients compared with healthy controls therefore prompted
the investigation of CD24 throughout B cell maturation.
CD24 is a cell adhesion molecule known to mediate signal
transduction including intracellular calcium mobilization and
phosphorylation of intracellular proteins (33–35). We found
that CD24 has a different role within naïve and memory B cell
populations related to AMPK phosphorylation, and which was
mainly confined to un-switched memory B cells with dual IgD
and IgM surface expression.
We used in vitro culture and stimulation of isolated B cells
to follow—CD24 positivity during differentiation. In the absence
of stimulation, an increased frequency of viable CD24+ B cells
was found in cultures from ME/CFS patients compared to
healthy controls. This in vitro finding was in line with what we
have reported in our previous ex vivo whole blood phenotype
study (16). Over sequential cycles of proliferation in response

to T-independent stimulation of B cells from healthy donors,
there was an incremental decrease in frequency of CD24+ B
cells in both naïve and memory B cells, as defined by CD27, in
parallel with naïve B cell differentiation. CD27 is a marker for
memory B cells, both unswitched (IgD+CD27+) and switched
(IgD-CD27+). However, a small population of memory B cells
which has lost CD27, has been identified and is thought to
represent a late or exhausted memory B cell sub-population
(26, 36). Interestingly, CD24 retention after stimulation in non-
proliferating (cycle 0) memory B cells was related to age in
healthy controls, suggesting that continued expression of CD24
might act as an unresponsiveness/senescence-associated marker
on memory B cells.
CD24 expression on human B cells has been largely utilized
as an immune-phenotype marker for early stage B cells where
it is highest on newly exited (from bone marrow) transitional
B cells. Expression then sharply decreases in mature naïve
B cells. We confirmed a differentiation-dependent expression
(MFI) of CD24 which was significantly higher in memory B
cells compared to mature naïve B cells. As a cell-adhesion
molecule, CD24 can ligate different specific signaling partners
on target cells in a B cell subset dependent manner. The ability
of CD24 to associate with other cell surface receptors such as
L-Selectin, L-1 cell adhesion molecules (L1CAM) and Siglec-G
also has consequences for downstream signaling‘ potential (37–
39). For example, its synergism with the BCR in normal human
B cells was demonstrated in relation to apoptosis (8). These
findings prompted us to investigate how BCR engagement
affects CD24+ B cell viability in naïve compared with memory
B cell subsets from peripheral blood. We tested this by
short-term cultures with isotype specific BCR engagement. A
decrease in viability of CD24+ B cells was found to be most
marked following ligation with anti-IgM compared with anti-
IgD or anti-IgG in both naïve and memory B cell populations,
suggesting a possible preferential co-localization with IgM-class
BCR.
Signaling pathways triggered following antigen and co-
stimulus encounter in B cells regulate cell cycle entry, effector
function and also the type of metabolic pathways used for energy
production. Naïve B cells, post-GC memory B cells and plasma
cells have different metabolic
Requirements and it is also likely that their responses to
metabolic stress may differ at different stages of differentiation.
Naïve B cells for example, depend largely on oxidative
phosphorylation associated with metabolites of the TCA cycle
rather than those of glycolysis, whereas post germinal center B
cells, as we confirmed in human peripheral blood memory B cells,
have both increased glucose consumption and mitochondrial
mass (40). In activated B cells (and germinal center reactions)
it is thus a balance between allowing rapid proliferation and
differentiation whilst managing the generation of damaging
reactive oxygen species, and, in vivo, perhaps limitations of

nutrient provision. We showed a clear difference between naïve
and memory B cells with respect to CD24 and energy metabolism,
namely phosphorylation of AMPK in CD24+ and not CD24
negative memory B cells from peripheral blood. There was no
such association with phosphorylation of AMPK and CD24
in naïve B cells. It is possible that the use of pro-catabolic
pathways of energy production (such as AMPK) in response
to cell stress may be necessary to aid cell survival at this
stage, with a resultant downstream triggering of autophagy
and other regulators of cellular metabolism to limit excessive
activation. CD24 could thus be involved in different downstream
metabolic actions associated with AMPK. Further phenotype
analysis showed that pAMPK-HIGH and CD24+ memory B
cells were present in the CD27+ subset expressing high IgD
and IgM surface markers. This confirmed earlier findings by
Sanz et al describing a link between CD24 and un-switched
memory B cells (15). Phosphorylation of AMPK has also
been shown to be one of the signals throughout metabolic
pathways which is associated with senescence and low/absent
responsiveness in memory B cells (31). As senescent B cells
increase with age this may be reflected by the increased
retention of CD24 on memory B cells which failed to proliferate
following in vitro stimulation and which we also found to
have a positive correlation with age in healthy individuals.
Mitochondrial mass was also found to be lowest in CD24+
B cells remaining in cycle 0 after in vitro stimulation, which
may also indicate usage of a preferred energy source for these
possibly senescent B cells, and possibly in B cells from ME/CFS
patients with higher CD24 expression. There was also confirmed
by the finding of a strong negative correlation between CD24
positivity and surrogate measures of glycolysis (glucose/lactate
ratios).
Abnormalities in energy pathway usage has already been
described as an important feature in understanding the
pathophysiology and etiology in ME/CFS (21, 41). The metabolic
anomalies described in sera from patients with ME/CFS
have been proposed to be regulated by increased AMPK
phosphorylation (42). This would thus appear to be confirmed
by the finding of increased expression of CD24 on B cells from
ME/CFS patients and its relationship to AMPK and surrogate
measures of glycolysis, namely glucose consumption and lactate
production as observed in this study. Increased expression of
CD24 which we have described on IgD+ B cells in peripheral
blood of ME/CFS patients could thus reflect abnormalities
in maintaining appropriate ATP generation perhaps mediated
through inappropriate activation of AMPK.
CONCLUSION
Previous studies have focused on the engagement of CD24 early
in B cell development and when expressed in transformed cancer
cells, where it plays an important role as an adhesion molecule
regulating survival and allowing spread throughout tissues
and lymphatics respectively. We investigated the relationship
between CD24 expression and B cell differentiation. In memory

B cells, we found that CD24 seems to have another role as shown
by an association with phosphorylation of AMPK particularly
in B cells co-expressing high IgM and IgD surface markers, but
not in naïve or switched memory B cells. According to our in
vitro findings, it is more likely that CD24-negative B cells had
undergone productive proliferation, and that CD24+ B cells were
more prone to unresponsiveness or cell death upon stimulation
and/or BCR engagement alone. We therefore conclude that
CD24 expression on B cells is related to energy metabolism
throughout differentiation and that its role differs between B cell
subsets.
