IMPORTANCE Postmarket safety events of novel pharmaceuticals and biologics occur when
new safety risks are identified after initial regulatory approval of these therapeutics. These
safety events can change how novel therapeutics are used in clinical practice and inform
patient and clinician decision making.
OBJECTIVES To characterize the frequency of postmarket safety events among novel
therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to examine
whether any novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of FDA approval were
associated with increased risk.
DESIGN AND SETTING Cohort study of all novel therapeutics approved by the FDA between
January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, followed up through February 28, 2017.
EXPOSURES Novel therapeutic characteristics known at the time of FDA approval, including
drug class, therapeutic area, priority review, accelerated approval, orphan status,
near–regulatory deadline approval, and regulatory review time.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A composite of (1) withdrawals due to safety concerns,
(2) FDA issuance of incremental boxed warnings added in the postmarket period,
and (3) FDA issuance of safety communications.
RESULTS From 2001 through 2010, the FDA approved 222 novel therapeutics
(183 pharmaceuticals and 39 biologics). There were 123 new postmarket safety events
(3 withdrawals, 61 boxed warnings, and 59 safety communications) during a median
follow-up period of 11.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 8.7-13.8 years), affecting 71 (32.0%)
of the novel therapeutics. The median time from approval to first postmarket safety event
was 4.2 years (IQR, 2.5-6.0 years), and the proportion of novel therapeutics affected by
a postmarket safety event at 10 years was 30.8% (95% CI, 25.1%-37.5%). In multivariable
analysis, postmarket safety events were statistically significantly more frequent among
biologics (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.06-3.52; P = .03), therapeutics indicated
for the treatment of psychiatric disease (IRR = 3.78; 95% CI, 1.77-8.06; P < .001), those
receiving accelerated approval (IRR = 2.20; 95% CI, 1.15-4.21; P = .02), and those with
near–regulatory deadline approval (IRR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19-3.05; P = .008); events were
statistically significantly less frequent among those with regulatory review times less than
200 days (IRR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.87; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from
2001 through 2010, 32% were affected by a postmarket safety event. Biologics, psychiatric
therapeutics, and accelerated and near–regulatory deadline approval were statistically
significantly associated with higher rates of events, highlighting the need for continuous
monitoring of the safety of novel therapeutics throughout their life cycle.

T
he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is respon-
sible for ensuring that novel therapeutics are safe and
effective. When making approval decisions, the FDA
weighs the risks and benefits of novel therapeutics using data
gathered in premarket drug testing and clinical trials.1 The
majority of pivotal trials that form the basis for FDA approval
enroll fewer than 1000 patients with follow-up of 6 months
or less,2 which may make it challenging to identify uncom-
mon or long-term serious safety risks. These risks may only
become evident when novel therapeutics are used in much
larger patient populations and for longer durations in the
postmarket period.
Given the inherent limitations of premarket clinical
evaluation for drug safety, there may be opportunities to
enhance patient safety if factors associated with post-
market safety events could be identified at the time of
FDA approval. Additionally, monitoring efforts could focus
on at-risk drugs to facilitate earlier detection of safety prob-
lems and prevent patients from unnecessary harm. It has
been suggested that the deadlines for the FDA’
s regulatory
review process that were established by the Prescription
Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) may have implications for post-
market safety.3 One analysis of novel therapeutics approved
by the FDA between 1993 and 2004 found that therapeutics
approved in the 60 days prior to the statutory decision dead-
line, hereafter referred to as “near–regulatory deadline ap-
provals,” were associated with more frequent postmarket
safety events.4 Whether other regulatory factors may be
associated with postmarket safety events remains unknown,5
such as the use of special accelerated approval and priority
review pathways, which are intended to expedite clinical
evaluation and premarket regulatory review.
This analysis characterizes the frequency of postmarket
safety events among all novel therapeutics approved by
the FDA from 2001 through 2010 and assesses the associa-
tionsbetween7characteristics,whichdescribethenovelthera-
peutics and the regulatory approval process, and postmarket
safety events.
Methods
Sample Construction
We used the Drugs@FDA database to identify all novel thera-
peutics (ie, new pharmaceuticals and biologics) approved by
the FDA between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, ex-
cluding diagnostic agents, sunscreens, drug adjuvants, and
drugs that were not intended for use in the United States
(eFigure and eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Class and Therapeutic Areas
All therapeutics were classified as either pharmaceuticals
(ie, small molecules) or biologics by the FDA. The indica-
tions for which each therapeutic was initially approved for use
wereabstractedfromapprovalletterslinkedtotheDrugs@FDA
database and were classified into 1 of 8 therapeutic areas:
autoimmune, musculoskeletal, and dermatology; cancer and
hematology; cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlip-
idemia; genitourinary and renal; infectious disease; neurol-
ogy; psychiatry; and other.
Special Regulatory Pathways
Promising therapeutics may be eligible to receive priority re-
view status from the FDA, which requires that the agency com-
plete its initial regulatory review within 6 months instead of
the usual 10 months.6 Novel therapeutics approved through
the priority review pathway were identified using a field in the
Drugs@FDA database. Therapeutics that address a serious un-
met medical need may be eligible for accelerated approval
status,7 which allows the FDA to approve drugs on the basis
of clinical trials using surrogate markers of disease for trial
end points. Those therapeutics that received accelerated ap-
proval were identified by reviewing FDA approval letters
linked in the Drugs@FDA database. The Fast Track designa-
tion, which provides enhanced access to the FDA during the
development process, and the Breakthrough Therapy desig-
nation, which was not implemented until 2014, were not as-
sessed in this study.
Orphan Product Designation
Drug makers producing a therapeutic that treats a rare dis-
ease can seek orphan status from the FDA,8 which confers a
longer period of market exclusivity to offset the small size of
the patient population. The Orphan Drug Product designa-
tion database was used to determine whether novel thera-
peutics had received designation as orphan products for the
indication for which they were initially approved.9
Regulatory Review Times
Key dates in the regulatory review process were collected
from FDA approval letters. Review times were defined as the
number of days between the submission date and the date on
which the FDA made its regulatory decision (ie, approval or
complete response). The number of review cycles required to
secure approval was determined using FDA approval letters.
Total review time was defined as the sum of the durations of
all review cycles required for approval and was classified into
3 prespecified categories (<200, 200-399, and ≥400 days)
based on FDA review process timing and patterns (priority
Key Points
Question Are characteristics of novel therapeutics known at the
time of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
associated with postmarket safety events, including withdrawal,
boxed warnings, and safety communications?
Findings Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA
from 2001 through 2010, 71 (32.0%) were affected by a
postmarket safety event. Postmarket safety events were more
frequent among biologics, therapeutics indicated for the
treatment of psychiatric disease, those receiving accelerated
approval, and those with near–regulatory deadline approval.
Meaning Postmarket safety events are common after FDA
approval, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring of
the safety of novel therapeutics throughout their life cycle.

review, 180 days [<200 days]; average first cycle review dura-
tion, 300 days [200-399 days]; or multiple review cycles
[≥400 days]).10
Near–Regulatory Deadline Approvals
Novel therapeutics were classified according to which itera-
tion of PDUFA was in effect at the time their application
was submitted to the FDA for review (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Near–regulatory deadline approvals were identified
as those therapeutics approved within 60 days of the PDUFA
deadline based on the submission and goal review dates.4
Therapeutics approved at least 60 days before the deadline,
any time after the deadline, or after multiple review cycles
were not considered to represent near–regulatory dead-
line approvals.
Postmarket Safety Events
Clinicians are informed about postmarket safety events in a
variety of ways. Withdrawals occur when new safety infor-
mation profoundly changes the balance of risks and benefits
associated with a novel therapeutic, prompting the drug
maker or the FDA to withdraw the product from the market.
Boxed warnings, which highlight important safety risks at
the top of a drug’
s label, are issued by the FDA when a major,
often life-threatening safety risk is detected,11 yet the overall
risk-benefit profile favors continued market availability.
The FDA releases safety communications often accompanied
by labeling revisions12 to alert clinicians to pertinent but non-
life-threatening safety risks.
Our primary outcome measure was a composite of the
3 principal types of postmarket safety events: (1) withdrawals
due to safety concerns; (2) FDA issuance of incremental
boxed warnings (ie, those added by the FDA in the post-
market period, after approval); and (3) FDA issuance of safety
communications.
To identify safety-related withdrawals, a publicly avail-
able index of the FDA’
s postmarket announcements was
searched for all novel therapeutics using both the generic and
brand names.13 When an announcement describing the with-
drawal of a therapeutic was found, 2 reviewers (N.S.D. and
J.S.R.) independently classified whether or not each with-
drawal was safety related (when safety information that
became apparent in the postmarket period made a signifi-
cant contribution to the withdrawal) or other. There were no
disagreements.
Incremental boxed warnings were identified by compar-
ing the most recent version of the label of each therapeutic vs
the initial approval label (eBox 1 in the Supplement). Safety
communicationswereidentifiedbysearchingtheindexofpost-
market announcements (eBox 2 in the Supplement).13 Prior to
2010, the FDA used Information for Healthcare Professional
Sheets, Public Health Advisories, and News Releases to com-
municate safety risks to clinicians; the agency also issued
Early Communications when new but unsubstantiated safety
information became available in the postmarket period. In
2010, the FDA adopted the Drug Safety Communication as its
single means of communicating postmarket safety events to
clinicians. To determine whether a safety communication oc-
curred, all Drug Safety Communications, Information for
Healthcare Professional Sheets, Public Health Advisories, and
News Releases identified by our search of the FDA’
s index of
postmarket announcements were reviewed. Only those dis-
cussing a safety risk that emerged in the postmarket period
were counted; communications notifying clinicians of the ini-
tiation of a safety review, updates to ongoing safety reviews,
and non-safety-related labeling changes were not counted.
Safety communications that were issued contemporane-
ously with a more serious postmarket safety event, namely a
boxed warning or safety-related withdrawal, were excluded to
avoid double counting (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Addi-
tionally, therapeutics accruing multiple postmarket safety
events were reviewed to ensure that each safety event was dis-
tinct (eTable 4 in the Supplement). We searched for postmar-
ket safety events through February 28, 2017.

Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize the novel thera-
peutics. We produced Kaplan-Meier estimates to plot occur-
rence of a postmarket safety event as a function of time and
report 2-sided log-rank tests to assess for differences in
events over time according to 7 prespecified features of char-
acteristics of novel therapeutics: (1) class (pharmaceutical,
biologic), (2) therapeutic area, (3) priority review, (4) acceler-
ated approval, (5) orphan product, (6) near–regulatory dead-
line approval, and (7) total review time (<200, 200-399, and
≥400 days). The proportion of novel therapeutics affected by
a postmarket safety event at 10 years was derived from the
Kaplan-Meier analysis, and we calculated the differences
within these proportions for 7 prespecified features, using
the Z test to determine statistical significance. Next, we per-
formed a multivariable regression analysis using a Poisson
model, and we report the resulting incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals; all characteristics of
novel therapeutics studied were included in the model given
the limited utility of bivariate analysis in variable selection.14
To address the possibility that the experience of novel thera-
peutics approved prior to our study period contributed to
postmarket safety events noted in our study, we performed a
sensitivity analysis focused on novel therapeutics with a
first-in-class approval in 2001 or later, a designation based on
prior FDA research.15 All statistical tests were 2-tailed and
used a P value of .05 as a threshold for significance. We used
Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP) and JMP version 11.2 (SAS
Institute Inc) statistical software to conduct all analyses.
Results
Characteristics of Novel Therapeutics
The study sample included 222 novel therapeutics approved
by the FDA from 2001 through 2010 (Table 1), 183 (82.4%) of
which were pharmaceuticals and 39 (17.6%) of which were
biologics. Therapeutics indicated for the treatment of cancer
and hematology were most common (47 [21.2%]), followed
by those for infectious disease (37 [16.7%]) and those for
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (26
[11.7%]). Special regulatory designations were common: 77
novel therapeutics (34.7%) received priority reviews and 28
(12.6%) received accelerated approval. Approximately one-
quarter of novel therapeutics (62 [27.9%]) were designated as
orphan products. The median total review time was 311 days
(interquartile range [IQR], 203-485 days). The total review
time was less than 200 days for 54 novel therapeutics
(24.3%), between 200 and 399 days for 90 (40.5%), 400 days
or longer for 76 (34.2%), and not available for 2 (0.9%).
Approximately one-quarter of therapeutics (52 [23.6%]) were
near–regulatory deadline approvals.
Postmarket Safety Events From 2001 Through 2015
Among all approved therapeutics, the median duration of
market availability was 11.7 years (IQR, 8.7-13.8 years). During
this period, there were 123 postmarket safety events, affect-
ing 71 (32.0%) of the 222 novel therapeutics (Figure 1). There
were 3 withdrawals. Valdecoxib, an anti-inflammatory, and te-
gaserod, a drug used for the treatment of irritable bowel syn-
drome, were withdrawn in 2005 and 2007, respectively, be-
cause of concerns about adverse cardiovascular events.
Efalizumab, a drug used to treat psoriasis, was withdrawn in
2009 because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoen-
cephalopathy, 1 month after a boxed warning citing this risk
was added to the drug label.
There were 61 incremental boxed warnings affecting 43
novel therapeutics, including classwide warnings for antipsy-
chotics (ziprasidone, aripiprazole) and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, atomoxetine) in 2005 and
2006, and monoclonal antibodies acting against tumor
necrosis factor α (adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab) in
2009. Eight boxed warnings were preceded by safety com-
munications; however, only 4 of these safety communica-
tions described the safety risk that triggered the subsequent
boxed warning.
There were 59 safety communications affecting 44 novel
therapeutics. Several of these safety communications affected

entire drug classes: warnings were issued about triptans (al-
motriptan, frovatriptan, eletriptan) in 2006, phosphodiester-
ase 5 inhibitors (vardenafil, tadalafil) in 2007, bisphospho-
nates (zolendronic acid, ibandronate) in 2008, and dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 inhibitors (saxagliptin, sitagliptin) in 2015.
Timing of Postmarket Safety Events
Among novel therapeutics experiencing a postmarket safety
event, the median time from approval to the first event was
4.2 years (IQR, 2.5-6.0 years) (Figure 2). For the 3 withdrawn
therapeutics, the time from approval to withdrawal was 3.4
years for valdecoxib, 4.7 years for tegaserod, and 5.4 years for
efalizumab. For therapeutics receiving an incremental boxed
warning, the median time from approval to boxed warning was
4.0years(IQR,2.6-5.5years).Fortherapeuticsreceivingasafety
communication, the median time from approval to the issu-
ance of the safety communication was 4.9 years (IQR, 2.4-7.2
years). At 10 years, 30.8% (95% CI, 25.1%-37.5%) of the thera-
peutics had 1 or more safety events.
Factors Associated With Postmarket Safety Events
In bivariate analyses (Figure 3 and Figure 4), there was a
statistically significant difference in the proportion of novel
therapeutics affected by postmarket safety events according
to therapeutic area (P = .007). Postmarket safety events were
most common for therapeutics indicated for the treatment of
psychiatric disease and least common for therapeutics for the
treatment of cancer and hematologic disease (proportion at 10
years, 60.0% vs 21.4%; absolute difference in proportions,
38.6%; 95% CI, 11.2%-66.1%; P = .006) (Table 2). There were
nostatisticallysignificantdifferencesintheproportionofpost-
market safety events for cancer and hematologic therapeu-
tics vs other therapeutic classes or for any of the other bivar-
iate comparisons.
In multivariable analysis, postmarket safety events were
more frequent among biologics compared with pharmaceuti-
cals (IRR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.06-3.52; P = .03) and among psy-
chiatric compared with cancer and hematologic therapeutics
(IRR = 3.78; 95% CI, 1.77-8.06; P < .001). Priority review
(IRR = 1.52; 95% CI, 0.87-2.65; P = .14) and orphan status
(IRR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.35-1.02; P = .06) were not associated
with postmarket safety events, although confidence inter-
vals were wide, while postmarket safety events were more fre-
quent among therapeutics receiving accelerated approval
(IRR = 2.20; 95% CI, 1.15-4.21; P = .02) and near–regulatory
deadline approval (IRR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19-3.05; P = .008).

When compared with therapeutics with regulatory review
times of 200 to 399 days, postmarket safety events were less
frequent for those with regulatory review times less than 200
days (IRR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.87; P = .02) and no differ-
ent for therapeutics approved at 400 days or later (IRR = 1.27;
95% CI, 0.81-1.99; P = .30).
Sensitivity Analysis
Among the 103 therapeutics with a first-in-class approval in
2001orlater,weidentified42postmarketsafetyevents(2with-
drawals, 20 boxed warnings, and 20 safety communications)
affecting 29 therapeutics (28.2%), compared with 42 of 119
therapeutics(35.3%)withafirst-in-classapprovalpriorto2001,
with no difference in the median time from market availabil-
ity to the first postmarket safety event (4.0 years [IQR, 2.5-
5.3years]vs4.2years[IQR,2.2-6.4years],respectively;P = .72).
In sensitivity analyses, postmarket safety events were statis-
tically significantly more frequent among neurologic thera-
peutics (difference in proportion affected by a postmarket
safetyeventat10years,44.4%;95%CI,−0.37%to89.1%)when
comparedwithcancerandhematologytherapeutics(IRR = 4.2;
95% CI, 1.1 to 16.2; P = .04), whereas near–regulatory dead-
line approval was no longer statistically significant (IRR = 2.0;
95% CI, 0.9 to 4.2; P = .08). All other results were qualita-
tively unchanged (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this analysis of 222 novel therapeutics approved by the
FDA from 2001 through 2010, 32% had a postmarket safety
event during a median 11.7 years (IQR, 8.7-13.8 years) after

approval. Although market withdrawals were rare (n = 3),
new boxed warnings, indicating that potentially life-
threatening or preventable safety events had been observed
in the postmarket period, and safety communications, which
describe serious but non-life-threatening postmarket safety
events, each occurred for approximately one-fifth of the
novel therapeutics (43 and 44 novel therapeutics, respec-
tively). In multivariable analysis, postmarket safety events
were significantly more frequent among biologics, therapeu-
tics indicated for the treatment of psychiatric disease, those
receiving accelerated approval, and those with near–
regulatory deadline approval. In contrast, postmarket safety
events were significantly less frequent among therapeutics
approved after the shortest periods of regulatory review.
These findings should be interpreted cautiously but can be
used to inform ongoing surveillance efforts.
To date, evidence about whether preapproval drug char-
acteristics are associated with or can predict postmarket
safety events is mixed. Our finding that near–regulatory
deadline approvals had higher rates of postmarket safety
events is consistent with an earlier study of drugs approved
between 1993 and 20044 (although the effect we observed
was smaller in magnitude) and with prior research demon-
strating that safety concerns are a frequent cause of delayed
approval.16 Our finding that therapeutics approved after the
shortest regulatory review times were associated with a
lower frequency of postmarket safety events conversely
raises the possibility that some approval packages provide
clearer evidence of safety, allowing for more rapid regulatory
approval. An analysis of regulatory review documents from
the European Medicines Agency indicated that safety risks
that would ultimately prompt a postmarket safety event were
not always evident in the premarket period,17 suggesting that
additional premarket review might only delay approval with-
out identifying therapeutics that pose a future safety con-
cern. Further research is needed to better understand the
dynamics between more rapid and near–regulatory deadline
approval and drug safety.
Collaboration between the FDA and other stakeholders is
necessary to develop and maintain an effective system for
detecting postmarket safety events, a suggestion echoed by
the US Government Accountability Office in its recent review
of FDA expedited regulatory pathways.5 The FDA’
s Sentinel
Initiative, which combines both administrative claims and
clinical data, is an important first step because the integra-
tion of multiple data sources that include observations
among large and diverse patient populations can facilitate
the detection of postmarket safety events. The sharing of
premarket clinical trial data may also bolster such efforts to
more promptly identify postmarket safety events by provid-
ing patient-level data to independent researchers for further
exploration and analysis.18 However, even with the most
careful regulatory review and sensitive postmarket surveil-
lance mechanisms, it may be impossible to detect other less
common events until several years after approval, once the
therapeutics are in broad use.19
Limitations
This study has limitations. We focused on withdrawals and
regulatory actions that the FDA has explicitly described as
part of its postmarket enforcement apparatus, but there
may be other signals of postmarket safety, such as labeling
changes and dosage form discontinuations, that we did not
assess. While the median length of follow-up in our analysis
exceeded a decade, postmarket safety events affecting these
novel therapeutics may yet occur. Because the study sample
was necessarily limited by the number of novel therapeutics
approved by the FDA, our analyses relied on limited sample
sizes and had wide confidence intervals, so there is residual
uncertainty even in our statistically significant findings.
Conclusions
Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from
2001 through 2010, 32% were affected by a postmarket
safety event. Biologics, psychiatric therapeutics, and acceler-
ated and near–regulatory deadline approval were statistically
significantly associated with higher rates of events. The high
frequency of postmarket safety events highlights the need
for continuous monitoring of the safety of novel therapeutics
throughout their life cycle.
