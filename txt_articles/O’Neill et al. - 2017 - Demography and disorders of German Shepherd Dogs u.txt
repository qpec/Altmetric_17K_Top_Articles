Abstract
Background: The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) has been widely used for a variety of working roles. However,
concerns for the health and welfare of the GSD have been widely aired and there is evidence that breed numbers are
now in decline in the UK. Accurate demographic and disorder data could assist with breeding and clinical prioritisation.
The VetCompassTM Programme collects clinical data on dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK. This study
included all VetCompassTM dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Demographic, mortality and clinical diagnosis data
on GSDs were extracted and reported.
Results: GSDs dropped from 3.5% of the annual birth cohort in 2005 to 2.2% in 2013. The median longevity of GSDs
was 10.3 years (IQR 8.0–12.1, range 0.2–17.0). The most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorder (16.3%)
and inability to stand (14.9%). The most prevalent disorders recorded were otitis externa (n = 131, 7.89, 95% CI: 6.64–9.29),
osteoarthritis (92, 5.54%, 95% CI: 4.49–6.75), diarrhoea (87, 5.24%, 95% CI: 4.22–6.42), overweight/obesity (86, 5.18%,
95% CI: 4.16–6.36) and aggression (79, 4.76%, 95% CI: 3.79–5.90).
Conclusions: This study identified that GSDs have been reducing in numbers in the UK in recent years. The most
frequent disorders in GSDs were otitis externa, osteoarthritis, diarrhoea, overweight/obesity and aggression, whilst the
most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorders and inability to stand. Aggression was more prevalent
in males than in females. These results may assist veterinarians to offer evidence-based advice at a breed level and help
to identify priorities for GSD health that can improve the breed’s health and welfare.

Plain English summary
The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is one of the most
popular dog breeds worldwide and has been widely used
for herding, guarding, police, military and guide-dog
roles. Over recent decades, breeding for characteristics
deemed desirable in the show-ring have changed the
physical shape of the GSD and there is now much de-
bate about the health of the breed. Annual KC registra-
tions for GSDs in the UK have dropped sharply over the
past decade. VetCompassTM collects veterinary clinical
data from first-opinion practices for research purposes.
This study aimed to use VetCompassTM data to describe
the demography, mortality and common disorders of
GSDs in the UK.
GSDs comprised 12,146 (2.7%) of the 455,557 dogs in
the VetCompassTM database. Females were more likely
to be neutered than males (51.6% versus 41.1%). The
average age of the GSDs was 4.7 years. The popularity of
GSDs dropped from 3.5% of all dogs born in 2005 to
2.2% in 2013. The average lifespan of GSDs overall was
10.3 years. The most common causes of death were joint
disorders (16.3%) and inability to stand (14.9%).
Overall, 63.43% of GSDs had at least one disorder
recorded during 2013. The most common disorders
recorded were ear infections (7.89%), arthritis/joint disease
(5.54%), diarrhoea (5.24%), overweight/obesity (5.18%) and
aggression (4.76%). Male dogs were more likely than
female dogs to have aggression (6.75% versus 2.78%).

 This is the largest study to date to explore GSDs using
first opinion veterinary clinical records and shows the
power of these records to help understand and improve
breed health in dogs. The demographic findings will be
of interest to government, breed and kennel clubs, and
commercial bodies to reliably understand the current
and future status of the GSD breed. The decline in
popularity of the GSD may reflect a general trend away
from ownership of larger breeds and towards smaller
breeds, but may also follow wide reporting of health
issues within the GSD breed.
These
results
may
assist
veterinarians
to
offer
evidence-based advice at a breed level and help to iden-
tify priorities for GSD health that can improve the
breed’s health and welfare.
Background
Since the creation of the German Shepherd Dog (GSD)
at the turn of the twentieth century, the breed has be-
come one of the most populous dog breeds internation-
ally and has been widely used for a variety of working
roles including herding, guarding, police, military and
guide-dog roles [1]. During this period, the phenotype of
the GSD has changed considerably. GSDs were initially
bred as medium-sized dogs to meet their original herd-
ing purpose and indeed GSDs are still classified within
the pastoral group by the UK Kennel Club (KC) [2].
Subsequent roles such as guarding and police work con-
tributed to selective breeding for larger and more
confident dogs [1, 3]. Over recent decades, further selec-
tion towards characteristics deemed desirable in the
show-ring have further altered the GSD conformation in
show dogs to emphasise features such as a sloping croup
that may be associated with altered physiological func-
tion [4]. Indeed, the KC Breed Information Centre states
that the evolution of the GSD breed and its changed ap-
pearance in the last fifty years has provoked fierce de-
bate, with the breed now showing a marked division of
breed “type” [2].
Despite historic popularity of the breed, evidence sug-
gests that GSD numbers are now in decline in the UK,
where annual KC registrations for GSDs have dropped
from 4.5% of all registrations (12,116 of 270,707 registra-
tions) in 2007 to 3.4% (7751 of 227,708 registrations) in
2016 [5]. However, KC data reflect the activity of just
the 30% of UK dogs that are estimated to be KC regis-
tered and there are scant data on GSD breed counts in
the wider general population [6]. In Australia, registra-
tions for GSDs with the Australian National Kennel
Council dropped from 6.6% of all registrations in 2000
to 5.0% in 2016 [7]. By contrast, the GSD appears to be
increasing in popularity in the US where the American
Kennel Club reports that the GSD rose from the fourth
most common registration in 2003 to the second most
common in 2013 [8]. These varying demographic trends
may in part reflect differing true and perceived health
issues in the GSD breed between different countries. As
the breed switched from a working to a pet role, this
may have led to reduced breeding selection focus on
functional health and work characteristics and instead
triggered greater concentration on show/cosmetic traits
with the added potential for increased propagation of
inherited disease [9, 10].
Concerns for the health welfare of the GSD have been
widely aired [11–13]. The KC Breed Watch system
categorises the GSD as Category Three breed “requiring
particular monitoring and additional support” and con-
sidered to be more susceptible to developing specific
health conditions associated with exaggerated conform-
ation [14]. Breed Watch points of concern include cow
hocks, excessive turn of stifle, nervous temperament,
sickle hock and weak hindquarters [15, 16]. The GSD
had the highest number of published predispositions to
inherited diseases overall among the fifty most com-
monly registered KC breeds and had the second-highest
number
of
disorders
exacerbated
by
conformation,
exceeded only by the Great Dane [9]. Individual disor-
ders with reported predisposition in the GSD include
hip dysplasia [17, 18], haemangiosarcoma [19], exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency [20, 21], degenerative myelop-
athy [17, 22, 23], anal furunculosis [24] and lumbosacral
disease [25, 26].
Predisposition implies a higher relative risk compared
with some other comparator. However, absolute and
comparative prevalence data relating to the wider popu-
lation within a specified geographical setting is required
for a fuller understanding of disorder prioritisation
within breeds [27]. Disorder information on Swedish
GSDs derived from insurance claim data on 32,486 dogs
reported the most common diagnoses claimed as pyo-
metra, itching and lameness [28]. Although extremely
useful, results from analyses of insurance data are none-
theless limited to the insured subset of the overall popu-
lation, only including disorders with a cost that exceed
the insurance excess and may be further constrained by
excluded conditions and non-lifelong policy cover [29].
Primary-care veterinary clinical data have recently seen
increased application as a secondary research resource
to report on breed health in dogs [30, 31]. Veterinary
clinical data benefit from inclusion of all dogs under
veterinary care and all disorders recorded regardless of
treatment cost, as well as the reliability derived from
their veterinary and contemporaneous diagnoses [32].
Periodontal disease, anal sac impaction and diarrhoea
were reported as the most common disorders in a small
subset of GSDs within a wider study that used primary-
care veterinary clinical data to identify disorder preva-
lence in dogs overall [33]. However, these results were
O’Neill et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2017) 4:7 
Page 2 of 12
 based on a small sample of just 132 GSDs and the veter-
inary clinical practices were limited to central and
south-eastern England.
Accurate and generalisable data on the types and fre-
quencies of common disorders in dog breeds are needed
to provide guidance for research, breeding and clinical
prioritisation [27, 34]. Awareness of the frequency of dis-
orders in the general population of dogs can assist to
focus research towards the most common conditions in
order to maximize the welfare gains while breeding pro-
grams can increasingly target selection decisions on dis-
orders that result in maximal welfare detriment [35, 36].
Using veterinary clinical data from the VetCompassTM
Programme [37], this study aimed to report on the dem-
ography and mortality of GSDs in the UK and to tier the
prevalence of the most common disorders recorded in
GSDs. It has previously been reported that male dogs
are more likely to be diagnosed with aggression than fe-
males [38]. This study hypothesised that the prevalence
of aggression is higher in male than in female GSDs.
Methods
The study population included all dogs under primary vet-
erinary care at clinics participating in the VetCompassTM
Programme during 2013. Dogs under veterinary care were
defined as those with either a) at least one electronic pa-
tient record (EPR) (VeNom diagnosis term, free-text clin-
ical note, treatment or bodyweight) recorded during 2013
or b) at least one EPR recorded both before and after
2013.
The
VetCompassTM
Programme
collates
de-
identified EPR data from primary-care veterinary practices
in the UK for epidemiological research [37]. Collaborating
practices can record summary diagnosis terms during epi-
sodes of care from an embedded VeNom Code list [39].
Data fields available for VetCompassTM researchers in-
clude species, breed, date of birth, sex, neuter status,
insurance status and bodyweight, and clinical informa-
tion from free-form text clinical notes and summary
diagnosis terms (VeNom codes), plus treatment and de-
activation status with relevant dates. Deactivation date
described the final date that the dog was under the care
of the practice. Reasons for deactivation include dogs
that had died or been rehomed, or where clients had
moved practice or had been actively de-registered (e.g.
because of bad-debting).
Dogs recorded as ‘German Shepherd Dog’ breed were
categorised as GSDs and all remaining dogs were cate-
gorised as non-GSD. A cohort study design was used to
estimate the one-year period prevalence of the most
commonly diagnosed disorders in GSDs during 2013
[40]. Sample size calculations estimated that 1023 GSDs
would need to be sampled to represent a disorder with a
3.0% expected prevalence to a precision of 1.0% at a 95%
confidence level from a population of 12,000 dogs [41].
Ethics approval was obtained from the RVC Ethics and
Welfare Committee (reference number 2016/U40).
All-age Bodyweight (kg) described all available body-
weight and date combinations regardless of age. Adult
Bodyweight (kg) described the maximum bodyweight re-
corded for dogs >18 months and was categorised into 5
groups (< 30 kg, 30.0–39.9 kg, 40.0–49.9 kg, ≥ 50.0 kg).
Neuter described the status of the dog (entire or
neutered) at the final EPR. Age described the age at the
final date under veterinary care during 2013 at the study
veterinary practice and was recorded at the earlier date
of either December 31st, 2013 or the deactivation date.
A random subset of all study GSDs were reviewed
manually in detail to extract the most definitive diagnos-
tic term recorded for each disorder that existed during
2013 and to manually link this to the most appropriate
VeNom term as previously described [33]. Elective (e.g.
neutering) or prophylactic (e.g. vaccination) clinical
events were not included. No distinction was made be-
tween pre-existing and incident disorder presentations.
In the absence of a formally recorded clinical diagnostic
term, disorders were included using the first presenting
sign listed (e.g. vomiting or vomiting and diarrhoea
would be extracted as vomiting) to ensure that disorders
described with multiple presenting signs were counted
as single disorders. Mortality data (recorded clinical
cause, date and method of death) were extracted on all
deaths at any date during the available EPR data.
The extracted diagnosis terms were mapped to two
precision hierarchies for analysis: fine-level precision
and grouped-level precision as previously described [33].
Briefly, fine-level precision terms retained the original
extracted terms at the maximal diagnostic precision re-
corded within the clinical notes (e.g. inflammatory
bowel disease would remain as inflammatory bowel
disease). Grouped-level precision terms mapped the
original diagnosis terms to a general level of diagnostic
precision (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease would map
to gastro-intestinal).
Following data checking for internal validity and clean-
ing in Excel (Microsoft Office Excel 2013, Microsoft
Corp.), analyses were conducted using Stata Version 13
(Stata Corporation). The sex, neuter status, age and adult
bodyweight for GSDs under veterinary care during 2013
were described. Annual proportional birth rates described
the relative proportion of GSDs from all dogs among the
2013 study population that were born in each year from
2000 to 2013. All-age bodyweight data with their associ-
ated dates were used to generate individual bodyweight
growth curves for male and female GSDs by plotting age-
specific bodyweights and were overlaid with a cross
medians line plot using the Stata mband command.
One-year (2013) period prevalence values with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) described the probability of
O’Neill et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2017) 4:7

 diagnosis for common disorders at least once during
2013 across all GSDs. The CI estimates were derived
from standard errors based on approximation to the
normal distribution for disorders with ten or more
events [42] or the Wilson approximation method for
disorders with fewer than ten events [43]. Prevalence
values were reported overall and also separately for
males and females. The chi-square test was used to com-
pare categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test
to compare continuous variables [42]. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at P < 0.013 after applying a Sidak correc-
tion factor for the multiple tests used in the study [44].
Results
Demography and mortality
The study population of 455,557 dogs in the VetCom-
passTM database under veterinary care at 430 clinics dis-
tributed widely across the UK during 2013 included
12,146 (2.7% of the total population) GSDs. Of GSDs with
information available, 6034 (49.8%) were female. Females
were more likely to be neutered than males (51.6% versus
41.1%, P < 0.001). The median age of the GSDs was
4.7 years (IQR 2.1–8.1, range 0.0–19.8) (Table 1). Body-
weight growth curves based on 24,301 bodyweight values
from 4030 females and 25,420 bodyweight values from
4052 males showed that GSD puppies grow rapidly during
their first year and that males plateau at a higher adult
bodyweight than females (Fig. 1). The median bodyweight
across all ages for males (36.0 kg, IQR: 28.3–41.6, range:
0.7–82.9) was higher than for females was (31.0 kg, IQR:
25.5–36.4, range: 0.4–64.3) (P < 0.001). The median adult
bodyweight of males (40.1 kg, interquartile range [IQR]
36.0–45.5, range 16.9–82.9) was higher than for females
(34.8 kg, IQR 30.6–39.5, range 15.0–74.0) (P < 0.001).
Data completeness varied across the variables assessed:
age 98.7%, sex 99.7%, neuter 81.5% and all-age bodyweight
88.1%. Annual proportional birth rates showed that GSDs
rose from 2.1% of the annual VetCompassTM birth cohort
in 2000 to peak at 3.5% in 2005 before decreasing to 2.2%
in 2013 (Fig. 2).
There were 272 GSD deaths recorded during the study.
The median longevity of GSDs overall was 10.3 years
(IQR 8.0–12.1, range 0.2–17.0). The median longevity of
females (11.1 years, IQR 9.1–12.5, range 0.6–15.9) was
longer than for males (9.7 years, IQR 7.5–11.7, range
0.2–17.0) (P = 0.001). Overall, 87.2% of deaths with infor-
mation available involved euthanasia with the remaining
12.8% of dogs having an unassisted ‘natural’ death. No
significant difference in the method of death (euthanasia
versus unassisted) was identified between the sexes
(P = 0.807). The median longevity of neutered animals
(10.2 years, IQR 8.3–12.3, range 1.7–17.0) was not statisti-
cally higher than for entire animals (9.8 years, IQR 7.6–
11.4, range 0.2–15.0) (P = 0.041). Fifty-one (18.8%) deaths
did not have a stated cause. Of the remaining 221 (81.2%)
deaths, the most common causes of death described at a
grouped-precision level were musculoskeletal disorder
(16.3%), inability to stand (14.9%), neoplasia (14.5%) and
spinal cord disorder (13.6%). No differences in probability
were identified between males and females for the 14 most
common causes of death (Table 2).
Disorder prevalence
The EPRs of a random sample of 1660 GSDs (13.67% of
all GSDs) were manually examined to extract all re-
corded disorder data. Of these, 1053 GSDs (63.43%) had
at least one disorder recorded during 2013 while the
remaining 36.57% had no disorder recorded. There was
no significant difference between males and females for
their probability to have at least one disorder recorded
(66.14% versus 60.87%, P = 0.026). The median count of
disorders per GSDs during 2013 was 1 disorder (IQR 0–2,
range 0–9).
Among the 1660 GSDs examined, there were 2028
unique
disorder
events
recorded
during
2013
that
encompassed 263 distinct fine-level disorder terms. The
most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded
were otitis externa (n = 131, 7.89%, 95% CI: 6.64–9.29),
osteoarthritis (92, 5.54%, 95% CI: 4.49–6.75), diarrhoea
(87, 5.24%, 95% CI: 4.22–6.42), overweight/obesity

 (86, 5.18%, 95% CI: 4.16–6.36) and aggression (79, 4.76%,
95% CI: 3.79–5.90). Males were more likely than females to
have aggression (6.75% versus 2.78%, P < 0.001)) (Table 3).
These fine-level disorders were grouped into 48 dis-
tinct grouped-level disorder terms. The most prevalent
grouped-level precision disorders were musculoskeletal

Discussion
This study presents the largest analysis of demography,
mortality and disorder prevalence in GSDs based exclu-
sively on primary-care veterinary clinical records re-
ported to date. Evidence is shown for a declining
popularity of GSDs over the past decade in the UK. The
most common causes of mortality are reported as deaths
due to underlying musculoskeletal disorders and inabil-
ity to stand. The most prevalent disorders identified
were otitis externa, osteoarthritis and diarrhoea. These
results highlight the power of primary-care veterinary
clinical records to help understand breed health in dogs
and to support evidence-based approaches towards im-
proved health and welfare in dogs.
Breed-based demography is of interest to govern-
ments, breed clubs and kennel clubs and also to com-
mercial bodies because it builds a picture of the current
status for each breed and also helps to predict future
population patterns for that breed [45]. To date, kennel
clubs around the world have been the mainstay of
demography data on the registered pedigree subset of
dogs [46]. Data on the wider population of dogs has been
sought previously from questionnaire studies, and micro-
chip and insurance databases [45, 47, 48]. Veterinary
clinical data collected from a large number of clinics now
offers a novel data resource to provide an additional and
unique demographic perspective on dogs [31]. Data from
kennel clubs around the world have shown a mixed
picture on the popularity of GSDs. The registered subset
of the breed is in decline in the UK [5] and Australia [7]
but appears to be gaining in popularity in the US [8]. Vet-
erinary data offer a view on the entire rather than just the
kennel club registered component of GSDs and the
current study indicates a sharp decline from 3.5% to 2.2%
in the annual birth proportion of GSDs between 2005 and
2013. The reducing popularity for GSDs reported in the
current study may partly reflect a general trend away from
ownership of larger breeds and towards smaller breeds,
with small and mid-sized brachycephalic breeds currently
being especially popular in the UK, and may also partially
result from wide reporting of health issues within the
GSD breed but it is also likely that many other factors are
in play in relation to this complex topic [6, 49]. Major
drivers for changing popularity trends across breeds are
poorly understood and may even be apparently paradox-
ical. A survey of owners in Denmark identified that the
relative weighting of purchase motivational factors such as
the dog’s distinctive appearance, welfare-related breed at-
tributes and health and behavioural problems differed
broadly among owners of differing breeds [50]. An owner
survey in the UK similarly identified that complex factors
influence breed selection and concluded that physical ap-
pearance was prioritised over health and longevity [51].
Despite wide reporting of health concerns for the GSD
[11], the current study reported that 36.57% of GSDs
under veterinary care had no disorders recorded during
2013. Given the current emphasis on enhancing disease
surveillance in the breed, especially among the showing
and breeding sectors of the GSD population [49], this

 finding presents an alternative perspective whereby not all
dogs are unwell and that gives some optimism for the
breed. It is also possible, though, that some of these
‘healthy’ individuals with no recorded disorders did have
some unrecorded health problems that were not perceived
as serious enough to warrant presentation for veterinary
care or were not obvious enough to be recognised by the
owner and/or veterinarian [52]. It is also possible that
some breed-typical abnormalities such as poor hindlimb
conformation or gait may be considered as normal for the
breed and therefore not warranted for inclusion in the vet-
erinary clinical records as a formal diagnosis [53].
The median longevity of GSDs in the current study
was 10.3 years. This is shorter than the median longevity
of 12.0 years that was reported for dogs of all breeds
using a similar methodology [54]. There is now a sub-
stantial body of evidence supporting a reduction in aver-
age longevity as breeds increase in average bodysize [46,
54–59]. This reduction in lifespan among larger dog
breeds has been attributed to a wide range of genetic dif-
ferences and pathological conditions induced by artificial
selection and accelerated growth [55, 60–63]. These
findings suggest that, despite health concerns for the
breed, GSDs are not particularly short-lived given their
large body-size, although high longevity is not always
synonymous with high welfare [35].
The two most common causes of death for GSDs in
the current study were musculoskeletal disorder (16.3%)
and inability to stand (14.9%). The true underlying
causes for inability to stand can only be speculated but
are likely to be multi-factorial and to include combina-
tions of musculoskeletal, neurological, neoplastic and
other diverse conditions. Taken holistically, this suggests
that musculoskeletal conditions are a major contributor
to mortality in GSDs and reinforces the relevance of re-
search and reforms that aim to better understand and

 control musculoskeletal conditions in the breed. It is
notable
that
musculoskeletal
disorders
are
often
degenerative and progressive conditions that do not ne-
cessarily lead to early death in affected individuals but
may substantially impact on animal welfare from their
prolonged durations of pain and/or incapacitation [27,
64].
Otitis externa, recorded in 7.87% of GSDs, was the
most prevalent fine-level disorder diagnosed in the
current study, while aural disorders of all subtypes af-
fected 11.14% of the study dogs and were the third most
common grouped disorder. However, this high frequency
of occurrence does not mean that GSDs are necessarily
over-represented for otitis externa. The high relevance
of otitis externa to the primary-care caseload overall has
previously been identified in several studies. Otitis
externa, with a prevalence of 10.2%, was the most com-
mon disorder in diagnosed dogs overall in England [33]
and was the third most common diagnosis in dogs in
the US where it was recorded in 13.0% of consultations
[65]. In England, otitis externa, was the fourth most
common disorder in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
(prevalence 9.2% [30]) and the third most commonly
diagnosed disorder in Pugs (prevalence 7.53% [31]). By
contrast, ear disorders were the eight most common
general cause reported as an insurance claim in GSDs in
Sweden, perhaps suggesting that clinical management of
many ear disorder events may not so expensive as to
warrant an insurance claim that goes above the financial
exclusion cut-off [28]. The underlying causes of OE are
varied and are often linked to allergic or atopic skin dis-
ease. Atopy has been reported as a common disorder in
GSDs [66] while atopic otitis externa or aural pruritus
has been reported in up to 86% of atopic cases [67]. The
current study chose to report skin disorders and otitis
externa as separate events for dogs even where both dis-
orders were present concurrently but it may be specu-
lated that some of these otitis externa cases were truly
part of an underlying diagnosed or undiagnosed atopic
disorder. Cutaneous disorders were the second most
prevalent grouped-level disorder (prevalence 13.98%) in
the current study and atopic dermatitis was specifically
diagnosed in 1.45% of the study dogs.
Osteoarthritis was the second most prevalent fine-
level disorder recorded in the current study, with a
prevalence of 5.54%. Locomotor disorders were also the
second most common general cause reported as an
insurance claim in GSDs in Sweden [28] and were re-
corded in 6.6% of dogs overall in England [33]. However,
much lower prevalence values for osteoarthritis have
been reported in breeds of small bodysize. Osteoarthritis
was the 19th most common disorder in Cavalier King
Charles Spaniels (prevalence of 2.6% [30]) and did not
even feature among 25 most common disorders of Pugs
[31]. The osteoarthritis cases in the current GSD study
covered musculoskeletal disorders presenting at any
body site with a recorded osteoarthritic pathology. It is
worth noting that hip dysplasia was included as a separ-
ate disorder because the presence of osteoarthritis is not
necessarily required for a hip dysplasia diagnosis [68].
As a large breed, the GSD may be predisposed to mus-
culoskeletal disorders because of either of their larger
bodysize, or their fast rate of growth [9, 69, 70]. Exagger-
ated
breed-related
conformations
such
as
selective
breeding towards lower hindquarters could also increase
the probability of osteoarthritic conditions further [71].

 Diarrhoea was the third most prevalent fine-level dis-
order (5.24%) and gastro-intestinal overall which was the
fourth
most
prevalent
grouped
disorder
(10.24%).
Gastro-intestinal disorders were the third most common
general cause reported as an insurance claim in GSDs in
Sweden [28] and were the most common grouped diag-
nosis recorded in dogs overall in England, with a preva-
lence of 17.8% [33]. GSDs have been reported as
predisposed to inflammatory bowel disease [72, 73] and
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [20]. The current study
did not aim to classify acute/chronic presentations or to
extract detailed data on diagnostic protocols so detailed
information on specific subsets of gastroenteric disor-
ders await a future more specific study.
Overweight/obesity was the fourth most prevalent fine-
level diagnosis in the current study (5.18%). However,
overweight/obesity did not feature among the 24 top gen-
eral causes for insurance claims in GSDs in Sweden, per-
haps because treatment usually focuses on dietary and
exercise management which are not generally covered by
insurance policies [28]. Across all breeds, overweight/
obesity is reported as the seventh most common disorder,
affecting 6.1% of dogs [33]. Obesity is now recognised as
an important medical disease in dogs [74] that can predis-
pose dogs to diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and urinary
incontinence [75]. It is worth noting that research based
on primary-care veterinary clinical data may under-report
the true levels of obesity/overweight although these data
will still be useful to explore associations with risk factors
within studies such as sex as well as also for comparative
interpretations across breeds between studies using the
same methodologies [30, 31].
Aggression was the fifth most prevalent fine-level dis-
order reported (4.76%). Undesirable behaviours were re-
corded in 2.6% of dogs overall in England [33] but were
the least frequent of the 24 top general causes for insur-
ance claims in GSDs in Sweden, perhaps because insur-
ance policies did not routinely cover this condition [28].
The GSD has also been identified as a predisposed breed
for bite risk to humans [76–78]. Aggression can be
highly contextual in dogs and is a complex topic to
understand [79]. Aggression directed towards humans is
the most common undesirable behaviour in dogs re-
ferred to specialist behavioural clinics [38, 80, 81] and is
a common cause for relinquishment of owned dogs [82,
83]. The psychological, physical and financial conse-
quences of bite injuries make human-directed aggression
an important public health and political concern [84].
Special care needs to be taken with large breeds such as
GSDs where bites are more likely to cause injuries that
require hospital treatment [85]. Aggression directed to-
wards other dogs is also commonly reported problem,
comprising 35% of aggression cases in Spain [38] and 7%
of cases of all behavioural referrals in Denmark [81].
Aggressive characteristics in dogs can be inherited inde-
pendently of other behavioural traits, suggesting oppor-
tunities
to
reduce
these
personality
suites
through
improved breeding selection and that the domestication of
the dog still is in progress [86, 87]. The current study
identified that male GSDs had more than twice the preva-
lence of aggression compared with female GSDs. This
finding offers an opportunity for veterinarians to provide
evidence-based advice on sex selection to prospective
GSD owners who were motivated towards pets with lower
probability of aggression.
This study did have some limitations. These clinical
records were not recorded primarily for clinical research
and therefore overlap may have occurred between vari-
ous disorder terms used [33]. Decision-making on the
presentation of dogs for veterinary care was under the
control of the individual owners and therefore some
dogs affected with a lower severity or visibility of disease
signs may not have been presented, resulting in an
under-estimation of the true disease burden [52]. The
quality and detail of the clinical note-taking may have
varied between veterinary surgeons and therefore af-
fected the disorder data that were extractable [88]. These
results relate to the GSD population of the UK but the
findings may be less generalisable to the GSDs outside
of the UK where alternative genetics, management,
healthcare and usage may differentially influence the
clinical picture seen. The counts of overall dogs rose
from the year 2000 to the year 2013 and therefore
greater uncertainly will surround results of annual pro-
portional birth rates for the earlier years than for the
later years. Lower counts of dogs that died precluded
the usefulness of reporting of causes of death at the fine
level of diagnostic precision. Although many of the
results reported in this study agree with prior beliefs and
assumptions about the health of GSDs, the limited prior
evidence that has supported these beliefs in the general
population of GSDs in the UK justifies the relevance and
importance of breed-based research such as the current
study and also provide a disorder benchmark against
which future studies can be compared [11].
Conclusions
This study identified that GSDs have been reducing in
numbers in the UK over the past eight years. The most
frequent disorders in GSDs were otitis externa, osteo-
arthritis, diarrhoea, overweight/obesity and aggression,
whilst the most common causes of death were muscu-
loskeletal disorders and inability to stand. Aggression
was more prevalent in males than in females. These re-
sults may assist veterinarians to offer evidence-based
advice at a breed level and help to identify priorities
for GSD health that can improve the breed’s health
and welfare.
