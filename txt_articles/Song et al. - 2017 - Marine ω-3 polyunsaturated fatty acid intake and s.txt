Abstract
Objective—Experimental evidence supports an antineoplastic activity of marine omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs; including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, 
and docosapentaenoic acid). However, the influence of ω-3 PUFAs on colorectal cancer (CRC) 
survival is unknown.

 Design—Within the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we 
prospectively studied CRC-specific and overall mortality in a cohort of 1,659 CRC patients 
according to intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs and its change after diagnosis.
Results—Higher intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC diagnosis was associated with lower 
risk of CRC-specific mortality (P for trend=0.03). Compared with patients who consumed less 
than 0.10 g/day of marine ω-3 PUFAs, those consuming at least 0.30 g/day had an adjusted hazard 
ratio for CRC-specific mortality of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 1.01). Patients who 
increased their marine ω-3 PUFA intake by at least 0.15 g/day after diagnosis had a hazard ratio of 
0.30 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.64, P for trend<0.001) for CRC deaths, compared with those who did not 
change or changed their intake by less than 0.02 g/day. No association was found between post-
diagnostic marine ω-3 PUFA intake and all-cause mortality (P for trend=0.47).
Conclusion—High marine ω-3 PUFA intake after CRC diagnosis is associated with lower risk 
of CRC-specific mortality. Increasing consumption of marine ω-3 PUFAs after diagnosis may 
confer additional benefits to patients with CRC.

INTRODUCTION
Despite appreciable advances in treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) still represents the third 
leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with about 49,700 individuals dying of 
the disease in 2015.[1] Substantial evidence indicates that dietary and lifestyle factors 
influence the likelihood of developing CRC,[2] but whether these risk factors impact 
survival of CRC remains largely unknown.[3] Understanding the role of modifiable 
indicators for prognosis is crucial to inform clinical practice and counseling to improve 
survival outcomes after cancer diagnosis.[4]
Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), namely eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), have been shown in 
laboratory studies to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis, possibly through modulation 
of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) activity, alteration of cell surface receptor 
function, and regulation of gene expression.[5] Supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs has been 
reported to enhance antitumor effects of chemotherapeutic agents in CRC.[6, 7] Substantial, 
albeit inconsistent, evidence also suggests that ω-3 PUFAs can inhibit cancer-related 
cachexia by improving food intake, delaying the onset of anorexia, and preventing body 
weight loss.[8, 9] Therefore, it is plausible that intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs could provide 
an opportunity to improve survival among CRC patients.
Despite these data, to our knowledge no study has yet examined the association between 
intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs and survival of CRC patients. Therefore, we used data from 
two large prospective cohorts, the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals 
Follow-up Study (HPFS), to assess whether high intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC 
diagnosis was associated with lower mortality.

 METHODS
Study population
Details about the NHS and HPFS have been described elsewhere.[10, 11] In brief, the NHS 
enrolled 121 700 US registered female nurses who were aged 30–55 years in 1976. The 
HPFS enrolled 51 529 US male health professionals who were aged 40–75 years in 1986. 
Similar follow-up procedures have been used in the two cohorts. Participants completed a 
mailed questionnaire inquiring about their medical history and lifestyle factors at baseline, 
and every two years thereafter. Dietary data were collected and updated using the food 
frequency questionnaires (FFQs) every four years. In the present analysis, we used 1984 for 
the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS as baseline, when we first collected detailed data on ω-3 
PUFA intake. The follow-up rates have been 95.4% in the NHS and 95.9% in the HPFS for 
each of the questionnaires though 2010. This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health.
Ascertainment of CRC cases
On each biennial follow-up questionnaire, participants were asked whether they had had a 
diagnosis of CRC during the previous 2 years. For participants who reported CRC diagnosis, 
we asked for their permission to acquire medical records and pathologic reports. Study 
physicians, blinded to exposure data, reviewed all medical records to confirm CRC diagnosis 
and to record the disease stage, histologic findings, and tumor location.[12] For 
nonresponders, we searched the National Death Index to identify deaths and to ascertain any 
CRC diagnosis that contributed to death or was a secondary diagnosis.[13] For CRC deaths, 
we requested permission from next-of-kin to review medical records. In this analysis, we 
included participants who were diagnosed with CRC throughout follow-up and completed 
the FFQ after diagnosis (N=994 in the NHS and 665 in the HPFS) (see the flow chart in 
Supplementary Figure 1).
Measurement of mortality
Most of the deaths were identified through family members or the postal system in response 
to the follow-up questionnaires. We also searched the names of persistent nonresponders in 
the National Death Index. The cause of death was assigned by study physicians blinded to 
exposure data. More than 96% of deaths have been identified using these methods.[13]
Assessment of marine ω-3 PUFA intake
Detailed description of ω-3 PUFA intake assessment has been reported previously,[14, 15] 
and provided in the Supplementary Material. In each FFQ, we asked participants how often, 
on average, they consumed each food of a standard portion size during the previous year. 
Nine response options were provided, ranging from “never or less than once per month” to 
“6 or more times per day”. We calculated the average daily intake for each nutrient by 
multiplying the reported frequency of consumption of each item by its nutrient content and 
then summing across from all foods. Use of fish oil supplement was also assessed and 
included in calculation of marine ω-3 PUFA intake, which was the sum of EPA, DHA and

 DPA consumption. We adjusted nutrient intake for total caloric intake using the nutrient 
residual method. FFQs have demonstrated good reproducibility and validity in assessing 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake,[16, 17] as described in the Supplementary Material.
Dietary intake reported on the first FFQ at least one year after diagnosis was used for post-
diagnostic intake to avoid assessment during the period of active treatment. Categories of 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake (g/day) were predefined as <0.10, 0.10 to 0.19, 0.20 to 0.29, and 
0.30 or more, consistent with prior analysis.[18] We also calculated the change of marine 
ω-3 PUFA intake by subtracting from the post-diagnostic intake the intake reported on the 
last FFQ before CRC diagnosis (pre-diagnosis intake).
Covariate assessments
We collected information on body height, weight, smoking status, and regular use of aspirin 
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) from each biennial questionnaire. We 
assessed mainly recreational or leisure-time physical activity using the validated 
questionnaire in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1992, and biennially thereafter in the NHS; and 
every two years in the HPFS. Physical activity was calculated by summing the products of 
time spent on a variety of activities with the average metabolic equivalent (MET) for that 
activity.[19]
Statistical analysis
We calculated person-time of follow-up from the return date of the FFQ that was used for 
post-diagnostic assessment to death, or the end of the study period (June 1, 2012 for the 
NHS, January 31, 2012 for the HPFS), whichever came first. In the main analysis, death 
from CRC was the primary end point, and deaths from other causes were censored. In 
secondary analyses, death from any cause was the end point.
We plotted the Kaplan-Meier curves and performed the log-rank tests across categories of 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to 
calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of death, adjusted for 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake prior to CRC diagnosis and other potential predictors for cancer 
survival (see Table 1 and footnote of Table 2). We tested proportional hazards assumption by 
including the interaction term between marine ω-3 PUFA intake and time into the model, 
and did not find statistical evidence for violation of this assumption. We also stratified by 
lifestyle and clinicopathological factors, and calculated the HR of mortality per 1-standarad 
deviation increment (0.2 g/day) of marine ω-3 PUFA intake using the median intake of each 
category as a continuous variable. Test of interaction was performed using a likelihood ratio 
test by comparing the model with product terms between stratified covariate and marine ω-3 
PUFAs to that without these terms. We used SAS 9.3 for all analyses (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC). All statistical tests were two-sided and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 RESULTS
Basic characteristics of participants at diagnosis
Among 1,659 eligible participants with CRC, we documented 561 deaths, of which 169 
were classified as CRC-specific deaths over a median of 10.4 years of follow-up. Other 
major causes of death included cardiovascular diseases (n=153) and other cancers than CRC 
(n=113). Participants with higher intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs were more likely to be 
physically active, to take multivitamins, to drink alcohol, and to consume more vitamin D 
and fiber, and were less likely to smoke (Table 1). Cancer subsite, differentiation, and stage 
did not differ across categories of marine ω-3 PUFA intake.
Marine ω-3 PUFA intake after diagnosis and survival
The median interval between CRC diagnosis and marine ω-3 PUFA assessment was 2.8 
years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 3.9 years). As shown in Figure 1, participants who 
consumed higher amounts of marine ω-3 PUFAs after diagnosis tended to have a lower risk 
of CRC-specific mortality (P for log-rank test=0.02). In contrast, all-cause mortality did not 
appear to differ by categories of marine ω-3 PUFA intake (P=0.72).
Table 2 shows the HR estimates of mortality according to post-diagnostic intake of marine 
ω-3 PUFAs. Higher intake was associated with a dose-dependent reduction of CRC-specific 
mortality, even after adjusting for pre-diagnostic consumption and other potential 
determinants of survival (P for trend=0.03). Compared to patients who consumed less than 
0.1 g/day, those who consumed at least 0.3 g/day of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC diagnosis 
had an HR for CRC-specific mortality of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.35–1.01). We did not find any 
statistically significant association with all-cause mortality (P for tend=0.47). We observed 
similar results between the NHS and HPFS cohorts (P for heterogeneity by cohort=0.23 for 
CRC-specific mortality and 0.30 for all-cause mortality; Supplementary Table 1).
When marine ω-3 PUFAs were assessed according to dietary sources, those derived from 
foods and supplements both showed an inverse association with CRC-specific mortality, 
although the statistical power was limited for the analysis of supplemental fish oil due to low 
prevalence of use (Supplementary Table 2). Participants who consumed marine ω-3 PUFAs 
of at least 0.3 g/day from foods had an HR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35–1.04) compared to those 
who consumed less than 0.10 g/day (P for trend=0.06). Fish oil users had an HR of 0.63 
(95% CI, 0.24–1.71) compared to non-users.
To test the possibility that exclusion of patients who did not complete post-diagnostic FFQs 
due to early death, severe illness or CRC recurrence may have biased our results, we 
restricted our analysis to the 1,293 participants who completed their FFQs within 4 years 
after diagnosis. The results were similar with a HR for CRC-specific mortality of 0.65 (95% 
CI, 0.35–1.19, P for tend=0.08) comparing the highest to the lowest categories of marine 
ω-3 PUFA intake. In addition, to minimize bias associated with occult recurrences or other 
undiagnosed major illnesses which could influence dietary intake, we excluded 69 patients 
who died within one year after their post-diagnostic dietary assessment. Although statistical 
power was somewhat diminished, participants in the highest category of intake had an HR of

 0.76 (95% CI, 0.41–1.40) for CRC-specific mortality compared to those with the lowest 
intake.
Marine ω-3 PUFA intake and survival within subgroups
In an exploratory analysis, we examined the influence of post-diagnostic marine ω-3 PUFA 
intake across strata of other predictors of cancer recurrence and mortality (Supplementary 
Figure 2). For CRC-specific mortality, we found a statistically significant interaction 
between marine ω-3 PUFAs and height (P=0.01), and the inverse association of marine ω-3 
PUFA intake with mortality was stronger among tall participants. For all-cause mortality, the 
association with marine ω-3 PUFA intake differed by height, BMI, and regular use of aspirin 
(P for interaction=0.003, 0.01, and 0.06, respectively). There appeared to be an inverse 
association among participants who were tall, had a BMI of <25 kg/m2, or did not regularly 
take aspirin, with adjusted HRs of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74–0.99), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79–1.02) and 
0.88 (95% CI, 0.76–1.03) per 0.2 g/day increment of marine ω-3 PUFA intake, respectively. 
However, given the limited sample size and multiple comparisons conducted, these results 
should be interpreted cautiously.
The association between marine ω-3 PUFA intake and mortality did not differ across tumor 
subsites, differentiation levels, and stages. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by 
excluding 56 patients with stage IV cancers. The results were essentially unchanged (data 
not shown).
Change in marine ω-3 PUFA intake and survival
The correlation between pre- and post-diagnostic intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs was modest 
(correlation coefficient, 0.50; P<0.001). We assessed whether changing marine ω-3 PUFA 
intake after diagnosis was associated with mortality (Table 3). Compared to participants who 
did not appreciably alter their intake (amount of change <0.02 g/day), those who increased 
intake by at least 0.15 g/day had an HR of 0.30 for CRC-specific mortality (95% CI, 0.14–
0.64), whereas those who decreased their intake by the same amount had an HR of 1.10 
(95% CI, 0.59–2.08) (P for trend<0.001). Similar pattern was found for all-cause mortality 
(P for trend=0.03), and the corresponding HRs were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.62–1.21) and 1.21 
(95% CI, 0.86–1.69), respectively.
DISCUSSION
Higher intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC diagnosis was associated with lower risk of 
CRC-specific mortality. CRC patients who increased their intake from their levels before 
diagnosis experienced a substantial reduction in CRC-specific mortality and a moderate 
reduction in all-cause mortality. Our findings provide novel evidence for the potential benefit 
of increasing marine ω-3 PUFA consumption among CRC patients.
Due to the high incidence rate as well as improved diagnosis and treatment, CRC represents 
the second most prevalent cancer in the US. More than 1.2 million Americans are living with 
a diagnosis of CRC, among whom 64.9% live more than 5 years and 58.3% live more than 
10 years.[20] Many of these cancer survivors are highly motivated to seek information about

 lifestyle changes to improve their prognosis. However, the evidence is limited for the 
influence of modifiable lifestyle factors on CRC survival.
Marine ω-3 PUFAs have demonstrated anti-CRC activity in animal and in vitro studies.[5] 
EPA and DHA treatment has been shown to reduce cellular proliferation and increase 
apoptosis of human CRC cells. A consistent 40–60% reduction in size of xenograft CRC 
tumor has been observed in rodents supplemented with ω-3 PUFAs compared with controls.
[21, 22] As an alternative substrate for PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2]), marine ω-3 
PUFAs may compete with arachidonic acid and reduce the production of pro-tumorigenic 
prostaglandin (PG) E2.[23, 24] Furthermore, incorporation of ω-3 PUFAs into cell 
phospholipid membranes changes the fluidity, structure and function of lipid rafts, resulting 
in altered downstream signaling by cell surface receptors, such as epidermal growth factor 
receptor.[25, 26] Moreover, ω-3 PUFAs are highly peroxidizable and increase levels of 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of cell growth. Although 
moderately increased levels of ROS damage DNA and promote mutagenesis in cells, recent 
evidence indicates that high ROS levels exert an oxidative stress that can restrain tumor 
progression and metastasis by causing cell senescence or death.[27, 28]
Several lines of evidence also support a beneficial effect of marine ω-3 PUFAs on cancer 
survival. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 60 patients, supplementation of marine 
ω-3 PUFAs restored the decreased ratio of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells and prolonged 
the survival of cancer patients.[29] Recently, a Phase II RCT showed that oral administration 
of EPA as the free fatty acid 2 g daily prior to surgery resulted in an increased content of 
EPA in tumor tissue, and reduced vascularity and mortality among patients with CRC cell 
liver metastasis.[30] Moreover, ω-3 PUFAs have been shown to potentiate the cytotoxicity 
of anti-neoplastic agents by overcoming multiple drug resistance and promoting an oxidative 
environment toxic to highly proliferative tumor cells.[31] In addition, ω-3 PUFAs have been 
suggested to have effects on mitigating cancer cachexia, partly due to its suppressive activity 
against inflammation and proteolysis, although current evidence remains inconsistent.[32] A 
recent cohort study reported that an increase in fish oil supplementation over 24 months after 
diagnosis was associated with improved physical functioning among stage II CRC patients.
[33]
Consistent with these data, we found that patients who consumed higher marine ω-3 PUFAs 
after diagnosis had substantially lower risk of death from CRC. Although post-diagnostic 
marine ω-3 PUFA intake was not associated with overall mortality, patients who increased 
their intake from the levels before diagnosis demonstrated a moderate reduction in all-cause 
mortality. Moreover, we noted a potential benefit of higher marine ω-3 PUFAs for overall 
mortality among individuals who were tall, had a BMI of <25 kg/m2, or did not regularly use 
aspirin, although the possibility for chance findings cannot be excluded. Fatty acid 
composition and concentration have been shown to regulate growth hormone secretion,[22] 
and genetic variations in ω-3 PUFA metabolism have been associated with body height and 
weight.[34] Previous studies have also reported that ω-3 PUFA may have a stronger anti-
CRC effect among individuals who do not regularly use aspirin,[35] an anti-inflammatory 
agent that shares antitumor pathways with ω-3 PUFA and has been proposed as a promising 
chemopreventive agent for CRC.[36, 37] Given these preliminary data, further studies are

 needed to investigate whether marine ω-3 PUFAs interact with metabolic factors and aspirin 
to influence CRC development and progression.
Strengths of the current study include the prospective design, detailed collection of pre- and 
post-diagnostic data, comprehensive medical record review of both CRC diagnosis and 
death, and long-term follow-up. Some limitations are worth noting. First, data on cancer 
recurrence were unavailable. Nevertheless, because the median survival for metastatic CRC 
was approximately 10 to 12 months during much of the period of this study,[38] CRC-
specific mortality should be a reasonable surrogate for cancer-specific outcomes. Second, 
treatment data are not collected in the cohorts. However, about 60% of patients had stage I 
or stage II disease, in which surgery alone would generally be the standard of care, and no 
interaction by disease stage was observed. Furthermore, although there are differences in the 
likelihood of use of adjuvant chemotherapy based on the factors such as socioeconomic 
status, the fairly homogenous nature of participants (health professionals) would likely 
increase the probability of at least standard therapy.[39, 40] Comorbidities and access to 
health care may also confound our findings; however, given the population studied, we 
would expect the latter to be diminished. Moreover, although comorbidities have may 
influence overall survival,[41, 42] such diseases are less likely to affect CRC-specific 
mortality,[43] the primary endpoint of this study. In addition, only a fraction of patients 
providing post-diagnosis data were included in this study. Therefore, both the statistical 
power and generalizability of our findings were limited. Further studies are needed in a 
larger population. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding from 
other dietary or lifestyle factors. However, our results are robust to adjustment for multiple 
major risk factors of mortality.
In conclusion, marine ω-3 PUFA intake after diagnosis may lower the risk of CRC-specific 
mortality. Increasing consumption of marine ω-3 PUFAs after diagnosis may confer 
additional benefits to patients with CRC.

 SUMMARY
What is already known about this subject?
•
Marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) have been 
associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
•
Marine ω-3 PUFAs suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis.
•
Supplementation of ω-3 PUFAs enhances antitumor effects of 
chemotherapeutic agents in CRC and inhibits cancer-related cachexia.
What are the new findings?
•
Higher intake of marine ω-3 PUFAs after CRC diagnosis was associated with 
lower risk of CRC-specific mortality.
•
Patients who increased their marine ω-3 PUFA intake after diagnosis had a 
lower risk of death from CRC, compared with those who did not change.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
•
Our findings provide the first line of population-based evidence for the benefit 
of marine ω-3 PUFAs on CRC survival.
•
If replicated by other studies, our results support the clinical recommendation 
of increasing marine ω-3 PUFAs among patients with CRC.

Cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific death (A) and all-cause death (B) 
according to post-diagnostic intake of marine ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. P value for 
the log-rank test across categories of marine ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake was 0.02 
for CRC-specific mortality and 0.72 for all-cause mortality.
