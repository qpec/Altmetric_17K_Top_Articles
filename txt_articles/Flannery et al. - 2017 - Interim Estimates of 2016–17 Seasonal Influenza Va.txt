In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal influ-
enza is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months (1). Each 
influenza season since 2004–05, CDC has estimated the effective-
ness of seasonal influenza vaccine to prevent influenza-associated, 
medically attended, acute respiratory illness (ARI). This report 
uses data, as of February 4, 2017, from 3,144 children and adults 
enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. 
Flu VE Network) during November 28, 2016–February 4, 2017, 
to estimate an interim adjusted effectiveness of seasonal influenza 
vaccine for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infec-
tion associated with medically attended ARI. During this period, 
overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for study site, age group, 
sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated general health, and days from illness 
onset to enrollment) against influenza A and influenza B virus 
infection associated with medically attended ARI was 48% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 37%–57%). Most influenza infections 
were caused by A (H3N2) viruses. VE was estimated to be 43% 
(CI = 29%–54%) against illness caused by influenza A (H3N2) 
virus and 73% (CI = 54%–84%) against influenza B virus. These 
interim VE estimates indicate that influenza vaccination reduced the 
risk for outpatient medical visits by almost half. Because influenza 
activity remains elevated (2), CDC and the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices recommend that annual influenza vac-
cination efforts continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating 
(1). Vaccination with 2016–17 influenza vaccines will reduce the 
number of infections with most currently circulating influenza 
viruses. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated 
this season should be vaccinated as soon as possible.
Methods used by the U.S. Flu VE Network have been pub-
lished previously (3). At five study sites, patients aged ≥6 months 
seeking outpatient medical care for an ARI with cough, within 
7 days of illness onset, were enrolled.* Study enrollment began 
after ≥1 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were identified 
* The U.S. Flu VE Network sites and the date enrollment began are as follows: 
Group Health Cooperative (Seattle, Washington) (November 28, 2016); 
Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (Marshfield, Wisconsin) (January 3, 
2017); University of Michigan School of Public Health (the School of Public 
Health partnered with the University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, 
and the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan) (January 3, 2017); 
University of Pittsburgh Schools of the Health Sciences (the Schools of the 
Health Sciences partnered with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) (December 5, 2016); and Baylor Scott and White 
Health, Texas A&M University Health Sciences Center College of Medicine 
(Temple, Texas) (December 13, 2016).
through local surveillance for ≥2 consecutive weeks. Patients 
were eligible for enrollment if they 1) were aged ≥6 months on 
September 1, 2016, and thus eligible for vaccination; 2) reported 
an ARI with cough and onset ≤7 days earlier; and 3) had not 
been treated with influenza antiviral medication (e.g., oseltami-
vir) during this illness. After obtaining informed consent from 
patients or parents/guardians for their children, participants or 
their proxies were interviewed to collect demographic data, gen-
eral and current health status, symptoms, and 2016–17 influenza 
vaccination status. Respiratory specimens were collected from 
each patient using nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, which were 
placed together in a single cryovial with viral transport medium. 
Only nasal swabs were collected for patients aged <2 years. 
Specimens were tested at U.S. Flu VE Network laboratories 
using CDC’s real-time reverse transcription – polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) protocol for detection and identification of 
influenza viruses. Participants (including children aged <9 years 
who require 2 vaccine doses during their first vaccination season) 
were considered vaccinated if they received ≥1 dose of any sea-
sonal influenza vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset, according 
to medical records and registries (at Wisconsin site), medical 
records and self-report (at Texas and Washington sites), or self-
report only (Michigan and Pennsylvania sites). VE was estimated 
as 100% x (1 - odds ratio).† Estimates were adjusted for study 
site, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated general health, and 
number of days from illness onset to enrollment using logistic 
regression. Interim VE estimates for the 2016–17 season were 
based on patients enrolled through February 4, 2017.
Among the 3,144 children and adults with ARI enrolled 
at the five study sites from November 28, 2016, through 
February 4, 2017, 744 (24%) tested positive for influenza virus 
by rRT-PCR; 656 (88%) of these viruses were influenza A, and 
90 (12%) were influenza B viruses (Table 1). Among 606 sub-
typed influenza A viruses, 595 (98%) were A (H3N2) viruses. 
The proportion of patients with influenza differed by study site, 
sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and interval from illness onset 
to enrollment (Table 1). The proportion vaccinated ranged 
† 100% x (1 - odds ratio [ratio of odds of being vaccinated among outpatients 
with influenza-positive test results to the odds of being vaccinated among 
outpatients with influenza-negative test results]).

from 46% to 61% across sites and differed by sex, age group, 
and interval from illness onset to enrollment.
The proportion of ARI patients vaccinated with 2016–17 
seasonal influenza vaccine was 45% among influenza patients 
compared with 55% among influenza-negative participants 
(Table 2). After adjusting for study site, age group, sex, race/
ethnicity, self-rated general health, and number of days from 
illness onset to enrollment, VE against medically attended 
ARI because of influenza was 48% (CI = 37%–57%). VE 
for all ages was 43% (CI = 29%–54%) against medically 
attended ARI because of A (H3N2) virus infection and 73% 
(CI = 54%–84%) against influenza B virus infection. VE point 
estimates against H3N2-related illness varied by age group; 
statistically significant protection was found against H3N2-
related illness among children aged 6 months through 8 years 
(VE = 53%; CI = 16%–74%) and adults aged 50–64 years 
(VE = 50%; CI = 23%–67%), whereas protection in other age 
groups did not reach statistical significance.

* Defined as having received ≥1 dose of influenza vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset. A total of 89 participants who received the vaccine ≤13 days before illness 
onset were excluded from the study sample.
† The chi-square statistic was used to assess differences between the numbers of persons with influenza-negative and influenza-positive test results, in the distribution 
of enrolled patient and illness characteristics, and in differences between groups in the percentage vaccinated.
§ Enrollees were categorized into one of four mutually exclusive racial/ethnic populations: white, black, other race, and Hispanic. Persons identified as Hispanic might 
have been of any race. Persons identified as white, black, or other race were non-Hispanic. Race/ethnicity data were missing for 19 enrollees.
¶ Two patients had coinfection with influenza A and influenza B, making the sum 746, or two greater than the total number of influenza positives.

As of February 10, 2017, a total of 13 influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses from U.S. Flu VE Network participants had been char-
acterized by CDC; 11 (85%) belonged to genetic group 3C.2a 
or the related group 3C.2a1, and all of those characterized 
antigenically were similar to the reference virus representing 
the 2016–17 A (H3N2) vaccine component.
Discussion
Interim influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates for the 
2016–17 season indicate that vaccination reduced the risk 
for influenza-associated medical visits by approximately half. 
Influenza activity is likely to continue for several more weeks in 
the United States, and vaccination efforts should continue as 
long as influenza viruses are circulating. Persons aged ≥6 months 
who have not yet received the 2016–17 influenza vaccine should 
be vaccinated as soon as possible.§ As of February 3, 2017, 
approximately 145 million doses of influenza vaccine had been 
distributed in the United States for the 2016–17 season.
Interim VE estimates indicate improved protection during the 
2016–17 influenza season against the predominant influenza A 
(H3N2) virus belonging to genetic group 3C.2a, which emerged 
in early 2014 and was predominant during the 2014–15 
influenza season in the United States. During 2014–15, these

Finder website at https://vaccinefinder.org/?address.
influenza A (H3N2) 3C.2a viruses were antigenically different 
from the recommended A (H3N2) vaccine component, and this 
resulted in low (1%) vaccine effectiveness against illness caused 
by influenza A (H3N2) 3C.2a viruses (4). Low effectiveness of 
the 2014–15 vaccines likely contributed to high rates of influ-
enza-associated hospitalizations that season, especially among 
adults aged ≥65 years. In contrast, rates of influenza-associated 
hospitalizations observed to date have been substantially lower 
during the 2016–17 season (2). Virologic surveillance indicates 
that the majority of influenza A (H3N2) viruses collected by U.S. 
laboratories during the 2016–17 season remain antigenically 
similar to the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014–like cell propagated 
reference virus belonging to genetic group 3C.2a, which is the 
recommended influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2016–17 
Northern Hemisphere vaccine. 
Since the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, VE estimates 
for A (H3N2) viruses have been lower than VE estimates against 
A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses. Interim VE estimates 
against illness caused by influenza A (H3N2) viruses during 
the 2016–17 influenza season are similar to U.S. VE estimates 
against A (H3N2)-related illness during the 2011–12 and 
2012–13 seasons (VE = 39%) (5,6). Also, a meta-analysis of 
VE studies using the test-negative design conducted from the 
2007–08 through the 2014–15 influenza seasons reported a 
pooled VE estimate against A (H3N2)-related illness of 33% 
(CI = 26%–39%), compared with 61% (CI = 57%–65%)

against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and 54% (CI = 46%–61%) 
against influenza B virus–related illness (7). These results reflect 
properties unique to A (H3N2) viruses that pose special chal-
lenges. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses undergo more frequent 
and extensive genetic changes than do influenza A (H1N1) 
and influenza B viruses, and require more frequent updates to 
the A (H3N2) vaccine virus components to maintain activity 
against evolving circulating strains. In addition, A (H3N2) 
viruses continue to undergo changes in their receptor-binding 
specificity, which might result in genetic changes during growth 
in eggs. Most influenza vaccines are manufactured using egg-
based production processes. These genetic changes (referred to as 
egg-adapted changes) alter the antigenic properties of candidate 
vaccine viruses (CVVs) as they are grown in eggs and potentially 
during the vaccine production process (8). The egg-adapted 
changes might contribute to the lower vaccine effectiveness 
seen with A (H3N2) viruses compared with A (H1N1) and 
B viruses. Efforts are ongoing to improve influenza vaccine 
effectiveness against A (H3N2) viruses in CVV development 
and in manufacturing.
As of February 10, 2017, influenza activity remained elevated 
nationally and was widespread across most of the United 
States. During recent A (H3N2) virus predominant–seasons, 
persons aged ≥65 years and young children experienced higher 
rates of severe illness and influenza-associated hospitalization 
compared with other age groups. With vaccine effectiveness 
of 48%, some vaccinated persons will become infected with 
influenza. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion 
for influenza infection among persons with acute respiratory 
illness while influenza activity is ongoing, especially among 
older adults. Early antiviral treatment can reduce severity and 
complications of influenza-associated illness (9). Early antiviral 
treatment is recommended for persons with suspected influenza 
with severe or progressive illness (e.g., hospitalized persons) 
and persons at high risk for complications from influenza, such 
as children aged <2 years, adults aged ≥65 years and persons 
with underlying health conditions,¶ even if illness is less severe. 
¶ A complete summary of guidance for antiviral use is available at https://www.
cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm. Groups at high risk 
for influenza complications include the following: children aged <2 years; adults 
aged ≥65 years; persons with chronic pulmonary conditions (including asthma); 
cardiovascular disease (except hypertension alone); persons with renal, hepatic, 
or hematologic (including sickle cell) disease; persons with metabolic disorders 
(including diabetes mellitus); persons with neurologic and neurodevelopmental 
conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves and 
muscles, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual 
disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular 
dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); persons with immunosuppression, including 
that caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus infection; 
women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery); persons 
aged <19 years who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy; American Indian/
Alaska Natives; persons with morbid obesity (i.e., body-mass index ≥40); and 
residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.
Antiviral medications should be used as recommended for 
treatment in patients with suspected influenza, regardless of 
vaccination status. The decision to initiate antiviral treatment 
should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory confirma-
tion of influenza and should not be dependent on insensitive 
assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tests.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, vaccination status included self-report at four of five 
sites. End-of-season VE estimates based on updated documen-
tation of vaccination status might differ from interim estimates. 
Second, information from medical records and immunization 
registries is needed to evaluate VE by vaccine type and for fully 
vaccinated compared with partially vaccinated children (chil-
dren aged <9 years require 2 vaccine doses during their first 
vaccination season), as well as to evaluate the effects of prior 
season vaccination and timing of vaccination; end-of-season 
analysis of VE by vaccine type and effects of partial or prior 
season vaccination is planned. Third, an observational study 
design has greater potential for confounding and bias relative 
to randomized clinical trials. However, the test-negative design 
is widely used in VE studies and has been used by the U.S. 
Flu VE Network to estimate VE for the past several influenza 
seasons. Finally, small sample sizes in some age groups resulted 
in wide confidence intervals, and end-of-season VE estimates 
could change as additional patient data become available or if 
there is a change in circulating viruses late in the season. It is 
also important to note that the VE estimates in this report are 
limited to the prevention of outpatient medical visits, rather 
than more severe illness outcomes, such as hospitalization or 
death; data from studies measuring VE against more severe 
outcomes will be available at a later date.
Annual vaccination against circulating influenza viruses 
remains the best strategy for preventing illness from influ-
enza. As of early November 2016, only 37% of children aged 
6 months–17 years, 37% of adults aged 18–64 years, and 
57% of adults aged ≥65 years had received influenza vaccine 
this season (10). Among pregnant women, early estimates for 
2016–17 indicated that only 47% had been vaccinated by 
early November 2016 (10). In addition to ongoing vaccina-
tion efforts, antiviral medications continue to be an important 
adjunct to the treatment and control of influenza and should be 
used as recommended, regardless of patient vaccination status.
