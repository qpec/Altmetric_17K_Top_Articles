Summary
Background Low emission zones (LEZ) are an increasingly common, but unevaluated, intervention aimed at 
improving urban air quality and public health. We investigated the impact of London’s LEZ on air quality and 
children’s respiratory health.
Methods We did a sequential annual cross-sectional study of 2164 children aged 8–9 years attending primary schools 
between 2009–10 and 2013–14 in central London, UK, following the introduction of London’s LEZ in February, 2008. 
We examined the association between modelled pollutant exposures of nitrogen oxides (including nitrogen dioxide 
[NO2]) and particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) and less than 10 µm (PM10) and lung 
function: postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1, primary outcome), forced vital capacity (FVC), 
and respiratory or allergic symptoms. We assigned annual exposures by each child’s home and school address, as well 
as spatially resolved estimates for the 3 h (0600–0900 h), 24 h, and 7 days before each child’s assessment, to isolate 
long-term from short-term effects.
Findings The percentage of children living at addresses exceeding the EU limit value for annual NO2 (40 µg/m³) fell 
from 99% (444/450) in 2009 to 34% (150/441) in 2013. Over this period, we identified a reduction in NO2 at both 
roadside (median –1·35 µg/m³ per year; 95% CI –2·09 to –0·61; p=0·0004) and background locations (–0·97; 
–1·56 to –0·38; p=0·0013), but not for PM10. The effect on PM2·5 was equivocal. We found no association between 
postbronchodilator FEV₁ and annual residential pollutant attributions. By contrast, FVC was inversely correlated with 
annual NO2 (–0·0023 L/µg per m³; –0·0044 to –0·0002; p=0·033) and PM10 (–0·0090 L/µg per m³; –0·0175 to –0·0005; 
p=0·038).
Interpretation Within London’s LEZ, a smaller lung volume in children was associated with higher annual air 
pollutant exposures. We found no evidence of a reduction in the proportion of children with small lungs over this 
period, despite small improvements in air quality in highly polluted urban areas during the implementation of 
London’s LEZ. Interventions that deliver larger reductions in emissions might yield improvements in children’s 
health.

Introduction
Air pollution is a leading cause of global mortality, with 
WHO estimates of 7 million premature deaths partly 
attributable to air pollution in 2012, which is 
approximately one in eight global deaths.1 Of these, 
3·7 million relate to outdoor air pollution. With 
increasing population growth and urbanisation, air 
quality has emerged as an important determinant of 
public health within cities,2–4 with the health burden 
falling disproportionately on disadvantaged populations 
who are less able to choose the environments in which 
they live.5 Primary studies and systematic reviews have 
linked air pollution with adverse effects across the 
lifecourse,6 from increased risk of preterm birth7 
and incident childhood asthma,8 to premature cardio­
pulmonary mortality.9 Although urban air pollution 
reflects contributions from a range of local and regional 
sources, studies and reviews have highlighted the 
importance of traffic­related air pollutants on a range of 
health endpoints, with a particular focus on the 
contribution of diesel emissions to poor air quality in 
Europe.6,10–12
Childhood and adolescence are periods of rapid growth 
during which organ systems are particularly susceptible

to injury.13 The ESCAPE meta­analysis of data for 
5921 children from five European birth cohorts showed 
that poor air quality was associated with reduced lung 
function in preadolescent children (aged 6–8 years).14 
Adolescents (aged 9–14 years) showed clinically important 
restrictions on lung growth and function in the southern 
California (USA) Children’s Health Study.15,16 Even in 
relatively low pollution environments (Stockholm County, 
Sweden), lung growth in adolescents (aged 16 years) has 
been related to early life pollutant exposures.17 Impaired 
lung development in childhood has impacts that carry 
into adulthood, with morbidity and mortality linked to 
reduced adult lung function.18 A causal linkage between 
air pollution exposure and suboptimal lung growth has 
been further supported by analysis of consecutive 
longitudinal cohorts in the Children’s Health Study,19 in 
which the proportion of children with clinically small 
lungs was reduced as air quality improved between 1994 
and 2011. These data strongly suggest that policies 
designed to reduce air pollution can deliver a measurable 
health benefit.
Low emission zones (LEZ), areas where the entry of 
polluting vehicles is restricted or penalised on the basis 
of European class emission standards, are often used as 
the major component of emission control strategies. 
London, UK, introduced the world’s largest citywide LEZ 
in 2008 (appendix 1 p 4). Across Europe, about 200 LEZs 
are now in operation, with others in use in Asia, 
including Singapore and Tokyo. Despite the widespread 
application of LEZs to improve air quality, evidence that 
LEZs reduce pollutant concentrations or improve health 
is scarce.20–27 Holman and colleagues26 concluded that 
LEZs in operation in European countries had inconsistent 
effects on PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concen­
trations. Wang and colleagues28 found only six studies 
that addressed impact of traffic LEZ­type emission 
control interventions on health.29–33 Of these, only one31 
gathered health data directly from individuals, finding 
negligible effects on respiratory symptoms. The other 
studies relied on modeling the effects of predicted (not 
necessarily achieved) emission reductions on health. 
Health equity has been assessed in only two studies, with 
opposing conclusions.20,30
The phased introduction of London’s LEZ, beginning 
in 2008, provided the opportunity for a natural experiment 
to evaluate the effect of this emission­based mitigation 
strategy. A description of the various phases of the LEZ is 
presented in appendix 1 (p 4), with the early phases in 
2008 (phases 1 and 2), followed by a further tightening of 
emission controls in 2012 (phase 3). Our objective in this 
study was to evaluate its effect by examining the 
association between pollutant exposures and respiratory 
health in school children living within highly polluted 
areas of central London over the period 2009–14. Our aim 
was to test the hypothesis that improvements in air 
quality would be associated with improved respiratory 
health. We focused on children living in areas of London 
not meeting the EU NO2 limit value (annual mean of 
40 µg/m³), over a period in which improvements in air 
quality were predicted to occur because of improved 
emission controls on diesel powered heavy and light 
goods vehicles.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Exposure to traffic pollutants has been associated with adverse 
health effects, especially in children, with the ESCAPE 
meta-analysis of data for 5921 children showing that poor air 
quality was associated with reduced lung function in 
preadolescent children (aged 6–8 years). The introduction of 
low emission zones (LEZ) has been proposed to improve air 
quality and improve public health. These operate either by 
restricting vehicle entry into urban areas, or through fixed 
penalties on polluting vehicles to encourage uptake of lower 
emission technologies. Despite the political and financial costs 
of LEZ implementation, studies on the impact of these schemes 
on air quality and public health remain scarce. We searched 
MEDLINE for publications from 2009 until Nov 1, 2017, using 
keywords “low emission zone” AND/OR “traffic”, “air quality”, 
and “health”. These reviews showed LEZs do not consistently 
improve air quality, and effects are small. Few studies addressed 
health impacts, and these have tended to rely on modelled 
predictions of air quality improvements.
Added value of this study
We exploited the comprehensive monitoring network in 
London, UK, to evaluate the changes in air pollution following 
the introduction of the LEZ. Our study covered the tightening 
of emission controls within the LEZ in 2012, which occurred 
alongside national, regional, and local policies to improve air 
quality. We based our study in four inner-city London boroughs, 
which were identified as non-compliant with EU annual NO₂ 
limit values at the start of study. Despite the problems 
associated with vehicle non-compliance with European class 
emission standards over this period, we have provided evidence 
of improvements in air quality. We also confirmed the 
previously reported association between pollutant exposures 
and reduced children’s lung volume. We observed some 
evidence of a reduction in rhinitis, but not asthma symptoms 
or the proportion of children with small lungs over the study 
period.
Implications of all available evidence
Large-scale LEZs can deliver improvements in urban air quality 
and these can be linked to changes in childhood respiratory 
health. However, more ambitious schemes than those evaluated 
here are required to meet legislative limits and deliver 
improvements to respiratory health in many European cities.

Methods
Study design and study population
We used a sequential cross­sectional study to avoid risks 
of attrition in a mobile inner­city population with a 
classic cohort design. We invited 28 primary schools in 
the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney, 
Greenwich, and the City of London to participate, 
focusing on schools close to air quality monitoring 
stations to maximise the accuracy of exposure data, 
reflecting a range of distances from major roads (<500 m). 
Within these schools, all children in year 4 (aged 
8–9 years) were invited to participate; we had no exclusion 
criteria. Data were collected during winter periods: from 
November 2008, to January 2009 (pilot study), and 
between November and March or April for the full 5 year 
study (2009–10 until 2013–14). The pilot was used to 
evaluate the feasibility of doing bronchodilator lung 
function tests within the school setting and establish the 
required sample size for the full study (2009–14; 
years 1–5). Information about the study was sent home in 
school bags with each child, along with a consent form 
and a questionnaire for parents to complete and return to 
the school. During a single study visit to each school each 
year, health assessments were done to examine lung 
function and collect biological samples (appendix 1 p 5). 
Additional information on sex, age, ethnicity, and 
residential address was obtained from school records. 
We assigned socioeconomic status according to the resi­
dential address using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(IMD). Height and weight were measured during the 
health assessment and the body­mass index (BMI) 
calculated.
Ethics
Parents gave written consent and children verbal assent, 
to participate in the health assessment. The study 
was approved by the local research ethics committee 
(East London and The City HA Local Research Ethics 
Committee [REC] 2, REC ref number 08­H0704­139) and 
conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
Long-term and short-term exposure attributions
We estimated exposures at the residential and school 
address from annual (2008–13) nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
NO₂, particulate matter with a diameter of less than 
10 µm (PM10), and less than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) maps of 
London using the KCLurban model with the Atmospheric 
Dispersion Modelling System dispersion model version 4 
and road source model version 2.3 (Cambridge Environ­
mental Research Consultants 19),34 measured hourly 
meteorological data, and empirically derived NO–NO2–O3 
and PM associations and emissions from the London 
Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (appendix 1 p 7).35 In 
this analysis, we also weighted these annual exposure 
estimates for periods spent at the home and school 
address points, based on the following criteria: 84·4% of 
time at home and 15·6% at school, based on a 7 h school 
day for 5 days per week, 39 weeks per year. Thus, each 
child’s weighted exposure was estimated by the addition 
of time at home multiplied by 0·884 with time at school 
multiplied by 0·156.
We derived acute exposure estimates at the address 
point by scaling annual mean concentrations according 
to a nowcast factor (appendix 1 pp 8–10) calculated for 
each pollutant for periods immediately before lung 
function evaluation. This factor is defined as the ratio 
between concentrations, measured by a local subset of 
continuous air pollution monitoring sites in the previous 
period and the annual mean of measurements at the 
same sites. For this study, we calculated nowcast scaling 
factors for the 3 h period immediately before the school 
day (0600–0900 h), 24 h, and 7 days before the school 
visits to reflect both acute and subchronic exposure 
periods. To derive NOx and NO2, we averaged measure­
ments of scaling factors across 14–17 urban background 
and roadside sites within and surrounding the London 
boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, on the basis of 
data availability. For the PM10 and PM2·5 scaling factors, 
measurements from 9–13 and 14–20 background and 
roadside sites were averaged, respectively. We have sum­
marised the correlations between pollutant attributions 
at each exposure interval in appendix 1 (p 11–14) for each 
study year, including the pilot.
Lung function assessments
Trained investigators assessed children’s respiratory 
function by spirometry (MicroLab, Micro Medical, 
Carefusion, Wokingham, UK), according to American 
Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society 
(ERS) guidelines36 with baseline and postbronchodilator 
measurements, following administration of salbutamol 
400 µg by large volume spacer. Each spirometry 
assessment aimed to obtain three acceptable and two 
repeatable attempts both before and after bronchodilator. 
Quality control was based on the ATS and ERS guidelines, 
modified for children. Spirometry data were quality 
controlled by three senior respiratory scientists, with one 
performing this role throughout the full 6 year duration 
of the study (appendix 1 p 15).
Symptoms
We collected information on respiratory and allergic 
symptoms using a parent­completed questionnaire, 
based on the validated International Study of Asthma 
and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, 
as described previously,27 and current and lifetime 
symptoms were defined (appendix 1 p 16). Information 
on the ques 
tionnaires was entered as recorded, regardless 
of apparent inconsistencies. Unanswered questions were 
coded as missing. We calculated symptom prevalence by 
dividing the number of positive responses by the total 
number of completed questionnaires, as described 
previously.27

Urine collection and analysis
Spot urine samples were collected for the determination 
of cotinine concentrations using a commercial microplate 
enzyme immunoassay (Cozart Forensic Microplate 
EIA for cotinine; M155B1; Concateno, Abingdon, UK). 
Urinary creatinine concentrations were also measured 
with a commercially available kit (Cayman Chemical 
Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Exposure to environ­
mental tobacco smoke was defined as a creatinine­
corrected cotinine value greater than 30 ng/mg.
Outcomes
The study was powered for the primary objective: a 4% 
year­on­year improvement in forced expiratory volume in 
1 s (FEV1) in year 4 school children living within London’s 
LEZ. Secondary objectives were assessing improvement 
in other lung function parameters: forced vital capacity 
(FVC) and a reduction in respiratory symptoms, by use 
of the modified ISAAC questionnaire.
Evaluation of air quality changes over the study period
To evaluate air pollution trends, we calculated running 
annual mean concentrations (2006–14) of the main 
criterion pollutants (NO2, PM10, and PM2·5), plus NOx, for 
inner and outer London roadside and background 
locations, using a subset of the London Air Quality 
Network monitoring sites within and surrounding the 
study area (appendix 2). Additionally, for the period of the 
LEZ (2008–13), we calculated linear trends using the 
Theil­Sen estimator method, from monthly means, 
previously deseasonalised with the seasonal and trend 
decomposition technique, Loess.37 Forest plots were then 
produced for those sites having at least a 75% capture 
rate over the 5 year period, beginning 2008 and ending 
2013, and the overall trend was calculated by fitting 
the linear random­effects model DerSimonian­Laird 
estimator, as previously described.38
Statistical analysis and sample size calculations
We established the required sample size from data 
collected during the pilot year (2008–09). These pilot data 
showed the mean FEV1 to be 1·71 L (SD 0·28), with valid 
measurements obtained from 150 (74%) of 202 children. 
To detect a 4% increase in FEV1 from 1·71 L to 1·78 L in 
two successive years with 80% power at a 5% significance 
level would require 245 children per year under simple 
random sampling. Assuming 74% of children returned 
valid lung function measurements, the mean cluster size 
for analysis would be 22 children out of a class of 
30 children. The design effect, based on an intracluster 
correlation coefficient of 0·03, was:
which inflated the sample size to 400. Therefore, 
19 classes (rounded up from 18·2; calculated by 
400 divided by 22) were needed to be sampled in the 
full study.
We used linear mixed models with a random effect for 
school to examine the effects of children’s air pollutant 
exposures, over prescribed intervals (0600–0900 h on the 
day of the school visit, 24 h before, 7 days before, and the 
annual values) on lung function outcomes, including a 
sensitivity analysis using prebronchodilator values. We 
selected baseline characteristics a priori to be included 
in the models: age, sex, height, BMI, self­reported 
ethnicity (Asian, black, white, or mixed or other), socio­
economic status, and exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke. To assess the assumption of no change over 
time, the study year was also included as a covariate in 
the models.
Respiratory and allergic symptoms were recoded 
as binary variables and their associations with annual 
air pollution exposures, adjusted for the covariates 
outlined above, were evaluated with mixed­effects logistic 
regression. Study years were also included in the model 
to account for any year­on­year changes. All statistical 
evaluations were based on the data from study years 1–5, 
and the impact of including the data from the pilot year 
was also examined as a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, 
as this study was based on post 
bronchodilator lung 
function, we also examined the associations with pre­
bronchodilator baseline lung function to allow com­
parison with previous studies with this approach only. 
We used multi­pollutant models, but because of the high 
correlation between the four selected pollutants at each 
sampling interval across the study years (appendix 1 
pp 12–14) they were not informative. Statistical 
significance was assumed at the 5% level. All statistical 
analyses were done with Stata version 14.1.

and the final responsibility to submit for publication.
Results
Across the full study (years 1–5) and the pilot study, 
2462 children were approached, of whom 2366 (96%) 
consented to the full health assessment (figure 1). Of the 
2164 children recruited into the full study running from 
the winter period from 2009–10 to 2013–14, the primary 
outcome—technically acceptable FEV1—was obtained 
from 2013 children (mean FEV1 of 1·69 L; mean FVC of 
1·87 L for 1969 children; appendix 1 p 17). Of these 
participants, annual air pollution attributions were 
available for 1981, with nowcast­adjusted acute exposure 
estimates available for 1950 children (figure 1). Overall, 
there appeared to be slightly more girls than boys, 
with the largest ethnic group being Asian (table). 
Environmental tobacco smoke exposure, assessed as a 
urinary cotinine concentration of more than 30 mg/mg 
creatinine, was observed in 15% (332/2164) of the cohort, 
but fell from 21% (94/441) in year 1 to 11% (50/438) in 
year 5 (table). A comparison of the demographic and 
exposure data for the children included (n=1981) and 
excluded (n=183) from the primary analysis is included 
in appendix 1 (p 18). This comparison shows that no 
systematic bias was introduced through the exclusion of 
this group of children. Additionally, key demographic 
details of the study boroughs over years 1–5 of the study 
are shown in appendix 1 (p 19), showing the represent­
ativeness of participants in relation to the demography of 
study boroughs. The associations between the demo­
graphic variables with lung function are summarised in 
appendix 1 (p 20). For both FEV1 and FVC, significant 
associations were observed with age, gender, height, and 
BMI, but not with IMD score, or evidence of environ­
mental tobacco smoke exposure (appendix 1 p 20). Clear 
differences in lung function variables between the three 
major ethnic groups were observed, with the Asian 
population (the largest) as the comparator. Overall, white 
children’s FEV₁ and FVC were larger than those of Asian 
children, which in turn were larger than those reported 
in black children (appendix 1 p 20). After controlling for 
all annual pollutant exposures, lung function parameters 
were not different between study years.

time trends provide no evidence of clear step changes in 
pollutant concentrations following the various phases of 
the LEZ (figure 3, appendix 1 p 24). To examine changes 
in air quality in greater detail, linear trends over the 
period 2008–13 were calculated with the Theil­Sen 
method for a number of roadside and background sites. 
For both NOx and NO2, despite considerable heterogeneity 
between sites, evidence was clear for a decrease in both 
roadside (median –2·97 µg/m³ per year for NOx; 95% CI 
–4·49 to –1·45; p=0·0001; and –1·35 µg/m³ per year for 
NO2; –2·09 to –0·61; p=0·0004) and urban background 
concentrations (–1·10; –2·16 to –0·04; p=0·0418; 
and –0·97; –0·97 to –0·38; p=0·0013; respectively; 
figure 3C–F). For NO2, this result corresponded to an 
overall reduction of 6·75 µg/m³ for roadside locations 
and 4·85 µg/m³ at background locations over the 5 year 
study period. Concordant with this observation, the 
proportion of children living at addresses exceeding the 
EU limit value for NO2 fell across the study period, from 
99% (444/450) in study year 1 to 34% (150/441) in study 
year 5, based on all children for whom modelled estimates 
were available (table). The outcome for PM10 and PM2·5 
was less clear, with no evident reduction at roadside sites 
(appendix 1 p 25).

We analysed the associations between postbronchodilator 
FEV1 (figure 4A–D) and FVC (figure 4E–H), by year and 
aggregated across study years 1–5. For FEV1, associations 
were small with confidence intervals that spanned zero 
and did not attain statistical significance (figure 4). 
Inclusion of the data collected in the study pilot did not 
alter this outcome (appendix 1 p 26). By contrast, FVC was 
inversely associated with annual NOx, NO2 (–0·0023 L/µg 
per m³; –0·0044 to –0·0002; p=0·033), and PM10 
(–0·0090 L/µg per m³; –0·0175 to –0·0005; p=0·038) 
exposures (figure 4E–H, appendix 1 p 27), with no clear 
evidence of an impact of study year. Neither FEV1 nor FVC 
were associated with exposures on the morning of the 
assessment (0600–0900 h), or in the previous 24 h, but 
robust negative associations were observed in the 7 day 
average PM10 and PM2·5 exposures (figure 5). We have 
provided data as change in volume (L) per µg/m³ of 
pollutant exposure (figures 4, 5) and also as IQR annual 
exposures for FEV1 and FVC (appendix 1 p 28) for both 
home and home and school exposure attributions. As 
many previous studies examining air pollution lung 
function associations have used lung function without 
bronchodilation, we ran this investigation as a post­hoc 
sensitivity analysis (appendix 1 p 29). Although the 
associations between annual pollutant exposure and FVC 
were attenuated and did not attain statistical significance 
(p values ranged 0·050 to 0·072, based on home 
exposures), the data revealed similar trends. The inverse 
association between 7 day average PM10 and PM2·5 with 
reduced FEV1 and FVC were robust to the use of 
prebronchodilator values (appendix 1 p 29). Despite the 
evidence of reductions in roadside and background NO2 
and the association between annual pollutants exposures 
and reduced FVC, we observed no clear reduction in the 
proportion of children with predicted lung function less 
than 80%, 85%, or 90% of predicted (appendix 1 p 30).
We found limited evidence of significant associations 
between current and lifetime respiratory and allergic 
symptoms 
with 
annual 
pollutant 
attributions 
(appendix 1 p 31). Of the symptoms examined, only 
current rhinitis symptoms showed a positive association 
with the annual pollutant concentrations, although these 
did not attain statistical significance (eg, p=0·09 for 
PM10). When data from the pilot year were included in 
these analyses the association with PM10 was significant 
(p=0·010), as was the association with PM2·5 (p=0·017), 
consistent with earlier observations on children living 
within London.27 We therefore examined the yearly 
associations in current rhinitis and lifetime asthma 
(appendix 1 p 32). This analysis indicated that the 
prevalence of rhinitis fell markedly from the period of 
the pilot and the first year of the study onward 
(appendix 1 p 32).
Discussion
Over the period covering the implementation of London’s 
LEZ, we identified evidence of reduced NO2 and NOx 
concentrations at roadside and background locations 
within the study area, in the absence of improvements in 
PM10. The proportion of children living at locations that 
did not meet the EU annual limit value for NO2 
(40 µg/m³) fell threefold over the same period, although 
there was considerable inter­year variation. Importantly, 
these measured changes in pollutant concentrations 
occurred in parallel to published evidence of good 
compliance with the tighter emission standards.39 
Furthermore, there was no evidence that the compliance 
within London resulted in a displacement of more 
polluting vehicles to regions outside London’s LEZ.39 
Despite these improvements, we observed evidence of 
reduced lung volumes in children associated with NOx, 
NO2, and PM10 annual exposures over the same period, 
with no evidence of a decrease in the proportion of 
children with small lung volumes for their age over 
the 5 year study. The associations with NOx and NO2 
were independent of shorter­term exposure estimates, 
suggesting that the reduced volumes reflected the longer­
term impact of air pollution. Notably, despite evidence of 
significant improvements in air quality over the duration 
of the study, considerable areas of inner and outer 
London remain above the EU NO2 limit value (figure 2). 
Although we found evidence for improvements at 
roadside and background sites, at the current rate of 
change, full compliance with EU limit values for NO2 for 
London remains distant, without a substantial tightening 
of current emission controls.
The main strengths of our study included the intensity 
of both traffic exposures and coverage of the available air 
quality monitoring, including measurement sites 
specifically established to monitor the impact of London’s 
LEZ. Our study took place in an area where a substantial 
proportion of children live in areas that do not meet 
EU targets for NO2 exposure, with most schools and 
residences all within 500 m of busy roads. Our data, from 
2009–10 onwards, cover a period when traffic fleets have 
become increasingly dominated by diesel vehicles, with 
associated problems of high NO2 concentrations and 
primary particle emissions. Consequently, we believe 
that our study is unique in reflecting the impact of a 
modern European city’s air quality environment. A key 
innovation of our study was the use of novel modelling of 
exposures that allowed us to differentiate effects of short­
term, medium­term, and long­term exposures on the 
same spatial scale. Our use of postbronchodilator values 
provided reliable estimates of children’s lung capacities

and therefore high­quality lung function data. Concerns 
about attrition in an urban mobile population meant that 
we chose not to use a classic longitudinal cohort design. 
This choice restricted our capacity to directly address 
lung growth or to quantify improvements associated 
with improved air quality. Our study also lacked a control 
population that was not subject to the effects of the LEZ, 
which was a weakness, and our focus on inner­city 
boroughs restricted the range of exposure contrasts that 
would have been achieved by a broader geographical 
coverage. For NO2 and PM10, this outcome was less of a 
problem as the exposure ranges were still large, but 
for PM2·5 we had relatively little exposure contrast. 
Additionally, as our study did not commence until after 
the introduction of the initial phases of the LEZ in 
February, 2008, we have probably underestimated the full 
effects of the scheme.
The ESCAPE project examined the association between 
lung function data collected from children (aged 
6–8 years) across five European cohorts, between 2002 
and 2007, with annual pollutant exposures based on 
residential address using land use regression models. 
Furthermore, the effects of short­term exposures on the 
lung function measurements were assessed based on 
measurements made at regional and urban background 
monitoring sites. This analysis, with a combined 
population of 5921 children, showed annual exposures 
to NO2, NOx, PM10, and PM2·5 were associated with 
significant reductions in FEV1.14 The negative impact of 
primary traffic­derived pollutants on children’s lung 
function has also been further reinforced by two US 
studies, in which traffic exposures were associated with 
reduced FEV1 and FVC,15,16 and in the Children’s Health 
Study,19 which showed that reductions in pollution 
delivered clinically meaningful improvements in FEV1 
and FVC.
Our study confirms and extends these observations, by 
showing inverse associations between lung function and 
exposure to urban air, particularly to NOx and NO2, which 
are good proxies for diesel emissions within London. As 
lung function decrements have been observed in 
response to experimental diesel challenges40 and real­
world exposures to air pollution at high diesel traffic 
locations,41 we had to establish that acute exposures were 
not affecting the results observed. We therefore derived 
short­term exposure estimates for varying periods 
running up to each child’s health assessment using the 
nowcast method. This analysis showed that the morning 
and 24 h exposures before the health assessments had 
little impact on children’s lung function, reinforcing the 
view that the association between the annual exposure 
and reduced FVC was indicative of a chronic impact on 
lung function, most probably explained by reduced lung 
growth in this cohort. Of note, compared with these 
studies, the annual exposures to pollutants in our London 
cohort, particularly for NOx and NO2, are very high. For 
example, they are greater than the NO2 concentrations 
in Urman and colleagues’ study42 of high pollution 
communities, and almost two­fold higher than the 
concentrations in the highest exposure cohort in the 
ESCAPE project14 (GINI and LISA cohorts): mean 
43·52 µg/m³ (SD 5·45) versus 23·4 µg/m³ (2·8). The 
range of NO2 exposures observed within the Swedish 
BAMSE cohort, the largest of the ESCAPE children’s 
cohorts (44% of the total population) with the lowest 
exposures, varied between 6·0 µg/m³ and 33·0 µg/m³.14 
Therefore, all the annual NO2 exposure attributions 
within that cohort were below the range observed in 
London: 31·2–98·9 µg/m³. The higher concentrations 
observed in our study reflect not only the more urban 
nature of the study population, but also the increased 
concentrations of NO2 and NOx observed within 
European cities since the mid­2000s, due to increased 
use of diesel in vehicles (dieselisation).43
Notable differences exist between our study and 
previously cited literature. First, to our knowledge, this is 
the only study examining the interaction of urban air 
pollution on lung function, in which measurements have 
been obtained postbronchodilator. This measurement 
removes confounding due to undiagnosed or poorly 
managed asthma. Our study population lives in one 
of the most deprived and polluted areas in the UK 
(appendix 1 p 19) and, perhaps most importantly, this 
study reflects the contemporary urban air quality 
environment. By contrast, most of the cohorts inves­
tigated in the published literature have linked air 
pollutant exposures to lung function measurement made 
in the 1990s to the early­to­mid­2000s (Schultz and 
colleagues [1994–2001],44 Gao and colleagues [1996–2003],45 
Nordling and colleagues [modelled exposures to 
children’s birth year, 1994–97],46 Gehring and colleagues 
[2000–07],14 Eenhuizen and colleagues [exposure at birth 
address 1996–97, related to airway patency at 4 years of 
age in 2000–01],47 Hoek and colleagues [1988–99],48 Roy 
and colleagues [1993–96]49). Consequently, these studies 
largely report on associations with historic air pollution 
scenarios and do not fully capture the changes that have 
occurred in many European cities because of the 
dieselisation of the vehicle fleet, and the introduction of 
particle traps. The exception to these reports is the follow­
up of the Californian Children’s Health Study,19 but the 
proportion of diesels within the US vehicle fleet is much 
lower than that in European cities.43 Globally, diesel cars 
have increased their share of the car market worldwide, 
with much of this growth in Europe, where more than 
half of new cars are fuelled by diesel.43
Our findings have important implications for the health 
of children living in central London and other high 
pollution urban environments, particularly in Europe 
where diesel vehicles make up a substantial proportion of 
the vehicle fleet.43 We have provided quantitative evidence 
of improvements of NO2 concentrations within London’s 
LEZ, representing a proxy for diesel tailpipe emissions. 
The extent to which these improvements can be solely

attributed to the tightening of emission standards within 
the zone in early 2011 is difficult to ascertain, given the 
number of other actions that have been ongoing, which 
have been summarised previously.37 The fact that these 
benefits have been achieved against the backdrop of the 
delayed implementation of the LEZ’s later phases and 
vehicles not performing to European emission standards 
during real­life driving conditions50 suggests that further 
tightening of regulations will achieve more pronounced 
pollutant reductions. Although longer­term evaluations 
of the LEZs impact are in progress, the introduction and 
rigorous evaluation of zones with greater reductions in 
pollutant concentrations both in London and other cities 
are clearly warranted.
The impacts on children’s FVC might appear small 
(0·0023 L/µg per m³ of NO2); however, these decrements 
need to be viewed against the very high annual exposures 
in the study areas. Over the full 5 years of the study, the 
average exposure to NO2 equated to a projected FVC loss 
of between 89·0 mL and 99·6 mL. Given the average 
FVC seen within the study population of 1·87 L, this 
result equates to a loss of between 4·8% and 5·3%. These 
calculations require certain caveats because they imply a 
simple linear association and the absence of the threshold 
concentration, but nevertheless they raise great public 
health concerns. Although changes of this magnitude 
are unlikely to be clinically significant in the healthy 
population, the more important issue is whether this 
change results in an inability to attain maximal lung 
development in adulthood, with potential impacts on 
long­term health.18 Until longer­term impacts are known, 
clinicians should consider advising parents of children 
with lung disease to avoid living in high pollutant areas, 
or to adopt personal mitigation measures to limit their 
exposures.
Research is needed to determine whether lung deficits 
arising from air pollutant exposures in childhood persist 
into adulthood and to identify which factors lead to 
increased susceptibility to or protection from these 
adverse effects. Although long­term data from California 
provide grounds for cautious optimism that poor lung 
growth trajectories can be improved by reducing 
pollution,19 this idea must be viewed in the context of the 
much higher exposure concentrations seen in our study 
and the different mix of pollutant sources, particularly 
diesel vehicles. The extent to which observations in the 
USA are generalisable to the European region is not 
clear. Our study also only infers changes in lung growth, 
from the association of FVC with long­term, and not 
short­term, exposures. Further studies should use 
longitudinal cohort designs to assess health effects of 
interventions that will deliver more substantial im­
provements in urban air quality.
