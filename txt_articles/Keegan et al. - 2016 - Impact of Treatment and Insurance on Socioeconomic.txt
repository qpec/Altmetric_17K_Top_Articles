Abstract
Background: Previous studies documented racial/ethnic and
socioeconomic disparities in survival after Hodgkin lymphoma
among adolescents and young adults (AYA), but did not consider
the influence of combined-modality treatment and health
insurance.
Methods: Data for 9,353 AYA patients ages 15 to 39 years when
diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma during 1988 to 2011 were
obtained from the California Cancer Registry. Using multivariate
Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined the impact of
sociodemographic characteristics [race/ethnicity, neighborhood
socioeconomic status (SES), and health insurance], initial com-
bined-modality treatment, and subsequent cancers on survival.
Results: Over the 24-year study period, we observed improve-
ments in Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival by diagnostic
period and differences in survival by race/ethnicity, neighbor-
hood SES, and health insurance for a subset of more recently
diagnosed patients (2001–2011). In multivariable analyses,
Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival was worse for Blacks than
Whites with early-stage [HR: 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.14–2.49] and late-stage disease (HR: 1.68; 95% CI, 1.17–2.41)
and for Hispanics than Whites with late-stage disease (HR: 1.58;
95% CI, 1.22–2.04). AYAs diagnosed with early-stage disease
experienced worse survival if they also resided in lower SES
neighborhoods (HR: 2.06; 95% CI, 1.59–2.68). Furthermore,
more recently diagnosed AYAs with public health insurance or
who were uninsured experienced worse Hodgkin lymphoma–
specific survival (HR: 2.08; 95% CI, 1.52–2.84).
Conclusion: Our findings identify several subgroups of Hodg-
kin lymphoma patients at higher risk for Hodgkin lymphoma
mortality.
Impact: Identifying and reducing barriers to recommended
treatment and surveillance in these AYAs at much higher risk of
mortality is essential to ameliorating these survival disparities.

Introduction
For Hodgkin lymphoma, one of the most common cancers of
adolescents and young adults (AYA) 15 to 39 years of age (1),
treatment with combined-modality (radiation plus chemothera-
py) regimens has led to substantial improvements in survival over
time and has been commonly recommended for patients with
limited stage disease and those with bulky, advanced stage disease
(2, 3). However, these impressive survival gains have not been
shared uniformly across the AYA population, as worse outcomes
have been documented for 15 to 44 year olds of lower neighbor-
hood socioeconomic status (SES; ref. 4) and non-White race/
ethnicity (4, 5).
Among explanations for these disparities, the similarity of
disparities for overall and Hodgkin lymphoma–specific surviv-
al (4) and the persistent difference in relative survival by
neighborhood SES over time (4), implicate variations in initial
treatment and management more than variations in the late
complications sometimes resulting from Hodgkin lymphoma
(6). We previously found that Blacks (52%) and Hispanics
(47%) were more likely to receive chemotherapy alone (as
compared
with
combined-modality)
than
non-Hispanic
Whites (38%) or Asian/Pacific Islanders (API; 40%) 15 to 44
years of age (4). Recent (1995–2010) population-based data on
AYAs with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma also showed that
Blacks and Hispanics, and patients residing in lower SES
neighborhoods, had lower utilization of radiotherapy, and
Blacks and Hispanics, and AYAs not receiving radiation had
higher mortality (7).
In addition, inadequate health insurance is associated with
later stage at diagnosis, undertreatment, and worse survival (8–
12). Adult (�18 years) Hodgkin lymphoma patients with early-
stage disease who were uninsured were less likely to receive
chemotherapy and radiation (12), and AYAs who were uninsured,
had public health insurance, or resided in lower SES neighbor-
hoods were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage
Hodgkin lymphoma (11).

 In efforts to date to understand Hodgkin lymphoma survival
disparities, no prior studies have considered the influence of
both receipt of initial combined-modality treatment and insur-
ance on the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in
survival among AYAs diagnosed with all stages of Hodgkin
lymphoma. Therefore, to identify sociodemographic patient
subgroups that have not benefited from well-established and
effective treatments, we evaluated the impact of sociodemo-
graphic characteristics (race/ethnicity, neighborhood SES, and
health insurance), initial combined-modality treatment, and
subsequent cancers on survival among AYAs diagnosed with
early- and late-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Patients eligible for the study were all persons who resided in
California when newly diagnosed at ages 15 through 39 years
with classical Hodgkin lymphoma [International Classification of
Diseases—Oncology, 3rd edition (13) morphology codes 9650–
9655, 9663–9667] during the period January 1, 1988 through
December 31, 2011 and reported to the California Cancer Registry
(CCR). From the CCR, which operates under a state cancer
reporting law and comprises three National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) regis-
tries, we obtained information routinely recorded in the medical
record at diagnosis for each patient on age, sex, race/ethnicity
[non-Hispanic White (hereafter called "White"), Hispanic, Black,
and API], summary stage [localized (Ann Arbor stage I), regional
(stage II), and advanced (stage III/IV)], extent of disease, tumor
histologic subtype (nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lympho-
cyte depletion, lymphocyte rich, or not otherwise specified),
marital status (never married, married, previously married, and
unknown), hospital providing initial care, and census-block
group of residence. With information on extent of disease, we
classified patients by the presence of B symptoms (weight loss,
night sweats, and fever) and HIV or AIDS. In addition, we
obtained registry data on initial treatment modality [radiation
(yes, no,unknown)and chemotherapy(yes,no, unknown)],from
which we created a combined modality measure; subsequent
primary cancer(s) reported during the study period; vital status
(routinely determined by the CCR through hospital follow-up
and linkages to state and national vital status and other databases)
as of December 2012; and, for the deceased, the underlying cause
of death as routinely coded by state vital statistics personnel.
We also obtained information on the primary source of pay-
ment at initial diagnosis and/or treatment (health insurance),
which was reportable to the CCR for patients diagnosed from
2001 forward. Health insurance was grouped into public (Med-
icaid and other government-assisted programs), private (health
maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations,
managed care not otherwise specified, and military care), none,
and unknown (11). Consistent with prior observations that the
small percentage of AYA cancer patients who were uninsured likely
reflect retroactive enrollment in Medicaid at the time of cancer
diagnosis (9), we considered publicly insured and uninsured
together in the survival analyses. Hospitals were classified accord-
ing to whether or not they were NCI-designated cancer centers.
We used a multicomponent index of neighborhood SES based
on patients' residential census-block group at diagnosis. The index
is derived from data from the 2000 U.S. Census (for patients
diagnosed through 2005) and the 2006 to 2010 American Com-
munity Survey (for patients diagnosed in 2006 forward) on
education, occupation, unemployment, household income, pov-
erty, rent, and house values (14). The indices are grouped into
quintiles, based on the distribution of SES across all census block
groups in California, and, as done previously (4), into one of two
categories for models stratified by stage at diagnosis: lower SES
(quintiles 1, 2, and 3) and higher SES (quintiles 4 and 5). Each
cancer patient was assigned to his/her neighborhood SES cate-
gory. Based upon the population density of census blocks (15,
16), we defined urbanization level as metropolitan (metropolitan
urban and metropolitan suburban blocks), nonmetropolitan
(city, town, and rural blocks), or unknown.
The final study population included 9,353 AYA Hodgkin lym-
phoma patients after exclusion, in a hierarchical manner, of those
with: (i) unknown race/ethnicity (n ¼ 166); (ii) cancer registry or
death certificate evidence of HIV or AIDS (ref. 17; n ¼ 262),
because of the substantially poorer outcome of HIV-associated
Hodgkin lymphoma during the study period (18, 19); and (iii)
Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis at autopsy only, by death certif-
icate only, or with zero/invalid survival time (n ¼ 40). All study
protocols were overseen by the Institutional review board of the
Cancer Prevention Institute of California.
Statistical analyses
Outcomes of interest included overall survival, which considers
death from all causes, and Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival,
which considers only death from Hodgkin lymphoma. For
deceased patients, survival time was measured in days from the
date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause for overall
survival, and to the date of death from Hodgkin lymphoma for
Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival. Patients who died from
other causes were censored at the time of death in analyses of
Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival. Patients alive at the study
end date (12/31/2012) were censored at this time or at the date
of last known contact. Ninety-four percent of censored patients
had a follow-up date within 2 years of the study end date, but
this number was slightly higher for Whites (95%), Blacks (96%),
and APIs (95%) than for Hispanics (89%).
To evaluate associations with survival (overall and Hodgkin
lymphoma-specific) controlling for known prognostic factors, we
used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to esti-
mate hazard ratios (HR) and associated 95% confidence intervals
(CI). Models included variables with a priori reasons for inclusion
(e.g., age, race/ethnicity, gender, year of diagnosis, marital status,
B symptoms, histologic subtype, hospital type, neighborhood SES
and urbanization, and insurance status) and included stage at
diagnosis, combined-modality therapy, and subsequent cancer as
stratifying variables to allow for differing baseline hazards asso-
ciated with these variables. In addition, separate Cox proportional
hazards models were conducted by stage at diagnosis. Effect
modification was assessed between SES and stage at diagnosis,
health insurance, and gender; between race/ethnicity and SES,
health insurance, and stage at diagnosis; and between age and
marital status, by including interaction terms in the multivariable
models. No interaction terms were statistically significant at
P < 0.05. In all models, the proportional hazards assumption
was assessed numerically based on cumulative sumsof Martingale
residuals (20) and visually based on inspection of the survival
curves [log (�log) of the survival distribution function by log
(months)]. There was evidence of a violation of this assumption

 with stage at diagnosis, combined-modality therapy, and subse-
quent cancers; therefore, stratified Cox proportional hazards
regression models are presented. Regression analyses were con-
ducted using the SAS version 9.3 software (SAS institute Inc.).
Results
In this cohort of 9,353 AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients, 32%
were followed for 15 years or more, with the mean follow-up time
of 11.0 years (SD ¼ 7.1). Sociodemographic and clinical char-
acteristics of AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients varied by race/
ethnicity, with a predominance of Whites (63%) and, to a lesser
extent, Hispanics (24%), and an increasing proportion of Asians
over time (Table 1). Black (40%) and Hispanic (37%) AYAs were
more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage than Whites
(31%) or APIs (34%), and higher percentages of Black (54%) and
Hispanic (49%) AYAs received chemotherapy alone than Whites
(40%) or APIs (42%). More than 73% of Blacks and Hispanics
resided in the lowest three categories of neighborhood SES
compared with fewer than 47% of Whites and APIs. Blacks
(35%) and Hispanics (39%) were much more likely to have
public or no insurance than Whites (17%) or APIs (16%). Nearly
6% of AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients were diagnosed with a
subsequent primary cancer. Asof December 2012, more than 13%
of AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients had died, predominantly
from cancer (72%).
In multivariable analyses, worse Hodgkin lymphoma–specific
survival was associated with male sex (borderline significance),
earlier year of diagnosis, and presence of B symptoms (Table 2).
Black AYAs experienced a 62% higher risk of Hodgkin lymphoma
death (hereafter referred to as mortality; HR: 1.62; 95% CI, 1.24–
2.11) and Hispanics experienced a 35% higher risk of Hodgkin
lymphoma mortality (HR: 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12–1.64) than Whites.
In addition, AYAs residing in lower SES neighborhoods experi-
enced a 52% to 77% greater risk of Hodgkin lymphoma mortality
than those residing in the highest SES neighborhood categories.
Worse overall survival (Table 2) was associated with many of the
same factors as Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival, except
that earlier age at diagnosis was associated with better all-cause
survival.
AYAs with public or no insurance experienced much worse
Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival (HR: 2.08; 95% CI, 1.52–
2.84) than those with private or military insurance (Table 2). The
addition of health insurance to the multivariable models atten-
uated the HR for race/ethnicity by less than 9%, but attenuated the
HR for neighborhood SES by up to 22%. Nevertheless, the HR for
Hodgkin lymphoma-specific survival comparing the highest
neighborhood SES to the lowest was still evident, although of
borderline significance (HR: 1.67; 95% CI, 0.97–2.86; data not
shown in tables).
In separate models for stage at diagnosis (Table 3), Blacks
with early- and late-stage disease experienced a 68% greater risk
of Hodgkin lymphoma mortality, whereas Hispanics with late-
stage, but not early-stage disease experienced a greater risk of
Hodgkin lymphoma mortality (HR: 1.58; 95% CI, 1.22–2.04).
In addition, the association between lower neighborhood SES
and Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival only was apparent
among AYAs diagnosed with early-stage disease (HR: 2.06; 95%
CI, 1.59–2.68). AYAs with early or late-stage disease experienced
greater than a two-fold increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma

 mortality if they had public or no insurance. Worse overall survival
by stage at diagnosis (Table 3) was associated with many of the
same factors as Hodgkin lymphoma–specific survival.
The use of radiation in Hodgkin lymphoma treatment
decreased over time (Fig. 1). To compare our results to those in
prior studies (7, 12), we also examined the impact of initial
combined-modality therapy on survival as an adjustment variable
(rather than a stratifying variable due the violation of the pro-
portional hazards assumption). We found that initial treatment
with radiation was associated with better Hodgkin lymphoma–
specific survival [HR for chemotherapy and radiation (vs. che-
motherapy only): 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.02; HR for radiation only
(vs. chemotherapy only): 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23–0.51; data not
shown in tables]. These associations were similar for early- and
late-stage disease (Fig. 2).

 observed improvements in survival over time, but also striking
disparities in survival by race/ethnicity, neighborhood SES, and
health insurance for a subset of more recently diagnosed patients.
In particular, Blacks (regardless of disease stage) and Hispanics
with late-stage disease experienced worse survival than Whites. In
addition, AYAs diagnosed with early-stage disease experienced
worse survival if they also resided in lower SES neighborhoods.
Furthermore, more recently diagnosed AYAs with public health
insurance or no insurance experienced greater than a 2-fold
increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma mortality. Together, these
findings identify vulnerable subgroups of Hodgkin lymphoma
patients at higher risk for Hodgkin lymphoma mortality and
point to disparities in treatment delivery and follow-up care as
likely contributing factors.
Our previous work in outcomes for young adult Hodgkin
lymphoma patients suggested that survival disparities by race/
ethnicity or neighborhood SES may be due to variations in initial
treatment and management (4). Consistent with studies that
found initial treatment to vary by race/ethnicity (4, 7), neighbor-
hood SES (7), and health insurance (12), we also observed that
Blacks and Hispanics, AYAs residing in lower SES neighborhoods,
and AYAs with public or no insurance were more likely to receive

 chemotherapy alone as initial treatment. Our group and others
(7, 12) also found that these disparities in treatment were asso-
ciated with worse survival. Despite the survival benefits of radi-
ation, this therapy has been associated with subsequent primary
malignancies (6, 7, 21), an outcome that we were able to consider
in our analyses. Specifically, we found that a somewhat higher
proportion of patients who received radiation for their Hodgkin
lymphoma had subsequent cancer (4.9% vs. 6.9%), which was
associated with worse overall survival (data not shown); modern
treatments with lower doses of radiation (7) may result in fewer
subsequent cancers (21) and should continue to be monitored.
However, even after controlling for initial treatment and subse-
quent cancers, we still observed differences in survival by race/
ethnicity, neighborhood SES, and health insurance, suggesting
that other factors are influencing these associations.
Expanding on a prior study that found AYA Hodgkin lympho-
ma patients who were uninsured or had public health insurance
were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage Hodgkin
lymphoma (11), we found that AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients
with these types of insurance experienced worse Hodgkin lym-
phoma–specific survival, whether they had early- or late-stage
disease. In studies of AYA cancer survivors, health insurance rates
have been found to decrease with time from diagnosis (22, 23),
particularly for older AYAs and those with less education (23), and
a lack of health insurance is a barrier to receiving any medical care
(22, 24). Furthermore, more than two thirds of uninsured survi-
vors have been found to have no personal provider or routine
medical care and, even with health insurance, AYA cancer survi-
vors are more likely to forgo medical care due to costs (24).
Collectively, these results suggest that health insurance is a critical
barrier to receiving cancer-related medical care that can impact
prognosis. Although the implementation of the measures from
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 and
2014 (25, 26) should improve AYA cancer survivors' access to
health insurance, studies should continue to monitor barriers to
health insurance enrollment and medical care in AYAs.
Our findings of worse survival among Blacks and Hispanics
and AYAs with Hodgkin lymphoma residing in lower SES
neighborhoods are consistent with those of prior studies
(4, 7). We observed some differences by stage at diagnosis:
the impact of neighborhood SES was stronger for early-stage
disease and Hispanics with late-stage disease experienced worse
Hodgkin lymphoma survival. Although we did not have health
insurance information for AYAs throughout our study period, it
is likely that factors beyond health insurance are influencing
these race/ethnicity and neighborhood SES associations. Inad-
equate long-term follow-up in patients could result in a delay
in diagnosing and treating complications (27), particularly for
AYAs, who tend to lack knowledge about their higher risk for
developing complications (28–30). Financial concerns, includ-
ing lost wages, co-payments, high deductibles, childcare, and
transportation costs (24, 31–33) can be burdensome and
influence follow-up care, particularly for AYAs with financial
limitations (e.g., debt from college or starting a career). In
addition, if poor health behaviors and comorbid conditions are
more prevalent in lower SES and/or non-White Hodgkin lym-
phoma patients, as found for patients with other cancers (34–
38), these factors, too, could increase posttreatment complica-
tions and reduce survival.
Our study is subject to some limitations. We considered the first
course of treatment, but lacked details (e.g., dosing) on chemo-
therapy, radiation, and other treatment received after this period,
and there is the potential for radiation (39, 40) and chemotherapy
(40) to be underascertained; therefore, our findings could be
subject to residual confounding from incomplete treatment data
(41). Although it is possible that our findings are partially influ-
enced by indication bias (i.e., patients who received radiation
alone had more favorable disease characteristics and thus more
favorable outcomes), it is also possible that some patients
received radiation alone because they had comorbidities that
precluded use of chemotherapy. Given that combined-modality
therapy was broadly recommended by guidelines across all stages
of Hodgkin lymphoma during the study period (2, 3), the most
plausible explanation for improved survival among patients who
received radiation alone is underascertainment of chemotherapy,
particularly for patients with advanced-stage disease. We were

 unable to consider health insurance at diagnosis for patients
diagnosed before 2001, and lacked information on changes to
health insurance after initial treatment, treatment adherence, or
quality of care—factors that can influence subsequent care and
outcomes. We also were unable to determine whether patients
were undocumented and ineligible for public health insurance.
Because cancer registry data do not include potentially relevant
clinical data such as prognostic serum measures (42), Interna-
tional Prognostic Index, or prognostic tumor characteristics [e.g.,
presence of Epstein–Barr virus in tumor cells (5)], or information
on lifestyle behaviors or comorbid conditions, our analyses could
not examine the impact of these factors on survival. Our study also
lacked individual-level measures of SES to consider separately or
with our neighborhood measure. Although neighborhood and
individual SES are associated, neighborhood SES has been found
to underestimate associations observed with individual-level SES
(43). However, our multifaceted measure of neighborhood SES at
the block group-level incorporated several domains of education,
income, employment, and cost of living that capture various
elements of the socioeconomic environment that may augment
individual-level SES. Our study may also be subject to potential
misclassification of race/ethnicity, although we previously have
detected excellent overall agreement with self-reported race/eth-
nicity for Whites and Blacks, and good agreement for Hispanics
and Asians (44, 45).
Despite these limitations, this study was population-based
and included a large diverse population of AYA Hodgkin
lymphoma cancer patients who received their care across all
types of institutions, increasing the generalizability of these
findings. In addition, our study is one of the first to consider the
influence of initial combined-modality treatment and health
insurance on previously noted racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
disparities in survival among AYAs diagnosed with early- and
late-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.

 This study found that AYA Hodgkin lymphoma patients of
Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, those who resided in lower SES
neighborhoods, and those who were uninsured or publicly
insured experienced worse Hodgkin lymphoma-specific survival.
Although prior studies have noted these racial/ethnic and SES
survival disparities, our study extends these previous efforts by
considering combined-modality treatment, subsequent primary
cancers, and health insurance. With uninsurance rates historically
peaking in adolescence and young adulthood (46), AYA Hodgkin
lymphoma patients may be particularly vulnerable to failing to
receive cancer survivor-focused medical care. The ACA has the
potential to influence both access to insurance and use of neces-
sary health care for AYAs and should be evaluated in future
studies. In addition, identifying and reducing barriers to recom-
mended treatment and surveillance in these AYAs at higher risk of
mortality is essential to ameliorating these survival disparities.
