ABSTRACT
The associations between the consumption of fast foods
and asthma or allergic diseases have not been clarified.
The aim of this study was to determine whether fast
foods consumption is associated with asthma or allergic
diseases. Databases were searched up to February 2018.
Studies investigating the associations between fast foods
consumption and asthma or allergic diseases were con-
sidered eligible. Included studies were assessed for
quality using standardized critical appraisal checklists.
The quality scores were 5.33 � 1.16 in case–control
studies
and
5.69 � 1.55
in
cross-sectional
studies.
Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence inter-
val (CI) were pooled. Sixteen studies (13 cross-sectional
and 3 case–control studies) were included. The con-
sumption of fast foods was significantly related to
current asthma (aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.17–2.13 for case–
control study and aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.10–2.26 for
cross-sectional studies), severe asthma (aOR: 1.34; 95%
CI:
1.23–1.46),
asthma
ever
(aOR:
1.36;
95%
CI:
1.06–1.75),
current
wheeze
(aOR:
1.21;
95%
CI:
1.16–1.27), wheeze ever (aOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.07–2.52),
physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (odds ratio: 1.43;
95% CI: 1.05–1.95), severe eczema (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI:
1.16–1.96) and severe rhino-conjunctivitis (aOR: 1.54;
95% CI: 1.18–2.00). The consumption of hamburgers
was associated with current asthma (aOR: 1.59; 95% CI:
1.13–2.25),
severe
asthma
(aOR:
1.34;
95%
CI:
1.23–1.46), asthma ever (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.13–1.92),
severe eczema (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.16–1.96), severe
rhino-conjunctivitis (aOR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.18–2.00) and
rhino-conjunctivitis (aOR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.15–1.27). The
consumption of fast foods, especially hamburgers, ≥3
times/week, was more likely to be associated with
severe asthma and current wheeze compared with the
consumption of 1–2 times/week (both P < 0.001). In
conclusion, the consumption of fast foods, particularly
hamburgers, correlates to asthma in a dose–response
pattern, which needs to be further validated in longitu-
dinal and interventional studies.
Key words: allergy, asthma, fast food, wheeze.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases such as
eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis (pollen
fever) and rhino-conjunctivitis has drastically increased
over recent decades. These diseases have unclear
aetiology and place a significant burden on the health-
care system, as well as reducing the quality of life of
patients.
The
factors
driving
increased
prevalence
remain unclear.1,2
With adoption of westernized lifestyles, consumption
of ‘fast foods’ has increased.3 Fast foods, first popular-
ized in the 1950s in America, are typically foods sold in
restaurants or stores with preheated or precooked
ingredients and served to customers in a packaged
form for takeaway.4 Fast foods are typically calorically
dense, high in refined carbohydrates, sodium, sugar,
cholesterol, additives such as preservatives and colour-
ants, with high concentrations of saturated fat.5 Hence,
it has been hypothesized that the consumption of fast
foods may exacerbate the development and progres-
sion of asthma and allergic diseases.6 However, the
data available to date are heterogeneous, with some,
but not all studies, reporting that asthma and allergic
diseases are associated with the consumption of fast
foods.7–23
Hence, the aim of this study was to determine
whether the consumption of fast foods is related to
asthma and other allergic diseases. We further aimed
to explore the dose–response of the consumption of
fast foods to asthma/wheeze, the differential effects of

 specific types of fast foods consumption, such as ham-
burgers, carbonated soft drink and takeaway foods on
asthma/wheeze and the differential effects of fast food
consumption on asthma and wheeze in countries
according to income level.24
METHODS
This study was registered with PROSPERO, number
CRD42016035873, which was performed and reported
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(MOOSE)
guidelines.25
No
ethics
approval
was
necessary.
Search strategy and selection criteria
This study was carried out in OVID by searching data-
bases, including MEDLINE (1946 to February week
2, 2018), EMBASE (1974 to 16 February 2018) and
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL) (January 2018). Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) was used to construct the search terms,
together with keywords from related literature.26–29 The
databases were conducted by search strategy related to
fast foods, asthma/wheeze and allergic diseases and
the search criteria can be found in Appendix S1 in Sup-
plementary Information. Unpublished studies were also
investigated through searching abstracts in the data-
bases mentioned above. Reference lists of review arti-
cles were searched to identify other potentially eligible
studies. Only English articles were included and there
was no limitation on year of publication or publication
status. Studies were included if they were cohort,
cross-sectional
or
case–control
studies
exploring
whether fast food consumption was related to asthma
or other allergic diseases with available data presented
as odds ratios (OR). After exclusion of duplicates, two
researchers (C.S.W. and J.W.) reviewed the full text of
all citations with titles and abstracts that seemed to fit
the criteria for inclusion. Disagreements were solved by
a third reviewer (G.W.). The number of studies rejected
and the reasons for rejection were tracked. Funnel
plots were used to appraise risk of bias across studies
for some of the primary outcomes. The symmetry in
the funnel plots was assessed visually.
Data extraction and quality assessment
We
extracted
the
details,
where
available,
from
included studies, including author, publication year,
study design, geographical location of the study, gen-
der, age, sample size, frequency and the consumption
of different kinds of fast foods, outcomes and OR
related to these outcomes, and adjusted confounders
for these OR. aOR of outcomes with 95% confidence
interval (CI) were also extracted and the adjusted con-
founding factors were indicated. Otherwise, OR was
calculated with the number of the exposed to the non-
exposed ratio in the case group divided by the same
ratio in the control group if absent in original studies.
Two
researchers (C.S.W.
and
J.W.)
applied
the
Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale30 for case–
control and cohort studies and Cross-Sectional/Preva-
lence Study Quality Scale31 for cross-sectional studies
to assess the quality of included articles.
Definition of fast foods
Fast foods are mass-produced foods prepared and
served very quickly, with poor nutritional quality. In
general, any foods with less preparation time can be
regarded as fast foods, especially foods sold in a restau-
rant or store with preheated ingredients, and served to
the customer in a packaged form for takeout. Further-
more, fast foods typically fall into the category of foods
high in calories, total fat, saturated and trans fat, sugar,
simple carbohydrates and sodium (salt). In this study,
we did not set a pre-specified definition for fast foods.
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcomes were defined as asthma and
wheeze presented as current asthma, ever asthma,
severe asthma, current wheeze and ever wheeze. The
secondary outcomes included current rhinitis (rhinitis
past 1 year), lifetime rhinitis (rhinitis ever), rhino-con-
junctivitis, severe rhino-conjunctivitis, eczema, severe
eczema and atopy. Primary and secondary outcomes
are shown in Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Primary and secondary outcomes were treated as
dichotomous variables and presented as OR with 95%
CI. All OR with 95% CI were pooled based on study
design and outcomes. In order to avoid counting par-
ticipants more than one time, the method described by
Greenland and Longnecker32 was used if the raw data
were available. Otherwise, the pooled effects of the
consumption of fast foods on asthma and allergic dis-
eases were estimated in accordance with the method
described by Dong et al.33
If adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were indicated in the
original studies, adjusted estimates were pooled using
the generic inverse variance method. OR in each study
were converted to natural logarithms. Standard errors
(SE) from these logarithmic numbers and their corre-
sponding 95% CI were calculated. We conducted the
metan command in Stata to pool the ln OR across
studies, used random-effects model as described by
DerSimonian and Laird34 with the estimate of heteroge-
neity being taken from the Mantel–Haenszel model,
considering variation in effects due to differences in
study populations and methods, and calculated the
summary OR estimates with 95% CI.
Subgroup analyses were undertaken to assess the
dose-dependent response of the consumption of fast
foods to asthma/wheeze and other allergic diseases,
with consumption frequency of fast food described as
‘<1 time per week, occasionally and never’, ‘1–2 times
per week’ or ‘≥3 times per week’. In addition, differential
effects of consumption of specific types of fast foods
such as hamburgers, carbonated soft drink and take-
aways on asthma/wheeze were examined. Furthermore,

 effects of the consumption of fast foods on asthma/
wheeze in countries of different income level were
determined, with countries classified according to World
Bank criteria.24 Statistical analysis was conducted with
Stata 11.0 (Stata Corp. LP, College Station, TX, USA) and
a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered as significant.
RESULTS
Studies included, characteristics and quality
assessment
Figure S1 in Supplementary Information shows the
flowchart for screening studies. The primary search
strategy initially yielded 4138 citations from the OVID
system. Of these, we identified 16 studies included in
this systematic review and meta-analysis. Table 2 indi-
cates that definitions of fast foods varied across all
included studies. Table 3 shows the key characteristics
of the 16 studies included in this analysis, published
from
2001
to
2015,
including
13
cross-sectional
studies7–9,11,12,14,16–19,21,22,35
and
3
case–control
stud-
ies.13,15,20 Sample size ranged from 144 to 500 827. One
study included females only, while the remaining
included both sexes. Two studies were undertaken in
multi-centres and others were conducted in Colombia,
Canada,
Japan,
China
(Mainland
and
Taiwan),
New Zealand, India, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Sweden,
Turkey and Australia. All studies had primary or sec-
ondary outcomes relevant to this systematic review.
Three case–control studies,13,15,20 with a total sample
size of 1326, investigated the association between the
consumption of fast foods and asthma/wheeze. Four
cross-sectional studies9,17,21,35 with a total of 54 314
subjects researched the association between the con-
sumption of fast foods and asthma/wheeze. Two cross-
sectional studies8,16 (total of 23 028 participants) only
studied the consumption of fast foods and atopy and
the remaining seven cross-sectional studies7,11,12,14,18,19,22
(total of 530 678 participants) analysed the association
between both asthma/wheeze and allergy and the
consumption of fast foods. We intended to estimate
heterogeneity and find publication bias with the use of
funnel plots. However, considering the insufficient
numbers of studies, this was not performed. The
quality scores were 5.33 � 1.16 in the case–control
studies13,15,20 and 5.69 � 1.55 in the cross-sectional
studies7–9,11,12,14,16–19,21,22,35 (Tables S1 and S2 in Supple-
mentary Information).
Primary outcomes
Primary and secondary outcomes were pooled using
the
highest
category
in
fast
food
consumption
described as following. Associations between the con-
sumption of fast foods and asthma/wheeze are shown
in Figure 1. The pooled aOR from three case–con-
trol13,15,20 and six cross-sectional studies7,12,17–19,21 indi-
cated the consumption of fast foods was significantly
related to current asthma (aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.17–2.13
and aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.10–2.26, respectively). Fur-
thermore, severe asthma was associated with the con-
sumption of fast foods22 (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.23–1.46).
The consumption of fast foods was associated with
asthma ever (aOR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06–1.75) in three
cross-sectional studies.14,19,35 The consumption of fast
foods increased the risk of current wheeze in five
cross-sectional studies7,9,14,22,35 (aOR:
1.21; 95% CI:
1.16–1.27) and wheeze ever in one cross-sectional
study14 (aOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.07–2.52).
Secondary outcomes
Associations between the consumption of fast foods
with other allergic diseases are shown in Table S3 in
Supplementary Information. Fast food consumption
was significantly related to physician-diagnosed allergic
rhinitis (pollen fever)16,18 (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05–1.95),
severe eczema22 (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.16–1.96), rhino-

Subgroup analyses of primary outcomes
The effect of different levels of fast food consumption
on asthma/wheeze is shown in Table 4. The consump-
tion of fast foods 1–2 times/week was associated with
severe asthma22 (aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13) and cur-
rent wheeze11,22,35 (aOR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.11). The
consumption of fast foods ≥3 times/week was associ-
ated with asthma ever35 (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.08–1.87),
severe asthma22 (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.23–1.46) and cur-
rent wheeze11,22,35 (aOR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.16–1.28). The
consumption of fast foods ≥3 times/week was associ-
ated with an increased risk of severe asthma (aOR:
1.34; 95% CI: 1.23–1.46 vs aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13;
P < 0.001) and current wheeze (aOR: 1.22; 95% CI:
1.16–1.28 vs aOR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.11; P < 0.001) in
comparison to consumption 1–2 times/week (Fig. 2).
Analysis of the relationship between different types
of
fast
food
consumption
and
asthma/wheeze
(Table S4 in Supplementary Information) revealed that
the consumption of hamburgers was associated with
current asthma15 (aOR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.13–2.25), severe
asthma22
(aOR:
1.34;
95%
CI:
1.23–1.46),
asthma

wheeze7,11,22,35 (aOR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.16–1.28). The con-
sumption of hamburgers ≥3 times/week was associated
with an increased risk of severe asthma (aOR: 1.34;
95% CI: 1.23–1.46 vs aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13;
P < 0.001) and current wheeze (aOR: 1.22; 95% CI:
1.16–1.28 vs aOR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.11; P < 0.001) in
comparison to consumption of 1–2 times/week. In
terms of high or middle-income countries, the con-
sumption of fast foods was associated with current
asthma
in
case–control
studies13,15,20
and
cross-
sectional studies7,12,17,18 (aOR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.17–2.13
and aOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.00–2.11, respectively), severe
asthma12 (aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13) and wheeze
ever14 (aOR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.07–2.52) in high-income
populations (Table S5 in Supplementary Information).
In middle-income countries, the consumption of fast
foods was associated with current asthma21 (aOR: 2.89;
95% CI: 1.40–5.96) and current wheeze11 (aOR: 1.74;
95% CI: 1.30–2.34).
Subgroup analyses for secondary outcomes are pro-
vided as Appendix S2 in Supplementary Information.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review
and
meta-analysis
to
investigate
the
relationship
between the consumption of fast foods and asthma/
wheeze and other allergic diseases. Our study indicated
that the consumption of fast foods significantly corre-
lates with current/severe/ever asthma, current/ever
wheeze, physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis (pollen
fever), (severe) rhino-conjunctivitis and severe eczema.
In terms of different types of fast food consumption,
hamburger, but not takeaway or carbonated soft drink
intake, was associated with severe/ever asthma, current
wheeze,
(severe)
rhino-conjunctivitis
and
severe
eczema. Furthermore, we determined that the con-
sumption of fast food, especially hamburgers, corre-
lates to severe/current asthma in a dose–response
pattern. In addition, these relationships exist in both
high- or middle-income populations.
In recent decades, fast foods have become an impor-
tant component of the diet, especially in westernized,
high-income countries. Fast foods consumption is
associated with poor diet quality, high caloric intake,
overweight
and
obesity
in
children
and
adolescents.29,36–40 Overweight–obesity is an indepen-
dent risk for asthma and allergic sensitization. After
performing the sensitivity analyses for included studies
with adjustment for BMI, we found that the positive
association between the consumption of fast foods and
current asthma (aOR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.48–1.52), ever
asthma (aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.7–1.69) and current

 wheeze (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.63–1.83) disappeared,
while the association between the consumption of fast
foods and current asthma (case–control design) (aOR:
1.58; 95% CI: 1.17–2.13) and ever wheeze (aOR: 1.65;
95%
CI:
1.07–2.52)
remained,
which
would
be
explained by BMI as a confounder or a reduced small
sample size. It indicated that as one of the indispens-
able confounders, BMI might mediate the association
between the consumption of fast foods and asthma.41
Furthermore, the poor quality diet that develops when
fast foods are regularly included in the diet introduces
nutrient deficits that are likely to independently con-
tribute to asthma development and progression.42
Poor quality diet is likely to contribute to the devel-
opment and progression of asthma/wheeze via multi-
ple mechanisms. For example, saturated fatty acids can
activate toll-like receptors (TLR), leading to release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and
Nuclear
factor
(NF)-κB-mediated
innate
immune
responses which can contribute to chronic inflamma-
tory diseases of the airways.13,43–45 Indeed, our previous
study43 provided evidence that a high-fat meal exacer-
bates airway inflammation in asthma, with increased
airway neutrophilia and TLR4 expression in induced
sputum. In addition, the consumption of fast foods
reduces the consumption of foods that are rich in pro-
tective nutrients, such as fruits and vegetables. Fruit
and vegetables contain many phytochemicals that have
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Hence
a reduction in fruit and vegetable intake is likely to
have an unfavourable impact on asthma prevalence/
management.46 Indeed, we have previously shown that
consumption of a low fruit and vegetable diet leads to
a reduced risk of exacerbation in adults with asthma.47
Hence, the associations that we have seen between the
consumption of fast foods and asthma/wheeze are bio-
logically plausible.
Our analysis has considered the effects of the quality
and heterogeneity of included studies. Given the rela-
tively high heterogeneity and bias, evidence from cross-
sectional or case–control studies was graded as low
quality. Study design of the cross-sectional and case–
control studies included in this meta-analysis, based on
questionnaire surveys and self-report, can lead to recall
bias and information bias giving rise to misclassification.
This may weaken the quality of evidence and, thus,
causal association between the consumption of fast
foods and asthma/wheeze and other allergic diseases
cannot be confirmed. In terms of the quality of the
included studies, intriguingly, our subgroup analyses
from relative high-quality studies confirmed these asso-
ciations except for current asthma. Furthermore, the
heterogeneity in the included studies is due to potential
confounding factors such as age, gender, exercise, televi-
sion viewing, maternal education, current smoking,
environmental tobacco smoke in the dwelling, gross
national income, current urban residency, indoor paint-
ing, new floor materials, region, language, parental
atopy, exercise, parental asthma/allergy rural childhood
and number of siblings (Table 3). When these con-
founding factors were adjusted, the heterogeneity was
significantly reduced.7,9,12,14,16–19,21,22,35 Our sensitivity ana-
lyses with regards to studies adjusting for less than two
common confounders including BMI, the state of social

parental allergy, indicated that these confounders might
modify the associations of consumption of fast foods
with current asthma (aOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.72–1.98) and
current wheeze (aOR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.18–3.39). However,
the statistical approaches used were not consistent
enough to make definitive conclusions about the effect
of each of these variables. In addition, eliminating the
study by Ellwood et al.,22 which has a large sample size,
did not change the associations observed, except for
current wheeze.
This analysis is limited by the lack of standard defini-
tion for fast foods in the included studies,48 although a
formal survey questionnaire was designed in most of
included studies and investigators asked subjects to
answer the detailed questions on fast food intake. Vari-
ation in the definition of fast foods would contribute to
the heterogeneity across included studies. Therefore,
we only explored the initial relationship between the
consumption of fast foods and asthma. Another limita-
tion is the deficiency of temporal data, a characteristic
of cross-sectional studies, which makes it impossible to
demonstrate a causal effect of the consumption of fast
foods on study outcomes. Furthermore, although the
difference in dietary habits of adults versus children
may exist, the association between the consumption of
fast foods and diseases was not analysed by age group.
In addition, the definitions of asthma/wheeze and
other allergic diseases, as primary and secondary out-
comes in included studies, were somewhat different,

 and in some cases, lacking objective measures. Finally,
confounders such as BMI, SES, URB, smoking and
parental allergy might modify the associations between
the consumption of fast foods and asthma and allergic
diseases, thus influencing our results.
While the current study has some limitations as
described above, bias has been reduced by our analysis
strategy. First, all OR with 95% CI in primary and sec-
ondary outcomes were separately pooled based on
study design. Second, aOR were used to reduce the
effects of confounding factors on outcomes. Third, we
have strengthened our observations by demonstrating
a dose-dependent response of the consumption of fast
foods on asthma/wheeze. Fourth, subgroup analysis
was undertaken to consider the effects of different
types of fast foods consumption, including hamburgers,
carbonated soft drinks, takeaways and deep-frying.
Fifth, although the definitions of asthma and other
allergic diseases are subjective, the repeatability and
predictive validity have previously been demonstrated.
Parameter estimates (95% CI) of specificity and sensi-
tivity between response to questionnaires and physi-
cian diagnosis of current asthma were 0.97 (0.90, 0.99)
and 0.80 (0.58, 0.93) for adult, 0.81(0.76, 0.86) and 0.85
(0.73,
0.93)
for
children.49,50
Lastly,
results
were
reported based on the highest fast food consumption
frequency, which gave rise to possibly overstating the
association between the consumption of fast foods and
asthma/allergic
diseases.
Nevertheless,
it
can
be
explained by the extent of exposure in terms of a dose–
response effect.
In conclusion, our study, for the first time, has system-
atically assessed the relationship between the consump-
tion of fast foods and asthma/wheeze and other allergic
diseases. It has demonstrated that the consumption of
fast foods, in particular hamburgers, correlates to
asthma in a dose–response manner. Relationships
between the consumption of fast foods and asthma/
wheeze exist in high- or middle-income populations.
Given the quality of studies included, further longitudi-
nal cohort and intervention studies are needed to con-
firm these relationships and identify causal associations
between the consumption of fast foods and asthma/
wheeze and other allergic diseases, which could in some
degree explain the increasing prevalence of these dis-
eases and offer a potential intervention strategy.
