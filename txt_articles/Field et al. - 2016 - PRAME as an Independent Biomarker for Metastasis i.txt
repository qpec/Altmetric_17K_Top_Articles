Abstract
Purpose: Uveal melanoma (UM) can be classified by gene
expression profiling (GEP) into Class 1 (low metastatic risk) and
Class 2 (high metastatic risk), the latter being strongly associated
with mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor BAP1.
Nevertheless, a small percentage of Class 1 tumors give rise to
metastatic disease. The purpose of this study was to identify
biomarkers of metastasis in Class 1 tumors.
Experimental Design: A total of 389 consecutive patients with
UM were assigned to Class 1 or Class 2 using a prospectively
validated 12-gene prognostic classifier. Selected tumors were further
analyzed using global GEP and single nucleotide polymorphism
microarrays. PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melano-
ma) mRNA expression was analyzed in 64 Class 1 tumors by qPCR.
Results: Among Class 1 UMs, the most significant predictor of
metastasis was PRAME mRNA expression (P ¼ 0.0006). The 5-
year actuarial rate of metastasis was 0% for Class1PRAME�, 38% for
Class1PRAMEþ, and 71% for Class 2 tumors. Median metastasis-
free survival for Class1PRAMEþ patients was 88 months, compared
to 32 months for Class 2 patients. Findings were validated using
three independent datasets, including one using disomy 3 to
identify low-risk UM. Chromosome copy number changes asso-
ciated with Class1PRAMEþ tumors included gain of 1q, 6p, 8q, and
9q and loss of 6q and 11q. PRAME expression was associated
with larger tumor diameter (P ¼ 0.05) and SF3B1 mutations
(P ¼ 0.003).
Conclusions: PRAME is an independent prognostic biomarker
in UM, which identifies increased metastatic risk in patients with
Class 1 or disomy 3 tumors. This finding may further enhance
the accuracy of prognostic testing and precision medicine for UM.

Introduction
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary cancer of
the eye and has a propensity for fatal hematogenous metastasis to
theliver(1).The molecularlandscapeofprimary UMhas beenwell
characterized (2). UMs can be categorized by gene expression
profiling (GEP) into two molecular classes associated with meta-
static risk: Class1 (low metastatic risk)andClass 2 (high metastatic
risk; ref. 3). Class 1 tumors retain a differentiated melanocytic
phenotype and transcriptome, whereas Class 2 tumors have a de-
differentiated phenotype and stem cell-like transcriptome (4). The
Class 2 signature is strongly associated with mutations in BAP1 on
chromosome 3p21, usually accompanied by loss of the other copy
of chromosome 3, consistent with the "two hit" model of tumor
suppressor gene inactivation (5, 6). Four other frequently mutated
genes havebeenidentifiedinUM.Hemizygous mutationsintheG-
protein subunits GNAQ and GNA11 are early or initiating events in
UM (7–9). GNAQ and GNA11 mutations are mutually exclusive,
and one or the other is found in �83% of UMs (9). Hemizygous
mutations in SF3B1 and EIF1AX are virtually mutually exclusive
with each other, and with BAP1 mutations, and they have been
linked to good prognosis (10, 11).
GEP-based assignment of UMs to Class 1 or Class 2 with a 12-
gene expression classifier has been validated in a prospective,
multicenter study and is now routinely performed for clinical use
in many centers (12, 13). Although the vast majority of UM
metastases occur in patients with Class 2 tumors, a small propor-
tion of Class 1 tumors also give rise to metastasis. Based on a
retrospective analysis of expression data from the 12-gene clas-
sifier on Class 1 tumors that metastasized, a subgrouping of
Class 1 tumors into "1A" and "1B" based on the expression of
two of these genes (CDH1 and RAB31) has been used as a
provisional indicator of Class 1 patients who may be at increased
risk of metastasis (14). Class 1A tumors have low CDH1/RAB31
expression, and Class 1B tumors have high CDH1/RAB31 expres-
sion. To identify additional and potentially more accurate bio-
markers for metastasis in Class 1 tumors, we conducted a genome-
wide integrated transcriptomic and chromosomal analysis in our
cohort of Class 1 tumors. We identified the cancer-testis antigen
PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) as a
biomarker for increased metastatic risk in Class 1 tumors. This
finding has important implications for precision management in
patients with UM and may aid in the stratification of patients for
clinical trials.

 Miami. Tumor samples were obtained at enucleation or by fine
needle biopsy between November 1998 and May 2015 from
patients with UMs arising from the ciliary body and/or choroid.
Samples were snap frozen and stored at �80�C. Baseline clinical
information, metastatic status, and final outcome were recorded
for each patient. Prognostic molecular class assignments (Class 1
or Class 2) were obtained using a prospectively validated 12-gene
classifier as previously reported (13). Mutation status for GNAQ,
GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX were obtained by Sanger
sequencing as previously described (5, 7, 10, 11). Tumor samples
from Leiden University were obtained between 1999 and 2008 by
enucleation and clinical and histopathologic features were
retrieved from patient charts and histology reports. Data on
survival were obtained from medical records and the Integral
Cancer Center West, which updates patient follow-up informa-
tion, including date and cause of death, on a yearly basis. Under
Dutch law, tumor material may be used for research purposes, and
patients signed an informed consent for genetic testing. The tenets
of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed in all studies.
RNA expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated using TRizol and the Qiagen RNeasy
Kit. RNA quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
RNA from enucleated samples was hybridized to Illumina Human
HT12v4 BeadChip arrays, and resulting data have been deposited
in the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (15) and are accessible
through GEO Series accession number GSE73652. Raw data were
normalized by cubic spline using Illumina GenomeStudio. Sig-
nificance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM version 4.0) was used to
generate a ranked list of differentially expressed genes based on
false discovery rate and fold change (16). Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA version 2.0.4) was used to identify significantly
enriched functional gene sets (17). Differentially upregulated and
downregulated genes from SAM were input into GSEA and
analyzed using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to
identify chromosomal position and transcription factor target
gene sets. A circular plot of gene expression data was generated
using the Perl-based Circos graphical program (18). Expression
data of specific chromosomal regions were plotted using the R
package GViz. Principal component analysis (PCA) and three-
dimensional (3D) visualization using the 12-gene expression
classifier were performed using Partek Genomics Suite. Unsuper-
vised PCA and 3D visualization using global transcriptomic data
were performed on the top 20% most variable genes across all
samples using the stats and rgl packages in R.
PRAME mRNA expression was analyzed using real-time quan-
titative PCR (qPCR). RNA was converted to cDNA using the
Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit, and gene expression was quantified using the Applied Bio-
systems 7900HT Real-Time PCR System with TaqMan primers
and Gene Expression Master Mix following the manufacturer's
protocol. The control genes for the 12-gene expression classifier
(MRPS21, RBM23, and SAP130) were included. TaqMan primers
were Hs01022301_m1 (PRAME), Hs00230458_m1 (MRPS21),
Hs00216503_m1 (RBM23), and Hs00368617_m1 (SAP130). Ct
values were calculated using the manufacturer's software, and
mean Ct values were calculated for all triplicate sets. DCt values
were calculated by subtracting the mean Ct of each discriminating
gene from the geometric mean of the mean Ct values of the three
endogenous control genes, as previously described (19).
For Kaplan–Meier actuarial analysis, PRAME mRNA expression
data were scaled from 0 to 1 and plotted from lowest to highest
expression. A Loess model was constructed to represent the best fit
of the data (second degree, span ¼ 0.5, family ¼ Gaussian, fitting
by least-squares), and the differences in predicted values of the
Loess model were plotted to estimate slope change (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1A). Samples with minimal differences (blue dots) were
coded as PRAME�, whereas those with significant differences (red
dots) were coded as PRAMEþ.
For validation, three independent gene expression datasets and
associated clinical annotations were analyzed. Two of these
datasets were obtained from GEO (15), and tumor samples were
stratified into Class 1 or Class 2 based on the 12-genes in the UM
classifier. Dataset #GSE22138 was performed on the Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform and dataset
#GSE44295 was performed on the Illumina Ref8 platform. These
datasets consisted of 20 Class1PRAME� and 31 Class1PRAMEþ
tumors. The third dataset contained 25 tumors classified as low
risk based on disomy 3, which is significantly associated with the
Class 1 signature (6, 13), and was performed at Leiden University
on the Illumina Human HT12v4 BeadChip Array platform. For
these additional datasets, PRAMEgene expression was scaled from
0 to 1 for all samples and categorized as PRAMEþ or PRAME�, as
described above.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PRAME was performed
with the SIGMA Prestige anti-PRAME antibody (HPA045153) at
4 mg/mL on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides
using the VECTASTAIN UNIVERSAL Elite ABC Kit (Vector Labo-
ratories, PK-6200) and the ImmPACT SG Peroxidase Substrate Kit
(Vector Laboratories, SK-4705) according to the manufacturer's
recommendation, with the following changes. Primary antibody
was incubated overnight at 4oC with addition of 0.3% Triton
X-100. Antigen retrieval was performed in sodium citrate buffer
(10 mmol/L, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) in an autoclave at 121�C
for 10 minutes. Slides were slowly cooled down to 80�C for 25
minutes, and additionally for 10 minutes at room temperature.
The blocking step was changed to 1 hour. Incubation with
secondary antibody was increased to 1 hour with addition of
0.1% Triton X-100. Incubation with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC
Translational Relevance
Uveal melanoma (UM) can be stratified into Class 1 (low
metastatic risk) and Class 2 (high metastatic risk) using a
prospectively validated 12-gene expression profile. Although
the vast majority of metastases occur in Class 2 tumors, a small
percentage of Class 1 tumors also metastasize. This study
revealed that metastasis in Class 1 tumors is strongly associ-
ated with expression of the PRAME oncogene. This finding was
validated in three independent datasets, including one using
disomy 3 as a surrogate marker for low risk UM. Adding
PRAME to the 12-gene expression classifier will likely enhance
its prognostic accuracy by identifying Class 1 tumors with
intermediate metastatic risk. Some cancers expressing PRAME
have been shown to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, sug-
gesting that immunotherapy may have a role in the precision
management of patients with PRAMEþ UM.

 reagent was increased to 1 hour. ImmPACT SG reagent was
applied for 20 minutes, with changing to fresh substrate after 7
and 14 minutes. Nuclear fast red counter-stain (Vector Labora-
tories, H-3403) was applied for 10 minutes. Negative controls
included tumors known to be lacking PRAME mRNA expression
and samples tested with secondary antibody only. Two indepen-
dent investigators assessed the IHC slides for PRAME nuclear
staining in a blinded manner. Samples were graded by the
percentage of cells demonstrating nuclear staining. The scores
from the independent graders were averaged.
Chromosome copy number analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Kit. For
the Class1metþ samples, loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 3
was determined using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
assay as previously described (20). For PRAMEþ and PRAME-
samples, SNP analysis was performed using the Affymetrix
Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 array and data were analyzed for
copy number gains and losses as described in the Affymetrix
Genotyping Console software user manual and then plotted with
Integrative Genomics Viewer. For the Leiden dataset, monosomy
3 was determined using Affymetrix 250K_SNP and Cytoscan HD
microarrays as previously described with a cut-off value of <1.9 for
chromosomal loss (6).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was determined using Medcalc version
14.10.2. Statistical
significance was
determined using
the
Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables, Fisher exact test for
discrete variables, Cox proportional hazards regression for eval-
uation of prognostic factors for survival, Spearman rank correla-
tion coefficient for comparison of continuous nonparametric
data, and Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test and right
censoring for comparing survival between groups.
Results
Clinical characteristics of metastasizing Class 1 UMs
Our study design is summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Among 389 consecutive patients with UM involving the ciliary
body and/or choroid who underwent GEP prognostic testing, the
molecular class assignment was Class 1 in 216 (56%) patients and
Class 2 in 173 (44%) patients. Class 2 GEP was associated with
markedly greater metastatic risk than Class 1 GEP, with metastatic
disease being detected in 12/216 (6%) Class 1 cases versus 63/173
(36%) Class 2 cases (log rank test, P < 0.0001; Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
We wished to determine whether any clinicopathologic
features differed between Class 1 tumors with metastasis
(Class1metþ) and Class 2 tumors with metastasis (Class2metþ).
Class2met� tumors were not included in this analysis because the
high metastatic rate and limited follow-up in some cases would
have led to the erroneous inclusion of tumors that would later
metastasize. Pairwise comparisons of clinicopathologic features
are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. Detailed clinico-
pathologic and molecular features of all the Class1metþ tumors are
summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Among 52 patients in
whom metastasis was detected and the sites of metastasis were
available, the liver was affected in 6/12 (50%) patients with a
Class1metþ tumor compared to 36/40 (90%) patients with a
Class2metþ tumor (Fisher exact test, P ¼ 0.02). Other metastatic
sites in Class 1 tumors included lung in 4, bone in 3, and stomach
in 2 cases. Compared to Class2metþ tumors, Class1metþ tumors
were associated with younger patient age and less frequent ciliary
body involvement (Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.04 and 0.02,
respectively).
Similarly, we compared the characteristics of the Class 1 tumors
with and without metastatic disease. Pairwise comparisons of
clinicopathologic features are summarized in Supplementary
Table
S2.
There
were
no
significant
differences
between
Class1metþ and Class1met� tumors with regard to age, sex, tumor
diameter or thickness, ciliary body involvement, or cell type. For
Class1metþ tumors, mutations were identified in BAP1 in none of
eight, EIF1AX in none of six, GNAQ in five of eight, GNA11 in one
of seven, and SF3B1 in four of eight samples in which DNA was
still available for sequencing (Supplementary Table S3).
Comparison of gene expression profiles among Class 1 tumors
Among the five known UM driver mutations, SF3B1 mutations
were most strongly associated with Class 1 metastasis, but because
these mutations were only present in 50% of metastatic cases, it is
not an adequate biomarker for Class 1 metastasis. Thus, we turned
to transcriptomic profiling. Initially, we analyzed 108 Class 1
tumors by PCA using the mRNA expression of genes from the
12-gene classifier. PCA organized the samples into two clusters
corresponding to their metastatic status (Supplementary Fig.
S1C), indicating that there were potentially meaningful trans-
criptomic differences between Class1metþ and Class1met� tumors.
To identify genes that were differentially expressed between
Class1metþ and Class1met� tumors, we performed a genome-wide
transcriptomic analysis of five Class1metþ tumors and eight
Class1met� tumors with at least 1 year of follow-up using the
Illumina Human HT12v4 Expression BeadChip array. Using SAM,
differentially expressed genes were identified at a significance level
of FDR <0.01 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S4). Using
unsupervised PCA, tumor samples once again clustered into two
distinct groups that corresponded to their metastatic status, with
no overlap in their 95% confidence ellipsoids (Fig. 1B). By far, the
most highly overexpressed gene in Class1metþ tumors was PRAME
(Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 1C–D).
We then analyzed PRAME expression by qPCR in 26 Class 1
tumors, 7 with metastasis and 19 without metastasis with even
longer follow-up of >3 years. These samples included 17 that were
not previously analyzed. Consistent with the array data, 16/19
(84%) Class1met� tumors showed minimal PRAME expression
(Class1PRAME�), whereas 7/7 (100%) of Class1metþ tumors
showed elevated PRAME expression (Class1PRAMEþ, Mann–Whit-
ney test, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1E). We performed IHC for PRAME
protein on 6 of the Class 1 tumors in which original FFPE blocks
were still available, and as expected, PRAME mRNA expression
correlated with nuclear protein expression (Fig. 1F and Supple-
mentary Fig. S1D). There was no significant association between
PRAME expression status and the currently used Class "1A/1B"
designation (Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.5; Fig. 1G). However,
among Class 1 tumors in which both PRAME and 1A/1B data were
available, all six Class 1 tumors that metastasized were PRAMEþ
and Class 1B.
To obtain a more accurate assessment of the prevalence of
PRAME-expressing Class 1 tumors, and to obtain actuarial esti-
mates of metastatic risk associated with PRAME expression in
Class 1 tumors, we performed qPCR on an additional 38 samples,
for a total of 64 Class 1 tumors analyzed by qPCR. The overall

 metastatic events occurred among Class1PRAME� cases (Fig. 2A).
The 5-year actuarial probability of metastasis was 15% for Class 1
tumors overall, 0% for Class1PRAME� tumors and 38% for
Class1PRAMEþ tumors, compared to 71% for Class 2 tumors. The
median metastasis-free survival for patients with Class1PRAMEþ
tumors was 88 months, compared to 32 months for Class 2
tumors. PRAME expression showed a significant association with
larger basal tumor diameter (Spearman correlation, P ¼ 0.04) and
with SF3B1 mutations (Mann–Whitney test, P ¼ 0.003; Supple-
mentary Fig. S1E).
To further validate the association of high PRAME levels with
metastasis, we combined two independent published datasets
with long follow-up (GSE22138 and GSE44295), which included
20 Class1PRAME� and 31 Class1PRAMEþ cases (median follow-up
68.0 months, mean 80.4 months, interquartile range 41.4–101.5
months). By Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, PRAME expression
was significantly associated with metastasis (log rank test, P ¼
0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1F). The 5-year actuarial probability of
metastasis was very similar to our dataset: 21% for Class 1 tumors
overall, 5% for Class1PRAME� tumors, and 31% for Class1PRAMEþ
tumors.
We analyzed a third dataset with long follow-up from Leiden
University that defined low risk UM by the presence of disomy
3. This dataset of 64 cases included 16 Disomy3PRAME� tumors
and 9 Disomy3PRAMEþ tumors, with a median follow-up of
121.0 months (mean, 107.7 months; interquartile range, 85.0–
138.0 months) and 76.0 months (mean, 83.8 months; inter-
quartile range, 72.0–109.0 months), respectively. Comparable
to the other datasets, PRAME expression in these tumors was
associated with increased metastatic risk (log rank test, P ¼
0.02; Fig. 2B). Similar to our previous findings, PRAME expres-
sion in these tumors was associated with larger basal tumor
diameter (P ¼ 0.001).
Functional analysis of the Class1PRAMEþ transcriptome
Genes that were differentially expressed between Class1PRAME�
and Class1PRAMEþ tumors were analyzed for chromosomal loca-
tion, biologic function, and transcription factor binding sites
using GSEA and MSigDB to gain insights into tumor biology.
Genes that were upregulated in Class1PRAMEþ tumors showed a
significant enrichment in chromosomal location at 1q21, 1q42,
6p21-22, and 8q24, whereas downregulated genes showed
enrichment across most of chromosome 6q (FDR < 0.01 for all;
Supplementary Table S5). At FDR ¼ 0.02, enrichment of down-
regulated genes was also observed at 11q23-24.
Genes that were upregulated in Class1PRAMEþ tumors were
also enriched for biologic functions related to chromosome
maintenance, DNA replication, and base excision repair (FDR
� 0.2 for all; Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S6). Analysis of
genes upregulated in Class1PRAMEþ tumors for transcription
factor binding sites within the promoter region (�2 kb of the
transcription start site) showed enrichment for two known
transcription factors: NFY and SP1 (FDR < 0.01 for both;
Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, PRAME associates with
NFY at its CCAAT binding site in promoter regions to induce
transcriptional activation (21), and many of the upregulated
genes with NFY sites in their promoters were located within
regions of chromosomal gain on 1q and 6p in Class1PRAMEþ
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Chromosomal alterations in Class1PRAMEþ tumors
The correlation between mRNA expression of PRAME and of
genes involved in chromosome maintenance suggested that
Class1PRAMEþ tumors may demonstrate increased chromosomal
gains and losses relative to Class1PRAME� tumors. To test this
hypothesis, we used high-density Affymetrix Genome-Wide
Human SNP 6.0 arrays to analyze nine Class1PRAMEþ tumors (six
with
metastasis
and
three
without
metastasis)
and
four
Class1PRAME� tumors (all without metastasis). Indeed, there was
a correlation between PRAME expression and specific chromo-
somal gains and losses, even in this limited set of cases (Fig. 3B).
Consistent with our transcriptomic analysis (Supplementary
Table S5), the most common chromosome copy number changes
specific to Class1PRAMEþ tumors included 1q gain (five cases, all
with metastasis), 6p gain with 6q loss (five cases, all with metas-
tasis), and 8q gain (eight cases, six with metastasis and two
without metastasis). Less common but potentially important
changes that were specific to Class1PRAMEþ tumors included 9q
gain (three cases, all with metastasis) and 11q loss (four cases,
three with metastasis and one without metastasis). 6p gain was
only specific to Class1PRAMEþ tumors when accompanied by 6q
loss, consistent with isochromosome 6p (22). In the Leiden
dataset, gain or amplification of 8q was observed in 6/16
Disomy3PRAME� and in 8/9 Disomy3PRAMEþ tumors (Fisher exact

show a significant difference between Disomy3PRAME� and
Disomy3PRAMEþ tumors (data not shown), 8/9 Disomy3PRAMEþ
tumors displayed a gain of 6p. We elected not to pursue further
chromosomal analyses because PRAME met our objective for this
study, which was to identify a strong biomarker for Class 1
metastasis.
Discussion
The clinical and molecular features associated with metastasis
in Class 1 tumors were clearly distinct from those associated with
metastasis in Class 2 tumors. Class 1 UMs that metastasized
tended to occur in younger patients, less frequently involved the
ciliary body, less frequently metastasized to the liver, lacked BAP1
mutations, frequently had SF3B1 mutations, and exhibited a
distinct GEP. The transcriptomes of Class 1 and Class 2 tumors
were so dramatically different that the comparatively subtle
differences between Class1met� and Class1metþ were masked until
Class 2 tumors were first removed from the analysis. When this
was done, however, the gene expression differences between these
Class 1 subgroups were clearly evident, and PRAME was the single
most differentially expressed gene that distinguished Class 1
tumors based on their metastatic status. When we expanded the
analysis to a larger number of tumor samples and stratified the
tumors based on the presence or absence of PRAME expression
measured by qPCR, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis confirmed the
strong association of PRAME with metastasis in Class 1 tumors.
This finding was validated in three independent datasets, includ-
ing one that used disomy 3 to define "low risk" UM. As expected,
we also found that PRAME mRNA expression correlated with
PRAME nuclear protein expression by IHC. A rigorous analysis of
PRAME IHC staining was beyond the scope of this study but needs
to be performed in a large number of FFPE samples to confirm
whether this has similar prognostic value as PRAME mRNA
expression.
The 12-gene classifier is a prospectively validated clinical prog-
nostic test for UM (13), and we anticipate that the addition of
PRAME will further enhance the classifier's accuracy. There was no
significant correlation between PRAME status and the provisional
"1A/1B" system that the classifier currently uses. As such, we are
initiating a multicenter study to compare these two predictors,
and we anticipate that PRAME will likely be the more accurate
biomarker for metastasis in Class 1 UMs because it was identified
in an unsupervised manner from a global genomic analysis and
was independently validated.

 PRAME was initially discovered as a tumor antigen recog-
nized by cytolytic T cells in cutaneous melanoma (23). PRAME
expression is a marker of poor clinical outcome in a variety of
cancers (24), and PRAME mRNA expression was recently found
to be an important biomarker for differentiating benign nevi
from malignant melanoma of the skin (25). PRAME may
promote tumor progression, at least in part, by inhibiting
differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis induced by reti-
noic acid signaling (26). PRAME binds the retinoic acid recep-
tor (RAR) and recruits EZH2 to form a heterotrimeric complex
that represses transcription of genes containing RAR binding
sites. Consistent with the possibility that PRAME may inhibit
retinoic acid signaling in Class1PRAMEþ tumors, we found that
16% of genes downregulated in Class1PRAMEþ tumors had a
retinoic acid response element within �10 Kb of the transcrip-
tion start site or gene end, including RARB itself (FDR � 0.05;
Supplementary Table S5). The cooperation between PRAME,
RAR, and EZH2 suggests a potential therapeutic role for EZH2
inhibitors in patients with metastatic Class 1 tumors (27),
particularly because EZH2 has been shown to repress immune
signaling in UM cells (28). In addition, combination therapy
with retinoic acid and an HDAC inhibitor may have therapeutic
benefit by synergistically inhibiting PRAME to induce differen-
tiation and cell-cycle exit (29). Interestingly, UM cells treated
with retinoic acid become sensitive to killing by cytolytic T cells
and NK cells (30), suggesting a potential role for immunother-
apy in Class 1 metastasis. Vaccines against PRAME in cutaneous
melanoma and other cancers are currently in clinical trials (trial
nos. NCT01149343 and NCT01853878), and other immu-
notherapies directed against PRAME-expressing cancers are in
development (31).
PRAME also associates with the transcription factor NFY at
transcriptionally active promoters and enhancers containing
the NFY binding motif CCAAT (21). NFY is a highly con-
served, sequence-specific, nucleosome-like, trimeric complex
that interacts with DNA in a sequence-specific manner (32).
Although PRAME does not directly bind to NFY, its associa-
tion at the NFY CCAAT binding motif is required for NFY-
mediated transcriptional activation, whereas lack of PRAME is
associated with repression (21). Intriguingly, many of the
genes that were upregulated in Class1PRAMEþ tumors contain
NFY sites in their promoter and are located within the regions
of 1q and 6p gain in Class1PRAMEþ tumors. Furthermore, many
of these genes play a role in meiotic recombination, telomere
and chromosome maintenance, DNA replication, and base
excision repair, all of which have been implicated in chro-
mosomal instability (33). Moreover, NFYA, the component of
the NFY trimeric complex that contains the CCAAT DNA-
binding motif, is also located on 6p, and is significantly
upregulated (FDR < 0.05). These findings suggest that PRAME
upregulation may cooperate with copy number gains on 1q
and 6p to facilitate chromosomal instability associated with
tumor progression (Fig. 4).
Mutations in SF3B1 and EIF1AX are associated with Class 1
GEP and have been reported to be good prognostic factors in
UM, whereas BAP1 mutations are associated with Class 2 GEP
and poor prognosis (10, 11). Although this study affirms that
SF3B1 mutations are associated with better prognosis than
BAP1 mutations, we found that SF3B1 mutations were associ-
ated with increased metastatic risk among Class 1 tumors,
which almost never have BAP1 mutations. Similarly, another
group recently reported that patients with disomy 3 have a
Figure 4.
Molecular hypothesis of tumor
progression in UM, highlighting the
role of PRAME reported herein.
Increased PRAME mRNA expression in
Class 1 UMs is associated with
transcriptional upregulation of key
genes involved in chromosome
maintenance and stability, many of
which are located on chromosome 1q
and 6p and contain regulatory
elements for transcription factors that
interact with PRAME, including the
retinoic acid receptor and NFY
complexes. These observations
suggest a possible feed-forward
mechanism in which progressively
increasing PRAME expression and
specific chromosomal gains mutually
reinforce one another to promote
Class 1 tumor progression. There was a
significant association of this pathway
with SF3B1 mutations, which were
mutually exclusive with EIF1AX
mutations, suggesting a bifurcated
pathway. This Class 1 metastatic
pathway was distinct from the more
common pathway leading to
metastasis through the bi-allelic loss
of BAP1 and acquisition of the Class 2
gene expression profile.

 worse disease-free survival when an SF3B1 mutation is present
(34). In the same way, 6p gain is a good prognostic factor
relative to Class 2 GEP (and monosomy 3), 6p gain should not
be thought of as "protective" against metastasis because it is
strongly associated with metastasis in Class 1 tumors. However,
EIF1AX mutations were not found in any of the metastasizing
Class 1 tumors and were almost always mutually exclusive with
SF3B1 and BAP1 mutations, suggesting that this mutation may
have value as a favorable prognostic factor. Larger numbers of
cases will need to be evaluated to determine the prognostic
value of these mutations.
A limitation of this study was the small number of Class1metþ
cases, but this is a reflection of the infrequency of metastasis
in Class 1 tumors. To overcome this limitation, we validated
the prognostic significance of PRAME in three independent data-
sets, which all had long (> 6 years) median follow-up data.
Furthermore, we are planning a prospective, multicenter study
to validate these findings, establish the optimal PRAME expres-
sion threshold for maximizing positive and negative predictive
value, and determine whether PRAME has prognostic value
in Class 2 tumors. It is possible that some Class1met� tumors
might have metastasized if they had been followed for a longer
period of time. Indeed, rare metastatic events can occur even
decades after primary ocular treatment (35). However, it is dif-
ficult to obtain such long-term data, and our findings are of
practical value for the vast majority of patients for whom 5-year
outcome projections are most important for personal and clinical
decision-making.
For Class 1 tumors, the inclusion of PRAME expression may
further augment the prognostic accuracy of the clinically avail-
able 12-gene classifier for UM. This finding allows patients with
UM to be stratified into Class1PRAME� (low metastatic risk),
Class1PRAMEþ (intermediate metastatic risk) and Class 2 (high
metastatic risk) for purposes of metastatic surveillance and
clinical trials of targeted adjuvant therapies.
