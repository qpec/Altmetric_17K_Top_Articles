SUMMARY
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that is
caused by the interplay of genetic, particularly the
HLA-DR15 haplotype, and environmental risk fac-
tors. How these etiologic factors contribute to
generating an autoreactive CD4+ T cell repertoire is
not clear. Here, we demonstrate that self-reactivity,
defined as ‘‘autoproliferation’’ of peripheral Th1 cells,
is elevated in patients carrying the HLA-DR15
haplotype. Autoproliferation is mediated by memory
B cells in a HLA-DR-dependent manner. Depletion of
B cells in vitro and therapeutically in vivo by anti-
CD20 effectively reduces T cell autoproliferation.
T cell
receptor deep
sequencing
showed that
in vitro autoproliferating T cells are enriched for
brain-homing T cells. Using an unbiased epitope
discovery approach, we identified RASGRP2 as
target autoantigen that is expressed in the brain
and B cells. These findings will be instrumental
to address important questions regarding patho-
genic B-T cell interactions in multiple sclerosis and
possibly also to develop novel therapies.
INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a prototypic organ-specific
autoimmune disease. It mainly affects young adults and approx-
imately 2.5 million people worldwide. Patients often develop
impairments of visual, sensory, motor, neurocognitive, and
autonomic functions. Its etiology involves a complex genetic trait
with >100 quantitative trait loci (Beecham et al., 2013; Sawcer
et al., 2011), most importantly the HLA-DR15 haplotype, for
which an association with MS has already been described in
1973 (Jersild et al., 1973). Since HLA-class II molecules restrict
CD4+ T cells, the genetic association provides a strong argument
for the central role of adaptive immunity and CD4+ T cells in MS.
Yet, how HLA-DR15 and other risk alleles induce and sustain MS
is incompletely understood including the lack of an autoantigen
unequivocally associated with MS pathogenesis. Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection, low vitamin D3, smoking, and obesity
(Olsson et al., 2017) have been identified as environmental risk
factors, and genes and environment likely act in concert to
trigger an autoimmune reaction against CNS tissue (Dendrou
et al., 2015; Sospedra and Martin, 2005).
The vast majority of MS risk-conferring genes including HLA-
DR15 are immune function related, while CNS-related genes
are remarkably absent (Beecham et al., 2013; Sawcer et al.,
2011). Considering data from the animal model of MS, experi-
mental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (Dendrou et al., 2015;
Goverman, 2009; Sospedra and Martin, 2005), there is now
compelling evidence that MS is an autoimmune disease with
dysregulated adaptive immunity at its core. Findings from EAE
and blood cells of MS patients together with the strong genetic
HLA-DR15 association hint at the importance of myelin-reactive
CD4+ T cells (Sospedra and Martin, 2005). However, character-
ization of CNS-infiltrating immune cell populations and experi-
ence from B cell-depleting therapies suggest that CD8+ T cells,
proinflammatory B cells, and autoantibodies are likely also
involved (Dendrou et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2008; Li et al.,

 2015; Sospedra and Martin, 2005). A central question is how dis-
ease-relevant T and B cells interact.
Starting from MS risk genes involved in T cell activation, differ-
entiation, and homeostasis and the prominent role of HLA-DR15,
we searched for experimental systems to approach this issue.
The observation that myelin-specific T cell clones can be acti-
vated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the absence of exog-
enous nominal antigen and the involvement of CD4, HLA-class II,
and self-peptides provided the basis for such a system (Cai and
Hafler, 2007; Kondo et al., 2001). Further, in MS reduced thymic
output of T cells (Duszczyszyn et al., 2006; Hug et al., 2003),
alterations in T regulatory cells (Carbone et al., 2014), increased
T cell proliferation and related signatures (Carbone et al., 2014;
Tuller et al., 2013), decreased autologous mixed lymhocyte
reaction (AMLR) (Hafler et al., 1985), and reduced T cell receptor
(TCR) repertoire diversity (Laplaud et al., 2004; Muraro et al.,
2005) indicate perturbed T cell homeostasis. In distinction to
the defective AMLR, which was shown to be altered not only in
MS, but also in other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis already three decades ago (Kitas et al., 1988) and which
remained unexplained, we recently showed that spontaneous
in vitro T cell proliferation is increased in MS patients (Mohme
et al., 2013). We refer to this phenomenon as ‘‘autoproliferation’’
(AP). The HLA-DR15 haplotype and DR15-presented self-
peptides take part in this process (Mohme et al., 2013), but which
cells induce and maintain T cell proliferation and whether AP
T cells may be pathogenic are unknown. Here, we characterized
in detail the cellular interactions that lead to increased AP and
provide evidence for its potential involvement in MS.
RESULTS
AP Increases during Remission
Based on the increased AP in MS patients using thymidine incor-
poration (Mohme et al., 2013), we developed a carboxyfluores-
cein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling protocol,
which allows characterization of AP (CFSEdim) and non-prolifer-
ating (CFSEhi) cell populations (Figure 1A) and correlates well
with thymidine incorporation (Figure S1A). It is important to
note that we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) without stimulus and under serum-free conditions.
With this assay, we examined AP in a first cohort of 32 healthy
donors (HDs) and 50 untreated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS,
nihil) patients (Table S1). 24.1% of AP cells were B cells
(CD19+), 43.6% T cells (CD3+), with a higher proportion of
CD4+ than CD8+ T cells, and 32.3% unknown cells (Figures
1B, 1C, S1B, and S1C). AP T cells showed an effector memory
and highly activated phenotype with strong upregulation of
surface HLA-DR with increasing cycles of division (Figures 1D
and 1E). Similar to our previous study (Mohme et al., 2013), we
confirmed a higher frequency of individuals with stronger AP in
the MS group as compared to HDs and also to two other
organ-specific autoimmune diseases, psoriasis or Crohn’s
disease (Figure 1F). Interestingly, when the AMLR was investi-
gated in psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, it also did not differ
from HDs (Davidsen and Kristensen, 1986; Schopf et al., 1986),
while it is defective in MS (Hafler et al., 1985).
Next, we explored the association between AP in HDs and
RRMS disease stages, i.e., active (relapse; REL, nihil) or inactive
(remission; REM, nihil). Interestingly, we observed higher fre-
quencies of AP cells independent of the rounds of cell division
in REM compared to HDs and REL, as well as increased fre-
quencies of AP effector memory T cells in REM compared to
HDs (Figures 1G, 1H, and S1D–S1G). We confirmed these results
in a second cohort comparing AP with other methods of B or
T cell activation in HDs and REM. In contrast to AP and a-immu-
noglobulin M (IgM) stimulation, T cell activation by a foreign recall
antigen (tetanus toxoid), allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction
(MLR) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) did not differ between HDs
and REM (Figure S2A).
HLA-DR-TCR Interactions Are Essential for AP
In line with our previous data (Mohme et al., 2013), HLA-DR15+
HDs and REM showed increased AP (Figure 1I). Further, we
now found that AP CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells are increased in
HLA-DR15+ compared to HLA-DR15� REM (Figure 1J). Given
the multifactorial etiology of MS, we genotyped REM and HDs
to examine 134 published non-HLA MS risk-associated SNPs
(Beecham et al., 2013; Sawcer et al., 2011) and compared their
effect to that of HLA-DR15 on AP. Probably due to the small
sample size, our results do not support a significant contribution
neither for single MS risk SNPs nor for a MS risk score derived
from 102 of these risk variants, yet confirmed a significant asso-
ciation between HLA-DR15 and AP (Table S2 and Table S3).

 HLA-DR15 haplotype indicated that interactions between HLA-
DR on B cells and TCR/CD4 on T cells might be involved in AP.
This was confirmed by the strong inhibitory effects of antibody
blocking of both HLA-DR as reported previously (Mohme et al.,
2013), but also of CD4 (Figure 1K). Phosphorylation of the TCR-
associated CD3 zeta chain (CD3z) and the CD3 zeta chain-asso-
ciated protein 70 (ZAP-70) in AP T cells (Figure 1L) as well as the
involvement of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK)
(Figure 1M) show that TCR and self-peptide/HLA-class II interac-
tions participate in inducing and/or sustaining AP.
Classical and Non-classical Th1 Cells Are Involved in AP
Next, we addressed which functional phenotypes are involved
in increased AP in REM. Culture supernatants after AP
contained particularly high amounts of interferon (IFN)-g,
increased interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-13, IL-21, and granulocyte-
macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(GM-CSF)
in
REM
compared to HDs and either low or absent IL-5 and IL-17 (Fig-
ure 2A). In contrast to AP, IFN-g secretion upon activation with
conventional T cell stimuli did not differ between HDs and REM
(Figure S2B). IFN-g correlated best with AP (Figure 2A) and
was higher in HLA-DR15+ individuals (Figure S2C). Cytokines
dropped after blocking either HLA-DR or CD4, whereas
in vitro neutralization of IFN-g and GM-CSF did not inhibit AP
indicating that cytokine production is a consequence of AP
(Figures 2B and S2D).
Intracellular cytokine staining confirmed that AP CD4+ T cells
mainly express IFN-g and, consistent with a Th1 phenotype,
also show STAT1 signaling (Figures 2C and 2D). The predomi-
nant proinflammatory Th1-like phenotype in AP CD4+ T cells of
REM is supported by RNA sequencing, which shows significant
upregulation of Th1-specific markers such as TBX21 (T-bet),
CXCR3, and IFNG (Figure 2E). Th2 and Th17 markers such as
GATA3, IL4 or RORC, and IL17A were absent or not differentially
expressed, but other Th17-specific markers such as AHR and
BATF as well as CSF2 (GM-CSF) were upregulated. In line with
these findings, we observed high frequencies of CXCR3+ CD4+
T cells expressing the Th17-associated chemokine receptor
CCR6 in the AP compartment (Figure 2F), referred to as non-
classical Th1 cells (i.e., Th1/Th17 or exTh17-Th1) (Geginat
et al., 2013). These cells were shown to be polyfunctional and
increased in MS (Paroni et al., 2017), and both chemokine recep-
tors, CXCR3 and CCR6, are involved in brain homing of T cells
(Balashov et al., 1999; Reboldi et al., 2009). Consistent with
in vivo results (Basdeo et al., 2017), we observed higher AP in
classical and non-classical Th1 cells (Figure 2F). Whether
expression of Th17-specific markers and GM-CSF marks a
distinct T helper cell subset (Geginat et al., 2013; Hartmann
et al., 2014) originating from Th17 cells or is part of pathogenic
Th1 differentiation is currently not clear, but our findings under-
score that IFN-g-secreting Th1-like cells are the most prominent
T cell subset in this setting.
B-T Cell Interaction via HLA-DR Promotes AP
Regarding the APCs that induce/support AP, B cells appeared
to be particularly interesting candidates, since they upregulate
HLA-DR expression (Mohme et al., 2013) and are present in sub-
stantial numbers in the AP compartment (Figures 1B and S3A)
and due to their emerging role in MS (Krumbholz et al., 2012).
Indeed, we noticed a significant correlation of B and T cell AP,
whereas other conventional stimuli shifted to B or T cell prolifer-
ation, respectively (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). AP of both B and
T cells was higher in REM and HLA-DR15+ individuals (Figures
3A and 3C). The reduced T cell AP and IFN-g secretion after
B cell depletion and physical separation of B from T cells hint
at a central role of B cells in triggering and/or sustaining T cell
AP via direct cell-cell interaction (Figure 3D). We then addressed
whether B cells activate and maintain AP CD4+ T cells more effi-
ciently in REM compared to HDs. Autologous co-cultures of
EBV-transformed B cells with expanded AP T cells of HLA-
DR15+ HDs and REM showed that AP CD4+ T cells are main-
tained and activated much more efficiently in the absence of
an exogenous stimulus in REM than in HDs (Figures S3B–S3D).
Given the strong correlation of AP B and T cells, we examined
the relationship between AP B and T cells further. AP B cells
predominantly show a memory phenotype and increased
expression of HLA-DR; i.e., they are in an activated status,
when compared to CFSEhi B cells (Figures 3E and 3F). Transfer
of autologous AP (CFSEdim) memory B cells led to strong activa-
tion and AP of CD4+ T cells in a HLA-DR-dependent manner (Fig-
ure 3G). Based on these observations, we searched for factors
that drive AP of memory B cells. Whereas AP of B cells was inde-
pendent of bystander activation via CD40 (Figure 3H), it was
almost abrogated by ibrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor (Fig-
ure 3I). Addition of ibrutinib did not alter the survival of B cells
but caused a decrease in HLA-DR expression on B cells accom-
panied by a drop of T cell AP (Figure 3I). BTK is important for
B cell receptor signaling, B cell maturation, and proliferation
but also other pathways, such as MHC-class II and Toll-like
receptor (TLR) signaling (Pal Singh et al., 2018). Interestingly,
BTK inhibitors are in development for several autoimmune dis-
eases including MS (Mullard, 2017). The role of BTK activation
in AP is further supported by phosphorylation of BTK (Figure 3J)
suggesting that the activation of memory B cells involves BTK
signaling and drives AP of CD4+ T cells via interaction with
HLA-DR.
Memory B Cells Drive AP of T Helper Cells
B cell depletion with anti-CD20 antibodies very effectively re-
duces MS relapses suggesting an important role of B cells

 (Hauser et al., 2008). The clinical effects of anti-CD20 therapies
cannot be explained by reduction of autoantibodies as their
main mechanism of action (Hauser et al., 2008; Krumbholz
et al., 2012). B cell depletion may, however, reduce the produc-
tion of proinflammatory cytokines by B cells, which is increased
in MS (Li et al., 2015), and/or their antigen presenting function
via MHC-class II (Molnarfi et al., 2013). To explore how in vivo
alterations of circulating B cells under MS treatments affect AP,
we analyzed patients treated with rituximab (RTX), which
depletes B cells (Hauser et al., 2008), natalizumab (NAT), which
blocks lymphocyte migration to the brain (Yednock et al., 1992)
and increases circulating memory and marginal zone B cells
(Planas et al., 2012), and fingolimod (FTY), which traps naive
and central memory T cells in lymph nodes (Brinkmann et al.,
2010) and reduces circulating B cells. As expected, circulating
B cells were absent in RTX-treated patients, reduced under
FTY and increased under NAT (Figure 4A). Consistent with our
above in vitro data, RTX strongly reduced AP of T cells and proin-
flammatory cytokine responses, FTY led to a minor reduction and
NAT to a strong increase (Figures 4B and S4A). IFN-g production
also correlated with the frequency of AP T cells (Figure 4C). The
strong reduction of in vitro AP T cells raised the question of
whether B cell depletion would also affect peripheral T cell
numbers in RTX-treated patients in vivo. T cell counts indeed
dropped under RTX (Figure 4D). Further, we found significantly
lower frequencies of activated effector memory CD4+ T cells
ex vivo following RTX treatment (Figures 4E and 4F). Of note,
the addition of autologous CD20+ B cells obtained pre-therapy
to samples collected after RTX treatment restored CD4+ T cell
AP (Figures S4B–S4E). Even though depletion of B cells abro-
gated AP of T cells, PBMCs of RTX-treated patients showed
normal numbers of monocytes and mounted normal responses
to a recall antigen excluding a general unresponsiveness of
T cells (Figures S4F and S4G).
Naive B cell numbers correlated negatively, while memory and
particularly unswitched memory B cells correlated positively with
the frequency of AP T cells, suggesting that AP of T cells primarily
depends on memory B cells (Figure 4G). Indeed, transfer of
autologous memory B cells obtained at baseline to samples
collected during RTX treatment increased AP and CD4+ T cell
activation compared to transfer of naive B cells. This increase
was dependent on HLA-DR on memory B cells (Figure 4H). In
line with this and also the magnitude of AP, we observed lower
memory B cell frequencies ex vivo in REL in contrast to an
increase following NAT therapy, both in comparison to REM (Fig-
ure 4I). Importantly, memory but not naive B cells promoted
AP and CD4+ T cell activation directly upon co-culturing B and
T cells alone (Figure 4J).
AP T Cells Are Enriched for Brain-Homing Cells
The increase of AP with NAT therapy may not only be due to the
increase in peripheral memory B cells but also because NAT traps
brain-homing cells in the peripheral blood. This conclusion is sup-
ported by the reduced AP during clinical MS relapses, i.e., when
pathogenic cells presumably have migrated to the brain, and
may explain why MS patients often show strong rebound of dis-
ease activity when NAT treatment is stopped (Sorensen et al.,
2014). To examine this issue, we compared the TCR beta chain
variable gene (TCRVb) sequences in peripheral AP T cells and in
brain lesion-infiltrating T cells of two MS patients (Figure 5A; Table
S4; Table S5), from whom brain lesions (autopsy) or brain-
infiltrating cells (biopsy) were available (Planas et al., 2015,
2018). In two independent experiments in patient 1, we identified
a substantial overlap (17.4%– 29.9%) of identical productive
TCRVb rearrangements between AP (CFSEdim) and brain lesions
compared with a low overlap (2.6%–4.8%) between non-prolifer-
ating T cells (CFSEhi) and brain lesions (Figures 5B and S5A–S5C).
In patient 2, we also found greater overlap between AP T cells and
brain-infiltrating cells (7.2%) compared to non-proliferating T cells
(1.4%) albeit at a lower percentage (Figure 5C). Among the shared
TCRVb sequences, we identified approximately two-thirds of the
sequences from the AP compartment also in resting CFSEhi cells,
yet at much higher frequency in CFSEdim cells (Figure 5B, left
graphs under pie charts). Presumably due to the larger clone-
set size in CFSEhi versus CFSEdim cells, we found more brain-
matching unique TCRVb sequences in the CFSEhi cells, however,
overall at lower frequencies than the shared unique TCRVb
sequences in the AP compartment (Figure 5B, right graphs under
pie charts). Interestingly, TCR clonotypes, which we identified in
peripheral AP T cells, were among the most clonally expanded
in the brain (Figures S5D and S5E; Table S5).
Since the clone-set sizes of the different cell compartments
differed, and the number of shared TCRVb sequences is influ-
enced by this factor (Zvyagin et al., 2014) (Figure S6A), we cor-
rected the numbers of shared brain-matching unique productive
TCRVb sequences in AP and non-proliferating cells for their

 clone-set sizes, i.e., the numbers of total unique productive
TCRVb sequences. Thereupon, we identified not only a higher
overlap of the AP compartment with all brain lesions, but partic-
ularly with the highly active brain lesion LIII (Figure 5D) (Planas
et al., 2015). In the AP compartment, shared TCR sequences
were found in peripheral memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig-
ure S6B; Table S5). Normalization for the number of shared
TCRVb sequences showed that AP memory CD4+ T cell clono-
types are preferentially found in the highly active lesion (Figures
5E and S6B). In contrast and in line with another study (Planas
et al., 2018), brain-matching AP memory CD8+ T cell clonotypes
are among those that are more globally expanded in the
non-proliferating compartment as well as in all three lesions,
indicating that brain-infiltrating memory CD8+ T cells may be
recruited by bystander mechanisms.
AP TCCs Recognize Antigens Expressed in MS Brain
Tissue and B Cells
An important question is whether AP involves recognition of spe-
cific antigens and whether these are presented by B cells. To
examine this issue, we generated T cell clones (TCCs) from the
AP cells of MS patient 1 (homozygous for HLA-DR15) and
show that brain-homing T cells can in principle be obtained effi-
ciently from PBMCs. 6 out of 12 generated CD4+ TCCs were also
present in the highly active brain lesion LIII (Figure 6A). These
AP TCCs showed polyfunctional responses with prominent
non-classical Th1 or Th2 phenotypes due to high secretion of
IFN-g, GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-13, respectively, as well as expres-
sion of CXCR3 and/or CCR6 (Figures 6A and S6C). The strong
secretion of Th2 cytokines is consistent with the predominant
Th2 phenotype of brain-infiltrating T cells in this patient (Planas
et al., 2015).
We next employed an unbiased approach to identify the target
antigen/s of the above TCCs using positional scanning combina-
torial peptide libraries and biometrical analysis (Zhao et al.,
2001). TCC14 expanded sufficiently to be tested with the full
set of 200 positional scanning library mixtures. After determining
its HLA-class II restriction (DRB1*15:01), reactivity against all 200
mixtures was tested and showed positive responses against
single or multiple amino acids in each of the 10 positions (Fig-
ure 6BI). Using scoring matrices to summarize the reactivity of
TCC14 against the decapeptide library after testing multiple
doses, we predicted peptides to be recognized by TCC14 using
a transcriptome database from the brain lesions of MS patient 1
(Figure 6BII) (Zhao et al., 2001). 92 sequences were synthesized
and tested for recognition by TCC14 based upon their appear-
ance in the top 50 predicted peptides for at least one of the
matrices used (Figure 6BIII). As we showed previously, there
is a good relationship between predicted high ranking and
T cell response (Sospedra et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2001) since
TCC14 recognized many of the high scoring peptides. Subse-
quent dose titration experiments with the 33 peptides that gave
positive responses, among them peptides from members of
the RAS guanyl releasing protein (RASGRP1–4) family, showed
that a peptide from RASGRP2 was recognized with high antigen
avidity (EC50 = 0.012 mM) (Figure 6C). Recognition of the
RASGRP2 peptide by TCC14 resulted in secretion of Th2
cytokines and also of IFN-g (Figure 6D). RASGRP1–3 are
of particular interest, since they are expressed both in the brain
lesion of patient 1, but also in the transcriptome of AP memory
B cells (Figure 6E). However, proteomic analysis demonstrated
high abundance of only RASGRP2 and not of the other RASGRPs
in B cells and brain of MS patients (Figure 6F; Table S6).
RASGRP2 Is Expressed in B Cells and Cortical Gray
Matter and Recognized by Memory T Cells
RASGRP2 expression in striatal neurons has been reported (Toki
et al., 2001), and here we demonstrate its wide expression in
human cortical gray matter and specifically also in neurons (Fig-
ure 7A). The latter region is of interest in MS since cortical lesions
and neurodegeneration have been related to ectopic lymphoid
follicles in the meninges (Magliozzi et al., 2007).
To assess the immunogenicity of RASGRP2 in MS patients,
we tested T cell reactivity to overlapping peptides covering
RASGRP2 (Table S7) by fluorospot in PBMCs of HDs, untreated
REM, and NAT-treated MS patients (Figures S7A and S7B). We
observed a stepwise increase in T cells producing IFN-g and
IL-17 with highest numbers in NAT-treated MS patients. Re-
sponses were directed against multiple epitopes of RASGRP2.
Of particular interest is the high frequency in NAT-treated MS pa-
tients indicating that pathogenic cells are trapped in the

 periphery. Consistent with this, RASGRP2 responders almost all
showed high AP (Figure S7C).
We next examined whether RASGRP2 reactivity is mediated
by memory T cells and whether elimination of B cells would
help to distinguish AP from reactivity to the RASGRP2 pep-
tides/protein. Depletion of CD45RA-positive cells, which include
naive T cells and also B cells, enriched not only for memory
T cells but most importantly also depleted the entire B cell line-
age (Figure 7B). The elimination of B cells reduced the ‘‘back-
ground proliferation,’’ i.e. AP, over 7 days (Figure 7C). Using
this methodology, we identified reactivity in TCC14 and all tested
CD45RA-depleted PBMCs of NAT-treated MS patients to
various RASGRP2 peptide pools, but importantly also to the
whole RASGRP2 protein (Figure 7D). The latter demonstrates
that memory T cells in MS are recognizing also naturally pro-
cessed and presented RASGRP2 epitopes.
DISCUSSION
Our data indicate that the interaction of B and T cells leads to
activation and growth, i.e., AP, which appears to play an impor-
tant role in the autoimmune response in MS. The study extends
our previous findings that myelin-specific T cells can be acti-
vated, show TCR signaling, and proliferate upon contact with
fully activated dendritic cells and in the absence of exogenously
added antigen (Kondo et al., 2001).
The
simple
CFSE-based
in
vitro
system
demonstrates
increased AP in PBMCs in the clinically inactive state of the dis-
ease that is driven by memory B cells and is enriched for likely
pathogenic, brain-homing effector memory T cells, i.e., cells
that can invade an immunoprivileged organ. Clinical observa-
tions from anti-CD20 and anti-VLA-4 treatment support the
interaction between B and T cells. B cells may thus participate
not only in maintaining, but also in creating a pathogenic T cell
repertoire in the periphery during REM. Recent data have
shown that B cells are involved in thymic selection (Yamano
et al., 2015), and it is conceivable that they shape a T cell reper-
toire with the propensity to (cross-) react with CNS autoanti-
gens already at this stage. Restimulation and pathogenic differ-
entiation of these T cells may again involve B cells in peripheral
secondary lymphoid organs, although the site, where this takes
place, is not clear. The demonstration of tertiary lymphoid
structures in the meninges of MS patients (Magliozzi et al.,
2007), which are rich in B and T cells and close to cortical le-
sions, indicates that B-T interactions may also be involved in
sustaining inflammation in the CNS. B cell receptor sequencing
of antigen-experienced B cells suggests that CNS-homing
B cells differentiate in cervical lymph nodes before entering
the CNS (Stern et al., 2014), and Ig class-switched memory
B cells exchange between periphery and brain (Palanichamy
et al., 2014).
Important questions arising from these observations are:
Which is the nature of the self-peptides that activate and/or
expand autoreactive CD4+ T cells, and whether the ones leading
to activation in the peripheral immune system are identical to
those recognized in the brain? Data from many laboratories
including ours have shown that peptides from the myelin pro-
teins proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin basic protein (MBP), and
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are target antigens
in EAE and may also play a role in MS (Goverman, 2009; Sospe-
dra and Martin, 2005). MOG and full-length PLP are not
expressed in immune cells or the thymus, while MBP is, and
hence in the case of MOG- and PLP-reactive T cells a mecha-
nism like molecular mimicry and activation by another antigen,
e.g., from a pathogen, has been invoked (Wucherpfennig and
Strominger, 1995). Furthermore, a few non-myelin proteins
including alpha-B crystallin and transaldolase-H, which are
expressed in both lymphoid and CNS cells, may be recognized
by T cells of MS patients, indicating that target antigens do not
have to be myelin proteins (Sospedra and Martin, 2005). In our
current study, we demonstrate not only that HLA-DR on memory
B cells and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling are involved in AP, but
further that these cells can express molecules like RASGRPs,
which are involved in reduced apoptosis and tumorigenesis of
EBV-infected B cells and B and T cell signaling and are crucial
for maintaining B-T cell homeostasis (Stone, 2011). Of note,
RASGRPs and particularly RASGRP2 are expressed in the brain
as well. The unbiased identification of RASGRP2 as a high-
avidity target antigen for CD4+ TCC14, which we isolated from
peripheral AP T cells and which is clonally expanded in an active
brain MS lesion, lends support for a scenario, in which activation
of peripheral B cells with upregulation of HLA-DR and expression
of antigens like RASGRP2 can then activate and propagate
autoreactive CD4+ T cells, which migrate to and induce inflam-
mation in the brain. In this case, the inducing antigen and the
target antigen are identical. Important questions concerning
how the cortical/neuronal expression pattern of RASGRP2
relates to inflammation in the meninges, perivascular spaces,
or brain parenchyma, and how the released protein may be
distributed via the CSF, remain to be addressed.
In summary, our data link B and T cells with MS pathogenesis
and show that the interactions of these two cell types probably
occur in conjunction with the MS-associated DR15 molecules
and that B cells may express antigens, which are also upregu-
lated in the brain and recognized by AP CD4+ T cells. We expect
that our data will be instrumental for further studies about MS
pathomechanisms, as in vitro drug finding platform and to guide
the search for the specificity of B and T cells. Furthermore, they
provide a plausible explanation for the high efficacy of anti-CD20
therapy in a T cell-mediated disease such as MS. Future studies
should address whether AP is influenced by antigen-specific
tolerization (Lutterotti et al., 2013).

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human subjects
Peripheral blood was collected from 32 healthy donors (HD; age range 25-49, F:M ratio: 1.7) and 50 untreated (nihil) patients with
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), of which 18 patients where in relapse (REL; age range 20-45, F:M ratio: 2.0) and 32 patients were
in remission (REM; age range 22-54, F:M ratio: 1.1), in a first cohort. For a second cohort, we used peripheral blood from 14 HD
(age range 25-41, F:M ratio: 0.8) and 14 untreated RRMS patients (REM; age range 22-54, F:M ratio: 1.8). Furthermore, we received
additional blood samples from untreated patients with psoriasis (n = 10; age range 25-47, F:M ratio: 0.4) and Crohn’s disease (Morbus
Crohn, n = 7; age range 25-53, F:M ratio: 1.3). MS had clinically definite MS by clinical and/or McDonald criteria (Polman et al., 2011).
We were blinded for the status of remission and relapse when performing the CFSE assay for samples of RRMS patients. Relapse
was defined as clinical worsening of at least 24 h duration and/or contrast-enhancing lesion/s on MRI and within no more than one
month of peripheral blood collection. Remission was defined as absence of contrast-enhancing lesion/s on MRI and stable clinical
disease course compared to last visit as well as being at least one month before and/or after relapse. Furthermore, peripheral blood
was collected from 15 patients with RRMS under natalizumab treatment (age range 23-50, F:M ratio: 4.0) and 10 patients under
fingolimod treatment (age range 24-47, F:M ratio: 1.5). The majority of samples were collected at the Neuroimmunology and MS
Research Section, Neurology Clinic, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich (Switzerland), and some at the Institute for Neuroimmunology
and Clinical Multiple Sclerosis Research, Centre for Molecular Neurobiology, University Medical Centre Eppendorf, Hamburg
(Germany). In addition, we collected peripheral blood at the MS clinic of the Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital,
Stockholm, from 9 patients before (baseline) and 3 months after rituximab treatment (age range 32-59, F:M ratio: 0.8) and 14 patients
under rituximab treatment (age range 30-59, F:M ratio: 1.3). Furthermore, whole blood was collected and directly analyzed by flow
cytometry in 188 (n = 179 for B and T cell counts, age range 19-65, F:M ratio: 2.0; n = 9 for T cell subsets, age range 33-54, F:M
ratio: 3.5) MS patients before (baseline) and after rituximab treatment. For the RASGRP2 reactivity screening, we collected peripheral
blood from 8 RRMS patients under natalizumab treatment (age range 24-53, F:M ratio: 0.6) at the the Neuroimmunology and MS
Research Section, Neurology Clinic, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich (Switzerland) and from 20 RRMS patients under natalizumab
treatment (age range 21-56, F:M ratio: 0.8) at the MS clinic of the Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stock-
holm. The demographics of all donors included in the study are shown in detail in Table S1. Analysis of the influence of gender identity
on autoproliferation (AP) did not result in any significant difference between females and males, neither in HD nor MS patients (data
not shown).
The samples used for the research activities were taken from various research projects. These have been previously reviewed and
approved by the corresponding Ethics Committees. This includes: a) research projects with EC-No. 2758 approved on 18th October
2007 by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Board of Physicians, Germany; b) research projects with EC-No. 2013-0001 approved
on 05th June 2013, EC-No. 2014-0699 approved on 27th February 2015 and EC-No. 1316 (control samples from patients with Crohn’s
disease) approved on 05th February 2007 by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich, Switzerland; c) the control samples of
psoriasis patients were received from the Biobank of the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland;
d) research project with EC-No. 2015/1280-32 approved on 21st July 2015 by Ethical Vetting Board of Stockholm, Sweden; e) brain
tissue samples and peripheral blood for TCR sequencing were collected from two patients with MS as described previously (Planas
et al., 2015) and approved as part of the research projects with EC-No. 2758 by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg
Board of Physicians, Germany (see above); and f) brain tissue samples were provided for immunohistochemistry analyses by the
Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital Zurich and for proteomic analyses by the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society Tissue
Bank. The use of these samples for research projects was approved respectively by the Regional Ethics Committee for Wales,
UK, on 18th June 2013 (EC-No. 08/MRE09/31+5) and by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich, Switzerland, on 4th September
2014 (EC-No. 2014-0243). All patients consented for the sampling in the framework of the above-mentioned projects. In addition,
all of these patients have consented for the further use of the samples in research (General Consent).
Primary cells and cell lines
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HD and patients were freshly isolated from EDTA-containing blood tubes, sodium
citrate-containing cell preparation tubes, or from leukaphereses using Ficoll (Eurobio) density gradient centrifugation. All isolated
PBMCs were cryopreserved in freezing media containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Applichem) and 90% fetal calf serum
(FCS; Eurobio) and stored at �180�C. PBMCs were obtained under ethical approvals and with informed consent as described above.
The demographics incl. age and gender of these donors in the respective cohorts are depicted in Table S1.
EBV-transformed B cell lines were generated from above collected PBMCs of few individuals (5 HD, age range 28-49, F:M ratio:
1.5; 5 REM, age range 31-52, F:M ratio: 4.0) under ethical approvals and with informed consent as described above. EBV transfor-
mation was performed by using the supernatant of the EBV-producing marmoset B cell line B95-8 (ATCC, see Key Resources Table)
Cell 175, 85–100.e1–e10, September 20, 2018
e5
 and OKT3 antibody (Ortho Biotech). The EBV-transformed B cell lines were maintained in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-
Aldrich) containing 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Corning), 50 mg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and 10% FCS. The B95-8 cell line was cultured also in complete RPMI medium containing 100 U/mL penicillin/
streptomycin, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FCS. Culture supernatants containing EBV particles were collected
after sufficient cell growth over 7 days, centrifugation and filtering for removal of cell debris, and finally frozen at �80�C.
Bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) cells stably expressing one of the HLA-DR15 haplotype expressing HLA class II alleles
(DR2a ( = DRB5*0101), DR2b ( = DRB1*1501) or DQw6 ( = DQB1*0602) were kindly provided by B. Kwok (Benaroya Research
Institute, Seattle). HLA class II-expressing BLS cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium containing 100 U/mL penicillin/
streptomycin, 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FCS. In order to maintain selection and stable expression of the
HLA class II molecules, the medium for the BLS cell lines was supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate (geneticin; Thermo Fisher
Scientific). HLA class II expression of BLS cell lines was verified with specific antibodies against DR2a, DR2b and DQ (Key Resources
Table) and cells were tested negative for mycoplasma.
METHOD DETAILS
Genotyping and genetic analyses
Individuals were typed for HLA class I and II molecules at Histogenetics LLC, NY, USA. Isolation of DNA from whole blood, with a final
concentration of 15 ng/ml, was performed with a standard DNA isolation protocol using a Triton lysis buffer (containing Triton X-100;
Sigma-Aldrich) and Proteinase K treatment. The samples were typed for HLA-class I (A* and B*) and HLA-class II (DRB1*, DRB3*,
DRB4*, DRB5*, DQA1* and DQB1*) using high-resolution HLA sequence-based typing (SBT). Genomic DNA from PBMCs of
28 HD and 29 RRMS (REM) individuals (all of Central European ancestry), for which we assessed in vitro AP, was subjected to gen-
otyping using HumanOmniExpress-24 (v1.1) arrays from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA). Exclusion criteria were maximum per-person
missingness (3%), maximum per-SNP missingness (1%), and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, p < 1x10�7). Whole-
genome imputation was performed using EAGLE2 (Loh et al., 2016) for phasing and PBWT (Durbin, 2014) with the Haplotype Refer-
ence Consortium (HRC) reference panel (release 1.1) (McCarthy et al., 2016). Only markers with an imputation info score > 0.8 were
included in the final dataset. Linear regression was used to test for association between 134 MS non-HLA risk SNPs (Beecham
et al., 2013; Sawcer et al., 2011), a polygenic MS risk score derived from 102 of those markers (A/T and C/G markers removed
due to strand ambiguity) using PRSice v1.25 (Euesden et al., 2015), or HLA-DR15 status, respectively, and the AP phenotype. Single
SNP associations were subjected to Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing correction to assess significance.
Proliferation assays
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed with complete IMDM medium (GE Healthcare) containing 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin
(Corning), 50 mg/mL gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA) and 5% heat-decomplemented human serum (HS,
PAA) and afterward washed once with serum-free AIM-V medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), containing human albumin. Cells
were incubated for 15 min in AIM-V medium containing 50 U/ml DNase (Roche) at 37�C to avoid cell clump formation. Following
two wash steps with PBS containing 0.1% HS, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 103106 cells/ml in PBS/0.1% HS
and were then labeled at a final concentration of 0.5 mM carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Sigma-Aldrich)
for 3 min at room temperature. The labeling was stopped by quenching with 5x excess volume of cold complete RPMI medium
containing 10% HS. After one further wash step with AIM-V, CFSE-labeled cells were seeded at 2 3 105 PBMCs/200 mL per well
in AIM-V (10-12 replicate wells per donor and condition) in 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One) at 37�C, 5% CO2,
in the absence of exogenous stimuli for 7 days (AP). Short-term exposure to media containing heat-decomplemented human serum
during the protocol did not influence AP (data not shown).
For conventional T cell reactions, we used for the same donors PHA (0.5 mg/ml) as TCR-independent stimulus, tetanus toxoid (TTx,
5 mg/ml, Novartis Behring) as foreign antigen stimulus and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) as allogeneic antigen stimulus. For the
MLR we used allogenic irradiated PBMCs pooled from five HD as stimulator cells and CFSE-labeled PBMCs from HD or MS patients
as responder cells in a ratio of 1:1 (each 2 3 105 cells). As conventional B cell reaction, we stimulated PBMCs by cross-linking with an
anti-human IgM antibody (10 mg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch). We tested for competition of AP by incubating CFSE-labeled
PBMCs in the presence of anti-HLA-DR (kindly provided by HG. Rammensee, University of Tu
¨ bingen, Germany) anti-CD4,
anti-CD40, anti-IFN-g and anti-GM-CSF antibodies (10 mg/ml, Key Resources Table) or appropriate isotype controls, and to analyze
AP in the presence of serial dilutions of selective LCK (PP1) and BTK (ibrutinib) inhibitors (Key Resources Table).
After 7 days of AP or conventional B- or T cell reactions, CFSE-labeled cells were collected and pooled from replicate wells,
washed with PBS, Fc-blocked with human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and labeled with Live/Dead� Aqua (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at
4�C. After washing with cold PBS containing 2mM EDTA and 2% FCS, cells were directly stained for surface markers using the
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (Key Resources Table). Measurements were performed on an LSR Fortessa Flow Cytometer
(BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). For the analysis, gates were set at first on singlets and live cells.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were gated prior on CD3+ cells.
Thymidine incorporation assay was used to measure proliferative responses after 2-7 days. At day 2-7, the cells were pulsed with
1 mCi of methyl-3H-thymidine per well (Hartmann Analytic) and harvested after 15 h on a membrane (Filtermat A, GF/C, Perkin-Elmer)
e6
Cell 175, 85–100.e1–e10, September 20, 2018
 using a harvester machine (Tomtec). Incorporation was measured by b-scintillation counting (Wallac 1450, Perkin-Elmer). Prolifera-
tive responses were given as counts per min (cpm).
B cell depletion and transfer
Specific depletion of B cells was performed by depleting CD19+ B cells or CD20+ B cells after CFSE labeling of PBMCs using magnetic
microbeads according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Co-cultures in transwells (Corning) were used to prevent
cell-cell interactions between magnetically isolated CD19+ B cells and autologous PBMCs after CFSE labeling. For post-culture transfer
experiments, CFSEhi and CFSEdim B cells were sorted after 7 days of stimulus-free culture using CFSE-labeled PBMCs (150 Mio cells)
from RRMS (REM) patients, subsequently incubated with control isotype or HLA-DR-blocking (L243) antibodies (10 mg/ml) for 30 min on
ice and then transferred to CFSE-labeled and CD19-depleted autologous PBMCs. FACS analysis of proliferation and activation was
then assessed after 7 days of stimulus-free co-culture in AIM-V medium. For B cell transfer experiments in longitudinal samples of
rituximab-treated MS patients we isolated either CD20+, CD27- naive or CD27+ memory B cells by separating these B cell subpopula-
tions ex vivo from PBMCs from baseline (pre-therapy) with magnetic microbeads (CD20) or FACS sorting (CD19, CD27), respectively.
Isolated CD27- naive or CD27+ memory B cells were incubated with control isotype or HLA-DR-blocking (L243) antibodies (10 mg/ml) for
30 min on ice prior to transfer. Following transfer of the B cell subsets to CFSE-labeled autologous PBMCs from time point of rituximab
treatment, cells were seeded in AIM-V for 7 days in the absence of exogenous stimulus (AP) as described above and then analyzed by
flow cytometry. All conditions in depletion and transfer experiments were performed with at least 6-10 replicate wells.
Primary B-T cell co-cultures
Naive and memory B cells were sorted upon labeling with antibodies against CD19 and CD27 via FACS and subsequently put in
AIM-V medium. At the same time autologous PBMCs were labeled with CFSE as described above and used to magnetically isolate
untouched CD4+ T cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). All cell populations were checked for > 90%
(> 95% for sorting) purity in flow cytometry. Isolated CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells (5x104 cells) were cultured either alone, with sorted
autologous naive or memory B cells (5x104 cells) per well in a 96-well U-bottom microtiter plate in AIM-V in the absence of exogenous
stimulus. Following 7 days, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry by staining for live cells, CD4, CD19 and HLA-DR. Each condition
was performed with 5 replicate wells.
Expansion of T and B cells
AP cells (CFSEdim) were sorted after 7 days of PBMC culture (5x107) in the absence of exogenous stimulus from 5 HLA-DR15+ HD and 5
HLA-DR15+ RRMS (REM) using a FACSAria (BD). Staining with the viability dye 7-AAD (Biolegend) was used to exclude dead cells. The
sorted cells were then expanded as bulk populations for one round with 1 mg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma-Aldrich) and human
IL-2 as previously described (Yousef et al., 2012). Autologous EBV-transformed B cell lines were generated from PBMCs of the
HLA-DR15+ individuals using the supernatant of the EBV-producing marmoset B cell line B95-8 and OKT3 antibody as described above.
Cytokine measurement
Supernatants were collected from the wells of cultured CFSE-labeled PBMCs after 7 days. Cytokines were measured with Human
T Helper Cytokine Panel LEGENDplex bead-based immunoassay (Biolegend; incl. measurement of 13 human cytokines: IL-2, IL-4,
IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IFN-g and TNF) using flow cytometry according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. IFN-g ELISA (Biolegend) and GM-CSF ELISA (BD Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Heatmaps for cytokine responses were generated using Spice software (NIH, NIAID). For visualization purposes in
graphs using a log axis absent values or values below standard range were set as 1.
Ex vivo multicolor staining
B and T cell numbers were analyzed before and after rituximab treatment in 179 MS patients (Table S1). Whole blood was collected,
lysed with IOTest� 3 Lysing Solution (Beckman Coulter) and stained with an antibody mix containing antibodies against CD19 and
CD3 (multicolor panel from Beckman Coulter including antibodies against CD45, CD56, CD19 and CD3 and in addition an antibody
against CD16 from BD). For the quantification of absolute T and B cell numbers Flow-Count Fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter) with a
known concentration were added at an equal volume to the stained sample. Measurements were performed on a Navios (Beckman
Coulter) flow cytometer until March 2016 and on an Aquios (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer after April 2016. The number of cells
was calculated as follows: absolute count (cells/ml) = (total number of cells counted / total number of fluorospheres counted) x con-
centration of flow-count fluorospheres. T cell subtypes and activated T cells were analyzed in 9 RRMS samples before (untreated)
and after rituximab therapy (Table S1) using a multicolor panel with appropriate antibodies (Key Resources Table). PBMCs from
untreated RRMS (REM) patients used for the in vitro CFSE assay, were stained ex vivo for multiple B cell markers (Key Resources
Table) to distinguish different B cell subsets and to correlate their frequency with the AP of T cells in vitro.
Intracellular cytokine and phosphoprotein staining
Intracellular cytokine staining was performed on CFSE-labeled PBMCs of RRMS (REM) patients after adding GolgiStop protein trans-
port inhibitor (BD Biosciences) at day 7 of stimulus-free culture. After 5 hours in the presence of GolgiStop, CFSE-labeled PBMCs
Cell 175, 85–100.e1–e10, September 20, 2018
e7
 were pooled, Fc-blocked with human IgG and labeled with Live/Dead� Aqua at 4�C and subsequently stained for CD3, CD4 and CD8
on ice (Key Resources Table). Following fixation and permeabilization with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), cells were stained
with cytokine-specific antibodies (Key Resources Table) in PBS containing saponin (Applichem) and bovine serum albumin
(BSA; Roth).
Measurement of phosphorylated signaling molecules was performed on CFSE-labeled PBMCs of RRMS (REM) patients at day 7 of
stimulus-free culture. After pooling replicate wells, cells were labeled with Live/Dead� Aqua and stained with an antibody against
CD3 or CD19 on ice to prevent activation by the antibody. All centrifugation steps as well as buffers were pre-chilled at 4�C. Following
wash steps in ice-cold PBS containing 2mM EDTA and 2% FCS, cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 15 min and after centrifugation
permeabilized with 90% ice-cold methanol. Finally, the cells were stained with antibodies against phosphorylated epitopes of
STAT1, CD3z, ZAP-70 or BTK (Key Resources Table) in PBS containing saponin and BSA. Measurements were performed on an
LSR Fortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star).
RNA sequencing
For RNA sequencing analysis of non-proliferating (CFSEhi) and AP (CFSEdim) CD3+CD4+ and CD19+ cells, we labeled 5x107 CFSE-
labeled PBMCs of RRMS (REM) patients at day 7 of unstimulated in vitro culture with Live/Dead� Aqua and antibodies against
CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 (Key Resources Table) and subsequently sorted live CFSEhi and CFSEdim cells of CD3+CD4+ and
CD19+ subsets using a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were adjusted to the same cell number for CFSEhi and CFSEdim,
washed once in PBS, resuspended in Qiazol (QIAGEN) and after a short incubation at room temperature frozen at �80�C. RNA
isolation was performed with the PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
after phenol (Qiazol)/chloroform extraction. In brief, Qiazol preserved sorted cells (10.000 – 30.000 cells) were incubated with
chloroform and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000xg at 4�C. The upper aqueous phase was collected and added to an equal volume
of 70% ethanol. RNA was then isolated using PicoPure RNA Isolation columns and stored at �80�C until RNA sequencing was
performed at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ). RNA integrity and quantity were assessed by capillary electropho-
resis using RNA PicoChip on the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). SMARTer stranded total RNA-
seq- pico input mammalian kit (Clontech laboratories) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions for library generation
from 500pg of total RNA obtained from CD4+ T cells. Quantification and quality control of generated libraries were performed
on an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer with DNA-specific chip (Agilent Technologies). Uniquely barcoded libraries were
pooled in equal molarities (10nM) and further used for cluster generation according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using
TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v4-cBot-HS (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with single read (1x125bp) approach using
the TruSeq SBS Kit v4-HS (Illumina). The raw reads were first cleaned by removing adaptor sequences, trimming low quality ends
(four bases from read start and read end), and filtering reads with low quality (phred quality < 20). Sequence alignment and isoform
expression quantification of the resulting high-quality reads to the human genome assembly (build GRCh38, ensembl
80 annotations) was performed with the RSEM algorithm (version 1.2.22) (Li and Dewey, 2011) with the option for estimation of
the read start position distribution turned on. Genes not present (< 10 counts per gene) in at least 50% of samples from one
condition were discarded from further analyses. Differential gene expression analysis between CFSEdim and CFSEhi cell samples
was performed using the R/bioconductor package edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) in which the normalization factor was calculated
by trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg proced-
ure. For cluster analysis, a p value < 0.01 was applied. Thresholds log2 fold change > 0.5 and adjusted p values < 0.01 were used

TCRVb sequencing
In order to separate CFSEhi and CFSEdim cells for TCRVb sequencing, we labeled 5x107 PBMCs with CFSE as described above,
pooled replicate wells after 7 days of stimulus-free co-culture, stained with the viability dye 7-AAD and subsequently sorted live
(7-AAD-) non-proliferating (CFSEhi) and AP (CFSEdim) subpopulations using a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were
washed with PBS and frozen as dry pellets at �80�C. Amplification and sequencing of TCRVb CDR3 were performed on extracted
DNA of brain lesions and sorted peripheral blood CFSEhi and CFSEdim subpopulations, derived from culture of CFSE-labeled PBMCs,
of two MS patients as well as sorted peripheral blood CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+ memory T cells of one MS patient using the
immunoSEQ Platform (Adaptive Biotechnologies�, Seattle, WA). The immunoSEQ Platform combines multiplex PCR with high
throughput sequencing and a sophisticated bioinformatics pipeline for TCRVb CDR3 analysis (Carlson et al., 2013; Robins et al.,
2009). In the data analysis, we first excluded non-productive TCRVb sequences and CDR3 sequences with less than 4 amino acids,
and then recalculated the frequency of the remaining unique productive TCRVb sequences in each sample. Shared unique
productive TCRVb sequences between different cloneset samples were identified with the immunoSEQ analyzer 2.0 of Adaptive
Biotechnologies� based on identical CDR3 amino acid, V- and J-chain sequence. Normalization of the cloneset sample overlap
was performed with the following equation: amount of shared unique productive TCRVb sequences in cloneset sample 1 (M) with
cloneset sample 2 (N) divided by the amount of total unique productive TCRVb sequences in cloneset size sample 1 (M) multiplied
by the amount of total unique productive TCRVb sequences in cloneset size sample 2 (N). The result was multiplied by 1000 and
depicted as arbitrary unit (AU), based on a previous publication (Zvyagin et al., 2014).

 T cell cloning
In order to generate T cell clones (TCCs) from the AP compartment, we splitted 500 CFSEdim cells from the sorted cell pool of CFSEdim
cells (20.000 cells) of MS patient 1 (for the TCRVb sequencing, described above) and performed limiting dilution as previously
described (Yousef et al., 2012). TCCs were enriched using an expansion protocol with PHA and human IL-2 (kindly provided
by F. Sallusto, IRB, Bellinzona, Switzerland) (Yousef et al., 2012). Sequencing of TCR rearrangements of the generated TCCs
was analyzed, as previously described (Yousef et al., 2012). To assess the cytokine response of the TCCs, a-CD2/CD3/CD28
antibody-loaded MACSibead particles (Miltenyi) were used to stimulate each TCC in 7 replicate wells with each 200.000 cells
in X-Vivo medium (Lonza). After 48 h supernatants were collected and cytokine responses measured, as described above. For
chemokine receptor expression, TCCs were stained with Live/dead Aqua and antibodies against CXCR3 and CCR6 after thawing
and resting cells over night.
Positional scanning libraries and Biometrical Analysis
A L-aa decapeptide positional scanning library (N-acetylated and C-amide TPI 2040) was prepared as previously described (Pinilla
et al., 1994). Each of the 200 mixtures of the library was tested for their proliferative activity by TCC14 at 40, 120, and 200 mg/ml using
thymidine incorporation assay. The restriction of TCC14 was tested with irradiated BLS cells stably expressing one of the HLA-DR15
haplotype expressing HLA class II alleles (DR2a ( = DRB5*0101), DR2b ( = DRB1*1501) or DQw6 ( = DQB1*0602); kindly provided
by B. Kwok, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle), since the TCC is derived from a HLA-DR15 homozygous MS patient. After con-
firming restriction of TCC14 for DR2b, all further tests for TCC14 were performed with irradiated BLS-DR2b as APC. The results were
organized into four matrices (data not shown): three matrices each representing the activity at one of the above doses, and a matrix
using the concentration to achieve 3-fold proliferation to combine all three doses into a single activity. Using the biometrical analysis
process (Zhao et al., 2001) against the transcriptome protein database from the brain of MS patient 1, predicted peptide lists were
generated for each of the four matrices. Due to a large amount of agreement between the predicted lists, a total of 92 distinct dec-
amer peptides occurred within the top 50 predicted peptides in at least one matrix’s prediction list. These peptides were chosen to be
synthesized (Peptides & Elephants) and tested for proliferative responses after 72 h using thymidine incorporation assay.
Proteomics by LC-MS/MS
In order to obtain peptides for mass spectrometric analysis, dry pellets of magnetically sorted untouched CD19+ B cells (HD and MS
(REM), each n = 4; samples sizes of 2-6x106 cells) were lysed with an adapted filter aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol as
previously described (Wi�
sniewski et al., 2009). Fresh frozen brain tissue from cortical gray matter from brains (n = 6 controls, pooled
and n = 6 MS, pooled) was dissociated and lysed using a PCT technology as previously described (Guo et al., 2015). Resulting pep-
tides were dissolved in 3% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid before injecting into an Easy-nLC 1000 linked to an Orbitrap Fusion
instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a gradient of 120 min. As column material ReproSil-Pur, C18, 120 A
˚ , AQ, 1.9 mm (Dr. Maisch
GmbH) with column dimensions ID 0.075mm/ length 150mm was used. For protein identification, ‘‘raw’’ files were converted into
‘‘mgf’’ files and analyzed on MASCOT software with a human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database (date: March 22, 2016 with
40912 entries). As search parameters 0.8 Da fragment mass tolerance and 10ppm precursor mass, minimal number of peptides 2,
and fdr of 0.1%, allowing 2 mis-cleavages on trypsin fragments were defined. Carbamidomethyl at cysteine was set as a static modi-
fication, and oxidation of methionine, acetylation of lysine and protein N terminus were set as variable modification. Scaffold software
(version 4.8.4) was used to validate and count spectral peptide matches. All identified peptide sequences of both brain and B cell
samples are listed in Table S6.
Immunohistochemical stainings
In brief, slices were dewaxed through graded alcohols. Sections were then incubated in Ventana buffer, and automatically stained
with the NEXEX immunohistochemistry robot (Ventana Instruments) using primary antibody against RASGRP2 (dilution 1:50; rabbit
polyclonal to RASGRP2 - N-terminal; Key Resources Table). Finally, sections were developed using an iVIEW DAB Detection Kit
(Ventana). Omission of the primary antisera in the control slides resulted in no immunostaining at all. Sections were scanned under
equal lighting conditions at 40x magnification using a Hamamatsu tissue scanner (Nanozoomer). Hamamatsu NDPI images of each
scanned slide were transfered to a computer screen (Viewer Version DIH 4.0.0-20130402-63) and representative images were
captured. In addition, hematoxylin (Roth) and eosin (Merck) (HE) stainings were performed.
RASGRP2 reactivity
We tested RASGRP2 reactivity by assessing cytokine production in PBMCs (2.53105 cell/well) from HD (n = 11), untreated RRMS
patients (REM; n = 9) and RRMS patients under natalizumab treatment (NAT; n = 20) (Table S1) using a IFNg/IL17/IL22 Fluorospot
Kit (Mabtech) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were cultured for 44h with vehicle control (DMSO), stimulated
with anti-CD3 antibody (mAB CD3-2, included in Fluorospot Kit) or RASGRP2 peptide pools (see above, final concentration of
pool 10 mM)) in complete RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine and 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Wells were
set up in duplicates for each condition and fluorescent spots were counted using a fluorospot plate reader (AID iSpot Spectrum,
AID GmbH).

 In order to test reactivity to RASGRP2 in memory T cells, cryopreserved PBMCs (13108 cells) of natalizumab-treated MS patients
were thawed and afterward depleted for CD45RA-expressing cells using magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi). 23105 CD45RA-depleted
PBMCs were seeded per well in X-Vivo medium (10-15 replicate wells per condition) and were either unstimulated, treated with
vehicle (DMSO) or pulsed with RASGRP2 peptide pools (final concentration of pool 10 mM) or whole purified RASGRP2 protein
(Origene; 0.3 mg/ml). The 15-mer-overlapping peptides covering the whole RASGRP2 protein were organized in 9 peptide pools
with 7 peptides per pool covering the sequence of RASGRP2 from N- (pool 1) to C terminus (pool 9) (Table S7). a-CD2/CD3/
CD28 beads (Miltenyi) were used as positive control and added to 5 replicate wells at day 4 of PBMC culture. Thymidine incorporation
assay was used to measure proliferation responses to RASGRP2 after 7 days. Stimulatory index (SI) was calculated as ratio of
peptide or protein stimulation versus vehicle control. SI values > 2 were considered as positive.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism. Multiple comparison analyses were assessed with a non-parametric
one-way Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was performed
on data with only two groups. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for analysis of paired samples. Correlation was
calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation test. P values are reported in the figures and figure legends where significant. Error
bars are shown as standard error of the mean (SEM) and are indicated in the figures. Sample sizes were chosen based on previous
experience of in vitro experiments (Mohme et al., 2013). Other quantitative and statistical methods are noted above according to their
respective technologies and analytic approaches.
