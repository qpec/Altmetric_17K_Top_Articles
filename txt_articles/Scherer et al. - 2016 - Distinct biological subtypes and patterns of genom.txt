Abstract
Patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibit marked diversity in tumor behavior 
and outcomes, yet the identification of poor-risk groups remains challenging. In addition, the 
biology underlying these differences is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that 
characterization of mutational heterogeneity and genomic evolution using circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) profiling could reveal molecular determinants of adverse outcomes. To address this 
hypothesis, we applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) analysis to 
tumor biopsies and cell-free DNA samples from 92 lymphoma patients and 24 healthy subjects. At 
diagnosis, the amount of ctDNA was found to strongly correlate with clinical indices and was 
independently predictive of patient outcomes. We demonstrate that ctDNA genotyping can classify 
transcriptionally defined tumor subtypes, including DLBCL cell of origin, directly from plasma. 
By simultaneously tracking multiple somatic mutations in ctDNA, our approach outperformed 
immunoglobulin sequencing and radiographic imaging for the detection of minimal residual 
disease and facilitated noninvasive identification of emergent resistance mutations to targeted 
therapies. In addition, we identified distinct patterns of clonal evolution distinguishing indolent 
follicular lymphomas from those that transformed into DLBCL, allowing for potential noninvasive 
prediction of histological transformation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ctDNA 
analysis reveals biological factors that underlie lymphoma clinical outcomes and could facilitate 
individualized therapy.
INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL), displays remarkable clinical and biological heterogeneity (1). Although 
therapy is curative in most cases, 30 to 40% of patients ultimately relapse or become 
refractory to treatment (2, 3). Accurate prediction of patient outcomes would facilitate 
individualized treatments, yet conventional methods for risk stratification and personalized 
therapy selection are limited. For example, the International Prognostic Index (IPI) classifies 
patients into risk groups based on clinical parameters but has failed to demonstrate utility for 
directing therapy (4, 5). In addition, metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography/
computed tomography (PET/CT) has failed to improve survival in patients who relapse after 
initial response to therapy, in part because of low specificity (6–8).
Biomarkers based on tumor molecular features hold great promise for risk stratification and 
therapeutic targeting but are currently difficult to measure in clinical settings. For example,

 most DLBCL tumors can be classified into two transcriptionally distinct molecular subtypes, 
each derived from a specific B cell differentiation state [cell of origin (COO)]: germinal 
center B cell–like (GCB) and activated B cell–like (ABC) DLBCL (9–11). These subtypes 
are prognostic and may also predict sensitivity to emerging targeted therapies (12–15). 
Although several methods for COO assessment have been developed, the current gold 
standard is based on microarray gene expression profiling, which is clinically impractical 
because of its reliance on fresh frozen tissues (10, 11). In contrast, immunohistochemistry is 
routinely used for COO classification on fixed clinical samples but suffers from low 
reproducibility and accuracy. Although newer methods can overcome some of these issues 
(16), all existing approaches rely on the availability of invasive tumor biopsies (16–19).
Separately, a subset of patients are diagnosed with DLBCL after histological transformation 
from an otherwise indolent and low-grade follicular lymphoma (FL); these patients represent 
another biologically defined risk group in need of improved biomarkers (20, 21). Although 
several genetic aberrations have been linked to this event, no single factor has been shown to 
accurately predict transformation. In addition, the molecular properties of transformation 
remain poorly understood (22–25).
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood 
has recently emerged as a promising noninvasive approach for analyzing tumor genetic 
diversity and clonal evolution (26–32). Using cancer personalized profiling by deep 
sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an ultrasensitive capture-based targeted sequencing method, we 
performed deep molecular profiling of lymphoma tissue and cell-free DNA to define key 
biological features predictive of clinical outcomes (Fig. 1) (33, 34). Our findings reveal 
distinct patterns of genetic variation linked to adverse outcomes and emphasize the promise 
of noninvasive characterization of risk for managing patients with lymphoma.
RESULTS
Improved noninvasive profiling of tumor genetic heterogeneity in DLBCL
We and others previously showed that clonotypic immunoglobulin (Ig) V(D)J 
rearrangements can be detected and monitored in the peripheral blood of most DLBCL 
patients by HTS (IgHTS) (26, 27). However, IgHTS tracks a single tumor-specific genetic 
aberration and cannot capture the complex landscape of somatic variation in lymphoma. To 
overcome this shortcoming, we implemented a DLBCL-focused sequencing panel targeting 
recurrent single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions, and breakpoints involving 
genes that participate in canonical fusions (BCL2, BCL6, MYC, and IGH). We also included 
Ig heavy-chain variable regions (IgVH) and the Ig heavy-chain joining cluster (IgJH) (table 
S1) (33–42). By profiling 92 human subjects at various disease milestones, we evaluated the 
technical performance of this targeted sequencing approach and the clinical utility of ctDNA 
for capturing DLBCL tumor genotypes.
We started by analyzing 76 diagnostic DLBCL tumor biopsies and 144 longitudinal plasma 
samples, 45 of which were obtained before treatment (figs. S1 to S6 and table S2). We 
identified somatic alterations in 100% of tumors with a median of 134 variants, including 
driver mutations in well-known DLBCL hotspot genes, IgH V(D)J rearrangements, and 89%

 of all chromosomal translocations previously identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH; fig. S1 and table S3). Applied to pretreatment plasma, our assay detected ctDNA in 
100% of patients with 99.8% specificity when tumor genotypes were known (fig. S2). In 
addition, 91% of tumor-confirmed SNVs in driver genes could be noninvasively genotyped 
directly from pretreatment plasma, and this detection rate was directly correlated with 
ctDNA concentrations (fig. S3). At least one tumor-confirmed variant was identified by 
noninvasive genotyping in 87% of pre-treatment plasma samples (39 of 45) and in all cases 
with ctDNA concentrations above 5 haploid genome equivalents (hGE)/ml (fig. S3B). Over 
this threshold, 95% of FISH-confirmed translocations in BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were 
detected by biopsy-free genotyping. This included a patient harboring a clinically important 
double hit lymphoma involving BCL2 and MYC, which is associated with poor prognosis 
(fig. S4A) (43–47). Because our panel targets multiple genomic regions and aberration 
types, we reasoned that it should have advantages over IgHTS for tumor genotyping and 
ctDNA assessment. In both historic studies of IgHTS and paired analyses in our own cohort, 
CAPP-Seq achieved higher sensitivity (Fig. 2, A and B) (26, 27). Thus, capture-based 
targeted sequencing can effectively detect somatic alterations in DLBCL tumors and plasma 
samples.
Because our approach can interrogate many mutations simultaneously, we next assessed 
whether the mutational architecture of DLBCL tumors is faithfully maintained in the 
plasma. We therefore determined and compared ctDNA burden serially over time, using 
mutations identified from either tumor biopsies or paired pretreatment plasma samples. 
Regardless of the source, the amount of ctDNA was highly concordant in serial plasma time 
points, both within individual patients and across all patients (figs. S4B and S5). Moreover, 
in nearly every patient, allele frequencies (AFs) of individual mutations found in both the 
primary tumor and the paired plasma were highly correlated (fig. S6). These data suggest 
that, in most DLBCL patients, ctDNA is a robust surrogate for direct assessment of primary 
tumor genotypes.
Next, we evaluated our method’s capability for biopsy-free detection of somatic alterations 
emerging during therapy or disease surveillance (Fig. 2, C and D, and figs. S7 and S8). We 
applied noninvasive genotyping to three patients with progressive disease receiving ibrutinib, 
an inhibitor of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). 
Resistance mutations in BTK have exclusively been described in tumor cells of patients with 
ibrutinib–refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (48, 49). 
However, it remains unclear whether these mutations also occur in aggressive lymphomas, 
such as DLBCL, and whether they can be detected in plasma. By using ctDNA, we 
identified emergent resistance mutations in BTK that displayed distinct clonal dynamics in 
two of three patients (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S7, A and B). In one DLBCL patient, two 
adjacent BTK mutations encoding an identical amino acid substitution (BTK C481S) were 
found, but they were never observed within the same ctDNA molecule, demonstrating 
convergent evolution of independent resistant subclones (Fig. 2, C and D, and fig. S7A). 
These results suggest that tumor genotyping from plasma can facilitate monitoring of BTK-
targeted therapy, regardless of histology. Thus, ctDNA profiling with CAPP-Seq has utility 
for real-time assessment of dynamic tumor processes, including clonal evolution and the 
acquisition of molecular resistance.

 Prognostic value of ctDNA in DLBCL
Having demonstrated the technical performance of the assay, we next determined whether 
ctDNA analysis could facilitate early identification of clinically relevant risk groups in 
DLBCL. We started by comparing total ctDNA burden at diagnosis with standard clinical 
indices and risk of radiographic progression (Fig. 3 and fig. S9) (33). The amount of ctDNA 
was significantly correlated with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; P < 1 × 10−4), the 
most commonly used biomarker for DLBCL (Fig. 3A and fig. S9A) (50). Notably, whereas 
100% of pretreatment samples had detectable ctDNA, only 37% of samples had abnormally 
high LDH, demonstrating superior sensitivity of ctDNA. Pretreatment ctDNA levels were 
strongly associated with metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) measured using 
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scans (Fig. 3B) (33). ctDNA concentrations at initial 
diagnosis were also significantly correlated with Ann Arbor stage (P = 3 × 10−4; Fig. 3C) 
and IPI (P < 1 × 10−4; fig. S9B) (5). Furthermore, we tested whether ctDNA concentrations 
at diagnosis were linked with the risk of future disease progression. In multivariate analyses 
incorporating key clinical parameters, higher ctDNA levels were continuously and 
independently correlated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; table S4). Thus, 
pretreatment ctDNA in DLBCL can complement traditional clinical indices and serve as an 
independent prognostic biomarker.
Early detection of DLBCL relapse
Among the most promising clinical applications of ctDNA is its potential use for the 
detection of radiographically occult MRD (26, 27). We profiled plasma samples at times of 
radiographic complete response (n = 30) or recurrence (n = 8) from 11 patients, all of whom 
ultimately experienced disease progression despite therapy with curative intent. Whereas 
ctDNA was identified in all patients at the time of clinical relapse (Fig. 3D), it was also 
detectable as MRD before relapse in at least one plasma sample in 8 of 11 patients (73%), 
with ctDNA concentrations as low as 0.003% AF (0.11 hGE/ml). The mean elapsed time 
between the first ctDNA-positive time point and clinical relapse was 188 days, and all blood 
collections up to 3 months before relapse had ctDNA above the detection limit of our assay 
(Fig. 3D). When directly compared to IgHTS, our method detected MRD in twice as many 
patients with a mean lead time of >2 months, suggesting potential advantages in the 
surveillance setting (Fig. 3E and fig. S10) (26, 27). In contrast, ctDNA was undetectable in 
plasma samples from 10 patients who were disease-free for at least 24 months after therapy 
(51) and in 24 healthy adult subjects, demonstrating 100% specificity. Finally, we found that 
patients with ctDNA detected in plasma showed significantly inferior PFS compared to those 
with undetectable ctDNA (P = 3 × 10−4, log-rank test; Fig. 3F). This remained significant 
when controlling for “guarantee-time bias” (P = 8 × 10−5, likelihood ratio test), a potential 
confounding effect of comparing survival between groups when the classifying event (that 
is, ctDNA measurement) occurs during follow-up (52, 53). We observed a similar, though 
not significant, trend for overall survival (P = 0.056, log-rank test; fig. S11). Collectively, 
these results illustrate the promise of ctDNA profiling by targeted sequencing for improved 
MRD assessment and early relapse detection.

 COO classification
COO classification of DLBCL is one of the strongest prognostic factors and a potential 
biomarker for future personalized therapies, yet accurate subtyping remains challenging in 
clinical settings (12–16, 19). We therefore used multiplexed somatic mutation profiling to 
develop a tool for COO classification from tumor or pretreatment plasma. By considering 
mutations enriched in GCB or non-GCB (ABC) DLBCL and targeted by our capture panel, 
we built a probabilistic classifier using a Bayesian approach (23, 54, 55). Patients in the 
training cohort were previously subtyped by microarray-based gene expression profiling of 
frozen tissues, currently considered the gold standard even if not clinically practical (fig. S12 
and table S5) (23, 55). We then benchmarked the classifier performance using our cohort of 
76 lymphoma tumor biopsies, predicting 44 patients as GCB and 32 as non-GCB (Fig. 4A). 
By comparing our results to a blinded, centralized immunohistochemical classification using 
the Hans algorithm (the current clinical standard), we observed a concordance rate of almost 
80% (Fig. 4A) (17, 19). Patients identified as having GCB DLBCL by our classification 
approach had superior PFS over those identified as having non-GCB DLBCL (P = 0.02, log-
rank test; Fig. 4B), consistent with previous descriptions of survival differences between 
COO subtypes (11). In addition, COO classifier scores were continuously associated with 
improved PFS (P = 3 × 10−3; Fig. 4C). Among patients analyzed by both 
immunohistochemistry and DNA genotyping, the Hans algorithm failed to stratify patient 
clinical outcomes, suggesting more accurate classification by our approach (Fig. 4D).
We next tested the COO classifier without knowledge of the tumor, using pretreatment 
plasma ctDNA (n = 41). The overall concordance between COO predictions from tumor 
tissue and biopsy-free plasma genotyping was 88% (Fig. 4E). Moreover, DLBCL molecular 
subtypes predicted directly from plasma were significantly associated with PFS in 
continuous models (P = 0.02; Fig. 4C). Thus, biopsy-free assessment of ctDNA has 
considerable potential for the classification of transcriptionally defined DLBCL subtypes.
Patterns of genome evolution in patients with histological transformation
Patients with aggressive DLBCL arising from histological transformation of an indolent FL 
represent another biologically defined risk group associated with poor prognosis (56, 57). 
We hypothesized that a comparative genomic analysis of paired tumor specimens might 
reveal biological features distinguishing histological transformation of FL (tFL), progression 
without transformation [nontransformed FL (ntFL)], and progression of DLBCL. 
Accordingly, we applied CAPP-Seq to three groups of paired tumor samples: (i) diagnostic 
FL versus tFL (n = 12), (ii) diagnostic FL versus ntFL (n = 12), and (iii) diagnostic de novo 
DLBCL versus relapsed/refractory DLBCL (rrDLBCL) (n = 7; Fig. 5 and figs. S13 and 
S14). We then compared the evolutionary history of these sequential tumor pairs by defining 
genetic alterations that were either common to both tumors or private to each (fig. S13A).
Among the three classes, we observed the greatest evolutionary distance among tumor pairs 
associated with histological transformation (Fig. 5, A and B, and figs. S13, B to D, and S14). 
This pattern was most pronounced when examining the fraction of mutations unique to the 
tumor biopsy at progression, which served to distinguish all three tumor subtypes (Fig. 5A 
and fig. S13D). Genomic divergence was independent of both the time to progression or

 transformation and the number of previous therapies, suggesting that this simple index could 
have utility as a biomarker of histological transformation (fig. S13E).
We therefore analyzed tumor biopsies obtained at diagnosis, along with follow-up plasma 
samples from patients with indolent lymphomas experiencing transformation (n = 8), 
progression without transformation (n = 7), or rrDLBCL (n = 11). In four patients, we 
additionally profiled follow-up plasma samples obtained before clinical evidence of 
transformation. Plasma genotyping results largely matched those from sequential tumors, 
with a higher fraction of emergent variants distinguishing tFL from other histologies (Fig. 
5C). Separately, higher amounts of ctDNA were found to distinguish tFL and rrDLBCL 
from ntFL (Fig. 5D), suggesting that aggressive lymphomas display similar tumor cell 
proliferation and turnover kinetics, despite their separate origins. When considering these 
discriminatory features within a logistic regression framework incorporating leave-one-out 
cross validation, we were able to noninvasively classify tFL from ntFL with 83% sensitivity 
and 89% specificity (Fig. 5E). Moreover, our model successfully predicted tFL in three of 
four plasma samples collected on an average of 66 days before clinical diagnosis. Together, 
these results demonstrate key genomic differences between the three lymphoma subtypes 
and highlight the potential of ctDNA as a noninvasive biomarker for early detection of 
transformation.
Most of the patients who experienced histological transformation showed similar mutations 
in tumor/plasma pairs obtained at matching time points. However, in one patient, we 
observed a marked discordance between a diagnostic FL tumor biopsy (left inguinal) and 
corresponding plasma sample (Fig. 5F, left). Most mutations from the latter were shared 
with the patient’s tFL tumor biopsy (retroperitoneum), obtained 9 months later and after 
unusual refractoriness to rituximab (Fig. 5F, right). These observations suggest that both 
indolent and aggressive clones were already present before clinical diagnosis of 
transformation, even if spatially separated (Fig. 5F, left). In support of this hypothesis, when 
we applied our logistic regression model to this patient’s pretreatment plasma at FL 
diagnosis, we classified the tumor subtype as tFL and, thus, poorly suited for rituximab 
monotherapy. These data further demonstrate the value of plasma genotyping for capturing 
clinically relevant tumor heterogeneity and emphasize the importance of sampling genomic 
information from spatially distinct tumor deposits.
DISCUSSION
Clinical and biological heterogeneity are key factors contributing to adverse risk and 
treatment failure in many cancers, including lymphomas. To address these challenges for 
patients with DLBCL, we applied CAPP-Seq, a highly sensitive targeted sequencing 
method, to analyze genetic profiles in 118 biopsies and 166 plasma samples from major 
disease milestones. In comparison to IgHTS, this approach achieved higher analytical and 
clinical sensitivity in capturing the mutational landscape of lymphoma and its clonal 
evolution. In addition, capture-based ctDNA analysis complemented cross-sectional imaging 
and facilitated the discovery of tumor molecular features and candidate bio-markers 
associated with high disease burden, relapse, non-GCB DLBCL, and histological 
transformation. Together, our findings highlight the advantages of ctDNA as a noninvasive

 bio-marker and provide a number of risk stratification strategies for clinical translation (Fig. 
1).
For example, some patients with recurrent DLBCL undergo potentially curative subsequent 
therapies, including autologous stem cell transplantation (58). Although early detection of 
relapse has a potential for improving outcomes, surveillance imaging is considered to be 
largely ineffective for disease monitoring because of high false-positive rates (6, 7, 59, 60). 
We detected ctDNA in 100% of the analyzed patients at the time of radiographic relapse, 
and 73% of patients undergoing surveillance had detectable ctDNA before clinical 
progression, with a mean lead time of more than 6 months. These results could inform 
clinical trial designs examining treatment paradigms based on early intervention directed by 
ctDNA detection.
In addition, accurate classification of GCB- and ABC-like molecular subtypes is important 
for determining prognosis in DLBCL patients. Here, we report a method for DLBCL 
classification based on integrating diverse somatic mutation profiles. This approach is both 
accurate and practical, allowing input material from either fixed tumor tissue or plasma 
samples, with high tumor-plasma concordance rates. Our noninvasive classification results 
were associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting a viable alternative to current methods 
that are limited by the requirement for invasive biopsies and suboptimal assay performance 
(11, 17, 61, 62). Moreover, the recent development of subtype-directed therapy has increased 
the importance of simultaneous disease classification and tumor genotyping (12–15). For 
example, patients classified as having ABC-like DLBCL by expression-based subtyping, and 
particularly those with ABC-like tumors that harbor gain-of-function mutations in BCR 
pathway genes (CD79B with or without MYD88), demonstrated a higher rate of ibrutinib 
efficacy (12). In this cohort, we detected nine such patients by deep sequencing (table S3). 
Thus, our integrative approach could support future clinical trials through the identification 
of poor-risk groups at diagnosis and could also guide therapy selection and improve 
treatment decisions by combining COO subtyping and assessment of favorable mutational 
patterns in a single assay (12). Separately, the framework we describe for disease 
classification using somatic alterations could extend to the noninvasive classification of 
many tumor types.
Finally, histological transformation of FL to DLBCL is characterized by a change from 
indolent to aggressive clinical behavior, associated with an unfavorable prognosis (56). We 
demonstrate that different NHL types, including tFL, exhibit distinct patterns of genome 
evolution. Among the subtypes that we evaluated, paired FL and tFL tumors showed the 
greatest evolutionary distance, on average, from their last common clonal progenitor, a 
finding that mirrors the marked shift in clinical presentation that accompanies 
transformation. By incorporating these genomic differences within a model, we found that 
FL transformation could be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity from ctDNA.
Given the clinical relevance of the reported results, further development and validation of 
our findings in larger patient cohorts will be needed. Such studies could lead to prospective 
clinical trials that test the utility of ctDNA profiling in lymphoma. In addition, we did not 
explicitly evaluate somatic copy number variants in this study, although we have previously

 shown that clinically relevant copy number changes can be sensitively detected in plasma 
(29). Targeting these aberrations in future panel designs may prove useful for DLBCL 
outcome prediction.
In summary, noninvasive genotyping and serial ctDNA monitoring are promising approaches 
for uncovering biology and improving patient management. We anticipate that ctDNA will 
have broad utility for dissecting tumor heterogeneity within and between patients with 
lymphomas and other cancer types, with applications for the identification of adverse risk 
groups, the discovery of resistance mechanisms to diverse therapies, and the development of 
risk-adapted therapeutics.

 Fig. 1. Framework for noninvasive identification of DLBCL poor-risk groups
Schematic illustrating the application of ultrasensitive ctDNA assessment for the 
identification of adverse risk in DLBCL at different disease milestones and as a navigation 
aid to remaining figures. A lymphoma patient is imagined as experiencing these disease 
milestones over time, depicted as an arrow progressing from left to right. During this 
temporal sequence, ctDNA can inform risk at diagnosis, during therapy, in surveillance of 
disease, and at progression or disease transformation, as illustrated in the corresponding 
figures associated with each milestone. At diagnosis, profiling of tumor DNA obtained from 
either tissue biopsies (indicated by a scalpel) or plasma (depicted as blood collection tubes) 
allows for the identification of patients with high tumor burden, non-GCB subtypes, and 
“double hit” lymphoma. Assessment of ctDNA during and after lymphoma treatment 
facilitates the detection of both emerging resistance mutations and minimal residual disease 
(MRD) before progression, with potential for noninvasive prediction of relapse and 
histological transformation. Tumor evolution in an anecdotal DLBCL patient is illustrated, 
showing tumor response and clonal evolution over the course of the disease (detectable 
subclones at diagnosis are shown in blue/gray; an emergent subclone after therapy is shown 
in red). The profiling of tumor DNA and ctDNA at each milestone is shown by a double-
stranded DNA molecule.

 Fig. 2. Improved noninvasive genotyping and monitoring of DLBCL tumor heterogeneity
(A) Direct comparison of CAPP-Seq with IgHTS for tumor genotyping and ctDNA 
detection in DLBCL. (B) Change of ctDNA disease burden in response to treatment and 
during clinical progression in a patient with stage IIAX DLBCL. Shown is the mean AF of 
all SNVs detected by CAPP-Seq (left y axis) and the number of lymphoma DNA molecules 
per milliliter of plasma identified by IgHTS (right y axis) over serial time points (x axis). 
The black arrows highlight ctDNA detection by CAPP-Seq, at which time ctDNA by IgHTS 
was below the limit of detection (false negative, open circles). In (A) and (B), CAPP-Seq 
and IgHTS were performed from the same specimens (tissue biopsy or blood draw). IgHTS 
was performed as part of routine clinical practice by an independent laboratory. ND, not 
detected; PR, partial response; PD, progressive disease; R-CHOP, rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone; R-DHAP, rituximab, 
dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin; SCT, stem cell transplantation; DeVIC, 
dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin. (C) Noninvasive detection of 
ibrutinib resistance mutations in BTK (C481S, arrows) in a patient with progressive 
lymphoma, reflecting two independent subclones emerging during therapy. RBL, rituximab, 
bendamustine, and lenalidomide. (D) Schematic illustrating the two acquired BTK C481S

 Fig. 3. Quantification of ctDNA in relation to DLBCL clinical indices and treatment response
(A) Relationship between LDH and ctDNA concentration from pre-treatment plasma time 
points. Correlations were determined separately above and below the upper limit of normal 
(ULN; 340 U/liter). (B) Correlation between MTV, measured from PET/CT imaging, and 
ctDNA concentrations from pretreatment plasma. Pretreatment LDH and MTV values in (A) 
and (B) were obtained as close in time as possible to blood draws used for plasma cell–free 
DNA sequencing (median, 6 days for LDH and 4 days for MTV). r, Pearson correlation 
coefficient. (C) Association between ctDNA concentration at diagnosis and Ann Arbor 
stage. Statistical comparison between early-stage (I + II) and late-stage (III + IV) patients 
was performed using Mann-Whitney U test. Means and SEMs are indicated. (D) Detection 
of ctDNA in relapsing patients as a function of time. Top: Cumulative fraction of patients 
with detectable ctDNA as a function of time before relapse. Bottom: Patient level data 
demonstrating ctDNA detection before relapse (n = 11). Clinical relapses were confirmed 
radiographically, and corresponding blood draws were taken within 30 days of diagnostic 
imaging, except for patients DLBCL088 (43 days) and DLBCL071 (78 days). All other 
blood draws were obtained between radiographic complete response and relapse (14 to 983 
days before clinical relapse). Red circle, ctDNA detected; open circle, ctDNA not detected; 
black bars, imaging studies demonstrating complete response; red bars, imaging studies

sample (n = 76), ordered on the basis of decreasing log odds scores. Bottom: COO 
classification of patients in (A) using the Hans immunohistochemistry (IHC) algorithm (n = 
59). Cases classified as GCB or non-GCB are shown in orange and blue, respectively. Empty 
spaces indicate cases with no IHC classification available. (B) PFS from diagnosis in 
DLBCL cases, as determined by the CAPP-Seq COO classifier on all analyzed DLBCL 
tumor samples (n = 50). (C) The results of applying univariate Cox proportional hazards 
regression to analyze PFS in tumor and plasma samples from DLBCL patients. HR, hazards 
ratio; CI, confidence interval. (D) PFS from diagnosis in DLBCL cases, as determined by 
Hans algorithm (n = 38). The log-rank test was used in (B) and (D) to determine statistical 
significance. n.s., not significant. (E) Concordance between COO assignments of the CAPP-
Seq classifier applied to tumor samples and applied to corresponding plasma samples (n = 
41). Primary central nervous system lymphoma and transformed lymphoma cases were 
excluded from the patient cohort for the analyses in (B) to (D).

 Fig. 5. Patterns of genome evolution in patients with histological transformation
(A) Comparison of mutation profiles from diagnostic tumor samples (“tumor 1”; FL or 
DLBCL) and follow-up tumor samples (“tumor 2”; transformation or progression) in 
patients with three distinct NHL types: tFL, ntFL, and rrDLBCL. The fraction of SNVs 
specific to tumor 2 (x axis) is compared with the proportion of SNVs shared between both 
tumors (y axis). Each dot represents a single patient. Shaded ovals highlight patients with 
different histologies, excluding outliers. (B) Network depiction of the mutational divergence 
between each tumor 1 and tumor 2 pair analyzed in (A). The central node represents tumor 
1, and the distance between tumor 1 and each patient’s tumor 2 (edge) is expressed as the 
fraction of unique mutations to both tumor 1 and tumor 2. Bar graph: percentage of SNVs 
unique to both tumor 1 and tumor 2 (nonshared mutations) for the median patient in each 
histological group. (C) Evolution of different types of NHL as determined by comparing 
diagnostic tumor samples from (A) (“tumor 1”) with follow-up plasma samples. The 
percentage of SNVs found uniquely in follow-up plasma compared to tumor 1 is shown for 
the three histologies. (D) Comparison of ctDNA concentrations in follow-up plasma samples 
from (C). Statistical comparisons in (C) and (D) were performed using the Mann-Whitney U 
test. Medians and ranges are indicated. (E) Performance metrics for the prediction of
