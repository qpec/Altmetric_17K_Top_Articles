Despite current standard of care, the average 5-year mortality after an initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is
about 40%, reflecting an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. Previous studies demonstrated that the
epigenetic reader protein bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), an emerging therapeutic target in cancer,
functions as a critical coactivator of pathologic gene transactivation during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However,
the therapeutic relevance of these findings to human disease remained unknown. We demonstrate that treatment
with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has therapeutic effects during severe, preestablished HF from prolonged
pressure overload, aswellasafter a massiveanteriormyocardial infarction in mice. Furthermore, JQ1 potently blocks
agonist-induced hypertrophy in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).
Integrated transcriptomic analyses across animal models and human iPSC-CMs reveal that BET inhibition preferentially
blocks transactivation of a common pathologic gene regulatory program that is robustly enriched for NFkB and
TGF-b signaling networks, typified by innate inflammatory and profibrotic myocardial genes. As predicted by
these specific transcriptional mechanisms, we found that JQ1 does not suppress physiological cardiac hypertrophy
in a mouse swimming model. These findings establish that pharmacologically targeting innate inflammatory
and profibrotic myocardial signaling networks at the level of chromatin is effective in animal models and human
cardiomyocytes, providing the critical rationale for further development of BET inhibitors and other epigenomic
medicines for HF.
INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality, hospitalization, and
healthcareexpenditureintheUnitedStates(1,2).Existingpharmacothera-
pies for systolic HF are b-adrenergic receptor and renin-angiotensin
axis antagonists, which dampen the excessive activity of stress neuro-
hormones produced in response to myocardial injury. However, despite
the widespread use of these disease-modifying drugs, the average 5-year
mortality rate after an initial diagnosis of HF is about 40%, which high-
lights the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches (1, 2).
In response to persistent hemodynamic and neurohormonal stress,
the myocardium undergoes pathological cell state changes character-
ized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, myofibroblast acti-
vation, and contractile dysfunction (3–6). Although cardiac remodeling
may provide short-term adaptation in certain settings, sustained or
excessive activation of this process is maladaptive and drives disease
progression (3, 4). Studies over the past two decades have established
that inhibition of specific signaling pathways that govern stress-induced
cardiac remodeling has cardioprotective effects even in the face of per-
sistent stress (4, 7). Notably, ventricular tissue remodeling is a robust
predictor of HF severity and death in patients, underscoring the de-
trimental nature of this process (3, 8–12). Together, these data support
the contention that targeting the tissue remodeling process itself can
be beneficial without compromising cardiac performance (3, 9, 11–13).
The cell state transitions that underlie pathologic cardiac remodeling
are rooted in dynamic changes in gene control (14, 15) and feature a
general state of transcriptional anabolism (3, 15). In the stressed heart,
multiple upstream signaling pathways converge on the transcription
machinery, which integrates these signals by transactivating gene
programs that alter cell state (16). Thus, blocking stress-activated signal-
ing cascades at the level of chromatin-dependent signaling represents
an attractive therapeutic strategy in HF. In response to cardiac stress,
a defined set of transcription factors coordinately binds to specific
regulatory regions of the genome. These transcription factors recruit
lysine acetyltransferases, which hyperacetylate local chromatin and
activate cis-regulatory elements (or enhancers) (16, 17). Subsequent
transactivation of distaltarget genes occurs via recruitment of epigenetic
“reader” proteins (16), such as bromodomain-containing protein 4
(BRD4) (14, 18), that bind acetyllysine via bromodomains and coacti-
vate transcription by assembling complexes that signal to RNA poly-
merase II (Pol II) (19–22). BRD4 belongs to the bromodomain and
extraterminal (BET) family of highly conserved acetyllysine recognition
proteins and hasbeen implicated inthe maintenance and progression of
cancer cell state across a broad range of malignancies (18, 23–25). The
recent development of potent, specific, and reversible BET bromodomain
inhibitors, such as the first-in-class thienodiazepine small-molecule JQ1
(23), has accelerated mechanistic discovery and translation in this field.

 JQ1 binds the bromodomains of BET proteins with exquisite shape
complementarity and nanomolar affinity, resulting in potent, compe-
titive, and transient displacement of BRD4 from acetylated chromatin
(23). Studies across a broad range of cell types demonstrate that JQ1
preferentially blocks transactivation of specific sets of genes in a dose-
dependent and context-specific manner (24). Target gene specificity
is achieved, in part, because the BRD4 coactivator protein is asym-
metrically enriched at massive cell state–specific enhancers (or super-
enhancers) (26, 27). Transcription of super-enhancer–regulated
genes is disproportionately sensitive to depletion of coactivator pro-
teins such as BRD4 (26, 28). Given the tractable therapeutic window
of JQ1 in preclinical studies, there has been intense interest in the
development of BET bromodomain inhibitors as anticancer drugs.
These translational efforts have spawned several ongoing early-phase
human cancer trials using BET bromodomain inhibitors, including
derivatives of JQ1 (29, 30).
Initial studies from our group demonstrated that BRD4 functions
as a critical coactivator of pathologic gene transactivation during car-
diomyocyte hypertrophy by a mechanism that involves recruitment
of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) activity and
pause release of Pol II (31, 32). In cultured neonatal rat ventricular
myocytes (NRVMs), small-interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated silen-
cing of BRD4 or chemical inhibition with JQ1 blocks cardinal features
of pathologic hypertrophy. In addition, early administration of JQ1 at
the very onset of pressure overload in mice prevented the development
of cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.
Although these index studies provided important mechanistic insight,
the therapeutic relevance of these early observations remained un-
known. In particular, it was not known whether BET bromodomain
inhibitors could be used to treat established HF in more clinically
relevant experimental settings. Furthermore, it was unknown whether
BETs could be therapeutically targeted in human cardiomyocytes and
whether there were common transcriptional effects of BET bromodo-
main inhibitor therapy across pathologic settings and species. Here, we
address these major knowledge gaps and identify core mechanisms of
therapeutic efficacy that are vital for directing further translation of BET
inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for heart disease.
RESULTS
BET bromodomain inhibition is effective in the treatment of
preestablished HF
Patients requiring treatment for HF typically present with preestab-
lished disease. Therefore, we first tested whether BET bromodomain
inhibition with JQ1 could treat preestablished HF in a mouse model
of LV pressure overload. We subjected adult mice to transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) or sham surgery. On postoperative day 18, a time
point when robust cardiomegaly and LV dysfunction have already
developed in this model (31), we randomized mice to receive JQ1
[50 mg/kg daily, intraperitoneally (IP)] versus vehicle and continued
out to postoperative week 8 (protocol in Fig. 1A). This dosing scheme
of JQ1 has established efficacy and tolerability in previous studies of
cancer and cardiovascular disease in mice and does not cause overt
toxicity (23, 24, 31–33). In addition, we have previously demonstrated
that JQ1 administration at these doses does not affect blood pressure
or the pressure gradient across the constricted aorta (31). In this
treatment protocol, we found that JQ1 attenuated multiple hallmark
features of HF progression in vivo, including cardiomegaly (Fig. 1B),
pulmonary edema (Fig. 1C), LV systolic dysfunction, LV cavity dilation,
LV wall thickening [Fig. 1, D to F, respectively; echocardiographic data
for the final time point (day 53) are shown in fig. S1, A to C], cardio-
myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 1G), and LV fibrosis (Fig. 1H). In addition,
JQ1 suppressed the induction of several canonical HF-associated genes
(Fig. 1I). Thus, late administration of JQ1 can treat HF even when
started at a time when there is robust, preexisting disease.
BET bromodomain inhibition is effective in the treatment of
HF after a large myocardial infarction
Although the TAC model is a widely used method for eliciting hallmark
features of HF pathogenesis, the acute onset of severe hemodynamic
overload in this model does not represent a common clinical scenario
in humans. In contrast, myocardial infarction (MI) is a very common
cause of pathologic cardiac remodeling and HF in humans (1). Further-
more, animal models of post-MI HF have served as a major gateway for
drug development, as exemplified by studies of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors in rodent preclinical studies (13) and subsequent
human clinical trials (11, 12).
We therefore asked whether JQ1 could be used to treat HF that
develops after large, transmural MI in adult mice. We subjected mice
to permanent surgical ligation of the proximal left anterior descending
(LAD) coronary artery to produce a large, dense, anterior wall MI. As
expected for this anatomically proximal level of LAD occlusion (34),
~35% of mice died in the first 5 postoperative days due to LV rupture
or overt HF, confirming the severity of this model in our hands. On
postoperative day 6, a time point when all infarctions were complete,
surviving mice were randomized to receive JQ1 versus vehicle. We
initially dosed at 25 mg/kg daily for 6 days (during the period of early
surgical recovery) and subsequently ramped up to 50 mg/kg daily
until postoperative day 28 (a time point when robust pathologic remo-
deling of the remote LV myocardium is present in this model) (protocol
in Fig. 2A) (35). Similar to our findings in the pressure overload treat-
ment model (Fig. 1), JQ1 attenuated several cardinal features of HF in
the post-MIsetting, including cardiomegaly (Fig. 2B),pulmonary con-
gestion (Fig. 2C), LV systolic dysfunction (Fig. 2D), LV cavity dilation
(Fig. 2E), wall thickening of the remote LV (posterior wall; Fig. 2F),
hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in the remote LV (Fig. 2G), and fibrosis
of the remote LV (Fig. 2H). JQ1 also suppressed pathological induction
of canonical HF-associated genes in the remote LV myocardium (Fig.
2I). It is possible that therapeutic strategies that attenuate LV remodel-
ing may also prevent normalhealing of atransmuralinfarct, particularly
in mouse models, which are predisposed to post-MI rupture (34). How-
ever, we did not observe any significant excess in mortality or LV
rupture between JQ1 and vehicle treatment groups (two mice died/
ruptured in each group from n = 12 per group after treatment initiation;
c2 = 1), suggesting that this regimen of BET bromodomain inhibition
ameliorates HF progression without overt compromise of infarct healing.
BET bromodomain inhibition suppresses transactivation of
shared gene regulatory networks across HF models
Given the therapeutic efficacy of JQ1 in two distinct HF models in vivo
(Figs. 1 and 2) and our previous observation that BRD4 regulates tran-
scriptional pause release in the heart (31), we hypothesized that there was
a common gene-control mechanism mediating these salutary effects
across disease settings. We performed transcriptomic profiling from
LV tissue using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at baseline (sham) and during
disease(TACandMI)frommicetreatedwithvehicleversusJQ1.Wefirst

 sham-JQ1–treated LV tissue. Differential expression analysis showed
that JQ1 reduced expression of 613 genes and increased expression of
125 genes in the left ventricles of sham-treated mice (volcano plot in
fig. S2A; complete expression data for all detected transcripts and dif-
ferential expression calls are providedin table S1). Gene ontology analysis
of the JQ1–down-regulated transcripts showed a strong enrichment for
innate immune activation, extracellular matrix production, and cell
adhesion (fig. S2B). The much smaller set of JQ1–up-regulated genes
revealed no major enrichment for functional terms, other than three genes
that were cataloged as containing Heat-shock protein 70 binding sites.
Because JQ1 did not alter baseline cardiac structure or function in
the sham group (Figs. 1 and 2 and fig. S1), we next turned our attention
to the global set of transcripts that were differentially expressed during
disease. Global clustering of transcriptomic profiles by principal com-
ponents analysis revealed that the two most significant sources of dif-
ferential expression across all samples were the response to stress
(such as TAC or MI) and the effect of JQ1 administration (Fig. 3A).
When comparing sham versus stress, the dominant transcriptomic
feature was global gene up-regulation (TAC, 725 genes up and 401
genes down; MI, 928 genes up and 205 genes down). These global
transcriptomic profiles are consistent with HF as a state of robust tran-
scriptional anabolism (15). For the global set of genes that were differ-
entially expressed during stress, hierarchical clustering of samples (Fig.
3B; shown above the heat maps) demonstrated that the JQ1-treated
group clustered more closely with the sham groups, reflecting broad
suppression of a pathologic state. The dominant effect of JQ1 across
disease models was to dampen the transactivation of a broad subset
of stress-inducible genes (Fig. 3B, top third of heat maps). This ob-
servation is mechanistically consistent with the function of BRD4 as
a key coactivator of enhancer-dependent transcription and effector
of Pol II pause release (26–28, 31). The inhibitory effects of JQ1 were
specific, as exemplified by a subset of stress-inducible genes that were
unaffected by JQ1 (Fig. 3B, middle third of heat maps). Finally, JQ1
had no broad effect in rescuing genes that were down-regulated with
stress (Fig. 3B, bottom third of heat maps), a finding that is also con-
sistent with the primary function of BRD4 as a transcriptional coacti-
vator. The volcano plots in Fig. 3C illustrate the potent effects of JQ1
in the dampening of stress-mediated gene induction across the TAC
and MI models (differential expression data from RNA-seq are pro-
vided in tables S2 and S3). Together, these data demonstrate that these
HF models elicit a state of robust transcriptional anabolism and that the
dominant role of JQ1 during HF therapy is to dampen the stress-
dependent transactivation of a broad but specific set of genes.
To gain further insight into the therapeutic mechanisms underlying
the efficacy of JQ1 in HF, we defined a common set of 193 genes whose
transactivation was suppressed by JQ1 in both the TAC and MI models
(see Venn diagram; Fig. 4A) (gene list is provided in table S4). Gene
ontology analysis of this common set of 193 genes revealed a strong
enrichment for specific pathophysiologic processes excessively acti-
vated in human HF (6, 36), including extracellular matrix deposition,
innate immune and inflammatory responses, and cellular growth
(Fig. 4B). We next analyzed this gene set using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (37, 38) to identify pathologic signaling networks that were
specifically blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitor therapy. These
unbiased functional analyses revealed striking enrichment for two
myocardial signaling networks that were robustly suppressed by JQ1.
First, JQ1 was found to block transactivation of genes that form a mas-
sive hub centered on transforming growth factor–b (TGF-b) signaling
(P < 1.4 × 10−76; Fig. 4C), a central regulator of pathologic cell state
transformations in the stressed myocardium (39, 40). Genes affected
in this expansive TGF-b network broadly encompassed all major com-
partments of the cell. The second observation was that the JQ1 inhibi-
tory effect was robustly enriched for genes involved in innate immune
responses (signified by the “lipopolysaccharide” term at the top level of
the network), which converged upon NFkB/RelA, AP1, and STAT1 as
terminal transcriptional effectors (P < 1 × 10−48; Fig. 4D). The robust
enrichment for TGF-b and NFkB targets in this set of JQ1-attenuated
transcripts was independently corroborated by gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) (fig. S3A). The GSEA demonstrates that genes up-
regulated in our TAC and MI models are statistically enriched for
TGF-b and NFkB targets, confirming that these signaling pathways
are activated during disease. Consistent with our Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis, GSEA demonstrated that the set of genes attenuated by JQ1
in these HF models was statistically enriched for TGF-b and NFkB
targets. To gain initial insight into myocardial cell types that might
be contributing to the transcriptional response to JQ1 during HF
pathogenesis invivo, we used fingerprinting analysis (fig. S3B)to com-
pare ourRNA-seq profileswith curated RNA-seq data sets derived from
mouse cardiomyocytes (GSE58453 and GSE68509) (41, 42), mouse car-
diac fibroblasts (GSE58453) (41), and myeloid cells (GSE57125) (43).
These analyses detected a signature for transcriptional activation of
fibroblasts in TAC/MI when compared to the sham group. There was
a detectable effect of JQ1 in attenuating the transcriptional activation
of fibroblast signature. In summary, across in vivo models of HF, BET
bromodomain inhibition with JQ1 blocks the transactivation of a shared
set of myocardial genes that encompass the coordinated output of TGF-b
signaling and proinflammatory transcription factors.
BET bromodomain inhibition does not affect physiological
cardiac growth during exercise
Chronic endurance exercise training leads to a physiological form of
cardiac growth that has been shown to provide protection against
myocardial injury (44, 45). An important distinguishing feature of
physiological versus pathological cardiac remodeling is that the former
lacks robust induction of innate inflammatory or profibrotic gene pro-
grams (45–47). Because our data in murine models showed that the
transcriptional effects of JQ1 were specifically enriched for the suppres-
sion of proinflammatory and profibrotic gene networks (Figs. 3 and 4),
we hypothesized that BET bromodomain inhibition with JQ1 might be
permissive for physiological cardiac remodeling during endurance
exercise training. To test this hypothesis, adult mice underwent a well-
established, high-intensity endurance swimming protocol in which mice
are progressively trained to swim for a total of 3 hours/day for 4 weeks
(44). Swimming versus sedentary mice were randomized to receive JQ1
(50 mg/kg per day, IP) or vehicle injections (protocol in Fig. 5A). In both
the vehicle- and JQ1-treated groups, there were similar increases in
cardiac mass (Fig. 5B), cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (Fig. 5C),
LV ejection fraction (Fig. 5D), and expression of transcripts induced
with exercise training in this model (such as Gata4 and Tnni3) (Fig.
5E and fig. S4), indicating that JQ1 treatment did not block key features
of exercise-induced cardiac plasticity. Hence, JQ1 administration to
adult mice at the doses used here can treat HF but does not suppress
exercise-induced physiological cardiac growth.
BET bromodomain inhibition blocks agonist-induced
hypertrophy in human iPSC-CMs
All previous studies of BET bromodomain inhibition in heart disease
have been performed in rodent models (31, 32). We therefore asked

 ET-1–mediated hypertrophic growth in human iPSC-CMs in a dose-
dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). Consistent with the effects on
cellular hypertrophy, qRT-PCR demonstrated that JQ1 suppressed
transactivation of NPPB/BNP (Fig. 6C) and other typical marker
genes induced in human iPSC-CMs during ET-1 stimulation (fig. S5A)
(48). Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) con-
firmed that JQ1 attenuated the ET-1–stimulated increase in BNP pro-
tein abundance (Fig. 6D).
To gain a broader insight into stress-activated gene expression
programs affected by JQ1 in human cardiomyocytes, we performed
RNA-seq in this experimental system. Similar to the murine RNA-seq
profiles (Fig. 3), a heat map of all ET-1–responsive genes in human
iPSC-CMs illustrates that the dominant effect of JQ1 was to dampen
induction of a subset of ET-1–inducible genes (265 gene subset from
a total of 615 ET-1–induced transcripts; Fig. 6E) (differential expression
data provided as table S5). Functional annotation of this 265 gene
subset revealed strong enrichment for genes involved in inflammatory
responses, cellular growth, and extracellular matrix production (Fig. 6F),
terms that paralleled the cardiac signatures from murine disease models
(Fig.4).Similartoourmurine data,Ingenuity Pathway Analysisrevealed
that this set of JQ1-responsive human genes robustly enriched for a
TGF-b signaling hub (P < 1 × 10−25; Fig. 6G) and an innate immune
transcription factor network (signified by the lipopolysaccharide termat
the top level of the network) with a strong convergence on NFkB/RelA
(P < 4 × 10−12; Fig. 6H). In addition, the robust enrichment for TGF-b
and NFkB targets in this set of JQ1-attenuated transcripts in human
iPSC-CM was independently corroborated by GSEA (fig. S5B).
Together, these data demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibition
with JQ1 blocks agonist-induced hypertrophic responses in human
iPSC-CMs in a cell-autonomous manner, with transcriptional effects
that parallel our observations in murine models.
DISCUSSION
OurdataprovideproofofprinciplethatBETbromodomaininhibition,an
emerging therapeutic strategy in a variety of human cancers (18, 23–25),
can treat preestablished HF in vivo. Our observation that nanomolar
concentrations of JQ1 block pathological hypertrophy in human iPSC-
CMssuggests that BET inhibition may also exert protective effects in the
human heart. Integrated genome-wide analyses across murine models
and human cardiomyocytes reveal that BET inhibition suppresses a
common pathologic transcriptional program that is highly enriched

 forinflammatory and profibrotic signaling effectors in the myocardium.
Because inflammation and fibrosis are central to HF pathogenesis,
molecular mediators of these processes are intently pursued therapeutic
targets (6, 49). Our current work demonstrates the efficacy of an epigen-
omically based therapeutic approach that targets inflammatory and
profibrotic cell state transitions at the level of chromatin.
Several BET bromodomain inhibitor drugs are currently being
developed in early-phase human cancer trials (29). Our work provides
impetus for next-phase testing of this class of therapeutics in large-
animal models of HF, including porcine/ovine MI models. Here, we
focused on the ability of JQ1 to ameliorate severe HF that occurs after
a complete and dense anterior wall MI. Our findings, which highlight
the beneficial effects of JQ1 on the remote/noninfarcted myocardium,
are relevant for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy in humans.
It will also be interesting to explore whether BET bromodomain in-
hibition can protect at-risk myocardium in animal models of ischemia-
reperfusioninjurywhendeliveredatthetimeofcoronaryrevascularization,
although the mechanisms of acute ischemic myoprotection in this
setting represent vastly different biological processes than the longer-
term beneficial effects on the remote LV shown here. One study has
shown that pretreatment with JQ1 in a rat model of permanent coro-
nary artery ligation can reduce biomarkers of infarct severity at 24 hours
(50), suggesting that BET bromodomain inhibition may acutely protect
ischemic myocytes during an unrevascularized MI. However, it remains
unknown whether this strategy provides longer-term benefit or is effec-
tive when administered in the perireperfusion phase. In addition to
studying acquired forms of HF, it will also be of interest to study the
role of BET proteins in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies driven
by genetic mutations (51), some of which feature extensive activation
of profibrotic and proinflammatory pathways in the heart. These lines
of investigation, guided by the results of ongoing human cancer trials,
will provide the critical foundation for developing BET bromodomain
inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in human heart disease.
Our RNA-seq data demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibitors
suppress a subset of stress-activated myocardial genes. The mechanisms
underlying the selective effects of BET bromodomain inhibition on
target genes, a phenomenon which has been observed across multiple
cell types (24, 26, 33, 52), are just beginning to be understood. An
important contributor to this selectivity is the observation that potent
coactivators suchas BRD4are asymmetrically loadedon a criticalsubset
of cell state–defining enhancers that have been termed super-enhancers,
which often regulate target genes via Pol II pause release (26–28, 33).
Super-enhancer–regulated genes are exquisitely sensitive to local deple-
tion of coactivator proteins, including BRD4, across a number of cell
types (26–28, 33, 53). Recent in vitro studies using cultured endothelial
cells (33) and NRVMs (54) have demonstrated that during pathological
stress, there is a stimulus-coupled flux of BRD4 from baseline regulatory
loci to new, stress-activated super-enhancers. In the setting of stress,
JQ1 transiently displaces BRD4 from chromatin, prevents the cell’s abil-
ity to sustain maximal activity of newly formed super-enhancers, and
preferentially dampens transcription of stress-activated gene programs
(33). The precise molecular mechanisms governing locus-specific flux
of BRD4 to these newly formed super-enhancers is not well understood
but may involve recruitment via protein interactions between BRD4
and DNA binding transcription factors (55). Our finding that the
myocardial signature of JQ1-suppressed genes is specifically enriched
for transcription pathwayscentralto inflammatory and fibrotic responses
supports a model in which specific subsets of DNA binding transcription
factors may play a key role in driving genome-wide flux of BRD4 during
stress. This feature of BRD4 signaling may partially explain why JQ1 did
not affect exercise-induced cardiac growth, a form of tissue plasticity
that does not typically involve inflammatory or profibrotic transcription
programs (45–47).
The preferential inhibitory effect of BET bromodomain inhibitors
on stress-dependent enhancer assembly may, in part, contribute to
their therapeutic window (55). The pulsatile exposure to JQ1 used here,
which has a relatively short half-life in mice (23), can dampen the as-
sembly andnet transcriptional output of stress-activated super-enhancers
in the injured myocardium. This reversible, phasic, and dose-titratable
disruption of super-enhancer–dependent transcription may be homeo-
statically accommodated in nondiseased tissues in a manner that
allows the adult mammalian organism to guard key aspects of basal
organ physiology. Consistent with this mode of action, JQ1 does not
cause overt toxicity in adult mice under the dosing protocols used in
this study (23, 24, 31, 33, 56). Furthermore, JQ1 does not cause major
changes in cardiac structure or function in mice subject to sham surgery
(31). The general tolerability of JQ1 at the doses used here is further
supported by our observation that mice receiving daily JQ1 injections
are able to complete a high-intensity, 4-week swimming protocol. How-
ever, higher doses of BET inhibitors will bring broader, sustained ex-
posure that may produce a wider range of on-target toxicity (57, 58). A
mouse model in which total BRD4 protein abundance is ubiquitously
suppressed by an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) demonstrates
that excessive levels of total BRD4 depletion result in abnormalities in
the intestinal epithelium, bone marrow, and hair follicles—all of which
are reversible after the shRNA expression is turned off (56). These
observations indicate that the major toxicity profiles of BET inhibitors
are likely to be on-target, dose-dependent, and reversible (56). Although
our studies demonstrate efficacy and tolerability of JQ1 in mouse
models, an important hurdle in next-phase preclinical efforts will be
to develop compounds and dosing/delivery schemes that have an ap-
propriate therapeutic index for large-animal models of HF. In addition,
the efficacy of BET inhibition when added on to current standard-of-
care HF regimens will need to be established. It will also be of interest
to test whether adjunctive BET inhibition can protect at-risk ischemic
myocardium when administered at the time of coronary reperfusion,
although the mechanisms of acute myoprotection in such a setting
would likely be different from the chronically beneficial effects on
remote myocardium described here. Because several potent BET in-
hibitor drugs are progressing in early-phase human cancer trials (29),
the collective first-in-human experience with this class of therapeutics
will serve as an important guide for considering cardiac and other non-
cancer applications.
An important area of mechanistic inquiry will be to further dissect
which BET family members (BRD2/3/4) and which cell types (for
example, cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts) are mediating the
therapeutic effects of small-molecule BET bromodomain inhibition
in vivo. In a previous study, specific siRNA-mediated silencing of BRD4
in cultured NRVMs was shown to phenocopy the antihypertrophic
effect of JQ1 (31). BRD4 is also the BET family member that allosteri-
cally activates the P-TEFb complex via a C-terminal CDK9-interacting
domain that is not present in BRD2 or BRD3 (19, 20, 59), which is
consistent with our observation that JQ1 suppresses Pol II pause release
in the stressed heart (31). Together, these findings strongly implicate
cardiac BRD4 as a major target of JQ1 in this context. With regard
to which particular cell types in the myocardium are being affected by
BET bromodomain inhibition, our RNA-seq studies reveal that JQ1
blocks the induction of a broad program of proinflammatory and

 profibrotic genes. These transcriptomic signatures encompass genes
that are expressed in cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, or both. Our
data in NRVMs (31) and cultured human iPSC-CMs demonstrate
that BET inhibition has cell-autonomous effects on inflammatory
and profibrotic gene programs in cardiomyocytes in vitro, suggesting
that the cardiomyocyte is a major cell target of BET inhibitors in vivo.
Recent studies also demonstrated an important role for BRD4 in hepatic
stellate cells (53), suggesting that JQ1 may also block the pathologic
activation of resident tissue fibroblasts. Our cell type fingerprinting
analysis of mouse left ventricles detected an effect of JQ1 in attenuating
the transcriptional activation of fibroblasts. Although this observation
is consistent with the ability of JQ1 to attenuate profibrotic and innate
inflammatory signaling in the heart, it does not exclude important
contributions from cardiomyocytes, immune cells, and other cells that
populate the stressed myocardium in mediating the therapeutic re-
sponse to JQ1. More precise annotation of gene- and tissue-specific
effects of BET family members will require the development of condi-
tional genetic models for Brd2/3/4, which will be important resources
for this field. Such conditional alleles, when coupled with recently
developed Cre drivers (5), will be particularly useful for interrogating
the role of BRD4 in activated cardiac myofibroblasts, a cell type that
is challenging to manipulate in vivo using viral vectors. It remains im-
portant to emphasize that Cre-lox–based conditional gene deletion is
permanentandfundamentallyverydifferentfromthechemicalbiological
approach leveraged here. Chemical probes like JQ1 transiently and re-
versibly disrupt the interaction of BET proteins with acetylated chroma-
tin in a manner that is temporally precise and dose-titratable (23, 55).
These features cannot be recapitulated by current genome-targeting or
gene-silencing approaches. Therefore, the ability to dissect gene-specific
and cell-autonomous responses in a manner that accurately reflects the
biology of these chemical probes would require future development of
both gene-specific compounds for individual BET family members and
methods for cell type–specific delivery in vivo. The recent development
of small molecules that promote reversible degradation of BET proteins
may create future opportunities to potently modulate BET function in a
more gene- and tissue-restricted manner in vivo, potentially providing
an expanded therapeutic window for this pharmacologic strategy (60).
Although the delineation of gene- and tissue-specific phenotypes is
certainly an important area of investigation, we postulate that pharma-
cologic BET bromodomain inhibitors, like many other drugs, may be
therapeutically effective in vivo because they target multiple cell types.
In broader terms, this work highlights that HF, much like cancer,
can be considered to be a disease in which there is aberrant transcrip-
tional control of cell identity (16). In the case of cancer, progressive
mutations in the genome drive transcriptional programs that cause
uncontrolled cellular expansion and dissemination (16, 18). In HF,
excessive exposure to stress signals converges on the gene regulatory
apparatus in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts to drive maladaptive cell
state transitions that culminate in progressive organ remodeling
and contractile dysfunction. In contrast to several cancer drugs that
cause cardiotoxicity (61), our data indicate that BET bromodomain
inhibitors may be a privileged class of anticancer therapeutics that
has cardioprotective properties. The therapeutic efficacy of BET inhibi-
tion in both these settings implies that cancer cells and myocardial cells
share common vulnerabilities at the level of chromatin-dependent
signal transduction from enhancers. This generalized dependence on
stimulus-coupled transcription suggests that in addition to BRD4, the
cardiac chromatin signaling machinery may contain other druggable
targets that can be exploited for HF therapy.

The overall objective of this study was to determine whether BET
bromodomain inhibition with the small-molecule JQ1 could treat HF
in well-established rodent models (TAC and MI) and attenuate ET-1–
induced pathologic remodeling in human iPSC-CMs. RNA-seq studies
were performed to assess transcriptomic effects of JQ1 in both murine
and human models in an unbiased, genome-wide manner. For murine
HF models, mice were randomized to each experimental arm and treat-
ment group. Mouse echocardiograms were analyzed by an individual
blinded to the experimental group assignment. For each experiment,
sample size reflects the number of independent biological replicates
and is provided in the figure legend. The expected effect magnitude
and SD for each experiment were guided by examples from published
literature for each model used. Using these parameters, sample size
was determined by power calculation with a = 0.05 and b = 0.80. Sta-
tistical analysis of RNA-seq data was performed in collaboration with
M. Lemieux (BioInfo) and the Gladstone Institutes Bioinformatics Core.
Animal models
All protocols concerning animal use were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of California San
Francisco and the Case Western Reserve University and conducted in
strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (62). Studies were conducted with
age-matched male C57Bl/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, catalog no.
000664). Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
pathogen-free facility with 12-hour light/dark cycle and ad libitum
access to water and standard laboratory rodent chow.
Preparation of JQ1
JQ1 was synthesized and purified in the laboratory of J. Bradner (Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute), as previously published (23). For in vivo
experiments, a stock solution [50 mg/ml JQ1 in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)] was diluted to a working concentration of 5 mg/ml in an
aqueous carrier (10% hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin; Sigma C0926)
using vigorous vortexing. Mice were injected at a dose of 50 mg/kg
given intraperitoneally once daily. Vehicle control was an equal amount
of DMSO dissolved in 10% hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin carrier so-
lution. All solutions were prepared and administered using sterile
technique. For in vitro experiments, JQ1 was dissolved in DMSO
and administered to cells at indicated concentrations using an equal
volume of DMSO as control.
Mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy and HF
All mice were male C57Bl/6J mice aged 10 to 11 weeks from The
Jackson Laboratory. Mice were placed on a temperature-controlled
small-animal surgical table to help maintain body temperature (37°C)
during surgery. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, me-
chanically ventilated (Harvard Apparatus), and subjected to thora-
cotomy. For TAC surgery, the aortic arch was constricted between
the left common carotid and the brachiocephalic arteries using a 7-0
silk suture and a 27-gauge needle, as previously described (31). Intra-
peritoneal injections of JQ1 (50 mg/kg per day) or vehicle were
administered 18 days after TAC surgery and continued until post-
operative day 53 (Fig. 1A). For MI surgery, the proximal LAD was
permanently ligated at the level of a standard anatomic landmark (left
atrial edge) using a 7-0 silk suture, as described previously (63). Oc-
clusion of arterial flow was demonstrated by ischemic color changes in

 the anterior wall of the heart. Standard three-lead electrocardiography
was performed to confirm that left coronary artery ligation has resulted
in a myocardial injury current (ST-segment elevations). Intraperitoneal
injections of JQ1 were started on postoperative day 6 (25 mg/kg per
day), increased to 50 mg/kg per day on postoperative day 12, and
continued until postoperative day 28 (Fig. 2A). For sham surgeries,
thoracotomy was performed as above, and the aorta (for TAC) or LAD
(for MI) was surgically exposed without any further intervention.
Endurance swimming model
Daily swimming exercise was carried out to induce physiological cardiac
hypertrophy, as previously described (44) with minor modifications.
Swimming exercise started in a ramp-up protocol starting at two ses-
sions of 10 min, with a 10-min increase each day until two sessions of
90 min were reached. Ninety minutes daily of swimming was continued
for the next 28 days. Injections of JQ1 (50 mg/kg per day, IP) or vehicle
started on the seventh day of this ramp-up protocol (Fig. 5A). The two
swimming sessions were separated from each other by at least 4 hours.
The temperature of the water was maintained at 31°C with a heating sys-
tem (JBJ True Temp Titanium Heating System, T3-300), and constant
flow of water was maintained by a circulation pump (JBJ OceanStream,
OS101). Mice in the sedentary group were subjected to the same water
conditionsfor 5min weekly. Allmice were closely monitored during the
training for signs of struggling or discomfort, and no mice died of
drowning during the above training protocol.
Transthoracic echocardiography
Mice were anesthetized with 1% inhalational isoflurane and imaged using
the Vevo 770 High Resolution Imaging System (FujiFilm VisualSonics
Inc.) and the RMV-707B 30-MHz probe. Measurements were obtained
from M-mode sampling and integrated electrocardiogram-gated kilo-
hertz visualization (EKV) images taken in the LV short axis at the
midpapillary level, as previously described (31, 64). LV areas and ejec-
tion fraction were obtained from high-resolution two-dimensional
measurements at the end-diastole and end-systole, as previously described
(31, 64). For the MI model, measurement of remote LV wall thickness
was performed on the inferoposterior wall.
Histological analysis
Short-axis heart sections from the mid–left ventricle were fixed in 10%
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Cardiomyocyte cross-
sectional area was determined by staining with rhodamine-conjugated
WGA (Vector Laboratories, RL-1022) and quantified as previously
described (2). Fibrosis was visualized using the picrosirius red staining
kit (Polysciences Inc.). Quantification of fibrotic area was performed as
previously described (32) with Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics).
For the MI model, assessment of remote LV histology was performed
on the inferoposterior wall.
Culture, qRT-PCR, and BNP ELISA from human iPSC-CMs
iCellhuman iPSC-CMs(CDI)were thawed andplatedon 96-wellplates
coated with fibronectin (5 mg/ml) (Sigma), as previously described (48).
Cells were plated at a density of 4.1 × 104 cells/cm2. After 48 hours in the
iCell Cardiomyocyte Plating Medium (CDI), cells were quiesced by cul-
turing in supplemented William’s E (SWE) medium [cocktail B from the
Hepatocyte Maintenance Supplement Pack (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
diluted in William’s E medium at a 1:25 dilution] for 4 days. For subse-
quent hypertrophic stimulation, quiesced iPSC-CMs were treated with or
without JQ1 (500 nM) versus DMSO for 3 hours followed by stimulation
with or without ET-1 (10 nM) (Sigma) for 18 hours. RNA was purified
and reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Cells-to-
CT kit (Life Technologies, AM1278) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.qRT-PCRforhumanNPPBandB2M(normalizer)wasper-
formedwiththeLifeTechnologiesTaqManassays(NPPB,Hs00173590_m1;
B2M, Hs000984230_m1). qRT-PCR for other human genes was per-
formed using TaqMan chemistry including FastStart Universal Probe
Master(Roche), labeledprobesfromthe UniversalProbeLibrary (Roche),
and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (list of qRT-PCR primers
and TaqMAN probes are provided in table S6). Relative expression was
calculated using the 2DDCt method with normalization to B2M expres-
sion. ELISA for BNP protein was performed on 6 ml of medium from
each well of a 96-well plate as previously published (48) using the
following antibodies: anti-proBNP capture antibody (clone 5B6; Abcam
ab13111), anti-proBNP HRP conjugate detection antibody (clone 16F3;
Abcam ab13124), and purified NT-proBNP (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
catalog no. 011-42) as a standard.
Cell area measurements for iPSC-CM
Cells cultured on 96-well plates were fixed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, then permeabilized
[PBS–Tween 20 (PBST) + 0.1% Triton X-100] for 20 min and blocked
(PBST + 5.0% horse serum) for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary
antibody against sarcomeric a-actinin (Sigma A7811) was used at a
1:800 dilution in PBST + 5.0% horse serum for 1 hour at room tem-
perature. The anti-mouse secondary antibody tagged with Alexa 488
was used at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells
were scanned on a high-content imaging platform (IN Cell Analyzer,
GE Healthcare Systems) at ×200 magnification, and quantified as pre-
viously described (48).
RNA purification and qRT-PCR from murine samples
A 10- to 20-mg piece of mouse LV tissue was collected and preserved
in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen) followed by mechanical
disruption/homogenization in PureZOL (Bio-Rad) on a TissueLyser
II (Qiagen). For the TAC model, a concentric short-axis slice of the
LV was prepared for RNA. For the MI model, a short-axis sector of the
remote, noninfarcted left ventricle (infero-posterior wall) was prepared
for RNA. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was extracted with
chloroform. RNA was then purified with Aurum purification kit (BioRad,
732-6830). qRT-PCR was performed using TaqMan chemistry including
FastStart Universal Probe Master (Roche), labeled probes from the
Universal Probe Library (Roche), and gene-specific oligonucleotide
primersonaLightCycler480system(Roche).AlistofqRT-PCRprimers
and TaqMAN probes are provided in table S6. Relative expression was
calculated using the 2DDCt method with normalization to constitutive
genes. Mouse data were normalized to Ppib.
Library preparation and next-generation sequencing
RNA isolated from mouse tissue and human iPSC-CMswere quantified
usingQubitfluorometric quantitation andassessedforqualityusingAgilent
Bioanalyzer Nano RNA Chip. For human iPSC-CM samples, the 500 nM
JQ1 treatment condition was used for RNA-seq. Samples with RNA integ-
rity number larger than 8 were considered high-quality and suitable for
RNA-seq. Library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq
Stranded Total RNA kit with Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA depletion, and the
library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Genomics Core
Facility of Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH) (paired-end,
100 base pairs, >50 M reads per sample; Rapid Run v2 flow cell).

 RNA-seq data analysis
Adapters and barcodes were trimmed, and low-quality reads were
filtered using fastq-mcf (https://code.google.com/archive/p/ea-utils/).
High-quality sequences were aligned to mm10 (mouse data) and hg38
(human data), as appropriate, with TopHat 2.0.13 (65), and assigned
to Ensembl genes and counted using “featureCounts” (66), part of the
Subread suite (http://subread.sourceforge.net/). (Note: the entry for
ENSMUSG00000092329/Gm20388 was removed from the murine
Gencode vM4 annotations we used before counting to avoid the artifac-
tual loss of other transcripts, including Acta1, within its ~4-Mb bound-
aries.) Raw counts were used as inputs to DESeq (v.1.25.0) (67) for
differential expression analysis, and Benjamini-Hochberg test was
used to control false discovery of differentially expressed genes (68).
Heat maps were generated using the Bioconductor package Heatmap
(v.1.0.8) using reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) mapped. Values
shown are log2-transformed and row-normalized. Samples were
clustered using complete linkage and Pearson correlation. Rows were
ordered (but not clustered) to highlight patterns between groups. The
Venn diagram shows the overlap of transcript IDs. DAVID (v.6.8;
https://david.ncifcrf.gov) (69) was used for functional annotation
enrichment analyses with the background universe restricted to genes
expressed in the species and tissue/cell type being interrogated. Log fold
changes were calculated between conditions and imported into the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (37) server (Qiagen) to identify pathways
with enriched differential expression. GSEA (70) was run on expression
data preranked by log2 fold change. Curated signatures of TGF-b targets
(PLASARI_TGFB1_TARGETS_10HR_UP; Broad Institute C2 data
set) and NFkB targets (NFKB_DIRECT_BU; www.bu.edu/nf-kb/
gene-resources/target-genes/) were used in the GSEA. Cell type finger-
printing consisted of summing z scores of normalized data sets for
each cell type signature (cardiomyocyte: Nppa, Nppb, Myh7, Fstl1,
Actc1, Xirp2, and Mybpc2; fibroblast: Postn, Adam12, Wisp2, Col3a1,
and Tnc; myeloid: Ly86, Ccr2, Sfpi1/Spi1, Cd80, and Itgam). The
following published RNA-seq data sets were fingerprinted as controls:
GSE68509 [n = 3 mouse cardiomyocyte (42)], GSE58453 [n = 3 each
mouse cardiomyocyte and fibroblast (41)], and GSE57125 [n = 2
cardiac macrophage precursor cells (called “B-type” cells in this pub-
lication) (43)]. All RNA-seq data sets were uploaded to Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus (GEO) (accession no. GSE96566).
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as means ± SEM unless otherwise indicated in the
figure legend. Statistical analyses of murine TAC and MI data were
performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s honest
significance difference test using GraphPad Prism Plus. Statistical
analysis of human iPSC-CM area, qRT-PCR, and BNP protein con-
centration was performed by ANOVA with Holm-Sidak correction
for multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism Plus. For all analy-
ses, P < 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical methods used
in the analysis of RNA-seq data are detailed separately above.
