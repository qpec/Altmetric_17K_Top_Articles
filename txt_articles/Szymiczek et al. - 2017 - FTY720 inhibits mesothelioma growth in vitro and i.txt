Abstract 
Background: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a very aggressive type of cancer, with a dismal prognosis and inher-
ent resistance to chemotherapeutics. Development and evaluation of new therapeutic approaches is highly needed. 
Immunosuppressant FTY720, approved for multiple sclerosis treatment, has recently raised attention for its anti-tumor 
activity in a variety of cancers. However, its therapeutic potential in MM has not been evaluated yet.
Methods: Cell viability and anchorage–independent growth were evaluated in a panel of MM cell lines and human 
mesothelial cells (HM) upon FTY720 treatment to assess in vitro anti-tumor efficacy. The mechanism of action of 
FTY720 in MM was assessed by measuring the activity of phosphatase protein 2A (PP2A)—a major target of FTY720. 
The binding of the endogenous inhibitor SET to PP2A in presence of FTY720 was evaluated by immunoblotting and 
immunoprecipitation. Signaling and activation of programmed cell death were evaluated by immunoblotting and 
flow cytometry. A syngeneic mouse model was used to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profile of FTY720 
in vivo.
Results: We show that FTY720 significantly suppressed MM cell viability and anchorage–independent growth 
without affecting normal HM cells. FTY720 inhibited the phosphatase activity of PP2A by displacement of SET protein, 
which appeared overexpressed in MM, as compared to HM cells. FTY720 promoted AKT dephosphorylation and Bcl-2 
degradation, leading to induction of programmed cell death, as demonstrated by caspase-3 and PARP activation, 
as well as by cytochrome c and AIF intracellular translocation. Moreover, FTY720 administration in vivo effectively 
reduced tumor burden in mice without apparent toxicity.
Conclusions: Our preclinical data indicate that FTY720 is a potentially promising therapeutic agent for MM 
treatment.

Background
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a neoplasm arising 
from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal, and 
pericardial cavities [1]. MM causes more than 40,000 
deaths per year worldwide [1–3]. MM development is 
primarily associated with occupational and environ-
mental exposure to carcinogenic mineral fibers, such 
as asbestos and erionite [1]. Asbestos deposition in the 
pleura promotes a chronic inflammation process that, 
over the years, leads to MM [4, 5] Despite the banning 
and/or severe restrictions implemented in the past dec-
ades, on the use of asbestos, the frequency of MM has 
remained stable for over a decade in the US, and it is 
still increasing in Europe, and in rapidly industrializ-
ing countries, such as India and China, that continue 
to use asbestos products [6–9]. The continuous rise in 
MM, occurring worldwide, may be due to several fac-
tors, including asbestos in place and the increased 
development of rural areas containing asbestos or other

mineral fibers [10–12], as well as to other carcinogens 
that cause MM in animals, and to which humans have 
been exposed [13, 14]. Moreover, we discovered a novel 
hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by a very high 
risk of MM and other cancers, caused by mutations in 
the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 associated protein-1 
(BAP1) [15–17]. We found that even a minimal exposure 
to asbestos may induce MM in germline BAP1 heterozy-
gous mice [18].
MM is a very aggressive cancer with poor prognosis 
and is refractory to most therapeutic modalities. Patients’ 
median survival is about 12–13 months from diagnosis 
[8] and is extended by only 11 weeks with the standard 
of care for pleural MM, based on the use of cisplatin/
pemetrexed combination therapy [19]. Therefore, the 
development of new therapeutic approaches with unique 
mechanisms of action against the MM malignant pheno-
type is highly needed.
FTY720 (Fingolimod, Gilenya®) is an FDA-approved 
immunosuppressant currently used in the treatment 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) [20]. The immunosuppres-
sant properties of FTY720 are mediated by its phos-
phorylated metabolite (FTY720-P), which, as analog of 
sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P), modulates S1P recep-
tor signaling leading to sequestration of lymphocytes in 
lymphoid tissues [21]. Over the last few years, several 
studies have shown that FTY720 was also effective on 
cancer-associated targets, both in vitro and in vivo, sug-
gesting its use as an innovative anti-cancer agent [22]. 
Inhibition of tumor growth by FTY720 has been shown 
in vitro and in vivo in several cancer models including: 
uterine cervical cancer [23], hematologic malignancies 
[24], hepatocellular carcinoma [25], breast [26], lung [27], 
and prostate [28] cancers. FTY720 has been also shown 
to promote chemo-sensitization in hepatocellular and 
renal cell carcinomas [29, 30], suggesting its possible 
effectiveness in combination therapies. As opposed to its 
immunosuppressant activities, the anti-cancer proper-
ties of FTY720 are known to be mainly mediated by its 
non-phosphorylated form, via inhibition of sphingosine 
kinase 1 (SphK1) and activation of the protein phos-
phatase 2A (PP2A), leading to the reduction in cell sur-
vival [24, 31, 32]. FTY720 may also modulate motility and 
invasiveness of cancer cells, however whether this prop-
erty is related to the phosphorylated or unphosphoryl-
ated form of FTY720 has not been addressed yet [26, 33, 
34].
The anti-cancer properties of FTY720 have not been 
explored in relation to MM, however, its molecular tar-
gets, SphK1 and PP2A are known to be involved in MM 
cell proliferation and survival [35–37], prompting us to 
investigate the possible anti-cancer activity of FTY720 in 
MM cells and in a syngeneic MM mouse model.
Methods
Cell cultures and compounds
Human normal mesothelial cells (HM) were obtained 
from pleural effusions of non-cancer patients (cell iden-
tity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using 
Wilms Tumor 1 (WT-1), calretinin and pancytokeratin 
as mesothelial markers [6], as well as by histopathology 
analysis by a board-certified pathologist, M.C.) and cul-
tured as described [38]. Malignant MM cell lines PPM-
MILL, PHI (originally denominated as HP3, [39]) and 
HMESO were established in tissue culture from surgi-
cally resected MM specimens as described [40]. REN 
MM cells were provided by Dr. Steven Albelda (Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). NCI-H226 and 
NCI-H2052 and NCI-H2452 MM cells were obtained 
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manas-
sas, VA, US). MM cells were routinely characterized and 
authenticated in our lab by immunostaining using anti-
bodies against mesothelial markers (see above), and in 
collaboration with Genetica DNA Laboratories (Cincin-
nati, OH, US). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC) were purchased from Cell Applications, Inc 
(San Diego, CA, US). AB1 mouse MM cells (Balb/c) were 
kindly provided by Dr. Bruce W. S. Robinson [41]. All 
MM cells were cultured in D-MEM (Corning, NY, US) 
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Gibco, 
ThermoFisher, Waltham, US), —hereinafter referred to 
as ‘complete medium’
, unless otherwise specified. HM 
cells were cultured in D-MEM supplemented with 20% 
FBS, unless otherwise specified, HUVEC were cultured 
in F-12K Medium (ATCC, VA, US), supplemented with 
0.04 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, 
Sigma-Aldrich, MO, US), 0.1 mg/ml heparin (Sigma-
Aldrich, MO, US) and 10% FBS. FTY720 and FTY720-
Phosphate (FTY720-P) were purchased from Cayman 
Chemical (MI, US). All stock solutions were prepared in 
DMSO.
Cell viability and cell death assays
Cells (1 × 103 per well) were grown in 96-well plates 
and treated in media supplemented with 1% FBS. Cell 
viability was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay (AbD 
Serotec, Raleigh, NC) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Apoptosis was assessed as phosphatidyl-
serine exposure, using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis 
kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) followed by flow cyto-
metric analysis (LSRFortessa, BD Biosciences).
Migration assay
The in vitro cell migration assay was carried out using 
Costar Transwell® permeable polycarbonate supports 
(8.0-μm pores) in 24-well plates (Corning Inc., NY, 
US). Inserts were covered with 20 μg/ml fibronectin

(Sigma-Aldrich). 1 × 105 MILL and PHI cells were first 
treated with FTY720 (2 μM) or DMSO (0.003%) in 
serum-free DMEM for 3 h, in suspension. Then 200 μl of 
cell suspension was seeded in the inserts. The cells were 
allowed to migrate toward 2% FBS DMEM for 3 h Inserts 
were then collected, and the upper chamber was carefully 
cleaned to remove un-migrated cells. Migrate cells, laying 
on the lower surface of the insert, were then stained using 
HEMA 3 staining kit (Millipore, MA, US). The migrated 
cells were visualized under light microscope and counted 
using the ImageJ software, from three images taken from 
each well. Experiment was done in duplicate and per-
formed two times.
Soft agar assay
Anchorage-independent soft agar growth experiments 
were carried out in triplicates, in 6-well plates. The 
base agar layer contained 0.8% agar in complete culture 
medium, the upper layer contained 4 × 103 cells per 
well seeded in 0.4% agar, dissolved in complete culture 
medium. Two millilitre of complete medium containing 
vehicle (0.01% DMSO) or 2 μM FTY720 treatment were 
added on the top of each well and were replaced every 
3 days. The number and size of colonies were deter-
mined after 4–6 weeks of culture. All colonies larger than 
0.1 mm in diameter were counted using the ImageJ soft-
ware (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
PP2A enzymatic activity assay
PP2A activity was measured using the PP2A immunopre-
cipitation phosphatase assay kit (Millipore, CA), accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the cells 
were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7, 
2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 µM PMSF, and protease 
inhibitors). Total protein concentration was determined 
using BCA Assay (Pierce Biotechnology, ThermoFisher). 
Lysates (200 µg) were incubated with 1 µg/ml anti-PP2A 
(C subunit, clone 1D6), or with IgG2bk as control, fol-
lowed by incubation with protein A agarose at 4 °C for 
2 h with constant rocking. The immunoprecipitates were 
washed 3 times with washing buffer and incubated with 
the PP2A substrate threonine phosphopeptide (final 
concentration 750 μM) for 10 min at 30 °C in a shaking 
incubator. At the completion of incubation, 25 μl of the 
reaction mixture were transferred to 96-well microtiter 
plate and free phosphate generated by the PP2A substrate 
dephosphorylation was detected by addition of the Mala-
chite Green Phosphate Detection Solution and by meas-
uring absorbance at 650 nm.
Sphingosine kinase assay
SphK1 activity was measured with the sphingosine kinase 
activity assay kit (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) 
according to the manufacturer instructions. MM cells 
where treated with 6 µM FTY720 or vehicle for 24 h and 
cell lysates were collected for the assay. ATP consumption 
due to SphK1 substrate phosphorylation was measured 
after 1.5 h of enzymatic reaction. Addition of 0.5% Triton 
to the lysis buffer ensured inhibition of SphK2 activity [42].
Immunoblotting
Total cell protein extracts were prepared using M-PER™ 
Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher, 
Waltham, MA) and quantified with Bio-Rad Protein 
Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The proteins were sepa-
rated on a 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel, transferred 
to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 
probed with antibodies overnight. Pierce™ ECL west-
ern blotting substrate was used for detection. Densitom-
etry analysis was conducted with Image J software (NIH, 
Bethesda, MD). The antibodies used were: caspase-3, 
PARP, pERK Tyr204, pAKT Ser473, total AKT, Lamin, 
VDAC (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), Bcl-
2, ERK1/2, α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, 
TX), PP2AC clone 1D6 and GAPDH (EMD Millipore).
Isolation of cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus
For the separation of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic 
fractions cells were collected in homogenization buffer 
(20 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM 
MgCl2, 1 mM bisodium EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, sucrose) 
and gently disrupted by 22-gauge needle aspiration. 
Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 min at 
4 °C to separate nuclei and unbroken cells, then super-
natants were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 20 min in 4 °C 
to recover mitochondria. The pellets containing mito-
chondria were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation 
assay buffer (RIPA) and the supernatants containing the 
cytoplasmic fraction were concentrated using Amicon 
Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter (EMD Millipore).
For the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic frac-
tions, cell pellets were re-suspended in 400 μl of hypo-
tonic buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM 
EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF) 
and incubated on ice for 15 min, to allow cell swelling. 
25 μl of 10% NP-40 was added and samples were homog-
enized and the homogenates were centrifuged for 30 s 
at 14,000×g in 4 °C. Supernatants (cytosolic fraction) 
were collected and nuclear pellets were washed with 
PBS and centrifuged to remove cytoplasmic contamina-
tion. Nuclei were finally resuspended in hypotonic buffer 
(20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 
1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF), incubated on ice 
for 30 min, vortexed every 5 min, and then centrifuged 
at 16,000×g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected as 
nuclear homogenates.

Balb/c mouse syngeneic MM model
Eight-week-old Balb/c mice (Taconic Biosciences, Hud-
son, NY), maintained in accordance with guidelines of 
the University of Hawaii Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee, were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 
AB1 cells (105 cells/mouse). Tumors were detected on day 
7 and mice were randomized into 2 groups (n = 15) to 
receive: FTY720 10 mg/kg or vehicle (2% DMSO solution 
in water) intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a 5-day-on, 2-day-off
 
schedule. This FTY720 dosage is largely used in mouse 
cancer models (e.g. [23]), and was chosen according to 
safety and toxicity data disclosed by Novartis. Tumor vol-
ume (cm3) was measured using the formula: π/6 × larger 
diameter × (smaller diameter)2, as previously reported 
[43].
Results
FTY720 selectively suppresses MM cell viability 
and anchorage–independent growth without affecting 
normal mesothelial cells
We assessed cell viability after 48 h treatment with 
increasing concentrations of FTY720 (0.5–10 μM) in 
a panel of human MM cells and in three HM cultures. 
FTY720 caused a significant decrease in cell viability of 
all MM cells tested in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a), 
while no significant changes of viability were observed in 
HM (Fig. 1b).
To further verify the potential anti-cancer effect of 
FTY720 in MM, we performed soft agar colony forma-
tion assay on MM cells exposed to 2 µM FTY720 or vehi-
cle for 4–6 weeks. The number of colonies that developed 
in FTY720-treated cells was significantly lower com-
pared to cells that received only vehicle (P = 0.0145 for 
REN cells; P = 0.0006 for PHI cells). Similarly, the size 
of FTY720-treated colonies was also significantly smaller 
compared to those that developed in cells treated with 
vehicle (P < 0.0001 for both cell lines) (Fig. 1c, d).
FTY720 inhibits migration and invasion of some cancer 
cell types [26, 33, 34]. Therefore, we investigated whether 
FTY720 treatment would alter the migratory properties 
of MM cells. Three-hour treatment with 2 μM FTY720 
did not alter migration of MM MILL and PHI cells (Addi-
tional file 1: Figure S1).
As some FTY720 functions, including its ability to 
modulate cell migration, have been ascribed to its 
phosphorylated metabolite, FTY720-P, we also treated 
MM cells for 48 h with increasing concentrations of 
FTY720-P. FTY720-P compound was biologically active,

independent growth was evaluated in REN and PHI cells upon treatment with 2 µM FTY720 or vehicle. The graphs represent the average number 
(left) and size of colonies (right) in three independent experiments, expressed as the percentage of vehicle. d Pictures representative of FTY720- or 
vehicle-treated REN cells are shown (original magnification 40×)

as indicated by its ability to induce phosphorylation of 
ERK in both MM and HUVEC cells in our control assay 
(Additional file 2: Figure S2A) [44]. However, treatment 
with FTY720-P did not suppress MM cell viability (Addi-
tional file 2: Figure S2B).
These results suggested that the non-phosphorylated 
form of FTY720 is effective, and selective, in reduc-
ing MM growth in vitro, at the same concentrations as 
observed in other cancer cells [45].
FTY720 reactivates the tumor suppressor PP2A in MM
The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase PP2A and the 
pro-survival kinase SphK1, are key targets of FTY720 [32, 
46]. We investigated whether these proteins are deregu-
lated in MM and whether the observed anti-cancer 
effects of FTY720 in MM are mediated by these proteins.
In order to study the possible effects of FTY720 on 
PP2A in MM, we first investigated the status of PP2A 
and measured the activity levels of PP2A in three MM 
cell lines. We found that the PP2A activity was sig-
nificantly lower in MM cells, as compared to HM cells 
(Fig. 2a), suggesting that the tumor suppressor func-
tions of PP2A are impaired in MM. However, no dif-
ferences were detected in the protein levels of PP2A 
between MM cells and HM (Fig. 2b). The nuclear 
oncogene SET and cancerous inhibitor of protein 
phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) are endogenous inhibitors of 
PP2A activity [47]. Therefore, we investigated the lev-
els of SET and CIP2A in a panel of MM cells and HM 
by immunoblotting. We found that all six MM cell lines 
tested showed significant elevation in SET and CIP2A 
protein levels compared to HM (Fig. 2b). These data 
suggested that PP2A deregulation by its inhibitors may 
contribute to the malignant phenotype of MM. Because 
PP2A is a target of FTY720, we investigated whether 
FTY720 may influence PP2A activity in MM cells. We 
found that, upon treatment with FTY720, PP2A phos-
phatase activity was significantly increased (Fig. 2c), 
indicating that FTY720 may reactivate the tumor sup-
pressor functions of PP2A in MM. It has been reported 
that SET directly binds and inhibits PP2A [48], and 
that FTY720 reactivates PP2A via displacement of 
Fig. 2 PP2A is inhibited in MM and FTY720 reactivates it. a Quantification of PP2A activity in indicated MM and HM cells was performed using a 
PP2A-specific enzymatic activity assay. Results are expressed as percentage of PP2A activity, as compared to PP2A activity detected in HM cells. 
Mean and SD of 3 replicates of a representative experiment, out of three performed, are given. b Representative western blot analysis of PP2A, SET 
and CIP2A protein levels in 6 human MM cell lines and 3 HM cultures. Levels of α-tubulin were detected as loading control. c Quantification of PP2A

vehicle control, for each cell line separately. Means and SD of 3 replicates of a representative experiment, out of three performed, are given. d PP2A 
was immunoprecipitated from MILL and PHI cell cultures untreated or treated with FTY720 (6 µM) or vehicle for 8 and 24 h. Immunoprecipitates 
were probed with anti-SET antibody (upper panel) and anti-PP2A antibody, as loading control (lower panel). Relative densitometric analysis data, for 
SET protein levels, normalized to PP2A protein levels, are shown
 Page 6 of 11
Szymiczek et al. J Transl Med  (2017) 15:58 
SET from the PP2A complex [24, 46]. We performed 
immunoprecipitation of PP2A and detected SET in the 
immune-complexe from MM cells treated with FTY720 
or vehicle. Our results indicated that FTY720 treatment 
resulted in displacement of SET from the PP2A complex 
in MM (Fig. 2d). Moreover, SET protein expression lev-
els were not modulated upon FTY720 treatment (Addi-
tional file 3: Figure S3), indicating that the lower levels 
of SET found in the immunoprecipitation resulted from 
decreased binding of SET to PP2A. CIP2A levels were 
also unchanged, indicating that FTY720 does not mod-
ulate the expression levels of these PP2A inhibitors in 
MM (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
To further investigate the anti-cancer effect of FTY720 
in MM, we examined SphK1, another target of FTY720 
that was shown to be overexpressed in MM [35]. We 
found that FTY720 significantly reduced SphK1 kinase 
activity in MM cells (Additional file 4: Figure S4).
Altogether, these data indicated that FTY720 is effec-
tive in inhibiting MM growth and this mechanism is, at 
least in part, mediated by re-activation of PP2A tumor 
suppression function via SET inhibitor displacement and 
suppression of SphK1 activity.
FTY720 induces programmed cell death in MM cells
Both SphK1 and PP2A have pleiotropic activities and 
modulate a large number of downstream effectors. 
Among these, a critical effector regulated by both SphK1 
and PP2A is the AKT kinase [49, 50]. AKT is involved in 
the balance between cell survival and death via its inter-
action with members of the Bcl-2 family [51, 52].
Notably, upon treatment with FTY720, levels of phos-
phorylated (Ser473) AKT gradually decreased in a time–
dependent manner, while total AKT levels remained 
constant, suggesting inactivation of this kinase (Fig. 3a), 
Bcl-2 protein levels decreased in a time–dependent man-
ner, with a longer kinetics starting 9 h after FTY720 
treatment, while the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein 
Bax remained stable (Fig. 3a).
The reduction of AKT phosphorylation associated 
with the reduction of Bcl-2 levels as well as the high Bax/
Bcl-2 ratio suggested that FTY720 could induce apop-
tosis in MM cells. The levels of PARP and caspase–3 
cleaved forms increased upon FTY720 treatment, in 
time- and dose–dependent manner (Fig. 3b; Additional 
file 5: Figure S5A). We then performed annexin V (AV) 
and propidium iodide (PI) staining. Upon FTY720 
Fig. 3 FTY720 induces programmed cell death in MM cells. a MILL cells were treated with 6 µM FTY720 and the levels of phosphorylated AKT 
(Ser473), total Bcl-2 and Bax proteins were assessed by immunoblot analysis at indicated time-points. Levels of α-tubulin were detected as loading 
control. b Activation of PARP and caspase-3 was evaluated in REN cells by immunoblot analysis after treatment with 6 µM FTY720 at indicated time 
points. Arrows indicate caspase-3 and PARP cleaved forms. c–e Cyt-c and AIF release in PHI cells were assessed by immunoblot analysis. Cells were 
treated with 6 µM FTY720 or vehicle for 12 and 24 h. Fractionation was performed as described in the “Methods” section. VDAC, lamin and α-tubulin 
were used as controls of loading and fractions’ purity. Numbers above blotting figures indicate the band densitometric analysis data, relative to load-
ing control. Figures show results from one experiment representative of two independently performed. All immunoblot experiments were repeated 
with two other MM cell lines with comparable results

treatment, the percentage of both early apoptotic cells 
and late apoptotic cells increased (average increase of 
about 9 and 11% respectively) (Additional file 5: Figure 
S5B). Moreover, FTY720 caused a progressive decrease 
of the proteins cytochrome C (Cyt-c) and the apopto-
sis inducing factor (AIF) in the mitochondrial fraction 
(Fig. 3c) with subsequent increase of Cyt-c and AIF in 
the cytoplasm (Fig. 3d), and of AIF in the nuclear frac-
tion (Fig. 3e).
Altogether, our data indicate that FTY720 treatment 
is associated with Bcl-2 degradation, activation of PARP 
and effector caspase 3 and with translocation from the 
mitochondria of Cyt-c and AIF, known events of the cas-
pase–dependent and possibly also caspase–independent 
programmed cell death pathways.
FTY720 is an effective inhibitor of tumor growth in a MM 
syngeneic mouse model
In parallel, we investigated the anti-cancer potential of 
FTY720 in vivo. Since FTY720 is an immunomodula-
tory agent, we evaluated its efficacy and toxicity using a 
syngeneic mouse MM model. Balb/c mice bearing sub-
cutaneous AB1 [53] tumors of 5 mm in diameter were 
randomized to receive treatment with 10 mg/kg dose of 
FTY720 or vehicle.
The response of AB1 mouse cells to FTY720 was first 
tested in vitro by Alamar Blue assay. FTY720 effectively 
reduced viability of AB1 cells with GI50 = 5 µM (Fig. 4a). 
Signaling downstream of FTY720 treatment in AB1 was 
also assessed (Additional file 6: Figure S6). We found that 
FTY720 induces similar effects in AB1 mouse MM cells,

upon 48 h of treatment with indicated FTY720 doses. b–d Balb/c mice inoculated subcutaneously with AB1 mouse cells were treated with 10 mg/

as compared to human MM cells, including SET dis-
placement from PP2A complex (Additional file 6: Figure 
S6A), reduction of p-AKT (Ser473) and Bcl-2, and induc-
tion of caspase-3 cleavage (Additional file 6: Figure S6B).
In mice, fifteen doses of FTY720 were administered by 
i.p. injection on a 5-days-on, 2-days-off schedule. Upon 
this treatment regimen, we did not observe significant 
weight loss (Fig. 4b), or changes in grooming, posture, 
hydration, stools and social behaviors. Moreover, no 
spleen size enlargement, or discoloration or any other 
morphological abnormalities of internal organs were 
observed, indicating that the drug was well tolerated in 
immune-competent mice at the dosage applied.
Tumor size was measured every 3 days and all mice 
were sacrificed on day 24, when tumors in the control 
group reached the limit of 2 cm in size, as per our Uni-
versity of Hawaii IACUC regulations. Tumor weight was 
determined immediately after tumor removal. FTY720, 
at 10 mg/kg dose, significantly inhibited tumor volume 
by 60% average at treatment end-point (P = 0.0009) 
(Fig. 4c). The average tumor weight was also significantly 
lower in FTY720–treated mice (P = 0.0065) (Fig. 4d).
Altogether, our data in vivo demonstrated that FTY720 
is effective in reducing MM tumor growth without caus-
ing significant toxicity, supporting its potential as an 
effective anti-cancer agent in MM.
Discussion
MM has a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of 
about 1 year. The current mainstays of MM therapy are 
represented by surgery—mostly palliative, and platinum-
based chemotherapy combined with pemetrexed [54]. 
Recently, the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor bev-
acizumab resulted in a marginal increase in overall sur-
vival [55]. Novel therapeutic agents are therefore needed 
to tackle this deadly disease.
The development of new therapeutic agents for rare 
cancers, such as MM, is hampered by the increasing costs 
of research and drug development from the laboratory to 
the patient’s bed [56]. Drug repurposing, which involves 
finding new uses for existing drugs that are outside the 
scope of their original indication, is a strategy that drasti-
cally reduces time and costs to bring a new drug to the 
market.
The anti-neoplastic properties of FTY720 are well 
established and evidences for repurposing this agent 
have been recently proposed [22]. Effects of FTY720 as a 
single agent or in combination with chemotherapy have 
been shown in a wide variety of cancer models, such 
as leukemia, colorectal, lung, brain and breast cancers 
[22]. So far, the efficacy and mode of action of FTY720 
in MM, has not been thoroughly investigated. In this 
study we show that FTY720 effectively reduced MM 
growth both in vitro and in vivo as a single agent. Our 
data indicate that, in MM, FTY720 significantly inhib-
ited the enzymatic activity of the oncogene SphK1 and 
reactivated the tumor suppressor activity of PP2A, sug-
gesting that FTY720 anti-tumor activity may be exerted 
via modulation of these effectors. SphK1 has been previ-
ously reported to be upregulated in MM [35]. Here we 
show that MM cells exhibit PP2A inactivation, associ-
ated with overexpression of PP2A inhibitory proteins 
SET and CIP2A, indicating that PP2A may be involved in 
MM malignancy. Indeed, animal studies have shown that 
inactivation of PP2A by the SV40 small-t tumor antigen 
is required for SV40-mediated transformation of primary 
human mesothelial cells in tissue culture and for SV40-
induced MMs in hamsters [57–59]. A number of stud-
ies indicate that alterations of PP2A and SphK1 (namely, 
inhibition of the former and overexpression of the latter) 
cooperate in the activation of pro-survival pathways in 
cancer [60–62]. Here we show that FTY720 caused inhi-
bition of AKT phosphorylation and reduced the levels 
of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, leading to programmed 
cell death. Overall our mechanistic data provide a solid 
rationale for the therapeutic efficacy of FTY720 observed 
in MM.
Since the discovery of its potent anticancer activity, 
repurposing of FTY720 is being considered for cancer 
patient treatment [22, 56]. Efficacy and bio-safety profiles 
of FTY720 are well described in multiple sclerosis (MS) 
patients [63]. In cancer therapy applications, its possible 
undesired effects and the interference of its immuno-
suppressive activities are recognized [22, 56]. Toxicity 
and efficacy trade-offs are not straightforward in cancer 
treatment: the actual toxicity associated with the use of 
a drug depends on many factors including the duration 
and treatment regimen, as well as patient characteristics, 
such as tumor staging, age and other co-morbidity fac-
tors. However, in highly aggressive and resistant cancers, 
such as MM, the survival benefits obtained administer-
ing an effective anticancer drug, may outweigh the risks 
of toxicity. A recent meta-analysis study of safety and 
toxicity of FTY720, designed to investigate its potential 
use in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, sug-
gested that this drug has an acceptable risk to benefit 
ratio, given its lack of bone marrow toxicity and rela-
tively low rate of serious side effects [64]. In future, bio-
marker studies aimed to identify those patients that may 
be more likely to benefit from FTY720 therapy, would 
help target this drug to a selected patient subpopulation, 
where benefits outweigh risks [65–67]. To note, the side 
effects of FTY720 are reversible upon treatment with-
drawal, at least at the doses used in MS patients [68], 
therefore, a design of a specific on/off schedule may miti-
gate the adverse effects. Moreover, a number of different 
 Page 9 of 11
Szymiczek et al. J Transl Med  (2017) 15:58 
strategies are being developed to minimize FTY720 side 
effects, such as nanoparticle delivery, combination ther-
apies and design of new derivatives of FTY720. Most 
importantly, the adverse effects of FTY720 are attributed 
to its phosphorylated isoform, FTY720-P, while the anti-
cancer effects, exerted via interaction with targets, such 
as SET-PP2A and SphK1, have been specifically associ-
ated with the unphosphorylated form of FTY720 [32, 
46]. Accordingly, unphosphorylatable second-generation 
derivatives of FTY720 have been developed and are being 
extensively studied in preclinical cancer models (e.g. 
OSU-2S0 [69]). As compared to FTY720, these appear 
to possess a stronger anti-cancer effect, while lack-
ing systemic immunosuppressive properties [69]. Such 
derivatives should eliminate concerns related to immune 
suppression and represent a novel promising therapeutic 
strategy for MM.
Conclusions
Our data represent a proof of principle for the efficacy of 
FTY720 in MM therapy, with no apparent toxicity in our 
mouse model. FTY720 and its second-generation deriva-
tives, potentially fit the criteria for drug repurposing and 
can be promising anticancer agents for the treatment of 
MM, most likely, in combination with existing or novel 
therapies.
