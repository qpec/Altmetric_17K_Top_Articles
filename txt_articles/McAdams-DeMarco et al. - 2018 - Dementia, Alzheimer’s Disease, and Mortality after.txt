Abstract
Background and objectives Older patients with ESKD experience rapid declines in executive function after
initiating hemodialysis; these impairments might lead to high rates of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in this
population. We estimated incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of diagnosis with dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease among older patients with ESKD initiating hemodialysis.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We studied 356,668 older (age $66 years old) patients on
hemodialysis (January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2013) from national registry data (US Renal Data System) linked to
Medicare. We estimated the risk (cumulative incidence) of diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and
studied factors associated with these disorders using competing risks models to account for death, change in
dialysis modality, and kidney transplant. We estimated the risk of subsequent mortality using Cox proportional
hazards models.
Results The 1- and 5-year risks of diagnosed dementia accounting for competing risks were 4.6% and 16% for
women, respectively, and 3.7% and 13% for men, respectively. The corresponding Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis
risks were 0.6% and 2.6% for women, respectively, and 0.4% and 2.0% for men, respectively. The strongest
independent risk factors for diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease were age $86 years old (dementia:
hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.04 to 2.18; Alzheimer’s disease: hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence
interval, 1.97 to 2.25), black race (dementia: hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.67 to 1.73; Alzheimer’s
disease: hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.71 to 1.85), women (dementia: hazard ratio, 1.10; 95%
confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.12; Alzheimer’s disease: hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.16), and
institutionalization (dementia: hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 1.39; Alzheimer’s disease:
hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.15). Older patients on hemodialysis with a diagnosis of
dementia were at 2.14-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.07 to 2.22) higher risk of subsequent mortality; those
with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease were at 2.01-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.89 to 2.15) higher
mortality risk.
Conclusions Older patients on hemodialysis are at substantial risk of diagnosis with dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease, and carrying these diagnoses is associated with a twofold higher mortality.

Introduction
Dementia, a state of persistent and progressive cog-
nitive impairment (1), is the leading cause of disability
and dependence worldwide (2–4). In the general
population, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common
dementia subtype, accounting for approximately one
half of patients with dementia (1), and it is the sixth
leading cause of death in the United States (5). As life
expectancy increases, there is an exponential increase
in both the prevalence and costs of dementia (4,6,7).
Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are associated with
higher mortality (8–10), and it is projected that, by
2050, 1.6 million or 43% of older adult deaths will be
due to Alzheimer’s disease. In public perception,
dementia is the most feared age-related disorder
resulting from the loss of independence and declining
quality of life associated with this disorder (11).
Furthermore, dementia complicates clinical shared
decision-making processes, especially for life-sustaining
treatments, like hemodialysis (12).
There has been a continuous increase in the number
of older adults (age $65 years old) initiating hemo-
dialysis in the United States, and in 2014, 49.6% of
patients initiating hemodialysis were older adults
(13). Additionally, patients undergoing hemodialysis
are living longer; the number of patients on hemodi-
alysis ages 85 years old and older has increased from
5073 in 1996 to 24,231 in 2014 (13).
These older patients on hemodialysis are likely at
high risk of developing and being diagnosed with
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease given that they have
worse cognitive function than the general population

 (14,15), have a greater burden of white matter disease and
cerebral atrophy (16), experience significant decline in
cognitive function while undergoing hemodialysis (17),
and have a high burden of cognitive impairment even at
younger ages (17–19). Executive function is the domain of
cognition most affected by hemodialysis within the first
2 years after initiation (18), and impairments in executive
function are early signs of dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease (20,21).
Among older patients with ESKD initiating hemodialy-
sis, we sought to (1) estimate the risk of incident diagnosis
of dementia and the Alzheimer’s disease subtype of de-
mentia, (2) identify prehemodialysis predictors of incident
diagnosis of all-cause dementia and the Alzheimer’s
disease subtype of dementia, and (3) compare the risk of
subsequent mortality between older patients on hemodi-
alysis who were diagnosed with any dementia or the
Alzheimer’s disease subtype of dementia and those who
were not.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We identified 608,988 older (age $66 years old) patients
with ESKD in the US Renal Data System (USRDS), a
national registry of all patients with ESKD in the United
States, who initiated hemodialysis between January 1, 2001
and December 31, 2013. The USRDS included the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 2728 Medical
Evidence Report Form and was linked to Medicare claims
data. This study was limited to participants with Medicare
as the primary payer as identified through the Medicare En-
rollment Database. We excluded those without Medicare Part
A and B (n=215,446) after hemodialysis initiation, those
with prevalent diagnosis with dementia at the time of
hemodialysis initiation on the basis of a 1-year look back
(n=18,331), those with incomplete data or missing a
Medical Evidence Report (n=16,928), and those without
follow-up (n=1615). We ascertained patient characteristics,
dialysis factors, and comorbid conditions from the Medical
Evidence Report and USRDS data as well as a 1-year look
back in Medicare claims data for 356,668 older patients
with ESKD initiating hemodialysis (Supplemental Appen-
dix 1). As is standard with USRDS data, mortality was
augmented through linkage with the Social Security Death
Master File and CMS data. This study was reviewed by the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review
Board, and it was determined to qualify for an exemption
under the Code of Federal Regulations, Protection of
Human Subjects (45 CFR 46.10[b]), because the study
participants cannot be identified directly or through linked
identifiers.
International Classification of Disease–Reported Diagnosed
Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease
Similar to other studies (22–27), we identified incident
diagnosis with dementia (331.0, 331.1, 331.2, 331.7, 290.0,
290.1, 290.10, 290.11, 290.12, 290.13, 290.20, 290.21, 290.3,
290.40, 290.41, 290.42, 290.43, 294.0, 294.1, 294.8 [294.20
after 2012], 797) and diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease
(331.0) using a validated International Classification of
Disease 9 (ICD-9) code algorithm. A previous publication
reported the sensitivity and specificity of these ICD-9
claims in Medicare claims data for older adults primarily
without ESKD as 0.85 and 0.89, respectively, for dementia
and 0.64 and 0.95, respectively, for Alzheimer’s disease
(22). However, these claims have not been validated among
patients with ESKD. Incident diagnosis with dementia after
hemodialysis initiation was ascertained through a 1-year
look back; patients with a claim for dementia in the year
before hemodialysis initiation were excluded. Therefore,
all results should be interpreted as documentation of
a diagnosis with dementia rather than development of
dementia.
Predictors of Diagnosis with Dementia and Alzheimer’s
Disease
Potential predictors of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
diagnosis included patient characteristics (age, sex, race,
ethnicity, body mass index, and employment status),
dialysis factors (cause of ESKD, year of hemodialysis
initiation, and eGFR$15 ml/min per 1.73 m2), comorbid-
ities (cancer, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular
disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack, atherosclerotic
heart disease, alcohol dependence, and tobacco use),
and measures of functional status (inability to ambulate,
institutionalized, and needing activities of daily living
assistance) from the 2728 form as well as a 1-year look back
in Medicare claims data.
Statistical Analyses
Risk of Diagnosis with Dementia and Alzheimer’s
Disease. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to estimate
the incidence rates of diagnoses with dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease and Cox proportional hazard regres-
sion models to identify risk factors for incident diagnosis
with dementia, censoring for end of follow-up (December
31, 2013), end of Medicare coverage, change in dialysis
modality, kidney transplantation, or mortality. The final
multivariable model was selected on the basis of optimal
parsimony by minimizing the Akaike Information
Criterion.
Competing Risk Model. Estimating the cumulative in-
cidence of diagnosis with dementia for older patients with
ESKD initiating hemodialysis is complicated by the com-
peting risks of death, change in the type of kidney re-
placement therapy, and kidney transplantation. Therefore,
we estimated the cumulative incidence of diagnosis with
dementia and associations between the predictors and
diagnosis with dementia using a competing risks survival
regression on the basis of Fine and Gray proportional
subhazards model (28). Using this method, we estimated
and plotted the cumulative incidence function (i.e., the risk
of being diagnosed with dementia by a given time as we
have previously published) (27). We then calculated the
lifetime risk of diagnosis with dementia by sex using
methods that were developed to estimate the lifetime risk
of diagnosis with dementia in prospective cohort studies
(29) (i.e., the risk of diagnosis with dementia after a patient
initiates hemodialysis during his or her lifetime) account-
ing for mortality, change in dialysis modality, and kidney
transplant. By using a competing risks approach, this
method for estimating the standardized lifetime risk of
diagnosis with dementia adjusts the cumulative incidence
1340
Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology
 for the mortality, change in dialysis modality, and kidney
transplant experience, and it is interpreted as the remaining
lifetime risk of being diagnosed with dementia conditional
on survival to dialysis initiation free of dementia diagnosis.
This method accounts for both the higher incidence of
diagnosis with dementia with age and the decrease in life
expectancy seen with age, resulting in a relatively in-
variant estimate of the lifetime risk in older patients on
hemodialysis (29). A total of 356,668 older patients with
ESKD initiating hemodialysis free of dementia diagnosis
were followed for up to 13 years to estimate the lifetime risk
of diagnosis with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. This
estimate is interpreted as remaining lifetime risk of being
diagnosed with dementia over 13 years of follow-up given
dementia diagnosis-free survival to dialysis initiation ad-
justing for the competing risk of mortality, change in
dialysis modality, and kidney transplantation. This measure
provides a useful public health statistic for resource plan-
ning and patient education on the true risk of the disease
(29). We used a similar approach to study diagnosis with
Alzheimer’s disease.
Mortality
after
Diagnosis
with
Dementia
and
Alzheimer’s Disease. We then estimated the hazard ratio
(HR) of mortality associated with diagnosis with dementia
using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. We
considered diagnosis with dementia as time-varying ex-
posure: older patients on hemodialysis contributed person
time to the nondementia group until the diagnosis of
dementia, and then, they contributed person time to the
dementia group until mortality, change in kidney replace-
ment therapy, kidney transplantation, or administrative
censoring (September 16, 2015). We also tested whether the
risk of mortality differed by age, sex, race, and diabetes; we
pulled the stratified associations from the Cox proportional
hazards models and estimated them using the lincom
command in Stata. We used a similar approach to quantify
the association between diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease
and mortality.
General Statistical Analyses. Analyses were performed
using Stata 14.0; remaining lifetime risk from the Practical
Incidence Estimator macro (SAS 9.4) that was developed
for the estimation of lifetime diagnosis with dementia risk
using a competing risks framework in the Framingham
cohort was performed as previously described (29). A
significance level of 0.05 was used, and all hypotheses
tested were two sided.
Results
Study Population
Among 356,668 older patients with ESKD initiating
hemodialysis, mean age was 76 (SD=7) years old, 47%
were women, and 20% were black. The median follow-up
time was 1.3 years (interquartile range, 0.5–2.8 years;
maximum =13 years); 63,303 (18%) were diagnosed with
dementia during study follow-up, and of those with a
diagnosis of dementia, 13,897 (22%) were diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease subtype of dementia (Table 1). Char-
acteristics stratified by age are presented in Supplemental
Appendix 2. The incidence rate was 90.8 (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 90.1 to 91.5) per 1000 person-years for
diagnosis with dementia and 18.2 (95% CI, 17.9 to 18.5) per
1000 person-years for diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease.
During follow-up, 239,203 deaths occurred (67%), and 6405
(2%) received kidney transplantation.
Risk of Diagnoses with Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease
after Hemodialysis Initiation
Within the first year after initiating hemodialysis, 4.6% of
older women and 3.7% of older men were diagnosed with
dementia; the corresponding risks of diagnosis with Alz-
heimer’s disease were 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. The
remaining lifetime risks of diagnosis with dementia after
accounting for the competing risks of death, change in
dialysis modality and transplantation for older patients
initiating hemodialysis were 25% for women and 21% for
men (Table 2). The corresponding lifetime risks of di-
agnosis with Alzheimer’s disease for older patients initi-
ating hemodialysis were 5.4% for women and 4.2% for men
(Table 2).
The 10-year risks of posthemodialysis dementia diagno-
sis were 20% for patients on hemodialysis ages 66–70 years
old, 24% for those ages 71–75 years old, 28% for those ages
76–80 years old, 34% for those ages 81–85 years old, and
36% for those older than 85 years old (Figure 1A). Similarly,
the risk of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis was higher with
older age at hemodialysis initiation (Figure 1B). The 10-year
risks of diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease were 4.3% for
patients on hemodialysis ages 66–70 years old, 5.9% for
those ages 71–75 years old, 7.1% for those ages 76–80 years
old, 7.6% for those ages 81–85 years old, and 8.0% for those
older than 85 years old.
Risk Factors for Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease
Diagnoses
Patients on hemodialysis who were diagnosed with
dementia were older at the time of hemodialysis initiation
(81–85 years old: 21% versus 16%; .85 years old: 12%
versus 8%; P,0.001), more likely to be women (51% versus
46%; P,0.001), more likely to have had stroke/transient
ischemic attack (19% versus 13%; P,0.001), more likely to
have an inability to ambulate (12% versus 9%; P,0.001),
more likely to be institutionalized (20% versus 14%;
P,0.001), and more likely to need assistance with activities
of daily living (33% versus 28%; P,0.001) (Table 1). The
risk of dementia diagnosis after hemodialysis initiation was
higher with older age at initiation (Table 3). Additionally,
black patients on hemodialysis (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.67 to
1.73), underweight patients (body mass index ,18.5 kg/m2;
HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.35), patients with a history of
stroke/transient ischemic attack (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.40 to
1.46), patients with activities of daily living dependence
(HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.11), and institutionalized
patients (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.39) were at higher
risk of dementia diagnosis after initiation. Additionally,
compared with those who initiated hemodialysis between
2001 and 2005, those who initiated hemodialysis between
2008 and 2010 had a 1.17-fold higher risk of dementia
diagnosis (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.19), and those who initiated
hemodialysis between 2011 and 2013 had a 1.31-fold (95%
CI, 1.27 to 1.34) higher risk of dementia diagnosis.

disease were similar to those identified for diagnosis with

strength of the associations (Table 3). Hispanic patients
on hemodialysis had a 1.75-fold (95% CI, 1.66 to 1.84)
higher risk of diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease. In
addition, compared with those who initiated hemodialysis
between 2001 and 2005, those who initiated hemodialysis
between 2005 and 2007 had a 1.08-fold (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.13)
higher risk of diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease, and those
who initiated hemodialysis between 2008–2010 had a 1.05-
fold (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.10) higher risk of diagnosis with
Alzheimer’s disease; however, those who initiated hemo-
dialysis between 2011 and 2013 had a decreased risk (HR,
0.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.98).
As a sensitivity analysis, we estimated these associations
using a Cox proportional hazards model; as expected,
treating the deaths, change in dialysis modality, and
transplantation as censored observations in a traditional
Cox model inflates the estimate of the cumulative in-
cidence.
Mortality after Posthemodialysis Dementia Diagnosis
The risk of mortality was higher among older patients on
hemodialysis who were diagnosed with dementia after
initiation (Table 4). Older patients on hemodialysis with a
dementia diagnosis were at 2.14-fold (95% CI, 2.07 to 2.22)
higher risk of mortality compared with older patients on
hemodialysis without a dementia diagnosis, independent
of patient, dialysis, and comorbidity factors as well as
measures of functional status. Additionally, the association
between diagnosis with dementia and mortality differed
by race (P value for interaction =0.04) and diabetes status
(P value for interaction =0.001) (Table 4), such that the risk
of mortality associated with dementia diagnosis was
greater for black patients and patients without diabetes.
Mortality after Posthemodialysis Alzheimer’s Disease
Diagnosis
The risk of mortality was higher among older patients on
hemodialysis who were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
disease after initiation (Table 4). Older patients on hemo-
dialysis with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease were at
2.01-fold (95% CI, 1.89 to 2.15) higher risk of mortality
compared with older patients on hemodialysis without a
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, independent of patient,
dialysis, and comorbidity factors as well as measures of
functional status. The association between Alzheimer’s
disease diagnosis and mortality was greater for patients
without diabetes (P value for interaction =0.001) (Table 4).
Discussion
In this national study of 356,668 older patients with
ESKD initiating hemodialysis, within the first year of
hemodialysis initiation, 4.6% of older women and 3.7%
of older men were diagnosed with dementia. The remain-
ing lifetime risks of diagnosis with dementia accounting for
the competing risks of death, change in dialysis modality,
and kidney transplantation for older patients initiating
hemodialysis were 25% for women and 21% for men; the
corresponding remaining lifetime risks of diagnosis with
Alzheimer’s disease were 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively.
Patient characteristics and measures of functional status
were independently associated with a greater risk of
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease diagnoses. Older pa-
tients on hemodialysis who were diagnosed with dementia
were subsequently at a twofold higher risk of death; a
similar mortality risk was observed for older patients on
hemodialysis who were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease.
Previous findings from the Framingham study suggest
that the 10-year incidence of dementia is 1%–1.5% in adults
age 65 years old and 7.4%–7.6% in adults age 75 years old
(30). Using a similar analytic approach to account for the
competing risk of mortality and kidney transplant, we
found that the 10-year risk of diagnosed posthemodialysis
dementia was 19% for patients with ESKD ages 66–70 years
old and that it rose to 28% for those 76–80 years of age.
Similarly, our observed 10-year incidence of diagnosed
Alzheimer’s disease after hemodialysis initiation of 4.3% in
those ages 66–70 years old, which rose to 7.1% for those 76–
81 years old, is greater than the findings from the
Framingham study (0.6%–0.9% incidence in adults age
65 years old and 4.4%–5.4% incidence in adults age 75 years
old). Additionally, we found that there was a higher risk of
diagnosis of dementia over time. These findings could
represent a true increase in patients with new cases of
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (until 2011) or could be
due to changes in billing code practices over time. Addi-
tionally, age is the strongest risk factor for dementia
diagnosis. The higher risk of diagnosis of dementia may

The lifetime risks were estimated for 356,668 older patients with ESKD using a competing risks survival analysis. The lifetime risk is
interpreted as remaining lifetime risk of being diagnosed with dementia (or Alzheimer’s disease) over 13 years of follow-up given
dementia diagnosis-free survival to dialysis initiation and accounting for the competing risks of death, change in dialysis modality, and
kidney transplantation. 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.

 be due to the increase in the number of older (ages 75 years
old and older) patients initiating hemodialysis since 2001;
however, our results were adjusted for age.
The estimates from the Framingham study included
patients with both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases.
These differences in defining patients with dementia and
patients with Alzheimer’s disease are not trivial given
that a previous validation study suggested that only one
half of those who would meet diagnostic criteria for
dementia receive a physician diagnosis of dementia (31).
Additionally, with this estimated rate of underdiagnosis in
mind, the risk of diagnoses with dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease after hemodialysis initiation compared with in the
general older adult population is potentially even more
substantial than what comparing incidence rates would
suggest. Additionally, we identified black and Hispanic
patients on hemodialysis as being at an elevated risk of
being diagnosed with dementia, which is consistent with
findings from the geriatric literature (32); these racial and
ethnic differences have been attributed to the greater
burden of chronic comorbidity in older adults (33,34) as
well as older adults with ESKD (35). It is also possible that
these black and Hispanic patients on hemodialysis are
now receiving routine medical care, which allows for the
diagnosis with dementia after hemodialysis initiation,
because dementia is often undiagnosed in this population.
This work builds on the previous findings about prevalent
dementia among patients on hemodialysis (14,15,36,37) and
extends these findings to incident dementia among older
patients with ESKD initiating hemodialysis.
The potential mechanisms of dementia diagnosis after
hemodialysis initiation are not clear, although the prevail-
ing hypothesis is that cognitive impairment manifests in
patients undergoing hemodialysis as part of a microvas-
cular process. Among older patients on hemodialysis,
dementia likely exists on a spectrum, influenced by both
vascular processes as well as the Alzheimer’s disease
pathology, although the former process is likely more
common (38–41).
Similar to findings from studies of older adults (8–10)
and patients undergoing dialysis (36,37,42), we found that
there is a great burden of mortality among those diagnosed
with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Among patients
with ESKD of all ages who had a diagnosis of dementia
before hemodialysis initiation, there was a 1.87-fold higher
risk of postdialysis mortality (42), and a study of patients
on hemodialysis of all ages found that prevalent dementia
is associated with a 1.48-fold higher risk of mortality (36).
Our findings suggest that the risk of dementia diagnosis is
highest among those with activities of daily living disabil-
ity, which may be one pathway linking dementia and
mortality; furthermore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease requires the impairment in functioning. Mortality can
result among patients on hemodialysis with a diagnosis of
dementia as the result of an inability to perform self-care
tasks, to consume adequate nutritional intake, to adhere to
complex diet and medication regimens, to identify personal
safety issues, or to communicate new symptoms or infec-
tions, particularly pneumonia (43,44). Additionally, the
relationship between poor executive function and mortality
among patients on hemodialysis is partially explained by
cardiovascular disease burden (38).
This study has a few notable limitations. To identify
patients with incident cases of dementia after hemodialysis
initiation, we had to limit our population to Medicare-
primary patients on hemodialysis with 1 year of claims
before hemodialysis initiation, a criterion that could dif-
ferentially affect those under 66 years old and thus, the
generalizability to younger cohorts. However, given that
all patients with ESKD requiring dialysis therapy are
eligible for Medicare, this is a common inclusion criterion
in studies of patients with ESKD (45–47). Additionally, this
national registry does not capture important metrics of
aging, like frailty and measured cognitive function
(15,48,49), which may be important predictors of incident
diagnosis with dementia in patients on hemodialysis;
however, we were able to study functional dependence

 as measured by activities of daily living, which is an
important metric of aging in patients on hemodialysis (50).
Also, this national registry does not include patients with
CKD; therefore, we are unable to estimate the effect of
initiating dialysis on the risk of diagnosis with dementia.
Also, the distinction between the general category of
diagnosis with “dementia” and the specific diagnosis of
“Alzheimer’s disease” is challenging in real world clinical
settings reflected in Medicare claims data, and thus, it is
likely that the diagnosis of activities of daily living is an
underestimate and reflects coding habits. Alzheimer’s
disease cannot be truly diagnosed without a postmortem
pathologic confirmation, and it likely that the claims-based
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease more likely reflects a
physician’s suspected diagnosis, which may be reflected in
the percentage of all patients with dementia diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, dementia diagnoses are
likely an underestimate of the true burden of dementia,
because we relied on diagnoses code for dementia rather
than a neurocognitive battery (31). Furthermore, the more
clinical encounters a patient has with the health care
system, particularly encounters beyond the dialysis unit,
the more likely they are to be given a diagnosis of dementia
and the more likely they are to die. Furthermore, it is
challenging to distinguish patients with incident cases of
dementia from those with prevalent or preexisting de-
mentia in administrative diagnosis claims. For this reason,
we have focused on incident diagnoses of dementia and
recognize that dementia onset likely occurred before
diagnosis. Finally, our study was on the basis of observa-
tional data, and thus, it remains unclear whether prevent-
ing dementia or Alzheimer’s disease would improve the

 high rates of mortality among older patients with ESKD
initiating hemodialysis.
In conclusion, the risk of diagnosed dementia and Alz-
heimer’s disease among older patients with ESKD initiating
hemodialysis is substantially greater than the previously
published risks of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease among
community-dwelling older adults . A number of patient, dial-
ysis, and comorbidity factors as well as measures of func-
tional status were associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease diagnoses in this population. Older patients on
hemodialysis who are diagnosed with dementia and Alz-
heimer’s disease are at twice the risk of subsequent mortality.
