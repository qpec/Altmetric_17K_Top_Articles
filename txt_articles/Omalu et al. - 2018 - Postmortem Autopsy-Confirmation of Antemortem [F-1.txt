Currently, only presumptive diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can
be made in living patients. We present a modality that may be instrumental to the
definitive diagnosis of CTE in living patients based on brain autopsy confirmation of
[F-18]FDDNP-PET findings in an American football player with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP-PET
imaging was performed 52 mo before the subject’
s death. Relative distribution volume
parametric images and binding values were determined for cortical and subcortical
regions of interest. Upon death, the brain was examined to identify the topographic
distribution of neurodegenerative changes. Correlation between neuropathology and
[F-18]FDDNP-PET binding patterns was performed using Spearman rank-order correlation.
Mood, behavioral, motor, and cognitive changes were consistent with chronic traumatic
myeloencephalopathy with a 22-yr lifetime risk exposure to American football. There
were tau, amyloid, and TDP-43 neuropathological substrates in the brain with a differ-
ential topographically selective distribution. [F-18]FDDNP-PET binding levels correlated
with brain tau deposition (rs = 0.59, P = .02), with highest relative distribution volumes
in the parasagittal and paraventricular regions of the brain and the brain stem. No corre-
lation with amyloid or TDP-43 deposition was observed. [F-18]FDDNP-PET signals may
be consistent with neuropathological patterns of tau deposition in CTE, involving areas
that receive the maximal shearing, angular–rotational acceleration–deceleration forces in
American football players, consistent with distinctive and differential topographic vulnera-
bility and selectivity of CTE beyond brain cortices, also involving midbrain and limbic areas.
Future studies are warranted to determine whether differential and selective [F-18]FDDNP-
PET may be useful in establishing a diagnosis of CTE in at-risk patients.

Our patient had a 22-yr cumulative lifetime risk exposure to football and manifested a progressive decline in his work status and performance over decades, which eventually
resulted in a bankruptcy.
disease advances. The ability to identify CTE inthe brains of living
patients is a prerequisite step for complete elucidation of CTE
pathogenesis and development of cures.6 In pursuit of this prereq-
uisite step, we present an autopsy confirmation in a retired NFL
player with CTE, who had an antemortem [F-18]FDDNP-PET
scan with a distinctive CTE pattern.
METHODS
Medical History
Our patient’s medical, football, and work histories were collated and
reviewed. A postmortem surrogate interview of his wife and next-of-kin
was performed. He was a 59-yr-old African–American man at the time of
[F-18]FDDNP-PET scanning. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan at the time of the [F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging showed mild, global
brain atrophy with enlarged ventricles, moderate bilateral hippocampal
atrophy, and diffuse white matter hyperintensities.
Two years after his [F-18]FDDNP-PET scan, at age 61, his wife
noticed progressive motor deficits, including inability to button his
shirts, zip his pants or tie his shoes, and eventually feed himself. She
reported that he developed muscle twitching (without cramps) in his
arms and decreased muscle mass in his shoulders and arms without any
sensory changes. Clinical examinations about 6 to 8 mo after the onset of
his motor symptoms revealed decreased muscle bulk in the bilateral upper
extremities with normal tone, atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles,
and weakness of the biceps bilaterally. Electromyography determina-
tions of selected bilateral upper and lower extremity, and cervical-lumbar
paraspinal muscles revealed active and chronic denervation changes in
nearly all muscles tested. Approximately 17 mo prior to death, he was
diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in
addition to his pre-existing clinical and presumptive diagnosis of CTE.
During the final months of his life, our patient was admitted to a
nursing home for dehydration, failure to thrive, progressive dysphagia,
incontinence, progressive neck and limb weakness, and slurred speech.
He eventually died at the age of 63. Full autopsy was not performed,
but his brain and spinal cord were harvested for neuropathological
examination.
Neuropsychological evaluation of the patient was performed at the
time of [F-18]FDDNP-PET scanning.7,8
Antemortem [F-18]FDDNP-PET Brain Scan
[F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging of the brain was performed approxi-
mately 52 mo prior to death. The study was performed under standard
ethics guidelines as have been previously reported.4
[F-18]FDDNP radiochemistry has been previously described and
reported.1,4,9,10 PET scan determinations and quantification of the [F-
18]FDDNP binding data have been previously reported.1,4,11-13 The
distribution volume ratio (DVR) parametric images were generated and
analyzed with the use of regions of interest (ROIs) drawn bilaterally on
the co-registered MRI scans for a number of cortical, limbic, and subcor-
tical areas. MRI scans were also performed for the purpose of anatomical
reference to aid the analysis of PET data as described previously.11
Postmortem Autopsy Determination
Upon the subject’s death, the next-of-kin contacted the pathologist
(BO) for donation of the patient’s brain. An informed consent form was
signed for brain examination and to obtain the medical records for review.
The dura mater, brain, pituitary gland, and spinal cord were harvested
within 48 h of death, and fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde for
3 wk. The sections were then washed for 24 h in a water bath, measured,
grossed, and dissected.

Comprehensive psychopathological cognitive assessment of the patient at the time of the [F-18]FDDNP-PET scan for the in vivo detection of neuropathological substrates in the
brain. Our subject was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment with deficits in multiple cognitive domains, eg, memory, attention, information processing speed, language, and
executive functioning.
MRI/PET maps and regions of interest were used for the determi-
nation of DVR values. Similar regions of interest matching the MRI/PET
maps were targeted in the neuropathological tissue sectioning and
microscopic examination. A battery of histochemical and immunohis-
tochemical stains was performed on each submitted section in addition
to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H/E). The brain slides were indepen-
dently examined microscopically by 2 neuropathologists (BO and JL)
and 1 forensic pathologist (JH). All 3 pathologists were in agreement
with the findings and diagnoses. Histomorphological, proteinopathic,
and neuroinflammatory changes were noted on all stained slides. The

distribution and density of the proteinopathic changes were classified
into 4 semiquantitative categories adapted from the neuritic plaque
density assessment of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for
Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD).14 The 4 adapted categories are as follows:
none (0), sparse (1), moderate (2), and frequent (3). The same catego-
rization was applied to pathological changes seen on the cluster of differ-
entiation 68 (CD-68), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and luxol
fast blue-cresyl violet (LFB-CV) stains.
Statistical Analysis
Topographic distribution of observed proteinopathies in the brain
was compared to the documented topographic distribution of the
[F-18]FDDNP-PET brain imaging findings. Correlation analysis was
performed using Spearman rank-order correlation. Correlation between
[F-18]FDDNP-PET DVRs and tau, amyloid, or TDP-43 deposit
densities, was obtained and was corrected for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini–Hochberg method15 and controlled the false discovery
rate (FDR) to be 10%. Statistical significance was set at P < .05 (2-
sided). Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS 9.4 for Windows
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Summaries of our patient’s football, work, and medical
histories are presented in Tables 1-3.
Brain and Spinal Gross and Histologic Findings
The gross and H/E brain and spinal findings are summarized
in Table 4. The LFB-CV stains revealed diffuse, global, mild loss
of myelin in the cortical and subcortical white matter including
the corpus callosum (Table 5). The Bielschowsky silver stains
highlighted the tau and amyloid neuropathological substrates
described below.
The tau immunostains revealed sparse to frequent neuronal
and glial fibrillary tangles and inclusions, neuropil threads and
dot-like lesions, and ghost neurofibrillary tangles, which were
differentially and topographically distributed in both the brain
and spinal cord (Table 5). All these tau neuropathological
substrates, in both the gray and white matter, were included in
the semiquantitative evaluation of topographic densities, and were
not limited to neuronal neurofibrillary tangles. In the spinal cord,
the neurons, glia, and neuropil of both the central gray matter
and the anterior, lateral, and posterior funiculi were involved by
tau neuropathological substrates. The following diagnostic CTE
criteria were noted: residual density accentuations of tauopathy
in the superficial cortical laminae, in the depths of the sulci,
in perivascular regions, and in the subcortical parasagittal and
periventricular nuclei, as well as irregular neocortical distribu-
tions of tau neuropathological substrates (skip-phenomenon),
whereby adjacent regions of the neocortex were skipped by
tau substrates.16,17 The parasagittal and paraventricular density-
accentuations of tau substrates exhibited a caudal-rostral gradient
with highest densities seen in the regions of the brain surrounding
the third ventricle and cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius including the
periaqueductal and tegmental nuclei of the midbrain and rostral
pons, and the locus ceruleus, the hypothalamus, subthalamic
nucleus, periventricular posterior thalamus and pulvinar, and the
globus pallidus.16,17 These subcortical regions, similar to the
neocortex, exhibited the skip-phenomenon. These parasagittal
and periventricular subcortical regions, with less volume and less
surface area when compared to the global neocortex, appeared to
show more frequent densities of tau neuropathological substrates
per unit surface area and volume, with prominent extra-neuronal
tau substrates, in agreement with [F-18]FDDNP-PET findings
(Figures 1 and 2; Table 5). Thorn-shaped astrocytes and features
of primary age-related tauopathy or age-related tau astrogliopathy
were absent.18,19
The beta-A4 amyloid immunostains revealed diffuse and
neuritic amyloid plaques that exhibited differential topographic
distribution as shown in Table 5. There was no cerebral amyloid
angiopathy in the brain or spinal cord. The amygdala, cerebellum,
and spinal cord did not show any diffuse or neuritic amyloid

plaques. The brainstem showed none to sparse diffuse and
neuritic amyloid plaques.
The TDP-43 immunostains revealed inclusions in neurons
and glia, and neuropil threads in selective regions of the brain
and spinal medulla (Table 5). The alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin,
and FUS protein immunostains did not reveal any neuronal or
glial inclusions. The CD-68 immunostains showed diffuse, global
neuropil histiocytes and activated microglia accentuated perivas-
cularly and in the Virchow Robin spaces. The GFAP immunos-
tains exhibited a similar topographic distribution with diffuse,
global isomorphic fibrillary astrogliosis (Table 5).
The regions of the brain with the highest densities of tau
pathology showed larger numbers of ghost tangles. Every region
of the brain that exhibited amyloid pathology also exhibited
the presence of tau pathology in higher densities; however, not
every region of the brain that exhibited tau pathology, exhibited
corresponding amyloid pathology. The parasagittal and paraven-
tricular subcortical regions showed higher predominance of tau
pathology compared to amyloid pathology. Brain ROIs with the
highest densities of tau pathology also generally showed TDP-43
pathology deposition, typically subcortical structures (Table 5).
There was no amyloid or tau pathology in the cerebellum.
The clinical and pathological findings, in this case, were
consistent with a primary diagnosis of chronic traumatic
myeloencephalopathy
(CTME),
as
has
been
previously
described.16,17,20-24 Figure 3 illustrates the pertinent neuropatho-
logical findings.

tissue analysis to show tau pathology, and also amyloid pathology
in some instances; and identified regions of the brain with
only tau pathology or predominant tau pathology such as the
midbrain and amygdala.
Correlation analysis was performed to investigate whether the
in vivo regional [F-18]FDDNP binding level agreed with the
density of tau pathology based on autopsy findings. Spearman
rank-order correlation coefficient (rs) was calculated for the
regional [F-18]FDDNP DVRs (Figure 1) and the density of tau
pathology, as well as for amyloid and TDP-43 substrates (Table 5).
Our results showed that the tau regional findings and densities
obtained from antemortem [F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging and
postmortem autopsy were highly correlated (rs = 0.592, P =
.0202). However, no statistical correlation was found with the
presence of amyloid deposition (rs = −0.481; P = .0695) or of
TDP-43 (rs = 0.433; P = .1066).
DISCUSSION
Our findings and previously reported research1,4,25 may
confirm that [F-18]FDDNP-PET brain imaging may be selective
for predominant tauopathies like CTE and may identify the
distinctive selective topographic differential distribution of brain
tau pathology. The neuropathological findings, at brain autopsy
in this current research, confirmed the in vivo [F-18]FDDNP-
PET ‘fingerprint’ signature of CTE previously reported.1,4
CTE has been confirmed to exhibit a distinctive neuropatho-
logical signature with differential and selective topographic
vulnerability

brain
regions,
which
are
temporally
progressive1,17,20-22,26,27 eventually recruiting all regions of
the brain in advanced CTE.20,22 The [F-18]FDDNP-PET brain
imaging findings1,4 and brain autopsy findings in this current
research may further confirm this neuropathological signature.

 AUTOPSY CONFIRMATION OF FDDNP-PET FINDINGS IN A FOOTBALL PLAYER WITH CTE
FIGURE 2. Top panel: immunohistochemistry photomicrographs (×400) of parietal cortex, midbrain, amygdala, and hippocampus show the presence of tau
neuropathological deposits in these regions. Bottom panel: representative transaxial (2 sections), sagittal (middle), and coronal sections (right) of [F-18]FDDNP-PET
images with high signals in the periventricular subcortical regions, amygdala, and midbrain. Warmer colors (red and yellow) show areas with higher [F-18]FDDNP
binding signals.
Selectively vulnerable regions of the brain may differentially
manifest the neuropathological substrates of CTE earlier, and in
greater quantities per unit volume and surface area, as the disease
advances to the late stages when the brain globally manifests
these neuropathological substrates. Some of these selectively
vulnerable topographic regions of the brain may include, but
may not be limited to, the midbrain, pons, limbic structures,
parasagittal, and periventricular regions of the brain.1,4,21,28
These are the sagittal and parasagittal regions of the brain
that appear to bear the maximal shearing, angular–rotational
acceleration–deceleration forces in traumatic brain injuries and
in American football players.29-31 This pathology progression
involves neuronal circuits that are consistent with the selective
and differential clinical symptomatology of CTE, predominantly
mood and behavioral symptoms in younger patients, progressing
to increasing cognitive deficits, and, eventually, dementia in older
patients with advanced stages of CTE32 as the neocortex becomes
globally involved.
Our brain autopsy showed differential distribution of tau
and amyloid neuropathological CTE substrates in the bilateral
neocortex in a dorsal-ventral gradient, as was observed with
[F-18]FDDNP-PET (Figure 1).1,4 A limitation of this work,
however, is the 52-mo interval between the [F-18]FDDNP-PET
brain imaging and brain autopsy. Since CTE is a progressive
disease, further progression of neuropathological substrates
should have existed over this period. This is particularly evident
in this case, when the subject was diagnosed with motor neuron
disease 2 yr after PET scanning, and suffered advancing symptoms
until death. In spite of this temporal limitation, remnants of
the differential lobar neocortical distribution of tau and amyloid
neuropathological substrates were still observed at autopsy. The
frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, at autopsy, revealed
uniformly high distribution and densities of neuropathological
substrates, while the occipital cortex revealed lower densities
(Table 5). Clinical dementia ratings performed several years
prior to death can accurately predict postmortem regional
and topographically selective neuropathology.33,34 Unfortunately,
the spinal cord was not included in the [F-18]FDDNP-PET
scanning, since the patient was not manifesting any motor
symptoms of CTME at the time of the scanning.
The lack of statistical correlation between our TDP-43
neuropathological findings and [F-18]FDDNP DVRs in this
case, as well as the lack of correlation with amyloid deposition,
may indicate that the [F-18]FDDNP-PET brain signal, in this
case, originated principally in the presence of tau neuroag-
gregates (Figure 2). As has been previously suggested, the

TDP-43 inclusion bodies did not show any amyloid fibrillary

was less likely to have significantly originated from these
inclusions.
Our prior research1,4 and current findings are indicating that
[F-18]FDDNP-PET brain imaging may be a useful in vivo radio-
logical tool for the clinical assessment and diagnosis of traumatic
encephalopathy syndromes6 including CTE, CTME, and CTE-
PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Further evaluation with
clinical trials is warranted. Subconcussion and concussion based
CTE may be differentially selective of the regions of the brain
that bear the maximal shearing, angular–rotational acceleration–
deceleration
forces29-31
(parasagittal
and
periventricular
regions and nuclei of the brain), progressing in topographic
distribution to recruit more neocortical and subcortical regions
as the disease advances. This may explain the progressive nature
of the clinical symptoms and their correlation with deteriorating
neuronal circuits.1,4 Further studies are needed to confirm this
progressive pathology model in living subjects.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our results may suggest that the in vivo identi-
fication of CTE substrates in living patients may not only be

based on the presence or absence of proteinopathies, but also
on the identification of the differential and selective topographic
vulnerability unique to CTE, which [F-18]FDDNP-PET may be
demonstrating. Further prospective studies are needed to assess
whether [F18]FDDNP PET can serve as a useful adjunct in the
diagnosis of CTE in living patients.

COMMENT
T
his manuscript describes an in vivo PET technique which may help
monitor the development of CTE and allow better correlation of
symptoms with evolving pathology. As we strive to better understand
the link between repetitive mTBI and neurodegeneration, and to better
understand the the clinical correlate of the pathologic entity CTE, such
in vivo techniques are critical. The manuscript is clearly limited with
n = 1, but hopefully shows a potential in vivo way of helping to better
define this rare condition.
