Abstract 
1 
Background 
2 
The relationship between metabolic risk and time spent sitting, standing and stepping has not 
3 
been well established. The present study aimed to determine associations of objectively measured 
4 
time spent siting, standing and stepping, with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. 
5 
Methods 
6 
A cross-sectional study of healthy non-smoking Glasgow postal workers, n=111 (55 office-
7 
workers, 5 women, and 56 walking/delivery-workers, 10 women), who wore activPAL physical 
8 
activity monitors for seven days. Cardiovascular risks were assessed by metabolic syndrome 
9 
categorisation and 10-y PROCAM risk. 
10 
Results 
11 
Mean(SD) age was 40(8) years, BMI 26.9(3.9)kg/m2 and waist circumference 95.4(11.9)cm. 
12 
Mean(SD) HDL-cholesterol 1.33(0.31), LDL-cholesterol 3.11(0.87), triglycerides 
13 
1.23(0.64)mmol/l and 10-y PROCAM risk 1.8(1.7)%. Participants spent mean(SD) 9.1(1.8)h/d 
14 
sedentary, 7.6(1.2)h/d sleeping, 3.9(1.1)h/d standing and 3.3(0.9)h/d stepping, accumulating 
15 
14,708(4,984)steps/d in 61(25) sit-to-stand transitions per day. In univariate regressions - 
16 
adjusting for age, sex, family history of CHD, shift worked, job type and socio-economic status - 
17 
waist circumference (p=0.005), fasting triglycerides (p=0.002), HDL-cholesterol (p=0.001) and 
18 
PROCAM-risk (p=0.047) were detrimentally associated with sedentary time. These associations 
19 
remained significant after further adjustment for sleep, standing and stepping in stepwise 
20 
regression models. However, after further adjustment for waist circumference, the associations

were not significant. Compared to those without the metabolic syndrome, participants with the 
22 
metabolic syndrome were significantly less active – fewer steps, shorter stepping duration and 
23 
longer time sitting. Those with no metabolic syndrome features walked >15,000 steps/day, or 
24 
spent >7h/day upright. 
25 
Conclusion 
26 
Longer time spent in sedentary posture is significantly associated with higher CHD risk and 
27 
larger waist circumference.

Introduction 
31 
Sedentary occupation and overall behaviour is now the norm in modern societies. Technological 
32 
advancements in Western economies have reduced the energy requirements of daily living, with 
33 
populations spending more hours sitting, at work, in transport and during leisure-time.1 There is 
34 
little evidence to suggest that reduced occupational physical activity leads to compensatory 
35 
increases during leisure-time, or vice versa.2-5 Studies from Europe, US and Australia find that 
36 
adults spend half of work days sitting (average 4.2 h/d) and about 2.9 h/d of leisure-time sitting.6-
37 
8  
38 
 
39 
 
40 
An increasing body of literature suggests that sitting time, independent of physical activity levels, 
41 
promotes cardiovascular disease.9,10 Both self-report and objective data have shown that time 
42 
spent sedentary has an independent detrimental association with coronary and diabetes-related 
43 
metabolic risk factors, such as waist circumference, blood glucose, insulin and triglycerides and 
44 
HDL-cholesterol.11-16 Healy et al.15 found that accelerometer-determined time spent inactive was 
45 
significantly associated with waist circumference, blood lipid and glucose profiles. Another 
46 
recent study found that while physical activity log and recall methods failed to show any clear 
47 
relationship, accelerometer-measured objective activity was directly related to 10-y Framingham 
48 
coronary risk.17

There is a paucity of evidence on the relationship between objectively measured sedentary 
52 
behaviour patterns, such as sitting/lying and upright postures, and cardiovascular risk. In a Dutch 
53 
cross-sectional study van der Berg et al.18 found that, an additional hour of time spent sedentary 
54 
posture was associated with a 22% greater odds for type 2 diabetes and a 39% greater odds for 
55 
the metabolic syndrome. Other studies have used accelerometer counts as a proxy14,15 but low 
56 
acceleration counts also include periods of quiet standing or standing still which is metabolically 
57 
different from sitting. In both animal and human studies, sitting, unlike standing, is associated 
58 
with reduced skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase activity and detrimental changes in lipid profile.1-
59 
21 The present study examined the associations between CHD risk and time spent in objectively-
60 
measured postures (sitting, lying and standing) and of stepping. 
61 
 
62 
 
63 
Methods 
64 
A cross-sectional study of postal workers was undertaken to relate time spent sedentary (sitting/ 
65 
lying) and stepping to CHD risk factors in apparently healthy individuals. The study aimed to 
66 
include a range of different physical activity profiles, involving both mainly sedentary office-
67 
bound postal workers and more active delivery staff.

Study Participants 
71 
Recruitment was carried out by local advertisement, with no incentives offered, from the Royal 
72 
Mail Group in Greater Glasgow, Scotland. The employees (n = 5,335; 90.2% men) worked in

four shifts: full-day (9am to 5pm), early (5am to 1pm) and late (1pm to 9 pm) and night (9pm to 
74 
5am) with two days off work, including Sunday, each week. Only apparently healthy, non-
75 
smokers, with no personal history of myocardial infarction, stroke, CHD, hypertension or 
76 
diabetes mellitus were included. None of the participants was on any lipid, blood pressure or 
77 
glucose lowering medication. All volunteers, 59 delivery (5 women) and 59 office staff (10 
78 
women) aged 22 to 60 years, were invited to the study and data collection took place between 
79 
September 2006 and September 2007. 
80 
 
81 
 
82 
Protocol 
83 
Participants wore a physical activity monitor (activPAL, PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) 
84 
for seven days, had weight, height and blood pressure measured, and provided fasting blood 
85 
samples. Seven participants (3 male delivery and 4 male office workers) refused to provide blood 
86 
samples, thus the final sample for analysis was 111, 56 delivery workers (5 women) and 55 office 
87 
workers (10 women). The study aims and protocol were explained and informed written consent 
88 
obtained, following approval from the Ethics Committee of Glasgow Caledonian University. 
89 
Socio-demographic data, including age, home address postcode and family history of CHD, were 
90 
obtained. From postcodes, national tables22 were used to provide the Scottish Index of Multiple 
91 
Deprivation (SIMD) score for each participant, as a measure of socioeconomic status, rated from 
92 
1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived). Weight, height and waist circumference were measured 
93 
according to the WHO protocol23. Fasting serum concentrations were measured of glucose (by 
94 
hexokinase method), adiponectin (R&D Elisa) and lipids namely, triglycerides, total cholesterol,

Coronary risk was assessed using the PROCAM.24 This risk calculator generates 10-year CHD 
100 
risk, for men aged 35-65y and women aged 45-65y, based on sex, age, family history of CHD, 
101 
cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, fasting HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, 
102 
triglycerides and fasting glucose concentration. The ages of 67 men and 6 women fell within the 
103 
ranges appropriate for this risk calculator. As a second indication of CHD risk and of diabetes 
104 
risk, participants were classified as having metabolic syndrome, or not, using both the NCEP 
105 
criteria25 and IDF criteria26: fasting serum triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/l, glucose ≥5.6 mmol/l, HDL-
106 
cholesterol ≤1.03 mmol/l for men or ≤1.30 mmol/l for women, waist circumference ≥102cm for 
107 
men or ≥88cm for women, and blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg.

Physical activity recording 
111 
Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were recorded for seven consecutive days using the 
112 
activPAL monitor to provide time spent stepping, standing and sitting/lying as well as steps, 
113 
mean stepping rate and number of sit-to-stand transitions per day. In addition, though the 
114 
activPAL does not differentiate sleeping (lying posture) from sitting posture, time spent sleeping 
115 
was extracted from the activPAL raw output. This was defined as prolonged periods (>2 hours) 
116 
of continuous inactivity during sleeping hours. Sleeping hours were simply night hours for those 
117 
who worked day shifts and day hours for the two participants who worked night shifts. Sleep

duration was subtracted from total sedentary time to obtain waking hours‟ sedentary time, 
119 
referred to as sedentary time in this manuscript. Both short and long sleep durations have been 
120 
reported to be associated with higher risk of CHD.27 
121 
 
122 
 
123 
The activPAL was worn on the mid anterior thigh using adhesive tape according to the 
124 
manufacturer‟s guidance and throughout seven days except during activities that risk it being in 
125 
contact with water, e.g. bathing or swimming. Participants were asked to note down any non-
126 
wear periods in the food diary that they also completed as part of the wider study (not relevant to 
127 
the current study) and these were checked with each participant at the debrief session. The inter-
128 
device reliability (ICC = 0.99) and accuracy (95.9% agreement with direct observation) of the 
129 
activPAL for reporting time spent sedentary, standing and walking have been reported 
130 
previously.28 The inter-device reliability (0.99) and accuracy (≥98.99%, depending on walking 
131 
speed) for step count and stepping rate have also been reported.29 Stepping rate (cadence) is 
132 
reported by the activPAL as number of steps per minute during stepping time. Data were 
133 
accepted for inclusion with a minimum of three 24-hour periods, including a non-work day, as 
134 
recommended by others.30

Data analyses 
138 
Age, SIMD values (1 to 5), family history of CHD, job type (delivery or office worker) and 
139 
work-shifts were obtained. Outcome variables for physical activity were daily time (h) spent 
140 
sedentary, standing and stepping, step count, average stepping rate and daily sit-to-stand

transitions. The outcome measures included BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic 
142 
pressure, fasting lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL cholesterol), fasting glucose, 
143 
and adiponectin. The 10-year PROCAM CHD risk score was generated from age, blood pressure, 
144 
fasting HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose.24 The presence of the metabolic 
145 
syndrome (derived from levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure 
146 
and waist circumference) was also obtained. 
147 
 
148 
 
149 
The data were tested for normality and summary data were produced using SPSS version 18.0. 
150 
Univariate associations were explored and multivariable linear regressions undertaken to model 
151 
the relationship between sedentary time and CHD risk. Adjustment for age, sex, SIMD, family 
152 
history of CHD, job type and shift (model 1). Job type was considered because self-selection into 
153 
job type cannot be ruled out. Similarly, as shift patterns may affect sleep patterns, this was 
154 
included in the model. In addition, further stepwise adjustments were made for sleep duration 
155 
(model 2), then standing (model 3), stepping in replacing standing (model 4), both standing and 
156 
stepping (model 5). These stepwise adjustments showed that including stepping time in model 5 
157 
did lead to improvement in the R2 value for any of five outcome variable but rather a drop in R2 
158 
was observed in model 4. We believe this was due to the observed strong correlation between 
159 
sitting, standing and stepping r = 0.34–0.61, p <0.001). One approach would have been to employ 
160 
compositional data analysis. However, rather than fitting compositional data that are not 
161 
clinically meaningful, stepping time was excluded in the final model (model 6) where additional 
162 
adjustments were also made for waist circumference. It is thought that body size may have 
163 
bidirectional relationship with sedentary behaviour, and thereby predict the behaviour.31

166 
Adjusting for the same variables as above, binary logistic regression was modelled to determine 
167 
the odds of the metabolic syndrome from the physical activity parameters. The associations were 
168 
explored in the whole sample and for the 67 men only. Separate analyses were not undertaken for 
169 
the 15 women.

Results  
173 
All 111 participants completed the full 7d study.  Fifteen participants worked full day shifts, 92 
174 
early shift, three late shift and only one worked night shift. A third (32 men; 4 women) had first-
175 
degree family histories of CHD. The distribution of the participants by SIMD was as follows: n = 
176 
13, 20, 17, 23 and 38 for SIMD 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively.  During the study, the shift patterns 
177 
of the participants were full-day (n = 15), early (n = 92), late (n = 4). The summary statistics of 
178 
the study participants are shown in Table 1.  For the 73 participants aged between 35-65y (men, 
179 
n=67) and 45-65y (women, n=6), among whom PROCAM could be applied, 10y PROCAM risk 
180 
ranged from 0.1-12.0%, mean 1.9(SD 1.7)%.

183 
In exploratory univariate analyses, waist circumference (correlation coefficient, r = 0.28, p 
184

185 
10-y PROCAM risk (r = 0.33, p =0.004) were significantly and adversely associated with

sedentary. Waist circumference (r = -0.23, p = 0.014), fasting triglycerides (r = -0.22, p = 0.018), 
187 
HDL cholesterol (r = 0.24, p <0.01) and 10-y PROCAM risk (r = -0.37, p = 0.001) were 
188 
significantly and favourably associated with stepping time. In these non-adjusted correlations, 10-
189 
y PROCAM risk showed an inverse significant (r = -0.25, p = 0.031) association with daily step 
190 
count, and serum adiponectin levels showed an inverse significant association with sedentary 
191 
time (r = -0.24, p = 0.012) and a positive significant association with standing time (r = 0.93, p = 
192 
0.002). Standing time also had a significant positive association with HDL cholesterol (r = 0.36, 
193 
p = 0.0001) and a significant inverse association with waist circumference (r = 0.20, p = 0.033). 
194 
Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were not significantly associated with BMI, blood 
195 
pressure, serum glucose or LDL cholesterol. None of the risk factors was significantly associated 
196 
with stepping rate or number of sit-to-stand transitions. 
197 
 
198 
 
199 
After adjusting for age, sex, SIMD, family history of CHD, job type and shift worked, greater 
200 
waist circumference, higher serum triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol were significantly 
201 
(p <0.05) associated with longer time spent sedentary (model 1 in table 2). These associations 
202 
remained significant after adjustments were made for sleep (model 2), then standing (model 3), 
203 
stepping (model 4) and then both standing and stepping in addition to sleep (model 5). After 
204 
further adjustment for waist circumference (model 6), the associations of sedentary time with 
205 
triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were no longer significant. Sedentary time appears to be 
206 
better predictor of waist circumference, serum triglycerides and HDL cholesterol than stepping, 
207 
standing and sleeping durations (models 3 and 4). However, this association was no longer 
208 
significant after further adjusting for waist circumference (model 6). No significant association 
209

was observed between physical activity behaviour and serum adiponectin in the adjusted 
210 
analyses. The variables together explained (R2) 18.5% of variance in serum triglycerides, 30% 
211 
for HDL cholesterol, 23% for adiponectin, 22% for waist circumference and 48% for 10-year 
212 
PROCAM risk (model 5 in table 2). Sleep duration was a strong positive predictor of serum 
213 
HDL cholesterol, even after adjusting for waist circumference. No significant associations were 
214 
found between physical activity behaviour and BMI or LDL cholesterol. Analysis for men alone 
215 
did not change the overall findings. 
216 
 
217 
 
218 
Higher 10-year PROCAM risk was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with sedentary time, 
219 
adjusting for age, sex, SIMD, family history of CHD, job type and shift worked (model 1 in 
220 
table 2). This association remained significant after further adjustment for sleep (model 2) but 
221 
not after adjusting for standing, stepping or waist circumference (models 3-6). Sedentary time 
222 
explains (R2 change) 2% of the variance in 10-year PROCAM risk, 2% in waist circumference, 
223 
1% in serum HDL and 4% in serum triglycerides (table 2). The association of sedentary time 
224 
with PROCAM risk (Figure 1) appears to be curvilinear, such that greater deterioration of risk 
225 
is associated with longer time spent sedentary. However, the introduction of a quadratic term 
226 
(square of sedentary time) in the model did not yield a significant association (R2 = 0.01, 95% 
227 
CI: -0.01 - 0.03). One additional hour per day sitting was associated with 0.18% (95% CI 0.01–
228 
0.36%) greater 10-year PROCAM risk.

Thirteen study participants had the metabolic syndrome, as defined by NCEP.32 Compared to 
232 
those without the metabolic syndrome, participants with the metabolic syndrome were 
233 
significantly less active, with lower step count, slower stepping rate, shorter stepping duration 
234 
and longer time spent sedentary (table 3). Twenty participants satisfied the IDF consensus criteria 
235 
for metabolic syndrome.26 These participants similarly spent more time in a sedentary posture 
236 
and walked less than those without metabolic syndrome (table 3). Those participants with no 
237 
metabolic syndrome features walked ≥3.5 hour/day, >15,000 steps/day, or spent >7h/day upright. 
238 
 
239 
 
240 
The logistic regression model was used to explore the association between physical activity time 
241 
and the development of the metabolic syndrome. After adjusting for age, sex, family history of 
242 
CHD, job type, shift worked, socioeconomic status and shift worked, no significant association 
243 
was found between time in posture and activity with the development of the metabolic syndrome.  
244 
 
245 
 
246 
Discussion 
247 
The present study set out to relate objectively measured time spent in sedentary posture, standing 
248 
and stepping to a comprehensive list of cardiovascular and diabetes-related risk factors. The data 
249 
indicate that sedentary behaviour is associated with coronary and diabetes risk as reflected by 
250 
metabolic syndrome, with elevated waist circumference, elevated serum triglycerides, and 
251 
lowered serum HDL cholesterol. After adjusting for socio-demographic variables, sleep and 
252 
physical activity (stepping and standing), time spent sedentary was positively associated with 
253

 14 
 
 
 
coronary risk, as determined by PROCAM. This association has been quantified to demonstrate 
254 
the level of risk (the β coefficient or odds ratio) associated with sedentary behaviour.  
255 
 
256 
 
257 
These findings, if proven to be a causal relationship, may offer support for a health promotion 
258 
intervention in the workplace, to reduce sitting and increase time spent in an upright posture. 
259 
Animal studies have shown that preventing ambulatory activity of the hind limb over 24 hours 
260 
could lead to a reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol by 22% and lipoprotein lipase activity (the 
261 
hormone responsible for triglyceride catabolism) by 90% to 95%.19,33 LPL activity in limb 
262 
muscles is dependent on local contractile activity. Sedentary behaviour therefore promotes CHD 
263 
independently from lack of moderate-vigorous physical activity, and as demonstrated 
264 
previously4, adults do not necessarily compensate sedentary posture at work with upright posture 
265 
after work. Reducing sedentary behaviour by spending more time upright, thereby engaging limb 
266 
and trunk muscles, is a simple protective mechanism to reduce CVD. The metabolic cost of 
267 
upright posture is approximately 33-40% higher than that of sitting posture.34,35 It is recognised 
268 
that one recent small study36 of energy expenditure of some activities (lasting ≤ 15min duration)

found no significant difference in energy expenditure between sitting and standing. Mansoubi et 
270 
al. 37, on the other hand, suggest reclassifying some sitting-based activities as non-sedentary 
271 
because they may involve energy expenditures > 1.5 METs, the cut-off for sedentary behaviour 
272 
by definition.38 It is our view that participation in such activities are not a common occurrence. It 
273 
is rather unusual to engage in sitting activities that expend more energy than standing activities. 
274 
However, fitting more upright time into busy workdays on a habitual basis is an easy message, 
275 
and is potentially acceptable. Encouraging leisure time physical activity is of course valuable, but

tends to result in erratic and poorly sustained improvements.39-41 Efforts to increase participation 
277 
in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are complementary with that of reducing sedentary 
278 
behaviour. 
279

281 
Previous research using pedometers has related step counts to risks. In the present study, using 
282 
the activPAL which is more accurate and reliable than pedometers in measuring steps29, we found 
283 
that waist circumference and 10-y PROCAM risk were associated with step count in unadjusted 
284 
data, but not after adjustments. The presence of the metabolic syndrome was significantly 
285 
associated with daily step count. Though the number of cases of the metabolic syndrome was 
286 
relatively small, the findings corroborate previous results.  Schofield et al.42 reported that 
287 
Australian adolescent girls who achieved less than 10,000 steps/day were significantly more 
288 
likely to have two or more CHD risk factors. We have further shown that CHD risk has stronger 
289 
associations with time spent stepping and in sedentary posture than with step count. 
290 
 
291 
 
292 
A previous cross-sectional study involving 168 subjects reported that greater number of breaks in 
293 
sedentary time (i.e. „transitions‟ to standing posture) had beneficial associations with waist 
294 
circumference, BMI, triglycerides and 2-hour postprandial glucose.43 That pattern was not 
295 
confirmed in the present study; in neither the unadjusted nor the adjusted analyses were sit-to-
296 
stand transitions associated with coronary risk. However, unlike this previous study, ours did not 
297 
include 2-hour postprandial glucose but rather fasting blood glucose only, and this may explain 
298 
the difference in findings. Importantly, the differences in the findings - in particular the 
299

 16 
 
 
 
association with waist circumference, BMI and triglycerides - may also lie in data quality: in the 
300 
previous study, sedentary time was estimated by actiGraph, setting an arbitrary cut-off (≤100 
301 
counts/minute) as a proxy for sedentary time, while actiGraph counts rising above this value were 
302 
considered transitions out of sedentary behaviour. Secondly, the actiGraph does not differentiate 
303 
standing still from sitting and lying, and will therefore misclassify a change from standing still to 
304 
stepping as a break in sedentary time44. Standing still is different from sitting in that the former is 
305 
known to elicit cardio-protective metabolic changes in skeletal muscles.20,21 The activPAL, used 
306 
in the present study accurately measures sit-to-stand transitions27, so our data are likely to be 
307 
more reliable. 
308 
 
309 
 
310 
We found no demonstrable relationship between physical activity or sedentary behaviour and 
311 
blood pressure, the latter being within the normal ranges, although previous studies reported 
312 
higher blood pressure with longer television watching time45 and lower energy expenditure.46 
313 
Furthermore, no significant association was found between fasting glucose and the physical 
314 
activity parameters despite earlier reports of independent association of objectively measured 
315 
light-intensity physical activity with 2-hour postprandial glucose in other non-diabetic 
316 
subjects.45,47 The differences may be due to the differences in the measurement of sedentary 
317 
behaviour: television watching time, accelerometer counts and heart rate in the previous studies 
318 
versus time spent sitting and lying in the present study. The difference may also be due the 
319 
differences in outcome measures: fasting glucose versus 2-hour postprandial glucose. A more 
320 
recent large study involving 2,497 participants wearing the same activity monitor as in the 
321 
present study (the activPAL) found higher odds for type 2 diabetes with sedentary behaviour.18

 17 
 
 
 
The present study adds significant new information to the recent studies and reviews44-50 which 
323 
call for valid and reliable quantitative assessment of sedentary behaviour and its relationship with 
324 
CVD and diabetes. Future studies should endeavour to use similar assessment methods for both 
325 
sedentary behaviour and the outcome variables. 
326 
 
327 
 
328 
In man, adiponectin appears to reflect insulin sensitivity but may not be a powerful upstream 
329 
determinant.51 We found no significant relationship between adiponectin and physical activity 
330 
measures, in keeping with prior studies which have yielded differing results.52-54 Adiponectin 
331 
levels were, however, significantly associated with waist circumference, reflecting the well-
332 
known relationship between insulin sensitivity and obesity.  
333 
 
334 
 
335 
Strengths and Limitations 
336 
Our study has strengths, but also limitations. We used a more intensive measured assessment, 
337 
which provides more reliable data than conventional step-counters, but this inevitably restricts 
338 
study numbers and power. We used appropriate statistical methods to avoid over-reporting 
339 
positive findings, and have not made assertions that invoke beta errors, which could arise from 
340 
low power. The sample was of white Caucasians, not balanced between the sexes, so conclusions 
341 
cannot be drawn for other races or for women alone. The main conclusions are based on data 
342 
adjusted for sex, but while we have no a priori reason to suspect sex differences, we have 
343 
confirmed in sensitivity analyses that the main findings remain for men alone. Though the 
344 
activPAL does not differentiate sleeping (lying posture) from sitting posture, it was possible to 
345 
©    2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
 18 
 
 
 
identify sleep from the raw output, as prolonged periods (>2 hours) of continuous inactivity 
346 
during sleep hours. Sedentary time is usually reported as a single measure, including sleeping 
347 
time. Adjusting for sleep as best as we could is therefore a strength of the study.  
348 
 
349 
 
350 
The study could have benefited from body composition data but due to lack of facilities for these 
351 
measures. Waist circumference, adjusted for sex and age, is a more robust predictor than BMI of 
352 
body fat measured by densitometry, and where the range of body fat is narrow a greater waist 
353 
circumference is a marker of elevated visceral fat mass.55 In the present study, waist 
354 
circumference was shown to have significant positive association with sedentary behaviour - the 
355 
latter explaining 3% of the variance in waist circumference (table 2). After adjusting for waist 
356 
circumference, the association between sedentary time and 10-year PROCAM risk and with HDL 
357 
cholesterol were no longer significant, but the association with triglycerides remained significant. 
358 
It is possible that any effects of sedentary behaviour on CHD risk act through an elevated waist 
359 
circumference and dyslipidaemia. 
360 
 
361 
 
362 
The present study reports results from cross-sectional data of healthy participants with relatively 
363 
low PROCAM-determined CHD risk. Although our data are cross-sectional, our subjects were 
364 
selected as healthy, so we feel reverse-causality would be improbable. There is ample existing 
365 
evidence for coronary risk reduction with greater physical activity, but health promotion does not 
366 
achieve activity targets sustainably for large numbers, so it will be important to test, 
367 
prospectively, the proposal that CHD risk might be reduced by increasing time spent in a vertical 
368

 19 
 
 
 
posture. It will also be valuable to include a range of ethnic and racial groups and more women in 
369 
any future studies.  
370 
 
371 
 
372 
Conclusion  
373 
Longer time spent in sedentary posture is significantly associated with higher CHD risk, 
374 
including larger waist circumference, higher triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Future 
375 
prospective research is required to ascertain if new targets for sitting, lying, standing and 
376 
stepping, to avoid metabolic risk, can be proposed. The levels associated with zero risk factors in 
377 
the present study, >15,000 steps/day or >7 hours per day spent upright, would be challenging and 
378 
difficult to sustain unless incorporated into occupations.
