Abstract
Background—The nulliparous term singleton vertex (NTSV) cesarean delivery rate has been 
recognized as a meaningful benchmark. Variation in the NTSV cesarean delivery rate among 
hospitals and providers suggests many hospitals may be able to safely improve their rates. The 
NTSV cesarean delivery rate at the authors’ institution was higher than state and national 
averages. This study was conducted to determine the influence of a set of quality improvement 
interventions on the NTSV cesarean delivery rate.

 Methods—From 2008 through 2015, at a single tertiary care academic medical center, a multi-
strategy approach that included provider education, provider feedback, and implementation of new 
policies was used to target evidence-based and inferred factors that influence the NTSV cesarean 
delivery rate. Data on mode of delivery, maternal outcomes, and neonatal outcomes were collected 
from birth certificates and administrative claims data. The Cochran-Armitage test and linear 
regression were used to calculate the p-trend for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Results—More than 20,000 NTSV deliveries were analyzed, including more than 15,000 during 
the intervention period. The NTSV cesarean delivery rate declined from 35% to 21% over eight 
years. The total cesarean delivery rate declined as well. Increase in meconium aspiration syndrome 
and maternal transfusion were observed.
Conclusion—Quality improvement initiatives can decrease the NTSV cesarean delivery rate. 
Any increased incidence of fetal or maternal complications associated with decreased NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate should be considered in the context of the risks and benefits of vaginal 
delivery compared to cesarean delivery.
Nearly one third of births in the United States occur with cesarean delivery.1 Compared to 
vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
There is an increased risk of hemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis, infection, complications 
from anesthesia, complications with future pregnancies (uterine rupture and morbidly 
adherent placenta), and neonatal respiratory problems with cesarean delivery compared to 
vaginal delivery.2 Cesarean delivery also is associated with a longer hospital stay and 
increased cost.3 Primary cesarean deliveries account for more than half of all cesarean 
deliveries, and the most common indication for repeat cesarean delivery is previous cesarean 
delivery.4 Nulliparous term singleton vertex (NTSV) cesarean delivery quantifies the number 
of nulliparous women with term, singleton pregnancies with the fetus in the vertex 
presentation who undergo cesarean delivery. Compared to the general obstetric population, 
this group has fewer risk factors for cesarean delivery. The US Department of Health and 
Human Services (DHHS) Healthy People 2020 Objectives suggests 23.9% as a target for the 
NTSV cesarean delivery rate.5 Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG), The Joint Commission, and the DHHS Healthy People 2020 goals 
have identified a reduction in NTSV cesarean delivery rate as a meaningful objective.4–6
The rate of NTSV cesarean delivery at our institution was higher than state and national 
averages.7 Several findings suggest that the NTSV cesarean delivery rate may be modifiable. 
First, there is significant variation in rates among hospitals and providers.8 Second, elective 
obstetric practices influence the NTSV cesarean delivery rate.9 Third, among primary 
cesarean deliveries, subjective indications for cesarean delivery occurred more frequently 
than objective indications.10 Finally, associations between institutional or environmental 
factors and the NTSV rate have been noted.11,12
We identified factors that may have contributed to a high rate of NTSV cesarean delivery at 
our institution. Based on a review of our own quality improvement data and our assessment 
of relevant environmental factors on our Labor and Delivery Unit, validated by the available 
published literature on the NTSV cesarean delivery rate, we targeted interpretation and 
management of fetal heart rate tracings, tolerance for labor, induction of labor, provider

 awareness of NTSV cesarean delivery rates, and environmental stress. As a meta-analysis of 
evidenced-based strategies on reducing cesarean delivery rates demonstrated that 
multifaceted strategies including audit and feedback are effective at reducing cesarean 
delivery,13 we utilized provider education, provider audit and feedback, and implementation 
of new policies to address the identified factors.
The purpose of this project was to determine the impact of a series of quality improvement 
interventions on the NTSV cesarean delivery rate at our institution. This report is intended to 
describe a multi-strategy approach to target factors that influence the NTSV cesarean 
delivery rate. This approach can be replicated by other institutions intending to improve 
NTSV cesarean delivery rate as endorsed by ACOG, the Joint Commission, and DHHS 
Healthy People 2020.
METHODS
Setting
The setting was a single tertiary care academic medical center performing approximately 
4,700 deliveries per year during the study period. Intrapartum care was obstetrician-directed 
in a laborist-type model. Approximately one third of the deliveries were cared for by 
employed physicians, one third by private practitioners, and one third by a multi-specialty 
group. A maternal-fetal medicine group provided intrapartum care for complex patients.
Identification of Five Factors
Non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing is a leading indication for primary cesarean delivery.
10 In 2008, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development partnered with ACOG and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and 
published guidelines for nomenclature and a three-tiered system categorizing fetal heart rate 
patterns, as well as suggestions for managing each category of tracing.14 Category II, 
indeterminate tracings, were recognized as being unable to predict abnormal fetal acidbase 
status and thus not necessarily warranting management with cesarean delivery. Even 
Category III tracings may be initially managed with resuscitative measures. Given the 
frequency with which non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing is the indication for cesarean 
delivery, it was reasonable to assume that standardizing language and the approach to 
management of fetal heart rate tracings, particularly Category II tracings, could decrease 
NTSV cesarean delivery.
Similar to non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, abnormal labor curve or failure of labor to 
progress also is a common indication for primary cesarean delivery.10 Abnormal labor has 
been reported to complicate as many as 37% of deliveries of healthy nulliparous women at 
term.15 Sixty-eight percent of cesarean deliveries in women at term with a fetus in a vertex 
presentation were performed for abnormal labor.16 For decades, the labor curve was defined 
by the Friedman curve.17,18 Several authors have challenged this curve and proposed a more 
modern labor curve that accounts for increased use of anesthesia and increased body mass 
index (BMI).18–21 As increased BMI has been associated with a longer first stage of labor, it 
is important to consider the BMI of the contemporary population.22 The modern labor

 curves support slower cervical change and a later transition from latent to active labor. 
Adopting these models should increase tolerance for labor and lead to fewer cesarean 
deliveries for abnormal labor.
Adopting policies that promote vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) also may result 
in fewer NTSV cesarean deliveries. It is apparent that increasing VBAC rates would 
decrease total cesarean delivery rates. In addition, hospitals with higher rates of VBAC have 
been shown to have lower rates of NTSV cesarean delivery. Rosenstein et al. suggested that 
the ability to perform an immediate cesarean delivery may be the common link between 
higher VBAC rates and decreased NTSV cesarean delivery rate. They also suggest that an 
underlying culture that supports vaginal birth may increase VBAC rates and reduce primary 
cesarean delivery rates.23 It is plausible that increasing provider comfort with trial of labor 
after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) would increase tolerance for labor in low-risk women as 
well. In 2010, at a Consensus Development Conference, the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) recognized TOLAC as a reasonable option for many women with a prior cesarean 
delivery and called on organizations to facilitate access to TOLAC.24
Increased tolerance for labor may be influenced by a provider’s skill set, including 
proficiency in management of shoulder dystocia. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes without 
evidence of macrosomia shifts the practice style toward cesarean delivery, and it has been 
suggested that provider discretion results in unnecessarily high cesarean delivery rates in this 
population.25 One possible explanation for this finding is that provider concern for shoulder 
dystocia leads to preemptive cesarean deliveries. It is reasonable to consider that increasing a 
provider’s ability to manage shoulder dystocia could therefore reduce the NTSV cesarean 
delivery rate.
An additional skill that may promote tolerance of labor and vaginal delivery is instrument-
assisted or operative vaginal delivery. ACOG considers operative vaginal delivery an 
intervention that can be used to safely avoid cesarean delivery in the setting of prolonged 
second stage of labor and non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings. The rate of operative 
vaginal delivery has declined in recent decades in the United States contributing to the 
increase in cesarean delivery rate.26 A recent National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development workshop identified training in operative vaginal delivery as a critical 
component to reduce primary cesarean delivery.4 Based on these data, we assumed that the 
NTSV cesarean delivery rate could be decreased by increasing a provider’s ability to 
perform operative vaginal delivery.
Induction of labor, both medically indicated and elective, in nulliparous women at term, has 
been associated with a significant increase in the risk of cesarean delivery.9,27–29 Both 
medically indicated and elective induction of labor in nulliparous women at term have been 
associated with a significant increase in risk of cesarean delivery.9,28,29 Adopting guidelines 
that limit elective induction and induction in the setting of an unfavorable cervix would be 
expected to reduce the NTSV cesarean delivery rate.
As individual practice style has been identified as an important determinant of the wide 
variations in the rates of cesarean delivery among obstetricians, performing audits and

 providing feedback may increase provider awareness of NTSV cesarean delivery and 
improve outcomes.30–32 Indeed, Luthy et al. reported that variation in physician practice 
continues to be an important risk factor for cesarean delivery and described how direct 
feedback to providers resulted in a reduction in cesarean delivery rate.33
Changes in the environment to better position patients to have a successful vaginal birth and 
physicians to support a vaginal birth may result in decreased NTSV cesarean delivery rates. 
For example, increased support to laboring women may reduce the cesarean delivery rate.
34,35 This could be accomplished by implementing guidelines that increase the likelihood 
that a laboring woman would have continuous support. In addition, time constraints for 
scheduling on the Labor and Delivery Unit, varying operating room staff availability, and 
physician workload have been recognized as factors that likely impact decision making 
surrounding cesarean delivery.4 We hypothesized that modifying aspects of the environment 
that increase physician stress, increase physician demand, or increase doubt in the unit’s 
ability to efficiently and safely achieve an emergency cesarean delivery may improve a 
physician’s ability to be tolerant and supportive of labor and reduce the NTSV cesarean 
delivery.
Interventions and Outcomes
From 2008 through 2015, we implemented a series of interventions to address five factors 
that may influence the NTSV cesarean delivery rate (Figure 1). We addressed the first factor, 
standardization in interpretation and management of fetal heart rate tracings, in the 
following ways:36
•
We removed “failure to perform a cesarean delivery for non-reassuring fetal heart 
rate tracing” from our quality measures for our peer review committee and 
stopped providing provider feedback on this indicator.
•
We educated providers on the use of category systems to describe fetal heart rate 
tracings. Large posters and pocket cards with category nomenclature and details 
of each category were available for reference.
•
We changed the culture so that communication about fetal heart rate tracings 
required an assigned category; the term non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing 
was considered inadequate at board sign-out and in chart documentation. Leaders 
on Labor and Delivery were present at board sign-out to champion the transition 
to this new language.
•
We conducted a chart audit to ensure that providers were consistently meeting 
this expectation in documentation.
The second factor addressed was provider tolerance for labor:
•
We utilized mandatory participation in didactic and annual simulation training to 
address two areas relating to tolerance of labor: operative vaginal delivery and 
management of shoulder dystocia.
•
We adopted the NIH consensus statement on VBAC and encouraged providers to 
strongly consider VBAC for all eligible patients.
Vadnais et al.

 •
We provided education on the modern labor curve and redefined arrest of labor, 
allowing providers to avoid cesarean delivery based exclusively on failure to 
demonstrate cervical change at the previously expected rate. Leaders on the 
Labor and Delivery Unit supported provider patience with the labor curve.
Induction of labor was the third factor targeted in this initiative:
•
We addressed gestational age at time of induction with a hard stop on inductions 
prior to 39 weeks of gestation; over time, we advanced to our current state, 
which incorporates gestational age, parity, and cervical exam into timing of 
inductions and limits most inductions until 41 weeks of gestation. All requests to 
schedule an induction are reviewed by dedicated nurses; if they do not meet 
established criteria for induction, they are eligible to be approved only after 
review by the Director of Labor and Delivery.
•
We addressed cervical ripening agents with a departmental guideline outlining 
appropriate use of pharmacologic and mechanical (Foley bulb) agents.
•
We created a guideline on tachysystole to reduce the number of iatrogenic 
cesarean deliveries occurring with induction or augmentation of labor.
The clinical practice environment was the fourth factor we addressed. We focused on 
environmental factors relating to scheduled cesarean delivery, emergency cesarean delivery, 
and patient support:
•
We theorized that an inability to reliably predict when scheduled cesarean 
deliveries would occur and how long they would take resulted in pressure on the 
physicians to schedule planned cesarean deliveries for days when they were on 
call so that they would not interfere with clinical responsibilities off of the Labor 
and Delivery Unit. As a result, an individual provider would be responsible for 
more deliveries in a given shift. We hypothesized that the increase in workload, 
need to multitask, and need to coordinate multiple surgical cases may drive 
providers to perform intrapartum, unplanned cesarean deliveries earlier than they 
would otherwise. Accordingly, we changed the scheduling system so that 
scheduled cesarean deliveries would consistently start on time so providers could 
commit to scheduling them when they were not covering the Labor and Delivery 
Unit. We also standardized the steps for scheduled cesarean delivery in order to 
reduce wasted time, space, and personnel.
•
We implemented emergency cesarean delivery drills on the Labor and Delivery 
Unit. The aim of this was to increase provider confidence in the Labor and 
Delivery Unit’s ability to support a physician in quickly accomplishing an 
emergency cesarean delivery. We believed this would alleviate pressure to 
preemptively perform cesarean deliveries due to concern for inability to achieve 
emergency cesarean delivery with the level of efficiency desired by the provider.
•
We adopted a more liberal guideline regarding visitors on the Labor and Delivery 
Unit in order to increase the likelihood that a laboring woman would have 
continuous support.

 The fifth factor, provider awareness of the NTSV cesarean delivery rate, was addressed with 
audit and feedback:
•
We implemented an audit and provided all physicians with a biannual letter with 
personal and departmental rates for NTSV cesarean delivery. We chose to 
attribute deliveries to providers based on the documented “delivering physician” 
of record. We recognized that at times (for example, with deliveries occurring at 
the change of shift), the delivering physician would not have managed a 
significant portion of the labor; however, we felt these accounted for the minority 
of a provider’s cesarean deliveries and that over time they would not make a 
significant difference.
The interventions were largely initiated and implemented by the Director of Labor and 
Delivery, a board-certified obstetrician, in collaboration with other thought leaders and 
support from various interdisciplinary committees that included staff from nursing and 
anesthesiology.
The primary outcome was the rate of NTSV cesarean delivery. We recognize that the NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate is a proportion and not a rate; however, we chose this terminology to 
remain consistent with what is commonly used in the literature. Secondary outcomes 
included gestational age at the time delivery; birthweight; 5-minute Apgar score; and the 
incidence of neonatal ICU (NICU) admission for greater than 24 hours, meconium 
aspiration syndrome, shoulder dystocia, episiotomy, third- and fourth-degree laceration, and 
maternal blood transfusion.
Methods of Evaluation
We collected data on women with NTSV deliveries. Mode of delivery was collected from an 
internal online birth registry that contains data entered by physicians at the time of delivery; 
this was supplemented with individual chart review and administrative coding databases. 
Comorbidities, as well as maternal and neonatal outcomes, were determined using ICD-9-
CM codes (gestational hypertension 642.30– 642.34, 642.70–642.74, 642.90–642.94; 
preeclampsia/eclampsia 642.40–642.44, 642.50–642.54, 642.60–642.64; gestational diabetes 
648.80–648.84; episiotomy 72.1, 72.21, 72.31, 73.6; third-degree laceration 664.20, 664.21, 
664.24; fourth-degree laceration 664.31, 664.34; meconium aspiration syndrome 770.11, 
770.12; shoulder dystocia 660.40, 660.41, 660.43) and online birth registry data. Maternal 
transfusion data were collected from querying our blood bank database. We compared 
demographic and clinical characteristics after the start of the interventions (2008–2015) to 
the years prior to the start of the interventions (2005–2007). Interventions were introduced 
sequentially beginning in 2008; however, the interventions were sustainable and therefore 
overlapped in time. According to the policy activities that constitute research at our 
institution, this work met criteria for operational improvement activities exempt from ethics 
review.
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or proportion. The Cochran-Armitage 
test and linear regression were used to calculate the p-trend for categorical and continuous 
variables, respectively. All data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,

 North Carolina). All tests were two sided, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Study Population
A total of 51,973 deliveries occurred from 2008 through 2015. The number of annual NTSV 
deliveries ranged from 1,773 to 2,106, with a total of 15,144 NTSV deliveries over the 
intervention period. There were no meaningful differences in maternal age or insurance 
status during the intervention period. The proportion of white women decreased over time, 
but this was due to an increase in the proportion of women who were of unknown race/
ethnicity. The proportion of women with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, 
and gestational diabetes fluctuated over time, but these changes were neither consistent nor 
clinically meaningful (Table 1).
Outcomes
The rate of NTSV cesarean delivery at our institution decreased from 34.8% prior to the 
intervention period to 21.2% in 2015 (Figure 1, Table 2). Total cesarean delivery rate 
declined as well from 40.0% to 29.1% (data not shown). There was no change in the rate of 
operative vaginal delivery among NTSV deliveries.
The mean gestational age at the time of delivery increased from 39.3 to 39.6 weeks. There 
was a decline in average neonatal birth weight by approximately 45 grams. There was no 
difference in the incidence of 5-minute Apgar score less than 5 and no change in the 
incidence of NICU admission for greater than 24 hours. There was an increase in meconium 
aspiration syndrome over the course of our study, reaching an incidence of 0.9% in 2015. 
There was no change in the incidence of shoulder dystocia.
With the decline in cesarean delivery rate, there was a decline in the incidence of episiotomy 
and third-degree lacerations. The incidence of fourth-degree lacerations remained stable. 
The incidence of maternal blood transfusion increased to 1.4% by 2015, but sub-analysis—
excluding the baseline years 2005–2007—demonstrated no significant trend in the incidence 
of transfusion (p = 0.49).
DISCUSSION
Nationwide, there has been a decline in the NTSV cesarean delivery that has exceeded the 
pace of decline of the overall cesarean delivery rate. In Massachusetts, the decline in NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate has exceeded all other states with a 19% decrease from 2009 to 2013.7 
In approximately that same time span, we implemented a multi-strategy approach including 
provider education, provider feedback, and implementation of new policies to target the 
following five factors that may influence the NTSV cesarean delivery rate: interpretation and 
management of fetal heart rate tracings, provider tolerance for labor, induction of labor, 
provider awareness of NTSV cesarean delivery rate, and environmental stress. With the 
implementation of these quality improvement interventions aimed at decreasing NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate, our institution demonstrated a 39% decrease in NTSV cesarean

 delivery rate, meeting the DHHS Healthy People 2020 goal. In addition, the findings for 
secondary outcomes are reassuring. The small decline in mean birth weight of 
approximately 45 grams to a mean of 3,346 grams is unlikely to be clinically significant 
with regard to risk of NTSV cesarean delivery. The increase in the incidence of preeclampsia 
and diabetes would be expected to increase the rate of NTSV cesarean delivery; however, we 
did not observe this.
An increase in meconium aspiration syndrome was observed; however, the incidence peaked 
at 0.9%, which is lower than the reported incidence of 1.8% in term deliveries.37 As labor 
and vaginal delivery are significant risk factors for meconium aspiration syndrome, one 
could anticipate such an increase may accompany increasing vaginal delivery rates. The 
mean 5-minute Apgar score and the rate of NICU admission for more than 24 hours were 
stable throughout the study period. We did not detect a difference in the rate of neonatal 
demise (data not presented), but this study was not powered to do so. Our data are 
insufficient to draw a conclusion about the clinical significance of the increase in the 
incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome that may accompany a decrease in NTSV 
cesarean delivery.
The incidence of maternal transfusion increased from approximately 0.6% to 1.4%. There 
was no significant difference in the incidence of maternal transfusion from 2008 through 
2015. An increase in maternal transfusion would not be expected, as the risk of maternal 
transfusion is higher with cesarean delivery compared to vaginal delivery. It is possible, 
however, that longer labors that result from an increase in tolerance for labor may increase 
the incidence of blood transfusion associated with vaginal delivery. Increasing age and BMI 
also are risk factors for blood transfusion and may contribute to this risk. Alternatively, the 
incidence of transfusion reported during the baseline years (2005–2007) may simply be an 
outlier. Any increase in the risk of blood transfusion that results directly from interventions 
that decrease the NTSV cesarean delivery rate should be considered in the context of the 
risks and benefits of vaginal delivery compared to primary cesarean delivery; the risk of 
transfusion with primary cesarean delivery is approximately 2%–4%.2
A significant unintended consequence was encountered. From 2005 to the end of 2014, the 
average census on Labor and Delivery increased from six to eight patients, and the average 
number of minutes that beds were occupied increased steadily. Between 2011 and 2015, the 
average number of minutes that a single patient occupied a bed on Labor and Delivery 
increased by 116 minutes. As the rate of NTSV cesarean delivery decreased, the amount of 
time that patients occupied beds on the Labor and Delivery Unit increased, leading to a 
perception of higher volume despite a relatively stable number of annual deliveries. We 
believe this is primarily a direct result of the decrease in NTSV cesarean delivery rate; there 
were no other changes in processes that would impact this. This higher rate of bed 
occupancy is likely due to the increased amount of time involved in labor and vaginal 
delivery compared to cesarean delivery.
There are limitations to our study. Because we used a series of interventions targeting drivers 
of NTSV cesarean delivery, and the effects may be cumulative, we cannot measure the 
impact of any single intervention. We utilized administrative data and ICD-9-CM codes. We

 did not have data on BMI, and increased BMI is associated with increased risk of cesarean 
delivery. However, in the general population, BMI has been increasing, and there is no 
reason to believe our sample of patients differs from the general population with regard to 
BMI. If BMI increased over time in our sample of women, one would expect to observe less 
of a reduction in NTSV cesarean delivery rate than would be observed in a sample with 
stable BMI. There may be confounding factors that we did not appreciate that affect NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate. Midwifery care was offered to approximately one third of the patients 
at our institution beginning in March 2014.We were unable to measure how this may have 
contributed to the reduction in NTSV cesarean delivery in the final 21 months of our study. 
A recent Cochrane Review reported no difference in cesarean delivery rates between women 
receiving care in a midwife-led continuity model of care and those receiving care in other 
models.38 Other publications suggest that midwifery care may be associated with lower rates 
of cesarean delivery,39 and it is plausible that the presence of midwives on the Labor and 
Delivery Unit could contribute to a culture that would promote vaginal birth and reduce the 
NTSV cesarean delivery rate.
One physician champion served as the leader of this initiative throughout the course of this 
study; this may be difficult to achieve at other institutions. Senior obstetricians’ interest in 
the provision and quality of intrapartum care may be linked to cesarean delivery rates.12 We 
believe the involvement of formal leaders, thought leaders, and additional stakeholders was 
an important element in the design of this project and would recommend that this aspect be 
incorporated into a comprehensive quality improvement project intended to reduce the rate 
of NTSV cesarean delivery.
The next step at our institution aimed to reduce NTSV cesarean delivery rate may be to limit 
admission to Labor and Delivery in early labor. First birth early admission rates account for 
a significant portion of the variation in NTSV cesarean delivery rates.9 Further study is 
needed to evaluate decreased rate of NTSV cesarean delivery with maternal and neonatal 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION
A reduction in NTSV cesarean delivery rate may have a substantial impact on health care. 
Hospitals can implement quality improvement initiatives reported here to decrease NTSV 
cesarean delivery rate. Aspects of this project such as provider education, provider feedback, 
and change in policy are generalizable to many institutions. Interventions to address 
environmental or cultural concerns can be customized to meet the needs of a particular 
institution. We believe the involvement of formal leaders and thought leaders was an 
important element in the design of this project and would recommend that this feature be 
incorporated into a comprehensive quality improvement project intended to reduce the rate 
of NTSV cesarean delivery.
