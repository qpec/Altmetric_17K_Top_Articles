H
ousehold food insecurity — defined as inadequate or 
insecure access to food because of financial constraints 
— is a serious public health problem in affluent western 
countries,1–3 and it disproportionately affects households with 
children.1,2 In Canada, household food insecurity has been linked 
to myriad physical and mental health problems,4–8 to poorer 
chronic disease management9,10 and to heightened nutritional 
vulnerability among adults and children,11 but its impact on 
infant nutrition is less clear. Because breastfeeding offers a 
secure, low-cost, optimal food supply for infants, Canadian 
health policy and public health programs promote it as a key 
strategy to protect vulnerable infants from food insecurity.12–15 
However, there is some question as to the extent to which 
women struggling with food insecurity can follow breastfeeding 
recommendations.14 
Adherence to current breastfeeding recommendations is 
poor in Canada,16 particularly among socially and economic-
ally vulnerable women,17,18 but the effects of household food 
insecurity on breastfeeding rates have not been examined. 
Qualitative studies have suggested that food insecurity con-
tributes to the early cessation of breastfeeding,14,19 and a 1998–
2002 Quebec study suggested that breastfeeding to 4 months 
was less common among infants in food-insufficient than food-
sufficient families, although the difference was not statistically 
significant.20 Studying the effects of household food insecurity 
on infant feeding is complicated by the fact that women in 
food-insecure households are more likely to experience 
depression and diabetes mellitus,7,21,22 conditions that have 
been found to affect breastfeeding initiation and duration 
negatively.23,24

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Qualitative studies have 
suggested that food insecurity adversely 
affects infant feeding practices. We 
aimed to determine how household 
food insecurity relates to breastfeeding 
initiation, duration of exclusive breast-
feeding and vitamin D supplementation 
of breastfed infants in Canada.
METHODS: We studied 10 450 women 
who had completed the Maternal 
Experi 
ences — Breastfeeding Module 
and the Household Food Security Sur-
vey Module of the Canadian Community 
Health Survey (2005–2014) and who had 
given birth in the year of or year before 
their interview. We used multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards models and 
logistic regression to examine the rela-
tion between food insecurity and infant 
feeding practices, adjusting for socio-
demographic characteristics, maternal 
mood disorders and diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: Overall, 17% of the women 
reported household food insecurity, of 
whom 8.6% had moderate food insecur-
ity and 2.9% had severe food insecurity 
(weighted percentages). After adjust-
ment for sociodemographic factors, 
women with food insecurity were no less 
likely than others to initiate breastfeed-
ing or provide vitamin D supplementa-
tion to their infants. Half of the women 
with food insecurity ceased exclusive 
breastfeeding by 2 months, whereas 
most of those with food security per-
sisted with breastfeeding for 4 months or 
more. Relative to women with food secur-
ity, those with marginal, moderate and 
severe food insecurity had significantly 
lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding to 
4 months, but only women with moder-
ate food insecurity had lower odds of 
exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, 
independent of sociodemographic char-
acteristics (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.39–0.92). Adjustment for 
maternal mood disorder or diabetes 
slightly attenuated these relationships. 
INTERPRETATION: Mothers caring for 
infants in food-insecure households 
attempted to follow infant feeding rec-
ommendations, but were less able than 
women with food security to sustain 
exclusive breastfeeding. Our findings 
highlight the need for more effective 
interventions to support food-insecure 
families with newborns.

Drawing on data from the Canadian Community Health Sur-
vey, we aimed to determine how household food insecurity status 
relates to breastfeeding initiation, duration of exclusive breast-
feeding, exclusive breastfeeding to 4 months, and adherence to 
recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months and for 
supplementation of breastfed infants with vitamin D.
Methods
Survey and sample
The Canadian Community Health Survey is a population-
representative survey of about 130 000 individuals 12 years or 
older per cycle. Since 2005, it has included assessment of house-
hold food insecurity over the past 12 months using the Household 
Food Security Survey Module.25 Information about recent births 
and infant feeding practices is captured using the Maternal 
 
Experiences — Breastfeeding Module,26 which is administered to 
female respondents 15 to 55 years of age who report having given 
birth in the previous 5 years. The module collects data on breast-
feeding initiation and duration and on vitamin supplementation 
of the respondent and her infant. However, neither of these 
2 modules has been administered in all provinces and territories 
in every cycle of the Canadian Community Health Survey.
To maximize the sample size, we pooled data from the 2005, 
2007/08, 2009/10, 2011/12 and 2013/14 survey cycles. The House-
hold Food Security Survey Module was optional in 2005, 2009/10 
and 2013/14, and the Maternal Experiences — Breastfeeding Mod-
ule was optional in 2013/14, meaning that the administration of 
these modules was at the discretion of the province or territory (for 
a list of the provinces and territories with both modules, by survey 
cycle, see Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170880/-/DC1). We included only respondents to 
whom both modules were administered, and we restricted our 
sample to women who reported having given birth in the year of or 
the year before the interview, to obtain relatively concurrent data 
on household food security and infant feeding behaviours. House-
hold income was imputed by Statistics Canada for all participants 
with missing data (about 30% of the sample). We excluded respon-
dents with missing values for any other variable used in our 
analyses. 
Measures
We determined household food insecurity status from the num-
ber of affirmative responses to the 18 questions in the Household 
Food Security Survey Module (listed in Appendix 2, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170880/-/DC1). We 
applied Health Canada’s coding method (Appendix 3, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170880/-/DC1) 
to define moderate and severe household food insecurity.25 
Women with 1 affirmative response were classified as having 
marginal food insecurity, and those with no affirmative responses 
were considered to have food security. 
Breastfeeding initiation was indicated by an affirmative 
response to the question, “Did you breastfeed or try to breast-
feed your baby, even if only for a short time?” Duration of exclu-
sive breastfeeding was determined by the age of the infant when 
non-breastmilk liquids or solids were first introduced. The survey 
explicitly refers to the mother’s experience with her last baby.
The presence of mood disorders and diabetes was reported on 
the basis of diagnosis by a health professional and the condition 
having lasted or being expected to last for 6 months or more. Mood 
disorders included depression, bipolar disorder, mania and dysthy-
mia. Diabetes included type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes.
Statistical analysis
We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the relation 
between household food insecurity status and breastfeeding initi-
ation, adjusting for the following maternal and household 
sociodemographic characteristics, previously identified as being 
associated with food insecurity and infant feeding practices in 
Canada:7,16,17,27 maternal age, presence of a partner, maternal edu-
cation, maternal immigration status (defined in terms of citizen-
ship at birth), Aboriginal status, number of children in the house-
hold and household income (converted to 2014 constant dollars 
using the Consumer Price Index and adjusted for family size by 
dividing by the square root of household size). We also adjusted 
for survey year to account for variation in the composition of our 
sample across survey cycles (as detailed in Appendix 1) and possi-
ble secular trends in infant feeding practices. Because women in 
food-insecure households are more likely to suffer from depres-
sion and diabetes,7,21,22 and because these conditions negatively 
affect breastfeeding initiation and duration,23,24 binary variables 
denoting the presence of mood disorders or diabetes were added 
to the adjusted model to control for potential confounding fac-
tors associated with women’s health status.
To examine the relation between duration of exclusive breast-
feeding up to 6 months and household food insecurity status, we 
ran a series of 4 Cox proportional hazards models on the sub-
group of women who initiated breastfeeding but reported having 
ceased exclusive breastfeeding by the time of the Canadian Com-
munity Health Survey interview. These models provided esti-
mates (hazard ratios [HRs]) of early exclusive breastfeeding ces-
sation rates for women by food insecurity status. Following the 
computation of unadjusted hazard ratios, we re-ran the model 
including survey year and the sociodemographic covariables 
described above, and then adding binary variables denoting the 
presence of a mood disorder or diabetes.
We explored the relation between household food insecurity 
status and the continuation of any breastfeeding after early cessa-
tion of exclusive breastfeeding (defined here as cessation before 
6 mo) among the subset of women who began breastfeeding but 
ceased exclusive breastfeeding before 6 months. We examined 
mean duration of continued breastfeeding using logistic regres-
sion with contrasts to compare women with food security and 
women with marginal, moderate or severe food insecurity. 
Within the subgroup of women who initiated breastfeeding, 
we used multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine 
the relation between household food insecurity status and the 
odds of women reaching 4 or 6 months of exclusive breastfeed-
ing and following recommendations for vitamin D supplementa-
tion.28 We adjusted these models for survey year and the socio-
demographic covariables described above and then re-ran them

including binary variables denoting the presence of a mood dis-
order or diabetes. Information on vitamin D supplementation 
was available for the subgroup of women who breastfed for at 
least 1 week. The duration of exclusive breastfeeding was also 
assessed in relation to thresholds of 4 and 6 months. Six months 
is the current global recommendation,28 although infants may be 
fed complementary foods earlier than 6 months if they show 
signs of readiness;28 the introduction of complementary foods 
before 4 months is potentially detrimental to infant health.29
As a sensitivity analysis to examine how the exclusion of 
women with missing data for sociodemographic variables 
affected our results, we re-ran all of the unadjusted models with 
these women included in the sample.
We conducted all analyses with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). 
To account for the complex survey design, we used proc survey 
commands with bootstrap replications (n = 500) and bootstrap 
weights provided by Statistics Canada. In keeping with Statistics 
Canada’s disclosure policies for analyses of survey microdata in 
the Research Data Centres, we report here the rounded, 
unweighted sample size, but weighted prevalence and parameter 
estimates.
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the research ethics board of the 
 
University of Toronto.
Results
The original sample was about 10 550 women (rounded); of 
these, about 100 women (rounded) were excluded because of 
missing data (mostly for the education and Aboriginal identity 
variables). Our final sample was 10 450 women (rounded). The 
sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample and prev-
alence of mood disorders and diabetes are presented in Table 1.

Seventeen percent of women were living in food-insecure house-
holds: 5.5% with marginal food insecurity, 8.6% with moderate 
food insecurity and 2.9% with severe food insecurity (Table 1). 
Most women initiated breastfeeding: 91.6% of those with 
food security, 88.8% of those with marginal food insecurity, 
83.3% of those with moderate food insecurity and 86.0% of 
those with severe food insecurity. Once sociodemographic 
characteristics were taken into account, breastfeeding initia-
tion was unrelated to household food insecurity status (Appen-
dix 4, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170880/-/DC1).
Among women who initiated breastfeeding (rounded n = 
7950), the duration of exclusive breastfeeding differed mark-
edly by household food insecurity status. Irrespective of the 
severity of food insecurity, almost half of women with food 
insecurity had ceased exclusive breastfeeding by 2 months, 
whereas half of women with food security exclusively breastfed 
to at least 4 months (Figure 1). In the unadjusted model, exclu-
sive breastfeeding appeared to be negatively affected by all 
3 levels of food insecurity. After adjustment for sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, only the relation with moderate food 
insecurity remained significant (HR 1.26, 95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 1.06–1.48); the hazard ratios for marginal food insecu-
rity and severe food insecurity were HR 1.18 (95% CI 0.99–1.39) 
and HR 1.21 (95% CI 0.97–1.52), respectively (Table 2). When the 
presence of a mood disorder or diabetes was taken into 
account, severe food insecurity lost marginal significance (HR 
1.20, 95% CI 0.96–1.50 and HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96–1.49 for mood 
disorder or diabetes, respectively). 
Of women who stopped exclusive breastfeeding before 
6 months (rounded n = 4300), 45.3% of those with food security, 
36.3% of those with marginal food insecurity, 41.3% of those 
with moderate food insecurity and 35.0% of those with severe 
food insecurity continued to breastfeed their infant for at least 
1 month. These rates were not significantly different (p = 0.3). 
There was no significant difference in the mean duration of 
continued breastfeeding between mothers with food security 
(1.7 mo) and those with marginal (1.5 mo; p = 0.7) or moderate 
(1.4; p = 0.2) food insecurity, but mothers with severe food 
 
insecurity continued to breastfeed for a significantly shorter 
time (1.2 mo; p = 0.04) than mothers with food security.
Independent of sociodemographic characteristics, the odds 
of exclusive breastfeeding to 4 months were lower among 
women with any level of food insecurity compared with women 
who had food security, but only women in moderately food-
insecure households had significantly lower odds of reaching 
the recommended 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding (odds 
ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.39–0.92) (Table 3). There was no relation 
between household food insecurity status and a mother’s odds 
of providing her baby with vitamin D supplementation once 
sociodemographic characteristics were taken into account. The 
presence of a mood disorder or diabetes did not significantly 
alter these relations. The inclusion of missing respondents in the 
unadjusted models did not alter the observed associations 
between household food insecurity status and any of the out-
comes (data not shown). 
Interpretation
Most of the women in this study initiated breastfeeding and pro-
vided their infants with vitamin D supplementation, irrespective 
of their household food insecurity status, but food insecurity 
negatively affected the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. 
Although exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months was not the norm 
even among women in food-secure households, women with 
food insecurity ceased exclusive breastfeeding sooner than other 
women, and this effect was independent of other known influ-
ences on breastfeeding.
The earlier cessation of exclusive breastfeeding by women in 
food-insecure households means that their infants are less likely 
to reap the physical and emotional health benefits of breast-
feeding,29,30 and the women will not gain the risk reductions for 
obesity, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and ovarian cancer that 
have been associated with breastfeeding.31 The cessation of 
exclusive breastfeeding is also problematic because it necessi-
tates formula feeding, which creates a financial burden that 
food-insecure families can ill afford. Qualitative research has 
suggested that mothers in food-insecure circumstances struggle 
to maintain an adequate supply of formula, and the help avail-
able from food banks and other community agencies is often 
insufficient.14,19,32 Thus, the early cessation of breastfeeding for 
infants in food-insecure households may have further negative 
implications for infant nutrition. 
Our study focused on the first 6 months of life, but insofar 
as households remain food insecure, infants in these settings 
are likely to experience other disadvantages. Longitudinal 
research from Quebec has shown that the exposure of toddlers 
to food insecurity increases their odds of persistent hyperac-
tivity and inattention later in childhood,33 and nationally, chil-
dren’s exposure to hunger has been found to predict poorer 
general health and the diagnosis of chronic health conditions 
(e.g., asthma, depression) several years later.34–36 Although we

lack data on the duration of food insecurity for the families 
in this study, other Canadian research has suggested that 
household food insecurity, particularly severe food insecurity, 
is a persistent rather than a transient experience for most 
families.33,37
Our findings raise serious questions about the adequacy of 
existing supports for mothers vulnerable to food insecurity. 
There is some evidence that women with food insecurity who 
have high levels of participation in programs operated through 
the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program38 are more likely to initi-
ate and continue breastfeeding than less involved, food-insecure 
participants,39 but neither the proportion of women with food 
insecurity participating in these programs nor the effect of pro-
gram participation on household food insecurity is known. The 
potential for income-based interventions to affect infant feeding 
practices positively is suggested by the significant increase in 
breastfeeding initiation observed among low-income women in 
Manitoba following a modest prenatal income supplement,40 but 
the supplement ended at birth and neither household food 
 
insecurity nor breastfeeding duration was assessed. Given the 
sensitivity of household food insecurity to improvements in 
income,41–43 programs providing income supplements to low-
income pregnant women and new mothers (e.g., Newfoundland 
and Labrador’s Mother and Baby Nutrition Supplement and New 
Brunswick’s Pre/Postnatal Benefit Program) may be effective in 
reducing household food insecurity and may thereby support 
healthy infant feeding practices; however, program evaluations 
are needed for confirmation. It will also be important to evaluate 
the effects of the Canada Child Benefit, introduced in July 2016, 
on household food insecurity status and breastfeeding duration.
The effectiveness of public health efforts to encourage breast-
feeding as a food security strategy for infants may be contingent 
on the reduction of household food insecurity, but more research 
is needed to identify the most effective and efficient means of 
intervention.
Limitations
To maximize our sample of mothers with food insecurity, we 
pooled several population surveys, including some without 
comprehensive national data. Although there were no changes 
in infant feeding recommendations over this period, we charted 
some year-to-year variation in breastfeeding initiation and 
early cessation. Given variation in the composition of our sam-
ple by survey year, we cannot infer secular trends from these 
results. Additionally, the relatively small number of women 
with severe food insecurity in the sample limited our analyses 
of the effect of severity of household food insecurity on infant 
feeding practices. This study was also limited by the fact that 
the available measures of food insecurity, infant feeding behav-
iours and maternal health are not exactly concurrent. In the

absence of data on the exact age of the most recently born 
child at the time of the woman’s interview, we included 
 
mothers in our sample if they gave birth in the year of or year 
before the survey interview. Thus, our sample must include 
women for whom the 12-month assessment of household food 
insecurity and measures of maternal mood disorders and dia-
betes did not overlap with the first 6 months of their infant’s 
life. To the extent that these sources of error influenced our 
analyses, they would bias our findings toward the null. We were 
also limited in our measure of adherence to recommendations 
for vitamin D supplementation, because we lacked data on sup-
plementation frequency, duration and dose; this precluded 
assessment of women’s adherence to the 10 µg (400 IU) per day 
recommendation.28 
Conclusion
The early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding among women in 
households with food insecurity highlights the need for more 
effective interventions to support vulnerable women with new-
borns and to address the underlying causes of food insecurity 
among Canadian families.
