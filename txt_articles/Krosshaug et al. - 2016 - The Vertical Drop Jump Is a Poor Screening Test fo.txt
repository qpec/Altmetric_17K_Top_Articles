Investigation performed at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway 
Background: The evidence linking knee kinematics and kinetics during a vertical drop jump (VDJ) 
to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk is restricted to a single small sample. Still, the VDJ 
test continues to be advocated for clinical screening purposes. 
Purpose: To test whether 5 selected kinematic and kinetic variables were associated with future 
ACL injuries in a large cohort of Norwegian female elite soccer and handball players. Furthermore, 
the authors wanted to assess whether the VDJ test can be recommended as a screening test to identify 
players with increased risk. 
Study design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. 
Methods: Elite female soccer and handball players participated in preseason screening tests from 
2007 through 2014. The tests included marker-based 3-dimensional motion analysis of a drop-jump 
landing. The authors followed a predefined statistical protocol in which they included the following 
candidate risk factors in 5 separate logistic regression analyses, with new ACL injury as the 
outcome: (1) knee valgus angle at initial contact, (2) peak knee abduction moment, (3) peak knee 
flexion angle, (4) peak vertical ground-reaction force, and (5) medial knee displacement. 
Results: A total of 782 players were tested (age, 21 ± 4 years; height, 170 ± 7 cm; body mass, 67 ± 8 
kg), of which 710 were included in the analyses. The authors registered 42 new noncontact ACL 
injuries, including 12 in previously ACL-injured players. Previous ACL injury (relative risk, 3.8; 
95% CI, 2.1-7.1) and medial knee displacement (odds ratio, 1.40; 1.12-1.74 per 1-SD change) were 
associated with increased risk for injury. However, there was an association with medial knee 
 2 
displacement among the 643 players with no history of previous injury. A receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis of medial knee displacement showed an area under the curve of 0.6, 
indicating a poor-to-failed combined sensitivity and specificity of the test, even when including 
previously injured players. 
Conclusion: Of the 5 risk factors considered, medial knee displacement was the only factor 
associated with increased risk for ACL. However, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
indicated a poor combined sensitivity and specificity when medial knee displacement was used as a 
screening test for predicting ACL injury. For players with no previous injury, none of the VDJ 
variables were associated with increased injury risk. 
Clinical Relevance: VDJ tests cannot predict ACL injuries in female elite soccer and handball 
players.

vertical drop jump 
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries represent a significant concern in sports because of the 
serious consequences for the injured athlete, with time lost from sport and decreased performance. 
The long-term consequences may be even more severe, with increased risk of early osteoarthritis, 
reduced knee function, and pain.32,42,46,64 A high incidence of ACL injury has been reported in 
pivoting sports such as soccer (football), basketball, and handball, and the incidence is 3 to 5 times 
higher among women than men.3,40,41,51,66 
However, 50% to 65% of noncontact ACL injuries in team sports can be prevented through 
exercise programs focusing on neuromuscular control, balance, strength, and technique.21,39,63 Still, 
we do not know to what extent each of these program components contributes to the overall 
effect63,64 nor do we know if and how programs can be tailored to the at-risk athlete. Also, 
implementation, adoption, and maintenance of programs in real life remain a challenge, as they may 
be perceived as time-consuming.59 
ACL injuries are multifactorial in nature54,56,55,57 and motion patterns are believed to play a 
key role. This assumption is partly based on the effect seen from injury prevention programs 
focusing on lower limb alignment and soft landings21,39,63 and also from video analyses of actual 
ACL injury situations, suggesting that poor frontal plane knee control is a key feature of the 
mechanism of injury9,10,15,25,26,31,47.9,10,15,25,26,31,48 
Hewett et al23 were the first to suggest that a vertical drop-jump (VDJ) test could be used to 
screen for ACL injury risk. They tested this hypothesis in a 1-season prospective cohort study on 205 
female athletes and found that the 9 athletes (7 during soccer and 2 during basketball) with a 
confirmed ACL injury displayed greater knee abduction angles and moments, higher ground-reaction 
forces, and shorter stance times, concluding that knee motion and knee loading during a VDJ task are 
predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes. However, this finding has not been replicated by 
others. In fact, Smith et al57 screened 5047 male and female high school and college athletes using a 
VDJ landing task, albeit with frontal and sagittal video analyses, and could not identify any factors 
related to lower limb and trunk motion that could be used to separate the 28 athletes suffering an 
ACL injury from 64 matched controls. 
Nevertheless, even if the evidence linking knee kinematics and kinetics during a VDJ test to 
ACL injury risk is restricted to a single small sample23,23 the test continues to be advocated for 
clinical screening purposes.16,36,38,44,45 
The aim of this study was therefore to test whether 5 carefully selected kinematic and kinetic 
variables were associated with future ACL injuries in a large cohort of Norwegian female elite 
 3 
 
 
soccer and handball players. Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether the VDJ test can be 
recommended as a screening test to identify players with increased injury risk. We hypothesized that 
greater knee valgus angles at initial contact, greater peak knee abduction moments, lower peak knee 
flexion angles, higher peak vertical ground-reaction forces (vGRFs), and greater medial knee 
displacement during the contact phase would be associated with increased risk for sustaining an ACL 
injury. 
METHODS 
Study Design and Participants 
This prospective cohort study started in 2007, when we invited all teams in the Norwegian female 
handball premier league to a comprehensive preseason baseline screening examination, including a 
VDJ test. Players with a first-team contract who were expected to play in the premier league during 
the 2007 season were eligible for participation. From 2008 through 2013, new teams advancing to 
the premier league and new players from included teams were invited for preseason tests. From 
2009, we also included soccer players from the female premier league. A total of 372 handball 
players and 338 soccer players were included in the cohort. The Regional Committee for Medical 
Research Ethics, the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, and the Norwegian Social 
Science Data Services, Norway, approved the study. Players signed a written informed consent form 
before inclusion (including parental consent for players aged <18 years). 
Three-dimensional Motion Analysis 
We instructed players to drop off of a 30-cm box and perform a maximal jump upon landing with 
their feet on 2 separate force platforms (LG6-4-1; Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc). They 
were allowed up to 3 practice trials, and a minimum of 3 valid trials were collected for each player. 
At least 2 testers observed the execution of the jump and verbally encouraged maximal jump effort. 
If submaximal effort was suspected or if the player jumped instead of dropped off the box (ie, 
increasing the vertical center-of-mass position at takeoff from the box), the player was asked to 
repeat the jump. 
Players wore their own indoor shoes (handball shoes, indoor soccer shoes, or jogging shoes), 
shorts, and a sports bra. A 35-marker setup was used to describe full-body kinematics.27 In addition, 
from 2008 to 2011, we used 2 markers (left and right iliac crest) in some subjects (ie, when the 
markers on the left and right anterior superior iliac spine were occluded). From 2012 and onward, we 
included the crest markers consistently for all players but used them only in cases where the anterior 
superior iliac spine markers were occluded. 
All marker positions—the ones over anatomic landmarks as well as the ones placed on 
muscle bellies—were uniquely defined.37 For every test session, 1 research assistant (physical 
therapist or medical student) was responsible for placing markers on all players to ensure 
consistency. 
From 2007 to 2012, we used eight 240-Hz infrared cameras (ProReflex; Qualisys) to capture 
motion while we recorded ground-reaction forces using 2 force platforms collecting at 960 Hz. From 
2012, we used an upgraded 16-camera 480-Hz camera system (Oqus 4; Qualisys). We calibrated the 
motion analysis system according to guidelines of the manufacturer and calculated and tracked 
marker trajectories using the Qualisys Track Manager. 
 4 
 
 
We defined the contact phase as the period where the unfiltered vGRF exceeded 20 N. 
Marker trajectories and force data were filtered and interpolated with Woltring’s69 smoothing spline 
in the cubic mode, with a 15-Hz cutoff.27 
We calculated the hip joint center using the method proposed by Bell et al,5 with the anterior-
posterior position of the hip joint defined by the anterior-posterior position of the marker over the 
greater trochanter. Furthermore, we defined the knee joint center according to Davis et al12 and the 
ankle joint center according to Eng and Winter17.17 Total body mass and anatomic coordinate 
systems of the thigh and shank were determined from the static calibration trial. We defined the 
vertical axis in the direction from the distal to the proximal joint center, while the anteroposterior 
axis was defined perpendicular to the vertical axis with no mediolateral component. The third axis 
was the cross product of the vertical and anteroposterior axes. Consequently, all segments had 
neutral internal-external rotation in the static calibration trial. We obtained technical, dynamic thigh 
and shank segment coordinate systems using an optimization procedure involving singular value 
decomposition.58 
We estimated inertia parameters based on 46 measures of segment heights, perimeters, and 
widths using a modified method by Yeadon71,72 with hand and foot parameters calculated with the 
method of Zatsiorsky and Seluyanov72.73 Body height was measured in the standing position with a 
right-angle tool and tape measure. 
We calculated external hip and knee joint moments with inverse dynamics using recursive 
Newton-Euler equations of motion as described by Davis et al12 and projected them onto the 3 
rotational axes of the joint according to the joint coordinate system standard.8,22,29,70 
We used the Grood and Suntay22 convention for calculating joint angles from the marker-
based motion analysis. We calculated medial knee position as the perpendicular distance between the 
knee joint center and the line joining the ankle and hip joint centers, projected on the frontal plane 
(Figure 1). We calculated medial knee position only when the knee joint center was medial to the 
hip-ankle line. Otherwise, medial knee position was set to zero. The difference between medial knee 
position at initial foot contact and the peak value was defined as the medial knee displacement. An 
advantage of this convention as compared with a pure knee separation measure is that we were able 
to assess knee control individually for the left and right legs. We ran all calculations using custom 
Matlab scripts (MathWorks Inc).

Figure 1. 
Medial knee position was measured in the frontal plane, as the perpendicular distance from the knee 
joint center to the line connecting the hip and ankle joint. The difference between the medial knee 
position at the initial foot contact and the peak value was defined as the medial knee displacement.

Injury Registration 
We recorded all complete ACL injuries among the tested players through March 2014, primarily 
through semiannual contact with the participating teams (manager, coach, medical staff). If any acute 
knee injuries occurring during regular team training or competition were reported, we contacted the 
injured player by phone to obtain detailed medical data and a description of the injury situation. All 
ACL injuries were verified by magnetic resonance imaging and/or arthroscopy.

Statistical Protocol 
We followed a rigorous protocol with predefined procedures and variables of interest as described 
below. To ensure high statistical power, we decided to limit the number of primary variables 
(potential risk factors) to 5. We selected these variables based on a step-by-step approach. First, on 
the basis of a literature review, we concluded that factors related to frontal plane knee control and 
landing stiffness were most likely to be associated with injury risk. These studies included the 
prospective cohort study of Hewett et al,23 intervention studies on injury prevention programs,21,39,63 
and studies on injury mechanisms13,14,25,26,31,33,34,55,60,67,68.13,14,25,26,31,33,34,56,61,68,69 [FOOTNOTE] Next, 
we investigated the correlations among all candidate risk factors to avoid including highly correlated 
factors, and we included only variables with good or excellent reliability. We interpreted the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) according to Fleiss19 as poor (<0.40), fair (0.40-0.59), good 
(0.60-0.75), and excellent (>0.75). 
Ultimately, we included the following candidate risk factors, measured during the stance 
phase of the vertical drop jump: (1) knee valgus angle at initial contact, (2) peak knee abduction 
moment, (3) peak knee flexion angle, (4) peak vGRF, and (5) medial knee displacement. 
We chose knee valgus at initial contact and peak knee abduction moment as candidate factors 
based on Hewett et al,23 who found these to be associated with injury. We also included medial knee 
displacement as a simple and robust measure of frontal plane knee control during the contact phase. 
Medial knee displacement, as defined here, is a similar measure to those previously reported from 
studies based on subjective assessment or 2-dimensional video analyses in VDJ screening 
tests16,36,44,62.16,36,45,63 We furthermore chose medial knee displacement rather than peak knee valgus 
angle, for example, as the peak angle had a strong correlation with knee valgus angle at initial 
contact (r > 0.80). 
We chose peak knee flexion angle and peak vGRF as measures of landing stiffness. These 
variables displayed the highest intercorrelation among the 5 variables (r = –0.59). 
Reliability of the Primary Variables 
The short-term test-retest reliability of the potential risk factor variables is described by Mok et al. 
(unpublished). All the primary variables of the present study achieved good to excellent within- and 
between-session reliability. The medial knee displacement had a within-session ICC of 0.91, whereas 
the between-session ICC was 0.75. To examine long-term changes, we retested 107 players (mean ± 
SD age, 20.7 ± 3.3 years) 1 to 4 years after the first test session (mean ± SD, 2.2 ± 0.7 years). We 
calculated the mean difference, the method error (the SD of the difference divided by the square root 
of 2), and the ICC3,1 with 95% CIs between test sessions 1 and 2.7 
Statistical Models and Calculations 
We generated 5 separate logistic regression models, 1 for each proposed risk factor. New ACL injury 
was the outcome, with the leg as the unit of analysis. Each of the 5 risk factor variables was based on 
the mean of 3 jump trials. All models included the same set of adjustment factors to compensate for 
factors that could influence injury risk: (1) sport, (2) dominant leg, (3) height, (4) body mass, and (5) 
previous ACL injury. We defined the dominant leg as the preferred leg when kicking a ball. We 
calculated standardized odds ratios (ORs) per 1-SD change with 95% CIs for each risk factor and 
adjustment factor. 
 6 
 
 
We calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to investigate the sensitivity and 
specificity characteristics of a test based on the medial displacement variable.35 The test outcome is 
defined as excellent (0.90-1), good (0.80-0.89), fair (0.70-0.79), poor (0.60-0.69), and fail (0.50-
0.59). 
Relative risk (95% CI) for reinjuries was calculated as the rate of new injuries in previously 
injured divided by the rate of new injuries in noninjured players. Similarly, we calculated the relative 
risk of injuries in soccer players compared with handball players as the rate of new injuries among 
soccer players divided by the rate of new injuries among handball players. 
We plotted the frequency diagram for the medial knee displacement variable in injured and 
uninjured knees dividing measurements into 0.5-cm intervals. 
We compared relevant variables between players with and without new ACL injuries during 
the study period using the Student t test. STATA for Windows (v 12; STATA Corp) was used to run 
the statistical analyses and interpreted P < .05 as statistically significant. Data are presented as means 
with ±SDs or 95% CIs unless otherwise noted. 
RESULTS 
Player and Injury Characteristics 
We tested 782 players in the VDJ test from August 2007 through February 2014. We chose not to 
process recordings that were suboptimal owing to missing markers or poor capture quality. 
Additionally, technical errors with the force plate recordings occurred in 1 test session, and data were 
lost in another session. One player withdrew from the testing because of an ankle sprain. This left us 
with 710 players eligible for analysis: 338 (48%) soccer and 372 (52%) handball players. 
We recorded 53 new ACL injuries during the study period: 27 among soccer and 26 among 
handball players. Two players were injured twice during the observation period; their first injury was 
used as the index injury in the analyses. Seven players sustaining a contact injury and 2 with 
incomplete test data were excluded before the statistical analyses. This left 42 noncontact injuries 
available for analysis (Table 1): 24 from soccer and 18 from handball. In 1 case, technical problems 
with the force plate recording prevented us from calculating kinetics. ACL injury occurred 1.5 ± 1.3 
years after the baseline test. The nondominant leg was injured in 26 cases (62%).

aData are reported as mean ± SD. P values are shown for univariate comparisons between players 
with and without a new noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. For players with new 
injuries, peak knee flexion, peak vertical ground-reaction force (vGRF), knee valgus at initial 
contact, peak knee abduction moment, and medial knee displacement are reported for the injured leg 
only. In the groups with no new injuries, the data represent the mean of the left and right legs, as 
there were no significant side-to-side differences. INJ, injury. 
bP < .05 (Student t test). 
Of the 710 players, 67 (9.4%) reported a history of ACL injury before testing. Of these, 12 
(17.9%) suffered a new injury: 4 an ipsilateral reinjury and 8 an injury to the contralateral, healthy 
knee. The relative risk of a new ACL injury among the previously injured versus those with no 
previous injury was 3.8 (95% CI, 2.1-7.1). 
The relative risk of ACL injury in soccer players versus handball players was 1.5 (95% CI, 
0.8-2.7). 
Univariate Risk Analysis 
Table 1 depicts the characteristics of players classified according to their past and current history of 
ACL injury. Among players with no previous ACL injury, those who sustained an ACL injury were 
1.1 years younger than uninjured players. Also, we observed greater medial knee displacement 
among those with new injury among all 710 subjects (mean, 0.5 cm; 95% CI, 0.07-0.93) and in the 
group of 67 previously injured players (mean, 1.0 cm; 95% CI, 0.01-2.10), while there was no 
difference in medial knee displacement among the 643 players with no history of previous injury. 
Among the 42 injured players, we detected no side-to-side differences between the injured 
and uninjured legs in any of the 5 variables. 
Multivariate Risk Analysis 
The standardized ORs, corresponding to the increased risk associated with a 1-SD change in the 
variable, for each of the 5 separate logistic regression analyses are listed in Table 2. Medial knee 
displacement was the only factor associated with increased risk for injury (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-
 8 
 
 
1.74). In a similar analysis including only players without a history of previous ACL injury (n = 643 
players, n = 30 new injuries), the OR decreased to 1.25 (95% CI, 0.97-1.61).

VDJ Screening Test Characteristics for the Medial Knee Displacement 
Variable 
As shown in Figure 3, there was substantial overlap in the frequency distribution of medial knee 
displacement between injured and noninjured players. An ROC curve analysis showed an area under 
the curve of 0.6, indicating a poor-to-failed combined sensitivity and specificity of the test.

There were no systematic changes in medial knee displacement and only small systematic changes in 
the remaining measurements taken 1 to 4 years apart (Table 3). For knee valgus at initial contact, 
peak knee flexion and peak vGRF, consistency was good (ICC range = 0.60-0.66), whereas 
consistency for medial knee displacement was fair (ICC = 0.54). Consistency for peak knee 
abduction moment was poor (ICC = 0.25).

DISCUSSION 
Of the 5 factors suggested as predictors for ACL injury (knee valgus angle, knee abduction moment, 
vGRF, knee flexion angle, and medial knee displacement), only 1 factor was statistically associated 
with elevated ACL injury risk. Greater medial knee displacement during the contact phase increased 
injury risk by approximately 40% for a 1-SD (1.2 cm) increase in medial knee motion. The elevated 
risk associated with greater medial knee displacement in previously injured players supports studies 
suggesting that frontal plane kinematics is an important component in ACL injury 
causation23,25,60.23,26,61 However, it should be noted that the difference between cases and controls 
was small (mean, 0.5 cm). Therefore, it is not surprising that the ROC curve analysis revealed an 
area under the curve of only 0.6, documenting that the VDJ test cannot be used as a screening test to 
predict ACL injury. 
The present study represents a major undertaking with >700 elite female handball and soccer 
players tested with 3-dimensional motion analysis over a 7-year period. These are high-risk 
populations, with 53 new ACL injuries registered among the 782 players tested during the study 
period. The statistical analyses were predefined with predictor variables carefully chosen per the 
literature. This rigorous statistical approach, in contrast to exploratory data mining, minimizes the 
chance for obtaining spurious statistical relationships.24,65 
In contrast to the study of Hewett et al,23 knee abduction moments and valgus angles at initial 
contact could not identify players with increased risk of future ACL injury. Although we investigated 
 10 
 
 
only a limited number of potential risk factors, the measured variables are considered to be those 
most likely to play a role in ACL injury causation, based on the current literature. Although other 
biomechanical variables, such as knee internal rotation and anterior tibial translation, may be 
important, these variables are possible to measure only with high-end methods, such as fluoroscopy, 
and cannot currently be implemented in a mass screening of athletes. 
We observed a 3.8-times-higher injury rate among players with previous injury, which is 
lower than what has been reported in other studies18,48-50.18,49-51 The higher injury rate may be related 
to the increased medial knee displacement observed among injured athletes with a history of 
previous injury (Table 1) but also a host of other factors1,56.1,57 In contrast to Hewett et al,23 we did 
not detect side-to-side differences in any of the 5 candidate variables among the group of injured 
players. However, players with a history of previous injury clearly represent a high-risk group. More 
advanced testing with VDJ or other tasks are not needed to identify these. Such players should be 
targeted with preventive exercise programs on the basis of their injury history alone. 
It is worth noting that not only the outcomes but also the subject characteristics are 
substantially different among the cohorts of the 3 risk factor studies available. Our group of well-
trained adult (21 years on average) elite players is likely to have a better physique and skill level, as 
well as higher exposure to injury prevention training, compared with the high school cohort (16 
years) of Hewett et al23 and mixed high school–college cohort (18 years) of Smith et al.57 It is 
possible that a VDJ test can identify high-risk players in groups of younger, less trained athletes, but 
this needs to be documented in large prospective cohort studies. 
Substantial reductions in ACL injury rates have been observed in numerous intervention 
studies21,39,63,21,40,64 even national injury prevention programs43.44 Therefore, it is surprising that what 
appears to be key elements in the programs, such as “knee over toe” alignment and “soft landings,” 
were not found to be associated with increased injury risk in the current study, except among those 
with a history of previous injury. One could speculate that the efforts made to reduce the ACL injury 
incidence in Norwegian handball for more than a decade have improved landing and cutting 
technique among all players,7 thereby reducing inherent variability. Still, 39% of the players were 
evaluated as having poor landing technique in VDJs.8 Furthermore, there were no differences in 
medial knee displacement between the handball and soccer cohorts, indicating that injury prevention 
training does not seem to have influenced landing technique substantially. Another possible reason 
may be that a VDJ task is not sufficiently challenging for unveiling poor frontal plane knee control, 
as suggested by Smith and coauthors.57 A previous study reported 5-times-higher peak knee 
abduction moments in a handball-specific side-step cutting maneuver compared with VDJ28.27 
Moreover, there was no correlation between the 2 measures, indicating that a drop jump cannot 
simulate the loading patterns of motions where ACL injuries are known to occur25,31,47.26,31,48 
Consequently, it may be necessary to develop screening tests where the frontal plane loads are higher 
and movements more comparable with what is seen in injury situations, including 1-leg out-of-
balance landings or cutting maneuvers. Also, an overhead target could alter the player jump 
performance and biomechanics.20 We did not include an overhead target in the test, since we wanted 
to make the test as simple as possible. 
Limitations 
We used a logistic regression analysis rather than a Cox regression to investigate risk factors. We 
chose the logistic regression approach since the percentage of players with new injury included in the 
cohort was as low as 7.4%. The difference between a logistic regression and a survival analysis is 
insignificant when the proportion of injured players is <10%.2 
 11 
 
 
Although this is the largest study to date, 42 injured players still represent a limited sample. 
Moreover, with this sample size, including 5 risk factors and 5 covariates in the model results in 
limited statistical power. Still, according to Bahr and Holme4,4 this sample size is sufficient to detect 
moderate to strong associations. As can be seen from the 95% CIs, it is clear that none of the factors 
examined have strong associations with injury risk. In other words, increasing sample size would 
provide more precise ORs, yet they would still be clinically insignificant. 
We ran 5 separate logistic regression analyses to investigate the effect of each of the 5 
preselected variables in isolation (while adjusted for possible confounders). However, we also 
inputted all 5 primary variables, as well as the adjustment factors, into 1 combined model. In the 
new, combined model, results were almost identical. For instance, the medial knee motion 
standardized OR changed from 1.40 to 1.47. 
We used the leg as the unit of analysis, through clustered regression models, ignoring the fact 
that repeated within-person observations were likely dependent. Such dependencies were, however, 
present only in the control group and therefore did not likely influence outcome. 
Another potential limitation of such a long-term study is that the candidate risk factors may 
have changed during the course of the study (eg, through training or maturation), invalidating our 
baseline risk factor estimates. From questionnaire data, 38% of the players (in both soccer and 
handball) reported to have implemented preventive training as part of their routine during the season. 
However, we cannot be sure what or how much was done. Such training may have influenced jump-
landing execution and thereby led to misclassification of players. In the current study, the time from 
test to injury was on average 1.5 years. In our long-term test-retest study (average, 2.1 years), there 
were only small systematic changes in risk factors. The method errors can be considered small, but 
the method error for knee flexion (8.1°) (see Table 3) indicated that the movement patterns have 
changed. Measurements of knee flexion angles through marker-based motion analysis systems are 
known to be reliable and accurate6,52,53,61,6,53,54,62 indicating that the observed variation is a result of 
VDJ technique changes. Mok et al (unpublished) also found similar results in a short-term test-retest 
study on the same cohort. However, if we take into consideration the relative large number of injured 
cases, the error in the calculated ORs is likely minimal. 
We wanted to make the VDJ test as simple as possible to optimize its clinical applicability. In 
contrast, other protocols have standardized foot distance and jump length. In a study comparing VDJ 
with a minimal forward displacement and a drop jump with a forward displacement corresponding to 
50% of the body height, a higher tibial shear force and knee abduction moment was found but with 
no differences in knee valgus or knee flexion.11 In this study, the forward displacement of the center 
of mass was relatively consistent among the players and corresponded to approximately 30% of their 
body height (0.48 ± 0.13 m). The results of our protocol are therefore expected to be comparable 
with most other protocols, at least for knee valgus and knee flexion angles. A narrow stance may 
limit the range of medial knee displacement attributed to physical contact between the knees. 
However, this situation was observed in only 1.2% of the subjects, as evaluated by the distance 
between knee centers. 
Another limitation is related to the fact that we relied on player interviews to classify injuries 
as contact or noncontact. Recall bias and the ability to interpret what happened in an injury situation 
may be problematic.30 For this reason, we performed additional regression analyses where we 
included all injuries (also contact injuries), for both the primary analysis including all players and a 
secondary analysis where players with a history of previous injury were removed. However, the 
outcome remained the same, documenting that potential misclassification of the mechanism of injury 
does not change the results of this study.

CONCLUSION 
In players with no previous injury, none of the VDJ variables were associated with increased injury 
risk. Therefore, the VDJ cannot be used as a screening test to predict ACL injuries in female elite 
soccer and handball players. Of the 5 risk factors considered, medial knee displacement was the only 
factor associated with increased risk for ACL injury. However, ROC analysis indicated a poor 
combined sensitivity and specificity when medial knee displacement was used as a screening test for 
predicting ACL injury.
