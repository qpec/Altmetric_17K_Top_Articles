 The Association Between Race/Ethnicity
and the Effectiveness of Direct Antiviral
Agents for Hepatitis C Virus Infection
Feng Su,1 Pamela K. Green,2 Kristin Berry,2 and George N. Ioannou1,2
Black race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) to interferon-
based treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus infection, whereas Asian race was associated with higher SVR rates com-
pared to white patients. We aimed to describe the association between race/ethnicity and effectiveness of new direct-acting
antiviral regimens in the Veterans Affairs health care system nationally. We identified 21,095 hepatitis C virus–infected
patients (11,029 [52%] white, 6,171 [29%] black, 1,187 [6%] Hispanic, 348 [2%] Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/
Alaska Native, and 2,360 [11%] declined/missing race or ethnicity) who initiated antiviral treatment with regimens con-
taining sofosbuvir, simeprevir 1 sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir/dasabuvir during the
18-month period from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015. Overall SVR rates were 89.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]
89.2-90.4) in white, 89.8% (95% CI 89.0-90.6) in black, 86.0% (95% CI 83.7-88.0) in Hispanic, and 90.7% (95% CI
87.0-93.5) in Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native patients. However, after adjustment for baseline char-
acteristics, black (adjusted odds ratio 5 0.77, P < 0.001) and Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio 5 0.76, P 5 0.007) patients
were less likely to achieve SVR than white patients, a difference that was not explained by early treatment discontinua-
tions. Among genotype 1–infected patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir monotherapy, black patients had significantly
lower SVR than white patients when treated for 8 weeks but not when treated for 12 weeks. Conclusion: Direct-acting
antivirals produce high SVR rates in white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native
patients; but after adjusting for baseline characteristics, black race and Hispanic ethnicity remain independent predictors of
treatment failure. Short 8-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir monotherapy regimens should perhaps be avoided in black patients
with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;65:426-438).
N
ew direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs)
have substantially changed the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) treatment landscape. Clinical
trials report rates of sustained virologic response (SVR)
in excess of 90% for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF),
paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (PrOD),
and simeprevir plus SOF (SMV1SOF) regimens.(1-11)
Given their high efficacy, short treatment duration, and
improved side effect profile, DAAs have the potential
to narrow the SVR gap between patient groups who
have historically responded poorly to treatment and
those who have better response.
Different racial and ethnic groups in the United
States are known to have different responses to tradi-
tional, interferon-based HCV regimens. Interferon-
based regimens, including those using the protease

 inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir, resulted in much
lower rates of SVR among black(12-16) and Hispan-
ic(17-19) patients compared to non-Hispanic white
patients. Asian ethnicity, on the other hand, has gener-
ally been associated with higher SVRs compared to
other races and ethnicities.(18)
It is not yet clear whether the effectiveness of DAAs
varies between racial and ethnic groups in the United
States. A recent analysis of pooled data from the ION-
1, ION-2, and ION-3 clinical trials, which evaluated
the efficacy of LDV/SOF with or without ribavirin
(RIBA) for treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection,
found that black patients had similar rates of SVR12
(95%) compared to nonblack patients (97%).(20) How-
ever, these data are limited by inclusion of only a small
number of black patients (n 5 308) and furthermore
do not capture real-world outcomes. Disparities in
difficult-to-treat populations are often accentuated in
real-world practice compared to clinical trials.(21,22)
In this study we aimed to compare the real-world
effectiveness of SOF, SMV1SOF, LDV/SOF, and
PrOD-based regimens among different racial and eth-
nic groups treated in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health
care system nationally. The VA provides an optimal
setting to study race/ethnicity-related disparities in
DAA effectiveness due to the high prevalence of HCV
among veterans, the large population of racial and eth-
nic minorities, the nationwide distribution of the VA
system, and the lack of confounding factors related to
health insurance coverage.
Patients and Methods
DATA SOURCE: THE VA
CORPORATE DATA WAREHOUSE
We extracted data from the VA Corporate Data
Warehouse, a national repository of data obtained
from the VA electronic medical records.(23) Data
extracted included all pharmacy prescriptions, demo-
graphics, inpatient and outpatient visits, problem lists,
procedures, vital signs, diagnostic tests, and laboratory
tests. Data were extended back to October 1, 1999, to
determine whether patients had received prior HCV
treatments, and extended forward to April 15, 2016, to
allow for completion of treatments and ascertainment
of SVR.
STUDY POPULATION AND
ANTIVIRAL REGIMENS
Out of 24,089 HCV antiviral regimens initiated in
the VA nationally from January 1, 2014 (the month
after SOF was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration), to June 30, 2015, and completed
before October 1, 2015, we excluded 2,585 regimens
that were no longer used or recommended by the time
we analyzed our data (e.g., SOF 1 pegylated interfer-
on [PEG]/RIBA and SOF1RIBA for genotype 1–
infected patients and all PEG/RIBA regimens). We
additionally excluded 409 “duplicate” regimens, in
which the same patient appeared to have received one
very short “regimen” (e.g., 14-day regimen) followed at
a later date by a longer course of the same regimen
(these short, “duplicate” regimens were most likely
erroneous or postponed prescriptions), leaving 21,095
patients in the current analysis, all of whom were
treated
with
the
direct
antiviral
agents
SOF,
SMV1SOF, LDV/SOF, or PrOD.
BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS
We ascertained race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander/
American Indian/Alaska Native [Asian/PI/AI/AN]),
age, gender, HCV genotype, baseline HCV viral load,
and all of the baseline laboratory tests shown in Table
1 using the value of the test closest to the date treat-
ment was initiated within the preceding 6 months.

 medications), and liver transplantation status (996.82,
V42.7) were also determined. Patients with cirrhosis or
HCC
who
underwent
liver
transplantation
were
excluded from the cirrhosis and HCC categories.
Additionally, the following comorbidities were ascer-
tained using the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, codes noted in parentheses: depres-
sion
(311.0-311.9),
posttraumatic
stress
disorder
(309.81), anxiety or panic (300.0-300.9), schizophre-
nia (295.0-295.9), alcohol use disorders (defined by
“alcohol abuse” 305.00-305.03, “dependence” 303.90-
303.93, or “withdrawal” 291.81), and substance use
disorders (defined by “substance abuse” 305.2-305.9,
“dependence”
304.0-304.9,
or
“drug
withdrawal”
292.0). The International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, codes used to ascertain cirrhosis,
HCC(25-30) and other comorbidities(27,31-35) have been
widely used and validated in national VA data. These
conditions were noted only if recorded at least twice
prior to treatment initiation.
SUSTAINED VIROLOGIC
RESPONSE
SVR was defined by a viral load below the limit of
quantification performed >12 weeks after the end of
treatment.(36) If no viral load test was available >12
weeks after the end of treatment, then SVR was
defined by a viral load performed 4-12 weeks after the
end of treatment, which accounted for an additional
1,126 SVR determinations. This was justified because
SVR ascertained based on viral load 4 weeks after the
end of treatment was shown to have 98% concordance
(positive predictive value 98%, negative predictive value
100%) with SVR ascertained based on viral load >12
weeks after the end of treatment in SOF-treated
patients.(36) Duration of therapy and end of treatment
were defined by the total duration of DAA prescrip-
tions filled.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
SVR rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were determined by race/ethnicity group and by sub-
groups defined by genotype, treatment regimen, prior
treatment, cirrhosis, and other clinically relevant char-
acteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to
determine whether race/ethnicity was a predictor of
SVR after adjusting for the following baseline charac-
teristics selected a priori because they are known or
suspected to be associated with both race/ethnicity and
SVR: age, genotype/subgenotype, regimen, gender,
HCV viral load, platelet count, serum bilirubin level,
serum albumin level, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, cir-
rhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplan-
tation, and prior treatment. In exploratory models we
additionally adjusted for treatment duration to investi-
gate whether early treatment discontinuation could
account for any differences between racial/ethnic
groups in SVR.
We included interaction terms between race/ethnic-
ity and genotype, cirrhosis, treatment experience, liver
transplantation, or human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) coinfection in the multivariable models to
determine whether the association between race/
ethnicity and SVR was significantly different among
subgroups defined by these characteristics.
In prior VA studies, as well as other real-world stud-
ies, viral load testing necessary to ascertain SVR was
missing in a significant proportion of patients. To esti-
mate the impact that missing SVR data might have,
we used multiple imputation to impute missing SVR
values in secondary analyses. Missing SVR values were
imputed using a logistic regression model that included
the baseline patient characteristics shown in Table 1
(24
characteristics
including
regimen,
genotype,
treatment-experienced or treatment-naive, cirrhosis,
HCC) and importantly included the duration of treat-
ment. The number of imputations was varied from 10
to 200, resulting in estimates that were identical up to
four significant digits. The model was determined to
be stable, and 20 imputations were used. Data were
assumed to be missing at random. This assumption
was found to be reasonable using the observed data.
Analyses were performed using Stata/MP version
14.1 (64-bit) (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

 proportion of black patients had genotype 2 (3.0%) or
genotype 3 (0.7%) HCV compared to other race/
ethnicity groups. A higher proportion of Hispanic
patients had received prior HCV treatment (28.4%)
compared to other groups (23.5% of whites, 23.6% of
blacks, and 21.3% of Asian/PI/AI/AN patients). His-
panics also appeared to have more severe liver disease,
as shown by a substantially higher prevalence of cirrho-
sis (48.7%) and decompensated cirrhosis (17.9%), high
FIB-4 scores (49.5%), and abnormal bilirubin, interna-
tional normalized ratio, and platelet counts. In con-
trast, black patients were least likely to have cirrhosis
(30.7%), decompensated cirrhosis (5.6%), and elevated
FIB-4 scores (33.0%). There was a higher prevalence
of HIV coinfection in black and Hispanic patients
(7.5% and 5.8%, respectively) as well as diabetes
(38.2% and 34.5%, respectively) than in white patients
(1.8% with HIV coinfection and 25.8% with diabetes)
or Asian/PI/AI/AN patients (2.0% with HIV coinfec-
tion and 30.5% with diabetes).
SVR BY RACE/ETHNICITY,
OVERALL AND IN SUBGROUPS
DEFINED BY GENOTYPE AND
TREATMENT REGIMEN
Of the 21,095 patients in this study, SVR data were
available in 19,286 (91.4%). Overall SVR rates were
similar in white (89.8), black (89.8%), and Asian/PI/
AI/AN (90.7%) patients and slightly lower in Hispanic
patients (86.0%) (Table 2 and Fig. 1).
Among genotype 1–infected patients, the lowest
SVR rate was observed in Hispanic (88.0%) followed
by black (90.3%), white (91.9%), and Asian/PI/AI/
AN (92.4%) patients. SMV1SOF regimens with or
without RIBA resulted in lower SVR rates than LDV/
SOF or PrOD-based regimens in all racial/ethnic
groups (Table 2). However, it is important to empha-
size that our analyses were not designed to compare
regimens with respect to SVR (i.e., multivariate or pro-
pensity score adjusted results of the associations
between regimen and SVR are not reported as this was
not the aim of the study).
Among genotype 2–infected patients, who were all
treated with SOF1RIBA, black patients had a lower
SVR (78.9%) than white (86.7%), Hispanic (85.0%),
and Asian/PI/AI/AN (82.8%) patients.
Hispanic patients with genotype 3 disease had a
lower rate of SVR (69.9%) than white (74.3%),
black (74.4%), or Asian/PI/AI/AN (83.3%) patients
(Table 2), although there were far fewer black (n 5 39),
Hispanic (n 5 28), or Asian/PI/AI/AN (n 5 30)
patients with genotype 3 HCV than white patients (n 5
834), resulting in wide confidence intervals for SVRs.

 The 69 white and 43 black patients with genotype 4
who were treated with LDV/SOF or PrOD with or
without RIBA had very similar SVRs of 91.3% (95%
CI 81.6-96.1) and 90.7% (95% CI 76.9-96.6), respec-
tively;
only 7 Hispanic

3 Asian/PI/AI/AN
patients had genotype 4 HCV.
SVR BY RACE/ETHNICITY IN
SUBGROUPS DEFINED BY
CIRRHOSIS, HIV COINFECTION,
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION, OR
PRIOR ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
We investigated whether differences in SVR by
racial/ethnic group were accentuated in certain patient
subgroups that were traditionally considered “difficult
to treat” (Table 2 and Fig. 1). In all races/ethnicities,
those without cirrhosis had higher SVRs than those
with cirrhosis, who in turn had higher SVRs than
those with decompensated cirrhosis. Hispanic patients
had similar SVR as other race/ethnicity groups among
those without cirrhosis (89.7%, 95% CI 86.8-92.0) but
lower SVR than other groups among those with cir-
rhosis (82.0%, 95% CI 78.4-85.2) and substantially
lower SVRs among those with decompensated cirrho-
sis (72.5%, 95% CI 64.9-79.1) (Table 2).
Among those with HIV coinfection, black patients
had slightly lower SVR (90.3%, 95% CI 87.1-92.7)
than white (93.9%, 95% CI 89.2-96.6) or Hispanic
(93.5%, 95% CI 83.6-97.6) patients, but all groups
attained remarkable SVR rates of >90% (Table 2).
Among those who had received a liver transplant, His-
panic (86.0%, 95% CI 71.5-93.8) and black (89.1%,
95% CI 80.8-94.1) patients had lower SVRs compared
to white patients (93.9%, 95% CI 93.0-97.3) (there
were only 10 Asian/PI/AI/AN patients with prior liver
transplant, all of whom achieved SVR).
Among
both
treatment-naive
and
treatment-
experienced patients, Hispanic patients had lower SVR
than other racial/ethnic groups.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RACE/
ETHNICITY AND SVR IN
MULTIVARIABLE MODELS
After adjustment for baseline characteristics in mul-
tivariable logistic regression models, black (adjusted
odds ratio [AOR] 5 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.87) and
Hispanic (AOR 5 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.93) patients
had significantly lower likelihood of SVR compared to
white patients (Table 3). Although the unadjusted odds
ratio for SVR comparing black to white patients was
essentially equal to 1 and nonsignificant (1.01, P 5
0.9), important negative predictors of SVR, such as cir-
rhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and, most important-
ly, HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection, were less common
in black patients than in other racial groups. Therefore,
adjusting for these characteristics reduced the AOR for
black race. When additionally adjusting for duration of
antiviral treatment, the AOR for black race was atten-
uated only very slightly to 0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.91)
and the AOR for Hispanic ethnicity to 0.82 (95% CI
0.66-0.99), suggesting that differences in early discon-
tinuation of treatment did not account for the associa-
tion between race/ethnicity and lower SVR.
Among the patient subgroups shown in Table 3,
black race was also significantly associated with lower
likelihood of SVR in patients with genotype 1 or 2
HCV infection, while Hispanic ethnicity was signifi-
cantly associated with lower likelihood of SVR in
patients with genotype 1 HCV and those with prior
treatment in multivariable models. Among HIV coin-
fected patients, blacks were less likely to achieve SVR
than whites (AOR 5 0.55), but this did not reach sta-
tistical significance (P 5 0.3) in this relatively small
subgroup. Overall, there was no subgroup in which the
association between race/ethnicity and SVR was espe-
cially striking and formal tests of interaction were not
significant for the interaction between race/ethnicity
and genotype, cirrhosis, treatment experience, liver
transplantation, or HIV coinfection.
EARLY TREATMENT
DISCONTINUATION BY
RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUPS
Among all patients who initiated treatment (n 5
21,095),
early
discontinuation
of
treatment
in
<8 weeks was slightly more common in black (7.3%),
Hispanic
(7.9%),
and
Asian/PI/AI/AN
(7.2%)
patients than in white patients (5.8%) (Supporting
Table S1). Mean duration of treatment was 88 days in
white, 83 days in black, 89 days in Hispanic, and 87
days in Asian/PI/AI/AN patients. Among patients
with available SVR data (n 5 19,286), whose SVR
results are shown in Tables 2 and 3, early treatment
discontinuation in <8 weeks occurred in 4.3% of
white, 5.4% of black, 6.3% of Hispanic, and 5.3% of
Asian/PI/AI/AN patients.

 LDV/SOF TREATMENT FOR
8 WEEKS IN GENOTYPE 1
PATIENTS AND ASSOCIATION
WITH SVR
Food and Drug Administration guidelines and the
LDV/SOF package insert suggest that 8 weeks of LDV/
SOF monotherapy may be considered among genotype
1–infected patients who are treatment-naive, do not have
cirrhosis, and do have a viral load <6 million IU/mL(37);
however, this regimen is based on a post hoc analysis of
the ION-3 study,(3) and it is unclear if it is widely used.
Among 8,140 patients treated with LDV/SOF mono-
therapy, a similar proportion of white (28.7%), black
(26.3%), and Asian/PI/AI/AN (27.6%) patients received
8 weeks of therapy compared to 20.3% of Hispanic
patients. SVR rates were very similar in white, Hispanic,
and Asian/PI/AI/AN patients who received 8 and 12

who received 8 weeks (92.0%, 95% CI 89.7-93.8) versus
12 weeks (95.2%, 95% CI 93.9-96.2) (Table 4). Also,
when limiting to treatment-naive patients without cir-
rhosis with a viral load <6 million who received 8 weeks
of LDV/SOF, SVR rates were lower in black (93.1%)
than in white (96.4%) or Hispanic (96.4%) patients. In
multivariate analysis, black race was associated with lower
likelihood of SVR among patients who received 8 weeks
of therapy (AOR 5 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.88) but not
among patients who receive 12 weeks of therapy (AOR
5 0.89, 95% CI 0.63-1.27) (Table 5).
IMPACT OF MISSING SVR DATA
AND IMPUTATION FOR MISSING
SVR
SVR data were missing in 8.6% (1809/21,095) of
patients who received antiviral treatment, a proportion
that was higher in black (9.0%) and Hispanic (14.7%)
than in white (7.7%) or Asian/PI/AI/AN (6.9%)
patients. It is possible that patients lacking data on
SVR may be more likely to have been lost to follow-up
or to discontinue therapy early or to have other predic-
tors of poor response, which would mean that the
observed SVR rates we report in Table 2 and Fig. 1 are
overestimates. However, patients with versus without
SVR data had very similar characteristics with respect
to
race/ethnicity,
age,
HCV
genotype,
cirrhosis,
decompensated cirrhosis, and most other baseline
characteristics (Supporting Table S2). Patients with
missing SVR did indeed have a higher rate of early
treatment discontinuation <8 weeks compared to
those with available SVR data (24.8% versus 4.4%);
however, the majority completed their treatment, with
mean duration of treatment for those without SVR
data of 72.5 6 38 days and for those with SVR data of
87.6 6 32 days. Thus, the majority of patients without
SVR data were not patients who dropped out of treat-
ment but rather patients who simply had not yet had
their follow-up HCV viral load performed in the rela-
tively short follow-up period of our study.

 When multiple imputation was used to derive miss-
ing SVR values using baseline characteristics as well as
duration of treatment, the results that included imput-
ed and observed SVR were only slightly lower than
those with observed SVR (Table 6), again suggesting
that it is unlikely that our results of observed SVR are
biased substantially toward overestimation due to the
missing SVR data.
Discussion
LDV/SOF, PrOD, SMV1SOF, and SOF-based
antiviral regimens resulted in high SVR rates in all
racial/ethnic groups among 21,095 veterans with HCV
treated in the VA national health care system in 2014
and 2015. However, after adjustment for baseline char-
acteristics, black (AOR 5 0.77, P < 0.001) and His-
panic (AOR 5 0.76, P 5 0.007) patients were less
likely to achieve SVR than white patients, a difference
that was not explained by early treatment discontinua-
tions. Among genotype 1–infected patients treated
with LDV/SOF monotherapy, black patients had sig-
nificantly lower SVR than white patients when treated
for 8 weeks but not when treated for 12 weeks.
Our results represent a dramatic deviation from
the interferon-based antiviral treatments, which con-
sistently reported much larger gaps in SVR between
white patients and black or Hispanic patients, in
both clinical trials and real-world studies.(21) The
narrowing of the SVR gap between black and white
patients may be related to the fact that the efficacy of
DAA-based regimens does not appear to be depen-
dent on interleukin-28B gene (IL28B) polymor-
phisms,
which
strongly
influence
response
to
interferon. Disparities between black and white
patients in treatment responses were in part related
to the lower prevalence of the CC allele of the IL28B
gene in black patients, which is associated with
higher rates of SVR in response to interferon-based
regimens.(38) In clinical trials of DAA regimens,
however, SVR rates are very similar between IL28B
CC and non-CC patients.(1,3-8,39-41)
Racial/ethnic “minority” groups, such as blacks and
Hispanics, are underrepresented in antiviral treatment
clinical trials, despite the fact that black patients and
some Hispanic groups, such as Puerto Ricans, are
overrepresented among HCV-infected patients. Thus,
it is frequently unclear whether the results of clinical
trials that are based mostly on white patients will apply
to racial/ethnic “minority” groups in real-world clinical
practice. Our results offer some reassurance that black
and Hispanic patients achieve SVR rates comparable
to those of white patients in real-world clinical prac-
tice, although small gaps still exist.
Some differences in baseline characteristics by
racial/ethnic group are important to highlight and
inform the interpretation of differences in SVR rates.
First, the prevalence of genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection
was dramatically lower in black patients (3.0% and
0.7%, respectively) than other racial/ethnic groups.
These differences in genotype distribution by race have
been reported.(12-16) Genotypes 2 and 3 were regarded
as “favorable” in the interferon era but are now associ-
ated with the lowest SVR rates in response to DAA
therapy. It is therefore critical to stratify or adjust for
genotype when comparing different racial groups. Sec-
ond, the prevalence of cirrhosis was lower in black
patients (30.7%) and higher in Hispanic patients
(48.7%) compared to white (35.2%) or Asian/PI/AI/
AN (35.1%) patients (Table 1). The differences in
prevalence of cirrhosis by race/ethnicity are consistent
with previous reports(42,43) and were mirrored in the
proportions with elevated FIB-4 scores, elevated serum
bilirubin levels, or reduced platelet count (Table 1). It
has been speculated that the higher prevalence in His-
panics and the lower prevalence in blacks of fatty liver
disease, visceral obesity, and insulin resistance contrib-
ute to the corresponding risk of cirrhosis among
HCV-infected patients.(42,43) Cirrhosis is associated
with lower SVR rates and therefore has to be adjusted
for when investigating the associations between race/
ethnicity and SVR. Indeed, adjustment for genotype
and cirrhosis is responsible for “reversing” the unad-
justed odds ratio in black patients from a value slightly
greater than 1 (i.e., more likely to respond) to an AOR
<1 (i.e., less likely to respond) (Table 3).
We explored whether the disparity between white,
black, and Hispanic patients could be related to differ-
ent rates of early treatment discontinuation. With
interferon-based regimens, rates of early discontinua-
tion were very high but similar between black and
white patients(16,33) and therefore did not contribute to
the racial gap in SVR. Rates of early discontinuation of
DAA regimens in our study are much lower than what
has been observed with interferon. Although early dis-
continuation was slightly more common in black and
Hispanic patients compared to white patients, when
we adjusted for duration of antiviral treatment (which
accurately captures early discontinuations), there was
minimal impact on the AORs for the association
between race/ethnicity and SVR. Thus, differences in

435
 early discontinuation of treatment do not account for
the association between race/ethnicity and SVR that
we identified in multivariable analyses.
In the ION-4 clinical trial of HIV/HCV coinfected
patients treated with 12 weeks of LDV/SOF mono-
therapy, SVR rates were significantly lower in black
(90%, 95% CI 83-95) than in white (99%, 95% CI 97-
100) patients.(9) We also found a difference in SVR
between black (90.3%, 95% CI 87.1-92.7) and white
(93.9%, 95% CI 89.2-96.6) patients, but it was smaller
and did not reach statistical significance in either crude
or adjusted analyses. Limiting to genotype 1–infected
patients who received LDV/SOF monotherapy, as in
the ION-4 trial, black patients again had a lower SVR
(92.0%, 95% CI 88.3-94.7) than white patients
(95.1%, 95% CI 87.3-98.1), which was nonsignificant.
It is recommended that a short, 8-week LDV/SOF
monotherapy regimen “can be considered,”(44) “with
caution and at the discretion of the practitioner,”(37) in
treatment-naive, genotype 1–infected patients without
cirrhosis with an HCV viral load <6 million. Indeed,
these 8-week regimens were commonly used in the
VA and resulted in high overall SVR rates.(45) Howev-
er, our results as well as other recent VA studies,(46)
show that black patients had significantly lower SVR
than white patients when treated with 8 weeks but not
when treated with 12 weeks of LDV/SOF. Further-
more, recent pooled analyses of data from the ION-1,
ION-2, and ION-3 clinical trials, which evaluated the
efficacy of LDV/SOF with or without RIBA for treat-
ment of genotype 1 HCV infection, reported that
among patients treated with LDV/SOF monotherapy
for 8 weeks, the relapse rate was higher (7/81 or 8.6%)
and the SVR rate lower (91.3%) in black patients than
nonblack patients (relapse rate 13/348 [3.7%] and
SVR rate 96.2%).(20,47) Collectively, these results sug-
gest that the 8-week regimens should perhaps be
avoided in black patients and are in agreement with
the most recent combined guidelines of the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the
Infectious Diseases Society of America,(44) which sug-
gest that “shortening treatment to less than 12 weeks is
not recommended for HIV-infected patients, African-
American patients, or those with known IL28 poly-
morphism CT or TT.”
In multivariate models, patients in the Asian/PI/AI/
AN race/ethnicity group did not have a statistically sig-
nificant difference in likelihood of SVR compared to
white patients (Table 3). Unadjusted SVR rates in
Asian/PI/AI/AN patients were also similar to other
groups (Table 2). This is a slight departure from trends
seen with interferon-based treatments, which typically
produced significantly higher rates of SVR in Asian
patients
than
in
white,
black,
and
Hispanic
patients.(18,48) Asian patients have a higher frequency of
the favorable CC IL28B allele,(38) partly accounting for
better response to interferon-based treatments. The
elimination of the SVR gap between Asian patients and
white patients may be due to the lack of impact of the
IL28B genotype on response to DAA-based regimens.
An important limitation of our study is that a signif-
icant proportion (12%) of patients had a missing or
declined race/ethnicity designation. This could poten-
tially have biased our results if one race/ethnicity group
was more likely than others to have a missing race des-
ignation, leading to a high proportion of missing
results for that particular group. However, the baseline
characteristics and SVR rates of patients with missing
race/ethnicity data did not mirror any one particular
race group and instead were generally an average of all
the race groups. It is therefore unlikely that the missing
data biased our results in any particular direction.
Also, our study is limited by missing SVR data in
8.6% of patients, which may lead to overestimated
SVR rates among those with available SVR data, if
those with missing SVR data are significantly less like-
ly to have achieved SVR. We think this is unlikely for
two reasons. First, patients with missing SVR data
were very similar to those with available SVR data in
baseline characteristics that predict SVR (Supporting
Table S2). Although early discontinuation of treat-
ment in <8 weeks was more common in patients with
missing SVR data (24.8% versus 4.4%), the majority of
patients with missing SVR completed 8 or more weeks
of treatment, demonstrating that patients with missing
SVR data were not patients who “dropped out” of
treatment or were “lost to follow-up” but rather
patients (or physicians) who were simply delinquent in
getting their SVR viral load measured after the end of
their treatment—not an uncommon phenomenon out-
side of clinical trials. Second, we used comprehensive
multiple imputation models that included duration of
treatment in addition to baseline, pretreatment charac-
teristics to impute the missing SVR data and found
only an insubstantial reduction in SVR after imputa-
tion (Table 4), suggesting that it is unlikely that our
results of observed SVR are biased toward overestima-
tion due to the missing SVR data.
Our results demonstrate that DAA-based regimens
are highly effective for treatment of chronic HCV
among all race and ethnicity groups in real-world prac-
tice. Although black race and Hispanic ethnicity are

 still associated with lower likelihood of SVR in multi-
variate analysis, DAAs hold promise in closing the
SVR gap between different race/ethnicity groups.
Future studies of HCV treatment regimens should
ensure adequate inclusion of racial/ethnic minorities in
study populations to better detect differences in clinical
subgroups.
