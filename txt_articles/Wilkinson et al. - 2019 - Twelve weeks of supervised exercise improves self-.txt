ABSTRACT
Background. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients experience a high symptom burden including fatigue, sleep
difficulties, muscle weakness and pain. These symptoms reduce levels of physical function (PF) and activity, and
contribute to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Despite the gathering evidence of positive physiological changes
following exercise in CKD, there is limited evidence on its effect on self-reported symptom burden, fatigue, HRQoL and
physical activity.
Methods. Thirty-six patients [mean 6 SD 61.6 6 11.8 years, 22 (61%) females, estimated glomerular filtration rate:
25.5 6 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m2] not requiring renal replacement therapy underwent 12 weeks (3 times/week) of supervised
aerobic exercise (AE), or a combination (CE) of AE plus resistance training. Outcomes included self-reported symptom
burden, fatigue, HRQoL and physical activity.
Results. Exercise reduced the total number of symptoms reported by 17% and had favourable effects on fatigue in both
groups. AE reduced the frequency of ‘itching’, ‘impotence’ and ‘shortness of breath’ symptoms, and the intrusiveness for
symptoms of ‘sleep disturbance’, ‘loss of muscular strength/power’, ‘muscle spasm/stiffness’ and ‘restless legs’. The
addition of resistance exercise in the CE group saw a reduction in ‘loss of muscular strength/power’. No changes were seen
in subjective PF or physical activity levels. AE increased self-efficacy for physical activity.

 Conclusions. Supervised exercise had favourable effects on symptom frequency and intrusiveness, including substantial
improvements in fatigue. Although the intervention did not improve self-reported physical activity levels, AE increased
patients’ self-efficacy for physical activity. These favourable changes in self-reported outcomes support the important role
of exercise in CKD.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a high
symptom burden [1]. The most commonly reported symptoms
in non-dialysis-dependent (NDD)-CKD patients include fa-
tigue, sleep difficulties, muscle weakness, restless legs, pruri-
tus (i.e. itching) and bone/joint pain [1–8]. Our group found
that 96% of patients not requiring dialysis reported experienc-
ing at least one symptom [2], and the median number of symp-
toms experienced in those with CKD Stages 3–5 is between five
and seven [2, 3, 7]. This elevated incidence of debilitating
symptoms
accentuates
the
reduced
health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) in this group [7–9], and high symptom
burden is associated with increased hospitalization and mor-
tality [10].
CKD patients have poor physical functioning [11, 12] and low
habitual physical activity levels [13]. Both low physical activity
[11] and poor physical function (PF) [12, 14] are independently
associated with adverse outcomes and contribute to the reduc-
tion in activities of daily living and quality of life (QoL) in this
group. Increased symptom burden [8, 15] may further reduce
physical functioning, negatively impacting physical activity lev-
els
and
intensifying
the
cycle
of
poor
health
[8,
9,
11].
Accordingly, efforts to alleviate symptom burden in CKD are
likely to confer positive benefits on HRQoL and PF. While phar-
macological intervention may help relieve some symptoms and
consequently arrest HRQoL decline [6, 8], further interventions
are necessary to restore and maximize it. The benefits of exer-
cise
in
CKD
are
becoming
increasingly
established
with
improvements in exercise capacity, PF, strength and clinical
outcomes observed [16–19].
Despite the evidence in regard to physiological changes fol-
lowing exercise in CKD, given the significance of self-reported
HRQoL and symptom burden, there is a paucity of research on
the effects of exercise on these outcomes [20]. We investigated
the effects of 12 weeks of supervised exercise on self-reported
symptom burden, fatigue, HRQoL and physical activity in CKD
patients not requiring dialysis. We hypothesized that exercise
would have favourable effects on symptom experience, fatigue,
HRQoL and physical activity (as a result of improved symptoms
and physiological factors).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
This was a secondary analysis of data from the ‘ExTra CKD’
study [17] (ISRCTN 36489137) conducted at the University
Hospitals of Leicester National Health Service (NHS) Trust be-
tween December 2013 and October 2016. Patients gave written
informed consent and National Ethical approval was obtained.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Eligible participants were: (i) diagnosed with moder-
ately severe CKD (Stages 3b–5); (ii) aged �18 years; and (iii) free
of
physical
impairment
and
comorbidities
that
were
a
contraindication to exercise [e.g. unstable hypertension, poten-
tially lethal arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (gly-
cated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >9%)].
Exercise intervention
Full study methodology is described elsewhere [17]. In sum-
mary, patients attended the research gym three times a week
for 12 weeks. Patients were randomized [stratified for estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] into one of the two supervised
exercise groups:
• aerobic exercise (AE): �70–80% of maximum heart rate, 30
min duration on each session, performed on standard car-
diovascular equipment (e.g. treadmill);
• a combination (CE) of AE (as above but for 20 min duration
on two sessions, 30 min AE only for the remaining session),
plus resistance training (�70% one repetition maximum,
three sets of 8–12 repetitions) on a leg extension and leg
press machine, on two sessions where 20 min AE was
completed.
Outcome measures
To negotiate the absence of a control group, prior to randomiza-
tion, patients underwent a 6-week control period. All self-
reported outcomes reported below were completed by patients
in their own time prior to attendance at baseline or post-
intervention
physiological
assessments.
Questionnaires
returned were screened for missing data and highlighted to the
patient in person. Patients were reminded to return question-
naires if they had not done so already.
Symptom burden
Leicester
Uraemic
Symptom
Scale.
The
11-item
Leicester
Uraemic Symptom Scale (LUSS) [21, 22] evaluated the number,
frequency (0 ¼ ‘never’ to 4 ¼ ‘every day’) and intrusiveness
(symptom impact) (0 ¼ ‘not at all intrusive’ to 4 ¼ ‘extremely in-
trusive’) of uraemic symptoms. Each individual symptom was
scored out of four, and summative scores were generated:
• Total symptom number (LUSS-1): total number of symptoms
experienced (out of 11).
• Total symptom frequency score (LUSS-2): frequency of each
11 symptoms rated 0–4 (out of 44).
• Total symptom intrusiveness score (LUSS-3): perceived in-
trusiveness of each 11 symptoms rated 0–4 (out of 44).
The LUSS has been widely used to determine symptom bur-
den in renal populations [7, 12, 19, 21] and has recently been val-
idated by our group [22].
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue
Scale. The validated Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) assessed fatigue and its impact
on daily activities. It uses a 5-point Likert scale (0 ¼ ‘not at all’ to

 4 ¼ ‘very much’) based on a 7-day recall period. Different fatigue
domains were measured (e.g. ‘physical’, ‘social/family’, ‘func-
tional’ well-being, plus ‘additional concerns’). These were com-
bined to form summative scores:
• FACT-G: sum of subscale scores (out of 108);
• Trial Outcome Index (TOI): sum of the ‘physical’ and ‘func-
tional’ well-being and ‘additional concerns’ subscales. The
TOI is regarded as an efficient index of physical/functional
outcomes and used as a common endpoint in clinical trials
(out of 108);
• total FACIT-F score: sum of all domains (out of 160).
In all scales, a higher score denoted lower fatigue. Subscale
scores were deemed acceptable when �50% of items were
answered and summative scores when response rate was
�80% [23].
Quality of life and PF
EuroQol Five Dimensions (five-level scale). The EuroQol Five
Dimensions (five-level scale) (EQ-5D-5L) is a well-established
generic instrument for assessing HRQoL [24]. Patients classified
their state of health by selecting one of the five different levels
(1 ¼ ‘none’, 2 ¼ ‘slight’; 3 ¼ ‘moderate’; 4 ¼ ‘severe’; and 5 ¼ ‘un-
able’) of problem severity within each health domain (mobility,
capacity for self-care, conduct of usual activities, pain/discom-
fort, anxiety/depression). Scores were converted into a single in-
dex value (scored þ1.0 to �0.594, where a higher score denoted
better QoL). The EQ-5D-5L included a visual analogue scale
(VAS) indicating current health status on a scale between 0
(worst) and 100 (best).
Medical outcomes 36-Item Short Form Survey. The 36-Item
Short Form Survey (SF-36) is a measure of functioning and well-
being [25] that is validated among the general population and
numerous disease populations including kidney disease [5, 26,
27]. The SF-36 measures eight dimensions: PF, role limitations
caused by physical problems (RP), pain (BP), general health (GH),
vitality/energy (VT), social function (SF), mental health (MH)/
emotional well-being and role limitations caused by emotional
problems/MH (RE). For each parameter, scores were trans-
formed from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better
health. Summary physical and mental component scores were
calculated [27]. The modified SF-36 (v 1.0) was used. Norm refer-
ence
population
(aged
60–64
years)
scores
are:
PF ¼ 69.6;
RP ¼ 70.1; BP ¼ 62.3; GH ¼ 60.9; VT ¼ 55.6; SF¼ 76.9; RE ¼ 84.9;
MH ¼ 74.1 [28].
Duke Activity Status Index. Validated in patients with CKD [29],
the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) was used to evaluate
functional capacity. The DASI queried patients, ‘yes’ or ‘no’,
whether they could complete a range of physical activities. Each
question or activity was assigned a value based on the esti-
mated peak oxygen uptake [metabolic equivalent (MET)]. ‘Yes’
responses were summed to give a raw DASI score (0–58.2).
Higher scores indicated higher functional capacity.
Physical activity
Godin–Shephard Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire. The
Godin–Shephard Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GSLTEQ)
was used to determine physical activity levels [30]. Activities
were classified into three subgroups [‘strenuous’ (nine METs),
‘moderate’ (five METs), ‘light’ (three METs)]. The frequency and
type of activities or exercises performed weekly were used to
calculate the total score (METs � times/week). A score of �24 U
was regarded as active; 14–23 U regarded as moderately active;
and �13 U regarded as inactive [30].
Self-efficacy for Physical Activity Scale. In order to assess
whether exercise increased patients’ self-efficacy, we used the
Self-efficacy for Physical Activity Scale (SEPA), a five-item scale
with five-point Likert response levels (1 ¼ ‘not at all confident’
to 5 ¼ ‘extremely confident’). A summary score (1–5) was calcu-
lated by averaging responses. Higher scores reflect higher levels
of self-efficacy [31]. The SEPA has shown high construct validity
with numerous measures of physical activity and is used widely
in clinical populations [32].
Statistical analysis
As a secondary per-protocol analysis of Watson et al. [17], no a
priori sample size calculation is provided for the outcomes pre-
sented. Data are presented as mean (6SD). The 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated for changes pre- and post-
exercise. Significance was recognized as <0.05. Within-group
differences
were
assessed
using
paired-samples
t-tests.
Between-group differences were assessed for changes pre- and
post-exercise using linear regression modelling. Age, group, sex,
eGFR and baseline values for that variable were used as
covariants, and the presence of a significant group coefficient
indicted
a
between-group
difference.
The
expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm was used to impute missing ques-
tionnaire data (see Supplementary data, Table S1) and to restore
adequate sample size for each outcome (n ¼ 18 for both groups).
EM is based on two iterating steps (50 iterations were used) that
generate means and variances for missing data based on known
values for that variable. Categorical data used in EM estimates
were age, group, sex and eGFR, with values at pre- and post-
exercise
used
as
quantitative
variables.
Little’s
missing
completely at random (MCAR) test and separate variance t-tests
confirmed the suitability of using EM. Raw data were evaluated
to verify the imputed differences. Statistical guidance was pro-
vided by statisticians from the Leicester Biomedical Research
Centre Clinical Trials Unit, and data were analysed using SPSS
24 software.
Results
Participants
Thirty-six patients completed the intervention (Table 1). For
brevity, recruitment and retention rates to the study are
reported elsewhere [17]. Out of 36 available exercise sessions,
compliance was good and both groups completed 32 sessions
(88%) on average.
Outcome measures
No significant changes were seen in any questionnaire outcome
over the 6-week control period (see Supplementary data,
Table S2).
Symptom burden
Changes in symptom burden (frequency and intrusiveness) fol-
lowing exercise can be found in Tables 2 and 3. In the AE group,
the total number of symptoms were reduced by 1 (95% CI �2 to
0) from 6 (63) to 5 (62) (P ¼ 0.01) (individual changes are shown

 in Figure 1). In regard to individual symptoms, reductions were
seen in the frequency of ‘itching’ (P ¼ 0.01), ‘impotence’ (P ¼ 0.03)
and ‘shortness of breath’ (P ¼ 0.03), as well as a total symptom
frequency score (P ¼ 0.01). Following exercise, the AE group
reported less intrusiveness for symptoms of ‘sleep disturbance’,
‘loss of muscular strength/power’, ‘muscle spasm/stiffness’ and
‘restless legs’ (P’s ¼ 0.01–0.03), and as such, the total symptom
intrusiveness score also reduced (P ¼ 0.01).
In the CE group, a reduction in ‘loss of muscular strength/
power’ (P ¼ 0.01) was observed, as well as reports of less intru-
siveness for ‘loss of muscular strength/power’, ‘shortness of
breath’, ‘muscle spasm/stiffness’ and ‘restless legs’ (Ps < 0.001–
0.05). Total symptom intrusiveness score was reduced (P ¼ 0.01).
Conversely, an increase in the frequency of ‘joint/bone pain’
symptoms was observed (P ¼ 0.05). No significant change in the
number of symptoms was seen [7 (63) to 6 (63), P ¼ 0.1] al-
though the number (–1) was comparable to the AE.
Fatigue changes are reported in Table 4. Exercise had favour-
able effects on the FACT-G (AE: P ¼ 0.01, CE: P ¼ 0.05), TOI
(P ¼ 0.01 in both groups) and total FACIT-F scores (P ¼ 0.01 in
both groups). No significant between-group differences were
seen.
HRQoL and PF
No changes were seen in the EQ-5D-5L index in either group
[AE: 0.84 (60.18) to 0.85 (60.16), P ¼ 0.7; CE: 0.87 (60.12) to 0.87
(60.15), P ¼ 0.9; between-group difference P ¼ 0.8]. An increase in
the EQ-5D-5L VAS was seen in the AE group [70.2 (617.2) to 75.2
(614.9), P ¼ 0.04] although no change was observed in the CE
group [67.2 (615.3) to 69.6 (617.0), P ¼ 0.40; between-group dif-
ference P ¼ 0.34].
Changes in the SF-36 are shown in Table 5. Although no sig-
nificant
changes
were
observed,
improvements
in
‘Role
Physical’ score [þ12.4 (–1.8 to 26.6)] in the CE group, and the
‘Vitality’ score [þ6.9 (–5.1 to 18.8)] in the AE group exceeded the
minimal clinical important difference (MCID) (þ5 points) [33].
No changes were seen in the DASI [AE: 40.8 (613.8) to 39.9
(617.5), P ¼ 0.72; CE: 40.5 (610.4) to 40.6 (613.8), P ¼ 0.9; between-
group difference P ¼ 0.9].
Physical activity
Self-reported GSLTEQ physical activity scores were not changed
[AE: 25.6 (622.0) to 27.7 (619.0), P ¼ 0.45; CE: 26.2 (620.5) to 22.2
(613.3), P ¼ 0.26, although the between-group difference was
significant, P ¼ 0.02]. Self-efficacy increased significantly in the
AE group [2.5 (61.4) to 3.1 (60.9), P ¼ 0.03] although no change
was seen in the CE group [2.6 (60.8) to 2.8 (60.8), P ¼ 0.57; be-
tween-group difference P ¼ 0.17].
Discussion
In CKD patients, 12 weeks of supervised exercise had favourable
effects on symptom frequency and intrusiveness, including
improvements in fatigue-related outcomes. Although exercise
did not improve self-reported physical activity levels, it did in-
crease self-efficacy for physical activity. This secondary analy-
sis supplements the improvements in physical performance
and the strength reported in Watson et al. [17] and supports the
necessary role of exercise in CKD.
Regardless of the exercise modality, we found beneficial
effects on symptom burden with the number of symptoms fall-
ing from 6 to 5; a reduction of 17%. Kosmadakis et al. [19] also
reported a decline in symptom frequency on the LUSS following
6 months walking (30 min, five times a week) in 40 CKD patients.
In the AE group, reductions in the frequency of ‘itching’ (by 35%)
and ‘shortness of breath’ symptoms (by 40%) were observed.
Although these symptoms are frequently reported in CKD [2, 3,
8], there is a scarcity of research into the effect of exercise on
them. Although preliminary data showed a reduction in itching
after intradialytic cycling [34], further investigation is needed to
elucidate
the
potential
mechanisms
behind
this.
Unsurprisingly, given the well-established benefits of exercise
on aerobic capacity [16], we observed a reduction in dyspnoea
(i.e. ‘shortness of breath’). In support of this, our original trial
[17] reported an increase in peak oxygen uptake.
The AE group reported less intrusiveness for ‘sleep distur-
bance’ and a reduced total symptom intrusiveness score.
Difficulties in sleep duration and quality are common in CKD
and can have substantial impact on QoL. While research is lim-
ited in NDD-CKD, positive effects of exercise on sleep quality in
renal transplant recipients [35] and older adults [36] have been
shown. Possible mechanisms are complex and beyond the
scope of this article; however, increased energy consumption,
endorphin secretion and diurnal rhythm have been cited
[35, 36].
The addition of resistance training (CE group) resulted a re-
duction in the number of ‘loss of muscular strength/power’
symptoms
by
41%.
Concurrently,
we
observed
significant
improvements in muscle mass and strength in Watson et al.
[17], and this appears to have resulted in reductions in per-
ceived weakness. This supports our recommendation that resis-
tance
training
should
form
an
integral
part
of
exercise

 guidelines in CKD as skeletal muscle wasting and resultant loss
of muscle function are common [15, 37]. It should be noted that
the CE group reported an increase in the frequency of ‘joint/
bone pain’ symptoms; whether this is a result of performing ad-
ditional resistance-based training is unknown. Resistance train-
ing in CKD should be carefully progressed at a rate concomitant
with patient ability and adequate recovery should be observed.
As the CE group also completed an AE component, they
too reported reductions in ‘shortness of breath’ symptom
intrusiveness.
Both groups reported less intrusiveness for ‘loss of muscular
strength/power’ and ‘muscle spasm/stiffness’ symptoms. This
could be the result of the increased strength and PF observed
[17]. Improvements in perceived muscle stiffness could be a
consequence of general exercise-induced reductions in pain or
inflammation, or improvements in range of motion and/or
muscle architecture. Both groups reported less intrusiveness of
‘restless legs’ symptoms. Common in CKD, particularly in ad-
vanced disease stages, restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensori-
motor disorder characterized by an uncontrolled urge to move
the affected body parts [38]. Interestingly, exercise (both AE and
CE) has been proved effective in improving RLS in both healthy
middle-aged men [39] and in haemodialysis patients [38].
Symptoms are reportedly alleviated, at least temporarily, by
physical activity [39], with a potential effect from endorphin re-
lease [40].
Exercise had large positive effects on fatigue symptoms in
both groups. Symptoms of fatigue are consistently reported in
CKD [1, 2, 8, 41]. With up to 80% of patients suffering from fa-
tigue [4], it is a key barrier to regular participation in physical ac-
tivity/exercise
[8].
Although
research
is
limited
in
renal
populations, exercise is an effective intervention in reducing fa-
tigue, especially in cancer patients [42]. Although the mecha-
nisms
are
likely
to
be
multi-factorial,
it
appears
that
improvements
in
aerobic/exercise/functional
capacity
and
strength, as observed in our trial [17], resulted in reduced effort
and improvement in the perception of fatigue during activities
of daily living [42]. Fatigue in CKD has also been associated with
poor sleep quality, RLS, excessive daytime sleepiness and low
albumin levels [41]. Consequently, our improvements in sleep
disturbance, restless legs, muscle weakness and stiffness, and
shortness of breath symptoms may translate to reduced percep-
tions of fatigue.
Although a small change for the EQ-5D-5L VAS was seen in
AE group, this did not reach the MCID [43], and no changes were
seen in the EQ-5D-5L index in either group. Research by Mustata
et al. [44], albeit in 10 CKD patients, found that AE (combined su-
pervised and home-based) was able to elicit a clinically impor-
tant improvement in the EQ-5D-5L index. However, in this trial,

ber of symptoms for each of the 18 individual patients in each group.

 patients were older with greater disease progression and poorer
exercise capacity; the baseline EQ-5D-5L index in that trial was
0.77
compared
with
0.84–0.87
observed
in
our
patients.
Accordingly, our cohort may denote a relatively ‘healthy’ sam-
ple of patients, and our EQ-5D-5L index is highly comparable to
the normative value of 0.86 for people aged 55–64 years in the
UK [24].
The SF-36 values of our sample also suggest a somewhat
‘healthy’ cohort, and scores for ‘PF’, ‘BP’, ‘VT’, ‘SF’ and ‘MH’
were �11% above the mean scores for a norm reference popu-
lation (60–64 years) [28]. Although no significant changes were
seen as a result of exercise, the ‘RP’ score (þ12.4) in the CE
group, and ‘VT’ score (þ6.9) in the AE group exceeded the
MCID (þ5 points) [33, 45]. Interestingly, Mustata et al. [44] also
reported a clinically important change in the ‘RP’ domain (i.e.
role
limitations
caused
by
physical
problems
[5]).
The
improvements in physical capacity observed in our trial could
reduce limitations of daily activities. The ‘VT’ domain reflects
‘energy level’ and ‘fatigue’ [2, 45]. Therefore, improvements in
other fatigue outcomes (as described above) are also reflected
in increased ‘VT’.
Despite significant changes in objective functional capacity
[17], we observed no changes in the DASI—a subjective measure
of physical functioning. Despite its clinical utility, the DASI may
not be suitable to differentiate individuals with high functional
capacity (as apparent in our trial) due to a ‘ceiling effect’ [46].
This effect exists when �15% of the sample reaches the maxi-
mal score [47]. Indeed, 25% of our total sample reached this
‘ceiling’ post-exercise.
Self-reported physical activity scores from the GSLTEQ
were not changed in both groups. A score of �24 U is regarded
as ‘active’ [30]. As such, the mean baseline scores in patients
recruited (�26 U) indicate a relatively active cohort, and may ex-
plain why physical activity did not increase (i.e. patients rea-
soned themselves as sufficiently active already). Although
physical activity levels did not change, self-efficacy for physical

 activity increased in the AE group. Self-efficacy, or confidence
in one’s ability to perform a given behaviour despite obstacles,
is a task-specific construct that influences the amount of time
and effort individuals are willing to invest in order to overcome
barriers [48]. Engaging in a supervised exercise intervention has
been shown to have favourable effects on self-efficacy [49], in-
cluding following pulmonary rehabilitation [50].
As stated elsewhere [17], the main limitation regards a lack of
a non-exercising control group, which was excluded to promote
recruitment to the study. However, we feel that this is somewhat
negated by a 6-week control period prior to group allocation.
Although we observed no changes in self-reported outcomes dur-
ing this control period, suggesting the changes we observed are
likely to be the result of the exercise intervention, the absence of
a control group does not provide assessment on whether changes
were driven by non-exercise psychosocial context variables
including expectation, conditioning or social interactions. A lack
of a ‘resistance training only’ group also means that we are un-
able to isolate the effects of this modality.
The questionnaire return rate in this study was poor (across
all
questionnaires
�50%
had
completed
pre-
and
post-
intervention data). To that end, we used EM imputation to re-
store sample size and to provide a more accurate interpretation
of any changes. Although the missingness of data was con-
firmed using Little’s MCAR test, we cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that patients with a more positive psychosocial response
may have been more likely to return the questionnaires post-
intervention. We used t-tests to investigate differences in age,
sex, renal function and pre-intervention scores in patients who
had complete and incomplete response rates for outcomes (i.e.
the DASI and ‘number of symptoms’ question from the LUSS)
identified as ‘missing at random’, but no explanatory variables

 could be identified. The number of missing data in our study
highlights the importance by reducing patient outcome mea-
sure burden in study design, especially when the patient com-
pletes these in their own time. Efforts should be made to reduce
the number of self-reported measures, but also ensure efficient
management to achieve maximal return rates. Although getting
patients to complete self-reported measures in the presence of
a researcher may introduce observer bias, it would reduce miss-
ing data and improve response rate considerably. This was a
secondary analysis of Watson et al. [17], which was powered to
elicit
physiological
hypertrophic
muscle
responses.
Consequently, the effects of exercise on self-reported outcomes
reported here should be interpreted cautiously.
In conclusion, 12 weeks of exercise had favourable effects on
symptom frequency and intrusiveness, including improvements in
fatigue in CKD patients. These positive changes in self-reported
outcomes support the important role of exercise in CKD manage-
ment. Further research is needed to elucidate upon the physiologi-
cal and psychological mechanisms of how exercise influences
symptoms and other patient-reported outcomes.
