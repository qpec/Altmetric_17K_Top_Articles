Engagement of the private pharmaceutical
sector for TB control: rhetoric or reality?
Niranjan Konduri*
, Emily Delmotte and Edmund Rutta
Abstract
Background: Private-sector retail drug outlets are often the first point of contact for common health ailments,
including tuberculosis (TB). Systematic reviews on public-private mix (PPM) interventions for TB did not perform
in-depth reviews specifically on engaging retail drug outlets and related stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector.
Our objective was to better understand the extent to which the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
recommendation on engaging retail drug outlets has been translated into programmatic policy, strategy, and
intervention in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods: The study included a content analysis of global-level documents from WHO and the Stop TB Partnership
in five phases. A country-level content analysis from four data sources was performed. Global-level findings were
tabulated based on key messages related to engaging retail drug outlets. Country-level findings were analyzed
based on four factors and tabulated. National strategic plans for TB control from 14 countries with varying TB
burdens and a strong private sector were reviewed.
Results: 33 global-level documents and 77 full-text articles and Union World Lung Health conference abstracts
were included for review. Based on experience of engaging retail drug outlets that has emerged since the mid-
2000s, in 2011 WHO and the International Pharmaceutical Federation released a joint statement on promoting the
engagement of national pharmacy associations in partnership with national TB programs. Only two of 14 countries’
national strategic plans had explicit statements on the need to engage their national pharmacy professional
association. The success rate of referrals from retail drug outlets who visited an approved health facility for TB
screening ranged from 48% in Vietnam to 86% in Myanmar. Coverage of retail drug outlets ranged from less than 5
to 9% of the universe of retail drug outlets.
Conclusions: For WHO’s End TB Strategy to be successful, scaling up retail drug outlets to increase national
coverage, at least in countries with a thriving private sector, will be instrumental in accelerating the early detection
and referral of the 3 million missing TB cases. The proposed PPM pharmacy model is applicable not only for TB
control but also to tackle the antimicrobial resistance crisis in these countries.

Background
There is no shortage of evidence that both regulated and
unregulated
private-sector
retail
drug
outlets,
also
known as pharmacies, chemists, drug shops, drug sellers,
drug vendors, or informal drug sellers, are often the
preferred first point of contact for common health
ailments due to their inexpensive services, ease of access,
and lack of waiting times compared to public health
facilities [1, 2],. There is substantial evidence regarding
the health-seeking behavior of consumers, caregivers,
and patients [3] related to childhood illnesses, malaria
[4], sexually transmitted diseases [5], cough-like symp-
toms [6], prolonged cough [7], and tuberculosis (TB) [8,
9],. Systematic reviews on the role of private-sector retail
drug outlets in the provision of health care [10] and
their quality of services [11] and regulatory aspects [12]
have examined this body of knowledge.
While 43 million lives were saved by TB treatment
and care between 2000 and 2014, TB remains a scourge

 worldwide, and 9.6 million people contracted the dis-
ease in 2014 [13]. To end the TB epidemic by 2035,
the World Health Organization’s (WHO) End TB
Strategy emphasizes tapping the full benefits of health
policies and systems by engaging a much wider set of
collaborators across government, communities, and
the private sector. In 2013, WHO reported that 3
million people fail to get a quality-assured TB diagno-
sis each year and often seek care from multiple
private-sector providers in their search for TB treat-
ment. Private-sector retail drug outlets are a key ally
in ensuring that patients are referred to appropriate
and high-quality treatment providers in their neigh-
borhood. WHO’s first guideline on public-private mix
(PPM) approaches for tuberculosis clearly spells out
the range of interventions specifically needed for non-
physicians, such as private-sector retail drug outlets,
pharmacists, and traditional healers [14]. However,
the extent to which this specific recommendation has
been translated into programmatic policy, strategy,
and intervention in low- and middle-income countries
is unclear.
A WHO review of PPM interventions found that TB
detection increased between 10 and 36% with the suc-
cessful treatment of 90% of new smear-positive pulmon-
ary TB cases [15]. One systematic assessment examined
the concept and practice of PPM and concluded that
national TB programs (NTPs) need guidelines to make
decisions on which type of provider to engage to meet
the Stop TB Partnership’s global objectives [16]. A re-
cent systematic review evaluated the performance of
PPM programs against six health system themes [17].
Given the broader PPM focus, these studies did not per-
form in-depth reviews specifically on engaging private-
sector retail drug outlets in TB control. The latter
represent a particular challenge for PPM interventions
because they exist in large numbers and are often staffed
by low-skilled employees whose clients are looking for a
quick remedy. Meanwhile, the PPM schemes ask the
retail drug outlets to focus on referrals that bring no
inherent benefit to the drug seller and sometimes resist-
ance from the client.
To better understand the evolution of the recommen-
dations concerning the engagement of private-sector
retail drug outlets in TB control, we performed a con-
tent analysis of documentation from global agencies. We
also reviewed and examined whether retail drug outlet
engagement in TB control is merely rhetoric reflected in
global guidelines and practiced in a handful of settings
or reality reflected in country policy and practice. We
examined whether NTPs, at least in countries with a
large private sector, have embraced retail drug outlets
and implemented interventions to engage them as part
of their PPM strategy.
Methods
Global-level content analysis
We conducted the search in five phases. First, we
reviewed all resources, tools, and publications available
on WHO’s PPM web page. We also reviewed relevant
documents from WHO’s Global TB program and Stop
TB Partnership web pages. We performed a content ana-
lysis of all relevant documents for recommendations and
manually scanned all documents to verify statements re-
lated to the purpose of this review. Second, we reviewed
the publicly available WHO and Stop TB Partnership
PPM subgroup meeting notes, or the agendas in the
absence of meeting notes, from 2002 to 2015. We ap-
plied the search terms “pharmacy” and “pharmacist.”
Third, we reviewed WHO’s annual global TB reports
from 2000 to 2015 for the search terms “PPM”, “public-
private partnerships”, “pharmacy”, “pharmacist”, “chem-
ist”, and “private sector.” Fourth, we reviewed annual
reports, strategic plans, and key Stop TB Partnership
documents sourced from WHO’s website from 2003 to
2015. Fifth, we reviewed 15 meeting reports and recom-
mendations from WHO’s Strategic and Technical Ad-
visory Group for Tuberculosis from 2001 to 2015. In all
instances,
we
hand
searched
additional
documents
mentioned or described in these documents and added
them for review as appropriate.
Country-level content analysis
We searched PubMed and Google Scholar using free
words at the time of this review (see Additional file 1 for
search terms). For PubMed, an advanced search was
used to find additional articles with the terms included
in the title or abstract. We hand searched the bibliog-
raphies of relevant articles and contacted study authors
for additional clarification. All articles were screened by
one reviewer (ED) and verified by another (NK). Article
inclusion criteria were those articles related to retail
drug outlets and could be a commentary, an assessment
of the situation, or an intervention. All other articles that
had other PPM components or described such things as
health-seeking behavior or diagnostic delays were ex-
cluded. Because we anticipated that there would be very
few studies or articles that focused on retail drug outlets
and TB control or included them as part of a broader
PPM intervention, we expanded our search through
three sources. First, we searched the abstract books of
the Union World Conference on Lung Health published
by the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease from 2004 to 2014. We searched abstracts for
the following terms: “pharmacy”, “pharmacist”, “chem-
ist”, “shops”, and “seller”. Second, we collected available
national TB strategic plans or action plans specifically
from countries with high TB burden and focused on 14
such countries where the private expenditure for health
Konduri et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice  (2017) 10:6 
Page 2 of 13
 was at least 45% or more of the total health expenditure
and assessed country policy on PPM in relation to pri-
vate pharmacy engagement [18]. Third, we retrieved the
estimated number of licensed and unlicensed retail drug
outlets relative to the country population against the TB
burden for 13 of 14 countries (excluding India) to permit
comparisons. The latter analysis was performed to assess
public health implications of the relative level of scaling
up PPM interventions involving retail drug outlets.
In this review, we consistently use the term “retail
drug outlets” to reflect the various terms used in the
literature, including drug seller, drug shop, medicine
store, private pharmacy, chemist, informal drug seller,
patent drug vendor, patent medicine vendor, and accre-
dited drug dispensing outlet. However, during the multi-
stage search process, we used these varying terms to
identify relevant documents. From a regulatory stand-
point, in the majority of the countries, outlets are gener-
ally classified into two categories. Category I includes
those outlets that are legally allowed to sell only non-
prescription medicine, also known as over-the-counter
drugs, while Category II includes those outlets that
are legally allowed to sell prescription medicines. In
practice, there may often be no distinction in terms
of what is being sold, but many other legal require-
ments are maintained.
Results
Global documentation: WHO and the Stop TB Partnership
A total of 33 global-level documents were reviewed. The
content analysis of 16 key documents from the WHO
and Stop TB Partnership websites is presented in Table 1.
Pharmacists were first included as part of the formal def-
inition of private providers in WHO’s 2001 emerging
policy framework to involve private practitioners [19]. A
summary of the notes and presentations from eight Stop
TB Partnership PPM meetings is shown in Table 2.
Aspects of private pharmacy engagement were addressed
in 2002, 2006, and from 2010 to 2014 in 11 Stop TB
PPM subgroup meetings. The PPM subgroup dedicated
significant time during the 2011 subgroup meeting to
discussing and sharing experiences on anti-TB drugs and
the private sector and engaging pharmacists. This meet-
ing resulted in a concrete recommendation to the
Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS)
Expansion Working Group and the Stop TB Coordinat-
ing Board to disseminate widely the WHO/International
Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) joint statement on
promoting the engagement of pharmacy associations
and drug regulatory bodies in national partnerships to
stop TB.
A summary of related information from WHO’s nine
annual Global TB reports is shown in Table 3. The mo-
mentum on overall PPM approaches gained traction
between 2005 and 2010, and emerging results were
shown in the 2011 and 2012 reports. No annual reports
from the Stop TB Partnership, including those from TB
REACH grants, had any information or statements that
were significantly related to the purpose of this review.
Country-level findings
PubMed identified 32 unique articles for the search
terms that were used, and seven articles that had a retail
drug outlet component were included for review. The
Google Scholar search identified 62 unique articles
related to TB in the private sector, and five relevant arti-
cles were included for review. Among the Union World
Conference on Lung Health abstracts between 2004 and
2014, we found 65 relevant abstracts for review. Includ-
ing the 12 full-text articles sourced from PubMed and
Google Scholar and 65 Union abstracts, a total of 77
relevant articles and abstracts representing 18 countries
were analyzed based on four factors and tabulated
(Additional file 2). Of the 18 represented countries, 11
were in Asia, five in Africa, and two in Latin America.
India (17) had the most articles and abstracts included
in this review, followed by Cambodia (9). Among the 77
articles and abstracts, 52 were interventions involving
retail drug outlets, and 24 were assessments concerning
any aspect of retail drug outlets, such as sales of anti-TB
drugs and knowledge of providers. Only one abstract
described a regulatory component concerning the re-
striction of anti-TB drugs involving key stakeholders,
including the national medicines regulatory authority.
Only 15 of the 52 intervention-related articles and
abstracts reviewed explicitly documented the specific
number or percentage of referrals of presumptive TB
cases from retail drug outlets or resulting smear-positive
TB cases (Table 4). All other articles and abstracts had
grouped numbers or percentages of referrals among all
private providers in their overarching PPM interven-
tions, making it difficult to obtain data on the contribu-
tion of referrals specifically among retail drug outlets.
Between 2003 and 2014, there was no substantial pro-
gression or variation in the number of referrals regard-
less of the country setting. The success rate of referred
patients who visited an approved health facility for TB
screening varied from 48% in Vietnam in 2003 to 86% in
Myanmar in 2014.
Of the 14 selected high-burden TB countries where
the private expenditure for health was at least 45% of
the total health expenditure, the most recent versions of
national strategic plans for TB control were available for
all but two. Of the 14 countries reviewed, the national
strategic plans of 12 formally included retail drug outlet
engagement primarily for referral of persons suspected
of having TB (Table 5). Only Bangladesh and Indonesia
had explicit statements on the need to engage their local

that, over the last two decades, the role of retail drug
outlets has evolved from pilot projects and guidance
in global documents to formal incorporation into

None of the 14 countries’ national strategic plans

retail drug outlets or necessarily prioritize urban or rural
outlets. The public health contribution of retail drug
outlets to TB case finding depends on the number of
retail drug outlets in the country, the population, the
relative TB burden, the percentage of engaged pharma-
cists who refer patients, and the percentage of clients
with symptoms who are successfully counseled for

 referral by the pharmacist. Figure 1 compares 13 of 14
countries of comparable size (excluding India) for the
first three of these factors (see Additional file 3 for data
sources). This figure highlights different situations within
countries. Cambodia, for example has a relatively low inci-
dence of TB cases compared to other countries but very
high per capita TB burden, with one retail drug outlet
serving an average of 2,225 people. Consequently, based
on the 77 articles and abstracts reviewed (Additional file
2), the coverage of retail drug outlets ranged from less
than 5 to 9% of the universe of retail drug outlets in a
given country.
Discussion
The findings from this review demonstrate one aspect of
the evolution of PPM in TB diagnosis, care, and tre-
atment over time. Despite the inclusion of private
pharmacists in the 2001 WHO document, “Involving
private practitioners in tuberculosis control: Issues, inter-
ventions and emerging policy framework,” evidence of
the engagement of this cadre of private-sector health
providers appeared slowly over the following decade. For
example, in 2004, the Union World Conference on Lung
Health contained no abstracts that met the inclusion
criteria for this review; however, by 2014, there were 14
qualifying abstracts. A similar trend was observed in
global guidance documents. The term “private sector”
was mentioned in the first WHO annual TB report in
2000; however, it wasn’t until 2003 that the terms
“public-private mix” and “public-private partnership” first
appeared in WHO’s annual TB report. Notably, 2003 was
also the first year that the annual report included the term

2002 Involvement of pharmacies was listed as an innovative approach.
Incentives for pharmacy involvement in referrals and treatment.
2006 Pilot experience on engaging private pharmacies in Cambodia
and drug vendors in Vietnam was mentioned.
2008 WHO Activities in the Americas Region:
The experience of NTPs in engaging private pharmacies and
traditional medicine is scarce. Mexico has an agreement with
the national pharmacy association. Constraints in the Americas
include limited knowledge of the role and coverage of the
private sector, including private pharmacies.
Donor perspective: USAID supported the following activities
Cambodia: pharmacy staff and traditional healer training and
referral systems.
Ethiopia: training and referral systems for private pharmacies.
2010 Cambodia reported progress on engaging private doctors and
pharmacists: 12,577 suspects were referred, 6,403 were evaluated,
and 1,418 TB cases were identified (2005–2008). An analysis of
patient health-seeking behavior helped to design the intervention.
Ghana reported progress on working with regulatory authorities to
restrict access to anti-TB drugs and to require private pharmacies
to refer all persons suspected of having TB to the NTP.
2011 The terms “pharmacy” and “pharmacist” were mentioned 19 times
in the meeting report and discussed frequently, as reflected in
numerous presentations.
The PPM secretariat was recommended to support the
documentation and dissemination of innovative approaches,
such as engaging pharmacists in TB care and control. NTPs and
Ministries of Health were recommended to work with national
pharmacy associations to tap the role of pharmacists in early
case detection and improving TB treatment and care.
2012 One of the expected outcomes of the subgroup meeting was to
produce practical tools on social franchising for and engaging
pharmacies in TB care.
2013 Reported progress made on designing guidance and tools to
engage private pharmacies.
2014 The meeting provided recommendations to address the
knowledge gap on income sources and amounts for chemists
to inform the types of incentives that might work. PPM programs
must enforce regulation for the rational use of anti-TB drugs and
accreditation systems for collaborating providers.

Private-sector pharmacy aspects
2005 Cambodia: Based on the findings of a 2002 study on the
prevalence of health care-seeking behavior in the private-sector,
Cambodia launched a pilot project to engage private practitioners
and pharmacies.
Kenya: Diagnostic and treatment services projects to engage all
providers, including pharmacies, are ongoing.
2007 Cambodia: Planned activities include mapping the locations of
private pharmacies and recording the training of non-NTP staff.
The Philippines: Achievements include initiating operational
research projects in PPM, including collaboration with pharmacies.
South Africa: Achievements include engaging pharmacists,
private-sector general medical practitioners, traditional health
practitioners, community care givers, and community-based
organizations in the referral and support of TB patients.
2008 Afghanistan: Achievements include conducting a study on the
role of private pharmacies in the treatment of TB in the central
region of Afghanistan. Planned activities include developing
training modules for private practitioners and private pharmacies
to engage all care providers.
Kenya: Achievements include sensitizing pharmacists and
additional private practitioners on TB to encourage the referral
of TB suspects for diagnosis.
2010 Countries have prioritized different types of care providers,
including pharmacies in Cambodia, private hospitals in Nigeria,
public hospitals in China and Indonesia, social security organizations
in Mexico, and prison services in Kazakhstan.
2011 In 20 countries for which data were available, PPM contributed
approximately 20 to 40% of all notifications in 2010 in the
geographical areas in which PPM was implemented (no specific
data for pharmacies).
The role of pharmacists in TB care and control was discussed,
including a box summary outlining the WHO/FIP joint statement.
2012 Intensified efforts by NTPs to engage the full range of care
providers using PPM initiatives are also important; in most of
the 21 countries that provided data, 10 to 40% of national
notifications were from non-NTP care providers (no specific
data for pharmacies).
2013 No specific information pertaining to private-sector pharmacy
engagement.
2014 No specific information pertaining to private-sector pharmacy
engagement.
2015 In India, patients receive e-vouchers for standardized medications
to be redeemed at no charge from private chemists.

 “pharmacies.” The PPM subgroup meetings of the Stop TB
Partnership showed a similar trend. While the first sub-
group meeting took place in 2002, it was not until 2006 that
“pharmacies/pharmacists,” “chemists,” and “seller” were in-
cluded. Since that first inclusion, at least one of these terms
has been in every meeting report or related document.
Need for tailored strategies to increase national coverage
The findings of this review have several implications for
the potential role of retail drug outlets in TB diagnosis,
care, and treatment. The primary finding is that a variety
of articles and abstracts in varying geographic locations
have demonstrated that retail drug outlets are willing
and able to contribute to TB control efforts, as shown
by the number of referrals (Table 4). However, given the
diversity of the private sector in high-TB-burden coun-
tries and the reality that NTP budgets are stretched
across competing priorities, a number of considerations
are warranted as countries decide whether to scale up
the engagement of retail drug outlets nationwide. None
of the 77 reviewed articles and abstracts mentioned
or described attempts to scale up retail drug outlet

 engagement to increase national coverage. Pakistan
had established progressive annual targets not only
for engaging retail drug outlets but also for referrals
and smear-positive TB cases to be detected [20].
For example, even if staff at between 10,000 and
20,000 of the drug outlets in Bangladesh or Nigeria are
trained in rational antimicrobial dispensing and the
referral of persons suspected of having TB, it is unlikely
to have the desired public health effect, given that this
comprises only 5 to 10% of the total universe of outlets.
However, in most of the countries reviewed (appendix 2),
the number of retail drug outlets engaged tend to be
several hundred or over a thousand, which is a more
manageable number to engage for quality improvement
and regulatory efforts. Therefore, in Fig. 1, a large green
circle (large number of outlets) means the retail drug out-
let intervention is somewhat daunting and may need to
rely on changing structures and incentives rather than on
individual engagement, while a large brown circle (large
number of clients per outlet) means that there are some
useful economies of scale in engaging individual outlets.
Figure 1 illustrates the reality not only for TB but also for
the public health implications of irrational dispensing of
antibiotics and the threat of antimicrobial resistance.
Indonesia, which has a very high relative TB burden com-
pared to Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan, has compara-
tively fewer retail drug outlets (30,643) that serve an
average of 8,405 people per outlet, illustrating a different
scenario that requires tailored strategies for maximum im-
pact. India has an estimated 850,000 retail drug outlets.
Through a public-private partnership with various
entities, approximately 9% of the outlets (n = 75,000)
in 12 selected districts across four states of India were
engaged over a four-year period and accounted for
nearly one-third of India’s 1.2 billion people and one-
third of its smear-positive TB cases [21, 22],. This
partnership reported that approximately 10 to 15% of
suspected cases referred by 7,000 pharmacists over two
years were found to be positive and placed on treatment.
Clearly, this example illustrates not only the success of
engaging retail drug outlets but also the need for steady
scale up to increase national coverage. Figure 1 highlights
the numbers problem that is common for PPM interven-
tions in general but most acute for retail drug outlet
interventions [23].
Need for data on costs and number of unique referrals
This review also highlighted current gaps among the 77
articles and abstracts reviewed. For example, while many
of the articles and abstracts described the potential
returns of engaging retail drug outlets, none of the 12
full-text articles described the necessary inputs in terms
of cost. TB programs that may need to prioritize among
various PPM interventions must have an understanding
of the estimated costs and cost effectiveness of each
intervention
[24,
25],.
Such
estimates,
if
modeled
from pilot or small-scale initiatives, would allow TB
programs to use a set amount of funding to deter-
mine which intervention would return the greatest
output in terms of presumptive TB cases referred and

 ultimately confirmed. For example, one program esti-
mated an implementation cost of $176,635 related to
engaging
retail
drug
outlets
in
two
regions
of
Tanzania to inform the NTP on a scale up strategy
[26]. Another factor that may impact the cost effect-
iveness of such an engagement is the extent to which
retail drug outlets serve as the first point of care for
individuals with TB-like symptoms in a given country
[27, 28],. While in some countries these providers are
a first point of contact for communities, in others,
different points of private care may be more common,
such as private clinics or hospitals. For NTPs to bet-
ter prioritize interventions, an estimate of the ex-
pected cost and return is needed. At a minimum,
data on the costs to engage the retail drug outlet and
the resulting additional yield in new cases are needed.
As shown in Table 4, there is a great need for data on the
number of unique referrals (i.e., persons suspected of hav-
ing TB or TB-like symptoms) provided by retail drug out-
lets as opposed to an aggregate number of referrals
provided by all PPM providers. Such data would allow
countries to compare the relative potential and benefit of
engaging various actors within the realm of PPM. Data on
periods of longer than two years on the number of referred
persons who eventually visited an approved diagnostic
clinic and were confirmed as smear-positive TB are also
needed. Further studies are needed to examine the afford-
ability and sustainability of incentive mechanisms, such as
phone credit, compared to moral persuasion [29, 30].
Role of national pharmaceutical associations
Retail drug outlets do not operate in isolation and have
linkages with wholesalers, distributors, and retail associa-
tions. While the majority of the 52 reviewed interventions
primarily trained retail drug outlets to provide referrals,
there are opportunities to engage other stakeholders as
part of a multi-pronged intervention. A country’s national
pharmaceutical association must be engaged to tap into
its network of pharmacy professionals and provide policy
guidance to identify educational, managerial, and regula-
tory approaches to engage retail drug outlets. Cambodia,
India, and the Philippines, for example, have involved
their local pharmacy associations significantly in advocacy
and mobilization among their member networks of retail
drug outlets [21, 31, 32]. In our review of the national
strategic plans of selected countries, only Bangladesh and
Indonesia explicitly made statements of intent to engage
professional pharmacy associations. While Cambodia,
India, and the Philippines have engaged professional phar-
macy and retail drug outlet associations, an explicit state-
ment was not found in any of their updated 2015–2020
national strategic plans. It cannot be assumed that the
engagement of professional associations is automatic be-
cause changes in program leadership and/or fluctuations
in funding levels can influence priorities. Major knowledge
gaps often found among retail drug outlets, such as the
etiology of the disease, awareness of public-sector pro-
grams, and referrals to accredited private clinics, can be
addressed by leveraging partnerships with the national
pharmacy association.
For PPM interventions involving retail drug outlets,
the intervention design needs to consider the different
players and their roles and align incentives for each
stakeholder (Fig. 2). In the short term, the focus may be
to train staff at retail drug outlets to identify common
presenting signs and symptoms of TB and refer patients
to facilities where they can be properly diagnosed and
managed. However, in the long term, more stakeholders
need to be sensitized to exert their role. A country’s
national pharmaceutical association can work with phar-
macy schools to revise their curricula to ensure that phar-
macy
assistants
and
pharmacists
have
the
requisite
knowledge on TB and the rational use of antimicrobials.
Pharmacy schools are a major resource not only for any
baseline assessments and evaluation activities but also for
engaging pharmacy students to collect data, monitor retail
drug outlet performance, recognize real-world challenges
and stimulate thinking on options for policy and practice
[33]. None of the 77 articles and abstracts reviewed ex-
plicitly mentioned engagement with pharmacy schools.
Although there is paucity of such documented experiences,
the Philippines Pharmacy Association produced an instruc-
tors’ manual for revising pharmacy school curricula to
incorporate content on TB control and the role of phar-
macy professionals and retail drug outlets [34]. In addition,
the Indian Pharmaceutical Association involved pharmacy
students to act as TB community educators [35].
Role of national medicines regulatory authority
Among the 77 articles and abstracts reviewed, only one
from Ghana documented a restriction on sales of anti-
TB drugs without a formal legal ban. In countries with a
large presence of local anti-TB drug manufacturers and
where sales of anti-TB drugs are not legally prohibited,
reaching and engaging these manufacturers and their
wholesalers and distributors is a key to success. In
collaboration with the national medicines regulatory
authority, the NTP can work with local TB drug manu-
facturers to engage their sales representatives to promote
the recommended WHO first-line medicines instead of
loose, single TB tablets, to encourage dispensers to screen
and refer those patients who present with persistent cough,
and to not sell antimicrobials or anti-TB drugs until a
proper diagnosis is made. Given the influence that whole-
salers and distributors have on the retail sector, these
actions could have a tremendous effect, particularly in
countries with a large private-sector market [36]. For ex-
ample, in Mumbai, India, certain retail drug outlets were
Konduri et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice  (2017) 10:6 
Page 9 of 13
 accredited and recognized to serve as DOTS providers ra-
ther than perceiving this engagement as a loss of business.
The national medicines regulatory authority must be in-
volved in relevant stakeholders meetings and training ses-
sions involving retail drug outlets and related professional
associations. Presenting a unified approach will ensure that
all key stakeholders share a vision of improved early case
identification and referral, reduced inappropriate antimicro-
bial and TB medicine sales, better contributions to overall
TB notifications, and adherence to regulations and laws. In
countries where an outright regulatory ban on the import
and sale of anti-TB drugs is possible, consistent enforce-
ment is key to preventing a recurrence because of the avail-
ability of anti-TB drugs in retail drug outlets [37]. In other
settings, such as India, which issued a regulation in 2014 to
limit over-the-counter sales of not only anti-TB drugs but
also specific antimicrobials, enforcement is not sufficient,
and incentives among all stakeholders must be aligned [38].
Recent systematic reviews of retail drug outlets and of the
quality of pharmacy services in Asia found limited evidence
of interventions related to regulatory enforcement and
profit motives among private retail drug outlets [39, 40],.
Therefore, it is important to place the PPM pharmacy
model intervention within the larger PPM intervention
package, particularly in countries with a high to moderate
TB burden and a large proportion of the population receiv-
ing private-sector care [41]. It may be appropriate for refer-
rals to be organized within private-sector providers, such as
doctors, general practitioners, chest physicians, specialists,
or clinics/hospitals, which may be where patients prefer to
seek treatment. In most cases, the NTP may already be
working with private-sector providers, such as general prac-
titioners and hospitals.
Given the limited resources and competing priorities
within the NTP, a long-term strategy could be for the
Ministry of Health, particularly in countries with a large
private sector to address other disease programs and
invest in the PPM pharmacy model with links to the
primary care system. Interventions that are comprehen-
sive, such as Tanzania’s accredited drug dispensing outlet
model, could be a good investment in the long run for
TB and other diseases, such as diarrhea and malaria, and
for family planning services [42].
Limitations of this review
This review primarily focused on the role of private-sector
retail drug outlets in TB control. It is possible that we may
have missed some papers that did not use the terms in our
search methodology. For example, community pharmacies
in Bangladesh are called “village doctors” and are sensitized
to refer patients suspected of having TB [43]. Because we
excluded studies that were primarily focused on health-
seeking behaviors of patients, we may have missed content
related to the situation assessment of retail drug outlets
and possible information on referrals. In addition, the rela-
tive scarcity of full-text articles on this topic compared to
conference abstracts may have induced bias in the inter-
pretation of past work involving retail drug outlets and the
Fig. 2 A generic PPM Pharmacy Model [59]

 referral of persons suspected of having TB. The content of
the abstracts varied widely in the extent of information
available, and we did not have access to posters or presenta-
tions that may contain some detail on the content. The pri-
mary authors attempted to contact at least 20 selected
authors of the 65 reviewed abstracts for further clarification
and to seek posters or presentation files but heard back
only from 6 authors. We did not perform any formative re-
view of other Union regional conference materials or of
grey literature from international development partners
working with NTPs. We may have also missed presenta-
tions made at other conferences related to private-sector
health care. Finally, we excluded other studies that may
have documented experiences of retail drug outlets for
other health conditions, such as malaria, family planning
and reproductive health, and HIV. Despite these limita-
tions, our paper has value in blending information from
global and country documentation related to the objectives
of this review.
Conclusion
For the End TB Strategy to be successful, prioritizing and
harnessing the power of private-sector retail drug outlets will
be instrumental in accelerating the early detection and refer-
ral of the 3 million missing cases. The proposed PPM phar-
macy model could become a scalable reality and make a
significant contribution by harnessing both short-term solu-
tions such as systematically engaging retail drug outlet dis-
pensers and long-term solutions like partnerships with
pharmacy schools and pharmacy associations that is long
overdue in many countries. For decades, we have known
about the potential of retail drug outlets but their level of en-
gagement has not been commensurate with the TB burden
and rapid growth of the private health sector. To successfully
scale up PPM pharmacy models and reach ambitious targets,
the international TB community must tailor interventions to
the size and reach of each country’s retail drug outlet net-
work, particularly in settings with a thriving private sector.
In addition, from a public health and pharmaceutical
policy perspective, the crisis of antimicrobial resistance
is unlikely to be adequately addressed through a disease-
specific framework. Country authorities must recognize
the community’s well-documented preference for seek-
ing services from retail drug outlets and make a con-
certed effort to increase coverage of retail drug outlet
engagement across the health system.
