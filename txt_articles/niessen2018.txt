Introduction
The UN and other international agencies advocate 
and seek integral approaches to the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs),1–8 which address existing 
global health inequalities through com 
prehensive, cross-
sector strategies.2,6,9–13 The formal targets set for the SDGs 
cover the economic, educational, environmental, and 
social pillars of sustainable develop 
ment with a strong 
focus on equity across all goals at national and 
international levels.4,6 Five SDGs set explicit targets that 
relate to the reduction of health inequalities both 
nationally and worldwide. These goals are poverty 
reduction, health and wellbeing for all, equitable 
education, gender equality, and reduction of inequalities 
within and between countries. These SDGs cover 78 of 
the 169 targets set,4 indicating a new central role of health 
in development (figure 1). The prioritisation of health in 
the Millennium Development Goals was limited.4,6,14
The reduction of both poverty and health inequalities 
have become leading topics in the promotion of the 
SDGs.2,4,6,12,14 For the first time, through the formulation 
of the SDGs and the 78 cross-sector targets, the UN 
has explicitly recognised the broad socioeconomic 
determinants of health and wellbeing9,15,16 and the strong

Five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set targets that relate to the reduction of health inequalities nationally 
and worldwide. These targets are poverty reduction, health and wellbeing for all, equitable education, gender 
equality, and reduction of inequalities within and between countries. The interaction between inequalities and 
health is complex: better economic and educational outcomes for households enhance health, low socioeconomic 
status leads to chronic ill health, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) reduce income status of households. 
NCDs account for most causes of early death and disability worldwide, so it is alarming that strong scientific 
evidence suggests an increase in the clustering of non-communicable conditions with low socioeconomic status in 
low-income and middle-income countries since 2000, as previously seen in high-income settings. These conditions 
include tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. Strong evidence from 283 studies overwhelmingly 
supports a positive association between low-income, low socioeconomic status, or low educational status and 
NCDs. The associations have been differentiated by sex in only four studies. Health is a key driver in the SDGs, and 
reduction of health inequalities and NCDs should become key in the promotion of the overall SDG agenda. 
A sustained reduction of general inequalities in income status, education, and gender within and between countries 
would enhance worldwide equality in health. To end poverty through elimination of its causes, NCD programmes 
should be included in the development agenda. National programmes should mitigate social and health shocks to 
protect the poor from events that worsen their frail socioeconomic condition and health status. Programmes related 
to universal health coverage of NCDs should specifically target susceptible populations, such as elderly people, who 
are most at risk. Growing inequalities in access to resources for prevention and treatment need to be addressed 
through improved international regulations across jurisdictions that eliminate the legal and practical barriers in the 
implementation of non-communicable disease control.

Key messages
• Health creates wealth, and health is a key contributor in 
achieving other Sustainable Development Goals; 
national and international programmes on sustainable 
development should address non-communicable 
diseases prevention and control
• 
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are neglected 
worldwide and expose people to health, social, and 
economic shocks; international and governmental 
programmes should protect the poor from NCDs and the 
worsening of their socioeconomic status
• 
Programmes related to universal health coverage need to 
address NCDs and should specifically target vulnerable 
populations, including middle-aged and elderly people, 
who are most at risk of NCDs
• 
Health inequalities due to NCDs within countries and 
between countries are increasing; international 
regulations and national jurisdictions should eliminate 
policies and practical barriers in the access to resources 
needed to implement universal health coverage and 
promote health equity

interdependencies between socioeconomic development 
and health.10,13,15–17 Reduction of health inequalities improves 
socioeconomic outcomes for households, and reduction of 
socioeconomic inequalities enhances health at the 
population and household level.4,6,9,12,13,16
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contribute to 
more than two-thirds of deaths worldwide. Four-fifths of 
NCDs occur in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs), and a third of deaths from NCDs affect people 
younger than 60 years.18–21 The potential to exacerbate 
global health inequities is augmenting as the share of 
premature death and disability caused by NCDs 
increases.18,20 The observed inequalities in health status, 
access to care and medicines, and health financing reflect 
the accumulation of unequal lifetime exposures as well 
as unequal access to and quality of health systems 
between populations. This situation exists for antenatal 
care and across the lifespan, and it increases health risks 
associated with socioeconomic status and reduces access 
to timely public health measures, individual prevention, 
and health-care services.22,23 Access to and coverage by 
prevention and treatment programmes to control NCDs 
have become essential in the attainment of universal 
health coverage (UHC) and, as such, are fundamental to 
the imple 
mentation of the SDGs.13,24–27  Here we examine 
the interaction between health,  wellbeing, and the SDGs. 
We position health as a primary driver towards achieving 
the SDGs and identify the four SDGs on poverty 
reduction, equitable education, gender equality, and 
reduction of inequalities within and between countries 
that are key to attaining health and wellbeing for all.
The interaction between socioeconomic status 
and ill health
Populations with low economic status in high-income 
countries are much more likely to have a higher chronic 
disease burden than groups with high economic 
status.17,23,28–30 Studies on the association between 
socioeconomic status and NCDs in low-income and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) are relatively scarce, 
and little systematic evidence exists to support this 
interaction between socioeconomic status and health in 
LMICs. Obesity is becoming increasingly common 
in LMICs and is affecting women and the poor in 
particular.17,31–33 Wagstaff17 describes how people living in 
poverty are restricted in their ability to practise healthy 
behaviours that promote health and are predisposed to 
chronic diseases and late (and hence more advanced) 
diagnosis. The reverse pathway is also plausible, as 
chronic illnesses might lead to poverty because of direct 
and indirect expenditures and loss of productivity.13,27 
Levesque and colleagues34 showed that the poor 
commonly do not have the ability to pay for treatment of 
NCDs. Events related to chronic diseases might cause 
impoverishment through wage loss, missed schooling, or 
catastrophic expenditures for health care.17,32,34 Prolonged 
treatment and continuous use of health services often 
involve costly diagnostic procedures and treatment. 
Continued disability and repeated acute illness related to 
chronic disease during economically productive years 
might hamper household productivity, especially in the 
absence of social safety nets. These mechanisms complete 
a vicious cycle of unhealthy behaviours and exposures in 
low-income populations that increase the risk of NCDs 
and other diseases and, in turn, worsen poverty, 
disparities, and illness.17,24 
In this Taskforce paper, we examine the interactions 
between socio 
economic inequalities and NCDs in

Panel 1: Qualitative evidence on socioeconomic status and non-communicable diseases
Qualitative evidence from studies of cancer or diabetes and associated complications is 
limited. Chronic diseases in general has been investigated in one study only.
A study from Kenya36 used focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to examine the 
financial consequences of acute events and chronic conditions, and financial catastrophic 
expenditure after illness was measured. The financial burden on the poor was found to be 
greater from chronic diseases (as measured by expenditure per household) than from 
acute events. As a result, many poor people forgo treatment.
In a Sri Lankan study,37 care-seeking for patients with diabetes was investigated in 
households at different income levels. Using in-depth interviews, the investigators found 
that the related direct and indirect costs are a high economic burden for households, 
especially in rural areas. Households in this study also reported not being able to pay for 
disease treatment as diabetes-related complications worsened.
Findings from a Chinese study38 about the ability of families to cope with childhood 
cancer showed that most families reported paying for all treatment costs out of pocket, 
and a few families had financial difficulties as a result. Similarly, in an Indian study39 about 
palliative care, families stated that not only were patients obliged to give up work as a 
result of illness, the caregivers also had to change work habits. Some families with a sick 
child had been forced to sell assets, and some children were obliged to miss school.
In a study40 of Pakistani families needing to negotiate therapeutic options in response to a 
cancer diagnosis, wealth was found to be an important determinant of choosing 
therapeutic options. Wealthy people sought health care from allopathic doctors, and poor 
people accessed traditional medicine. Families struggled to pay costs and became 
impoverished.

LMICs, the evolution of these interactions over time, and 
the documented linkages between the SDGs. By 
summarising the characteristics of these interactions 
over time and presenting the strengths of the evidence, 
we contribute to the international and national develop-
ment agenda aimed to build broad health services and a 
public health agenda that promotes health in the 
context of poverty, gender, education, inequalities, 
and wellbeing.4,21
Socioeconomic status and NCDs: the scientific 
evidence
We focus on the scientific studies with strong study 
designs that produce the best available evidence on the 
temporal, probable, causal relationship between socio-
economic status and NCDs. This relationship is impossible 
to study in studies with weak designs, such as cross-
sectional surveys. The varied quality of the 283 studies 
identified in this study necessitates a quality assessment. 
We used the system of quality assessment developed by the 
Grading of Recommendations, Assess 
ment, Development 
and Evaluations (GRADE) working group because it 
distinguishes clearly between the quality of evidence and 
the strength of conclusions and recom 
mendations.35 The 
GRADE system has been widely used and accepted by a 
representative group of methodology developers.35 It also 
gives explicit, comprehensive criteria for down 
grading or 
upgrading quality of evidence relative to other studies. 
This interpretation process leads to a classification of 
strong and weak conclusions to present to a wider audience 
such as policy makers and the general public. We also 
identified four qualitative studies reporting chronic 
conditions relating to cancer and diabetes and poverty 
impact (panel 1).
The quantitative information on the correlation 
between socioeconomic status and NCDs is diffuse, 
changes over time, and provides heterogeneous results 
from weak, cross-sectional studies, whereas the 
high-grade evidence (by GRADE criteria; appendix) 
consistently shows a positive relationship (figure 2; 
figure 3). The study variables and definitions used in 
these studies is highly diverse (panel 2; appendix), which 
made a formal meta-analysis impossible. However, the 
studies could be compared on the basis of the excess 
risks in the lower societal economic status study group.
19 studies, the findings of which were published 
between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017, focused on the 
pathway from chronic disease to poverty.34,36,37,39,42,56–69 
Two of these studies were part of larger cohort studies56,57 
and produced an intermediate level of evidence (D2 and 
D3 level; uncontrolled before-after or time-series studies), 
whereas the other studies were based on weaker cross-
sectional designs (one D4-level study62 and eleven D5-level 
studies34,36,59–63,66–69) or were purely descriptive (four D6-level 
studies37,39,64,65).
The largest body of evidence was from cross-sectional 
studies and suggested an effect of poverty on chronic 
disease occurrence (including risk exposures, occurrence 
of clinical diseases, and complications of disease). 
202 (72%) of 283 studies could be classified as producing 
weak-level evidence. Three studies, one of which was 
a nested case-control study,57 produced high-level (D2) 
evidence, 33 studies produced similar high-level evidence 
(D3; uncontrolled before-after, case-cohort studies, or

time-series study), and 33 studies produced evidence of 
slightly lower quality (D4; case-control studies). The 
remaining six studies produced D6 level of evidence. 
Findings from the D2-level studies showed a mixed or 
unclear association between poverty and chronic disease 
(studies were classified as mixed or unclear when they 
showed associations in different directions between 
different strata [eg, men and women] or among different 
measures of poverty [eg, education and wealth]), whereas 
19 of the 33 D3-level studies showed a positive association, 
and 22 of the 33 D4-level studies showed a positive 
association. Studies with D5-level evidence showed a mix 
of associations (a positive association in 76 of 202 studies). 
Epidemiology of socioeconomic status and 
chronic conditions
We identified a substantial body of evidence in 
283 articles (figure 2; figure 3; figure 4; figure 5; 
appendix). Almost 60% of the studies were from Asia 
(57 studies in India and 66 studies in China), and a 
substantial number of reports were from Brazil 
(figure 5). An increasing trend in publications by 
calendar year (figure 4) was accompanied by a steep 
increase and a more systematic use of poverty measures 
from 2005 to 2017, as summarised in the appendix 
(p 21). Again, the quantitative information on the 
association between poverty and disease was rather 
diffuse, has changed over time, and varied in quality (as 
defined by standard evidence criteria; figure 2; figure 3; 
appendix).70,71 A formal meta-analysis was not possible 
because variables and definitions are considerably 
heterogeneous.35 Many diverse studies on cancer and 
hypertension have been done in Asia, whereas very few 
studies have been done in Latin America. The number 
of studies on diabetes and obesity has increased since 
2000, especially in Asia.
Identified dimensions of socioeconomic status
Wealth indicators (including household and individual 
income, asset-based measures, and consumption 
measures) and educational attainment were used in 
more than half of the published reports and were thus 
the most frequently measured dimensions of poverty 
(panel 2). Household income, usually adjusted for 
household size, has often been assessed through proxy 
measures such as self-reporting on household assets 
or expenditures. Education can be measured and 
analysed by the number of years of schooling and the 
presence or absence of professional, college, or 
technical education. Other common dimensions of 
socioeconomic status were occupation and place of 
residence. Occupation is usually classified on the basis 
of the necessary skills or the hierarchy in society. 
These two dimensions (wealth and education) are 
often used alone or in conjunction with wealth to 
calculate composite indices. Place of residence has 
been used as a proxy for socioeconomic status when 
differences exist, as in rural versus urban living or for 
people living in neighbourhoods with differing levels 
of socioeconomic development.
Composite measures have been used increasingly in 
the past 7 years. Measures such as the Human 
Development Index (HDI)41 and the Kuppuswamy’s 
Socio-Economic Status Scale,72 which are used to identify 
disadvantaged social groups, were found mostly in 
studies after 2005. Ethnicity and social groups have also 
been used to measure poverty levels of the population. 
All studies reviewed assessed the dimensions of 
socioeconomic status through self-reporting.
The qualitative studies are summarised in panel 1. These 
studies covered a limited number of chronic conditions yet 
provide rich descriptions of how families become indebted 
because of an NCD or cope with debt. The coping strategies 
included health-seeking behaviour and maintaining 
livelihoods despite the NCD.
Socioeconomic status and NCDs: strength of 
evidence
Our findings are predominantly based on quantitative 
estimates from 279 of 283 studies, with the qualitative 
studies, as summarised in panel 1. The quantitative 
studies were subjected to an adapted evidence-grading 
Panel 2: Definitions of poverty status, chronic diseases, and association measures
Measures of poverty
Education and income are the two most common dimensions of poverty. These poverty 
measures have all been self-reported, either at the individual or household level. Education is 
usually reported as number of school years completed or as the highest qualification 
attained. The local Human Development Index is reported in a study from Brazil,41 and 
Abegunde and Stanciole42 reported health-care expenditures, non-health-care expenditures, 
labour income, transfers income, and workdays lost by household members in Russia.
Measures of chronic disease
19 studies include cancer (all types) and stroke as diseases and include body-mass index 
(BMI) and hypertension as risk factors. Two studies do not state any specific disease but 
measure presence of disease41 and mortality from disease.43 Two studies on stroke report late 
outcomes after stroke (ie, disability after stroke, according to the modified Rankin Scale44 
and 3 year survival45). Cancer outcomes are mainly reported in terms of fatality.46–49 
Treatment outcomes are investigated in one study,41 disease incidence in a second study,50 
and quality of life 1 year after surgery in a third study.51 Clinical outcomes in all studies are 
based on in-service records. In the three studies on risk factors, BMI, and hypertension, the 
risk factors in their populations were measured directly.52–54 The one study42 on the chronic 
disease to poverty pathway relies on self-reports from people with a chronic condition.
Measures of the poverty–disease association
Odds ratios,44,47 relative risk measures,43,46,54,55 and hazard ratios45 were the most common 
measures. In two cohort studies from Mumbai,48,49 age-standardised relative survival 
(calculated as the ratio of the observed survival to expected survival in a group of people 
in the general population similar to the diseased group with similar age distribution) was 
used to indicate the excess risk of dying from the disease. For studies looking at risk 
factors, prevalence is the measure used as the outcome variable.52,53 In the Brazilian study41 
on outcomes after leukaemia, investigators looked at a variety of measures, including 
complete remission rate, overall survival rate, and leukaemia-free survival rate.

scheme71 from the scientific literature.70 Most of the data 
describes the pathway from socio 
economic status to 
NCDs, whereas 11 studies focus on the pathway from 
chronic disease to poverty. Cross-sectional study 
designs are used in 202 (72%) of the 279 studies. Many 
of the cross-sectional studies are population-based 
surveys using the WHO STEPS method.73–76 Study 
designs have become more sophisticated with time: 
case-control studies, cohort studies, and time-series 
studies make up 25% of the identified studies. Findings 
from early quantitative studies show the mixed 
association between socio 
economic status and NCDs 
(by quality of evidence; figure 2; figure 3). The 
increasing trend in observations of a positive association 
between socioeconomic status and NCDs since 2000 is 
shown in figure 2. The early studies identifying a 
negative association were pub 
lished before 2000, and 
the trend in reporting a negative association has 
decreased in the past decade. The high-level evidence 
(most of which was produced in studies after 2000) 
shows a consistent positive relationship between 
socioeconomic status and NCDs (figure 2).
Population selection bias
The associations between poverty and chronic conditions 
depend on the sampling framework showing possible 
selection bias in the studies. A positive association 
between poverty and chronic conditions or their risk 
factors was found in 73 (38%) of the 194 studies that 
sampled data from a general population. Likewise, a 
positive associ 
ation between poverty and NCDs or their 
risk factors was found in 32 (74%) of the 43 studies 
involving repre 
sentative samples of health-service users 
(appendix).
Strong evidence: clustering of socioeconomic 
status and NCDs
A temporal relationship between chronic disease and 
poverty can be investigated in studies with strong 
designs. Studies with strong designs in this Taskforce 
paper include mainly cohort studies and one nested 
case-control study. Data from one of these studies42 
show a positive association between chronic disease 
and poverty in one study group, whereas of the other 
24 studies41,43–47,50,53,54,56,77–87 examining the pathway from 
poverty to chronic disease, a positive association was 
found in 18 studies, mixed or unclear associations were 
found in seven studies56,41,43–48,53,54,77–80,83–86 (a positive 
association was found in four of these studies), and a 
negative association was found in one study47 (table 1; 
table 2).
To accommodate the heterogeneity in study outcome 
measures and still arrive at a summary outcome, we 
used the excess risk ratio as a general, unadjusted, and 
crude comparative measure for the studies with strong 
evidence (table 2). We defined this ratio as the 
unadjusted ratio between the measure for chronic 
condition and the socioeconomic measure (calculated 
for the lowest and highest socioeconomic status category 
value) for any given health variable. The unadjusted 
crude excess risk ratios are shown by study sample size 
in table 2. Given the limitations of this approach, almost 
all studies show a positive relationship between poverty 
and chronic disease. In the study54 with the largest 
sample size, the excess risk ratio between chronic 
disease mortality and body-mass index (BMI) and 
mortality is relatively small but positive, whereas the 
sample size is much smaller in the study45 with the 
largest excess risk ratio between income and chronic 
disease survival. This indicates the presence of

confounders in this type of analysis. A more formal 
meta-analysis is not possible because of the very 
different measures used, the lack of reported uncertainty 
ranges, and the variety in multiple con 
founders. It is 
striking that the excess risk ratios range from –0·17 for 
a weak association (but including other positive 
outcomes in the same study) to 0·97 (a strong positive 
association). Education measures were included in 
15 studies, and socioeconomic measures were included 
in 15 studies.
In summary, although this excess ratio for socio-
economic status is largely indicative, we found a 
consistent positive relationship between socioeconomic 
status and NCDs that probably varies by orders of 
magnitude because of different confounders in each of 
the individual studies.

Conclusions
A positive relationship between socioeconomic status and 
chronic conditions in LMICs is found in most studies with 
strong design, which confirms that the epidemiology 
of poverty and NCDs in LMICs now converges with 
the abundance of study findings from high-income 
countries.29,30,88,89
In general, up to the year 2000 (but also since 2000), the 
scientific literature on LMICs has provided mixed 
information and reflected changing country conditions 
worldwide. However, there is a general lack of robustness 
in the scientific literature because of weak and often 
inconclusive study findings that are limited by the 
cross-sectional nature of the evidence. Since 2000, study 
quality has been improving, and the number of 
longitudinal designs has been increasing. Studies with a 
strong design include one nested case-control study and 
21 cohort studies. Case-control studies are most feasible in 
resource-constrained settings, and obesity and hyper-
tension seem to be the most obvious and feasible 
conditions to study because they are easy to measure.
With this first comprehensive review, we succeeded in 
identifying studies even without a primary objective related 
to socioeconomic status and NCDs. Some limitations exist 
because we excluded scientific literature that was not 
written in English (we did not expect the findings from 
those studies to influence our conclusions). We included 
many articles from national-level Indian journals that did 
not present high-level evidence on the relationship 
between poverty and chronic disease. We excluded articles 
in Portuguese, Russian, Polish, and Chinese.
Definitions of the terms related to socioeconomic status 
and disease conditions varied widely. Many poverty 
measures are relative concepts, change over time, and 
could address household or individual characteristics. 
Only one study52 addressed socioeconomic status and 
disease conditions at both the community and individual 
levels, and no study addressed social or economic capital 
measures.
We also could not differentiate our findings by population 
strata (eg, by gender or by rural and urban differentials) 
that might modify the relationship between health 
conditions and socioeconomic status. Further limitations 
are small sample sizes and the lack of addressing potential 
collinearity because of education, wealth, and occupation. 
Additionally, access to treatment was not assessed 
although this was an important factor. The excess risk 
ratios in table 2 do not consider heterogeneity. Excess risk 
computations are a crude, descriptive, associative measure 
of an existing relationship between socioeconomic 
status and NCDs that can be used consistently across 
studies. Further explorations of this relationship should

include characteristics of existing health systems to 
understand how health systems can affect disparities 
in NCDs.
Relevance
This systematically collected evidence on the interaction 
between socioeconomic status and NCDs in LMICs could 
stimulate further efforts in setting international and 
national agendas. These joint agendas should contribute 
to changes in health and education pro 
grammes and 
research of social safety nets and pro-poor health-
financing mechanisms.
The increase in number of studies coincided with 
the increase in available resources for development 
and increases in education levels in most countries, 
especially in India, China, and Brazil. Fast economic 
development and rapid urbanisation are occurring in 
Asia, South America, and, to a lesser extent, in Africa. 
China, India, and Brazil share this rapid epidemiological 
transition and the resulting double burden.53,90,91 These 
countries might move further through a health transition, 
accompanied by greater urbanisation and lifestyle 
changes.92 The poor, with shorter life expectancies and 
bearing the brunt of undernutrition, malnutrition, 
childhood diseases, and pregnancy-related conditions, 
are likely to be most affected by NCDs.
Our review of the peer-reviewed scientific literature 
has led to a better understanding of the negative effects 
of socioeconomic status on NCDs in LMICs. Known 
mechanisms and interventional pro 
grammes to inter-
rupt the harmful consequences of socioeconomic status 
are within the domains of poverty alleviation, social 
security systems, general educational programme 
develo 
p 
ment, global public health, health financing, 
health education, and health promotion, but they are 
also within the domains of prevention activities in 
relation to physical activity, food quality and intake, and 
other lifestyle factors. Investigators must differentiate 
between effects on people who are already poor or ill to 
better 
understand 
self-reinforcing 
effects. 
Broad 
intervention studies, including those involving social 
safety nets, health financing, specific health-systems 
innovations, and broad strategies to tackle NCDs, 
should be designed to better address their distributional 
effects in addition to overall average outcomes and 
effects on target populations. This would identify 
further evaluation research and strategies that could 
contribute to more general and international health-
development approaches and to a public health and 
health-services agenda that promotes health and 
wellbeing in the broader context of poverty reduction, 
equitable education, gender equality, and reduction of 
national and international inequalities.21
Towards comprehensive national SDG policies
The collective body of research from longitudinal studies 
of the link between socioeconomic status and NCDs in 
LMICs provides high-grade evidence in support of 
positive associations between low social and economic 
status and NCDs. To end poverty in LMICs through 
elimination of its causes under the SDG agenda,21 NCDs 
programmes should be included in the development 
agenda. International development efforts and national 
governments should mitigate social and health shocks to 
protect the poor from major health-related events 
(diseases, injuries, infections, natural, and externally 
inflicted disasters such as flooding, job loss, and famines), 
worsening their already disadvantaged socioeconomic 
conditions and their susceptible health status. SDG 
programmes related to UHC of NCDs should target 
susceptible populations, which include middle-aged and 
elderly people who are most at risk of NCDs. Further 
effort should be made towards capturing groups that are 
likely to be further disadvantaged, such as women and 
people living in rural areas. The inequalities in access 
to health resources need to be addressed through 
international regulations and through regulations within 
national jurisdictions and health systems. These should 
eliminate the legal and practical barriers in the 
implementation of UHC of NCDs in all countries. The 
sustained reduction of inequalities in poverty, education, 
gender, and health, both within and between countries, 
will promote worldwide equality in health and wellbeing 
and further enhance both socioeconomic and human 
development.
