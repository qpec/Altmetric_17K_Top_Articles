IMPORTANCE Perioperative stroke is a major complication for patients undergoing surgery.
Patent foramen ovale (PFO) represents a possible anatomical link between venous
thrombosis and stroke.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a preoperatively diagnosed PFO is associated with
increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study from Massachusetts
General Hospital and 2 affiliated community hospitals between January 1, 2007, and
December 31, 2015. Participants were 182 393 consecutive adults undergoing noncardiac
surgery with general anesthesia.
EXPOSURES Preoperatively diagnosed PFO.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perioperative ischemic stroke occurring within 30 days of
surgery; stroke subtype by Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification and stroke
severity by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).
RESULTS Among the 150 198 patient cases analyzed (median [SD] age, 55 [16] years), 1540
(1.0%) had a diagnosis of PFO before surgery. A total of 850 (0.6%) ischemic strokes
occurred within 30 days of surgery (49 [3.2%] among patients with PFO and 801 [0.5%]
among patients without PFO). In adjusted analyses, patients with PFO had an increased risk
of ischemic stroke compared with patients without PFO (odds ratio, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.96-3.63];
P < .001). The estimated risks of stroke were 5.9 for every 1000 patients with PFO and 2.2 for
every 1000 patients without PFO (adjusted absolute risk difference, 0.4% [95% CI,
0.2%-0.6%). Patients with PFO also had an increased risk of large vessel territory stroke
(relative risk ratio, 3.14 [95% CI, 2.21-4.48]; P < .001) and a more severe stroke-related
neurologic deficit measured by NIHSS (median, 4 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2-10] vs median,
3 [IQR, 1-6] for those without PFO; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery at 3
hospitals, having a preoperatively diagnosed PFO was significantly associated with increased
risk of perioperative ischemic stroke within 30 days after surgery. Further research is needed
to confirm these findings and to determine whether interventions would decrease this risk.

 T
he annual global surgical volume has been in-
creasing, with an estimated 312 million surgical pro-
cedures taking place worldwide in 2012.1 Periopera-
tive stroke is a major postoperative complication, with
significant implications on postoperative morbidity,
discharge disposition, and 30-day mortality.2 With a
reported incidence rang-
ing from 0.2% to 9.7%
for patients undergoing
different surgeries,3 and
possibly an even higher
incidence of covert strokes,4 the estimated annual global
burden of perioperative stroke could exceed 1 million.
There has been an increasing interest in the association be-
tween a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and stroke. The autopsy
prevalence of PFO in a general population is approximately
27.3%.5 Although the majority of the population with PFO re-
mains undiagnosed, the significance of PFO in causing stroke
in specific cohorts is increasingly clear.6-8 The current knowl-
edge regarding the PFO-stroke relationship has mainly come
from moderately sized case-control studies and meta-
analyses in subgroups of young patients with cryptogenic
stroke,9-12 and the effects of preoperatively diagnosed PFO on
perioperative stroke are unknown.
Duringandaftersurgeryandanesthesia,patientswithPFO
are exposed to various physiological threats that increase the
vulnerability to stroke due to paradoxical embolism, includ-
ing hemodynamic changes that increase right-to-left shunt-
ing and also hypercoagulability and formation of venous
thromboemboli.13 This study tested the hypothesis that a pre-
operatively diagnosed PFO is associated with increased risk of
perioperativeischemicstrokeamongpatientsundergoingnon-
cardiac surgery.
Methods
Study Population and Design
DatafromallpatientswhounderwentsurgerybetweenJanuary
1, 2007, and December 31, 2015, at Massachusetts General
Hospital and 2 affiliated community hospitals (Mass General
West, in Waltham, and Mass General/North Shore Center for
Outpatient Care, in Danvers) were reviewed. The study was ap-
proved by the Partners institutional review board (protocol
number 2017P000260 in Supplement 1), and a waiver of in-
formed consent was granted (for details regarding this regis-
try, see section 2.2 in Supplement 2).
All adult patients (aged≥18 years) who underwent sur-
gery under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation and
were extubated at the end of the procedure were included.
Exclusion criteria were patients with American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification of VI
(patients with brain death),14 and patients undergoing car-
diac or pediatric surgeries.
Definitions of Exposure and Outcomes
The presence of a preoperatively diagnosed PFO was deter-
mined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
RevisionandTenthRevision(ICD-9andICD-10)diagnosticcodes
745.5 and Q21.1 (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Patients without
a billing diagnosis of PFO were considered not exposed. Pa-
tients with a history of PFO closure were classified into the
without PFO group.
The primary outcome was perioperative ischemic stroke
within 30 days of surgery based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnos-
tic codes and confirmed by medical record review.15 Review
ofallpatientswithadiagnosticcodingofischemicstrokewithin
30 days after surgery were conducted by reviewers blinded to
PFO status with a standardized methodology in reviewing pa-
tient notes, neurologist assessments, and findings from radio-
logicalstudiessuchascomputedtomographyormagneticreso-
nance imaging of the brain. Details of the stroke, including the
date and timing, the stroke subtype by Oxford Community
Stroke Project classification,16 and the stroke-related neuro-
logical deficit measured by National Institute of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS)17,18 were obtained retrospectively in the follow-
ing order of priority: as scored by neurologists in neurology
notes, as recorded on reports of radiological studies, and as ab-
stracted from records. When the information was abstracted
from records, the raters were blinded to PFO status. The sec-
ondary outcomes included 30-day hospital readmission, de-
fined as an inpatient readmission to a hospital in the Partners
health care network, and 30-day mortality.
Statistical Analyses
Based on the observation that patients who received a PFO oc-
clusion are 50% less likely to have a recurrent nonfatal ische-
mic stroke than patients in the medical management group,19
we defined prior to conducting the analysis, an odds ratio (OR)
of 2.0 as a clinically meaningful association between PFO and
perioperative ischemic stroke. The sample size had 94.3%
power to detect a difference in risk of stroke between patient
groups, assuming an observed PFO rate of 1.0%, a periopera-
tive ischemic stroke event rate of 0.5%, and a 1-sided α level
of .025.
Allanalyseswereperformedretrospectivelywithprespeci-
fied end points and statistical methods. Unadjusted analyses
were made using χ2 tests for categorical variables and the
Student t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous vari-
ables.Multivariablelogisticregressionwasperformedtoevalu-

Key Points
Question Are patients with a patent foramen ovale at increased
risk of perioperative ischemic stroke?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included 182 393
adults who underwent noncardiac surgery, preoperatively
diagnosed patent foramen ovale (PFO) was significantly
associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke within 30 days
after surgery (3.2% vs 0.5%).
Meaning Preoperatively diagnosed PFO may be associated with
increased risk of perioperative stroke following noncardiac surgery.

high-risksurgicalservice,durationofsurgery,intraoperativehy-
potensive minutes, intraoperative dose of vasopressors, intra-
operativefluidvolumes,requirementforpackedredbloodcells
transfusion, and work relative value units—a marker of proce-
dural complexity, were also adjusted for. The primary regres-
sion model for perioperative ischemic stroke was conducted
using forced variable entry and evaluated to ensure that the es-
timates could be interpreted conventionally. Model discrimi-
nationwasassessedthroughtheconcordanceCstatistic.Model
calibration was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and a
reliability plot, which analyzed the agreement between the ob-
served and estimated outcomes. Model resolution was as-
sessed by plotting a histogram of the log of the estimated val-
ues. All continuous variables in the primary regression model
were tested for linearity; nonlinear variables were categorized
in quintiles.
The association between PFO and ischemic stroke sub-
type, using the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project
classification,16 was analyzed with a multinomial logistic re-
gression model and reported as relative risk ratios (RRs).
Sensitivity Analyses
To address potential biases in the diagnosis of PFO that were
not considered in the multivariable confounder model, a lo-
gistic regression analysis was used to create a propensity score
that estimated the likelihood of diagnosed PFO, based on co-
existing medical conditions that may predispose a referral for
echocardiography studies. Propensity score matching was per-
formed using a 1:5 matching ratio with nearest neighbor and
sampling without replacement with a caliper of 0.20. The as-
sociation of PFO with perioperative ischemic stroke was tested
in the 1:5 propensity score–matched cohort.
To further control for unmeasured differences that biased
thereferralforevaluationbyechocardiogram,theprimaryanaly-
sis was repeated in a subgroup including only patients with a
history of a documented echocardiogram in the same institu-
tion prior to the index surgery. Details were obtained regard-
ingthemodeofechocardiography(transthoracicvstransesoph-
ageal [TEE]), as defined by Current Procedural Terminology
codes,andwhetherinjectionofagitatedsalinecontrastwasper-
formed. Sensitivity analyses were repeated in these subgroups
to examine the effects of residual confounding. Since Current
Procedural Terminology codes cannot be used to identify con-
trast echocardiography studies, they were identified by apply-
ing a text search function to all retrieved echocardiography re-
ports.Thistextsearchmethodwasvalidatedbymedicalrecords
review of 200 randomly selected patients (100 with and 100
without agitated saline testing).
ToexaminewhetherthePFO-attributableriskofstrokedif-
fers for patients at different stroke risks, a probability score for
the baseline risk of perioperative ischemic stroke indepen-
dent of PFO diagnosis was created, based on comorbid condi-
tions and surgical factors that are risk factors for stroke, and
the PFO-stroke association was reexamined for heteroge-
neity across this baseline risk. Effect modification on the as-
sociation between PFO and perioperative ischemic stroke by
patients’baseline stroke risk was tested by introducing an in-
teraction term to the multivariable regression model.
Although the medical records–reviewed outcome of peri-
operativeischemicstrokewasusedintheprimaryanalysis,the
effect estimate when the outcome variable was defined using
the same process of classification as other variables, that is by
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, was tested.
To better ensure that the observed association between
PFO and stroke was not due to some underlying cause unre-
lated to the mechanistic hypothesis, falsification testing was
performedwith3postoperativeoutcomes:septicshock,wound
complication, and peptic ulcer disease. These outcomes were
selected based on a common contributing etiology of non-
thrombotic tissue ischemia but unlikely to be causally re-
lated to the presence or absence of PFO. Further falsification
testing in the complete patient cohort, as well as the cohort
with history of echocardiography, was performed using an ex-
posurevariablethatistheoreticallynotdirectlyassociatedwith
increased stroke risk—tricuspid valve disorders.
The complete case method was adopted to address miss-
ing data in the primary statistical analysis. The analysis was
repeated with the entire cohort using the technique of mul-
tiple imputations by chained equations.
Exploratory Analyses
The relationship between PFO and other perioperative com-
plications of embolic etiology, such as acute limb ischemia and
renal artery embolism, was explored.
Additional analyses have been conducted as described in
Supplement 3. Because there were no adjustments for mul-
tiple comparisons, the prespecified secondary end points
should be interpreted as exploratory. Data management and
statistical analyses were performed using Stata software, ver-
sion 13 and R Studio software, version 3.2.5. A 2-tailed P value
of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

 from the complete case analysis due to missing values in any
of the variables used in the regression model (Figure 1). Table 1
shows the baseline and intraoperative characteristics of the
study population. Of the 150 198 patients who underwent
analysis,1540(1.0%)hadapreoperativelydiagnosedPFObased
on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients with PFO were older; had
a lower body mass index (BMI); higher ASA physical classifi-
cation status; a higher Charlson comorbidity index; were more
likely to have history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dys-
lipidemia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, con-
gestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hyper-
tension, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, atrial
fibrillation, valvular heart disease, COPD, transient ischemic
attack, ischemic stroke, migraine, chronic kidney disease, hy-
percoagulable state, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embo-
lism, and systemic embolic phenomenon; had more prescrip-
tions of β-blockers, statins, antiplatelet agents, and
anticoagulants;underwentmoreemergencyprocedures,high-
risk procedures, inpatient surgeries, and longer surgeries; had
more intraoperative hypotensive minutes; and received higher
intraoperative doses of vasopressors, less intraoperative flu-
ids, and more packed red blood cell transfusions. There was
no significant difference in sex or procedural complexity mea-
sured by work relative value units.
Patients with PFO were more likely to have underlying ma-
jor cardiovascular or thromboembolic conditions at the time
of PFO diagnosis (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Because these co-
existing conditions could have biased such patients to the di-
agnosis of PFO through referral for a dedicated echocardiog-
raphy study, all of these significant conditions were included
in the confounder model for the primary analysis. eTable 3 in
Supplement 2 shows details of the type of surgery for pa-
tients with and without PFO. Patients with PFO underwent
higher frequency counts of anesthesiology and radiology pro-
cedures,neurosurgeries,transplantsurgeries,andvascularsur-
geries compared with patients without PFO.
Evaluation of Primary Regression Model
The assumptions underlying the multivariable logistic re-
gression model and the model fit were evaluated. The area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85
(eFigure 1a in Supplement 2). Assessment of model calibra-
tion(eFigure1binSupplement2)andresolution(insertineFig-
ure 1a in Supplement 2) confirmed that the primary regres-
sion model was well-calibrated and had good resolution.
Primary Outcome
A total of 850 (0.6%) perioperative ischemic strokes occurred
with49(3.2%)amongpatientswithPFOand801(0.5%)among
patientswithoutPFO(absoluteriskdifference[RD],2.6%[95%
CI, 1.8%-3.5%]). In adjusted analysis, patients with PFO had
anincreasedriskofperioperativeischemicstrokeinthe30days
after surgery compared with patients without PFO (OR, 2.66
[95% CI, 1.96-3.63]; P < .001). This translated to an estimated
risk of 5.9 (95% CI, 4.0-7.9) ischemic strokes for every 1000
patients with PFO, an estimated risk of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.9-2.5) for
every 1000 surgical patients without PFO, and an adjusted ad-
justed RD of 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%).
Patients with PFO had an increased risk of large-vessel ter-
ritoryischemia(37[2.4%])comparedwithpatientswithoutPFO
(534 [0.4%]) (relative RR, 3.14 [95% CI, 2.21-4.48]; P < .001).
Further subtyped according to the Oxfordshire Community
Stroke Project classification, the risk of perioperative total an-
teriorstrokewasincreasedamongpatientswithPFO(18[1.2%])
compared with patients without PFO (214 [0.1%]) (relative RR,
3.66 [95% CI, 2.20-6.08]; P < .001), and risk of posterior cir-
culation stroke was increased among patients with PFO
(13 [0.8%]) compared with patients without PFO (193 [0.1%])
(relative RR, 3.14 [95% CI, 1.75-5.63]; P < .001). The risk was
not significantly different for partial anterior stroke (6 [0.4%]
among patients with PFO vs 127 [0.1%] among patients with-
out PFO; relative RR, 2.28 [95% CI, 0.98-5.30]; P = .06), or for
lacunarstroke(0amongpatientswithPFOvs37[<0.1%]among
patientswithoutPFO[relativeRR,0.00];P = .99)(absoluteRDs
and adjusted absolute RDs are presented in Table 2).
Among patients with stroke, those with PFO had more se-
vere stroke-related neurologic deficit measured by NIHSS
(median, 4 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2-10]) than those with-
out PFO (median, 3 [IQR, 1-6]; P = .02). Figure 2 shows the in-
cidence of mild, moderate, and severe strokes (as defined by
NIHSS) in patients with and without PFO.

 Sensitivity Analyses
Of the 1540 patients with PFO, 1521 (98.8%) were success-
fully matched at a 1:5 ratio (Table 3). The propensity score–
matched cohort confirmed the association between PFO and
stroke (49 of 1538 [3.2%] patients with PFO vs 77 of 7656 [1.0%]
patients without PFO; OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.19-4.51]; P < .001;
section 6.4 in Supplement 2).
There were 29 629 (19.7%) patients in the cohort with his-
tory of an echocardiogram performed in the same health care
system (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Subgroup analyses of the
association between PFO and stroke in this cohort confirmed
the study findings (32 of 1162 [2.8%] patients with PFO vs 335
of 28 467 [1.2%] patients without PFO; OR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.28-
2.72]; P = .001; [section 6.5 of Supplement 2]). Analyses fur-
ther stratified by patients with TEE prior to surgery (4094 [904
with PFO {22.1%}]; [section 7.9.1 subsection 1 of Supplement
2]) and patients with contrast echocardiography (echocardi-
ography with agitated saline injection) prior to surgery (4043
[1139 with PFO {28.2%}]; section 7.9.1 subsection 2 of
Supplement 2) reiterated the association between PFO and
stroke (37 of 904 [4.1%] patients with PFO vs 44 of 3190 [1.4%]
patients without PFO; adjusted OR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.15-3.68];
P = .02) in patients with TEE; and (45 of 1139 [4.0%] patients
with PFO vs 67of 2904 [2.3%] patients without PFO; adjusted
OR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.26-2.74]; P = .002 in patients with con-
trast echocardiography; [section 7.9.1 of Supplement 2 for fur-
ther details]).
The area under the curve for the probability score of base-
linePFO-independentriskofperioperativeischemicstrokewas
0.84 (section 6.6 in Supplement 2). The study population was
subdivided by median split into 2 equally sized groups (low
stroke risk and high stroke risk) based on this baseline stroke
risk (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). For individuals at low risk of
stroke, the estimated probability of stroke with PFO was 1.4%
(95%CI,0.2%-2.9%)vs0.1%(95%CI,0.1%-0.2%)withoutPFO;
(adjusted OR, 15.92 [95% CI, 4.92-51.53]; P < .001). For indi-
vidualsathighriskofstroke,theestimatedprobabilityofstroke
withPFOwas0.8%(95%CI,0.5%-1.0%)vs0.3%(95%CI,0.3%-
0.4%) without PFO; (adjusted OR, 3.80 [95% CI, 2.81-5.15];
P < .001). The RR estimate of PFO on perioperative ischemic
stroke was modified by patients’PFO-independent baseline
risk of stroke (interaction term, PFO × low stroke risk; OR, 4.59
[95% CI, 1.36-15.5]; P for interaction = .014). Specifically, the
PFO-attributableriskofstrokeinpatientsatlowbaselinestroke
risk was higher (adjusted absolute RD, 1.3% [95% CI, −0.3% to
2.8%]) compared with patients at high baseline stroke risk (ad-
justed absolute RD, 0.5% [95% CI, 0.2%-0.7%) (section 6.6 in
Supplement 2).
In the primary analysis, the comorbidities in multivari-
able model did not include history of transient ischemic attack
or ischemic stroke since they may have also been associated
with a PFO. As a sensitivity test, including a history of tran-
sient ischemic attack (OR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.70-3.18]; P < .001)
or history of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.13-2.14];
P = .007) in the confounder model did not change the pri-
mary study results.
The incidence of the ICD-based outcome of perioperative
ischemic stroke was 2155 (1.4%) (136 [8.8%] in the PFO group
and 2019 [1.4%] in the group without PFO). In adjusted analy-
sis, the odds of experiencing a stroke in the PFO group was
greater (OR, 2.91 [95% CI, 2.38-3.56]; P < .001) (section 6.1 in
Supplement 2).
Falsification testing showed that the following periopera-
tive outcomes were not significantly associated with having
a diagnosis of PFO: septic shock (15 [1.0%] with PFO vs 525
[0.4%] without PFO; OR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.52-1.52]; P = .67),

The baseline patent foramen ovale (PFO)-independent risk of stroke was
determined by a priori selected–variables (section 6.6 in Supplement 2).
The study population was divided into low stroke risk and high stroke risk based
on this baseline risk (sample size differs because 31 patients with American
Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status class V were excluded due to
failure to calculate the probability score [section 6.6 and eTable 5 in
Supplement 2]). Stroke severity was stratified into minor stroke (National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] scores 1-4), moderate stroke (NIHSS
5-14), and severe stroke (NIHSS 15-42). Patients with PFO had a higher
incidence of stroke across all subgroups. For low-risk patients, the incidences of
minor stroke (1 of 323 [0.31%] vs 24 of 74 761 [0.03%]; P = .006) and moderate
stroke (1 of 323 [0.31%] vs 8 of 74 761 [0.01%]; P < .001) were higher among
patients with PFO; there were no severe strokes. For high-risk patients, the
incidences of minor stroke (16 of 1214 [1.32%] vs 331 of 73 869 [0.45%];
P < .001), moderate stroke (14 of 1214 [1.15%] vs 194 of 73 869 [0.26%];
P < .001), and severe stroke (6 of 1214 [0.49%] vs 49 of 73 869 [0.07%];
P < .001) were higher among patients with PFO.

pid valve disorder [1.2%]; OR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.66-1.19]; P = .43)
(section 7.9.1 subsection 4 in Supplement 2).
A total of 7 variables in the primary regression model had
missing data (section 6.9 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). Body
mass index, the variable which had the largest amount of miss-
ing data, had 10 232 (6.1%) missing values. Multiple imputa-
tionwasconducted,andtheimputedcohortincludedall18 423
(10.9%) patients who were excluded due to missing values in
any of the variables used in the regression model. The model
estimate of PFO on risk of stroke from the imputed data set was
consistent with the complete case cohort (53 of 1788 [3.0%]
with PFO vs 906 of 166 833 [0.5%] without PFO; OR, 2.59 [95%
CI, 1.93-3.48]; P < .001). The details of additional sensitivity
analyses are provided in Supplement 2.
Secondary Outcomes
In multivariable analyses, having a PFO was not significantly
associated with increased rate of 30-day readmission (245
[15.9%] in patients with PFO vs 11 352 [7.6%] in patients with-
out PFO; adjusted OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99-1.33]; P = .07; ad-
justed absolute RD, 0.8% [95% CI, −0.1% to 1.8%]). There was
no significant difference in 30-day mortality between pa-
tients with and without PFO (27 [1.8%] in patients with PFO
vs 917 [0.6%] in patients without PFO; OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.63-
1.43]; P = .80; adjusted absolute RD, 0.01%; 95% CI [−0.05%
to 0.04%]). Detailed results of secondary outcomes are pre-
sented in Table 2.
Exploratory Analyses
The relationship between PFO and other embolic complica-
tions was analyzed. PFO was associated with an increased risk
ofperioperativesystemicemboliccomplicationswithin30days
of surgery (a composite of acute embolic events in the extremi-
ties, kidneys, spleen, splanchnic circulation, and retina within
30 days after surgery) (50 [3.3%] with PFO vs 2127 [1.4%] with-
out PFO; adjusted OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.74-3.08]; P < .001). PFO
was associated with increased risk of acute limb ischemia (14
[0.9%] with PFO vs 555 [0.4%] without PFO; adjusted OR, 2.31
[95% CI, 1.35-3.94]; P = .002), renal artery embolism (4 [0.3%]
with PFO vs 74 [0.1%] without PFO; adjusted OR, 5.15 [95% CI,
1.88-14.13]; P = .001), and acute myocardial infarction (45
[2.9%] with PFO vs 922 [0.6%] without PFO; adjusted OR, 1.60
[95% CI, 1.13-2.27]; P = .008) (Table 2).
Discussion
In this cohort of 150 198 adult patients undergoing noncar-
diac surgery, a preoperatively diagnosed PFO was associated
with an increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke within
30 days of surgery. The PFO-attributable RR of stroke was
more significantly increased among patients who were other-
wise at lower risk of stroke compared with those at higher
risk of stroke. The association between PFO and stroke
remained consistent after adjustment for risk factors of ische-
mic stroke and multiple sensitivity analyses, including strati-
fied analyses in patients who had received diagnostic tests
sensitive for the detection of PFO (TEE or contrast echocardi-
ography). PFO was associated with more large-vessel terri-
tory strokes, strokes with more severe neurological deficits,
and an increased risk of systemic embolic complications,
potentially providing a mechanistic link explaining the actual
etiology of the stroke.
PFO is the persistence of an embryonic defect in the atrial
septum into adulthood. Right-to-left intracardiac shunting oc-
curs across the PFO when there is reversal of the normal in-
teratrial pressure gradient, leading to the putative mecha-
nism of paradoxical embolism and ischemic stroke. This
phenomenon may be exacerbated by different factors in the
perioperative period. Intraoperatively, right-to-left shunting
may be more likely to occur as a result of hemorrhage, me-
chanical ventilation, patient positioning, and the fall in sys-
temic vascular resistance due to administration of anesthe-
sia. Postoperatively, the state of systemic inflammation and
hypercoagulability13 in the setting of withdrawal of regular an-
tiplatelet or anticoagulation treatment20 and complications
such as deep vein thrombosis, may interplay to create a high-
risk setting for thromboembolism. The markedly higher inci-
dence of ischemic strokes at 3.2% within a narrow time pe-
riod of 30 days after surgery in the study patients with PFO,
in comparison with a reported annual stroke incidence of 1.2%
to 1.7% in general populations with PFO,21,22 highlights the ex-
cess stroke risk in the perioperative period for patients with
PFO—at least those in whom it was clinically diagnosed prior
to surgery. Despite the pathophysiological plausibility, there
are sparse clinical data to address their association. There were
only 2 studies that examined the relationship of PFO and peri-
operative stroke. In 13 092 patients undergoing cardiac sur-
gery, investigators did not find any difference in incidence of
postoperative stroke between patients with and without an in-
traoperative incidental finding of PFO.23 However, that study
excluded all patients with preoperative diagnoses of PFO or
atrial septal defects, limiting the generalizability of the find-
ings to addressing the biological effects of PFO on periopera-
tive stroke. A more recent study examined the relationship be-
tween PFO and stroke among patients who underwent total
hip arthroplasty in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.24 Based
ona3:1propensity-matchedcohortincluding252patientswith
PFO and 756 control participants, the authors showed that the
risk of perioperative ischemic stroke was 29 times greater for
patients with PFO and atrial septal defects.
In the current study, PFO-related strokes were more fre-
quently large-vessel territory strokes and strokes with more
severe neurological deficits. Patients with PFO also experi-
enced an excess of perioperative complications due to sys-
temic embolism, including acute limb ischemia and renal ar-
tery embolism. These data provide support for the view of
increased vulnerability to thromboembolic complications in
patients with PFO during the perioperative period. It is clini-
cally important that patients with PFO in the cohort had more
severe strokes with a median NIHSS of 4 compared with 3
among patients without PFO. The correlation of the initial
NIHSS following a stroke with outcomes is well-established—
each additional point on the NIHSS decreases the likelihood
of excellent outcomes at 3 months by 17%.25

 An important finding from this study was that the PFO-
attributable risk of perioperative stroke was highest among pa-
tients with an otherwise low probability of perioperative is-
chemic stroke based on coexisting cardiovascular risk factors
andintraoperativecharacteristics.Thisisinlinewithmostpre-
vious studies in nonperioperative cohorts with cryptogenic
stroke, which showed that the significance of PFO in increas-
ingtheriskforstrokeishigherinpatientsyoungerthan55years

There are increasing data to support different strategies of
stroke prevention in patients with PFO. The National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence–accredited guideline for
stroke,27 and guidelines from the American Heart Associa-
tion and American Stroke Association28 recommend antiplate-
let therapy for secondary stroke prevention in the absence of
another indication for anticoagulation. More recently, sev-
eral randomized clinical trials demonstrated the value of PFO
closure in subgroups of patients with cryptogenic stroke,6-8,29
and existing guidelines for secondary stroke prevention may
be modified to reflect these important new findings. How-
ever, there are no guidelines for management of cases of pa-
tients undergoing surgery. In clinical practice, routine prophy-
lactic antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is frequently
withheld in the perioperative period. A recent consensus state-
mentontheperioperativecareofpatientsathighriskforstroke
did not identify patients with PFO as a high-risk group.30 The
current study identified a potentially actionable subgroup of
patients scheduled for a surgical procedure who present to an-
esthesiologists and surgeons with preoperatively diagnosed
PFO. Future studies are required to examine if these patients
would benefit from intensifying stroke-preventive measures
in the perioperative period (eg, an individualized risk-benefit
assessment with regards to timing and choice of periopera-
tive antithrombotic therapy, modified transfusion thresh-
olds, or preoperative PFO closure among select patients).
The strength of this study is the generalizability of the re-
sults to a large patient population undergoing noncardiac sur-
gery with general anesthesia. Patients undergoing cardiac sur-
gery were excluded for 2 reasons: these patients represent a
group with a potentially different stroke mechanism—one that
is more closely related to surgical factors, duration of car-
dioplegia, and air embolism, rather than venous thrombosis
and paradoxical embolism—which was the biological hypoth-
esis being tested; moreover, some but not all cardiac sur-
geons routinely close PFO encountered during cardiac sur-
gery, leading to potential bias.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, the observational na-
ture of the study and the use of administrative data and bill-
ing codes confer risks of unmeasured confounding and bias,
thoughthequestionofanyassociationbetweenPFOandstroke
could not be studied with a randomized study. Second, the
minimal clinically important difference for the present study
was based on a trial of PFO closure for secondary stroke pre-
vention, and therefore may not have been directly applicable
to the clinical scenario of postoperative stroke.19 Third, the co-
hort included only patients who were extubated at the end of
procedure; thus, it is possible that the stroke risk among pa-
tients who remain intubated after surgery is different.
Fourth, although only preoperatively diagnosed PFO
cases were considered, it is very likely that there was underi-
dentification of PFO in the non-PFO group, which would
have biased toward the null. Fifth, the indication for referral
for the test that identified PFO could also be a confounding
factor representing a risk factor for stroke. However, sensitiv-
ity analyses in those patients who had undergone prior to
surgery a diagnostic workup sensitive for the detection of
PFO, such as TEE or contrast echocardiography, showed a
PFO prevalence of 22% to 28%, compatible with most major
reports from the general population.31 The significant asso-
ciation of PFO with an increased risk of perioperative ische-
mic stroke in subgroups of patients with TEE and contrast
TEE further supports the view that the observed association
between PFO and perioperative stroke is unlikely to be exclu-
sively explained by a workup bias.
Conclusions
Among adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery at 3 hos-
pitals, having a preoperatively diagnosed PFO was signifi-
cantly associated with increased risk of perioperative ische-
mic stroke within 30 days after surgery. Further research is
needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether
interventions would decrease this risk.
