Abstract
Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are often used in cancer patients for staging, restaging, and 
monitoring for treatment response. These scans are also often used to detect recurrence in asymptomatic patients, 
despite a lack of evidence demonstrating improved survival. We sought to evaluate utilization of PET for this purpose and 
relationships with survival for patients with lung and esophageal cancers.
Methods: Using national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare-linked data, we identified 
incident patient cases from 2005 to 2009, with follow-up through 2011. We identified cohorts with primary lung (n = 97 152) 
and esophageal (n = 4446) cancers. Patient and tumor characteristics were used to calculate risk-adjusted two-year overall 
survival. Using Medicare claims, we examined PET utilization in person-years (to account for variable time in cohorts), 
excluding scans for staging and for follow-up of CT findings. We then stratified hospitals by quintiles of PET utilization for 
adjusted two-year survival analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: There was statistically significant variation in utilization of PET. Lowest vs highest utilizing hospitals performed 
.05 (SD = 0.04) vs 0.70 (SD = 0.44) scans per person-year for lung cancer and 0.12 (SD = 0.06) vs 0.97 (SD = 0.29) scans per 
person-year for esophageal cancer. Despite this, for those undergoing PET, lowest vs highest utilizing hospitals had an 
adjusted two-year survival of 29.0% (SD = 12.1%) vs 28.8% (SD = 7.2%) for lung cancer (P = .66) and 28.4% (SD = 7.2%) vs 
30.3% (SD = 5.9%) for esophageal cancer (P = .55).
Conclusions: Despite statistically significant variation in use of PET to detect tumor recurrence, there was no association 
with improved two-year survival. These findings suggest possible overuse of PET for recurrence detection, which current 
Medicare policy would not appear to substantially affect.
Use of positron emission tomography (PET) has consistently 
increased since the introduction of these scans in the 1970s 
(1). While extremely useful in appropriate situations, PET is an 
expensive technology. Medicare has gradually increased cover-
age of PET, from initial reimbursement in 1998 for the evaluation 
of solitary pulmonary nodules and initial staging of non–small 
cell lung cancers to many more indications (2). To gather evi-
dence regarding the utility of PET for various indications 
around cancer, Medicare established the National Oncologic 
PET Registry (NOPR) in 2005 with opening for accrual in 2006. 
In this registry, reimbursement for PET could be received in 
exchange for providing data from providers about utility of PET 
in management decisions, which were ultimately used to guide 
coverage decisions. This concept is known as Coverage with 
Evidence Development (CED). Using information gained from 
this national registry, PET reimbursements were expanded over

time to include use in many more cancers for the purposes of 
staging, restaging, and even treatment monitoring. As a result, 
the proportion of cancer patients undergoing PET has increased 
substantially over time, with a number of scans being performed 
for detection of recurrence in asymptomatic patients who are 
not currently receiving therapy (3). Despite this, there has been 
a persistent lack of evidence regarding the use of PET for these 
purposes in asymptomatic patients (4).
However, it is unclear to what extent PET is actually used for 
recurrence detection in asymptomatic patients despite the lack 
of evidence or formal coverage in this setting. There is suspicion 
that this type of use is actually quite prevalent, leading to the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommendation 
in their 2013 contribution to the Choosing Wisely campaign that 
providers “avoid using positron emission tomography or posi-
tron emission tomography–computed tomography scanning as 
part of routine follow-up care to monitor for cancer recurrence 
in asymptomatic patients who have finished initial treatment 
to eliminate the cancer unless there is high-level evidence that 
such imaging will change the outcome” (5). Moreover, in 2013, 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued 
Decision Memorandum CAG-00181R4, which effectively ended 
the NOPR for 18F-FDG PET scans and limited routine reimburse-
ment to three scans following initial treatment. While PET for 
recurrence detection in asymptomatic patients is technically 
not covered under Medicare, many believe that this three scan 
limit is aimed at preventing excessive use of PET for this very 
purpose (1). Despite this, some have advocated for PET in these 
circumstances because of the potential that earlier detection of 
recurrence could lead to better outcomes (6,7).
The purpose of this study was to identify how often PETs 
are actually used to detect recurrence in patients with lung and 
esophageal cancers despite limited evidence to support their 
utility. We sought to evaluate hospital-based variation in the use 
of PET for this purpose and the relationships between use of PET 
for recurrence detection with survival. Our hypothesis was that 
there would be statistically significant variation across hospi-
tals in the use of PET with little association with survival in this 
population of patients with poor prognosis cancers. Further, we 
hypothesized that the utilization of more than three PET scans 
after initial treatment is relatively low overall and that current 
CMS policy limiting PET coverage to three scans is not likely to 
substantially curb overuse.
Methods
We chose to study lung and esophageal cancers because of 
their similar poor prognoses and general anatomic location, yet 
with one being a relatively common malignancy and one being 
much more rare. We felt that studying both would help to pre-
vent detecting only disease-specific phenomena and establish 
if patterns of use are present at a hospital level. Because of dif-
ferences in cohort size, we chose to perform all of our analy-
ses separately for these two diseases. We divided hospitals into 
quintiles of utilization, allowing us to group and compare hospi-
tals by utilization of PET.
Data Source and Study Population
We identified cohorts of lung and esophageal cancer patients 
using the national Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER)–Medicare linked dataset. This set includes population-
based cancer sociodemographic and tumor characteristic data 
for patients from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER Program, 
encompassing approximately 28% of the US population (8). 
A subset of patients in the SEER registry is linked with Medicare 
claims data, which allows for examination of the details of 
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of inpatient and out-
patient medical care. Using this data, we identified incident 
patient cases of primary lung and esophageal cancers in the 
period from 2005 through 2009, with follow-up data including 
Medicare claims through 2011 using relevant ICD-9 diagnosis 
codes (lung: 162.x, esophageal: 150.x) for primary malignancies. 
Our exclusion criteria included patients first diagnosed prior to 
2005 or with an unknown diagnosis date, patients with a his-
tory of previous primary tumor, patients diagnosed on autopsy, 
patients younger than age 65 years or older than 99 years at 
diagnosis, patients with HMO or incomplete Medicare part A & 
B coverage 12 months prior to and after diagnosis, and patients 
at hospitals treating fewer than 10 patients with the given 
diagnosis in the study time period (Supplementary Figure 1, 
available online). In order to perform a hospital-level analysis, 
we attributed patients to hospitals at which they received the 
plurality of their care based on magnitude of Medicare pay-
ments. We excluded patients for which such a hospital could 
not be assigned. We identified both PET and CT Medicare 
claims using relevant Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 
codes (Supplementary Table 1, available online). Use of this 
data for this study was approved by the University of Michigan 
Institutional Review Board.
Statistical Analysis
For our survival analysis, we included all patients undergoing 
at least one PET scan. We calculated patient-level two-year sur-
vival. Patient tumor and sociodemographic characteristics were 
analyzed for risk-adjustment and to compare case mix across 
hospitals. Covariates included age, race, sex, marital status, and 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition cancer 
stage (9). Using multivariable logistic regression, risk-adjusted 
two-year survival was calculated. In testing model discrimi-
nation, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) was 0.81 and 0.77 for lung and esophageal cancers, 
respectively (10).
In our utilization analysis, we assessed the total number 
of PET scans billed for each patient using Current Procedural 
Terminology (CPT) codes, accounting for these studies in inpa-
tient and outpatient settings. For each patient, we excluded all 
duplicate studies billed on the same date of service, such that 
only one scan could be counted toward a patient’s total for a 
given date, even with a different CPT code. Using Medicare 
claims, it is not possible to know whether or not a scan was 
performed in a symptomatic patient. Because of this, we took 
several measures to ensure that we eliminated scans that were 
performed for staging and follow-up of other imaging. An ini-
tial “staging” scan performed within three months following 
diagnosis was not considered a recurrence detection scan. We 
wanted to avoid including scans that were used to potentially 
follow-up on a CT finding (ie, diagnostic or restaging PET). Thus, 
we excluded any PET beyond three months of diagnosis that was 
performed within 30 days following a CT scan. Finally, we sought 
to account for and exclude PET scans for treatment response 
monitoring. To do this, we performed a sensitivity analysis, 
repeating initial analyses using only patients with early-stage 
disease (stage I for lung cancer, stage I and II for esophageal 
cancer).
Patient time in cohort was calculated, and PET utilization was 
reported in person-years (ie, scans per patient per year), a measure

to account for and standardize the amount of time each patient 
spends in the cohort (11). We analyzed utilization and survival 
within hospital-level quintiles, divided evenly based on mean PET 
utilization. Following this, analysis of variance was used to com-
pare differences in mean PET utilization and survival across quin-
tiles (12). All tests of statistical significance were two-sided, with 
P values of .05 considered statistically significant. We performed 
all analyses using Stata release 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Cohort Characteristics
Using our exclusion criteria, we identified 97 152 patients in 
859 hospitals with lung cancer and 4446 patients in 215 hospi-
tals with esophageal cancer in our cohort. The median age of 
patients for both lung and esophageal cancers was 76 years. The 
majority of lung and esophageal cancer patients were men (52% 
and 73%, respectively). In both cohorts, over 80% of patients were 
white. Over 40% of lung cancer patients (38 761) and 26% (1167) 
of esophageal cancer patients in the cohort were AJCC stage IV.
PET Utilization
Basic characteristics of PET utilization are shown in Table 1. For 
lung and esophageal cancers, respectively, the total numbers of 
PETs were 100 479 and 6162, mean PETs per patient were 1.03 
and 1.39, percentages of scans in stage IV patients were 28.0% 
and 21.8%, and percentages of patients undergoing more than 
three scans were 7.4% and 11.1%.
Table 1 also shows results with exclusion of staging PET and 
follow-up or restaging PET. For lung and esophageal cancers, 
respectively, total PETs were 49 471 and 3160, the numbers of 
patients receiving 0 PET studies were 75 598 (77.8%) and 3060 
(68.8%), the numbers of patients receiving one PET study were 
11 044 (11.4%) and 666 (15.0%), the numbers of patients receiv-
ing two PET studies were 4350 (4.5%) and 297 (6.7%), and num-
bers of patients receiving three PET studies were 2416 (2.5%) and

187 (4.2%). Notably, the percentages of patients of all stages in 
the cohorts undergoing more than three scans were 3744 (3.9%) 
and 236 (5.3%), respectively. In other words, the proportions of 
patients completely unaffected by the 2013 Medicare policy 
change would have likely been 96.1% and 94.7% for lung and 
esophageal cancers, respectively.
Finally, as was studied further in our sensitivity analysis, the 
percentages of all scans occurring in stage I (lung) and stage I and 
II (esophageal) cancer patients were 28.3% and 44.3%, respectively.
Survival
Using multivariable logistic regression, we calculated risk-
adjusted two-year survival. Risk factor statistics are shown in 
Supplementary Table 2 (available online). For lung cancer, risk 
factors included advancing age, male sex, black race, single mari-
tal status and advancing AJCC stage. For esophageal cancer, risk 
factors included all of these with the exception of male sex. Using 
this information, we calculated risk-adjusted two-year survival.
Utilization of PET was analyzed at a hospital level, with hos-
pitals divided into quintiles based on PET utilization (Table 2). 
For both cancers, higher utilizing hospitals treated higher per-
centages of white patients, while lower utilizing hospitals 
treated higher percentages of black patients. Higher utilization 
occurred at higher volume hospitals in lung cancer. For all can-
cers, the case mix by AJCC stage was similar across quintiles.
Hospital-Based Variation in PET Utilization Without 
Improved Survival
The results of our analysis of utilization and survival across hos-
pitals is shown in Figure 1. For each cancer, there is statistically 
significant variation in mean PET utilization across quintiles. 
Lowest vs highest utilizing hospitals performed 0.05 (SD = 0.04) 
vs 0.70 (SD = 0.44) scans per person-year for lung cancer and 0.12 
(SD = 0.06) vs 0.97 (SD = 0.29) scans per person-year for esopha-
geal cancer (P < .001 for both). Despite this variation, for those 
patients undergoing PET two-year survival was not significantly 
improved across hospitals. Lowest vs highest utilizing hospitals 
had a mean adjusted two-year survival of 29.0% (SD = 12.1%) vs 
28.8% (SD = 7.2%) for lung cancer (P = .66) and 28.4% (SD = 7.2%) 
vs 30.3% (SD = 5.9%) for esophageal cancer (P = .55).
The results of our sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 2. 
In this subgroup of patients with early-stage disease, the results 
are similar. For each cancer, there is statistically significant vari-
ation in mean PET utilization across quintiles. Lowest vs highest 
utilizing hospitals performed 0.11 (SD = 0.04) vs 0.71 (SD = 0.35) 
scans per person-year for lung cancer and 0.17 (SD = 0.14) vs 
0.92 (SD = 0.76) scans per person-year for esophageal cancer (P 
< .001 for both). Despite this variation, for those patients under-
going PET, two-year survival was not statistically significantly 
improved across quintiles. Lowest vs highest utilizing hospi-
tals had an adjusted two-year survival of 65.1% (SD = 3.5%) vs 
65.5% (SD = 3.3%) for lung cancer and 52.8% (SD = 5.3%) vs 52.8% 
(SD = 4.4%) for esophageal cancer.
As an additional sensitivity analysis, we compared hospitals 
across disease groups. We found that 75% of the highest utiliz-
ing (4th and 5th quintile) hospitals for esophageal cancer were also 
in these same quintiles for lung cancer. This suggests that many 
high-utilizing hospitals are high users across both disease groups.
Discussion
The results of this study show that there is high overall use of 
PET in lung and esophageal cancers, with statistically significant

hospital-based variation in use of PET for recurrence detection. 
Despite this, there is no association with improved two-year survival 
in higher utilizing hospitals. This combination of hospital-based var-
iation without survival benefit suggests potential overuse and that 
efforts to decrease such overuse are warranted. Another striking and 
perhaps unexpected finding was that more scans are performed in 
stage IV patients than in any other group in both cancers. Moreover, 
a major strength of this study is the nationally representative nature 
of the cohort. SEER-Medicare provides the patient sociodemographic 
and tumor characteristics necessary for this analysis in addition to 
the claims-based imaging utilization data that Medicare provides. 
This allows for analysis of national patterns of PET utilization.

A potential implication of this study is that use of PET for 
recurrence detection appears to be common in some hospitals. 
The Decision Memo released by CMS in 2013 limiting patients 
to three scans following initial anticancer therapy was based 
on several years of data collection by the NOPR. Interestingly 
however, over 90% of patients in the NOPR 2006 and 2009 
cohorts had fewer than three scans and the mean number per 
patient was 1.6, with a range of 1 to 29 scans. Even this data 
would suggest that while this policy may curb extreme overuse 
it is unlikely to have any effect on over 90% of patients under-
going recurrence detection PET, and our results are consistent 
with this.

Given this, we believe targets to reduce variation are two-fold. 
First, CMS should reconsider its policy limiting patients to three 
scans following initial anticancer therapy. If this is intended to 
curb overuse, it appears unlikely to do this. However, this should 
be further studied once more data following this policy becomes 
available. Second, we believe that this information should be fed 
back to hospitals to improve practices. This type of activity can 
possibly be done in a statewide or regional collaborative setting, 
in which hospital representatives meet regularly to discuss and 
disseminate best practices, as well as consider collecting data 
on imaging practices.
Arguments against Medicare’s decision have implied that 
using PET for recurrence detection in asymptomatic patients 
might be more sensitive for earlier detection of recurrence or 
metastatic disease in a more treatable state, thus implying a 
survival benefit for the use of this expensive technology (1,6,7). 
The results of our study suggest that this is not likely to be the 
case for this group of patients with poor prognosis cancers. 
Some have previously contended that the impact of PET on sur-
vival is not likely to be statistically significant in most cases, as 
PET is a diagnostic test and part of a chain of tests and treat-
ments for these cancer patients (1). But in patients with poor 
prognosis cancers, does the added information that PET pro-
vides yield sufficient value to justify the high cost of such scans, 
especially for recurrence detection in asymptomatic patients? 
While NOPR was able to detect changes in management, inves-
tigators were not able to identify whether these management 
changes improved long-term outcomes. Our results support 
ASCO’s contribution to the Choosing Wisely campaign recom-
mending avoidance of use of PET to detect recurrence in the 
absence of high-level evidence that such imaging will change 
outcomes.
Detection of PET for recurrence in asymptomatic patients has 
been studied in other cancer types. One well-done systematic 
review covering a diversity of tumor types (lymphoma, colorec-
tal cancer, and head and neck cancer) is especially informative 
(4). This review looked at 12 studies in total and concluded insuf-
ficient evidence to draw conclusions on the clinical impact of 
PET or PET/CT for surveillance. Our study provides data on PET 
use in two cancers that were not studied in this review. Lung 
and esophageal cancers, both poor prognosis cancers, are espe-
cially susceptible to variation in treatment patterns and inten-
sity, and our study demonstrates that this is true in the use of 
PET. Many other previous studies of PET have noted changes in 
management rather than impact on patient outcomes (13–16). 
One study described PET findings leading to a change from non-
treatment to treatment (30%) more often than a change from 
treatment to nontreatment (8%) (15). The overwhelming major-
ity of these patients received some change in their therapy, as 
opposed to a transition to observation or supportive care. It is 
impossible to know in these datasets how appropriate these 
decisions are, but what is clear is that there is a lower chance of 
receiving less aggressive therapy or stopping therapy following 
PET for staging or treatment monitoring. Our study adds to this, 
with no evidence of improvement in long-term outcomes with 
PET to detect tumor recurrence.
Another topic of recent studies is geographic variation in the 
use of cancer imaging and subsequent implications (11,17,18). 
One study compared VA and Medicare cohorts of patients to 
determine differences in imaging utilization and geographic 
variation (11). Investigators identified similar statistically sig-
nificant geographic variation in both cohorts but statistically 
significantly less spending in the VA system. This implies that 
geographic variation alone is not sufficient to demonstrate 
overutilization. Yet another recent study demonstrated within-
region and not just inter-region variation in use of diagnostic 
imaging across two distinct types of cancer (17). Some have 
expressed caution in light of these results, specifically regarding 
policies sought to curb overuse at the regional level as variation 
has been shown to exist within regions and simply attempting 
to make utilization uniform where there is high spending, with-
out regard for appropriateness of use, could have unintended 
consequences (18). Our main outcome measure of PET utiliza-
tion is based on a more local measure—hospital-based varia-
tion—with evidence of overuse demonstrated not simply by the 
presence of variation alone, but with a lack of association with 
improved survival.
There are likely myriad causes for the variation we observed. 
First, providers are likely to have specific imaging-related prac-
tice patterns. Second, hospitals may have different degrees of 
communication between these varying providers. Perhaps in a 
hospital where radiologists regularly communicate with oncolo-
gists, fewer tests are ordered after discussions of indication and 
utility.
Perhaps the most substantial limitation to this work is 
that we cannot directly detect asymptomatic patients using 
Medicare claims data. We specifically did not include a first scan 
within three months of diagnosis (which we attributed to stag-
ing) and scans performed within 30 days following a CT scan 
(which would likely be performed to follow-up on a CT finding). 
While this helps to identify some clearly appropriate scans, it is 
not possible to say whether an individual patient in our study 
was asymptomatic. Because of the importance of this point, we 
also performed a sensitivity analysis using patients with early-
stage disease to assess for any differences in our main outcome 
measures and found no clear differences in patterns of hospital-
based variation in PET utilization.
Other limitations to our study include the fact that we used 
SEER-Medicare, a retrospective linked registry and claims-based 
dataset. SEER represents 28% of all cancer patients in the United 
States and is considered an authoritative source for national 
cancer survival data (8). Importantly, due to the potential for 
confounding, it is not possible in an observational study such 
as this, to retrospectively determine cause-and-effect relation-
ships, as to whether PET scans intended to detect tumor recur-
rence improve survival. Thus we can only say from our study 
that there does not appear to be a clear association between 
increased use of PET to detect tumor recurrence as we defined it 
and improved overall survival.
We were interested in hospital-level patterns in PET utiliza-
tion, but it is possible that if individual patients within hospitals 
experienced benefit with increased PET utilization this may not 
have been detected, even after accounting for clustering. This 
hospital-level analysis allows us to standardize for patient time 
in the cohort by reporting scans per person-year. In a patient-
level analysis, the only way to achieve similar standardization 
is to perform a cross-sectional analysis at a given point in time. 
This type of analysis showed a similar amount of broad varia-
tion in PET utilization among patients alive at two years in both 
cohorts (data not shown). Future studies to address these topics 
should be prospectively performed to mitigate potential immor-
tality time bias, ecological fallacy, or bias by indication, and 
focus on multiple levels of evaluation and potential confounders 
at patient, provider, hospital, and perhaps regional levels. Our 
study only examines patients in the Medicare population, and 
thus these results may not be generalizable to younger patients. 
However, the median ages at diagnosis of lung and esophageal 
cancer are 70 and 67 years, respectively (19). Our study results

come from patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2009, before 
the current CMS policy that began the three PET scan limit. 
Because of this, our data can only be used to anticipate how 
much this policy could be expected to curb overuse. However, 
our results show that a relatively small proportion of patients is 
likely to be affected by this policy, and thus it will be interesting, 
when more recent data becomes available, to see if this policy is 
associated with changed practice patterns.
Overuse of tests, specifically PET for detection of tumor 
recurrence after initial treatment, has been raised as a concern, 
especially in patients with poor prognosis cancers. Our results 
support this. Providers must take note of available data when 
making clinical imaging decisions to avoid unnecessary overuse. 
Medicare’s current policy limits routine reimbursement to three 
scans, meant to guide subsequent management after comple-
tion of initial cancer therapy. Our findings highlight patterns of 
variation in the use of PET to detect tumor recurrence without 
clear benefit in long-term patient outcomes, which would not 
appear to be affected substantially by current Medicare policy.
