Context: Medical school can produce intense psychological distress in its students;
however, there is a paucity of research exploring potential means of improving
medical students’ well-being.
Objective: To investigate the relationship between physical exercise and stress and
quality of life (QOL) in a medical student population.
Methods: This nonrandomized, controlled, 12-week study used a survey research
design. First- and second-year osteopathic medical students at the University of
New England College of Osteopathic Medicine were recruited to participate in 1 of
3 groups: (1) students participating in 30-minute CXWORX (Les Mills International
LTD) group fitness classes; (2) students exercising alone or with up to 2 additional
partners regularly (eg, running, weight lifting), henceforth called the health-
enhancement group; and (3) students in a control group who did not engage in
regular exercise. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale survey once
every 4 weeks, as well as visual analog scale surveys to assess physical, mental,
and emotional QOL weekly during the course of the study. Statistical significance
was defined as P<.05.
Results: Sixty-nine participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the study
protocol, with 25 in the fitness class group, 29 in the health-enhancement group,
and 15 in the control group. Compared with baseline values, the fitness class group
demonstrated decreased perceived stress (P=.038) and increased physical QOL
(P=.007), mental QOL (P=.046), and emotional QOL (P=.004) after 12 weeks.
Participants in the health-enhancement and control groups showed no statistically
significant changes between baseline and week 12 for any of these parameters,
with the exception of mental QOL, which improved in the health-enhancement
group (P=.023).
Conclusion: Participation in regular group fitness classes led to a statistically sig-
nificant decrease in perceived stress and an increase in physical, mental, and emo-
tional QOL compared with exercising regularly on one’s own or not engaging in
regular exercise. Attending weekly group fitness classes could be a solution to
improving the emotional well-being and stress level of medical students.

edical school often produces intense psychological distress for medical stu-
dents. This distress is manifested as depression, anxiety, burnout, increased
alcohol use, fatigue, and low quality of life (QOL).1-5 Incidences of major

 depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are
5-fold higher in medical trainees than in their age-
matched, nonmedical counterparts.6 These findings
have important implications for both personal well-
being as well as empathy, interpersonal relationships,
and attitude toward the medical profession.7-9 While
there is ample research highlighting medical student
distress,1-9 there is limited research exploring potential
countermeasures.
A positive correlation has been found between phys-
ical exercise and mental and emotional health.10-13
Physical exercise has been shown to have a positive
influence on depression, anxiety, improved capacity
for dealing with stress, and elevation of mood.10,14
Conversely, most medical school–related activities are
sedentary
(eg,
attending
classes
and
studying).
Furthermore, medical education typically contains
little, if any, instruction on the importance of physical
activity or how to counsel patients regarding physical
fitness.15-17 Of note, medical students who engage in
physical activity are more likely to counsel their
patients to do so as well.18
To the authors’ knowledge, few studies have exam-
ined the potential positive effects of physical exercise
on mental health in a medical student population, and
no studies have looked specifically at the osteopathic
medical student population. Parkerson et al19 identified
a negative correlation between physical activity and
both anxiety and depression. Similarly, Sheets et al20
indicated that academic stress levels are lower in
medical students engaging in physical activity, and
Cecil et al21 reported that physical activity is negatively
correlated to emotional exhaustion. However, these
studies were all multifactorial survey studies that did
not quantify the regularity or duration of physical activ-
ity, nor did they profile the type or the individual or
group nature of the exercise.
The purpose of the current study was to investigate
the relationship between exercise and QOL in a
medical student population and to compare the effects
of group exercise with individual exercise or no exer-
cise on stress and QOL. The authors hypothesized that
(1) participation in regular exercise would yield
decreased perceived stress and increased physical,
mental, and emotional QOL and (2) participation in a
group fitness class would yield greater stress reduction
and QOL improvement than exercising individually.
Methods
The institutional review board at the University of New
England approved all methods, and participants pro-
vided informed consent electronically before entering
the study and completing the first surveys.
Participants
Demographic information was collected at baseline.
First- and second-year osteopathic medical students at
the University of New England College of Osteopathic
Medicine (UNECOM) were recruited via classwide
e-mails,
class
announcements,
and
class-specific
Facebook postings to participate in a 12-week con-
trolled study. Students were allowed to self-select into
1 of 3 nonrandomized groups:
▪ Fitness class group: Using CXWORX (Les Mills
International LTD), the group fitness class partici-
pants engaged in at least 1 class per week, plus add-
itional exercise if desired.
▪ Health-enhancement group: This group included
students exercising alone or with up to 2 additional
partners regularly (eg, running, weight lifting) at least
twice per week.
▪ Control group: Beyond walking or biking as a
means of transportation, this group did not engage in
regular exercise.
Students were withdrawn from the study if they did not
comply with the exercise requirements outlined for
their chosen group. Students were not excluded from
the study if they were already engaging in group
fitness classes. However, as this project was developed
partially in an effort to lay the foundation for an endur-
ing group fitness program for UNECOM, there were

 few regular group fitness opportunities available for
students before this study.
Study Intervention
Fitness classes were led by a UNECOM student (D.M.
Y.) certified in the method. The exercise modality used
targets and strengthens core musculature to improve
functional fitness in a 30-minute session. The exercises
use body weight, resistance tubes, or free weights to
challenge coordination, balance, and strength, and each
exercise has modifications to accommodate varying
fitness levels and abilities. Although the routine followed
the same general format, it was altered every week or so
with different music and choreography. The workout
consisted of 6 “tracks.” Each track was 1 song in length
and focused on a specific physical objective (eg, oblique
strengthening, glute/hip stabilization). In each track, the
instructor provided options to either increase or decrease
intensity based on fitness level as well as indications to
either increase or decrease the intensity.
Survey Instruments
Both surveys were administered before beginning exer-
cise (baseline) and at the end of the study. A comple-
tion survey was administered after the study that asked
participants in each study group whether he or she
would continue to exercise or not exercise.
Stress
To assess the degree to which situations in one’s life were
appraised as stressful,
participants
completed the
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), one of the most widely
used psychological instruments for measuring the percep-
tion of stress.22-24 The PSS is a 10-item survey in which
answers are on a 0-to-4-point scale based on frequency
of experiencing a given situation (eg, “In the last month,
how often have you felt nervous and stressed”?), with 0
indicating never and 4 indicating very often. The items
are scored and summed for a possible maximum total of
40 points; the higher the score, the greater the stress.
This survey was administered once every 4 weeks—a
timeline consistent with existing PSS literature.
QOL
Participants completed surveys to assess perception of
stress once every 4 weeks. The QOL surveys were
created based on visual analog scales (VASs) that have
been validated for some metrics (eg, pain).25 The VASs
were created with clear definitions of physical, mental,
and emotional QOL. Participants rated their physical,
mental, and emotional QOL on a scale of 0 (as bad as
it can be) to 10 (as good as it can be).26,27 These
surveys were created using SurveyMonkey and distribu-
ted weekly to participants via e-mail on the Sunday of
the appropriate week. Participants were given a dead-
line of the following Sunday to complete the surveys
but were encouraged to complete them by no later
than Wednesday. E-mail reminders were sent 1 to 2
days after the survey was sent.
Exercise Logs
Exercise logs were created via SurveyMonkey and dis-
tributed along with the other study surveys to ensure
compliance and to monitor type and duration of daily
exercise, as well as the number of participants involved.
Statistical Analysis
Based on Cramer von Mises analysis, the data followed
a normal distribution; thus, parametric tests were per-
formed. Presurvey vs postsurvey data were analyzed
using 2-tailed t tests. Between group and multiple time
point data were analyzed using a 3 (groups) × 4 (time
points) analyses of variance. Where significance was
identified, the Fisher least significant difference was
used for post-hoc analysis. Statistical significance was
determined at P≤.05.
Results
A total of 94 participants were recruited to the study
(fitness class group, 33; health-enhancement, 39;
control, 22). Over the course of the study, 8 participants
each withdrew from the fitness class group and the
health-enhancement group, and 6 withdrew from the
control group. Additionally, because of noncompliance,

 2 participants in the health-enhancement group and 1
participant in the control group were excluded from
analysis. Therefore, 25 fitness class participants, 29
health-enhancement participants, and 15 control parti-
cipants met inclusion criteria and completed the study
protocol (N=69) (Table 1).
Each group included approximately a 2:1 ratio of
second-year medical students to first-year medical stu-
dents. No significant differences were found in baseline
values for PSS (P=.85), physical QOL (P=.62), mental
QOL (P=.13), or emotional QOL (P=.31) between first-
and second-year students. Because of self-selection, the
ratio of men to women was not consistent across
groups. However, no significant differences were
found in baseline values for PSS (P=.96), physical
QOL (P=.95), mental QOL (P=.94), or emotional
QOL (P=.43) between men and women.
Before beginning the study, a baseline level of activ-
ity was estimated from the self-reported days in which
participants engaged in 30 or more minutes of inten-
tional exercise (eg, strength training, cardiovascular
exercise) during the previous month (Table 2). The
main effect revealed a significant difference in baseline
activity level between groups (P<.001). Post-hoc ana-
lyses revealed that the baseline activity levels of the
fitness class and health-enhancement groups were sig-
nificantly higher than baseline activity levels of the
control group (P<.001), but the baseline activity level
did not differ significantly between the fitness class
and the health-enhancement groups (P=.32). The
fitness class group participated in a mean (SD) of 1.55
(0.28) 30-minute group exercise classes per week.
Including other forms of exercise they were allowed to
engage in, the fitness class group exercised a total of
2.95 (0.34) hours per week. The health-enhancement
group exercised 4.11 (0.66) hours per week, and the
control group, 0.48 (0.24) hours per week. Participants
in the health-enhancement group exercised with 3 or
more additional partners 0.53 times per week; partici-
pants in the control group did not participate in group
exercise.
At baseline, no significant differences existed
between any of the experimental groups for PSS,
physical QOL, or mental QOL. Emotional QOL was
significantly lower in the fitness class group than the
health-enhancement or control groups at baseline
(P=.047; Table 2). Comparing baseline and week 12,
the fitness class group
showed
decreased PSS
(P=.038) and increased physical QOL (P=.007),
mental QOL (P=.046), and emotional QOL (P=.004;
Table 3). The health-enhancement and control groups
showed no statistically significant changes between

showed an improvement in the health-enhancement

Within-group analyses of variance showed a
decreased PSS score in the fitness class group
(P=.064) (Figure 1). No significant changes were
found in the PSS score for the control (P=.52) or
health-enhancement (P=.35) groups. Because QOL
may vary weekly, a 12-week mean value was calcu-
lated for each group. Between-groups differences

cated that the fitness class group scored significantly
higher in mental QOL than the health-enhancement
(P=.04) or control (P=.003) groups. The fitness
class group also scored significantly higher in
physical
QOL
than
the
health-enhancement
(P=.036) or control (P=.002) groups, and it scored
significantly higher in emotional QOL than the

groups.
Discussion
Medical school is stressful and can negatively affect
students’ QOL.1-9 The findings of the present study
demonstrate a significant decrease in perceived stress
and an increase in physical, mental, and emotional
QOL for students who regularly participated in a
12-week group fitness program compared with students

 who participated in exercise regimens on their own or
who did not engage in formal physical activity.
No significant difference was noted in the baseline
amounts of physical activity or group exercise between
fitness class and health-enhancement groups. This
finding suggests that the significant increase in the 3
QOL measures in the fitness class group were specific
to the novel group exercise regime. The possibility that
the social aspects of group exercise improved QOL and
decreased stress also cannot be discounted. The social
component of group exercise is therapeutic.28,29
Furthermore,
group
exercise
classes
often
use
up-tempo music and choreography to make the class
more fun and engaging. Bringing together medical stu-
dents who are all going through similar stresses to work
out and have fun may transcend the experience of
working out on their own.
The interconnectedness of body, mind, and spirit is
inherent in osteopathic philosophy.30 Furthermore,
physical activity has been positively correlated with
QOL in college-aged and older adult populations.31-33
In child and adolescent populations, fitness levels and
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity have been posi-
tively correlated with academic performance.34-36 To
the authors’ knowledge, no such data have been
collected from a medical student population. Medical
education is an endeavor that requires long hours of
sedentary behavior, and these findings28-36 all point
to the importance of incorporating a physical fitness
component into osteopathic medical school, either as
a curricular offering or as part of a student health
benefit, such as a fitness class or club membership
discount.
This research is not only relevant to students during
their medical education, but also to their lives as future
physicians. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, more than 35.1% of adults in
the United States are obese, and 69.0% of adults in the

 United States are overweight or obese.37 Not only is
obesity a risk factor for diseases, including heart
disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, but it also
increases annual medical costs by $1429 over that
incurred by patients of normal weight.38 Many
medical education curricula do not include formal
instruction on how to develop exercise programs with
patients
or
counsel
them
regarding
exercise
habits.15-17,39
Regardless
of
formal
instruction,
medical students who engage in physical activity
throughout their training are more likely to provide
fitness counseling to their patients.18 The current study
speaks to these very issues: By encouraging student
doctors to be physically active and researching how
their activity level can positively influence other areas
of their lives, we hope to inspire a generation of future
physicians that will lead healthy lifestyles. We believe
that if physicians lead by example and address their
wellness, then they can more effectively inspire and
educate their patients to do the same.
The psychological distress experienced by many stu-
dents during their medical education can have severe
consequences, such as burnout, higher rates of depres-
sion, stress, low QOL, and fatigue.1-9 Osteopathic phil-
osophy teaches that “The body is a unit; the person is a
unit of body, mind, and spirit” and “Structure and func-
tion are reciprocally interrelated.”30 Therefore, this dis-
tress can have negative effects on a personal level—
including substance abuse, relationship difficulties,
suicide, and attrition from the profession, as well as on
a professional level, including cynicism, which may sub-
sequently affect patient care, relationships with faculty,

 and the culture of the medical profession.9 It is critical
that medical education address this issue. Given the posi-
tive impact that group exercise had on medical student
stress and QOL, we recommend that other osteopathic
medical schools consider offering formal group fitness
programs and promoting other social fitness activities as
ways to encourage behavior that is both beneficial to
student well-being as well as in line with osteopathic
philosophy.
The present study is not without limitations. The
sample size was small. Rather than being randomly
assigned, the participants self-selected into the study
groups. It was feared that students would withdraw
from the study or fail to comply if assigned to the
control group. This randomization would have further
narrowed our sample size and diminished generalizabil-
ity of the study results. The fitness class, health-
enhancement, and control groups all started at the
same level of perceived stress and physical and mental
QOL, but the fitness class group had lower baseline
emotional QOL compared with the other 2 groups. It
is possible that those who self-selected into the fitness
class group were looking for a means of improving
their emotional QOL. An additional limitation is that
one of the authors (D.M.Y.) led the group fitness
classes. It is possible that this author inadvertently
introduced bias into the class.
Future research should include involvement of other
medical schools (osteopathic and allopathic) and should
be expanded to include third- and fourth-year medical
students and residents. Future research should also use
additional validated measures of QOL, well-being,
stress, and depression. Because the habits of physical
activity and nutrition are commonly linked, future
research should also attempt to distinguish the individual
and combined benefits of these habits on QOL.
Conclusion
Participation in group fitness classes led to a decrease in
perceived stress and an increase in physical, mental,
and emotional QOL compared with participation in
exercise individually or not participating in regular
exercise. These findings should not be interpreted as a
condemnation of individual exercise. We believe much
benefit can be derived from physical exercise of any
kind, but the addition of group fitness classes in a
medical student population may have additional bene-
fits. Engaging in social fitness activities could be a
solution to improving the well-being of medical stu-
dents and physicians.
