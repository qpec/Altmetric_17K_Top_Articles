MicroRNAs (miRs) are 18~23 nucleotides long non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. 
To explore whether miR alterations in tauopathy contribute to pathological conditions, we first 
determined which hippocampal miRs are altered at the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of 
tauopathy using rTg4510 mice (Tau mice), a well-characterized tauopathy model. miR-RNA pairing 
analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed 401 genes that can be regulated 
by 71 miRs altered in Tau hippocampi at the presymptomatic stage. Among several miRs confirmed 
with real-time qPCR, miR142 (−3p and −5p) in Tau hippocampi were significantly upregulated by 
two-weeks of age and onward. Transcriptome studies by RNAseq and IPA revealed several overlapping 
biological and disease associated pathways affected by either Tau or miR142 overexpression, including 
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3) and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (Tnfr2) 
signaling pathways. Similar to what was observed in Tau brains, overexpressing miR142 in wildtype 
cortical neurons augments mRNA levels of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (Gfap) and Colony Stimulating 
Factor 1 (Csf1), accompanied by a significant increase in microglia and reactive astrocyte numbers. 
Taken together, our study suggests that miR alterations by Tau overexpression may contribute to the 
neuroinflammation observed in Tau brains.
MicroRNAs (miRs) constitute an abundant class of non-coding RNA molecules that are endogenously expressed 
in multicellular organisms. They are 18–23 nucleotides long, and often regulate gene expression by mRNA degra-
dation or translational repression1,2. Many miRs are enriched in brain, and contribute to brain development, neu-
ral plasticity and neuroprotection3–8. The levels of many miRs are altered in neurodegenerative diseases9–12. For 
example, Lau et al. identified 35 miRs altered in the prefrontal cortex of late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) 
patients13. Interestingly, deleting Dicer, a critical enzyme involved in miR synthesis, in adult brain results in Tau 
hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss, the pathological phenotypes associated with tauopathy, manifested 
as deposition of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles11. However, it is unclear whether miR changes are already 
present at the presymptomatic stages of neurodegenerative diseases, and if such miR changes can directly impact 
biological pathways that may subsequently lead to neurodegeneration.
Tauopathies include a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick’s 
disease, parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and AD14–17. Previously, miRs have been identified 
as modulators of Tau, and contribute to Tau pathology18–21. Santa-Maria et al. showed that Tau is one of the 
direct targets of miR21922. MiR219 downregulation aggravated Tau induced toxicity, whereas its overexpression 
alleviated the toxic effects. Therefore, miR219 expression may modulate Tau toxicity by post-transcriptionally 
repressing Tau expression. In AD brains, miR132-3p levels are mainly decreased in neurons enriched with 
hyper-phosphorylated Tau13. Several genes implicated in Tau network, including the transcription factor (TF) 
FOXO1a, were identified as miR132-3p targets by in silico methods13. Knocking out the miR132/212 cluster 
results in an increase in Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Interestingly, in an AD mouse model, miR132 
treatment rescued memory deficits23. Consistent with previous studies, genome-wide studies using 39 AD and 
25 control brains found significant downregulation of miR132/212 cluster in AD temporal cortex (TC)24. It is

unclear how altered miR levels lead to the abnormal regulation of biological pathways that contribute to Tau 
pathology. The mechanistic insights on how miRs contribute to Tau pathology will provide new insights govern-
ing disease outcomes.
In this study, we aimed to identify RNA changes contributing to tauopathy. We first determined both miR 
and mRNA changes at presymptomatic stage of tauopathy. Second, miR-RNA pairing analysis was conducted 
to identify putative miR targets. Third, we overexpressed miR142, one of the identified miRs upregulated in 
tauopathy, in wildtype brains to examine its impact on gene expression. Fourth, bioinformatics analysis revealed 
several overlapping gene transcriptional changes as well as canonical and disease-associated pathways between 
Tau and miR142 overexpression. In summary, miR changes at an early stage of tauopathy are likely to contribute 
to disease progression.
Results
Age-dependent miR expression changes in Tau hippocampi. 
The rTg4510 mouse line (abbreviated 
as Tau mice for simplicity) has been widely used and characterized as a tauopathy mouse model25–27. These mice 
overexpress human Tau that carries the P301L mutation identified in frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism 
on chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) under the control of CAMKIIα
-tTA26. Forebrain-Tau(P301L) expression starts 
after birth and peaks at around 2 months (2 m) of age26,28. Signs of neurodegeneration become detectable at 2.5 m. 
Tau tangles are observed in the cortex after 4 m and in the hippocampus after 5.5 m accompanied with severe age 
dependent cognitive decline and neuronal loss28. To determine whether Tau(P301L) overexpression alters miR 
levels, we employed RNAseq (Illumina GAIIx platform with raw reads of 40 nucleotides) to assess miR changes 
at two time points: An early presymptomatic stage when no obvious abnormalities are detected (2 m) (control, 
n = 3; Tau, n = 3; Supplementary Table 1); and a late symptomatic stage when severe Tau pathology and neuronal 
loss are evident (6 m) (control, n = 2; Tau, n = 4; Supplementary Table 1).
Differential expression analysis for known miRs between control and Tau hippocampi (depicted by heat maps 
in Fig. 1A) shows that: 121 miRs are significantly changed at 2 m (P < 0.05) with 51 upregulated and 70 downreg-
ulated in Tau hippocampi; 92 miRs are significantly changed (P < 0.05) at 6 m with 48 upregulated and 44 down-
regulated in Tau hippocampi (Fig. 1B). Among these miR changes, 21 miRs are altered in the same direction for 
both 2 m and 6 m (13 upregulated and 8 downregulated; a complete list of the differentially expressed annotated 
miRs is provided in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and GSE106967). Selected miRs were experimentally validated 
by qPCR analysis. For 2 m, miR142-3p, miR181b, miR181a (also known as miR213) and miR219-5p were vali-
dated; and for 6 m, validation was performed for miR142-3p, miR142-5p, miR339 and miR1249 (Fig. 1C).
miR-RNA pairing analysis to identify putative miR targets and pathways in Tau hippocampi at 
a presymptomatic stage. 
In order to correlate the global effect on gene expression that, in part, is con-
tributed by miR alterations in the Tau hippocampus, we performed mRNA sequencing with 2 m hippocampi. 
A multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot, assessing the similarities/differences among the expression profiles, 
shows clear separation between control and Tau hippocampi (control, n = 5; Tau, n = 6; Supplementary Fig. 2). 
The differential expression (DE) analysis identified 254 upregulated and 258 downregulated genes (FDR < 0.05) 
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table 4; GSE107183). qPCR experiments validated the differential expression levels 
of the following genes: Prion Protein (Prnp), Complement C4B (C4b) and Triggering Receptor Expressed on 
Myeloid Cells 2 (Trem2) (Fig. 2B).
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity H Systems, www.ingenuity.com) was then used for network 
analysis to correlate the observed transcriptomic changes to underlying Canonical Pathways, Transcriptomic 
Networks, and Disease Biofunctions (Supplementary Table 5). The top canonical signaling pathway revealed 
by IPA analysis corresponds to “Neuroinflammation Signaling Pathway”
, which includes Interleukin 6 Receptor 
(IL6R), Trem2 and Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (Csf1r) as key genes (Supplementary Table 5). 
Inflammatory Response, Cell-To-Cell Signaling and Interaction, Cellular Function and Maintenance network was 
identified as one of the top 5 transcriptomic networks (Fig. 2C). This network includes Csf3r, Interferon alpha/
beta (Ifn-alpha/beta) and Trem2, key genes involved in inflammation.
Next, we conducted miR-mRNA pairing analysis to assess the potential transcriptome changes resulting 
from miR-alterations in 2 m Tau hippocampi. Specifically, IPA analysis was conducted to examine the overlap 
between miR-targets, identified by IPA’s “microRNA Target Filter” feature, and differentially changed mRNAs 
from 2 m Tau hippocampi, identified by RNA sequencing. IPA “microRNA Target Filter” predicts miR targets 
with data collected in TargetScan’s human predicted target dataset, and experimentally validated targets from 
TarBase. This pairing analysis found 72 miRNAs pair with 401 gene targets (Supplementary Table 6). Pathway 
analysis of these overlapping targets revealed that “Neuroinflammation Signaling Pathway” is the top canonical 
pathway, “Neurological Disease” is the top disease in disease and biofunctions, and “Cell-To-Cell Signaling and 
Interaction, Cellular Movement, Hematological System Development and Function” is the top transcriptomic 
network (complete lists of pathways are shown in Supplementary Table 7). In addition to “Neuroinflammation 
Signaling Pathway”
, several other canonical pathways involved in inflammation and immune response were also 
altered, such as “Fcγ
 Receptor-mediated Phagocytosis in Macrophages and Monocytes” and “Role of NFAT in 
Regulation of the Immune Response”
.
MiR142 is significantly induced in the hippocampus and cortex of Tau mice. 
MiR142-3p has been 
shown to regulate neuroinflammation associated with Multiple Sclerosis29. Upregulation of both miR142-3p and 
-5p was reported in the prefrontal cortex of LOAD patients13. miR181a and miR181b are involved in alteration 
of synaptic plasticity associated with neuropathology in a murine model of AD30. Santa-Maria et al. showed that 
miR219 represses Tau synthesis at the post transcriptional level22. Thus, we prioritized miR142-3p, miR142-5p,

miR181a, miR181b, miR219-3p and miR219-5p to examine their temporal expression profiles in control and Tau 
hippocampi.
In Tau mice, Tau(P301L) is driven by CaMKIIα
-tTA and begins to express around postnatal day 728. To exam-
ine whether miR changes occurred shortly after Tau(P301L) overexpression, we performed qPCR to determine 
the temporal expression profiles of miRs in control mice without CaMKIIα
-tTA or hTau(P301L) transgenes and 
Tau hippocampi at postnatal day 15, 1 m, 2 m and 6 m (Fig. 3A). The expression of miR142-3p was induced 
at postnatal day 15 and persisted until 6 m. Thus, the upregulation pattern of miR142-3p correlates well with

the time course of Tau(P301L) overexpression (OE). The upregulation of miR142-5p, miR181b, miR219-3p and 
miR219-5p became significant at 1 m (Fig. 3A). Tau mice carry one copy of CaMKIIα
-tTA and one copy of hTau 
transgene. Previous reports have shown that CaMKIIα
-tTA mice also exhibit neurodegeneration and behavio-
ral phenotypes31,32. To determine whether a single CamKIIα
-tTA or hTau transgene OE can cause miR142-3P 
upregulation, we conducted qPCR experiments with 2 m hippocampi from CamKIIα
-tTA-only and hTau 
transgene-only mice. No significant differences in miR142-3p levels were observed between control mice con-
taining neither transgene and control mice with only one of the two transgenes, confirming that CaMKII-tTA

transgene alone has no effect on miR142-3p expression (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition to hippocampus, we 
found that miR142-3p expression is induced in Tau cortex at 2 m and 6 m (Fig. 3B). In situ hybridization (ISH) 
with anti-miR142-5p DNA probe in combination with immunostaining (IHC) using NeuN (recognizing neu-
rons) and Iba-1 (recognizing microglia) antibodies suggest that miR142 upregulation is likely to occur in both 
neurons and microglia (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Neuronal miR142 overexpression in developing cortex of wildtype brain leads to many tran-
scriptional changes. 
The early and persistent miR142 upregulation in Tau hippocampi, and its documented 
involvement in the inflammatory axis29,33–36 prompted us to examine its direct impacts on gene transcription. The 
in utero electroporation (IUE) technique is a widely used technique to deliver gene expression constructs into 
cortical neurons at late embryonic stages37,38. Here we employed IUE to introduce miR142 or control expression 
cassette into cortical neurons to assess the impact of miR142-OE on the cortical transcriptome at 1 m. Specifically, 
we electroporated miR142 together with GFP-reporter or with a tdTomato-reporter expression cassette alone 
(served as control) into the developing cortical plate of wildtype embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and 
let these embryos developed to term for birth (Fig. 4A). Using double-immunostaining with 1 m miR142-OE 
brains, we found that the majority of GFP-positive cells were also NeuN-positive (neuronal marker)39 but not 
S100β
-positive (astrocyte marker)40 (Fig. 4B). qPCR analysis revealed a modest but significant increase in miR142 
(−
5p, 1.2 fold; and −
3p, 1.4 fold) expression in the cortex prepared from miR142OE when compared with control 
cortices (Fig. 4C).
To assess transcriptome changes induced by miR142-OE in cortical neurons at 1 m, we performed mRNA 
sequencing on miR142-OE (GFP-positive) versus control (tdTomato-positive) cortices. The MDS plot 
obtained after mRNA-seq shows clear separation between miR142-OE and control samples (n = 5 per group, 
Supplementary Fig. 5). miR142-OE caused significant downregulation of 641 genes and upregulation of 501 
genes (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4D, Supplementary Table 8). The gene network and pathway analysis showed that the 
top transcriptomic network altered by miR142-OE is “Cellular Assembly and Organization, Cellular Function 
and Maintenance, Cellular Movement” (Supplementary Table 9; GSE107167). The top canonical pathways, and 
top diseases and biofunctions altered by miR142-OE were also analyzed (Supplementary Table 10). These data

provide the first in vivo demonstration that miR142-OE in cortical neurons can lead to substantial transcriptional 
changes.
Overlapping gene expression changes between miR142 and Tau overexpression. 
Comparison 
of gene changes in miR142-OE and Tau-OE, based on the mRNA-seq data presented above, revealed 11 upreg-
ulated and 22 downregulated genes common between two datasets (Fig. 5A,B; Table 1). Among the upregulated 
genes, both Gfap and Csf1 are known to play key roles in inflammation and gliosis41–43. GFAP is considered a 
marker of astrogliosis44,45 while CSF1 controls the development and functions of macrophages, such as micro-
glia46. Mutations in the Csf1r gene are associated with progressive dementia46 and inhibiting CSF1R increases 
disease severity in animal models of AD47. We validated these changes using qPCR in both miR142-OE cor-
tex (Fig. 5C) and Tau OE hippocampus (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, applying lentivirus vector carrying miR142-3p 
expressing cassette in-vitro to (DIV7) primary cortical neurons also led to Gfap and Csf1 upregulation at DIV11 
in addition to the increase of miR142-3P (Fig. 5E,F).
To assess whether miR142-OE in cortical neurons could lead to infiltration or proliferation of microglia and 
astrocytes in miR142-OE cortex, we performed immunostaining using Iba-1 and GFAP antibodies. Significant 
increases in Iba-1 positive microglia and GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes were observed in miR142-OE cortical 
regions compared to tdTomato controls (Fig. 6A–D). This observation suggests that miR142-OE in neurons could 
elicit inflammatory signals that lead to an increase in microglia and reactive astrocytes numbers.
MiR142-OE exerts similar effect as Tau-OE on biological and disease networks. 
Overlapping 
gene expression changes between miR142 and Tau OE prompted us to examine the contributory role of miR142 
to the gene networks and disease pathways caused by Tau-OE. To assess this, we compared the canonical pathways 
as well as disease and biological functions between miR142-OE and Tau-OE samples. Even though miR142-OE 
and Tau-OE models target several different genes, a high degree of directional similarity in the pathway regulation 
was observed between the two groups (Fig. 7). With respect to inflammatory pathways, the canonical pathways 
that were similarly changed include signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway and tumor 
necrosis factor receptor 2 (Tnfr2) signaling (Fig. 7A). Stat3 is a transcription factor involved in cytokine mediated

signaling pathways and its activation promotes astrogliogenesis associated with brain inflammation48. Upon TNF 
binding, Tnfr2 can activate apoptosis and inflammation49,50. Disease and biological functions also revealed similar 
and robust changes in macrophage migration, movement and phagocytosis, suggesting an increase in inflamma-
tory signals (Fig. 7B).
Discussion
Here we identified several miRs that are altered in both the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of tauopathy. 
To explore whether miR changes can result in the gene expression alterations observed in Tau-OE, we explored 
the predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRs and compared the overlap between these predicted 
targets and the mRNA changes in 2 m Tau hippocampi. Subsequent pathway analysis of the overlapping genes 
identified several important signaling pathways, with neuroinflammation as the top pathway. Using the IUE sur-
gical technique, we were able to provide the first in vivo demonstration that neuronal miR142-OE in wildtype 
cortex leads to gliosis as well as dysregulation of genes involved in several disease pathways. Many of these pro-
cesses are also altered in Tau hippocampi, such as inflammation. The upregulation of Gfap and Csf1 mRNA levels 
in miR142-OE cortex or Tau(P301L) OE hippocampi are likely to cause the increase of microglia and reactive 
astrocytes. Taken together, our data suggest that Tau-OE induces presymptomatic miR-changes and such miR 
alterations are likely to mediate alterations in gene regulatory networks, and disease and biological pathways.
Previous transcriptional analysis with mouse tauopathy models has revealed pathways in neuronal func-
tion, cell metabolism, signal transduction and stress response at symptomatic stages51,52. Here we found signif-
icant mRNA changes in Tau hippocampi as early as 2 m. Interestingly, the expression changes of genes such as 
Gfap, Csf1, Prnp, C4b and Trem2, identified with 2 m Tau hippocampi (Fig. 2; GSE107183) have been observed 
at symptomatic stages in the same rTg4510 tauopathy model in other studies52,53. These genes are involved in 
various aspects of inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration. Astrocyte reactivity, which is character-
ized by Gfap overexpression, contributes to many neurodegenerative diseases54. Meta-analysis of gene expres-
sion studies to identify common transcriptomic signatures for neurodegenerative diseases has identified Csf1 
as a common inflammatory marker55. Prnp has been implicated as a causative protein agent in tauopathies and 
many neurological disorders including AD, Parkinson’s disease, Lou Gehrig’s disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis-
ease56. Complements are known in modulating the inflammatory axis in many neurodegenerative disorders57,58. 
Dysregulated Trem2 signaling in microglia has been shown to be involved in both Tau and amyloid pathology, 
most likely by mediating microglial responses to neuroinflammation59–61.
Several predicted miR-regulated genes from our miR-RNA pairing analysis are involved in the inflammatory 
response, such as Trem2, Csf1r, Il6r, Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Gamma 
(Pik3cg)62, Ras-Related C3 Botulinum Toxin Substrate 2 (Rac2), and Tgfβ
 receptor 1/2 (Supplementary Table 6).

Aberrant expression of Rac2 has been reported in the pathogenesis of childhood pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia in a mouse model63. Enhanced Tgfβ
1 signaling following brain injury has been shown to alter immune 
function in brain pericytes by attenuating the expression of several chemokines and adhesion molecules64. 
miR-mRNA pairing analysis also revealed several miR gene targets involved in Neuroinflammation, Complement 
System, cAMP-mediated signaling, and G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling. Many complement 
proteins, including components of C1q, are important mediators of inflammatory response in several neurode-
generative disorders such as AD65,66, Parkinson’s disease67, Huntington’s disease68 and Prion diseases69. Altered 
cAMP-mediated signaling has been shown in many neurodegenerative diseases70. Many components of this 
pathway including cAMP, protein kinase, PKA and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (Creb) are 
implicated in Tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles71 as well as cognitive decline in AD72. Studies have 
explored the involvement of GPCRs in the progression of AD73. Mechanisms involved in the regulation of expres-
sion, degradation and trafficking of BACE1, a key enzyme in AD pathogenesis, by GPCRs have provided insights 
into the pathophysiology of AD as well as development of potential therapeutic modalities74.
MiR142 is an evolutionary conserved pre-miR that encodes for two separate miRs, miR142-3p and miR142-5p. 
Both miRs are co-transcribed, and share many common targets33,75. However, post-transcriptional regulation 
may account for their differential expression levels observed in our sequencing dataset (GSE106967). Several 
studies have delineated the role of miR142 in immune responses in multiple pathological conditions29,33,75–77. We 
found that miR142 (−
3p and −
5p) induction occurs soon after Tau(P301L) OE triggered by CaMKIIα
-tTA, and 
it persists through later stages. Many cytokines and inflammation associated molecules have been characterized 
as direct or indirect targets of miR142, suggesting its quintessential role in inflammatory processes33,36. miR142 
alteration has also been associated with many pathological conditions, such as cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, 
osteoarthritis and chronic fibrosis33,76,78,79. A recent study highlighted the role of miR142 in multiple sclerosis 
(MS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by immune system dysfunction. Here, we provide experimen-
tal evidence that neuronal miR142-OE in wildtype brains upregulates expression of many inflammatory genes 
accompanied by an increase of microglia and reactive astrocytes.
The miR-mediated modulation of a cohort of genes that lie upstream of signaling pathways, may lead to robust 
effects even with subtle changes in miR expression33,80–82. Similar effects were observed in our study, where mod-
est miR142 overexpression in cortical neurons resulted in widespread transcriptome changes. Interestingly, both 
miR142 OE and Tau OE induced many genes involved in inflammation, including Gfap and Csf1. This was also 
manifested in the altered regulation at the level of gene networks and pathways. Both miR142-OE and Tau-OE 
induced Stat3 and Tnfr2 signaling pathways. In addition, disease functions involved in the migration of cell types 
implicated in inflammation, including macrophages were elevated. Thus, manipulating a single miR, such as 
miR142, can lead to profound changes in biological pathways contributing to neurodegeneration. Therefore, this 
study shows that the early miR changes that can occur in tauopathies have pathological consequences. The deep

sequencing data sets acquired in our study will allow future investigation for the coupling of miR-changes with 
mRNA-changes, and an understanding of how alterations in biological pathways result in neurodegeneration.
In summary, we found many canonical and disease associated pathways that are altered at the presymptomatic 
stage of tauopathy. Many of these pathways could be altered by miR-changes as revealed by pairing of predicted 
miR targets with RNAseq-validated mRNA changes. As proof-of-concept, we show that miR142-OE in cortical 
neurons is sufficient to trigger changes in many gene network pathways, including inflammation. Several of these 
pathways are also altered in presymptomatic stages of tauopathy in Tau animal model. Thus, our data provide

the disease progression by altering several key biological pathways.
Methods
Animals. 
The generation and genotyping of rTg(TauP301L)4510 (rTg4510) mice were conducted as previ-
ously described83. rTg4510 mice over-express the P301L mutation in 4R0N human Tau associated with FTDP-
1726. To minimize this effect of heterogeneous phenotype due to genetic background, littermate controls were 
used for all the experiments. All mice were housed in standard conditions with food and water provided ad libi-
tum and maintained on a 12 hr dark/light cycle. Animals were treated in compliance with the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services and Indiana University Bloomington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
guidelines. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and were 
approved by Indiana University Bloomington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.
RNA sequencing and pathway analysis. 
Small RNA sequencing was performed by LC Sciences 
(Houston, Texas, USA). The quantity and purity of total RNAs were assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spec-
trophotometer (NanoDrop Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) at a 260/280 ratio 2.0. The integrity of total RNAs was 
analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent Tech, Santa Clara, 
CA, USA) with RNA integrity number greater than 7.0. The libraries were constructed from total RNA using 
the Illumina Truseq Small RNA Sample Preparation Protocol #15004197 Rev. F (Catalog # RS-200-9002DOC; 
Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, RNA adapters were ligated to 
target miRNAs in two separate steps. Reverse transcription reaction was applied to the ligation products to cre-
ate single stranded cDNA. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a common primer and a primer containing 
the index sequence and subsequently purified by PAGE-gel. Before sequencing, libraries were qualified on the 
Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip. Finally, Illumina sequencing technology was employed to sequence 
these prepared libraries. The raw sequences were generated using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (50 bp SE, 
rapid-run mode). After masking of the adaptor sequences and removal of contaminated reads, the clean reads 
were filtered and analyzed for miRNA prediction with the software package ACGT101-miR-v4.2 (LC Sciences, 
Houston, Texas, USA)84. The data discussed here have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus85 and 
are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE106967 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?acc=GSE106967).
Standard data analysis was performed on the deep sequencing by using a proprietary pipeline script, 
ACGT101-miR v4.2 (LC Sciences Inc.). For 2 m hippocampi, miRNA seq yielded 74,720,901 raw sequences. Of 
these, the total mappable sequences were 64,833,130. 67.8% (43,975,586 reads) reads mapped to the mouse miRs 
annotated in miRBase repository, a comprehensive database for miR sequence data86. The mappable reads to 
known mouse miRs corresponded to 1,690 miRs (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for the length distribution of mappa-
ble reads). The majority of sequences were in the range of 18–23 nucleotides, consistent with the reported length 
of metazoan miRs1. For 6 m hippocampi, sequencing of small RNA yielded 71,431,722 raw sequences. Among 
these, there were 64,337,423 mappable reads. The mappable reads to known miRs correspond to 1,743 mouse 
miRs.
mRNA sequencing was performed by Center for Medical Genomics, Indiana University School of Medicine. 
1. Library Preparation and sequencing: The concentration and quality of total RNA samples was first assessed 
using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. A RIN (RNA Integrity Number) of five or higher was required to pass the quality 
control. Then five hundred nanograms of RNA per sample were used to prepared single-indexed strand-specific 
cDNA library using TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The resulting libraries were assessed for 
its quantity and size distribution using Qubit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. One and a half pico molar pooled 
libraries were sequenced with 1.75 bp single-end configuration on NextSeq500 (Illumina) using NextSeq 500/550 
High Output Kit. A Phred quality score (Q score) was used to measure the quality of sequencing. More than 90% 
of the sequencing reads reached Q30 (99.9% base call accuracy). 2. Sequence alignment and gene counts: The 
sequencing data were first assessed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK) for quality control. 
Then all sequenced libraries were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC mm10) using STAR RNA-seq aligner87 
with the following parameter: “–outSAMmapqUnique 60”
. The reads distribution across the genome was assessed 
using bamutils (from ngsutils)88,89. Uniquely mapped sequencing reads were assigned to mm10 annotated genes 
using featureCounts (from subread)89 with the following parameters: “–s 2 –Q 10”
. Quality control of sequencing 
and mapping results was summarized using MultiQC90. Genes with read count per million (CPM) > 0.5 in more 
than 3 of the samples were retained. The data was normalized using TMM (trimmed mean of M values) method. 
Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR91,92. False discovery rate (FDR) was computed from 
p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The mRNA-seq data discussed here have been deposited 
in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus85 and are accessible through GEO Series accession numbers: GSE107183, 
GSE107167 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107167).
The multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot of the RNA samples was drawn using plotMDS function in edgeR. 
The distance represented the leading log-fold-changes between each pair of RNA samples, which is the average 
(root-mean-square) of the largest absolute log-fold changes between each pair93. This visualizes the differences 
between the expression profiles of different samples in two dimensions. Pathway analysis: Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was performed for differentially expressed genes with FDR < 0.05. 
Enrichment of Canonical Pathways and Disease and Bio Functions were identified with threshold p < 0.05. The 
activity of pathways and functions was inferred as z-scores. Positive z-score indicated increased activity, while 
negative z-score indicated inhibited activity.

The miRNA target filter in Qiagen’s IPA software was used for pairing of the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data 
sets. Differentially expressed miRNAs (P < 0.05) were uploaded into IPA and analyzed with the miRNA target 
filter, which includes experimentally validated and predicted mRNA targets from TargetScan, TarBase, miRecords 
and the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Differentially expressed mRNAs (FDR < 0.05) were then uploaded with the 
“add/replace mRNA data set” function. Using the “expression-pairing” feature, only potential targets differentially 
expressed in the mRNA-seq data are maintained; all other potential targets are filtered out. These target genes 
were then subjected to pathway analysis.
In utero electroporation (IUE) procedure. 
IUE was performed as previously described37,38. Briefly, preg-
nant ICR female dams 14.5 d postgestation were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, and a small incision was 
made in the abdominal wall to expose the uterine horns. For miR142-OE overexpression experiment, a DNA 
mixture of pCAG-mGFP (membrane targeted green fluorescent protein [GFP]; a gift from Dr. Matt Rasband), 
and miRNASelect™ pEGP-mmu-mir-142 Expression Vector (Cell Biolabs) mixed in equal amounts (1ug/ul 
each), with a final concentration of 1 μ
g/μ
l each) into the left hemisphere of ~50% of the ICR embryos. The 
remaining embryos received only tdTomato (pAAV-CAG-tdTomato (codon diversified) a gift from Edward 
Boyden (Addgene plasmid # 59462), 1 μ
g/μ
L) to serve as littermate controls. Approximately 0.5–1 μ
L of DNA 
solution was injected into the lateral ventricle of embryos (E14.5) using a pulled glass micropipette. Each embryo 
within the uterus was placed between platinum tweezer-type electrodes (5 mm diameter, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., 
Holliston, MA, USA). Square electric pulses (33–35 V, 50 ms duration, five times) were passed at 1 s intervals using 
a platinum, 3-mm-diameter tweezer-type electrodes (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) using a BTX ECM 830 
square Electroporator (Harvard Apparatus). The wall of the abdominal cavity and skin were then sutured, and the 
animals were allowed to develop to term and aged to 1 m. At 1 m old, control and miR142-OE mice were deeply 
anesthetized and decapitated to harvest brains, For RNAseq analysis, GFP- (miR142-OE) or tdTomato-positive 
(control) cortical tissues were dissected out from IUE mouse brains.
Gene expression and miR assessment. 
Total RNA was purified from cortex and hippocampus using 
the miRVana RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (part no. AM1560, ThermoFisher 
scientific, Grand Island, NY). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the 
iScript™ Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (#1725038, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Quantitative real-time reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was performed using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master 
Mix (part no. A25742, ThermoFisher scientific). The PCR reaction was run in a Quant Studio 7 Flex Real Time 
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). The gene expression was assessed using gene-specific prim-
ers. Gapdh was used as a reference control for normalization. The primer sequences were as follows: 1) mouse

The levels of gene expression in each sample were determined with the comparative Ct method using 
Quant Studio 7 Flex Real Time PCR software. For gene expression, cycling parameters were as follows: 2 min 
at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles: 15 sec at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. For miR studies, total RNA was isolated 
using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For miR quantification 
by QRT-PCR, 10 ng of total RNA were used to prepare cDNA using TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription 
Kit (part no. 4366596, Life Technologies) and TaqMan specific probes as follows: miR142-3p (#4427975; assay 
ID: 000464); miR142-5p (#4427975; assay ID: 002248); miR181b (#4427975; assay ID: 465209_mat); miR181a 
(#4427975; assay ID: 000516); miR219-3p (#4427975; assay ID: 002390); miR219-5p (#4427975; assay ID: 
000522); miR339-5p (#4427975; assay ID: 002257); miR1249 (#4427975; assay ID: 002868); U6 small nucleolar 
RNA (#4427975; assay ID: 001973). U6 was used as a reference control for normalization. Real-Time RT-PCR was 
performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (#4324018, Life Technologies). The 
QRT-PCR cycling parameters were 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles: 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. Data 
were analyzed using Quant Studio 7 Flex Real Time PCR system software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Immunofluorescence staining and image acquisitions. 
At 1 m old, control and miR142-OE mice 
manipulated via IUE were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, transcardially perfused with PBS, fol-
lowed by 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS, after which the brains were removed and postfixed over-
night in 4% PFA at 4°. The brains were serially sectioned in the coronal plane into 100 μ
m thick sections using a 
Leica VT-1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Brain slices containing comparative 
morphology were selected for immunofluorescence staining. For immunofluorescence staining, brain slices were 
washed with PBS/0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at room tem-
perature for 20 min. Next, blocking was performed for 1 h using 3% normal goat serum in PBST. Following this 
step, the cells were stained with various primary antibodies diluted in 3% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton X-100 
in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBST, and incubated with secondary antibodies 
(goat-anti rabbit/mouse/chicken IgG conjugated with Alexa 647/555/488 (1:1000 dilution in 0.2% Triton X-100 
in PBS) was used to detect primary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. Following this incubation, sections 
were washed with PBST three times for 10 min each, mounted in Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (Vector 
Labs, Burlingame, CA) and cover slipped for imaging. The primary antibodies used were: IBA1 (anti rabbit,

mouse, 1:500, Millipore MAB377, Burlington, MA); S100B (anti mouse, 1:500, Sigma AMAb91038, St. Louis, 
MO); GFP (anti chicken,1:500, Aves Labs Inc GFP-1020, Tigard, OR).
Z stack images were obtained using Leica DFC365FX Microsystems Confocal microscope with 10x/0.30 
objective. The Z-stacks were taken with 1 μ
m step between individual planes. All images were processed in Adobe 
Photoshop for brightness/contrast, orientation and background correction to better illustrate staining patterns.
Dual in situ hybridization and immunostaining. 
DIG-label in situ hybridization and immunostaining 
was performed on floating brain sections. The animals were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, and 
transcardially perfused with freshly prepared 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA, catalog no # P6148, Sigma Aldrich, 
MO, USA). Day 1: 60 µM sections were cut on Leica VT-1000 vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems, 
Bannockburn, IL) and treated with proteinase K solution (Catalog no # 3115887001, Roche, Indianapolis, IN) 
for 30 min at 37 °C. To reduce non-specific binding, acetylation step was performed by incubating the sections 
with acetylation solution (0.5% acetic anhydre (Sigma Aldrich), 1.35% triethanolamine (pH 8, Sigma Aldrich), 
0.067% HCl (Fluka Chemika, Buchs, Switzerland) in 0.1% DEPC-treated water (Sigma Aldrich). Probes (miR-
CURY LNA detection control probe U6, catalog no # 99002-15, Exiqon, Germantown, MD; miRCURY LNA 
detection probe hsa-miR-142-5p, catalog no # 38514-15, Exiqon, Germantown, MD) at a final concentration of 
30 nM were diluted in hybridization buffer (Formamide, SSC, Yeast RNA, Heparin, Denhardts solution, Tween, 
EDTA) and heat-denatured at 90 °C for 2 minutes after which it was cooled on ice. Sections were incubated O/N 
at 55 °C with the probes (300 µL) in a wet chamber humidified with 50% Formamide-5 ×
 SSC(sodium chloride, 
sodium citrate) solution. Day 2: Multiple washes were performed with 5XSSC solution, followed by blocking for 
1 h at RT with blocking solution (0.1% BSA, 1X PBS, 0.1%Tween). Next, sections were incubated with antibodies 
against DIG (Anti-Digoxigenin-AP, Fab fragments; Catalog no #11093274910, Roche, Indianapolis, IN), NeuN 
and IBA1 (1:500 dilution) for 2 nights at 4 °C. Day 3: Multiple washes with 1X PBS and 1X PBS + 0.3%Tween were 
performed at RT. Sections were incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution) 
at RT for 2 hours. Sections were washed with 0.1 M Tris 8.2 for 10 min and developed at RT till a red precipitate 
started to appear. The color reaction was stopped with 1X PBS + 0.3%Tween and sections were transferred to 1 M 
Phosphate buffer (3 ×
 5 min.) after which they were incubated for 10 minutes in 1 μ
g/ml Hoechst (Invitrogen, 
Grand Island, NY) in 1 M PB. After rinsing in PB (2 ×
 5 min.) sections were mounted with prolong gold mounting 
media for imaging.
Primary neuronal culture and lentivirus transduction. 
ICR pregnant females were deeply anesthetized 
by isoflurane inhalation, and a small incision was made in the abdominal wall to harvest their embryos for brains. 
Cortical tissue from E16.5 ICR embryonic brains was isolated and dissociated to acquire cortical neurons using 
the Worthington Papain Dissociation kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Worthington Inc.). Cortices from 
several embryonic brains were pooled for plating. Neurons were plated at 100,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate. 
Cultures were maintained in a regularly replaced Neurobasal media (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) with B27 sup-
plement (Invitrogen), penicillin-streptomycin supplement (Life Technologies) and L-glutamine (Invitrogen)94.
Neurons were incubated at 37 °C and 5% humidity. On 7th day-in-vitro (DIV7), control (VSM5954, 
Dharmacon; GE Healthcare) and MiR142-3p-OE (VSM6215-213652311, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) lentivi-
ruses were added at the titer concentration of 108 transfection units/ml. On DIV11, total RNA was extracted using 
miRVana RNA isolation kit. Two independent experiments were performed from two different pregnant females 
and each experiment was conducted with three replicates.
Data and Statistical analysis. 
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad 
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Means were compared across groups with the use of t tests for 2 groups for data 
that followed the normal distribution. Normality was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and significant 
P values were denoted by *. When the data did not follow the normal distribution, P values were computed with 
nonparametric Mann-Whitney methods, and significant p values were denoted by #. Two-tailed P values < 0.05 
were considered significant. Values are presented as means ± SEM.
