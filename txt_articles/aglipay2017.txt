IMPORTANCE Epidemiological studies support a link between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
and a higher risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections. However, whether winter
supplementation of vitamin D reduces the risk among children is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D supplementation
reduces the incidence of wintertime upper respiratory tract infections in young children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial was conducted during the
winter months between September 13, 2011, and June 30, 2015, among children aged 1
through 5 years enrolled in TARGet Kids!, a multisite primary care practice–based research
network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
INTERVENTIONS Three hundred forty-nine participants were randomized to receive 2000
IU/d of vitamin D oral supplementation (high-dose group) vs 354 participants who were
randomized to receive 400 IU/d (standard-dose group) for a minimum of 4 months between
September and May.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of laboratory-confirmed
viral upper respiratory tract infections based on parent-collected nasal swabs over the winter
months. Secondary outcomes included the number of influenza infections, noninfluenza
infections, parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses, time to first upper respiratory
tract infection, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at study termination.
RESULTS Among 703 participants who were randomized (mean age, 2.7 years, 57.7% boys),
699 (99.4%) completed the trial. The mean number of laboratory-confirmed upper
respiratory tract infections per child was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19) for the high-dose group and
1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.16) for the standard-dose group, for a between-group difference of 0.02
(95% CI, −0.17 to 0.21) per child. There was no statistically significant difference in number of
laboratory-confirmed infections between groups (incidence rate ratio [RR], 0.97; 95% CI,
0.80-1.16). There was also no significant difference in the median time to the first
laboratory-confirmed infection: 3.95 months (95% CI, 3.02-5.95 months) for the high-dose
group vs 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.66-4.14 months) for the standard-dose group, or number of
parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses between groups (625 for high-dose vs 600
for standard-dose groups, incidence RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16). At study termination, serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 48.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 46.9-50.5 ng/mL) in the high-dose
group and 36.8 ng/mL (95% CI, 35.4-38.2 ng/mL) in the standard-dose group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily administration
of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation did not reduce overall
wintertime upper respiratory tract infections. These findings do not support the routine use
of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in children for the prevention of viral upper
respiratory tract infections.

iralupperrespiratorytractinfectionsarethemostcom-
mon infectious illnesses of childhood.1 From the mid-
1980s and onward, vitamin D has received attention for
its potential to prevent disease through its role in both innate
andadaptiveimmuneresponses.2Bothobservationalandclini-
cal trial data have suggested a link between low levels of se-
rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased rates of respiratory
tract infections.3,4 In addition to the morbidity they cause, up-
per respiratory tract infections place a considerable eco-
nomic burden on health care systems and societies.5
Vitamin D increases the synthesis of the antimicrobial
peptide cathelicidin in respiratory epithelium,6 which has
been shown to reduce disease severity and replication of
the influenza virus in vitro.7 Although a number of clinical
trials have attempted to assess the effect of vitamin D supple-
mentation on the prevention of respiratory tract infections
among adults8-11 and children,12,13 conclusions have been
hampered by small sample sizes, short trial duration, and
lack of laboratory-confirmed outcomes. Likewise, a meta-
analysis of 7 clinical trials found no association between
vitamin D and childhood acute respiratory infections,
but limitations included a shortage of studies and heteroge-
neity in terms of populations and end points.14 To our knowl-
edge, only 1 trial has assessed the effect of vitamin D on
laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infections in
children specifically.12 It included 334 children in Japan and
found a significant reduction in influenza A, but not influ-
enza B, among children receiving 1200 IU/d of vitamin D
supplementation.12 It remains unclear if vitamin D supple-
mentation can prevent all-cause upper respiratory tract
infections among children.
The vitamin D Outcomes and Interventions in Toddlers
(DO IT) trial was conducted to examine the effect of high-
dose oral vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/d) vs the cur-
rentlyrecommendedsupplementaldoseforchildren(400IU/d)
over 4 to 8 winter months on all-cause laboratory-confirmed
viralupperrespiratorytractinfectionratesamongchildrenaged
1 to 5 years.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This study was a multisite pragmatic randomized clinical
superiority trial conducted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (lati-
tude 43° north). The study was designed as a parallel group
trial with a 1:1 allocation over the 2011-2015 winter seasons.
No changes to methods were made after trial commence-
ment. Ethical approval was granted by St Michael’
s Hospital
and Hospital for Sick Children Research Ethics Boards. Writ-
ten, informed consent was obtained from parents willing to
participate and provide baseline measures. Trial procedures
have been described in detail elsewhere (see Supplement 1).
Eligibleparticipantswerehealthychildrenaged1to5years.
Exclusion criteria were gestational age younger than 32 weeks
and chronic illness (other than asthma). The study took place
at 8 pediatric or family medicine group practices participat-
ing in TARGet Kids!, a primary care research network. Each site
has between 3 and 10 practicing physicians. Parents of chil-
dren scheduled for a well-child visit prior to the viral season
(September through November) each year between 2011 and
2015 were approached to participate in the study.
Randomization and Blinding
Children were randomized to receive 1 of 2 formulations: the
standard dose, 400 IU/d of vitamin D, or the high dose,
2000 IU/d. The standard dose was chosen to be consistent
with vitamin D guidelines from the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP)15 and high dose was chosen to be within the
tolerable upper vitamin D intake specified by the Institute of
Medicine.16 Children could only be randomized into the trial
during 1 winter season. Parents of participants received a
drop-based formulation in order to ease administration of the
study drug (Kids Ddrops containing Vitamin D3
17). From the
time of enrollment (September-November) until follow-up
(April-May), parents were instructed to administer 1 drop of
the provided solution to their child by mouth once each
day. Drops were identical in taste, volume, and color between
the intervention groups; they differed only in concentration
of vitamin D. Drops could be given at any time during the
day. The recruitment time window was chosen with the
knowledge that the circulation of respiratory viruses peaks
during the winter months and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels are known to stabilize within 8 weeks.18,19 The dura-
tion of the dosing regimen (4-8 months) was selected to fol-
low the routine practice of supplementing preschoolers with
vitamin D over the winter months.20-22
The randomization sequence was generated using a
computer-basedrandom-numbergeneratorbytheSickKidsre-
search pharmacy. The study biostatistician (K.T.) was un-
aware of the randomization sequence. Randomization was
stratified by practice site with blocks of size 4. The research
pharmacy prepared the vitamin D formulations in sealed, se-
rially numbered bottles identical in appearance and weight to
maintain allocation concealment. Study personnel, parents,
attending physicians, laboratory personnel, investigators, and
data analysts were all blinded to group allocation throughout
the study period. Research assistants at each site approached
participants for entry into the study.
Key Points
Question Does high-dose vitamin D supplementation
(2000 IU/d) help to prevent wintertime viral upper respiratory
tract infections compared with standard-dose vitamin D
supplementation (400 IU/d) among preschool children?
Findings In this multisite randomized clinical trial that included
703 children, the number of wintertime laboratory-confirmed
viral upper respiratory tract infections was higher in the
high-dose group than the standard-dose group, not a statistically
significant difference.
Meaning Vitamin D dosing higher than 400 IU/d may not be
indicated for preventing wintertime viral upper respiratory tract
infections in children.

 Procedures
After providing informed consent, parents completed a stan-
dardized data collection form with questions adapted from
the Canadian Community Health Survey. These included age;
sex; birth weight; enrollment date; skin pigmentation; par-
ents’race/ethnicity; maternal age, educational level, and
health status; duration of breastfeeding; bottle use; current
and past vitamin D supplementation; influenza immuniza-
tion status; physical activity; outdoor time; and sun expo-
sure. Skin pigmentation and ethnicity were captured in this
study since previous work has suggested that both factors are
related to the cutaneous production of vitamin D.23,24 Ethnic-
ity was reported by the parent using fixed categories and
skin pigmentation was assessed by trained research assis-
tants through fixed categories using the Fitzpatrick scale.25
Research assistants also recorded child height and weight
using standardized techniques described elsewhere.26
Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured
using the Roche ELECSYS Vitamin D total assay (Roche Diag-
nostics Ltd) with a functional sensitivity of 1.60 ng/mL
(to convert from ng/mL to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496)
(coefficient of variance, 18.5%) and an analytical specificity
of 100% for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
27
After receiving bottles containing the assigned formula-
tion, parents were informed that concomitant interventions
suchasover-the-countermultivitaminsthatcontainvitaminD,
over-the-counter vitamin D preparations, and prescription
vitamin D were prohibited. Throughout the winter months,
parentswereaskedtocompleteasymptomchecklist28andcol-
lect viral nasal swabs for every upper respiratory tract infec-
tion and were reminded through monthly telephone calls. Par-
ents were instructed on the proper technique for obtaining
nasal swabs, including storing swabs in the provided trans-
port media in the refrigerator until couriered within 24 hours
to the study laboratory. Nasal swabs collected by parents have
been shown to be as effective as those obtained by health pro-
fessionals in detecting respiratory viruses.29 Parents were not
required to visit their child’
s physician to report an upper re-
spiratory tract infection episode.
In the months of April and May the following year (4-8
months after randomization), participants and their parents
returned to the physician’
s office, at which point a follow-up
data collection form was completed and follow-up 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured from venous blood
samples. Parents were asked to return the bottles, and the
amount of vitamin D administered was calculated by measur-
ing the amount of remaining formulation.
The primary outcome was the number of all-cause
laboratory-confirmed viral upper respiratory tract infections
per child. This was ascertained by detecting the presence of
respiratory viruses in parent-collected nasal swabs using the
Luminex xMAP ID-Tag RVP assay system (Luminex Corp),
which tested for 18 common viruses including influenza A
and B, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, picorna-
viruses, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and para-
influenza viruses with an overall clinical sensitivity that
exceeds 92% for all targets and an overall specificity
that exceeds 97% for all targets.30 Defining respiratory infec-
tion using laboratory confirmation avoids the uncertainty
associated with symptoms and illness presentations through
parent reported measures.
Secondary outcomes included time to first laboratory-
confirmed, total parent-reported, laboratory-confirmed influ-
enza, and noninfluenza upper respiratory tract infections and
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Other secondary out-
comes not presented in this article included asthma exacer-
bations among children with asthma, physician-diagnosed oti-
tis media and pneumonia, emergency department visits, and
hospitalizations.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
It was assumed that participants would have an average of 1
laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infection per
month during the minimum 4-month winter period.31,32 Con-
sidering that the infections in children can be stressful and dis-
ruptive for families33 and that studies suggest that a reduc-
tion of infectious burden between 25% and 30% is relevant to
patients,9,34weassumedareductionof1perwinterwouldhave
clinical importance. Under these assumptions, it was esti-
mated that a sample of 300 participants per group would be
required to detect this effect with 90% power at the .05 level
of significance. This number was increased to 375 children per
group to compensate for loss to follow-up. The sample size as-
sumed a Poisson distributed outcome and was based on as-
ymptotic methods for a likelihood ratio test.35
The number of upper respiratory tract infection events
per child was summed and the mean infection rates (per
child) per group were calculated. For the primary analysis
comparing the number of laboratory-confirmed infections
per group, a negative-binomial model using the variable
length of follow-up as an offset was computed. An offset vari-
able is the length of time a participant was observed. The off-
set was used to adjust for varying lengths of participant
follow-up. The negative binomial model produces an inci-
dence rate ratio (RR), which provides a relative measure of
the effect of high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D supple-
mentation. It is derived as the number of incident infections
per season for the 2000-IU/d group divided by the number of
incident infections per season for the 400-IU/d group.
Parental-reported infections were compared using a similar
method. Time to first infection was examined using Kaplan-
Meier curves and the log-rank test. Prespecified analyses of
influenza and noninfluenza incidence were conducted using
Poisson and negative-binomial models respectively using
length of follow-up as an offset. Complete case analysis was
performed for all primary and secondary outcomes in which
only cases with available data were analyzed. Adverse events
were monitored by educating collaborating community phy-
sicians about the signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity
and asking them to report any adverse events to the study. In
addition, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and parathy-
roid hormone were measured at a follow-up study visit.
All analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat
principle. The α level was 2-sided with statistical significance
set at P = .05. All analyses were conducted using SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc) and R v 3.2.5.

 Results
Of 1397 participants screened, 703 eligible participants con-
sented to participate and were randomly assigned to receive
1 of the 2 vitamin D formulations (Figure 1). There were no
clinically important differences between the enrolled and
nonenrolled participants (eTable in Supplement 2). Three
hundred fifty-four participants (50.4%) were allocated to
receive the standard dose, and 349 participants (49.6%)
were allocated to receive the high dose. Six hundred ninety-
nine (99.4%) participants had data available for the primary
analysis; 4 (0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Fifty-five (7.9%)
discontinued treatment but completed follow-up. The mean
follow-up length and exposure duration was 6.2 months
(95% CI, 5.1-7.2 months) for the standard-dose group and 6.3
months (95% CI, 5.8-7.4 months) for the high-dose group.
All participants with primary outcome data were included in
the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 699). Four hundred sixty-
five participants (66.1%) returned bottles at the end of the
study. Among bottles returned, quantities of administered
formula were comparable between groups: the high-dose
mean formulation administered was 5.39 g (95% CI, 5.11-
5.66 g); the standard dose mean was 5.01 g (95% CI, 4.72-
5.29 g). The average proportion of the intended dose
received was also comparable between groups: the high dose
was 98% (95% CI, 93%-102%); the standard dose, 100%
(95% CI, 92%-105%).
Balance was achieved on all measured baseline character-
istics. Two hundred ninety-six participants (42.3%) were girls.
The mean age at recruitment was 2.70 years (95% CI, 2.58-2.81
years). The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level
for the high-dose group was 35.9 ng/mL (SD, 12.3 ng/mL) and
was 36.9 ng/mL (SD, 11.8 ng/mL) for the standard-dose group
(Table 1).
A total of 728 laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory
tract infections occurred throughout the study period. Eight
hundred eighty-three swabs were submitted by 415 partici-
pants; 155 of these swabs from 130 participants tested nega-
tiveforanyinfection(Table2).Intotal,322participants(46.0%)
had no laboratory-confirmed infections. The mean number of
infections per child was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.16; the median,
1; interquartile range [IQR], 0-2) for the standard-dose group
and was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91-1.19; median, 1; IQR, 0-2) for the
high-dose group, for a between-group difference of 0.02 (95%
CI, −0.17 to 0.21). In the negative binomial model, there was
no statistically significant difference in the rate of all-cause up-
per respiratory tract infections between the groups (inci-
dence RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.16; Table 2). Site-specific inci-
dence RRs were symmetrically distributed around the overall
incidence RR (eFigure in Supplement 2).
The median time to the first laboratory-confirmed upper
respiratory tract infection was 3.29 months (95% CI, 2.66-
4.14 months) for the standard-dose group and 3.95 months
(95% CI, 3.02-5.95 months) for the high-dose group. There
was no statistically significant difference in the groups with
respect to time to first laboratory-confirmed infection
(Figure 2).
Parents reported a total of 1225 respiratory tract illness
episodes, with an average of 1.91 illnesses (95% CI, 1.72-2.09)
per child (median, 2; IQR, 1-3) for the standard-dose group
and 1.97 illnesses (95% CI, 1.78-2.16) per child (median, 2;
IQR, 1-3) for the high-dose group, for a between-group differ-
ence of 0.06 (95% CI, −0.22 to 0.33) illnesses per child. There
was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of
parent-reported upper respiratory tract illnesses between
groups (incidence RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16; Table 3).
There was a statistically significant difference in serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between the groups (P < .001) at
study termination. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were
48.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 46.9-50.5 ng/mL) in the high-dose group
and 36.8 ng/mL (95% CI, 35.4-38.2 ng/mL) in the standard-
dose group. After adjusting for baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D
serum levels, the high-dose group demonstrated a 12.3 ng/mL
(95% CI, 10.3-14.3 ng/mL) increase in serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D levels compared with the standard-dose group at study
termination (Table 3). No adverse events were reported.
The prespecified comparison of the incidence of influ-
enza (influenza A and influenza B combined) revealed that
the incidence of influenza infections in the high-dose group
was reduced by 50% (incidence RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-
0.89; Table 2). However, relative to other infection types
there were few influenza infections that occurred in each
group: the number of influenza infections in the high-dose
group was 16 (4.4% of all infections) vs 31 (8.5% of all infec-
tions) in the standard-dose group (mean, 0.05; 95% CI,

viruses (all viruses except influenza, combined) (incidence
RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.83-1.23). Enterovirus or rhinovirus was
the most prevalent respiratory virus (n = 448 out of 728
swabs that tested positive for a virus). There were no clini-
cally important differences between the groups for the num-
ber of upper respiratory tract infection episodes for adenovi-
rus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza,
and respiratory syncytial virus.
Discussion
In this study involving 703 healthy children aged 1 to 5 years,
supplementation with high-dose vitamin D compared with
standard dose vitamin D did not reduce all-cause upper
respiratory tract infections during the winter season despite
a 12.3 ng/mL increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentration between groups. This conclusion remained
whether the outcome was defined as number of laboratory-
confirmed upper respiratory tract infections, time to first
upper respiratory tract infection or parent-reported upper
respiratory tract illness.

 Conclusions of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
clinical trials that have assessed the association of vitamin D
in children with respiratory infections have varied and were
limited by the variability of dosing regimens (bolus vs daily
supplementation), age ranges (preschoolers vs adults),
populations (both healthy and unhealthy participants),
types of respiratory tract infections (aggregating upper and
lower, bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections),
outcome measurement (severity, duration, number) and labo-
ratory confirmation of respiratory tract infection.3,4,14,36,37
Meta-analyses of trials have demonstrated both positive3,4
and null14,36,37 associations of vitamin D with respiratory in-
fections. However, all systematic reviews included very few
studies (<5) involving children, and only one12 of these stud-
ies examined viral upper respiratory tract infections in chil-
dren specifically.
Although the present study did not reveal a protective ef-
fect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation over a standard
dose on overall upper respiratory tract infection frequency, it
is possible that high-dose supplementation is effective in pre-
venting upper respiratory tract infections in certain subpopu-
lations. Bergman et al9 found that symptoms were signifi-
cantly reduced among participants with antibody deficiency
receiving daily 4000 IU vitamin D3 vs placebo. Several groups
have suggested a link between vitamin D and asthma exacer-
bations among children.38,39 Asthma exacerbations are known
to be associated with upper respiratory tract infections sug-
gesting a possibly protective effect of vitamin D among chil-
dren with asthma.40
The secondary finding that vitamin D may be associated
with a lower risk of influenza is limited in its interpretation
given the small number of influenza infections and should be

 more formally examined in future studies. Furthermore, the
reduction in influenza infections was less than the minimal
clinically important difference of 1 infection per winter sea-
son. However, this finding is consistent with the only other
randomized clinical trial that investigated vitamin D supple-
mentation on laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract
infection in children. Urashima et al12 investigated the effect
of 1200 IU/d of vitamin D supplementation vs placebo on
the incidence of seasonal influenza A and B among children
aged 6 to 15 years. They found that vitamin D supplementa-
tion reduced the incidence of influenza A but not the inci-
dence of influenza B. In the present study, although the
incidence was statistically reduced in the high-dose group,
the difference in the mean number of influenza infections
per child between groups was minimal (0.05 infections per
season in the high-dose group vs 0.09 infections per season
in the standard-dose group). Investigation of vitamin D
supplementation for prevention of influenza infection in
populations or seasons during which influenza is epidemic
would be necessary to evaluate these findings.
The study has a number of strengths including testing
the currently recommended American Academy of Ped-
iatrics15 standard dose of vitamin D against the safe upper limit
as recommended by the Institute of Medicine.16 Also, it
was a trial designed to mimic the routine practice of supple-
menting children with daily vitamin D in the wintertime as
recommended by many practitioners and performed in house-
holds across North America.41 Also, the use of laboratory-
confirmed upper respiratory tract infection as the primary
outcome is well-defined and unbiased. Furthermore, the
trial was conducted across multiple sites including both
family physician and primary care pediatric physicians sug-
gesting generalizability across primary care settings, and it was
conducted over 5 winter seasons, capturing yearly variation
in upper respiratory tract infection frequency.
There are several limitations to this study. First, al-
though parents are as capable as clinicians in administering
nasal swabs,29 children may have had upper respiratory
tract infections without swabs being submitted. Because
daily monitoring of infections was not feasible, monthly
contact with each family revealed a similar null effect of
vitamin D on parent-reported upper respiratory tract ill-
nesses. Second, this study was also not able to make com-
parisons to a placebo group; this was prohibited by the
research ethics board due to the American Academy of
Pediatrics suggested dose of 400 IU/d.16 It is possible that
400 IU/daily may have been sufficient for a protective effect
against infections. Third, like other national studies of chil-
dren, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels at the end
of the summer were relatively high42 and this could have
contributed to the lack of effect of high-dose vitamin D
supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation may provide
greater benefit among children with lower baseline serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.8 Previous work in healthy
adults has suggested that a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentra-
tion of 30 ng/mL is sufficient to reduce the incidence of
upper respiratory tract infections.43 Fourth, the sample size
calculation was powered to detect a reduction of 1 infection
per season assuming 1 infection per month, but the data
demonstrated that children experienced on average 1
laboratory-confirmed upper respiratory tract infection per
season. Preliminary calculations using a Poisson distribu-
tion showed that fewer infections per season required even
smaller sample sizes; thus, the study was powered to detect
differences in the primary outcome.44
Conclusions
Among healthy children aged 1 to 5 years, daily admin-
istration of 2000 IU compared with 400 IU of vitamin D
supplementation did not reduce overall wintertime upper
respiratory tract infections. These findings do not support
the routine use of high-dose vitamin D supplementation
in children for the prevention of viral upper respiratory
tract infections.
