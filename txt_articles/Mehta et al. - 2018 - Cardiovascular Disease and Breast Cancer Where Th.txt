ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of 
mortality in women, yet many people perceive breast cancer to be the 
number one threat to women’s health. CVD and breast cancer have several 
overlapping risk factors, such as obesity and smoking. Additionally, current 
breast cancer treatments can have a negative impact on cardiovascular 
health (eg, left ventricular dysfunction, accelerated CVD), and for women 
with pre-existing CVD, this might influence cancer treatment decisions by 
both the patient and the provider. Improvements in early detection and 
treatment of breast cancer have led to an increasing number of breast 
cancer survivors who are at risk of long-term cardiac complications from 
cancer treatments. For older women, CVD poses a greater mortality threat 
than breast cancer itself. This is the first scientific statement from the 
American Heart Association on CVD and breast cancer. This document will 
provide a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of these diseases, 
shared risk factors, the cardiotoxic effects of therapy, and the prevention 
and treatment of CVD in breast cancer patients.
T
he number one cause of mortality in US women is cardiovascular disease 
(CVD),1 yet the general public awareness of this remains suboptimal despite 
large-scale public education campaigns. Awareness is particularly low in ra-
cial and ethnic minority communities.2,3 CVD and breast cancer have individually 
received significant publicity with media campaigns (such as the Red Dress and 
Pink Ribbon campaigns); however, there is inadequate public awareness of the 
coexistence of common risk factors associated with these 2 conditions.
Although cardiology and oncology are often considered separate medical 
fields, they are frequently intertwined. Multidisciplinary care is critical in the man-
agement of cancer patients. Cancer outcomes can be influenced by cardiovas-
cular health: antecedent cardiovascular health can affect cancer treatment se-
lection, and furthermore, cancer care can result in cardiovascular toxicities that 
could impact ongoing cancer treatment. Finally, latent effects of CVD from cancer 
treatment can alter cancer survivorship. Much of the intersection between CVD 
and breast cancer pertains to similarities in predisposing risk factors such as age, 
tobacco use, diet, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. CVD risk factors are increased in 
long-term cancer survivors; however, discussion of CVD prevention and modifica-
tion of these risk factors during and after cancer treatment is limited.4 The risk of 
CVD (heart failure [HF], myocardial ischemia, hypertension) is high, and develop-
ment of CVD risk factors (obesity and dyslipidemia) is higher in older breast can-
cer survivors than the risk of tumor recurrence. In addition, with advancements

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
in cancer care, survivors could develop latent cardiac 
effects secondary to the cancer treatment, which can 
include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted 
therapy (eg, trastuzumab).5–7
The field of cardio-oncology has emerged in re-
sponse to the need to provide the best cancer care 
without compromising cardiovascular health. Soci-
etal committees and new organizations have rapidly 
emerged to address patients’ needs, including clinical 
care, research, and education.8,9 Recent societal pub-
lications include a consensus statement regarding the 
training of future cardio-oncologists and guidelines 
regarding the monitoring and prevention of left ven-
tricular (LV) dysfunction in adult cancer survivors.10,11 
Hospitals have been developing and marketing col-
laborative cardio-oncologic programs to meet rising 
clinical demands in the field. Lack of formal clinical 
training programs, funding, and cardiovascular guide-
lines are some of the unmet needs that will need to 
be addressed over time to further advance CVD care 
of cancer patients.8 This scientific statement is the 
American Heart Association’s first on the connection 
between CVD and breast cancer. It aims to provide 
a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of these 
diseases, shared risk factors, and the cardiotoxic ef-
fects of cancer therapy, as well as review the preven-
tion and treatment of CVD in breast cancer patients. 
Although treatment of cardiotoxicity is not within the 
scope of this statement, it is clearly an important aspect 
of cardio-oncology, and it too warrants further research 
and guideline development.
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
CVD and breast cancer are significant causes of mor-
bidity and mortality in the United States. CVD affects 
≈47.8 million women,1 and breast cancer affects ≈3.32 
million women.12 On the basis of 2014 Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention attributable mortality data 
in women, 1 in 3.3 deaths was attributed to CVD and 
1 in 8.3 deaths was attributed to coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD), whereas 1 in 31.5 deaths was attributed 
to breast cancer.1 Mortality rates for CVD and breast 
cancer have decreased, with an average decline in 
CVD deaths (both sexes) by 6.7% per year from 2004 
to 2014 and in female breast cancer deaths by 1.8% 
per year from 2005 to 2014.1,12 Direct annual medical 
costs in the United States are high: ≈$272.5 billion for 
CVD, $124.57 billion for all cancers, and $16.5 billion 
for breast cancer; moreover, these costs are expected to 
continue to rise.13,14
The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in 
women is ≈12.4% based on 2012 to 2014 data. The 
rate of new female breast cancer cases was 124.9 per 
100 000 women per year, with a death rate of 21.2 
per 100 000 women per year.12 Nearly 90% of breast 
cancer patients survive at least 5 years after their ini-
tial diagnosis.12 Currently, there are ≈3 million breast 
cancer survivors in the United States15; however, older 
women are more likely to die of diseases other than 
breast cancer, and CVD is the most frequent cause.16,17 
In older, postmenopausal women, the risk of mortality 
attributable to CVD is higher in breast cancer survivors 
than in women without a history of breast cancer. This 
greater risk manifests itself ≈7 years after the diag-
nosis of breast cancer, which highlights the need to 
reduce the additional burden of CVD during this time 
frame with early recognition and treatment of CVD 
risk factors.18
Influence of Race and Age
Age-adjusted death rates are higher for CHD and 
stroke than for breast cancer in non-Hispanic white and 
black females; however, when race was examined, the 
rates of CHD, stroke, and breast cancer were higher in 
non-Hispanic black women than in non-Hispanic white 
women and Hispanic women (Figure 1).1 There are sim-
ilar racial-ethnic differences concerning the incidence 
and mortality rates of breast cancer, with non-Hispanic 
black women having the highest mortality.5 Non-His-
panic white women 60 to 84 years of age have a higher 
incidence of breast cancer than black women; howev-
er, in black women, the incidence of breast cancer is 
higher in those <45 years of age, and the mortality rate 
for breast cancer is higher at all ages.19 Furthermore, 
American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian/
Pacific Islander women have lower breast cancer inci-
dence and mortality rates than non-Hispanic white and 
non-Hispanic black women. Additionally, compared 
with non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic and non-
Hispanic black women are more likely to present with 
later stages of breast cancer,20 which in turn can have a 
negative impact on clinical outcomes.
The improved success of screening and treating 
breast cancer has contributed to the growing number 
of survivors, more than half of whom are >65 years 
of age.21 The prognosis of older breast cancer patients 
is affected by the effective management of preexist-
ing comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus 
and hypertension.22 In older women diagnosed with 
breast cancer, CVD is the leading cause of mortality, 
and breast cancer is the second most common cause.23 
Not surprisingly, comorbidities, including CVD, in older 
breast cancer patients have been associated with de-
creased overall survival.24 The identification and man-
agement of cardiovascular risk factors23 in this popula-
tion is important because CVD, if not recognized and 
treated, can pose a greater health risk than the cancer 
itself.22 The expanding role of primary care physicians, 
oncologists, cardiologists, and allied healthcare provid-
ers in survivorship programs is essential to optimize the

in breast cancer treatment.25–28
COMMON RISK FACTORS
Breast cancer and CVD share a number of common 
risk factors (Figure 2). Cardiovascular clinical care and 
research have focused on risk factors for >60 years, be-
cause it is believed that ≈80% of CVD can be prevented 
through risk factor modifications such as promoting a 
healthy diet, physical activity, and a healthy weight; 
abstinence from tobacco; blood pressure control; dia-
betes mellitus management; and a good lipid profile.32 
Adherence to a larger number of ideal cardiovascular 
health behaviors or factors from the American Heart 
Association’s Life’s Simple 7 health campaign1 is associ-
ated with a trend toward a lower incidence of breast 
cancer (P for trend=0.11).33 The Cardiovascular Lifetime 
Risk Polling Project, involving 18 cohort studies, found 
that at age 45 years, individuals with optimal risk fac-
tor profiles have a significantly lower lifetime risk of 
CVD events than those with even 1 major risk factor 
(4.1% versus 20.2% among women). Having ≥2 risk 
factors further increased lifetime CVD risk to 30.7% 
in these women.34 Aggressive management of these 
cardiovascular risk factors can also substantially reduce 
the lifetime risk of developing cancer.35 Risk factors for 
breast cancer have only been discussed more recently, 
but there is growing awareness that through risk fac-
tor modification, some cases of breast cancer might be 
prevented.36,37
Dietary Patterns
Studies of the association between dietary patterns, 
CVD, and breast cancer typically compare a prudent or 
healthy dietary pattern (high in vegetables and fruits, 
poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains) 
with the Western diet or so-called unhealthy diet (red 
or processed meats, refined grains, sweets, and high-
fat dairy products).38 The American Heart Association’s 
2020 Impact Goals include a definition of cardiovas-
cular health with a healthy diet pattern that is appro-
priate in energy balance and consistent with a Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension–type eating plan.39 
Dietary habits also affect multiple established cardiovas-
cular risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol 
levels, glucose levels, and obesity.32,40 The NHS (Nurses’ 
Health Study) found that a dietary pattern consisting 
of higher intake of vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, and 
whole grains (prudent diet) was associated with a 28% 
lower cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR], 0.72; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60–0.87), whereas a 
dietary pattern consisting of higher intake of processed 
or red meats, refined grains, and sweets (Western diet) 
was associated with a 22% higher cardiovascular mor-
tality (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01–1.48).41
In contrast, epidemiological data regarding dietary 
patterns are less consistent in breast cancer. Some 
reports support prudent dietary patterns as being in-
versely associated with risk of breast cancer,42–45 where-
as others found no association.46–48 The link between 
breast cancer and a healthy or prudent diet might de-

pend on the tumor type.49 Among 86 
261 women in 
the NHS, a diet high in fruits and vegetables, such as 
one represented by the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension diet score, was associated with a lower 
risk of estrogen receptor (ER)–negative breast cancer. 
Furthermore, a diet high in plant protein and fat and 
moderate in carbohydrate content was associated with 
a lower risk of ER-negative breast cancer.36
Studies of the link between the Western diet and 
breast cancer have shown positive,50 negative,51 or no 
associations.46 The relationship between the frequency 
of consumption of energy-dense foods and fast foods 
and breast cancer risk was examined in black and white 
women. Higher consumption of energy-dense foods 
and fast foods was associated with increased breast 
cancer risk in both racial groups, with some differences 
by menopausal and ER status of the tumor.52 The posi-
tive association with frequency of fast food intake was 
stronger among premenopausal black women and post-
menopausal white women, for whom a positive trend 
was also observed with frequent intake of energy-dense 
foods and sugary drinks. Adjustment for total energy in-
take attenuated odds ratios (ORs) in black women but 
strengthened risk estimates in white women. The West-
ern dietary pattern was associated with higher breast 
cancer risk (OR, for top versus bottom quartile, 1.46; 
95% CI, 1.06–2.01), especially in premenopausal wom-
en (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.14–2.67).53
Dietary Fat
Dietary fat is one of the most intensively studied dietary 
factors related to breast cancer and CVD risk; however, 
epidemiological studies are difficult to interpret because 
of the heterogeneity in fat composition. Studies investi-
gating animal and saturated fats, polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids, and trans 
fatty acids have reported that different types of fats 
differentially affect breast cancer development. Of the 
subtypes of dietary fat, n-3 PUFA is among the most 
studied. The Japan Collaborative Cohort Study reported 
an inverse association between n-3 PUFA intake and 
breast cancer risk.54 Several case-control studies have 
found that n-3 PUFA, measured as either dietary intake 
or with tissue biomarkers, is inversely associated with 
breast cancer risk.55,56 Other observational studies have 
found no association between n-3 PUFA and breast 
cancer risk.57–60 A more recent meta-analysis found that 
marine n-3 PUFA was associated with a 14% reduction 
of risk of breast cancer (RR for highest compared with 
lowest category, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94), and the RR 
remained similar whether marine n-3 PUFA was mea-
sured as dietary intake or as tissue biomarkers.61
In the WHI (Women’s Health Initiative) dietary modi-
fication clinical trial of 48 
835 women, reduction of 
total fat consumption from 37.8% of energy at base-
line to 24.3% at 1 year and 28.8% at 6 years had no 
effect on incidence of major CHD (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 
0.88–1.09) or total CVD (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.05) 
over a mean of 8 years.62 The WHI dietary modifica-
tion trial of a low-fat, high fruit and vegetable diet also 
failed to provide a definitive answer as to whether fat 
intake modifies breast cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–1.01 for intervention versus control 
group after 8 years of follow-up).63 Another random-
ized trial of reduced fat intake and increased carbohy-
drate intake in women who were followed for 10 years 
found no effect of fat intake but an increased risk of 
ER-positive breast cancer with lower carbohydrate in-
take.64 In a 20-year follow-up of the NHS, there was no 
association between fats and breast cancer risk, even 
when subtypes of fats were considered.65 However, the 
RR for breast cancer in premenopausal women in the 
NHS was 1.35 in the highest quartile of dietary fat in-
take compared with the lowest quartile (OR, 1.35; 95% 
CI, 1.00, 1.81).66
Blood plasma lipid levels are influenced by diet and 
weight as well and have been associated with breast

cancer risk. In a cohort of 4670 women with increased 
mammographic density, higher levels of serum high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipopro-
tein A1 were associated with increased risk of develop-
ing breast cancer (23% and 28%, respectively), whereas 
higher levels of non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B were 
associated with a lower risk of developing breast cancer 
(19% and 22%, respectively), when compared with the 
reference group.67 These results demonstrated a pos-
sible link between lipids and breast cancer risk, specifi-
cally in women with increased mammographic density. 
The impact of cardiovascular risk reduction strategies 
on HDL-C and on breast cancer risk needs further study.
Alcohol Consumption
Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have shown 
both beneficial and detrimental associations between 
alcohol intake and all-cause mortality in women, which 
is a function of the level of consumption and age.68 Ob-
servational data from 34 cohort studies demonstrated 
an association of moderate alcohol intake with reduced 
all-cause mortality, and in this report, alcohol intake of 
5 g/d (a standard alcoholic drink contains 14 g of alco-
hol) was associated with an 18% reduction in all-cause 
mortality.69 However, the relationship between alcohol 
consumption and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is com-
plex. In the NHS, light to moderate alcohol consumption 
(5 g/d) was associated with a lower risk of total stroke 
than for nondrinkers (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.92).70 
Several meta-analyses of observational studies show 
evidence for a cardioprotective association of average 
alcohol intake on IHD risk.71,72 More recently, a system-
atic review of 44 observational studies found that in 
women, a steep J-curve was observed for IHD mortality 
and morbidity, with the lowest risk shown at 11 g of al-
cohol per day and no cardioprotection at 14 g/d.73 Data 
from 8 prospective studies revealed an inverse relation-
ship between alcohol intake and CHD. There was a sig-
nificantly lower risk of CHD among women (mean age, 
50 years) with an alcohol intake of up to 30 g/d (RR, 
0.58; 95% CI, 0.49–0.68) compared with nondrinkers; 
however, higher levels of daily alcohol intake did not 
confer additional CVD benefit.74 However, no beneficial 
effect on IHD was seen with episodic and chronic heavy 
alcohol drinking.75
Although low to moderate intake of alcohol might 
decrease the risk for CHD, there are no cancer-related 
benefits of modest drinking.35 Alcohol consumption 
is a well-established, modifiable risk factor for breast 
cancer.76,77 There is considerable variability on how al-
cohol intake is defined, and this makes direct compari-
sons between studies difficult. Epidemiological studies, 
including the WHI,78 support the positive relationship 
between alcohol and breast cancer risk.79–82 Meta-anal-
yses suggest a 5% to 9% increase in risk per drink per 
day, or ≤12.5 g/d.83–87 Consuming ≥2 alcoholic drinks 
per day for 5 years is associated with an 82% increased 
breast cancer risk compared with no alcohol intake.88 
In the NHSII (Nurses’ Health Study II), the risk of breast 
cancer was 34% higher (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00–1.80) 
among women 24 to 44 years of age with alcohol in-
take of ≥15 g/d (≈1.5 drinks per day) compared with 
women who abstained from alcohol before first preg-
nancy.89 There was a dose-response relationship be-
tween alcohol intake before first pregnancy and breast 
cancer risk, with an RR of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.00–1.23) 
for each additional 10-g/d intake; there was no such 
relationship for alcohol consumption and breast cancer 
after the first pregnancy. Furthermore, in the NHS, the 
risk of breast cancer was increased by 21% in adult 
binge drinkers compared with nondrinkers after con-
trolling for cumulative alcohol intake.82
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with many 
subtypes defined by hormone receptor status and his-
tological type. The elevated levels of intracellular estro-
gens resulting from alcohol intake might act through 
the ER to promote breast cancer.76 Epidemiological stud-
ies have shown that the relationship between alcohol 
intake and hormone receptor–positive breast tumors 
was stronger than with other types of breast cancer.85 
Compared with never-drinkers, HRs for postmenopaus-
al women who consumed ≥7 drinks per week were as 
follows: for ER-positive breast cancer, 1.48 (95% CI, 
1.19–1.83); for progesterone receptor (PR)–positive 
cancer, 1.64 (95% CI 1.31–2.06); and for mixed/ductal/
lobular cancer, 2.51 (95% CI, 1.20–5.24).90 The risks 
for ER-positive/PR-positive and ER-positive/PR-negative 
breast cancer increased by 8% (95% CI, 2%–15%) and 
12% (95% CI, 0%–25%), respectively, per drink per 
day among postmenopausal women,91 which is compa-
rable to the 12% increase in risk of ER-positive tumors 
per 10 g/d of alcohol intake reported in a meta-analysis 
of prospective and case-control studies.85
Meat Consumption
The association between meat consumption and breast 
cancer is not well understood. Among a large cohort of 
women in the United Kingdom, increased consumption 
of total and nonprocessed meat was associated with a 
higher risk of premenopausal breast cancer, and total 
processed meat and red meat consumption was posi-
tively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer.92 
A case-control study found that processed meat intake, 
even just 1 or 2 times per week, was associated with 
a 2.7-fold (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.36–5.14; P=0.004) 
higher likelihood of developing breast cancer, but red, 
white, and grilled meat intake was not.93 A study of 
4684 French women found that processed meat in-
take was associated with higher breast cancer risk (HR, 
1.45; 95% CI, 0.92–2.27), and this association was 
stronger when cooked ham was excluded and mani-
fested only in women who were not taking antioxidant

supplements.94 Among the 44 
231 participants of the 
NHSII cohort, greater consumption of red meat in ado-
lescence was significantly associated with higher pre-
menopausal breast cancer risk (highest versus lowest 
quintiles: RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.94) but not post-
menopausal breast cancer.95 Others have found weak 
positive associations between meat consumption and 
breast cancer.96,97 Several studies have linked red and 
processed meat intake with increased mortality98 and 
acute coronary events.99
Collectively, the evidence for the influence of diet 
on breast cancer and CVD risk is mixed. The results of 
epidemiological studies must be interpreted cautious-
ly, because these studies cannot determine causation. 
The sample size, measurement error in nutrients and in 
outcome variables, and individual variation in human 
genetics and lifestyle factors limit the ability to mea-
sure the effect of diet on breast cancer.100 This is largely 
because of uncontrolled confounding factors and dif-
ferences in study designs and measurement of end 
points. It appears that dietary factors are particularly 
important in determining premenopausal breast cancer 
risk. Likewise, there is increasing evidence to suggest 
the importance of alcohol consumption in the devel-
opment of breast cancer. Understanding the impact of 
diet on breast cancer risk will require examination of 
gene-environment interactions and long-term epigen-
etic mechanisms. Some promising work has found that 
gut microbiota is less diverse and compositionally dif-
ferent in postmenopausal women with breast cancer 
than in similar women without breast cancer.101 Breast 
cancer risk can be affected by obscure early-life effects 
that are transmitted through the maternal line.102 It is 
plausible that the infant’s gut microbiota composition 
could influence breast cancer risk in adulthood.
Physical Activity
About 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical ac-
tivity per week is recommended for all Americans.103 
Only 17.6% of American women meet these physical 
activity guidelines.32 Strong evidence supports the el-
evated risk that inactivity (<150 min/wk) poses for both 
CVD and breast cancer.32,104 Globally, physical inactivity 
is believed to be responsible for 12.2% of the burden 
of myocardial infarction after accounting for other CVD 
risk factors including cigarette smoking, hypertension, 
obesity, dyslipidemia, alcohol, and psychosocial fac-
tors.105 A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies of wom-
en found that the RRs of incident CHD were 0.83 (95% 
CI, 0.69–0.99), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64–0.92), 0.72 (95% 
CI, 0.59–0.87), and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.41–0.79) across in-
creasing quintiles of physical activity compared with the 
lowest quintile.106 Women in the CARDIA study (Coro-
nary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) who 
maintained high physical activity through young adult-
hood gained about 6 fewer kilograms of weight and 
about 3.8 fewer centimeters in waist circumference in 
middle age than those with lower activity.107 Similarly, 
among US women, every additional daily hour of tele-
vision watching was associated with 0.3 lb of greater 
weight gain every 4 years, whereas every hour per day 
of less television watching was associated with a similar 
amount of relative weight loss.108 A study of >1 million 
women followed up over 9 years found that moderate 
physical activity but not strenuous physical activity was 
associated with lower risk of CHD or a cardiovascular 
event.109 Conversely, in a population-based study in 
Australia, among adults followed up for 6 years and re-
porting any moderate to vigorous physical activity, the 
proportion of vigorous activity showed an inverse dose-
response relationship with all-cause mortality compared 
with those reporting no vigorous activity.110
Studies have consistently shown that moderate to 
vigorous physical activity is associated with a decreased 
breast cancer risk among both premenopausal and post-
menopausal women who are more active versus those 
who are less active.111 Several mechanisms have been 
proposed for how physical activity potentially reduces 
breast cancer risk, including reduced exposure to estro-
gen and androgens, insulin-related factors, adipokines, 
and inflammation.112,113 A meta-analysis of 29 obser-
vational studies found a significant reduction in breast 
cancer risk among the most physically active compared 
with the least active women.114 A more recent meta-
analysis of 22 studies involving 123 
574 participants 
found an inverse relationship between physical activ-
ity and breast cancer events and deaths.115 Compared 
with those who reported low or no lifetime recreational 
prediagnosis physical activity, those who reported high 
lifetime recreational physical activity had a significantly 
lower risk of breast cancer–related death (HR, 0.73; 
95% CI, 0.54–0.98). Additionally, significant risk reduc-
tion for breast cancer–related death was demonstrated 
in women who had engaged in recreational physical 
activity more recently before diagnosis (HR, 0.84; 95% 
CI, 0.73–0.97). In NHSII, data showed that physical ac-
tivity at ages 14 to 17 years was associated with a 15% 
lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer.116
Sedentary Lifestyle
Sedentary behavior is defined as activities performed in 
a sitting or reclining posture with an energy expendi-
ture typically in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 times the basal 
metabolic rate.117 Sedentary behavior is also character-
ized by prolonged sitting or lying down and absence 
of whole-body movement, such as watching television 
or other forms of screen-based entertainment and car 
driving.118,119 Previous research suggests that sedentary 
behavior has been associated with CVD and breast 
cancer.120,121 In the WHI observational study involving

pared with <5 hours each day was associated with in-
creased CVD risk (HR, 1.18) in multivariable models that 
included physical activity. Low physical activity was also 
linked with higher CVD risk.122
Sedentary behavior has also been associated with 
high breast density, which has been shown to be a 
strong, independent risk factor for breast cancer, with 
a 4- to 6-fold increased risk compared with the least 
dense breasts.123,124 A case-control study found that for 
women in the highest quartile of physical activity com-
pared with those in the lowest quartile, time spent in 
moderate to vigorous activity (measured by accelerom-
eter) was inversely associated with risk of developing 
breast cancer after adjustment for known risk factors, 
sedentary behavior, and time spent wearing the accel-
erometer. They also found that sedentary behavior was 
positively associated with breast cancer, independent of 
moderate to vigorous activity (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.27–
0.56; Ptrend<0.001).125 In the Southern Community Co-
hort Study, sedentary behavior for ≥12 h/d compared 
with <5.5 h/d was associated with increased odds of 
breast cancer among white women (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 
1.01–3.70) but not black women (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.82–1.83) after adjustment for physical activity (mea-
sured as metabolic equivalent hours per day).126 The ra-
cial differences noted in this study might be explained 
by variation in determining physical activity and under-
lying biological mechanisms that impact breast cancer 
risk. Independent of one another, sedentary behavior 
and physical inactivity are risk factors for breast can-
cer among white women. Reducing sedentary behavior 
and increasing physical activity are potentially indepen-
dent targets for breast cancer prevention interventions.
Obesity, Overweight, and Body  
Mass Index
Overweight and obesity (body mass index [BMI] of ≥25 
and ≥30 kg/m2, respectively) are major risk factors for 
CVD127; furthermore lifetime obesity and physical inac-
tivity increase the risk of CVD. Severe obesity (class III, 
body mass index ≥40 kg/m2) may pose an even greater 
CVD risk than class I or class II obesity.128 Among women 
in the WHI (n=156 
775) with severe obesity compared 
with normal BMI, HRs (95% CIs) for mortality were on 
the order of 1.5 to 2.6 across black, Hispanic, and white 
women. For CHD, HRs were 2- to nearly 3-fold higher. 
However, CHD risk was strongly related to CVD risk fac-
tors across BMI categories even in severe obesity, and 
CHD incidence was similar by race/ethnicity when ad-
justed for differences in BMI and CVD risk factors.128 A 
meta-analysis of white adults over a mean follow-up of 
10 years reported that among women, overweight and 
obese status (and perhaps underweight) based on BMI 
correlated with elevated all-cause death.129
Obesity is also a factor that is associated with breast 
cancer risk specifically in postmenopausal women.130,131 
The relationship between obesity and breast cancer is 
complex. A dose-response meta-analysis found that 
each 5-kg increase in adult weight gain was associated 
with an 11% increased risk of postmenopausal breast 
cancer among nonusers of hormone replacement ther-
apy (HRT; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08–1.13); there was no 
evidence of a linear relationship for premenopausal 
breast cancer (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95–1.03).132 Fur-
thermore, higher BMI (overweight-to-obese category) 
among women at age 18 years was associated with 
a 24% lower risk of breast cancer in premenopausal 
women compared with low BMI (95% CI, 0.60, 0.96, 
Ptrend=0.09).133 A BMI in the morbidly obese category, 
compared with normal- to low-weight BMI, was associ-
ated with a 19% reduced breast cancer risk (95% CI, 
0.61–1.06; Ptrend=0.05) in premenopausal women. A 
meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies of pre-
menopausal women found an inverse relationship be-
tween BMI and breast cancer risk. There was a 5% re-
duced risk for developing premenopausal breast cancer 
with a 5-kg/m2 increase in BMI.134 Stratified by ethnicity, 
the inverse association remained for black (RR, 0.95; 
95% CI, 0.91–0.98) and white women (RR, 0.93; 95% 
CI, 0.91–0.95) but not for Asian women. However, for 
waist-hip ratio, the dose response showed a statistically 
significant increase in RR of 8% for each 0.1 increment, 
with the largest association detected in Asian women 
(19%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15–1.24).134
Investigators of the NHS and NHSII observed that 
childhood and adolescent body fatness was signifi-
cantly associated with a 20% to 50% decreased breast 
cancer risk throughout life, regardless of menopausal 
status.135 More recently, investigators of the NHS evalu-
ated the link between recent weight change and total 
premenopausal and postmenopausal invasive breast 
cancer and hormone receptor status subtypes while 
controlling for average BMI before and after meno-
pause.136 Short-term weight change was significantly 
associated with breast cancer risk (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 
1.09–1.33) for a 4-year weight gain of ≥15 lb versus 
no change (≤15 lb). The association was stronger for 
premenopausal women (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.13–1.69) 
than for postmenopausal women (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 
0.97–1.25). Premenopausal short-term weight gain 
had a stronger association for ER-positive/PR-negative 
(RR per 25-lb weight gain, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.33–3.61) 
and ER-negative/PR-negative breast cancer (RR per 25-
lb weight gain, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09–2.38) than for ER-
positive/PR-positive breast cancer (RR per 25-lb weight 
gain, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.89–1.43). This study supported 
the deleterious effects of short-term weight gain, par-
ticularly before menopause, even after controlling for 
average BMI before and after menopause.136 Regardless 
of levels of adolescent physical activity, early-life body

leanness of 74 
723 women in the NHSII was significant-
ly associated with higher breast cancer risk; the asso-
ciation was slightly attenuated among those who were 
active during adolescence compared with those who 
were inactive.137 Increased breast cancer risk among 
postmenopausal women who had adolescent leanness 
was confined to those who gained excess weight dur-
ing adulthood.138
Tobacco Use
Although cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for 
CVD and stroke, the link between cigarette smoking 
and breast cancer remains inconclusive. A meta-analy-
sis comparing pooled data of ≈2.4 million smokers and 
nonsmokers found that the RR for smokers compared 
with nonsmokers for developing CHD was 25% higher 
in women than in men (95% CI, 1.12–1.39).139 The as-
sociation between smoking and breast cancer risk has 
been evaluated extensively in epidemiological studies, 
with an emerging consensus for a weak, positive as-
sociation.140 One large Canadian study found a non-
significant trend toward increased breast cancer risk in 
premenopausal women who were active smokers or 
began smoking before their first pregnancy.141 More-
over, several studies reported an increased breast can-
cer risk associated with smoking for long durations and 
initiation early in life.142–146 The association between 
passive or sidestream smoke and breast cancer is also 
mixed. Some reports have found an association,147,148 
whereas others have not.149 Genetic variants in en-
zymes involved in the metabolisms of carcinogens are 
postulated to modify the association between smoking 
and breast cancer risk.150,151 More recent meta-analyses 
report a significant interaction between smoking and 
carcinogen-metabolizing genotype variants (eg, NAT2); 
smokers carrying the slow acetylator variant NAT2 
genotypes had an increased breast cancer risk,152 and 
among women with high pack-years of smoking expo-
sure, the NAT2 slow acetylator variant genotypes were 
associated with an increased breast cancer risk.153
Age
The incidence of breast cancer increases with advanc-
ing age, doubling approximately every 10 years until 
menopause is reached, at which time the rate of in-
crease slows.154 The incidence of CVD increases steadily 
with advancing age, but the rate of increase becomes 
steeper at menopause, rather than slowing.155 Age is 
obviously not changeable, so its role in prevention is as 
a risk predictor rather than a modifiable risk factor.
Age at Menarche and Menopause
In addition to age in general, age of menarche and 
menopause is an additional age-related risk factor 
for both breast cancer and CVD. Women who start 
menstruating earlier in life (early menarche) have an 
increased risk of developing breast cancer.154 These 
women also have a higher risk for developing CVD, 
particularly in nonsmoking populations.156,157 In terms 
of menopause, women who undergo menopause ear-
lier in life (early menopause) have an increased risk of 
developing CVD158 but a decreased risk of developing 
breast cancer. Women undergoing menopause after 
the age of 55 years are twice as likely to develop breast 
cancer as women who undergo menopause before the 
age of 45.154
Postmenopausal HRT
Several studies have shown an association between 
postmenopausal hormone use and risk of breast cancer. 
The NHS study followed >100 
000 healthy women 30 
to 50 years of age at the time of enrollment and found 
that the risk of developing breast cancer was 1.2 to 2 
times greater for women who reported ≥5 years of cur-
rent use of HRTs than for those who never used HRT.159 
Long-term cumulative follow-up data of postmeno-
pausal women with hysterectomy from the WHI dem-
onstrated a 45% lower risk of breast cancer–related 
mortality in those randomized to estrogen-only therapy 
than in those given placebo. However, postmenopausal 
women with an intact uterus who were randomized to 
combination therapy of estrogen plus progestin had a 
44% increase in breast cancer mortality compared with 
those in the placebo arm, although this result did not 
meet statistical significance.160
Several studies have now also reported that HRT is 
associated with an increased risk of CVD in older post-
menopausal women and women with CHD.161,162 The 
largest of these studies is the WHI, which random-
ized >16 
000 postmenopausal women (average age 
63.3±7.1 years) with no history of coronary artery dis-
ease to receive either estrogen alone, estrogen com-
bined with progesterone, or placebo and then followed 
them for an average of 5.6 years. The estrogen plus 
progestin arm was prematurely terminated (after 5.2 
years of follow-up), and at the time of study discon-
tinuation, there was an increased risk of CHD with HRT 
(HR, 1.29; nominal 95% CI, 1.02–1.63).162 These data 
confirm that postmenopausal HRT is associated with 
both breast cancer and CVD (stroke, thromboembolic 
events, CHD), and this is a potentially modifiable risk 
factor for both diseases.159,162,163
Genetics
Clinical and population-based studies have demon-
strated that genetic factors play important roles in both 
breast cancer and CVD, and genes involved in the de-
velopment of breast cancer and CVD have been iden-

tified. Two breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 
and BRCA2) are thought to account for between 5% 
and 10% of all breast cancer cases.164 Genetics plays 
a role in therapies as well. Therapies have been devel-
oped to target genes shown to be important in pro-
gression of breast cancer, such as the HER2 (c-erbB-2) 
oncogene.165 These discoveries have greatly enhanced 
our ability to detect and treat breast cancer. Although 
genes involved in the development of CVD have also 
been identified,166–168 we have not been able to identify 
a single gene responsible for a substantial proportion 
of cases, such as with the relationship of BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 to breast cancer. Animal studies have demon-
strated an important role of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 
genes in cardiac injury responses and an increased sus-
ceptibility of mice harboring the cardiomyocyte-specif-
ic BRCA mutation to develop HF after anthracycline ex-
posure.169 However, human studies in women who are 
BRCA mutation carriers did not identify a higher risk of 
myocardial dysfunction after breast cancer treatment 
with doxorubicin.170
Although most of the risk factors that are common 
to both CVD and breast cancer move risk in the same 
direction (ie, decrease or increase risk in both diseas-
es), a few risk factors move risk in opposite directions 
(Figure 3). Decreased risk for developing CVD but in-
creased risk for developing breast cancer was associ-
ated with low to moderate alcohol intake, whereas 
increased risk for CVD but decreased risk for breast 
cancer was associated with early menopause and 
premenopausal obesity. Knowledge and understand-
ing of the risk factors for CVD and breast cancer will 
contribute to a better understanding of how best to 
prevent both diseases.
CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF 
CANCER THERAPY
Cancer treatment can result in early or delayed car-
diotoxicity that can vary from LV dysfunction to overt 
HF, hypertension, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, 
valvular disease, thromboembolic disease, pulmonary 
hypertension, and pericarditis. The most commonly re-
ported and monitored side effect of chemotherapy is 
LV systolic dysfunction.171 Arrhythmias, independent of 
other concurrent cardiac disease, can occur from breast 
cancer treatment, including chemotherapy and radia-
tion therapy (RT).172 Several chemotherapeutic agents 
can also prolong QT intervals.173 The absence of a clear 
consensus in definitions of cardiotoxicity makes it dif-
ficult to compare results of cardiac end points between 
clinical trials and furthermore makes the applicability of 
these findings in the real world challenging at best. This 
section will briefly review the pathophysiological mech-
anisms and resultant adverse cardiovascular effects of 
common therapies for breast cancer (Table 1).
Chemotherapeutic Agents
Anthracyclines
Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, have been used 
successfully in the treatment of various neoplasms such 
as breast cancer since the 1970s, but their use can result

in significant irreversible LV dysfunction. Doxorubicin in-
teracts with DNA, intercalating and inhibiting macro-
molecular biosynthesis and inhibiting the progression 
of the topoisomerase IIβ within cardiac myocytes. By 
intercalating into the DNA, the anthracyclines bind to 
topoisomerase IIβ and disrupt replication, causing myo-
cyte cell death.174,175 Another central mechanism that 
has been postulated is the generation of reactive oxy-
gen species, which damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, 
including the mitochondrial membrane, and accelerate 
myocyte death.176 Anthracyclines also form complexes 
with intracellular iron, which in turn generate oxygen 
radicals. Interestingly, individuals with higher iron stores 
exhibit increased anthracycline toxicity.177
The myocardial toxicity of the anthracyclines can 
manifest early or late after exposure. The early mani-
festations could be related to inflammation resulting in 
a pericarditis-myocarditis syndrome,178 whereas the late 
manifestations are related to actual myocyte damage 
that results in the clinical syndrome of HF. Cell death 
has been confirmed by rising troponin levels.179 The risk 
of HF increases with increasing cumulative doses of an-
thracyclines; for instance, with doxorubicin, there is an 
≈5% risk at a dose of 400 mg/m2, a 26% risk at a dose 
of 550 mg/m2, and up to a 48% risk at a cumulative 
dose of 700 mg/m2.
However, there is no “safe dose” threshold, because 
individuals exposed to lower doses of anthracycline 
(<400 mg/m2), particularly those with underlying car-
diovascular risk factors, are also at risk of experiencing 
cardiotoxicity.180–182 Most at risk for anthracycline-medi-
ated cardiotoxicity are older patients, those with a prior 
cardiac pathology, and those who have been exposed 
to concomitant chemotherapy or RT (Table 2).11,183–185 
Detailed cardiovascular phenotyping has suggested 
that on average, there are modest but persistent de-
clines in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≈4% even at 3 
years after anthracycline exposure.186 LV functional re-
covery and reduction in cardiac events might be pos-
sible with early detection and prompt treatment of LV 
dysfunction; however, complete LVEF recovery was not 
seen in patients treated >6 months after completion of 
chemotherapy.187
Doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for breast 
cancer has been found to cause arrhythmias and con-
duction abnormalities in 2.6% of patients versus 1% of 
patients who did not receive doxorubicin.188 Anthracy-
clines are associated with atrial fibrillation (2%–10%), 
which can occur acutely during or after chemothera-
py.189 An individualized patient-centered approach to 
decisions regarding the use of antithrombotic agents in 
the management of atrial fibrillation is recommended, 
with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of 
treatment.171,190 Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular 
fibrillation are less likely to be associated with anthracy-
cline treatment.189 The burden of arrhythmias detected 
on defibrillators in patients with anthracycline-induced 
cardiomyopathy is similar to those with other forms of 
cardiomyopathy (non-anthracycline chemotherapy or 
IHD), with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia as the 
most common arrhythmia, followed by atrial fibrillation 
and then sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular 
fibrillation.191 A small study of long-term survivors with 
childhood cancers treated with anthracyclines, especial-
ly with concomitant chest radiation, found that prior 
anthracycline therapy was associated with a prolonged 
corrected QT interval of 0.43 or higher, but no torsade 
de pointes was documented.188
Structural analogues of doxorubicin, such as epiru-
bicin (commonly used in Europe and Canada), were 
suggested to have lower clinical cardiotoxicity than 
doxorubicin (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.2–0.78).192 However, 
a recent Cochrane database review of 5 randomized 
trials (1036 patients) comparing doxorubicin and epiru-
bicin did not find a statistically significant difference in 
HF incidence between the 2 regimens (RR, 0.36; 95% 
CI, 0.12–1.11),193 and therefore, epirubicin should not 
be perceived as cardioprotective or less cardiotoxic.
Alkylating Agents
Alkylating agents, including cisplatin and cyclophos-
phamide, can also damage DNA, resulting in cytotoxici-
ty and myocyte death. Histopathology shows interstitial 
hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis. Cyclophosphamide 
has been the alkylating agent most commonly used 
in the treatment of breast cancer. Clinical cardiotoxic-
ity with cyclophosphamide is extremely rare, can oc-
cur within 10 days of administration, and appears to 
be related to prior anthracycline therapy or mediastinal

radiation.194–196 Myocarditis and pericarditis have also 
been described but are rare.197,198 Bradycardia, supra-
ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation have also 
been reported in patients receiving systemic alkylating 
agents.171,189,199–201
Taxanes
Taxanes, such as paclitaxel, act as microtubule poisons 
and block mitotic cycle progression by affecting mi-
crotubule processes and producing abnormal spindles 
and by disrupting mitosis, which results in apoptosis.202 
Taxanes are important agents in the treatment of early 
and advanced breast cancer. Taxanes can be given se-
quentially or in combination with anthracyclines in ear-
ly-stage breast cancer. Sequencing of taxanes alters the 
pharmacokinetics of anthracyclines but is not known to 
directly result in HF.203
Administration of paclitaxel has been associated with 
bradycardia; 29% of patients in the phase II paclitaxel 
clinical trials experienced heart rates <40 bpm.204 Oth-
er rhythm disturbances noted in patients with rhythm 
monitoring were asymptomatic left bundle-branch 
block and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which 
was also noted when paclitaxel was combined with 
cisplatin. It is unclear whether the rhythm disturbances 
observed with paclitaxel might have been caused by 
the formulation vehicle, polyethoxylated castor oil, or 
premedication with H1 and H2 antagonists to prevent 
hypersensitivity reactions.204
Antimetabolite Drugs
The antimetabolite drugs, in particular 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) and capecitabine (a prodrug that is enzymati-
cally converted to fluorouracil in the tumor), are py-
rimidine analogues that disrupt DNA and RNA synthe-
sis.205 These agents have been used as first-line therapy 
(capecitabine alone or intravenous 5-FU in combina-
tion with other cytotoxic agents) for metastatic breast 
cancer and in combination with anthracyclines (5-FU, 
epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) in early-stage breast 
cancer. The most commonly described cardiac side ef-
fect is chest pain; however, myocardial infarction, HF, 
and arrhythmias have been reported, albeit rarely.206–208 
Mechanisms that have been attributed to the chest pain 
include thrombosis or coronary arterial vasospasm.209 
These symptoms usually resolve by stopping the drug 
infusion.210,211 Patients without coronary artery disease 
can also develop ischemia but at a much lower inci-
dence than in those with pretreatment coronary artery 
disease (1.1% versus 4.5%).212 Cardiotoxicity incidence 
varies in the literature, ranging between 1% and 68% 
with 5-FU, and can occur early after treatment because 
of high, continuous-infusion doses, which is rare in the 
treatment of breast cancer.206–208,212–215 Cardiotoxicity 
(vasospasm) with 5-FU can occur in the acute setting 
(during intravenous infusion) or can be delayed (2–5 
days after administration). Long-term cardiotoxicity 
with 5-FU is uncommon.216 Other reported risk factors 
for cardiotoxicity with 5-FU include previous mediasti-
nal RT, antecedent history of CVD, and concurrent use 
of combination chemotherapeutic agents.206,212,215 Ar-
rhythmias induced by 5-FU and capecitabine, including 
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, are 
mostly ischemic in origin and usually occur in the con-
text of coronary artery spasm; however, there are also 
reported cases of atrial fibrillation, atrial/ventricular ec-
topy, and QT prolongation.217–221
Endocrine Therapy
Endocrine therapy has an important role in the treat-
ment of patients with breast cancer expressing ER or 
PR. In early-stage hormone receptor–positive breast 
cancer, use of adjuvant tamoxifen or aromatase in-
hibitors (AIs) reduces cancer recurrence rates, improves 
overall survival, and is recommended by the current 
clinical practice guidelines.222 Hormonal therapies act 
by interrupting the cellular processes through which 
estrogen promotes growth of normal and cancerous 
tissue, and importantly, the differences in their molecu-
lar targets determines their cardiovascular and overall 
side-effect profile. Two main strategies are interference 
with estrogen signaling by competitive binding to ER, 
represented by tamoxifen, and inhibition of endog-
enous estrogen production, as in the case of AIs. In the 
adjuvant setting, endocrine therapy is prescribed for an 
extended period, often ≥5 years, which emphasizes the 
importance of detailed evaluation of its overall toxicity 
and cardiovascular side-effect profile. Tamoxifen is the 
endocrine therapy of choice for premenopausal wom-
en, whereas strategies in postmenopausal women can 
include tamoxifen, AIs, or a sequential combination, 
with careful weighing of benefits and management of 
toxicity risks.222
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen, a hormonal agent approved for treatment 
of early breast cancer >30 years ago, is a selective ER 
modulator that interferes with estrogen binding to ER 
and in turn alters the expression of genes downstream 
from ER.223 The effects of the selective ER modulator/ER 
nuclear receptor transcription complex on gene tran-
scription are determined by the presence and preferen-
tial binding of corepressors and coactivators in different 
tissues and account for their tissue-specific estrogen 
agonist and estrogen antagonist actions. In breast tis-
sue, tamoxifen exhibits estrogen antagonist activity, 
and the competitive binding of tamoxifen to ER leads 
to the inhibition of estrogen-dependent tumor growth. 
ER antagonism is also the mechanism of some adverse 
effects of tamoxifen, including hot flashes and mood 
disturbances. However, in most organs, including the 
cardiovascular system, bone, and uterus, tamoxifen has

estrogen agonistic activity, which can result in benefi-
cial or detrimental effects, depending on the affected 
tissue. Tamoxifen has a favorable effect on the lipid 
profile, with reductions in total serum cholesterol (in 
the range of 10% to 15%) and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (reductions ranging from 15% to 22%), but 
no significant changes in HDL-C.224–227 Smaller studies 
reported increases in triglyceride levels in Asian patients 
treated with tamoxifen and raised concerns about hy-
pertriglyceridemia,228,229 but the broader clinical rel-
evance of these findings remains unknown.
Despite observed favorable effects and the reductions 
in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total choles-
terol levels, long-term data from clinical trials have failed 
to demonstrate a protective effect of tamoxifen with re-
gard to hard cardiovascular end points. In the Early Breast 
Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group overview,230 which 
included 55 trials and 37 
000 women, there was no dif-
ference in cardiac or vascular death between adjuvant 
and placebo groups. This was similar to the findings in 
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project 
B14,231 which reported only a small number of cardiac 
or vascular deaths, with no statistically significant dif-
ference between tamoxifen and placebo groups. These 
results indicate the need for cautious interpretation of 
surrogate end points, such as lipid profile, which did not 
translate into a clinically relevant benefit of prevention 
of CVD death. Interesting comparisons have been made 
between findings in tamoxifen trials and the WHI study, 
which used HRT in postmenopausal women. Despite 
the lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and 
the increasing of HDL-C levels (but also increased triglyc-
eride levels) in the WHI, HRT did not confer cardiovascu-
lar protection.162,232
In contrast to its protective effects on lipid metabo-
lism, the estrogen-agonistic actions of tamoxifen re-
sult in a detrimental increase in thrombogenicity and 
increased risk of venous thrombosis and thromboem-
bolism.233 Later studies that compared AI to tamoxi-
fen demonstrated a reduced risk of thrombosis with 
AIs, presumably because of their lack of proestrogen 
effects. A meta-analysis of randomized adjuvant en-
docrine trials reported the incidence of thrombosis at 
2.8% in the tamoxifen group compared with 1.6% in 
the AI group.234 Venous thromboembolism is associated 
with mortality and significant morbidity related to deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and long-
term sequelae such as pulmonary hypertension, which 
highlights the need to consider other risk factors (eg, 
history of stroke) when selecting endocrine therapy for 
women with ER-positive breast cancer.235
Aromatase Inhibitors
AIs act by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme and deplet-
ing estrogen levels in postmenopausal women. Circu-
lating estrogen is made in peripheral tissues from the 
conversion of androstenedione to estradiol via the en-
zyme aromatase in postmenopausal women.236 The 3 
AIs currently in clinical use (anastrozole, letrozole, and 
exemestane) are third-generation agents characterized 
by high specificity and suppression of the aromatase 
enzyme, and their side-effect profiles mostly reflect the 
effects of estrogen depletion.237 AIs are recommended 
either as primary therapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxi-
fen therapy (total duration, 5 years) in postmenopausal 
women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, 
to lower the risk of breast cancer recurrence.222 This 
recommendation is based on randomized controlled 
trials that continue to demonstrate reduced cancer re-
currence rates and disease-free survival in postmeno-
pausal women treated with AIs compared with tamoxi-
fen.222,238–240 AIs have also been shown to be effective 
for primary prevention of breast cancer in high-risk 
postmenopausal women.241
Because AIs deplete endogenous estrogen produc-
tion, it has been hypothesized that they might increase 
the risk of CVD, and most large adjuvant trials that have 
compared AIs to tamoxifen have included cardiovascu-
lar end points. Only a few large studies assessed hyper-
cholesterolemia, and these yielded inconclusive results. 
The ATAC trial (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Com-
bination)242 and the BIG (Breast International Group) 
I-98 trial239 reported a higher incidence of hypercholes-
terolemia with anastrozole and letrozole, respectively, 
than with tamoxifen, whereas the MA.17 trial did not 
find significant differences with letrozole.243 However, 
a meta-analysis of adjuvant AI trials that accounted for 
the duration of AI treatment and differences in treat-
ment approach demonstrated that longer duration of 
AI use was associated with a statistically significant 2.3-
fold increase in the OR for hypercholesterolemia com-
pared with tamoxifen.234 The effect was most apparent 
when upfront AI use was compared with tamoxifen 
and least evident when switching from tamoxifen to AI 
was compared with tamoxifen.
In the same meta-analyses of adjuvant trials, a similar 
pattern of risk for CVD was observed: longer durations 
of AI use were associated with increased risk for CVD 
compared with tamoxifen use, with the effect being the 
strongest in the trials that evaluated upfront AIs versus 
upfront tamoxifen.234 In a pooled analysis, the OR for 
development of CVD with the use of AI compared with 
tamoxifen was 1.26 (CI=1.10–1.43; P<0.001), with an 
increase in absolute risk of 0.8% (4.2% versus 3.4% 
risk, respectively). Despite the small absolute risk, the 
clinical relevance of these findings could be high in spe-
cific populations at risk. In the ATAC trial, for example, 
in women with preexisting heart disease, the incidence 
of cardiovascular events was 17% in the anastrozole 
arm compared with 10% in the tamoxifen arm, which 
led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label

zole be considered in this group of patients.244 Various 
adverse CVD effects have been demonstrated in trials 
comparing AI with tamoxifen245; however, a random-
ized controlled trial comparing AI and placebo after 5 
years of tamoxifen did not demonstrate any difference 
in CVD end points in early-stage breast cancer.246
The results of population-based studies that inves-
tigated cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal wom-
en treated with AIs versus tamoxifen have also been 
mixed,247,248 but large studies have traditionally been 
limited by a lack of information about cardiovascular 
risk factors and medications.247 A recent analysis of 
13 
273 postmenopausal women with endocrine-posi-
tive breast cancer in the Kaiser Permanente managed 
care system showed no association between AI use 
and risk of ischemia and stroke. Patients receiving AIs 
had a significantly higher risk of other forms of CVD 
(dysrhythmia, valvular dysfunction, pericarditis, HF, or 
cardiomyopathy), the significance of which requires 
further investigation.249 In a recent meta-analysis of AIs 
and tamoxifen in the adjuvant and extended adjuvant 
setting, significant CVD risk reduction was seen in pa-
tients treated with tamoxifen compared with placebo 
or no treatment in the adjuvant setting, and in the ex-
tended adjuvant setting, there was not an increased 
risk with AIs compared with placebo. These data sug-
gest that the increased risk of cardiovascular effects of 
AIs compared with tamoxifen in randomized controlled 
trials might be secondary to the cardioprotective effects 
seen with tamoxifen.250
Ovarian Suppression Therapy
Premenopausal women with stage II or stage III breast 
cancers who would ordinarily be advised to receive 
adjuvant chemotherapy should receive ovarian sup-
pression in addition to endocrine therapy.251 In clini-
cal studies, ovarian suppression was associated with a 
substantial increase in menopausal symptoms, sexual 
dysfunction, and diminished quality of life compared 
with tamoxifen alone but not cardiovascular specific 
side effects, which likely reflects the younger age and 
overall low cardiovascular risk profile of these patients. 
Longer follow-up will be needed to assess the effect of 
early menopause on cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and 
mortality in these patients.
HER2-Targeted Therapies
Monoclonal Antibodies
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are the 2 current FDA-
approved monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the signal-
ing of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2). LV dysfunction associated with targeted therapies 
has been most extensively evaluated in the breast can-
cer population treated with trastuzumab.252 Trastu-
zumab binds to the extracellular domain of the ErbB2 
(erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2)/HER2 and leads to 
reduced ErbB2 signaling via several mechanisms. It 
has been speculated that the cardiac dysfunction as-
sociated with trastuzumab is a direct consequence 
of ErbB2 inhibition in cardiomyocytes.253 In contrast 
to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab 
exposure can result in LV dysfunction and HF that is 
mostly reversible.254 At highest risk for cardiotoxic-
ity from trastuzumab exposure are those >50 years of 
age, patients with underlying heart disease or hyper-
tension, those with baseline LVEF between 50% and 
55% or lower, and those who have also received an-
thracycline therapy (Table 2).183,255 The introduction of 
adjuvant trastuzumab (with chemotherapy) for patients 
with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer has re-
duced the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 50% and 
mortality by 33%.256 However, in the 5 major adjuvant 
trastuzumab trials,257–260 symptomatic, severe HF or 
cardiac events, with an incidence ranging from 0% to 
3.9%, were observed with the addition of trastuzumab 
to traditional chemotherapy.261–263 Long-term follow-up 
data (median 8 years) after adjuvant chemotherapy in 
the international, multicenter, open-label, randomized 
HERA trial (HERceptin Adjuvant) of 5102 women dem-
onstrated low overall cardiotoxicity, with a greater cu-
mulative incidence of cardiotoxicity (4.1% versus 7.2% 
with New York Heart Association functional class I or II 
and significant drop in LVEF ≥10 points with absolute 
LVEF <50%) and no additional benefit in those treated 
with 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab therapy.259 
Population-based studies, particularly in older individu-
als (women >65 years old), have suggested higher rates 
of cardiotoxicity. In a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results program–based analysis of 9535 women 
(median age, 71 years) with early-stage breast cancer, 
of whom 2203 (23.1%) received trastuzumab, the rate 
of HF was 29.4% compared with 18.9% in nonusers 
of trastuzumab (P<0.001). Older age (age >80 years; 
HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16–2.10), coronary artery disease 
(HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.34–2.48), hypertension (HR, 1.24; 
95% CI, 1.02–1.50), and weekly trastuzumab admin-
istration (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05–1.68) increased the 
risk of HF.264
Current clinical trials in early breast cancer are taking 
advantage of the role of dual HER2 blockade, including 
the synergistic activity of pertuzumab and trastuzumab. 
Two neoadjuvant studies (NeoSphere and TRYPHAENA) 
demonstrated higher pathological complete response 
rates in women with HER2-positive breast cancer 
treated with chemotherapy and dual HER2 blockade 
(pertuzumab, trastuzumab) than in those treated with 
chemotherapy and trastuzumab therapy alone. In the 
TRYPHAENA study, the primary end point of cardiac 
safety was met, with a low incidence of symptomatic 
and asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction across all 
arms.265 To date, there have not been any additional

cardiac safety concerns when those agents were com-
bined.266,267 In a recently published large, prospective, 
randomized trial (APHINITY trial) exploring trastuzumab 
with or without pertuzumab with adjuvant chemo-
therapy in the treatment of women with early-stage 
HER2-positive breast cancer, there was a low incidence 
of HF (0.7% in the pertuzumab group versus 0.3% in 
the placebo group, with HF defined as New York Heart 
Association functional class III or IV and a significant 
drop in LVEF ≥10 points with absolute LVEF <50%) and 
cardiac death (2 cardiac deaths in each arm).268
Small-Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
An alternative approach to inhibit HER2-mediated sig-
naling is the use of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhib-
itors that target the HER2 intracellular kinase domain. 
Lapatinib is a reversible small-molecule tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor that is frequently administered in combination 
with capecitabine or with endocrine therapy and is ap-
proved for the treatment of women with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer.269,270 A phase III trial compar-
ing lapatinib monotherapy versus combination therapy 
with trastuzumab demonstrated a 4.5-month survival 
advantage with combination therapy but also reported 
a higher incidence of serious adverse cardiac events of 
systolic dysfunction with combination therapy (6.7% 
versus 2%).271 Subsequently, the ALTTO trial (Adjuvant 
Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization) 
of 8381 women with early-stage breast cancer dem-
onstrated no significant improvement in disease-free 
survival with adjuvant treatment that included lapatinib 
compared with trastuzumab monotherapy. Those treat-
ed with lapatinib experienced more noncardiac side ef-
fects (diarrhea, cutaneous rash, and hepatic toxicity); 
however, in all treatment arms, the incidence of car-
diotoxicity was low (2%–3% for HF, 2%–5% for any 
cardiac event).272
Emerging Therapies
Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors are being 
developed to overcome endocrine resistance based on 
cross talk between ER pathways. CDK 4/6 is a group of 
serine/threonine kinases that accomplish their action by 
forming a complex with cyclin D. In turn, this complex 
phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein and deacti-
vates it, which results in gene transcription and progres-
sion of cell replication in the transition between the G1 
and S process.273–275 In cancer, CDK 4/6 are upregulated 
and participate in tumor growth by blocking tumor 
suppression and apoptosis. Blocking the formation of 
CDK 4/6 cyclin D complex causes cell cycle arrest.276,277
The CDK 4/6 inhibitors that have been evaluated in 
the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer 
are palbociclib, ribociclib (both approved by the FDA), 
and abemaciclib (pending approval by the FDA). All of 
these agents have been tested in phase II and III clinical 
trials and are administered in combination with endo-
crine therapy (eg, AI, fulvestrant). The clinical benefit 
of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of women with 
metastatic breast cancer is beyond the scope of this re-
view. The most common adverse events reported with 
these agents are bone marrow suppression (neutrope-
nia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), fatigue, vomiting, 
and diarrhea.277,278 Ribociclib is the only oral CDK 4/6 
inhibitor for which there are cardiovascular concerns: 
prolongation of the corrected QT interval was seen 
in ≈9% of patients at doses of 600 mg/d (current ap-
proved dose in clinical practice) and in ≈33% at doses 
of >600 mg/d.279,280 This has led to the product label 
stipulating that ribociclib should be initiated only when 
the corrected QT interval is <450 ms and that electro-
cardiograms must be performed at baseline, on day 
14, before starting cycle 2 (day 28), and then as clini-
cally indicated.281 Healthcare professionals and patients 
should be educated about the importance of avoiding 
concomitant use of other drugs that could further pro-
long the QT interval.
Radiation Therapy
The biological mechanisms of RT cardiotoxicity remain 
incompletely understood but are most likely secondary 
to alterations in multiple pathways, including myocyte 
ischemia/injury, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, 
and microvascular dysfunction. Animal models of RT 
cardiotoxicity indicate that an inflammatory response 
is elicited within cardiac and endothelial cells, with 
increased adhesion molecule and cytokine activity.282 
RT also results in increased reactive oxygen species in 
cardiac tissues.283 In the rodent heart, radiation causes 
microvascular endothelial damage, which leads to lym-
phocyte adhesion and extravasation. This is followed 
by thrombus formation and capillary loss. Progressive 
reduction in capillary patency eventually results in isch-
emia, myocardial cell death, and fibrosis. In vitro and in 
vivo studies demonstrate that RT has significant effects 
on the macrovasculature and microvasculature, causing 
myocardial ischemia and injury.284 In large blood vessels, 
such as the coronary and carotid arteries, RT causes in-
flammation and oxidative damage, which, in the pres-
ence of high cholesterol, leads to lipid peroxidation and 
the formation of foam cells that initiate the athero-
sclerotic process. RT results in accelerated atheroscle-
rosis, with thickened and fibrotic media/adventitia.285 
Myocyte fibrosis is a consequence of ischemia and has 
been observed in cardiac histopathological studies in 
animals with RT.285 Intriguing, emerging data suggest a 
cardioprotective role for mast cells in cardiac RT injury, 
through the kallikrein-kinin pathway.286–288

ity that results in increased morbidity and mortality,

which limits the critical gains in cancer control and sur-
vival.289–291 Cardiovascular effects secondary to coronary 
atherosclerosis and accelerated endothelial injury can 
occur as early as 5 years after exposure among breast 
cancer survivors who receive left-sided thoracic RT, and 
persistence of risk remains for up to 30 years.292 In addi-
tion to macrovascular disease, patients can also develop 
microvascular dysfunction that results clinically in im-
paired coronary flow reserve, myocardial ischemia, and 
myocardial fibrosis.292 A recent population-based case-
control study demonstrated an increased risk in HF with 
preserved ejection fraction among women treated with 
contemporary breast cancer RT, which correlated with 
mean cardiac radiation dose.293 RT also increases the 
risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.294 Acute 
and chronic pericarditis, valvular regurgitation and ste-
nosis, and conduction abnormalities and sudden death 
are also well described, especially with chest radiation 
doses >30 Gy.295 Autonomic dysfunction is an underre-
ported cardiovascular effect of RT that has an increased 
prevalence with higher radiation doses, and the associ-
ated impaired heart rate recovery significantly affects 
all-cause mortality.296
In a study of 2168 women with breast cancer, each 
1-Gy increase in mean heart radiation dose was associ-
ated with a 7.4% increase in coronary events.5 In a me-
ta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collab-
orative Group of >23 
000 women, there was an excess 
of non–breast cancer deaths after 5 years among pa-
tients receiving RT, principally attributable to CVD and 
lung cancer.297 Multiple epidemiological studies support 
these results.6,298,299 Mortality ratios defined by laterality 
of breast cancer in 558 
871 women from the National 
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results program suggest that left-sided breast cancer 
patients treated with RT have a 1.19 to 1.90 increased 
risk of CVD mortality compared with those with right-
sided breast cancer.299 Although some studies suggest 
that the CVD risks might be decreasing over time giv-
en improvements in treatment techniques, there is an 
important need for long-term data, particularly in the 
era of proton therapy.6 However, even with the use of 
modern techniques, including computed tomography 
planning and deep inspiration breath hold, incidental 
irradiation to smaller volumes of the heart results in car-
diac perfusion defects.300–302
MONITORING FOR CARDIOVASCULAR 
TOXICITY
Early Identification of Risk
LVEF obtained by echocardiography, multigated acquisi-
tion scan, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
is used to identify patients with cardiotoxicity; however, 
a change in LVEF could constitute a late manifestation 
of myocardial damage and might represent irreversible 
cardiac damage, thus emphasizing the need to predict 
cardiac damage before its occurrence. In addition, the 
limited accuracy and variability of 2-dimensional echo-
cardiography (on the order of 10% in non–core labo-
ratory quantitation settings) for LVEF assessment,303 
coupled with a lack of consensus of what constitutes a 
clinically significant reduction in cardiac function, sug-
gest a critical need for a consensus for diagnostic and 
prognostic strategies. The variability in LVEF assessment 
can be of the same magnitude used to define cardio-
toxicity in some settings. Furthermore, serial LVEF moni-
toring, although accepted, has never been validated in 
terms of outcomes. It is noteworthy that the sensitiv-
ity of 2-dimensional echocardiography for detection of 
small changes in LV function is low and is affected by 
changes in loading conditions associated with chemo-
therapy, which can then affect the LVEF value. As such, 
the development of strategies for early detection of car-
diotoxicity has been the focus of more recent research 
efforts. In the clinical setting, these strategies thus far 
have fallen largely into 3 main categories: myocardial 
strain imaging, cardiac biomarkers, or a combination of 
imaging and biomarkers.
Myocardial Strain Imaging for Risk 
Identification
Speckle-tracking echocardiography for detection of LV 
myocardial strain is a newer cardiac imaging technique. 
It measures LV regional and global deformation in re-
sponse to force as a marker of contractility and elastic-
ity. Change in LV strain measures precedes change in 
LVEF,304 and strain has been shown to be a predictor of 
cardiac dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy.305
One study showed that an absolute longitudinal 
strain value of ≤17.2% obtained 6 months after an-
thracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) therapy was pre-
dictive of abnormal longitudinal strain at 1-year follow-
up, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80%.306 
Strain alterations were associated with higher doses of 
anthracyclines, although within the dose range consid-
ered to have an acceptable toxicity profile. Global lon-
gitudinal strain has also been shown to be an early pre-
dictor of subsequent LV systolic dysfunction in patients 
treated with trastuzumab.307 Studies by others have 
also demonstrated that longitudinal and circumferen-
tial strain have diagnostic and prognostic relevance in 
female breast cancer patients undergoing treatment 
with doxorubicin or trastuzumab.308
Myocardial strain has excellent interobserver and 
intraobserver variability compared with other cardiac 
imaging modalities309 and is highly correlated with the 
relatively expensive and much less available cardiac 
MRI in the assessment of LV dysfunction.310 In addition,

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
strain imaging as obtained with echocardiography is 
less expensive and less time consuming, does not con-
fer radiation risk to the patient, and is not nephrotoxic 
compared with other cardiac imaging modalities for 
LVEF assessment; however, echocardiography image 
acquisition can be significantly limited in the setting of 
obesity and lung disease.
Biomarkers as Risk Markers of 
Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiac Disease
The role of biomarkers in this setting lies in the predic-
tion of cardiomyopathy or detection of subclinical car-
diomyopathy. Studies have evaluated the role of cardiac 
biomarkers, particularly brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 
and troponin I, which accurately reflect myocardial in-
jury, in the evaluation of cardiotoxicity associated with 
breast cancer therapy.311,312
Troponin I
Troponin I is a well-established, highly sensitive and 
specific marker of myocardial injury with a wide diag-
nostic window and is a robust chemical assay.313 A rise 
in troponin-I within ≈3 days of high-dose chemother-
apy has been shown to predict a reduction in LVEF.314 
Troponin I has an excellent negative predictive value for 
not developing cardiotoxicity during and immediately 
after treatment. Additional studies have shown simi-
lar findings, with a negative predictive value of 90% 
for ruling out the possibility of doxorubicin-induced 
systolic dysfunction with troponin I.305 Troponin I has 
also been successful in differentiating reversible and 
irreversible LV dysfunction associated with trastuzum-
ab,315 as well as in the identification of cardiovascular 
outcomes (defined as death resulting from a cardiac 
cause, acute pulmonary edema, overt HF, asymptom-
atic LVEF reduction [≥25% from baseline], or life-
threatening arrhythmias) in patients receiving various 
types and combinations of high-dose chemotherapy. 
In contrast, it has also been demonstrated that tropo-
nin I increases were common in breast cancer patients 
receiving both trastuzumab and lapatinib but were not 
associated with subsequent LV dysfunction according 
to multigated acquisition scans.316
Natriuretic Peptides
There is a lack of consensus regarding the role of N-ter-
minal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) in breast cancer cardiotox-
icity diagnosis and prognosis. Although some studies 
have shown that NT-proBNP did not predict cardio-
toxicity in adults with breast cancer,316,317 others have 
supported the role of proBNP in the identification of 
these patients.318,319 Of note, in a group of patients in 
which most had received chemotherapy, BNP showed 
an area under the curve of 0.86 in the detection of 
asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction.320 One study 
showed NT-proBNP to be more useful than troponin in 
the detection of subclinical LV dysfunction,321 and an-
other showed that it predicted mortality at 1-year fol-
low-up.322 Pitfalls associated with the use of natriuretic 
peptides include biological variation and variability with 
age, weight, renal function, and BMI. This calls for cau-
tion in the interpretation of data obtained using these 
serum markers.
Novel Biomarkers in Risk Identification
Data are limited on associations between novel bio-
markers and cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunc-
tion323–329; however, there are limited data in breast 
cancer patients. A small study in 78 patients with breast 
cancer undergoing doxorubicin and trastuzumab che-
motherapy found that early changes in high-sensitivity 
troponin I and myeloperoxidase improved risk predic-
tion of the first cardiotoxic event.330 Consideration was 
given to every cardiotoxic event and biomarker mea-
sure over the entire 15-month follow-up period, and 
myeloperoxidase, placental growth factor, and growth 
differentiation factor 15 were significantly associated 
with a risk of cardiotoxicity at the same and subsequent 
visits.331 Another study showed only NT-proBNP as a 
predictor of subclinical cardiotoxicity after treatment 
with anthracyclines.332
Imaging Combined With Biomarkers
Because both imaging and biomarkers are used as end 
points of the same pathological process, there could 
be value to using these methods conjointly to detect 
cardiotoxicity. In one study,317 a change in longitudi-
nal strain and troponin I at 3 months after doxorubicin 
chemotherapy predicted cardiotoxicity at the 6-month 
follow-up. Cardiotoxicity was also predicted by the 
number of segments with change in longitudinal strain 
at 3 months. In another seminal article by the same 
group,305 the combination of a 10% decrease in lon-
gitudinal strain with elevation in troponin I predicted 
cardiotoxicity after doxorubicin therapy with a speci-
ficity of 97%, whereas either marker alone showed a 
sensitivity of 89% and a negative predictive value of 
97% in detecting cardiotoxicity. The data therefore 
suggest possible benefit to the use of combinations of 
risk markers (strain imaging modality plus biomarkers 
in this case) in the identification of people at risk for 
cardiotoxicity after chemotherapy.
Biomarkers in the Identification of 
Radiation-Induced Cardiotoxicity
A few studies have evaluated biomarkers in patients un-
dergoing RT with conflicting results. One early study of 
50 women with breast cancer did not find any change 
in serum troponin after a total dose of 45 to 46 Gy 
of RT.333 Conversely, a more recent study of lung and 
breast cancer patients found both troponin and BNP 
increased significantly with radiation, although the ab-

solute and mean values remained at a relatively low lev-
el.334 In another recent study of 58 patients receiving RT 
for left-sided breast cancer, high-sensitivity troponin T 
increased during RT from baseline in 12 patients (21%). 
In that study, those patients with higher high-sensitivity 
troponin T values had received significantly higher ra-
diation doses for the whole heart and LV than those 
with stable high-sensitivity troponin T values.335 Hence, 
cardiac biomarkers might be useful for evaluation of ra-
diation-induced cardiotoxicity, but this requires further 
research before widespread implementation.
In recent times, the role of cardiac MRI in the de-
tection of cardiotoxicity associated with cancer therapy 
has been studied. In addition to detecting an early sub-
clinical decline in LVEF, cardiac MRI also has the abil-
ity to detect subtle changes in cardiac structure and 
to help identify the specific cause of abnormalities in 
LVEF.171 Thus, this is an imaging technique with a pos-
sible important role in detection of cardiotoxicity asso-
ciated with cancer therapy; however, its specific role in 
this process is limited by associated costs and limited 
availability.
ONCOLOGIC STRATEGIES TO 
MITIGATE CARDIOTOXICITY
 The multidisciplinary approach to the care of cancer 
patients exposed to multimodality cancer therapy has 
resulted in an increased understanding of the mecha-
nisms of cancer therapy–related cardiotoxicity. This has 
led to the investigation and adoption of clinical ap-
proaches to mitigate the impact of cancer treatments 
on cardiovascular health.
Dexrazoxane
Dexrazoxane has been used as a chelating agent that 
binds to intracellular iron, thus decreasing free radical 
formation and reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Simi-
lar cardioprotection has not been achieved with other 
iron-binding agents, however, and more recent work 
suggests that dexrazoxane changes the conformation 
of topoisomerase IIβ and interferes with anthracycline 
binding.336
Multiple trials conducted in breast cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy with doxorubicin or epirubi-
cin showed significant reductions in the combined end 
point of decrease in LVEF or development of HF with 
the addition of dexrazoxane and follow-up intervals 
that ranged from 15 to 43 months.337 A meta-analysis 
of 7 trials (1000 patients) estimated an overall reduction 
in cardiac events of 65% (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.27–0.45) 
with dexrazoxane versus placebo.338 Others estimated 
a 79% reduction in clinical HF when dexrazoxane was 
included in the treatment regimen (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 
0.13–0.33).192 The most recent Cochrane database 
concluded on the basis of 8 trials that dexrazoxane use 
was associated with an 82% reduction in HF (RR, 0.18; 
95% CI, 0.1–0.32), with no impact on progression-free 
survival, overall survival, or cancer response rates (RR, 
0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.02, P=0.08).339 Because of persis-
tent uncertainty about the risk of secondary malignan-
cies (primarily based on long-term follow-up of pediat-
ric patients) and possibly reduced tumor response rates, 
the FDA indication for dexrazoxane is quite narrow in 
breast cancer patients. Dexrazoxane is “indicated for 
reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy 
associated with doxorubicin administration in women 
with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cu-
mulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 and who will 
continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tu-
mor control. It is not recommended for use with the ini-
tiation of doxorubicin therapy.”340 The American Soci-
ety of Clinical Oncology has issued similar guidance.341 
The European Medicines Agency has expanded the us-
age to include patients who have a received a minimum 
cumulative epirubicin dose of 540 mg/m2.342,343
Doxorubicin Administration
Although total cumulative dose administered appears 
to be the strongest predictor of subsequent cardiotox-
icity,294 rate of infusion (presumably representing peak 
plasma level) also has a significant impact. Administra-
tion of doxorubicin via infusion as opposed to bolus 
administration is associated with a significant decrease 
in the risk of symptomatic cardiotoxicity without loss of 
antitumor efficacy (OR, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.75–9.72 for 
bolus administration versus infusion).192 A Cochrane 
database meta-analysis of 6 trials involving 735 patients 
showed a 73% reduction in clinical HF with infusion 
duration of ≥6 hours compared with shorter duration 
of infusion (RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09–0.81; P=0.02) 
without significant heterogeneity among trials.344 Only 
1 of these studies reported on LVEF and demonstrated 
lesser declines with the prolonged infusion at cumula-
tive doses of 300 and 400 mg/m2.345 Clinical HF rates 
and survival did not differ in 2 studies that compared 
peak doses of ≥60 mg/m2 with peak doses of <60 mg/
m2.344 Doxorubicin administered via continuous infusion 
(up to 48–96 hours) is not widely used because of prac-
tical issues requiring hospital admission.
Liposomal (pegylated or nonpegylated) formulations 
of doxorubicin permit delivery of a higher cumulative 
dose with preserved efficacy but a lower rate of cardiac 
side effects (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08–0.38).192 This fa-
vorable ratio of benefit and adverse effect is attributed 
to ready penetration through the vasculature within the 
tumor tissue, whereas the liposomes tend to remain in 
the intravascular space in other organs, including the 
heart.346 In the United States, liposomal preparations

do not carry an indication for breast cancer, but they 
are approved for secondary therapy in ovarian cancer, 
AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, and multiple myeloma.248
Radiation Techniques
Newer radiation techniques (proton therapy, deep-
inspiration breath holding, respiratory gating, lateral 
decubitus position, or use of modern 3-dimensional 
planning) have been devised that limit radiation dose 
overall and dose per fraction and limit the volume of 
heart exposed to radiation.347–349 These newer tech-
niques are likely to be associated with lower complica-
tion rates, but long-term follow-up data are not avail-
able at this time.
PREVENTIVE THERAPIES
The risk-benefit profile of each patient must be taken 
into consideration when choosing chemotherapy that 
can potentially cause cardiotoxicity, particularly in pa-
tients who, a priori, are considered to be at high risk 
for myocardial damage. Close collaboration between 
the oncologist and cardiologist is essential (Figure 4 
provides a simplified approach to the detection, pre-
vention, and treatment of HF in breast cancer patients). 
There are no definitive guidelines specific to CVD pre-
vention in breast cancer patients, because most of 
these studies were small and had variable end point 
definitions. Nevertheless, the next section will review 
CVD medications that could be used from a preventive 
standpoint for CVD or breast cancer, the role of exer-
cise in the breast cancer patient, and CVD prevention in 
breast cancer survivorship.
β-Blockers and Renin-Angiotensin-
Aldosterone System Blockade
Small randomized, placebo-controlled trials have 
shown benefit of prophylactic β-blocker (BB) therapy 
in breast cancer patients. Two trials, one predominately 
of breast cancer patients and the other solely of breast 
cancer patients, showed less of a decline in LV function 
at 6 months with prophylactic BB therapy (carvedilol 
or nebivolol) than with placebo before the initiation of 
anthracycline-based chemotherapy.351,352 Another study 
found that breast cancer patients with structurally nor-
mal hearts at baseline who were treated with anthracy-
cline or trastuzumab and who were taking a BB during 
treatment had a lower incidence of new HF events.353 
Conversely, a retrospective study of 179 patients receiv-
ing adjuvant trastuzumab for early breast cancer found 
that BB and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in-
hibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use did 
not alter the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxic-
ity.354 In balance, the data are mixed about whether 
and which type of prophylactic BB should be started in 
patients before the initiation of breast cancer therapy 
involving anthracycline or trastuzumab. PRADA (Pre-
vention of Cardiac Dysfunction During Adjuvant Breast 
Cancer Therapy) was a 2×2 factorial randomized, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with early 
breast cancer who had surgery and were scheduled for 
adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclo-
phosphamide). Patients received a combination of can-
desartan, metoprolol succinate, and placebo. A modest 
reduction in LV function was attenuated with candesar-
tan (0.8% versus 2.6% in the placebo group, P=0.026), 
but metoprolol succinate showed no effect on overall

LVEF decline.355 The more recently published MANTI-
CORE (Multidisciplinary Approach to Novel Therapies in 
Cardio-Oncology Research) 101–Breast trial was a ran-
domized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in pa-
tients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were 
being treated with trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. Dur-
ing the entire duration of adjuvant therapy, they also re-
ceived treatment with either perindopril, bisoprolol, or 
placebo (1:1:1). There was a small decline in LVEF in the 
placebo group (5%), whereas the decline in LVEF was 
attenuated to 3% in the ACE inhibitor group and 1% 
in the BB group.356 However, neither pharmacotherapy 
prevented the primary end point of trastuzumab-medi-
ated LV remodeling, which was defined as the change 
over time in indexed LV end-diastolic volume on cardiac 
MRI. Neither of these studies reported on HF outcomes, 
perhaps because of insufficient statistical power.
During treatment, early initiation of HF therapy for 
anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is beneficial. In 
a study of 201 patients with anthracycline-induced car-
diomyopathy regardless of HF symptoms, 74% received 
maximally tolerated doses of enalapril and carvedilol, 
whereas the rest tolerated only enalapril. The majority 
of patients had breast cancer. A decreased time to HF 
treatment and low New York Heart Association func-
tional class were independent predictors of LVEF recov-
ery.187 This group went on to show, in a cohort of 2625 
cancer patients, that ≈9% developed anthracycline-
induced cardiomyopathy, 98% of whom developed a 
decline in LVEF within 1 year of treatment (median, 3 
months). Early detection of anthracycline-induced car-
diotoxicity and treatment with HF therapy was associ-
ated with LVEF improvement.357 In a smaller study of 
25 patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, 
the majority of whom had breast cancer, those treated 
with a combination of an ACE inhibitor and a BB had 
significant improvement in LVEF, which was not seen 
with ACE inhibitor treatment alone.358
BBs have been associated with recovery of LV func-
tion in trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy. In a retro-
spective study of 499 women receiving adjuvant trastu-
zumab for early-stage breast cancer, the combined use 
of an ACE inhibitor and a BB was independently associ-
ated with hypertension and a significant decline in LVEF 
from baseline at 3 months. However, this association is 
confounded by indications for antihypertensive thera-
py, and those on combined therapy were significantly 
older, with worse baseline clinical profile (higher rates 
of history of hypertension and dyslipidemia). Interest-
ingly, the combined use of an ACE inhibitor and a BB 
was also associated with LVEF recovery from 3 to 12 
months, which suggests that these drugs are benefi-
cial in cardiac recovery.359 In a study of 38 women with 
suspected trastuzumab-induced LV dysfunction, once 
HF symptoms and LVEF were stable after treatment 
with trastuzumab ended, 25 women who were given 
maximally tolerated doses of ACE inhibitor and BB were 
rechallenged with trastuzumab, and 22 (88%) had a 
stable LVEF without HF symptoms in follow-up.254 It is 
not clear how many women were taking an ACE inhibi-
tor or BB at baseline; however, this series also suggests 
the combined use of an ACE inhibitor and BB can lead 
to LV systolic recovery. In 247 consecutive patients, the 
majority with breast cancer, interventions such as the 
initiation of cardiac medications, which included BBs in 
80% of cases, were associated with a significant im-
provement in mean LVEF but not a return back to base-
line.360 For trastuzumab cardiotoxicity, the European 
Society of Medical Oncology and the Canadian Trastu-
zumab Working Group recommend initiation of an ACE 
inhibitor and BB in patients with HF and LVEF <40%; 
they also recommend an ACE inhibitor in all asymptom-
atic patients with LVEF <40%, and recommend that a 
BB should be considered in asymptomatic patients with 
LVEF <40%.261,361 The Canadian Cardiovascular Soci-
ety’s guidelines recommend ACE inhibitor/ARB and BB 
combination therapy in cancer patients with an LVEF 
<40%, and these therapies should also be considered 
in those with an asymptomatic decline in LVEF (<10% 
decrease from baseline or LVEF <53%).362
Observational studies suggest that BB use can influ-
ence breast cancer mortality or recurrence.363 A retro-
spective study of 466 female patients with operable 
breast cancer and follow-up >10 years showed that 
patients taking a BB had a significant reduction in the 
development of metastasis and tumor recurrence and 
had longer disease-free survival.364 A meta-analysis of 
46 
265 breast cancer patients showed significant breast 
cancer–specific survival in patients treated with a BB.365 
A similar observational study demonstrated that BB use 
was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer re-
currence and cause-specific mortality.366 Another retro-
spective study of 1413 breast cancer patients showed 
BB use was associated with significantly better relapse-
free survival, including in patients with triple-negative 
breast cancer.367 Other studies have shown that breast 
cancer patients treated with propranolol are significant-
ly less likely to present with advanced disease and have 
a significantly lower cumulative probability of breast 
cancer–specific mortality compared with matched non-
users.368 Conversely, a cohort study of 4126 women 
with early-stage breast cancer in an integrated health 
plan showed BB use carried an increased risk of recur-
rence, whereas a nationwide study of Danish breast 
cancer survivors showed BBs did not attenuate recur-
rence risk.369,370 However, there are confounding fac-
tors in all of these studies, and thus, there is a need 
for a large randomized controlled trial to elucidate the 
potential benefit of BBs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs in 
breast cancer survivorship.
ACE inhibitors have been the agents best studied to 
prevent or treat LV dysfunction, whereas ARBs are less

well studied in this area. With the increased role of the 
mineralocorticoid antagonists in HF, including HF with 
preserved ejection fraction, and its potential to dimin-
ish fibrosis, spironolactone would be a logical protective 
agent. At least 1 study has shown that when spirono-
lactone is used concomitantly with an anthracycline 
drug in breast cancer patients, the decline in ejection 
fraction was attenuated in addition to diastolic stabi-
lization.371 This drug could have tremendous potential, 
and further studies are required. Although data from 
large randomized controlled trials of BB, ACE inhibitor/
ARB, and spironolactone use in breast cancer patients 
are not yet available, it seems reasonable to treat an-
thracycline or trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy in 
accordance with the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association HF guidelines.372,373
Aspirin
A number of observational studies have suggested a 
possible benefit of regular aspirin use in the prevention 
of breast cancer. A 2008 study found a strong protec-
tive effect of regular aspirin use and breast cancer. In 
that study, the investigators reported that taking low-
dose aspirin ≥4 d/wk over 10 years decreased the risk 
of breast cancer by 35% (HR, 0.65; CI, 0.43–0.97).374 
A 2011 study analyzed data from 26 
580 postmeno-
pausal women 59 to 77 years of age, 1581 of whom 
were diagnosed with breast cancer. These investigators 
found that women who regularly took aspirin had a 
20% lower risk of developing breast cancer (RR, 0.80; 
95% CI, 0.71–0.90). They further found that the risk 
decreased with increasing frequency of use, with a risk 
reduction of 29% in women taking aspirin ≥6 times per 
week compared with those who never took aspirin (RR, 
0.71; P for trend=0.00001).375
Other trials, however have found less or no pro-
tective effect of regular aspirin use and prevention of 
breast cancer. A 1996 report using data from the NHS 
found no protective effect against breast cancer for 
those taking regular aspirin. These investigators further 
analyzed aspirin use in 2414 cases of invasive breast 
cancer and again, in this subset of patients, found that 
regular aspirin use was not associated with prevention 
of breast cancer.376
A few studies have suggested an increased risk of 
breast cancer among women taking regular aspirin. 
Data from a Danish cohort demonstrated regular aspi-
rin use actually increased risk of breast cancer by 38% 
(RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12–1.69).377 They found a nonsig-
nificant increase in risk of recurrence of breast cancer 
in women taking aspirin.378 A large study on the role 
of aspirin in breast cancer prevention was the Women’s 
Health Study, published in 2005.379 This was a random-
ized, placebo-controlled trial of 39 
876 women ≥45 
years old who were randomly assigned to take either 
100 mg of aspirin every other day or placebo. After 
10 years of follow-up, no protective effect was seen in 
breast cancer (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87–1.09; P=0.68).
Although these individual studies do not provide 
strong support for aspirin use to prevent breast cancer, 
several meta-analyses did find a reduction in breast can-
cer incidence with regular aspirin use. One of the most 
important meta-analyses included data from 38 studies 
including 2 
788 
715 women and reported that regular 
aspirin use reduced risk of breast cancer by 13% (RR, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.92).380 There is clearly equipoise 
about the question of whether regular aspirin use pre-
vents incident or recurrent breast cancer, and an ongo-
ing placebo-controlled, randomized trial381 is expected 
to answer the latter question.
Statins
An early statin trial, the CARE trial (Cholesterol and Re-
current Events)382 reported the unexpected finding of an 
increased incidence of breast cancer in those assigned 
to statin therapy. However, these findings were thought 
to be spurious and an anomaly owing in part to a very 
low incidence of breast cancer cases in the placebo 
group and an imbalance in risk factors for breast cancer 
at baseline. No other statin trials have found an associa-
tion or an increased risk,383 and other investigators had 
surmised that statins might exert a beneficial effect and 
a reduction of cancer incidence, perhaps via inhibition of 
cell proliferation by systemic cholesterol reduction. How-
ever, a meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials 
and 9 observational studies, with a total of 7858 breast 
cancer cases, found no association between statin use 
and breast cancer incidence.384 Additionally, data from 
24 observational studies with 76 
759 total breast cancer 
cases,385 showed no association between statin use and 
breast cancer incidence (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94–1.04). 
Finally, the WHI program studied 154 
587 postmeno-
pausal women 50 to 79 years of age and identified 
7430 pathologically confirmed cases of breast cancer 
over an average follow-up of 10.8 years.386 They also 
found no association between statin use and breast can-
cer risk; the annualized rate of breast cancer was 0.42% 
among statin users and 0.42% among nonusers, and 
the multivariable adjusted HR of breast cancer for users 
versus nonusers was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83–1.06).
Despite no evidence for an effect of statins on breast 
cancer incidence, there is some evidence that statins 
might favorably impact breast cancer prognosis. One 
such study was conducted on patients ≈2 years after 
a breast cancer diagnosis who were then followed up 
for 5 years.387 Using data on medication use from the 
pharmacy records of the Kaiser Permanente Health Sys-
tem, the adjusted HR for developing a recurrence of 
breast cancer in statin users versus nonusers was 0.67 
(95% CI, 0.39–1.13). Another larger cohort study of 
Danish breast cancer patients found similar results with 
lipophilic statins.388 Interestingly, there are also ongoing

studies evaluating a potential cardioprotective effect of 
statin therapy on anthracycline-induced cardiomyopa-
thy and HF.389 Clearly, more data are needed on the po-
tential protective effects of statin therapy.
Exercise
The vast majority of studies investigating exercise preven-
tion of cancer treatment–induced cardiovascular toxicity 
are in rodent models, but there are limited data in hu-
mans.390 A single-arm study investigated the effects of 4 
months of exercise training in 17 breast cancer survivors 
receiving adjuvant trastuzumab therapy and found that 
despite exercise training, trastuzumab was associated 
with LV dilatation and reduced LVEF.391 However, the 
exercise training intensity might have been insufficient, 
because participants attended only 59% of prescribed 
sessions. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial 
in Canada conducted between 2003 and 2005, 242 
breast cancer patients initiating anthracycline-based ad-
juvant chemotherapy were randomized to usual care, 
supervised resistance exercise, or supervised aerobic ex-
ercise for the duration of their chemotherapy (median, 
17 weeks; 95% CI, 9–24 weeks). Although adherence 
to prescribed exercise was high (70.2%) and the study 
demonstrated improvement in self-esteem, reduced 
percent body fat with aerobic exercise, and improved 
muscular strength, lean body mass, and chemotherapy 
completion rate with resistance training, no cardiovas-
cular end points were assessed.392
An analysis of 2 large-scale prospective cohort stud-
ies in 2973 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer 
demonstrated a strong, graded inverse relationship 
between exercise intensity and incidence of cardiovas-
cular events in general, as well as for the incidence of 
coronary artery disease and HF in particular. The benefit 
emerged in those with an exercise level of ≥10 meta-
bolic equivalent h/wk, which matches the national exer-
cise guidelines for adult patients with cancer (≥9 meta-
bolic equivalent h/wk), and resulted in a 23% lower 
adjusted risk of cardiovascular events, 26% lower risk 
of coronary artery disease, and 29% lower HF risk in 
the study cohort.393 Further clinical research is needed 
to determine whether exercise during cancer therapy 
is a feasible and effective method for the reduction of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in breast cancer 
survivors. There are 2 ongoing trials examining the role 
of exercise in breast cancer patients receiving chemo-
therapy. TITAN (Multidisciplinary Team Intervention in 
Cardio-Oncology) is a randomized controlled trial that 
will compare the effects of intensive multidisciplinary 
team interventions (nutritional counseling, exercise 
training, etc) with usual care for prevention of LV re-
modeling in patients with newly diagnosed early breast 
cancer or lymphoma who are scheduled for anthracy-
cline-, trastuzumab-, or anthracycline and trastuzum-
ab–based chemotherapy.394 OptiTrain is a randomized

going chemotherapy.395
Survivorship Programs
Improvements in cancer treatment have resulted in an 
increasing number of long-term cancer survivors who 
could have their survival and quality of life affected by 
concomitant CVD. Cardiovascular comorbidity can be 
preexistent or secondary to toxicity related to cancer 
therapy. Secondary prevention in the context of breast 
cancer relates to the management of preexisting car-
diovascular risk factors and monitoring for cardiotox-
icity during the survivorship period after breast cancer 
treatment has been completed.396
An initial step in deciding the medical approach 
in the survivorship stage is to determine risk of CVD. 
Breast cancer survivors at higher risk for CVD include 
patients with any cardiovascular abnormality noted in 
follow-up or patients who received doxorubicin >240 
mg/m2, radiation >30 Gy, radiation plus anthracycline, 
or high-dose cyclophosphamide, particularly if strenu-
ous activity or pregnancy is planned.396 Medical treat-
ment of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with 
cancer generally follows the American Heart Associa-
tion/American College of Cardiology HF guidelines372,373 
with some modifications adapted for patients with the 
high-risk factors mentioned above. Importantly, treat-
ment recommendations will need to be individualized 
to the overall survival prognosis of the breast cancer 
patients.396,397
Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, namely, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and lifestyle, 
among others, will need to be assessed in survivorship 
programs. Management of blood pressure, glucose, 
and hypercholesterolemia and treatment of tobacco 
abuse should follow current American Heart Associa-
tion Guidelines.398,399 The use of statins in patients with 
breast cancer includes the same indications as in pri-
mary prevention of CVD.397–399
In women with breast cancer, treatment and the dis-
ease itself contribute to weight gain and to decreases in 
physical activity.400–402 Furthermore, it has been reported 
that cardiopulmonary function in patients with breast 
cancer improves with exercise, and regular exercise re-
sults in an improvement in quality of life.397,403–406 Al-
though the usefulness of exercise to prevent CVD in 
patients with breast cancer has not been evaluated in 
randomized trials, it is reasonable to follow the Ameri-
can Heart Association recommendations for physical 
activity, that is, moderate-intensity aerobic physical 
activity of ≥30 minutes 5 days each week.407 In addi-

tion, a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined 
all the effects of physical activity on the risk of breast 
cancer recurrence and mortality found that prediagno-
sis and postdiagnosis physical activity were both associ-
ated with a lower mortality and cancer recurrence rate, 
which supports the idea that physical activity reduces 
these events among breast cancer survivors.115
Posttreatment Cardiac Imaging Surveillance
Long-term surveillance aims at monitoring those with 
preexisting and ongoing CVD and those at risk for late 
cardiotoxicity, particularly those who received anthracy-
clines and mediastinal RT.396,397 Longer-term data sug-
gest modest but persistent declines in LVEF with expo-
sure to common cancer therapies, as well as an increase 
in measures of arterial and chamber stiffness,186 pos-
sibly suggestive of HF with preserved ejection fraction. 
Accordingly, most guidelines or expert consensus docu-
ments recommend surveillance imaging during breast 
cancer imaging and possibly posttreatment depending 
on agent and dose administered. A consensus docu-
ment for multimodality imaging in adult cancer patients 
by the American Society of Echocardiography and the 
European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging rec-
ommends the evaluation of cardiac function (typically 
echocardiography and, if suboptimal, then cardiac MRI) 
at baseline, at completion of therapy, and at 6-month 
follow-up in patients receiving anthracycline therapy 
at cumulative doses <240 mg/m2; those with higher 
cumulative doses should have repeat LVEF measure-
ment before each additional dose of 50 mg/m2, and 
any patient with LVEF <53% is recommended to have 
a cardiology consultation. Those receiving HER2-target-
ed therapies are recommended to undergo a baseline 
evaluation of LVEF, and then an LVEF evaluation every 3 
months during therapy; however, those who were pre-
viously treated with an anthracycline should have LVEF 
reassessed 6 months after completion of HER2-target-
ed therapies (Figure 5). Additionally, after completion 
of breast cancer treatment, it was recommended that 
patients undergo annual cardiovascular assessments 
by a provider; however, cardiac imaging should be at 
the discretion of the provider, based on the history and 
physical examination.408
A subsequent expert consensus publication pro-
posed that in low-risk patients, a transthoracic echocar-
diogram with strain be performed at the completion of 
therapy, with no need for further follow-ups if the test 
result is normal and the patient remains asymptomatic. 
In contrast, for patients at medium to high risk, a trans-
thoracic echocardiogram with strain is recommended 
(1) only at completion of therapy for patients with car-
diotoxicity as seen with agents such as trastuzumab, 
or (2) at completion of therapy and then at 6 to 12 
months or 12 and 18 months after treatment among 
patients receiving anthracyclines alone or in combina-
tion with trastuzumab and RT; however further surveil-
lance recommendations were not established.409 The 
American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guide-
lines for prevention and monitoring of LV dysfunction 
in adult cancer patients propose that all patients for-
merly treated with potentially cardiotoxic therapies un-
dergo a detailed history and physical examination, and 
Figure 5. Echocardiographic surveillance during and after treatment with anthracycline therapy or HER2-directed 
therapy.  
At any time during the course of surveillance imaging, if the ejection fraction is <53%, then cardiology consultation is recom-
mended. If cardiac imaging is suboptimal, then cardiac magnetic resonance imaging should be considered. After completion 
of therapy, patients should undergo annual cardiovascular assessments by a provider; however, cardiac imaging should be at 
the discretion of the provider based on the history and physical examination. HER2 indicates human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2. This Figure is based on recommendations from the consensus document for multimodality imaging in adult cancer 
patients prepared by the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.408

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
if there are any signs or symptoms of LV dysfunction, 
then further testing, including imaging assessment with 
echocardiography (or cardiac MRI or multigated acqui-
sition), is recommended. Asymptomatic patients with 
a presumed elevated risk of potentially developing LV 
dysfunction may undergo imaging 6 to 12 months after 
completion of cancer therapy; however, if results are 
normal, there are no current recommendations regard-
ing frequency of subsequent surveillance in these pa-
tients.11 These 3 different approaches reflect the knowl-
edge gaps and uncertainty around the progression and 
natural course of these complications. Although more 
data are needed, it is reasonable to consider long-term 
imaging surveillance, and the decision should be a clini-
cal decision (taking into account the history and physi-
cal examination), with the risks and benefits of further 
testing to be weighed by the clinician.408
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As the population ages, there will likely be more women 
with breast cancer, CVD, or both. Current cancer treat-
ments might increase the risk of both short- and long-
term cardiotoxicity, and women who are breast cancer 
survivors could be at higher risk of death caused by CVD 
than women without a history of breast cancer. More re-
search is needed in terms of optimal surveillance of car-
diotoxicity, preventive therapies, and treatment of cardio-
toxicity. There are gaps in care and in priorities that would 
help bridge care of the patient (Table 3). Improved risk 
assessment and development of personalized preventive 
strategies in cancer survivorship programs are imperative 
for improved outcomes and reductions in CVD mortality 
in the breast cancer patient. Over the past decade, the 
number of cardio-oncology programs has increased, but 
many are centered on the treatment of CVD secondary to 
cancer therapies, and less emphasis has been placed on 
prevention before development of cardiotoxicity. Clearly, 
there are common risk factors between breast cancer and 
CVD. The care of these patients extends beyond the silos 
of cardiology and oncology and should be interdisciplin-
ary, with vigilance with regard to the primary prevention 
of CVD along with the secondary prevention of CVD.
Currently, several organizations, such as the Ameri-
can College of Cardiology (Cardio-Oncology Section), 
Canadian Cardiac Oncology Network, European Soci-
ety of Cardiology, European Society of Medical Oncol-
ogy, and the International Cardio-Oncology Society, 
are working on initiatives to promote collaboration of 
healthcare professionals from oncology and cardiology 
disciplines and to improve the care of cancer patients 
who are treated with potentially cardiotoxic therapies. 
Additionally, there must be standardization of nomen-
clature regarding cardiotoxicity, as well as training of 
the future generation of care providers.
CONCLUSIONS
Ideal breast cancer outcomes are reliant on coexist-
ing cardiovascular health along the entire journey of 
breast cancer treatment. At the time of initial presen-
tation, cardiac risk factors and preceding CVD can im-
pact cancer treatment options. During breast cancer 
treatment, surveillance, prevention, and secondary 
management of cardiotoxicity are crucial; thereafter, 
long-term posttreatment monitoring for late cardio-
toxicity and even non–treatment-related development 
of CVD is essential. With the evolving intersection of 
the cardiovascular and oncologic fields, comprehen-
sive care is an essential element in the management of 
cancer patients to maximize gains in cancer treatment 
while minimizing the potential deleterious impact on 
cardiovascular health.
