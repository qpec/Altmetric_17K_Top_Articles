In Brief
Most antibodies used for Ebola virus
treatment originate from convalescent
donors or highly immunized animals. Rijal
et al. find that monoclonal antibodies
isolated early after vaccination from
humans can be powerfully therapeutic,
despite the relative immaturity of their
sequences. Vaccine trials therefore can
provide a valuable source of therapeutic
antibodies.

SUMMARY
We describe therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
isolated from human volunteers vaccinated with re-
combinant adenovirus expressing Ebola virus glyco-
protein (EBOV GP) and boosted with modified
vaccinia virus Ankara. Among 82 antibodies isolated
from peripheral blood B cells, almost half neutralized
GP
pseudotyped
influenza
virus.
The
antibody
response was diverse in gene usage and epitope
recognition. Although close to germline in sequence,
neutralizing antibodies with binding affinities in
the nano- to pico-molar range, similar to ‘‘affinity
matured’’ antibodies from convalescent donors,
were found. They recognized the mucin-like domain,
glycan cap, receptor binding region, and the base of
the glycoprotein. A cross-reactive cocktail of four
antibodies, targeting the latter three non-overlapping
epitopes,
given
on
day
3
of
EBOV
infection,
completely protected guinea pigs. This study high-
lights the value of experimental vaccine trials as a
rich source of therapeutic human monoclonal anti-
bodies.
INTRODUCTION
The Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in 2013–2016 in West Africa re-
sulted in 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths (https://www.who.int/
csr/disease/ebola/en/). A new outbreak in 2018 is in progress in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has claimed 528 lives
to date (https://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/
en/). During the 2013–2016 outbreak, there were no approved
vaccines or therapeutics, only experimental ones. ZMapp anti-
bodies were tested in human trials during the outbreak in West
Africa. Although the ZMapp cocktail was not proven statistically
to be protective because of the small number of participants,
there was a trend in the direction of improved survival (Davey
et al., 2016). The ZMapp cocktail of murine chimeric antibodies
(c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7), one targeting the glycan cap and
two to the base of the glycoprotein, was successful in protecting
100% of non-human primates as late as 5 days post infection
(Qiu et al., 2014).
Mixtures of monoclonal antibodies to the EBOV glycoprotein
(GP) from convalescent humans (Maruyama et al., 1999; Flyak
et al., 2016, 2018; Corti et al., 2016; Bornholdt et al., 2016; Wec
et al., 2017; Gilchuk et al., 2018), humanized mice (Pascal et al.,
2018), hyper-immunized macaques (Keck et al., 2015; Zhao
et al., 2017), and wild-type mice (Furuyama et al., 2016; Marzi
et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2012; Pettitt et al.,
2013; Takada et al., 2007) have been shown to be therapeutic in
various animal models. The antibodies of human origin, 114 (to
the receptor binding region) and 100 (to the base), showed a
similarly profound therapeutic effect (Corti et al., 2016). Another
new cocktailfromRegeneron, derived from humanized mice,con-
taining oneantibody to the fusion loop,onetothehead, and oneto
the glycan cap was also protective in primates at a dose of
150 mg/Kg (Pascal et al., 2018) and has recently been approved
for emergency experimental use during the 2018 outbreak in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. This cocktail was intentionally
chosen to combine antibodies to independent epitopes with
neutralization and immune effector functions, thought to be com-
plementary. However, none of these therapeutic cocktails are
cross-protective to the other species of Ebola that can cause hu-
man disease. These results encourage the development of opti-
mized cocktails of antibodies for use against human disease
caused by the complete range of Ebola virus species.

emphasized the variety of independent epitopes on the viral
glycoprotein that can be bound by protective antibodies and
the
range
of
antibody-dependent
mechanisms
that
can
contribute to protection in vivo (Saphire et al., 2018). The VIC
study established that neutralization in vitro was a strong indica-
tor of the protective potential of an antibody but in addition, re-
vealed that multiple Fc recruited functions also contributed to
protection (Gunn et al., 2018). These results provided the theo-
retical background for our investigation.
In these examples, the great majority of therapeutic antibodies
were isolated from animals or humans after multiple or prolonged
exposuresto the EBOV glycoprotein. These levelsofexposureare
thought to select for high-affinity antibodies through the acquisi-
tion of multiple adaptive somatic mutations after repeated rounds
of competitive selection of B cells in the germinal centers of lymph
nodes during affinity maturation; reviewed in (Eisen and Chakra-
borty, 2013; Oropallo and Cerutti, 2014). Structural analysis of hu-
man monoclonal antibodies to influenza hemagglutinin, isolated
from each stage of this process, suggests that the useful muta-
tions pre-configure the tertiary structure of the binding loops of
the antibody to minimize the energy cost of binding. This can in-
crease both the on-rate, and reduce the off-rate of the antibody
to achieve affinities in the nano- to picomolar range associated
with virus neutralization (Schmidt et al., 2013).
This explanatory framework suggests that antibodies with the
required specificity and kinetics for neutralization may be pre-
sent early in an immune response, but at a lower frequency
than after full affinity maturation has taken place. If an efficient
screening system is applied to finding them, antibodies with
the required properties for therapy should be available from do-
nors responding to an antigen for the first time. Human volun-
teers in experimental vaccine trials offer a convenient source of
such antibodies without the difficulties of sample availability or
concerns about persistent virus or other pathogens in venous
samples from convalescent donors.
Here, we show that despite minimal affinity maturation, anti-
bodies isolated from donors vaccinated with Ebola virus GP
are as protective as antibodies from other sources in a rigorous
test of therapy at day 3 of a lethal EBOV infection in the guinea
pig model.
RESULTS
Isolation and Expression of Monoclonal Antibodies from
Vaccinated Donors
Volunteers were vaccinated with ChAD3 EBOV (chimpanzee
adenovirus 3 encoding EBOV glycoprotein) (Stanley et al.,
2014) and boosted with MVA-BN Filo, modified vaccinia virus
Ankara (MVA) encoding the glycoproteins from EBOV Mayinga,
SUDV Gulu and MARV (Marburg virus Musoke), and the nucleo-
protein from TAFV produced by Bavarian Nordic (Ewer et al.,
2016). A total of 82 antibodies were isolated from plasmablasts
or memory B cells isolated at day 7 and day 28, respectively
(Table S1), following booster vaccination with the MVA-BN-Filo
from 11 vaccinated volunteers (Figure 1A, Table S5) as
described in the STAR Methods.
Screening of Monoclonal Antibodies for Binding and
Neutralization
MDCK-SIAT1 cells were transduced to express the glycoprotein
from Zaire ebolavirus (H-sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Kissidougou-
C15) as described (Xiao et al., 2018). MDCK-SIAT1 cells were
used in these experiments because, unlike other cell lines, they
tolerate high levels of stable expression of EBOV GP, can pseu-
dotype an influenza core, and are readily infected by our EBOV
surrogate E-S-FLU (Xiao et al., 2018). Initial screening of anti-
bodies was by detection of binding by indirect immunofluores-
cence to EBOV GP transduced cells.
GP-binding antibodies were then tested for blockade of infec-
tion of MDCK-SIAT1 cells by our Ebola surrogate E-S-FLU,
which contains a disabled influenza core coated with Ebola
GP. E-S-FLU encodes a fluorescent protein eGFP that replaces
the hemagglutinin coding sequence so that infected cells fluo-
resce green. Thirty-eight of 82 antibodies inhibited infection by
E-S-FLU as defined by loss of eGFP fluorescence after overnight
infection by at least 50% (Figure 1D). We next distinguished
‘‘partially’’ neutralizing antibodies (inhibition of infection plateaus
at 50%–90% inhibition) from ‘‘strongly’’ neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) (that achieve R90% inhibition of infection) as
shown in Figure 1C. Figure 1D shows a summary of the 38
neutralizing antibodies compared to a set of control antibodies
described in the literature including KZ52 (Maruyama et al.,
1999; Lee et al., 2008), c4G7, c2G4, and c13C6—the three com-
ponents of ZMapp (Murin et al., 2014), 100 and 114 (Corti et al.,
2016; Misasi et al., 2016), and 6D6 (Furuyama et al., 2016).
The Relationship between In Vitro Neutralization and
Protection In Vivo in Mice
A set of the first 24 antibodies isolated (14 showing >50%
neutralization and 10 non-neutralizing) were tested for protec-
tion of mice (single dose of 100 mg at day 2 of infection with
a mouse-adapted Ebola virus in groups of 10) as part of the
work of the VIC (Saphire et al., 2018). This revealed that the
14 antibodies showing >50% neutralization in our assay pro-
vided overall 65.7% survival (range, 10%–100%), whereas the
(C) Microscopic images showing virus neutralization by different antibodies at 5 mg/mL concentration.
(D) In vitro neutralizing concentration of mAbs shown as IC50 and IC90. Neutralization IC50 ranges from 0.1 to 10 mg/mL. Partially neutralizing antibodies have no
IC90 values. Almost half of the antibodies have titers comparable to that of the antibodies published in the literature. Measurements were taken as an average of
duplicates and experiments were repeated at least twice. The percentage (%) value in brackets on the x axis is the survival of mice treated at day 2 of infection with
100 mg of antibody in the VIC study (Saphire et al., 2018).

 10 non-neutralizing antibodies provided 31% overall survival
(range, 10%–50%); two tailed p < 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact
test (Figure 1E). These results confirmed that neutralization de-
tected in our assay was associated with a therapeutic effect in
mice, but also emphasized that some neutralizing antibodies
fail to protect, and some non-neutralizing antibodies can pro-
tect, at least partially.
Diversity of Epitopes Recognized
We defined the epitopes recognized by antibodies with four as-
says. First, we measured competitive inhibition of binding by an-
tibodies with defined specificities including our own mAb P6
(glycan cap, GC). P6 was designated as specific for the GC by
alanine scanning and electron microscopy in the VIC study (Sa-
phire et al., 2018) where P6 = VIC 82, c13C6 (GC or receptor
binding region [RBR]), 114 (RBR), KZ52 (base), c2G4 and c4G7
(base), 100 (base), and 6D6 (fusion loop) as guide antibodies
(Figure 2A). Second, a sub-group of antibodies were mapped
for binding to a yeast surface display antigenic library expressing
GP fragments (Figures 2B and S1; Table S2). Third, binding to
thermolysin digested GP to mimic cathepsin removal of glycan
cap and mucin-like domain (MLD) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2).
Fourth, binding to MDCK-SIAT1 cells transduced to express
MLD-deleted GP (amino acids 313–463 deleted) (Figure S3).
With this combination of tests, we could distinguish seven clus-
ters of antibody binding sites: three clusters in the glycan cap,
one in the RBR, two in the base or fusion loop, and one in the
MLD (summarized in Figure 2D).
Antibodies to Glycan Cap
mAbs to the GC could be divided into three overlapping groups.
In the first group (exemplified by P6 = VIC 82 and 040 = VIC 91)
the antibodies cross-inhibited the binding only of other GC-spe-
cific antibodies (Figure 2A). P6 was defined as GC-specific by
electron microscopy and alanine scanning (Saphire et al.,
2018), and both P6 and 040 were defined by sequencing of a
protein fragment consisting of amino acids 228–281 of GP1 ex-
pressed in yeast that was bound by these antibodies (Figures 2B
and S1; Table S2). The epitopes bound by antibodies to the GC
were removed by thermolysin cleavage of GP expressed on
MDCK-SIAT1 cells (GPcl) (Figures 2C and S2). In the second
group, the antibodies inhibited the binding of both GC-specific
antibodies and RBR-specific antibodies, as exemplified by
66-3-2C (Figure 2A), which suggests they bind to an epitope
that overlaps these two regions.
The third group was defined by antibody 66-3-9C that bound
to a small conserved peptide within the b17-18 loop of the glycan
cap (amino acids 286–293 GEWAFWET) expressed in yeast (Fig-
ure 2B, iii). 66-3-9C recognizes a similar epitope to that bound by
the macaque-derived mAb FVM09 (Keck et al., 2015). The disor-
dered loop is juxtaposed to the surface footprint bound by the
base antibody KZ52 (Keck et al., 2015), which may explain why
KZ52 blocked the binding of biotinylated 66-3-9C (Figure 2A).
FVM09 was found to synergize with certain other mAbs to the
GC and base for in vitro neutralization and protection in vivo (Ho-
well et al., 2017). We noted mutually enhanced binding between
the base antibodies c2G4 and c4G7 and 66-3-9C (Figure 2A).
However, this mutually enhanced binding did not translate to
enhanced neutralization by mixtures of these antibodies in our
in vitro assay (data not shown).
The GC-specific antibodies defined by the competition assay
lost binding to thermolysin-treated GP expressed on MDCK-
SIAT1 cells (Figures 2C and S2).
Antibodies to the Receptor Binding Region
The RBR is highly conserved in species of Ebolavirus and Mar-
burgvirus and therefore offers an attractive target for therapeutic
antibodies (Murin et al., 2014; Hashiguchi et al., 2015; Flyak
et al., 2015; Bornholdt et al., 2016; Corti et al., 2016). We defined
mAbs to the RBR by competition for binding to GP with human
mAb 114. We showed that 114 bound the GP1 core fragment
102–230 in the yeast expression assay (Figure 2B). mAb 114
competed for binding with a subset of neighboring GC-specific
antibodies (Figure 2A) but not with P6 and 040. However, in
contrast to the GC-specific antibodies, mAb 114 and similar an-
tibodies retain binding after release of the GC and MLD following
exposure of E-SIAT cells to thermolysin digestion as expected
(Corti et al., 2016; Misasi et al., 2016) (Figures 2C and S2). Ten
mAbs showed this pattern and were placed into the RBR binding
group (Figure 2).
Antibodies to the Base or Fusion Loop
These antibodies were defined by competition for binding with
the published antibodies KZ52 (base), c2G4 and c4G7 (base),
100 (base), and 6D6 (fusion loop). Many of these antibodies
Figure 2. Identification of Epitopes
(A) Antibody epitopes defined by cross-inhibition for binding. Known antibodies 114, ZMapp (c13C6, c2G4, c4G7), 100, and KZ52 were used as guide mAbs to
group other antibodies. Antibodies 66-4-A8 (MLD-dependent mAb) and influenza antibodies were used as non-inhibiting controls. Red designates inhibition of
the biotinylated antibody by the competing antibody. Blue designates absence of inhibition in the presence of competing antibody. Inhibition values were
calculated as defined in STAR Methods. Results are the average of repeated experiments and 4–8 replicates were included in each measurement.
(B) A selection of mAbs 040 (i), 114 (ii), and 66-3-9C (iii) was screened for binding a yeast display library of fragments of EBOV GP. The fragments recognized are
represented on the structure of the KZ52-GP complex PDB: 3CSY.
(C) Binding of mAbs to Ebola GP on transduced MDCK-SIAT1 cells (E-SIAT) after thermolysin digestion, analyzed by flow cytometry. Log of the difference of
binding of mAbs to thermolysin-treated E-SIAT and thermolysin-untreated E-SIAT is shown: Bars are color coded by the specificity of the mAbs as defined by the
competition binding assays: purple, glycan cap; black, mucin-like domain; green, receptor binding region; orange, base, and gray, undefined. An arbitrary value
of 0.2 is used as a cut-off to define mAbs affected by thermolysin digestion, with reference to mAb 114, which is known to be resistant to thermolysin digestion.
The measurements were repeated at least twice.
(D) Assignment of neutralizing or protective antibodies to their epitopes based on cross-inhibition assays. (i) Mucin-like domain-dependent. Six mAbs lost binding
to the MLD deleted GP. 66-3-9C (specific for the b17-18 loop) and the base antibody 66-4-C12 also showed reduced binding. (ii) Glycan cap and receptor binding
region. P6-like (GC), 114-like (RBR), and others in-between these epitopes. P6-like and 114-like are independent epitopes and do not block each other. Anti-
bodies on the left (P6-like and neighbors) are sensitive to thermolysin cleavage. Antibodies on the right (114-like) are resistant to thermolysin cleavage or have
enhanced binding after cleavage. (iii) Antibodies to base are blocked by defined base antibodies and are resistant to thermolysin digestion.

 cross-inhibited each other, but sub-groups were discernible. For
instance, biotinylated 6541 and 66-4-C12 were both inhibited by
the characterized base antibodies KZ52 and 100, but 6541 and
66-4-C12 failed to inhibit each other, suggesting that they bound
to non-overlapping sites in the base region (Figures 2A and 2D).
Antibodies 6541, 66-4-C12, and 66-6-3 competed for binding
with the fusion loop-specific murine mAb 6D6, which suggested
their binding footprints may overlap with the fusion peptide.
Binding of base region-specific antibodies to thermolysin-
treated cells was typically either unaffected or enhanced (Figures
2C and S2).
Mucin-like Domain-Dependent Antibodies
The binding of 6/82 antibodies to MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing
GP lacking the MLD (amino acids 313–463) was reduced by
comparison with cells expressing full-length GP (Figure S3).
Control antibodies to GP1 head (c13C6) and base (KZ52 and
c4G7) bound the MLD deleted and full-length GP equally.
None of the six MLD-dependent antibodies were neutralizing.
We found that the antibodies 66-3-9C (specific for the b17-18
loop sequence [GEWAFWET]) also lost binding to the MLD-
deleted GP, and the binding of one antibody to the base,
66-4-C12, was reduced (although was not affected by thermoly-
sin cleavage).
Antibodies to the Glycan Cap and Thermolysin Cleavage
Treatment with thermolysin mimics the effect of cathepsin and
results in removal of the GC and MLD (Chandran et al., 2005;
Schornberg et al., 2006; C^
ote
´ et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012).

(B) Binding by some glycan cap antibodies survives

Experiments were reproduced at least three times.
See also Figure S2.
This is reflected in the loss of binding by an-
tibodies to the glycan cap and MLD to
E-SIAT cells after exposure to thermolysin
(Figures 2, 3, and S2). We noticed that
some antibodies to the glycan cap, if
bound before exposure of E-SIAT cells to
thermolysin treatment, remained bound
after thermolysin treatment (Figures 3B
and S2C).
Figure 3A shows binding of selected
GC-, RBR-, and base-specific antibodies
after cleavage by thermolysin. The three
antibodies to the glycan cap (P6, 040, and
66-3-9C) lose binding after thermolysin
treatment, whereas the epitopes bound
by RBR (114)- and base (66-4-C12)-spe-
cific antibodies were not affected (Figures 3A and S2). We
confirmed this result for seven additional GC-specific antibodies
(Figure S2). Thermolysin digestion achieved complete removal of
these epitopes as shown by (1) the reduction of binding by these
antibodies to the level of a negative control specific for influenza
(Figure S2), (2) the appearance of the epitope recognized by
MR78 that binds to EBOV GP only after removal of the glycan
cap (Flyak et al., 2015; Bornholdt et al., 2016; Hashiguchi
et al., 2015), and (3) loss of detection in western blots of the
GP1 fragment bound by P6 (Figure S2D).
We next noted the effect of allowing the GC-specific anti-
bodies to bind, followed by treatment with thermolysin. We
found that the mAbs P6 and 040 remained bound despite
thermolysin treatment (Figure 3B). This effect was confirmed
(Figure S2) for five additional neutralizing antibodies to the
GC (66-3-7C, 66-3-2C, 141, 66-3-4A, and 125). The effect
was specific to glycan cap-specific antibodies and not seen
for antibody 66-3-9C specific for the b17-18 loop (GEWAFWET)
(Figure 3B).
In these experiments, the E-SIAT cells were first trypsinized
to detach them from plastic before exposure to thermolysin.
We repeated the experiment without the use of trypsin, where
the cells were exposed only to thermolysin in plastic plates.
Thermolysin treatment resulted in the loss of binding sites for
the nine GC-specific antibodies tested. Evidence for cleavage
in these conditions was provided by the appearance of the
epitope in RBR bound by MR78 that only binds to EBOV GP af-
ter removal of the glycan cap (Figure S2B). When E-SIAT cells

 were treated with thermolysin in the presence of GC-specific
antibodies, these antibodies retained their binding, with the
exception of 66-3-9C to the b17-18 loop (Figure S2C).
A western blot in Figure S2D shows that immunoprecipitation
by the P6 (GC) antibody of the bands representing GP1 de-
tected after blotting by a mAb to the sequence GEWAFWET
(286–293) is lost after thermolysin treatment. This indicates
the completeness of digestion in these conditions and corre-
lates with the loss of binding of P6 and other GC antibodies
in the indirect immunofluorescence assays in Figure S2B.
These results suggested that the P6, 040, and other neutral-
izing GC-specific antibodies may have either inhibited cleavage
of GP by thermolysin or stabilized the glycan cap in the bound
state despite cleavage. A related observation has been made
recently with the GC-specific mAb EBOV-442 (Gilchuk et al.,
2018).
Cross-Reactivity of the Antibodies
SUDV Gulu and MARV GP proteins were expressed by the
booster MVA vaccine, which may have stimulated cross-reactive
clones. We looked for cross-reactivity of our collection of anti-
bodies to glycoproteins of EBOV Mayinga 1976 (AF086833)
and to other Ebola virus species—BDBV (NC_014373.1) and
SUDV Gulu (NC_006432.1). Although there is only 55% and
65% sequence homology to SUDV and BDBV GP protein
sequences (Figure S4), it is notable that of 82 antibodies selected
for binding to EBOV glycoprotein, 20 were cross-reactive
in binding to some level on the glycoproteins of Bundibugyo
and Sudan species expressed in MDCK-SIAT1 cell (Figures 4A
and 4B). Of the subset of neutralizing or protective antibodies
(Figure 6F), we identified examples that were cross-reactive in
binding to BDBV and SUDV GP-specific for the base (66-4-
C12, 6651, 6541), glycan cap (040), the b17-18 loop amino
acids 286–293 (66-3-9C), and the RBR (6662) (Figure 4C). It is
evident that pan-Ebolavirus antibodies to the fusion loop can
also be isolated (Zhao et al., 2017; Furuyama et al., 2016; Wec
et al., 2017), however, we have not delineated this epitope in
our study.
Diversity in Gene Usage and Affinity Maturation
Twenty-three VH genes encoded the 82 antibodies from 11 do-
nors, making the VH gene use very diverse within the collection
and within the individual donors (Figure 5A). Almost equal
numbers of antibodies possessed the Kappa (n = 39) or Lambda
(n = 43) light chain. VH 3-15 was the most commonly used germ-
line gene and it encoded 20 antibodies in 10 donors (Figure 5A;
Table S1).
Most of the antibody sequences have high identity to their
germline genes with an average of five somatic mutations giving
rise to amino acid changes (Figures 5B and 5C). This is expected
for antibodies that have been recently stimulated with minimal
engagement in the germinal center reaction, as previously
reported in the response to vaccination or infection with H7 hem-
agglutinin (Thornburg et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019). The num-
ber of somatic mutations in these Ebola antibodies is lower than
that of antibodies to seasonal influenza derived from individuals
that are likely to have been repeatedly exposed (Huang et al.,
2015; Pappas et al., 2014; Wrammert et al., 2011).
VH 3-15 and Vl 1-40 Antibodies to the Receptor Binding
Region
Overall, there was no particular favored VH gene identified
among neutralizing antibodies, which can be seen in the
response to some viruses such as pdmH1N1 influenza (Jackson
et al., 2014) and dengue (Parameswaran et al., 2013) for which
signature VH genes were identified. Interestingly, however, out
of a total of 39 mAbs for which we have identified the epitopes
(6 to MLD, 14 to glycan cap, 10 to RBR, and 9 to base), all ten
mAbs that competed with the RBR-specific antibody 114
(VH 3-13/Vk 1-27) are encoded by VH 3-15 and Vl 1-40 genes
and none by other VH genes. These ten VH 3-15 RBR mAbs
come from six donors (Figures 2D and 5A). One out of ten,
6662, cross-reacted in binding on EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV
GPs (Figures 4 and 6G).
Binding Kinetics Compared to Established Therapeutic
Antibodies
In view of the relative temporal immaturity of our collection of an-
tibodies, we measured the binding kinetics and calculated the
binding affinity constants (Figure 1F; Table S3) for a selection
of antibodies and compared these to established therapeutic an-
tibodies: 114 (RBR) and 100 (base), 6D6 (fusion loop), and c13C6
(RBR or GP1 core). The kinetics of the antibodies were similar in
range to the control antibodies (Table S4). Our measurements for
114, 100, and c13C6 gave very similar association rates but
somewhat faster dissociation rates (for 114 and 100) to those
previously reported (Misasi et al., 2016). This may be related to
the use of MLD-deleted molecules compared to complete GP
in our measurements.
Selection of Antibody Cocktails for Protection in
Guinea Pigs
We selected seven antibodies (Figures 6A and 6F) to test for ther-
apeutic protection in guinea pigs against the EBOV Mayinga vi-
rus as described (Dowall et al., 2016). We formed three antibody
cocktails from these antibodies—two EBOV-specific cocktails
and one containing antibodies that cross-reacted in binding to
BDBV and SUDV GPs. The selection of the antibodies was based
on four characteristics: (1) neutralization in our E-S-FLU assay,
because this correlated with protection of mice in the VIC study,
(2) binding independently to non-overlapping epitopes in GC,
RBR, and base, because we wished to reduce the likelihood of
selecting antibody resistant variants during treatment in vivo
(Kugelman et al., 2015), (3) protection in mice where this informa-
tion was available from the VIC study, and (4) cross-reactivity for
Bundibugyo and Sudan GPs (Figures 6F and 6G) for the group 3
cocktail, because the long term goal is to find a single treatment
that will work for these three species that cause the majority of
infections in humans.
The three cocktails were tested at a dose of 10 mg/Kg of
each antibody (groups 1–3). This dose was selected partly on
our experience with protective antibodies in influenza infection,
and also because the affinities of the antibodies, and binding
assays in vitro, suggested that 10 mg/Kg (�10 mg/mL) should
be close to saturation. The first cocktail, which we expected
to be the most potent from the evidence available, was also
tested at 5 mg/Kg total (equivalent to 1.67 mg/Kg of each
178
Cell Reports 27, 172–186, April 2, 2019
 antibody) (group 4) for comparison to ZMapp given at the same
dose. This dose was not expected to be 100% curative and
should furnish an opportunity to test for equivalence to ZMapp.
The first and second cocktails differed in the RBR mAb, where
6662 (that was highly protective in the murine challenge) re-
placed 6660. The third cocktail (group 3) was composed of
four mAbs that cross-react in binding to EBOV, SUDV, and
BDBV glycoproteins. In addition to mAbs specific for epitopes
in GC, RBR, and base, it included 66-3-9C specific for the
b17-18 loop because of its similarity to FMV09 (Howell et al.,
2017) that provided a synergistic therapeutic effect. Controls
were ZMapp at a dose of 5 mg/Kg (kindly supplied by Larry
Zeitlin) and PBS.
When tested as cocktails in the neutralization assay, groups 1
and 2 were EBOV-specific, and group 3 showed additional
partial neutralization of S-FLU coated in BDBV and SUDV GPs
(Figure 6B-6E). The control antibody 6D6 strongly neutralized
S-FLU coated in GPs from all the Ebolavirus species. Binding
of individual antibodies in group 3 to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV
GPs is shown in Figure 6G. Binding of mAb 6541 to SUDV GP
showed prozone effect.
Therapeutic Protection of Guinea Pigs by Antibody
Cocktails
Guinea pigs were challenged with 103 TCID50 of guinea pig
adapted Ebola virus in 200 mL volume subcutaneously and
treated on day 3 with the antibody mixtures by intraperitoneal in-
jection in 2 mL volume, at the Porton Down high containment fa-
cility. Animals were monitored for temperature and clinical signs
and were culled if they reached 10% weight loss and clinical

described study (Dowall et al., 2016).
The group 1 cocktail (125 + 6660 + 66-6-3) resulted in 4 out
of 6 guinea pigs surviving (Figure 7). The same cocktail given at
lower dose (1.67 mg/Kg each) in group 4 resulted in 3 out of 6
animals surviving, which was the same as ZMapp at the same
dose. In previous studies, a higher dose of ZMapp (5 mg/ani-
mal) resulted in complete survival in this model when given
by the intravenous route (Dowall et al., 2016). Survival in group 2
(125 + 6662 + 66-6-3), which differed from group 1 only in
replacement of the RBR-specific mAb 6660 with 6662, was

cal changes in surviving animals compared
to those in non-survivors (Supplemental
Pathology Report).
DISCUSSION
The antibody response to EBOV GP in
vaccinated donors was very diverse both
in terms of the range of the >23 VH genes
used to generate the 82 antibodies and
the diversity of epitopes detected. Anti-
bodies to the glycan cap were most abun-
dant (Flyak et al., 2016), but antibodies to
the RBR, base, and mucin-like domain were also common.
The diversity in the epitopes recognized in the response of vac-
cinees to EBOV GP contrasts with the response to seasonal
influenza
hemagglutinin,
where
in
some
individuals
after
repeated exposures over years, the response can be focused
onto a localized patch of the HA molecular surface (Huang
et al., 2015; Linderman et al., 2014).
The range of specificities, cross-reactivity with other Ebolavi-
rus species, and binding kinetics of a subset of the antibodies
from vaccinees, despite being relatively immature with few so-
matic mutations, were comparable to antibodies isolated from

 convalescent humans, or multiply immunized mice or macaques
(Saphire and Aman, 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Pascal et al., 2018;
Misasi et al., 2016). A similar phenomenon was seen in the hu-
man immune response to avian H7 influenza hemagglutinin after
primary natural infection or vaccination, where a subset of anti-
bodies close to germline in sequence was powerfully neutralizing
in vitro and protective in vivo (Thornburg et al., 2016; Huang et al.,
2019). Earlier work had also emphasised that high-affinity pro-
tective antibodies appeared early in the murine response to
VSV (reviewed by Zinkernagel, 2002).
We developed an assay to screen the antibodies for neutrali-
zation. This uses a single-cycle influenza core with the hemag-
glutinin coding sequence replaced with eGFP for detection of
infected cells and coated in the EBOV GP by pseudotyping
(Xiao et al., 2018). As this virus can replicate only for a single cy-
cle, and contains no genetic information from Ebola, it can be
handled in more convenient containment conditions than Ebola
virus. In collaboration with the VIC, we established that our
neutralization assay correlated reasonably with therapeutic ac-
tivity in mice (Saphire et al., 2018). We used the assay to narrow
the choice of antibodies to combine in therapeutic cocktails.
The mechanisms by which antibodies protect against Ebola
virus in vivo are not fully understood. Antibodies to epitopes
in the glycan cap, RBR, and base or fusion loop can all
neutralize in vitro and protect in vivo (Saphire et al., 2018). Sug-
gested mechanisms include blockade of NPC1 binding, pre-
vention of cathepsin cleavage, interference with fusion, and
Fc-dependent interactions with host cells (reviewed in Saphire
et al., 2018; Gunn et al., 2018). Certain base binding antibodies
have been shown to prevent cathepsin cleavage (Shedlock
et al., 2010; Misasi et al., 2016; Wec et al., 2017), and the epi-
topes bound by base antibodies are usually retained after
cleavage by thermolysin (as a cathepsin surrogate) (Figure 2C).
Antibodies that bind the glycan cap can neutralize in vitro and
provide protection in vivo, but it is not clear how this can occur
if the epitope is removed by cathepsin cleavage before GPcl
binds to NPC1. We found that neutralizing and protective anti-
bodies to the glycan cap including P6 (VIC 82) and 040 (VIC 91),
had the property that once bound to GP expressed on the
membrane of transduced cells, they remained bound after
exposure to thermolysin. This effect was specific, because
binding of the antibody 66-3-9C that binds the b17-18 loop
on the glycan cap did not survive exposure to thermolysin
treatment (Figure 3). If the GP was treated with thermolysin
first, all nine GC-specific antibodies showed greatly reduced
binding (Figures 2C and S2). A similar observation was made
recently for the GC-specific mAb EBOV-442 (Gilchuk et al.,
2018). Although not definitive, these results suggest that
some antibodies bound to the glycan cap may neutralize either
through interference with cathepsin cleavage or by stabilizing
the
glycan
cap
in
the
bound
state
despite
thermolysin
cleavage.
Due to the high mutation frequency of Ebola virus (Carroll et al.,
2015; Alfson et al., 2015), mAbs, even when given in combina-
tion, can select escape mutants during treatment of non-human
primates (Kugelman et al., 2015). Therefore, we aimed to find
sets of neutralizing antibodies that bound independently to sites
in the glycan cap, receptor binding region, and base of GP, to
limit the selection of resistant mutants and maximize the likeli-
hood of combining several mechanisms of protection. From 82
antibodies isolated from 11 vaccinated donors, we formed three
antibody cocktails. Groups 1 and 2 were selected for their
apparent strength of neutralization in vitro and protection in the
mouse infection assay performed within the VIC study (Saphire
et al., 2018). Neither of these cocktails provided complete pro-
tection, and therefore it is possible they selected resistant
escape viruses. We intend to sequence the viral RNA from the
tissues of these animals in a follow up study.
Group 3 was selected first on the level of cross-reactivity in
binding between the GPs from the three Ebola virus species
Zaire, Bundibugyo, and Sudan and second on their neutraliza-
tion and mouse protection. It is notable that cross-reactive anti-
bodies can be found that bind glycan cap, RBR, and base or
fusion loop. Treatment of guinea pigs at day 3 of infection
with the cross-reactive cocktail of four antibodies that included
040 to glycan cap, 6662 to the RBR, 6541 to the base, and
66-3-9C to the b17-18 loop, resulted in 100% protection from
a lethal EBOV infection, without weight loss or clinical signs. Viral
RNA was not detected in the tissues of these animals at post
mortem on day 21 post infection, which implies that selection
of resistant virus variants did not occur. We plan to test the group
3 cocktail for efficacy in the ferret model against EBOV, SUDV,
and BDBV virus species (Kroeker et al., 2017; Kozak et al., 2016).
The effectiveness of this combination could not have been
predicted from the in vitro neutralization or murine protection
results with individual antibodies. The b17-18 Loop-specific anti-
body 66-3-9C is closely related to the FVM09 antibody (Keck
et al., 2015; Howell et al., 2017) isolated from cynomolgus
macaques. FVM09 is specific for the conserved exposed loop
between beta strands 17 and 18 with the sequence GEWAFWET
and by itself is not neutralizing in vitro and was only weakly
protective in vivo. However, FVM09 in mixtures enhanced the
binding and neutralization by base antibody 2G4, and the GC-
specific antibody m8C4 (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Howell et al.,
2017). In vivo FVM09 enhanced protection by the GC-specific
antibody m8C4 (Howell et al., 2017) and a fusion loop-binding
antibody FVM02p (Keck et al., 2015). A structural analysis of
the synergistic effect of FVM09 with a base-binding antibody
ADI-15946 suggests that FVM09 peels the GEWAFWET loop
away from the binding site for ADI-15946 and thus enhances
its capacity to bind and neutralize (West et al., 2018). 66-3-9C
is specific for the same sequence as FVM09 (Figure 2B), does
not neutralize in vitro, and provides only modest protection in vivo
in the mouse (4 out of 10 survivors). We also saw reciprocal

 enhanced binding between 66-3-9C and the base antibodies
c2G4 and c4G7, but this did not extend to enhanced neutraliza-
tion in our assay. However, the profound therapeutic effect of the
mixture of antibodies containing 66-3-9C suggests it may have
had a synergistic effect in vivo. Antibodies to the conserved
loop between the b17-18 strands may be a generally useful addi-
tion to therapeutic mixtures of antibodies.
In summary, we have shown that an experimental Ebola virus
vaccine trial offers a valuable opportunity for the isolation of
potentially therapeutic human mAbs. We suggest that isolation
of mAbs should accompany all experimental vaccine trials for
emerging pathogens, for which specific therapies are lacking.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Ethics Statement
Human PBMC samples used here are from the EBL01 study described in detail in Ewer et al. (2016). The study received ethical
approval from the United Kingdom National Research Ethics Service, the Committee South Central-Oxford A (reference
14/SC/1256), Committee South Central – Oxford A (OXREC A; Ref: 14/SC/1256), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA; Ref: 21584/0334/001-0001) and the Oxford University Clinical Trials and Research Governance team, who moni-
tored GCP compliance. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) provided safety oversight. The volunteers signed writ-
ten consent forms and consent was verified before each vaccination.
Animal studies were performed under Containment Level 4 conditions with all procedures being undertaken according the United
Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Studies were conducted under Establishment License reference PEL PCD
70/1707 with Project License PPL 30/3247. Studies were approved by the Public Health England ethics committee and the Project
License approved by a UK Home Office inspector.
Human PBMC
PBMC samples were obtained from the human vaccinees who received ChAd3 EBOZ vaccine and booster dose of MVA-BN Filo
(Table S5), as a part of EBL01 trial (Ewer et al., 2016). The vaccine components are included in Key Resources table. Participants
were healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years. The study included approximately equal numbers of male and female par-
ticipants. However, our study was blinded to age and gender of the 11 volunteers who donated samples for isolation of antibodies.
Guinea Pigs challenge studies
Thirty-six female Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (HsdDhl) weighing between 220–300 g (3-5 weeks old), were purchased from a UK home
office approved breeder and supplier (Marshall BioResources). Guinea pigs were cared for and handled in the category 4 lab at Public
Health England, Porton Down, according to the guidelines for the species. Animals were monitored at least once a day for food and
water consumption and given environmental enrichment relevant to the species. Cages were cleaned out completely at least once a
week with a complete bedding material change. Animals were kept in pairs and were randomly assigned to experimental groups prior
to the start of the study. The guinea pigs were implanted with a temperature and identity chip during a five-day acclimatization period.
All guinea pigs were challenged with 103 TCID50 of guinea pig adapted Ebola virus in a volume of 200 mL via the subcutaneous
route. During the course of the study, weights and temperatures were collected at least once daily and clinical scores assessed
at least twice a day. Animals which met predefined endpoints (20% weight loss; 10% weight and moderate clinical signs; or immo-
bility) were culled by a Schedule 1 approved method. Antibody cocktails were prepared a day before administration. Antibodies were
delivered 3 days post-challenge via the intraperitoneal route in a volume of 2 mL (n = 6/group). As a positive control, ZMapp was given
in a dose of 5 mg/Kg per animal. Untreated animals were given 2 mL PBS.
Cell Lines
HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) was obtained from the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, and MDCK-SIAT1 (Madin
Darby Canine kidney – sialltransferase) cells were obtained from ATCC. Both the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
They were incubated at 37�C with 5% CO2. Expi293F cells were purchased from Life Technologies and used according to manufac-
turer’s protocol. Viruses were expanded in MDCK-SIAT1 cells transduced to express various Ebola GPs in Virus Growth Medium
(VGM; DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 2 mM glutamine, 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10mm HEPES
buffer).
MDCK-SIAT cells expressing Ebola GP and MLD-deleted GP
The codon optimized GP gene sequences were ordered from Geneart. The GP genes were cloned in to a Lenti virus vector pHR-SIN
(Demaison et al., 2002). MDCK-SIAT1 cell lines (Matrosovich et al., 2003) were transduced with disabled Lenti virus produced in
HEK293T cells to express the glycoprotein. Transduced cells were stained with specific mAbs and FACS sorted for maximal surface
expression. MLD-deleted GP had amino acids 313-463 removed.
Viruses
Ebola pseudotyped influenza viruses (S-FLU) were generated as previously described in detail (Xiao et al., 2018). Human codon
optimized cDNA encoding Ebola virus glycoproteins (mentioned in Key Resources Table) were synthesized by Geneart, Life Tech-
nologies. Influenza pseudotyped viruses were propagated and grown in MDCK-SIAT1 cell lines transduced with disabled lentivirus to
express the surface Ebola virus glycoprotein. These viruses were titrated using the expression of eGFP as a reporter. The virus was
titrated to give at least a 4 fold difference between infected and uninfected cells.
Ebola virus (strain Yambuku-Ecran, previously known as ME718 (Kuhn et al., 2014) adapted to cause lethal disease in guinea pigs
through sequential passage. The virus was passaged five times to achieve lethality in guinea pigs (Dowall et al., 2014).

 METHOD DETAILS
Isolation of mAbs from plasmablasts
Antibodies were isolated by FACS sorting, PCR and antibody variable gene cloning of a single B cell plasmablast from eight vacci-
nated human individuals using the previously described methods (Tiller et al., 2008; Wrammert et al., 2008), with a few modifications.
Briefly, PBMC were incubated with a cocktail of antibodies to CD3 (PB; UCHT1; BD PharMingen), CD20 (APC-H7; 2H7; BD
PharMingen), CD19 (FITC; H1B19; BD PharMingen), CD27 (PE-Cy7, M-T271; BD PharMingen), CD38 (PE-Cy5, HIT2; BD
PharMingen) and IgG (BV605, G18-145; BD PharMingen). For a few sorts, Ebola GP protein (10 mg/mL) and a known biotin-
labeled anti-MLD antibody (10 mg/mL) were used to sort antigen specific B cell plasmablasts. Single cells with the phenotype of
CD3- CD20-/low, CD19+, CD272+, CD382+, IgG+ were sorted on a FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Single cells were sorted
into 96-well PCR plates containing lysis buffer followed by single cell RT-PCR. Nested PCR was slightly modified to existing methods.
Overlapping bases (approx. 20 nucleotides) were added on to existing 50 and 30 primers without interfering the restriction sites, which
could be used as a back-up, to enable digestion free Gibson cloning. PCR products were purified in a QIAGEN 96-well system and
the inserts were assembled with cut plasmid in the Gibson mix (NEB). Two mL of assembled product was used to transform 10 mL
DH5a E. Coli (NEB, C2987) in 96-well plates. Three colonies for each heavy and light chain were grown in a 96-well plate format
and purified using QIAGEN Turbo 96 miniprep kit. Plasmids were eluted using 100 mL TE buffer. Transfection of 293T cells with heavy
and light plasmids (�200 ng of each with 120 mg/mL linear PEI, in 250 mL total volume) and immunofluorescence assays were also
performed in a 96-well tissue culture plate.
Isolation of mAbs from memory B cells
PBMCs harvested 28 days after vaccination boost from three volunteers was collected. B cell culture screening was performed using
a method similar to that described by Tickle et al. (2015). Human B cell cultures were prepared using 132 3 96-well plates at a cell
density of approximately 5000 cells per well. After 7-days culture, screening was performed. Briefly, the presence of Ebola glycopro-
tein-binding antibodies in B cell culture supernatants was determined using a homogeneous fluorescence-based binding assay
performed on a Applied Biosystems 8200 cellular detection system device using MDCK cells stably transfected to express surface
Ebola glycoprotein. Binding was revealed with a goat anti-human IgG Fcg-specific Dylight 649 conjugate (Jackson). Following
primary screening, positive supernatants containing reactive antibody were consolidated on 96-well bar-coded master plates and
B cells in cell culture plates frozen at �80�C. Master plates were then screened in a further homogeneous fluorescence binding assay
to confirm that the antibodies bound the Ebola glycoprotein-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells and not the parental MDCK-SIAT1 cells.
The Fluorescent Foci method (US Patent 7993864/ Europe EP1570267B1) (Clargo et al., 2014) utilizing Ebola glycoprotein-ex-
pressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells was used to identify and isolate antigen-specific B cells from positive wells, and specific antibody
variable region genes were recovered from single cells by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using heavy and light chain variable
region-specific primers. PCR primers contained restriction sites at the 30 and 50 ends allowing cloning of the variable region into a
human IgG1 (VH), human kappa (Vk) or human lambda (Vl) mammalian expression vector. Heavy and light chain constructs were
co-transfected into Expi293F cells using Expifectamine 293 (Thermo Fisher) and recombinant antibody expressed. After 6 days
expression, supernatants were harvested, and antibody rescreened for selectivity using the specificity assays described above. Anti-
body was purified from conditioned media using affinity chromatography and characterized further.
Immunofluorescence Binding Assays
Immunofluorescence assay was done to screen the binding of antibodies in culture supernatant to Ebola glycoprotein. A 96-well plate
was coated overnight with stable transduced MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing Ebola glycoprotein (E-SIAT cells). Antibody supernatant
(50 mL) was incubated with a monolayer of E-SIAT cells. After 1 h incubation at RT, plates were washed with PBS. A secondary anti-
body goat anti-human IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor647 (A21445; Thermo Fisher; 1:400) or FITC (H10301; Life technologies; 1:160)
was added to wells and let incubate for 1 h in dark. Plated were then washed with PBS and fixed with 1% formalin. Fluorescence was
observed under the fluorescence microscope and quantified using the Clariostar plate reader (BMG Labtech). GP binding antibodies
and influenza antibodies were used as positive and negative controls respectively.
Expression and Purification of Antibody
Antibodies were expressed in HEK293 or Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) by co-transfection with heavy and light plasmids. Antibodies
were purified from harvested cell supernatant using protein A Sepharose (P3391; Sigma) or MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare,
17-5438-01). The column was washed with Tris buffered saline (TBS) and eluted with sodium citrate buffer pH 3.0 – 3.4. Elution pools
were neutralised with 2 M Tris/HCl pH 8.0 and absorbance read at 280 nm. Samples were then buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4
using Amicon Ultra Spin columns with a 30K cut off membrane (Millipore, UFC903096) and centrifugation at 4000 g.
mAbs used for guinea pig protection were expressed in 293T cells and affinity purified by the Absolute Antibody Ltd. and provided
at 15 mg/mL which were aliquoted and kept at �80�C until used.

 Expression and purification of soluble glycoproteins
EBOV GP (aa1-650 only; aa650-676 deleted) with four amino acid C-tag (EPEA) at C terminus was expressed in HEK293E cells
(2x106 cells/mL) using PEI transfection. Cells were incubated at 37�C, 8.6% CO2, 130 rpm for 6 days in Expi293 expression media
(GIBCO). Supernatant was concentrated by tangential flow filtration and 10 kDa membrane (Millipore). Glycoprotein was purified by
affinity chromatography using CaptureSelect C-tag Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher), eluted in 2 M MgCl2, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4; followed
by size exclusion chromatography in tris-buffered saline using a HiLoad Superdex16/600 200 pg column (GE Healthcare).
Virus Neutralisation Assays
Neutralisation assays were done as previously described (Xiao et al., 2018). Ebola pseudotyped influenza virus (E-S-FLU) diluted in
virus growth medium (VGM) was incubated with mAbs in serial dilution in PBS for 2 h at 37�C. Antibodies and virus both were in
50 mL volume. After 2 hours, 100 mL of MDCK-SIAT1 cells (3x104) diluted in VGM were then added to each well. Cells were incubated
for 20-24 h at 37�C, 5% CO2. Next day, the medium was removed from the well and the cells were fixed with 10% formalin for at least
30 min after which the wells were washed with PBS and stored in 100 mL PBS at 4�C. Once fixed, the plates can be read anytime. The
eGFP signal was found to be stable up to six months as long as the plate has not dried. The eGFP fluorescence was read using the
Clariostar plate reader (BMG Labtech). The settings in Clariostar plate reader were: fluorescence excitation at 483 nm (bandwidth of
8 nm), emission at 515 nm (bandwidth of 8 nm) with a 499-nm dichroic filter. Each well had 50 flashes at a 4-mm diameter and fluo-
rescence readout from the top optic, giving the orbital averaging value. The gain was fixed to 2000 and the focal-length was adjusted
for every experiment, which was between 4.5 – 5.5. Virus only and medium only controls for maximum and minimum signals were
included. Percent infection was calculated based on the wells containing virus only and medium only. Inhibitory concentration at
50% and 90% was derived by linear interpolation.
Epitope Mapping using Competitive Binding Assays
Competition binding assay was performed to find out if a known/reference antibody with a defined binding site is blocked by the
testing antibody and vice versa. Antibody was biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (21327; Life Technologies). Biotin-
labeled antibody and competing mAb (in 10-fold excess over biotin-mAb) were mixed and transferred to a monolayer of E-SIAT
cells. After 1 h incubation, cells were washed. A second layer of Extravidin-FITC (E2761; Sigma; 1:400) or Extravidin Peroxidase
(E2886; Sigma; 1:1600) or Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (S21374; Thermo Fisher; 1:400) was then added for 1 hour. Cells were
washed three times and then binding was detected. When using a fluorescent second layer, cells were fixed in 1% formalin
and fluorescence was quantified on the Clariostar Plate reader. When Extravidin-Peroxidase was used, signal was developed
by adding OPD substrate (P9187; Sigma) and the reaction stopped with 50 ml 1 M H2SO4. We found Streptavidin Alexa Fluor
647 preferable because it gave a better signal to background ratio in the plate reader. Mean and 90% confidence interval of eight
replicate measurements were calculated. Self-blocking (minimum signal), PBS (background fluorescence) and a non-competing
antibody (influenza mAb or a mAb to the mucin-like domain; maximum signal) were used as controls. The competition was
measured as: (X– Min binding)/(Maximum binding – Minimum binding), where X = Binding of the biotinylated mAb in presence
of competing mAb, Minimum binding = Blocking of the biotinylated mAb by self or background binding, Maximum binding = Bind-
ing of biotinylated mAb in presence non-competing mAb.
Epitope Mapping using Yeast Peptide-Display Assays
Epitope mapping of the mAbs was carried out based on the yeast surface display (YSD) library as previously described (Zuo et al.,
2011; Guo et al., 2015). Briefly, the combinatorial fragment library of Zaire Ebola GP was constructed and displayed on the surface of
yeast for antibody staining and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Specifically, the full-length GP gene was digested and
PCR-reassembled into a range of 100-900 bp fragments, the reassembled fragments were gel purified and cloned into yeast surface
display vector. The cloned products were then transformed into competent yeast cell line EBY100 using electroporation. The yeast
library was induced and incubated with each of the Ebola mAbs and positive sorted by FACS using Aria III (BD, USA). The sorted
positive yeast clones displaying the respective antigenic fragments were harvested and the plasmids encoding the corresponding
fragments were extracted and subjected to sequencing and sequence analysis.
Binding Kinetics using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Binding kinetics of antibodies to both monomeric and trimeric Ebola virus glycoprotein ectodomain was assessed by SPR using a
Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare), whereby antibody was captured on a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare) via immobilized anti-hu-
man IgG Fc specific polyclonal antibody, followed by successive titration of glycoprotein. Resulting sensorgrams were analyzed to
determine association and dissociation rate constants over a range of GP concentrations.
Affinity purified polyclonal goat F(ab)2 anti-human IgG Fc (Jackson, 109-006-098) was immobilized following activation of test and
reference flow cells by injection of 50 mL of a fresh mixture of 50 mM N-hydroxysuccimide and 200 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-
propyl)-carbodiimide at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. Polyclonal at 50 mg/mL in 10 mM acetate pH 5.0 buffer was injected (50 mL) over the
test flow cell and both test and reference flow cell surfaces were then deactivated with a 50 mL pulse of 1 M ethanolamine.HCl pH 8.5.
Binding assays were carried out at 25�C in HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05%
Surfactant P20, GE Healthcare). Antibodies were diluted to 10 nM in HBS-EP and concentrations of monomeric and trimeric
Cell Reports 27, 172–186.e1–e7, April 2, 2019
e5
 GP were prepared in HBS-EP between 5 and 500 nM. The latter were tested separately for each antibody in a series of sensorgram
cycles, where 10 mL of antibody was injected at 10 mL/min followed by 90 mL of GP at a flow rate of 30 mL/min to generate an asso-
ciation phase of 180 s. After monitoring a dissociation phase of 300 s the chip was regenerated at the end of each cycle by successive
injections of 10 mL 40 mM HCl, 5 mL 5 mM NaOH and 10 mL 40 mM HCl. Sensorgrams provided a record of response unit difference
between the test and reference flow cells. For each antibody buffer control cycles were interspersed between GP cycles to allow for
drift correction; also, antibody blank cycles were run at each GP concentration to allow correction for any non-specific binding of
glycoprotein
Sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation Software (version 4.1.1, GE Healthcare). After subtraction of respective buffer
control and antibody blank cycles, kinetic parameters describing association and dissociation rate constants were determined using
the Langmuir binding model. Affinity constants were calculated from the mean log KD values determined over 5 concentrations of
glycoprotein.
Thermolysin Digestion
It is known that GP proteolysis by cathepsins removes the mucin-like domain and glycan cap, and is essential for binding of GP to
NPC1 receptor (Chandran et al., 2005; Schornberg et al., 2006; C^
ote
´ et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012). Thermolysin mimics cathepsins
and the proteolytic activity is active at physiological pH whereas cathepsins require strongly acidic pH, which is toxic to living cells.
Thermolysin (P1512; Sigma) was dissolved in HM buffer (20 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl and 20 mM MES and pH adjusted to 7.5).
EBOV glycoprotein expressing cells (E-SIAT) were trypsinised from the flask and treated with 0.25 mg/mL thermolysin diluted in
HM buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2 for 1 hour at 37�C. Then cells were washed with PBS and passed through a cell strainer as cells
tend to form clumps after thermolysin treatment. To analyze antibody binding to thermolysin treated GP, 25 mg/mL antibody was
incubated with cells for 1 h. Alexa fluor 647 conjugated anti-human IgG (A21445; Life Technologies; 1:400) was used for binding
detection in FACS (Attune; Life Technologies). Antibody binding to untreated GP expressing cells handled in similar manner was
done in parallel for binding comparison. Log difference of binding geometric mean fluorescence intensity was calculated. Thermo-
lysin treatment, without prior use of trypsin, was also performed in triplicate in 96 well plates.
To confirm the complete digestion of GP by thermolysin, immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by western blot. Using the
same above conditions, MDCK-SIAT1 or E-SIAT cells were treated with thermolysin. The cells were lysed for 20 min in NP40 lysis
buffer, and immunoprecipitated using antibody P6 (15 mg/ml) and 100 mL Protein A Sepharose (Sigma, P3391). After wash, the protein
A Sepharose beads were eluted in sample loading buffer and run on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. This was blotted onto nitrocellulose
membrane, probed with biotinylated 66-3-9C antibody and developed with Extravidin-HRP (Sigma, E2886).
PCR of guinea pig tissues
Blood samples were taken in RNAprotect animal blood tubes (QIAGEN, UK) and samples of spleen and liver collected in RNAlater
tubes (QIAGEN, UK) and stored at �80�C until processing. For processing of tissue samples, samples were thawed and homoge-
nized through a 500 mm mesh in a Netwell plate (Corning, UK). Tissue homogenate and blood tubes were centrifuged at 500 g to
remove cellular debris. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, UK) and eluted in 50 mL RNase-free water.
An Ebola Zaire strain specific real-time RT-PCR assay was utilized for the detection of viral RNA with primer and probe sequences
adopted from a published method (Trombley et al., 2010); with in-house optimization and validation performed to provide optimal
mastermix and cycling conditions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit
(Life Technologies, UK). The final mastermix (15 mL) comprised 10 mL of 2x Reaction Mix, 1.2 mL of PCR-grade water, 1 mL of
each primer (EBOV F565 and EBOV R640 both at 18 mM working concentration), 1 mL of probe (at 4 mM working concentration)
and 0.8 mL of SSIII enzyme mix. Five mL of template RNA was added to the mastermix in order to give a final reaction volume of
20 mL. The cycling conditions used were 50�C for 15 minutes, 95�C for 5 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95�C for 10 s and
60�C for 40 s with a final cooling step of 40�C for 30 s. Quantification analysis using fluorescence was performed at the end of
each 60�C step. Reactions were run and analyzed on the QuantStudio Real-Time Platform (Life Technologies, UK) using software
version 1.2. Quantification of viral load in samples was performed using a dilution series of quantified RNA oligonucleotide (Integrated
DNA Technologies).
Histological analysis of guinea pig samples
Samples of liver and spleen were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 21 days and processed routinely to paraffin wax.
Sections were cut at 3–5 mm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined microscopically. For immunohistochemistry,
sections were stained for EBOV antigen using the Leica BondMax (Leica Biosystems) and the Leica Bond Polymer Refine Detection
kit (Leica Biosystems). An antigen retrieval step was included for 10 minutes using the Bond Enzyme Pretreatment kit, enzyme
3 (3 drops). A rabbit polyclonal, anti-EBOV antibody (IBT Bioservices #0301-015) (dilution 1:2000) was incubated with the slides
for 60 minutes. DAB chromogen and hematoxylin counterstains were used to visualize the slides.
Gene family usage of IgG genes
The gene family usage of the variable region of the human IgG heavy- and light-chains was analyzed using IMGT/V-Quest. Phylogeny
tree was drawn based on MUSCLE alignment and Neighbor joining settings using MEGA version 7.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For animal studies, Kaplan Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Prism 7 software
(GraphPad). P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. For neutralization, each data point is an average of duplicates
from one experiment. Several data points from many experimental repeats are shown in the graph. MN titers were expressed as
50% or 90% maximal effective concentrations derived by linear interpolation from neighboring points in the titration curve. Geometric
Mean Fluorescence Intensity (GMI) was quantified for FACS binding using FlowJo (Treestar).
