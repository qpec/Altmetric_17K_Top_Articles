Mechanical forces generated by fetal kicks and movements result in stimulation
of the fetal skeleton in the form of stress and strain. This stimulation is known to
be critical for prenatal musculoskeletal development; indeed, abnormal or
absent movements have been implicated in multiple congenital disorders.
However, the mechanical stress and strain experienced by the developing
human skeleton in utero have never before been characterized. Here, we quan-
tify the biomechanics of fetal movements during the second half of gestation by
modelling fetal movements captured using novel cine-magnetic resonance
imaging technology. By tracking these movements, quantifying fetal kick
and muscle forces, and applying them to three-dimensional geometries of
the fetal skeleton, we test the hypothesis that stress and strain change overonto-
geny. We find that fetal kick force increases significantly from 20 to 30 weeks’
gestation, before decreasing towards term. However, stress and strain in the
fetal skeleton rises significantly over the latter half of gestation. This increasing
trend with gestational age is important because changes in fetal movement pat-
terns in late pregnancy have been linked to poor fetal outcomes and
musculoskeletal malformations. This research represents the first quantifi-
cation of kick force and mechanical stress and strain due to fetal movements
in the human skeleton in utero, thus advancing our understanding of the bio-
mechanical environment of the uterus. Further, by revealing a potential link
between fetal biomechanics and skeletal malformations, our work will
stimulate future research in tissue engineering and mechanobiology.
1. Introduction
Fetal movements during pregnancy have long been of interest to the scientific and
medical communities, as well as to society at large. In humans, the first fetal
movement that is observed is a bending of the head and neck at 10 weeks [1], fol-
lowed by a full range of movements (whole-body movements, limb movements,
breathing and stretching) that occur regularly from 15 weeks [2]. Maternal sen-
sation of these movements usually begins between 16 and 18 weeks [2]. While
the number of fetal movements is thought to change over time, the precise fre-
quency is much debated and remains poorly understood. Several studies report
a peak in the frequency of movements during the second trimester, followed by
a decrease in frequency towards full term [3–6], while other researchers find
decreases in movements over gestation [7,8]. Sudden changes in fetal movements
can be indicative of fetal compromise, and reduced fetal movement can signify
fetal distress that necessitates urgent delivery [9,10]. Decreased fetal movements

 approaching term correlate with poor fetal outcomes, such as
low birth weight or preterm delivery [11,12], as well as fetal
death [10,13].
Fetal movements are known to play a significant role in
normal musculoskeletal development (reviewed in [14]), likely
because the resulting muscle forces generate stress and strain
within the fetal skeleton that stimulates the developing skeletal
tissues. Abnormal skeletal development has been observed
clinically in cases of neuromuscular disorders that result in
reduced or absent fetal movement, with patients presenting
skeletal malformations such as joint fusions, craniofacial
abnormalities and hypo-mineralized bones [15–17]. Fetal
akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), for example, is a
rare syndrome (1 : 15 000) in which fetal movement is absent
[18] and leads to thin bones, multiple joint contractures,
spinal abnormalities and clenched hands [19,20]. Arthrogrypo-
sis (1 : 3000), a congenital syndrome characterized by bent or
abnormally angled joints in multiple body parts, and in some
cases congenital scoliosis, is also associated with decreased
and absent fetal movements at various gestational ages
[21–26]. A relatively common joint abnormality (1.3 : 1000),
known as developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) [27], is
indicated by instability, malformation or dislocation of the
joint formed at the junction of the femoral head and the acetabu-
lum [28]. Despite known genetic risk factors for DDH, such as
female gender and positive family history [29], common risk
factors relate to a more restrictive uterine environment for
fetal movements. Examples of these risk factors include fetal
breech position [30], oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid
volume) [31] and neuromuscular disorders [29], suggesting a
relationship between reduced fetal movement and abnormal
hip joint development in humans [14]. Finally, metabolic bone
disease of prematurity is a post-natal condition that leads to
bone softening and fractures, occurring in up to 30% of extre-
mely preterm infants (born before 28 weeks’ gestation) [32].
While nutrition plays a role in this condition, the physical
environment postnatally is dramatically different from the
uterus, and therefore changes in biomechanical stimuli, such
as stress and strain, likely contribute to its aetiology [32].
Clinical evidence for the impact of impaired fetal move-
ment on skeletal development has been reinforced by studies
of fetal mechanical stimulation in animal models, in which
similar spine, bone and joint abnormalities arise in both
immobilized chick embryos and mutant mouse embryos
with reduced or absent muscle activity [33,34], as reviewed in
[35]. A recent bioreactor study demonstrated that there is a
dose-dependent relationship between movement and joint
morphogenesis in the chick embryo [33]. Taken together, this
evidence suggests that normal prenatal musculoskeletal devel-
opment requires mechanical forces generated by active fetal
movements. Further, because joint shape has been linked to
the risk of osteoarthritis [36], the contribution of fetal move-
ments to a healthy joint shape has major implications for an
individual’s health in later life. However, given the challenges
of measuring fetal movements experimentally, little is known
about the biomechanics of these movements in human babies
and how they change throughout gestation.
A key step in the process of skeletal development is the
transduction of mechanical stimuli into biochemical signalling
that results in changes in skeletal architecture. Computational
modelling provides a method by which this mechanobiological
relationship can be investigated and attempts have been made
to model this relationship in animals. Such studies have
revealed that biomechanical stimuli correlate with cell behav-
iour and joint shape in zebrafish [37], with ossification of
avian embryonic bones [38] and with mechanosensitive gene
expression in joints of mutant mouse embryos [39]. Until
recently, movement quantification and reconstruction of fetal
skeletal
geometry
(necessary
to
calculate
biomechanical
stimuli) was not possible for human fetuses. However,
advances in fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), known
as cine-MRI scans, now allow movements of an entire fetus
to be directly observed [3,40]. This technology permits the
use of computational techniques, including finite element
(FE) analysis and musculoskeletal modelling, to quantify kick
and associated muscle forces at a particular gestational age
for the first time [41].
In this study, we build upon our previously developed fetal
movement modelling techniques by applying predicted muscle
forcesto three-dimensional fetal skeletal geometries. Wequantify
the stress and strain induced in these developing skeletal struc-
tures due to clinically observed fetal movements for the first
time. We find a significant upward trend in kick forces from 20
to 30 weeks’ gestation, before decreasing towards term. We
reveal that stress and strain increase significantly over the latter
half of gestation, which is important because changes in fetal
movement patterns in late pregnancy have been linked to poor
fetal outcomes and musculoskeletal malformations.
2. Material and methods
In order to quantify the stress and strain in the fetal skeleton due to
kicking during pregnancy, the following pipeline of computational
techniques was applied to age-varying datasets during this study:
(i) tracking the fetal movements of the joints from cine-MRI scans,
(ii) FE modelling of these movements to determine the resulting
reaction force from the uterine wall, (iii) combining the above out-
puts in a musculoskeletal model which predicts the intramuscular
forces required to generated the observed displacements, and (iv)
application of these forces in an FE model of fetal limb geometries
in order to calculate the resulting stress and strain. This compu-
tational
pipeline
is
illustrated
in
figure
1
and
electronic
supplementary material, movie S1, and the methods are described
in detail in this section.
2.1. Data acquisition
A database of fetal cine-MRI scans acquired from archived data at
Hammersmith Hospital and St. Thomas’ Hospital, London, UK,
was retrospectively analysed for those which included exten-
sion–flexion fetal kicks. A total of 341 scans from different
individuals were examined of which 20 were chosen in which
there was a clear in-plane extension of the lower limb, in order to
generate a cross-sectional study of four sub-sets of five scans at
approximately 20, 25, 30 and 35 weeks’ gestation (electronic sup-
plementary material, table S1 and movie S2). All women had
given prior consent for scans to be used in research as part of
larger ethically approved trials (Hammersmith Hospital Research
Ethics Committee/MHRA approval for IEH award 102431).
Separately, the radiology information system (RIS) at Great
Ormond Street Hospital (London, UK) was searched for post-
mortem MRI in fetuses between the gestational ages of 19–35
weeks, which included full anatomical imaging of the lower
limbs. All parents/guardians gave written consent for pre-autopsy
MRI as part of the GOSH clinical autopsy protocol, and for
research use of imaging material. Cases were excluded where
there was a known or suspected musculoskeletal abnormality,
either on post-mortem MRI or on subsequent autopsy. Six scans

 were included in this study, two from approximately 20 weeks’
gestation (a 19 and a 20 week), two from approximately
30 weeks’ gestation (two at 29 weeks) and two from approxima-
tely 35 weeks’ gestation (a 33 week and a 34 week) as shown her
in figures 2 and 3. Scan settings for all data collection are detailed
in the electronic supplementary material, table S2.
2.2. Fetal movement tracking
A custom-designed Matlab R2014b (Mathworks, UK) software
script, developed and described in detail previously [41], was
applied to track the movements of individual fetal joints
observed in in utero cine-MRI data of fetal kicking (figure 1a
and electronic supplementary material, movie S1). This tracking
software was tested previously, and found to be fully repeatable
and accurate in approximately 95% of cases compared to manual
selection by an experienced human operator [41]. Additionally,
the uterine dimensions were measured, assuming an elliptical
shape with a major and a minor axis. A series of images was ana-
lysed for each fetus, capturing the kick and contact with the
uterine wall, up to the point of greatest deflection of the wall.
2.3. Calculation of fetal kick force
In order to calculate the reaction force resulting from an in utero fetal
kick, FE simulations of the uterine mechanical environment were
developed in ABAQUS (Dassault Systemes, Ve
´lizy-Villacoublay,
France) FE software (figure 1b), detailed in a previous study [41].

 Briefly, the uterus was modelled in two dimensions as half an
ellipse, taking the two-dimensional measurements from the scans
as inputs, with symmetry boundary conditions applied at the
boundaries and using major and minor axis dimensions taken
from each scan. Mesh convergence analyses were performed to
optimize mesh density. The uterus was pre-stressed by applying
the average maximum and minimum observed intrauterine
pressures, as described previously and in the electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S1 [42]. Observed kick displacement from the
cine-MRI was applied as ramped, static loading using a probe of
the same diameter as the fetal foot. The uterine wall was modelled
as a 6.0–6.8 mm thick layer of uterine muscle depending on gesta-
tional age [43]. The fetal membrane was modelled as two layers, the
chorion and the amnion, with the outer surface of the chorion
attached to the uterine wall, while frictionless sliding contact was
assumed at the interface between the chorion and the amnion
[44]. Linear elastic, isotropic behaviour was assumed for all
materials, with elastic moduli, Poisson’s ratios and thicknesses
described in table 1 as previously [42]. These models have pre-
viously been validated experimentally [41], and a sensitivity
analysis demonstrated that a 10% increase in uterine muscle
stiffness resulted in a 3.5% increase in kick reaction force.
2.4. Prediction of muscle forces generated by fetal kicks
The fetal joint movements obtained from the cine-MRI tracking
software were combined with the predicted reaction forces as
inputs for a scaled musculoskeletal model of the fetal lower
limb in OpenSim (v. 2.4) [52], as shown in figure 1c and
described previously [41]. The displacements of the hip, knee
and ankle joints were then applied to the relevant joint markers
on the musculoskeletal model, and the reaction forces from the
FE models were applied at the calcaneus (heel bone) of the
fetal foot. The OpenSim model was restricted to planar motion
as the fetal movements selected occurred in the single plane vis-
ible in the MRI scan. Muscle forces for 19 separate muscles were
outputted from OpenSim, alongside their lines of action using a
previously developed plugin [53].
2.5. Characterization of stress and strain in the fetal
skeleton
In order to investigate the biomechanics of the fetal lower limb
during kicking in utero, sets of FE models of the fetal leg bones
were generated from post-mortem MRI scans at multiple gesta-
tional ages (figure 1d). Geometries for the pelvis, femur and tibia
were segmented using MIMICS image processing software, includ-
ing mineralized and non-mineralized regions detected on the post-
mortem MRI, and meshed using 4-noded tetrahedral (C3D4)
elements using 3-Matic software (both Materialise, Leuven,
Belgium) (figures 2 and 3). Geometries contained between 34 000
and 290 000 elements per model, with mesh refinement tools in
3-Matic used to optimize mesh quality and mesh convergence ana-
lyses performed to optimize mesh density. As no post-mortem
MRI scans at 25 weeks were available, the 20 and 30 week
geometries were scaled up or down according to published
femoral length reference values at 20, 25 and 30 weeks [54].

 These scaled geometries were then pooled to form a group of four
geometries, on which the 25 week muscle forces were applied.
Fetal geometries were then imported into ABAQUS, with all
materials assumed to be linear elastic and isotropic in nature. The
pelvis was fixed at the pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac joint,
with the femur and tibia displaced until frictionless contact
was achieved at the joints. The muscle forces predicted by the
musculoskeletal model at the end of the leg extension were
then applied at anatomical locations (as illustrated in figure 1)
and allowed to converge to equilibrium, generating stress and
strain within the models. Maximum stress and strain were
recorded as the 95th percentile values, to avoid potential artificial
stress concentrations at the interface between the mineralized
and unmineralized cartilage regions. This process was repeated
for each cine-MRI movement, and on each geometry per group.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Kicks from cine-MRI scans of five different fetuses were analysed
per gestational age group, and applied to two geometries at each
of 20, 30 and 35 weeks (n ¼ 30 load cases) and four scaled geo-
metries at 25 weeks (n ¼ 20 load cases). Statistical differences (in
maximum force, stress and strain) between age groups were
determined using an ANOVA analysis and a Tukey’s post hoc
test, with statistical significance defined as p , 0.05 (SPSS, IBM,
New York, USA). All data are expressed as mean+s.d. In order
to distinguish between effects of geometry and age, statistical
differences between scaled geometries at 25 weeks were deter-
mined using an independent two-tailed Student’s t-test, with
statistical significance defined as p , 0.05 (SPSS, IBM, New York,
USA).

in the 30 week group.

The average displacement of the uterine wall due to observed

 approximately 4 mm. Fetal kick force increased significantly
over time, from approximately 29 to 47 N between 20 and 30
weeks (figure 4b and table 2), before decreasing significantly to
17 N at 35 weeks. The mean and standard deviation of these
results, alongside average fetal femur and tibia lengths, uterine
dimensions and kick durations, are presented in table 2.
The average intramuscular force at full-kick extent is
grouped by gestational age in figure 4b. Although there was
a great deal of variation, an upward trend in muscle force
during gestation was evident among many of the muscles,
with statistically significant increases for the biceps femoris
adductor magnus, vastus intermedius and gastrocnemius
(figure 5).
At all gestational ages, concentrations of maximum
principal stress were observed in the shaft of the femur and
tibia, and at joint surfaces where contact between each fetal
bone occurred (figure 6). The greatest stresses occurred in the
mineralized diaphysis regions of the bones, and at the interface

suggesting a link between stress and ossification during devel-
opment. In contrast to stress, strain was concentrated in the
unmineralized regions near the joints and at the joint surfaces
at all ages (figures 7 and 8), indicating that these strains may
play a role in shaping joints during development.
Maximum principal stress was found to increase signifi-
cantly with gestational age for the pelvis, femur and tibia,
with stress noticeably increasing in all regions from 20 to 35
weeks’ gestational age (figures 6 and 9a). Similarly, maxi-
mum and minimum principal strains increased significantly
in magnitude over the second half of gestation for all regions
of each rudiment, as shown in figures 7–9b,c.
Finally, when a statistical analysis was performed in order
to investigate the effect of scaling the 20 and 30 week geome-
tries to 25 week dimensions, with muscle forces applied from
the 25 week fetal kicks, no significant difference in stress or

 week groups. This suggests that geometry is not the key
determinant of stress and strain over gestational age, instead
implying a stronger role for fetal kick forces.
4. Discussion
This study represents the first quantification of changes in the
biomechanics of the developing fetal skeleton due to fetal
movements, revealing an upward trend in both stress and
strain stimulation over the second half of gestation. We quan-
tify significant changes in kick force and muscle forces over
gestational time due to a simple extension movement. We
reveal that even though older fetuses (35 weeks) deform the
uterine wall much less than at younger ages, the stresses
and strains in the fetal skeleton are at least as high as at earlier
gestational ages. This research provides new insight into the
biomechanical environment in utero, and the distribution of
stimuli in the fetal skeleton suggests a role for stress stimu-
lation in ossification events and for strain stimuli in joint
morphogenesis.
The human uterus during pregnancy is an experimentally
inaccessible closed mechanical environment, so a number of
assumptions and limitations were necessary to conduct this
research. While the material properties for the uterus, fetal
membranes and fetal cartilage are non-linear and likely
change over gestation, these values were not available in the lit-
erature [41]. In reality, the viscoelastic and hyperelastic
properties would likely result in lower reaction forces, as the tis-
sues deformed to a greater degree, though this might change
with gestation as the intrauterine diameter and pressure
increase. Additionally, the lack of available post-mortem MR
scans at 25 weeks necessitated scaling of the 20 and 30 week
groups according to fetal femur length. Nonetheless, pooling
of these data does not appear to affect stimuli results as we
did not find significant differences in stress or strain between
these groups when scaled to femoral length of 25 weeks.
While the quadratic optimization cost function applied in the
musculoskeletal model is likely different for a fetal kick, it was
assumed to be the same as that for an adult, due to lack of avail-
able experimental datasets, and as they appear to be a
coordinated repeated motion. Finally, depending on the
image resolution and scan settings used, some shape infor-
mation may have been lost during segmentation, resulting in
less detailed morphologies for some samples. However, we
found relatively consistent shapes in each individual at similar
gestational ages and, as mentioned above, observed that differ-
ences in geometry do not appear to be the key factor influencing
the stresses and strains we calculated.
The stresses and strains on the fetal skeleton observed in
this study likely act as biomechanical stimuli for limb develop-
ment and morphogenesis, with various studies showing that
biomechanical stimuli correlate with cell behaviour and joint
shape in zebrafish [37], with ossification of avian embryonic
bones [38] and with mechanosensitive gene expression in the
limbs of mutant mouse embryos [39]. Therefore, the biomecha-
nical stimuli characterized in this study illuminate a crucial
missing link in our current understanding of human develop-
ing skeletal biomechanics and mechanobiology. Importantly,
this study quantifies a baseline of normal biomechanical
stimuli resulting from fetal kicking, providing new data
which can be compared to stimulation in abnormal or subopti-
mal uterine conditions. Skeletal development is ultimately a
cell-driven process, with shape and mineralization progressing
as fetal tissues respond to biomechanical stimulation, such as
stress and strain [38,55–58]. However, this stimulation is
impossible to investigate experimentally in utero in humans.
The patterns of stimulation observed in our models suggest a
relationship between stress concentrations and progressive
ossification of the fetal bones, with the highest stresses occur-
ring in mineralized regions of the long bones and in sites of
primary ossification in the pelvis. Conversely, strain levels
were highest in the unmineralized regions near the joints, indi-
cating a potential role for high strains in joint morphogenesis.
These patterns of stress and strain also provide new inputs
for
previously
developed
adaptive
mechanobiological
models of hip joint development and DDH [59,60], supplying
physiologically relevant patterns of biomechanical stimuli for
the first time. Furthermore, as the field of tissue engineering
has matured, researchers have attempted to mimic the natural
developmental processes of chondrogenesis and endochondral
ossification as a route to successful production of tissue-
engineered cartilage and bone [61,62]. Our findings provide
novel insights into the distribution and magnitudes of stresses

 and strains that may prove key to replicating developing
prenatal tissue conditions in vitro.
Of particular interest is the clear trend of the stresses
and strains increasing significantly with gestational age at mul-
tiple steps in the computational pipeline. Specifically, we
observed significantly higher kick forces, an upward trend in
intramuscular forces, and significantly higher stress and
strain stimulation in all components of the lower limb. Interest-
ingly, while significantly lower uterine displacement and
resulting kick force were observed at 35 weeks, this did not
result in decreased stress or strain stimulation. This is likely
to be due to the higher muscle forces predicted, themselves
the result of a more cramped fetal position when kicking in
late gestation. A similar trend of increasing stress and strain
with increasing developmental stage has been predicted in
the embryonic chick limb [38]. The effects of absent fetal move-
ments are clear at multiple gestational ages, as in cases of
arthrogryposis and FADS [18,21,22,25]. The current study
demonstrates for the first time that there is a steady increase
in biomechanical stimuli over gestation, suggesting that even
a period of late restricted movements, e.g. fetal breech position,
could have an impact on normal skeletogenesis and increase
the risk of DDH [63]. Indeed, one theory for why metabolic
bone disease of prematurity (leading to weak bones, prone to
fracture) occurs in severely premature neonates is that when
the last trimester of development occurs outside the uterus,
biomechanical stimulation of the skeleton would be substan-
tially different to in utero [64]. After birth, the absence of
amniotic fluid buoyancy effects means that neonates are
exposed to gravitational effects and no longer have the sur-
rounding uterine tissues to kick against, which would likely
lead to very different levels and patterns of biomechanical
stimulation in a preterm infant at (for example) 30 weeks, com-
pared to a fetus of the same age and still in utero. Combined
with the results of the current study, this suggests that higher
levels of mechanical stimulation as gestation progresses are
critical to normal skeletal formation, and that movements at
the end of gestation, though small in magnitude, are still
important for normal skeletal development.
In summary, we have quantified the biomechanics of
common human fetal movements for the first time, finding
increases in fetal kick forces and muscle forces, as well as
stress and strain in the fetal skeleton over the second half of ges-
tation. We have found increases in these biomechanical with
advancing gestational age, providing novel insight into the bio-
mechanical
environment
in
utero.
We
also
observed
concentrations of biomechanical stimuli in the fetal skeleton,
suggesting a role for stress stimulation in ossification events
and for strain stimuli in joint morphogenesis. Further analysis
of these observed trends in developmental biomechanics may
shed new light on the link between fetal biomechanics and
skeletal malformations, and provide critical novel data for
future research in tissue engineering and mechanobiology.
