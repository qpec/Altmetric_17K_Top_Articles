Meta-analysis
BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing use of long-chain omega-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids (LC-OM3), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid, and/or docosahexaenoic acid have
shown mixed results.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to update and further explore the available RCT data
regarding LC-OM3 supplementation and risk for cardiac death and to propose testable hypotheses for
the mixed results obtained in RCTs regarding supplemental LC-OM3 use and cardiac risk.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Ovid/MEDLINE for RCTs assess-
ing LC-OM3 supplements or pharmaceuticals with intervention periods of at least 6 months and reporting
on the outcome of cardiac death. Meta-analysis was used to compare cumulative frequencies of cardiac
death events between the LC-OM3 and control groups, including sensitivity and subset analyses.
RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs were identified for the primary analysis (71,899 subjects). In the LC-OM3
arms, 1613 cardiac deaths were recorded (4.48% of subjects), compared with 1746 cardiac deaths in the
control groups (4.87% of subjects). The pooled relative risk estimate showed an 8.0% (95% confidence
interval 1.6%, 13.9%, P 5 .015) lower risk in the LC-OM3 arms vs controls. Subset analyses showed
numerically larger effects (12.9%–29.1% lower risks, all P , .05) in subsets of RCTs with eicosapentae-
noic acid 1 docosahexaenoic acid dosages .1 g/d and higher risk samples (secondary prevention, base-
line mean or median triglycerides $150 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol $130 mg/dL, statin
use ,40% of subjects). Heterogeneity was low (I2 # 15.5%, P . .05) for the primary and subset ana-
lyses.
CONCLUSION: LC-OM3 supplementation is associated with a modest reduction in cardiac death.

Introduction
In recent years, several randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplemental long-

 acid (DHA), on risk for various types of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) events. Results from these studies have been
mixed, with some suggesting benefits and others showing
neutral effects.
The outcome for which both the observational evidence
on LC-OM3 intake or status and RCTs of supplementation
appears to show the most consistent association is cardiac
death.1–3 For example, Rizos et al.2 conducted a meta-
analysis of the effects of supplemental LC-OM3 on the out-
comes of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death,
myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. The only outcome
for which the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not cross
the null value was cardiac death, with a pooled relative
risk (RR) estimate from 13 RCTs of 0.91 (95% CI 0.85,
0.98). This finding is in agreement with that from a pooled
analysis of data from 19 observational cohort studies that
evaluated LC-OM3 status based on various biomarkers,
including omega-3 fatty acids in total plasma, phospho-
lipids, cholesterol esters and adipose tissue, and coronary
heart disease (CHD) risk.4 Assessment of LC-OM3 status
using these biomarkers avoids many of the issues associ-
ated with estimation of dietary intake. The overall pooled
RR estimates for fatal CHD per 1 standard deviation in-
crease in EPA and DHA biomarker level were 0.91 (95%
CI 0.82, 1.00) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84, 0.96), respectively.
Results were more consistent for fatal CHD (cardiac death)
than for total CHD or non-fatal MI.
The purpose of this meta-analysis and review of research
gaps is 2-fold. The first aim is to update and further explore
the available RCT data regarding LC-OM3 supplementa-
tion and risk for cardiac death. Secondary aims are to
briefly review the evidence regarding the effects of LC-
OM3 intake on cardiac event risk and propose testable
hypotheses for the mixed results obtained in RCTs
regarding supplemental LC-OM3 use and cardiac event
risk.
Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed for perform-
ing this meta-analysis.5 A comprehensive literature search
was conducted using the PubMed and Ovid/MEDLINE da-
tabases, which covered studies published from January
1947 through December 2016. The search was designed
to identify publications from RCTs that examined supple-
mental LC-OM3 use (as dietary supplements or pharma-
ceutical
LC-OM3 concentrates)
and
the outcome of
cardiac death. The full search strategy is included as sup-
plemental material.
Level I screening included review of all titles and/or
abstracts. Supplementary literature searches included re-
view of the reference lists of relevant articles, including
meta-analyses and the report published by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Technical Re-
view in 2016. Published reviews were also assessed to
identify studies that may not have been otherwise captured.
Full-text publications were obtained for level II review. All
search results were screened by 2 individuals (O.M.P. and
K.C.M.) minor disagreements resolved through critical
evaluation of study design.
To be included, publications were required to report at
least 1 of the following outcomes: MI (fatal), sudden
cardiac death, coronary death, cardiac death, ischemic heart
disease death, sudden cardiac mortality, coronary mortality,
cardiac mortality, or ischemic heart disease mortality. To be
included in the primary analysis, the publication had to be
an RCT with an intervention period of at least 6-month
duration and provided in the form of an LC-OM3 (mainly
EPA and/or DHA) dietary supplement or pharmaceutical
concentrate.
An a priori decision was made to exclude studies from
the primary analysis that provided LC-OM3 in a food
vehicle and studies in which the subjects had implanted car-
diac defibrillators. For the former, the reason was that the
investigators had concerns about the level of LC-OM3 actu-
ally consumed in food vehicle trials. For the latter, the
concern was for generalizability because a very small frac-
tion of the population has implanted cardiac defibrillator
devices. Sensitivity analyses were completed in which
both categories were included, and results are reported
for both the primary and sensitivity analyses. In addition,
subset analyses of the primary analysis group of RCTs
were completed to investigate possible influences of clin-
ical features such as dosage (.1 g/d EPA 1 DHA), mean
or median baseline triglycerides (TG) $150 mg/dL, and
mean
or
median
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C) concentration $130 mg/dL, secondary preven-
tion, and baseline statin use ,40%. Subset analyses thresh-
olds for LDL-C and TG were based on levels classified as
borderline high or above by the National Lipid Associa-
tion.6 Subset analyses values for EPA 1 DHA dosage
and statin usage were both based on approximate median
values for the studies included in the primary analysis.
Statistical analyses
Meta-analysis was used to compare cumulative fre-
quencies of cardiac death events between the LC-OM3
and control groups using MIX Pro, version 2.0 for the
personal computer (BiostatXL, Utrecht, The Netherlands).
The primary analysis used a random-effects model to
generate pooled RR estimates and 95% CIs as prespecified
in a statistical analysis plan. Statistical significance for
individual study and pooled RRs was declared when the
95% CI did not include the null value of 1.0 (ie, P value
#.05). Weighting was based on the inverse of the variance
of each study’s effect as described by DerSimonian and
Laird.7 RR and 95% CIs were converted to RR reduction
values using the formula (1 2 RR) ! 100.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q
and the I2 statistic.8 The Cochrane Handbook defines an I2
value of 0% to 40% as low heterogeneity, which ‘‘might not
be important’’.8 An I2 value of $40% was used to designate

 moderate or higher heterogeneity. For secondary, sensitivity
and subgroup analyses, fixed effects models were used if
the I2 value was ,40% to maximize statistical power.
Sensitivity analyses were completed that included a larger
number of studies than the primary analysis and that
included trials that either used a food vehicle or enrolled
subjects with implanted cardiac defibrillator devices. Indi-
vidual exclusion of trials one at a time was used as an addi-
tional sensitivity analysis to assess the degree to which the
findings from the primary analysis dataset were influenced
by individual trials. The presence of publication bias was
assessed visually by examining funnel plots measuring
the standard error as a function of effect size, as well as sta-
tistically by using Egger’s regression method.
Results
A flow diagram summarizing the results of the literature
search is shown in Figure 1. A set of 14 RCTs was identi-
fied for the primary analysis.9–22 For the 14 RCTs included
in the primary analysis, we used the analyzable data re-
ported for 71,899 total study participants, an approach
similar to that used by the 2012 Rizos et al.2 meta-
analysis. For 2 studies,21,22 the total number of cardiac
deaths could not be ascertained because it was not reported
in the original published article and attempts to obtain the
information from the authors went unanswered.
The 2012 meta-analysis by Rizos et al.2 included both of
these studies in their analysis of cardiac death using event
values for total cardiovascular deaths (as shown in their
Supplemental Material) and the same approach was used
for these 2 studies for the analyses reported here. As shown
in Table 1 and Figure 2, the weighted, pooled RR estimate
showed
a
modest,
but
statistically
significant
8.0%
(P 5 .015) lower risk in the LC-OM3 arms compared
with
the
control
arms.
Heterogeneity
was
low
(I2 5 1.8%) and the P value for the Q-statistic was non-
significant (P 5 .430).
A sensitivity analysis in which 1 study was excluded at a
time showed that the results were rendered non-significant
by exclusion of 2 of the 3 most heavily weighted trials, the
GISSI-Heart Failure study (weight 39.8%)17 and GISSI-
Prevenzione (weight 14.9%).21 Pooled RR estimates ranged
from 0.892 to 0.948 with exclusion of single RCT results. A
funnel plot (data not shown) for publication bias showed no
indication of substantial bias and Egger’s test for zero inter-
cept showed a non-significant P value of .197.
A secondary analysis was completed that included
results from 6 RCTs excluded from the primary anal-
ysis23–28; 3 because food vehicles were used for LC-OM3
delivery23–25 and 3 conducted in subjects with implantable
cardiac defibrillator devices.26–28 The fixed effects meta-
analysis model for all 20 trials with 83,031 subjects showed
a pooled RR of 0.929, 95% CI 0.876, 0.984; P 5 .013
(Table 2). The I2 value was 35.3% with Q 5 29.3, P 5.061.
Table 2 also shows results for secondary and subset ana-
lyses of the primary dataset of 14 RCTs. As expected
because of low heterogeneity, a fixed-effects model for the
full set of 14 trials produced similar results to that of the
random-effects model, showing an 8.0% lower incidence
of cardiac death (P 5 .011). Subset analyses of trials that
provided .1 g/d of EPA 1 DHA,10–12,15,16,18,20 had higher
mean or median levels of TG ($150 mg/dL)10,11,14,16,18,20–22
or LDL-C ($130 mg/dL),10–12,14,16,18,20,21 used LC-OM3
for secondary prevention,11–13,15–18,20–22 and for which
,40% of the study sample used statin therapy at base-
line10–12,15–18,21,22 showed numerically larger effects associ-
ated with LC-OM3 use compared with the full analysis set.
Effects ranged from 12.9% to 29.1% lower incidence in the
LC-OM3 arms vs control, and P values ranged from .043 to
,.001. Heterogeneity was low (#15.5%) for all these
models, and all the Q-statistics were associated with
P values ..31.
Discussion
The results from this meta-analysis are supportive of the
recent Science Advisory from the American Heart Associ-
ation that concluded LC-OM3 ‘‘treatment is reasonable’’
for (1) secondary prevention of CHD and sudden cardiac
death among patients with prevalent CHD; and (2) second-
ary prevention of adverse outcomes in patients with heart
failure.29 In the present analysis, the pooled RR from 14
RCTs was 0.920 (95% CI 0.861, 0.984; P 5 .015) with
low heterogeneity (I2 5 1.8%) in the primary random ef-
fects model. A secondary analysis that included an addi-
tional 6 RCTs showed results that were not materially

with

greater
heterogeneity
(I2 5 35.3%, P 5 .061). One notable feature of LC-OM3
supplementation is the low risk associated with its use.30–
32 Because of the low risk for adverse effects, even a
modest benefit is clinically meaningful.
Larger effects (all P , .05) were observed in subsets of
the primary analysis set for RCTs that used .1 g/d of
EPA 1 DHA (RR 5 0.709), had mean or median
TG $ 150 mg/dL (RR 5 0.826) or LDL-C $130 mg/dL
(RR 5 0.828), studied a secondary prevention sample
(RR 5 0.870), and in which baseline statin use was
,40% (RR 5 0.871). These results are consistent with
the hypothesis that supplemental LC-OM3 may be most
efficacious for reducing cardiac death in higher risk
individuals.
The present findings are concordant with those of
Alexander et al.,1 who found that coronary death was
significantly lower in a pooled analysis of 4 secondary pre-
vention RCTs of LC-OM3 (RR 5 0.80, 95% CI 0.64, 0.99).
The present results do not agree with the conclusions from
the 2016 AHRQ systematic review.33 However, in that
report, only the largest studies were evaluated, and exclu-
sion of smaller studies may have materially affected the
findings. Specifically, the AHRQ review identified an
outcome of cardiac death for only 4 RCTs26,28,34,35 and
did not report a pooled estimate and stated that the RCTs
of EPA 1 DHA showed ‘‘inconsistent effects’’ on cardiac
death, with effect sizes ranging from 0.45 to 1.45.
Alexander et al.1 also analyzed results from prospective
cohort studies and reported significantly lower risks for cor-
onary death (9 studies, RR 5 0.82, 95% CI 0.69, 0.98) and
sudden cardiac death (5 studies, RR 5 0.53, 95% CI 0.41,
0.67). In general, results from observational cohort studies
have suggested that higher LC-OM3 intake is associated
with lower risks for fatal and non-fatal CHD events. For
example, Alexander et al.1 showed pooled RR estimates
of 0.77 and 0.81 (both P , .05), respectively, for these out-
comes. However, their meta-analysis of RCTs, as well as
those completed by Rizos et al.2 and the AHRQ33 showed
small, non-significant reductions in risk for non-fatal
CHD events and/or MI.
Thus, for cardiac death, the aggregate RCT and obser-
vational evidence has been fairly consistent in showing
benefits of higher LC-OM3 intake, particularly in higher
risk subsets. However, the prospective cohort and RCT
results have been discordant for the effects of LC-OM3
intake on non-fatal CHD events. These observations sug-
gest several testable hypotheses that warrant exploration.
A possible explanation for the mixed results in RCTs
regarding both fatal and non-fatal CHD events relates to
dosage. In the present meta-analysis, the reduction in risk for
cardiac death was numerically larger in studies that used an
EPA 1 DHA dosage .1 g/d (RR 5 0.709) compared with
that in the overall primary study sample (RR 5 0.920 for
both the random and fixed effects models). One large RCT
completed in Japan, the JELIS trial,20 showed a statistically
significant 19% reduction in major coronary event risk with

 an intervention of 1.8 g/d of EPA ethyl esters, but no signif-
icant reduction in cardiac death. A post hoc analysis of the
relationship of blood EPA level with the treatment effect
for the primary composite outcome showed that the benefit
was mainly attributable to the subset of those in the active
treatment group who had plasma EPA levels $150 mcg/L
(approximately the top quartile).36 Dietary intake of LC-
OM3 in Japan is higher than that in the United States and
most European countries37 and the subset of JELIS partici-
pants with the highest plasma EPA levels may have been
those who consumed the EPA ethyl esters and also had a
high background intake of foods containing LC-OM3.
Mozaffarian et al. (2013) found a dose–response relation-
ship between level of plasma phospholipid total LC-OM3
quintile and CHD mortality in the Cardiovascular Health
Study (P for trend 5 .002).38 Recently, the Omega-3 Acid
Ethyl Esters on Left Ventricular Remodeling After Acute
Myocardial Infarction investigators showed that 4 g/d of
LC-OM3 ethyl esters, compared with a corn oil placebo,
significantly
improved
measures
of
cardiac
structure
(fibrosis) and function (left ventricular end systolic volume
index) when administered for 6 months after a MI.35 The
magnitudes of the benefit for left ventricular end systolic in-
dex rose with increasing quartiles of erythrocyte omega-3
level (P for trend , .0001). Taken together, the findings
from those studies, as well as those of the current meta-
analysis and that of Alexander et al. (2017),1 are consistent
with the hypothesis that higher intakes of LC-OM3 (.1 g/d
of EPA 1 DHA) may be required to observe some of the
physiological effects that could contribute to lower risks
for both fatal and non-fatal CHD events.
Only 28% of the subjects included in the primary meta-
analysis dataset participated in RCTs in which the dosage
was .1 g/d of EPA 1 DHA. Furthermore, most of the
RCTs assessing cardiovascular outcomes provided no data
on baseline and on-treatment biomarkers of LC-OM3
status; thus, it is not possible to evaluate relationships
between baseline, or on-treatment LC-OM3 status (reflect-
ing tissue levels), and event risk. Accordingly, additional
research is needed to assess larger dosages of LC-OM3 on
risks for cardiac death and non-fatal cardiac events, with
inclusion of biomarker analyses (eg, total plasma, erythro-
cyte, phospholipid, or cholesterol ester LC-OM3 levels) to
define both baseline status and change in status during
treatment.39–43
There are several pathways through which higher LC-
OM3 intake could potentially alter risk for fatal and non-
fatal cardiac events, including anti-arrhythmic effects
(particularly
arrhythmias
triggered
by
myocardial
ischemia), effects related to cardiac structure and function
(eg, fibrosis, myocardial oxygen demand), endothelial and
autonomic function (eg, vascular resistance and heart rate),
thrombosis, blood pressure, inflammation/resolution, and
lipoprotein metabolism.44 The mechanisms through which
LC-OM3 intake might alter CVD risk have been reviewed
elsewhere in detail.44 The dose–response characteristics for
most of these effects have not been fully described. Also,
the RCTs completed to date have generally not been de-
signed to test specific mechanistic hypotheses. It is possible
that dosages .1 g/d of EPA 1 DHA are required to pro-
duce clinically relevant changes in some of the pathways,
such as effects on inflammation and thrombosis.45–47
Conversely, some of the benefits associated with higher
LC-OM3 intake may be produced mainly in those with
low LC-OM3 intake or status, with little or no benefit
observed in those with higher baseline intake or status.
Such a ceiling effect has been proposed by Mozaffarian
et al.44,48 regarding effects of LC-OM3 intake on heart
rate and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia.
One well-documented effect of LC-OM3 is to lower the
circulating TG concentration, although dosages .1.5 g/d of
EPA 1 DHA are generally required to produce a clinically
meaningful change.49 A recently published meta-analysis
of the effects of TG-lowering drug therapies (fibrates,
niacin, EPA ethyl esters) on cardiac or CVD event risk
showed that the overall benefit in 10 studies was relatively
small (12% reduction), but was larger (18% reduction) in

 subsets with elevated TGs ($150 mg/dL), especially if
accompanied by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C; 29% reduction).50 Two ongoing RCTs are inves-
tigating the effects of higher dosage LC-OM3 pharmaceu-
tical products (4 g/d LC-OM3, primarily EPA 1 DHA
ethyl esters or carboxylic acids) on major adverse cardio-
vascular event rates in high-risk subjects with elevated
TGs.51,52
The results of the present meta-analysis provide some
reason for optimism because the studies in which subjects
had higher baseline TG or LDL-C concentrations showed
numerically larger benefits on the incidence of cardiac
death than those of the overall primary analysis. In addition
to lowering TGs, higher dosages of LC-OM3 have been
shown to increase HDL and LDL particle sizes53 although
EPA and DHA show some differences regarding their ef-
fects on lipoprotein lipid levels.54 EPA and DHA each
lower TGs.54,55 DHA tends to raise both LDL-C and
HDL-C, whereas EPA does neither.54,55 The clinical rele-
vance of these differences in effects on lipoprotein lipids
is uncertain at present.
In the current meta-analysis, the studies in which statin
use was low (,40% of participants at baseline) showed a
numerically larger benefit than that in the primary analysis.
More recently conducted RCTs have had higher prevalence
values for use of statins, as well as other cardioprotective
agents such as aspirin and other anti-platelet drugs, beta-
adrenergic antagonists, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system antagonists, reflecting changes in standards of care.
Because of overlap in the mechanisms of action of some of
these agents and pathways affected by LC-OM3,56,57 it may
be difficult to demonstrate a benefit of LC-OM3 supple-
mentation, especially at a low dosage, when it is added to
other therapies with established cardioprotective properties.
The results from both the present meta-analysis, and that
of Alexander et al.,1 suggest that higher risk groups may be
more likely to experience reductions in risk for cardiac
death with LC-OM3 supplementation, particularly when
provided at a higher dosage. VITAL, the Vitamin D and
Omega-3 Trial, has 25,874 men and women enrolled and
is assessing the effects of 1 g/d LC-OM3 ethyl esters, as
well as supplemental vitamin D (2000 IU/d), compared
with placebo, using a 2 ! 2 factorial design.58 ASCEND,
A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes, is another
trial assessing the effects of 1 g/d LC-OM3 ethyl esters,
with or without aspirin, compared with placebo, using a
2 ! 2 factorial design; the trial has randomized 15,480
men and women with diabetes.59 Based on the current ev-
idence base, there is reason for concern that VITAL and
ASCEND may not show benefits because the LC-OM3
dosage is relatively low53 and subjects in VITAL are at
low average risk.
A limitation of the results from the present meta-
analysis is that several of the studies included were small
or had suboptimal trial designs. For example, 2 of the
largest trials, GISSI-Prevenzione and JELIS, were not
placebo controlled. Although this does raise the possibility
of bias in ascertainment of event status, this is likely to be
less of a concern with the outcome of cardiac death than
with non-fatal events. Also, sensitivity analyses and results

*For TG and LDL-C, studies with mean or median values above the identified threshold were included in this subset.
†Secondary prevention studies are those in which the subjects had clinical evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
‡It should be noted that statin use increased with time, so the study samples with statin use ,40% were older trials, and trials in which use of other
cardioprotective agents (particularly renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists) was also less prevalent in the study samples.
xThe P value for heterogeneity based on the Q-statistic was ..05 for each model.
{Subset analyses were conducted among the 14 trials included in the primary analysis for the following criteria: .1 g/d of EPA 1 DHA, TG $ 150 mg/

kVarying doses were provided in the Von Schackey et al. (1999) study,18 so the weighted average was used in these analyses, which resulted in the
study’s inclusion in the .1 g/d of EPA 1 DHA subset analysis.

 from observational studies are generally aligned for cardiac

OM3 intake.
Summary and conclusions
The present meta-analysis of RCTs showed a modest,
but statistically significant, benefit of LC-OM3 supplemen-
tation on risk for cardiac death (8.0% in the primary
analysis). This finding supports the recent Science Advi-
sory from the American Heart Association that concluded
LC-OM3 ‘‘treatment is reasonable’’ for (1) secondary
prevention of CHD and sudden cardiac death among
patients with prevalent CHD; and (2) secondary prevention
of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure.29
Because of the low risk for adverse effects with LC-OM3
supplementation, even a modest benefit is clinically
meaningful.33
Subgroup analyses show numerically larger benefits
(12.9%–29.1%, all P , .05) in studies that used .1 g/d of
EPA 1 DHA, and in higher risk groups, including those
with greater mean or median levels of TGs ($150 mg/dL)
or LDL-C ($130 mg/dL), secondary prevention study
samples, and studies with lower baseline use of statins
(which is also a proxy for use of other cardioprotective
agents). These results suggest that additional research is
warranted to further evaluate the potential risk reduction
with LC-OM3 supplementation at higher dosages and in
higher risk samples. Future RCTs should include evaluation
of biomarkers of omega-3 status at baseline and during treat-
ment and should be designed to test specific hypotheses
about the mechanisms through which benefits might be pro-
duced. Four RCTs evaluating CVD event risk with LC-OM3
interventions are ongoing and should provide helpful
additional information to guide clinical use of LC-OM3
supplementation or drug therapy.
