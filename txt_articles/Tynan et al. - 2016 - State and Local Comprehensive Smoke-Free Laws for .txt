Exposure to secondhand smoke from burning tobacco 
products causes stroke, lung cancer, and coronary heart dis-
ease in adults (1,2). Children who are exposed to secondhand 
smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, 
acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease, more severe 
asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth (1,2). 
Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to approximately 
41,000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in 
infants each year (2). This report updates a previous CDC 
report that evaluated state smoke-free laws in effect from 
2000–2010 (3), and estimates the proportion of the population 
protected by comprehensive smoke-free laws. The number of 
states, including the District of Columbia (DC), with com-
prehensive smoke-free laws (statutes that prohibit smoking in 
indoor areas of worksites, restaurants, and bars) increased from 
zero in 2000 to 26 in 2010 and 27 in 2015. The percentage of 
the U.S. population that is protected increased from 2.72% in 
2000 to 47.8% in 2010 and 49.6% in 2015. Regional dispari-
ties remain in the proportions of state populations covered by 
state or local comprehensive smoke-free policies, as no state 
in the southeast has a state comprehensive law. In addition, 
nine of the 24 states that lack state comprehensive smoke-
free laws also lack any local comprehensive smoke-free laws. 
Opportunities exist to accelerate the adoption of smoke-free 
laws in states that lack local comprehensive smoke-free laws, 
including those in the south, to protect nonsmokers from the 
harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure.
CDC assessed laws that completely prohibit smoking in 
all indoor areas of private-sector worksites, restaurants, and 
bars. These three venues were selected because they are a 
major source of secondhand smoke exposure for nonsmoking 
employees and the public (1–3). CDC considers a smoke-free 
law to be comprehensive if it prohibits smoking in indoor 
areas of all of these three venues. Some states and communi-
ties have enacted laws with less stringent smoking restrictions 
(e.g., provisions restricting smoking to designated areas or to 
separately ventilated areas); however, these laws do not elimi-
nate secondhand smoke exposure (1).
Data on state smoke-free policies were obtained from CDC’s 
State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) 
System database.* State legislation is collected quarterly from 
an online legal research database of state laws and is analyzed, 
coded, and entered into the STATE System. Data on local 
smoking restrictions and the percentage of the population 
covered were obtained from the American Nonsmokers’ Rights 
Foundation (ANRF) U.S. Tobacco Control Laws Database.† 
This database categorizes various types of U.S. municipal and 
county laws relating to tobacco, including smoking restrictions. 
Laws included in the database are identified through various 
means, including systematic scanning of tobacco control 
publications, websites, and e-mail discussion lists and through 
partnerships with the National Association of County and 
City Health Officials and the National Association of Local 
Boards of Health. The number of states with comprehensive 
smoke-free laws during 2000–2015 was assessed. The percent-
age of state populations with local comprehensive smoke-free 
laws and the percentage of the U.S. population that lives in a 
state or community with a comprehensive smoke-free law was 
calculated using 2007 U.S. Census data.
The number of states (including DC) with comprehensive 
smoke-free laws in effect increased from zero on December 31, 
2000 to 26 on December 31, 2010 and 27 on December 31, 
2015 (Figure). During 2011–2015, only North Dakota imple-
mented a comprehensive smoke-free law. Among the 24 states 
that lack a comprehensive smoke-free law, five prohibit smok-
ing in two of three venues; five prohibit smoking in one venue; 
eight allow smoking in ventilated or designated smoking areas; 
and six lack any statewide smoking restrictions (Table 1).
In some states without statewide comprehensive smoke-free 
laws, substantial progress has been made in adopting com-
prehensive smoke-free laws at the local level (Table 2). For 
example, although West Virginia has no statewide smoke-free 
law, local laws that prohibit smoking in worksites, restaurants, 
and bars provide protection for 60.1% of West Virginia’s popu-
lation. Between one fourth and one third of a state’s population 
is protected through local comprehensive smoke-free laws in 
other states, such as Texas (36.6%), South Carolina (31.8%), 
Kentucky (31.4%), and Mississippi (24.2%). Overall, 49.6% 
of the U.S. population was protected by state or local compre-
hensive smoke-free laws as of December 31, 2015.

Nine of 24 states without comprehensive statewide smoke-
free laws also lack any local comprehensive smoke-free laws; 
eight of the nine (Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, 
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and 
Virginia) have preemption statutes that prohibit adoption of 
local smoke-free laws (Table 2) (4).§ Nevada is the only one of 
these nine states where local comprehensive smoke-free laws are 
allowed, yet none have been adopted. Although local smoke-
free laws are permitted in Georgia, Arkansas, and Wyoming, 
relatively few local comprehensive laws exist in those states.
Discussion
This report marks the 10-year anniversary of the 2006 
U.S. Surgeon General’s report, The Health Consequences of 
Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, which concluded that 
there is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke exposure (1). 
The report also found that completely eliminating smoking 
indoors was the only way to protect persons from involuntary 
exposure to secondhand smoke, and that separating smokers 
from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings 
cannot eliminate secondhand smoke exposure (1). Smoke-free 
laws have been shown to substantially improve indoor air qual-
ity, reduce secondhand smoke exposure, change social norms 
regarding the acceptability of smoking, prevent youth and 
young adult smoking initiation, and reduce heart attack and 
asthma hospitalizations among nonsmokers (1,2). Smoke-free 
laws aid smokers as well; for example, smoke-free laws increase 
smokers’ efforts to quit smoking (1,2). Although considerable 
progress has been made in adopting comprehensive smoke-
free laws during the past two decades (3), as of December 31, 
2015, half the U.S. population remained unprotected by a 
comprehensive smoke-free law at the state or local level.
In May 2016, California adopted a law eliminating 
exemptions in the state smoke-free law.¶ Those exemptions

* Smoke-free = no smoking allowed; designated = designated smoking areas 
required or allowed; ventilated = designated smoking areas allowed if 
separately ventilated.
† States with comprehensive smoke-free laws are those that require worksites, 
restaurants, and bars to be smoke-free.
§ State law allows smoking in venues that prohibit minors.
¶ Data reported as of December 31, 2015. However, California adopted a smoke-
free law in May 2016, that became effective June 9, 2016, and eliminates 
exemptions that allow smoking in certain ventilated areas of locations; 
therefore, as of June 9, 2016, California is considered to have a comprehensive 
smoke-free law.
§ In addition, although they lack any local smoke-free ordinances, the following 
states have statewide comprehensive smoke-free laws in effect, which could 
impact local enforcement of smoke-free provisions: Maine, Michigan, South 
Dakota, and Vermont.
¶ California enacted a law eliminating exemptions in the state smoke-free law, 
effective June 9, 2016. http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_0001-

previously precluded CDC from considering California’s law 
as comprehensive. When California’s law became effective on 
June 9, 2016, the number of states that have a comprehensive 
smoke-free law increased to 28. With this change in California’s 
smoke-free status, it is estimated the proportion of the U.S. 
population protected by a comprehensive state or local law 
increased from 49.6% in December 2015 to nearly 60% in 
June 2016.
Exposure to secondhand smoke is not limited to private-
sector worksites, restaurants, and bars. For example, casino 
workers are heavily exposed to secondhand smoke at work 
(5). Casinos are also not categorized as a private workplace 
in smoke-free tracking systems because they are sometimes 
excluded from laws and tracked as their own category (similar 
to restaurants and bars). In casinos where smoking is per-
mitted, studies have consistently found substantial levels of 
secondhand smoke including in designated no-smoking areas 
of such casinos (5). CDC conducted a health hazard evalua-
tion in three Las Vegas, Nevada, casinos, found nicotine and 
chemicals from secondhand smoke in the air, and determined 
that carcinogens from secondhand smoke were absorbed into 
workers’ bodies (6,7). Evidence from that evaluation led to a 
recommendation that smoking should be prohibited in these 
casinos (7). Further policy surveillance should be conducted 
to evaluate which states and communities prohibit smoking 
in casinos and other state-regulated gaming facilities, such as 
racetracks and card rooms.
Smoke-free laws can also be extended to other types of 
tobacco products, such as electronic nicotine delivery sys-
tems (ENDS), which include e-cigarettes (8). It is important 
for ENDS to be included in state and local smoke-free laws 
because indoor use of ENDS can expose nonusers to aerosol-
ized nicotine and other harmful constituents, complicate 
smoke-free enforcement, and impact the social acceptability of 
tobacco use (2,8). Currently, approximately 350 communities 
and seven states (California,** Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey, 
North Dakota, Oregon, and Utah) prohibit the use of ENDS 
in private worksites, restaurants, and bars.††
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, the STATE System and ANRF only capture infor-
mation on certain types of smoking restrictions, primarily laws 
and executive orders; therefore, this report does not include 
information on state or local administrative laws, regulations, 
or implementation guidelines. As a result, the manner in which 
a smoking statute is implemented or enforced in practice might 
differ from the way it is coded by CDC or ANRF. Second, 
because statewide smoke-free law information was based on data 
collected by CDC, and local smoke-free information is based on 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In 2006, the Surgeon General reported that there is no level of 
risk-free exposure to secondhand smoke. The only effective way 
to eliminate involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke is to 
eliminate smoking completely in all indoor areas.
What is added by this report?
The number of states that enacted statewide comprehensive 
smoke-free policies (i.e., no smoking allowed in worksites, 
restaurants, and bars) increased from zero in 2000 to 27 in 2015. 
Overall, nearly 50% of the U.S. population is protected by 
smoke-free laws. Although regional disparities remain, such as 
in the southeastern United States, substantive progress has 
been made adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws at the 
local level in some states in those areas.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued efforts to promote implementation of statewide and 
local comprehensive smoke-free laws are critical to protect 
nonsmokers from this preventable health hazard in the places 
they live, work, and gather.

, differences in how laws are interpreted 
might occur, which could alter state and national population 
coverage estimates and could increase the total population 
covered by state comprehensive smoke-free laws. Therefore, 
national population estimates can be considered conservative.§§
Considerable progress has been made at state and local 
levels in the adoption of comprehensive smoke-free laws in 
indoor public places over the past two decades. However, even 
after considering the recent change in smoke-free status in 
California, state comprehensive smoke-free adoption progress 
has stalled in recent years (9), and no states in the southeast 
have a statewide comprehensive smoke-free law. Further, some 
states without comprehensive smoke-free laws legally prohibit 
local communities from adopting such laws to protect persons 
from secondhand smoke exposure. Persisting gaps in smoke-
free protections leave large numbers of vulnerable populations 
exposed to secondhand smoke and could contribute to health 
disparities (10). Continued efforts to promote implementation 
of statewide and local comprehensive smoke-free laws are criti-
cal to protect nonsmokers from this preventable health hazard 
in the places they live, work, and gather.

§§ For example, CDC considered Colorado or New Mexico to have comprehensive 
smoke-free laws, although ANRF does not because of certain workplace 
exemptions for small employers. Therefore, population coverage estimates 
only account for 10.1% of Colorado and 36.6% of New Mexico populations. 
If these states were considered to have state comprehensive smoke-free laws, 
it is expected that the total population covered by smoke-free laws in the 
United States would increase.
