Abstract
Background: Pressure ulcers/injuries (PrUs), a critical concern for nursing homes (NH), are responsible for chronic
wounds, amputations, septic infections, and premature deaths. PrUs occur most commonly in older adults and NH
residence is a risk factor for their development, with at least one of every nine U.S. NH residents experiencing a PrU
and many NHs having high incidence and prevalence rates, in some instances well over 20%. PrU direct treatment
costs are greater than prevention costs, making prevention-focused protocols critical. Current PrU prevention
protocols recommend repositioning residents at moderate, high, and severe risk every 2 h. The advent of visco-
elastic (VE) high-density foam support-surfaces over the past decade may now make it possible to extend the
repositioning interval to every 3 or 4 h without increasing PrU development. The TEAM-UP (Turn Everyone And
Move for Ulcer Prevention) study aims to determine: 1) whether repositioning interval can be extended for NH
residents without compromising PrU incidence and 2) how changes in medical severity interact with changes in
risk level and repositioning schedule to predict PrU development.
Methods: In this proposed cluster randomized study, 9 NHs will be randomly assigned to one of three repositioning
intervals (2, 3, or 4 h) for a 4-week period. Each enrolled site will use a single NH-wide repositioning interval as
the standard of care for residents at low, moderate, and high risk of PrU development (N = 951) meeting the
following criteria: minimum 3-day stay, without PrUs, no adhesive allergy, and using VE support surfaces (mattresses). An
FDA-cleared patient monitoring system that records position/movement of these residents via individual wireless
sensors will be used to visually cue staff when residents need repositioning and document compliance with
repositioning protocols.
Discussion: This study will advance knowledge about repositioning frequency and clinically assessed PrU risk
level in relation to PrU incidence and medical severity. Outcomes of this research will contribute to future guidelines
for more precise preventive nursing practices and refinement of PrU prevention guidelines.

 Background
Pressure ulcer/injury (PrU) prevention remains a chal-
lenge within the nursing home (NH) environment [1, 2].
A PrU is any skin lesion over a bony prominence result-
ing from prolonged exposure to pressure that causes ca-
pillary occlusion and eventual tissue necrosis. Most PrUs
are avoidable, but those that do develop are associated
with complications (e.g., chronic wounds, amputations,
septic infections, and premature deaths) [3] and with
overall deterioration in prognosis, compromising both a
patient’s health status and quality of life. Estimated an-
nual treatment costs ($9.1–11.6 billion in the US [4]) are
greater than prevention costs [4–8], even without con-
sidering other costs to the individual and healthcare sys-
tem (outpatient visits, work loss, and lawsuits), thus
making prevention a priority [9].
Residence in a NH puts individuals at risk of develop-
ing PrUs [8], and the limited mobility prevalent among
NH residents [10] increases the intensity and duration of
pressure exposure – two factors leading to PrU develop-
ment [11]. The severity of illness, including signs, symp-
toms, physiologic parameters, and disease factors, also
affects the body’s response to pressure exposure and pos-
sibly increases risk for PrU development. A universally ac-
cepted approach to PrU prevention is to minimize
pressure exposure through frequent moving/repositioning
(hereafter referred to as repositioning) [12, 13] for resi-
dents clinically assessed as at-risk (typically Braden
Scale© score ≤ 18).
Over the last decade, NH PrU incidence rates have de-
clined from 11% [14] to 7.8% [15]. This decline can be
attributed to the advent of viscoelastic (VE) high-density
foam support surfaces that reduce pressure intensity by
redistributing point pressure. VE surfaces make longer
intervals between repositioning possible for at-risk resi-
dents confined to bed or chair [16]. However, in order to
further improve PrU prevention approaches [17], we
must determine 1) how frequently repositioning needs
to occur in order to prevent PrU development, and 2)
how residents’ medical severity (severity of illness), risk
level (clinically assessed risk determined by the Braden
Scale©), and repositioning frequency affect PrU develop-
ment individually or in combination. It is not known
whether a 2, 3, or 4 h time interval for repositioning of
residents is most effective in preventing PrUs.
Current PrU prevention repositioning protocols (de-
rived from two small 1962 studies [18]) recommend re-
positioning residents at moderate, high, and severe-risk
every 2 h. With VE surfaces, it may be possible to reduce
repositioning frequency by extending the repositioning
interval (time elapsed between scheduled repositioning
of residents) from 2 to 3 or even 4 h without an increase
in PrU development. In the last decade, only two studies
have
examined
repositioning
protocols.
One
study
reported fewer PrUs in residents using VE surfaces with
a 4-h repositioning interval than in residents who
used non-VE surfaces with more frequent reposi-
tioning [19, 20]. The second study, Turning for Ulcer
ReductioN (TURN) trial, found no significant differences
in PrU incidence between 2, 3, or 4-h repositioning inter-
vals in a sample of moderate and high-risk residents using
VE surfaces. In these two studies, 90% of all new PrUs oc-
curred within the first 15 days [20]. However, new PrUs
cannot be attributed to any single factor [21], and these
analyses did not comprehensively examine changes in res-
idents’ PrU risk levels or their physiological and disease
factors (medical severity).
We will examine the effects of repositioning frequency
(using assigned repositioning intervals of 2, 3, or 4 h) on
residents at low, moderate, and high risk of developing
PrUs (Braden Scale score 10-23) and will explore the ef-
fects of risk level and medical severity individually and
in combination over a 4-week intervention period. Resi-
dents deemed to be at low risk are not commonly stud-
ied, but they too develop PrUs [2, 14–16] and are
therefore included in this study. An FDA-cleared patient
monitoring (PM) system using individual wireless tri-
axial accelerometer sensors will record resident position
and movement, automate repositioning schedules, pro-
vide visual cues to nursing staff [22] via electronic dis-
play screens at the nursing station and unit hallway(s)
that indicate when each resident needs repositioning,
and confirms completion of repositioning. This system
provides a timestamp that repositioning occurred and
addresses concerns about nursing electronic medical
record (EMR) documentation compliance.
The specific aims of the TEAM-UP (Turn Everyone
And Move for Ulcer Prevention) study are to:
Aim 1: Determine differences in the incidence of new
pressure ulcers (PrU) in nursing home (NH) residents
at low, moderate, and high risk using VE support
surfaces and repositioned at intervals of 2, 3, or 4 h,
in nine randomly assigned NHs over a 4-week period,
using the patient monitoring (PM) system to determine
movement.
Aim 2: Determine how medical severity components
(as measured by a modified Comprehensive Severity
Index [23, 24]), changes in clinically assessed risk level
(low, moderate, high as measured by the Braden Scale©
[25]), assigned repositioning intervals, and their
interactions are associated with development of PrUs,
controlling for resident demographics.
Exploratory Aim: Evaluate PrU prevention intervention
approaches in NH groups repositioned at 2, 3, or 4-h
by: 1) comparing the intervention resource costs (VE
support surfaces, PM system service/sensor use, fixed
and variable labor costs for training and repositioning)
Yap et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2018) 18:54 
Page 2 of 15
 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of cost per %
reduction in PrUs, and 2) exploring staff and resident
satisfaction with intervention approach.
Significance
PrUs occur most commonly in older adults [6], and NH
residence is a risk factor [8] for development. At least one
of every nine U.S. NH residents will experience a PrU
[14, 26] and many NHs have high incidence and preva-
lence rates, in some instances well over 20% [27, 28].
The estimated cost of treating PrUs ranges from
$21,000–152,000 per PrU [29]. Effective prevention can
reduce PrU incidence and avoid treatment costs while
improving resident satisfaction, safety, and quality of
life. Residents identified as moderate- or high-risk (who
comprised 22–28% and 56–57% respectively of the NH
population in two recent studies [12, 30]) are consid-
ered most likely to develop PrUs; however, low-risk NH
residents also develop PrUs [19, 28, 31] and must be
considered in any comprehensive prevention approach.
PrUs are challenging to address, given the variations in
NH size, staffing, and resident diversity, but creating
cost-effective solutions is imperative because1 in every
5 adult Americans (some 72 million) will be > 65 years
old by 2030 and PrUs could increase exponentially [6].
PrUs remain a multifactorial problem, although the
advent of innovative products (e.g., VE support surfaces)
has minimized some risk. In order to further reduce PrU
incidence, it is important to both 1) test and challenge
current prevention protocols to identify a gold standard,
and 2) understand the intersection of multiple contribut-
ing factors to PrUs to identify additional opportunities
for improvement. Improving prevention protocols is
critical on multiple levels (i.e., individual, department, fa-
cility, society) given the cost of treating PrUs, the direct
impact on both staff and residents, and the fact that
overall costs of delivering prevention protocols is less
than treatment costs.
The TEAM-UP study challenges the idea that reposi-
tioning must be completed every 2 h to best prevent the
onset of PrUs. It builds on prior evidence from an inter-
vention study [19, 20] showing that repositioning inter-
vals may be extended from every 2 h to every 3 or 4 h
without increasing PrU incidence, and attempts to ex-
pand the evidence base for PrU prevention by determin-
ing how residents’ medical severity, clinically assessed
PrU risk level, and assigned repositioning interval affect
PrU
development
individually
or
in
combination.
TEAM-UP extends previous study periods [19, 20] to 4-
weeks (28 days) to help determine the optimal resident
repositioning interval, and will: 1) place all NH residents
on VE (high-density foam) support surfaces to avoid
point pressure and redistribute pressure, so as to enable
longer periods between repositioning; 2) enroll residents
at low risk for PrU development in addition to those
identified as moderate or high risk; 3) use a PM system
with individual wireless sensors to track repositioning
compliance with time-stamped documentation and pro-
vide repositioning reminders, while also providing auto-
matic feedback for individual nursing staff and the team
to improve communication; and 4) monitor fluctuations
in resident characteristics and risk levels, which may be
associated with development of PrUs. The study inter-
vention will be carried out by NH staff in real-life prac-
tice conditions with protocol and training support,
rather than by an external intervention team. The im-
pact of the intervention on the occupational subculture
of the nursing staff will be explored, as will the perspec-
tives of both nursing staff and residents. Nurse cham-
pions will be trained to support staff as resources for
protocol implementation and the use of the PM system
and sensors.
Methods
The TEAM-UP study is a cluster randomized clinical
trial with facility-level use of an assigned repositioning
interval as the primary intervention and will be con-
ducted at 9 NHs that are all using VE support surfaces.
Each participating NH will be randomly assigned to one
of three intervention arms. Each arm will have 3 NHs
with each NH using a single, NH-wide repositioning
interval at either 2, 3, or 4 h as standard of care during
the 4-week intervention period. Randomization will
occur at the facility level. The sequence in which the re-
positioning intervals are to be implemented will be ran-
domly ordered and, then assigned to NHs inclusive of
each arm of NHs. Thus, 3 clusters of 3 NHs are created
with randomly sequenced repositioning intervals.
A secondary cluster is created within each NH as the
NH implements its standard risk assessment protocol;
residents will be clinically categorized forming clusters
by level of risk for developing a new PrU. Level of risk
categorization into 3 groups is defined by a Braden score
of low (15–18), moderate (13–14), or high (10–12) [32].
All eligible residents will wear a wireless triaxial acceler-
ometer sensor throughout the intervention as part of the
NH’s standard of care. Residents may refuse the sensor
and can decline to move when prompted by staff as part
of their right to refuse care (see Fig. 1). This pragmatic
approach offers a unique opportunity to study a single
NH-wide repositioning schedule, thus avoiding the po-
tential for staff confusion associated with resident-level
random assignment to repositioning intervals, which
would require staff to simultaneously execute multiple
turning schedules.
Medical severity components and clinically assessed
risk level will be extracted from the EMR and examined
for
assessment-to-assessment
change,
thus
allowing

 identification of medical severity components associated
with development of a new PrU. We will use interven-
tion resource cost elements (VE surfaces, PM system
and sensor service, fixed and variable labor costs for
training and repositioning) to assess implementation
cost and calculate a cost-effectiveness ratio per % PrU
reduction. NH nursing staff will be asked to complete a
nursing culture assessment web-based survey adminis-
tered
electronically
at
their
NH
pre-
and
post-
intervention. Focus groups will be conducted using
semi-structured questions framed according to the Dif-
fusion of Innovation model to gather/assess NH staff
and resident perspectives of each group’s satisfaction re-
garding the repositioning interval and challenges experi-
enced in use of the PM system.
Additional information is available on the study web-
site (https://teamup.nursing.duke.edu).
We are funded to conduct this study from 07/01/2016
to 03/31/2021. We have completed implementation in 3
of the 9 nursing homes and additional study data collec-
tion and analyses will be completed by 03/31/2021.
Sample, setting, recruitment
NH sample
Researchers established a collaboration with a United
States, for-profit, Medicare-certified, intermediate and
skilled NH system with > 450 NHs in over 30 states. A
convenience sample of 9 NHs will be selected from vol-
unteer facilities within the system if they have > 100
beds and are using viable VE mattresses examined
2 months prior to intervention implementation, and
have full EMR use that includes activity of daily living
(ADL) documentation and laboratory and radiology
electronic results. Participating NHs must agree to im-
plement the patient monitoring system technology with
a NH-wide repositioning protocol, and agree to a
mandatory nursing staff in-service training provided by
the research team. Full-time and part-time nursing staff
(RNs, LPNs, CNAs) working clinically with residents
will participate in an NH-mandated education session
to explain the study protocol and prepare them regard-
ing PM system use. NH’s will be assigned in random
order to a repositioning interval.
The NH will give all its residents/family an informa-
tion sheet that explains the study and NH-wide adopted
repositioning protocol and informs them of their right
to refuse care and/or request a more frequent reposi-
tioning interval. The information sheet will also explain
risks, benefits, and what is involved in participation.
Resident sample
All residents (≥ 18 years old) using a VE mattress (sup-
port surface) who are without PrUs and adhesive allergy
and are clinically assessed as low, moderate, or high risk

 for new PrU development will participate in their re-
spective NH-wide repositioning frequency protocol and
receive standard PrU prevention care.
NH resident participants will include those residents
at the time of study initiation and any residents newly
admitted during the 4-week study period. All individuals
who are NH residents for a minimum of 3 days and
meet inclusion criteria will be included in data analyses,
because superficial PrUs have been reported to occur
within several hours to days following NH admission,
and “deep tissue injury”, a type of PrU resulting from
pressure on muscle and fascia is thought to appear on
the surface of the skin approximately 3 days following
exposure to pressure.
A waiver of informed consent has been obtained from
the
Primary
Investigator’s
(PI)
Institutional
Review
Board. Data on newly admitted residents with less than
a 3-day stay will not be included in the analysis, because
deep tissue injuries that result from pressure prior to ad-
mission may not be visible for up to 3 days after pres-
sure exposure. Residents will also be excluded from the
analysis if PrUs are present at baseline, PrU risk is severe
(Braden score ≤ 9), or if the resident is cared for on a
non-VE specialty surface, has “do not turn orders”
present, or has an allergy to the adhesive used on the
sensor. Residents assessed as being at severe risk of de-
veloping a PrU (estimated ≤ 10% per NH) will be ex-
cluded because they typically require specialty surfaces
and individualized and frequent repositioning, and their
health status is generally more unstable. Data on all
other residents will be included, using an intention-to-
treat approach. The target N for analysis is 951; we aim
to enroll 1100 residents at baseline. Residents who are
discharged, transferred, or die will be included in the
intention-to-treat analysis.
Staff sample for survey
(N = 1200) All nursing staff (registered nurses, licensed
practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants) work-
ing clinically full- or part-time with residents will be eli-
gible irrespective of job category at each NH. Will be
asked to complete an anonymous web-based electronic
survey via touch screen tablet.
Focus group(s) sample
Two focus group sessions (one of residents and one of
staff; six participants/ group), will be conducted at three
selected NHs (one NH per arm) to evaluate implementa-
tion and perspectives regarding approach. Using con-
venience
sampling,
English-speaking
intervention
participants will be eligible to join, irrespective of gender,
race, ethnicity, and physical ability.
1. Residents. Residents (aged > 18) who are cognitively
aware and willing to participate will be selected and
consented to participate in one focus group per
selected NH (total of three groups; n = 18 residents).
Participants may have refused sensor monitoring.
2. Staff. Nursing staff (aged > 18) working clinically
full- or part-time with residents will be selected
irrespective of job category and consented for one
focus group per selected NH (3 groups; n = 18
nursing staff).
Risk and challenges
This study design includes NHs with the same corporate
management to ensure that the same standard-of-care
protocols are in place in each NH. A major challenge for
NH research is the potential for staff turnover. Using a
successful strategy from our prior studies [31], we se-
cured a written commitment that the study will continue
even if there is a change in one or more of corporate ad-
ministrative leaders for the NH system. We also have de-
signed the study to be robust to staff turnover and
potential staff resistance to a new repositioning schedule,
by incorporating mandatory training with supplemental
on-site instruction as needed and also incorporating
training into the NH’s new staff orientations. Another
potential challenge is staff inconsistency in implement-
ing
the
repositioning
protocol
standard-of-care;
consistency in repositioning is important to being able
to subsequently demonstrate that the repositioning at
the assigned interval actually occurred [33]. In fact, in
practice, extended repositioning intervals already are
thought to be extended beyond 2 h [34, 35] and there
are longstanding concerns that nursing staff documenta-
tion may be unreliable for use as evidence of reposi-
tioning [20, 31, 36, 37]. The PM system monitoring
capabilities will enable concerns about repositioning
protocol compliance and documentation to be addressed
via time-stamped tracking of identified position changes.
The intervention
Elements
of
the
intervention
include
a
NH-wide
assigned repositioning interval 2, 3, or 4-h) with reposi-
tioning of residents using viable VE mattresses. Monitor-
ing and documentation of repositioning intervention will
be accomplished with use of a PM system. Table 1 de-
scribes the protocol components in detail.
Repositioning protocol
Residents who are in bed will be repositioned according
to the predetermined NH-wide assigned repositioning
interval of every 2, 3, or 4 h, and rotated from side to
back to side. In accordance with International PrU pre-
vention guidelines [13], residents will be positioned in
the lateral position at no more than a 300 tilt. While in

 the supine position, the head of the bed may be elevated
during feeding, but the duration of elevation greater
than 300 will be limited to avoid exposure to friction and
shear. Residents will wear pressure reduction boots if or-
dered by the NH; however, because there is no evidence
that these perform better than elevating the heels using
a pillow, the latter will be standard procedure in this
study. According to NH policy, there is a standing order
that nursing staff should assist non-bedfast residents
while in the chair to stand/move/reposition each hour to
relieve ischial pressure, preventive seating cushions will
be used as necessary according to NH guidelines. PrUs
resulting from sitting will appear on ischial tuberosities;
these PrUs are clearly different from PrUs on the
sacrum/coccyx, trochanter, and heels that occur when
lying in bed. Repositioning devices (e.g., turning sheets
or trapeze) will be used as appropriate to reduce friction
and shear, and pillows and foam wedges will be used to
maintain position according to international guidelines.
In NHs, up to 9% of long-stay residents spend the ma-
jority of most days in bed or in a chair in their room
[38]. Bates-Jensen et al. found that most residents spent
17 h a day in bed [34]. We expect, however, that 90% of
residents will be sitting for at least part of the day. Repo-
sitioning will occur during the time that residents are in
bed. Figure 2 is a visual depicting the required assess-
ment and repositioning safety and skin care check to be
performed by nursing staff and the criteria that must be
met at each decision point in implementing the reposi-
tioning protocol.
VE support surface
All NH’s VE support surfaces (mattresses) in this study
will meet or exceed international guidelines [39] for the
minimum acceptable requirements for density and sup-
port to ensure that a resident’s mattress is flexible
enough to deflect pressure over bony areas that come in
contact with the mattress. VE surfaces will be examined
2 months prior to each NH’s intervention and all mat-
tresses that are not viable will be replaced prior to study
implementation.
The patient monitoring (PM) system
A wireless system for monitoring resident position and
movement will be used to visually cue nursing staff on
electronic display screens to ensure protocol adherence
and to evaluate NH-repositioning protocol delivery fidelity
[40]. This system is used in hospitals and NHs to enable
caregivers to implement individualized repositioning pro-
tocols and it drives compliance with the care plan by
visually notifying staff when repositioning is required
[7, 41, 42]. Using a skin-sensitive medical grade adhe-
sive backing (similar to an EKG electrode), a wireless,
wearable single-patient use sensor will be placed by
nursing staff on the resident’s upper chest beneath
the clavicle on either the right or left side at approximately
the midclavicular line (at least 4 in. away from a pace-
maker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator). The indi-
vidual sensor has no on- or off-switch and activates
automatically when the opaque backing is removed to ex-
pose the sensor to light. Each sensor will be associated
with a specific resident, will have individualized reposi-
tioning parameters such as the 2-, 3-, or 4-h interval, and
will track and indicate changes in body position. The PM
system’s turn management software displays each resi-
dent’s repositioning history and current positional status
in an organized and simple way on strategically placed dis-
play screens at the nursing station and mid-point in each
hallway, making staff aware when repositioning actions
are becoming necessary or are overdue.
Treatment fidelity
Our treatment fidelity protocols use the National Insti-
tutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium’s [43]
model. To ensure intervention integrity, repositioning of
residents will be assigned to and performed by nursing
staff. Each resident’s repositioning activity will be moni-
tored with a wireless sensor and documented within the
PM system, and randomly scheduled weekly observation
will be conducted of staff turning/repositioning selected
residents (6 per week x a minimum of 4 weeks) to pro-
vide a fidelity check of the system’s accurate detection of
turning/repositioning activities. Studies and clinical data
show that the device effectively detects position changes
according to threshold parameters, like degree or angle
of position change [44, 45]. Each NH will use a single
NH-wide repositioning interval as the standard of care
for low-, moderate-, and high-risk residents. This prag-
matic approach offers a unique opportunity to study a
single NH’s facility-wide repositioning schedule, thus
avoiding the potential for staff confusion if more than
one schedule is executed within a facility. Furthermore,
each repositioning interval will be tested in three NHs
using VE surfaces, enabling replication of findings.

 Resident-level data. Resident data extracted from the
PM system database and the 12-month baseline and 4-
week intervention MDS (batch file) and EMR; each resi-
dent will be assigned a study ID number prior to data
extraction. New PrU incidence will be collected during
the intervention period. Baseline data will be collected
for 12 months just prior to intervention launch and will
consist of EMR, MDS, and PrU incidence (Table 2) data.
Intervention data extraction (of EMR, MDS, and PM
system data) will occur weekly during the intervention
4-week period. The PM system will schedule resident re-
positioning frequency and gather resident repositioning
sensor data automatically according to NH standards of
care. Data collected by each resident’s sensor will be
automatically communicated wirelessly through a propri-
etary mesh network of relay antennas to the respective
NH’s Central Monitoring Station containing turn manage-
ment software. Wireless sensor data on all monitored resi-
dents will be stored by the PM system. The wireless
sensor number will become associated with a resident

 study identifier to be created as described below. The
study ID number will be used to facilitate data compari-
sons. Wireless sensor data for all monitored residents will
be securely stored in the PM system database.
Bench testing and clinical trials of the PM system’s wire-
less sensor have demonstrated it to be a valid measure of
active and passive movement (repositioning). The sensor’s
sensitivity accuracy is +/− 2.5% consistent with the industry
standard for a linear triaxial accelerometer. Studies and
clinical data show that the device effectively detects position
changes according to threshold parameters, like degree or
angle of position change. Wireless sensor data on all moni-
tored residents will be securely stored in the patient moni-
toring system database. Wireless sensor data along with
other resident data, including EMR data, will be transferred
to the researchers for analysis. Turn management software
in the PM system displays each resident’s repositioning his-
tory and current positional status in an organized and sim-
ple way on strategically placed nursing station and hallway
display screens, making staff aware when resident reposi-
tioning actions are becoming necessary or are overdue. The
percentage of on-time repositioning will be calculated for
the period during which the wireless sensor is worn.
EMR integration of patient monitoring system and CSI
procedures. The EMR will be used to facilitate data col-
lection and export of study-related data, which includes
an interface with wireless sensor data. This approach elim-
inates costly labor-intensive, in-person fidelity checks and
minimizes research burden on staff. Individual wireless
sensors will communicate with wireless antennas placed
throughout the NH, permitting resident monitoring in all
NH areas. The patient monitoring system will allow us to
ascertain repositioning protocol adherence by measuring
consistency between scheduled, performed, and docu-
mented repositioning frequency with random weekly ob-
servational repositioning checks to ensure repositioning
fidelity. With CSI and other resident data, medical severity
components will be assessed by staff based on NH policies
and procedures and monitored in relation to risk level.
Staff-level data. The web-based survey will be adminis-
tered electronically on-site with touch screen tablet, pre/
post the 4-week intervention during the time the em-
ployee is at work. The Nursing Culture Assessment Tool
(NCAT) [46, 47] survey contains 19-items and there are
some demographic items (i.e., length of time employed,
job category, age, gender, education level, shift), and will
be administered pre/post intervention. At the time of
survey data collection, data will be transferred through a
secured server from which it will be downloaded into a
database for statistical analysis. Data will be stored on
the study’s secure encrypted drive (SED).
Measures
The measures and time points at which data will be col-
lected are summarized in Table 2, and Fig. 4 is the study

Severity Index (CSI)
Calculated score on severity resulting from distillation
of physiologic parameters, signs, symptoms,
laboratory results, physical findings, and diagnoses,
using the modified Comprehensive Severity Index

the signs and symptoms, the higher the severity
score: Level 1 is normal to mild, and Level 4 is
catastrophic, life-threatening, or likely to result in
organ failure.
Individual components thought to influence a
resident’s skin tolerance to pressure exposure will be
monitored from assessment to assessment for Leaf,

 Qualitative data collection procedures
Focus groups. In three randomly selected NHs, one
from each hourly repositioning protocol, focus group
sessions (one for staff, one for residents) will be held
to explore the intervention approach and implementa-
tion. There will be one group of NH staff (n = 6) and
one group of NH residents (n = 6) per site. NH staff
focus group discussion will be stimulated using semi-
structured questions to gather participant perspectives on
implementation challenges. Each session will last 30–
45 min. At the start of all focus group sessions partici-
pants will be consented. All focus groups will be recorded
and verbatim transcripts (with no participant identifiers)
will be prepared for subsequent use in data analysis.
Analysis
Quantitative analyses. We hypothesize that there will
be no significant difference in PrU incidence between
the 3 treatment arms in the study using three risk level
groups: high risk (Braden Scale Score, 10–12), moderate
risk (Braden Scale Score, 13–14), and low risk (Braden
Scores > 14). The hypothesis of no group difference will
be tested by examining whether the 95% confidence in-
tervals of the rates of PrU and the 2-h repositioning
overlap. If so, the hypothesis for no group difference will
be confirmed. We will also determine how changes in
medical severity components (as measured by a modified
Comprehensive Severity Index), change in clinically
assessed risk level (low, moderate, high as measured by

 the Braden Scale) and their interactions with reposi-
tioning schedule are associated with PrU development.
Descriptive statistics will be used to examine resident
status, interventions, outcomes, and cost elements. For
categorical variables, we will create contingency tables
and use chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests to determine
the significance of bivariate differences. For continuous
variables, we will use analysis of variance or non-
parametric tests, depending on variable distributions. A
two-sided p-value < 0.05 will be statistically significant.
Intervention cost by NH and study arm and incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated and
compared for cost per percentage reduction in PrUs. Sensi-
tivity analysis will be conducted with the range of observed
repositioning times, nurse salaries, and market prices for
non-labor inputs to assess the robustness of the ICERs and
their sensitivity to labor and non-labor input prices.
Because we will be examining PrU development from
assessment to assessment, the rate of PrU incidence will
be modeled as a binary outcome using repeated mea-
sures logistic regression and a specified working correl-
ation matrix that models the correlation of responses
within subjects. Full likelihood estimation methods are
not appropriate for repeated measures logistic regres-
sion, so generalized estimating equations (GEEs) will be
used instead with model fit assessed using the quasi-
likelihood information criterion (QIC). Robust standard
errors, clustered at the facility level, will be employed to
account for covariance among residents within facilities
over time. To test the robustness of models, we will also
use non-linear mixed models using PROC GLIMMIX as
another option for modeling the data (instead of GEEs
using PROC GENMOD). With PROC GLIMMIX, we
can use random effects to model the covariance rather
than clustered standard errors. As predictors, we will in-
clude time-invariant resident characteristics, e.g., age,
gender, Medicaid payer, and repositioning schedule, as
well as time-varying characteristics, such as resident se-
verity measure, risk level as determined by Braden
Scale© score, staffing characteristics (e.g., number, mix,
and turnover), and suggested MDS resident data ele-
ments as covariates. We may lag some time-varying resi-
dent characteristics by one assessment because we want
to study the associations of repositioning time with PrU
development, controlling for the starting point of the
resident for that assessment interval. Interaction vari-
ables will be included in the predictor data set.
Residents without PrUs who drop out of the study
after at least a three-day stay but before the conclusion
of 4 weeks will be included in the analysis based on in-
tent to treat. Residents who develop a Stage 3 or worse
PrU, or deep purple discoloration, will be removed from
the study per repositioning protocol, but will be consid-
ered a completed case if the ulcer developed on the
coccyx, sacrum, trochanter or heel. Residents who de-
velop ulcers on sites not thought to be influenced by
bed position or limited mobility, or related to sitting, will
continue to be followed for analysis, but will not be in-
cluded in the NH-wide protocol.
Statistical power. According to previous research, the
average PrU incidence rates range from 5.2–15%. At the
time of study design, the nine NHs within the NHS were
identified with the highest PrU incidence rates which av-
eraged 9.2% (SD = 3.3%). In power analyses, we used
3.5% for PrU incidence as the expected rate for interven-
tion since it is the highest rate found in the TURN study
(for moderate-risk patients). The PrU incidence rates
have been translated into an odds ratio of 0.38 (= 3.5%/
9.2%) as the effect size to detect. For Aim 1, odds ratios
from a logistic regression of PrU incidence rates in the
three treatment arms (i.e., at 2-, 3-, and 4-h reposi-
tioning frequencies), controlling for risk level, are pro-
posed to test the difference in PrU incidence rates
between the 4-h arm and the 2-h arm as well as between
the 4-h arm and the 3-h arm at 4 weeks; we are assum-
ing that the distance between the 2-h arm and the
TURN 3-h odds ratio will be larger. A sample size of N
= 951 (n = 317 for each arm) will be required to detect
an odds ratio of .38 with a power of 0.95 at a one-tailed
significance level of α = 0.05, according to G*Power. We
are using a power of 0.95 instead of the conventional
power of 0.80 to ensure that we will have a smaller Type
II error to test the hypothesis of no-group difference that
we expect to fail to reject. We are using a one-tailed test
since we are only interested in determining whether the
PrU rate is higher for assigned repositioning intervals
longer than the current 2-h standard practice.. For Aim
2, GEE is proposed. A sample size of n = 114 for each
group (total N = 342) will be required to detect an effect
size of 5.7% (= 9.2% - 3.5%) with a power of 0.80 at a
one-tailed significance level of α = 0.05, using the algo-
rithms GEESIZE developed by Dahmen, et al., on an
autoregressive structure for residual correlations [48].
Since the nine NHs will be randomly assigned to the
three treatment arms, risk level will be the only potential
covariate to be controlled in the models, and this is
already considered in the power analyses. Therefore, we
will target a sample size of N = 951 (the larger of the two
required sample sizes) for both aims while taking into
account potential losses due to turnover, attrition, and
exclusion criteria. While this proposed study may look
like a non-inferiority or equivalence trial, we will run
regular one-tailed superiority tests, because (as noted
earlier) we are only interested in examining whether or
not the PrU rate is higher for less frequent repositioning
than for the standard 2-h repositioning. (We assume
that 2-h repositioning was followed to produce the 9.2%

 average PrU incidence rate across our 9 study NHs, be-
cause that is the current standard of care). Also, accord-
ing to Snapinn [49], non-inferiority trials have many
controversial assumptions and limitations that need to
be made or addressed, and that is beyond the control of
our study. For incidence, it is difficult to specify a non-
inferiority margin for PrU rates. Instead, we will test the
hypothesis of no group-difference by examining whether
the 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios (for Aim
1) or the PrU rates (for Aim 2) of the two pairs of com-
pared groups (e.g., 4-h arm vs. 2-h arm and 4-h arm vs. 3-
h arm) overlap. If the confidence intervals do overlap, the
hypothesis for no-group difference will be confirmed.
Missing data. When data are missing, we will make ad-
justments depending on the variable and its intended
use in the analyses. Residents with missing data will be
deleted from analyses and continuous variables with
missing data collapsed into categorical data, and cases
with missing information for the continuous variable
placed into a category using corroborating data. For ex-
ample, we may not always have a resident’s body mass
index, but may have other weight- and height-related in-
formation (e.g., resident description as ‘emaciated’) that
allows us to categorize a resident broadly, e.g., as under-
weight. We will use various types of imputation as ap-
propriate and check assumptions about ‘missing at
random’. To exclude unrealistic values and obvious out-
liers from the analysis, we will set ranges for some vari-
ables, and values beyond those ranges will be deemed
improbable and excluded. These values may also be sent
back to the NHs for correction.
Qualitative analysis. NH staff and resident satisfaction
with the intervention approach will be explored using
semi-structured questions to staff and resident focus
groups. A standardized topical guide will be used to
evaluate 1) common perceptions related to satisfaction
with the intervention approach, 2) areas of strength, and
3) areas for improvement. Verbatim transcripts will be
checked against original recordings for accuracy. Data
will be analyzed assisted by NVivo 11 along with field
notes taken during the focus groups. As in the PI’s prior
clinical trial, transcripts will be analyzed using thematic
content analysis; matrices used to organize the data and
category summaries will be compared across NHs and
staff and resident groups. A directed approach will iden-
tify core concepts, and the analytic plan will include use
of satisfaction-based a priori codes and allow for new
themes to emerge post hoc. Analytical rigor will assure
that 1) the study measures what is intended (credibility),
2) results are similar when the work is repeated in the
same way, in the same context with the same partici-
pants and methods (dependability), 3) the findings are
the results of the experiences of the participants (con-
firmability), and 4) the results are applicable to other sit-
uations (transferability).
Discussion
This study will contribute to understanding of an opti-
mal resident repositioning interval using VE surfaces for
NH residents at different risk levels; further, the study
will contribute to a much-needed understanding of the
contribution of medical severity as a precipitating factor
for PrU development. Effective prevention can potentially
reduce PrU incidence and avoid treatment costs while im-
proving overall resident safety and quality of life.
