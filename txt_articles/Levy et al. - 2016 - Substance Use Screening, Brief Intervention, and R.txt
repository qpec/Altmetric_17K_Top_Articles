abstract
The enormous public health impact of adolescent substance use and its 
preventable morbidity and mortality highlight the need for the health 
care sector, including pediatricians and the medical home, to increase its 
capacity regarding adolescent substance use screening, brief intervention, 
and referral to treatment (SBIRT). The American Academy of Pediatrics 
fi
 rst published a policy statement on SBIRT and adolescents in 2011 to 
introduce SBIRT concepts and terminology and to offer clinical guidance 
about available substance use screening tools and intervention procedures. 
This clinical report provides a simplifi
 ed adolescent SBIRT clinical approach 
that, in combination with the accompanying updated policy statement, 
guides pediatricians in implementing substance use prevention, detection, 
assessment, and intervention practices across the varied clinical settings in 
which adolescents receive health care.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
Adolescent substance use is an issue of critical importance to the 
American public. In 2011, a nationally representative household survey 
found that adults rated drug abuse as the number one health concern 
for adolescents.1 These concerns are reflected in the Healthy People 
2020 objectives, which call for reducing teen substance use.2 Alcohol, 
tobacco, and marijuana are the substances most often used by children 
and adolescents in the United States. Twenty-eight percent of students 
have tried alcohol by eighth grade, and 68.2% have tried alcohol by 
12th grade. Twelve percent of eighth-graders and more than half of 
12th-graders have been drunk at least once in their life.3 Rates of 
marijuana use have increased substantially in recent years; in 2012, 
45% of ninth- through 12th-graders reported ever using marijuana, 
and 24% reported marijuana use in the past 30 days.4 Eight percent of 
teenagers reported using marijuana nearly every day, an increase of 
approximately 60% from 2008.4 Decreases in tobacco use by high school 
students have plateaued since 2007; 41% of ninth- through 12th-graders 
reported having tried cigarettes and nearly one-quarter (22.4%)

reported current (past-30-day) use 
of tobacco in any form.5 “Misuse” of 
prescription medication, especially 
stimulants and pain medications, 
continues among a substantial 
minority of adolescents (eg, 15% 
of 12th-graders3). Approximately 
half (50.4%) of 12th-graders have 
used any illicit drug (half of these, or 
24.7%, reported the use of any illicit 
drug other than marijuana).3
Although it is common for 
adolescents and young adults to 
try psychoactive substances, it is 
important that this experimentation 
not be condoned, facilitated, or 
trivialized by adults. Even the first 
use of a psychoactive substance 
may result in tragic consequences, 
such as injury, victimization, or 
even fatality. Adolescence extends 
from approximately 12 years of 
age into the early 20s and is a time 
of intensive neurodevelopmental 
molding and maturation that 
confers greater neurodevelopmental 
vulnerability at a time during which 
risk-taking behaviors are generally 
more prevalent. Adolescents are 
particularly susceptible to risk-
related injuries, including those 
associated with alcohol, tobacco, 
and other drug use.6, 
7 Most alcohol 
and drug use consequences during 
adolescence are attributable not 
to addiction but to the fact that all 
substance use confers some amount 
of risk.8 Substance use correlates 
with sexual risk-taking9 and can 
complicate pregnancy outcomes. 
Other health complexities, such as 
having a chronic disease or disability, 
including intellectual disability, 
may increase an adolescent’s 
vulnerability to both substance 
use and its consequences.10, 
11 
The neurodevelopmental changes 
during adolescence confer particular 
vulnerability to addictions.12 
The age at first substance use is 
inversely correlated with the lifetime 
incidence of developing a substance 
use disorder.7, 
12 Adolescence is 
thus a most critical time period for 
pediatricians, the medical home, and 
any other entity providing health 
advice to deliver clear and consistent 
messaging about abstaining from 
substance use.13
Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health 
Supervision of Infants, Children, and 
Adolescents14 highlights the unique 
role of the pediatrician in addressing 
problem behaviors throughout 
the pediatric age range. Most 
adolescents (83%) have contact with 
a physician annually.15 Adolescents 
consider physicians an authoritative 
source of knowledge about alcohol 
and drugs and are receptive to 
discussing substance use.16 These 
findings underscore the tremendous 
opportunity for addressing substance 
use in primary care settings, the 
medical home, and other settings 
in which children and adolescents 
receive medical care and health 
advice.
The Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) recommends universal 
substance use screening, brief 
intervention, and/or referral to 
treatment (SBIRT) as part of routine 
health care.17 Capitalizing on 
opportunities to screen whenever 
and wherever adolescents receive 
medical care can increase the 
identification of risk behaviors 
and substance use. Because the 
adolescent age group is at the highest 
risk of experiencing substance use–
related health consequences, 
18 it 
is also the most likely to derive the 
most benefit from universal SBIRT. 
This clinical report, together with 
an update of the 2011 American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy 
statement on SBIRT, 
19 presents 
a simplified, practical clinical 
approach to support widespread 
implementation of research-informed 
SBIRT practices. Similar to any 
other patient interactions, SBIRT 
must be conducted with sensitivity 
to various patient population 
abilities, vulnerabilities, and needs, 
such as when adolescents have 
chronic medical conditions or 
intellectual disabilities, 
10, 
11 and with 
considerations to modify SBIRT 
techniques as needed to ensure 
relevance, comprehensibility, and 
reliability.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidentiality practices in the 
medical home are important 
facilitators to SBIRT practices and 
the care of an adolescent disclosing 
substance use. Protection of their 
confidential health care information 
is an essential determinant of 
whether adolescents will access 
care, answer questions honestly, 
and engage in and maintain a 
therapeutic alliance with health care 
professionals.20, 
21 Adolescents may 
disclose substance use or other high-
risk behaviors as a way to reveal 
that they want help or feel unsafe, 
possibly even in their own home, 
so a prime consideration for the 
pediatrician is whether maintaining 
confidentiality or disclosing 
confidential health information is in 
the patient’s best interest.
Health care professional 
organizations guiding best practices 
in adolescent and young adult 
medical care, including the American 
Medical Association, the AAP, the 
American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists, the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, and 
the Society for Adolescent Health and 
Medicine, have established position 
statements and recommendations 
guiding confidentiality and informed 
consent in this age group.22, 
23 
The AAP statement recommends 
that all children and adolescents 
receive comprehensive, confidential 
primary care, including indicated 
screenings, counseling, and physical 
and laboratory evaluations.19 The 
Society for Adolescent Health and 
Medicine’s position paper notes 
that participation of parents in the 
health care of their adolescents 
should usually be encouraged but

not mandated.22 The Center for 
Adolescent Health and the Law 
(CAHL.org) provides detailed 
information about each state’s 
regulations that specify adolescent 
and parent rights, including 
adolescent confidentiality.
Confidentiality practices are best 
introduced to the patient and 
the parent(s) or legal guardian 
simultaneously before the first time 
the teen or “tween” (preadolescent) 
patient is interviewed without 
a parent present or when an 
adolescent is new to a pediatrician’s 
practice. The “limit” to maintaining 
confidentiality relies on the 
pediatrician’s clinical judgment 
of the need to prevent imminent 
harm to the patient or someone 
else and to protect the patient’s 
health and safety. Adolescents often 
express relief that their parents will 
be informed of serious problems, 
although they may have preferences 
about how the information is 
presented. By first informing the 
adolescent that confidentiality 
can no longer be upheld and then 
strategizing about the disclosure, the 
pediatrician, with the adolescent’s 
permission, or the patient, together 
with the pediatrician, can transmit 
the necessary information to parents 
while simultaneously protecting the 
physician-patient bond. Whether 
or not the adolescent’s substance 
use poses an acute safety risk, 
adolescents are likely to benefit from 
the support and involvement of their 
parents in accessing recommended 
services and accepting the care plan. 
Adolescents are unlikely to follow 
through with referrals without 
the support of an adult, and even 
more so if they are being referred 
for the evaluation or treatment of 
something they do not believe they 
have, such as a severe substance use 
disorder (SUD), or addiction. In many 
cases and certainly by the time an 
adolescent has developed an SUD, 
parents are already aware or at least 
highly suspect that their adolescent 
is engaged in substance use, 
although they may underestimate 
the extent of use or the seriousness 
of the situation.24 In addition, 
confidentiality, intervention, and 
treatment are potentially influenced 
by a parent’s substance use or active 
substance use disorder. Advising the 
substance-using parent to speak with 
their own physician or to seek other 
assistance is likely to be helpful as 
the pediatrician begins to work with 
the substance-using adolescent.
Adolescents may be less resistant 
to breaking confidentiality if the 
pediatrician and the adolescent 
first discuss why the disclosure 
is necessary, what details will be 
disclosed, who will disclose the 
details, and how disclosure will help. 
Teenagers may be most concerned 
about protecting tangential details 
(ie, which friends were involved, how 
and where they obtained substances, 
etc), which might be possible to keep 
confidential when disclosure would 
not substantially change the safety 
plan. Adolescents may be willing to 
include their parent(s) in a discussion 
of recommendations, particularly if 
the concerns and recommendations 
can be presented in a way that 
emphasizes positive attributes, 
such as the adolescent’s honesty, 
willingness to change behavior, and/
or acceptance of further evaluation 
or treatment. Adolescents who 
agree to accept a referral without 
notifying their parents may be able 
to access services available in the 
school or the community. Specific 
laws governing the need for parental 
consent for SUD treatment vary 
by state, so legal clarification is 
advised. Physicians should be aware 
that health insurance transactions 
can potentially jeopardize patient 
confidentiality and rapport with 
the patient and parent: for example, 
when a parent’s insurance policy 
sends the policy holder (parent) 
an explanation of benefits with 
explicit diagnostic codes about the 
adolescent’s care.
SCREENING
Screening is a procedure applied to 
populations to identify individuals 
or groups at risk of or with a disease, 
condition, or symptoms. Screening 
is conducted so that the results can 
form the basis for a corresponding 
care plan. The best screening tools 
are those containing the lowest 
number of succinct validated 
questions that can elicit accurate and 
reliable responses. Comprehensive 
biopsychosocial screening, 
including substance use screening, 
is a recommended component of 
routine adolescent health care. The 
HEEADSSS mnemonic, which stands 
for home environment, education 
and employment, eating, peer-related 
activities, drugs, sexuality, suicide/
depression, and safety from injury 
and violence, 
25, 
26 is a frequently 
used framework to conduct a 
complete psychosocial interview 
with adolescents, as is the SSHADESS 
mnemonic, a strength- and resiliency-
based tool. Whether the patient 
responds to a written or electronic 
survey or provider or medical 
assistant questioning, the “D” in these 
tools triggers screening about the 
patient’s substance use but possibly 
also about use by their friends or 
household members.
The SBIRT screening goal is to 
define experience with substance 
use along a spectrum ranging from 
abstinence to addiction so that this 
information can be used to guide 
the next steps of the related clinical 
approach, or intervention (see Table 
1). Screening results broadly inform 
clinical care: for example, alcohol 
and drug use may be the source of a 
presenting symptom or may interfere 
with prescribed medications and 
test results. The management of 
inattentiveness would be different if 
the physician learned that the patient 
used marijuana (a possible cause) 
or a stimulant drug (a prescribing 
risk). Awareness about the range 
of possible screening results allows 
the pediatrician to be prepared to

address the range of potential patient 
responses.
Pediatricians’ self-reported rates 
of routine substance use screening 
vary from less than 50%27, 
28 to 
86%, 
29 although few physicians 
reported using a validated screening 
tool, 
30 and most relied on clinical 
impressions. The most frequently 
cited barriers to screening were lack 
of time, 
31 insufficient training, 
32 and 
lack of familiarity with standardized 
tools.33 Experienced pediatricians 
have failed to detect mild, moderate, 
and sometimes even severe SUDs 
when relying on clinical impressions 
alone.34 A recent study found that 
when a screening tool was not used, 
only one-third of youth who were 
engaged in “excessive alcohol use” 
were identified.35
An array of validated tools is 
available to conduct alcohol and 
other substance use screening and 
to guide assessment for use-related 
problems (Table 2). The effective 
incorporation of screening into 
the pediatric practice depends on 
pediatricians being knowledgeable 
about screening options and selecting 
and implementing the tools most 
suitable for routine use in their 
particular care settings and patient 
population(s), including vulnerable 
patients in their care. Alcohol-only 
screening may be most useful with 
younger children, when time is 
very limited or when alcohol use 
is a particular concern. The AAP-
endorsed National Institute on 
Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse’s 
“Youth Guide”36 provides clinicians 
with an age-based schema to ask 
patients about the frequency of 
their drinking and their friends’ 
drinking in the past year and to 
correlate the respective responses 
with the current and future risk of 
having an alcohol use disorder. The 
BSTAD (Brief Screener for Tobacco, 
Alcohol and other Drugs)37 uses 
highly sensitive and specific cutoffs 
to identify various SUDs among 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age: ≥6 
days of past-year use for tobacco and 
>1 day of past-year use for alcohol 
or marijuana.37 The Screening to 
Brief Intervention (S2BI) tool38 
uses a stem question and forced-
response options (none, once or 
twice, monthly, and weekly or more) 
in a sequence to reveal the frequency 
of past-year use of tobacco, alcohol, 
marijuana, and 5 other classes of 
substances most commonly used 
by adolescents (Table 3). The S2BI 
tool is highly sensitive and specific 
in discriminating among clinically 
relevant use-risk categories and 
therefore is remarkably efficient in its 
ability to detect severe SUDs aligned 
with criteria from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition39 (Table 4). Although 
the S2BI is not a formal diagnostic 
instrument, the patient’s response 
to the question about the frequency 
of use in the past year correlates 
closely with the present likelihood 
of having an SUD, as follows: used 
“once or twice” correlates with no 
SUD, uses “monthly” correlates with 
mild or moderate SUD, and uses 
“weekly or more” correlates with 
a severe SUD (Fig 1). The CRAFFT 
(Car, Relax, Alone, Friends/Family, 
Forget, Trouble)40 tool originally was 
validated to screen for substance use 
risk by scoring each patient’s “yes” 
or “no” responses to 6 questions, but 
using the tool as an assessment to 
explore “yes” responses and to reveal 
the extent of the patient’s substance 
use–related problems may be more 
effective for gathering details for use 
in SBIRT intervention.
Incorporating screening into 
the patient care visit logically 
assumes that the spectrum of 
possible screening outcomes will 
be addressed by using effective 
approaches and available resources 
most suitable for the particular 
patient population and locale. 
Options for pediatricians to respond 
to adolescent substance use 
screening results and to facilitate 
care are described by a range of 
“brief intervention and referral to 
treatment” practices.
BRIEF INTERVENTION
Brief intervention (BI) is a 
conversation that focuses on

TABLE 1  
Substance Use Spectrum and Goals for BI
Stage
Description
BI Goals
Abstinence
The time before an individual has 
ever used drugs or alcohol more 
than a few sips.
Prevent or delay initiation of substance 
use through positive reinforcement 
and patient/parent education.
Substance use without 
a disorder
Limited use, generally in social 
situations, without related 
problems. Typically, use occurs 
at predictable times, such as on 
weekends.
Advise to stop. Provide counseling 
regarding the medical harms of 
substance use. Promote patient 
strengths.
Mild–moderate SUD
Use in high-risk situations, such as 
when driving or with strangers. 
Use associated with a problem, 
such as a fi
 ght, arrest, or school 
suspension. Use for emotional 
regulation, such as to relieve 
stress or depression. Defi
 ned as 
meeting 2 to 5 of the 11 criteria 
for an SUD in the DSM-5.
Brief assessment to explore patient-
perceived problems associated with 
use. Give clear, brief advice to quit. 
Provide counseling regarding the 
medical harms of substance use. 
Negotiate a behavior change to quit 
or cut down. Close patient follow-up. 
Consider referral to SUD treatment. 
Consider breaking confi
 dentiality.
Severe SUD
Loss of control or compulsive drug 
use associated with neurologic 
changes in the reward system of 
the brain. Defi
 ned as meeting ≥6 
of the 11 criteria for an SUD in 
the DSM-5.
As above. Involve parents in treatment 
planning whenever possible. Refer 
to the appropriate level of care. 
Follow up to ensure compliance with 
treatment and to offer continued 
support.

encouraging healthy choices so that 
the risk behaviors are prevented, 
reduced, or stopped. In the context 
of SBIRT, regardless of which 
substance use screening tools are 
used, the BI strategy is identical, 
because it is a direct response to 
the reported substance use severity. 
BI encompasses a spectrum of 
potential pediatrician responses, 
including positive reinforcement for 
adolescents reporting no substance 
use; brief, medically based advice 
for those reporting use but showing 
no evidence of an SUD; brief 
motivational interventions when a 
mild or moderate SUD is revealed; 
and referral to treatment of those 
with a severe SUD. Using motivation-
enhancing principles is compatible 
with all BI dialogue regarding any 
level of substance use and risk.
Among adolescents presenting to 
an ED for a substance use–related 
problem, BI has been shown to 
reduce subsequent alcohol use, 
43 
marijuana use, 
44 and associated 
problems45 and to be cost-effective 
compared with brief education.46 
Several BI models have been 
evaluated in primary care: structured 
intervention “5A’s, 
”47 “CHAT, 
”48 
intervention with follow-up “Healthy 
Choices, 
”49 “MOMENT, 
”50 and 
therapist-delivered versus computer-
delivered BI.51 All of these models 
have been modestly successful in 
showing reductions in substance 
use and related consequences and/
or risky behaviors, although 1 
trial found similar substance use 
reductions in both experimental 
and control groups.50 Physician-
implemented BI is acceptable to both 
teenagers16 and clinicians.52 Although 
a recent US Preventive Services Task 
Force53 review found insufficient 
scientific basis to recommend 
any particular BI for addressing 
adolescent substance use, this clinical 
report reviews the current literature 
base to summarize expert opinion 
about practical BI strategies.
No Substance Use: Positive 
Reinforcement
It has been recommended that 
adolescents reporting no substance 
use (whether tobacco, alcohol, 
or other drugs) receive positive 
reinforcement for making this 
smart decision and related healthy 
choices.54 Even a few positive 
words from a physician may delay 
the initiation of alcohol use by 
adolescents.55 Any delay in substance 
use onset coincides with additional 
brain maturation, so abstaining may 
be protective against the known 
acute and long-term consequences of 
early-onset substance use. Choosing 
to abstain from substance use can be 
framed as an active decision, and the 
adolescent is given credit for making 
a healthful decision and acting on 
it. Although screening has never 
been shown to increase rates of 
substance use, the National Institute 
on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse 
recommends including a “normative 
correction” statement whenever 
screening children or younger 
adolescents, such as, “I am glad to 
hear that you, just like most others 
your age, have never tried alcohol.” 
Normative correction statements 
may help avoid the potential for 
patient misinterpretation that being 
screened in this case for alcohol 
use implies that alcohol use by 
the patient and at his or her age is 
expected and the age norm.
Substance Use Without an SUD: BI
When substance use is infrequent 
with a low likelihood of having an 
SUD, such as an S2BI screening 
response of using “once or twice” 
in the past year, the appropriate BI 
is to advise the patient to abstain 
in support of health and safety. 
A BI comprising clear, pointed 
advice to stop substance use 
combined with succinct mention 
of the negative health effects of 
use can lead to decreased use or

abstinence in adolescent patients 
who use substances infrequently.56 
Brief medical advice could include 
statements such as, “For the sake 
of your health, I advise you to quit 
smoking marijuana. Marijuana use 
interferes with concentration and 
memory and is linked to getting 
lower grades at school.” This BI could 
also recognize and leverage personal 
strengths and positive attributes, 
such as, “You are doing so well in 
school. I hope you will consider how 
your marijuana use could change all 
that, and whether or not that is what 
you really want.”
Mild to Moderate SUD: Brief 
Motivational Intervention
Brief intervention for adolescents 
with mild to moderate SUD is a likely 
short structured conversation based 
on the principles of motivational 
interviewing, 
57 through which 
the pediatrician respects patient 
autonomy while enhancing the 
patient’s self-efficacy to institute 
behavior change, rather than 
persuading, coercing, or demanding 
the behavior change.58 The core 
activity of BMI is to help the patient 
compare the benefits of continued 
substance use with the potential 
benefits of behavior change (ie, 
decreasing or stopping use) and 
ultimately take action that supports 
personal health and safety. The 
intervention is based on the premise 
that although adolescents who have 
experienced substance use–related 
problems can identify the potential 
benefits of reducing or stopping use, 
behavior change will not occur until 
the perceived benefits of giving up 
use outweigh the perceived “cost” 
and harms from continued use. 
For example, an adolescent may 
realize that marijuana use is causing 
tension in the relationship with his 
or her parents but continue to use 
marijuana because of perceived 
greater benefit from marijuana use 
to relieve stress or as a pleasurable 
activity shared with friends.
Starting an intervention with 
assessment questions to identify 
substance use frequency and 
associated problem severity can 
guide the pediatrician in deciding the 
next steps for patient care, namely 
continued conversation around 
behavior change managed in the 
medical home or referring to more 
specialized substance use evaluation, 
intervention, and/or treatment. This 
model optimizes the CRAFFT40 tool 
as an assessment guide. For example, 
an adolescent patient responding 
“yes” to the CRAFFT question, 
"Have you gotten into trouble while 
you were using alcohol or drugs?" 
The pediatrician can distill these 
details into a fulcrum to pivot the 
conversation into discussing the 
adolescent’s plans for avoiding 
such problems in the future. The 
pediatrician can assist the patient in 
making a specific intervention plan 
to record in the medical record and 
facilitate follow-up (Box 1).

attempted behavior change to 
assess whether risk behaviors have 
diminished, remained the same, or 
escalated. Adolescents who are found 
to have met the agreed-on substance 
use behavior change goals can benefit 
from discussing the pros and cons of 
their decreased use and identifying 
any motivating factors that can be 
reinforced to sustain the behavior

Adolescents who are unable to

parties. He admits preferring 
not to think about it because it 
frightens him. The pediatrician 
correlates the report of ‘monthly’ 
use to a likelihood that the 
patient has a mild or moderate 
SUD, indicating the next step is 
intervention to reduce use. The 
patient is given brief advice and 
challenged to make a behavior 
change: “As your doctor, I 
recommend that you stop drinking 
alcohol. You described having 
‘blackouts’ from your drinking. 
This means that you drank enough 
to poison your brain cells at least 
temporarily, which is why at times 
you can’t remember how you have 
gotten home from parties. As you 
pointed out, a teenager can get 
into trouble with ‘blackouts,’ and 
it sounds like you have had some 
frightening experiences. How do 
you think you can protect yourself 
better in the future?” The patient 
says that he is not going to quit 
drinking, but can agree to limiting 
himself to 2 drinks per occasion, a 
sharp decrease from his usual 6 to 
8 drinks, because he does not want 
to black out again. The pediatrician 
gives advice about alcohol and 
motor vehicle-associated risks 
and suggests developing a 
safety plan. Planning is 
documented in the medical record 
and a follow-up appointment is 
scheduled in 3 months.

as a social worker or psychologist. 
Referral for specific substance use 
evaluation and/or to psychiatric 
services or other available treatment 
options is a next step when patients 
have psychiatric symptomatology 
or cannot decrease use. When 
available, referral to mental health 
professionals within the same 
medical home practice setting may 
optimize patient compliance.
Severe SUD: Brief Intervention 
Focused on Referral to Treatment
Severe SUD, or addiction, is a 
neurologically based disorder 
resulting from the disruption of 
neurons in the reward center of 
the brain as the result of repeated 
exposure to a psychoactive 
substance.59–61 The earlier an 
individual initiates psychoactive 
substance use, the more likely that 
individual is to develop addiction, a 
nearly linear and highly significant 
relationship.62–64 The S2BI tool 
delineates use-risk categories so 
that a patient reporting weekly or 
more frequent substance use has 
a high probability of a severe SUD. 
When addiction is likely, the next 
SBIRT steps are to engage the patient 
in a comprehensive evaluation by 
a substance use specialist, ensure 
assessment for co-occurring mental 
health disorders, and engage in 
available treatment options as soon 
as possible to initiate the significant 
behavior change that is necessary for 
the patient’s future health and safety.
Because resistance and denial (ie, 
lack of insight)65 are intrinsic SUD 
symptoms, the patient and/or 
family may be unwilling to pursue 
an evaluation or therapy when 
it is recommended. Despite this 
challenge, it is important for the 
pediatrician to remain engaged with 
the patient and family and supportive 
during discussions and decision-
making about the care options as 
well as throughout the entire course 
of care and aftercare. Motivational 
interviewing strategies can be helpful 
for encouraging an adolescent 
and/or the family to accept a referral 
(Box 2).

Acute Risk of Harm
Substance use screening may reveal 
that an adolescent patient is at risk 
of imminent harm and immediate 
attention is warranted, including 
screening for suicidal or homicidal 
ideation. Certain substance use patterns 
indicate acute risk, such as injection 
drug use, drug withdrawal symptoms, 
and active substance use with a past 
history of a drug-related emergency 
department visit or medically 
supervised withdrawal. Very high-
risk behaviors include using different 
sedatives together, such as mixing 
alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, 
and/or opioids; frequent or excessive 
binge drinking, which is especially 
concerning for alcohol poisoning; and 
operating a motor vehicle coincident 
with alcohol or other drug use. The 
more recent the activity, the more 
immediate is the need to address the 
risk through mental health and/or 
medical intervention and to detect or 
confirm an SUD and other underlying 
or co-occurring health issues.
When an acute risk of harm is 
revealed, the next steps for the 
pediatrician are to use brief 
intervention techniques to facilitate a 
commitment from the adolescent to 
curtail or avoid further substance use 
and high-risk behaviors. Imminent 
risk of harm calls for the patient and 
pediatrician to discuss confidentiality 
and disclosure, because the parent(s) 
nearly always should be involved 
in the safety plan and next steps 
of medical care, including how the 
parent(s) can support and monitor 
the adolescent and respond to acute 
concerns about safety as specialty 
evaluation and care services are 
engaged (Table 5, Box 3).

when she is stressed and that 
she does not see the harm in it. 
She also states that her mother 
knows about her use and thinks 
marijuana use is bad for her, so 
their relationship has gotten tense 
over this disagreement. She was 
recently suspended from school 
when caught with marijuana. 
The pediatrician summarizes 
the situation and provides brief 
advice: “It seems that you depend 
on marijuana to help you manage 
stress, and at the same time you 
realize marijuana use is causing 
tension at home and has gotten 
you into trouble at school. It is 
clear to me that you are thinking 
about this, and I am glad you are 
willing to speak with me about it. 
As your physician and for the sake 
of your health, your school work, 
and your relationship with your 
mom, I recommend that you quit 
your marijuana use. I would like you 
to speak with a colleague of mine 
who can help you continue thinking 
through the “good things” and “not 
so good things” about marijuana 
use and help you figure out what 
you want to do. What do you think?” 
The patient agrees tentatively. 
The pediatrician gives her positive 
feedback about her willingness 
to discuss her marijuana use now 
and meet with the recommended 
colleague soon. The pediatrician 
asks the patient’s permission to 
invite her mother into the room 
to discuss the plan together and 
mentions this would also show 
her that the patient is taking the 
concerns about her marijuana 
use seriously. She agrees and the 
patient’s mother joins them for 
a summary of the conversation. 
The counseling appointment is 
scheduled, and the plan is detailed 
in the medical record. The patient 
and mother are scheduled for 
follow-up in 1 month.
A 17-year-old boy reports weekly 
use of alcohol and marijuana 
and monthly use of prescription 
medications and cocaine. The 
pediatrician asks follow-up 
questions to gauge the patient’s 
level of acute health and safety 
risk. He uses marijuana to relax. He 
often smokes alone and sometimes 
drinks alone. He has frequent 
blackouts and explains “that’s the 
point.” He likes mixing pills with 
alcohol because he blacks out 
faster. He has thought that he may 
have an alcohol problem, but he 
does not plan to stop. He denies 
thoughts of hurting himself or 
others. The pediatrician responds: 
“I am glad you spoke honestly with 
me today. From what you told me, 
I am worried about your drug use. 
Mixing drugs can really get you 
into trouble, even if you only take 
a couple of pills. Because I am so 
concerned, I want you to know that 
some of this information must be 
shared with your parents and an 
appointment will be made for you 
to speak more about your drug use 
with one of my colleagues. In the 
meantime, can you promise me that 
you will not use any pills or drugs at 
all before your next appointment? 
What do you think would be the best 
way to share the information with 
your parents?”

extensive evaluation and treatment are 
able to access the appropriate services. 
Historically, medical encounters 
have been notably poor in identifying 
adolescents who have severe SUDs 
and connecting them with treatment. 
SAMHSA has estimated that fewer 
than 10% of adolescents in need of 
specialty substance use treatment 
receive it, and the majority of referrals 
are from the justice system.66, 
67 The 
referral to treatment, or “RT, 
” of SBIRT 
is composed of 2 distinct yet connected 
clinical activities: working with the 
adolescent and family so they accept 
that timely referral and treatment 
are necessary for the patient’s health 
and facilitating the referral process 
to engage the patient and family with 
the appropriate professional(s) or 
program(s).
Deciding where to refer an adolescent 
in need of treatment is often 
complicated by limited treatment 
availability, insurance coverage 
complexities, and preferences of the 
adolescent and family. In most cases, 
pediatricians will refer adolescents 
with SUDs to a mental health or 
addiction specialist to conduct a 
comprehensive biopsychosocial 
assessment and to determine the 
appropriate level of care from the 
treatment spectrum, ranging from 
outpatient substance use counseling 
to long-term residential treatment 
e10
TABLE 6  
ASAM Levels of Care for Treatment of SUDs
Description
OUTPATIENT
 Individual counseling
Adolescents with SUDs should receive specifi
 c treatment of their substance use; general supportive counseling may be a useful 
adjuvant but should not be a substitute.69 Several therapeutic modalities (motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, contingency management, etc) have all shown promise in treating adolescents with SUDs.70
 Group therapy
Group therapy is a mainstay of SUD treatment of adolescents with SUDs. It is a particularly attractive option because it is 
cost-effective and takes advantage of the developmental preference for congregating with peers. However, group therapy 
has not been extensively evaluated as a therapeutic modality for this age group, and existing research has produced mixed 
results.69–71
 Family therapy
Family-directed therapies are the best-validated approach for treating adolescent SUDs. A number of modalities have all 
been shown to be effective. Family counseling typically targets domains that fi
 gure prominently in the etiology of SUDs in 
adolescents: family confl
 ict, communication, parental monitoring, discipline, child abuse/neglect, and parental SUDs.69
 Intensive outpatient program 
(IOP)
IOPs serve as an intermediate level of care for patients who have needs that are too complex for outpatient treatment but do 
not require inpatient services. These programs allow individuals to continue with their daily routine and practice newly 
acquired recovery skills both at home and at work.
IOPs generally comprise a combination of supportive group therapy, educational groups, family therapy, individual therapy, 
relapse prevention and life skills, 12-step recovery, case management, and after-care planning. The programs range from 
2 to 9 hours per day, 2 to 5 times per week, and last 1 to 3 months. These programs are appealing because they provide a 
plethora of services in a relatively short period of time.72
 Partial hospital program
Partial hospitalization is a short-term, comprehensive outpatient program in affi
 liation with a hospital that is designed to 
provide support and treatment of patients with SUDs. The services offered at these programs are more concentrated 
and intensive than regular outpatient treatment because they are structured throughout the entire day and offer medical 
monitoring in addition to individual and group therapy. Participants typically attend sessions for 7 or 8 hours per day, at 
least 5 days per week, for 1–3 weeks. As with IOPs, patients return home in the evenings and have a chance to practice newly 
acquired recovery skills.73
OUTPATIENT
 Detoxifi
 cation
Detoxifi
 cation refers to the medical management of symptoms of withdrawal. Medically supervised detoxifi
 cation is indicated 
for any adolescent who is at risk for withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines and may also be helpful for adolescents 
withdrawing from opioids, cocaine, or other substances. Detoxifi
 cation may be an important fi
 rst step but is not considered 
defi
 nitive treatment. Patients who are discharged from a detoxifi
 cation program should then begin either an outpatient or 
residential SUD treatment program.70, 
71
 Acute residential treatment 
(ART)
ART is a short-term (days–weeks) residential placement designed to stabilize patients in crisis, often before entering a longer-
term residential treatment program.70 ART programs typically target adolescents with co-occurring mental health disorders.
 Residential treatment
Residential treatment programs are highly structured live-in environments that provide therapy for those with severe SUD, 
mental illness, or behavioral problems that require 24-hour care. The goal of residential treatment is to promote the 
achievement and subsequent maintenance of long-term abstinence as well as equip each patient with both the social and 
coping skills necessary for a successful transition back into society. Residential treatment programs are classifi
 ed by the 
length of the program; short-term refers to programs of ≤30 days’ duration, long-term refers to programs of >30 days’ 
duration.
Residential treatment programs generally comprise individual and group therapy sessions plus medical, psychological, clinical, 
nutritional, and educational components. Residential facilities aim to simulate real living environments with added structure 
and routine to prepare individuals with the framework necessary for their lives to continue drug and alcohol free on 
completion of the program.74
 Therapeutic boarding school
Therapeutic boarding schools are educational institutions that provide constant supervision for their students by professional 
staff. These schools offer a highly structured environment with set times for all activities, smaller, more specialized classes, 
and social and emotional support. In addition to the regular services offered at traditional boarding schools, therapeutic 
schools also provide individual and group therapy for adolescents with mental health or SUDs.75

programs. In 2001, the American 
Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) 
revised its comprehensive national 
guidelines for placement, continued 
stay, and discharge of patients with 
alcohol and other drug problems. 
The separate guidelines devised for 
adults and adolescents detail 5 broad 
levels of care that range from early 
intervention to medically managed 
intensive inpatient treatment and 
correspond to addiction severity, 
related problems, and potential for 
behavior change and recovery68 
(Table 6). Adolescents should be 
treated in the least-restrictive 
environment (ie, level of care) 
that supports their clinical needs. 
Adolescents who voluntarily accept 
therapeutic placement will usually 
engage more readily in their care, 
which is a key factor influencing SUD 
treatment success.
The Center for Substance Abuse 
Treatment has published evidence-
based treatment and assessment 
protocols and manuals (available 
at: www. 
ncbi. 
nlm. 
nih. 
gov/ 
books/ 
NBK82999). To help identify 
treatment options throughout 
the country, SAMHSA maintains 
a comprehensive and easy-to-use 
Substance Abuse Treatment Facility 
Locator on its Web site (www. 
samhsa. 
gov/ 
treatment/ 
index. 
aspx), 
which also lists both a Buprenorphine 
Physician & Treatment Program 
Locator and an Opioid Treatment 
Program Directory. Opioid and 
alcohol use disorders are the primary 
indications for medication-assisted 
treatment in adult populations; 
medication-assisted treatment with 
buprenorphine or naltrexone also 
is an option for opioid-dependent 
adolescents.76, 
77
Successful addiction treatment 
usually involves a long recovery 
process during which the patient 
experiences more than 1 level of 
care. In 2013, the ASAM reconceived 
the notion of “patient placement” by 
incorporating the entire admission, 
treatment, and continuing care 
into a single longitudinal process 
and encouraging the integration 
of addiction services with general 
health care, mental health, and 
a variety of other subjects and 
settings. Because clinicians and 
payers need to exchange information 
frequently and repeatedly during 
the treatment payment approval 
process, the current edition of 
the ASAM National Treatment 
Guidelines68 includes a section about 
working effectively with managed 
care, particularly in the context of 
health care reform.
Most patients in addiction treatment 
consider themselves “recovering” 
rather than “recovered” to recognize 
their lifelong potential for relapse. 
Whether treatment begins in 
outpatient or inpatient care, it should 
continue at the level appropriate 
to support the patient’s recovery 
process, which often is achieved 
through sequential or overlapping 
therapeutic levels and usually 
includes participation in a formal 
structured program, self-help groups 
(eg, Alcoholics Anonymous, Alateen, 
Narcotics Anonymous), ongoing 
after-care programs, and self-help 
recovery work.
The medical home plays a key role 
for all patients in recovery through 
many roles that include providing 
continuity of general medical care 
and rapport with the patient and 
family, coordinating the patient’s 
various care specialties and 
services involved, and providing 
SUD follow-up care to detect 
relapse and providing support 
through referral and collaborative 
care. Relapse is not uncommon 
in SUDs, but anticipating it and 
viewing it as a learning opportunity 
can motivate the patient and 
family to re-engage in care. By 
collaborating with addiction 
medicine specialists and other 
mental health professionals as 
well as working with the family, 
third-party payers, and schools, 
among others, the pediatrician 
plays an essential role in the 
ongoing care of children and 
adolescents with SUDs.
OPTIMAL STANDARDS FOR AN SUD 
TREATMENT PROGRAM
The following were adapted from 
SAMHSA and Center for Substance 
Abuse Treatment standards into 
optimal goals for inpatient or 
outpatient SUD treatment programs 
serving the pediatric population.78 
The program will:
1. View drug and alcohol use 
disorders as a primary disease 
rather than a symptom.
2. Include a comprehensive 
patient evaluation and a 
developmentally appropriate 
management and treatment 
referral plan for associated 
medical, emotional, and 
behavioral problems 
identified.
3. Maintain rapport with the 
patient’s pediatrician to facilitate 
seamless after-care and primary 
care follow-up.
4. Adhere to an abstinence 
philosophy and consider the 
patient’s continued use of 
tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs 
as indicating more treatment is 
needed rather than the program 
should discharge or refuse to 
treat.
5. Maintain a low patient-to-staff 
ratio.
6. Use treatment professionals 
who are knowledgeable in both 
addiction treatment and child 
and adolescent behavior and 
development.
7. Maintain separate treatment 
groups for individuals at 
varying developmental levels 
(adolescents, young adults, and 
older adults).
8. Involve the entire family in 
the treatment and relate to 
e11

the patients and their families 
with compassion and concern. 
Programs located as close to 
home as possible are preferable 
to facilitate family involvement, 
even though separation of the 
adolescent from the family may 
be indicated initially.
9. Offer patients an opportunity 
to continue academic and 
vocational education and 
assistance with restructuring 
family, school, and social life. 
Consider formal academic and 
cognitive skills assessment, 
because unidentified weaknesses 
may contribute to emotional 
factors contributing to the 
substance use.
10. Keep the family apprised of costs 
and financial arrangements for 
inpatient and outpatient care and 
facilitate communication with 
managed-care organizations.
11. Ensure that follow-up and 
continuing care are integral 
parts of the program.
Billing and payment for screening 
and office-based BI varies by 
payer. A fact sheet about coding 
for behavior change intervention 
for substance use is available on

SUMMARY
Pediatricians play a key role in 
preventing and curtailing adolescent 
substance use and associated harm, 
whether through direct patient 
care practices, multidisciplinary 
collaboration, or support of parenting 
and community efforts. Research-
informed SBIRT practices can be 
applied across the variety of practice 
settings and clinicians providing 
health care to adolescents. SBIRT 
is recognized to include the use of 
validated screening tools, assessing 
for substance use risk and problems, 
sharing expert health promotion 
and disease prevention advice, 
and conducting interventions that 
encourage substance use reduction 
and/or referral to treatment.
