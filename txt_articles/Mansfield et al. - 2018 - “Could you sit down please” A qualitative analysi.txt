Abstract
Office workers spend most of their working day sitting, and prolonged sitting has been asso-
ciated with increased risk of poor health. Standing in meetings has been proposed as a strat-
egy by which to reduce workplace sitting but little is known about the standing experience.
This study documented workers’ experiences of standing in normally seated meetings.
Twenty-five participants (18+ years), recruited from three UK universities, volunteered to
stand in 3 separate, seated meetings that they were already scheduled to attend. They
were instructed to stand when and for however long they deemed appropriate, and gave
semi-structured interviews after each meeting. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using
Framework Analysis. Four themes, central to the experience of standing in meetings, were
extracted: physical challenges to standing; implications of standing for meeting engage-
ment; standing as norm violation; and standing as appropriation of power. Participants typi-
cally experienced some physical discomfort from prolonged standing, apparently due to
choosing to stand for as long as possible, and noted practical difficulties of fully engaging in
meetings while standing. Many participants experienced marked psychological discomfort
due to concern at being seen to be violating a strong perceived sitting norm. While standing
when leading the meeting was felt to confer a sense of power and control, when not leading
the meeting participants felt uncomfortable at being misperceived to be challenging the
authority of other attendees. These findings reveal important barriers to standing in nor-
mally-seated meetings, and suggest strategies for acclimatising to standing during meet-
ings. Physical discomfort might be offset by building standing time slowly and incorporating
more sit-stand transitions. Psychological discomfort may be lessened by notifying other
attendees about intentions to stand. Organisational buy-in to promotional strategies for
standing may be required to dispel perceptions of sitting norms, and to progress a wider
workplace health and wellbeing agenda.

 Introduction
Half of UK workers are office based [1]. Office workers spend approximately two-thirds of the
working day in seated tasks [2] and are estimated to accumulate around 10.5h of sitting per
waking day [3]. Growing evidence has associated prolonged sitting, characterised by very low
energy expenditure (1.5 metabolic equivalents or less) [4], with increased disease and prema-
ture mortality risk [5–8]. Sedentary office work is an urgent public health issue. There is some
evidence to suggest that some of the deleterious health effects of sitting time can be offset by
engaging in moderate physical activity for at least one hour daily [9]. However, based on self-
report data–which typically overestimate true activity levels [10]–a third of the UK population
fails to meet the more modest target of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week [11]. It may
be unrealistic to expect office workers who are highly physically inactive and highly sedentary
to adopt daily bouts of activity lasting an hour or more [12]. Displacing sitting with standing
may offer a more feasible sitting-reduction strategy.
Standing at work is often proposed as a way of reducing sitting [13–16]. Standing has been
linked to lowered mortality rates [17], likely due at least in part to greater energy expenditure,
reduced glucose variability and oxidative stress [11, 18, 19]. While there are no government
guidelines offering targets for standing and sitting time in the UK, a recent expert-consensus
document recommended that office workers accumulate 2-4h of standing and light activity
daily, and take regular breaks from prolonged sitting [16]. Achieving this target will require
developing strategies to displace sitting with standing. While the most commonly-evaluated
strategy has been to restructure the environment to facilitate desk work while standing or mov-
ing [20–24], another commonly-proposed strategy is to promote standing in normally-seated
meetings [25–26].
There are multiple routes through which standing in meetings might be widely adopted
within the workplace. At the organisational and environmental levels, managers could imple-
ment initiatives that explicitly support standing meetings among employees, such as introduc-
ing standing-permissive meeting room furniture, or enshrining standing meetings into
workplace practices and procedures [27]. Indeed, standing meetings are commonplace in the
software development sector, where they are used for short daily team briefings [28]. At the
individual level, employees might drive organisational change by voluntarily choosing to stand
in meetings, with the aim of normalising standing in typically-seated contexts. Such a strategy,
however, depends on the acceptability of standing in meetings to those who attempt it.
Interview studies suggest that office workers believe standing in meetings to be an accept-
able sitting-reduction strategy in principle [29,30], but few studies have documented lived expe-
riences of attempting to stand in normally-seated meetings. The scant available research into
standing meetings to date has focused on responses to the topic matter and meeting frequency
[28], not the standing experience itself. Initial experiences of novel behaviours are important
determinants of maintenance [31, 32]; the sustainability of standing in meetings where all oth-
ers are seated will depend not only on prior expectations, but also whether experiences match
expectations [32, 33]. Employees are unlikely to continue to stand in seated meetings where
they find the experience intolerable or unsuitable [33].
This paper reports the first study to our knowledge to examine employees’ experiences of
standing in seated meetings using qualitative data. Understanding how employees experi-
ence standing in meetings, and the organisational, social and psychological structures that
surround such experiences, will help to inform development and implementation of worksite
standing interventions that go beyond the provision of sit-stand workstations. Our study
focused on university workers. Universities are complex organisational structures offering
diverse office environments, with workers from across the socioeconomic spectrum, so

 university workers’ experiences may potentially be relevant to many other office workers
and settings. Our research question was: “how do office workers experience standing in nor-
mally-seated meetings?”
Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from three UK-based universities, between January-April 2016,
using convenience sampling methods. Recruitment was conducted using print and online
advertisements through university communication channels (internal email, poster, staff
newsletter, Twitter). Participants were offered a £50 (~US$65) voucher for taking part. Poten-
tial participants returned by email an expression of interest form, and self-reported their
demographics (work/job role, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, income; Table 1) and eligibility,
via items assessing the following criteria. Eligible participants were: desk-based employees;
aged 18+ years with no intention to leave the organisation before July 2016; able to identify
three meetings, differing in size, with potential for standing; and willing to be observed at
meetings and interviewed. Those who had engaged in standing up in meetings in the past 3
months, used a sit-stand desk in the past 3 months, were full time students, or were unable to
stand, were excluded. Those meeting eligibility criteria took part in a face-to-face, telephone or
email inception meeting to clarify study requirements and agree meeting dates.
Due to deadlines imposed by the broader project within which this study was located, a six-
month window was set for study planning, data collection and analysis, which included three
months for recruitment. Twenty-seven participants were recruited during this time, of whom
two (from Workplace A) dropped out, citing insufficient time for participation, after the first
meeting. The final sample thus comprised 25 participants (7 from Workplace A, 10 from
Workplace B, 8 from Workplace C). Of these, six (24%) were male, 18 (72%) female, and one
(4%) self-declared as ‘other’. The modal age category was 25-29y. Twenty-three (92%) partici-
pants had degree level or higher qualifications, and two (8%) had technical or professional
qualifications.
Procedure and interview schedule
As part of the pre-study information sheet, participants were given minimal information on
the potential health benefits of standing (“public health researchers have suggested that office-
based workers should stand up in meetings, to promote health”), and were told that “the study
aims to explore what it is like for office-based employees to stand in meetings”. Participants
were asked to select three group workplace meetings that they had been due to attend irrespec-
tive of study participation, and which differed in size (small: 3–10 attendees; medium: 11–19;
large: 20+), such that each participant attended one meeting of each size (i.e., three meetings in
total). We determined three meetings to be sufficiently conducive to variation in experiences
for each participant, and feasible within the study period.
We instructed participants to stand whenever they felt they wanted and for durations
decided by them. No further instruction was given. Except for five meetings (covering three
participants) to which access was denied to non-invitees, a researcher attended each meeting
to observe participants’ standing behaviour, others’ responses, room layout and number of
attendees, though these field notes were not deemed sufficiently rich for analysis. A semi-struc-
tured interview (face-to-face or telephone) was conducted as soon as possible (and no longer
than 48 hours) after each meeting (i.e. 3 interviews per participant), to gather reflections on
experiences of standing. One participant (Amelia) attended her third meeting immediately
following the second meeting, and so completed one interview addressing both meetings.

 Interviews took place within the meeting venue or another setting within the participant’s
workplace, according to participant preference. Nobody else was present during interviews.
An interview schedule was developed to cover the fundamental determinants of standing
(capability, opportunity, motivation [34]), and piloted among three office-based colleagues of
the researchers. In all interviews, questions focused on affective reactions to standing; others’
reactions; standing location, timing and duration; occupational identity and status; workplace
culture and norms; and acceptability and feasibility of standing in meetings. In the third inter-
view, views towards workplace standing interventions were also sought. Each interview was
conducted by one of three female researchers, one of whom (JH) was a Social Sciences doctoral
student with previous experience of interviewing in the workplace sedentary behaviour
research domain, and two (MR, ER) were Health Psychology Masters students trained in inter-
viewing by the senior authors (LM, BG). Each participant was interviewed by the same inter-
viewer on three occasions. The only interviewer-participant contact prior to the first interview
was via email or telephone, for the purposes of organising the first interview. Participants were
told, prior to the interview, that the interviewer was conducting the study as part of a funded
research project (JH), or as coursework (MR, ER). No other interviewer characteristics were
shared with participants prior to the first interview. Interview duration ranged from 8-32mins
(mean 20mins).
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of each institution (LRU-15/16-
2533; 4385/002; 1875-LR-Jan/2016-1200). All participants provided fully informed written
consent to participate.
Analysis
Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, with transcript quality and
completeness verified by the researchers. We offered to return transcripts, and our ongoing or
completed analyses, to participants for comment, correction, or any other purpose, but none
expressed a wish to receive them.
Interview transcripts and analysis were managed via NVivo 10 software. A phenomenologi-
cal methodological orientation was adopted, as this allows for description (rather than quanti-
fication or explanation) of participants’ experiences, and exploration of the subjective
meanings that they ascribe to elements of these experiences. Data were analysed using Frame-
work Analysis, which allows inductive co-creation between multiple researchers of an initial
coding framework which guides subsequent analysis, and which is developed and iteratively
refined as coding progresses and new insights emerge [35–37]. Repeated and independent
reading of a sample of interview data from one institution was undertaken by two researchers
(JH, LM), to develop a preliminary coding framework. Next, selected interview transcripts
(n = 9/25) were read and re-read by four other researchers (MR, LS, ER, BG), who refined the
coding framework to ensure its accuracy and relevance. Discrepancies were resolved by discus-
sion, and resultant codes and themes verified by all researchers. The coding framework was

 used (by JH, LM, and BG) to analyse the remaining data. Given that data collection was con-
strained by the study timeline, data saturation was not discussed prior to analysis.
Quotes are provided below as evidence of the validity of our analysis [38]. All participants
were assigned pseudonyms. Punctuation was added to unambiguous quotes and where neces-
sary, words added in parentheses to clarify intended meaning.
Results
Four themes were derived from the data: physical challenges to standing; implications of
standing for meeting engagement; standing as norm violation; and standing as appropriation
of power. The first theme details experiences of physical discomfort and of attempts to negoti-
ate the physical environment to permit standing. The second theme reports different ways
in which standing impacted on participants’ involvement in meetings. The third and fourth
themes describe discrete psychological challenges involved in negotiating the organisational
and inter-person context that frames workplace meetings.
Theme 1: Physical challenges to standing
Some participants were aware of the detrimental impact of sitting and expected that standing
in meetings would confer health benefits (“you just perceive being standing up, it’s just better for
your health and it just makes you feel better overall”; James, Workplace A). Yet, the physical expe-
rience of standing in meetings rarely mapped onto participants’ expectations. Some reported
unexpected and unaccustomed discomfort from physical sensations in the muscles of the feet,
legs, back and shoulders, while others anticipated but did not experience physical discomfort:
I just thought, oh your back will ache or legs ache or something, but actually it wasn’t borne
out in reality.
(Tom, Workplace B).
The physical impact appeared partly due to the time spent standing, which was self-deter-
mined by participants. Some expected to be able to stand for the entirety of lengthy meetings,
but on attempting to do so realised this was not possible, due to physical discomfort:
After about twenty-five minutes . . . [I was] thinking oh my back is killing me! There’s the reali-
sation that, oh I can’t stand for very long!
(Joan, Workplace B)
Aspects of the physical environment–furniture design, spatial configuration, and the num-
bers and positions of attendees–also presented barriers and challenges to standing. Partici-
pants’ descriptions of their meeting room environments suggested that there were many
chairs, but no standing areas, nor desks and tables to support standing (a “lack of furniture for
standing”; Angela, Workplace C). The physical environment was felt to elicit sitting (“the
[physical] environment . . . kind of shapes social expectations [about standing] . . . we sit so
much”; Angela, Workplace C), which in turn reinforced perceptions that standing in meetings
was neither acceptable nor feasible:
Today, with the chairs all round, already set up, it makes it more of a barrier to actually saying
I’m going to stand. . . it’s so easy just to go, oh I’m going to sit down
(Tom, Workplace B)

 A lack of perceived environmental support for recording information when standing posed
practical difficulties for several participants, making engaging in the meeting non-ergonomic
and potentially physically uncomfortable:
Bending down and trying to take notes, it didn’t feel natural. It was just a question of the desk
or table not being at a certain height really
(Charlie, Workplace B)
Suggestions were made for overcoming barriers presented by ill-suited physical environ-
ments, including furniture adaptation, or using accessories to permit usual meeting engage-
ment while standing; for example, using a tablet instead of pen and paper for note-taking.
Theme 2: Implications of standing for meeting engagement
Many participants reported that standing affected their engagement in the meeting. Some
found that physical discomfort from standing motivated them to increase engagement to mini-
mise meeting length:
Because I was stood . . . [I was] kind of more, more ‘let’s get on with it, let’s get to the point’.
[. . .] Because it’s not so relaxed as being sat back in a chair . . . the perception is the meeting is
going on for longer, or more frustration if there’s no action being taken. [. . .] It’s more efficient.
(Tom, Workplace B)
Others felt that shifting from a relaxed, seated position to standing sustained focus on the
meeting, because standing prevented them from “switching off” (James, Workplace A) as they
would while sitting.
Many reported, at least in the first of the three meetings in which they stood, unanticipated
feelings of psychological discomfort from standing while all others were sitting, together with a
heightened awareness of the self, others, and the interpersonal context. Participants variously
felt “disconcerted” (Joan, Workplace B), “awkward” (Brianna, Workplace C), or “stupid”
(Charlie, Workplace B), possibly due to being more visible than others. Some reported that
enhanced visibility made them feel more accountable to others:
I tend to drift out or find them a bit boring. [. . .] Because I was both at the front of the room
and standing, I felt much more like I had to, even if I wasn’t engaged, look like I was more
engaged, which then made me more engaged. So I actually listened to the whole thing! [. . .] If I
started drifting out . . . I’d then get really self-conscious and think, oh God, what if somebody
saw me with my glazed-over eyes or something like that!
(Anne, Workplace C)
For others however, self-conscious thoughts were a distraction from the meeting:
When I did sit down, I was like (sighs). More relaxed. I could just focus on the meeting, not
focus on my standing.
(Brianna, Workplace C)
Some participants sought to minimise psychological discomfort by standing in a position
within the room that they perceived to be less visible, so avoiding obstructing others:

 I positioned myself right towards the back in the corner. . . it was OK to stand because I wasn’t
making a nuisance of myself to anybody, I wasn’t in any body’s way.
(Anusha, Workplace A)
However, physically removing themselves from others was experienced by some as isolat-
ing, and potentially limited involvement in interactions within the meeting:
Standing up made me . . . [feel] like I wasn’t part of the group. . . . [Once I sat down] I felt like I
was then part of the meeting. And it felt more like we were a team group coming to some deci-
sions and stuff, because we were all on the same eye level.
(Alisha, Workplace C)
I got missed out on the signing register. I didn’t draw attention to myself because I wanted
someone to notice me and give it to me, and they didn’t.
(Selma, Workplace C)
Some felt that other attendees were preoccupied with their standing, which might have
compromised the engagement of others, and limited overall satisfaction with the conduct of
meetings:
They were kind of looking at me instead of looking at the director. . . I think I just felt like I
was being a distraction for them [others in the meeting], I felt like I was taking away from the
meeting.
(Brianna, Workplace C)
Some were concerned that standing could be interpreted by others as unwillingness to fully
engage in the meeting, and indeed, a minority of participants reported being asked by others
to sit for this reason:
[In a meeting] you expect someone to sit down and then [if]they don’t you think, are you not
staying or do you not really want to have the meeting?
(Alisha, Workplace C)
She [the chair of the meeting] goes: “it’s really distracting with you standing up. It feels like
you’re getting ready to go, could you sit please?” So then I sat.
(Brianna, Workplace C)
Many felt it particularly inappropriate not to sit in formal meetings, or those addressing
sensitive topics, as it risked diminishing the seriousness of the meeting:
Knowing that [the meeting topic] is actually maybe quite confidential or sensitive, I don’t want
to be standing up. I need to be sitting down.
(Else, Workplace C)
Theme 3: Standing as norm violation
Many participants found that standing in all-seated meetings made salient the prevailing
implicit norm of sitting in meetings, and their deviation from this behavioural standard.

 As soon as it’s called a meeting, it formalises everything. There are just certain social expecta-
tions and standing is not one of them. [. . .] I felt like I was breaking the rule. [. . .] As with any
social norm, as soon as you’re in a position where you might be going against it, you suddenly
feel the weight of society’s expectations on you.
(Angela, Workplace C)
Participants worried that standing would be seen as a deliberate attempt to challenge the sit-
ting norm, and that they would be perceived by other attendees as “an attention seeker” (Ben,
Workplace B), willfully detracting from the business of the meeting. Some participants were
concerned that being seen to be violating the norm could potentially detrimentally impact
other attendees, and so the progression and outcomes of the meeting:
I would worry that I was making them [other attendees] uncomfortable and worry that they
wouldn’t be able to have the meeting that they wanted, and that they wouldn’t get out of it
what they wanted or not be able to talk as freely as they would normally.
(Alisha, Workplace C)
Characteristics of the meeting context–the perceived formality, purpose, type, length, and
size of the meeting, and relationships between attendees–shaped the standing experience for
many, often affecting the extent to which participants felt compelled to conform to the sitting
norm. Meeting contexts that made participants’ contravention of the sitting norm more prom-
inent were most aversively experienced. For example, meetings characterised by frequent
interaction between attendees, larger meetings, and those where other attendees were
unknown to the stander, were often cited as challenging. Many participants sought to deflect
unwanted attention and avoid misconceptions from others by forewarning other attendees of
their intention to stand, or seeking explicit permission from the meeting leader, in advance or
at the outset of the meeting. Most felt that they had to explain their decision to stand to others,
and while many truthfully cited involvement in our study, some felt that this provided insuffi-
cient justification, instead feigning ill-health to claim exemption from the sitting norm:
I lied and told them I had a health reason for needing to stand. [. . .] It’s just one of those things
that, unless you have a good enough excuse to stand, they’re going to assume that you’re just
being difficult.
(Anusha, Workplace A)
Several participants recounted episodes in which their decision to stand was misinterpreted
by others as reflecting a lack of opportunity to sit, which in turn was felt to obligate the partici-
pant to sit when such an opportunity was provided:
I probably stood for about a minute . . . and then someone else looked at me and they were ges-
turing that they’d saved me a seat! [. . .] I felt super awkward and sat down.

Theme 4: Standing as appropriation of power
Psychological discomfort appeared to arise not only from being seen to violate sitting norms,
but also because standing was felt to affect the power dynamics of the meeting. Standing in an
all-seated meeting was felt to symbolize status and authority within the meeting:

 You tend to think the more authoritative person, or the person that’s going to lead the conver-
sation, might be the one that’s a bit higher.
(Brianna, Workplace C)
Indeed, many reported that standing made them feel empowered:
I probably addressed everyone and raised my voice a little, projected it a bit more than I might
do . . . if I was seated. [. . .] [Standing is] a much more confidence-boosting posture.
(Joan, Workplace B)
Where the participant was hosting the meeting, the additional power conferred by standing
was deemed useful for denoting and exercising leadership (“I was the lead . . . so it seemed natu-
ral that I had that authoritative position”; Anusha, Workplace A). Where participants were not
leading the meeting, however, they worried that standing would be misconstrued as a tacit
attempt to appropriate power by challenging the authority of the meeting leader, or other,
more senior attendees:
If everyone’s sat down there and you’re up there, there’s, you know, almost a visual representa-
tion of a hierarchy in a weird way.
(Joan, Workplace B)
I stood up while [my manager] sat down. I felt uncomfortable because I felt like I was telling
her what to do, like I was like a teacher and she was a student because I was standing over her.
[. . .] I think she probably felt equally as uncomfortable.
(Angela, Workplace C)
Meetings featuring presentations by one attendee to the group were typically less problem-
atic, as were those in which senior attendees explicitly supported standing, because partici-
pants felt that there was little risk of standing being interpreted as an attempt to assert power
in such situations:
As a junior member in a meeting, I wouldn’t really be willing to stand up and say, well I’m
standing up because I want to stand up. [But] I’d be more willing to, if . . . someone more
senior said I’m standing up, I’d say, great, I’m going to join you.
(Amelia, Workplace B)
Meetings held in familiar social or physical settings, especially locations over which the par-
ticipant felt they already had ownership and authority (e.g. the participant’s office), were also
less psychologically uncomfortable:
Just the familiarity of the people in the team now, my relationship with the people in the team
makes it easy to stand, I’m comfortable, you know if anyone made, no one’s made really any
negative comments, but even if anyone did, I’d be comfortable just being like, well this is what I
want to do.

 Discussion
Standing in meetings is often proposed as a strategy by which to reduce workplace sitting [25,
29, 39, 40], but no study to our knowledge has yet documented how people experience stand-
ing in meetings in which all other attendees sit. Interviews with volunteers who stood in
planned workplace meetings revealed barriers that workers can expect to face if deciding to
stand where others are sitting, and potential facilitators. For many, the experience of standing
in meetings was uncomfortable in some way. Some participants experienced physical discom-
fort from standing for self-imposed lengthy periods and spoke of practical challenges posed by
the lack of suitability of meeting room furniture to standing. Perhaps moreover, participants
felt psychologically uncomfortable about standing. This apparently arose from concerns about
being seen to violate a compelling social norm favouring sitting, or being seen to be challeng-
ing the authority of other attendees by standing while others sat. Many participants chose to
reduce the potential impact of their standing on others by removing themselves to the edges of
the meeting room, though this risked limiting their involvement in the meeting. For meeting
hosts, standing was often found to confer greater power, and enhance confidence. Our find-
ings provide a much-needed illustration of the broader interpersonal and organizational con-
texts that frame workplace behaviour, and the difficulties these pose for standing in meetings.
Promoting standing in normally-seated meetings requires that office-based organisations and
workers anticipate these challenges.
It is important to mitigate potentially aversive consequences of standing in meetings; while
office workers generally appear willing to try standing in meetings [39, 40], they are unlikely to
continue to stand if initial attempts fail to attain expected positive outcomes or yield predomi-
nantly negative outcomes [33]. Our findings revealed several such negative outcomes, many of
which participants did not foresee. Many reported physical discomfort, sometimes identified
as pain, which appears to have been due to prolonged standing; many felt that they had to
stand for the entirety of meetings, though we did not instruct them to do so. This likely reflects
a misplaced belief among the public that the health risks of sitting can only be offset by pro-
longed standing [41]. Yet, standing still for long periods can also harm health [42–44]. A recent
expert consensus statement on workplace sitting and standing [16] advises that “prolonged,
static standing postures be avoided” (p1360), and that sitting be replaced by frequent sit-stand
transitions, standing, and light physical activity. While physical activity is unlikely to be feasi-
ble in meetings, workers in lengthy meetings could realistically be encouraged to build stand-
ing time gradually, stand only for as long as is comfortable, and regularly alternate between
sitting and standing.
Participants also described psychological discomfort resulting from ‘standing out’ from
others in the meeting. This echoes previous research showing that people report feeling
‘weird’ or self-conscious from standing in normally-seated workplace contexts [25]. For
many, such discomfort arose from knowingly violating a strong perceived social norm exert-
ing pressure to sit and not stand. These findings support the centrality of social norms as a
predictor of action, in potential competition with one’s own attitudes, such that people
sometimes act in a counter-attitudinal way to conform to social pressures [45, 46]. Indeed,
some participants reported that, despite wanting to stand, they aborted their standing
attempts early, in response to implicit or explicit pressure from others to sit. Experiences of
standing appeared to vary in accordance with the extent and visibility of perceived norm vio-
lation. In meetings in which standing seemed to more strongly contravene the implicit sit-
ting norm–such as larger meetings characterized by discussion among attendees–standing
produced stronger feelings of awkwardness. Particularly where highly emotive topics–such
as job losses–were under consideration, many participants felt that their decision to stand

 could be misinterpreted as a challenge to the seriousness of the meeting, or the authority of
attendees.
Standing also elicited psychological discomfort for some because they feared that their
standing would be interpreted as an assertion of power and authority over other attendees.
Indeed, for many animals, moving from sitting to standing can be a sign of dominance and
aggression [47], and previous research has documented concerns among office workers about
the potential for standing to be misconstrued as aggressive or threatening [40]. Concern about
such misperceptions was an especially powerful barrier to standing in meetings with more
senior colleagues. In meetings in which participants felt that standing could not perceived to
be an infraction–such as when standing to present information, or when participants consid-
ered they had a legitimate reason to stand–standing did not appear to elicit strong feelings.
Interestingly, however, many felt that current health problems precluding prolonged sitting
offered the only legitimate rationale for standing. This testifies to the perceived strength of the
sitting norm, and of being seen to respect established hierarchical relations within the meeting;
some believed that standing for the sake of health promotion (rather than management of ill-
health), or to honour commitments to participate in our study, did not constitute sufficient
reasons to disrupt norms or be seen to challenge the authority of others. Thus, where meetings
were held in settings over which the participant perceived a sense of ownership and authority–
such as where the participant was leading the meeting–standing was seen as less of a contra-
vention of norms, and no threat to established power dynamic, so did not evoke psychological
discomfort.
Together, our findings suggest several potentially fruitful strategies for overcoming norm
barriers. First, as many of our participants found, notifying others–especially meeting leaders–
of intentions to stand, or relocating to a less visible position in the room, can alleviate per-
ceived social pressure to sit. Relocation can, however, yield mixed consequences. In meetings
characterized by interaction among attendees, some participants felt that standing physically
and psychologically distanced them from collaborative discussions. Others reported that
standing could prompt more efficient meetings, due to the desire to minimize anticipated
physical discomfort from prolonged standing. Indeed, previous research suggests that standing
meetings tend to be shorter in duration than seated meetings, with no impact on the quality of
meeting outcomes [48]. Second, and more broadly, office-based organisations should explicitly
promote standing in meetings, to counter the perceived sitting norm, and thus empower those
who wish to stand without fear of infringing social expectations. Meeting hosts should also
encourage standing in meetings; participants often felt more confident standing when they
had secured prior approval from those leading the meeting. Hosts might, for example, suggest
that attendees must stand when speaking in contribution to a group discussion, a strategy
shown to be acceptable in principle in a study of employees in Belgium [29]. Managers may be
encouraged to support standing in meetings through emphasizing potential benefits to pro-
ductivity and staff time arising from shorter, more efficient meetings [25, 29, 48]. Third, there
is an urgent need to promote standing for health promotion purposes in the workplace, by
developing messages that frame standing as a legitimate strategy for sitting less. Given also the
pervasive culture of sitting cited by our participants, organisational buy-in, involving creating
and making salient and explicit a standing-permissive culture, will be central to the effective-
ness of promotional strategies for standing in meetings [27, 49]. Organisations can also facili-
tate standing in meetings by providing standing-appropriate infrastructure, such as meeting
spaces with high tables and stools [25]. While many participants adapted to standing in sit-
ting-conducive environments by using accessories (e.g. using tablets to take notes), restructur-
ing of the physical environment has been shown to be an effective upstream method for
reducing sitting among workers [20, 50, 51].

 Study limitations must be acknowledged. We did not assess participants’ prior sitting time
or the frequency with which they attended meetings, nor were measures taken of the length of
time for which participants stood, all of which may have influenced responses to standing.
Moreover, as we showed, the experience of standing in meetings is influenced by the perceived
responses of other attendees, but we did not collect data from meeting attendees other than
the standing participant. Standing may create psychological discomfort among non-standing
attendees, in turn feeding negative perceptions of the stander. While we have focused our prac-
tical recommendations on how to minimize feelings of discomfort among standers, effectively
promoting standing in meetings may perhaps also require understanding and assuaging
potentially negative experiences of non-standing attendees.
We sought to explore real-world experiences of standing in meetings, but study procedures
may have influenced such experiences. Participants may at least in part have been incentivized
to stand by the gift voucher incentive, or by the belief that participating in our study in this
way would contribute to scientific knowledge. It is thus possible that their reasons for and
experiences of standing among our sample may differ to those of employees who would stand
in meetings in more naturalistic settings, thus questioning the representativeness of the experi-
ences we documented. We sought to minimize our influence on the standing experience by
giving minimal instructions to participants, asking only that they attempt to stand for a self-
determined time. However, a lack of further instruction ironically appears to have had an
important influence on experiences; the physical discomfort reported by many was apparently
due to the misconception that participants should stand for as long as possible. Participants
may have had more positive experiences had they, for example, been advised on how best to
integrate standing into meetings, including setting realistic standing duration goals, and
informing meeting hosts and other attendees in advance. Nonetheless, our methods have doc-
umented the potential importance of informing others of decisions to stand, and of the poten-
tial for people to misunderstand advice to stand more as a recommendation to stand for as
long as possible [41]. We are confident that our findings offer valid insights of importance for
informing future guidance for incorporating standing into meetings.
Our sample was small and, while university employees span a socioeconomically broad
range, our participants were highly educated, which questions the generalizability of findings.
However, participants were recruited from three office-based university organisations, and
captured a diversity of meeting types, job roles and seniority. Moreover, our aim was not to
identify a generalizable set of experiences, but rather to capture and explore a range of reflec-
tions on the experience of standing in meetings. Indeed, while previous research has suggested
that office workers find the idea of standing in normally-seated meetings acceptable in princi-
ple, ours is the first study to document the rich complexity of the psychological, interpersonal
and organisational contexts that frame the standing experience.
Conclusions
Displacing sitting with standing at work requires an in-depth understanding of how to inte-
grate standing into normally-seated work practices. While meetings offer but one workplace
context in which sitting time might be reduced, our study demonstrates the complexity of this
specific context, which should be acknowledged by future workplace sitting reduction initia-
tives. Specifically, we have highlighted some important physical, psychological and social barri-
ers and facilitators that may determine whether someone feels sufficiently capable to break the
mould and stand in normally-seated meetings. Office workers must acknowledge that standing
in meetings will involve a period of acclimatisation to an unusual way of working. Many of our
participants learned to adapt to standing over the course of the three meetings, and so reduced

 initial physical and psychological discomfort. Strategies that may enable office workers to sus-
tainably adopt standing in meetings as a sitting-reduction strategy include building standing
time gradually, and alternating between sitting and standing, to alleviate physical discomfort,
and notifying attendees of intentions to stand, to avoid psychological discomfort from being
seen to be challenging norms and social hierarchy. Office managers should seek to provide vis-
ible organizational support for standing, including the explicit promotion of the acceptability
of standing in the workplace as a health promotion strategy, and provision of designated areas
of standing-supportive furniture.
