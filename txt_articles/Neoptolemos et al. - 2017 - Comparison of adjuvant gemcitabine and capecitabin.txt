Summary
Background The ESPAC-3 trial showed that adjuvant gemcitabine is the standard of care based on similar survival to 
and less toxicity than adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Other clinical 
trials have shown better survival and tumour response with gemcitabine and capecitabine than with gemcitabine 
alone in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and 
capecitabine compared with gemcitabine monotherapy for resected pancreatic cancer.
Methods We did a phase 3, two-group, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical trial at 92 hospitals in England, 
Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, and Sweden. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had undergone 
complete macroscopic resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (R0 or R1 resection). We randomly 
assigned patients (1:1) within 12 weeks of surgery to receive six cycles of either 1000 mg/m² gemcitabine alone 
administered once a week for three of every 4 weeks (one cycle) or with 1660 mg/m² oral capecitabine administered 
for 21 days followed by 7 days’ rest (one cycle). Randomisation was based on a minimisation routine, and country 
was used as a stratification factor. The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured as the time from 
randomisation until death from any cause, and assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Toxicity was analysed in 
all patients who received trial treatment. This trial was registered with the EudraCT, number 2007-004299-38, and 
ISRCTN, number ISRCTN96397434.
Findings Of 732 patients enrolled, 730 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 366 were randomly assigned to 
receive gemcitabine and 364 to gemcitabine plus capecitabine. The Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
requested reporting of the results after there were 458 (95%) of a target of 480 deaths. The median overall survival for 
patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group was 28·0 months (95% CI 23·5–31·5) compared with 25·5 months 
(22·7–27·9) in the gemcitabine group (hazard ratio 0·82 [95% CI 0·68–0·98], p=0·032). 608 grade 3–4 adverse events 
were reported by 226 of 359 patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group compared with 481 grade 3–4 adverse 
events in 196 of 366 patients in the gemcitabine group.
Interpretation The adjuvant combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine should be the new standard of care following 
resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Introduction
In 2012, an estimated 338 000 new cases of pancreatic 
cancer were diagnosed worldwide and 331 000 people died 
from pancreatic cancer.1 Pancreatic cancer is likely to 
become the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the 
near future because therapies for other cancers are 
becoming more advanced than those for pancreatic cancer 
and because the prevalence of pancreatic cancer is 
increasing globally.1 In patients with advanced pancreatic 
cancer, 1 year survival has slightly improved because of the 
wider use of systemic chemotherapy1 and, more recently, the 
use 
of 
combination 
chemotherapies,2–5 
including 
gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine2 or nab-
paclitaxel,3 and a regimen comprising folinic acid, 
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX).5 
Surgical techniques have also substantially improved, 
allowing more patients to undergo resection,1 but 5 year 
survival with tumour removal alone is generally less than

10%.6–8 After resection, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy 
with either 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid or gemcitabine 
doubled 5 year survival to around 16–21%.6–10 The role of 
adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with or without systemic 
chemotherapy has been questioned, but systemic 
chemotherapy is generally accepted as the established 
standard of care.1,6,7,11,12 Gemcitabine does not increase 
survival compared with 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid in 
the adjuvant setting,13 although gemcitabine has been the 
drug of choice because of a better safety profile than 
5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid.6–8,13
We aimed to assess whether overall survival could be 
improved by using combination systemic chemotherapy 
in the adjuvant setting. For this, we chose to use 
gemcitabine and capecitabine because this combination 
has synergism between the intracellular metabolites of 
capecitabine and gemcitabine on thymidylate synthase 
involved in normal DNA synthesis. Clinical trials 
in the advanced setting have shown that this com-
bination produces a better tumour response, improved 
progression free survival, and improved overall survival 
by meta-analysis compared with monotherapy, while 
maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile.2,4
Methods
Study design and patients
We did a phase 3, two-group, open-label, multicentre, 
randomised clinical trial at 92 hospitals in England, 
Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, and Sweden. Eligible 
patients were aged 18 years or older and had 
undergone complete macroscopic resection for ductal 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (R0 or R1 resection)14 
with histological confirmation and with no evidence of 
malignant ascites, liver or peritoneal metastasis, or 
spread to other distant abdominal, or extra-abdominal 
organs. A clear CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
was required within 3 months before randomisation. No 
restriction was placed on randomisation on the basis 
of postoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 
concentrations. Other specific inclusion criteria were full 
recovery from surgery, a WHO performance score of two 
or less, creatinine clearance of at least 50 mL/min, and a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In developing this trial, we undertook several systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses between March, 2006, and March, 
2007, in both the advanced and adjuvant settings. We searched 
MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, CancerLit, Embase, ISI Web of Science, 
ISI Science and Technology Proceedings, current contents 
databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings, and 
results identified included randomised controlled trials 
involving patients with advanced or resected pancreatic cancer 
of chemotherapy, novel drugs, radiotherapy, 
chemoradiotherapy, and best supportive care. We were directly 
involved in the ESPAC-1plus, ESPAC-1, ESPAC-3(v1), and 
ESPAC-3(v2) adjuvant trials of resected pancreatic cancer. We 
were also directly involved in the GemCap trial which compared 
the combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine to 
gemcitabine alone in advanced and metastatic pancreatic 
cancer. In the adjuvant setting, the role of chemoradiotherapy 
was rejected by ESPAC-1plus, which had a pragmatic design 
comprising randomisation either to chemoradiotherapy plus 
chemotherapy or or to no chemoradiotherapy plus 
chemotherapy or alternatively to chemotherapy alone and no 
adjuvant treatment, and also a 2 × 2 factorial design of 
chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy and 
chemoradiotherapy versus no chemoradiotherapy. Although 
there was scepticism with respect to the efficacy of 5-fluoruracil 
and folinic acid used in these studies, comparison with the 
control groups of ESPAC-1plus, ESPAC-1, and ESPAC-3(v1) 
confirmed the superior survival value of this regimen compared 
with no chemotherapy. ESPAC-3(v2) showed that adjuvant 
gemcitabine was not superior to 5-fluoruracil and folinic acid 
for survival, and, hence, there was a wider choice of proven 
chemotherapies that could be used to enhance survival over 
single drugs. In ESPAC-4, we chose the combination of 
gemcitabine and capecitabine (an orally active 5-fluoruracil 
prodrug) to compare with gemcitabine, as the combination had 
a higher objective response, increased progression-free 
survival,and increased overall survival in a meta-analysis of the 
two randomised trials compared with gemcitabine 
monotherapy. Before this study, the evidence was that the best 
estimated 5 year survival after resection for pancreatic cancer 
was with adjuvant chemotherapy using either 5-fluorouracil 
plus folinic acid from ESPAC-1 (21·1% [95% CI 14·6–28·5]) and 
from ESPAC-3(v2) (15·9% [12·7–19·4]), or gemcitabine from 
ESPAC-3(v2) (17·5% [14·0–21·2]). For comparison, estimated 
5 year survival with resection and no chemotherapy was 8·0% 
(3·8–14·1) and with chemoradiotherapy was 10·8% (6·1–17·0), 
as shown in ESPAC-1.
Added value of this study
In ESPAC-4, estimated 5 year survival confirmed the 
ESPAC-3(v2) estimates for gemcitabine. Survival favoured 
adjuvant gemcitabine plus capecitabine in most clinical 
subgroups, including patients with R1 resection margins. This 
was a pragmatic trial including all patients who had undergone 
resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma including WHO 
performance status 0, 1 and 2, R1 resection margins, and all 
patients irrespective of postoperative CA19-9 concentration. 
The improved survival results were achieved without any 
significant increase in overall toxicity and was manageable with 
protocol driven capecitabine dose reduction when required.
Implications of all the available evidence
The ESPAC-4 trial establishes the combination of gemcitabine 
and capecitabine as the treatment of choice in the adjuvant 
setting after resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

life expectancy of more than 3 months. Patients who had 
previously had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or other 
concomitant chemotherapy and with pancreatic lymph-
oma, macroscopically remaining tumours (R2 resection), 
or TNM stage IV disease15 were excluded.
Ethical approval was provided by the Liverpool Adult 
Research Ethics Committee on March 4, 2008. Ethical 
approval was also obtained in each of the other participating 
countries. The study conformed to the principles of the 
International Conference on Harmonization on Good 
Clinical Practice, and was undertaken by the Liverpool 
Clinical and Cancer Research UK Trials Unit. All 
participants provided written informed consent before 
randomisation. The protocol is available online.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 
gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus capecitabine within 
12 weeks of surgery by trained authorised staff within the 
Liverpool Clinical and Cancer Trials Unit. Randomisation 
was based on a minimisation routine with a random 
element of 20% including the resection margin (negative 
or positive) and country was used as a stratification factor. 
Participants and study investigators were not masked to 
treatment allocation.
Procedures
Gemcitabine was delivered as a 1000 mg/m² intravenous 
infusion administered once a week for three of every 
4 weeks (one cycle) for six cycles (24 weeks). Capecitabine 
was administered orally for 21 days followed by 7 days’ 
rest (one cycle) for six cycles (24 weeks) at a daily dose of 
1660 mg/m². Patients were reviewed every 3 months 
after surgery for 5 years if alive at this point. The specific 
method of follow-up (haematology, clinical chemistry, 
and use of a tumour marker) at each clinic visit was 
determined by each site because of wide variations in 
routine clinical practice.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival, measured as 
the time from randomisation until death from any 
cause. Patients still alive at the point of final analysis 
were censored at the date last seen alive. Secondary 
endpoints included survival estimates at 24 months, 
5 year survival, and relapse-free survival measured as the 
minimum time from randomisation to date of local 
tumour recurrence, lymph node spread, distant 
metastases, or death from any cause. Toxicity was graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute common 
toxicity criteria, version 4.03. Quality-of-life was assessed 
using the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ) C-30, version 3. The 5 year survival 
estimates were also calculated for the ESPAC-3 trial 
(version 2), which were not previously available at the 
time of publication.13
Statistical analysis
This trial was designed to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0·74 between the gemcitabine and gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine groups. With the use of a two-sided α level 
of 0·05, 480 events were required to obtain 90% power to 
detect a difference between treatment groups. We 
estimated that 480 events could be obtained by enrolling 
722 patients (361 in each group) over a period of 6 years 
(reaching a maximum recruitment rate of 13 patients per 
month) and allowing each patient to have a minimum 
follow-up of 2 years. The sample size was inflated to 
account for patient withdrawals (10%) and patients who 
were lost to follow-up (5%) at the time of analysis.
We estimated overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. We analysed the primary endpoint with a 
stratified log-rank test,16 with the treatment effect 
expressed as an HR (gemcitabine plus capecitabine vs 
gemcitabine) and 95% CI. Median and 5 year survival 
estimates are presented with 95% CIs. Further analyses 
were done by adjusting the treatment effect using 
multivariable regression techniques based on the Cox 
proportional hazard17 model and using multiple 
imputation18 based on chained equations to impute 
missing data of key prognostic covariates. 50 imputed 
datasets were used with variable estimates obtained with 
the use of Rubin’s rules. Factors with a p value less than 
0·25 using a univariate log-rank test were explored 
further in the multivariable setting using backward 
selection techniques based on Akaikes Information 
Criterion.19 Assumptions of proportional hazards were 
assessed by assessment of the Schoenfeld residuals.20
The number of patients receiving treatment, the 
percentage of patients receiving treatment as per the 
protocol, and the range of total doses received are 
reported. The median follow-up was calculated with the 
reverse Kaplan-Meier method.21 The number of patients 
experiencing at least one high-grade (3 or 4) toxic episode 
or serious adverse event is also reported as a percentage 
of the total number of patients in the safety set within 
each treatment group. Proportions were compared with 
Fisher’s exact test with the significance level set at 
p values less than 0·05. Further comparisons of toxicity 
between treatment groups were done according to short-
term acute toxicity, adverse long-term late effects, and 
mortality risk generated by a treatment programme 
(TAME) method guidelines.22 Quality of life was assessed 
as a longitudinal covariate which was modelled jointly23 
with overall survival, in which both longitudinal and 
survival models were adjusted for key prognostic 
covariates.
All efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat 
population retaining all patients in their initially 
randomised 
groups 
irrespective 
of 
any 
protocol 
deviations with the exception of patients who withdrew 
consent between randomisation and the start of therapy. 
Toxicity was analysed in all patients who received trial 
treatment according to the treatment they received.

Interim analyses for efficacy were included after 
100, 200, 300, and 400 deaths. Efficacy was determined 
with the use of Peto boundaries, and no adjustments to 
the final α level were required.24 These analyses were 
undertaken by the Independent Safety and Data 
Monitoring 
Committee 
in 
a 
strictly 
controlled 
confidential manner. The Independent Safety and Data 
Monitoring Committee was also responsible for 
assessing the trial in terms of safety and had full access 
to all of the data throughout the course of the trial. Final 
decisions on the conduct of the trial were taken by the 
Trial Steering Committee, which received recom-
mendations from the Independent Safety and Data 
Monitoring Committee and support from the Trial 
Management Group. All statistical analyses were done 
with SAS version 9.3 and Stata version 13.1. A two-sided 
significance level of p values less than 0·05 was used 
throughout. This trial was registered with the EudraCT, 
number 
2007-004299-38, 
and 
ISRCTN, 
number 
ISRCTN96397434.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. Following the decision of the Independent Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee to recommended early 
publication, JPN, EEP, DHP, PG, and RJ had full access to 
all the data in the study from Dec 11, 2015. They take full 
responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy 
of the data analysis. The corresponding author took the 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
Between Nov 10, 2008, and Sept 11, 2014, 732 patients 
were randomly assigned. The target was 722 patients, but 
the extra 10 patients were recruited for pragmatic 
reasons. At the time of recruitment termination, there 
were patients at different sites still considering joining 
the trial. If they wished to join the trial, we allowed them 
to do so for ethical reasons. The data cutoff date was 
March 9, 2016. 367 patients were randomly assigned to 
receive gemcitabine alone and 365 were randomly 
assigned to receive gemcitabine plus capecitabine 
(figure 1). Two patients were excluded from the full 
analysis set as they withdrew consent between 
randomisation and starting therapy (one in each group). 
The Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
recommended early publication based on a clear signal 
of efficacy, and this was accepted on Dec 11, 2015, by the 
Trial Steering Committee. Demographic and pathological 
details of the patients by group are shown in table 1. 
Eight patients who had stage IV pancreatic tumours but 
had complete surgical clearance and were anxious to join 
the trial were enrolled in the study.
The median follow-up time was 43·2 months (95% CI 
39·7–45·5). The median overall survival time was 
25·5 months (22·7–27·9) in the gemcitabine group 
and 28·0 months (23·5–31·5) in the gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine (HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·68–0·98], p=0·032), 
favouring the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group 
(figure 2). Estimated overall survival was 80·5% (95% CI 
76·0–84·3) at 12 months and 52·1% (46·7–57·2) at 
24 months in the gemcitabine group and 84·1% 
(79·9–87·5) at 12 months and 53·8% (48·4–58·8) at 
24 months in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group. 
The median overall survival for patients in the 
gemcitabine group who had positive resection margins 
(R1 status) was 23·0 months (95% CI 21·6–26·2) and in 
patients who had negative resection margins (R0 status) 
was 27·9 months (23·8–34·6). Median overall survival for 
patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group was 
23·7 months (20·7–27·1) in patients with R1 status and 
39·5 months (32·0–58·0) in patients with R0 status 
(χ²1df,trend=14·83, p=0·0001; figure 2). Sensitivity analyses 
done in the per-protocol population did not differ 
significantly from the primary analysis of the intention-
to-treat population.
Univariate survival analyses showed that smoking, 
preoperative, and postoperative CA19-9 concentrations, 
preoperative C-reactive protein concentrations, resection 
margin status, tumour grade, lymph nodes status, 
maximum tumour size, tumour stage, venous resection, 
and local invasion were all associated with survival 
(p<0·05; table 2) but not performance status (appendix).

Postoperative CA19-9 concentration and maximum 
tumour size were included in the multivariable Cox 
proportional hazards model under non-linear trans-
formations. The stratification factors of resection margin 
and country were forced inclusions as main effects in the 
model. Multiple imputation was used to correct for 
missing data for postoperative CA19-9 concentration 
(n=68), maximum tumour size (n=15), and tumour grade 
(n=3). A model based on 730 patients (446 deaths) 
identified resection margin status, postoperative CA19-9 
concentrations, tumour grade, lymph node status, and 
maximum tumour size as significant independent factors 
of overall survival (table 2). Gemcitabine and capecitabine 
had a statistically significant treatment effect compared 
with gemcitabine alone (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·66–0·96], 
p=0·016). Assessment of Schoenfeld’s residuals did not 
identify any covariates that violated the proportional 
hazards assumption. Median postoperative CA19-9 
concentrations were 17·7 KU/L (9·0–44·0) in the resection 
margin-negative group and 20·0 KU/L (9·0–63·5) in the 
resection margin-positive groups (p=0·11 unpaired t test 
on the log-transformed data).
For comparison with the CONKO-018 and JASPAC-125 
trials, we further analysed survival data using cutoff
 
points for postoperative CA19-9 concentrations of more 
than 92·5 KU/L and more than 37 KU/L. 68 (9%) patients 
in our study had missing postoperative CA19-9 values. 
549 
(83%) 
patients 
had 
postoperative 
CA19-9 
concentrations of 92·5 KU/L or lower with a median 
survival of 29·6 months (26·6–32·1) and 5-year survival 
of 24·9% (20·0–31·0). 113 (17%) patients had CA19-9 
concentrations higher than 92·5 KU/L with a median 
survival of 13·1 months (10·8–16·2) and 5 year survival 
was not obtained. 452 (68%) of 662 patients had a CA19-9 
concentration of 37 KU/L or lower with a median survival 
of 31·8 months (29·5–38·0) and a 5 year survival of 
25·6% (20·0–32·8) and 210 (32%) patients had 
postoperative CA19-9 concentrations of more than 
37 KU/L with median survival of 16·0 months (14·1–17·9) 
and 5 year survival of 14·9% (0·10–22·6). Comparisons 
of postoperative CA19.9 by treatment arms for ESPAC-4, 
CONKO-001, and JASPAC01 are shown in table 3.
557 (76%) patients had a relapse or died. Of these,

were in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group. The 
median relapse-free survival was 13·1 months (11·6–15·3) 
in the gemcitabine group and 13·9 months (12·1–16·6) in 
the gemcitabine and capecitabine group (HR 0·86, 95% 
CI 0·73–1·02, p=0·082; appendix). 3 year relapse-free 
survival was 20·9% (16·5–25·7) and 5 year relapse-free 
survival was 11·9% (7·8–16·9) for the gemcitabine group, 
whereas for the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group, 
3 year relapse-free survival was 23·8% (19·2–28·6) and 
5 year relapse-free survival was 18·6% (13·8–24·0; 
appendix). 479 (66%) of 730 patients had tumour 
recurrence, of whom 243 (66%) were in the gemcitabine 
group and 236 (65%) were in the gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine group. 78 (11%) patients died without 
radiological evidence of tumour recurrence. Specific sites 
of tumour recurrence at relapse are given in table 4.
94 (39%) of 243 patients in the gemcitabine group with 
relapse and 77 (33%) of 236 patients in the gemcitabine 
plus capecitabine group with relapse received additional 
treatment. In the gemcitabine group, additional treatment 
comprised chemotherapy in 77 (32%) patients, chemo-
radiotherapy in 10 (4%) patients, surgery in 12 (5%) 
patients, and other treatment in 5 (2%) patients, with some 
patients having multiple treatments. Additional treatment 
in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group comprised 
chemotherapy in 72 (31%) patients, chemoradiotherapy in 
10 (4%) patients, surgery in 8 (3%) patients, and other 
treatment in 5 (2%) patients. Of the 243 patients in the 
gemcitabine group who relapsed, 38 (16%) patients had 
capecitabine in some form as additional chemotherapy.

and ESPAC-4 adjuvant treatment trials (appendix). In the 
ESPAC-1 trial, estimated 5 year survival was 21·1% 
(95% CI 14·6–28·5) for the chemotherapy group 
(5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid), 8·0% (3·8–14·1) in the 
no chemotherapy group, and 10·8% (6·1–17·0) in 
the group randomised to chemoradiotherapy.7 In the 
ESPAC-3(v2) trial, estimated 5 year survival was 17·5% 
(14·0–21·2) for patients in the gemcitabine group and 
15·9% (12·7–19·4) for patients in the 5-fluorouracil plus 
folinic acid group. In the ESPAC-4 trial, estimated 5 year 
survival was 16·3% (10·2–23·7) for patients randomised 
to gemcitabine, and 28·8% (22·9–35·2) for patients 
randomised to gemcitabine plus capecitabine. Adjuvant 
gemcitabine plus capecitabine favoured survival in most 
clinical subgroups (figure 3).
1877 cycles of gemcitabine were given to 365 (100%) 
patients in the gemcitabine group, and 1724 cycles of 
gemcitabine plus capecitabine were given to 361 (98%) 
patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group. One 
(<1%) patient in the gemcitabine group, and six (2%) 
patients in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group did 
not start treatment. All six cycles of treatment were given 
to 239 (65%) patients in the gemcitabine group and to 
195 (54%) in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group.
The median dose intensity was 93% (5–104) of the 
planned protocol for the gemcitabine group, and 83% 
(5–114) for gemcitabine and 78% (0·8–100) for capecitabine 
in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group. The median 
cumulative dose of gemcitabine was 16 750 mg/m² in the 
gemcitabine group, and 15 000 mg/m² in the gemcitabine 
plus capecitabine group. The median cumulative dose of 
capecitabine was 162 680 mg/m². 458 (63%) patients died, 
239 (65%) of 366 patients in the gemcitabine group and 
219 (60%) of 364 patients in the gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine group. 127 (35%) of 366 patients in the 
gemcitabine group stopped treatment before the end of 
the sixth cycle due to toxicity in 52 (41%), disease 
progression in 32 (25%), patient decision in 13 (10%),

death in three (2%), treatment never started in 1 (1%), lack 
of efficacy in 1 (1%), various other reasons in 11 (9%), and 
unknown reasons in 14 (11%). 169 (46%) of 364 patients in 
the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group stopped 
treatment before the end of the sixth cycle because of 
toxicity in 79 (47%), disease progression in 17 (10%), 
patient decision in 21 (12%), death in 4 (2%), treatment 
never started in three (2%), various other reasons in 
7 (4%), and unknown reasons in 38 (22%).
725 (99%) patients were in the safety set and were 
analysed for adverse events. Of these, 366 received 
gemcitabine alone, and 359 received gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine (table 5). 180 (25%) of the 725 patients reported 
305 treatment-related serious adverse events. 94 (26%) 
patients of the 366 who received gemcitabine had 
151 events, and 86 (24%) of the 359 patients who received 
gemcitabine plus capecitabine had 154 events (p>0·05). 
There were 608 grade 3–4 events reported by 226 of 
359 patients in the gemcitabine with capecitabine group 
compared with 481 grade 3–4 events in 196 of 366 patients 
in the gemcitabine group. The mean expected high-grade 
acute adverse event (within 30 days of treatment 
completion) was 0·89 in the gemcitabine group and 1·2 in 
the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group.23 The corr-
esponding high-grade late adverse event (after 30 days of 
treatment completion) was 0·3 in the gemcitabine group 
and 0·4 in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group.23
Quality-of-life questionnaires were completed by 
665 patients, 334 in the gemcitabine group and 321 in the 
gemcitabine plus capecitabine group. Questionnaires at 
3, 6, and 12 months were completed by 496, 452, and 
388 patients, respectively. Joint modelling included an 
intercept term for treatment group but not a time-by-
treatment interaction as this did not improve the overall 
model fit. The results showed no significant effect in the 
longitudinal estimate of quality of life by treatment group 
(HR –0·10, 95% CI –0·29 to 0·09, p=0·3).
Discussion
This study has shown that survival with adjuvant 
chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus capecitabine 
significantly increased overall survival compared with 
gemcitabine alone after resection for pancreatic cancer. 
This occurred with an acceptable level of toxicity as 
predicted from the previous phase 3 trial in the advanced 
and metastatic setting.3 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 
more common in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine 
group (38%) than in the gemcitabine group (24%), but 
the rate of febrile neutropenia was low in both groups 
and there were fewer other infective manifestations in 
the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group (3%) compared 
with the gemcitabine group alone (7%). As expected, 
more grade 3 and 4 diarrhoea events occurred with 
gemcitabine 
plus 
capecitabine 
(5%) 
than 
with 
gemcitabine alone (2%). The only grade 3 and 4 hand-
foot syndrome events occurred with the combination 
chemotherapy, but this only affected 7% of patients and 
was generally manageable with appropriate capecitabine 
dose modification.
The improvement in overall survival with systemic 
chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid 
shown in the ESPAC-1 trial represented a step change 
in survival after resection for pancreatic cancer, 
doubling the estimated 5 year survival to 21·1% (95% CI 
14·6–28·5) compared with 8·0% (3·8–14·1) for surgery 
alone or 10·8% (6·1–17·0) for chemoradiotherapy.6,7 
The ESPAC-3 trial was important in showing that 
gemcitabine was not superior to 5-fluorouracil plus 
folinic acid and so pointed to the potential combination 
use of gemcitabine with 5-fluorouracil plus folinic 
acid.13 The CONKO-001 trial8 estimated a 5 year overall 
survival of 20·7% (14·7–26·6) in patients who received 
gemcitabine, which was slightly better than that 
estimated for gemcitabine in ESPAC-4. Similarly, the 
estimated 5 year overall survival in the control group of 
the CONKO-001 trial (no adjuvant chemotherapy) of 
10·4% (5·9–15·0) was also slightly better than that 
estimated in the no chemotherapy groups of ESPAC-16,7 
and ESPAC-3(v1).9 These results need to be considered 
in the context of the inclusion criteria of CONKO-001, 
which specified that no patient with a postoperative 
CA19-9 concentration greater than 2·5 times the upper 
limit (92·5 KU/L) would be included.8 As shown in both 
the ESPAC-3(v2)13 and ESPAC-4 trials, the concentration 
of postoperative blood CA19-9 is a powerful independent 
predictor of survival (table 2). The quartile of patients 
with 
the 
highest 
postoperative 
blood 
CA19-9 
concentrations had significantly lower overall survival 
than the other quartiles but still with significant survival 
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (appendix).
In ESPAC-4, 113 (17%) patients had postoperative 
CA19-9 concentrations higher than 92·5 KU/L with a 
median survival of 13·1 (10·8–16·2) months compared 
with those with a CA19-9 concentration of 92·5 KU/L or 
lower and a median survival of 29·6 (26·6–32·1) months. 
Other differences relating to independent prognostic 
variables between CONKO-001 and ESPAC-4 were 
tumour grade 3 (36% vs 40%, respectively), and lymph 
node positivity (68% vs 80%, respectively). Resection

margin positivity in CONKO-001 used the TNM system 
general definition of microscopic residual tumour, 
compared with the ESPAC-4 definition of any tumour cell 
within 1 mm of any surface of the specimen and this 
might account for some of the difference in the proportion 
of R1 cases reported in the two studies (17% vs 60% 
respectively). Overall, the patients in the ESPAC-4 trial 
appear to have had worse independent prognostic 
variables than those in CONKO-001, which makes the 
survival results of ESPAC-4 even more notable.
The ESPAC-4 trial has shown a further step change in 
overall survival with gemcitabine plus capecitabine, with 
an estimated 5 year overall survival of 28·8% (22·9–35·2) 
compared with 16·3% (10·2–23·7) with gemcitabine, 
and also compared with 15·9% (12·7–19·4) with 
5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid in the ESPAC-1 trial.7
Capecitabine is an orally active, tumour-selective, 
fluoropyrimidine 
carbamate 
providing 
prolonged 
fluorouracil exposure at lower peak concentrations. We 
have shown that the improvements in tumour response 
and disease control observed with gemcitabine plus 
capecitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer3 can translate 
into a clear effect in the adjuvant setting. The JASPAC-1 
pancreas cancer adjuvant trial has also shown superior 
survival with S-1, an orally active fluoropyrimidine 
compared with gemcitabine.25 Estimated overall 5 year 
survival was 44·1% (36·9–51·1)% in the S-1 group and 
24·4% (18·6–30·8) in the gemcitabine group.25 The 
JASPAC-1 trial was undertaken in a group of patients 
with favourable prognostic features compared with the 
ESPAC trials. In the JASPAC-1 trial, 69% of the patients 
had a performance status of 0 compared with 42% in 
ESPAC-4, and 37% had an N0 status compared with only 
20% in ESPAC-4.25 The definition of R1 in JASPAC-1 was 
the microscopic presence of tumour cells at the surface 
of the resection margin and was present in 13% of 
specimens compared with 60% in ESPAC-4, where the 
definition was any tumour cell within 1 mm of any 
surface of the specimen and may account for some, but 
certainly not all, of the discrepancy.15 In JASPAC-1, 
99 (26%) of the 377 patients included in the analysis had 
a CA19-9 concentration greater than the upper limit of 
normal (37 KU/L) compared with 32% in the ESPAC-4 
trial. The higher survival figures for gemcitabine in this 
trial compared with either ESPAC-3(v2) or ESPAC-4 
might be accounted at least partly for by the inclusion of 
patients with better prognostic features in JASPAC-1. 
Lymph node status, performance status, and resection 
margin status are all independent significant survival 
factors shown in both ESPAC-3(v2) and ESPAC-4 (table 2, 
appendix). Europeans had higher toxicity with S-1 than 
Asians at equivalent doses because of differences in 
metabolism, so the findings of JASPAC-1 will be limited 
by ethnic considerations and trials of S-1 are required to 
assess its efficacy in whites.25

13·1 months in the gemcitabine monotherapy group 
compared with 11·3 and 13·4 months respectively in the 
JASPAC-125 and CONKO-0018 studies. This might be 
because of the high median dose intensity of 
gemcitabine delivered in the monotherapy group 
comprising 93% of the planned protocol in ESPAC-4, 
compared with a median of 84% and 86% in the 
gemcitabine groups in the JASPAC-125 and CONKO-0018 
studies respectively. In the JASPAC-1 trial, 149 (78%) 
patients had a relapse in the gemcitabine group and 
123 (66%) had a relapse in the S-1 group.25 In ESPAC-4, 
243 (66%) patients had a relapse in the gemcitabine 
group compared with 236 (65%) patients in the 
combination group. Despite the similarities between 
the JASPAC-1 and ESPAC-4 trials in overall relapse, 
major differences were found in the frequency of 
tumour site recurrences, including local site recurrence 
(26% vs 53%), and liver metastases (26% vs 44%, 
respectively) in each of the respective gemcitabine 
groups. The reason for such discrepancies is unclear.
The proportion of patients who had salvage therapy in 
ESPAC-4 was relatively low; 94 (39%) of 243 patients in the 
gemcitabine group with relapse and 77 (33%) of 236 patients 
in the gemcitabine plus capecitabine group with relapse 
received additional treatment. In the JASPAC-1 trial, 
79 (42%) of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group stopped 
treatment before completion compared with 127 (35%) of 
366 patients in the ESPAC-4 trial, but only 52 (28%) of 
187 patients that started S-1 in JASPAC-1 stopped treatment 
before completion compared with 169 (46%) patients in the 
combination group of ESPAC-4.25 Nevertheless, 127 (69%) 
of the patients in the gemcitabine group of JASPAC-1 
received second-line therapy (83 had S-1 based treatment) 
and 105 of 187 patients in the S-1 group (70 had gemcitabine 
based treatment).25 Numerous factors should be considered 
among these and other trials in comprehending these 
differences including the distribution of adverse prognostic 
factors, the total dose intensity of per protocol therapy 
administered, the cumulative toxicity and fatigue, and 
other factors that might affect the ability to deliver second-
line salvage therapy.
Patients with R0 resections in ESPAC-4 had better 
survival than those with R1 resection margins, but a 
substantial survival benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy 
was still observed in those with R1 resection margins 
(figure 1). Adjuvant gemcitabine plus erlotinib did not 
improve survival in patients with R0 pancreatic cancer 
resections (CONKO-005).26 Further progress might be 
achieved through other combinations that have shown 
activity in advanced pancreatic cancer, with ongoing 
trials 
including 
the 
use 
of 
nab-paclitaxel 
plus 
gemcitabine,3 FOLFIRINOX,5 5-fluorouracil folinic acid, 
oxaliplatin 
and 
irinotecan 
(FOLFOXIRI),27 
and 
gemcitabine, cisplatin, epirubicin, and capecitabine 
in stage I to II pancreatic cancers (PACT-15).28 The 
RTOG 0848 adjuvant phase 3 trial (NCT01013649) aims 
to determine the survival benefit for fluoropyrimidine-
based chemoradiotherapy after 5 months recurrence free 
survival from the start of adjuvant chemotherapy using 
either 
gemcitabine-based 
chemotherapy 
or 
non-
gemcitabine based chemotherapy, such as modified 
FOLFIRINOX. Additional traction might be gained by 
the further assessment of therapeutic predictive response 
markers such as the human equilibrative nucleotide

optimum treatment regimens.29,30 However in patients 
with resected pancreatic cancer, the results of ESPAC-4 
indicate that adjuvant gemcitabine plus capecitabine is 
the new standard of care.
Contributors
Development of the study design was supported by the European Study 
Group for Pancreatic Cancer led by JPN, PG, DHP, CMH, JWV, DAO, 
DC, PL, PH RJ, and MWB. The study was supported and conducted 
through National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) of the UK Pancreatic 
Cancer Sub-Group and the Cancer Research UK Liverpool Cancer Trials 
Unit (of the Liverpool Clinical Trials Unit). EEP and RJ were responsible 
for detailed statistical analysis. JPN, PG, DHP, RJ, and EEP interpreted 
the data and prepared the initial draft of the report; they also collated 
changes proposed by all of the authors into the final draft paper before 
final approval by all of the named co-authors. All authors gave final 
approval of the version to be published. The specialists, who also 
contributed to the recruitment, treatment, and follow-up of patients as 
trial site principle investigators, are listed in the appendix.
