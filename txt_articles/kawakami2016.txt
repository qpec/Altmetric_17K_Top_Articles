Abstract Spontaneous smiles are facial movements that
are characterized by lip corner raises that occur during
irregular sleep or drowsiness without known external or
internal causes. They are shown by human infants and
infant chimpanzees. These smiles are considered to be the
developmental origin of smiling and laughter. There are
some case studies showing that spontaneous smiles occur
in Japanese macaques. The goals of this study were to
investigate whether newborn Japanese macaques show a
considerable number of spontaneous smiles thus to exam-
ine the mechanism of them. Seven newborn Japanese
macaques were observed in a room for an average of
44 min, and incidental sleeping situations were monitored
twice. All seven participants showed spontaneous smiles at
least once during the observation. They showed 8.29
spontaneous smiles in average (SD = 10.89; 58 smiles in
total), all found in the state of REM sleep. Thirty-nine of
the 58 smiles were produced on the left side of the mouth.
These characteristics were similar to those of spontaneous
smiles in human infants. This is the first evidence that
macaques as well as hominoids show a considerable
number of spontaneous smiles. These phenomena may
facilitate the development of the zygomaticus major mus-
cle, which is implicated in smiling-like facial expressions.

Introduction
Although smiles and laughs have been a topic of interest
since the time of Aristotle, Darwin (1872) was the first
researcher who shed light on the phylogeny of smiles and
other emotions. In developing his theory of evolution, he
recognized and demonstrated emotions in other species.
Although many researchers have revealed that great apes
and macaques show smiling-like expressions (van Hooff
1972), it is not clear how the smiles in humans and other
primates are the same or different.
Humans begin to show smiling-like displays from the
fetal period (Kawakami and Yanaihara 2012). Neonates
also show smiles during irregular sleep, drowsiness, and
alert inactivity, with no known external or internal causes
(Wolff 1959, 1963). These smiles are called spontaneous
(neonatal) smiles. Wolff (1959) defined them as a ‘‘slow,
gentle, sideward, and upward pull of the mouth, without
rhythmical mouthing movements or contraction of other
facial muscles’’ (p. 115). It should be noted that these
researchers do not focus on the emotional aspects of these
smiles, but rather on the smiling-like facial configuration.
Shimada (1969) observed that infants do not show spon-
taneous smiles in unpleasant conditions, for example, after
crying, but in many circumstances, it is difficult to specify
the emotional states during spontaneous smiles. Never-
theless, spontaneous smiles are the first topic in discussions
of the development of smiling in many books on devel-
opmental psychology (e.g., Cole and Cole 1989; Messinger
2008, 2009). Preterm neonates tend to show more sponta-
neous smiles than full-term neonates (Emde et al. 1971). In

 a series of longitudinal and cross-sectional observations,
Spitz et al. (1970) found that spontaneous smiles decrease
gradually by the sixth week after birth, and social smiles
increase during the same period of time. Social smiles are
so-called usual smiles, which express feelings of happiness
to other people. Ambrose (1961) also showed that social
smiles increase from around 2 months. These observations
led to the accepted developmental theory that spontaneous
smiles, as signs of immaturity, disappear at 2–3 months
and are replaced by social smiles (e.g., Kagan and Fox
2006; Sroufe and Waters 1976).
This developmental pathway appears to be simple and
reasonable. The actual course of development, however, is
not so straightforward. Kawakami et al. (2007) observed an
infant for 6 months and found that spontaneous smiles can
be seen in 6-month-olds. Kawakami et al. (2009) demon-
strated that even 1-year-olds show spontaneous smiles.
These data have made it difficult to understand the early
developmental stage of smiling. Dondi et al. (2010) con-
cluded, ‘‘unlike ‘social smiling’ that emerges later… and
has been analyzed in several early and more recent
empirical contributions, little is known about the signifi-
cance of neonatal smiles or their developmental relevance
for later smiling’’ (p. 116).
Spontaneous smiles were once considered a species-
specific phenomenon of humans, but Mizuno et al. (2006)
observed those smiles in chimpanzees. They observed three
newborn chimpanzees longitudinally for 4 months and
discovered that two subjects showed 60 spontaneous smiles
during irregular sleep. Mizuno et al. compared the fre-
quency of spontaneous smiles and social smiles and found
that the former was frequent in infants less than 7-weeks-
old and the latter was frequent in infants older than
8 weeks. Spontaneous smiles disappeared during the sec-
ond month in chimpanzees, and social smiles took their
place. There is no evidence that spontaneous smiles were
‘‘replaced’’ by social smiles.
Social smiles in primates are called play faces or relaxed
open-mouth displays (ROM). ROM features ‘‘a rather
widely opened mouth, and lips that remain covering all or
the greater part of the teeth’’ (van Hooff 1972, p. 217). In
geladas, play face features ‘‘mouth opened with only the
lower teeth exposed’’ and full play face features ‘‘lower/
upper teeth and gums exposed via the actively retraction of
the upper lip’’ (Palagi and Mancini 2011). These displays
are typically observed in social play. The silent bared-teeth
display (SBT or grimace) is another display which in
configuration resembles human smiles. SBT is character-
ized by ‘‘fully retracted mouth-corners and lips, so that an
appreciable part of the gums is bared; closed or only
slightly opened mouth; absence of vocalization’’ (van
Hooff 1972, pp. 212–213). Although there are similarities
in the morphological configurations of SBT and smiles in
humans, SBT expresses submission, not enjoyment. In the
phylogenetic model of smiling and laughter proposed by
van Hooff, ROM is linked to more hedonic laughter, and
SBT is related to smiling, a display of non-hostility or
friendliness. This widely accepted model assumes two
pathways of evolution in smiling and laughter (but see
Davila-Ross et al. 2015 for alternate thesis on the evolu-
tionary origin of human laugh faces).
Chimpanzees use ROM and SBT in daily life, as
described in numerous studies (e.g., Matsusaka 2004;
Preuschoft 2000; Waller and Dunbar 2005). Such displays
have also been found in other primates. Preuschoft and van
Hooff (1995) investigated ROM, SBT, and other facial
expressions in 16 species of macaques. Japanese macaques
(Macaca fuscata) were found to show both ROM and SBT.
Masataka and Fujii (1980) reported that caged Japanese
macaques showed SBT when submissive males were
threatened by dominant males. There is a general lack of
data on ROM in Japanese macaques [Shimada (2014),
personal communication]. We observed that wild Japanese
macaques and their subspecies, Yaku macaques (Macaca
fuscata yakui) frequently showed ROM and SBT (Kawa-
kami, unpublished data). Infant and adolescent Japanese
macaques showed many examples of ROM when they were
engaged in social play (Fig. 1a) and SBT when they
encountered conflicts (Fig. 1b).
Species in which the existence of spontaneous smiles
has been confirmed also show laughter (ROM) and smiling
(SBT). We previously reported a few cases of spontaneous
smiles in Japanese macaques (Kawakami 2009; Kawakami
et al. 2003). In the present study, we report more intensive
observations that have provided data for more detailed
analysis. The purpose of this report is to explore the
properties of spontaneous smiles in Japanese macaques and
to clarify the aspects of spontaneous smiles that are the
same and different among humans, chimpanzees, and
Japanese macaques.
Methods
Participants
Seven newborn Japanese macaques, born and bred in the
Primate Research Institute (PRI) of Kyoto University were
observed twice. They were reared by their own mothers
and lived together in individual stainless steel cages
(0.87 m W 9 0.8 m D 9 0.87 m H). Average age in days
was 10.64 (SD = 5.40), and average weight at the time of
observation was 531.71 g (SD = 94.98). Participants were
assigned an ID letter by ascending order of their age at the
first observation (A–G), and the number of the observation
(1 or 2) was added to the ID. For example, A2 represented

123
 the second observation of the participant who was youngest
in the first observation. Table 1 shows basic data for the
participants. There were only two male neonates, so sex
differences were not examined. The data reported in this
manuscript were collected from April 2000 to March 2010.
Procedure
The observations were made during sleeping time inci-
dental to other research on the calming effect of stimuli
presentation on infant macaques (cf. Kawakami et al.
2002). Each participant was individually brought to a
treatment room at PRI after anesthetizing the mother to
shut out the effect of other monkeys and to keep the same
experimental conditions for that research. There were two
to four observers including a veterinarian in the room.
Observations were conducted on a table, and participants
stayed on it supported by an observer. The observers were
careful not to present visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli that
may have induced non-spontaneous smiling responses
(Wolff 1963). One observer recorded the neonate’s face by
means of a digital camera recorder (SONY, DCR-PC110)
and a tripod en face during sleep. This procedure took
30–75 min in total. Participants were returned to their
cages immediately as possible, and a veterinarian con-
firmed that their mothers hold them as usual.

 Definition of arousal states
The arousal states were divided into three categories: non-
REM sleep, REM sleep, and waking (Wolff 1959; Mizuno
et al. 2006). Sleeping was defined as the state in which eyes
were more than half closed and gross body movements
were absent. During the sleeping period, eye movement
and respiratory patterns were carefully checked. If irregular
respiration and/or eye movement was observed, that period
was classified as REM sleep.
Definition of spontaneous smiles
The criteria for identifying spontaneous smiles in human
infants (e.g., Kawakami et al. 2008, 2009) were adapted for
macaques: (1) involving the raising of lip corners (Ekman
et al. 2002); (2) occurring during sleep; (3) occurring with
no known internal or external causes (Wolff 1963); (4)
continuing for more than 0.25 s. Internal causes (urination
and evacuation) and external causes (visual, auditory, and
tactile stimuli) can elicit smiling responses (Wolff 1963).
The criterion of the minimum duration of a spontaneous
smile was modified from human studies (1 s), because
many spontaneous smiles in Japanese macaques are shorter
than this, and the present study adopted Gunderson and
Sackett’s observation that maturation of infant macaques is
four times faster than that of human infants (Gunderson
and Sackett 1984). This criterion was established to
exclude very subtle and unrelated movements of the lip
corners.
ELAN Linguistic Annotator Version 4.1.0 (Max Planck
Institute of Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, the Netherlands)
was used to play back the images. The onset and offset of
smiles were determined as follows. When a smile was
observed, the video was rewound sequentially to the onset
frame (immediately prior to which there were no facial
movements). From the onset, the video was forwarded
sequentially to the offset (immediately following which
there were no facial movements). Smile peak refers to the
moment at which the corner of the lip was maximally
raised.
Laterality of smiles was designated as left-sided (LS),
right-sided (RS), or bilateral (BS). LS and RS were also
combined into unilateral smiles (US). During a smile, if the
part of the lip that was raised shifted (e.g., from left to
right), the final form was recorded.
Coding
For each participant, the total amount of time in each
arousal state was calculated. The measures for spontaneous
smiling included frequency, duration, interval between
onset and peak, laterality, and arousal state.
One of two coders identified smiles from the video.
Another coder independently judged 20 % of the smiles,
which were randomly selected from all the smiling scenes,
with 100 % intercoder agreement. Additionally, two coders
independently identified onset timing in seconds from
randomly selected un-edited videos from two observations
(74.43 min; 12 % of total observation time). The inter-
coder agreement from un-edited video was also sufficiently
high (Cohen’s j = 0.86). The event durations recorded by
the
two
coders
were
strongly
correlated,
r = 0.99
(p \ 0.001). Both coders had experience coding smiles of
human infants in previous studies (e.g., Kawakami et al.
2008, 2009).
Data analysis
Correlations of smiling outcomes with age and with weight
of participants were conducted. IBM SPSS Statistics Ver-
sion 20 (IBM Corporation) was used for analyses of gen-
eral linear mixed model and generalized linear mixed
model.
Results
Arousal states
The total observation time was 616.64 min, and the average
was 44.05 min (SD = 13.88; Table 1) per participant.
Participants were awake for approximately 85 % of the
observation time. Although the amount of sleeping time
was limited in comparison with waking, they slept for
93.27 min
(REM
sleep:
84.77 min;
non-REM
sleep:
8.50 min) in total, almost 91 % of which was REM sleep.
The percentage of REM sleep in this study was much higher
than human neonates (50 % in de Weerd and van den
Bossche 2003) and chimpanzee neonates (33 % in Mizuno
et al. 2006). Those data were obtained from naturalistic
observations without any interventions, while in this study
saliva sampling and blood sampling were performed for the
parallel research (Kawakami et al. 2002). Those interven-
tions might affect the arousal states in this study.
Spontaneous smiling
Participants showed 8.29 spontaneous smiles in average
(SD = 10.89; 58 spontaneous smiles in total) during the
observation time (Table 1). Participants who did not show
smiles (i.e., B2, D2, F1, and G2) were excluded from
subsequent analyses, except for the analyses of arousal
state.

found in the state of REM sleep. The youngest individual
who showed the smile was 4 days old and the oldest was
18 days old. These data do not mean that spontaneous
smiles in Japanese macaques can be observed in this period
of their development specifically, because these were not
exhaustive observations, but incidental ones. There were
no correlation between age/weight and frequency of smiles.
The average duration of spontaneous smiles in newborn
Japanese macaques was 0.92 s (SD = 0.64). The longest

 smile was 3.90 s, which was shown by a 7-day-old neonate
(C1). The shortest smiles were 0.43 s, which were shown
by 11-day-old (C2) and 13-day-old (A2) neonates. Sixteen
smiles lasted more than 1 s. The average duration of those
16 smiles was 1.70 s (SD = 0.71). There were no corre-
lations between age/weight and duration of smiles.
The intervals between the onset and the peak of the
smiles were measured to compare humans and Japanese
macaques. The data of group A in Kawakami et al. (2006)
was used for the analysis of human neonates (n = 10, age:
M = 4.80,
SD = 1.69;
birth
weight:
M = 2914.80 g,
SD = 424.70). Human neonates showed 24 spontaneous
smiles in the observation. The average intervals between
onset and peak were 0.66 s (SD = 0.25) for each human
neonate and 0.20 s (SD = 0.37) for each newborn Japa-
nese macaque (see Fig. 3). A general linear mixed model
demonstrated that spontaneous smiles of newborn Japanese
macaques reached their maximum appearance significantly
more quickly than those of human neonates [F (1,

p = 0.002,
humans:
estimated
marginal
mean = 0.66, 95 % CI (0.51 0.81); macaques: estimated
marginal mean = 0.23, 95 % CI (0.04 0.42)].
Mizuno et al. (2006) observed three infant chimpanzees
for 4 months (921 h in total). The infants spent 33 % of
this
time
in
REM
sleep,
or
approximately
304 h
(18,236 min). Mizuno et al. observed 60 spontaneous
smiles. Japanese macaques showed 41.05 smiles/h in REM
sleep, while chimpanzees showed 0.20 smiles/h in REM
sleep. A t test revealed that Japanese macaques showed
more spontaneous smiles than chimpanzees in the respec-
tive observation periods [t (6) = 3.195, p = 0.019].
Asymmetry in smile expression
Figure 4 displays the average frequency of smiles for each
laterality (LS, RS, and BS). A generalized linear mixed
model demonstrated that unilateral smiles (US) were sig-
nificantly frequent than BS (z = 2.84, p = 0.004).
Discussion
Spontaneous smiles are facial movements, which are
characterized by lip corner raises that occur during irreg-
ular sleep or drowsiness without known external or internal
causes. This study revealed that all seven newborn Japa-
nese macaques showed spontaneous smiles at least once
during the observation period (58 spontaneous smiles in
total). This indicates that spontaneous smiles in Japanese
macaques are not rare cases. Japanese macaques are
therefore the third species in which the existence of
spontaneous smiles has been confirmed. All of these spe-
cies—humans, chimpanzees, and Japanese macaques—
exhibit social smiles (SBT) and social laughs (ROM). It
should be noted that these ‘‘social smiles’’ and ‘‘social
laughs’’ are based on morphology, not necessarily emotion.
Spontaneous smiles involve the movement of the lip corner
puller (i.e., zygomaticus major). Movement of the same
muscle produces smiles in humans and ROM and SBT in
chimpanzees and macaques (Parr et al. 2010), though the
lip corner puller is included 19 % of ROM in adult chim-
panzees (Davila-Ross et al. 2015). The function of spon-
taneous smiles is still not clear, but it can be speculated that

 spontaneous smiles facilitate the development of the
zygomaticus major muscle, enabling these species to pro-
duce smiles, laughs, ROM, and SBT. Spontaneous smiles
may, therefore, play an important role in emotional
development as the origin of positive facial expressions. To
examine the validity of this presumption, it is necessary to
observe whether other species that do not show SBT and/or
ROM produce spontaneous smiles and examine the corre-
lation between the frequency of spontaneous smiles and
that of SBT and/or ROM. The important result of the
present study is that not only hominoids, but also maca-
ques, show spontaneous smiles.
Some researchers have argued that infants’ spontaneous
smiles exist to make parents feel that their children are
adorable and to enhance parent–child communication
(Takayanagi 2008). Povinelli et al. (2005) assume that
social smiles have the same function. Spontaneous smiles
may facilitate caregiving behavior of parents, but this could
not be the principal reason for the existence of these smiles.
The occurrence of spontaneous smiles in chimpanzees,
Japanese macaques, and human fetuses supports the view
that spontaneous smiles occur for the benefit of the fetuses,
neonates, and infants themselves, and not for other people
who happen to see the smiles. First, the configuration of
spontaneous smiles does not express hedonic feelings in
chimpanzees and Japanese macaques. Their configuration
differs from that of ROM in two points: (1) ROM almost
always emerges on both sides of the hemiface, but there are
more unilateral spontaneous smiles; (2) typical ROM
includes ‘‘lips part’’ (AU25 in Ekman et al. 2002; Parr et al.
2007), but some spontaneous smiles do not. If chimpanzees
and Japanese macaques see their infants’ spontaneous
smiles, they may not recognize them as smiles. Second, as
Kawakami and Yanaihara (2012) pointed out, a special
apparatus (i.e., four-dimensional ultrasonography), which
has only been recently invented, is required to see fetal
smiles.
The present observations revealed some similarities and
differences in the spontaneous smiles of humans, chim-
panzees, and Japanese macaques. Similar characteristics
included laterality and the arousal state and age at which
they showed the smiles. The difference was the interval
between the onset and the peak of the smiles.
The arousal states in which humans, chimpanzees, and
Japanese macaques showed spontaneous smiles were
exactly the same: All showed spontaneous smiles only in
the state of REM sleep (humans: Wolff 1959; chim-
panzees: Mizuno et al. 2006). In this state, brain activity
still occurs, so humans have dreams. It is possible that
dreams affect the occurrence of these smiles, especially for
1-year-old human infants. It is, however, difficult for us to
determine whether or not chimpanzees and Japanese
macaques have dreams, much less the content of their
dreams. Nevertheless, some mechanisms of REM sleep
must relate to the occurrence of spontaneous smiles,
although they remain unclear.
Japanese macaques showed spontaneous smiles from the
age of 4 days. Humans show them from the fetal period
(Kawakami and Yanaihara 2012) and from 1 to 7 days
after birth (Wolff 1959; Kawakami et al. 2006), and
chimpanzees also from 1 to 7 days of age (Mizuno et al.
2006). There is no data on the fetal period of chimpanzees
and Japanese macaques, but all three species show spon-
taneous smiles immediately after birth. All of the partici-
pants showed spontaneous smiles at least once during
observation. These indicate that spontaneous smiles are
innately programmed behavior.
The laterality of spontaneous smiles in newborn Japa-
nese macaques was similar to that of human neonates;
although there is an asymmetrical tendency that the left
side of the face is involved in the production of emotional
responses in chimpanzees (Ferna
´ndez-Carriba et al. 2002),
there are no data on the laterality of spontaneous smiles in
them. Participants in this study showed more unilateral
spontaneous smiles than bilateral ones, as do human neo-
nates (Kawakami et al. 2006). In humans, 80 % of spon-
taneous smiles are bilateral at 2 months of age, thus there is
a developmental change in laterality of spontaneous smiles
(Kawakami et al. 2007). Further investigation is necessary
to examine this in Japanese macaques.
The most obvious difference between spontaneous
smiles in humans and Japanese macaques was the interval
between the onset and the peak of the smiles. Spontaneous
smiles in Japanese macaques reached the peak quicker than
humans. This can be explained in two ways: allometric
timing constancy and anatomical differences. Allometric
timing constancy is a lawful timing relation between
movement patterns and body mass. Actions performed by
species smaller in body mass are much faster than the same
actions performed by larger species (Schmidt-Nielsen
1984; Steiner et al. 2001). Newborn Japanese macaques are
much smaller than human neonates; therefore, the timing
difference is reasonable. A difference between Japanese
macaques and humans in the anatomy of the zygomaticus
major muscle, which is associated with smiles, may also
contribute to the more rapid peaking of spontaneous smiles
in macaques. In Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), the
zygomaticus major muscle is interrupted by the depressor
anguli oris muscle unlike humans, which is related to the
opposite facial movement (i.e., lip corner depressor; Bur-
rows et al. 2009; Parr et al. 2010). This anatomical feature
of Rhesus macaques would be shared by Japanese maca-
ques. Julle-Danie
`re et al. (2015) reported that an anatom-
ically based facial action coding system used with rhesus
macaques (Parr et al. 2010) could be used with Barbary
macaques (Macaca sylvanus), which are phylogenetically
Primates
123
 farther from Rhesus macaques than Japanese macaques
(Hayasaka et al. 1996; Li et al. 2009). A shorter zygo-
maticus major would make the size of smiling actions
smaller. If allometric timing constancy and anatomical
difference are indeed related to the duration of spontaneous
smiles, this should be reflected in other facial expressions.
Japanese macaques showed 58 spontaneous smiles in
1.41 h of REM sleep (n = 7). Human full-term neonates
showed 24 smiles in 10 h of observation (n = 10)
(Kawakami et al. 2006), and infant chimpanzees showed
60 smiles in 304 h of REM sleep (n = 3; Mizuno et al.
2006). The definitions of spontaneous smiles in these
studies are not completely identical. Japanese macaques
and human neonates were removed from their mothers or
caregivers
temporarily,
whereas
chimpanzees
were
observed via nighttime video cameras from a distance.
Although there are some differences in observational pro-
cedures, the frequency/time ratio of Japanese macaques is
obviously larger than that of the other two species. Emde
et al. (1971) indicated that preterm neonates showed more
spontaneous smiles than full-terms, so some researchers
believe that these smiles are a sign of immaturity. Is it
possible that the data of the present study demonstrate the
relative immaturity of newborn Japanese macaques? This
inference is contradicted in two ways. As mentioned above,
1-year-old human infants show spontaneous smiles. Thus,
spontaneous smiles alone cannot be evidence of immatu-
rity. In addition, newborn Japanese macaques are consid-
erably more precocious than human neonates in some
respects (immune system: Holsapple et al. 2003; foveal
development: Hendrickson 1992; postural and locomotor
behaviors: Takeshita et al. 2009).
The duration of spontaneous smiles in Japanese maca-
ques cannot be directly compared with data from human
studies, because the criteria of the minimum duration for
spontaneous smiles are different. There is no data on the
duration of spontaneous smiles in chimpanzees. In human
studies, some smiles exceeded 10 s. The maximum dura-
tion of smiles in this study was 3.90 s. Thus the duration of
spontaneous smiles in Japanese macaques may indeed be
shorter than that of humans. As mentioned above, this
could be accounted for by the allometric timing rule. In
addition, the zygomaticus major muscle in macaques is
split by the muscle associated with the opposite facial
action, lip corner depressor. This may make it difficult for
macaques to maintain the facial action of the lip corner
puller.
In the chimpanzee, spontaneous smiles could not be
observed after 2 months of age (Mizuno et al. 2006). By
contrast,
human
infants
continue
to
show
them
at
15 months (Kawakami et al. 2009). The oldest participant
who showed spontaneous smiles in this study was aged
0.5 month. This age will doubtless be exceeded if infant
Japanese macaques are observed exhaustively. It is still
unclear when spontaneous smiles in Japanese macaques
disappear. In addition, humans, chimpanzees, and maca-
ques have different life history and velocity of growth
(Blurton Jones et al. 1999; Lee et al. 1991). The chrono-
logical age of humans, chimpanzees, and macaques can not
be compared directly.
In summary, this study has provided evidence that
Japanese macaques display spontaneous smiles, which
have been previously been confirmed in hominoids.
Because Japanese macaques are somewhat distant from
hominoids in the phylogenetic tree, it may be possible that
many other primates also show spontaneous smiles. Further
observations are necessary to make clear which species
show spontaneous smiles and what function these smiles
serve.
