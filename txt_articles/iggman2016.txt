Association of Adipose Tissue Fatty Acids With Cardiovascular
and All-Cause Mortality in Elderly Men
David Iggman, MD, PhD; Johan Ärnlöv, MD, PhD; Tommy Cederholm, MD, PhD; Ulf Risérus, MMed, PhD
IMPORTANCE The major polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipose tissue objectively reflect
long-term dietary intake, and may provide more reliable information than would self-reported
intake. Whether adipose tissue fatty acids predict cardiovascular and all-cause mortality
needs investigation.
OBJECTIVE To investigate associations between adipose tissue fatty acids and cardiovascular
and overall mortality in a cohort of elderly men.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We hypothesized that polyunsaturated fatty acids
reflecting dietary intake, are inversely associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.
In the Swedish cohort study Uppsala Longitudinal Cohort of Adult Men, buttock fatty acid
composition was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography in 1992 to 1993 and 2008. The
study participants were followed during 11 311 person-years, between 1991 and 2011 (median
follow-up, 14.8 years). In this community-based study that took place from 1970 to 1973, all
men born in 1920 to 1924 in Uppsala, Sweden, were invited and 2322 (82%) were included
(at age 50 years). At the reinvestigation at age 71 years, 1221 (73%) of the 1681 invited men
participated. Adipose tissue biopsy specimens were taken in a subsample of 853 men. There
was no loss to follow-up.
EXPOSURES Adipose tissue proportions of 4 polyunsaturated fatty acids that were
considered to mainly reflect dietary intake (linoleic acid, 18:2n-6; α-linolenic acid, 18:3n-3;
eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3; and docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3) comprised primary
analyses, and all other available fatty acids were secondary analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular and all-cause
mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, performed in 2015.
RESULTS Among the 853 Swedish men, there were 605 deaths, of which 251 were
cardiovascular deaths. After adjusting for risk factors, none of the 4 primary fatty acids were
associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.92-1.05 for each standard deviation increase;
P � .27). Linoleic acid was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.82-0.98; P = .02) and directly associated with intake (P < .001). In secondary analyses,
palmitoleic acid, 16:1n-7 (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P = .02) was associated with higher
all-cause mortality, whereas heptadecanoic acid, 17:0, tended to be associated with lower
all-cause mortality (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-1.00; P = .05). Arachidonic:linoleic acid ratio was
associated with both cardiovascular (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; P = .04) and all-cause
(HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23; P = .005) mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adipose tissue linoleic acid was inversely associated with
all-cause mortality in elderly men, although not significantly with cardiovascular mortality.

ietary recommendations emphasize high intakes of
polyunsaturatedfattyacids(PUFAs)oversaturatedfatty
acids (SFAs), that is, less fat from animal sources and
morefromnontropicalvegetableoils,nuts,andfish.1Thescien-
tific evidence for these recommendations is based on both pro-
spective observational studies2 and a limited number of inter-
ventions with cardiovascular disease (CVD) end points.3 Also, a
largebodyofevidenceexistsregardingtheshort-termeffectsof

ing cholesterol-lowering effects of PUFAs compared with SFAs,
although the mechanisms are not entirely clear.5 In all, institu-
tionssuchastheFoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnited
Nations and the World Health Organization have until recently
regarded the evidence for the benefits of replacing SFAs with
PUFAs to fight CVD as convincing.6 However, some controversy
remains regarding the role of the predominant dietary PUFAs,
linoleicacid(LA)(18:2n-6),whichhasbeensuspectedtoincrease
inflammation through endogenous conversion to arachidonic
acid (20:4n-6), a precursor of both pro-inflammatory and anti-
inflammatory eicosanoids. Also, LA increased cardiovascular
morbidityandall-causemortalityathighintakesofastudymar-
garineinreanalysesoftheSydneyDietHeartStudy.7Todate,no
human trials, however, have demonstrated that moderate
amountsofdietaryLAincreasemarkersofinflammation.8-10 In
contrast,arecentsystematicreview11ofprospectiveobservational

manner.However,anothermeta-analysis12reportednoassocia-

Becausethereareonlyfewrandomizedclinicaltrialsondi-

ment errors and underreporting of dietary intake of fats lower

objective markers of dietary intake instead, that is, adipose tis-
suecomposition,whichforcertainfattyacidsreflectslong-term
dietary intake reasonably well.13 Because very few prospective
studies have examined the association between adipose tissue
fattyacidsandmortalityoutcomes,suchstudiesarehighlywar-
ranted.Also,toourknowledge,nosuchstudiesinelderlypopu-
lations, in whom mortality is high, have been published. Previ-
ous studies in the present cohort have used serum cholesterol
esters as fatty acid biomarkers and have found inverse associa-
tions between LA and cardiovascular and total mortality in 50-
year-old men,14 but no such data exist on adipose tissue PUFA
orinelderlySwedishmen.Wehypothesizedthatadiposetissue

tality in a population-based cohort of elderly Swedish men.
Methods
Study Population
The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) is a co-
hort study conducted in Uppsala, Sweden. Only men were in-
cluded because the study’
s main purpose was to investigate
causes of CVD in middle-aged men, in whom cardiovascular
mortality was high in the 1970s. The present study originated
from ULSAM’
s third examination in 1991 to 1995, when par-
ticipants were approximately 71 years old. The study was ap-
proved by the Interdisciplinary Collaboration Team on Up-
psala Longitudinal Studies at the Section of Geriatrics at
Uppsala University and by the Ethics Committee of Uppsala
University. Participants provided written informed consent;
they were not compensated for taking part in the study. Up to
this point, 422 participants had died and 219 moved out of the
region. Of the 1681 invited men, 1221 chose to participate at
this point. At the time of the analysis in 2015, complete data
from death registries through December 31, 2011, were avail-
able. See eFigures 1 and 2, and eTables 1 and 2 in the online
Supplement for additional information.
Baseline Measurements
Participants’medical history, weight, height, body mass index
(BMI), and waist circumference were obtained at the baseline
visitatage71years,in1991to1995.Bloodpressurewasmeasured
in the supine position. Questions about current smoking status
(smokervsnonsmoker)andeducationlevel(elementaryschool,
secondary school, or university studies) were asked by a study
nurse.Biochemicalanalyseswereperformedusingroutinelabo-
ratory analyses, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-
C)levelwascalculatedbytheFriedewaldformula.Dyslipidemia
was defined as taking lipid-lowering medication or having an
LDL-C level greater than 5 mg/dL or high-density cholesterol
(HDL-C)levellessthan38.6mg/dL(toconvertLDL-CandHDL-C
tomillimolesperliter,multiplyby0.0259).Physicalactivitywas
assessed by an optically readable questionnaire, graded 1 (sed-
entary) to 4 (hard physical training). Dietary fat and alcohol in-
takes were determined from a 7-day optically readable food di-
ary,andfattyacidsweregivenasweightpercentage(wt%)oftotal
fatintake.AdequatereportersweredeterminedbytheGoldberg
cutoff,asmodifiedbyBlack15foracceptablereportedenergyin-
take:basal metabolic rate (BMR) at the individual level, that is,
takingintoaccountthenumberofdaysreported(7)andwithin-
subject variations in energy intake (23%), BMR (8%), and varia-
tion in physical activity (15%). Physical activity levels were
estimated as 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 times BMR, for each reported
activitygrade.TheBMRwasdeterminedbytheHarris-Benedict
equation.16
Key Points
Question Are intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (as reflected
in adipose tissue) associated with cardiovascular and all-cause
mortality?
Findings In a Swedish community-based cohort study of 853
men, 71 years old, adipose tissue linoleic acid was associated with
lower all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality over a
15-year follow-up.
Meaning Omega-6 intake was associated with lower risk of death
in elderly men.

Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality
Information on dates and causes of death were collected from
the Swedish Cause of Death registry for all participants every
calendaryear.InternationalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRe-
vision(ICD-9),andInternationalStatisticalClassificationofDis-
eases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10),
codes390to459andI00to99wereused,respectively,forclas-
sification of deaths as cardiovascular mortality.
Adipose Tissue and Serum Cholesterol Ester Analyses
In the first 853 men examined (1991-1995), adipose tissue bi-
opsyspecimensweretakenfromtheouterquadrantofthebut-
tocks with a needle coupled to a vacuum tube. The sample was
collected in the connector between the needle and the tube,
and stored at −70°C until analysis. Prior to the analysis, the
sample was weighed and homogenized. Fatty acid composi-
tion was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography according to
Boberg et al,17 using a Hewlett Packard gas-liquid chromato-
graph system, 7671A autosampler, 3392A integrator, and 25-m
Quadrex Fused Silica capillary column OV-351, with helium as
the carrier gas. The amounts of fatty acids are given as rela-
tive percentages of the sum of all fatty acids (as wt%).18 The
fattyacidswereanalyzedin2batches;onthefirstoccasion(ap-
proximately 1992-1993; n = 318), the fatty acids 16:0, 16:1n-7,
18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 18:3n-6, 20:3n-6, 20:4n-6, 20:
5n-3, 22:4n-6, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3 were included. Fatty acid
composition of serum cholesterol esters was analyzed using
similar methods in a subsample of 611 men. In 2008, that is,
15 to 16 years later, the remaining 535 adipose tissue samples
were analyzed in the same laboratory using an Agilent Tech-
nologies system consisting of a model 6890N gas-liquid chro-
matograph, 7683 autosampler, and an Agilent ChemStation;
this time, the minor fatty acids 12:0, 14:0, 15:0, and 17:0 were
also included, and thus slightly different methods were used,
that is, higher temperature and a 30-m glass capillary column
coatedwithThermoTR-FAME(ThermoElectronCorp).18Steao-
ryl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity in adipose tissue was esti-
mated as product-to-precursor ratios of individual fatty acids
(ie, 16:1n-7/16:0 and 18:1n-9/18:0). Conversion from 18:2n-6 to
20:4n-6 was estimated as the ratio 20:4n-6/18:2n-6.
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HR for
each fatty acid, standardized at a 1 SD increase. Results are pre-
sented for 2 separate models, 1 crude model adjusting for age
and analysis occasion (0 of 1), and a second model adjusting
also for CVD risk factors, including smoking (data were avail-
able for 844 men), BMI (848 men), alcohol intake (789 men),
physicalactivity(791men),diabetesprevalence(852men),sys-
tolic blood pressure (851 men), dyslipidemia (853 men), and
hypertension treatment (849 men). These 2 models were se-
lected after drawing causal diagrams for the most important
associations and investigator discussions. Data are given as the
mean (SD) for all variables. Normality of variables was deter-
mined by the Shapiro-Wilk test and visual examinations of his-
tograms. Adipose tissue LA, ALA, EPA, DHA, 18:3n-6, 20:
3n-6, 22:4n-6, 12:0, and alcohol intake were considered
nonnormally distributed and thus natural log-transformed be-
fore analyses. Ten iterations of multiple imputation of miss-
ing data on covariates were performed (STATA command ice),
without any imputation of data on exposure variables. Pair-
wise correlations were analyzed as Pearson r, granted at least
1 variable was approximately normally distributed. Signifi-
cantassociationsinbothmodelsamongprimaryanalyseswere
further investigated using restricted cubic splines (without a
set reference point; STATA command uvrs). P < .05 was
considered statistically significant. All analyses were per-
formed with STATA statistical software (versions 11.0 and 13.0;
StataCorp).
Results
Baseline characteristics and adipose tissue fatty acid compo-
sition at age 71 years are presented in Table 1. Most adipose tis-
sue fatty acids were correlated with dietary record data (as per-
centage of fat intake) (Figure 1A); r = 0.37 for LA, r = 0.16 for
ALA, r = 0.25 for EPA, and r = 0.32 for DHA; r = 0.20 for 16:0,

acids in adipose tissue and serum cholesterol esters were also
strongly (P < .001) correlated in these 2 compartments, par-
ticularly LA (r = 0.61) (Figure 1C). Both 16:0 and 16:1n-7 were
associated with reported SFA intakes and negatively associ-
ated with carbohydrate intakes (Figure 1D). No association was
found between self-reported dietary LA intake and the pro-
portions of arachidonic acid (AA) in adipose tissue (data not
shown).
The 853 participants were followed for a median of 14.8
years (range,0.1-20.2 years; 11 311 total person-years). There
were 605 deaths, and 251 of these were cardiovascular deaths.
After adjustment for CVD risk factors, there were no signifi-
cant associations with cardiovascular mortality (Table 2). In
the minimally adjusted model, stearic acid (18:0) was associ-
atedwithdecreasedcardiovascularmortality,whereasthevery
long chain n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and 22:4n-6
were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.
For all-cause mortality, LA was associated with de-
creased mortality in both models (Table 3). In the risk factor–
adjusted model, palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) was associated with
increased mortality, whereas heptadecanoic acid (17:0) was in-
versely associated with mortality (secondary analyses). Stearic
acid (18:0), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), and 22:4n-6 were as-
sociated with decreased mortality in the age-adjusted model,
but these associations disappeared after adjusting for CVD risk
factors (Table 3). The association with mortality for AA was not
explained by any single covariate (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). The number of deaths at different levels of LA is given
in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
To test that the association with LA and mortality was in-
dependent of socioeconomic status, length of education was
also added as a covariate to the CVD risk factor model, and new
multiple imputations were performed, including education.
However, the results were not affected; for CVD mortality, haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.80-1.06;
P = .27) both including and excluding education. For all-
cause mortality, HRs were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-0.99) in both
models (P = .02 excluding education, and P = .03 including
education).
In a restricted cubic spline analysis, the inverse associa-
tion between LA and mortality demonstrated a clear associa-
tion for higher mortality at the lowest LA levels, with a ten-
dencytowardstilllowerHRalsoatthehighestlevels(Figure2).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study of elderly men with 15 years
of follow-up and 605 deaths, adipose tissue LA, the major di-
etary n-6 PUFA, was associated with lower all-cause mortal-
ity, with a tendency toward lower CVD mortality. Considering
that LA is an essential fatty acid and one of the best biomark-
ers for n-6 PUFA intake,13 the results may suggest a beneficial
role of PUFA-rich vegetable oils. Such a possibility is further
supported by a current strong association between LA intake
and adipose tissue LA percentage. To our knowledge, this is
the largest study presenting such data. In secondary analy-
ses, the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) palmitoleic (16:
1n-7) was associated with increased mortality, whereas hep-
tadecanoicacid(17:0)wasassociatedwithdecreasedmortality.
Few similar prospective studies have investigated asso-
ciationsbetweenadiposetissueandCVD,andwearenotaware
of any that have investigated cardiovascular or all-cause mor-
tality. In the Scottish Heart Health Extended Cohort Study,

upper arm adipose tissue fatty acids were sampled in 3944
middle-aged men and women who were followed for a me-
dian of 19.5 years.19 The n-3 PUFA 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were
associated with lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI), a find-
ing that we could not observe with regard to cardiovascular
mortality. The effects of dietary n-3 PUFA may differ in middle-
aged vs elderly populations. For LA, there was a trend for de-
creased risk of MI, but this was not significant after adjusting
for various lifestyle variables; all results were also adjusted for
total and HDL-C levels in the Scottish study. We instead chose
to adjust only for the categorical factor dyslipidemia, to cap-
ture potential confounding by medical treatment, since pro-
tective effects of LA and ALA may be mediated by LDL-C level
lowering. Although LA was associated with decreased all-
cause mortality, we could not, however, clearly confirm any
potentially protective effects against CVD risk for any PUFA.
This may have been due to the relatively few CVD events, as
there was a tendency for lower CVD mortality for LA. In the
Scottish study, but not ours, both palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) and
oleic acid (18:1n-9) (ie, MUFA) were associated with in-
creased risk of MI. Palmitoleic acid was, however, congru-
ently associated with higher all-cause mortality in the pre-
sent study. A higher mortality risk at higher adipose tissue
proportions of MUFA might reflect increased SCD-1 activity,
since this enzyme produces MUFA from SFAs, and palmi-
toleic acid is uncommon in the diet. Such reasoning is sup-
ported by the current significant association between in-
creasedadiposetissueSCD-1activityandmortality,inlinewith
previous findings using hepatic SCD-1 activity indices in this
population.14 Stearic acid (18:0) tended to be associated with
decreasedCVDrisk,inlinewithourstudy.This,however,prob-
ably reflects factors other than diet (eg, elongation from pal-
mitic acid), since we found no correlation between adipose tis-
sue 18:0 and dietary records. Apart from other SFAs, stearic
acid does not increase LDL-C level.20 In secondary analyses
we also observed an inverse association between the milk fat
biomarker, 17:0, and all-cause mortality. This may suggest a
beneficial role of milk fat intake or of dairy components (eg,
calcium,magnesium,vitaminD).Aninverselinkbetweendairy
intake and all-cause mortality has, however, not been shown
in previous prospective cohort studies,21 and supportive evi-
dence from randomized clinical trials is lacking. Until such evi-
denceormechanismsareavailable,residualconfoundingmust
beconsidered.Becauseadiposetissuepalmiticacidisthemain
product of de novo lipogenesis in positive energy balance, we
investigated whether palmitic acid was associated with re-
ported dietary intakes of SFAs and carbohydrate. There were
positive correlations with SFAs and 16:0 intakes and an in-
verse correlation with carbohydrate intake, in line with the no-
tion that in populations with a relatively high fat intake, most
adipose tissue palmitic acid is probably derived from SFA in-
take rather than from carbohydrates.22 The association be-
tween 16:1n-7 and SFA intake accord with controlled interven-
tional data showing increased 16:1n-7 in serum lipids in
response to increased SFA intake and decreasing MUFA and
PUFA intake.23
The association between adipose tissue AA and in-
creased risk of CVD mortality, in the age-adjusted models, is
not consistent with serum AA of this cohort but may reflect
altered desaturation and elongation of LA,14 because genetic
metabolic and factors may mainly determine AA tissue levels
rather than its dietary intake.24,25 Interestingly, a higher AA:LA

ratio, potentially reflecting higher conversion rate from LA to
AA, was associated with higher risk of both CVD and all-
cause mortality. Whether this finding mainly reflects a ge-
netic influence on this ratio remains to be investigated, but re-
cently a variant in the FADS1 gene was suggested to alter the
LAtoAAconversionrateinerythrocytemembraneandplasma
phospholipids in elderly Japanese patients.26
Onecase-cohortstudyofmiddle-agedDanishmenreported

therewere1012casesofACS.Bothindividualverylongchainn-3

pared with 1630 healthy controls from the cohort. This was ob-
servedinmenbutnotwomen,andmostcases(86%)werenon-
fatal,whichmayexplaintheinconsistencywiththepresentstudy,
in which we found no associations between n-3 PUFA and car-
diovascularmortality.Astudyof2134caseswithMIreportedan
increased risk associated with adipose tissue arachidonic acid
(associationswithotherfattyacidswerenotreported),whichwas
also not believed to be reflective of dietary intake, because adi-
posetissuearachidonicacidwasnotassociatedwithdietaryara-
chidonicacidorLA.28AsimilartendencyforincreasedCVDmor-
talitywasobservedinthepresentstudyforminorverylongchain

been due to insufficient statistical power.
There are also several retrospective studies on adipose tis-
sue fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes29-48 or meta-
bolicsyndrome,49withdivergentresults.Suchbiomarkerstud-
ies do not rely on a patient’
s memory, but incident CVD may
result in an individual’
s changed dietary habits, which may in-
troducebiasthroughreversecausation.Wewillthereforeavoid
discussing retrospective studies in further detail.
The remaining causes of deaths were unknown, but it is
possible that dietary LA may be inversely linked to cancer mor-
tality. Mechanisms for such associations are, however, un-
known, and more studies are required to confirm the poten-
tialofLAinpromotinglongevityinelderlypopulations.Ofnote
is that during the early 1990s, common margarines con-
tained both LA and trans fatty acids, thus possibly a negative
confounding factor in these associations. Indeed, unpub-
lished observations of a subsample of 102 men of the present
cohort demonstrated direct associations between adipose tis-
sue LA and trans fatty acids derived from partially hydroge-
nated vegetable oils (oral communication; Bengt Vessby, MD,
PhD; December 2014). Considering that we show novel data
that the relative levels of LA in adipose tissue is associated with
that of serum LA, it is noteworthy that our results accord with
those of a recent cohort study50 of 60-year-olds, showing in-
verse relations between serum cholesterol esters and all-
cause mortality. In that study also, LA showed inverse but non-
significant associations with CVD events in adjusted models.
Of note, the associations between adipose tissue and re-
ported dietary intake were highly correlated for certain fatty
acids (eg, LA). The association was stronger in men who did
not underreport dietary intakes. These findings indicate that
adipose tissue seems to be a valid objective marker of PUFA
intake, especially LA that is present in higher proportions in
adipose tissue and has high measurement accuracy (coeffi-
cient of variation, 1%-2%) compared with other PUFA. Serum
cholesterol esters fatty acids were also correlated with intake
(except for 18:3n-3), but less strongly. This indicates that, when
possible to ascertain in cohort studies, adipose tissue may be
preferable to blood samples as biomarker for long-term di-
etary intake.
The strengths of the study were its population-based de-
sign with a high rate of participation and virtually no loss to
follow-up, owing to reliable registry data. The follow-up pe-
riod of 15 years was probably sufficient to determine the ef-
fects of baseline dietary factors. The study was unique in using
adipose tissue as an objective marker of fatty acid intake for
mortality outcomes and adds to the knowledge from previ-
ous studies in younger populations. Limitations include the
observational study design with potential residual confound-
ing, and it should therefore be noted that no causality can be
implied by our study findings. Furthermore, there were rela-
tively few cases with CVD deaths and thus limited power to
detect strong associations with fatty acids. Similarly, for some
minor SFAs (eg, 12:0 and 14:0) power was even lower owing
to detection problems of these SFAs in adipose tissue. For fatty
acids with low concentrations (eg, EPA), the measurement er-
ror was larger (CV was approximately 5%), which may have bi-
ased those results toward the null. Also, there were multiple
primary analyses performed, and we cannot completely ex-
clude the possibility that some associations are by chance. The
risk of CVD-related death may also rely more on dietary in-
takes earlier in life, which adipose tissue at age 71 years may
not adequately reflect. Also, the adipose tissue analyses were
performed at 2 occasions with the tissue in a freezer for a long
period of time in between and using slightly different meth-
ods. Including the analysis occasion as a categorical variable
in the regression analyses, however, changed the results only
slightly (toward stronger results). Furthermore, an interac-

Conclusions
We found no associations between fatty acid composition and
cardiovascular mortality for adipose tissue PUFAs in 71-year-
old men during 15 years of follow-up. However, adipose tis-
sue LA, correlated with dietary LA intake, was independently
associated with decreased all-cause mortality. Further stud-
ies should investigate the role of dietary PUFAs as well as adi-
pose tissue desaturation in longevity.
