CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing
provides a promising cure for HIV-1/AIDS; however, gene de-
livery efficiency in vivo remains an obstacle to overcome. Here,
we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of excising the
HIV-1 provirus in three different animal models using an all-
in-one adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver multi-
plex single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) plus Staphylococcus aureus
Cas9 (saCas9). The quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 vector outper-
formed the duplex vector in excising the integrated HIV-1
genome in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from HIV-1
Tg26 transgenic mice. Intravenously injected quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 excised HIV-1 proviral DNA and
significantly reduced viral RNA expression in several organs/
tissues of Tg26 mice. In EcoHIV acutely infected mice, intrave-
nously injected quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 reduced
systemic EcoHIV infection, as determined by live biolumines-
cence imaging. Additionally, this quadruplex vector induced
efficient proviral excision, as determined by PCR genotyping
in the liver, lungs, brain, and spleen. Finally, in humanized
bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice with chronic HIV-1
infection, successful proviral excision was detected by PCR
genotyping in the spleen, lungs, heart, colon, and brain after
a single intravenous injection of quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9
AAV-DJ/8. In conclusion, in vivo excision of HIV-1 proviral
DNA by sgRNAs/saCas9 in solid tissues/organs can be achieved
via AAV delivery, a significant step toward human clinical
trials.
INTRODUCTION
The CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) is an RNA-guided endonu-
clease originally discovered as an integral mediator of bacterial adap-
tive immunity. The Cas9-mediated genome editing system generates
site-specific double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that remarkably
increase homologous recombination efficacy and thus render easy,
fast, and economical manipulation of the genome in various cells
and organs. In the past 4 years, Cas9 technology has been extensively
utilized in basic science and pre-clinical settings for the potential
treatment of genetic diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. The
majority of these applications are attributed to the successful develop-
ment of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (spCas9), a 1,368-amino acid
(aa) protein that recognizes a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of
NRG nucleotides to the 30 target site.1 However, several smaller
Cas9 proteins from other bacterial species have been garnering
more attention for their greater feasibility in viral gene therapy,
specifically from Streptococcus thermophiles, Neisseria meningitides,
and Staphylococcus aureus (saCas9). The efficiency and specificity
of saCas9 (1,053 aa) in mammalian cells was characterized recently.2
The smaller size renders adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated
gene delivery systems more feasible in clinical trials.3 The AAV-
saCas9 system has been successfully tested in gene knockout2,4,5
and knock-in6,7 studies in experimental animals.
Currently, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been widely
used to suppress active HIV-1 replication; however, a permanent
cure is still lacking due to the existence of latent reservoirs, in which
HIV proviral DNA integrates in the host genome. Upon cART cessa-
tion, the HIV viral load rebounds to cause a catastrophic resurgence
of HIV/AIDS. Thus, several promising and novel strategies are being
developed to achieve a permanent or “sterile” cure for HIV/AIDS.

 The versatile Cas9/single-guide RNA (sgRNA) technology is one
strategy employed to eradicate the integrated proviral DNA in
HIV-1 latent reservoirs and prevents HIV-1 (re)infection. For
example, the spCas9 system has been successfully used to disrupt
HIV-1 entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, along with several pro-
viral structural proteins.8–10 We reported that stable transfection of
cultured human cells with plasmids encoding spCas9 and HIV-1
sgRNAs targeting four different sites of the HIV-1 long terminal
repeat (LTR) could successfully excise HIV-1 proviral DNA.11
Pre-treatment of cells with spCas9/LTR sgRNAs renders them
resistant to new HIV-1 infection in vitro,11 which was also observed
by others.12–14 We further demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency
of HIV-1 excision by applying the spCas9/sgRNA system via lenti-
virus-mediated delivery to HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells
from human healthy subjects and patients with HIV-1.15 Finally,
we demonstrated that a combination of sgRNAs targeting LTRs
and the viral structural genes in the spCas9 system provides a more
efficient means of HIV-1 excision in cultured cells.16 Using high-
coverage whole-genome sequencing and cell-based functional assays,
we demonstrated the absence of off-target effects when the multiplex
sgRNAs/spCas9 system was used.11,15,16 Due to the limitations of
spCas9 for AAV gene delivery in the clinical setting, we adapted
the saCas9/sgRNA system in an all-in-one AAV vector for HIV exci-
sion in a recent report. We demonstrated the proof of concept that
AAV9-mediated saCas9/duplex sgRNAs can be used to excise the in-
tegrated HIV-1 genome in HIV-1 transgenic mice and rats.17 In this
study, we further tested the feasibility and efficiency of HIV-1 exci-
sion by saCas9/sgRNA-mediated genome editing in humanized
bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice inoculated with HIV-1 via
the vaginal mucosa or intraperitoneal (i.p.) transmission. The same
genome editing system was also introduced in conventional mice dur-
ing an acute infection of EcoHIV18,19 to demonstrate its ability to
block active HIV-1 replication.
RESULTS
The saCas9/sgRNA System Efficiently Excises HIV-1
Proviral DNA
To determine the excision efficiency of the saCas9 system, we selected
three sgRNAs targeting the HIV LTR (Figure 1A) using the optimal
PAM NNGRRN2 and we performed EcoHIV-enhanced firefly
luciferase (eLuc) reporter assays and direct PCR genotyping as we
described previously.16 We employed an sgRNA pairing approach
because it is more reliable for identifying successful excision of the
HIV-1 proviral genome by functional reporter assays and PCR geno-
typing.11,15,16,20 As shown in Figure 1B, all combinations between
the selected three LTR sgRNAs in the presence of saCas9 almost
completely eliminated EcoHIV-eLuc activity (by 95%–99%). Since
these identified seed (target) sequences were designed as NGGRRN
that exactly match the spCas9 PAM (NGG), we cloned them into
a lentiviral WG vector,16 in which spCas9-specific sgRNA sequence
differs from the sgRNA sequence for saCas9 (except the seed
sequence),2,21 and compared the HIV-1 excision efficiency between
saCas9/sgRNA and spCas9/sgRNA. Side-by-side transfection and
EcoHIV-eLuc reporter studies showed that the spCas9/sgRNA with
these three pairing methods was less effective at reducing luciferase
activity (Figure 1B) and excising EcoHIV DNA (Figure 1C). The
higher excision efficiency of the saCas9/sgRNA system may be attrib-
uted to the higher co-expression level of sgRNA and saCas9 in the
same cells because they are in a single vector. Additionally, the smaller
size of saCas9 allows higher gene delivery efficiency, and the intrinsic
nuclease activity of saCas9 may be more efficient at making DSBs
than spCas9.2,21 The different sgRNA sequences used between the
two different bacterial Cas9s may also contribute to saCas9’s better
cleaving efficiency.2,21
Combination of LTR sgRNAs with Gag or Pol sgRNA Induces
Potent Excision
Using the spCas9/sgRNA system, we demonstrated easier PCR geno-
typing and more efficient HIV-1 excision through the combination of
sgRNAs targeting the LTRs and the viral structural genes (e.g., Gag or
Pol).16 To test whether this is also applicable to the saCas9/sgRNA
system, we paired sgRNAs targeting Gag or Pol with one of the three
LTR sgRNAs. All combinations of LTR-1 or LTR-3 with Gag or
Pol sgRNAs induced a robust reduction of EcoHIV-eLuc activity in
HEK293T cells (Figure 1D). The pairing of LTR-2 and GagD also
induced a robust reduction, but pairing with GagB, GagC, and PolB
exhibited lower excision efficiency in reducing the reporter activity
(Figure 1D). Direct PCR genotyping with 50-LTR or 30-LTR primers
paired with the structural primers validated the cleaving efficiency of
all of the sgRNA combinations (Figure 1E). To further validate the
fragmental deletion and provide a rationale for quadruplex sgRNAs
(see below), we selected a combination of sgRNAs of LTR-1 and
GagD for TA cloning and Sanger sequencing. The results showed
the expected sequence of the fragment after deletion between the
two target sites (Figure S1 for LTR-1 plus GagD). These data suggest
that all of the sgRNAs selected for the saCas9 system are highly effi-
cient in making DSBs at their predicted target sites and that pairing
the LTR sgRNAs with sgRNAs targeting viral structural regions
induced varying degrees of functional excision.
Multiplex sgRNAs in an All-in-One AAV Vector Result in More
Potent Excision
To ensure maximum efficiency of HIV-1 excision and suppression,
we selected the pair of LTR-1 and GagD to compare the excision ef-
ficiency from co-transfection of two single sgRNA-expressing vectors
versus transfection of one duplex sgRNA-expressing vector. The
smaller size of saCas9 (3.159 kb) allows a single AAV vector to harbor
two sgRNA-expressing cassettes and an saCas9-expressing cassette
for efficient AAV packaging and gene delivery.22 Transfection
of the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 vector induced a further reduction of
luciferase reporter activity as compared with the co-transfection
of two separate single sgRNA/saCas9 vectors (Figure 2A). Cleavage
of the reporter gene was confirmed by PCR genotyping, and the
ratio of the cleaved fragmental band over the wild-type band ex-
hibited the stronger cleaving capability of the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9
vector than the two separate sgRNA/saCas9 vectors (Figure 2B). The
outperforming effect of the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 may result from
the co-expression of these three components in the same cells.

 As demonstrated above and previously,11,15,16 two LTR sgRNAs are
capable of excising the entire HIV-1 genome in addition to the frag-
mental deletion of both LTRs, and a combination of sgRNAs targeting
to LTRs and structural protein resulted in higher proviral cleavage
efficiency and easier PCR genotyping. To combine these two features
for optimized efficiency, we selected a cocktail of LTR-1, LTR-3,
GagD, and PolB sgRNAs and cloned their expression cassettes into
an all-in-one saCas9 AAV vector using a novel interchangeable infu-
sion cloning strategy. By transient transfection with equal amounts of
the duplex or quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9-expressing single plasmid,
we found that the quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 plasmid was more
effective at reducing EcoHIV-eLuc reporter activity (Figure 2C).
This was validated by the PCR genotyping, which showed a stronger
reduction of the wild-type band generated by PCR primers across the
50-LTR and Gag (Figures 2D and 2E). The primers T361/T458
(Figure 1A) detected a fragmental deletion between 50-LTR-1 and

the representative fragmental 296-bp deletion between LTR-1 and LTR-3 target sites at the third nucleotide from PAM and to an additional 180-bp insertion, which were
validated by TA cloning and Sanger sequencing (C). (D and E) Three LTR sgRNAs paired with viral structural sgRNAs induced robust inhibition of EcoHIV-eLuc activity by the
ONE-Glo Luciferase Assay (D) and fragmental deletion/insertion by direct PCR genotyping with the indicated primers (E). The representative fragmental deletion in the dotted
box in (E) was corroborated with Sanger sequencing (see Figure S1). HEK293T cells in six wells of the 96-well plate were co-transfected with the pNL4-3-EcoHIV-eLuc
reporter (10 ng/well), the pCMV-renilla-luciferase reporter (2 ng/well), and the indicated Cas9/sgRNA-expressing vectors as follows: for the spCas9 system (B), pLV-EF1a-
spCas9-T2A-RFP (80 ng/well) and the indicated sgRNA expression vectors (60 ng/well each for paired gRNAs); for the saCas9 system (B and D), pX601-saCas9/LTR sgRNA
expression vectors (100 ng/well each for indicted pairs). After 48 hr, eLuc activity in the cell lysates was measured with the ONE-Glo luciferase assay system and renilla-
luciferase activity was measured with the Renilla-Luciferase Assay System. Data represent the mean ± SD of four independent transfections with percentage changes in eLuc
after renilla-luciferase normalization as compared with the corresponding empty pX601 vector. Two additional wells of the transfected cells were used for direct PCR
genotyping (C and E). Similar experiments were repeated two to three times.

 GagD and an additional insertion in the duplex group, while another
fragmental deletion expected between 50-LTR-3 and GagD was
observed in the quadruplex group (Figure 2D). The primer pair
T710/T458 (Figure 1A) detected the predicted fragment after deletion
between the 50-LTR-3 and GagD sites (Figure 2E). Further PCR gen-
otyping analysis of the Gag/Pol and 30-LTR regions showed that the
quadruplex sgRNA system had greater potential for cleaving the
entire HIV-1 genome. The primer T758/T363 detected the two dele-
tions between GagD and 30-LTR-1 or LTR-3 (Figure 2F), while T689/
T363 detected the two deletions between PolB and LTR-1 or LTR-3
(Figure 2G). The primer T689/T711 detected one deletion as
predicted (Figure 2H). Comparative analysis of the band intensity
for the fragment deletions showed that LTR-1 and GagD were most
effective, while LTR-3 was less efficient in the quadruplex sgRNAs/
saCas9 system (Figures 2D, 2F, and 2G). These cleaving patterns sug-
gest that the quadruplex cocktail strategy is the most effective at
excising HIV-1 entire genome due to multiplex fragmental deletions
and multiple indel mutations around the target sequence.
Quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 Can Be Packaged in a Single
AAV-DJ Vector for More Effective Genome Editing
The successful packaging of monoplex and duplex sgRNAs/saCas9
into a single AAV vector was reported recently.22 The duplex
sgRNAs/saCas9-expressing cassette (4.969 kb) almost reaches the
packaging limit of AAV viruses (�5.0–5.2 kb).23 However, genome
sizes ranging from 5.2 to 8.9 kb have been reported for efficient

(A and B) Duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 exhibited stronger inhibition of EcoHIV-eLuc activity (A) and excision of the HIV-1 genome (B). The excision efficiency (%) indicates the
density of the fragmental deletion band over the total bands (B). (C–J) Quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 exhibited stronger inhibition of EcoHIV-eLuc activity (C) and higher
excision efficiency at both 50-LTR-1/LTR-3 with GagD (D and E) or GagD/PolB with 30-LTR (F–J). The primer T361/T458 (D) detected fragmental deletions between 50-LTR-1/
LTR-3 and GagD (arrows) and an additional insertion was observed in both the duplex and quadruplex groups (arrowhead). T710/T458 detected the deletion between
50-LTR-3 and GagD (E). Deletions between GagD or PolB and 30-LTR-1/LTR-3 were detected by the primer T758/T363 (F) and T689/T363 (G), respectively. The primer pair
T689/T711 detected the deletion between PolB and 30-LTR-1 (H). The genomic DNA was normalized with saCas9 and b-actin (J). HEK293T cells in a 96-well plate were co-
transfected with the EcoHIV-eLuc reporter plus two individual monoplex sgRNA-expressing vectors (100 ng each), one duplex sgRNA-expressing vector (100 ng) with an
empty pX601 vector (100 ng) to achieve an equal amount of DNA (200 ng, A and B), or one duplex/quadruplex sgRNA-expressing vector and the sgRNA control (100 ng
each, C–J). After 48 hr, the ONE-Glo Luciferase Assay (A and C) was performed as described in Figure 1, and direct PCR genotyping (B and D–J) was performed using the
indicated primer pairs.

 AAV packaging and gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo.24–26
Therefore, we tested whether the quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 expres-
sion cassettes (5.716 kb) can be packaged efficiently into an AAV
virus. We selected the AAV-DJ serotype because it combines the
features of eight native AAV serotypes (AAV-2, AAV-4, AAV-5,
AAV-8, AAV-9, avian AAV, bovine AAV, and caprine AAV) for a
higher transduction efficiency in a broader range of cells/tissues,27
escapes from antibody neutralization,28 and provides the highest liver
transduction efficiency in vivo. Liver enrichment is integral for
demonstrating the proof of concept that the HIV-1 provirus can
be excised in vivo. For the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9, a viral titer
of �4.15–4.3 � 1013 genomic copies (GC)/mL (unpurified crude
lysate) was obtained as determined by PCR, with a functional titer
of 4.4–9.7 � 108 transduction units (TU)/mL, as determined by
immunocytochemistry with an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody
that detects the HA-tagged saCas9 protein. For the quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9, a similar genomic titer of 4.2 � 1013 GC/mL was
obtained with a functional titer of 2.5 � 108 TU/mL, which is
1.8- to 3.9-fold less than that from the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 (Fig-
ure S2). These data suggest that the quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9
AAV can be successfully packaged into an AAV-DJ virus that can effi-
ciently infect mammalian cells with functional expression of the
saCas9 protein.
AAV-Mediated Gene Delivery of Multiplex sgRNAs/saCas9
Effectively Excises HIV-1 Proviral DNA in Neural Stem Cells from
HIV-1 Tg26 Transgenic Mice
The HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mouse was previously generated to
contain a loci integrated with more than 10 copies of the pNL4-3 pro-
viral genome with a 3.1-kb deletion spanning the partial Gag and Pol
genes to render virus replication incompetent.29 These Tg26 mice
develop a well-characterized kidney disease associated with HIV-1
viral gene expression30,31 and potential uncharacterized neurological
and cardiovascular deficits.32 Before in vivo studies, we evaluated the
HIV-1 excision efficiency of multiplex sgRNAs/saCas9 using neural
stem cells (NSCs)/neural progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from
Tg26 transgenic mice. The rationale for using NSCs/NPCs is the
increasing evidence showing the potential HIV infection/latency in
NSCs/NPCs,33–40 which may relate to HIV-associated neurocognitive
disorders (HANDs). Immunocytochemistry with an anti-HA anti-
body in mouse NSCs/NPCs after sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ infection
showed that the monoplex sgRNA/saCas9 AAV-DJ infected 92.3% of
cells determined at 20 days post-inoculation with a functional MOI
(fMOI) of 10, which equals 1.8 � 105 genomic MOI (gMOI), suggest-
ing that the AAV-DJ virus is highly effective at infecting NSCs/NPCs.
Equal fMOIs of duplex (6.5 � 105 gMOI) or quadruplex (2.1 � 106
gMOI) sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ (Figure S2) produced similar infec-
tion efficiencies of around 87.63% and 90.52%, respectively (Figures
3A–3C). Afterward, we determined the efficiency of both duplex
and quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 in cleaving the integrated HIV-1
proviral DNA in cultured NSCs/NPCs. We first validated the dose-
dependent delivery of saCas9 and sgRNAs by PCR analysis at
2 days after AAV-DJ infection (Figures 3D and 3E). Then, we evalu-
ated the HIV-1 excision efficacy by PCR genotyping. Both duplex and
quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 induced a dose-dependent deletion of the
predicted DNA fragments at 2 days after AAV infection, while quad-
ruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 induced a higher cleaving efficiency when an
equal fMOI was used (Figure 3F). The cleavage efficiency was dramat-
ically increased at 20 days post-infection (Figure 3G) because of
the long-term AAV transduction leading to sustained expression of
saCas9/sgRNAs and cumulative genome editing. Again, the quadru-
plex induced a higher efficiency of HIV-1 excision (Figure 3G) despite
the similar infection efficiency (Figures 3B and 3C). These data sug-
gest that AAV-mediated multiplex sgRNAs/saCas9 can effectively
excise the integrated HIV-1 proviral genome in cultured NSCs/
NPCs from HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mice and the oversized quadru-
plex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ retains high efficiency of gene trans-
duction and functional genome editing.
Multiplex sgRNAs/saCas9 Effectively Excises HIV-1 Proviral
DNA in Various Tissues/Organs of HIV-1 Tg26 Transgenic Mice
To test whether the Cas9/sgRNA system is capable of excising inte-
grated HIV-1 proviral DNA in vivo, we selected the AAV-DJ sero-
type for in vivo gene delivery.27,41 As shown in Figure S3A, one single
dose of AAV-DJ virus (4.15–4.20 � 1012 GC) via tail-vein injection
could efficiently deliver sgRNAs- and saCas9-expressing cDNA into
the liver and spleen in the first week alone. Histopathological and
immunohistochemical examination of the liver did not identify any
AAV-related tissue toxicity. The observed high transduction effi-
ciency and minimal tissue toxicity is consistent with a previous
report using similar dosages in adult mice.42 One additional injection
of the same dose at 1 week after the first injection did show a consis-
tent pattern of transgene distribution (Figure S3B). The AAV-DJ
carrying duplex or quadruplex sgRNAs along with saCas9 results
in similar gene delivery efficiencies in several organs (Figures S3A
and S3B), even though the insertion of quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9
appears to be beyond the limits of AAV packaging capacity. To
determine the efficacy of sgRNAs/saCas9 in cleaving the integrated
HIV-1 genome in animal tissues/organs, PCR genotyping was
performed with a pair of primers that can amplify the fragmental
deletion and ascertain the excision event.11,15,16 For the 50-LTR/
Gag deletion, we did not observe any fragmental deletions 1 week
after infection by using nested PCR amplification, which is likely
due to a low expression level of saCas9 in the first week after in vivo
AAV delivery (data not shown). However, after conducting the opti-
mization of the nested PCR analysis using the indicated primer pairs
(Figure S3C), we observed the fragmental deletion to various extents
in most organs/tissues, particularly in the liver, bone marrow, and
spleen (Figure S3D). The additional AAV injection at 7 days after
the first infection did increase the cleaving efficiency in most
organs/tissues (Figure S3D). Because there are more than 10 copies
of the HIV-1 transgene in a single tandem repeat in Tg26 mice,29
the size of the fragmental deletion, which is based on where the exci-
sion occurs in the tandem repeat, varied; some were larger than
predicted, implying potential differences in DNA repairing events
between tissues/organs. These fragmental deletions were verified by
TA cloning of representative bands and Sanger sequencing (Fig-
ure S3E). Again, both duplex and quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9

 AAV-DJ induced a similar pattern of fragmental deletion mainly in
the liver, while other organs showed a variable pattern of fragmental
deletions (Figure S3D).
To expand the tissue ranges and potential cell types of HIV-1 excision
in Tg26 transgenic mice, we packaged the quadruplex sgRNAs/
saCas9 all-in-one vector into AAV-DJ/8, which increases gene deliv-
ery efficiency in other tissues/organs rather than the liver.27,41 To
maximize the in vivo transduction efficiency, we purified and concen-
trated the AAV-DJ/8 virus using large-scale preparation.43 Packaging
efficiency for the oversized quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 reached
3.07 � 1014 GC/mL, which was close to the titer of a control AAV-
Cre vector (4.21 � 1014 GC/mL) that was prepared at the same
time. One intravenous (i.v.) injection of the purified quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 (1.5 � 1012 GC/mouse) resulted in effi-
cient transduction of the saCas9 transgene in most organs/tissues
collected (Figure S4A). The expression of saCas9 mRNA and protein
in transduced organs/tissues was validated by RT-qPCR with primers
targeting saCas9 and immunohistochemistry with an anti-HA anti-
body (Figure S5A). For the 50-LTR/Gag primer pair, we observed
visible fragmental deletions of the designed size using conventional
PCR conditions (Figure 4A). Using the Gag/30-LTR primer pair, we
observed the fragmental deletion in liver, lung, and brain tissues
under conventional PCR conditions (Figure 4B). TA cloning and
Sanger sequencing validated the fragmental deletion of the designed
size in both the brain and liver (Figure S6). One additional infection
(1.5 � 1012 GC/mouse) 2 weeks after the first injection expanded the
range of transduced tissues/organs and increased the gene transduc-
tion efficiency of saCas9 and sgRNAs 4 weeks after the first injection
(Figures S4B and S5B). The excision efficiency as shown by the

excision of 50-LTR/GagD and GagD/30-LTR (F) at 2 days post-infection. Relative fold changes or excision efficiency (%) were calculated via densitometry. (G) Quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 showed stronger cleavage efficacy than the duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 at 20 days post-infection with an fMOI of 10. The primers T361/T458 detected the

normalization of genomic DNA. Control-882 AAV-DJ virus was used as a nonfunctional control. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; NSC, neural
stem cell.

 fragmental deletion with the Gag/30-LTR primer pair for PCR geno-
typing was also increased in the liver and lungs and expanded to other
organs such as the kidney and spleen (Figure 4C). RT-qPCR analysis
revealed a significant reduction in mRNA expression of structural
viral proteins Gag and Env in the brain, kidneys, liver, and lungs (Fig-

neys (Figures 4G and S4C). This is supported by our other studies in
HIV-1 transgenic mice and rats.17 Taken together, both AAV-DJ and
AAV-DJ/8 viruses harboring either duplex or quadruplex sgRNAs/
saCas9 achieved sufficient gene delivery in vivo and subsequent exci-
sion of the integrated HIV-1 genome in various organs/tissues of
Tg26 transgenic mice.
Whole-genome sequencing and off-target analysis in our previ-
ous studies11,15,16 and other reports2,44–47 did not detect any
apparent off-target effects of spCas9 with multiplex sgRNAs in
cultured primary cells or cell lines. To examine any potential in vivo
off-target effects in this study, we performed a T7E1 assay using
genomic DNA from the tissues/organs of Tg26 mice treated with
quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9. Based on potential off-target sites pre-
dicted by bioinformatics analysis as we previously described,11,48
we selected two to three predicted sites for each sgRNA target
(LTR-1, LTR-3, and GagD) with the highest score of specificity
and we performed high-fidelity PCR generating a 500- to 800-bp
product for T7E1 evaluation. As shown in Figure S7, no mutations

In Vivo HIV-1 Excision Is Visualized in an Experimental Mouse
Model Inoculated with Cell-Free EcoHIV-eLuc Reporter Virus
A transgenic mouse model, such as the aforementioned Tg26 mouse,
can be used to test our saCas9 system on HIV proviral excision but
does not recapitulate clinical HIV infection/latency in terms of
HIV-1 proviral copies/loci, random integration, various infected
cell types, and the high rate of HIV mutation. To further test the
feasibility and efficiency of HIV-1 excision by our approach using
AAV-sgRNA/saCas9 after systemic HIV-1 infection, we utilized
an EcoHIV-eLuc reporter virus to infect a conventional NCr strain
of nude mice.19,49,50 Right after EcoHIV-eLuc inoculation (total
250 ng HIV p24/mouse, n = 3) via retro-orbital injection in the right
eye, a single dose of AAV-DJ/8 (3.07 � 1012 GC/mouse) was injected
into the same mice via the same injection route immediately after
EcoHIV inoculation. Another three NCr mice were injected with
only EcoHIV-eLuc of the same dosage as a negative control group.
We performed longitudinal bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of the
live animals over 19 days after EcoHIV-eLuc inoculation (Figure 5A).
We observed a significant reduction in EcoHIV-eLuc reporter activity
on both days 9 and 19 from the entire mouse or the right eye area
(Figures 5B and 5C). Compared with the negative control group,
the reduction in EcoHIV-eLuc infection by AAV-sgRNAs/saCas9
treatment was statistically significant, as measured by the biolumines-
cence output from the neck lymph node at the dorsal (p < 0.011) and

(A) AAV-DJ/8 was administered via a retro-orbital injection into the blood sinus of the right eye of each mouse (n = 3) right after EcoHIV-eLuc inoculation via the same injection
route. Representative bioluminescence imaging of one mouse on days 6, 9, 12, and 19 post-EcoHIV inoculation is shown. All of the images were measured for radiance
(photon/second/Sr2) and pseudocolored with the same rainbow scale for fair comparison. (B) Total flux of bioluminescence (total photons/second, P/S) measured from the

in each mouse was measured from the ROI defined on the right eye for comparison. Data represent the mean ± SD, with statistical significance indicated by an asterisk in
each comparison (p < 0.05, Student’s one-sided t test). (D) The bioluminescence output from the neck lymph node of each mouse (n = 3 until day 19 [n = 2]) was used for

 ventral (p < 0.014) sides during the entire course of the experiment
(19 days) using a linear mixed-effects model for statistical significance
(Figure 5D).
To validate the in vivo excision efficiency, we performed PCR geno-
typing using the established above-mentioned PCR conditions at
the endpoint of experiments. The efficient transduction of saCas9,
GagD, and LTR-1 transgenes by AAV-DJ/8 was detected mainly in
the liver, while it varied slightly in other organs and tissues (Figures
6A–6C). Using conventional PCR, we observed an efficient and
robust excision of the predicted fragment in most tissues/organs,
with the highest efficacy observed in the injected right eye area, heart,
blood, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes (Figures 6D–6F). The variability
in edited tissues from different animals may result from the random
cellular/tissue distribution of EcoHIV-eLuc infection, AAV-mediated
gene delivery, and Cas9-mediated excision. Again, some of the frag-
mental deletions were validated by TA cloning and Sanger sequencing
(Figure S8). To quantify the excision efficiency of quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 in vivo, we performed qPCR analysis of the excised
fragments using three different primer combinations (Figure S9).
The melting peak curve analysis clearly identified three types of
proviral DNA excisions as designed: 50-LTR-1 to GagD, GagD to
30-LTR-1, or GagD to 30-LTR-3. Using the uncut (non-targeting) re-
gion (the sequence flanking both target sites) as internal normaliza-
tion, we assessed the excision efficiency in selected tissues/organs
(Figures 6G–6I). Although the individual number may underestimate
the efficiency due to various combinations of excision, the results
clearly showed that the excision efficiency (Figures 6G–6I) was
consistent with PCR genotyping (Figures 6D–6F). The excision types
and efficiency varied with different organs/tissues (Figures 6G–6I).

 Interestingly, all three types of excision occurred with 96% efficiency
for the GagD/30-LTR in the B1M3 mouse liver (Figure 6I). These data
suggest that the quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 is highly
effective at excising the HIV proviral genome even in newly infected
cells during in vivo systematic HIV infection.
In Vivo Excision of HIV-1 Provirus from Latently Infected Human
Cells Is Detected in Humanized BLT Mice
To demonstrate the feasibility of saCas9/sgRNA genome editing on
excising the HIV-1 provirus in a more clinically relevant animal
model, we administered AAV-DJ/8 carrying sgRNAs/saCas9 into hu-
manized BLT mice inoculated with a R5-, M-tropic HIVNL-BaL-eLuc
reporter virus via vaginal mucosal transmission (n = 3; mouse iden-
tification [ID] nos. B5M2, B5M3, and B6M3) or intraperitoneal injec-
tion (n = 3; mouse ID nos. B7M2, B7M4, and B10M4). Whole-body
BLI (unpublished data) with a sensitivity of visualizing five single cells
in a niche was used to longitudinally visualize and analyze the spatio-
temporal dynamics of HIV-1 dissemination in these BLT mice.50
These BLT mice showed a certain degree of either local or systemic
HIV dissemination, but the infection diminished and completely
ceased after the first 60 days without any visible infection determined
by whole-body BLI examination in the following 70 days or longer.
This phenomenon could possibly be attributed to T-cell depletion,
HIV-1 latency, or the possible silencing of eLuc reporter by mutations
during HIV-1 replication. Since no HIV-1 genome was detected by
nested PCR in some of the tissues (Figure 7), the contribution of
Figure 7. Excision of HIV Proviral DNA by Quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 in Humanized BLT Mice Inoculated with HIVNL-BaL-eLuc at 2, 3, and 4 Weeks

Conventional PCR (35 cycles) using primer pair T361/T458 (for amplifying 50-LTR/Gag) was used to detect the presence of HIV proviral DNA, which showed a weak wild-type
band (1.4 kb) in the lung tissue of the B6M3 negative control without saCas9/sgRNA treatment (C). Nested PCR (35 cycles) using primer pair T361/T946 (for 50-LTR/Gag) with
the template from the first-round PCR (22 cycles with the primer pair T361/T458) identified the wild-type DNA fragment (1.13 kb) of HIV-1 proviral DNA in most, if not all,
organs/tissues of each BLT mouse (A–F) and the PCR product of fragmental deletions resulted from HIV-1 excision in the heart, colon, and vagina of HIV-infected BLT mice
treated with saCas9/sgRNA (A). Nested PCR with the primer pair T758/T363 (for Gag/30-LTR) using the template from the first-round PCR (25 cycles, T758/T425) identified
the fragmental deletion bands in organs/tissues of saCas9/sgRNA-treated BLT mice (A, B, D, and E) but not the untreated BLT mice (C and F). The fragmental deletion bands
resulted from saCas9 editing were framed with dotted boxes followed by TA cloning and Sanger sequencing for validation (see Figures S10 and S11). The positive control
represents the excision of the EcoHIV-eLuc reporter in HEK293T cells transfected with AAV-saCas9/sgRNA (LTR-1 plus GagD) vector. BxMx, box and mouse number.

 mutation to the silenced reporter expression is less likely, which is
further confirmed by our observation in another ongoing study that
BLT mice showed successful systemic infection and latency under
cART (unpublished data). The quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-
DJ/8 was administered via both intravenous and intravaginal routes
in HIV-infected BLT mice B5M2 and B5M3, but not B6M3, which
served as the negative control. A single intravenous injection of
AAV-DJ/8 was administered to HIV-infected BLT mice B7M2 and
B7M4, but not B10M4, which served as the negative control. At
2–4 weeks after AAV delivery, BLT mice were euthanized and
genomic DNA samples were extracted from major organs/tissues
for PCR genotyping as described above. The presence of HIV-1 pro-
viral DNA in the harvested organs/tissues was validated with nested
PCR using the 50-LTR/Gag primer pairs (T361/T458 then T361/
T946) (Figure 7). Importantly, we detected the fragmental deletion
with both the 50-LTR/Gag primer pair T361/T946 and the Gag/
30-LTR primer pair T758/T363 (Figures 7A, 7B, 7D, and 7E) in the
vagina, heart, lungs, right eye (AAV injection site), colon, and human
thymic organoid under the left kidney capsule. In particular, we
observed a much higher intensity of the band representing a frag-
mental deletion, while the band representing the uncut proviral
DNA was barely visible in the same tissue (e.g., the heart and colon
of the B5M3 mouse) (Figure 7B). This result clearly suggests an effi-
cient excision of HIV-1 proviral DNA in latently infected human cells
within a solid tissue via a single i.v. injection of quadruplex sgRNAs/
saCas9 AAV-DJ/8. TA cloning of these PCR products and Sanger
sequencing validated the fragmental deletions (Figure S10 for PCR
products from 50-nested PCR using primer pair T361/T946; Fig-
ure S11 for PCR products from 30-nested PCR using primer pair
T758/T363). Within the cleaved residual sequence at both the
50-LTR/Gag region (Figure S10) and the Gag/30-LTR region (Fig-
ure S11), various degrees of insertion or deletion were observed be-
tween the predicted cleaving sites at the third nucleotide from PAM
of the targeting sgRNAs (Figures S10A and S11A). These sets of
pre-clinical data demonstrate the proof of principle that quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 can be delivered by AAV-DJ/8 into resident HIV-1
latently infected human cells in major tissues and organs in a human-
ized mouse model to excise integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the effective
excision of HIV-1 proviral DNA from the host genome in pre-clinical
animal models using saCas9 and multiplex sgRNAs delivered by an
all-in-one AAV-DJ/8 vector. These AAV viruses induce effective
gene delivery and HIV-1 excision in vitro as well as in vivo in
HIV-1 Tg26 transgenic mice, EcoHIV-eLuc acutely infected mice,
and HIV-1-infected humanized BLT mice. Based on the extensive
and highly promising clinical application of AAVs in gene therapy
(for review, see Fuchs and Desrosiers51 and Brady et al.52), our study
demonstrates the proof of principle for treating HIV-1/AIDS with the
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach. Furthermore, the combina-
tion of easy/fast multiplex sgRNA cloning, rapid reporter screening,
reliable direct PCR genotyping, and highly efficient AAV virus pro-
duction provides potential for using saCas9/sgRNA genome editing
in personalized and precision medicine. Using multiplex sgRNAs to
target multiple HIV proviral DNA simultaneously is beneficial to
prevent the potential escape of HIV due to the high mutation rate
during HIV-1 replication because the probability of double mutations
in two different target sequences in the same HIV proviral genome is
much lower than that of single mutation in a target site. Finally, we
demonstrate that the quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 strategy combining
sgRNAs targeting two LTR sites (at both the 50 and 30 ends) and two
structural proteins (Gag and Pol) is a promising therapeutic candidate
for HIV-1 excision, due to maximization of the possibility of multiple
indel mutations on six on-target sites and fragmental deletions among
these sites. This quadruplex strategy also provides additional advan-
tages, including (1) its ability to greatly reduce the potential of HIV-1
escape,53,54 (2) the high possibility of HIV-1 excision despite the
continuous proviral mutation in the clinical HIV-1 patient popula-
tion, (3) reliable loss-of-function achievement due to removal of a
substantial portion of the target gene or genome,55 and (4) optimal
efficiency of excision.16
In vivo genome editing efficiency relies mainly on effective gene de-
livery. Lentivirus-mediated Cas9/gRNA delivery has been preferen-
tially and extensively employed in most laboratories;56,57 however,
safety and immunogenicity concerns limit its clinical applications.58
AAV-mediated gene therapy is becoming a promising approach in
clinical trials because it reduces the risks of mutagenesis, toxicity,
and severe host immune response.3,59 The feasibility and efficiency
of AAV-mediated Cas9 delivery has been tested extensively both
in vitro and in vivo (for review, see Moser and Hirsch60). Several
laboratories using minimal promoters and poly(A) sequences have
reported success in applying AAV-spCas9 in cultured cells and ani-
mal models.4,61–64 Splitting spCas9 into functional N-terminal and
C-terminal parts65,66 provides a new way to deliver spCas9 more effi-
ciently in pre-clinical animal models.67,68 The AAV-split-spCas9
nickase vector using the GyrA intein system dramatically increases
the specificity of genome editing.69 Among several smaller Cas9
orthologs, saCas9 has been well characterized and is highly promising
for animal studies and clinical applications. The high efficiency of
AAV packaging and gene transduction in animal models using
saCas9 plus one or two sgRNA-expressing cassettes has been tested
in an all-in-one AAV vector with various AAV serotypes.2,4–7 Here,
we demonstrate that duplex HIV-sgRNAs with saCas9 in an all-in-
one AAV-DJ vector are capable of delivering transgenes and excising
the HIV-1 genome in cultured cells and particularly in various
organs/tissues of Tg26 transgenic mice. This is supported by our
recent study using duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV9 in HIV-1 transgenic
mice and rats.17 Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oversized
all-in-one AAV vector encoding quadruplex sgRNAs and saCas9
is similarly capable of achieving high-titer packaging into the
AAV-DJ/8 virus and inducing effective excision of the HIV-1 genome
in vitro and in vivo.
Several approaches to place multiplex sgRNA-expressing cassettes in
an all-in-one vector have been reported. Using the RNA processing
property of the Csy4 protein or ribozymes, a single transcript under

 a Pol II promoter can be processed into multiple sgRNAs.70,71 Multi-
plex vectors with up to seven sgRNAs under the same U6 promoter
have been successfully constructed using the Golden Gate cloning
method, and their multiplex targeting efficiency has been tested for
multiplex genome/epigenome editing and simultaneous activation/
repression of multiple genes.72 Multiplex sgRNAs driven by four in-
dependent Pol III promoters (human U6 promoter, mouse U6 pro-
moter, 7SK, and H1) have been also tested.57 Here we developed a
novel In-Fusion (Clontech) cloning strategy with interrogated ex-
change of two restriction enzymes, rendering easy and fast cloning
of any number of multiplex sgRNAs into a single vector. This
approach is applicable to any multiplex sgRNA under any Pol III
promoter and to various viral gene delivery systems. Although we
showed that four sgRNAs under four identical U6 promoters ex-
hibited sufficient activity to induce target DNA cleavage, we found
that the sgRNA LTR-1, GagD, and PolB in the quadruplex
sgRNAs/saCas9 system are best, while LTR-3 is weaker in cleaving
HIV-1 provirus although it does show a high potency of cleavage in
the duplex sgRNA system. Whether the location of each sgRNA
among the multiplex sgRNA cascade affects sgRNA expression
efficiency warrants further investigation. In addition, it would be
interesting to optimize the combination of various sgRNA-driven
promoters57 for maximal AAV packaging and gene transduction.
This study established the feasibility of using quadruplex sgRNAs/
saCas9 AAV gene therapy in excising the integrated HIV-1 provirus
in both Tg26 transgenic mice and humanized BLT mice. sgRNAs/
saCas9 can be considered as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dur-
ing EcoHIV inoculation in conventional mice. The intravenous
administration of AAV-DJ or AAV-DJ/8 achieved extensive gene
transduction and HIV-1 excision in most tissues/organs, with the
highest in liver followed by the heart, lungs, spleen, vagina, colon,
and lymph nodes. Using outgrowth assays, it was estimated that
only �30 HIV-1 latently infected resting T cells (total 3 � 106 resting
T cells/BLT mouse � 9.9 infectious units per million cells) can be de-
tected in each HIV-1-infected BLT mouse.73 Because of the difficulty
in isolating HIV-infected resting T cells from the high density of solid
lymph tissue or somatic organs of humanized BLT mice or EcoHIV-
infected mice, we employed a novel in vivo imaging system as
we previously described50 to monitor suppressed HIV-1 expression
longitudinally to establish a latency model, followed by PCR genotyp-
ing to detect the existence or absence of proviral DNA in tissues/
organs. One of the priorities in the HIV/AIDS field is to eliminate
proviruses from latently infected resting CD4+ T cells and other latent
cellular reservoirs in vivo. This study demonstrates the clear excision
of Gag/30-LTR and 50-LTR/Gag fragments in latently infected human
cells within mouse multiple organs/tissues by a single AAV-DJ/8
administration in HIV-infected humanized BLT mice. This finding
also validates the vast extent of tissue reservoirs harboring HIV-1 vi-
ruses. However, further studies are needed to target latently infected
T cells in order to eliminate viremia rebound after cART.
The findings reported here provide justification for further clinical
development of the Cas9/sgRNA approach for HIV-1 excision in pre-
venting and improving HIV-1 diseases. However, its pharmacological
index and window need to be evaluated further in a more clinically
relevant animal model, such as simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV)-infected non-human primates. In addition, the future of the
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system in vivo would rely on a very
effective gene/protein delivery vehicle such as nanoparticles, which
can be manufactured in different sizes with different targeting prop-
erties.74,75 Gene delivery efficiency will be improved over time for
HIV-1 latent cells, such as resting CD4+ T cells, monocytes/macro-
phages, or hematopoietic stem cells, via the continuous and extensive
exploration of new AAV serotypes,62 integrase-deficient lentivi-
ruses,76 and nanoparticles.7,74,77
Potential off-target effects of the Cas9/sgRNA system in mammalian
cells have been a great concern in this field. Many technologies
and strategies have been developed in recent years and Cas9
specificity has been improved significantly; however, continued
vigilance is still required (for review, see Tycko et al.78). Although
plenty of studies, including ours, have used various strategies,
such as whole-genome sequencing,11,15,16 genome-wide, unbiased
identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq),44,79 di-
genome sequencing (digenome-seq),80,81, and direct in situ breaks
labeling,
enrichment
on
streptavidin,
and
next-generation
sequencing (BLESS)2 to measure off-target effects, none or very
few off-target effects have been detected thus far.2,11,44–47,82,83 How-
ever, further comprehensive and deep analysis on the potential off-
target effects for Cas9/sgRNA-mediated HIV excision is still needed
before clinical trials.
In conclusion, the saCas9 protein’s smaller size allows duplex or even
quadruplex sgRNA-expressing cassettes to be delivered in an all-in-
one AAV vector for high-titer packaging and robust gene transduc-
tion in cell cultures and animal models. The saCas9 with quadruplex
sgRNAs targeting both 50- and 30-end LTRs and structural Gag and
Pol regions induces versatile patterns of small indel mutations and
large fragmental deletions and thus provides optimal efficiency of
HIV-1 genome excision. The feasibility and efficacy of HIV-1 excision
in animals via this highly promising AAV gene therapy will pave the
way toward clinical trials in the near future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatics Design of gRNAs
We utilized the Broad Institute gRNA designer tool for highly
effective gRNA design (https://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/
analysis-tools/sgrna-design) because this tool also provides the
extended spacer sequence (NNNN[20nt]NGGNNN) for the spCas9
system. The saCas9 PAM sequence for optimal on-target cleaving
is NNGRR(N). We selected only NGGRR(N) because it contains
NGG PAM and thus the designed seed sequence for saCas9
system can also be used to the well-established spCas9 system. To
test this, we picked three sgRNAs targeting the HIV-1 LTR pro-
moter region, three sgRNAs targeting Gag, and one sgRNA target-
ing Pol. The oligonucleotides for these sgRNA targets are listed in
Table 1.

Vectors
The pNL4-3-EcoHIV-eLuc and pHIVNL-BaL-eLuc reporter vectors
were constructed as previously described.16,48,50 A pair of oligonucle-
otides for each targeting site with 50-CACC and 30-AAAC overhang
(Table 1) was obtained from AlphaDNA. The target seed sequence
was cloned via BsaI sites into pX601-AAV-CMV::NLS-saCas9-
NLS-3xHA-bGHpA;U6::BsaI-sgRNA (a gift from Feng Zhang via
Addgene) (61591; Addgene).2 The pX601 AAV was digested with
BsaI, treated with antarctic phosphatase, and purified with a Quick
nucleotide removal kit (QIAGEN). An equal amount of complemen-
tary oligonucleotide was mixed in T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK)
buffer for annealing. These annealed seed pairs were phosphorylated
with T4 PNK and ligated into the BsaI-digested AAV using T7 DNA
ligase. The ligation mixture was transformed into Stabl3 competent
cells. Positive clones were identified by PCR screening and verified
by Sanger sequencing. For multiplex sgRNA cloning, we established
two approaches: double digestion traditional cloning and In-Fusion
seamless PCR cloning. In the double digestion strategy, the target
AAV vector was first digested with KpnI and blunted, and then

 digested with EcoRI, while the transfer insert harboring the expected
sgRNA expression cassette was first digested with NotI and blunted
and then digested with EcoRI. The insert and the vector were purified
with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) followed by stan-
dard overhang/blunt end cloning. The positive duplex sgRNA-
expressing AAV clones were identified by double digestion with
NotI and BamHI or EcoRI. In the In-Fusion PCR cloning strategy,
the target AAV vector was linearized with EcoRI and KpnI. The inser-
tion fragment was produced via PCR using the primer pair T795/
T796 (Table 1) with a mutation of the 30-end KpnI site (for further
addition of new sgRNAs) and the transfer sgRNA AAV vector as
the template. After purification, the linearized vector and the inser-
tion PCR product were ligated using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit
(Clontech). The positive duplex sgRNA-expressing AAV clones
were identified by double digestion with NotI and BamHI or EcoRI.
Using a similar proof of principle for both cloning strategies, the
duplex sgRNAs/saCas9 vector can serve as a target vector for inserting
additional sgRNA expression cassettes. One necessary precaution is
to ensure the absence of these digestion sites (KpnI, NotI, EcoRI) in
the seed sequence of the selected sgRNAs.
Cell Culture, Transfection, and Firefly-Luciferase Reporter
Assay
HEK293T cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM containing 10%
FBS and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL strepto-
mycin) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37�C. For the
luciferase reporter assay, cells were cultured in a 96-well plate
(3 � 104 cells/well) and transfected with the indicated plasmids using
the standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. After 48 hr,
the cell were lysed and assayed with the ONE-Glo luciferase assay sys-
tem (Promega) in a 2104 EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer).
Terra PCR Direct Genotyping and Nested PCR
To perform high-throughput genotyping using PCR, cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate and transfected with indicated vectors. After
48 hr, the media were removed and the cells were treated with 45 mL
50 mM NaOH per well and incubated for 10 min at 95�C. After
neutralization with 5 mL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mL DNA extract
was used in a 10-mL PCR reaction using Terra PCR Direct Polymerase
Mix (Clontech) and the indicated primers. To genotype the excised
HIV proviral DNA from the isolated tissues and organs from
EcoHIV-eLuc inoculated mice, each tissue/organ was triturated by
each individual pair of scissors to avoid cross-contamination and
was then digested with proteinase K in a lysis buffer consisting of
1% SDS, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl in
a 55�C water bath. Genomic DNA was then extracted from the tissue
lysates using conventional phenol/chloroform extraction methods.
Tissue samples were broken up mechanically with a pestle and mortar
and were then processed with the Nucleospin tissue kit and Nucleo-
spin RNA/Protein kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols to extract genomic DNA, RNA, and protein from specific
Tg26 mouse tissues. To perform PCR genotyping, 100-ng DNA sam-
ples were denatured at 98�C for 3 min, followed by two steps of con-
ventional PCR for 35 cycles with an annealing/extension step at 68�C
for 1 min/kb. For nested PCR, the first round of reaction was run for
22–25 cycles with the indicated primers and the second round of PCR
was run for 35 cycles with the nested PCR primers.
RT-qPCR
Total RNAs from the indicated organs/tissues were extracted with an
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The
potentially residual genomic DNA was removed through on-column
DNase digestion with an RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN). One mg
of RNA for each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNAs using
random hexanucleotide primers with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). qPCR analyses of cDNA or HIV
genomic DNA were carried out in a LightCycler480 (Roche) using
a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems). The primer
pairs for saCas9, Gag, Env, and Tat were designed as shown in Table 1.
The primers for human b2 microglobulin and mouse Ppia house-
keeping genes were obtained from RealTimePrimers. The primers
for HIV excision quantification were designed as shown in Figure S8.
Each sample was tested in triplicate. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were
obtained graphically for the target genes and housekeeping genes.
Differences in Ct values between the housekeeping gene and target
genes were represented as DCt values. DDCt values were obtained
by subtracting the DCt values of control samples from those of exper-
imental samples. Relative fold or percentage change in gene expres-
sion or HIV DNA excision was calculated as 2�DDCt. In some cases,
the amplification curve and the melting peak curve were used for
the comparative analysis.
Viral Packaging and Purification
Small- and large-scale preparation of AAV-DJ and AAV-DJ/8 was
performed via an AAV production service (https://vigenebio.com/)
following a previously published protocol.84 Briefly, HEK293T cells
were co-transfected with three vectors and the viral particles were
harvested and purified by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation.
Viruses were concentrated and formulated in PBS. Virus titers were
determined by the viral genome copy number in a 1-mL sample
(GC/mL) using real-time PCR with a linearized genome plasmid as
a standard.
For packaging replication competent EcoHIV-eLuc and HIVNL-BaL-
eLuc, plasmid DNA encoding a full-length molecular clone of either
EcoHIV or HIV-1 carrying the BLI reporter (Figure S12) was trans-
fected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen).
At 24 hr post-transfection, media containing transfection reagent
and DNA were aspired and cells were washed twice with PBS. Fresh
media were added. At 48 and 60 hr post-transfection, supernatants
were collected and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter. The lentiviral
supernatant was concentrated using the Lenti-X Concentrator
(Clontech) following the manufacturer’s instructions or using 20%
sucrose density centrifugation at 20,000g, 4�C, for 4 hr.85 For
EcoHIV-eLuc, the quantity of p24 was determined by ELISA
(XpressBio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The titer of
HIVNL-BaL-eLuc was determined on GHOST(3) X4/R5 (requested
from Drs. Vineet N. Kewal Ramani and Dan R. Littman via the
Molecular Therapy

 NIH AIDS Reagent Program) for GFP expression analyzed by fluo-
rescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
Viral Inoculation of Humanized BLT Mice
The University of Pittsburgh or Temple University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all animal
care and procedures. Humanized BLT mice based on an NOD scid
gamma strain transplanted with human fetal liver, thymus, and
CD34+ cells isolated from the syngeneic liver were purchased from
the Jackson Laboratory. For infection, mice were anesthetized via
isoflurane inhalation (2%–2.5% with a 2-L/min oxygen flow rate).
Intravaginal inoculations (total 1 � 106 tissue culture infectious units
[TCIU] of HIVNL-BaL-eLuc per mouse) were performed by slowly
pipetting 20 mL viral supernatant into the vaginal canal with a
mid-size pipette tip. Intraperitoneal inoculations (total 1 � 105
TCIU of HIVNL-BaL-eLuc per mouse) were performed by injecting
100 mL indicated viral titer into the intraperitoneal cavity with a
29-gauge needle and insulin syringe. HIV infection in BLT mice
was visualized using in vivo BLI to reveal longitudinal HIV dissem-
ination. The chosen HIV-infected BLT mice were previously deter-
mined to show possible latency without detectable HIV-reporter
activity in vivo for at least 70 days or longer prior to AAV-DJ/8/
Cas9-sgRNA administration.
In Vivo AAV Injection
For the sgRNAs/saCas9 gene delivery efficiency and functional assay
in Tg26 transgenic mice, 100 mL unpurified AAV- DJ serotype or 5 mL
purified AAV- DJ/8 serotype diluted in 1� DMEM without serum in
a total volume of 100 mL was injected into animals via the tail vein. For
mice injected with AAV-DJ, group 1 was euthanized and group 2
received an additional injection 1 week after the first injection.
Group 2 was euthanized 1 week after the second injection. Control
mice were injected with AAV virus carrying an empty vector. For
mice injected with AAV-DJ/8, the interval time between group 1
and group 2 was 2 weeks.
For in vivo injection of AAV-DJ/8 into NCr nude mice inoculated
with EcoHIV-eLuc, a total of 10 mL purified AAV-DJ/8 containing
saCas9/sgRNA (3.07 � 1014 GC/mL) was first diluted in 90 mL PBS
for retro-orbital injection into the blood sinus of the right eye of
each mouse right after a retro-orbital injection of a total of 100 mL
EcoHIV-eLuc supernatant containing a total of 250 ng p24 deter-
mined by ELISA (ZeptoMetrix) at the same injection site.
The quadruplex sgRNAs/saCas9 AAV-DJ/8 delivery in BLT mice was
performed via the intravaginal or intravenous route or via both
routes, which is described in the text. Intravaginal inoculation was
performed similarly to the aforementioned HIV inoculation, with a
total of 20 mL PBS containing a total of 6.14 � 1012 GC of AAV-
DJ/8/saCas9-sgRNA per BLT mouse. Intravenous inoculation was
administered using an insulin syringe with a 29-gauge needle via
the blood sinus of the right eye (retro-orbital injection) with 100 mL
PBS containing total 6.14 � 1012 GC of AAV-DJ/8/saCas9-sgRNA
per BLT mouse.
Bioluminescence Imaging
Imaging commenced at the indicated time points after viral inocula-
tion. During all imaging, mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inha-
lation (2%–2.5% with a 2-L/min oxygen flow rate). D-luciferin
potassium salt (Gold BioTechnology) was dissolved in sterile PBS
and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight.
Bioluminescence images were acquired for 2 min (open light filter,
binning 8 � 8, f/stop 1, 100-mm field of view) using an IVIS Lumina
XR small animal optical imaging system (PerkinElmer).
Image Analysis
All image analysis was performed using Living Image 4.3.1 software.
Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the measured area or
around the entire animal for comparison and average radiance values
(in p/s/cm2/str) were used for all image evaluation. For display,
images were windowed so that all light output above background
levels adjacent to the mouse was seen. A maximum radiance value
of 110,000 p/s/cm2/str was selected for the high end of the imaging
scale and the background cutoff was set at 6,000 p/s/cm2/str, which
was the average light emission of the mice imaged at two different
time points prior to viral inoculation.
Genomic DNA, RNA, and Protein Extraction
Tissue samples of selected organs were broken up mechanically with a
pestle and mortar, then processed with the Nucleospin tissue kit and
the Nucleospin RNA/protein kit (Clontech) following the user man-
uals to extract genomic DNA, RNA, and protein. Extracted tissues
were minced with sterilized and contaminant-free scissors and result-
ing tissue was added to a lysis buffer (2.5 mM Tris base, 5 mM EDTA,
and 5 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing proteinase K and 1% SDS and
incubated at 55�C overnight. Following incubation, the resulting
mixture was extracted with one volume of phenol/CHCl3/isoamyl
alcohol (25:24:1) via inversion for 10 min. The mixture was centri-
fuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the aqueous layer was removed
and subjected to extraction once more with one volume of CHCl3/iso-
amyl alcohol (24:1) and separated via centrifugation as previously
described. To precipitate the extracted DNA, one volume of isopropa-
nol was added to the removed aqueous layer and the mixture was
inverted for 15 min. The DNA was pelleted via centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The DNA pellet was then washed
with 75% ethanol and air dried. Once nearly dry, TRIS-EDTA (TE)
buffer (pH 8.0) was added to the pellet and was resolved at 55�C
overnight.
TA Cloning and Sanger Sequencing
The bands of interest in agarose gels were excised and gel purified for
cloning into the pCRII T-A vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide
sequence of individual clones was determined by sequencing at
GENEWIZ using universal T7 and/or SP6 primers.
Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by standard
immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:200,
catalog no. 66006-1-Ig; Proteintech). The ratio of saCas9-HA-positive

 cells to Hoechst-positive nuclei was quantified in six random fields
per well for three wells. For immunohistochemistry, snap-frozen
tissues/organs underwent cryostatic sectioning at 10 mm and were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, perme-
ation with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocking with 10% normal donkey
serum, the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-HA polyclonal
antibody (1:100, catalog no. 51064-2-AP; Proteintech) in PBS with
0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4�C. After washing three times
each for 10 min, the sections were incubated with corresponding
Alexa Fluor-conjugated donkey secondary antibody (1:500; Invitro-
gen) and phalloidin (100 nM, catalog no. PHDR1; Cytoskeleton,
Inc.) for 1 hr at room temperature. Hoechst 33258 was used for
nuclear counterstaining.
Statistical Analysis
The quantitative data represent the mean ± SD from two to four in-
dependent experiments and were evaluated by the Student’s t test.
p values that were < 0.05 or 0.01 were considered statistically signif-
icant. For BLI data in the EcoHIV infection mouse model, the
Student’s t test and linear mixed-effects models were used to compare
total photon flux change over time between saCas9 plus EcoHIV
versus EcoHIV only, which was measured by BLI from both the dor-
sal and ventral sides, respectively.
