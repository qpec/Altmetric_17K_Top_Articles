In Brief
Gremel et al. show an endogenous
molecular mechanism in an identified
corticostriatal circuit that controls shifts
in behavioral control between goal-
directed and habitual strategies. Habitual
action control necessitates the
endocannabinoid-mediated weakening
of an orbitostriatal circuit that sustains
goal-directed control.

SUMMARY
Everyday function demands efficient and flexible
decision-making that allows for habitual and goal-
directed action control. An inability to shift has
been implicated in disorders with impaired deci-
sion-making, including obsessive-compulsive disor-
der and addiction. Despite this, our understanding of
the specific molecular mechanisms and circuitry
involved in shifting action control remains limited.
Here we identify an endogenous molecular mecha-
nism in a specific cortical-striatal pathway that
mediates the transition between goal-directed and
habitual action strategies. Deletion of cannabinoid
type 1 (CB1) receptors from cortical projections orig-
inating in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) prevents
mice from shifting from goal-directed to habitual
instrumental lever pressing. Activity of OFC neurons
projecting to dorsal striatum (OFC-DS) and, specif-
ically, activity of OFC-DS terminals is necessary for
goal-directed action control. Lastly, CB1 deletion
from OFC-DS neurons prevents the shift from goal-
directed to habitual action control. These data sug-
gest that the emergence of habits depends on endo-
cannabinoid-mediated attenuation of a competing
circuit controlling goal-directed behaviors.
Decision-making requires a balance between flexible and effi-
cient action selection. For normal function, we need to be able
to retrieve routine actions quickly and efficiently, and habits
serve this purpose. However, the transition between habitual
and goal-directed control provides the capacity to perform the
same action based on updated consequences. Difficulties with
stopping habits and shifting to goal-directed control underlie
numerous neuropsychiatric disorders that display impaired
decision-making (Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009; Graybiel, 2008; Grif-
fiths et al., 2014), including obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) (Burguie
` re et al., 2015; Gillan et al., 2011) and addiction
(Belin et al., 2013; Goldstein and Volkow, 2011). However, our
understanding of specific molecular mechanisms and circuitry
involved in controlling action shifting remains limited.
In everyday decision-making, the contiguity and contin-
gency of actions relative to outcomes can be somewhat pre-
dictable. Hence, it is likely that both goal-directed and habitual
action strategies are contributing to action control, although to
varying degrees. This raises the possibility that decision-mak-
ing strategies compete for downstream behavioral control.
This has been observed in supporting neural circuits, with neu-
ral coding of habitual actions in the dorsal medial striatum
(DMS), a region known to participate in support of goal-
directed control, and neural coding of goal-directed actions
in dorsal lateral striatum (DLS), a region known to support
habitual processes (Graybiel, 2008; Gremel and Costa, 2013;
Hilario et al., 2012; Stalnaker et al., 2010; Thorn et al., 2010;
Yin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2006). Thus, disorders such as OCD
and addiction may induce a pathology that results in an
over-reliance on habitual circuitry in situations in which greater
goal-directed control would be more advantageous. Such reli-
ance on habitual action circuitry has been observed following
extended and repetitive action training (Smith and Graybiel,
2013; Thorn et al., 2010) and following periods of drug self-
administration (Belin and Everitt, 2008; Corbit et al., 2012;
Dickinson et al., 2002), with notable exceptions (Colwill and
Rescorla, 1985; Samson et al., 2004). These findings under-
score the importance of understanding the mechanisms and
circuits involved in shifts between these differing action-con-
trol strategies.
We have found that the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) is neces-
sary for animals to modulate action value and shift toward
goal-directed actions (Gremel and Costa, 2013). We previ-
ously developed a within-subject, action-shifting, instrumental
lever-press task that allowed us to examine the activity of the
same neurons in involved circuits as the animal performed the
same action in a goal-directed versus habitual manner. While
other findings hypothesized a role for OFC in stimulus-
outcome learning (Ostlund and Balleine, 2007; Rolls et al.,
1996; Stalnaker et al., 2015), our previous study (Gremel and
Costa, 2013) and additional findings (Bradfield et al., 2015;
Gourley et al., 2013; Rhodes and Murray, 2013; Stalnaker
1312
Neuron 90, 1312–1324, June 15, 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc.
 et al., 2015) have identified a role for lateral OFC (Gourley
et al., 2013; Gremel and Costa, 2013) and medial OFC (Brad-
field et al., 2015) in control over goal-directed decision-making
that is independent of contextual control yet dependent on the
expected action value. Together, along with medial prefrontal
cortex (Killcross and Coutureau, 2003), these findings strongly
support OFC involvement in goal-directed decision-making.
Our previous findings suggested that to shift from goal-
directed to habitual actions necessitates a decrease in excit-
atory transmission from lateral OFC projection neurons, with
optogenetic activation selectively increasing the frequency of
goal-directed, not habitual, actions and chemogenetic inhibi-
tion of lateral OFC projection neurons preventing goal-
directed control. Shifts in action control could therefore
emerge from changes in the relative weight of OFC and down-
stream circuits, like DMS, that support goal-directed actions
versus competing circuits, like DLS, that support habits (Gray-
biel, 2008; Gremel and Costa, 2013; Yin et al., 2004, 2005b,
2006). This led us to investigate potential endogenous mech-
anisms responsible for decreasing OFC transmission, thereby
reducing its impact on downstream brain areas and allowing
for habitual actions to emerge.
One candidate is the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabi-
noid signaling at cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) produces synaptic
plasticity in corticostriatal circuits that support action strategies
(Gerdeman et al., 2002). CB1 receptors are G protein-coupled
receptors that activate G proteins of the i of o subclass (Gi/o)
and are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory projection neu-
rons, as well as inhibitory interneurons within corticobasal
ganglia circuits controlling actions (Lovinger, 2010). CB1 recep-
tors are largely concentrated on both excitatory and inhibitory
presynaptic terminals where, upon activation, they reduce the
probability of neurotransmitter release (Kano et al., 2009). Previ-
ous work found that activation of the CB1 receptor by endocan-
nabinoids is necessary for habitual learning (Hila
´ rio et al., 2007)
and that chronic CB1 receptor activation biases toward the
use of habitual action strategies (Nazzaro et al., 2012). Therefore,
we hypothesized that CB1 receptor activation on OFC projection
neurons could be one of the mechanisms gating the shift from
goal-directed to habitual action control.
Through the use of Cre recombinase-enabled, cell-specific,
and circuit-specific viral approaches in transgenic mice (Fenno
et al., 2014), we identify an endogenous molecular mecha-
nism, in a specific cortical-striatal pathway, mediating the
transition between goal-directed and habitual action strate-
gies. By selectively deleting CB1 receptors in OFC projection
neurons, we identify a role for endocannabinoid modulation
of excitatory cortical output in the transition from goal-directed
to habitual control. We then show that activity of orbital frontal
cortex neurons projecting to dorsal striatum (OFC-DS), and
more specifically, transmission at OFC-DS terminals in stria-
tum, is necessary to maintain goal-directed control. Finally,
we show that selective deletion of CB1 receptors in OFC-DS
neurons is sufficient to block the emergence of habitual
behavior. Together, our findings suggest an endogenous
mechanism of action shifting, with endocannabinoid-mediated
inhibition of OFC-DS circuits allowing for the emergence of
habitual control.
RESULTS
To examine cell-type and circuit-specific control over action se-
lection, it is advantageous to examine goal-directed and habitual
actions concurrently in the same subject. We therefore used
a within-subject, self-paced, instrumental lever-press task that
we recently developed (Gremel and Costa, 2013), in which
mice readily perform the same action on a similar manipulandum
for the same reward using a goal-directed versus a habitual ac-
tion strategy (Figure 1). In this paradigm, we pair schedules of
reinforcement historically used to favor goal-directed or habitual
control, random ratio (RR) and random interval (RI), respectively
(Adams, 1982; Adams and Dickinson, 1981; Colwill and Re-
scorla, 1985; Dickinson, 1985), with a particular context. Each
day, mice are concurrently trained to press a similar lever in
the same location for the same reward (pellets or a 20% sucrose
solution) under RI and RR schedules. The other outcome is pro-
vided as a control in the home cage (i.e., is not contingent on
lever-press behavior). During training, these schedules produce
largely similar lever-pressing rates (ANOVA; main effect of day:
F8, 192 = 36.40, p < 0.001) (Figure 1B).
To probe the extent to which actions are controlled through
goal-directed processes, we conduct a sensory-specific satiety
outcome devaluation procedure across 2 days, termed valued
day and devalued day (Figure 1C). The valued day provides a
control for general effects that satiation may have on lever-press
behavior, when mice can prefeed on the home-cage outcome
that was not associated with a lever press. Outcome devaluation
occurs on the devalued day, when mice can prefeed on
the outcome previously earned by lever pressing, thereby
decreasing the motivation for that particular outcome. Each
day, following prefeeding, mice are placed in each training
context and non-rewarded lever pressing is measured. Goal-
directed control is sensitive to changes in motivation for the im-
mediate expected outcome, with habitual control less so.
Hence, the degree of goal-directedness is assessed through
the sensitivity of lever pressing to outcome devaluation (Adams,
1982; Adams and Dickinson, 1981; Colwill and Rescorla, 1985),
with a greater reduction in lever pressing in the devalued state
compared to the valued state indicative of greater goal-directed
action control (and no reduction indicative of habitual control).
Our within-subject task produces goal-directed and habitual
action control (Figure 1D). A two-way ANOVA revealed a signifi-
cant interaction between training context and day (F1, 22 =
10.92, p = 0.003); mice pressed less in the devalued versus the
valued state only in the RR context (Bonferroni corrected p <
0.01). Mice differentially distributing their lever presses between
valued and devalued states in the RR but not the RI training con-
texts (one-sample t test; RR: t11 = 7.27, p < 0.001) (Figure 1E).
There is a shift in the distribution of goal-directedness as
measured by a devaluation index [(Valued lever presses � Deval-
ued lever presses)/Total lever presses] (i.e., values closer to 1 are
indicative of greater goal-directedness) for each training context,
with individual mice showing greater goal-directedness in the RR
context than in the RI context (paired t test: t11 = 3.41, p = 0.005)
(Figure 1F). Hence, on the same day, mice can readily shift be-
tween goal-directed and habitual control over lever pressing
for the same outcome.

 Deletion of OFC CB1 Receptors Prevents Habitual
Control
We first examined the ability to shift between goal-directed and
habitual action control following deletion of CB1 receptors in
the OFC. We used a viral-vector approach to selectively delete
CB1 receptors from OFC neurons in adult mice. LoxP-flanked
CB1 transgenic mice (CB1flox) (Marsicano et al., 2003) and
their wild-type littermates were given stereotaxically guided intra-
cranial injections targeted to the lateral OFC of either AAV9-Ef1a-
Cre-eGFP for widespread Cre recombinase or AAV9-CamKIICre-
eGFP to specifically target OFC projection neurons (Figure 2A;
Figure S1). To confirm the presence or absence of CB1 receptors
in terminals of OFC projection neurons after these manipulations
(>4 weeks postsurgery), we included Cre-dependent channelrho-
dopsin (AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP) in some of the OFC injec-
tions and examined the ability of the CB1 agonist WIN55,212 to
reduce light-evoked excitatory transmission from OFC terminals
onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DS via whole-cell patch
clamp electrophysiology.
Consistent with previous findings showing extensive synaptic
connectivity between OFC and striatum in mice (Figure 2B) (Pan
et al., 2010; Wall et al., 2013), we detected optically evoked
excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) in MSNs in DS (Fig-
ure 2C). As expected, application of WIN55,212 reduced the
amplitude of oEPSPs in control mice (unpaired t test: t14 =
3.55, p = 0.003), with a one-sample t test against baseline
showing reduced relative EPSCs in control mice (t5 = 5.42, p =
0.003) (Figures 2C and 2D; Figure S1E), indicating intact CB1 re-
ceptor function in OFC presynaptic terminals. In contrast,
WIN55,212 did not reduce oEPSCs in virally injected CB1flox
mice (p > 0.05), confirming deletion of CB1 receptors from
OFC presynaptic terminals.
Adult control mice (wild-type littermates injected with virus),
CB1flox mice with CB1 receptors deleted from OFC neurons
(CB1floxCre), and CB1flox mice with CB1 receptors deleted
from OFC CamKII-expressing neurons (CB1floxCamKII Cre)
were trained to lever press for the same food reward under
both RI and RR schedules of reinforcement (Figure 2E). Deletion
of CB1 receptors from OFC neurons had a small effect on acqui-
sition of lever-press behavior; CB1floxCre mice and CB1floxCam-
KII Cre mice made slightly more lever presses as the RR require-
ment increased (Figure S2). CB1floxCre mice and CB1floxCamKII

Goal-Directed and Habitual Actions
(A) Acquisition schematic of lever pressing for a
food outcome under RI and RR schedules of
reinforcement. The same mouse is placed in suc-
cessive order, in two operant chambers distin-
guished by contextual cues. There, they are
trained to press the same lever (e.g., left lever) for
the same outcome (e.g., food pellets versus su-
crose solution). The bias toward goal-directed
actions is generated through use of RR schedules
of reinforcement, where the reinforcer is delivered
following on average the n lever press (2 days of
n = 10, followed by 4 days of n = 20). In contrast, RI
reinforcement schedules are used to bias toward
use of habitual actions, with the reinforcer deliv-
ered following the first lever press after, on
average, an interval of t has passed (2 days of t =
30 s, followed by 4 days of t = 60 s). Each day
following lever-press training, the other outcome
(e.g., sucrose) is provided in the home cage.

the lever press (e.g., food pellet). Following pre-
feeding, mice are placed into the RI and RR con-
texts, and lever presses are measured for 5 min in

 Cre mice were able to distinguish between RI and RR schedules,
as evidenced by maintained sensitivity to differential feedback
functions produced by each schedule (Figures S2G–S2I).
To evaluate the degree to which mice used the expected
outcome value to control decision-making, we performed an
outcome devaluation test. Control mice selectively reduced lever
pressing following outcome devaluation in the RR context but
not the RI context (Figure 2F). Repeated-measures ANOVA
showed a Context 3 Day interaction in control mice and reduced
responding on the devalued day only in the RR context (F1, 20 =
2.79, p = 0.05; Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05). In contrast,
CB1floxCre mice and CB1floxCamKII Cre mice made fewer lever
presses in the devalued compared to the valued state in previ-
ously trained RI and RR contexts (Figure 2F). A main effect of
day was observed in CB1floxCre mice (F1, 24 = 18.08, p =
0.0003) and CB1floxCamKII Cre mice (F1, 16 = 41,47, p <
0.0001), with reduced lever pressing in devalued versus valued
states in both RI and RR contexts (Bonferroni corrected p values
(ps0) < 0.05). Furthermore, a one-sample t test (against chance or
0.5) of normalized lever presses between valued and devalued
states in each training context showed that control mice were
only sensitive to devaluation in the RR context (RI: t10 = 0.82,
p = 0.43; RR: t10 = 2.67, p = 0.025). In contrast, CB1floxCre
mice and CB1floxCamKII Cre mice were sensitive to devaluation
in previously trained RI and RR contexts (CB1floxCre mice, RI:
t12 = 3.96, p = 0.002, and RR: t12 = 3.33, p = 0.006; CB1floxCamKII
Cre mice, RI: t8 = 3.96, p = 0.003, and RR: t8 = 9.83, p < 0.0001)
(Figure 2G).
Finally, to evaluate whether CB1 deletion altered the within-
subject shift in goal-directedness, we performed a paired t test
on the devaluation index for each group to compare the degree
to which each mouse was goal-directed in the RI versus the RR
context. Although all mice consumed similar amounts of food
during sensory-specific satiation procedures (Figure S2F), con-
trol mice tended to show greater sensitivity to outcome devalu-
ation in the RR than RI context (t20 = 2.36, p = 0.08) (Figure 2H). In
contrast, CB1floxCre mice and CB1floxCamKII Cre mice showed
similar sensitivity to outcome devaluation in both RI and RR con-
texts (CB1floxCre mice: t24 = 0.21, p = 0.83; CB1floxCamKII Cre
mice: t16 = 1.07, p = 0.30). These findings are in accordance

 with additional experiments using an inducible forebrain-specific
Cre-recombinase approach, which suggests a role for OFC CB1
receptors in shifting toward habitual action control (Figure S3).
Together, these data strongly suggest that deletion of CB1 re-
ceptors from OFC neurons, and specifically, CamKII-expressing
neurons in adulthood, prevents a shift to habitual action control
and renders mice reliant on goal-directed processes in both
contexts.
Attenuation of OFC-DS Projection Activity Results in
Habitual Control
We previously showed that efficacy of excitatory transmission
from OFC CamKII-expressing neurons to their targets maintains
goal-directed control, with chemogenetic inhibition of OFC pro-
jection neurons leaving mice reliant on habitual decision-making
processes (Gremel and Costa, 2013). However, OFC neurons
send projections widely across the cortex, striatum, and
midbrain areas (Hoover and Vertes, 2011; Pan et al., 2010; Schil-
man et al., 2008). Given dorsal-striatal involvement in goal-
directed and habitual actions, we first tested whether the activity
of OFC-DS neurons controls the shift from goal-directed to
habitual actions. We took a combined retrograde and chemoge-
netic viral approach to silence activity of OFC-DS neurons during
outcome devaluation (Armbruster et al., 2007; Fenno et al., 2014;
Stachniak et al., 2014; Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013). We selec-
tively expressed the inhibitory Gi-coupled human muscarinic 4
designer (hM4D) receptor in OFC-DS neurons and performed
outcome devaluation procedures in the presence of the selective
exogenous ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), thereby inhibiting
OFC-DS neurons.
Adult wild-type mice were injected with the retrograde herpes
simplex virus 1 carrying Cre recombinase (hEF1a-eYFP-IRES-
cre; HSV-1 Cre) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)
(hEF1a -EYFP-IRES; HSV-1 YFP) stereotaxically targeted to
the DMS, where we had previously observed OFC fiber tracts
and recorded oEPSCs in MSNs (Figure 3A; Figure S4). In the
same surgery, mice were given an injection of AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-
hM4D-mCherry into lateral OFC (Figure 3A). This combination
of viruses resulted in expression of hM4D only in OFC-DS (Fig-
ure 3C). We did not observe hM4D-induced mCherry fluores-
cence following hEF1a -EYFP-IRES control injections into
striatum (control mice) (Figure S4). We have previously shown
that CNO activation of hM4D receptors on OFC projection neu-
rons leads to a reduction in OFC activity in vivo (Gremel and
Costa, 2013). To verify that CNO activation of hM4D receptors
inhibited activity of OFC-DS neurons (Stachniak et al., 2014),
we performed whole-cell patch recordings of visually identified
hM4D-expressing OFC-DS neurons. We observed hyperpolar-
ization of OFC neurons with bath application of CNO (Fig-
ure S4D); CNO application blocked current-evoked action po-
tential firing, whereas vehicle application did not (Figures 3D
and 3E).
We trained control and OFC-DS hM4D mice on our within-
subject lever-press task. Following acquisition, we performed
the outcome devaluation procedure in the presence of CNO
(1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) (Figure 3B). Again, control mice
showed reduced responding in the devalued state in the RR
context but not the RI context (repeated-measures ANOVA,
Context 3 Day: F1,12 = 0.8, p = 0.37; preplanned paired t test,
RR: t12 = 2.44, p = 0.05) (Figure 3F). In contrast, OFC-DS
hM4D mice did not reduce responding in the devalued state in
either the RI or the RR context (F1, 18 = 0.98, p = 0.34; ps0 >
0.05). Furthermore, we found that while control mice differentially
distributed lever presses between valued and devalued states
only in the RR context (RI: t6 = 1.69, p = 0.14; RR: t6 = 5.00,
p = 0.002) (Figure 3G), OFC-DS hM4D mice showed similar
lever-press distributions in each context (RI: t9 = 0.11, p =
0.91; RR: t9 = 1.28, p = 0.23). We then examined whether
hM4D activation and silencing of OFC-DS altered the shift in
devaluation index between RI and RR contexts. We found that
while control mice were overall more goal-directed in the RR
than the RI training context, this was not the case for OFC-DS
hM4D mice (Figure 3H). A paired t test of devaluation indexes
in the RI versus the RR context revealed a significant shift in con-
trol mice (t12 = 2.33, p = 0.03) that was not present in OFC-DS
hM4D mice (t18 = 0.44, p = 0.66). The observed increase in the
overall level of lever pressing in OFC-DS hM4D mice (Figure 3F)
raises the possibility that increased locomotor activity interfered
with the ability to show outcome devaluation. Correlational ana-
lyses did not support this hypothesis (Figures S4E and S4F), nor
did CNO induce a general increase in locomotor activity in con-
trol or OFC-DS hM4D mice (Figure S4G).
However, because deep-layer cortical projection neurons
have collateral projections (Shepherd, 2013), systemic adminis-
tration of CNO could result in attenuated collateral activity of
OFC-DS neurons in other downstream terminal areas. To
directly examine the contribution of OFC terminals in the DS,
we infused CNO directly into the more medial DS before
outcome devaluation procedures. We implanted cannulae tar-
geted to the DMS in adult wild-type mice that had been previ-
ously injected with AAV5-Ef1a-Cre-eGFP into DS (Rothermel
et al., 2013) and AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-hM4D-mCherry into lateral
OFC (Figure 4C; Figure S4). Following recovery and subse-
quent lever-press training on RI and RR schedules, we micro-
injected CNO (300 mM; n = 6) or saline (n = 6) into the DS before
devaluation testing.
We found that the handling procedures associated with micro-
injections before devaluation testing were sufficient to disrupt
habitual control in saline-infused mice, with saline mice showing
strong goal-directed control over actions in both training con-
texts (ANOVA; no interaction, main effect of day: F1, 10 =
29.30, p < 0.001) (Figure 4D). Despite this disruption, intra-DS in-
fusions of CNO resulted in strong habitual control in both RI and
RR training contexts (no interaction, no main effects: ps0 > 0.05).
Control mice differentially distributed their lever presses be-
tween valued and devalued states in both RI and RR contexts
(RI: t5 = 22.82, p < 0.001; RR: t5 = 15.18, p < 0.001), whereas
CNO-treated mice did not (RI: t5 = 1.46, p > 0.05; RR: t5 =
1.07, p > 0.05) (Figure 4E). Neither group showed a shift in deval-
uation index (ps0 > 0.05) (Figure 4F). A planned comparison per-
formed on devaluation indexes between groups revealed greater
goal-directedness in the saline- versus CNO-treated mice (main
effect of treatment group: F1, 10 = 26.58, p < 0.01). Hence, saline
mice were goal-directed, while CNO-induced attenuation of
OFC-DS transmission left mice reliant on habitual strategies to
control lever pressing.

Neuron 90, 1312–1324, June 15, 2016
 The lack of goal-directed control following CNO treatment is
not explained by disrupted response inhibition, because in a
separate test, systemic CNO treatment did not prevent satiety-
induced responding reduction in an open-ended fixed ratio
schedule (Figures S4J–S4L). Instead, our findings are in line
with reports of alterations in OFC-DS activity in repetitive action
pathologies, such as OCD (Burguie
` re et al., 2013) and alterations
that may underlie previous reports relating habitual responding
and OCD (Gillan et al., 2011). Together, they suggest that
hM4D activation and subsequent attenuation of OFC-DS neuron
transmission selectively disrupt the ability for goal-directed stra-
tegies to control lever-press responding.
CB1 Receptor-Mediated Attenuation of OFC-DS Activity
Is Critical for Habitual Control
The previous data suggested that activity of OFC-DS neurons
is critical for goal-directed behavior. We therefore reasoned
that attenuation of transmission in this pathway via CB1 recep-
tor activation could be critical for habit formation. We next
investigated whether endogenous CB1 receptor activation
and subsequent reduction in glutamate release from OFC-DS
neurons was necessary for the shift from goal-directed to
habitual action control. We used a site-specific targeted combi-
natorial viral approach (Fenno et al., 2014) in transgenic mice
to selectively delete CB1 receptors in only OFC-DS. CB1flox
mice and their wild-type littermates were injected with a retro-
grade virus carrying flipase hEF1a-eYFP-IRES-flp (HSV-1 fp)
targeted to the same DMS region of observed OFC-DS con-
nections (Figure 5A; Figure S5). In the same surgery, we stereo-
taxically injected AAV8-Ef1a-FD-mCherry-p2A-Cre targeted to
the lateral OFC, with Cre recombinase dependent on the pres-
ence of flipase (adeno-associated virus [AAV] fp-Cre). The aim
of this site-specific viral targeting was to limit Cre-recombinase
expression to OFC-DS neurons and CB1 deletion in OFC-DS

 neurons of CB1flox mice (OFC-DS CB1flox) but not in wild-type
littermates (control). We included AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP
(AAV DIO ChR2) to functionally assess CB1 receptor deletion
(Figures 5A and 5B). We were able to reliably measure light-
evoked changes in membrane potential of OFC somata (Fig-
ure
5C),
indicating
successful
Cre-recombinase
activity.
Although more challenging due to the relative sparseness of
terminals, we were able to perform whole-cell patch recordings
and evoke oEPSCs in a subset of MSNs from wild-type
control and CB1flox mice (Figure 5E). WIN55,212 reduced
the amplitude of oEPSCs in wild-type but not CB1flox mice (Fig-
ures 5E and 5F). These data suggest that our site-specific tar-
geted combinatorial viral approach in transgenic mice was
successful at deleting CB1 receptors in terminals of OFC-DS
neurons.
Deletion of CB1 receptors from OFC-DS neurons did not alter
acquisition of lever-press behavior under RI or RR reinforcement
schedules, and mice were able to distinguish between sched-
ules (Figure S5). During outcome devaluation procedures, con-
trol mice showed reduced lever pressing in the devalued state
in the RR context but not the RI context (repeated-measures
ANOVA; Context 3 Day: F1, 12 = 5.47, p = 0.04; Bonferroni cor-
rected ps0 < 0.05) (Figure 5G). However, OFC-DS CB1flox mice
reduced lever pressing in both RI and RR contexts in the deval-
ued state (no interaction, main effect of day: F1, 18 = 29.72, p <
0.0001; Bonferroni corrected ps0 < 0.05). Furthermore, OFC-DS
CB1flox mice differentially distributed their lever pressing be-
tween valued and devalued states in both RI and RR contexts
(RI: t12 = 6.14, p < 0.0001; RR: t12 = 2.45, p < 0.05) (Figure 5H).

 (RI: t7 = 1.3, p = 0.24; RR: t7 = 3.45, p = 0.011). Finally, control
mice increased their devaluation index between RI and RR con-
texts (t14 = 2.11, p = 0.05) (Figure 5I), indicative of a shift in the
degree of goal-directedness; OFC-DS CB1flox mice did not
show such a shift (t20 = 0.49, p = 0.63). This suggests that
habitual action control involves CB1 receptor-mediated inhibi-
tion of the OFC-DS circuit that supports goal-directed actions.
DISCUSSION
The data presented in this study uncover a novel mechanism for
shifting toward habitual control. Our results show that competi-
tion between DMS and DLS circuits supporting goal-directed
and habitual action, respectively, is strongly influenced by the
gating of incoming transmission from OFC. By targeting molec-
ular mechanisms in a cell-type, circuit-specific, and projection-
specific manner, we identify an endogenous mechanism that un-
derlies gating shifts between goal-directed and habitual action
control in the same subject.
In the same mouse, we were able to examine the loss of goal-
directed action control in one context while goal-directed control
was intact in the remaining context. We used differing schedules
of reinforcement to bias differential action control. The different
RI and RR schedules we used to bias different action-control

 strategies do not produce differences in the macrostructure or
microstructure of lever pressing or in the rate across a session
(i.e., interval-induced scalloping of lever pressing) (Gremel
and Costa, 2013). This within-subject approach to investigate
habitual action control differs from that of an extending training
approach. In some circumstances (Colwill and Rescorla, 1985),
extensive experience with the action-outcome relationship
through an extending training approach shifts the control of a
subject’s responding from initial goal-directed control to habitual
control (Dickinson, 1985). Hence, in the within-subject proce-
dure used in the current experiments, it is not the animal that is
habitual or goal-directed; it is the action control within a partic-
ular context that is habitual or goal-directed (Figure 1). Although
there may be subtle differences, habitual control biased through
use of both extended training or RI schedules recruits the DLS
(Barnes et al., 2005; Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009; Gremel and Costa,
2013; Hilario et al., 2012; Smith and Graybiel, 2013; Thorn et al.,
2010; Yin et al., 2004, 2006; Yin and Knowlton, 2006), whereas
goal-directed control biased through the use of RR depends
on the DMS (Barnes et al., 2005; Dias-Ferreira et al., 2009; Gre-
mel and Costa, 2013; Hilario et al., 2012; Smith and Graybiel,
2013; Thorn et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006;
Yin and Knowlton, 2006). Using this within-subject procedure,
we took a chemogenetic approach to inhibit the activity of
OFC-DS neurons and found that inhibition of OFC-DS activity
via activation of the Gi/o-coupled hM4D receptor specifically dur-
ing probe test sessions left the subject reliant on habit circuitry,
whereas goal-directed circuits are normally favored (Figure 3).
Furthermore, specific attenuation of transmission at OFC termi-
nals in DS prevented use of goal-directed strategies for action
control (Figure 4). This suggests that increasing Gi/o modulation
at OFC terminals in DS contributes to the emergence of habitual
action control. Whether this mechanism is also responsible for
the shift to habitual control following extended training remains
to be investigated.
Previous work had implicated an endogenous Gi/o-coupled re-
ceptor, the CB1 receptor, in habitual action control (Hila
´ rio et al.,
2007). Strikingly, CB1 receptor antagonism during acquisition
alone prevented use of habitual action control. This suggests
that CB1 receptors are important for the learning-induced plas-
ticity that is necessary for habitual control. Given the widespread
expression and increasing gradient of CB1 found in medial to
lateral striatum (Kano et al., 2009), it seemed likely that CB1 re-
ceptor modulation of habitual control occurred through actions
in corticostriatal circuits. Most CB1 receptors are found on pre-
synaptic inhibitory synapses within striatum (Ma
´ tya
´ s et al., 2006;
Uchigashima et al., 2007). The expression on these terminals
likely accounts for the higher levels of expression in DLS than
in DMS. However, CB1 receptors are also found on cortical pro-
jections into striatum, where they are localized to terminals
(Uchigashima et al., 2007), and endocannabinoids are released
postsynaptically in an activity-dependent manner (Gerdeman
et al., 2002; Uchigashima et al., 2007). These endocannabinoids
bind CB1 receptors presynaptically to serve as a powerful modu-
lator of glutamate release (Gerdeman and Lovinger, 2001). We
targeted these corticostriatal CB1 receptors and found that prior
to training, the specific deletion of CB1 receptors in OFC neu-
rons, and in particular OFC-DS neurons, resulted in a loss of
habitual action control (Figures 2 and 5). Together, our data
suggest that habitual control over an action strategy depends
on Gi/o-coupled receptor-mediated attenuation of a competing
circuit controlling goal-directed behaviors.
The existence of parallel associative and sensorimotor circuits
that control disparate action strategies suggests that perturba-
tions to those controlling goal-directed strategies may result in
an abnormal reliance on habit circuitry. The reported reduction
in task-induced activation of OFC-DS circuits (Remijnse et al.,
2006) and the greater reliance on habitual processes (Gillan
et al., 2011) observed in OCD patients raise the hypothesis
that a pathology involving reduced activity of OFC-DS circuits
is present with OCD. In a genetic mouse model of OCD, an
acute increase in transmission specifically at OFC-DS terminals
reduced compulsive grooming behavior (Burguie
` re et al., 2013).
In addition, chronic stimulation of OFC inputs into striatum re-
sulted in development of a repetitive grooming pathology in
wild-type mice (Ahmari et al., 2013). Furthermore, both clinical
and preclinical work have implicated dysfunction of OFC circuits
in addiction disorders (Goldstein and Volkow, 2011; Schoen-
baum and Shaham, 2008) that involve impaired decision-mak-
ing. Chronic administration of the main psychoactive ingredient
in cannabis, D9-THC, also biases toward use of habitual strate-
gies, and chronic D9-THC, as well as alcohol exposure, disrupts
endocannabinoid modulation in DS (DePoy et al., 2013; Nazzaro
et al., 2012). Thus, loss of endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity
in OFC-DS circuits could contribute to addiction (Belin et al.,
2013; Goldstein and Volkow, 2011) and OCD (Burguie
` re et al.,
2015; Gillan et al., 2011). We also observed increased response
(lever pressing) rates following attenuation of OFC-DS neuron
activity via Gi/o-coupled hM4D receptor activation and following
deletion of CB1 receptors from OFC-DS neurons that were inde-
pendent of any effects on outcome devaluation. While the
increased response rates may reflect a lack of competition be-
tween circuits, they cannot contribute to action control; we found
that Gi/o-coupled hM4D receptor activation led to habitual con-
trol, while CB1 deletion from OFC-DS neurons led to loss of
habitual control. Furthermore, the observed increased response
rates are not due to lack of inhibitory control, because both show
sensitivity to satiety. Our studies do suggest OFC-DS circuits un-
derlie a critical component of action control that is disturbed in
disorders affecting decision-making control over actions.
With
an
impaired
habit-breaking
phenotype
present
in
numerous psychiatric disorders (Griffiths et al., 2014), and wide-
spread use of the abused drugs in the general populace, our
findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of the endocannabi-
noid system is a viable option for restoration of goal-directed
control.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the University
of California San Diego, and performed in accordance with NIH guidelines.
Gene-targeted mice Cnr1loxP/loxP were obtained (Marsicano et al., 2003) and
bred in-house. Male and female mice were housed in groups of one to four,
with mouse chow and water ad libitum unless stated otherwise, and were
kept on a 12 hr or 14/10 hr light/dark cycle. All surgical, electrophysiological,
andbehavioralexperimentswere performedduring thelight portion of thecycle.

 Deletion of CB1 Receptor from OFC Neurons
Adult CB1flox mice and their wild-type littermates were given stereotaxically
guided intracranial injections targeted at the OFC (anterior [A], 2.70 mm;
medial [M], ±1.75 or 1.65 mm; ventral [V]: �2.25 mm; Bregma) of either
AAV9-Cre-eGFP or AAV9-CamKIICre-eGFP (200 nL per side), along with
AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (100 nL per side; University of Pennsylvania vector
core). At least 4 weeks following viral injection, mice were trained on the
within-subject instrumental task or were used for whole-cell patch clamp
physiology. Virus spread in each mouse put through behavioral procedures
was examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus MVX10); mice
with fluorescence outside the OFC inclusion area were excluded from the
final data analyses (n = 9). Final group numbers from a total of three repli-
cates are as follows: control, n = 12; CB1floxCre, n = 13; and CB1floxCamKII
Cre, n = 9.
Chemogenetic Inhibition of OFC-DS Neurons
C57BL/6J mice each received two bilateral injections, one targeting the DS
and the other the OFC. In one experiment, hEF1a-eYFP-IRES-cre or hEF1a
-EYFP-IRES (Massachusetts Institute of Technology [MIT] vector core) was
injected into the DS (300 nL/side; A, 0.5 mm; M, ±1.25 mm; V, �3.25 mm;
Bregma), and AAV5-DIO-hM4D-mCherry was injected into the OFC (200
nL/side; coordinates same as earlier; Gene Therapy Vector Core at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina). In a second experiment, mice were given an infu-
sion of AAV5-Cre-GFP (200 nL; Gene Therapy Vector Core at the University
of North Carolina) into the DS and AAV5-DIO-hM4D-mCherry (200 nL) into
OFC. These mice were also implanted with bilateral cannulae (Plastics One)
targeted to the DS (A, 0.5 mm; M, ±1.25 mm; V, �2.75 mm; Bregma).
Following at least 4 weeks of recovery, mice were trained in the within-sub-
ject task. In experiments with systemic CNO administration, each day
60 min before devaluation testing, mice were given an intraperitoneal injec-
tion of CNO (1 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg). The mice with cannulae were lightly anes-
thetized, dummy cannulae were removed, and injectors targeting DS
(�3.25 mm) were lowered. Then, 15–30 min before the onset of the deval-
uation procedure, mice were give 300 nL intracranial injections of either
0.9% isotonic saline or CNO (300 mM) at a rate of 100 nL/min. Following
devaluation testing, these mice also underwent an additional lever-
press test. Mice were pretreated (15 min) with systemic saline or CNO
(1 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) before access to the previously earned outcome on
a fixed ratio of 8. To confirm successful viral infection and expression of
hM4D receptors, a subset of injected mice were euthanized and whole-
cell patch clamp recordings were used to verify CNO-induced suppression
of OFC-DS neuronal activity. Viral spread was observed under a fluores-
cence microscope (Olympus MVX10), and mice with no expression or sig-
nificant expression outside of OFC inclusion boundaries (n = 5) or with mis-
placed cannulae or infection at the site of intracranial injection (CNO
treated, n = 4; saline treated, n = 3) were excluded. The final group numbers
from two systemic replicates are as follows: control, n = 7, and hM4D, n =
10. The final group numbers from one intracranial replicate are as follows:
saline treated, n = 6, and CNO treated, n = 6.
Deletion of CB1 Receptors from OFC-DS Neurons
To selectively delete CB1 receptors in OFC-DS neurons in adult mice, we bilat-
erally injected CB1flox and wild-type littermates with hEF1a-eYFP-IRES-flpo
(300 nL/side; MIT vector core) into DS, and AAV8-Ef1a-FD-mCherry-p2A-
Cre (200 nL per side; courtesy of Dr. Deisseroth, Stanford University) and
AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (100 nL/side; University of Pennsylvania Vector Core)
into OFC. At least 6 weeks following viral injection, mice were trained on the
within-subject procedure. Histological examination was done to confirm viral
expression, and mice with no mCherry/YFP expression were excluded from
the final behavioral analyses (n = 9). A subset of mice was used for ex vivo
physiological assessment via whole-cell patch clamp. Final behavioral group
numbers from two replicates are as follows: control, n = 7, and OFC-DS
CB1flox, n = 10.
Lever-Press Training
All behavioral training and testing took place as previously described (Gremel
and Costa, 2013). In brief, mice were placed in operant chambers in sound
attenuating boxes (Med-Associates) in which they pressed a single lever (left
or right) in a self-paced manner for an outcome of either regular chow pellets
(20 mg pellet per reinforcer, Bio-Serve formula F05684) or sucrose solution
(20–30 mL of 20% solution per reinforcer). The other outcome was provided
later in their home cage and used as a control for general satiation in the
outcome devaluation test. Before training commenced, mice were food
restricted to 90% of their baseline weight; they were maintained at this lower
weight for the duration of experimental procedures.
Training was conducted as follows. Each day, each mouse was trained in
two separate operant chambers distinguished by contextual cues (i.e.,
black-and-white, vertical-striped, laminated paper in 3.2-mm-wide stripes
on chamber walls or clear plexiglass chamber walls). Upon completion of
training in one context, mice were immediately trained in the remaining
context. For each mouse, the order of schedule exposure, lever position,
and outcome obtained upon lever pressing were kept constant across con-
texts. However, the context, schedule order, lever position, and outcome
earned were counterbalanced across mice. Each training session commenced
with illumination of the house light and lever extension and ended following
schedule completion or after 60 min, with the lever retracting and the house
light turning off.
On the first day, mice were trained to approach the food magazine (no
lever present) in each context on a random time (RT) schedule, with a rein-
forcer delivered on average every 60 s for a total of 15 min. Next, mice were
trained in each context on a continuous reinforcement schedule (contin-
uous ratio of reinforcement [CRF] or fixed ratio 1 [FR1]), where every lever
press was reinforced, with the possible number of earned reinforcers
increasing across training days (CRF5, CRF15, and CRF30). In the absence
of any predictive cue signaling reward delivery, mice acquired lever-press
behavior within 3 days. After acquiring lever-press behavior, mice were
trained on RI and RR schedules of reinforcement (Adams, 1982; Derusso
et al., 2010), with schedules differentiated by context and the session
ending in each context after 15 reinforcers were earned or after 60 min
had elapsed. Mice initially pressed under RI30 (on average, one reinforcer
following the first press after an average of 30 s) and RR10 (on average,
one reinforcer every 10 lever presses) schedules for 2 days, followed by
4 days of RI60 and RR20 training.
Outcome devaluation testing occurred across 2 consecutive days. In brief,
on the valued day, mice had ad libitum access to the home-cage outcome
for 1 hr before serial, brief, non-reinforced test sessions in the previous RI
and RR training contexts. On the devalued day, mice were given 1 hr ad libitum
access to the outcome previously earned by lever press and then underwent
serial, non-reinforced test sessions in each training context. Prefeeding took
place in a cage separate from the one in which mice were previously habitu-
ated, and the amount consumed was recorded. Order of context exposure
during testing was the same as training exposure, with order of devaluation
day counterbalanced across mice. Tests in each context were 5 min in
duration.
A subset of mice was given an additional probe lever-press test following
outcome devaluation testing. Food-restricted mice were pretreated (15 min)
with CNO (n = 6) or saline (n = 6) and then placed in the first of the
previously trained operant contexts (counterbalanced across RI and RR
within each treatment group). Mice had access to the training lever, but
the reinforcement schedule was a fixed ratio of 8 (every eighth lever press
produced the outcome). Mice could earn unlimited reward within a 1 hr
period. Lever presses, reward earned, and head entry behavior was
analyzed.
Locomotor Activity in a Novel Cage
Control and hM4D mice were injected with CNO (1 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) and
placed in a novel polycarbonate cage for 60 min. Horizontal activity was de-
tected as infrared beam crosses (1 inch spacing, 10 beams per cage) within
10 s bins using Opto M3 activity monitors (Columbus Instruments). Once the
trial was over, mice were immediately returned to their home cage.
Slice Preparation and Electrophysiology
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were
removed and placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing: 194 mM
Neuron 90, 1312–1324, June 15, 2016
1321
 sucrose, 30 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, and
10 mM glucose. Coronal brain slices containing the OFC or DS, 250 mm
thick, were obtained using a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT1200S)
and recovered in aerated artificial cerebrospinal fluid [ACSF] containing
124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM
NaH2PO4, 10 mM D-glucose, and 2 mM CaCl2 at 32�C for 30 min. Slices
were then placed at room temperature until experimental use. Whole-cell
patch clamp recordings were performed between 30�C and 32�C ± 1�C
(with control by an automatic temperature controller, Warner Instruments).
Neurons in slices were visualized with an upright microscope using a 403
(0.8 numerical aperture) water immersion objective. Real-time images were
displayed on a video monitor, which aided navigation and placement of
recording pipettes. Then, 2–4 MU patch pipettes were pulled from borosil-
icate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.86 mm inner diameter;
World Precision Instruments) and filled with internal solution. Two internal
solutions were used. The K-based internal contained 126 mM K-gluconate,
4 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-guanosine triphos-
phate (GTP), and 10 mM phosphocreatine. The Cs-based internal con-
tained 150 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 mM Mg-ATP,
0.3 mM Na-GTP, and 0.2 mM 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N0,N0-
tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-4Cs. Recordings were made using a Multiclamp
700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Membrane currents were filtered at 2
kHz, digitized using a Digidata 1322A at 10 kHz, displayed and saved using
Clampex v.9.2, and analyzed with Clampfit v.9.2 (Molecular Devices). Sta-
tistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software). To isolate EPSCs, picrotoxin (100 mM; Sigma) was added to the
extracellular solution. Series resistance was less than 25 MU, and cells with
changes of more than 20% were excluded. A 10 min application of
WIN55,212 (1 mM) was used to examine presence or absence of CB1-medi-
ated synaptic depression. For optoactivation experiments, oEPSCs in
MSNs and oEPSPs in OFC neurons were evoked in brain slices using
470 nm blue light (5 ms exposure time) delivered via field illumination using
a high-power light-emitting diode (LED) source (LED4D067, Thor Labs).
Light intensity was adjusted to produce oEPSCs with magnitude of 100–
400 pA (<100 mW). The oEPSCs were evoked once per minute. Imaging
of brain slices was performed using an Olympus MVX10 microscope
(Olympus Corporation of America).
Statistical Analyses
The a level was set at 0.05 for all analyses unless indicated otherwise. Initial
analyses showed normal distributions for all behavioral data. For all behav-
ioral analyses, lever presses, lever-press rate, reward earned, and head
entries were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, with post hoc ana-
lyses performed using Bonferroni-corrected paired t tests where appropriate.
For outcome devaluation testing analyses, two-way ANOVA (Devaluation
state 3 Schedule) within each group was used to evaluate differences in
lever-press and consumption behavior, with post hoc analyses performed
using Bonferroni-corrected paired t tests where appropriate. To investigate
the within-subject distribution of lever presses between valued and devalued
states, we normalized lever presses for valued and devalued states to total
lever pressing (Valued + Devalued) in each context. We then conducted
planned one-sample t tests for normalized data to examine whether each
condition differed from chance (0.5)—that is, the distribution of lever presses
between valued and devalued states for each schedule observed in normal-
ized data, with a value of 0.5 reflecting the same level of lever pressing be-
tween valued and devalued states. In addition, we examined the magnitude
of outcome devaluation by creating a devaluation index [(Valued lever
presses � Devalued lever presses)/Total lever presses] for each mouse in
the RR and the RI contexts. We then conducted paired t tests to examine
differences in the magnitude of devaluation between RI and RR contexts
for each group of mice. For slice experiments, ten optically evoked EPSCs
recorded before WIN administration were averaged to calculate the baseline
amplitude, and ten oEPSCs recorded 10 min following the completion of
drug application were averaged to determine the postdrug amplitude. Post-
drug amplitudes were normalized to predrug amplitudes, and an unpaired
Student’s t test of the normalized amplitudes from wild-type and CB1flox an-
imals was performed.
