In Brief
The Zika virus epidemic has brought an
urgent need for animal models. Lazear
et al. describe a mouse model for Zika
virus. Mice lacking interferon a/b
signaling develop neurological disease
and succumb to infection with high viral
loads in the brain, spinal cord, and testes,
consistent with severe manifestations of
Zika virus in humans.

SUMMARY
The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic and unex-
pected clinical outcomes, including Guillain-Barre
´
syndrome and birth defects, has brought an urgent
need for animal models. We evaluated infection and
pathogenesis
with
contemporary
and
historical
ZIKV strains in immunocompetent mice and mice
lacking components of the antiviral response. Four-
to six-week-old Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� triple knockout
mice, which produce little interferon a/b, and mice
lacking the interferon receptor (Ifnar1�/�) developed
neurological disease and succumbed to ZIKV infec-
tion, whereas single Irf3�/�, Irf5�/�, and Mavs�/�
knockout mice exhibited no overt illness. Ifnar1�/�
mice sustained high viral loads in the brain and spinal
cord, consistent with evidence that ZIKV causes neu-
rodevelopmental defects in human fetuses. The
testes of Ifnar1�/� mice had the highest viral loads,
which is relevant to sexual transmission of ZIKV.
This model of ZIKV pathogenesis will be valuable
for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics as well as
understanding disease pathogenesis.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviri-
dae family, which includes globally relevant arthropod-trans-
mitted human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever
(YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and tick-
borne encephalitis viruses (Lazear and Diamond, 2016; Pierson
and Diamond, 2013). Within the mosquito-borne clade of
flaviviruses, ZIKV is a member of the Spondweni group; both
genetically and serologically, ZIKV is related closely to the four
serotypes of DENV with approximately 43% amino acid identity
and extensive antibody cross-reactivity (Alkan et al., 2015; Lan-
ciotti et al., 2008).
The first strain of ZIKV (MR 766) was isolated in 1947 from a
febrile sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest near Entebbe,
Uganda after intracerebral passage in Swiss albino mice (Dick,
1952; Dick et al., 1952). In the decades following its discovery,
ZIKV was isolated from human patients sporadically during out-
breaks in Africa and Southeast Asia (Haddow et al., 2012; Hayes,
2009), but remained obscure due to the fairly benign nature of the
infection (Lazear and Diamond, 2016). Typically, ZIKV infection
has been associated with a self-limiting febrile illness often
including rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, though most infec-
tions are asymptomatic (Brasil et al., 2016; Duffy et al., 2009;
Hayes, 2009). Despite the mild disease historically associated
with ZIKV infection, more severe complications have been noted
during recent outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America.
The first association between ZIKV infection and neurological
disorders occurred during the 2013–2014 ZIKV outbreak in
French Polynesia (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2014), which was associ-
ated with a 20-fold increase in cases of Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome
(GBS) (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Oehler et al., 2014). GBS is a
post-infection autoimmune peripheral neuropathy that can pro-
duce pain, weakness, and paralysis; although GBS usually is
temporary, GBS-induced respiratory paralysis can be fatal (Wil-
lison et al., 2016). In support of a causal link between ZIKV and
GBS, the emergence of ZIKV in the western hemisphere in
2015–2016 has been associated temporally with increased
numbers of GBS cases in Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia (Eu-
ropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2016).
During the current epidemic in Latin America, ZIKV infection
has been linked to the development of severe fetal abnormalities
that include spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, hydranencephaly,
microcephaly, and placental insufficiency that may cause intra-
uterine growth restriction (Brasil et al., 2016; Sarno et al., 2016;
Ventura et al., 2016). Furthermore, a retrospective analysis iden-
tified an increase in microcephaly cases during the 2013–2014
ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia (Cauchemez et al., 2016).
Several cases of presumed intrauterine ZIKV infection resulted
in coarse cerebral calcifications in different brain regions of
newborn infants or fetuses in utero (Oliveira Melo et al., 2016).
The reported congenital malformation cases may represent
only the most severe end of the spectrum, with less severe infec-
tion producing long-term cognitive or functional sequelae.
Indeed, ocular findings in infants with presumed ZIKV-associ-
ated microcephaly were reported recently (de Paula Freitas
et al., 2016). While much remains to be determined about the
mechanisms by which ZIKV mediates microcephaly and other
birth defects, mounting molecular and immunologic evidence
supports the conclusion that ZIKV can cross the placenta and
damage a developing fetus. This evidence includes detection
720

 of ZIKV RNA, full-length viral genome, or viral particles in the
amniotic fluid or brains of fetuses diagnosed with microcephaly,
as well as ZIKV IgM in amniotic fluid, consistent with fetal infec-
tion (Calvet et al., 2016; Martines et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016;
Oliveira Melo et al., 2016; Petersen et al., 2016).
Little is known about the cellular and tissue tropism of ZIKV,
but keratinocytes and dendritic cells in the skin likely represent
early targets of infection, similar to other flaviviruses (Hamel
et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2011; Limon-Flores et al., 2005; Surasom-
batpattana et al., 2011), and ZIKV can infect human skin explants
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in culture (Hamel et al.,
2015). Evidence from infants and fetuses infected in utero sug-
gests ZIKV may be neurotropic (Mlakar et al., 2016; Sarno
et al., 2016), and a recent report demonstrated ZIKV infection
in human neuroprogenitor cells in culture (Tang et al., 2016).
Vaccinesand therapeuticsareneededurgentlytocombatZIKV,
and testing would be expedited by animal models of the different
manifestationsofdisease. MultiplemonkeyspeciesintheZikafor-
est were found to be seropositive for ZIKV (McCrae and Kirya,
1982), suggesting they can become infected and support viral
replication. Other mammals in the Zika forest (including squirrels,
tree rats, giant pouched rats, and civets) did not show serological
evidence of ZIKV infection (Haddow et al., 1964), though a subse-
quent study in Kenya detected ZIKV antibodies in small mammals
including rats and shrews (Johnson et al., 1977). In response to the
ongoingepidemic,newZIKVstudieshavebeeninitiatedinanimals
including
rhesus
macaques
(https://zika.labkey.com/project/
OConnor/ZIKV-001/begin.view).
Untilvery recently, few studieshadbeen performed inmice (Bell
et al., 1971; Dick, 1952; Way et al., 1976). Although these early
studies suggested that ZIKV can replicate and cause injury in cells
of the central nervous system (CNS), it is uncertain whether this
pathogenesis is related to ZIKV-induced neurodevelopmental
defects or GBS in humans. Moreover, these studies used the pro-
totype MR 766 strain of ZIKV, which had undergone extensive
passage in suckling mouse brains, and to date no experiments
have been reported in mice with more contemporary ZIKV isolates
of greater clinical relevance. To address this fundamental gap in
knowledge, we evaluated ZIKV infection and disease in wild-
type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, as well as a large panel of immune-defi-
cient transgenic mice, using several strains of ZIKV including a
contemporary clinical isolate. Whereas 4- to 6-week-old WT
mice did not develop clinically apparent disease, mice lacking
interferon a/b (IFN-a/b) signaling (i.e., Ifnar1�/� or Irf3�/� Irf5�/�
Irf7�/� triple knockout [TKO] mice) succumbed to infection with
different ZIKV strains. Viral burden analysis revealed that Ifnar1�/�
but not WT mice sustained high levels of ZIKV in all tissues tested,
including serum, spleen, brain, spinal cord, and testes. Our
studies establish a mouse model of ZIKV pathogenesis with
contemporary and historical virus strains that will be valuable for
evaluating candidate vaccines and therapeutics as well as under-
standing the basic biology of ZIKV infection and disease.
RESULTS
Susceptibility of Immunocompetent and
Immunodeficient Mice to ZIKV
Small animal models of ZIKV pathogenesis are a key research
priority in response to the ZIKV epidemic in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Historical studies indicated that mice could be in-
fected with ZIKV via intracerebral inoculation, but determining
mechanisms of pathogenesis and evaluating candidate antivirals
and vaccines requires more clinically relevant inoculation routes
and validation with contemporary ZIKV strains. We tested 5- to
6-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice as well as congenic transgenic
mice lacking key components of innate antiviral immunity
(Ifnar1�/�, Mavs�/�, Irf3�/�, Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO) for sus-
ceptibility to disease induced by a contemporary human isolate
of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) from French Polynesia, as well as the orig-
inal ZIKV strain, MR 766 (Figures 1A–1D). Ifnar1�/� mice (which
cannot respond to IFN-a/b) and Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO mice
(which produce almost no IFN-a/b) (Lazear et al., 2013) were
highly vulnerable to ZIKV infection. Both strains of mice began
to lose weight by 5 days after infection, and by day 7, when
they began to succumb to infection, they had lost between
15% and 25% of their starting body weight. Ifnar1�/� and Irf3�/�
Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO mice both exhibited 100% lethality by 10 days
after infection with ZIKV (H/PF/2013). Ifnar1�/� and Irf3�/� Irf5�/�
Irf7�/� TKO mice all developed neurological disease signs
including hindlimb weakness and paralysis before succumbing
to the infection (Figures 2A and 2B). In comparison, WT mice
or those lacking the signaling adaptor MAVS or the transcription
factor IRF-3 (both of which play key roles in IFN-a/b induction)
exhibited no weight loss, morbidity, or mortality. We saw a
similar pattern of ZIKV susceptibility when WT, Ifnar1�/�, and
Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO mice were infected via an intravenous
route, rather than a subcutaneous one (Figures 1E and 1F and
Figure 2C).
Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO mice were more susceptible to ZIKV
infection than Ifnar1�/� mice following intravenous inoculation
(p < 0.05 for H/PF/2013, p < 0.001 for MR 766), which suggests
a possible role for IRF-3-dependent, IFN-a/b-independent re-
striction mechanisms (Lazear et al., 2013). ZIKV H/PF/2013
was more pathogenic than the original Ugandan strain, as 20%
or 60% of Ifnar1�/� mice survived infection with MR 766 (by sub-
cutaneous or intravenous inoculation, respectively) compared to
100% lethality after H/PF/2013 infection (p < 0.001 for subcu-
taneous, p < 0.0001 for intravenous).
Although Ifnar1�/� and Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO mice can be
used as models to evaluate, for example, activity of candidate
antivirals against ZIKV in vivo, there are limitations to pathogen-
esis studies in mice lacking a critical component of innate anti-
viral immunity. We selected three additional ZIKV strains
for further characterization and corroboration: Dakar 41671,
41667, and 41519. These viruses were isolated in the 1980s
from mosquitoes in the same area of Senegal. We evaluated
different infection conditions (i.e., viral strain, inoculation route,
mouse age, or mouse genotype) with the goal of identifying a
more immunocompetent mouse system that was susceptible
to ZIKV disease (Table 1). None of these conditions resulted in
lethal ZIKV disease in an adult mouse, though larger group sizes
would be necessary to detect infrequent disease presentations.
In addition to WT and Ifnar1�/� mice, we evaluated infection
in CD-1 mice (an outbred mouse line) and Irf5�/� mice, infecting
4-week-old mice with 103 focus-forming units (FFU) of each of
the
ZIKV
strains
from
Senegal.
Whereas
Ifnar1�/�
mice
lost weight rapidly and succumbed to the infection within
1 week, we observed no weight loss or mortality in WT, CD-1,
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 720–730, May 11, 2016
721
 or Irf5�/� mice (Figures 3A–3C). However, when we infected
suckling WT mice (1 week old), we observed susceptibility to
infection, with 5 of 15 mice succumbing within 24 days (Fig-
ure 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that although
ZIKV can cause disease in WT mice, it does so in an age-depen-
dent manner and likely is inefficient in the context of a robust
innate immune response.
We performed additional experiments to characterize ZIKV
infection in older Ifnar1�/� mice to determine the possible utility
of the model for vaccine studies. Whereas 4- to 6-week-old
Ifnar1�/� mice succumb to infection by several strains of ZIKV,
vaccine studies will require mice to be older at the time of viral
challenge due to the timing of prime-boost regimens. To test
whether older Ifnar1�/� mice remain vulnerable to ZIKV infection,
we infected 3-, 4-, and 6-month-old Ifnar1�/� mice with 103 FFU
of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) and monitored weight loss and lethality (Fig-
ure 4). Mice of all ages lost weight after ZIKV infection, with �30%
of starting weight lost by 9 days after infection. Despite the signif-
icant weight loss, 40%–80%of mice ultimately survived infection.
Figure 1. Mice Lacking IFN-a/b Responses
Are Susceptible to ZIKV Disease
(A–F) Five- to six-week-old mice of the indicated
genotypes were inoculated with 102 FFU of ZIKV
strain H/PF/2013 or MR 766 by a subcutaneous
route (s.c.) in the footpad (A–D) or by an intrave-
nous (i.v.) route (E and F). Mice were weighed daily
and weights are expressed as percentage of body
weight prior to infection (A, C, and E). Results
shown are the mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM) of the indicated number of mice per group.
Data are censored at 7 days after infection, as
mice in some groups died. Lethality was moni-
tored for 14 days (B, D, and F). For (A) and (B): n =
16 (Ifnar1�/�), 5 (Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO,
Mavs�/�, WT), 9 (Irf3�/�). For (C) and (D): n = 15
(Ifnar1�/�), 5 (Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO, Mavs�/�),
9 (Irf3�/�), 3 (WT). For (E) and (F): n = 9 (Ifnar1�/� H/
PF/2013), 4 (Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO, WT H/PF/
2013), 10 (Ifnar1�/� MR 766), 5 (Irf3�/� Irf5�/�
Irf7�/� TKO MR 766).
Since IFN-a/b signaling appears to
have a key role in restricting ZIKV infec-
tion in mice, we tested whether treatment
with
an
IFNAR1-blocking
monoclonal
antibody (MAR1-5A3) (Sheehan et al.,
2006) could render WT mice susceptible
to ZIKV disease. This strategy might be
valuable for vaccine studies, as it would
allow immune responses to be elicited
in immunocompetent mice with the pos-
sibility of enhancing infection at the time
of viral challenge. In prior studies with
WNV, a related neurotropic flavivirus, we
showed
that
blockade
of
IFN-a/b
signaling with MAR1-5A3 could recapitu-
late
the
susceptible
phenotype
of
Ifnar1�/� mice (Pinto et al., 2011; Shee-
han et al., 2015). With the goal of estab-
lishing a higher-throughput mouse model
of ZIKV infection and disease in the context of WT mice, we
treated WT mice with 750 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg of MAR1-5A3 or
2 mg of isotype control antibody via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
1 day prior to (as well as after, for the 2 mg total dose) infection
with 103 FFU of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) (Figure 5). Although mice did
not lose weight or succumb to infection, animals treated with 1
or 2 mg of MAR1-5A3 developed higher viral loads at day 3 after
infection compared to control treated mice. This model may be
useful for evaluating protection elicited by candidate ZIKV vac-
cines, using viremia as a correlate of protection rather than
morbidity or mortality. These observations also demonstrate
that ZIKV can replicate and establish viremia even in the absence
of clinical disease signs.
Tissue Tropism of ZIKV in Mice
We next determined the tissue tropism of ZIKV by infecting 4- to
6-week-old WT and Ifnar1�/� mice with 103 FFU of ZIKV (H/PF/
2013) by subcutaneous inoculation and measuring viral burden
in tissues at 2 or 6 days after infection (Figure 6). ZIKV replicated
722
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 720–730, May 11, 2016
 inefficiently in WT mice, with levels of viral RNA above back-
ground observed primarily in the spleen (Figures 6A–6G). In com-
parison, Ifnar1�/� mice sustained higher viral loads in all tested
tissues (spleen, liver, kidney, serum, testes, brain, and spinal
cord). By 6 days after infection, high levels of ZIKV viral RNA
were observed in CNS tissues of Ifnar1�/� mice (> 106 FFU
equivalents per gram in the brain and spinal cord), confirming
the neurotropic potential of the virus (Bell et al., 1971; Martines
et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016; Sarno et al., 2016; Tang et al.,
2016). Remarkably, the highest levels of ZIKV RNA (107 FFU
equivalents per gram) were present in the testes, which could
explain male-to-female sexual transmission of ZIKV observed
in humans (Foy et al., 2011; Hills et al., 2016; Musso et al.,
2015; Venturi et al., 2016). We performed plaque assays to mea-
sure infectious ZIKV in the testes, brain, and spinal cord. Consis-
tent with the qRT-PCR results, we found high levels of ZIKV in all
three tissues in Ifnar1�/� mice at 6 days after infection (Figures
6I–6K). To determine whether ZIKV can persist in tissues after
clinical disease signs have resolved, we measured viral RNA
levels in the brain and testes 28 days after ZIKV H/PF/2013 infec-
tion from surviving 3-, 4-, or 6-month-old Ifnar1�/� mice. ZIKV
RNA was detected in all surviving animals, with approximately

(A–C) Mice of the indicated genotypes were infected with ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (A) or MR 766 (B) by a subcutaneous (s.c.) (A and B) or intravenous (C) route, and
disease signs were assessed daily for 10 days. The percentage of each group of mice displaying the indicated signs is shown. These are the same mice evaluated
for weight loss and lethality in Figure 1.

 104 and 105 FFU equivalents per gram in the brain and
testes, respectively. In the brain, the age at the time of infection
did not impact the level of viral RNA persistence. As only
two
male
mice were
available
for
testes
analysis
(both
4 months old at infection), analogous conclusions could not be
established.
DISCUSSION
The emergence of ZIKV in the western hemisphere and in partic-
ular the unexpected association between ZIKV, birth defects,
and GBS has focused international public health attention on
this previously obscure virus and spurred calls for rapid develop-
ment of vaccines and therapeutics. However, it will be difficult to
evaluate candidate products rapidly without small animal
models of disease. Furthermore, a mechanistic understanding
of ZIKV pathogenesis, which can be determined using animal
models of disease, can provide insight into the dynamics of
ZIKV spread and transmission.
In our experiments, ZIKV infection did not cause disease in
weaned WT mice (> 3 weeks old), results that are consistent
with the original description of the prototype ZIKV strain, MR
766, almost 70 years ago. In comparison, suckling WT mice
(1 week old) were susceptible to infection. ZIKV replicated and
caused disease in juvenile and adult mice lacking IFN-a/b immu-
nity, with spread to many tissues including the CNS and the
testes. We observed similar patterns of susceptibility using five
different strains of ZIKV, including a contemporary human clin-
ical isolate as well as historical African strains, highlighting the
utility of the Ifnar1�/� mouse model for a range of studies of
ZIKV pathogenesis. Although further studies are warranted, the
relative resistance of adult mice may reflect an inability of ZIKV
to antagonize murine IFN-a/b signaling or effector functions effi-
ciently, analogous to DENV (Pagni and Fernandez-Sesma, 2012;
Suthar et al., 2013). The only adult mice we found susceptible to
lethal ZIKV infection were Ifnar1�/�, Irf3�/� Irf5�/� Irf7�/� TKO,
and AG129 (Ifnar1 and Ifngr1 deficient) mice, all of which
lack the capacity either to respond to or induce IFN-a/b.

 Ifnar1�/� mice remained susceptible to ZIKV-induced morbidity
and mortality even when infected at 6 months of age, indicating
the utility of this model for vaccine challenge studies.
Ifnar1�/� mice have been used previously as a small-animal
model for flavivirus pathogenesis, including for DENV and YFV
(Meier et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2015; Sarathy et al., 2015; Zell-
weger et al., 2015). However, we acknowledge the limitations
of this mouse model with respect to providing a complete under-
standing of ZIKV pathogenesis, in particular the limitations of
studying viral pathogenesis using animals lacking a key compo-
nent of antiviral immunity. For instance, IFN-a/b-dependent re-
strictions on viral tropism or effects on B and T cell priming will
not be evident in this model. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that
Ifnar1�/� mice sustained high levels of ZIKV infection in the brain,
spinal cord, and testes. These tissues are relevant to aspects of
ZIKV disease and epidemiology in humans including GBS,
congenital infection/microcephaly, and sexual transmission.
We detected ZIKV RNA in the brains and testes of Ifnar1�/�
mice, even after disease signs had resolved. Although further
studies are needed to characterize the nature of ZIKV persistent
infection, these findings appear relevant to human infection,
given that ZIKV RNA has been detected in semen up to 2 months
after infection, from an otherwise healthy individual (Atkinson
et al., 2016). Flaviviruses generally are not associated with
persistent infection, but there is evidence of persistent WNV
infection in the kidneys and long-term viral shedding in urine
(Murray et al., 2010). In our studies, we infected mice with ZIKV
via a subcutaneous route; this is a common method in flavivirus
pathogenesis studies as it mimics key aspects of mosquito-
transmitted infection including local replication at the inoculation
site, spread to the draining lymph node, and establishment of

Ifnar1–/–
Mice and 1-Week-Old WT Mice
(A–C) Four-week-old WT (C57BL/6), CD-1, Irf5�/�,
and Ifnar1�/� mice were infected with 103 FFU of
one of three ZIKV strains isolated from mosquitoes
in Senegal (Dakar 41671, 41667, or 41519) by a
subcutaneous route (s.c.). Weights were obtained
over 21 days and are expressed as a percentage
of starting weight. Ifnar1�/� mice succumbed to
the infection after 6 days. Results shown are the
mean ± SEM of 4–5 mice per group (WT, CD-1,
and Irf5�/�) or 2–3 mice per group (Ifnar1�/�).
(D) One-week-old WT mice (n = 15) were infected

neal (i.p.) injection, and lethality was monitored for
30 days.
viremia prior to hematogenous dissemi-
nation to distant sites. However, the pub-
lic health urgency of the current ZIKV
outbreak has been driven primarily by
non-mosquito transmission routes, most
notably congenital infection and sexual
transmission. Although further experi-
ments are needed to develop patho-
genesis models that mimic these trans-
mission routes, the present model in
Ifnar1�/� mice is a valuable starting point. The presence of infec-
tious ZIKV in the testes suggests a path forward for addressing
key questions in the field including the duration of viral persis-
tence over time, defining the component cells that support
ZIKV infection in this immune privileged site, and developing
mouse models of sexual transmission.
To create an even more useful animal model, infection studies
are planned with more immunologically competent mice,
including mice that conditionally lack IFN-a/b signaling on spe-
cific cell types, analogous to recent studies with DENV (Pinto
et al., 2015). The development of viremia in MAR1-5A3-treated
mice may be important for vaccine studies, as it allows for the in-
duction of native adaptive immune responses in WT mice with
subsequent attenuation of IFN-a/b responses and innate immu-
nity prior to ZIKV challenge studies. Antibody blockade of IFN-
a/b signaling with MAR1-5A3, however, did not recapitulate
the severity of ZIKV disease phenotype observed in Ifnar1�/�
mice, despite using high doses (2 mg or 133 mg/kg per
4-week-old mouse). Whereas all ZIKV-infected Ifnar1�/� mice
showed evidence of neurological disease, MAR1-5A3-treated
mice appeared healthy even though levels of ZIKV viremia
were substantially higher than isotype control-treated mice at
day 3 after infection, when it was tested. This result contrasts
with prior studies with WNV, which showed that pre-treatment
of WT mice with MAR-5A3 phenocopied Ifnar1�/� mice, with
complete lethality observed (Pinto et al., 2011; Sheehan et al.,
2015). The disparity between ZIKV and WNV phenotypes in
Ifnar1�/�- and MAR1-5A3-treated mice may reflect the mecha-
nism of lethal disease. In WNV, death in Ifnar1�/�- and MAR1-
5A3-treated mice occurred rapidly (3–5 days post-infection)
and was due to a MAVS-dependent virus-induced sepsis (Pinto
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 720–730, May 11, 2016
725
 et al., 2014). In contrast, ZIKV-induced death in Ifnar1�/� mice
occurred later (8–12 days post-infection) and was associated
with viral infection in the brain and spinal cord, as well as neuro-
logical signs including paralysis and encephalitis. MAR1-5A3
treatment may not enhance ZIKV infection and disease in the
CNS because the antibody does not cross the blood-brain bar-
rier efficiently and therefore has limited impact on IFN-a/b
signaling in these tissues.
In summary, our results show that IFN-a/b signaling plays a
key role in restricting ZIKV infection in mice. The use of mice
with diminished or absent IFN-a/b signaling provides a small an-
imal model for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics to combat
ZIKV. Such models also will be valuable for studying the patho-
genesis of ZIKV and mechanisms of viral immune evasion and for
understanding unexpected clinical manifestations of ZIKV infec-
tion in humans.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes
of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (assurance
no. A3381-01). Inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was
induced and maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all ef-
forts were made to minimize animal suffering.
Cells
Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Omega) and L-glutamine
at 37�C with 5% CO2. C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells were maintained in
DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), non-essential amino acids, and HEPES
at 28�C with 5% CO2.
Viruses
ZIKV strains MR 766 (Uganda, 1947), Dakar 41519 (Senegal, 1984), Dakar
41667 (Senegal, 1984), and Dakar 41671 (Senegal, 1984) were provided by
the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh,
University of Texas Medical Branch) (Dick et al., 1952; Haddow et al., 2012;
Kuno and Chang, 2007). ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013)
was provided by the Arbovirus Branch of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention with permission (X. de Lamballerie, Aix Marseille Universite
´ )
(Baronti et al., 2014). ZIKV stocks were propagated in C6/36 Aedes albopictus
or Vero cells after inoculating at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and harvesting
supernatants after 96 and 72 hr, respectively. Virus stocks were titrated by
focus-forming assay (FFA) on Vero cells (Brien et al., 2013). Infected cell foci
were detected at 48 hr after infection, following fixation with 1% paraformalde-
hyde and incubation with 500 ng/ml of flavivirus cross-reactive mouse mono-
clonal antibody E60 (Oliphant et al., 2006) for 2 hr at room temperature. After
incubation for 1 hr with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), foci were detected by addition of
TrueBlue substrate (KPL). Foci were analyzed with a CTL Immunospot instru-
ment. Studies with ZIKV were conducted under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) and
animal BSL3 (A-BSL3) containment at Washington University School of Med-
icine with Institutional Biosafety Committee approval.

 for AG129 and CD-1. Mice were bred in a specific-pathogen-free facility at
Washington University or purchased from Jackson Laboratories (WT C57BL/6
and CD-1). Mice were inoculated with ZIKV by subcutaneous (footpad), intrave-
nous (retro-orbital), or i.p. routes with 102, 103, or 104 FFU of ZIKV in a volume of
50 mL. Survival, weight loss, and disease signs were monitored for 14–30 days,
depending on the experiment. To evaluate clinical disease, mice were assigned
to one of the following categories each day: (A) no disease, (B) hindlimb weak-
ness or disrupted righting reflex, (C) partial hindlimb paralysis or toe knuckling,
(D) complete paralysis of one hindlimb, (E) complete paralysis of both hindlimbs,
(F) complete paralysis of all four limbs, or (G) moribund or dead; mice with a dis-
ease score of F or G were euthanized. In some experiments, WT mice were
treated with indicated doses of an IFNAR-blocking mouse mAb (MAR1-5A3)
or isotype control mouse mAb (GIR-208) (produced by Leinco Technologies)
(Sheehan et al., 2006, 2015) by i.p. injection.
Measurement of Viral Burden
ZIKV-infected mice were euthanized at 2, 6, or 28 days after infection and
perfused with 20 ml of PBS. Liver, spleen, kidney, testes, brain, and spinal
cord were harvested, weighed, and homogenized with zirconia beads in a
MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 1 ml of minimal essential me-
dium (MEM) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Blood was
collected and allowed to clot at room temperature; serum was separated by
centrifugation. All homogenized tissues and serum from infected animals
were stored at �80�C until virus titration. With some samples, viral burden
was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Samples were thawed, clari-
fied by centrifugation (2,0003 g at 4�C for 10 min), and then diluted serially
prior to infection of Vero cells. Plaque assays were overlaid with agarose
and 4 days later were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal
violet (Brien et al., 2013). Tissue samples and serum from ZIKV-infected
Figure 6. Tissue Tropism of ZIKV in WT and Ifnar1–/– Mice
(A–K) Four- to six-week-old WT or Ifnar1�/� C57BL/6 male mice were inoculated with 103 FFU of ZIKV H/PF/2013 by a subcutaneous route. At day 2 or day 6 after
infection, the indicated tissues were harvested, weighed, homogenized, and analyzed by qRT-PCR (A–G) or plaque assay (I–K). Results are combined from two
independent experiments with a total of seven mice per group; data are expressed as FFU equivalents per gram or milliliter after normalization to a standard curve
generated in parallel (A–G) or as plaque-forming units (PFU) per gram (I–K). (H) Brain and testes were harvested 28 days after infection from 3-, 4-, or 6-month old
Ifnar1�/� mice inoculated with 103 FFU of ZIKV H/PF/2013, and viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. These mice are the survivors from experiments
shown in Figure 4 (all surviving mice for brain tissue, males only for testes).

 mice were extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (tissues) or Viral RNA Mini Kit
(serum) (QIAGEN). ZIKV RNA levels were determined by TaqMan one-step
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instru-
ment using standard cycling conditions. Viral burden is expressed on a log10
scale as viral RNA equivalents per gram or per milliliter after comparison
with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA.
A previously published primer set was used to detect ZIKV RNA (Lanciotti
et al., 2008): forward, 50-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-30; reverse, 50-CCAC
TAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-30; probe, 50-/56-FAM/AGCCTACCT/ZEN/TGA
CAAGCAATCAGACACTCAA/3IABkFQ/-30 (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Data Analysis
All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were analyzed by the log rank test, and weight losses were compared
using two-way ANOVA. For viral burden analysis, the log titers and levels of
viral RNA were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. A p value of < 0.05 indi-
cated statistically significant differences.
