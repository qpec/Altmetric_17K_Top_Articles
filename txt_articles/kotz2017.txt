ABSTRACT
Background Varenicline and bupropion are effective
smoking cessation treatments, but there are concerns
about their safety in smokers with COPD.
Objective To investigate whether varenicline and
bupropion are associated with serious adverse
cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric events in smokers
with COPD.
Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we used data
from 14 350 patients with COPD included in the
QResearch database, which holds data from 753
National Health Service general practices across England.
We identified patients with COPD who received a
prescription of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT;
N=10 426; reference group), bupropion (N=350) or
varenicline (N=3574) in the period between January
2007 and June 2012. Patients were followed up for
6 months to compare incident cardiovascular (ie,
ischaemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias) and
neuropsychiatric (ie, depression and self-harm) events
using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for
potential confounders. Propensity score analysis was
used as an additional approach to account for potential
confounding by indication. We also modelled the effects
of possible unmeasured confounders.
Results Neither bupropion nor varenicline showed an
increased risk of adverse events compared with NRT.
Varenicline was associated with a significantly reduced
risk of heart failure (HR=0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92)
and depression (HR=0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.86).
Similar results were obtained from the propensity score
analysis. Modelling of unmeasured confounding provided
additional evidence that an increased risk of these
adverse events was very unlikely.
Conclusion In smokers with COPD, varenicline and
bupropion do not appear to be associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular events, depression or
self-harm in comparison with NRT.
INTRODUCTION
Varenicline and bupropion are effective smoking
cessation treatments, but have been suspected to be
associated with serious adverse cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric
events.
The
two
drugs
have
proved to be effective in aiding long-term smoking
cessation, both in the general smoking population1 2
and in the subgroup of smokers with COPD.3
However, postmarketing reports raised concerns
about the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric events, prompting the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European
Medicines Agency to add warnings in the drugs’
prescribing information. This included a boxed
warning—FDA’s most prominent warning—in the
drug labels in 2009 about symptoms such as
depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and behaviour
and attempted suicide.4
Very recently, the FDA decided to remove the
boxed warning for serious mental health effects
from the varenicline and bupropion labels.5 This
decision was based on a large randomised con-
trolled trial that the FDA required the drug com-
panies to conduct, which showed no significant
increase in neuropsychiatric events in users of vare-
nicline or bupropion compared with users of nico-
tine patch or placebo.6 The trial thereby confirmed
evidence from meta-analyses of previous rando-
mised controlled trials and from observational
studies indicating that a causal relationship between
the use of these drugs and serious adverse cardio-
vascular and neuropsychiatric events is unlikely.7–11
One of these studies was an observational study we
conducted using analysis of a large, validated
English primary care database.11
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Are varenicline or bupropion associated with an
increased risk of serious cardiovascular events,
depression or self-harm in smokers with COPD?
What is the bottom line?
▸ In smokers with COPD, varenicline and
bupropion do not appear to be associated with
an increased risk of documented cardiovascular
events, depression or self-harm.
Why read on?
▸ This is the first study investigating the most
important serious neuropsychiatric and
cardiovascular adverse events in one study and
with the same rigorous methodology in a large
sample (N=14 350) of patients with COPD
using real-life data.

 Although there is now good evidence about the safety of
varenicline and bupropion in the general smoking population,
it is important to assess specifically whether these drugs are
associated with serious adverse events in diseased subgroups,
particularly in smokers with COPD who are already, by virtue
of their diagnosis, at increased risk of cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric events.12 Tobacco smoking is the most import-
ant
risk
factor
for
the
development
and
progression
of
COPD,13 14 and smoking cessation is the only treatment with
proven effectiveness to reduce the accelerated decline in lung
function.13
14 It also affects other outcomes positively—for
example, the response to treatment with bronchodilators and
inhaled corticosteroids.14 International guidelines therefore rec-
ommend that smokers with COPD should be assisted during
their attempt to quit with a combination of pharmacotherapy
and behavioural support.13
15 In UK and German primary
care, varenicline is the preferred pharmacotherapy in smokers
with COPD.16 17
In our previous study,11 we showed that varenicline and
bupropion were not associated with an increased risk of serious
adverse
cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric
events
in
the
general smoking population. The aim of this study, as detailed
in our a priori published study protocol,18 was to investigate
the safety of the two drugs in the subgroup of smokers with
COPD.
METHODS
W
e conducted a national, retrospective cohort study using the
QResearch database (V
.36, upload 31 July 2013), which holds
anonymised health records of over 13 million patients from
753 National Health Service general practices from across
England (http://www.qresearch.org). QResearch has been used
for various studies of the incidence and risk of neuropsychi-
atric and cardiovascular events—in particular, our previous
study on the safety of varenicline and bupropion in the general
smoking population.11 W
e have now used this database to
investigate the risk of the two drugs in the subgroup of
smokers with COPD—a specific aim we described earlier in
our
study
protocol.18
That
protocol
provides
a
detailed
description of our analysis plan, and here we present below an
overview of our methods. The only deviation from our pub-
lished plan is that we could not perform an instrumental vari-
able analysis because we were unable to identify a valid
instrumental variable and instead, we undertook additional
analyses (ie, modelling) to assess the impact of any potential
unmeasured confounding. The use of this particular method
was also prompted by concerns recently raised by the FDA in
relation to evidence from previous observational studies on the
safety of varenicline.19
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
W
e studied adult patients with recorded COPD who received
prescriptions for varenicline, bupropion or nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT) between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2012.
COPD was defined by appropriate Read codes (a clinical coding
system used by general practitioners in the UK; see Kotz
et al18). Patients aged <35 years and with no recording of spir-
ometry or Medical Research Council dyspnoea score20 were
excluded (14.0% of all patients with recorded COPD). The date
of first prescription of one of these drugs defined the indivi-
dual’s entry date to the cohort. Patients were excluded if they
had used one of the drugs during 12 months before the start
date of the study or if they had received a prescription of a com-
bination of these drugs during the follow-up period.
Exposure measures
Patients were categorised into three exposure groups: (1) vareni-
cline alone, (2) bupropion alone or (3) nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT) alone, based on the drug they were first pre-
scribed. W
e used NRT as a reference group to reduce the risk of
confounding by indication18 and because it is presumed by regu-
lators not to carry serious risks. In the UK, all three drugs are
licensed only for use to aid smoking cessation.21 Start of
follow-up began for each patient on the date of the first pre-
scription and ended after 6 months’ follow-up or when reaching
the specific event of interest (see below). Patients who were lost
to follow-up because they left the practice or died were cen-
sored on that date.
Outcome measures
W
e separately considered major incident neuropsychiatric and
cardiovascular
events
that
occurred
during
6 months
of
follow-up for which a potential association with varenicline use
has been suggested.10 22 23 The cardiovascular events of interest
were ischaemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The neuropsychiatric
outcomes of interest were depression and fatal or non-fatal self-
harm. A follow-up period of 6 months covers the treatment dur-
ation of the drugs (typically 12 weeks) as well as an extended
period after termination of treatment, in which many of the
spontaneously reported adverse events occurred and where the
excess in cardiovascular events was found in meta-analyses of
clinical trials. As a secondary outcome, we assessed the occur-
rence of these events during the first 3 months of follow-up.
Confounding factors
The following variables, measured at or before the patient’s
entry date to the cohort, were included in the analyses as poten-
tial confounders: age, sex, socioeconomic status (measured
using the Townsend Index24), Medical Research Council dys-
pnoea score,20 Strategic Health Authority of the general prac-
tice, relevant comorbidities from the Charlson Index25 (ie,
diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease, rheumatological
disease or cancer) and alcohol misuse. In addition, any record-
ings of the neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular events of interest
that occurred before the patient’s entry date to the cohort were
also included.
Statistical analyses
W
e used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess
the association between exposure group and each of the above
mentioned events, adjusted for all measured potential confoun-
ders (see above). All variables were entered as binary variables
into the models except for the continuous variables age and
socioeconomic status. W
e also used a propensity score analysis
with trimming and matching to account for potential confound-
ing by indication (the methodological details of this analysis
have been reported in our study protocol18). In addition, we
used an approach described by Lin et al26 to model the effects
of any potential unmeasured confounding. For this purpose, we
adjusted the HRs and 95% CIs in users of varenicline versus
NRT for each of the events for a hypothetical, unmeasured,
binary confounder with a HR of 3 and various combinations of
prevalence among the two exposure groups.
All analyses were undertaken in R (V
.3.0.2 or later). W

ing significance.

 Ethical considerations
This study involved the analysis of anonymised, routinely col-
lected data. Our protocol was independently peer reviewed by
the QResearch Scientific Board and satisfied the requirements of
the Trent research ethics committee.
RESULTS
A total of 14 350 patients with COPD were included in
the analyses: 10 426 users of NRT
, 350 users of bupropion
and 3574 users of varenicline (figure 1). This subgroup of
smokers with COPD from the database were older, more
deprived and showed higher prevalence rates of comorbid
diseases,
including
the
cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric
diseases of interest, than the subgroup of smokers without
COPD (table 1).
Patients with COPD who used NRT were older, had more
severe
dyspnoea
and
showed
higher
prevalence
rates
of
comorbid diseases than users of bupropion and varenicline
(table 2). The highest incidence rates of events were found for
depression and ischaemic heart disease (table 3, see online
supplementary figures E1–7).
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses
Neither bupropion nor varenicline showed an increased risk of
any cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric event compared with
NRT (table 3). The estimated HR were <1 in users of bupro-
pion and varenicline relative to NRT users—indicating no
increased risk—for stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular
disease, arrhythmia, depression or self-harm. Only for ischaemic
heart disease, the HR was >1 in users of bupropion and vareni-
cline, but this difference was not statistically significant (for var-
enicline, the HR was only minimally higher than 1 and the CI
was large: HR=1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.24). Rather, varenicline
was associated with a significantly reduced risk of heart failure
(HR=0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92) and depression (HR=0.73,
95% CI 0.61 to 0.86).

 Chi-squared tests indicated that hazards were not propor-
tional for the outcome depression (p=0.041), but a more fine-
grained analysis allowing for varying HRs indicated that the HR
always fell below 1.00 across the entire follow-up period.
Furthermore, we found that the risk of heart failure in users of
varenicline compared with NRT differed statistically between
female and male subjects (p=0.017), but the HR was again
always >1.00.
Propensity score analyses
After trimming and matching patients by propensity score, the
sample size was 682 for the comparison of bupropion versus
NRT and 6968 for the comparison of varenicline versus NRT
. A
comparison of patient characteristics showed that the drug
groups were generally well matched in both comparisons (see
online supplementary table E1). Neither bupropion nor vareni-
cline showed an increased risk of any neuropsychiatric or car-
diovascular event compared with NRT (table 4). For ischaemic
heart disease, the HR was higher than 1 in users of bupropion
and lower in users of varenicline, but in both cases the differ-
ence was small and not statistically significant (HR=1.23, 95%
CI 0.49 to 3.12 for bupropion vs NRT and HR=0.97, 95% CI
0.75 to 1.24 for varenicline vs NRT). Also in this propensity
score analysis, varenicline was associated with a significantly
reduced risk of depression (HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.83).
Modelling of unmeasured confounding
The modelling showed that an increased risk of any of the
neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular events in users of vareni-
cline was very unlikely (see online supplementary tables E2–8).
For example, an unmeasured confounder with a HR of 3 for
self-harm would have reversed the observed reduced HR in
users of varenicline versus NRT (HR=0.78) into an increased
HR (>1.00) only if the prevalence of this confounder had been
very different among the two groups of medication users (eg,
only 0% among users of varenicline and simultaneously at least
90% among users of NRT; table 5).
Secondary analyses
The results from the Cox proportional hazards regression ana-
lyses, propensity score analyses and the modelling of unmeas-
ured confounding with the occurrence of the cardiovascular and
neuropsychiatric events during 3 months of follow-up yielded
very similar results (see online supplementary tables E9–17).
DISCUSSION
W
e found no evidence for any increased risk of cardiovascular
and neuropsychiatric adverse events in smokers with COPD
using varenicline or bupropion to aid their attempt to quit in
comparison with users of NRT
. On the contrary, some events
were associated with a reduced risk (ie, heart failure and depres-
sion). Modelling the effects of any potential unmeasured con-
founders found that these would only lead to an increased risk
associated with varenicline use under unlikely assumptions.
W
e are not aware of previous studies specifically designed to
assess the risks of varenicline or bupropion in patients with
COPD. The efficacy trial by Tashkin et al27 found higher rates
of psychiatric adverse events (in particular, sleep and mood dis-
orders), but no difference in serious adverse events between
active varenicline and placebo. However, this trial included only
504 smokers and was not statistically powered to detect rare
events.
More evidence on the risks of varenicline is available from
studies conducted in the general smoking population. For car-
diovascular events, one meta-analysis reported an increased risk
of cardiovascular events in users of varenicline,23 whereas later
meta-analyses7–9 and large-scale observational studies found no
such association.10 11 With regard to neuropsychiatric events, a
recent trial in 8144 smokers with and without psychiatric disor-
ders found no significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse
events attributable to varenicline relative to nicotine patch or
placebo.6

Our study has several strengths and limitations. A study using
observational data to compare the risks of different groups of
medication users is prone to confounding by indication. Our
data indeed show differences in patient characteristics between
users of varenicline, bupropion and NRT
. At baseline, the
reference group of NRT users had higher prevalence rates of
risk factors for the adverse events under study (eg, NRT users
were older, had more severe COPD and higher prevalence of
comorbidities). W
e accounted for such differences by adjusting
our regression models with measured confounders and by
reanalysing the data in a propensity score analysis with trimming
and matching. Uniquely, we also modelled what would need to
be the distribution and influence of unmeasured confounders to
overturn the key conclusions. W
e applied this approach origin-
ally described by Lin et al,26 also in our previous analyses on
the risks of varenicline in the general smoking population and
described the implications in more detail.11 In summary, we
conclude that our findings are unlikely to be confounded to an
extent
that
would
have
obscured
an
increased
risk
of
varenicline.
Another point to discuss is the use of routinely collected data
in this study. Our definition of COPD relied on diagnostic codes
entered by general practitioners into the patients’ electronic
health records. W
e combined codes for COPD diagnosis with
codes for the measurement of spirometry and dyspnoea and
excluded patients under the age of 35 to increase the validity of
our definition. However, we did not have individual patient
data on lung function at the time of inclusion into our cohort.
Hence, misclassification might have occurred and a more fine-
grained analysis according to different stages of COPD severity

 was not possible. Furthermore, this routine dataset did not
include variables of potential interest, such as medication adher-
ence, previous and current levels of tobacco exposure and
smoking cessation outcomes during follow-up. W
e were also not
able to assess what the FDA has described as ‘nuanced’ neuro-
psychiatric symptoms such as mood disorders that involve
aggression.30 Nevertheless, the neuropsychiatric events in our
study are among the most important ones and are included in
the boxed warning. Finally, the sample size for the statistical
analyses with bupropion was rather low as only 350 patients
with COPD had used this medication, which resulted in large
CIs around the HRs for some adverse events. Therefore, for
those adverse events, estimated values from the statistical
models need to be cautiously interpreted.
A major strength of this work is that we conducted the first,
large-scale study on this topic in this patient population, with a
sample size that included 3574 patients with COPD using vare-
nicline (and 14 350 patients with COPD in total). Second, we
investigated the most important neuropsychiatric and cardiovas-
cular adverse events at the same time and with the same meth-
odology. Third, our study has high external validity due to the
use of real-life patient data collected from a large number of dif-
ferent general practitioner practices across England (a country
with a national healthcare system in which all members of the
community, regardless of socioeconomic status, have free and
ready access to smoking
cessation treatment). Finally,
we
planned our study methodology and described it in great detail
before the analysis and interpretation of data in a peer-reviewed
protocol.18
W
e conclude that, in smokers with COPD, varenicline and
bupropion are unlikely to be associated with increased risk of
serious adverse neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular events com-
pared with NRT

 Competing interests DK received an unrestricted grant from Pfizer for an
investigator-initiated trial on the effectiveness of practice nurse counselling and
varenicline for smoking cessation in primary care (Dutch Trial Register NTR3067).
RW received grants, personal fees and non-financial support from Pfizer, GSK and
J&J and personal fees from Novartis. OCPvS received an unrestricted research grant
from Pfizer. None of this funding was directly related to this study. Furthermore, the
manufacturers of varenicline and bupropion were not involved during any stage of
this project. DK was supported by a research grant (“NRW-Rückkehrprogramm)”
from the Ministry for Innovation, Science and Research of the German Federal State
of North Rhine-Westphalia. AS was supported by the Farr Institute, which is
