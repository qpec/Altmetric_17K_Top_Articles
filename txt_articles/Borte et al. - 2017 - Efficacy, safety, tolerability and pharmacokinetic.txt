Summary
A highly concentrated (20%) immunoglobulin (Ig)G preparation for
subcutaneous administration (IGSC 20%), would offer a new option for
antibody replacement therapy in patients with primary immunodeficiency
diseases (PIDD). The efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
IGSC 20% were evaluated in a prospective trial in Europe in 49 patients
with PIDD aged 2–67 years. Over a median of 358 days, patients received
2349
IGSC
20%
infusions
at
monthly
doses
equivalent
to
those
administered for previous intravenous or subcutaneous IgG treatment. The
rate of validated acute bacterial infections (VASBIs) was significantly lower
than 1 per year (0�022/patient-year, P < 0�0001); the rate of all infections
was 4�38/patient-year. Median trough IgG concentrations were � 8 g/l.
There was no serious adverse event (AE) deemed related to IGSC 20%
treatment; related non-serious AEs occurred at a rate of 0�101 event/
infusion. The incidence of local related AEs was 0�069 event/infusion (0�036
event/infusion, when excluding a 13-year-old patient who reported 79 of
162 total related local AEs). The incidence of related systemic AEs was 0�032
event/infusion. Most related AEs were mild, none were severe. For 64�6% of
patients and in 94�8% of IGSC 20% infusions, no local related AE occurred.
The median infusion duration was 0�95 (range 5 0�3-4�1) h using mainly
one to two administration sites [median 5 2 sites (range 5 1–5)]. Almost all
infusions (99�8%) were administered without interruption/stopping or rate
reduction. These results demonstrate that IGSC 20% provides an effective
and well-tolerated therapy for patients previously on intravenous or
subcutaneous treatment, without the need for dose adjustment.

Introduction
Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD) are disorders
that result in an increased susceptibility to recurrent infec-
tions, due to underlying genetic defects in antibody and/or
cell-mediated immunity [1]. More than 300 different
genetic defects leading to PIDD have been recognized [2].
Primary antibody deficiency with or without decreased lev-
els of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) is the most common
class of PIDD and includes syndromes such as common
variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked or autosomal
recessive agammaglobulinaemia, hyper-immunoglobulin
(Ig)M syndrome, deficiencies of specific antibodies and/or
Ig isotype or IgG subclasses [3].
Antibody replacement therapy using highly purified
human Ig preparations is the standard of care in immunode-
ficiencies with impaired antibody production [1]. Ig prepara-
tions, administered intravenously (IGIV) or subcutaneously
(IGSC) to increase the serum IgG concentration to physio-
logical levels with polyclonal broad-spectrum antibodies,
provide protection against infection in PIDD patients [4,5].

 Typically, effective treatment of PIDD with IGIV requires
monthly doses of 0�3–0�8 g/kg body weight (BW) adminis-
tered every 3–4 weeks by intravenous (i.v.) infusion over 2–
4 h. The IGIV volumes delivered rapidly into the systemic
circulation usually lead to serum IgG peaks within 24 h,
decreasing gradually over the treatment interval. High
peaks of serum IgG during IGIV therapy have been associ-
ated with an increased incidence of systemic adverse reac-
tions. In contrast to IGIV, for subcutaneous (s.c.) therapy,
the same dose is administered in smaller volumes at more
frequent intervals (once a week or every other week) over
1–2 h. As Ig diffuses slowly from the s.c. space into the sys-
temic circulation, weekly IGSC administration does not
lead to peaks of serum IgG concentrations, unlike monthly
i.v. infusions, and is associated with fewer systemic adverse
reactions [6–8]
The s.c. route of administration may appeal particularly
to patients interested in home-based therapy, as it can be
self-administered more easily [5,9]. However, drawbacks
exist, such as low infusion volumes and rates per site. Con-
sequently, IGSC administration is often accomplished via
several infusion sites per treatment. To improve the con-
venience of conventional IGSC infusion, highly concen-
trated IgG formulations are being developed that allow
infusion of the same dose in smaller infusion volumes com-
pared to less concentrated products [5].
An s.c. immunoglobulin product that can be infused at
high rates and volumes per site provides a convenient alter-
native to currently available conventional s.c. preparations
by decreasing infusion time and the number of infusion
sites. Immune globulin subcutaneous (human) is a 20%
concentrated, sterile liquid preparation of highly purified
and functionally intact human Ig, developed specifically for
s.c. administration (IGSC 20%) to provide patients with an
additional treatment option. Presented here are the results
of a multi-centre Phase 2/3 study that evaluated efficacy,
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteris-
tics of this new IGSC 20% treatment when administered to
adult and paediatric patients with PIDD without dose
adjustment relative to the previous i.v. or s.c. Ig product.
Material and methods
Study design
This prospective, non-controlled clinical trial in patients
with PIDD was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good
Clinical Practice in 16 clinical sites in seven countries in
Europe (registered on clinicaltrialsregister.eu: EudraCT #:
2010-019459-23
and
www.clinicaltrial.gov,
identifier:
NCT01412385). In period 1, patients received IGIV 10%
for 13 weeks or IGSC 16% for 12 weeks to ensure a stable
baseline serum IgG prior to IGSC 20% treatment. In
period 2, patients were treated with IGSC 20% for 52
weeks (Fig. 1).
Study population
Patients aged � 2 years qualified for participation in the
study if they had a documented diagnosis of PIDD requir-
ing IgG replacement therapy, as defined by the Interna-
tional Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Scientific
Committee 2009 [10] and by diagnostic criteria according
to Conley et al. [11]. Additionally, patients had to have
received a stable monthly dose of IgG (i.v. or s.c.) of 0�3–
1 g/kg BW/4 weeks for � 3 months prior to first treatment
in the study. Furthermore, they had to have serum IgG
trough levels > 5 g/l at screening and have not had any
serious bacterial infection within the 3 months prior to
screening. Patients were ineligible if they had a history of
hepatitis B or C or a positive human immunodeficiency
virus test; if they had an infection and/or were receiving
antibiotics; if they had abnormal alanine or aspartate ami-
notransferase values > 2�5 times the upper limit of normal
for the testing laboratory, creatinine clearance value < 60%
of normal according to their age and gender or severe neu-
tropenia; and if they had a history of thrombotic episode,
malignancy, protein loss, severe dermatitis, hypersensitivity
to Ig treatment or selective IgA deficiency (IgA < 7 mg/dl)
with anti-IgA antibodies and history of hypersensitivity. A

Study product
The production of IGSC 20%, a liquid concentrate of
aggregate-free IgG derived from human plasma, follows the
same manufacturing processes as IGI, 10% solution [Gam-
magard LiquidV
R in the United States and KiovigV
R in the
European Union (EU); Baxalta Inc., now part of Shire
Bannockburn, IL, USA] except for ultra-/diafiltration and
final formulation at 20% (w/v) protein concentration. The
manufacturing process of IGSC 20% includes three dedi-
cated virus inactivation and reduction steps [12–15]. IGSC
20% contains glycine as stabilizer to minimize IgG dimeri-
zation. The final IGSC 20% product has a viscosity of 14�4
mPa.s, an osmolality of 280–292 mOsm/kg and contains
trace amounts of IgA (average concentration: 80 mg/ml).
Each lot of IGSC 20% is monitored for pro-coagulant
activity using a thrombin generation assay to ensure that
the final container is free of pro-coagulants.
Immunoglobulin treatments
During period 1, patients received either IGSC 16%
(SubcuviaV
R) every week or every other week, or IGIV 10%
(KiovigV
R) every 3 or 4 weeks at the same dose as the pre-
study dose. Administration, route and infusion frequency
were dependent upon the prior treatment. During period 2,
patients were administered IGSC 20% once a week at the
same dose as in period 1 (adjusted to a weekly equivalent
dose). IGSC 20% was infused using an electromechanical
syringe-driver
pump
(CME
T34L;
Caesarea
Medical
Electronics, Caesarea, Israel) and 24-gauge needles (MarCal
Medical Millersville, MD, USA). The needle sets used in the
trial ranged from 6 to 12 mm in length at the discretion of
the investigator; there was no specified needle length for
infusion. If needed, the immunoglobulin dose was to be
increased, to maintain IgG trough levels > 5 g/l in line with
current treatment guidelines [16]. For patients with a BW of
40 kg or above, an infusion volume of up to 60 ml was to be
administered per infusion site if well tolerated. For patients
with BW below 40 kg, IGSC 20% infusion volumes were
limited to 20 ml/site for the initial two infusions. Volumes
could then be increased to a maximum of 60 ml/site as toler-
ated. Infusion rates were increased incrementally: the initial
two infusions were started at 10 ml/h/site, and could be
increased to a maximum of 20 ml/h/site. Subsequent IGSC
20% infusions could begin at the maximum tolerated rate,
and as tolerated, the rate could be increased in a stepwise
manner to a maximum of 60 ml/h/site. Multiple infusion
sites could be used simultaneously. Infusion sites were to be
rotated to avoid any single infusion site being used repeat-
edly within a short time-interval. Infusion of IGSC 20% at
home was possible after sufficient training of the patient/
caregiver or with assistance of a health-care professional.
Efficacy assessment
Serious bacterial infections (e.g. bacteraemia/sepsis, bacte-
rial
meningitis,
osteomyelitis/septic
arthritis,
bacterial
pneumonia and visceral abscesses) caused by a recognized
bacterial pathogen and diagnosed according to the Diag-
nostic Criteria for Serious Infection Types in the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, June
2008 [17] were analysed. The primary efficacy assessment
was the annualized rate of validated acute serious bacterial
infections (VASBIs, defined as RVASBI 5 mean number of
VASBI/patient-year). Assessment of efficacy also included
the annualized rate of all infections (i.e. VASBIs and all
other events assessed clinically as infections), of fever epi-
sodes (body temperature � 388C), of days with fever and of
days missed from school/work/daily activities due to ill-
ness/infection, the annualized rate of admissions to a hos-
pital, duration of stay in the hospital as in-patient, as well
as urgent/unscheduled physician visits due to illness/infec-
tion (apart from the regular investigator/study site visits
scheduled every 8–12 weeks within the study).
Safety
Safety was evaluated through clinical and laboratory assess-
ments. Safety data were collected throughout the study.
The adverse events (AEs) that occurred during infusions at
the study site (every 8–12 weeks) were recorded by the
investigator. All investigators were trained specifically on
symptoms of potential AEs. All patients received a diary to
record home treatments, AEs and additional information
continuously as they occurred. The investigator provided
guidance for the patient/caregiver regarding identification
and documentation of local and systemic AEs, including
signs of haemolysis such as fever, chills, back pain, fatigue
and dark urine. All patients were instructed to inform the
investigator/site immediately in case of such an event. In
addition, the patient was contacted by the investigator
within 3–5 days after each infusion, either at the study site
or at their home for follow-up to ensure appropriate docu-
mentation of AEs. The investigators reviewed patients’
diary entries at every site visit. All AEs were assessed by the
investigator using comprehensive data collection systems –
including the patient’s diary – for seriousness, severity,
temporal association and possible causal relatedness to the
immunoglobulin treatment.
Monitoring for potential cases of haemolysis included
routine haematology screening and haemolysis screening as
recommended by the FDA Guidance for Industry (June,
2008 [17]). If a decrease of haemoglobin (� 2g/dl) was

 measured during either the haematology or haemolysis
screening, the assessments to monitor for potential cases of
haemolysis were to be performed within 48–72 h of being
informed of the haemoglobin level, unless there was a clear
alternative explanation. These assessments included: direct
anti-globin
(Coomb’s)
test,
plasma-free
haemoglobin,
reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum
haptoglobin and urine haemosiderin.
Pharmacokinetics
Serum IgG concentrations were determined at a central
laboratory using a validated enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA)-based assay. Pharmacokinetic (PK)
assessments of IgG levels were performed in patients aged
� 12 years. In period 1, PK samples were collected between
the penultimate and the last infusions for patients treated
with IGIV 10% and after the last infusion prior to period 2
for patients receiving IGSC 16%. In period 2, PK samples
were collected between IGSC 20% infusion 21 and infusion
22. All patients underwent regular IgG trough level assess-
ment during period 1 at intervals of 3–4 weeks. During
IGSC 20% treatment, serum IgG trough levels were
measured prior to infusion 1, and then every 8 weeks from
infusion 5 to 21 and from infusion 27 until the end of
study; between infusions 21 and 27 trough levels were
measured weekly.
Statistical methods
Assuming RVASBI 5 0.6, a one-sided test and a type I
error 5 0�01, a sample size of 47 patients would have in
excess of 84% power to test the null hypothesis that RVASBI
� 1�0 against the alternative hypothesis RVASBI < 1�0.
RVASBI and the upper limit of 99% confidence interval (CI)
were calculated using a Poisson model accounting for the
variable length of observation periods. The area under the
curve (AUC) between adjacent infusions was calculated by
the trapezoidal rule. To allow for comparisons between
treatments, AUC
0–s was standardized for the infusion
intervals (2, 3 or 4 weeks versus 1 week 5 AUC0–s;h). The
bioavailability of IGSC 20% relative to IGIV 10% was
estimated from the ratio of AUC 0–s;h in period 2 over
AUC0–s;h in period 1 standardized to 1 week.
Measures of patient experience
Treatment burden related to Ig therapy was evaluated with
the Life Quality Index questionnaire (LQI) for patients
aged 2–13 years (observer: parent) and patients aged 14
years and older (observer: patient) [18,19]. The LQI covers
four
domains:
treatment
interference,
therapy-related
problems, therapy settings and treatment costs. Patients
received free treatment during the study; thus, the cost
domain is not reported. Quality of life was surveyed in
patients aged 2–7 years (observer: parent) and aged 8–13
years (observer: patient) using the Pediatric Quality of Life
InventoryTM (PEDS-QL) questionnaire [20] and in patients
aged 14 years and older (observer: patient) using the SF-36
survey [21]. The EQ-5D Health Questionnaire [22] was
used for all patients [aged 2–11 (observer: parents) and
aged 12 years and older (observer: patient)]. Evaluations
were performed at study start, at week 21 of period 2 and
at the ‘end-of-study’ visit (or early termination visit). Score
changes between the start of period 2 and the ‘end-of-
study’ visit were analysed. In all questionnaires, higher
scores indicated higher satisfaction.
Treatment preference outcomes were analysed separately
for the patient age groups of 2–13 years (observer: parent)
and 14 years and older (observer: patient) at the ‘end-of-
study’ visit.

 agammaglobulinaemia (22�4% congenital and autosomal
recessive combined, Table 1). All patients had received anti-
body replacement therapy until just prior to study entry
(67�3% i.v.; 32�7% s.c.); the administration route in period
1 stayed the same as in the pre-study period. Forty-eight
patients continued into period 2 and received IGSC 20%;
45 (93�8%) patients completed period 2 (Supporting infor-
mation, Fig. S1). One patient withdrew prematurely during
period 1 after becoming pregnant. In period 2, 3 patients
discontinued prematurely: one 13-year-old patient (patient
B) reported pain during and after administration and chose
to stop participation and two patients withdrew consent
for reasons unrelated to an AE (Supporting information,
Fig. S1).
Efficacy
The rate of VASBIs during IGSC 20% treatment was signifi-
cantly lower than 1 (RVASBI 5 0�022 event/patient-year,
upper limit of 99% CI 5 0�049; P < 0�0001) across all age
groups (Table 2). Two VASBIs of bacterial pneumonia
occurred in an 11-year-old patient who had X-linked
agammaglobulinaemia: one occurred during IGSC 16%
treatment and one occurred approximately 1 year after the
first case, during IGSC 20% treatment. Both pneumonia
episodes were treated with parenteral antibiotics in the
hospital.
The annualized rate of any infection was 4�38 events/
patient during IGSC 20% treatment (Table 2). One 39-
year old patient with CVID experienced two severe non-

 serious infections during IGSC 20% administration (one
bronchitis and one influenza infection). While receiving
IGSC 20% treatment, patients missed school/work at an
annualized rate of 15�55 days. For the 34 (70�8%) patients
who required antibiotics to treat infections during IGSC
20% treatment the annualized rate of days on antibiotics
was 18�11. The rate of hospitalization was 0�15 event/year
for a duration of 1�66 days/year. The rate of acute (urgent
or unscheduled) physician visits due to infection or other
illness was 3�77 events/year (Table 2).
Safety
No causally related serious AE (SAE) occurred during
IGSC 20% treatment (Table 3). During the entire course of
the study, there were 12 unrelated SAEs: two SAEs were
severe in nature (acute myocardial infarction and ventricu-
lar fibrillation), nine were moderate [lymphadenopathy,
forearm fracture, bacterial pneumonia (two events, as
described above), thoracic vertebral fracture, enteritis,
chronic sinusitis, brain stem infarction and rhinorrhoea]
and one mild (nasal septum deviation). The rate of non-
serious AEs was 0�223 event/infusion during IGSC 20%
treatment. In period 1, the incidence of non-serious AEs
was 0�712 event/infusion during IGIV 10% administration
and 0�193 event/infusion for patients receiving IGSC 16%.
Of 2349 IGSC 20% infusions administered during the
study, 2166 infusions (92�2%) were not associated with a
causally related non-serious AE; there was no severe AE
deemed causally related to IGSC 20% (Table 3).

 Systemic AEs assessed as causally related to IGSC 20%
treatment were reported in 16�7% of patients with an inci-
dence of 0�032 event/infusion. The most frequent systemic
AEs related to IGSC 20% infusion were diarrhoea (0�02
event/infusion) followed by headache (0�0094 event/infu-
sion) and fatigue (0�0013 event/infusion). While on IGSC
20% treatment, 6�3% of patients experienced headache,
4�2% had diarrhoea and 4�2% reported fatigue (Table 4).
Most (46 of 47) of the diarrhoea events were observed in
one patient with CVID who had a medical history of
ongoing recurrent diarrhoea prior to the study. Excluding
this patient, only one patient (2�1%) experienced one event
of diarrhoea that was deemed related to IGSC 20% (0�0004
event/infusion). Other systemic AEs deemed causally
related to IGSC 20% (hypotension, abdominal pain and
positive direct Coomb’s test) were rarely reported, each at a
rate of 0�0004 events/infusion in 2�1% of patients. There
was no event of laboratory-confirmed haemolysis during
periods 1 or 2 with IGSC 20% administration. In six
patients a temporary decline in haemoglobin of 2�0 g/dl or
more was reported [during IGIV 10% treatment (n 5 1),
during IGSC 16% treatment (n 5 2) and during IGSC 20%
administration (n 5 5)]. However, at no time was there a
concordance of other laboratory test (e.g. Coomb’s test,
haptoglobin, free haemoglobin, LDH, urine, haemosiderin)
results, indicating a diagnosis of haemolysis in those
patients.
Local reactions were the most common related AEs dur-
ing IGSC 20% treatment (0�0694 event/infusion; Table 4).
Overall, 35�4% of patients reported local AEs related to
IGSC 20% treatment during the study. In total 2228, of
2349 (94�8%) of IGSC 20% infusions were administered
without the occurrence of a causally related local AE. In
addition, the proportion of patients affected by a related
local AE decreased in the course of the study: at the begin-
ning of the study, 12�5% of patients experienced a local AE
related to IGSC 20% treatment; after infusion 4, related
local AEs occurred in 0–9% of patients. The rate of AEs/
patient-year over time is shown in Fig. 2. Of note, 79 of a
total of 162 causally related local AEs were reported in a
single patient (patient A) by the parent; all of them were
mild, and this patient/parent desired to continue and com-
pleted the study. In addition, the patient/parent expressed
preference for IGSC 20% over the other immunoglobulin
treatment options at the end of study. In a subanalysis
excluding related local AEs reported by this patient, the fre-
quency of local AEs related to IGSC 20% treatment was
low, with 0�036 event/infusion. Another patient, aged 16
years (patient B), experienced three local AEs of mild pain
assessed by the investigator as possibly (two) or probably
(one) related to IGSC 20% infusion and chose to discon-
tinue from the study due reportedly to pain during and
after administration. Both adolescent patients had been
receiving IGIV 10% during period 1.

 IGSC 20% administration characteristics
Patients received IGSC 20% at a mean [6 standard devia-
tion (s.d.)] weekly dose of 0�125 6 0�042 g/kg/week for a
median duration of 358 days (range 5 127�0–399). Dose
increase due to insufficient (5 g/l or below) trough levels
was required for two patients with CIVD. One of them was
a 65-year-old patient who was previously on a subcutane-
ous immunoglobulin dose at the lower end of the recom-
mended dose range, resulting in borderline IgG trough
levels. The other patient was a 17-year-old who showed a
persistent decrease in IgG trough levels despite increasing
the IGSC 20% dose several times. Concomitantly, this
patient developed an enlarged lymph node which was
examined histologically as a benign lymphoproliferation. A
total of 2346 infusions of IGSC 20% were administered
during the study, 74�1% (1740 of 2349) of which were at
home. Even patients who had transitioned to home care
were required per protocol to attend scheduled site visits,
and thereby received some infusions at the study site. For
95�8% of patients, at least one IGSC 20% infusion was per-
formed at home with or without professional assistance.
A maximum rate of � 40 ml/h/site was achieved by
41�6% of patients at least once and 22�3% of IGSC 20%
infusions were infused at this rate. Close to half the patients
(47�9%) received at least one infusion with a volume of
� 20 ml/site and this volume was infused per site in 31�8%
of infusions. The overall median number of sites/infusion
for administration of IGSC 20% was 2�0 (range 5 1–5);
among patients aged 2–5 years (n 5 5), a median of one
site/infusion (range 5 1–2) was used (Table 5). Most
(87%) of IGSC 20% infusions were administered in two or
fewer sites (two sites: 75�6% of infusions; one site: 11�4%).
Tolerability
The short-term tolerability of IGSC 20% treatment was
evaluated by recording infusions for which the infusion
rate had to be reduced, or the administration was inter-
rupted/stopped due to tolerability concerns or AEs. No
infusion rate reduction, administration interruption/stop-
page was required for 99�8% of IGSC 20% infusions. The
infusion rate had to be reduced in five (0�2%) IGSC 20%
infusions administered to two adolescent patients (patient
C, 12 years old and patient D, 13 years old). A comparison
of infusion characteristics for infusions that were and were
not associated with causally related AEs showed no correla-
tion between the infusion rates or higher infusion volume
per site and the incidence of related local AEs (Fig. 3a,b).
Therefore, the selection of relatively lower infusion rates
and volumes per site compared with the allowed maxi-
mums per protocol was due to patient and/or physician
preference rather than tolerability limitations.
Pharmacokinetic parameters and serum IgG trough
levels
The PK profile of serum IgG in the course of IGSC 20%
treatment is depicted in Fig. 4. Following IGSC 20% infu-
sion there was no peak in serum IgG levels when com-
pared to the pre-infusion levels (day 0), and IgG levels
remained constant throughout the treatment interval
(range 5 9�0–9�4 g/l). PK parameters of IGSC 20%
administration are summarized in Table 6. The bioavaila-
bility of IGSC 20% relative to IGIV 10% was 82�07%
(90% CI 5 77–88%), as determined from the ratio of the
geometric means for the respective AUCs. Serum IgG
trough values measured for 6 consecutive weeks of weekly
IGSC 20% treatment (weeks 21–27) attained a median of
8�48 g/l (range 5 5�17; 13�25). At the end of the IGSC
20% treatment period the median serum IgG trough level
was 8�26 (range 5 4�27–15�87; Table 7). At the end of
period 1, the median serum IgG trough levels attained
7�45g/l (range 5 4�27–12�75) in patients who received
IGIV 10% every 4 weeks and 9�53 g/l (range 5 5�41–
12�28) in patients treated with IGSC 16% once every week
(Table 7).
Patient experience
For the LQI that evaluated treatment burden related to Ig
therapy and for the patient quality-of-life questionnaires
(PEDS_QL, SF-36, and EQ-5D Health), no statistically
significant score change was observed between start of
period 2 and the ‘end-of-study’ visit; however, results of
the EQ-5D health indicated a trend towards improve-
ment for all age groups (2–11 years, observer: parent; 12
years and older, observer: patient). With the PEDS_QL

patients stated that they would choose to continue receiv-
ing IGSC 20% treatment over other treatments (Fig. 5).
Patient A (who reported almost half of the total adverse
reactions in the study) and patients C and D (in whom
the infusion rate had to be reduced) also preferred IGSC
20% treatment. Both younger and older age groups were
consistent in their desire to continue treatment with
IGSC 20%: 21 of 25 (84�0%) of patients �13 years and 21
of 23 (91�3%) of patients > 13 years preferred IGSC 20%

20% treatment.
Discussion
While immunoglobulin replacement therapy administered
by the s.c. or the i.v. route is similarly safe and efficient,
IGSC may be of particular interest to patients prone to sys-
temic adverse reactions during IGIV therapy or patients
preferring self-infusion at home [4,5]. The primary disad-
vantage of IGSC compared to IGIV preparations is the lim-
ited volume that can be infused at a slow rate to each s.c.
site. A highly concentrated IgG formulation such as the
IGSC 20% product investigated in this study would offer
patients with PIDD a new replacement therapy option with
fewer infusion sites and shorter infusion durations com-
pared with other conventional IGSC products.
In this trial, weekly IGSC 20% treatment at monthly
doses equivalent to those administered with IGIV 10% or
IGSC 16%, was efficacious in preventing infections. The
annualized rate of VASBIs per patient during IGSC 20%
was low and significantly below the level defined by the
FDA [17] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
Guidelines [23,24] to demonstrate efficacy. Consistent with
the protective effect of IGSC 20% in patients with PIDD,
the annualized incidence of any infections (4�38 events/
patient) in this trial was comparable to the annualized fre-
quency of any infection reported with a licensed IGSC 20%
preparation (5�18 events/patient-year) [25] and with other
less concentrated IGSC preparations: 3�946 events/patient
in a 6-month study with IGSC 16% [26] or 4�1 events/
patient with an IGSC 10% product [27], although the
validity of direct comparison may be impaired by differen-
ces in study designs and product concentrations. Moreover,
the annualized rates of days on antibiotics (18�1 days/
patient) was approximately four times lower than with
another IGSC 20% product in an EU study (72�75 days/
patient) [25]. These results, and the outcomes of additional
assessments (e.g. days out of school/work; number and
duration of hospitalization) establish the efficacy of IGSC
20% in PIDD patients.
To confer protection against infections in PIDD, serum
IgG trough levels of > 5 g/l are generally accepted as the
required minimum threshold; for some patients, trough

 levels of at least 7 g/l may be necessary [25–27]. Consistent
with the positive efficacy outcome in this trial, median serum
IgG trough levels remained above 8 g/l throughout IGSC
20% treatment. The median weekly dose per BW necessary
to achieve protective IgG trough levels (0�125 g/kg BW/week)
was comparable to doses reported in EU studies conducted
with another IGSC 20% product (0�119 g/kg BW/week and
0�156 g/kg BW/week, respectively) [25,28].
The bioavailability of the investigated IGSC 20% prod-
uct relative to IGIV 10% was assessed as 82% (90%
CI 5 77–88%). In general, available conventional subcuta-
neous immunoglobulin preparations have a bioavailability
that has been estimated to vary from 65 to 69% [29]. The
bioavailability of the new IGSC 20%, calculated as the ratio
of the geometric mean of AUC with IGSC 20% over that
with IGIV 10%, appears to be higher. This may be due
partly to differences in drug composition; however, the
mechanisms modulating the bioavailability of SC adminis-
tered immunoglobulin preparations are not yet well under-
stood and require further research [30–33].
In comparison to IGIV, s.c. administration of Ig is gener-
ally associated with a lower incidence of systemic side-effects
but a higher rate of causally related local AEs [34]. In the
present trial, the rate of any AEs assessed as related to IGSC
20% was low (systemic: 0�032 event/infusion; local: 0.036
event/infusion -excluding one patient who was reported to
experience almost half of the total causally related local
adverse
events-
or
0�069
event/infusion, including
all
patients). The incidence of local AEs related to IGSC 20%
was similar to rates observed with a licensed IGSC 20% prep-
aration in an EU study (0�058 event/infusion) [25], and was
much lower than rates observed in studies conducted in the
United States (0�592 event/infusion) [35] and Japan (0�274
event/infusion) [36]. While a unique 13-year-old patient
reported 48�8% of all the related local AEs associated with

 IGSC 20% administration, this patient still completed the
study and expressed a preference to remain on IGSC 20%
treatment post-study. One other patient withdrew from the
study because of mild local reactions of pain related to IGSC
20% treatment. None of the causally related local AEs was
severe; the vast majority (98�8%) was of mild severity. More
than half (64�6%) the patients did not experience any related
local AEs and 94�8% of IGSC 20% infusions were not associ-
ated with any causally related local AE. IGSC 20% treatment
was well tolerated overall: none of the infusions had to be
interrupted or stopped due to AEs or tolerability concerns,
and only 0�2% of IGSC 20% infusions required a reduction
of infusion rate. Of note, the investigated IGSC 20% is stabi-
lized with glycine and has an osmolality within the physio-
logical plasma range; these factors may contribute to its high
degree of tolerability compared to immunoglobulin products
for subcutaneous administration using other stabilizers and/
or with an osmolality outside of the physiological range
[37,38]
The high concentration of IGSC 20% resulted in smaller
infusion volumes and the favourable tolerability profile
enabled the infusion of comparatively large volumes per
site at high rates. More than a third of patients achieved a
maximum infusion rate of 40 ml/h/site to 60 ml/l/site,
yet all IGSC 20% infusions were administered without
interruption or stopping, indicating good overall tolerabil-
ity of IGSC 20% at least equivalent to the tolerability
observed with a similar licensed IGSC 20% product [25].
The possibility that the favourable tolerability of increased
infusion rates was related to the amount of subcutaneous
adipose tissue is unlikely, as 69% of patients had a body
mass index below 25 kg/m2.
As a result of the well-tolerated high infusion rates, infu-
sion duration was reduced and fewer infusion sites were
required compared to other conventional s.c. products.
The median duration of IGSC 20% infusion was 0�95 h,
which is shorter than the infusion duration reported for a
licensed IGSC 20% product in two studies, median
range 5 1�14–1�27 h in one study and mean 5 1�18 h in
the other [25,28]. A median of two infusion sites were used
to administer IGSC 20% in this study, which is lower than
the 3�3 (mean) infusion sites reported for a licensed IGSC

 as evidenced by the few discontinuations during IGSC
20% treatment: 93�8% patients (82% of the 2–< 18-
year-old patients) treated with IGSC 20% completed
the study, suggesting that IGSC 20% treatment inter-
fered minimally with daily activities of adults as well as
paediatric patients. Home-based therapy, chosen by a
large proportion (95�8%) of patients at least once and
performed for 74�0% of infusions overall, may have
facilitated adherence to treatment. Patients had a posi-
tive experience using IGSC 20% treatment: 87�5% of
patients affirmed their preference for IGSC 20% over
other antibody replacement treatments. Overall, patient-
centred outcomes indicated that PIDD patients pre-
ferred receiving s.c. replacement therapy, in line with
reports from other studies (reviewed in [5]).
In conclusion, IGSC 20% administered s.c. was safe
and well tolerated in patients with PIDD. The efficacy
of IGSC 20% treatment after a dose equivalent switch
from previous Ig treatment was demonstrated by the
low frequency of infections and the maintenance of
protective serum IgG trough levels. The positive toler-
ability profile made infusion of IGSC 20% treatment at
high rates possible, and its highly concentrated formu-
lation allowed smaller volumes for equivalent doses to
be given per administration. As a result, infusion dura-
tion was shortened and the number of infusion sites
was decreased compared with available conventional s.c.
preparations. The flexibility and convenience of IGSC
20% therapy were appreciated by patients, suggesting
that IGSC 20% would be a valuable alternative treat-
ment option for patients with PIDD.

Fig. 5. Patients who chose to continue with immunoglobulin (Ig)
treatment administered subcutaneously (IGSC) 20% at the end of the
study. Treatment preference was analysed separately for the age groups 2–
13 years (observer: parent) and 14 years and older (observer: patient) at
the ‘end-of-study’ visit (n5 48). Plotted are the number of patients who
declared that they would continue with immunoglobulin (Ig) treatment
administered subcutaneously (IGSC) 20% treatment (black bar) and the
number of patients who would choose an alternative IgG replacement
therapy (grey bar); the proportion of subjects in each category (%) is
indicated above the bars.
