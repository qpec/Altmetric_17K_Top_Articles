ABSTRACT: Cannabidiol is the nonpsychoactive natural
component of C. sativa that has been shown to be
neuroprotective in multiple animal models. Our interest is to
advance a therapeutic candidate for the orphan indication
hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE is a serious neurological
disorder that occurs in patients with cirrhosis or liver failure.
Although cannabidiol is effective in models of HE, it has
limitations in terms of safety and oral bioavailability. Herein,
we describe a series of side chain modified resorcinols that
were designed for greater hydrophilicity and “drug likeness”, while varying hydrogen bond donors, acceptors, architecture,
basicity, neutrality, acidity, and polar surface area within the pendent group. Our primary screen evaluated the ability of the test
agents to prevent damage to hippocampal neurons induced by ammonium acetate and ethanol at clinically relevant
concentrations. Notably, KLS-13019 was 50-fold more potent and >400-fold safer than cannabidiol and exhibited an in vitro
profile consistent with improved oral bioavailability.
KEYWORDS: neuroprotection, cannabidiol, hepatic encephalopathy
H
epatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric
disorder that includes learning deficits and impairment
of long-term memory. If left unchecked, HE can progress to
hepatic coma and ultimately death.1 The pathogenesis of HE
includes damage to the prelimbic cortex, striatum, and the
hippocampus.2 Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by accumu-
lation of toxic substances in the bloodstream that are normally
removed by the liver. It has been previously demonstrated that
impairment of hepatocytes by ethanol is associated with the
production of free radical and oxidative stress.3 The
accumulation of these free radicals and oxidative stress
contribute to cognitive impairment, learning deficits, memory
impairment, as well as damage and death of neuronal tissue. An
emerging concept is that blockade of free radical mediated
stress and oxidative stress will prevent the neural damage
associated with hepatic encephalopathy and prevent cognitive
impairment, learning deficits, memory impairment, as well as
damage and death of neuronal tissue associated with HE.
Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to be neuroprotective
by blocking the damage caused by free radicals and oxidative
stress.4 This effect was independent of cannabinoid receptors
because it could not be blocked by a cannabinoid antagonist.
CBD is effective in two animal models of HE, thioacetamide
induced5 and bile duct ligation induced6 liver damage, at a dose
of 5 mg/kg ip. Importantly, CBD treated animals in the first
study exhibited improvements in both liver and brain function
as compared to untreated control animals. Free radical
mediated stress and oxidative stress are also known to
contribute to additional pathological conditions including
epilepsy, neuropathic pain, traumatic head injury, stroke,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and neurodegener-
ative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Other examples of neuroprotection by CBD include use in
hypoxia-ischemia7 and stroke8 models. A wide range of possible
mechanisms have been attributed for CBD’s neuroprotective
effects including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, adenosine
signaling, cannabinoid receptor GPR55, and serotonin
mediated pathways;9 however, mitochondrial calcium modu-
lation is fundamental.10 To hedge our bets, we chose to
interrogate the hippocampal neuron, as a phenotypic screen
that will measure neuroprotection independent of a mecha-
nism. We chose to use either ammonia (300 μM) or ethanol
(30 mM) as toxins at therapeutic relevant concentrations.
Blood levels of ammonia in grade IV HE patients range from
150 to 300 μM,11 while heavy drinkers can reach 50 mM
ethanol levels (legal limit is 17 mM). Neuronal viability and cell
death are monitored in each experiment using the dyes
carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) and propidium iodide
(PI), respectively. Any of our new molecules that demonstrated

 increased potency relative to cannabidiol were evaluated for
CB1 affinity to rule out potential for psychotropic side effects.
CBD is a small molecule that violates only one of Lipinski’s
rules; it has excessive lipophilicity (cLogP = 6.3). Our design
concept was to identify a region of the molecule that could
provide novelty and greater hydrophilicity without restoring
CB1 affinity. It is known that even minor structural changes to
(−)-CBD (natural form) can impart potent CB1 affinity
(Figure1). In fact, CBD’s (+)-enantiomer 2,12 cyclohexyl
resorcinol 3, and aromatic phenol counterpart 4 are CB1
ligands.13 For these reasons we chose to leave the resorcinol
and cyclohexene rings alone and introduce hydrophilicity on
the five carbon side chain of CBD. Very little chemistry had
been reported with heteroatoms in this region, and it was
hoped that more water-soluble molecules would have
advantages in terms of permeability and bioavailability.
A group of target molecules were chosen for synthesis (Table
1), which had greater hydrophilicity and contained a variety of
heteroatom or heterocycle substituted side chains to replace the
five carbon side chain of CBD. Care was taken to introduce as
little steric bulk as possible, while exploring diversity of
functional groups and pKas. The cLogP values for the target
compounds in Table 1 are all lower than 5 (calculated in the
Collaborative Drug Discovery Vault database). Polar surface
area for CBD (40 Å2) is low, while the other target molecules
had PSA (43 to 78 Å2) in an acceptable range for CNS
penetration.14 Compounds 7 and 8 are known metabolites15−17
of CBD that we wanted to test side by side with CBD because
the metabolites could contribute to CBD’s neuroprotective
effects in vivo.
The synthesis of target molecule 16 is described in detail for
illustrative purposes (Scheme1). The synthesis began by
alkylating triphenylphosphine with benzyl bromide 19.
Reaction of the Wittig ylide of 20 with the azetidine carbonyl
21 afforded the olefin 22, which was conveniently reduced with
hydrogen under atmospheric pressure. The Boc-group was
removed with TFA and replaced with an acetyl group to deliver
25 in good yield. The methyl ethers were removed with boron
tribromide with careful reaction monitoring to generate the key
resorcinol intermediate 26. The substituted resorcinol 26 was
coupled to (1S,4R)-4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol
(6) under acidic (BF3-Et2O) conditions similar to what was
described in the literature.18 Each coupling reaction was
optimized using various acids (p-TsOH, BF3-Et2O,
CF3SO3H), solvents, and reaction times to maximize
production of desired product by alkylation of resorcinol at
the 2-position. In most cases, the reaction was terminated prior
to consumption of starting material as to minimize byproducts
and to simplify purification. The desired product 16 was
obtained in low yield (13%) accompanied by a roughly
equivalent amount of the 4-regioisomer 27 (17%). The desired
product was obtained in variable yields (2−25%, Table 1). The
resorcinols were derived from 3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (7,
8, 14), 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-acetic acid (9, 10, 11, 12, 13),
or 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (15, 17, 18). CBD (1) was
prepared from olivitol using the same method, and its optical
rotation was consistent with the literature ([α]D = −125),19
[α]D
22 = −121.4 (c 1.00, EtOH). This gave us confidence that
our couplings were proceeding with high stereoselectivity.
Compound 17 was made by reduction of 18 with lithium
aluminum hydride. Complete experimental details and
analytical data (LC/MS, 1H NMR) for the compounds are
included in the Supporting Information.
Dissociated hippocampal cultures derived from embryonic
day 18 rats were employed as the primary screening system to
test for toxicity responses as well as neuroprotective actions. All
compounds were assessed in both ethanol- and ammonium
acetate-induced neurotoxicity assays and monitored with both
dyes (CFDA and PI), as measures of viability and cell death,
respectively. Full efficacy was defined as the fluorescence
measure of a neuron in absence of toxin. All compounds were
screened with N = 5 at each test concentration and their EC50
value determined (Table 1). For compounds of highest interest
(Table 2), the EC50 ± SE was determined from three replicate
experiments with N = 5 for each experiment. Cell viability and
cell death were typically affected at similar concentrations. For
example CBD (1) showed EC50 values in the 1 to 4 μM range
in the two assays using two readouts (Table 1). However, CBD
has a narrow therapeutic index in that it is neurotoxic by itself
at 33 μM. It was hoped that therapeutic index (CBD TI, TC50/
EC50 = 16, Table 2) could be improved in new compounds,

 while showing broad neuroprotection like CBD. The hydroxyl
metabolite 7 was mostly inactive at 100 μM, while the
carboxylic acid 8 was two- to 10-fold less potent than CBD.
The ether (9) was expected to behave similarly to CBD, in that
it varies only in one heavy atom. It had similar potency in
viability assessment after ethanol (EC50 = 0.3−3 μM) but was
variably effective against ammonium acetate (EC50 = 0.2−36
μM). The triazole 10 demonstrated a more consistent efficacy

 across all conditions conditions (EC50 = 1 to 5 μM), with
similar potency to CBD. Interestingly, the regioisomer 11 was
inactive up to 100 μM. The morpholino amide (12),
morpholino alkyl (13), and acetyl amide (14) derivatives
were largely ineffective. Dramatic results were shown with the
four-membered ring derivatives 15 to 18. Whereas the oxetane
(15) was weakly effective, the methyl azetidine (17) was toxic.
However, the acyl (16) and ethoxylformyl (18) azetidines were
unexpectedly potent with EC50 values ranging from 20 to 110
nM. We did evaluate some of the 4-regioisomers and found
little or no activity (e.g., 27, EC50 > 100 μM).
The three most active molecules 10, 16, and 18 were further
profiled in comparison to the CBD (1) in Table 2. CBD has a
limited therapeutic index of 16 when comparing its toxic dose
with its effective dose in the ammonium acetate toxicity model
with CFDA readout. Therefore, the new molecules were
evaluated for any decrease in neuronal viability at concen-
trations above their EC50. None of the test agents exhibited
toxicity up to 100 μM, and compound 16 was only toxic at 300
μM giving it a therapeutic index of 7500. Compound 18 also
demonstrated a much improved safety margin. None of the
new molecules exhibited CB1 affinity at 10 μM, but 16 and 18
showed modest affinity for CB2. Kinetic aqueous solubility was
improved for the triazole 10 and azetidine 16, but not for 18.
All three new molecules showed great improvements in
permeability in both CACO and MDCK MDR1 cell lines
with no efflux potential.
Compound 16 (KLS-13019) was selected for further
characterization based on its overall improved properties
relative to CBD (1) in potency, safety, aqueous solubility,
and permeability. The complete in vitro and in vivo work up on
this lead candidate will reported in due course.
