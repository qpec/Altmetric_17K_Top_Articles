BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the leading preventable cause of 
premature death worldwide. We examined global disparities of hypertension 
prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in 2010 and compared 
secular changes from 2000 to 2010.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE from 1995 through 2014 and 
supplemented with manual searches of retrieved article references. 
We included 135 population-based studies of 968 
419 adults from 90 
countries. Sex- and age-specific hypertension prevalences from each 
country were applied to population data to calculate regional and global 
numbers of hypertensive adults. Proportions of awareness, treatment, and 
control from each country were applied to hypertensive populations to 
obtain regional and global estimates.
RESULTS: In 2010, 31.1% (95% confidence interval, 30.0%–32.2%) of 
the world’s adults had hypertension; 28.5% (27.3%–29.7%) in high-income 
countries and 31.5% (30.2%–32.9%) in low- and middle-income countries. 
An estimated 1.39 (1.34–1.44) billion people had hypertension in 2010: 
349 (337–361) million in high-income countries and 1.04 (0.99–1.09) 
billion in low- and middle-income countries. From 2000 to 2010, the 
age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased by 2.6% in 
high-income countries, but increased by 7.7% in low- and middle-income 
countries. During the same period, the proportions of awareness (58.2% 
versus 67.0%), treatment (44.5% versus 55.6%), and control (17.9% 
versus 28.4%) increased substantially in high-income countries, whereas 
awareness (32.3% versus 37.9%) and treatment (24.9% versus 29.0%) 
increased less, and control (8.4% versus 7.7%) even slightly decreased in 
low- and middle-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Global hypertension disparities are large and increasing. 
Collaborative efforts are urgently needed to combat the emerging 
hypertension burden in low- and middle-income countries.

h
ypertension is an important global health challenge 
because of its high prevalence and resulting car-
diovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.1–3 
Hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for 
premature death and disability worldwide.3 Previous work 
estimated that 26.4% of the global adult population, or 972 
million people, had hypertension in 2000.1 Since 2000, na-
tional reports have indicated that the prevalence of hyper-
tension is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, 
but it is steady or decreasing in high-income countries.4–10 
These data suggest a widening health disparity in hyperten-
sion prevalence worldwide. Current estimates of the global 
burden of hypertension in high-income and low- and middle-
income countries are needed to better understand this im-
portant public health concern.
Treatment and control of hypertension are critically 
important for the prevention of consequent cardiovascu-
lar and kidney diseases.11 The proportions of hyperten-
sion awareness, treatment, and control that have been 
reported across many countries vary substantially.6,11–16 
However, these data have not been systematically ana-
lyzed to provide pooled estimates in world regions with 
diverse economic development.
The goal of this study is to examine the global dispari-
ties of hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, 
and control by world regions with different levels of eco-
nomic development in 2010, and to compare secular 
changes in the disparities of hypertension prevalence, 
awareness, treatment, and control from 2000 to 2010 
worldwide. Understanding health disparities in hyper-
tension prevalence and control among world regions 
is important for developing global strategies to better 
prevent and control hypertension through collaborative 
national and international efforts.
MethODs
Complete methods are available in the online-only Data 
Supplement. In brief, MEDLINE was searched for studies pub-
lished from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2014, and addi-
tional studies were identified by manual review of references 
cited in reviews, meta-analyses, and original studies. Country-
specific searches of the World Health Organization Global 
Infobase were also conducted.17 Eligibility criteria for inclusion 
were as follows: (1) population-based cross-sectional study in 
adults aged ≥20 years that reported sex-specific prevalence 
of hypertension; (2) blood pressure measurement methods 
were standardized; and (3) hypertension was defined as aver-
age systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm 
Hg, average diastolic 
blood pressure ≥90 mm 
Hg, or use of antihypertensive medi-
cation. If nationally representative studies were available, they 
were used; otherwise, data from the largest and most recent 
multisite or regional study were used. If multiple regional or 
multisite studies were available for a given country, they were 
pooled by using sex-specific random-effects meta-regression 
models to obtain age- and sex-specific prevalence and variance 
estimates for each country. Studies were included in the 2010 
hypertension analysis if data collection took place from 2005 
to 2014. Studies with data collection from 1995 to 2004 were 
used in the 2000 hypertension analysis. A total of 131 reports 
(135 studies) from 90 countries were included in the analy-
ses (Figure 1). Literature searches, study selection, and data 
abstraction were conducted independently and in duplicate by 
3 investigators (K.T.M., J.D.B., J.E.R.), with a standardized pro-
tocol and data-collection form. The prevalence of prehyperten-
sion, defined as blood pressure between 120/80 mm 
Hg and 
140/90 mm 
Hg, was also abstracted but was reported by so 
few publications that it was not included in the analyses. Any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Study authors were 
contacted to request additional information when necessary.
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Globally, 31.1% of the adult population (1.39 
billion people) had hypertension in 2010.
• Hypertension prevalence is higher in low- and 
middle-income countries (31.5%) than in high-
income countries (28.5%).
• Approximately 75% of people with hyperten-
sion (1.04 billion) live in low- and middle-income 
countries.
• Hypertension awareness, treatment, and con-
trol are much lower in low- and middle-income 
than in high-income countries.
• From 2000 to 2010, the hypertension preva-
lence in high-income countries decreased by 
2.6%, and awareness, treatment, and control 
improved substantially. During the same 10-year 
period, low- and middle-income countries saw 
a 7.7% prevalence increase and little improve-
ment in awareness, treatment, and control.
What are the clinical implications?
• These data document large and widening 
global disparities in hypertension prevalence 
and control.
• Collaborative efforts from national and inter-
national stakeholders are urgently needed to 
combat the emerging hypertension burden in 
low- and middle-income countries.
• Our findings call for global and local stake-
holders to promote blood pressure screening, 
access to affordable health care and antihyper-
tensive medications, and adherence to antihy-
pertensive treatment to improve hypertension 
control in low- and middle-income countries.
• Implementation of innovative, cost-effective, 
and sustainable programs for hypertension 
prevention and control should be a public 
health priority for these countries.

Proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment, and 
control were abstracted from all reports included in the 2000 
and 2010 prevalence analyses. Hypertension awareness 
and treatment are defined as self-reported previous diagno-
sis of hypertension and self-reported use of antihypertensive 
medications among those with hypertension, respectively. 
Hypertension control is defined as systolic blood pressure 
<140 mm 
Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm 
Hg among 
hypertensive patients or among treated hypertensive patients. 
Data from 61 countries were used to estimate regional and 
global proportions of hypertension awareness, treatment, and 
control.
Countries were grouped into regions using the World Bank 
classification system updated in July 2014, which groups the 
high-income countries into 1 region and the low- and middle- 
income countries into 6 geographic regions.18 The included 
regions were: High-Income Economies, East Asia and Pacific, 
Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, 
Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and sub-Saharan 
Africa. For countries without valid estimates for 2010 or 2000 
prevalence, awareness, treatment, or control, 3 countries that 
are the most similar in terms of gross national income and 
geographic proximity to each country with missing data were 
selected, and multiple imputation was performed to estimate 
the sex- and age-specific prevalence and variance of each 
country without data (multiple imputation details in online-only 
Data Supplement Methods).19
For studies that did not report prevalence data in the 
10-year age groups of interest (20–29, 30–39, etc), age-spe-
cific prevalence was imputed using logistic regression models 
for each sex in each region, separately. The predictive mod-
els of the relationship between age group and prevalence of 
hypertension were generated from studies with age-specific 
data within each region-sex subgroup. In addition, mean age 
and prevalence for men and women from each study with miss-
ing age-specific prevalence were used to calibrate the esti-
mates of age-specific prevalence for that country. The pseudo 
R-squared values (ranging from 0.46 to 0.92, all P<0.001) 
indicated good fit of all logistic regression models.
statistical analysis
To estimate the 2010 hypertension prevalence and absolute 
burden, defined as the number of adults with hypertension, 
by world region, sex- and age-specific prevalences of hyper-
tension for each country were applied to the 2010 United 
Nations sex- and age-specific population counts to estimate 
the number of people with hypertension in the country for 
each sex and age group.20 The total number of persons with 
hypertension in each country was summed to provide an esti-
mate of the total number of persons with hypertension for 
each region by sex and age groups, and the number from 
each region was added to obtain the worldwide count. The 
sex- and age-specific regional prevalences of hypertension 
for 2010 were calculated by dividing the total number of peo-
ple with hypertension in each region by the number of people 
living in that region for each sex and age group. Worldwide 
prevalence was estimated by dividing the total number of per-
sons with hypertension by the total adult world population. 
The prevalences of hypertension within each world region and 
worldwide were age standardized to the 2010 world popu-
lation using the direct method.21 A sensitivity analysis was 
conducted including only countries with reports of prevalence 
from both 2000 and 2010.
Standard errors for the prevalence of hypertension were 
abstracted from those studies that report them. For the remain-
ing studies, standard errors were estimated as the square root 
of ([hypertension prevalence×(1–hypertension prevalence)]/
study sample size), which may slightly overestimate the stan-
dard error for surveys using complex sampling designs. The 
standard errors for the number of persons with hypertension 
within a region and worldwide were then estimated with Taylor 
series approximation methods and used to calculate 95% 
confidence intervals.22 Differences between prevalence and

absolute burden estimates for 2000 and 2010 were tested by 
using a 2-tailed z test for the difference in proportions.
Regional and global prevalence of hypertension in 2000

resUlts
Of the 4751 articles identified by database and manual 
searching, 809 underwent full-text review and 131 ar-
ticles (135 studies) were included in the pooling anal-
yses. This included a total of 78 studies with a com-
bined sample size of 540 
890 participants included in 
the 2010 hypertension prevalence analysis (online-only 
Data Supplement Table I). These population-based stud-
ies (46 in nationally representative samples) collected 
hypertension prevalence data from 70 countries repre-
senting 79.1% of the global population ≥20 years old. 
The additional 57 studies from 45 countries represent-
ing 67.8% of the global population ≥20 years old with 
a combined sample size of 427 
529 were included in 
the 2000 hypertension prevalence analysis (online-only 
Data Supplement Table II). The proportions of hyperten-
sion awareness, treatment, and control were reported 
for 53 countries in the 2010 analysis and 20 countries 
in the 2000 analysis (online-only Data Supplement Tables 
III and IV). Sex-specific population estimates and crude 
prevalence estimates from each country are shown in 
online-only Data Supplement Tables V and VI.
Disparities in hypertension Prevalence and 
absolute Burden in 2010
The estimated global age-standardized prevalence of 
hypertension in adults aged ≥20 years in 2010 was 
31.1% (95% confidence interval, 30.0%–32.2%): 31.9% 
(30.3%–33.5%) in men and 30.1% (28.5%–31.6%) in 
women. The age-standardized prevalence of hyper-
tension was 28.5% (27.3%–29.7%) in high-income 
countries (31.6% [29.6%–33.6%] in men and 25.3% 
[23.9%–26.7%] in women) and 31.5% (30.2%–32.9%) 
in low- and middle-income countries (31.7% [29.7%–
33.6%] in men and 31.2% [29.3%–33.1%] in women) 
(Table 1). The P value for the difference in prevalence 
between high-income and low-and middle-income coun-
tries is 0.001. Prevalence estimates in 2010 by world 
region are presented in online-only Data Supplement 
Table VII.
An estimated 1.39 billion (1.34–1.44 billion) adults 
aged ≥20 years worldwide had hypertension, 694 million 
(659–730 million) men and 694 million (660–727 million) 
women, in 2010. Almost 3 times as many individuals 
with hypertension lived in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (1.04 billion [0.99–1.09 billion]) than in high-income 
countries (349 million [337–361 million]). In high-income 
countries, the greatest absolute burden was in older age 
groups (eg, ≥60 years), whereas in low- and middle-in-
come countries the greatest absolute burden was in the 
middle age groups (eg, 40–59 years) (Table 1).
Disparities in the hypertension Prevalence 
changes from 2000 to 2010
The global age-standardized prevalence of hypertension 
was 25.9% (24.6%–27.1%) in adults aged ≥20 years 
in 2000 (online-only Data Supplement Table VIII). From 
2000 to 2010, there was an increase in hypertension 
prevalence of 5.2% over 10 years. This increase was 
consistent in men and women, who had an age-standard-
ized hypertension prevalence of 26.4% (24.6%–28.2%) 
and 25.1% (23.4%–26.9%) in 2000, respectively. The 
hypertension prevalence decreased 2.6% in high-income 
countries from 31.1% (27.7%–34.5%) in 2000, where-
as the prevalence increased 7.7% in low- and middle-
income countries from 23.8% (22.6%–25.1%) in 2000.

The absolute burden of hypertension in 2000 was 921 
million (874–968 million) with 322 million (292–353 mil-
lion) in high-income countries and 599 million (563–634 
million) in low- and middle-income countries. Globally, the 
number of individuals with hypertension has increased 
by 466.8 million since 2000, with a 26.6 million increase 
in high-income countries and a 440.1 million increase 
in low- and middle-income countries (online-only Data 
Supplement Table VIII).
Figure 2 shows the age- and sex-standardized prev-
alence of hypertension by country in 2010 and 2000 
(crude prevalence shown in online-only Data Supple-
ment Figure I and a map with imputed countries left 
blank shown in online-only Data Supplement Figure 
II). In 2010, the highest prevalence for men was in 
Europe and Central Asia and that for women was in 
sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the lowest prevalence 
for men was in South Asia and that for women was 
in High-Income Economies (Figure 3). The prevalence 
of hypertension increased in East Asia and Pacific, 
Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-
Saharan Africa for both men and women, and in Eu-
rope and Central Asia for men, whereas it decreased 
in High-Income Economies and the Middle East and 
North Africa for both men and women, and in Europe 
and Central Asia for women.
In 2010, the East Asia and Pacific region had the 
greatest absolute burden of hypertension with 439 mil-
lion people with hypertension, and the Middle East and 
North Africa region had the lowest absolute burden of 
hypertension (Figure 4). The absolute burden of hyper-
tension increased in every world region for both men and 
women between 2000 and 2010, with the exception of 
women in the Middle East and North Africa, where there 
was a decrease in absolute burden. The greatest in-
creases in the absolute burden of hypertension occurred 
in East Asia and Pacific, where there are an additional 
108.0 million men and 95.1 million women with hyper-
tension in comparison with 2000.
In a sensitivity analysis including only 26 countries 
(11 in high-income countries and 16 in low- and middle-
income countries) with prevalence data from both 2000 
and 2010, similar results to those from the primary anal-
yses were obtained (online-only Data Supplement Table 
IX). For example, the global prevalence of hypertension 
was 30.8% (29.2%–32.5%): 28.1% (24.7%–31.6%) in 
high-income countries and 31.3% (29.5%–33.1%) in 
low- and middle-income countries in 2010. The sensitiv-
ity analysis found a 4.9% increase in global prevalence, 
a 5.3% decrease in high-income countries, and an 8.1% 
increase in low- and middle-income countries between 
2000 and 2010.
Disparities in hypertension awareness, 
treatment, and control
In 2010, less than half (46.5%) of adults with hyperten-
sion were aware of their condition, 36.9% were treated 
with antihypertensive medication, and only 13.8% had 
their blood pressure controlled worldwide (Table 2). 
High-income countries had almost double the propor-
tions of awareness (67.0% versus 37.9%) and treat-
ment (55.6% versus 29.0%) and 4 times the proportion 
of control among patients with hypertension (28.4% ver-
sus 7.7%) in comparison with low- and middle income 
countries in 2010. From 2000 to 2010, the proportions

of awareness (58.2% versus 67.0%), treatment (44.5%

the same time period, the proportions of awareness 
(32.3% versus 37.9%) and treatment (24.9% versus 
29.0%) increased much less and the proportion of con-
trol even slightly decreased (8.4% versus 7.7%) in low- 
and middle-income countries.

DiscUssiOn
Our study is the first systematic analysis of global health 
disparities in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treat-
ment, and control. It provides novel insights into several 
aspects of the global challenge of hypertension. First, our 
study showed that the age-standardized prevalence of hy-
pertension was higher in low- and middle-income countries 
(31.5%) than in high-income countries (28.5%) worldwide 
(P value for the difference=0.001). In addition, approxi-
mately three-quarters of individuals with hypertension lived 
in low- and middle-income countries. Second, our study 
showed that the prevalence of hypertension decreased by 
2.6% in high-income countries but increased by 7.7% in 
low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2010. The 
absolute burden of hypertension increased by 440.1 mil-
lion in low- and middle-income countries in comparison with 
only 26.6 million in high-income countries over a decade. 
The rapid increase in the absolute burden of hypertension 
in low- and middle-income countries is most likely attribut-
able to both increasing prevalence and substantial popula-
tion growth. Third, our study indicated that the proportions 
of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were 
much lower in low- and middle-income countries than in 
high-income countries. Over the past decade, hyperten-
sion awareness, treatment, and control increased sub-
stantially in high-income countries, whereas there was less 
improvement in low- and middle-income countries. These 
data document large and widening global disparities in hy-
pertension prevalence and control.
The high and increasing worldwide burden of hyper-
tension is a major global health challenge because it 
increases morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular 
and kidney diseases and financial costs to society.3 Our 
study indicated that 31.1% of the global population, or 
1.4 billion people, had hypertension in 2010. It has been 
estimated that substantial stroke and ischemic heart dis-
ease morbidity and mortality worldwide are attributable 
to hypertension.2,3 Ischemic heart disease and stroke 
are the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting 
for 14.6 million, or 1 in 4, deaths globally in 2013.23 
Without effective intervention, the increasing burden of 
hypertension will only exacerbate the global epidemic of 
cardiovascular and kidney diseases, especially in low- 
and middle-income countries.
Although hypertension prevalence has decreased in 
high-income countries, it has increased in low- and mid-
dle-income countries. As a result, the prevalence of hy-
pertension in low- and middle-income countries has sur-
passed that in high-income countries for the first time. 
The estimated 73.5% relative increase in the absolute 
number of hypertensive individuals from 599 million in 
2000 to 1.0 billion in 2010 in low- and middle-income 
countries is worrisome, because these countries are 
still experiencing infectious diseases and have limited 
healthcare resources.24 The greatest increases in abso-
lute burden of hypertension were observed in East Asia 
and Pacific, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, which 
have experienced both increases in hypertension prev-
alence and in population size.6,7,24 Aging and urbaniza-
tion with accompanying unhealthy lifestyle may play a 
role in the epidemic of hypertension in low- and middle-
income countries.25 Primary prevention through lifestyle 
modifications, including increased physical activity,

maintenance of normal body weight, limited alcohol con-
sumption, reduction of salt intake, increased potassium 
intake, and consumption of a diet high in fruits, vegeta-
bles, and low-fat dairy products, and low in saturated 
and total fat, should be the first choice for combating the 
emerging epidemic of hypertension in low- and middle-
income countries.26 The primary prevention approach 
must be complemented by intensive antihypertensive 
pharmaceutical treatment of hypertensive patients to re-
duce blood pressure–related cardiovascular disease and 
premature death, which is likely to be cost-effective in 
both high-income and middle-income countries.27–29
Danaei and colleagues4 estimated global trends in 
population mean systolic blood pressure among adults 
aged ≥25 years between 1980 and 2008. They report-
ed a nonsignificant decrease in population mean sys-
tolic blood pressure worldwide. Specifically, men and 
women in Australasia, North America, and Western Eu-
rope had large systolic blood pressure decreases. Con-
versely, systolic blood pressure rose in Oceania, East 
Africa, and South and Southeast Asia for both sexes, 
and in West Africa for women. In their study, however, 
data on the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and 
control of hypertension were not collected. Our study 
has focused on the prevalence and control of hyper-
tension, which have important public health and clinical 
relevance. The recent SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure 
Intervention Trial) trial provided evidence for the benefits 
of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 120 
mm 
Hg instead of 140 mm 
Hg.30 Should future clinical 
guidelines recommend treating to a target lower than 
140 mm 
Hg based on these study findings, the preva-
lence of uncontrolled hypertension will be even greater 
than reported here.
The current study identified substantial disparities in 
hypertension awareness, treatment, and control with 
high-income countries having approximately twice the 
proportions of awareness and treatment and 4 times 
the control rate in comparison with low- and middle-
income countries. In addition, our results showed that 
the proportions of awareness, treatment, and control 
improved in high-income countries between 2000 and 
2010, but no substantial improvement was observed 
in low- and middle-income countries. These results are 
consistent with those from the PURE (Prospective Ur-
ban Rural Epidemiology) study that also reported high-
er proportions of awareness, treatment, and control in 
high-income countries than in low- and middle-income 
countries.16 Clinical trials have demonstrated that an-
tihypertensive treatment lowers the risk of coronary 
heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and all-
cause mortality among patients with hypertension.31,32 
Antihypertensive treatment played an important role 
in the reduction of cardiovascular mortality in the 
United States and other high-income countries over 
the past several decades.33,34 Improving hypertension 
control should be a priority to achieve the UN Millennium 
Development Goals for noncommunicable diseases in 
low- and middle-income countries.35,36
Our findings suggest that, although the efficacy and 
effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihyper-
tensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention of 
hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease 
have been demonstrated in randomized controlled tri-
als, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied 
in populations living in low- and middle-income coun-
tries. Many barriers at the healthcare system, health 
care provider, and patient levels are likely impeding the 
prevention and control of hypertension, such as lack 
of access to care, costly medications, overburdened 
healthcare providers, lack of treatment guideline adher-
ence, low patient health literacy, and adverse side ef-
fects.37 There is an urgent need to identify innovative 
strategies to overcome these barriers and to deliver 
effective interventions for the prevention and control of 
hypertension in populations in low- and middle-income 
countries.38 Our findings call for collaborative efforts 
from global and local stakeholders to promote blood 
pressure screening, access to affordable health care 
and antihypertensive medications, and adherence to an-
tihypertensive treatment to improve hypertension con-
trol in low- and middle-income countries.
There are several limitations inherent in this study. 
The quality of our analysis depends on the quality and 
availability of original studies that provided hypertension 
data. Specific quality characteristics included differ-
ences in population-sampling strategies, blood pressure 
measurement methods, such as the inclusion of both 
manual and automatic blood pressure monitoring, and 
response rates. After limiting our analysis to population-
based studies conducted in representative samples 
(mainly national samples), hypertension data are avail-
able from countries representing 79.1% of the world 
population. Although the vast majority of people are 
represented, more than half of countries do not have 
data on hypertension prevalence, and inaccuracies in 
summary estimates resulting from missing country data 
could exist. Awareness, treatment, and control data are 
only available for 20 countries in 2000, but the trends 
seen in our summary estimates are consistent with 
those of individual countries that have repeated national 
samples for 2000 and 2010. High-income countries, 
such as South Korea, the United States, and the United 
Kingdom, have all experienced substantial increases 
in awareness, treatment, and control, whereas China’s 
proportion of awareness has increased only slightly and 
proportions of treatment and control have decreased or 
remained the same. Finally, at least 2 blood pressure 
measurements were obtained in all studies included in 
this analysis. However, most of these studies measured 
blood pressure at only 1 occasion, which could overesti-
mate the prevalence of hypertension.

In conclusion, our study indicates that global dispari-
ties in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, 
and control are large and increasing. Collaborative ef-
forts from national and international stakeholders are 
urgently needed to combat the emerging hypertension 
burden in low- and middle-income countries. Implemen-
tation of innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable pro-
grams for hypertension prevention and control should be 
a public health priority for these countries.
