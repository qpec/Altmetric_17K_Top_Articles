BACKGROUND: To the authors’ knowledge, the impact of insurance status on the survival time of patients with glioblastoma multi-
forme (GBM) has not been fully understood. The objective of the current study was to clarify the association between insurance sta-
tus and survival of patients with GBM by analyzing population-based data. METHODS: The authors performed a cohort study using
data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. They included adult patients (aged �18 years) with GBM as their
primary diagnosis from the years 2007 to 2012. Patients without information regarding insurance status were excluded. A survival
analysis between insurance status and GBM-related death was performed using an accelerated failure time model. Demographic and
clinical variables were included to adjust for confounding effects. RESULTS: Among the 13,665 adult patients in the study cohort, 558
(4.1%) were uninsured, 1516 (11.1%) had Medicaid coverage, and 11,591 (84.8%) had non-Medicaid insurance. Compared with patients
who were uninsured, insured patients were more likely to be older, female, white, married, and with a smaller tumor size at diagnosis.
Accelerated failure time analysis demonstrated that older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; P<.001), male sex (HR, 1.08; P<.001), large tu-
mor size at the time of diagnosis (HR, 1.26; P<.001), uninsured status (HR, 1.14; P 5.018), and Medicaid insurance (HR, 1.10; P 5.006)
were independent risk factors for shorter survival among patients with GBM, whereas radiotherapy (HR, 0.40; P<.001) and married
status (HR, 0.86; P<.001) indicated a better outcome. The authors discovered an overall yearly progressive improvement in survival in
patients with non-Medicaid insurance who were diagnosed from 2007 through 2011 (P 5.015), but not in uninsured or Medicaid-
insured patients. CONCLUSIONS: Variations existed in insurance status within the GBM population. Uninsured status and Medicaid in-
surance suggested shorter survival compared with non-Medicaid insurance among a population of patients with GBM. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor diagnosed in adults, with aggres-
sive clinical manifestation and rapidly progressing proliferation.1 The overall survival of patients with GBM is poor, with
a median survival of 14.6 months and a 5-year survival rate of <5%.2,3 During the past decades, many completed or
ongoing clinical trials contributed to the refinement of treatment strategies for patients with GBM, including the intro-
duction of temozolomide (TMZ), bevacizumab, and carmustine wafer with concomitant radiotherapy (RT).2,4-10 Despite
rigorous advancements in therapeutic approaches, cancer-related financial problems may result in disparities in medical
care.11
A recent study of adult patients with cancer from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey demonstrated that
approximately 30% of all survivors reported cancer-related financial problems.11 As an indicator of socioeconomic condi-
tion, insurance status is indicative of the financial capacity to access continuous and high-quality therapy. According to
previous reports, approximately 17% of the population aged <65 years live without insurance in United States.12 How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of insurance status on the survival time in patients with GBM has not been
elucidated. In the current study, by analyzing the data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) program, we sought to evaluate the effect of insurance on survival in patients with GBM. We
focused on cases diagnosed from 2007 to 2012, and hypothesized that insured patients have longer survival as a result of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The data source for this study was the SEER program
(www.seer.cancer.gov) (1973-2012), which is maintained
by the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer
Control and Population Sciences, Surveillance Research
Program,

released, based on the November 2014 submission). We
included data from the incidence SEER 18 registries
research data and Hurricane Katrina-impacted Louisiana
cases.
Inclusion Criteria, Exclusion Criteria, and Data
Collection
We selected patients with pathologically and/or clinically
confirmed glioblastoma (International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition histology codes 9440,
9441, and 9442) between January 1, 2007 and December
31, 2012, considering that the SEER program began col-
lecting insurance status in 2007. Only adult patients
(those aged �18 years) with GBM as their primary diag-
nosis were included in the current study. Patients with
GBM diagnosed by death certificate or at autopsy were
excluded from the current study; patients with unobtain-
able insurance information also were excluded. Patient in-
formation including demographic data, insurance and
marital status, year of diagnosis, tumor size at the time of
diagnosis, and treatment modality (surgery and RT) were
extracted from the data set.
Data Analysis and Statistical Methods
Our primary endpoint was tumor-associated death, which
was documented in the SEER data as “death (attributed
to this cancer).” We calculated survival time as the interval
in months from the diagnosis of GBM to the date of
GBM-associated death. Cases were right censored to the
date the patient was last known to be alive, or death attrib-
uted to other diseases. Race was categorized into white,
black, other (American Indian/Alaska Native or Asian/Pa-
cific Islander), and unknown. Tumor size was categorized
into 3 groups: <45 mm, >45 mm, and unknown. The
selected cutoff value of 45 mm represented the median
size of all GBMs. To evaluate the trend of survival among
patients diagnosed in different years, we further arranged
patients into 6 distinct groups based on the calendar year
of diagnosis (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012).
We excluded patients diagnosed in 2012 from the survival
trend analysis given their short follow-up period.
Baseline characteristics were summarized and pre-
sented as the number of cases and percentages for categori-
cal variables or the means and standard deviations for
continuous variables. Analysis of variance and post hoc
tests were used to detect differences in age, whereas the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-square test were used for
comparisons of age group, sex, race, marital status, year of
diagnosis, state, tumor size, and treatment, respectively.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
assess significant indicators for treatment decision,13 and
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate the
goodness-of-fit of the model. Survival analysis was per-
formed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank
test.14 Parametric univariate and multivariate accelerated
failure time (AFT) regression analysis with a Weibull dis-
tribution was conducted to assess the impact of factors on
the survival time of patients with GBM.15-17 All P values
were reported as 2-sided, with the level of significance
defined as P<.05. Statistical analysis was performed using
Stata statistical software (version 13.0; StataCorp LP, Col-
lege Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Patient Population and Characteristics
A total of 16,690 adult GBM cases were diagnosed
between 2007 and 2012 in the SEER registries. After
applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13,665 cases
were included in our final cohort, and patients with
unknown insurance status were excluded. Figure 1 dem-
onstrates the flowchart for patient selection in the current
study.
The mean age of the patients in the current study
cohort was 62.6 6 13.4 years. A total of 5766 patients
(42.2%) were female, 12,124 patients (88.7%) were
white, and 8613 patients (63.0%) were married. Within
this population, a total of 558 patients (4.1%) were unin-
sured, 1516 (11.1%) had Medicaid coverage, and 11,591
(84.8%) had non-Medicaid insurance.
Table 1 illustrates variations in the distribution of
patient characteristics between different types of insurance
coverage. Approximately 4.5% of male patients were
uninsured, whereas 3.5% of female patients were unin-
sured. Among the 13 states in the SEER registry, insur-
ance coverage (including Medicaid and non-Medicaid
insurance) ranged from 93.2% (Georgia) to 100%
(Alaska). Compared with patients who were uninsured,
insured patients were more likely to be older, female,

 white, married, and with a smaller tumor size at the time
of diagnosis.
Effect of Insurance Status on Treatment
Decision
Of the patients in the current study cohort, 76.0%
underwent surgical resection, among whom 78.5%
received RT as the adjuvant treatment before or after
surgery. Conversely, 59.7% of all patients underwent
both surgery and RT. In multivariate logistic regression
analysis, older age was found to be significantly associ-
ated with nondefinitive treatment (not surgery or RT),
whereas married status increased the propensity of
undergoing surgery or RT. Compared with non-
Medicaid insured status, Medicaid insurance was associ-
ated with a lower propensity of receiving surgical treat-
ment (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.65-0.85 [P<.001]), whereas both Medic-
aid insurance and uninsured status were associated with
a lower propensity of receiving adjuvant RT (Medicaid:
OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.55-0.70; P<.001]; and unin-
sured: OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.69; P<.001]). How-

going surgery or adjuvant RT is depicted in Tables 2
and 3.
Insurance Status and Survival
The overall median survival of the study cohort was 10.1
months (95% CI, 9.1-10.1 months), with a 1-year sur-
vival rate of 45.0%, a 2-year survival rate of 20.6%, and a
5-year survival rate of 6.3%. The AFT model mentioned
earlier was used to examine the impact of clinical charac-
teristics on survival while adjusting for potential con-
founding variables. The model included age at diagnosis,
sex, race (black, white, other, and unknown), marital sta-
tus, insurance status, tumor size, surgery, and RT. The
results demonstrated that older age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04 [P<.001]), male sex (HR, 1.08;
95% CI, 1.03-1.12 [P<.001]), large tumor size (HR,
1.26; 95% CI, 1.21-1.32 [P<.001]), Medicaid insured
status (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17 [P 5.006]), and
uninsured status (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.27 [P
5.018]) were independent risk factors of shorter survival
among patients with GBM (Table 4) (Fig. 2). In contrast,
receipt of RT (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38-0.42 [P<.001])
and married status (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82-0.90
[P<.001]) indicated an improved survival outcome (Ta-
ble 4). No difference in survival was observed between
white and black patients (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.03
[P 5.199]); however, other racial populations experi-
enced a longer survival compared with white patients
(HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85 [P<.001]).
We further analyzed the trend of survival over 5 con-
secutive years (2007-2011). The results demonstrated an
overall progressive improvement in survival across all in-
surance groups (median survival of 9.1 months in 2007 vs
10.1 months in 2011; 2-year survival rate of 19.6% in
2007 vs 23.9% in 2011). However, when stratifying by
insurance status, this trend was only found in patients
with non-Medicaid insurance (2008: HR, 1.01; 2009:
HR, 1.04; 2010: HR, 1.00; and 2011: HR, 0.96
[P 5 .015]).
DISCUSSION
Summary of Key Results
To the best of our knowledge, the current study represents
the first in the current literature to associate insurance sta-
tus with survival among patients with GBM. According to
the results presented herein, Medicaid insurance and
uninsured status were both independent predictive factors
of shorter survival in patients with GBM after adjusting
for age, sex, race, marital status, tumor size, and treatment
modalities. We also discovered a yearly improvement in
the survival of patients with GBM in United States over 5
consecutive years during the study period (2007-2011).

 type revealed that the trend toward yearly progressive
improvement in GBM survival occurred only in patients
with non-Medicaid insurance. Prior studies have explored
the influence of race and social status as measures of eco-
nomic status on access to high-volume neurooncology
centers, with findings suggesting that African American
and Hispanic patients have suboptimal access to tertiary
care centers.18 In addition, it has been recognized that
patients with Medicaid insurance have higher inpatient
mortality rates compared with those with non-Medicaid
or private insurance.19 Therefore, African American and
Hispanic patients, as well as patients with Medicaid, were
more likely to be treated in centers with lower clinical vol-
ume whereas patients with private insurance were treated
in higher-volume centers.19

 and unmarried. Further investigation after breaking down
the insurance categories suggested that patients with non-
Medicaid insurance were more likely to be older, white,
and married compared with patients with Medicaid insur-
ance. These results are in agreement with observations
from previous studies that also used the SEER data set.20-
22 The large variation in insurance coverage noted within
the study population may be partially due to various eligi-
bility criteria for public insurance in the United States.
Other factors that affect insurance coverage include pov-
erty, unemployment, and socioeconomic disadvant-
age.12,21,23 In addition, Stone et al revealed an association
between insurance status and race or poverty in metropol-
itan and nonmetropolitan counties.24
Insurance Status and Survival in Patients
With GBM
To our knowledge, the impact of insurance status on the
survival of patients with malignant intracranial neoplasms
remains to be clarified. Although previous studies have
found that insurance status was independently associated
with cancer stage and death from cancer,20,21,25 these
studies either did not include patients with GBM or did
not correlate insurance status with survival status. The
results of the current study demonstrated that within the
cohort of patients with GBM, those with non-Medicaid
insurance had significantly longer survival compared with
those who were uninsured or had Medicaid insurance. It
is interesting to note that considerable variability in
insurance may exist within the Medicaid or non-
Medicaid category, including flexibility of coverage
(health maintenance organization vs preferred provider
organization) and level of insurance. For example,
“underinsured” patients with a high deductible and health
maintenance organization coverage might indicate a lower
socioeconomic status compared with patients with more
premium types of insurance. Although the specific type of
insurance was not included in the SEER data set, the dif-
ference in survival time between uninsured patients and
those with non-Medicaid insurance in the current study
indicated a differentiation effect of socioeconomic status
on the survival status of patients with GBM on a more
general scale.
The benefit gain in survival among patients with in-
surance is likely multifactorial. First, insurance status is an
indirect indicator of the socioeconomic status of the
patient; it is likely that patients with excellent financial
capacity and social support have access to high-quality
home and hospital care, which may result in improved
survival. Next, similar to patients with other malignant
diseases, uninsured patients are expected to present at a
later stage of disease due to poor access to screening tests,
which leads to a delayed diagnosis.20,26 This is supported
by our observation that noninsured patients generally har-
bor a larger GBM compared with insured patients. In
addition, the increased financial burden for uninsured

 patients or those with Medicaid insurance also may limit
timely access to newly developed therapeutic approaches
such as bevacizumab or carmustine wafer, which can lead
to a significant extension of survival in patients with
GBM.2,27,28 For example, the landmark advancement in
GBM chemotherapy of the use of TMZ in patients with
primary GBM demonstrated a significant increase in sur-
vival from 12.1 months to 14.6 months.2 Darefsky et al
also demonstrated that the 2-year survival rate among
patients with GBM increased from 7% among those diag-
nosed between 1993 and 1995 to 17% in those diagnosed
between 2005 and 2007 in the TMZ era.29 The study by
Johnson et al compared the survival of patients with
GBM before and after US Food and Drug Administration
approval of bevacizumab and found a 2-month longer
median survival in patients who died in 2010 (after beva-
cizumab was approved) compared with those who died in
2008 (before bevacizumab was approved).30 Although we
were unable to find a direct association between insurance
status and treatment strategy using the SEER data set, it is
likely that the yearly survival improvement noted among
patients with non-Medicaid insurance is attributable to
timely access to newly effective medications, considering
that the majority of the treatments were developed and
popularized within the last few years of the study period.
Finally, the comprehensiveness of insurance coverage for
different treatment modalities also may play a role in the
difference in survival. An evident difference was found
with regard to the propensity of receiving RT, with unin-
sured patients and those with Medicaid coverage being
unlikely to receive RT. Given the proven effectiveness of
RT as an adjuvant or definitive treatment in patients with
GBM,31 patients with access to RT may increase the like-
lihood of increasing their survival time compared with
their counterparts.

 Other Variables Associated With Survival in
Patients With GBM
The current study also demonstrated that married patients
had a longer survival compared with unmarried patients,
even after adjusting for age and treatment strategy. The
beneficial effects of marital status on cancer have been
noted in several studies.32-35 Goodwin et al identified 3
reasons for a favorable cancer prognosis among married
patients, including early diagnosis, receipt of more aggres-
sive therapy, and longer survival after adjusting for disease
stage and treatment.35 Consistent with other studies, the
data from the current study confirmed increasing age to
be a significant predictor of shortened survival among
patients with GBM.36 The influence of age on cancer
prognosis is complicated and is more likely to be con-
founded. The fact that older patients are less likely to be
included in clinical trials promoting new and effective
medications also may result in worse prognosis compared
with younger patients.2,37-39 Finally, we revealed an effect
of sex on survival among patients with GBM, with male
sex found to be significantly associated with a shorter sur-
vival period. Although a slightly higher incidence of
GBM was reported in male individuals compared with
female individuals in sporadic studies,40 the difference in
survival between these 2 groups largely remains controver-
sial in the current literature.3,40-44
Study Limitations
There are several limitations to the current study. First,
considering that a large percentage of patients were clini-
cally diagnosed, and the exclusion of these patients would
result in significant attrition bias, we included both clini-
cally and pathologically diagnosed patients with GBM in
the current study cohort. Next, the multiple logistic
regression model demonstrated suboptimal goodness-of-
fit, which is inevitable given the limited number of cova-
riates we could use to enhance the fit in national data-
bases.
However,
although
the
goodness-of-fit
has
important implications regarding the interpretation of
the results, a single discrimination test should not under-
mine the exploratory attempt to address potential clinical
significance,45,46 and the inclusion of treatment in the
final survival model is still reasonably justified. Third,
although SEER data have demonstrated strong agree-
ment of surgery and RT in Medicare files,47,48 the data
set lacks general information regarding adjuvant thera-
pies, which is reported to significantly prolong the sur-
vival time of patients with GBM. Therefore, despite the
description of a significant association between non-
Medicaid insurance status and survival time in the cur-
rent study, because of insufficient information regarding
adjuvant therapies, we could not establish treatment
advancement as the underlying mechanism that led to the
significant correlation between non-Medicaid insurance
and survival. In addition, given that the insurance policy
in United State varies among different states, minor dif-
ferences in insurance coverage may occur, and this effect
may be magnified by the inequity of case numbers from
different states. For example, only 8 patients in the cur-
rent study cohort were from Alaska, whereas 5654
patients were from California. This disproportion in
patient registration among states also might be a con-
founding factor for survival. Moreover, income and edu-
cational status at the individual level are unobtainable
from SEER. Both of these factors may contribute to treat-
ment decisions and cancer care. Next, Karnofsky per-
formance scores and the Charleston Comorbidity Index,
which have been reported to be determinants of survival,
also are unavailable in the SEER database. Finally, similar
to other studies that used SEER data, the current study
suffers inherited sampling biases from the data set. De-
spite these potential biases, a population-based data set
has its strengths in that the large sample size may override
some of the biases to demonstrate the underlying general
trend. Nevertheless, with an exploratory effort to eluci-
date potential risk factors associated with survival in
patients with GBM, the results of the current study high-
light the difference in survival among patients with and
without non-Medicaid insurance.
The results of the current study demonstrate that in-
surance coverage varies among patients with GBM in the
United States. Patients with GBM with insurance were
more likely to be older, female, white, and married.
Compared with patients with non-Medicaid insurance,
those with Medicaid insurance and uninsured patients
demonstrated a significantly shorter survival after adjust-
ing for other confounding variables available in SEER
database. However, the question of whether this is related
to earlier access to new medications among patients with
non-Medicaid insurance remains implicit. In addition,
the influence of the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act on survival among patients with GBM due to
insurance reform also is undergoing active investigation.
Taken together, future studies are warranted to validate
these findings and establish underlying mechanisms of
the
survival
gain
in
patients
with
non-Medicaid
insurance.
