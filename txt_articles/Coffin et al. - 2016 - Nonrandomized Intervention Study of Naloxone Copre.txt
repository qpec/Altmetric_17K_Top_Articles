Abstract
Background—Unintentional overdose involving opioid analgesics is a leading cause of injury-
related death in the United States.
Objectives—To evaluate the feasibility and impact of implementing naloxone prescription to 
patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain.
Design—2-year non-randomized intervention study.
Setting—6 safety net primary care clinics in San Francisco.
Participants—1985 adults receiving long-term opioids for pain.
Intervention—Providers and clinic staff were trained and supported in naloxone prescribing.
Measurements—Outcomes were proportion of patients prescribed naloxone, opioid-related 
emergency department (ED) visits, and prescribed opioid dose based on chart review.
Results—38.2% of 1,985 patients on long-term opioids were prescribed naloxone. Patients on 
higher doses of opioids and with a past 12-month opioid-related emergency department (ED) visit 
were independently more likely to be prescribed naloxone. Patients who received a naloxone 
prescription had 47% fewer opioid-related ED visits per month six months after the receipt of the 
prescription (IRR=0.53, 95%CI=0.34–0.83, P=0.005) and 63% fewer visits after one year 
(IRR=0.37, 95%CI=0.22–0.64, P<0.001), compared to patients who did not receive naloxone. 
There was no net change over time in opioid dose among those who received naloxone compared 
to those who did not (IRR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91–1.27, P = 0.61).
Limitations—Results are observational and may not be generalizable beyond safety net settings.
Conclusion—Naloxone can be co-prescribed to primary care patients prescribed opioids for 
pain. When advised to offer naloxone to all patients on opioids, providers may prioritize those

Introduction
In the United States, the opioid analgesic overdose death rate increased from 1.4 to 5.4 per 
100,000 adults from 1999–2011.(1) Efforts to manage this increase in mortality have 
focused on modifying the prescribing practices of providers.(2) Mandated urine testing, pain 
agreements, and inspections of prescription drug monitoring program data have become 
standard practice, yet there are few data to support a link between such interventions and 
reduced opioid-related morbidity or mortality. In fact, while opioid analgesic deaths have 
recently plateaued, heroin use and overdose deaths have skyrocketed, suggesting possible 
unintended consequences of opioid stewardship initiatives.(3, 4)
Many communities have employed the targeted distribution of naloxone, the short-acting 
opioid antagonist, to address opioid-related mortality.(5) Provision of naloxone to those 
likely to witness or experience an opioid overdose, principally illicit drug users, has been 
associated with substantial reductions in community-level opioid overdose mortality relative 
to communities that did not implement naloxone distribution.(6) Other observational and 
ecologic analyses have demonstrated marked reductions in opioid overdose mortality in 
communities that distributed naloxone, including Chicago,(7) New York City,(8) and 
Scotland,(9) and a meta-analysis demonstrated a higher likelihood of survival in overdose 
situations when lay naloxone was administered.(10) Naloxone distribution to heroin users is 
remarkably cost-effective.(11)
In San Francisco, California, implementation and expansion of a targeted naloxone 
distribution program was temporally associated with a decline in heroin overdose deaths 
from approximately 180 to 10 per year through 2012. The number of deaths attributed to 
opioid analgesics, however, exceeded 100 annually from 2010–2012.(12) The majority of 
these decedents received primary care in safety net clinics, and most had received long-term 
opioids for pain. However, literature to support naloxone prescribing to this population is 
limited to early descriptive analyses(13) and anecdotal reports.(14) At U.S. Army Fort 
Bragg, overdoses seen in the emergency department declined from 8 per month to 0 after 
naloxone co-prescription was started,(14) suggesting that naloxone prescription may have 
affected the overdose event rate by influencing patient and/or provider behavior, rather than 
simply being available as a reversal agent. These results are consistent with some data 
suggesting that heroin users who receive naloxone reduce their heroin use.(15)
In response to these data, we developed and coordinated a standardized naloxone co-
prescribing program at primary care clinics in a safety net system in San Francisco. To 
inform the larger scale implementation of naloxone prescribing for patients prescribed 
opioid medications, we assessed the feasibility of introducing and scaling up naloxone co-
prescribing in these primary care clinics and conducted analyses to assess the association of 
naloxone co-prescribing with emergency department (ED) utilization and prescribed opioid 
dose.

 Methods
Naloxone for Opioid Safety Evaluation (NOSE) staff coordinated the clinical program and 
conducted the evaluation. The study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of 
the University of California San Francisco (CHR#13-11168).
Clinical Program
The clinical program was implemented in a rolling fashion from February 2013 to April 
2014 at six clinics, all of which had lost patients to opioid overdose from 2010–2012. All 
clinics accepted only publicly- or un-insured patients and two were resident training sites. 
On-site leaders were selected and a consistent protocol was implemented across sites, 
beginning with training in naloxone prescribing for providers (MDs, NPs, PAs) and staff 
(see Methods Appendix and Appendix Table 1 for implementation plan and process 
outcomes). Trainings covered rationale and indications for prescribing naloxone (anyone 
who uses opioids chronically or is otherwise at risk for witnessing or experiencing an opioid 
overdose), language to approach patients (e.g., use phrases such as “bad reaction” instead of 
“overdose”), naloxone formulations, and pharmacy/payer coverage. Additionally, providers 
and staff were trained on how to educate patients about how to use naloxone, how to 
assemble the intranasal device (a device requiring no assembly has since been approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] (16)), and to ensure caretakers know how and 
when to administer naloxone (Appendix Figure 1).
Initial training was provided to all sites approximately 30 days preceding initiation of 
naloxone co-prescription; after initiation, additional trainings were provided and at least one 
reminder email was sent to providers (Appendix Figure 2). As most providers opted to 
prescribe the intra-nasal formulation of naloxone and the mucosal atomization device was 
not readily available from pharmacies, clinics were able to order the device and patient 
brochures (Appendix Figure 3) in zip-lock bags from the clinic system’s central pharmacy. 
NOSE staff assisted with any logistical problems and a clinical pharmacist educated any 
pharmacies that encountered problems ordering, dispensing, or billing for naloxone 
(Appendix Figure 4).
Data Sources and Data Abstraction
Feasibility was assessed through chart reviews of all patients receiving opioids chronically 
by prescription. Patients receiving sufficient opioids to take at least one pill daily for over 
three months were added to a “Pain Management Registry” (PMR) by staff at each clinic. 
This list was downloaded every three months during the intervention period and a merged 
list of 3,138 patients with demographic data was generated in March 2015. A manual chart 
review was conducted to determine if patients were valid PMR patients during the study 
period and to collect the following data: (1) opioid name, dose, quantity per 30 days, and 
date prescribed at two clinic visits, the visit closest to the baseline date (either start of 
naloxone co-prescribing at the given clinic or the date the patient was added to the PMR, 
whichever was later) and the last visit at the clinic prior to chart review (i.e. follow-up date); 
(2) the date of initial naloxone prescription; and (3) dates of all ED visits at the county 
hospital and opioid-relatedness.

 The ED visits were coded “opioid-related” in accordance with documentation for 
establishing drug-relatedness of ED visits from the Drug Abuse Warning Network.(17) 
Visits were opioid-related if considered by the documenting physician to be primarily due to 
an adverse event from an opioid or due to opioid-seeking behavior; a subset were coded 
“oversedation” if the assessment was an opioid poisoning or other complication attributed by 
the physician to opioid-induced sedation. Staff conducting chart reviews included a clinician 
who trained other staff and reviewed uncertain cases; 62.5% of charts were independently 
assessed by at least two reviewers (see Appendix for details). Death information was 
extracted from the California Electronic Death Record System on 14 July 2015.
Feasibility Analyses
We assessed bivariate relationships between all demographic and clinical characteristics 
presented in Table 1 and receipt of naloxone during the study period using Chi-square, 
Fisher’s exact (for comparisons with cell sizes <5), and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Morphine 
equivalent daily dose in milligrams (MEQ) was calculated for each patient at their baseline 
and subsequent follow-up dates using standard conversion ratios from the literature.(18, 19)
We fit a normal-logistic regression model, with random effects for providers, to assess both 
patient- and provider-level predictors of naloxone prescription. All baseline patient 
characteristics assessed in bivariate analyses were included in the model, except for opioid 
type, which was excluded because relevant elements of formulations (e.g. presence of 
acetaminophen or duration of action) do not necessarily correspond to opioid type. Only 
baseline history of any opioid-related ED visit was included in the model because this 
category of visit was hypothesized to be most relevant to naloxone prescribing. The model 
also included provider type (attending physician or fellow, resident physician, or other 
provider) and the size of each provider’s panel of PMR patients, while controlling for time 
in days from February 1, 2013 (the earliest program initiation date) to patient baseline date, 
as well as time between the baseline and follow-up visit dates.
To characterize residual differences among providers in naloxone prescription rates, we 
calculated the odds-ratio for the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile values of the 
random provider effect. A descriptive summary of the PMR panel size, number of patients 
prescribed naloxone, and the percentage of patients prescribed naloxone per provider is 
presented in the Appendix (see Appendix Table 2).
Analysis of ED Use
In our pre-specified plan to assess the association of naloxone receipt with opioid-related ED 
visits, numbers of opioid-related ED visits were calculated for each patient in each month 
between January 2013 and the date of chart review (March to October 2015). For patients 
who died during the study period (N=59), follow-up ended at the date of death.
We then developed a multivariable Poisson regression model for the monthly number of 
opioid-related ED visits, using an offset to account for days of exposure in each month 
(ranging from one to 31 with an average of 30.0). This model used generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) with exchangeable working correlation and robust standard errors to 
account for clustering by patient as well as over-dispersion. The effect of receipt of a

 naloxone prescription was assessed using two time-dependent covariates: the first, an 
indicator for all months after the first naloxone prescription, models the immediate effect; 
and the second, the number of months since first naloxone prescription, captures subsequent 
increases or decreases in the prescription effect; this has value zero before receipt of 
naloxone. Patients never prescribed naloxone were assigned values of zero for both 
covariates.
The model adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, gender, MEQ at baseline date, history of any 
opioid-related ED visit between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012, and clinic. The 
model also flexibly controlled for secular trends in ED utilization using a 3-knot restricted 
cubic spline in calendar month, starting from January 2013; as a result, effect estimates for 
having received a naloxone prescription are net of any underlying secular trend.
To illustrate the estimated naloxone effects, we plotted the expected number of ED visits in 
each month for two patients, one who received naloxone, the other who did not, with the 
time scale for both trajectories centered on the median month of naloxone prescription; for 
both patients, expected values were evaluated at the mean values of all covariates. Similar 
plots stratified by clinic and models allowing modification of both the immediate naloxone 
prescription effect and subsequent changes in the effect over time by clinic are presented in 
the appendix (see Appendix Figure 5 for plots and Appendix Table 3 [regression results]). In 
a sensitivity analysis, we counted opioid overdose deaths that occurred during the study 
period as an event. In a second sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for whether or not the 
patient ever received naloxone during the study period, to control for unmeasured 
differences between individuals who were and were not prescribed naloxone that may not 
have been accounted for by the included demographic and clinical covariates. We conducted 
a third sensitivity analysis in which we excluded the variable indicating a history of any 
opioid-related ED visit between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012.
Analysis of Opioid Dose
We fit an adjusted GEE negative binomial model for the baseline and follow-up total MEQ 
values, set up in essentially the same way as the model for opioid-related ED visits. Negative 
binomial models accommodate severe right skewness and also zero values, observed at 
follow-up among participants whose opioids were discontinued. Specifically, we used the 
same two time-dependent covariates to model the immediate effect of having received a 
naloxone prescription as well as changes in this effect, net of the secular effect modeled 
using a 3-knot restricted cubic spline in months since February 1, 2013 (the program 
initiation date), and controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, history of any opioid-related 
ED visit, and clinic. However, in line with our sensitivity model for ED visits, we included 
an indicator for naloxone group as a fixed effect (i.e. whether or not the patient ever received 
naloxone during the study period), to capture the systematically higher total MEQ at 
baseline in the group that went on to receive a naloxone prescription; this difference could 
not be adequately controlled by the covariates available to us. This is analogous to an 
analysis of pre- and post-treatment values in a randomized trial using group, time, and their 
interaction, with the main effect for group capturing any baseline between-group differences.

 Finally, as indicated by exploratory analysis, we allowed this baseline group effect to vary 
by clinic, using an interaction term. As in the analysis of ED visits, we illustrate the 
estimated naloxone effects by plotting expected MEQ dose for two patients, one of whom 
received naloxone, both with typical covariate levels, and the time scale centered on the 
median month of naloxone prescription. Similar plots stratified by clinic and models 
allowing modification of both the immediate naloxone prescription effect and subsequent 
changes in the effect over time by clinic are presented in the appendix (see Appendix Figure 
6 for plots and Appendix Table 4 [regression results]).
Motivated by the hypothesis that naloxone prescription could lead providers to decrease total 
MEQ for some patients and increase it for others, we also categorized the change in 
prescribed opioid dose between the baseline and follow-up clinic visits as increased, 
decreased/discontinued, or unchanged, and used a multinomial logistic regression model to 
assess the association of naloxone prescription with this 3-level outcome, with no change in 
dose as the reference level of the outcome (see Appendix).

Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 3,138 patient chart reviews identified 1,985 patients prescribed opioids chronically 
for pain management from the clinics during the time of naloxone prescribing (see Table 1). 
The excluded patients included those who, at the start of naloxone prescribing, were no 
longer in care at the clinics (600), not prescribed opioids (447), deceased (21), or prescribed 
opioids only for opioid use disorder treatment (85). There were more men than women and 
Blacks accounted for the plurality of patients. Baseline opioid dose ranged from 2–
4,200MEQ/day, with a median dose of 53MEQ/day. Over one-quarter received 
<=20MEQ/day and nearly 10% received >400MEQ/day. Oxycodone was the most 
commonly prescribed opioid, followed by hydrocodone and morphine. Patient 
characteristics stratified by clinic are presented in the appendix (see Appendix Table 5).
Feasibility of Naloxone Prescribing
During the study period, naloxone was prescribed to 759 pain patients (38.2%) over 2,254 
patient-years. Patients who received naloxone accounted for 19 (32.2%) of 59 deaths during 
the study period and 2 (40%) of 5 opioid poisoning deaths. Our logistic regression model 
assessing predictors of naloxone prescription included only the 1,805 (90.9%) patients for 
whom provider data was available. In this analysis, patients who were on a higher dose of 
opioids or seen in the county ED for an opioid-related visit in the 12 months preceding 
program initiation at their clinic were more likely to receive a naloxone prescription (see 
Table 2).

 Older patients had lower odds of being prescribed naloxone. Receiving a naloxone 
prescription was also dependent on which clinic patients attended, with three clinics 
(including one of two resident training sites) prescribing naloxone to a substantially lower 
proportion of patients than the other clinics. Although statistically insignificant (p>0.05), 
there were trends towards a lower odds of being prescribed naloxone among Black patients 
compared to white patients and a higher odds of prescribing naloxone among resident 
physicians compared to attending physicians and fellows. The OR for the difference between 
the 25th and 75th percentiles of the provider random effect, our measure of residual between-
provider variability in naloxone prescription rates not accounted for by the fixed effects in 
the model, was 5.06 (95% CI: 3.45–6.9).
Opioid-Related Emergency Department Visits
There were a total of 4,322 ED visits during the study period, 471 of which were opioid-
related and 95 which were attributed to opioid-induced oversedation. On average, patients 
had 6% fewer opioid-related ED visits with each additional month since the receipt of a 
naloxone prescription (IRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89–0.998, P = 0.044), controlling for all 
demographic and clinical covariates and secular trends in emergency department utilization. 
This monthly decrease in opioid-related ED visits after the receipt of a naloxone prescription 
corresponds to a 47% reduction in opioid-related ED visits per month six months after 
receipt of the prescription (IRR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.34 – 0.83, P = 0.005) and a 63% 
reduction after one year (IRR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.22 – 0.64, P < 0.001).
Figure 1 shows the pattern of expected ED visit rates for two typical patients, one of whom 
received naloxone. Results were essentially unchanged when the five opioid poisoning 
deaths that occurred during the study period were included as events (IRR = 0.95, 95% CI = 
0.89–1.00, P = 0.050) and in our sensitivity analysis adjusting for ever receiving a naloxone 
prescription (IRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89–1.00, P = 0.039). In our final sensitivity analysis 
excluding history of any opioid-related ED visit, the evidence for the relationship between 
months since naloxone prescription and the monthly number of ED visits was marginally 
insignificant (IRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88–1.01, P = 0.080).
Prescribed Opioid Dose
In the generalized estimating equation negative binomial model for expected MEQ, the 
baseline secular trend showed a rapid decrease followed by leveling off (P < 0.0005 for both 
the overall effect and its non-linearity), as well as strong baseline differences between the 
two groups, in particular at two of the six clinics. After controlling for demographic and 
clinical characteristics and secular trend, we found a nominal 15% decrease in total MEQ at 
the time of naloxone prescription (IRR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.67–1.08, P = 0.191), followed by 
1% monthly increases in dose (IRR 1.01, 95% CI = 0.996 – 1.03, P = 0.154), resulting in an 
estimated net effect at 18 months of nil (IRR 1.03, 95% CI = 0.91–1.27, P = 0.61; Table 4). 
These effects are illustrated for two typical patients in Figure 2. In our additional analysis 
using multinomial logistic regression, having received a naloxone prescription was 
associated with a decrease or discontinuation in opioid dose (RRR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.17 – 
1.86, P = 0.001) but not significantly associated with an increase in dose (RRR = 1.18, 95% 
CI = 0.92 – 1.52, P = 0.198) (see Appendix Table 6).

 Discussion
This non-randomized intervention study found that primary care providers prescribed 
naloxone to a substantial proportion of patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain 
management. When advised to offer naloxone to all patients on long-term opioids, clinicians 
were more likely to prescribe to those likely to be at higher risk for overdose, including 
patients on higher doses of opioids and those who have had opioid-related ED visits in the 
past. In the absence of guideline-based indications for naloxone co-prescribing, these may 
be reasonable metrics upon which to prioritize prescription of naloxone. In fact, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidelines on opioid prescribing that 
recommend considering naloxone prescription for patients with a prior history of overdose, a 
history of a substance use disorder, an opioid dose > 50 MEQ, or concurrent benzodiazepine 
use.(20)
Nonetheless, there may be hazards to risk stratifying patients for naloxone prescription, 
including stigma, medico-legal concerns about acknowledging a patient’s elevated risk of 
overdose, and failure to reach the high proportion of potential decedents who access 
intentionally or unintentionally diverted opioids.(21) Finally, there may be a behavioral 
impact of naloxone co-prescription in which patients become more aware of the hazards of 
these medications and engage in efforts to improve medication safety – a benefit hinted at by 
our analyses.
The proportion of patients prescribed naloxone both by clinic and by provider varied 
substantially both by clinic and by provider. In addition, older patients were less likely to 
receive naloxone prescriptions and there was weak evidence suggesting the same for Black 
patients. There are multiple possible explanations for this variation. As prescribing naloxone 
was not considered standard practice and lacked the wealth of data supporting most other 
routine preventive medical interventions, some providers may have opted to not follow the 
recommendations for naloxone prescribing and vocal “champions” at selected clinics may 
have been able to substantially influence other providers. With regard to patient-level 
factors, the median age of opioid overdose death in San Francisco is 50 years,(12) 
suggesting unmet need for naloxone among older patients. Similarly, Blacks were 
overrepresented among PMR patients in the safety net clinics (particularly in two of the low-
prescribing clinics, representing 88.4% of patients at one and 42.5% of patients at another), 
as well as among opioid overdose decedents, relative to the San Francisco population.(12) 
Changes in clinic protocols and additional provider education may be needed to ensure 
access to naloxone to patients most at risk.
Receipt of naloxone was independently associated with a reduction in opioid-related ED 
visits over time, raising the possibility that providing naloxone impacted patient behavior 
with respect to opioids. This finding is consistent with prior observations of similar benefits 
with naloxone receipt among patients prescribed opioids at U.S. Army Fort Bragg(14) and 
among some heroin users trained in overdose prevention.(15) Such a change was not found 
in an interrupted time series of community distribution of naloxone,(6) suggesting that any 
associated behavioral modification may be dependent upon the mode of intervention 
delivery. In addition, we found no net effect of naloxone receipt on opioid dose over time,

 and a possible reduction in dose in an alternative analysis, alleviating potential concerns that 
providing naloxone could result in risk compensation via increased use of opioids. These 
potential benefits of naloxone provision should be targets for future research.
This study had several limitations. First, we cannot definitively infer causality from this 
observational study. Second, data collected by chart review may vary based on 
documentation patterns; however, the size of our sample should reduce the effect of such 
variation. Third, our data do not confirm that patients filled their naloxone prescription. 
Fourth, we were unable to ascertain if patients sought care outside of the safety net system. 
In addition, we were unable to assess details of patients’ substance use history and 
incarceration events, factors that may influence naloxone prescribing and overdose risk. 
Finally, results may not be generalizable outside of safety-net clinical care settings.
In summary, we demonstrated that naloxone can be successfully prescribed to a substantial 
proportion of patients on opioids for chronic pain in primary care practices. Naloxone co-
prescribing was associated with reduced opioid-related ED visits, suggesting a possible 
ancillary benefit of reducing opioid-related adverse events, and no net change in opioid dose. 
Naloxone prescribing is now more straightforward, with recent FDA approval of naloxone 
devices designed for lay persons.(16)

Methods Appendix
Clinical Program
NOSE staff provided initial and ongoing trainings at each clinic and provided ongoing 
support throughout the pilot. NOSE staff conducted on-site naloxone prescribing and 
education trainings at each clinic prior to program initiation and provided additional 
trainings intermittently throughout the study (see Appendix Table 1). Clinic-wide staff 
received information about the program at least once through in-person meetings and staff-
wide emails; providers, nurses and medical assistants (MEAs) received additional 
specialized education through group-specific meetings and one-on-one trainings.
Meetings with providers focused on technical aspects of naloxone prescribing, including 
entering the prescription into the electronic medical record, interfacing with pharmacies, 
delegation of naloxone prescribing and education tasks, and fielding provider questions and 
concerns. These trainings also covered non-stigmatizing language to present naloxone to 
patients. Trainings were often conducted at provider-wide meetings or smaller provider

 “huddles” which varied in size and length. Provider trainings included from 5–30 providers 
and were 5 to 60 minutes in duration.
One-on-one trainings were also conducted with the nursing and MEA staff to discuss 
educating patients who were receiving naloxone prescriptions. These trainings were 
designed to ensure familiarity with the naloxone device, including its formulation, assembly, 
and indications for when and how to use it and to ensure comfort with the education 
guidelines as described in Appendix Figure 1. One-on-one trainings included roll-plays and 
lasted from 5–15 minutes.
After rollout, NOSE staff remained engaged with clinic activities and available to provide 
technical support, such as addressing problems with pharmacy access to naloxone and 
access to naloxone kit supplies, such as the atomizer and brochure.
Support for all six clinics combined required on average approximately 20% full-time effort 
per year provided by mid-level non-clinical staff.
Data Sources and Data Abstraction
A total of 3,138 charts were reviewed, identifying 1,985 patients eligible for inclusion in the 
study. Patients were excluded if, at the start of naloxone prescribing they were not in care 
(600), not prescribed opioids (447), on opioids for opioid use disorder treatment only (85), 
or deceased (21). At least 1,241 (62.5%) of the 1,985 eligible charts were assessed by one or 
more additional reviewers. These additional assessments occurred in several different 
manners. First, reviewers were instructed to mark “review” on any charts for which there 
was uncertainty about any data elements, resulting in a second assessment of at least 908 
charts (an unquantified number of additional charts were assessed by a second reviewer in 
real-time when the initial reviewer had questions). Second, at the conclusion of data 
collection, to ensure charts assessed early on in the process were consistent with 
interpretations made later in the process, all 339 charts from the first clinic reviewed were 
assessed by a second reviewer. Third, at the conclusion of data collection, the 409 charts 
assessed by reviewers who had assessed less than 20% of the total charts were assessed by a 
second reviewer. Finally, at the conclusion of data collection, 63 additional charts not re-
assessed through any of the prior processes were randomly selected for a final assessment. 
Data were not collected with regard to changes made during secondary reviews, with the 
exception of the final random review of 63 charts which resulted in no changes to any data 
elements. The total number of repeated assessments exceeds the total number of charts that 
were re-assessed because some charts marked for “review” were later selected for re-
assessment.
Analysis of Opioid Dose
In an additional analysis, motivated by the hypothesis that naloxone prescription could lead 
providers to decrease total MEQ for some patients and increase it for others, depending on 
current dose as well as unmeasured patient characteristics, we categorized the change in 
prescribed opioid dose between the first and final clinic visits as increased, decreased/
discontinued, or unchanged. We then used multinomial logistic regression to assess the

 association of naloxone prescription with this multinomial 3-level outcome, with no change 
in dose as the reference level of the outcome, and controlling for patient age, race/ethnicity, 
gender, and history of an opioid-related ED visit in the one year prior to baseline date. The 
model also flexibly adjusted for a linear secular trend as the time in days from February 1, 
2013 (the earliest program initiation date) to patient baseline date, as well as time between 
the baseline and follow-up visits. Adjustment for baseline MEQ could induce collider-
stratification bias if this potentially important confounder is a common effect of both 
unmeasured confounders as well as measurement error in both the baseline and follow-up 
dose(1); as result, we omit baseline MEQ from the model. The results from this analysis are 
presented in Appendix Table 6.

*Calculated from multivariable Poisson regression, fit with generalized estimating equations, assessing count of opioid-
related emergency department visits per month. Model adjusts for age, race/ethnicity, gender, log morphine equivalent daily 
dose, patient clinic, history of opioid-related ED visit, and a cubic spline of the sequential count of patient-months starting 
with a value of one for January 2013. The model includes interaction terms between patient clinic and the post naloxone 
receipt indicator variable as well as between patient clinic and the months since naloxone receipt continuous variable.
†IRR = Incidence Rate Ratio
‡Overall P-Values correspond to global tests for significance of the interaction terms between clinic and either post
