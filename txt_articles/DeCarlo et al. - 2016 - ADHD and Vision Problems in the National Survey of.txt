Abstract
Purpose—To compare the prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 
children with normal vision and with vision problems not correctable with glasses or contact 
lenses (vision problems) as determined by parent report in a nationwide telephone survey.
Methods—This cross-sectional study included 75,171 children without intellectual impairment 
ages 4 to 17 participating in the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), conducted 
by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Demographic information and 
information regarding vision and ADHD status was obtained by parent interview. Questions asked 
whether they had ever been told by a doctor or health care provider that the child had a vision 
problem not correctable with glasses or contact lenses, ADHD, intellectual impairment or one of 
13 other common chronic conditions of childhood. A follow-up question asked about condition 
severity. The main outcome measure was current ADHD.
Results—The prevalence of current ADHD was greater (p<0.0001) among children with vision 
problems (15.6%) compared to those with normal vision (8.3%). The odds of ADHD compared to 
that of children with normal vision was greatest for those with moderate vision problems (odds 
ratio (OR) 2.6 (95% CI 1.7, 4.4)) and mild vision problems (OR 1.8, 95% CI1.1, 2.9). Children 
with severe vision problems had similar odds of ADHD to that of children with normal vision, 
perhaps owing to the small numbers in this group (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8, 3.1). In multivariable 
analysis adjusting for confounding variables, vision problems remained independently associated 
with current ADHD (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.7).
Conclusions—In this large nationally representative sample, the prevalence of ADHD was 
greater among children with vision problems not correctable with glasses or contacts. The

 association between vision problems and ADHD remains even after adjusting for other factors 
known to be associated with ADHD.

ADHD; attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; National Survey of Children's Health; vision 
problems; vision impairment
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently encountered 
neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. Among children ages 4 to 15 years in the 
1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 8.2% had 
parent-reported ADHD.1 The National Survey of Children's Health found that 10.1% of 
children in the 2007 survey 2 and 11% of children in the 2011-12 survey had parent reported 
ADHD.3 Children with ADHD have difficulty maintaining focus and controlling their 
behavior; some exhibit hyperactivity. There is no single known cause for ADHD; both 
genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role.4
Focus groups of parents of children with vision impairment revealed concerns about 
ADHD.5 Children with low vision seen in a vision rehabilitation clinic or attending a state 
school for the blind, both in Alabama, had a 22.9% prevalence of parent-reported diagnosis 
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is considerably higher than the general 
population.6 Another study found an increased prevalence of self-reported ADHD among 
people with vision impairment due to albinism.7
Several studies have elucidated a link between vision problems and ADHD. ADHD has been 
found to be associated with astigmatic refractive error.8,9 Other groups have found an 
association between convergence insufficiency and ADHD10, 11. This is a significant 
finding, as convergence insufficiency is a relatively common condition, affecting between 
2.25% and 8.3% of elementary school children.12, 13 Additionally, symptoms of convergence 
insufficiency are closely related to symptoms of ADHD and those symptoms decreased after 
vision therapy to improve vergence movements.14 These symptoms include difficulty 
completing schoolwork and inattentiveness during reading among others.10 The complex 
relationship of vision to ADHD is further evidenced by the finding of early deficits in visual 
sensory integration using event-related potentials measured in the visual cortex of children 
with ADHD15 as well as deficient blue color perception in adults with ADHD.16
The present study sought to utilize the dataset from the NSCH 2011-12 to examine the 
association between vision problems that are not correctable with glasses or contact lenses 
and ADHD.17
METHODS
NSCH Design
The NSCH is designed to examine factors related to the physical and emotional well-being 
of children ages 0-17 years in order to provide both state and national level estimates of 
child health.17 It is a random digit dialed telephone survey conducted in six languages 
(English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean) by the National Center 
DeCarlo et al.

 for Health Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using the 
CDC's State and Local Area Integrated Telephone System (SLAITS). The NSCH sampling 
is structured to obtain representative populations of children ages 0-17 in each state with a 
goal of at least 1800 children per state. In multi-child households one child was randomly 
selected to be the subject of the interview. A parent or guardian living in the household who 
had the most knowledge about the study child's health and healthcare was interviewed. The 
2011-12 NSCH included responses about 95,677 children. Questions were divided into 13 
sections: initial demographics, health and functional status, health insurance coverage, 
health care access and utilization, medical home, early childhood (ages 0-5 years), middle 
childhood and adolescence (6-17 years of age), family functioning, parental health, 
neighborhood characteristics, additional demographic characteristics, additional health 
insurance questions and locating information. Data collection was conducted under contract 
by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and adhered strictly 
to the confidentiality and privacy regulations of the National Center for Health Statistics. 
Respondents were informed that participation was voluntary, that they may choose not to 
answer any questions they do not wish to answer and that their privacy is protected by 
Federal Law, but did not provide written consent. The database is publicly available on the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/slaits/
nsch.htm and contains no personal identifiers.17 None of the authors participated in survey 
design or data collection. Local Institutional Review Board approval was not required for 
this study.
Study Variables
Questions about a wide range of health conditions and disorders including ADHD and vision 
problems were asked about all NSCH children aged two years and older. Disorder specific 
inquiries followed a three-question format. 1) “Has a doctor or health care provider you ever 
told you your child has [condition] even if they don't have it now?” 2) “Does the child 
currently have the [condition]?” 3) “Would you describe [his/her] [condition] as mild, 
moderate or severe?” Definitions of severity were not given during survey administration; 
responses were based on parent perception. The vision specific question asks about vision 
problems that cannot be corrected with standard glasses or contact lenses. Children whose 
parents responded affirmatively to this question were categorized as non-refractive vision 
problems (hereafter referred to as “vision problems”). The questions are structured similarly 
for ADHD with accompanying explanatory prompts provided. Within the ADHD series, an 
additional question asked if the child with current ADHD was taking medication for the 
condition. Specific wording for Survey questions and responses that were analyzed in this 
study can be found in the Appendix, available at [LWW insert link]. Children were 
categorized as having ADHD using parent report of ADHD diagnosed by a doctor or other 
health care provider. No clinical confirmations of ADHD or vision problems were obtained. 
A population level estimate of prevalence and a within group estimate of severity (mild, 
moderate, severe) was created from these questions for ADHD and vision problems.
A number of socio-demographic factors have been associated with ADHD and were 
included as potential confounders. Age of mother and child was classified by NSCH to the 
nearest year. Responses to race and ethnicity questions were combined to create four groups:

 non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and Other (comprised of all other 
responses including mixed race). Children with birth weight less than 88 ounces (2500 
grams) were categorized as having low birth weight. Children born more than three weeks 
early were considered premature. The primary language spoken in the household was 
dichotomized as English or other language. Family household structure was dichotomized as 
two parent biological or adoptive households, versus other household types. The total 
number of children under 18 in the family was classified as a categorical variable of one, 
two or three or more children. Poverty status (based on income and family size) was 
categorized into 2 groups based upon income at or above 200% or less than 200% above the 
federal poverty level. Family member smoking status was dichotomized as at least one 
smoker in the household or no smokers, highest level of education by either parent or main 
guardian in the household was dichotomized as high school or less or more than high school. 
Having health insurance was dichotomized as yes or no. Region of the US was categorized 
as North East, South, West and Midwest per the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services Health Resources and Services Administration. Residence in a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area is determined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. This variable 
was dichotomized as yes or no.
The current study cohort includes 75,151 children aged 4-17 years from the publicly 
available NSCH 2011-2012 dataset for whom the responding adult denied that a doctor or 
other health care provider ever told them that the child had intellectual disability or mental 
retardation (see the Appendix, available at [LWW insert link], for wording of question). 
The sample included an un-weighted group of 1,017 children with vision problems and 
74,073 children without vision problems (Figure 1). Children with intellectual impairment 
were excluded, as diagnosis of ADHD requires that the behaviors be inappropriate for age, 
and intellectual impairment could confound the diagnosis.18 Children less than 4 were 
omitted since the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline for ADHD 
evaluation is only established for children 4 to 18 years of age.19
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted accounting for the sample design and weighting by methods 
suggested by the National Center for Health Statistics 20 using SAS v9.3 Survey Methods 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Base weighting accounts for the probability of selection of 
each phone number from others in the bank of numbers. The base weights are adjusted for 
non-resolution of telephone lines, non-response, sub-sampling by age-eligibility, multiple 
phone lines and non-coverage of children in households with no land-lines. Next, raking 
adjustments are used to match each state's weighted survey responses to selected 
characteristics of the state's population of non-institutionalized children ages 0 to 17 years. 
As a consequence, estimates reflect the national population of non-institutionalized children. 
We report un-weighted sample sizes and percentages as well as weighted percentages and 
weighted 95% confidence intervals. Chi- square and t-tests were used as appropriate. 
Variance estimates used the Taylor linearization method. “Don't know” and missing 
responses were denoted as missing and not included in the analysis. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic or ordinal regression was used to calculate p-values and odds ratios for 
both dichotomous (vision problems, yes or no) and multi-level (vision problems severity)

 variables. Weighted t-tests were used in univariate analysis of continuous variables. Adjusted 
odds ratios were calculated with all statistically significant univariate variables included in 
the model. Significance was set at α < 0.05.
RESULTS
In the weighted analyses of US children without intellectual disability between 4 and 17 
years of age, 1.5% were estimated to have parent-reported vision problems not correctable 
with standard glasses or contact lenses. Among children in this cohort 8.4% (95% CI 8.0, 
8.8) were estimated to have a current diagnosis of ADHD. Children with vision problems 
account for an estimated 2.7% (95% CI 2.0, 3.4) of children with current ADHD. Children 
with vision problems were more likely to have a current diagnosis of ADHD than those 
without vision problems (15.6% vs. 8.3%; p<0.001). Children with vision problems were 
also more likely to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD (18.6% vs. 10.4%; p<0.001). For 
those with ADHD, children with vision problems were not more or less likely to receive 
medication for the condition (64.4% vs. 69.0%; p=0.46).
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for all children, according to vision problem status. 
The percentage of males was greater in the group with vision problems (58.8% vs. 50.9%; 
p=0.02). There was no difference in the prevalence of low birth weight between those with 
or without vision problems, however, those with vision problems were significantly more 
likely to be born 3 or more weeks prematurely (p<0.001). Families with children who have 
vision problems appear different in some respects to other US families. Children with vision 
problems were more likely to have family income less than 200% above the poverty line 
than children without vision problems (p=0.0002). Children with vision problems were more 
likely to have a family structure including 2 adoptive or biological parents (p=0.003) and to 
have at least one smoker in the household (p=0.02). However, they were similar to children 
without vision problems in many aspects, including race/ethnicity, primary language in the 
home being English, parental education and region of the U.S. where they resided as well as 
whether or not they resided in a Metropolitan Statistical Area. In multivariable analysis 
adjusting for the potential confounding variables in Table 1 (sex, premature birth, family 
structure, smoker in the family, and poverty level), having a vision problem was 
independently associated with current ADHD (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2, 2.7).
The associations of vision problems severity with current ADHD, the severity of ADHD and 
use of medication for ADHD were also evaluated (Table 2). Children with mild and 
moderate vision problems have increased odds of having current ADHD (OR 1.8, 95% CI 
(1.1, 2.9) and OR 2.6, 95% CI (1.6, 4.1), respectively) compared to children without vision 
problems. Children with severe vision problems were not at increased risk to have current 
ADHD (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8, 3.1). All levels of vision problems had increased odds of being 
in a more severe ADHD category (as rated by parent report) compared to children without 
vision problems. The odds of being in a more severe ADHD category were greatest for those 
with mild vision problems (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2, 3.0) and with moderate vision problems 
(OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.7, 4.4) compared to their peers with normal vision. While children with 
severe vision problems have increased odds of more severe ADHD level, the difference is

 not statistically different. No significant associations were found between the severity of 
vision problems and the use of medication for ADHD.
Table 3 examines only those children with ADHD and compares the odds ratios for children 
with vision problems to those without for many factors thought to be associated with 
ADHD. Children with vision problems and ADHD were similar to their normally sighted 
peers with ADHD with respect to sex, family member smoking status, language spoken at 
home, healthcare coverage, and family structure. Children with vision problems and ADHD, 
however were less likely to report Hispanic and more likely to report “other” as their race/
ethnicity compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Adjusting for all factors that were significant at 
the univariate level yielded similar results.
DISCUSSION
Results from this large national survey of children's health suggest an increased risk of 
ADHD among children with vision problems relative to other children. The prevalence of 
ADHD among children with vision problems from this national cross-sectional study is 
similar to that previously reported among children with low vision in a vision rehabilitation 
clinic in Alabama6 (18.6% vs. 22.9%, respectively). Likewise, the prevalence of ADHD 
among children without a vision problem is similar to that found in other national studies 
(8.3% in this study compared to 8.2% in the NHANES). Importantly, diagnosis in the 
NHANES was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-4 criteria 
and included clinical examination.
Although there were differences between the participants with vision problems and those 
without vision problems, none of those differences have been established as causes of 
ADHD. The cause of ADHD is still unknown and likely multi-factorial involving both 
genetic and environmental influences. Many factors have been found to be associated with 
ADHD such as maternal and paternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, blood 
lead level, as well as family history of ADHD.4 Here we provide evidence that vision 
problems are also independently associated with ADHD. Since the question regarding vision 
problems was non-specific, it is likely that parents responded affirmatively for many types of 
vision problems such as monocular vision loss, color vision deficiency or strabismus as well 
as for conditions resulting in vision impairment, suggesting that many different types of 
vision problems may be associated with ADHD.
Children with convergence insufficiency have been shown to have an increased prevalence 
of ADHD.10, 21 Children with ADHD have been shown to have an increased frequency of 
ametropia and visuoperceptual problems.8 It is probable that some of the children with 
vision problems whose parents classified their condition as mild had binocular vision 
anomalies. The odds of ADHD are lower among those with mild vision problems than 
among children in the moderate vision problems group. Children with obvious signs of 
vision problems (such as strabismus or nystagmus) would likely be categorized by their 
parents as having a more severe vision problem. Since vision plays such an important role in 
acquiring information, it is easy to see how vision problems might impact attention and how 
more severe vision problems would have a greater effect.

 It is likely that some children with vision problems are incorrectly identified as having 
ADHD. If children are unable to see something, they may not be able to keep their attention 
focused on it. Similarly, if they are struggling to see their work, they may have difficulty 
finishing in a timely manner. These problems may incorrectly be interpreted as ADHD. It is 
surprising and counterintuitive that the children with the most severe vision problems had 
increased odds of having ADHD but that the increase was not statistically significant (likely 
due to the small number of children in this category).
One intriguing possible explanation relates to utilization of executive function. Each 
individual has a finite amount of executive functioning (the higher order cognitive processes 
that enable people to plan, organize, pay attention and manage time and space).22 
Impairment of executive functioning is implicated in ADHD.23 Individuals with a sensory 
deficit will necessarily need to use more of their executive functioning to compensate for 
that deficit, leaving less executive function in reserve to change or maintain an attentional 
state. This theory is supported by the odds of having ADHD as well as the odds of having 
more severe ADHD being greatest among those with moderate vision problems. Those with 
moderate vision problems would likely need to use the largest amount of executive 
functioning to compensate for their vision impairment, while those with mild vision 
problems would need less. Those with severe vision problems may use other tools in their 
daily activities such as magnification, Braille or a white cane for mobility and may use less 
executive function to compensate for their vision impairment.
This study has several limitations common to survey based health research. The NSCH is a 
telephone survey and although parents were asked to report if a doctor or other healthcare 
provider had made a diagnosis of ADHD or vision problems, their report was not validated. 
Additionally, there is no information available on the cause or type of vision problem or 
about which type of health care provider made the ADHD diagnosis. The PLAY Study 
(Project to Learn About ADHD in Youth) has shown that case definition has a significant 
impact when determining ADHD prevalence.24 Thus, the prevalence found in this study is 
impacted by the varying criteria used by the doctors or health care providers who reportedly 
made the diagnosis. To further emphasize the difficulty in assessing ADHD prevalence, the 
PLAY Study found that less than 40% of children medicated for ADHD in one school 
district in South Carolina and five school districts in Oklahoma actually met Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for ADHD diagnosis.25 However, the 
opposite was found in a study utilizing data from the NHANES. Only 48% of children 
meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for ADHD 
according to a structured diagnostic interview had a parent-report of an ADHD diagnosis by 
a healthcare professional.26 There are undoubtedly both false positive and false negative 
reports of ADHD and/or vision problems in the dataset. The possibility of recall bias or 
intentional inaccurate reporting also exists.
A strength of this work is that the NSCH is a large national sample that was designed to be 
representative of non-institutionalized children in the U.S. and thus the results are 
generalizable. There is also evidence that parent report of ADHD has convergent validity 
with medical records and well-defined criteria.27 Although it would be preferable to have 
both psychological and optometric evaluations of the children, this data does strongly

 suggest that there is an association between vision problems and ADHD that merits further 
investigation.
In conclusion, there is an independent association between parent reported vision problems 
not correctable with standard glasses or contact lenses and ADHD even after adjusting for 
other factors known to be associated with ADHD. This finding suggests that children with 
vision problems should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ADHD so that this dual 
impairment of vision and attention can best be addressed. While eye care providers are not 
trained to diagnose nor treat ADHD, they should be aware that their patients with vision 
problems are at increased risk of having ADHD. If there is a suspicion of ADHD the 
primary care provider and/or a specialist in ADHD should be consulted. Future research 
should be directed toward longitudinal studies examining associations between type and 
severity of vision impairment and ADHD, the mechanisms underlying the association, as 
well as determining the most effective treatment strategies.
