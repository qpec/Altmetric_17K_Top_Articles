Abstract
Objectives—Determine whether adolescents’ intentions to smoke, cigarette-smoking behavior, 
and specific perceptions of cigarette-smoking are different in 2015 versus 2001.
Methods—Data from two California school-based studies (xage=14) were compared: one 
conducted in 2001–2002 (“2001”), N=395; the second in 2014–2015 (“2015”); N=282.
Results—In 2015 more participants reported it was very unlikely they would smoke (94% vs. 
65%) and never-smoked (95% vs. 74%); they reported perceiving less likelihood of looking more 
mature (17% vs. 28%) and greater likelihood of getting into trouble (86% vs. 77%), having a heart 
attack (76% vs. 69%), and contracting lung cancer (85% vs. 78%) from smoking (p’s < .001). 
Perceptions of short-term health problems and addiction were similar in 2001 and 2015
Conclusions—Findings suggest that adolescents in 2015 perceived greater risks compared to 
2001 even amidst the rapidly changing tobacco product landscape. In addition to continuing 
messages of long-term health risks, prevention efforts should include messages about addiction 
and short-term health and social risks.

INTRODUCTION
Adolescent cigarette use decreased significantly from 2001 to 2015,1 due largely to smoke-

 perceptions of smoking risks and changing social norms.2 Given the link between smoking-
related perceptions, social norms, and cigarette initiation3 one can hypothesize that tobacco 
control efforts would have increased perceived risks and decreased perceived acceptability. 
However, the recent proliferation of novel tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes (e-
cigarettes) has public health professionals and tobacco control advocates fearing a 
“renormalization” of smoking that could erode decades of tobacco-control gains.4 Indeed, 
adolescents hold favorable attitudes towards e-cigarettes and believe they are a healthier 
alternative to cigarettes.5 It could thus be hypothesized that adolescents hold more favorable 
views of cigarettes, compared to in 2001.
These competing hypotheses question if and how specific cigarette-related perceptions differ 
between adolescents in 2015 and 2001. Knowing which adolescent smoking-related 
perceptions have changed is timely and important, and will inform health education 
messaging aimed at preventing adolescent tobacco use.2 We aimed to determine whether 
adolescents’ specific cigarette-related perceptions of risks, benefits, and social norms; 
intentions to smoke cigarettes; and smoking behavior differed between 2015 and 2001.
METHODS
Participants and procedure
A convenience sample of large high schools with a stable and diverse student population was 
recruited; over 50% of invited schools agreed to participate. Sample size allowed sufficient 
power (80%) to detect the contrasts of interest in both 2001 and 2015. Participants in 2001–
2002 (“2001”) were recruited from 9th grade in two Northern California high schools 
(N=395; 53% female; 48% white; Xage 14, SD = 0.4); they completed the survey during 
class.3 Participants in 2014–2015 (“2015”) were recruited from classes in 10 other high 
schools throughout California (N=282; 60% female; 36% white; Xage 14.1, SD = 1.6); they 
completed the survey online, via Qualtrics.5 Surveys contained nearly identical detailed 
measures of smoking perceptions, intentions to use, and ever-use of cigarettes, as described 
below.3,3,5
Measures
The measures used in this study have been used in past studies; and reliability and predictive 
validity of these measures have been assessed.5,6,6
Ever-smoked—Participants indicated how many times they had ever, in their entire life, 
smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs.
Behavioral intentions—Participants indicated how likely they were to initiate smoking in 
the next 6 months, from “definitely will” to “definitely will not.”
Social norms—Participants were asked out of 100 teens their age, about how many they 
think had tried smoking a cigarette?
Perceptions—Participants read the following text: Whether or not you have used any of 
these products, imagine that you JUST BEGAN USING cigarettes. You use it about 2 to 3

 times a day, every day. Sometimes you use it alone and sometimes you use it with friends. If 
you use cigarettes 2 to 3 times each day, what is the chance that… followed by several social 
and health short-term and long-term risks and benefits (see Table 1). Participants were asked 
to gauge the likelihood of experiencing each outcome from 0–100% given the above 
scenario.
Analyses
Sample means were compared using independent samples t-tests; chi-square test for 
significance was used to test differences in proportion. Unless noted, all reported differences 
are significant at α ≤ 0.003 pursuant to Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
Analyses were conducted using SPSS 23 or Epi Info 7.
RESULTS
Samples differed by ethnicity, but not by age, sex, or SES (maternal education). Intraclass 
correlations revealed no difference in ever-smoking by school (both overall and by year). 
Fewer participants in 2015 (vs. 2001) reported ever-smoking (by gender: 5% vs. 25% girls; 
6% vs. 28% boys), and more participants in 2015 reported it was “very unlikely” they would 
try smoking in the next 6 months (95% girls and 93% boys vs. 65% for both). Compared to 
2001, participants in 2015 perceived lower smoking prevalence among peers (49% vs. 39% 
girls; 40% vs. 27% boys); less likelihood of experiencing the benefit of looking more mature 
or grown-up; greater likelihood of getting in trouble, having a heart attack, and developing 
lung cancer; and similar likelihood of experiencing most short-term benefits and health 
problems, becoming addicted, and still smoking in 5 years (Table 1). In 2001 gender 
differences were found in perceived likelihood of friends being upset with them (85% girls 
vs. 74% boys) and of getting into trouble for smoking (81% vs. 73%).
DISCUSSION
Compared to 2001, fewer participants in 2015 had ever-smoked or intended to smoke. They 
perceived less likelihood of looking more mature or grown-up; less social acceptability of 
smoking; and greater likelihood of experiencing long-term health problems. These findings 
provide support for the hypothesis that amidst tobacco control efforts and health messaging 
of the past 15 years, adolescents would hold less favorable attitudes towards cigarettes. 
Efforts have included: (1) clean indoor air legislation and smoke-free policies;2 (2) increased 
numbers of adults trying to quit smoking, reinforcing perceptions of smoking-
unacceptability;7 (3) the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Control Act, which resulted 
in renewed tobacco control efforts;8 and (4) public health programming such as CDC’s Tips 
from Former Smokers that warned of smoking-related hazards and the addictive nature of 
nicotine.9
Our findings do not support the hypothesis that due to rapidly increasing e-cigarette use 
among adolescents, perceptions of cigarettes have become more favorable.4 However, given 
that adolescents hold more favorable attitudes towards e-cigarettes,5 are using e-cigarettes at 
high rates, are more likely to use cigarettes if they used e-cigarettes,10 and that e-cigarettes

 are largely unregulated, it is possible that cigarette-smoking perceptions could reverse and 
lead to increases in adolescent cigarette-smoking.
Perceptions of short-term harm and addiction were unchanged, illuminating areas for 
improved messaging to prevent both cigarette and e-cigarette uptake. Such health messages 
are critical given the relationship between perceptions and tobacco use3 and that nicotine 
addiction is not well understood.11
Both studies were conducted in California; results may not be generalizable throughout the 
United States or internationally. Nevertheless, this study uses data collected with nearly 
identical surveys from similar samples, 14-years apart, to report changes in specific 
cigarette-smoking perceptions amidst a rapidly changing tobacco product landscape. Though 
samples differed in ethnic distribution, post-hoc analysis revealed no difference in outcomes 
when controlling for ethnicity. Perceptions most changed correlated with the strongest and 
most common tobacco-control messages. Such perceptions, shown to be modifiable and to 
result in sustained change of cigarette-smoking perceptions, should continue to be targeted 
with expanded messages that include e-cigarettes. To better explain trends in perceptions and 
more succinctly relate them to tobacco control efforts or public health programming, shorter 
intervals between measurements are needed.

 IMPLICATIONS
More cigarette-related risk and less social acceptability were reported in a sample of 9th 
graders in 2015 compared to a sample of 9th graders in 2001. Perceptions that changed 
most correlated with the strongest, most common tobacco-control messages. Tobacco 
control efforts should continue targeting cigarette-smoking perceptions shown to result in 
sustained change with broad-based prevention programs including e-cigarettes.
