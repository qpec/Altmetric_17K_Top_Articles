Abstract The spatial organization of synaptic inputs on the dendritic tree of cortical neurons
plays a major role for dendritic integration and neural computations, yet, remarkably little is known
about it. We mapped the spatial organization of glutamatergic synapses between layer 5 pyramidal
cells by combining optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging in mouse neocortical slices. To
mathematically characterize the organization of inputs we developed an approach based on
combinatorial analysis of the likelihoods of specific synapse arrangements. We found that the
synapses of intralaminar inputs form clusters on the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells.
These clusters contain 4 to 14 synapses within �30 mm of dendrite. According to the
spatiotemporal characteristics of synaptic summation, these numbers suggest that there will be
non-linear dendritic integration of synaptic inputs during synchronous activation.

Introduction
Computations on the level of single neurons critically depend on the location and spatial relationship
between active synapses (e.g. Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011; Losonczy and Magee, 2006;
Polsky et al., 2004). Thus knowing the connectivity of neurons with single synapse resolution is
essential to understand how synaptic integration at the cellular level contributes to neural circuit
function. One type of spatial organization is of particular interest. These are clusters of synaptic
inputs, which can give rise to superlinear summation during synchronous activity (e.g. DeBello et al.,
2014; Larkum and Nevian, 2008; Mel, 1993). Clustering has been reported for synchronously
active synapses during spontaneous activity (Kleindienst et al., 2011; Takahashi et al., 2012), for
synapses undergoing plasticity (Makino and Malinow, 2011; McBride et al., 2008) as well as for
synapses from anatomically defined populations of presynaptic neurons (Druckmann et al., 2014;
Rah et al., 2013). However, the cluster parameters relevant for dendritic computations are not rigor-
ously and quantitatively assessed. Furthermore, in different cortical areas the patterns of synapses
activated by sensory stimulation suggest that inputs onto central neurons may not be clustered
(Chen et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2010; Varga et al., 2011). Here we address two issues: First, we
explore the spatial arrangement of synapses of an anatomically defined intracortical connection, i.e.
the intralaminar connection between layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Secondly, we analyze the spatial
organization of synapses with a novel method for identifying individual synapse clusters. This allows
characterizing cluster parameters, such as dendritic length and number of inputs, in order to put
them into the perspective of the rules of dendritic integration and the arithmetic of synaptic summa-
tion (e.g. Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011; Losonczy and Magee, 2006; Polsky et al., 2004).

For mapping the synapses between layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells in mouse primary visual cortex (V1)
we
combined
optogenetics
and
2-photon
calcium
imaging
(Little
and
Carter,
2012;
MacAskill et al., 2012), which we refer to as Channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-assisted synapse identity
mapping (CASIM). The principle of CASIM is depicted in Figure 1A: NMDA receptor mediated Ca2+
signals identify those dendritic spines on a postsynaptic neuron, which receive input from photosti-
mulated presynaptic neurons expressing ChR2. CASIM has the advantage over other methods for
mapping synapses by light or electron microscopy (e.g. Druckmann et al., 2014; Rah et al., 2013)
that it identifies synapses in functional rather than only in structural or molecular terms. For presyn-
aptic expression of ChR2, we used transgenic mice expressing ChR2-YFP under control of the THY1
promoter in L5 pyramidal cells (line 18; Wang et al., 2007; Figure 1B). Expression levels and stimu-
lus sensitivity were different from cell to cell. High photostimulus intensities evoked electrical
responses in all probed L5 pyramidal cells. Because in more sensitive cells the number of generated
action potentials dropped with higher stimulus intensities, we applied an intermediate stimulus
intensity for synapse mapping, which evoked action potentials in 58% of L5 pyramidal cells (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1,2). For synapse mapping we selected layer 5 pyramidal cells with no
detectable ChR2-YFP fluorescence, indicating that the levels of ChR2 expression are so low that the
selected stimulus intensity is insufficient to cause significant depolarization. For recording calcium
signals in spines of postsynaptic L5 pyramidal cells, we patched and filled cells with Alexa 594 (30
mM) and Fluo-5F (1 mM) in acute slices. In order to isolate NMDA receptor mediated calcium signals
and prevent spreading of unspecific excitation, patched cells were depolarized to 10 mV above the
NMDAR reversal potential in voltage clamp in extracellular solution containing NBQX (10 mM), picro-
toxin (50 mM) and D-serine (10 mM). Synapses between pairs of L5 pyramidal cells are reported to be
located to a large extend on the proximal basal dendrite of the postsynaptic cell (Markram et al.,
1997; Sjostro
¨m and Ha
¨usser, 2006). Therefore we focused on the basal dendrites of L5 pyramidal
cells to map their inputs from other L5 pyramidal cells. Basal dendritic branches were systematically
scanned with overlapping rectangular tiles of 2-photon calcium imaging to probe all spines for pho-
tostimulus-evoked calcium signals. Figure 1C shows a sequence of calcium imaging frames zoomed
in on two spines, where the left spine shows a clear synaptic calcium signal. Due to the stochastic
nature of neurotransmitter release, it is not expected that each AP leads to transmitter release. Thus
we classified spines as receiving L5 input if they displayed at least once a higher (�3�standard devi-
ation) and earlier peak calcium signal evoked by photostimulation than observed in the parent den-
drite (Figure 1D - 1G). In Figure 1E L5 input positive (L5+) spines are marked by white arrowheads
eLife digest Neurons in the brain exchange information through points of contact called
synapses. If electrical activity arriving at a number of synapses exceeds a certain threshold, it can
trigger an electrical impulse, which is transmitted to the next neuron. Synapses generally connect
with branch-like structures called dendrites on the receiving neuron. However, little is known about
how synapses are arranged on dendrites.

¸e et al. have now used a technique called optogenetics to work out the exact arrangement
of a type of synapse on neurons in a part of the mouse brain that is devoted to vision. Optogenetics
takes advantage of light-activated proteins that can trigger electrical activity. Go
¨ kc
¸e et al. used mice
that had been genetically engineered to produce these proteins in specific neurons, and then
deliberately triggered electrical activity simply by shining light on these neurons. The experiments
also used another technique called two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of single
synapses in response to the electrical activity triggered by optogenetics.
Go
¨ kc
¸e et al. found that these neurons have clusters of four to fourteen synapses within a space of
30 micrometers along a dendrite. Synapses in clusters that are active at the same time can interact
and thereby generate electrical signals more effectively than synapses spread across the dendrites.
Further experiments are now needed to map the synapses between other kinds of neurons, and to
map synapses from two different inputs at the same time.

 on a dendritic stretch. In total, out of 2168 analyzed spines, 199 were L5 input positive (9.2%, n = 20
cells). The average peak calcium signal amplitude in successful trials (DG/R = 0.48 ± 0.01) was signifi-
cantly higher than the calcium signal in the parent dendrite (DG/R=0.18 ± 0.005, p<0.001, n = 199
spines; Figure 1G). There was no significant difference in the morphological properties of L5+ spines
and L5 input negative (L5-) spines (length: L5+, 1.23 ± 0.06 mm, n = 76; L5-, 1.11 ± 0.02 mm, n = 419;
p=0.04; normalized volume: L5+, 1.00 ± 0.08, n = 77; L5-, 1.00 ± 0.03, n = 437; p=0.97; Figure 1—
figure supplement 3A,B).
The number of L5+ spines scaled with the total number of probed spines (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 3C) but displayed a high degree of heterogeneity between cells (4% to 29%) and individual
dendritic segments (3% to 50%) as has been previously reported for Schaffer collateral synapses
(Druckmann et al., 2014). The classical analysis of the distribution of pairwise nearest neighbor dis-
tances applied to L5+ spines (e.g. Druckmann et al., 2014; Rah et al., 2013; Takahashi et al.,
2012) revealed significantly shorter recorded distances than expected from a random distribution
(Figure 2A), suggesting that L5 inputs are clustered.
In order to place the clustered arrangement of synapses into the framework of the known rules of
dendritic integration and arithmetic of synaptic summation (e.g. Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011;
Losonczy and Magee, 2006; Polsky et al., 2004), it is necessary to identify individual clusters so as
to characterize for example their size and the number of inputs they receive. This means to go
beyond the classical pairwise analysis of nearest neighbor distances. To this end, we developed a
new approach for the identification of individual synapse clusters based on combinatorial analysis of
the likelihood of specific synapse arrangements (Material and methods; Figure 2B).
We identified 12 clusters of L5+ spines on the basal dendrites of 20 cells (Figure 2C and Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1). These clusters extend over roughly 15 mm with, on average, approxi-
mately 8 spines (dendritic length, 12.52 ± 2.40 mm; 7.17 ± 0.94 L5+ spines; density, 0.84 ± 0.19 L5+
spines/mm; ratio of L5+ over all spines within the cluster, 0.48 ± 0.04; Figure 2E,F and Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 2A; n = 12 clusters). Almost 50% of all L5+ spines were part of a cluster (86 out of
199). There is a possibility, that due to the slicing procedure some inputs may be missed. We esti-
mate that the size of spine clusters could be underestimated by a factor between 1.4 and 2 (see
Material and methods; Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This result shows that in the cortex cluster
of synapses of an anatomically defined intracortical connection exist, which have the required size
and spacing to be relevant for non-linear dendritic computations (�4 synapses within 30 mm of den-
drite; see e.g. Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011; Losonczy and Magee, 2006; Polsky et al., 2004). Fur-
thermore, the scale of these clusters is in line with local learning rules (Engert and Bonhoeffer,
1999; Harvey and Svoboda, 2007), which might play a role in cluster formation and furthermore in
synapse interactions within the cluster during synaptic plasticity.
Discussion
Our results address a pressing question in the field of neural signal processing: How are the synap-
ses of neocortical connections spatially organized on the dendrites of cortical neurons and how do
the spatial patterns relate to the known rules of dendritic integration and the rules of spatiotemporal
synaptic summation (e.g. Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011; Losonczy and Magee, 2006; Polsky et al.,
2004)?
To address this question we mapped the intralaminar synapses between L5 pyramidal neurons in
visual cortex by combining optogenetics and 2-photon calcium imaging (CASIM; Little and Carter,
2012; MacAskill et al., 2012). Our results show clustering of these synapses on the basal dendrites
of L5 pyramidal neurons. For quantitative analysis of the spatial organization we developed a new
method for the identification of individual synapse clusters and characterization of cluster
parameters.
Our results are in contrast to previous studies mapping sensory inputs in different neocortical
areas, which reported no obvious spatial structure in input patterns and suggested that local non-lin-
ear dendritic integration may not be important for sensory processing in the cortex (Chen et al.,
2011; Jia et al., 2010; Varga et al., 2011). However, more recent studies provided evidence for
non-linear computations during cortical processing (Lavzin et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2013;
Xu et al., 2012). A potential explanation for this apparent contradiction (DeBello et al., 2014) is
that in the experiments described here, we stimulate a well-defined set of neurons, while inputs

 which are defined by the same sensory stimulus (Chen et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2010; Varga et al.,
2011) are in all likelihood arising from a mix of genetically/anatomically defined types of neurons.
Input clustering has been shown for axodendritic contacts in the barn owl auditory system
(McBride et al., 2008), and more recently, in mice, for thalamocortical (Rah et al., 2013) and hippo-
campal CA3-CA1 synapses (Druckmann et al., 2014). In all of these cases however there is no quan-
tification of cluster parameters, which is crucial if one wants to relate the findings to any kind of
biophysical model of dendritic computation. In this way our data and analysis go considerably
beyond these reports by identifying individual clusters and quantifying cluster parameters, such as
for example the number of inputs per cluster.
Our novel method for spatial cluster analysis by combinatorial statistics is not limited to the syn-
aptic connections described here. It can be applied to characterize any distribution or pattern of syn-
apses on the postsynaptic dendrite as obtained for example by large scale electron microscopy,
GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners, array tomography or mapping of synaptic activity (e.g
Bock et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Druckmann et al., 2014; Kleindienst et al., 2011; Rah et al.,
2013; Takahashi et al., 2012), as well as any other data regarding the spatial organization of struc-
tures along a one dimensional axis like for example the distribution of presynaptic boutons along an
axon (e.g. Schuemann et al., 2013).
Our results show that the clusters of intracortical connections between L5 pyramidal neurons con-
tain 4 to 14 synapses within 30 mm of basal dendrite. According to the known rules of dendritic

Median values of recorded and reshuffled data are significantly different (data, median = 3.10 mm; simulations, median = 5.02 ± 0.43 mm; p<0.0001).The
plot of the difference between inter-input distances from experiments and simulations (purple) shows that the deviation is most pronounced for small
inter-input distances below 10 mm with a peak deviation around 5 mm, suggesting a clustered arrangement of L5+ spines. (B) Combinatorial cluster
analysis: Illustration of the principle of calculating the specific ensemble likelihood (combinatorial cluster analysis step 2). Top, example of a dendritic
segment with N = 30 spines in total and n = 5 L5+ spines (red). m = 4 L5+ spines are part of an input ensemble of size M = 6 spines (gray box) by
fulfilling the maximal nearest neighbor distance criterion of 4crit = 2 (blue bar; cluster analysis step 1). The ensemble is flanked by ’gaps’ of L5- spines
(gray brackets). As illustrated below, the likelihood for observing an ensemble of M = 6 spines with m = 4 L5+ spines is determined by three factors:
The number or ways the L5+ spines can be distributed inside the ensemble, the number of ways the remaining L5+ spines can be distributed outside of
the ensemble and the number of ways an ensemble of the given size can be placed on the dendritic segment. Bottom left, all

 integration and the spatiotemporal arithmetic of synaptic summation (Branco and Ha
¨usser, 2011;
Losonczy and Magee, 2006; Polsky et al., 2004) such clusters would result in superlinear dendritic
integration during synchronous synaptic activity. Superlinear integration can also occur without tight
clustering (Branco et al., 2010; Losonczy and Magee, 2006), but the specifics of the spatial input
organization are expected to define how different temporal activity patterns determine the firing
pattern of the postsynaptic cell. Our results are well explained by local learning rules, which may not
only be involved in cluster formation but also support interactions among synapses in a cluster dur-
ing synaptic plasticity events (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999; Harvey and Svoboda, 2007). They are
also in line with observations of spatially clustered spontaneous activity of synapses during
development (Kleindienst et al., 2011; Takahashi et al., 2012) and clustered spine formation and
synaptic potentiation during learning and experience-dependent plasticity (Fu et al., 2012;
Makino and Malinow, 2011). A further potential role of input clusters may be to overcome the sto-
chasticity of neurotransmitter release and help to increase the reliability of synaptic transmission
(Bagnall et al., 2011).
Typically connections between L5 pyramidal cells consist of 4 to 8 synapses, which are distributed
over different branches of the postsynaptic dendrite (Deuchars et al., 1994; Markram et al., 1997).
This suggests that the synapses within L5 input clusters most likely arise from a set of presynaptic
neurons rather than a single one. Nevertheless, synchronous activation of L5 inputs within a cluster is
expected to occur during L5 network oscillations (e.g. Buffalo et al., 2011; Sun and Dan, 2009). In
anesthetized rats, L5 pyramidal cells in visual cortex receive synchronously oscillating excitatory
inputs (Sun and Dan, 2009), which are thought to arise from rhythmically firing L5 pyramidal cells
(Flint and Connors, 1996; Silva et al., 1991) within the network of L5 pyramidal cells (Mark-
ram, 1997). Similar oscillations in L5 have been observed in awake animals (e.g. Buffalo et al.,
2011).
In conclusion, our results, to our knowledge, provide the first characterization of synapse clusters
arising from an anatomically and genetically defined input on the dendritic tree of cortical pyramidal
cells. Only such quantitative analysis of the spatial organization of inputs together with the rules of
dendritic integration and synaptic summation will allow working out the logical operations of neural
computations at the cellular level, which are critical for understanding information processing in neu-
ral circuits.
Materials and methods
All experiments were conducted in compliance with the institutional guidelines of the Max Planck
Society and the local government (Regierung von Oberbayern).
Brain slice preparation
300 mm thick acute coronal slices of primary visual cortex were prepared from THY1-ChR2 (line 18)
mice (Wang et al., 2007) between postnatal day 40 and 55 in choline-based ACSF (in mM, 110 cho-
line chloride, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 Na-L-
ascorbate, 3.1 Na-pyruvate, aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2) at 0˚C (Scheuss et al., 2006) after perfus-
ing the animal with the same solution. Slices of the separated hemispheres were incubated at 35˚C
for one hour and then stored at room temperature in normal ACSF (in mM, 127 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25
NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 25 D-glucose, aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2)
(Scheuss et al., 2006) until the recordings.
Photostimulus calibration and specificity testing
Cell activity was measured by cell attached recordings using patch pipettes filled with (in mM) 10
KCl, 140 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 0.05 Alexa 594, pH 7.25. The seal resistance was
20–40 MW. For obtaining ChR2 dose-response curves, light-evoked activity at blindly selected L5
pyramidal neurons was measured at increasing illumination power (1, 2, 4, 6, 9 mW at objective back
aperture; see section Imaging Experiments) and pulse widths (2 and 5 ms) in the same ACSF solution
used for mapping experiments, but additionally containing 10 mM CPP. To verify the specificity of
photostimulation of L5 neurons, the activity of neurons in other cortical layers was measured in
response to the same light stimulation at L5 and in the same ACSF solution as used for mapping
experiments.

 Mapping experiments
Experiments were performed at room temperature in normal ACSF containing in addition (in mM) 10
NBQX, 50 picrotoxin and 10 D-serine, on a custom built two-photon laser-scanning microscope con-
trolled with Labview (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) based custom imaging software. L5
pyramidal cells with undetectable or low levels of ChR2-YFP expression in primary visual cortex were
visually identified (2-photon imaging at 920 nm excitation) and patched in whole-cell voltage clamp
mode (access resistance 10–30 MW; internal solution, in mM, 125 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES,
10 Na2phosphocreatine, 4 MgCl2, 4 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 3 Na-L-ascorbate, 5 QX-314, 10 TEA-Cl,
1 Fluo-5F, 0.03 Alexa 594, pH 7.3). Cells were filled for �10 min at resting potential and then depo-
larized to 10 mV above the NMDAR reversal potential to remove the Mg2+ block from NMDARs
(Oertner et al., 2002). Since in adulthood the occurrence of ‘silent’ synapses is effectively negligible
(Rumpel et al., 1998) NMDA receptor mediated calcium signals are expected to identify functional
synapses containing both AMPA and NMDA receptors. The photostimulus (470 nm LED; Rapp
OptoElectronic GmbH, Wedel, Germany) consisted of 3 pulses of 2 ms at 30 Hz (4 mW at the objec-
tive back-aperture) and was applied via the fluorescence excitation path of the microscope to the
full field of view. It evoked on average 1.57 ± 0.54 (n = 12) action potentials selectively in 58% of the
ChR2 expressing L5 neurons (Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2). Dendritic branches were system-
atically scanned with overlapping rectangular tiles (5�19.8 mm2) at 810 nm excitation. Rotation of
the tiles was adjusted to fit spines and parent dendritic segment optimally in the field of view. For
calcium imaging, 50 frames (pixel size 100 x 100 nm2) of single z-planes were acquired at 10 Hz in
green (Fluo-5F) and red (Alexa 594) channel in the following sequence: First frame with laser shutter
closed for measuring electrical offsets, 5 frames baseline before photostimulation, 2 frames with
PMTs protected by a shutter during photostimulation, and 42 frames after the photostimulation. At
every dendritic tile location, calcium imaging was repeated at least 3 times per z-plane (interstimulus
interval, �10 s) at multiple z-planes to cover every spine, and an image stack was taken at higher
resolution (voxel size, 50 � 50 � 1000 nm3).
Input detection and structural analysis
Data were analyzed with custom software in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA; Source code 1).
Spine heads and their bases on the parent dendrite were marked with rectangular ROIs, and the
dendritic segments were traced in reconstructions based on averaged red channel frames from cal-
cium imaging or the maximum z-projections of the image stacks at each tile position stitched
together based on cross-correlations. Spine calcium signals (4G/R) were calculated as change in
fluorescence of the calcium indicator Fluo-5F (DG) normalized to the mean intensity of the structural
marker Alexa 594 (R) averaged over the brightest 70% of ROI pixels in the red channel. Dendrite
calcium signals at the spine bases were calculated identically but without any pixel selection. DG/R
signals were smoothed (3-point moving average) and the peak amplitude in the 2nd to 4th time
point after the stimulus as well as the standard deviations in the baseline interval and during the last
five time points were determined. A spine was classified as receiving L5 input (L5 positive, L5+) if its
peak DG/R exceeded in one trial the dendritic peak DG/R plus three times the higher value of the
two standard deviations. We never observed large dendritic DG/R signals at input clusters, which
could lead to false negative spine categorization according to this classification, because spine/den-
drite coupling is usually low (Sabatini et al., 2002) and simultaneous activation of many spines
within a cluster was very rare. The results of the classification algorithm for spine calcium signals
were verified manually. Acquisitions with high noise in the calcium signal due to low fluorescence
intensity, e.g. from small or out of focus spines, and without an evident difference between the
spine and the dendrite calcium signal were classified as false-positives. Acquisitions with noticeable
difference in spine and dendrite calcium signal, but classified by the algorithm as no response either
due to a fast decaying spine calcium signal, or because spine and the dendrite calcium signal were
of similar magnitude although the spine signal peak occurred earlier, were labeled as false-nega-
tives. Acquisitions where a subjective decision was not possible were classified as ambiguous and
treated as no response. In the individual traces (n = 15293 acquisitions), the total discrepancy
between manual verification and the classification by the algorithm was 2.37%, which translated into
a total discrepancy of 6.46% with respect to the input classification (0.55% false negatives, 4.2%
false positives, 1.71% ambiguous; n = 2168 spines). CASIM might miss synapses with very low

 release probability but otherwise the false negative rate is mostly determined by the fraction of pre-
synaptic neurons not expressing ChR2 as with other approaches relying on the expression of
markers of any kind (e.g. Druckmann et al., 2014; Rah et al., 2013). However, since undersampling
the presynaptic population is expected to be random, this would not introduce artifacts of non-ran-
dom structure in the mapped synapse distribution. Positions of spines on the dendrite were
extracted from 3D reconstructions of dendrite traces in time-lapse acquisitions. The location of a
spine was defined to be the point on the dendrite trace with the shortest orthogonal distance to
the center of the spine head.
Cluster analysis
The combinatorial cluster analysis substantially extends the classical pairwise analysis of nearest
neighbor distances (e.g. Druckmann et al., 2014; Rah et al., 2013) as it allows to identify and char-
acterize individual clusters. The advantage of the combinatorial approach over the estimation of like-
lihoods using e.g. random reshuffling (e.g. (Takahashi et al., 2012; Yadav et al., 2012) is that it
provides exact values for the small likelihoods involved, for which reliable estimates would require
prohibitively large numbers of rounds of reshuffling. The combinatorial cluster analysis proceeds in
five steps:
Step 1: Identification of input ensembles
To identify aggregations of inputs, which represent potential clusters, we first defined input ensem-
bles using as criterion the distance between nearest neighbor L5+ spines to be �4crit = 10 mm
(e.g. Takahashi et al., 2012) (Figure 2B, blue bar). We found 45 input ensembles in 20 cells (total
analyzed dendritic length 2718 mm; Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, gray boxes).
Step 2: Calculation of the specific ensemble likelihood
The specific ensemble likelihood of an ensemble is the likelihood that such ensemble of inputs
occurs anywhere on the dendritic segment when the inputs are randomly assigned to the spines. It is
calculated by determining the number of all possible ways of realizing such an ensemble divided by
the total number of possibilities for assigning the inputs to the spines. As illustrated in Figure 2B for
uniform inter-spine distances, the number of ways to realize a particular ensemble depends on (i) the
number of ways the particular number of inputs can be assigned to the number of spines within the
ensemble (Figure 2B, bottom, left); (ii) the number of ways the remaining inputs can be assigned to
the spines outside the ensemble and its flanking gaps (Figure 2B, bottom, middle); and (iii) the num-
ber of possible positions of such ensemble on the dendritic segment (Figure 2B, bottom, right).
Accounting for the gaps is necessary, because inputs to spines within the gaps would otherwise be
part of the ensemble, which would then have a correspondingly larger size.
In the case of non-uniform distances an ensemble type is defined as the subset of ensembles of
length �lM, which contain �m spines, of which �m receive the specific input (Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 4B). The number of possible input arrangements for an ensemble type is obtained by mov-
ing along the segment spine by spine and calculating the number of possible input assignments for
the number of spines inside and outside of the ensemble and gaps if the ensemble definition is satis-
fied, which depends on the local spine density (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). The likelihood
that m spines with the specific input (e.g. here L5 inputs) form an ensemble of size lM on a dendritic
segment with N spines in total and n of these spines receiving the specific input in total is:

The first term in the sum of Equation 1 accounts for the number of ways to assign m-2 inputs to
an ensemble of MlM
i
m
ð Þ-2 spines at position i. 2 is subtracted because inputs to the first and last
spine are fixed to exclude empty ensemble edges (Figure 2B, bottom left; Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 4B). The second term in the sum accounts for the number of ways for assigning the remaining
n-m inputs to the spines outside of the ensemble and leading and trailing gap (Figure 2B, bottom
middle). The sum runs over all spine positions on the dendritic segment (Figure 2B, bottom right).
The denominator normalizes by the total number of possibilities for assigning n inputs to N spines.
The gap length corresponds to the nearest neighbor distance criterion lg =4crit since an ensemble is
delimited by those inputs, of which the preceding or following inputs are further away than the near-
est neighbor distance criterion (Figure 2B, top; Figure 2—figure supplement 4B).
The specific ensemble likelihood (SEL) to observe a particular ensemble type is then the sum of
Equation 1 over all inputs available, which fit into the ensemble of size lM according to the ensemble
definition above:

The specific ensemble likelihoods for the observed ensembles of L5+ spines are provided in the
dendrograms in Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (red numbers next to gray boxes).
Step 3: Classification of ensembles as clusters
The specific ensemble likelihood (Equation 2) is then used to classify ensembles as clusters based
on an empirical upper likelihood threshold of 1% (compare Bendels et al., 2010). The rationale
behind this is that local aggregations of inputs are considered as clusters only if the probability that
they would occur by chance is low. Defining ensembles of at least three inputs with a likelihood �1%
as cluster, we classified 12 out of 45 ensembles as clusters (mean specific ensemble likelihood=0.003
± 0.0008; Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, red asterisks). Ensembles, which fulfill the
specific cluster likelihood threshold, but which encompass the whole dendritic segment (dN - d1 �
lM � dN - d1 - 2 lg and m = n) are not considered to qualify as a cluster.
This step is sufficient to identify clusters for their characterization. The following steps serve fur-
ther confirmation of the presence of clusters and the appropriateness of the choice of the specific
ensemble likelihood threshold.
Step 4: Calculation of the overall cluster likelihood for input clusters
The fourth step is concerned with the likelihood to observe any type of cluster on a dendritic seg-
ment for comparing the numbers of expected and observed segments, which contain a cluster. This
overall cluster likelihood (OCL) is determined by considering all possible ensemble types (see exam-
ple in Figure 2—figure supplement 4A), calculating their specific ensemble likelihoods (SEL, Equa-
tion 2), and adding up those, which are equal or below the specific ensemble likelihood (Step 3) of
the cluster for which the overall cluster likelihood is calculated:

 the observed clusters of L5+ spines are provided in the dendrograms in Figure 2C and Figure 2—
figure supplement 1 (black numbers below gray boxes with red asterisks).
Step 5: Comparison of the observed and expected numbers of dendritic
segments containing an input cluster
In the final step, the overall cluster likelihood is used to calculate the probability of finding a cluster
in 12 out of 40 analyzed segments. Since the overall cluster likelihood (OCL) is different in different
segments, we sorted its values in ascending order (Figure 2—figure supplement 5A). The probabil-
ity to obtain at least c segments containing a cluster with an of OCL � OCLmax(c) in the data set of S
segments (in the present case 40) is calculated by binomial statistics from the maximal overall cluster
likelihood OCLmax(c) as upper bound on OCL:

For this analysis only dendritic segments with a length of �20 mm were included. This probability
is equivalent to the P value of the binomial test for the null hypothesis that the number of observed
segments with an input cluster arises from a random input distribution (Yadav et al., 2012). We find
that the probability to observe c segments containing a cluster in the data set of 40 segments in
total declines and remains below the significance threshold of 0.001 until the second last of the
sorted segments (Figure 2—figure supplement 5B). The last segment with a cluster has a compara-
tively high OCL value (Figure 2—figure supplement 5A), which drives the probability to observe
the given number of segments with a cluster above the significance threshold. However, the number
of 11 segments with a cluster with a P value below 0.001 supports the hypothesis that L5+ spines
are indeed arranged in clusters not by chance. This step serves further as confirmation for the appro-
priate choice of the cluster criterion in step 3.
Estimation of missed L5 inputs due to slicing
To estimate the fraction of missed L5 inputs resulting from the slicing procedure we calculated the
radial axon density A(r) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B) of L5 pyramidal cell axons in mouse visual
cortex based on the Sholl analysis by Blackman et al., 2014 (their Figure 2C, 2nd panel from left) as
A r
ð Þ ¼ number of crossings at r

(5)
The average axon density arising from presynaptic L5 neurons at a distance r from a dendritic
location is given by the radial axon density of L5 pyramidal cells at the distance of r from the soma.
For calculating the remaining fraction of presynaptic neurons contributing to the axon density at a
dendritic location at a depth of D in a slice of thickness T, three cases have to be distinguished (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 3A). The neuron density is assumed to be uniform and therefore needs
not to be explicitly considered in the following equations:
Case 1: Spherical shell around dendritic location in slice is complete, 0 < r < D (Figure 2—figure
supplement 3A, top panel)
The volume of a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is
V r
ð Þ ¼ 4pr2dr
(6)
Case 2: Spherical shell around dendritic location in slice with one cap missing, D < r < T-D (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 3A, middle panel)
The volume of a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr with one cap of height h = r-D sub-
tracted is
V r
ð Þ ¼ 4pr2 � 2prh

dr ¼ 2pr r þ D

(Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, bottom panel)

 The maximal radius rmax denotes here the maximal radial extent of the average axonal density.
The volume of a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr with top cap of height h1 = r-D and bot-
tom cap of height h2 = r-(T-D) subtracted is
V r
ð Þ ¼ 4pr2 � 2prh1 � 2prh2

Combining these equations yields the remaining fraction of axonal density within a slice of thick-
ness T as a function of the depth D in the slice as

From this we estimate that the fraction of the remaining L5 pyramidal cell axon density that can
be activated in a slice is between 50% and 70% depending on the depth in the slice (Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 3C). This suggests that between 30% and 50% of L5 inputs are missed due to the
slicing process.
Statistics
Spine and dendrite calcium signal peaks were compared to each other by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Z-
-tests were applied when comparing the median inter-input distance from the experiments to Monte
Carlo simulations. In plots asterisks indicate p-values as *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; and ***, p<0.001.
The values given in the text are mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean), if not indicated
