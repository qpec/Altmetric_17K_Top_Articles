The known Obesity in women is increasing globally, and
during their reproductive years is associated with adverse
maternal and neonatal outcomes.
The new We have documented the rise in prevalence of
overweight and obesity among pregnant nulliparous women in
Australia over a 25-year period. The rise was associated with
increasing rates of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes,
particularly gestational diabetes, fetal macrosomia, and
pre-eclampsia.
The implications The clinical and public health implications of
rising rates of obesity among first-time mothers are
substantial. Efforts should be focused on developing a long
term national approach that ensures the health of future
generations.
A
n analysis of 1698 studies including 19.2 million people
in 200 countries concluded that more people are now
overweight or obese than underweight.1 In countries such
as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, as
many as 50% of women of reproductive age are overweight or
obese.2 Such women have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes (including caesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, and
pre-eclampsia) and of later cardiovascular disease.3,4 Their
offspring have higher rates of neonatal complications and
childhood obesity, and an increased risk of metabolic disease
in adult life.5,6
A useful statistic when exploring the impact of obesity on adverse
perinatal outcomes at the population level is the population
attributable fraction (PAF), the proportional reduction in popula-
tion disease that could be achieved were exposure to a specific
risk factor reduced to a more desirable level. While “relative risk”
expresses the strength of association between an exposure and a
disease, the PAF provides a proportional measure of risk in
a population, accounting for both the prevalence of the risk factor
in the population and the strength of its association with an
outcome.7 PAF is best calculated within a single study to assure
internal consistency of definitions of exposure, outcome, and
population.7 A limited number of international studies have
applied this approach to quantifying the proportion of adverse
perinatal outcomes that could be prevented were maternal
obesity reduced or eliminated,8,9 but none have examined this
question in Australia.
In this study of a large retrospective cohort, we examined the
25-year trend in the proportions of women entering their first
pregnancy who were overweight or obese according to their body
mass index (BMI), and estimated the proportions of adverse peri-
natal outcomes that could be averted by reducing the prevalence of
overweight and obesity in women prior to their first pregnancies.
Methods
The study population was selected from the electronic data records
of all births at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Sydney Local
Health District) between 1990 and 2014. The health district is
characterised by socio-economic diversity; almost half the popu-
lation speak languages other than English at home. About 9% of
births in New South Wales are to women in the Sydney Local
Health District, the majority of which are managed at the Royal
Prince Alfred. During 1989e2004, the routine antenatal and
Abstract
Objective: To examine the prevalence across 25 years of
overweight and obesity among nulliparous Australian women
during early pregnancy; to estimate the proportions of adverse
perinatal outcomes attributable to overweight and obesity in
this population.
Design: Cohort study; retrospective analysis of electronic
maternity data.
Setting, participants: 42 582 nulliparous women with
singleton pregnancies giving birth at the Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital, an urban teaching hospital in Sydney,
January 1990 e December 2014.
Main outcome measures: Maternal body mass index (BMI),
socio-demographic characteristics, and selected maternal, birth
and neonatal outcomes; the proportion of adverse perinatal
outcomes that could be averted by reducing the prevalence of
overweight and obesity in women prior to first pregnancies
(population attributable fraction, PAF).
Results: The prevalence of overweight among nulliparous
pregnant women increased from 12.7% (1990e1994) to
16.4% (2010e2014); the prevalence of obesity rose from
4.8% to 7.3% in the same period, while the proportion with
normal range BMIs fell from 73.5% to 68.2%. The PAFs for key
adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes increased across the
study period; during 2010e2014, 23.8% of pre-eclampsia,
23.4% of fetal macrosomia, and 17.0% of gestational diabetes
were attributable to overweight and obesity. Were overweight
and obese women to have moved down one BMI category
during 2010e2014, 19% of pre-eclampsia, 15.9% of
macrosomia, 14.2% of gestational diabetes, 8.5% of caesarean
deliveries, 7.1% of low for gestational age birthweight,
6.8% of post partum haemorrhage, 6.5% of admissions to
special care nursery, 5.8% of prematurity, and 3.8% of fetal
abnormality could have been averted.
Conclusions: Over the past 25 years, the proportions of
adverse perinatal outcomes attributable to overweight and
obesity have risen with the increasing prevalence of maternal
overweight and obesity. A substantial proportion of these
outcomes might be averted with obesity prevention strategies
that reduce pre-pregnancy maternal weight.

 neonatal data captured throughout pregnancy were entered by
midwives into the Obstetric Information System; from 2005, the
hospital changed to the Cerner Maternity system, which was
updated in 2009. The Obstetric Information System and the
two Cerner systems are electronic medical record platforms,
used by all care providers to record encounters with the
mother and her baby throughout pregnancy and during the
birth and postnatal periods, and include consistent information
despite slightly different interfaces. Our study incorporated
data from all three databases; maternal records were linked to
neonatal records and de-identified, and data from the three
databases merged.
Women who gave birth at the hospital (gestation of at least
20 weeks or birthweight of at least 400 g) between 1 January 1990
and 31 December 2014 were included in our analysis. Pregnant
women planning to give birth at the Royal Prince Alfred make a
booking visit at about 14 weeks’ gestation, at which data on their
general health (including weight, height, and history of diabetes or
hypertension) and obstetric history (parity, caesarean deliveries,
premature births) are recorded. The temporal distribution of
booking visits is not known in detail, but 84% of booking visits in
NSW are made by 20 weeks’ gestation.10 The mother’s record is
updated throughout her pregnancy and until she is discharged
from hospital after the birth.
Gestation was calculated at the booking visit from the most recent
normal menstrual period or from an early dating scan. Women
excluded because of missing data were compared with those
included in the analysis to determine whether the two groups
differed on any parameter.
Maternal variables extracted for our analysis included height
and weight (at the first antenatal consultation), country of
birth, postcode, marital status, smoking status, parity, and
medical and pregnancy history. BMI was calculated and
categorised according to World Health Organization guide-
lines.11 Socio-economic status was determined by residential
postcode, according to the Index of Relative Socio-economic
Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD). As the socio-economic
status of some postcodes changed during the 25-year study
period, we applied the rating at the time of birth. Deciles of
socio-economic status for each postcode were obtained from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census of Population and
Housing: Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) for the
years 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011.12 Countries of birth were
grouped into regions according to the 2011 ABS Standard
Australian
Classification
of
Countries.13
Asian
countries
included north-eastern, southern and central, and south-eastern
Asia; Oceania included Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific
Island nations.
Maternal and birth outcomes included pre-eclampsia and
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM was classified
according to the Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Management
guidelines of the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society.14
The criteria for diagnosing GDM were revised in 2014, but this
is not reflected in our data. Pre-eclampsia was classified
according to the guidelines of the Society of Obstetric Medicine
of Australia and New Zealand.15 Other outcome variables
included mode of birth (vaginal birth or caesarean delivery)
and post partum haemorrhage (greater than 500 mL).
Neonatal outcomes included birth outcome (alive or stillborn),
gestation at birth, neonatal birthweight, neonatal sex, congenital
abnormality recorded, and admission to the special care nursery.
Stillbirth was classified according to the Perinatal Society of
Australia and New Zealand guidelines.16 As reason for admission
to
the
special
care
nursery
was
not
routinely
recorded
throughout the study period, this factor was not analysed.
Premature births are defined by the WHO as any birth before
37 completed weeks of gestation.17 Neonatal birthweight could
be classified as large (LGA; above the 90th percentile) or small
for gestational age and sex (SGA; below the 10th percentile),
based on curves published by Intergrowth,18 or as macrosomia
(birthweight over 4500 g).
The prevalence of outcomes by BMI category and 5-year period
were
examined
with
the
ManteleHaenszel
method.
We
expressed the association between BMI category and outcome
as prevalence ratios, derived from Poisson regression models
with robust standard errors and adjusting for maternal age,
country
of
birth,
socio-economic
disadvantage,
smoking
status, and year of birth. Within these models we tested for
interactions between BMI class and each of the other factors.
A relative risk was deemed statistically significant if the
95% confidence interval did not include 1.0.
The proportions of adverse perinatal outcomes attributable to
either overweight or obesity for each outcome were calculated with
the formula:19
PAF ¼ pd � RR � 1
RR
� 100
where pd is the proportion of patients exposed to the risk factor,
calculated for each 5-year period, and RR is the relative risk
(compared with women in the normal BMI class). To estimate
the burden of disease that could be prevented were all over-
weight and obese women of normal BMI, the combined PAFs
attributable to overweight (PAF1) and obesity (PAF2) were

 estimated for each 5-year period, using adjusted relative risks
(aRRs), with the formula:20
PAF ¼ 1 e ð1 e PAF1Þ � ð1 e PAF2Þ
Adopting a pragmatic approach, we also estimated the potential
benefit of a downwards shift of one BMI category by overweight
and obese women before becoming pregnant (ie, women moved
from an obese category to the overweight category, or from over-
weight to normal).
Ethics approval
Institutional ethics approval for analysing of archived electronic
health data was granted by the Local Health District Ethics Review
Committee (no reference number); identifying information was
removed from all individual records before analysis.
Results
A total of 112 163 singleton births were recorded during
1980e2014, and we calculated the early pregnancy BMI for 42 582
nulliparous women with singleton births (Box 1). The character-
istics of women excluded because of missing data (mostly height or
weight data; online Appendix, tables 1 and 2) were similar to those
of the included women (Box 2) in terms of age, country of birth, and
smoking status. Women with missing data were more likely to
have a higher socio-economic status postcode than those with
complete data.

 During
the
study
period,
the
mean
age
of
first-time
mothers rose from 28.7 (standard deviation [SD], 5.4) to 31.6
years (SD, 4.9 years). The proportion of Asian-born women
increased from 17.0% to 24.3%. The socio-economic status of
postcodes in the hospital catchment area shifted markedly
during the study period; the proportion of mothers in the
highest quintile rose from 7.1% in 1990e1994 to 40.8% in
2010e2014 (Box 2).
The
prevalence
of
overweight
among
nulliparous
women
increased from 12.7% in 1993 to 16.4% in 2010e2014; that of obesity
rose from 4.8% to 7.3% (Box 2, Box 3).
After adjusting for maternal age, smoking status, socio-economic
status of postcode, country of birth, and year of baby’s birth,
and using the healthy BMI group as the reference group,
multivariate
analysis
identified
that
the
relative
risks
of
caesarean delivery, GDM, LGA, macrosomia, pre-eclampsia,
and post partum haemorrhage were higher for women in
overweight
or
obese
BMI
classes;
further,
the
relative
risks increased across the study period. The relative risks
for stillbirth and fetal abnormality were also higher for
women with obesity (all obese BMI classes combined) (Box 4).
For non-smokers (Box 4), but not smokers (online Appendix,
table 3), the risks of prematurity and admission to the
special
care
nursery
increased
with
BMI. There
was an
inverse relationship between BMI and the relative risk of
SGA (Box 4).
During 2010e2014, the burden attributable to overweight
and obesity was greatest for pre-eclampsia (23.8%), macro-
somia (23.4%), and GDM (17.0%). PAFs increased during
the
study
period

In our cohort studyof 42 582 singleton births tonulliparous women
at the Royal Prince Alfred in Sydney, we found that maternal BMI
increased across the study period (1990e2014); we also found an

 adverse outcomes, particularly pre-eclampsia, macrosomia and
GDM. Further, we found that if women could move down one BMI
class prior to pregnancy, substantial adverse outcomes would be
averted.
Pre-eclampsia contributes significantly to perinatal morbidity
and mortality. For almost one in four women with pre-
eclampsia, the condition was attributable to overweight or
obesity, similar to findings in the UK and Canada (reported
PAF, 20%).8,9
Obesity contributes substantially to excessive fetal growth,
thereby increasing perinatal risks of birth trauma, post partum
haemorrhage, and shoulder dystocia,21 as well as having longer
term consequences for the child, including childhood obesity
and increased risk of later cardiovas-
cular risk.5,21 We found that 23.4% of
macrosomia during 2010e2014 was
attributable to maternal overweight
and obesity, substantially higher than
the PAF of 7.4% reported by an earlier
study.8
The
difference
might
be
explained
by
differences
in
study
design; for example, the earlier study
did not correct for smoking status,
included
multiparous
women,
and
applied
a
different
definition
of
macrosomia.
The PAF for GDM attributable to
women being overweight or obese
during 2010e2014 was 17%. We did not
employ the adjusted BMI thresholds
published by the WHO22 that recognise
the
greater
risk
of
obesity-related
complications
in
Asian
women
at
lower BMI thresholds. As our study
population
included
many
Asian
women, our PAF may therefore be an
underestimate. A study in the UK8
found
large
differences
between
ethnic groups in the PAF for obesity
and GDM; the overall figure was
29%, but it was highest for black
(41%) and lowest for Asian women
(8.4%). Differences in the PAF for
GDM between our study and the
UK findings may be related to differ-
ences in demographic characteristics
of the study populations, or to the
British study including multiparous
women.
The strengths of our study include the
sample being derived from a single
source; as the exposure and outcomes
variables were similarly defined over
time,
internal
consistency
was
ensured. Collecting data over many
years and having a large sample size
allowed us to calculate precise pro-
portions for key outcome variables,
adjusted
for
many
relevant
con-
founders. Our PAF formula produced
internally valid estimates by using
adjusted relative risks.19 We analysed
data
only
for
nulliparous
women
because it was important to exclude other contributors to
maternal obesity. In particular, we thereby ensured that our
results were not confounded by gestational weight gain from
previous pregnancies, and that outcomes were not affected by
previous births.
Our findings, however, may only be generalisable to hospitals
providing intensive nursery care or high level obstetric care.
Diagnostic misclassification was possible, but as the rate was
presumably similar for all groups, it is unlikely to have had a
major impact on our results. As many as one in five nulliparous
women in our study did not have a recorded BMI, similar to the
one in seven statistic of similar studies in the UK and Canada.8,9

 fluctuated over the past 25 years because of lags in translating
evidence into practice and fears of stigmatising women.23,24
The 2012 Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Antenatal
Care25 recommend measuring weight and height at the first
antenatal visit, but no Australian platform collates all routinely
collected maternity data.
It is increasingly recognised that by the antenatal period it
may be too late to reduce the risks of maternal obesity.
Two large randomised controlled trials that attempted to
modify adverse outcomes (LGA in the LIMIT trial; GDM and
LGA in the UPBEAT trial) with diet,
lifestyle and behavioural approaches
during
pregnancy
in
women
with
obesity failed to reduce their rates.26,27
Expert
national
and
international
consensus
statements
support
improving pre-conception health and
detailed
prevention
strategies.28-30
They recommend reducing obesity as
a means for improving reproductive
health
outcomes,
potentially
also
reducing societal costs. The National
Health Summit on Obesity called for
federal support for life course strate-
gies that incorporate pre-conception
care.30
Conclusion
We found that a substantial proportion
of the burden of adverse perinatal
outcomes
for
Australian
women
is
linked to maternal overweight and
obesity, and that this proportion has
steadily increased over the past 25
years. Importantly for practice and
policy, our results indicate that the frequency of adverse peri-
natal outcomes could be reduced by shifting the distribution of
overweight and obesity among first-time mothers by a single
BMI class. Investing in obesity prevention strategies that target
women prior to their becoming pregnant is likely to provide the
greatest benefit.
