AbstrACt
Objective to assess if arthroscopic partial 
meniscectomy (ApM) is superior to placebo surgery in 
the treatment of patients with degenerative tear of the 
medial meniscus.
Methods In this multicentre, randomised, participant-
blinded and outcome assessor-blinded, placebo-
surgery controlled trial, 146 adults, aged 35–65 years, 
with knee symptoms consistent with degenerative 
medial meniscus tear and no knee osteoarthritis were 
randomised to ApM or placebo surgery. the primary 
outcome was the between-group difference in the 
change from baseline in the Western ontario Meniscal 
Evaluation tool (WoMEt) and Lysholm knee scores 
and knee pain after exercise at 24 months after 
surgery. Secondary outcomes included the frequency 
of unblinding of the treatment-group allocation, 
participants’ satisfaction, impression of change, return 
to normal activities, the incidence of serious adverse 
events and the presence of meniscal symptoms in 
clinical examination. two subgroup analyses, assessing 
the outcome on those with mechanical symptoms and 
those with unstable meniscus tears, were also carried 
out.
results In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were 
no significant between-group differences in the mean 
changes from baseline to 24 months in WoMEt score: 
27.3 in the ApM group as compared with 31.6 in the 
placebo-surgery group (between-group difference, 
−4.3; 95% CI, −11.3 to 2.6); Lysholm knee score: 23.1 
and 26.3, respectively (−3.2; −8.9 to 2.4) or knee pain 
after exercise, 3.5 and 3.9, respectively (−0.4; −1.3 to 
0.5). there were no statistically significant differences 
between the two groups in any of the secondary 
outcomes or within the analysed subgroups.
Conclusions In this 2-year follow-up of patients 
without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a 
degenerative medial meniscus tear, the outcomes after 
ApM were no better than those after placebo surgery. 
no evidence could be found to support the prevailing 
ideas that patients with presence of mechanical 
symptoms or certain meniscus tear characteristics or 
those who have failed initial conservative treatment 
are more likely to benefit from ApM.
IntrOduCtIOn
Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is one 
of the most common orthopaedic operations,1 with 
an incidence that has increased steadily from 1990s 
until late 2010s.2–5 Most APMs are carried out in 
middle-aged and older patients with knee symptoms 
and degenerative knee disease.1 2 Several recent 
meta-analyses based on randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) have failed to show a treatment-ben-
efit of APM over conservative treatment or placebo 
surgery for these patients.6–10
Aligned with the evidence, most guidelines and 
expert opinion now refrain from recommending 
APM as the first-line treatment for patients with a 
degenerative meniscus tear, but still advocate surgery 
after a failed attempt of conservative treatment.11–16 
Such recommendations rest on three issues: gener-
ally favourable clinical experience, some before-after 
studies on patients undergoing APM due to persisting 
symptoms despite conservative treatment17 18 and 
particularly the evidence from three RCTs19–21 in 
which one-third of participants initially allocated 
to non-surgical treatment opted for crossing over to 
APM due to persisting knee symptoms or insufficient 
improvement. After undergoing APM, participants 
achieved similar outcomes compared with those 
initially assigned to surgery and those responding 
favourably to initial non-surgical/conservative treat-
ment.19–21 These findings have been interpreted as 
evidence that APM should be performed after failed 
conservative treatment.22 Although such hypotheses 
might well be true, an alternative accounting can 
explain the number of crossovers and the beneficial 
treatment effects of surgery after failed conservative 
treatment: lack of blinding (participants’ knowledge 
of not having undergone surgery) may drive conser-
vatively treated patients to request surgery and also 
make them feel more content with the outcome once 
having undergone surgery.23 24
In addition to patients failing to improve after 
conservative treatment, other subgroups consid-
ered to benefit from APM are those with so-called 
‘mechanical symptoms’25–28 or those with ‘unstable’ 
meniscal tear.15 17 28

Clinical and epidemiological research
Accordingly, the aim of this extension of our recently published 
Finnish Degenerative Meniscal Lesion Study (FIDELITY) trial29 
was twofold: (a) to assess if APM is superior over placebo surgery 
over the course of 24-month follow-up determined using patient 
relevant outcomes, the frequency of unblinding of the treat-
ment-group allocation and clinical examination of the knee and 
(b) to assess whether our data corroborates or refutes common 
assertions regarding existence of subgroups of patients likely to 
benefit from APM.
MAterIAls And MethOds
We conducted a multicentre, randomised, participant-blinded 
and outcome assessor-blinded, placebo-surgery controlled effi-
cacy trial involving participants aged 35–65 years with knee 
symptoms over 3 months, consistent with degenerative medial 
meniscus tear and unresponsive to conventional conservative 
treatment and no clinical30 or radiographic (Kellgren-Lawrence 
grade ≤1)31 knee osteoarthritis. The study took place in five 
orthopaedic centres in Finland during the period from December 
2007 through March 2014. All patients had a suspicion of a 
meniscus tear based on symptoms and clinical tests, a tear that 
was later verified on both MRI and knee arthroscopy. Patients 
with an obvious trauma-induced onset of symptoms or with a 
recent history of a locked knee were excluded from the trial. On 
entering the study, participants were informed that they would 
be allowed to consider a reoperation 6 
months or later after the 
procedure if they did not have adequate relief of symptoms.
Participants first underwent diagnostic knee arthroscopy 
and then (during the same operation) were assigned to APM 
or placebo surgery. For the randomisation, the sequentially 
numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were prepared by a stat-
istician. Randomisation was performed in a 1:1 ratio with a 
block size of 4, and with stratification according to study site, 
age (35–50 or 51–65 years), sex and the absence or presence 
of minor degenerative changes on a radiograph (Kellgren-Law-
rence grade 0 or 1, respectively).
The participants, all caregivers and those assessing the 
outcomes were blinded to the treatment assignment. Partici-
pants were followed-up by questionnaires at 2, 6, 12 and 24 
months. At the 24-month follow-up, all participants were also 
clinically examined by an independent orthopaedic surgeon 
unaware of the treatment allocation. Standardised clinical exam-
ination included clinical meniscal tests32: McMurray test,33 pain 
provoked by joint line palpation and pain provoked by forced

flexion and varus. Also, range of knee motion, knee crepitus, 
bony enlargement, effusion, location of pain at palpation and 
knee stability was recorded.
The study was registered at  
ClinicalTrials. 
gov (NCT00549172). 
We have described the design34 and published the 12-month 
results29 of the trial previously. The protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District (R 
06157). The study was conducted in accordance with the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent.
Interventions
Arthroscopic evaluation included recording the presence of 
intra-articular pathology (meniscus tears, loose bodies and 
characterisation of chondral lesions of both tibiofemoral and 
patellofemoral chondral surfaces) according to the International 
Cartilage Repair Society cartilage injury classification scale35 
and the International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and 
Orthopaedic Sports Medicine classification of meniscal tears.36
During the APM, the damaged and loose parts of the meniscus 
were removed with the use of arthroscopic instruments until 
solid meniscal tissue was reached with preservation of as much 
of the meniscus as possible. No other surgical procedure was 
performed. For the placebo surgery, APM was simulated to 
mimic the sensations and sounds of a true APM. The participants 
were also kept in the operating room for the amount of time 
required to perform an actual APM.
In both the APM and the placebo-surgery groups, postoper-
ative care was delivered according to a standardised protocol 
specifying that all participants receive the same walking aids 
and instructions for the same graduated home-based exercise 
programme.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were the change in Western Ontario Meniscal 
Evaluation Tool (WOMET), the Lysholm knee score and pain 
after exercise from baseline to 24 months after surgery. The 
WOMET37 is a meniscus-specific health-related quality-of-life 
instrument, validated especially for patients with a degenerative 
meniscal tear.38 The Lysholm knee score is a validated, condi-
tion-specific outcome measure.39 40 WOMET and Lysholm 
scores each range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the most 
severe symptoms and 100 the absence of symptoms. Knee pain 
(during the preceding week) was assessed on an 11-point numer-
ical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain).
As a secondary outcome, the frequency of patients in the two 
treatment groups who did not have adequate relief of symptoms 
and whose treatment-group allocation was therefore unblinded 
was determined. Participants were also asked to respond to 
the following questions: “Are you satisfied with your knee at 
present?” and “ Is your knee better than before the intervention?” 
on a 5-point Likert scale. As before,41 the responses ‘very satis-
fied’ or ‘satisfied’ were categorised as satisfied, while responses 
‘neither satisfied nor dissatisfied’, ‘dissatisfied’ and ‘very dissatis-
fied’ were categorised as dissatisfied. Similar to satisfaction, the 
responses ‘much better’ and ‘better’ were considered to indicate 
improvement, while responses ‘unchanged’, ‘worse’ or ‘much 
worse’ were deemed not improved. Serious adverse events were 
registered. In addition, the participants were asked whether or 
not they were able to return to their previous activities. Finally, 
the frequency of participants with a positive meniscus test at 
clinical examination was assessed.
APM was also compared with placebo surgery within two 
subgroups of participants, those with mechanical symptoms of 
the knee and those with unstable meniscus tear. The presence 
of mechanical symptoms was assessed using the locking domain 
question of the Lysholm knee score.39 In brief, we asked patients 
to choose one out of five following responses that best reflected 
the status of their knee: i) no locking or catching, ii) catching 
sensations but no locking, iii) occasional locking, iv) frequent 
locking or v) locked at present. Meniscus tears with longitu-
dinal tear pattern, bucket handle tear or flap were determined 
as unstable, whereas radial, horizontal and complex were deter-
mined as stable.13
Patient involvement
There was no active patient involvement in the design of the study, 
in the recruitment to or conduct of the study. However, one of 
the main outcome measures (the WOMET) was initially developed 
with a patient-centred approach: the items included in the final 
version of the questionnaire were those identified by patients to 
impact most significantly on their quality of life.37 The results of 
this RCT will be conveyed to the participants in lay language in a 
pamphlet distributed by mail after the 5-year follow-up.

*The Kellgren-Lawrence scale is a radiographic classification of the severity 
of knee osteoarthritis. Grade 0 denotes no abnormalities and grade 1 denotes 
minor degenerative changes (doubtful narrowing of the joint space or possible 
osteophytic lipping).
†Results of a McMurray test are positive if a ‘click’ over the medial tibiofemoral 
joint line is felt by the examiner during flexion and extension of the knee under 
varus stress.
‡Longitudinal, bucket handle or flap tear at arthroscopy.
§The WOMET contains 16 items addressing three domains: 9 items addressing 
physical symptoms; 4 items addressing disabilities with regard to sports, recreation, 
work and lifestyle and 3 items addressing emotions. The score indicates the 
percentage of a normal score; therefore, 100 is the best possible score and 0 is the 
worst possible score.
¶The Lysholm knee score is based on an eight-item questionnaire designed to 
evaluate knee function and symptoms in activities of daily living. Scores range from 
0 to 100; higher scores indicate less severe symptoms.
**Knee pain after exercise (during the preceding week) was assessed on a rating 
scale of 0–10, with 0 denoting no pain and 10 denoting extreme pain.

Clinical and epidemiological research
statistical methods
The trial was designed to ascertain whether APM is superior to 
placebo surgery in treating patients with knee pain and a degen-
erative meniscus tear. Baseline characteristics were analysed 
with the use of descriptive statistics. For the primary analysis, 
the change in each score (mean with 95% CI) from baseline to 
24 months was compared between the two study groups. This 
analysis was also performed after adjustment for the baseline 
score and for the stratifying variables used for randomisation. 
The study was powered to detect a minimal clinically important 
improvement in the WOMET and Lysholm scores (described 
as improvements of at least 15.5 and 11.5 points, respectively) 
and in the score for knee pain after exercise (improvement of at 
least 2.0 points).34 For the secondary analyses, the frequency of 
assessed outcomes were compared between the two groups. T
wo 
subgroup analyses were carried out, for those with mechanical 
symptoms and for those with unstable meniscus tear; p values 
for interaction were calculated for the subgroup analyses.
A Student’s t-test and non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney 
U test) were used to compare continuous variables (normally 
distributed and not normally distributed, respectively) between 
the groups, and Fisher’s exact test was used with binomial and 
categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed on 
an intention-to-treat basis; as the frequency of crossover was 
low, no per-protocol analysis was performed. A p value of 0.05 
was considered to indicate statistical significance. SPSS Statistics, 
V
.23 (IBM), was used for all statistical analyses.
results
The flow chart of the trial is shown in figure 1. Of the 205 eligible 
patients, 146 underwent randomisation; 70 were assigned to APM 
and 76 to placebo surgery. The baseline characteristics of the two 
groups were similar. On average, half of the participants in both 
groups reported mechanical symptoms preoperatively. There were 
34 participants with a tear morphology defined as ‘unstable’ in the 
APM group and 41 in the placebo-surgery group (table 1). There 
were 24 patients who were eligible but declined to participate in 
the study. They were similar to those who underwent randomisa-
tion with respect to age, sex and body mass index at baseline, and 
all of them underwent arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. At the 
24-month follow-up, two participants were lost to follow-up (one 
not responding to contact attempts and one deceased), both from 
the placebo-surgery group.
Both groups showed a marked improvement in all primary 
outcomes. However, the difference between the two groups did 
not reach statistical significance and 95% CIs excluded clinically 
relevant effect in any of the three primary outcomes over the 
course of the 24-month follow-up (table 2 and figure 2). Five 
participants (7.1%) in the APM group and seven (9.2%) in the 
placebo-surgery group complained of symptoms severe enough 
to result in the unblinding of the treatment-group allocation 
(p=0.767). Most of the participants, in both groups, were satis-
fied and reported improvement with no statistically significant 
difference between the two treatment groups. One participant 
in the APM group had a serious adverse event (a knee infection 
4 months after the initial operation). No between-group differ-
ence was observed in the participants’ frequency in returning to 
normal activity level or in the frequency of mechanical symp-
toms. No statistically significant difference was found between 
the two groups in the meniscal tests during clinical examination 
either (table 3). The outcome of the patients who declined to 
participate (n=17, five lost to follow-up) were similar with those 
randomised, excluding the change in WOMET score (SD), which 
was greater for those declined (43.2±22.4) as compared with 
those randomised (29.5±21.1) with a between-group difference 
−13.7 (95% CI −25.6 to −2.9).
In the two subgroup analyses, one assessing the effect of 
preoperative mechanical symptoms and the other the effect of 
unstable tear on the treatment outcome, there was no difference 
in any of the primary or secondary outcomes between the APM 
and placebo-surgery groups (tables 4 and 5).
dIsCussIOn
In this extension of the FIDELITY trial,29 we found no statisti-
cally significant difference between the APM and placebo surgery 
for symptomatic patients with a degenerative meniscus tear and 
no osteoarthritis (OA) in any of the used outcome measures over 
the course of 24-month follow-up. No evidence could be found to 
support the prevailing ideas that patients with presence of mechan-
ical symptoms or certain meniscus tear characteristics or those who 
failed initial conservative treatment are more likely to benefit from 
APM.

Clinical and epidemiological research
The strengths of the FIDELITY trial have been elaborated 
in detail previously.29 34 In brief, our study was a multicentre, 
randomised, placebo-controlled efficacy trial with a 2-year 
follow-up. Controlling for the possible placebo effects of surgery 
requires that besides participants, all caregivers and outcome 
assessors are blinded to the treatment allocation.42 The use of 
multiple validated outcomes covering many different possible 
symptoms related to degenerative knee and meniscus tear can 
also be considered strength of this trial.
There are also some limitations worth discussing. We excluded 
patients with a truly ‘traumatic’ onset of symptoms, so our 
results are only directly applicable to patients with non-trau-
matic meniscus tears. Obviously, the concepts ‘degenerative’ or 
‘traumatic’ in the context of meniscal injuries are very vague by 
nature. In this trial, all patients with sudden injuries related to 
their own voluntary muscle activities (such as kneeling, bending 
or kicking) and patients with a minor twisting of the knee were 
included. In essence, our criteria for labelling a tear as ‘trau-
matic’ required a more substantial event, such as falling from 
a chair, stairs or bicycle, or slipping on ice. In this context, to 
our knowledge, the only study specifically testing the assump-
tion that meniscal tear outcomes would be any better for those 
with a traumatic onset of symptoms than for those without does 
not support such hypothesis.43 Moreover, a very recent study 
showed that patients with traumatic meniscal tears do not expe-
rience greater improvements in patient-reported outcomes after 
APM than patients with degenerative tears.44
The generalisability of the FIDELITY trial has been ques-
tioned.25 45 46 Although the design of the FIDELITY has been 
elaborated in detail previously,34 it is worth reasserting that it was

Clinical and epidemiological research
designed as an efficacy trial to test the therapeutic potential of APM. 
Accordingly, we recruited a sample that potentially would have an 
‘optimal response’ to APM (medial meniscus tear, no OA). Such 
patients are rare to find among ordinary patients with a degener-
ative meniscus tear. This explains the lengthy recruitment period 
(4 
years) despite five high-volume centres, but given our finding of 
lack of efficacy, this methodological choice actually increases —
rather than diminishes—the generalisability of our study.
Some have criticised the FIDELITY trial for recruiting patients 
with symptoms that were not attributable to a meniscal tear,25 yet 
our subjects’ eligibility was confirmed by both MRI and arthros-
copy. APM is typically advocated for patients with knee symptoms 
in whom a tear is confirmed by MRI, particularly those without 
concomitant knee osteoarthritis.47 Increasing evidence, however, 
suggests that a degenerative meniscal tear may be an early sign 
of knee osteoarthritis rather than a separate clinical problem that 
causes symptoms.48–50 Moreover, specific meniscal pathology and 
other structural joint pathologies found at meniscal surgery were 
not associated with preoperative self-reported pain and function 
in patients with meniscal tears.51 We interpret our findings as 
supportive of the idea that degenerative meniscus tear does not 
cause specific symptoms even in knees without osteoarthritis.52
We are also aware of the limitations related to post hoc subgroup 
analyses53: the number of participants in our subgroups was small, 
the analyses were not planned a priori and there was no formal 
power calculation. However, as patients with mechanical symp-
toms and with unstable tear have been—and still are—widely 
suggested as the ideal subgroup to benefit from APM25 27 54–56 and 
the hypothesis is backed by a credible biological rationale, we felt 
that our analyses were of high clinical relevance.53
We set out to address a few apparent gaps in the existing evidence 
base regarding arthroscopic surgery for patients with knee pain and 
degenerative meniscus tear/knee disease. First, although a 24-month 
follow-up is a commonly held ‘minimal requirement’ for any proce-
dure in orthopaedics, only three19 57 58 of the eight previous RCT
s 
on this topic have followed-up patients longer than 12 months. Our 
24-month data show that most of the improvement observed with 
both APM and placebo surgery was evident already at 6 
months 
after surgery and the extended follow-up did not have an effect 
on our primary finding.29 Second, many authors and organisations

Clinical and epidemiological research
advocate APM for patients ‘unresponsive to conservative treat-
ment’,12–16 a strategy based on the previous unblinded trials.19–21 
These trials showed that about 30% of participants initially allo-
cated to conservative treatment have opted to crossover to surgery 
due to persisting symptoms. Although such behaviour is intuitively 
rational, it should be recalled that when patients are told of the 
possibility of surgical treatment but are allocated to conservative 
care, this so-called ‘failed opportunity’ may drive patients to seek 
surgery if symptoms persist.42 In our blinded trial, the frequency 
of unblinding of the treatment-group allocation due to persisting 
symptoms was clearly lower than in the previous—unblinded—
studies and we found no difference between our two treatment 
groups. Our data thus highlight the vital importance of proper 
blinding of study participants in surgical RCT
s. Considering the 
rationale to carry out APM on those having failed previous conser-
vative treatment further, a recent study comparing exercise therapy 
to APM alone (with no postoperative rehabilitation) showed that 
although 19% of participants allocated to exercise therapy crossed 
over to surgery during the 2-year follow-up, APM did not result in 
any additional benefit for them.58
Another widely held assertion is that the presence of mechan-
ical symptoms (sensation of knee catching or locking) represents a 
valid indication for arthroscopic surgery.25–27 59 This is premised on 
a rationale that mechanical symptoms are caused by a joint struc-
ture lodging between the gliding articular surfaces. Our recently 
published secondary analysis (1-year follow-up of this trial) showed 
that resection of a torn meniscus has no added benefit over placebo 
surgery in relieving knee catching or occasional locking.60 The 
findings of this 2-year extension corroborate our previous find-
ings. The absence of an effect of APM on patients with mechan-
ical symptoms is also supported by previous subgroup analyses of 
controlled trials21 61 and our own recent prospective cohort study 
of 900 consecutive patients undergoing APM.62 With respect to the 
present data, patients with a true locked knee (unable to extend 
their knee fully) were excluded from the FIDELITY and thus some 
caution may be warranted in the interpretation of our current 
findings. Finally, meniscus tear morphology is often asserted to 
explain the success of APM,17 28 63 64 but our data fail to support 
such notion.
In conclusion, the results of this randomised, placebo-controlled 
trial with 24 months follow-up show that APM provides no signif-
icant benefit over placebo surgery in patients with a degenerative 
meniscal tear and no knee osteoarthritis. These results support the 
evolving consensus that degenerative meniscus tear represents an 
(early) sign of knee osteoarthritis, rather than a clinical entity on 
its own, and accordingly, caution should be exercised in referring 
patients with knee pain and suspicion of a degenerative meniscal 
tear to MRI examination or APM, even after a failed attempt of 
conservative treatment.
unanswered questions and future research
Arthroscopic surgery for knee pain in middle-aged and older 
patients is one of the most rigorously studied orthopaedic proce-
dures. The evidence base shows very consistently that APM offers 
no benefit over conservative treatment or placebo surgery.65 Still, 
hundreds of thousands of procedures are performed worldwide 
each year. Given the mounting evidence, anyone still advocating 
APMs should promptly launch methodologically rigorous, prac-
tical, real-world trial(s) embedded in the flow of practice to prove 
that APM truly works in the asserted subgroups of patients.
