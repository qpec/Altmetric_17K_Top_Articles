Abstract
The ability of HIV to establish a long-lived latent infection within resting CD4+ T cells leads
to persistence and episodic resupply of the virus in patients treated with antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART), thereby preventing eradication of the disease. Protein kinase C (PKC) modula-
tors such as bryostatin 1 can activate these latently infected cells, potentially leading to their
elimination by virus-mediated cytopathic effects, the host’s immune response and/or thera-
peutic strategies targeting cells actively expressing virus. While research in this area has
focused heavily on naturally-occurring PKC modulators, their study has been hampered by
their limited and variable availability, and equally significantly by sub-optimal activity and in
vivo tolerability. Here we show that a designed, synthetically-accessible analog of bryostatin
1 is better-tolerated in vivo when compared with the naturally-occurring product and potently
induces HIV expression from latency in humanized BLT mice, a proven and important
model for studying HIV persistence and pathogenesis in vivo. Importantly, this induction of
virus expression causes some of the newly HIV-expressing cells to die. Thus, designed,
synthetically-accessible, tunable, and efficacious bryostatin analogs can mediate both a
“kick” and “kill” response in latently-infected cells and exhibit improved tolerability, therefore
showing unique promise as clinical adjuvants for HIV eradication.
Author summary
HIV can persist for many years in a latent (non-expressing) state in individuals treated
with antiretroviral therapy, and these latently-infected cells represent a major barrier to
curing HIV infection. One potential approach to eliminating the reservoir cells is to
induce them to express viral proteins while maintaining antiretroviral therapy, allowing

 these cells to be killed by the virus or the immune response. However, this approach has
been hampered by a lack of compounds that can safely and effectively reverse HIV from
latency in a living organism. Here we show that a designed, synthetic protein kinase C
modulating compound is better-tolerated than the naturally-occurring product (bryosta-
tin 1) in mice and potently induces HIV expression from latency in a mouse model con-
taining a human immune system. Importantly, this induction of virus expression causes
some of the newly HIV-expressing cells to die. Hence, this compound shows unique
promise as a component of the so-called “kick and kill” approach for HIV eradication.
Introduction
HIV/AIDS is a catastrophic pandemic that has claimed an estimated 35 million lives. Approxi-
mately 37 million individuals are currently HIV-positive. In 2015, 2.1 million individuals were
newly infected, and 1.1 million died of AIDS-related illnesses [1]. Antiretroviral therapy
(ART), the current recommended treatment for HIV infection, suppresses viral replication
and prevents disease progression, allowing infected individuals to live with the disease [2].
However, ART does not cure the infection, in part because replication-competent HIV can
persist within latently-infected CD4+ T cells throughout many years of continuous therapy
[3,4,5]. These reservoir cells contain integrated HIV proviral genomes and can episodically re-
supply active virus. Treatment thus requires the life-long use of ART, which is associated with
numerous problems including health issues related to chronic chemoexposure, high financial
cost and the need for strict compliance [6]. The development of strategies to reduce or elimi-
nate the reservoir of latently-infected cells is therefore a research and clinical priority of global
significance.
Several strategies for eliminating latent HIV have been proposed (reviewed in [7]). One
promising approach is often referred to as “activation-elimination” or “kick and kill”. This is
based on the observation that latently-infected cells do not typically express viral proteins and
are therefore not killed directly by virus production (viral cytopathic effects) or through
immune effector mechanisms such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or natural killer cells,
which require viral protein expression to recognize infected cells. However, if HIV expression
can be induced in latently-infected cells (kick) then these cells could become susceptible to
cytopathic effects or virus- or immune-mediated cell killing mechanisms (kill). It is currently
unknown whether inducing expression of latent HIV in vivo alone is sufficient to deplete some
or all latently-infected cells, or whether the “kill” arm of the approach will require augmenting,
for example, with broadly-neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies [8,9], anti-HIV immunotoxins
[10], pre-stimulated or genetically engineered CTLs [11,12], or other mechanisms. The capac-
ity of a particular stimulatory signal to result in the death of latently-infected cells is likely
connected to its relative ability to induce HIV protein expression, with weak HIV latency
reversing agents (LRAs) inducing little or no protein expression, and strong LRAs potentially
inducing expression of sufficient HIV protein to trigger viral cytopathicity and/or immune
surveillance in the host. However, this approach is further complicated because HIV expres-
sion is tightly connected to the activation state of the host CD4+ T cell, meaning that very
strong LRAs might also induce CD4+ T cell activation, proliferation, and/or generalized
immune stimulation accompanied by hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm) such as can occur
following in vivo administration of the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3 along with interleukin (IL)-2
[13]. Therefore, an ideal LRA would strongly induce HIV expression and cause the death of
latently-infected cells without over-activating immune cells.

 Numerous studies on agents that induce latency reversal through several different cellular
pathways have been reported [2,14,15,16]. Of these, protein kinase C (PKC) modulators are an
especially promising LRA class of preclinical leads, serving either as single agents or in combi-
nation with additional LRAs [2,14,17,18]. The vast majority of prior in vitro HIV studies with
PKC modulators has focused on one of the first reported LRAs, naturally-occurring prostratin,
with a more recent interest being directed also at ingenol esters and bryostatin 1 [19,20].
The bryostatins are a collection of at least 21 structurally related macrolactone natural prod-
ucts originally isolated from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina [21]. Bryostatin 1 (Fig 1A),
the most studied of the naturally occurring bryostatins [22], modulates PKC activity at low
nanomolar concentrations and is implicated in a broad range of biological activities. Its use in
cancer therapy has been explored in over 40 phase I and phase II clinical trials. It has also been
studied in a phase IIb trial [23] for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer’s disease [24,25]. Addition-
ally, bryostatin 1 potently induces HIV from latency in various in vitro models [17,26], and is
therefore a lead clinical candidate in HIV eradication efforts. This positive in vitro activity
prompted a recent phase I clinical study in ART-treated patients, which showed that bryostatin
1 was safe at low doses, but higher doses would be required to effect PKC-mediated latency
reversal [27]. The potential of lowering the dose of bryostatin 1 and thus increasing its tolera-
bility with combination LRAs was not explored.

 Notwithstanding its clinical potential, the supply of bryostatin 1 is uncertain as it is produced
in only low and variable amounts by its marine source organism. Sustainable harvesting of that
source raises cost and environmental concerns. Most importantly, the natural bryostatins, serv-
ing putatively in part as antifeedants in their marine ecosystem, are neither evolved, optimized
nor readily tuned for therapeutic applications such as HIV latency reversal. Indeed, natural
products themselves represent only a small percentage (6%) of new chemical entities introduced
as drugs with the vast majority being derivatives or agents inspired by natural products [28].
To address in part the limited availability of natural products, the difficulty often encoun-
tered in their chemical derivatization due to their structural complexity and scarcity, and their
generally unoptimized clinical potential, we have focused on a function oriented synthesis
(FOS) strategy directed at creating therapeutic function through synthesis-informed design
[29]. In brief, rather than focusing on structure alone, which is an all-or-nothing approach,
FOS focuses on function which could be achieved with a wide range of structures through
innovative design. Toward this end, based on a computer analysis of PKC modulators, we pre-
viously proposed [30] that only a subset of features in the complex bryostatin 1 structure
might be responsible for its biological activity, and used [26] this pharmacophore model to
design the first simplified and more synthetically accessible bryostatin analogs (“bryologs”).
Here, we report on the ability of novel bryologs to function like bryostatin 1 in activating viral
gene expression from the actual latent HIV reservoir and to quantify in vivo activity and tolera-
bility of one particularly promising analog (SUW133) as required for its preclinical advance-
ment. In a clear demonstration of the potential value of the FOS approach, we show that this
bryolog is somewhat better tolerated in vivo than bryostatin 1, that it is more effective in acti-
vating expression of latent HIV in human cells, and, significantly, that this expression (“kick”)
causes a subset of these infected host cells to die without requiring an additional "kill"
approach.
Results
The structures of bryostatin 1 and bryolog SUW133 along with PKC isoform affinities are
shown (Fig 1). In a preliminary screen for LRA activity, we previously demonstrated that
SUW133 and several other bryologs effectively induced HIV from latency in the J-Lat 10.6 cell
line [26]. Since HIV latency reversal varies depending on the model system used, and evaluat-
ing potential LRAs using primary latently-infected cells from ART-treated patients is an
important step in their characterization, we have now tested SUW133 for its capacity to induce
virus expression from resting CD4+ T cells obtained from six HIV-infected patients with viral
loads suppressed by effective ART (Subjects 1–6, S1 Table). SUW133 induced significant levels
of latent virus from these true reservoir cells (Fig 2A) as well as in an alternative cell line model
for HIV latency (U1 cells: S1 Fig). To directly compare SUW133 treatment with other com-
monly tested HIV LRAs and maximal T cell stimulation, CD4+ T cells were isolated from a
further 3 ART-treated patients with undetectable plasma viral loads (Subjects 7–9, S1 Table).
These cells were exposed to clinically relevant concentrations [31] of the histone deacetylase
inhibitors panobinostat or vorinostat, the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, the PKC modula-
tor bryostatin 1, or anti-CD3+anti-CD28 antibody costimulation (Fig 2B). SUW133 signifi-
cantly outperformed panobinostat, vorinostat, JQ1, and bryostatin 1 treatment in this assay,
and induced approximately 1/3 the amount of cell-free virion-associated HIV RNA as maxi-
mal T cell stimulation (costimulation). These data indicate that SUW133 is capable of inducing
HIV from latency in primary patient-derived latently-infected cells.
Prostratin and bryostatin 1 can each induce expression of the early T cell activation marker
CD69. We found that SUW133 also upregulates expression of this cell surface marker on

 primary CD4+ T cells (Fig 3A), and that for a variety of synthetic prostratin and bryostatin
analogs [18,26] this effect occurs at similar concentrations to those required to activate HIV

an additional 3 ART-treated, aviremic patients were subjected to stimulation for 48h with the indicated compounds.
Using a rank sum test (for independence), SUW133 induced significantly higher (p = 0.03) amounts of virus production
versus all other stimuli except maximal T cell stimulation (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 costimulation).

regression coefficient is zero). The p-value being below 0.05 suggests that CD69 activation is significantly related to latency activation.

 from latency (Fig 3B). This indicates that CD69 serves as an in vivo biomarker to assess when
biologically active concentrations of a compound have been delivered and thus can be used to
evaluate the compound’s relative potency.
To determine whether the PKC modulator SUW133 has improved properties over bryosta-
tin 1 in vivo, ascending concentrations of bryostatin 1 or SUW133 were administered by intra-
peritoneal injection into C57/bl6 mice and the relative in vivo bioactivity and acute toxicity of
the compounds were evaluated. Both bryostatin 1 and SUW133 induced high levels of CD69
in murine splenocytes at 24h post-injection. However, SUW133 exhibited superior activity,
with over 80% of CD4+ splenocytes expressing CD69 versus a maximum of approximately
60% in bryostatin 1 treated animals (Fig 4A and 4B). Importantly, while bryostatin 1 had a
very narrow toxicity free activation window between 2.5 μg and 5 μg per animal, SUW133
induced CD69 expression at doses as low as 1 μg and in some cases was tolerated at doses of
up to 30 μg per animal. Thus SUW133 exhibits a moderately greater “therapeutic window”
than the natural product and better induction, showing that toxicity and activation can be
decoupled by structural variations.
HIV latency purging strategies would ideally involve a transient “pulse” of stimulation that
would be sufficient to induce activation and elimination of a portion of latent virus reservoir cells
without causing persistent immune activation. Repetition of this treatment could eventually elimi-
nate the latent reservoir. A single injection of 10 μg of SUW133 indeed resulted in transient
expression of CD69 on the vast majority of murine splenocytes (Fig 4C) which declined by day 9
post-injection. CD25 (a late T cell activation marker and component of the IL-2 receptor) expres-
sion on CD3+ T cells in the spleens of these animals remained unchanged (S2 Fig). Moreover, no
detectable increase in plasma concentrations of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, and MIP-1-alpha,
and only a short-term elevation in IL-6 levels was observed following administration (S3 Fig).
We next explored the activity of SUW133 in humanized mice, a proven, important and rel-
evant model for studying HIV in vivo. The BLT mouse model [32] supports multi-lineage
human immune reconstitution in many tissues within the mouse and represents one of the
most advanced small animal models available for investigating HIV persistence and pathogene-
sis [33]. We and others have shown that BLT mice can be infected with HIV and form authentic
post-integration latency in resting human CD4+ T cells [34,35]. We therefore elected to use this
model to determine whether SUW133 could induce latent HIV expression in vivo. We initially
verified the bioactivity of SUW133 in human cells in uninfected BLT mice by quantifying acti-
vation of CD69 expression in the spleen and blood one day after stimulation (Fig 5). This
resulted in robust activation of CD69 with limited CD25 expression in both CD4+ T cells and
other T cell subsets. Given the strong correlation between HIV latency reversal and CD69 upre-
gulation we had previously identified (Fig 3), these data suggested that SUW133 would also be
capable of inducing expression of latent HIV in vivo.
To test this hypothesis, we then infected BLT mice with NL-HA, a replication-competent,
pathogenic HIV reporter strain that encodes a short epitope from influenza hemagglutinin
(HA) in place of vpr [36]. If cells are productively infected with this virus and are expressing
viral proteins, the HA reporter protein is expressed on the cell surface. Consequently, induc-
tion of virus expression from latently-infected cells can be detected by flow cytometry. We
have previously found that similar reporter viruses effectively establish latency in vivo in
humanized mice [10,34,37]. Here, BLT mice were infected for 3–4 weeks then treated with
ART (consisting of daily injections of emtricitibine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF), and raltegravir for 2–5 weeks) and suppression of viral loads was monitored by
RT-PCR. Mice were then bled to provide a baseline percentage of HA+ human cells in the
blood, and subsequently treated with SUW133 by IP injection while maintaining ART (Fig
6A). After an overnight incubation, mice were sacrificed and the percentage of HA+ (HIV-

 expressing) cells was quantified in the peripheral blood (Fig 6B–6D, and S4 Fig) and spleen
(Fig 6E). For spleen, control mice that had been infected and treated with ART but not stimu-
lated with SUW133 were included as unstimulated comparators. In these assays, SUW133
induced significant numbers of latently-infected cells to express viral proteins, as measured by
increases in the percentage of HA+ cells after in vivo stimulation (Fig 6E).
An important and as yet unanswered question is whether LRA-induced activation of HIV
from latency alone is sufficient to cause death of the host cell, either through viral cytopathic
effects or host anti-viral immune responses (anti-HIV immune responses are detectable in
BLT mice, [38] although at minimal levels). We therefore included two vital dyes in some of
the analysis of infected cells that had been stimulated from latency in vivo. Ghost Red and
Zombie Yellow dyes are excluded from cells with intact membranes and are enriched in dead

express HIV in vivo by SUW133 administration also stained with these cell death dyes, com-
pared with a very low background staining in HA-negative cells from the same animals (Figs 7
and S5), demonstrating that a portion of the cells induced to express HIV proteins in vivo, in
the absence of an additional “kill” approach, subsequently died.
Discussion
“Kick and kill” approaches represent promising strategies for eliminating latent HIV and thus
contributing to the cure of HIV-infected individuals. Yet, these approaches are limited by a

 relative lack of safe and effective LRAs that can strongly induce HIV expression in vivo [39].
Protein kinase C modulating agents such as bryostatin 1 are among the most effective LRAs to
be tested [14]. However, preclinical development of this compound has been hampered by its
lack of availability due to its scarce and variable production by its source organism and the
attendant logistical, financial, and environmental issues associated with massive harvesting of
that source organism from fragile marine reserves. Moreover, due to its complexity and insuf-
ficient availability, little has been done to modify the natural product to improve its therapeutic
efficacy (with respect to HIV latency reversal) and tolerability (dose-limiting toxicity, myalgia).
Indeed, little is known even about whether efficacy and tolerability could be decoupled by such
changes in the structure.
Here, we demonstrate that a designed, synthetically accessible PKC activator inspired by
bryostatin 1 exhibits a pan-PKC binding selectivity similar to bryostatin 1, better tolerability
in vivo than the natural product and a more potent capacity to activate HIV from latent reser-
voirs ex vivo and in vivo. Significantly, this activation leads to death of some latently-infected
cells, thus providing for both “kick” and “kill” activities. It is likely that the observed death of
previously latently-infected cells would increase if tested over longer periods of time or with
repeated dosing, and could also be further improved by inclusion of therapeutic agents that
are specifically intended to kill cells actively expressing HIV, potentially including cell-based
therapeutics such as HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes [11], natural killer cells, or Env-spe-
cific antibody based approaches including broadly neutralizing antibodies [8] or immunotox-
ins [10]. Similarly, the use of LRAs that would synergize with such PKC modulators would be
expected to further improve tolerability by dose reduction [31]. Enhancements in delivery

 such as incorporation of bryologs into CD4-targeted nanoparticles as we have previously
described for bryostatin 1 could also represent a more specific and efficient means to reactivate
latent virus in CD4+ cells while reducing unwanted side-effects that are mediated through cell
types that are not typically HIV-infected [40,41].
Several factors might contribute to the variable level of death observed in those cells ac-
tively-expressing HIV (Figs 7 and S5). Data on cell killing were obtained at a single timepoint
around 24 hours post-activation. These data thus represent only a snapshot of an ongoing pro-
cess. It is therefore very likely that additional cells could die at later timepoints. Furthermore,
since humanization levels and anti-HIV immune responses are not identical in all animals,
variations in the anti-HIV innate and adaptive immune responses in different humanized
mice could lead to corresponding variations in the killing of cells that have been recently reac-
tivated from latency. The amount of HIV protein produced in the newly reactivated cells may
also in some cases be below the threshold required to trigger viral cytopathic effects that con-
tribute to host cell death. This concept of multifactorial intracellular and extracellular signals
contributing to the death of HIV-infected cells during post-integration expression is consistent
with the observation that apoptosis in cells harboring pre-integrated virus can be influenced
by a variety of different factors including microenvironmental stimuli such as cytokines [42].
Future extensions of the current study would include experiments designed to determine
whether this single-dose of LRA is capable of inducing a long-term reduction in the frequency
of latently-infected cells in the animals. We also did not directly measure the fraction of HIV
proviruses from which SUW133 could reactivate HIV expression, or whether SUW133 is capa-
ble of inducing any of the apparently intact proviruses that have proven refractory to reactiva-
tion through other means [43]. Future studies could also entail determining the effects of
multiple sequential activating events on the latent reservoir. The long-term consequences of
inducing even modest levels of T cell activation (as exemplified here by CD69 upregulation
without abundant CD25 expression) in essentially all T cells in vivo using PKC modulating
LRAs are also unknown, and should be considered along with results from acute toxicity
experiments in further preclinical studies.
Nevertheless, given the vast body of research directed at naturally occurring LRAs, this
proof of principle study, based on one of the most advanced small animal models available for
investigating HIV persistence and pathogenesis, establishes that robust induction of HIV
expression can be achieved with a designed agent and, significantly, that this agent causes
death of some HIV reservoir cells. This study demonstrates how a natural lead can be used as
an effective template for the design of a more accessible, efficacious, better tolerated and tun-
able analog representing now one of the most promising adjuvants for use with ART in strate-
gies to eradicate HIV.
Materials and methods
Uninfected human cell isolation and stimulation procedures
Primary human cells from HIV seronegative individuals were cultured in “RF10 medium”
consisting of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Omega
Scientific), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen). PBMCs were
isolated using Ficoll-Paque Plus separation (GE Healthcare). Primary CD4+ T cells were sepa-
rated from PBMCs by negative immunomagnetic selection using the CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then exposed to
compound for 24 hours before staining and flow cytometric analysis of CD69 levels. Com-
pound incubations were performed by seeding 105 cells/well in 100 μL of RF10 media con-
taining the appropriate concentration of compound in wells of a v-bottomed 96-well plate.

 Bryostatin 1 (Tocris bioscience) and Prostratin (LC Laboratories) were obtained commercially,
and bryologs or prostratin analogs were synthesized as previously described [18,26].
In vivo C57/bl6 mouse experiments
C57/bl6 mice were obtained from the UCLA Department of Radiation Oncology. Com-
pounds were suspended in DMSO and then further diluted in RF10 media to produce a final
volume of 500 μL (containing a maximum 4% DMSO). These 500 μL volumes were adminis-
tered to mice by intraperitoneal injection. Mice were monitored for acute toxicities and then
sacrificed at the indicated times. Spleens were removed and disaggregated using a steel mesh,
and then filtered through a 40 μm filter to produce a single-cell suspension. The resultant
splenocytes were then stained for flow cytometry to analyze surface expression of relevant
markers.
In vivo humanized BLT mouse experiments
Humanized bone marrow liver thymus (BLT) mice [32] were constructed by the UCLA
humanized mouse core using techniques described previously [34,44,45]. In brief, NOD.Cg-
Prkdcscid IL2rgtm1Wjl (Nod-SCID-common gamma chain knockout [NSG]) mice were first
irradiated with 270 rads and then transplanted under the kidney capsule with pieces of fetal
thymus and liver tissue. Mice were then infused intravenously by retro-orbital injection with
5x105 human fetal liver-derived CD34+ cells isolated by immunomagnetic separation as previ-
ously described [46]. At 8 weeks post-transplantation and approximately every 2 weeks there-
after mice were evaluated for reconstitution with human cells. Mice were bled as previously
described [34] and peripheral blood mononuclear cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Once
reconstituted, mice were infected by retro-orbital injection with HIV strain NL-HA (200ng
p24 per mouse), which is a near full-length, pathogenic strain of HIV that encodes a short HA
epitope from influenza hemagglutinin in place of vpr that is expressed on the surface of pro-
ductively infected cells [36]. Mice were bled periodically and plasma viral loads monitored by
RT-PCR conducted by the UCLA CFAR virology core. Mice were treated with antiretroviral
therapy consisting of emtricitibine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and raltegra-
vir, essentially as described previously [47], which were administered through daily subcutane-
ous injection. For mice that were treated with a PKC modulator, the mice were first bled (for
pre-stimulation analysis of plasma viral load and HIV expression) and then the PKC modula-
tor was administered by intraperitoneal injection. Because BLT mice are usually less robust
than wild-type mice (due to surgery, humanization, and multiple bleeds etc.), the lowest levels
of SUW133 in the HIV-infected BLT mice that induced significant activation of biomarker
expression in wild-type mice were tested first. The following day (17–24 h after PKC modula-
tor administration) the mice were sacrificed and then PBMC and splenocytes were analyzed
by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry
During standard flow cytometry staining, samples of 105 cells were suspended in 50 μL of a 1:1
dilution of phosphate buffered saline (PBS):Human AB serum (Sigma). Staining of C57/bl6
mouse splenocytes was performed by adding the following anti-mouse fluorescent conjugated
antibodies: CD3-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, eBioscience 11-0032-82); CD69-Phycoery-
thrin (PE, eBioscience 12-0691-83); and CD4-Allophycocyanin (APC, eBioscience 17-0041-
83). In some experiments CD4-APC was replaced with CD25-APC (eBioscience 17-0251-82)
and CD4-Phycoerythrin Cyanin 7 (PC7, eBioscience 25-0041-82). For humanized mouse stud-
ies, PBMC and splenocytes from BLT mice were stained with anti-mouse CD45-Alexa 700

 (Biolegend 103128) and the following anti-human antibodies: CD45-e450 (eBioscience 48-
0459-42); CD3-APC-780 (eBioscience; 47-0038-42); CD4-V500 (BD biosciences; 560768);
CD8-Peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-710 (eBioscience 46-0087-42); CD25-PE (Beck-
man IM0479U); CD69-APC (Biolegend 310910); CD14-PE-Cy7 (Biolegend 325618). Cells
were separately stained for anti-human CD45 e450- (eBioscience 48-0459-42) and anti-HA-
Biotin PE (Roche 12158167001) followed by a secondary Streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin Con-
jugate (Invitrogen s866) stain. This two-step stain was performed by incubating 1-2x106 cells
at 4˚C for 20–30 min, washing with 2% FBS in PBS, then adding the secondary stain, incubat-
ing again at 4˚C for 20–30 min, and washing with 2% FBS in PBS before fixation with 2% para-
formaldehyde. In some experiments, cell death was also evaluated by GHOST Red 780 (Tonbo
Biosciences 13–0865) or Zombie Yellow (Biolegend 423104) stains. For this procedure, 106
cells were suspended in 100 μL PBS, and then the Zombie yellow and GHOST Red 780 dyes
added. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark and then washed
twice with 2% FBS in PBS. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated for
20 min in the dark. In some experiments cells were then washed with 2% FBS in PBS, resus-
pended in 1:1 PBS:Human AB serum and then stained for human CD45 and HA, CD3-PE-
Cy5 (Biolegend 300310), CD4-ECD (Beckman 6604727), CD8 Per-CO710 (eBioscience 46-
0087-42) and CD3-APC (Cell signaling 9602S) as described above.
For human PBMC CD69 induction experiments, cells were stained with CD69-ECD (Beck-
man Coulter 6607110). During staining, cells were incubated at 4o C for 20 minutes, washed
with 2% FBS in PBS, and then resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. Stained samples were
stored at 4o C.
Flow cytometry samples were analyzed using a Cytomics FC 500 (Beckman Coulter) or a
LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (v7) software.
Cytokine quantifications
Quantification of the levels of the murine cytokines IL-2, IL-6, MIP-1-alpha, and TNF-alpha
in mouse plasma samples was performed using a custom Milliplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemo-
kine Magnetic Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Wash steps
were performed using a Bio-Plex II Wash Station (Bio-Rad), and the data were acquired using
a Bio-Plex 200 System with high-throughput fluidics (Bio-Rad). The resultant data were ana-
lyzed using Bio-Plex Manager 6.1 software.
Statistics
Tests of independent groups were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. For hypothe-
ses where we, a priori, expected an increase due to stimulation, we used a 1-sided test. All
other tests were two-sided. For mouse and in vitro studies, preliminary results suggested that
in most cases a sample size of 3 in each group would be sufficient to observe a significant effect
using a 1-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Where resources allowed, we added additional mice/
replicates to allow for variance in the estimates. BLT mice with fully-suppressed viral loads
were included in the analysis. No specific randomization or blinding was performed. For cyto-
kine analysis, where cytokine concentration values were below the limit of detection, a value
that was midway between 0 and the limit of detection was used. Paired data was analyzed
using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for paired data. If, a priori, we expected a decrease, we
used a 1-sided test, otherwise we used a two-sided test. The figure legends state specifically if a
test is 1 or 2 sided. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between CD69 expres-
sion and latency activation. Residual plots and the R2 value suggest a good fit to the model.

 U1 cell stimulations
U1 cells [48] (tested negative for bacteria, mold, yeast, and mycoplasma) were obtained
through the AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. Thomas Folks.
Cells and compound were seeded in a final 200 μL volume of RF10 media at a cell density of
20,000 cells/well in v-bottomed 96 well plates and incubated at 37˚C for 48 hours. After incu-
bation, cells were pelleted and supernatant harvested then diluted in a 2% Triton-x-100/phos-
phate buffered saline solution. The concentration of HIV p24 protein in the culture
supernatant was quantified using the HIV p24 antigen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
J-Lat cell stimulations
J-Lat cells (clone 10.6) [49] (tested negative for bacteria, mycoplasma, and fungi) were
obtained through the AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. Eric
Verdin. Cells were incubated in 100 μL volume of RF10 medium containing the indicated con-
centrations of compound for 48h before analysis. Stimulations were performed in v-bottomed
96-well tissue culture plates with a starting cell density of 25000 cells/well. During harvesting,
cells were washed and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. The percentage of cells express-
ing GFP was then quantified by flow cytometry using a FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter) and FlowJo software (version 7.6).
Clinical specimens
Nine HIV-infected individuals receiving ART for a median of 2.6 years (range 0.4–9.1) were
studied. All study subjects maintained undetectable levels of plasma viremia (<50 copies/mL)
at the time of study (S1 Table).
Preparation and incubation of resting CD4+ T cells with study
compounds
CD4+ T cells were isolated from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
using a cell enrichment kit (StemCell Technologies). For patient samples 1–6, resting CD4+ T
cells were further isolated by depleting CD25+, HLA-DR+ and CD69+ CD4+ cells using PE-
conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences) and anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD4+ T
cells were incubated with RPMI 1640-based medium containing antiretroviral drugs consist-
ing of T-20 (100 μg/mL), tenofovir (1 μM), and emtricitabine (1 μM), and test stimuli at con-
centrations indicated in the figures.
Quantitation of HIV RNA in ex vivo patient samples
The copy number of virion-associated HIV RNA in the cell culture supernatants was measured
using the Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas Taqman HIV-1 Test, Version 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics) fol-
lowing 36–48 hours of incubation of cells with the above study compounds. The limit of detec-
tion was 20 copies/mL.
Source of PKC analog
SUW133 corresponds to analog 4 in a previous study describing its synthesis [26].
The final Ki data for each of the isoforms for SUW133 is as follows:
alpha: 1.8 nM
beta I: 6.3 nM

PKC binding assay protocol.
The protein kinase C affinity of test compounds was per-
formed via competition with 3H-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (3H-PDBu) as described below.
This entails a glass-fiber filtration method to determine bound radioligand.
Preparation of the binding assay buffer.
To a polypropylene vial was added Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4, 1 M, 1 mL), KCl (1 M, 2 mL), CaCl2 (0.1 M, 30 μL), and bovine serum albumin (40
mg, from Sigma). This mixture was diluted to 20 mL with deionized H2O, and mixed gently.
The buffer was stored on ice until use. The final concentration of these constituents are shown
in S2 Table.
Preparation of phosphatidylserine (PS) vesicles and PKC solution.
For every 2 assays,
3.5 mg phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, porcine, obtained as a solution in CHCl3) was
isolated by removing chloroform under a stream of nitrogen followed by reduced pressure.
The solid PS was suspended as vesicles in binding assay buffer (3.5 mL) by sonicating (Branson
Sonifier 250, power = 2, 50% duty cycle) six times for 30 s with a 30 s rest between sonications.
The resulting cloudy mixture (1 mg/mL PS) was stored on ice until use.
Assay Protein Kinase C (PKC) was prepared by dissolving a 4 μg aliquot of the indicated
recombinant human PKC isoform (Invitrogen) into 11.6 mL of binding assay buffer. The KD
values for all 7 isoforms were determined experimentally. The diluted PKC was stored on ice
for immediate use. This amount is sufficient for 2 assays with room for error.
Preparation of compound and 3H-PDBu dilutions.
3H-PDBu (American Radiolabeled
Chemicals, Inc.; specific activity: 20 μCi/mmol) was diluted 10-fold in DMSO from a 1 mCi/
mL commercial acetone solution. This 500 nM stock solution was further diluted in DMSO to
30 nM for use in assays. The 500 nM and 30 nM stock solutions were stored frozen in DMSO
at −20˚C until use. Compound dilutions were also prepared in DMSO, serially diluting from a
chosen high concentration (depending on analog potency) by factors of 3 to 8. Seven analog
concentrations were used to define the inhibition curve. For SUW133, for instance, concentra-
tions of sample dilutions were 667 nM, 222 nM, 74.0 nM, 24.7 nM, 8.23 nM, 2.74 nM, and
0.914 nM.
Master mix solution.
To a polypropylene tube 3.3 mL of 1 mg/mL phosphatidylserine
vesicles solution, 11 mL of PKC isoform solution, and 1.1 mL of 30 nM 3H-PDBu solution
were added. The resulting solution was vortexed to mix and stored on ice.
Assay protocol.
Triplicate data points were obtained for each analog concentration. For
each data point, 280 μL of Master Mix Solution and test compound at the given concentration
(20 μL) were added to a polypropylene tube. Non-specific 3H-PDBu binding was assessed in
triplicate by substitution of test compound with unlabeled PDBu (20 μL of a 75 μM stock,
assay concentration: 5 μM). Maximal 3H-PDBu binding was analyzed in triplicate by substitu-
tion of test compound with 20 μL DMSO. The solutions were vortexed to mix, incubated at
37˚C for 10 min, and incubated on ice for at least 30 min prior to filtration. Glass-fiber filters
(Whatman GF/B) were prepared by soaking in a solution of aqueous polyethyleneimine (10%
by volume, 18 mL) diluted in water (600 mL) for �60 min. Rinse buffer (500 mL, 20 mM Tris,
pH 7.4) was cooled to 4˚C for the duration of the incubation period and for the remainder of

 the assay. Assay tube contents were vacuum-filtered through the polyethylenimine-soaked
filters, using a Brandel Harvester, washing with rinse buffer three times and allowing to dry
first under vacuum filtration for 5 minutes and then under ambient conditions for � 2 hours.
The resulting dry filters had circular perforations for each data point which were removed
with forceps and placed into a scintillation vial. Scintillation vials were filled with Bio-Safe II
scintillation fluid (5 mL) and were measured for radioactivity using a Beckman LS 6000SC
scintillation counter. Counts per minute (cpm) were averaged for each triplicate dilution. The
data were then plotted (cpm vs. log(concentration)) using Prism by GraphPad Software and
an IC50 was determined using that program’s built-in one-site competition least squares
regression function. Ki values were calculated by the equation:
Ki ¼ IC50=ð1 þ ð½3H � PDBu�=KdÞÞ
The Kd of 3H-PDBu was determined via saturation binding under identical conditions and
the values for each PKC isoform are as follows: α = 15.1 nM; βI = 8.8 nM; γ = 13.8 nM; δ =
4.5 nM; ε = 6.2 nM; η = 18.4 nM; θ = 28.8 nM.
Ethics statement
Human subject research.

HIV from patient-derived cells: Leukapheresis were conducted in accordance with clinical
protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. All study subjects provided written
informed consent. Additional human cells/tissues used in this study were from anonymous
sources and therefore are not considered human subjects and thus not subject to Institutional
Review Board review. Anonymized fetal tissue was obtained from either the UCLA Gene and
Cellular Therapy Core or Advanced Biosciences Resources Inc. Peripheral blood was obtained
through the UCLA Blood Bank in an anonymous fashion.
Animal research.
Animal experiments conformed to all local and national guidelines and
