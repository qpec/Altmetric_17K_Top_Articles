Background: Previous studies on breast cancer (BC), underarm cosmetic products (UCP) and aluminum salts have
shown conflicting results. We conducted a 1:1 age-matched case-control study to investigate the risk for BC in
relation to self-reported UCP application.
Methods: Self-reported history of UCP use was compared between 209 female BC patients (cases) and 209
healthy controls. Aluminum concentration in breast tissue was measured in 100 cases and 52 controls. Multivar-
iable conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), adjusting for established BC risk factors.
Findings: Use of UCP was significantly associated with risk of BC (p = 0.036). The risk for BC increased by an OR of
3.88 (95% CI 1.03–14.66) in women who reported using UCP's several times daily starting at an age earlier than
30 years. Aluminum in breast tissue was found in both cases and controls and was significantly associated to self-
reported UCP use (p = 0.009). Median (interquartile) aluminum concentrations were significantly higher (p =
0.001) in cases than in controls (5.8, 2.3–12.9 versus 3.8, 2.5–5.8 nmol/g).
Interpretation: Frequent use of UCPs may lead to an accumulation of aluminum in breast tissue. More than daily
use of UCPs at younger ages may increase the risk of BC.

1. Background
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with a high
prevalence in economically developed countries (Kristensen et al.,
2014; Parkin et al., 2005). The etiology of breast cancer is multifactorial.
Age, genetic mutations and life-time estrogen exposure are well known
risk factors (Gail and Pfeiffer, 2015; Petracci et al., 2011; Pfeiffer et al.,
2013). These factors explain only a small part of the etiology (Turnbull
and Rahman, 2008) suggesting that environmental factors may also be
relevant in the development of breast cancer (Bonefeld-Jorgensen et
al., 2011; Coyle, 2004). A change in the topological distribution of mam-
mary carcinoma since 1975 (Bright et al., 2016; Darbre, 2016, 2009,
2005, 2003) towards an higher incidence in the upper outer quadrant
seems to point to underarm cosmetic products (UCPs) as a potential
contributor (Darbre, 2009, 2005, 2003; Darbre et al., 2013b). Previous
studies investigating the effect of UCPs on breast cancer have shown
conflicting results (McGrath, 2003; Mirick et al., 2002; Pasha et al.,
2008; Rodrigues-Peres et al., 2013). Therefore, latest systematic reviews
were not able to provide conclusive evidence (Namer et al., 2008;
Willhite et al., 2014). Active ingredients in most UCPs are aluminum-
based compounds as aluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate.
Aluminum salts have been associated with oxidative stress, DNA double
strand breaks, proliferation, interference in estrogen action before
(Darbre, 2009; Darbre et al., 2013a; Dyrssen et al., 1987; Farasani and
Darbre, 2015; Lankoff et al., 2006; Sappino et al., 2012) and with metas-
tasis recently (Mandriota et al., 2016). Mandriota et al. (2016a) demon-
strated in an established cancer mouse model that concentrations of
aluminum in the range of those measured in human breast are able to
transform cultured mammary epithelial cells, enabling them to form tu-
mors and to metastasize. It was further suggested that frequent use of
UCPs containing aluminum salts is a main source of measured alumi-
num in breast structures (Darbre et al., 2013b, 2011; Exley et al.,
2007; Mannello et al., 2009). Due to the genotoxic and possibly

 carcinogenic effect of aluminum salts, the use of UCPs may be related to
breast cancer (Darbre, 2001; Jennrich and Schulte-Uebbing, 2016;
Pineau et al., 2014; Rodrigues-Peres et al., 2013; Sappino et al., 2012).
The relationship of UCPs containing aluminum salts with breast can-
cer was investigated in few epidemiological studies showing conflicting
results (Fakri, 2006; McGrath, 2003; Mirick et al., 2002). Mirick et al.
(2002) and Fakri (2006) found no significant associations between an-
tiperspirants and increased risk of breast cancer. In contrast, McGrath
(2003) found that patients using UCPs frequently received their breast
cancer diagnosis at an earlier age than patients avoiding UCPs. However,
none of these studies included breast tissue measurements of alumi-
num with regard to UCP use. There exists, so far, no controlled study in-
vestigating the relationship of aluminum with breast cancer combining
an epidemiologic approach with breast tissue measurements.
We conducted a 1:1 age-matched hospital-based case-control study
aiming to investigate the risk for breast cancer in relation to self-report-
ed UCP use. We included measurements of aluminum concentrations in
breast tissue from a large series of breast cancer patients and healthy in-
dividuals in a controlled epidemiologic study. We hypothesized that (1)
breast cancer patients had used UCPs more frequently during their lives
than healthy controls, that (2) aluminum concentrations in breast tissue
is increased in cases, and that (3) there is a relationship between UCP
use and measured aluminum concentrations in breast tissue.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
Participants of this age-matched case-control study were recruited be-
tween January 2013 and October 2016 at the Medical University of Inns-
bruck, Austria. Eligible cases were all breast cancer patients aged 20–
85 years treated by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology who
had a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer within the last 5 years. Eligible
controls were women in the same age range (±2.5 years) without a his-
tory of malignant breast disease. Controls were recruited either at the
Department of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery or at other
departments. Selection of controls did not follow a formal probability
sampling scheme. Because of organizational limitations sampling was
done on random time points when trained interviewers were available
to find voluntary women fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Cases undergoing
mastectomy and healthy controls undergoing reduction mammoplasty
were eligible for tissue sampling.
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Uni-
versity of Innsbruck, (UN4759, 315/4.6). All participants provided their
written informed consent before taking part in the study.
2.2. Data Source and Tissue Samples
2.2.1. Structured Personal Interview
A structured personal interview was performed with all study par-
ticipants by interviewers who were trained to avoid suggestive ques-
tions and to use the key words antiperspirants, deodorants and
aluminum very carefully. The interviewers were medical school stu-
dents in their last year and a graduated psychologist. The questionnaire
used in these interviews was a modified version of the validated ques-
tionnaire used in the MARIE study (Slanger et al., 2007). Study partici-
pants were blinded as to the purpose of the study. They were asked to
attend a study on life style factors and BC, including questions about nu-
trition, physical activity and personal hygiene. There was no special
focus on UCP use. We also collected information on other BC related
characteristics such as estrogen and hormone exposure as well as ge-
netic factors. Questions asked refer to past exposure in four lifetime cat-
egories: ‘under the age of 30 years’, ‘between 30 and 50 years’, ‘over the
age of 50 years’ and ‘last five years before breast cancer diagnoses’. We
extended this questionnaire by specific questions regarding personal
hygiene, UCP use and aluminum exposure. The majority of UCPs on
the market during the past years were antiperspirants containing alu-
minum salts as active ingredients. There are a few UCPs without alumi-
num salts commonly called “deodorants” containing ingredients such as
perfumes and etheric oils. When asked it turned out that most women
were not able to discriminate between these two kinds of UCPs. We
therefore concluded that it would be misleading to analyze antiperspi-
rants and deodorants separately and consequently summarized them
into the term UCP as the main exposure variable. UCP application cate-
gorized in “never”, “1–4 times per month”, “2–6 times per week”,
“daily” and “several times per day” was defined as the primary endpoint
of this study.
2.2.2. Tissue Sampling and Measurement
Tissue sampling was performed in all cases and controls undergoing
surgery. In cases, we took samples of the breast affected by the tumor, in
controls sampling was performed on both breasts. Samples of 500 mg
were collected near the axilla in the upper outer quadrant, near the
mammilla and near the lateral sternal edge in the lower inner quadrant.
Thus, we collected three samples in cases and six samples in controls.
In cases, breast tissue was sampled at the day of surgery at the Mor-
phology Laboratory of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
during preparation for macroscopic and histo-pathological analysis. In
controls, tissue sampling was performed during the breast reduction
surgery in the operation theatre of the Department of Plastic, Recon-
structive and Aesthetic Surgery. Samples were carefully collected
avoiding any background contamination with aluminum regarding the
use of surgical instruments, lab tools and vials. Samples were labelled
with a patient code blinding any information regarding case/control as-
signment and tissue location and were immediately frozen and stored
at −80 °C at the Department of Biochemistry until analysis. Tissue prep-
aration and defatting was conducted as described in Exley et al. (2007).
In brief, thawed tissue was defatted by incubation at 37 °C for maximal
72 h to assure that dried tissue achieved constant weight. Mean of wet
weight of samples was 400 mg (±100 mg), mean of dried tissue was
150 mg (±100 mg). Fat was released as clear oil during drying process
in inclined plastic weighing boats. For degreasing and tissue transfer we
only used metal free instruments. Dry, weighed and defatted tissue was
transferred into 20 mL PFA Teflon© vessels with venting plugs and
screw caps (CEM Microwave Technology, Germany). Further tissue
preparation, digestion and dilution were done according to House
et al., 2013. For digestion we used high quality Nitric acid 69% Trace SE-
LECT® (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Digested and diluted tissue samples
as well as ninety method blanks were analyzed as clear fluids with
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (GF-AAS) with Zee-
man–effect background corrector (Thermo Scientific, Germany).
2.3. Statistical Analysis
The sample size of this case-control study was pre-specified and de-
termined to be adequate to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 2 or greater for
UCP application on a significance level of 5%.
Assuming a control proportion of 65% UCP use as in Mirick et al.
(2002), to achieve 80% statistical power, we were aiming to recruit 200
participants per group, a total of 400 women. In total we recruited 460
participants, 210 cases and 250 controls. Each case was age-matched in
a 1:1 ratio to one control subject, minimizing the age difference within
case-control pairs by a validated matching algorithm. The application of
this algorithm ensured an objective and random assignment of cases to
controls in order to reach the optimum result in terms of age difference.
Consequently, the pairs differed regarding interview dates.
Patient characteristics, genetic factors, hormone exposure, life style
parameters, UCP use were compared between cases and controls
using descriptive statistics. Means and medians as well as standard de-
viations (SD) and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated to summa-
rize continuous variables. Categorical variables were presented as
frequencies and percentages. We conducted conditional logistic
80

 regression analyses to determine relative risks, estimated as odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for UCP application and other
exposures related to breast cancer. The final multivariable model in-
cluded all variables that showed a p-value b 0.25 in univariable analyses
as well as all relevant variables known to be associated with breast can-
cer (Pfeiffer et al., 2013). We assessed effect modification through
tumor localization and timing of interviews by including interaction
terms into the adjusted conditional logistic regression models.
Aluminum concentrations from the different sampling locations
(three per case and six per control) were averaged per women, summa-
rized with medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for cases and controls
and stratified by UCP application. In a first step, the summarized alumi-
num concentrations were compared between cases and controls with
an independent t-test. In a second step, a three-way ANOVA for repeat-
ed measurements with the between-subject factor ‘case versus control’,
‘UCP use’ as ordinal scaled covariate, and the within-subject factor ‘sam-
pling location’ was performed on log10(x + 1) aluminum concentra-
tions. We performed subgroup analysis for aluminum measurements
separately for cases with tumors in the upper outer quadrant and tu-
mors in other quadrants. We considered a p-value smaller than 0.05
as statistically significant. For both matching and statistical analysis
SPSS Statistics v.22 (IBM Analytics, Armonk, NY, USA) was used.
3. Results
A total of 460 women participated in this study, of these 210 were
breast cancer cases and 250 were healthy controls. We excluded one
case due to breast cancer diagnosis earlier than 5 years before the inter-
view. One control had to be excluded due to unclear breast tissue pa-
thology. Finally, 209 cases were matched 1:1 to 209 controls
minimizing the age differences within pairs to a maximum of
3.5 years. Consequently cases and controls did not differ regarding
mean age (51.9 ± 12.0 versus 51.8 ± 12.1). Tissue samples were avail-
able in 100 cases and 52 controls undergoing surgery.
Characteristics of breast cancer patients and healthy controls togeth-
er with crude ORs from univariable analyses are shown in Table 1. As ex-
pected positive family history of breast cancer was the most
pronounced risk factor. Further characteristics that were significantly
different between cases and controls were a family history of other can-
cers such as prostate, ovarian and endometrium cancer, history of be-
nign breast disease and a lower body mass index.
As shown in Table 2, self-reported use of UCP at early ages
(b30 years) was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast
cancer (p = 0.0358) adjusting for age, family history of breast cancer,
family history of other cancer, history of benign breast disease, age at
menarche, parity, age at birth of first child, age at menopause, meno-
pausal status, hormone replacement therapy, average body mass
index and alcohol consumption. This association was triggered by
women who reported that they had used UCPs several times per day
under their age of 30 increasing their risk for breast cancer by an OR
of 3.88 with a 95% CI of 1.03–14.66 (p = 0.0456).
Aluminum in breast tissue (Table 3) was found in both cases and
controls ranging from 0 to 367.38 nmol/g dry weight and was signifi-
cantly associated with self-reported UCP use (p = 0.0344 for UCP use
under the age of 30, p = 0.0093 for UCP use during the last 5 years).
In cases, median (interquartile) aluminum concentrations observed
were 5.8 (2.3–12.9) nmol/g, significantly higher (p = 0.0014) than in
controls (3.8, 2.5–5.8 nmol/g).
In addition, we analyzed whether tumor localization modifies the
relationship between self-reported UCP use, aluminum concentration
and the risk for BC. Regarding UCP use there was no significant effect
modification by tumor localization (p = 0.680 for the UCP use
b30 years, p = 0.341 for the UCP use during last 5 years). In contrast, re-
garding measured aluminum concentrations, the stratified results for
tumor localization showed significant differences between cases and
controls in the subgroup of cases with a tumor in the upper outer quad-
rant only (Table 4).
4. Discussion
The findings of this age-matched hospital based case-control study
suggest an association between UCP use, aluminum concentration in
breast tissue and breast cancer. We found a significant difference be-
tween cases and controls in the pre-specified primary endpoint.

 However, the observed association of UCP use with breast cancer was in
fact limited to women who reported using UCP's several times a day
when they were under the age of 30.
In contrast to our findings, previous epidemiologic studies (Fakri,
2006; Mirick et al., 2002) did not support the hypothesis that UCP use
increases the risk for breast cancer. Fakri (2006) examined a very
small sample of 54 unmatched cases and 50 controls underpowered to
detect realistic effect sizes. In their study UCP use was dichotomous cat-
egorized in just two levels, using of UCPs versus no use, which is too im-
precise in regard to our results, where a significant association was
observed only when women used UCPs several times per day. Similarly,
in the much larger study of Mirick et al. (2002), UCP use was measured
also in a dichotomous way only. In the study of Mirick et al. (2002)
study participants were not asked about UCP use in different life time
categories and therefore possible effects of UCP use at younger ages
were not detectable. In fact, Mirick et al. (2002) reported antiperspirant
use rather than UCP use, however, in the light of our experiences it is
unclear how the authors discriminated between deodorant and antiper-
spirant use. Another important difference between Mirick et al. (2002)
and our study exists regarding the birth cohorts of breast cancer
patients recruited into the two studies. Breast cancer patients partici-
pating in the study of Mirick et al. (2002) were diagnosed in the early
1990′s, on average 20 years earlier than patients in our study. At the
time relevant for exposure, approximately between 1940 and 1960,
the use of UCPs was less common than 20 years later. UCP use strongly
increased in the last four decades and also cultural habits such as shav-
ing of axilla hair became only popular during the late 1980′s in western
countries (Darbre, 2009, 2003; McGrath, 2003).
So far, there exist six studies that measured aluminum concentration
in breast cancer patients comparing concentrations between benign
and malign breast tissues (Exley et al., 2007; House et al., 2013; Millos
et al., 2009; Ng et al., 1997; Pasha et al., 2008; Rodrigues-Peres et al.,
2013). These studies differed considerably regarding the amount of alu-
minum found in breast tissue likely because of discrepancies in mea-
surement
techniques.
Regarding,
the
analytical
approach
the
measured aluminum concentrations in our cohort were similar to the
studies of House et al. (2013) and Rodrigues-Peres et al. (2013).
None of the previous studies sampled control tissue from healthy in-
dividuals. Our study included tissue measurements of breast cancer pa-
tients and healthy individuals observing a significant difference

 regarding aluminum concentrations. Beyond this, we were able to show
a significant association between measured aluminum concentrations
in breast tissue and self-reported UCP use suggesting dermal absorption
of aluminum salts.
Differences in aluminum concentration between cases and controls
were only evident when restricting the analysis to cases with tumors
in the upper outer quadrant, supporting the hypothesis of Darbre
(2005, Darbre, 2009) that tumors in the upper outer quadrant are affect-
ed by the use of UCPs. Results of the questionnaire part, however, do not
support this hypothesis. Self-reported UCP use did not differ significant-
ly between cases and controls when considering tumor localization.
Tissue samples of controls showed less variation in aluminum con-
centrations than samples of breast cancer patients. In ten breast cancer
patients, aluminum concentrations over 60 nmol/g up to 367 nmol/g
dry weight (15–115 nmol/g wet weight) were observed. Mandriota et
al. (2016) and colleges recently showed that aluminum salt concentra-
tions of 100 nmol/g wet weight lead to transformation of in-vitro cul-
tured mammary epithelial cells enabling them to form tumors and
metastasis in mouse models. In contrast, aluminum concentration in
controls reached a maximum of 24.5 nmol/g dry weight (8 nmol/g
wet weight) only.
Our study has several strengths. We combined comprehensive ques-
tionnaire data of breast cancer cases and healthy individuals on under-
arm hygiene habits with data of aluminum concentration in tissue
samples. We applied a well-developed and accurate method for alumi-
num measurement (Exley et al., 2007; House et al., 2013). A standard-
ized sampling procedure, high purity of reagents and a high
measurement accuracy minimized background contamination. It is like-
ly that aluminum in breast tissue has a patchy distribution (Exley et al.,
2007; House et al., 2013), therefore, we collected multiple tissue sam-
ples alongside the transect from upper outer to upper inner quadrant.
Certain limitations of our study need to be discussed. A case-control
study is susceptible to recall bias. Self-reporting information may be in-
complete or inaccurate and may differ between cases and controls.
Younger women may remember in more detail about their specific hy-
giene habits than elderly women. The mix of incident and prevalent
cases in our study may be an additional source of bias. We assessed
whether the time span between BC diagnosis and interview date is an
effect modifier for the relation of UCP use with risk for BC. Although
there is no significant effect modification of the different timing of inter-
views (p = 0.282, for the ‘UCP use under the age of 30’ model, p = 0.877
for the ‘UCP use in the last 5 years’ model) we cannot rule out any recall
issues between incident and prevalent cases.
We tried to reduce reporting and measurement bias by performing
personal interviews with well-trained interviewers. The limited sample
size of the study leads to relatively small numbers in the sub-categories
of the main exposure variable. Though significant, the result concerning
UCP use several times per day is based on a few cases only. Furthermore,
we cannot exclude a reverse causation effect, meaning that the breast
tumor may accumulate aluminum. There are studies that reported higher
levels of transition metals in tissue of breast cancer patients (Cui et al.,
2007; Ionescu et al., 2006; Romanowicz-Makowska et al., 2011).
Although, we matched cases and controls on age, the subgroup for tissue
sampling is not age matched. However, in our study, aluminum concen-
trations did not correlate with age (r = −0.028, p = 0.7291).
In conclusion, our study provides novel insights and additional evi-
dence regarding a possible role of UCP use and aluminum salts in the
etiology of breast cancer. Our findings suggest that frequent use of

 UCPs may lead to an accumulation of aluminum in breast tissue. We
could show that women who reported to use UCPs several times a day
starting at an age under 30 years may even have an increased risk for
breast cancer. Until definitive answers about the involvement of alumi-
num in carcinogenesis of breast cancer, we recommend that particularly
women at their younger ages should be careful with the use of UCPs and
avoid its excessive use.
