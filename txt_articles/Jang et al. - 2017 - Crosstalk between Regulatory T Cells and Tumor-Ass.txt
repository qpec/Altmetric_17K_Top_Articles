In Brief
Pancreatic tumors recruit dendritic cells
that can switch between preventing or
promoting immune responses. Jang et al.
show that regulatory T cells are
responsible for instructing the dendritic
cells to prevent anti-tumor immunity.
Removing the regulatory T cell
subset allows dendritic cells to induce a
potent anti-tumor immune response.

SUMMARY
Regulatory T (Treg) cell infiltration constitutes a
prominent feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarci-
noma (PDA). However, the immunomodulatory func-
tion of Treg cells in PDA is poorly understood. Here,
we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient
to evoke effective anti-tumor immune response in
early and advanced pancreatic tumorigenesis in
mice. This response is dependent on interferon-g
(IFN-g)-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We show
that Treg cells engage in extended interactions with
tumor-associated CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) and
restrain their immunogenic function by suppressing
the expression of costimulatory ligands necessary
for CD8+ T cell activation. Consequently, tumor-
associated CD8+ T cells fail to display effector activ-
ities when Treg cell ablation is combined with DC
depletion. We propose that tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells can promote immune tolerance by suppressing
tumor-associated DC immunogenicity. The thera-
peutic manipulation of this axis might provide an
effective approach for the targeting of PDA.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most
lethal human malignancies (Ryan et al., 2014). A hallmark of
PDA is a pronounced fibroinflammatory stroma, which contrib-
utes to disease initiation and progression (Stromnes et al.,
2014; Vonderheide and Bayne, 2013). The inflammatory infil-
trates that populate PDA lesions are predominantly immunosup-
pressive in nature and include tumor-associated macrophages,
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), gd T cells, and reg-
ulatory T (Treg) cells (Daley et al., 2016; Hiraoka et al., 2006; Mar-
kowitz et al., 2015). Murine models of oncogenic Ras-driven PDA
recapitulate many of these immune signatures (Bayne et al.,
2012; Clark et al., 2007; Daley et al., 2016). Understanding the
mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive effects of these
cell types is therefore essential to develop effective immunother-
apies for the treatment of PDA.
CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells are crucial for the maintenance of
immunological self-tolerance and have the ability to actively
impede the anti-tumor immune response in a variety of cancer
types (Josefowicz et al., 2012). In PDA, the accumulation of
Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment occurs during the pre-
invasive stage of the disease (Clark et al., 2007; Hiraoka et al.,
2006). A high frequency of Treg cells in the pre-neoplastic
pancreas is associated with poor prognosis and reduced sur-
vival in murine and human PDA (Hiraoka et al., 2006; Tang
et al., 2014). Accordingly, Treg cell depletion in combination
with conventional PDA treatment strategies has been shown to
enhance cancer-specific T cell activation in preclinical studies
(Keenan et al., 2014; Leao et al., 2008).
A variety of mechanisms for Treg cell-mediated suppression
of effector T cell responses have been proposed, including
direct elimination of effector T cells and competition with effector
T cells for access to antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs)
(Josefowicz et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2007; Nishikawa and Sakagu-
chi, 2010). Treg cells have also been shown to suppress DC
immunogenicity in in vitro co-culture systems (Cederbom et al.,
2000; Onishi et al., 2008). However, the precise mechanism of
Treg cell-dependent immune modulation in PDA remains poorly
understood.
Here, we demonstrate that Treg cells promote PDA develop-
ment through the suppression of CD8+ T cell-dependent anti-
tumor immunity. Intratumoral Treg cells engage in prolonged
interactions with tumor-associated CD11c+ DCs and reduce
their expression of molecules important for T cell activation.
Treg cell ablation leads to the restoration of immunogenic
tumor-associated CD11c+ DCs and increases in CD8+ T cell
activation. Importantly, Treg cell ablation results in an inhibition
in tumor growth that is dependent on interferon-g (IFN-g) ex-
pressed by CD8+ T cells. Thus, the targeting of Treg cells in

 PDA may facilitate anti-tumor immunity by harnessing the im-
mune-stimulatory potential of tumor-associated DCs.
RESULTS
Treg Cells Are Required for Pancreatic Tumorigenesis
To discern the functional role of Treg cells in the development
of pancreatic neoplasia, we employed an orthotopic implanta-
tion model in which primary KrasG12D-expressing pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells (KrasG12D-PDECs) labeled with GFP
(GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs) are injected into the pancreata of synge-
neic C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2013).
This model histologically recapitulates the pre-invasive stages
of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) development and
induces an intra-pancreatic immune response similar to that
observed in the genetically engineered p48-Cre;KrasG12D (KC)
mouse model of pancreatic neoplasia (Clark et al., 2007; Py-
layeva-Gupta et al., 2012). Furthermore, it preserves the natural
histopathological features of disease development in that the le-
sions are produced in a focal manner and evolve in the context of
normal pancreatic tissue. The implanted cells form a discernable
mass (hereafter referred to as the tumor) that can be isolated
along with the immediately adjacent parenchyma (hereafter
referred to as the tumor microenvironment [TME]) and analyzed
by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We first assessed
the frequency of tumor-associated Treg cells using the lineage
specification transcription factor of Treg cells, forkhead box P3
(Foxp3) (Hori et al., 2003). Treg cells were readily detected within
1 week post-implantation of GFP-KrasG12D-PDEC tumors and
increased another �2.5-fold by 5 weeks (Figures 1A and 1B),
whereas Treg cells were rare in sham-injected or WT pancreata
(data not shown). Importantly, Foxp3+ Treg cells in the TME
displayed elevated levels of the activation markers CD44 (Fig-
ure 1C), a hyaluronic acid receptor expressed on activated and
memory Treg cell populations (Darrasse-Je
` ze et al., 2009); cyto-
toxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), a Treg cell
effector molecule (Wing et al., 2008); and programmed death 1
(PD-1), a negative costimulatory molecule (Keir et al., 2008),
compared to tumor-draining pancreatic lymph nodes (Pan
LNs) (Figures 1D and S1A). These data indicate that the develop-
ment of pancreatic neoplasia is accompanied by the progressive
accumulation of activated Treg cells.
Next, we examined the effect of Treg cell depletion on pancre-
atic neoplasia by implanting GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs into the pan-
creata of Foxp3DTR mice in which the human diphtheria toxin
(DT) receptor (DTR) is expressed under the control of the
Foxp3 locus (Kim et al., 2007) (Figure 1E). DT treatment 1 week
following orthotopic implantation resulted in >90% ablation of
Treg cells within the pancreatic TME (Figure 1F) and a significant
reduction in tumor growth (Figures 1G and 1H). DT treatment had
no effect on the growth of GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs implanted into
WT mice (Figure S1B). The anti-tumor effect of Treg cell ablation
persisted for 5 weeks post-implantation (Figure S1C). In addi-
tion, using an anti-CD25 neutralizing antibody to deplete Treg
cells in KC mice, we observed a significant delay in disease pro-
gression (Figures S2A–S2C). Furthermore, Treg cell depletion in
mice implanted with KPC cells derived from pancreata of a
KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+;Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse (Byrne and Von-
derheide, 2016; Lo et al., 2015) was accompanied by a marked
reduction in tumor volume and prolonged overall survival (Fig-
ures 1I and 1J). Together, these data demonstrate that Treg cells
contribute to pancreatic tumor growth at both the early and late
stages of disease progression.
Anti-tumor Immunity of Treg Cell Ablation Is Dependent
on IFN-g-Producing CD8+ T Cells
Since anti-tumor responses require functional effector CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, we assessed the effect of Treg cell ablation on
effector T cells in the TME, tumor-draining pancreatic lymph
nodes (Pan LNs) and peripheral inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs).
DT-induced Treg cell ablation resulted in the expansion and acti-
vation of tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at all sites (Fig-
ures 2A–2D and S3A–S3D). However, we have observed that in-
tratumoral Treg cells express higher levels of effector molecules
CTLA-4 and PD-1 (the latter being regulated by antigen expo-
sure) relative to Treg cells in the tumor-draining Pan LNs and
iLNs (Figures 1D and S1A). Thus, while we cannot formally
exclude a contribution of effector CD8+ T cells that have origi-
nated from tumor-draining Pan LNs to the anti-tumoral effect
of DT-induced Treg cell depletion, the properties of the TME-
associated Treg cells suggest a primary role for tumor-resident
Treg cells in mediating immunosuppression.
We then sought to determine whether the anti-tumor effect of
Treg cell ablation is mediated through CD4+ or cytotoxic CD8+
T cell activation. To this end, Treg cells were ablated alone or
in combination with either CD4+ or CD8+ T cell depletion using
CD4- or CD8-depleting antibody, and tumor growth was
measured after 15 days. The depletion of CD4+ T cells resulted
in reduction of tumor growth similar to that observed in Treg
cell ablation. However, the simultaneous depletion of CD4+
T cells in combination with Treg cell ablation did not further
decrease tumor growth compared to Treg cell depletion alone
(Figure S3E), indicating that CD4+ Foxp3� T cells are dispens-
able for the anti-tumor effect of Treg cell ablation. In contrast,
the anti-tumor response observed in the setting of Treg cell abla-
tion was reversed when combined with CD8+ T cell depletion
(Figure 2E). Since only CD8+ T cells displayed a significant in-
crease in the production of IFN-g, a potent tumoricidal cytokine
(Shankaran et al., 2001), we further investigated the role of IFN-g
in mediating the immune response to pancreatic neoplasia in
orthotopic implant-bearing WT or Foxp3DTR mice treated with
a neutralizing anti-IFN-g monoclonal antibody (mAb). While
IFN-g blockade in WT mice did not affect tumor growth, the
concurrent administration of anti-IFN-g antibody and DT to
Foxp3DTR mice abolished the inhibitory effect of Treg cell abla-
tion on tumor growth (Figure 2F). Histological analysis revealed
that the combined depletion of Treg cells and IFN-g blockade
was associated with the expansion of neoplastic lesions and a
reduction in the frequency of apoptotic cells (Figures 2G–2I).
Collectively, these results indicate that Treg cells may promote
pancreatic neoplasia through the suppression of IFN-g-produc-
ing activated CD8+ T cells.
Treg Cells Engage CD11c+ DCs within the TME

 the immune response (Onishi et al., 2008; Schildknecht et al.,
2010; Tang et al., 2006). To test whether such interactions might
be relevant to the immunosuppressive function of Treg cells
in the context of pancreatic neoplasia, we employed intravital
two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (TPLSM). We first as-
sessed the prevalence within the TME of cells expressing
CD11c, an integrin that is enriched in DCs, by implanting GFP-
KrasG12D-PDECs into the pancreata of CD11c-EYFP mice.
CD11c+ cells were rare in the normal pancreas but abundantly
present within the neoplastic lesions formed by the orthotopi-
cally implanted GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs (Figures 3A and 3B).
Next, to analyze the spatiotemporal relationships between Treg
and CD11c cells, GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs were implanted into
pancreata of Foxp3-EGFP;CD11c-EYFP mice. The majority of
Foxp3+ Treg cells were observed to directly contact resident
CD11c+ cells for at least 600 s, which was the duration of the
time-lapse imaging (Figures 3C and 3D; Movie S1). Consistent
with this co-localization pattern, immune staining of tumor
sections showed that the majority of Foxp3+ cells at the tumor
margin are located in close proximity to cells expressing
CD11c in mice implanted with GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs or KPC
cells (Figure 3H) and in KC mice (Figure 3I). By comparison,
the interactions of CD8+ T cells and CD11c+ cells in orthotopic
implant-bearing CD8a-Cre;Rosatdtomato;CD11c-EYFP mice had
a shorter median duration of 100 s (Figures 3E–3G; Movie S2),
which was extended to a median duration of 300 s in the setting
of Treg cell ablation (Figures S4A–S4D; Movies S3 and S4).
These observations raise the intriguing possibility that the inter-
actions of Treg cells and CD8+ T cells with antigen-bearing
DCs are mutually limiting. We found no evidence for tumor-
associated tertiary lymphoid structures (TA-TLSs) that contain
Foxp3+ Treg cells in either autochthonous or orthotopic pancre-
atic neoplasia (Figures S5A and S5B).
We next sought to characterize the nature of the CD11c-yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) cells recruited to tumors formed by the
implanted GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs. In agreement with a previous
study reporting that, in CD11c-EYFP mice, the cells visualized
by in vivo TPLSM are DCs (Lindquist et al., 2004), the CD11c-
YFP cells expressed the DC markers CD11c, major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) class II, and CD135 (Flt3) (Figure 4A).
Expression of the macrophage marker F4/80 was detected
only in a small subset (�8%) of the CD11c-YFP cells (Figure 4B).
Notably, the CD11c-YFP cells located in the tumor-proximal re-
gion (within 50 mm of the tumor margin) exhibited lower motility
and shorter displacement trajectory compared to CD11c-YFP
cells located distally to the tumor (more than 50 mm from the
tumor border) (Figures 4C–4E). Furthermore, the CD11c-YFP
cells that were closely juxtaposed to the tumor had a dendritic
morphology (Figure 3A).
In order to present antigen to Treg cells or effector T cells, DCs
need to capture tumor antigens. To track the capacity of CD11c-
YFP cells to take up tumor-derived material, bone marrow cells
isolated from CD11c-EYFP mice were transplanted into lethally
irradiated p48-Cre;KrasG12D;RosatdTomato (KCT) or control p48-
Cre;RosatdTomato (CT) mice, in which tdTomato is specifically
expressed in the cells of the exocrine pancreas. We then looked
for YFP+ cells with intracellular tdTomato as a measure of
pancreatic antigen uptake. Confocal microscopy in sections
from KCT chimeras revealed tdTomato puncta in CD11c+ cells
within the neoplastic lesions (Figure 4F). Flow cytometry analysis
also demonstrated the presence of tdTomato+ CD45+ cells in the
pancreas and Pan LNs of both CT and KCT mice, respectively
(Figure 4G). The tdTomato+ CD45+ cells expressed high levels
of CD11c and MHC class II, indicating that the majority of cells
in the tdTomato+ CD45+ population are likely to be DCs, as
they bring tumor antigens to Pan LNs (Figure 4H).
Tumor-Associated CD11c+ DCs Display a Tolerogenic
Phenotype
The function of DCs depends on their maturation and activation
status, which is defined by the expression of costimulatory mol-
ecules on their cell surface (Steinman et al., 2003). Expression
levels of the maturation marker MHC class II (I-Ad) and the cos-
timulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 (B7.2) on tumor-associ-
ated CD11c+ DCs decreased over time in the pancreatic TME
(Figure 5A). Similarly, in KC mice, expression of the maturation
markers on CD11c+ DCs was significantly lower in the pancreas
than in the Pan LNs (Figure S6A) and in WT mice (Figure S6B).
These observations indicate that tumor-associated DCs are
immature or semi-mature DCs and as such are likely to drive a
tolerogenic response during tumor progression. Consistent
with this postulate, we found that tumor-associated DCs express
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme implicated in the
suppression of T cell responses and the promotion of immune
tolerance (Munn and Mellor, 2016) (Figure 5B). Expression of
IDO in DCs was also observed in human PDA, underscoring
the potential pathophysiological relevance of this observation
(Figure 5C).
The Tolerogenic Phenotype of Tumor-Associated
CD11c+ DCs Is Dependent on Treg Cells
Treg cells are endowed with the capacity to regulate costimula-
tory molecules on DCs through cell-contact-dependent mecha-
nisms in vitro (Cederbom et al., 2000; Onishi et al., 2008; Qureshi
et al., 2011). Given our observations that Treg cells engage in
stable interactions with tumor-associated DCs, we investigated
whether Treg cells may downregulate costimulatory molecules
expressed on DCs. Implantation of GFP-KrasG12D-PDECs into
the pancreata of Foxp3DTR mice followed by DT treatment was
accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of tu-
mor-associated CD11c+ DCs (Figures 6A and 6B). Furthermore,
the expression levels of costimulatory molecules on tumor-asso-
ciated CD11c+ MHC class II+ DCs were significantly increased
in the absence of Foxp3+ Treg cells (Figures 6C and S6C). In

 addition, the expression of IDO in tumor-associated CD11c+
DCs decreased following the ablation of Treg cells (Figure 6D
and 6E). Collectively, these data suggest that Treg cells restrain
the expansion of tumor-associated CD11c+ DCs and their ca-
pacity to provide costimulation to T cells.
Treg Cells Act on Tumor-Associated CD11c+ DCs to
Impair Cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell Activation
To determine whether there is a mechanistic link between the
upregulation of DC activation markers and CD8+ T cell activation
in the context of Treg cell ablation, we performed Treg cell and
DC co-depletion. WT or Foxp3DTR mice were injected with DT
on days 7 and 9 after implantation of GFP-KrasG12D-PDEC in
combination with administration of either control hamster immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) or anti-CD11c (N418) mAbs on days 7 and 10
(Figure 7A). This regimen resulted in �95% and �80% depletion
of graft-associated Treg cells and DCs, respectively (Figures 7B
and 7C). The effectiveness of DC depletion was confirmed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a different clone
of anti-CD11c antibody (HL3) to rule out the possible contribu-
tion of epitope masking to the analysis (Figure S7A). Whereas
the depletion of CD11c+ DCs alone did not affect tumor growth,
the anti-tumor response observed in the setting of Treg cell
ablation was reversed when combined with CD11c+ DC deple-
tion (Figure 7A). Furthermore, CD4+ T cell activation was not
impacted by combined Treg cell and DC ablation as compared
with Treg cell ablation alone (Figures 7D and S7B). By contrast,
ablation of Treg cells and DCs together fully reverted the propor-
tion of CD8+ T cells expressing CD44, granzyme B, and IFN-g to
levels observed in control grafts or CD11c+ DC depletion alone
(Figures 7E and S7C). Taken together, our results suggest that
the cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation and effector activity
observed in the setting of Treg cell ablation might be mediated
by the functional maturation of tumor-associated CD11c+ DCs.
DISCUSSION
Tumor-associated inflammation is a dynamic process involving
the infiltration of multiple subtypes of leukocytes into the tumor
stroma. A prominent component of the immune infiltrate is
Treg cells, the presence of which correlates with poor clinical
outcome in a variety of cancer types (Shang et al., 2015;
Tang et al., 2014). In oncogenic KrasG12D-induced pancreatic
neoplasia, immune cell infiltration is an early and consistent
event (Clark et al., 2007; Guerra et al., 2007). However, the exact
role of Treg cells in pancreatic tumorigenesis is poorly under-
stood. Here, we demonstrate that in the context of pancreatic
neoplasia, intratumoral Treg cells play a tumor-promoting role
by conferring immunosuppressive properties to tumor-associ-
ated CD11c+ DCs. This limits the activation of tumor-infiltrating
CD8+ T cells, resulting in the reduction of IFN-g production and
a defect in tumor rejection.
The mechanisms by which Treg cells are recruited into
the TME are not well understood. We have found that Treg cells
accumulate around GFP-KrasG12D-PDEC grafts within 1 week
post-implantation. The short duration of this interval suggests
that the neoplastic cells themselves may play a direct role in
promoting Treg cell infiltration. Indeed, KrasG12D-PDECs (un-
published data) and pancreatic cancer cells can produce high
levels of the Treg cell attractants CXCL10, CCL5, and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that trigger the migration of
Treg cells through interaction with the Treg cell-surface recep-
tors CXCR3 (Lunardi et al., 2015), CCR5 (Tan et al., 2009), and
neuropilin-1 (Hansen et al., 2012), respectively. Other cells
within the TME, such as pancreatic stellate cells and tumor-
infiltrating MDSCs, have also been reported to express high
levels of Treg cell chemotactic factors, including CXCL10,
CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 (Lunardi et al., 2015; Schlecker
et al., 2012). Thus, the intratumoral accumulation of all of the
above cell types over the course of pancreatic tumor develop-
ment may augment Treg cell infiltration and contribute to their
expansion.
Our data demonstrate that the Treg cells that are recruited to
the tumor graft are initially neuropilin-1hi (data not shown) and
CD44low and are therefore most likely naive Treg cells of thymic
origin that are selected on self-antigens (Weiss et al., 2012). At
later stages, the vast majority of the intratumoral Treg cells
exhibit a CD44high memory/effector phenotype. It is not clear
whether this shift reflects an in situ activation event or the recruit-
ment of memory/effector Treg cells. The possibility that the acti-
vated phenotype is acquired in situ is supported by our observa-
tion that Treg cells engage in prolonged interactions with DCs
within the TME. The DC-Treg cell interaction has been shown
to potentiate Treg cell activation through either antigen recogni-
tion or the interaction of semaphorin 4A expressed on DCs with
the Treg cell-expressed receptor neuropilin-1 (Delgoffe et al.,
2013; Sarris et al., 2008). Of note, we have determined that neu-
ropilin-1 is abundantly expressed in intratumoral Treg cells at all
stages of pancreatic tumor progression (data not shown). Thus,
the recruitment of CD44low naive Treg cells that have low expres-
sion of CXCR3 and CCR5 could potentially be mediated through
the chemotactic interaction between neuropilin-1 and tumor-
derived VEGF.
Experimental depletion of Treg cells by administration of anti-
CD25 antibodies or by DT administration to Foxp3DTR mice has
been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of tumors, consis-
tent with a role for Treg cells in suppressing anti-tumor immune
responses (Bos et al., 2013; Joshi et al., 2015; Teng et al., 2010).
However, the effector mechanisms by which Treg cells modulate
anti-tumor immunity appear to vary between different tumor
types. For example, in breast cancer, the anti-tumoral effect of
Treg cell ablation is dependent on CD4+ T cells and IFN-g, point-
ing to a potential role for CD4+ T cells as a non-redundant source
of protective IFN-g (Bos et al., 2013). In fibrosarcomas, the

 immune rejection of tumors following Treg cell depletion is CD8+
T cell and IFN-g dependent (Teng et al., 2010). Our findings indi-
cate that similar effector mechanisms mediate the tumoricidal
effects of Treg cell depletion on pancreatic tumors. The depen-
dence on CD8+ T cells is consistent with the observation that

 various conventional helper T cells, is to promote the onset of
pancreatic neoplasia by modulating the activity of cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells. Ultimately, in human tumors, the potential thera-
peutic benefits of Treg cell targeting might be influenced by
tumor-type specific mechanisms of immune tolerance.
Our findings identify DCs as critical targets of Treg cells to sup-
press anti-tumor immunity. DCs are essential determinants of
the tumor immune response through the induction of immunoge-
nicity or tolerance (Steinman et al., 2003). Tolerogenic DCs play a
crucial role in immune tolerance through the inhibition of T cell
proliferation or the induction of T cell anergy or Treg cell gener-
ation, resulting in diminished T cell-dependent anti-tumor immu-
nity (Maldonado and von Andrian, 2010; Steinman et al., 2003).
Tumor-associated DCs have been shown to display tolerogenic
properties such as low expression of costimulatory molecules,
low ability to process and present antigen to tumor-specific
T cells, and low production of proinflammatory cytokines in a
variety of cancer types (Bauer et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2007; Pin-
zon-Charry et al., 2005). The accumulation of tolerogenic tumor-
associated DCs has been attributed to tumor- and TME-derived
immunosuppressive factors such as VEGF, interleukin-10 (IL-
10), transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), and PGE2 that modu-
late DC maturation and favor tolerogenic DC differentiation (Ghir-
inghelli et al., 2005; Scarlett et al., 2012; Yang and Lattime, 2003).
In addition, it has been proposed that Treg cell-mediated DC
suppression could be mediated by direct cell-to-cell contact,
leading to the downregulation of costimulatory molecules and
apoptosis in DCs (Bauer et al., 2014; Boissonnas et al., 2010;
Larmonier et al., 2007). Consistent with this idea, we have found
that DCs interact with Treg cells in the pancreatic TME. The inter-
action between DCs and Treg cells has also been reported in
breast cancer (Bauer et al., 2014), TA-TLSs in lung cancer (Joshi
et al., 2015), and tumor-draining LNs (Boissonnas et al., 2010),
suggesting that a contact-based crosstalk between these cell
populations may be a general feature of tumor immune evasion.
The tolerogenic nature of DCs that are recruited to the pancre-
atic TME is also indicated by their expression of IDO. IDO-ex-
pressing DCs found at the tumor site and in tumor-draining LNs
have been implicated in suppressing anti-tumor T cell responses
to tumor-derived antigens and in promoting immune tolerance
(Munn et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2007). Mechanistically, the
tolerogenic effect of IDO expression has been attributed to its
enzymatic activity that leads to a reduction of tryptophan levels
and the accumulation of metabolites of tryptophan catabolism,
resulting in the inhibition of T cell proliferation and effector T cell
toxicity (Munn and Mellor, 2016). A principal mechanism by which
the expression of IDO in DCs can be upregulated is through the
interaction of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 with

 CTLA-4 expressed on Treg cells (Fallarino et al., 2003). The po-
tential relevance of this mechanism to IDO expression in tumor-
associated DCs is indicated by our observation that tumor-asso-
ciated Treg cells display elevated levels of CTLA-4 compared to
other lymphoid tissues. Intriguingly, IDO has been shown to
modulate the immunosuppressive phenotype of Treg cells by
controlling the levels of Akt signaling (Sharma et al., 2015), sug-
gesting that the Treg cell-DC interaction in the TME may be
involved in bidirectional communication. Thus, the establishment
of immune tolerance in the pancreatic TME may in part be driven
by a feed-forward mechanism involving the reciprocal interaction
between DCs and Treg cells that mutually reinforces their immu-
nosuppressive activities. Further insights from studies employing
autochthonous mouse models of PDA as well as human PDA
samples will be required to fully assess whether signal pathways
that are downregulated in tumor-associated DCs through inter-
actions with Treg cells can be therapeutically exploited to
improve the anti-tumor immune response.
In summary, our study provides insights into Treg cell function
in PDA progression. We demonstrate that Treg cells confer an
immunosuppressive phenotype on tumor-associated CD11c+
DCs that then fail to activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cell-mediated de-
layed tumor growth. Targeting this series of interactions may
provide a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PDA.

 In Vivo Treatments
For Treg cell ablation studies, DT (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intraperitone-
ally (i.p.) at 50 mg per kg of body weight at the indicated times. For neutral-
ization and depletion studies, anti-mouse IFN-g (1 mg, clone XMG1.2,
Bio X Cell), anti-mouse CD11c (500 mg, clone N418, Bio X Cell), anti-mouse
CD8 (250 mg, clone 53-6.72, Bio X Cell), anti-mouse CD4 (150 mg, clone
GK1.5, Bio X Cell), or anti-mouse CD25 (500 mg, clone PC-61.5.3, Bio X
Cell) was injected i.p. at the indicated times. Isotype control antibodies
used were rat IgG1, Armenian hamster IgG, or rat IgG2a from Bio X Cell,
respectively.
Intravital TPLSM of Pancreas
Pancreata were prepared microsurgically for intravital microscopy. Mice
were anaesthetized by an initial intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg
ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and boosted with a half dose every
30–60 min. The spleen and pancreatic tail were externalized through a
1-cm left abdominal side incision, gently pulled out, and carefully fixed with
a custom-made plastic apparatus, without inducing vascular damage. The
mouse was then placed on the stage mounted with a coverslip so that the
pancreas was in contact with the coverslip for imaging with an inverted
objective. Detailed image acquisition and analysis are described in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Immunofluorescence
Mouse pancreata were harvested and fixed with 4% PFA for 1 hr at 4�C and
cryoprotected with 30% sucrose for 18 hr. Fixed samples were then
embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound and snap frozen
at �80�C until further processing.
The use of human tissue was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the NYU School of Medicine and samples (provided by the
Tissue Acquisition and Biorepository Service) were obtained with informed
consent. 5-mm-thick sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples
were used for immunofluorescence staining. Detailed immunofluorescence,
immunochemistry, H&E staining, and antibody information can be found in
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Flow Cytometry
For mononuclear cell isolation, pancreata were minced into small fragments
and incubated in collagenase V (1 mg/mL, Sigma) with DNase I (Roche) in
RPMI-1640 at 37�C for 30 min with 150 rpm agitation. Dissociated cells
were passed through a 70-mm cell strainer and washed with RPMI-1640 sup-
plemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Total mononuclear cells were
further purified by 47% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation.
Spleens and LNs were mechanically homogenized and passed through a
70-mm cell strainer. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK Lysis buffer (Lonza).
Isolated cells were incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 antibody (BD PharMingen)
to prevent non-specific antibody binding. Surface antigens were stained
with the antibodies described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
The corresponding isotype IgGs were stained. Dead cells were excluded using
LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen). Multiparameter analysis
was performed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with
FlowJo software (Tree Star). The geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was calculated as follows: MFI = MHC class II, CD40, CD80, or CD86 geomet-
ric mean � isotype geometric mean. Detailed Foxp3 and intracellular cytokine
staining for flow cytometry and antibody information is described in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Unpaired Student’s t tests or
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare two variables
as indicated in the figure legends. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for multiple-
group comparison. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated using
the survival time of each mouse. The log-rank test was used to test for
significant differences between two groups. Statistical analyses were
performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
