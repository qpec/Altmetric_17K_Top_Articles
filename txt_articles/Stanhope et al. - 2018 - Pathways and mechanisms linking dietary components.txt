Summary
Calories from any food have the potential to increase risk for obesity and cardio-
metabolic disease because all calories can directly contribute to positive energy
balance and fat gain. However, various dietary components or patterns may pro-
mote obesity and cardiometabolic disease by additional mechanisms that are not
mediated solely by caloric content. Researchers explored this topic at the 2017
CrossFit Foundation Academic Conference ‘Diet and Cardiometabolic Health –
Beyond Calories’, and this paper summarizes the presentations and follow-up
discussions. Regarding the health effects of dietary fat, sugar and non-nutritive
sweeteners, it is concluded that food-specific saturated fatty acids and sugar-
sweetened beverages promote cardiometabolic diseases by mechanisms that are
additional to their contribution of calories to positive energy balance and that as-
partame does not promote weight gain. The challenges involved in conducting
and interpreting clinical nutritional research, which preclude more extensive con-
clusions, are detailed. Emerging research is presented exploring the possibility that
responses to certain dietary components/patterns are influenced by the metabolic
status, developmental period or genotype of the individual; by the responsiveness
of brain regions associated with reward to food cues; or by the microbiome. More
research regarding these potential ‘beyond calories’ mechanisms may lead to new
strategies for attenuating the obesity crisis.

Introduction: Janet King, Laura Schmidt
With the emergence and global spread of the highly
palatable, processed foods that are major components of
the Western diet and the rising rates of obesity and cardio-
metabolic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease [CVD] and
type 2 diabetes [T2D]), the focus of nutrition science has
shifted from concerns about dietary deficiencies to concerns
about dietary excesses. Given the well-documented relation-
ship between Western diet and obesity (1–4) and between
obesity and cardiometabolic disease (5) (Fig. 1), the dietary
excess of greatest concern is caloric consumption. Unques-
tionably, most Americans are consuming too many calories;
69% of US adults are overweight (6), and new estimates,
just released, indicate 39.8% of US adults are obese (7).
Yet a major question remains: are all calories equal with re-
gard to effects on cardiometabolic disease and obesity? This
was the question that was deliberated by national and inter-
national researchers at the 2017 CrossFit Foundation
Academic Conference ‘Diet and Cardiometabolic Health –
Beyond Calories’ in San Francisco, California.
In one important aspect, the answer to this question is
clearly ‘yes’. The first law of thermodynamics states that en-
ergy can be neither created nor destroyed: energy in = energy
out. Nutritionally, this means that once full growth is reached,
if the energy consumed from foods and beverages is greater
than the energy expended through metabolism, thermogene-
sis and physical activity, the surfeit will be stored mostly as
body fat. Thus, our traditional energy balance paradigm
dictates that excess consumption of calories from any food
will drive energy storage and increase the risk of obesity and
cardiometabolic disease as defined by
Energy in > energy expended ¼ ↑energy storage as fat:
There is no doubt that positive energy balance, due to exces-
sive caloric consumption and/or inadequate physical activity,
is the main driver of the obesity and cardiometabolic
epidemics. However, it was the first objective of the
Conference to consider whether certain dietary components
increase risk for cardiometabolic disease by metabolic effects
that are not driven solely by positive energy balance and fat
gain. The evidence specific for saturated fat and added sugar,
and the challenges pertaining to obtaining such evidence,
were presented and discussed. It was the second objective of
the conference to consider whether certain dietary patterns
or components have the potential to promote fat gain
via mechanisms that are in addition to their specific contri-
bution of calories to the ‘energy in’ side of the energy
balance equation. These mechanisms could include promot-
ing excess energy consumption, more efficient extraction
of energy from food within the intestine or preferential
partitioning of energy towards fat storage. Evidence ad-
dressing this question was presented and discussed for
long-debated topics such as high carbohydrate (CHO) diets
and non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs). Also, newer, emerg-
ing evidence was presented for the effects of caloric and
NNSs during critical periods of development and for effects

 of the Western diet on reactivity in brain regions associated
with reward and on reshaping gut microbiota. This paper
summarizes the evidence presented for each topic, the areas
of agreement, the topics that require more research and
the nutritional approaches that should be emphasized for
improving public health.
Objective 1: do certain dietary components
increase risk for cardiometabolic disease by
metabolic effects that are not driven solely by
positive energy balance and fat gain?
Dietary fats: Ronald Krauss
A review, published in 1958, on the relationship of dietary
fat to atherosclerotic disease stated:
The evidence now appears to be conclusive that sufficient
quantities of polyunsaturated fat in the diet, with propor-
tional decrease in saturated fat, will result in major de-
crease in blood lipid. Some evidence indicates that such
blood lipid lowering produces a desirable effect upon
existing atherosclerosis (8).
Fast forward to 2014 and there are at least two reviews
on the same topic. One of them concludes that ‘data provide
support for current recommendations to replace saturated
fat with polyunsaturated fat for primary prevention of
coronary heart disease (CHD)’ (9). The other concludes
‘current evidence does not clearly support CVD guidelines
that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty
acids and low consumption of total saturated fats’ (10).
Clearly, both cannot be correct. Therefore, in addition to
reviewing the evidence that supports the conclusion that
dietary fats differ in their weight-independent effects on
cardiometabolic risk, it is also important to consider the
challenges involved in conducting and interpreting nutri-
tional research on the topic of dietary macronutrients.
These challenges have contributed to 60 years of sometimes
inconsistent and conflicting conclusions regarding the role
of dietary fat and other macronutrients in the development
and prevention of cardiometabolic disease.
Macronutrient subtypes
The major macronutrients, particularly fat and CHO,
include
subtypes
that
need
to
be
carefully
controlled/monitored and reported when conducting nutri-
tion studies. This may seem obvious, but the results of many
nutrition studies are challenging to interpret because the
amounts and types of fat or CHO were not monitored
and/or reported. One of the many examples is a study de-
signed to compare the cholesterol-lowering and triglyceride
Figure 1
The potential links between dietary patterns and components and cardiometabolic risk. The totality of the evidence suggests that added sugar
and certain saturated-fat-containing foods increase risk for cardiometabolic disease by metabolic mechanisms that are not mediated solely by positive
energy balance and fat gain. There is also evidence that certain dietary patterns or components can increase ‘energy in’ and/or ‘energy storage as fat’
via mechanisms that are not explained solely by their specific contribution of calories to the ‘energy in’ side of the energy balance equation. The strength
of the links is indicated by the green lines as follows. Solid green line: supported by evidence from animal studies and clinical observational and dietary
intervention studies. Dashed line: evidence from prospective cohort studies and/or clinical dietary intervention studies suggests heightened risk during crit-
ical developmental periods and in persons with compromised glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. Dotted line: supported mainly by evidence from ob-
servational and/or animal studies only. Dotted line w/X: evidence from 100% of the clinical dietary intervention studies do not support the evidence from the
observational and animal studies. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

 (TG)-lowering effects of four fat-restricted diets (30%,
26%, 22% and 18% of energy as fat), achieved via CHO
replacement. The results were reported in the Journal of
the American Medical Association in 1997 without any
description of the type of CHO prescribed or consumed.
The words sugar, simple CHO, sucrose, high-fructose corn
syrup (HFCS) or other key CHO descriptors do not appear
in the article (11). In the case of fats, one must also consider
that beyond the major categories of saturated, monounsatu-
rated, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated, and trans fatty acids,
there is heterogeneity within each group that may contrib-
ute to differing biologic and clinically relevant effects.
Failure to distinguish between macronutrient subtypes,
which has occurred even in recent reports (12), has likely
contributed to conflicting dietary conclusions and to the
‘high fat versus high CHO diet’ debate that still rages today.
Food context
The food context within which macronutrients are con-
sumed can also have a significant impact on CVD risk.
For example, a 10-year cohort study provided evidence that
the consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA) from dairy
foods was associated with decreased risk of CVD, while
consumption of the same amount of SFA from meat (includ-
ing red and processed meat, fish and poultry) was associ-
ated with increased CVD risk (13). Yet, even within the
same food category, differences in formulations or process-
ing can impact health effects. The fermentation of dairy
products provides a notable example. While current evi-
dence does not support an association between intake of
dairy
products
and
risk
of
cardiometabolic
disease,
fermented dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, gener-
ally show inverse associations (14). Indeed, results from
randomized crossover trials show that consumption of
SFA in cheese lowers total and/or low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with consumption of SFA
in butter (15–18). As another example, a meta-analysis of
17 prospective cohorts and three case–control studies indi-
cated that consumption of processed meat was associated
with increased risk of CHD, but consumption of red meat
was not (19).
Meta-analyses
Meta-analyses that combine studies that compared macro-
nutrient A with B and studies that compared A with C or
D or E can lead to misleading conclusions (20). Hooper
et al. (21) illustrated this by pooling randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) comparing SFA with polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs; n-6 fatty acids), monounsaturated fat, CHO
or protein and reporting a 17% reduction in CVD events
with replacement of SFA. However, in separate analyses
with each of the replacement nutrients, replacement of
SFA with n-6 fatty acids yielded a significant 27% reduction
in CVD events. The separate analyses for replacement of
SFA with monounsaturated fat, CHO or protein all showed
non-significant effects on CVD events (21). Differences in
the effects of the replacement nutrients in both RCTs and
observational cohort studies, and the pooling of these
effects, likely help to explain the discrepant results from
studies and meta-analyses investigating the effects of dietary
SFA and other macronutrients on CVD risk (9,10,22–25).
Conclusions drawn from meta-analyses that include inap-
propriate studies can also be misleading. For example, the
2014 meta-analysis (10) that challenged the CVD benefit
of replacing SFA with n-6 fatty acids has been criticized
(26) for including potentially confounded data from the
Sydney Diet Heart Study (27). The Sydney Diet Heart Study
had included margarine with high trans fats in the n-6 fatty
acids supplementation arm. Exclusion of the Sydney Diet
Heart Study resulted in a seven-study meta-analysis with a
relative risk estimate of 0.81 (0.68–0.98), thus supporting
a CVD benefit of replacing SFA with n-6 fatty acids (28).
However, concerns have been raised regarding the rationale
for exclusion of this trial (29), as well as the inclusion of
other trials (the Finnish Mental Hospital (30) and Oslo
Diet-Heart (31) studies) that allowed for the continued con-
sumption of trans fats from margarines in the control arms
of the studies, thus confounding comparisons with the n-6
fatty acid diets (28). Furthermore, during the Oslo Heart
Study, the experimental patients and spouses were taught
in their homes how to select and prepare study foods, while
the control group was not (31). In short, decisions regarding
what studies are appropriate to include or exclude from a
meta-analysis can vary among investigators and contribute
to conflicting conclusions.
Randomized controlled trials with cardiovascular disease
outcomes
Despite the limitations of the Finnish Mental Hospital (30)
and Oslo Diet-Heart (31) studies, both of these RCTs, along
with two others conducted at Wadsworth Hospital and Vet-
erans Administration Center in Los Angeles (32) and by the
British Medical Research Council (33), have been described
as providing the highest-quality evidence available regard-
ing the effects of dietary SFA compared with n-6 fatty acids
(24). The population sizes in these four trials ranged from
400 to 1,200, and maximum diet exposure was 4–8 years,
long enough to obtain CVD outcomes. All four trials mon-
itored blood lipid levels and compliance biomarkers, and
the two longest and largest trials also provided standardized
diets (30,32). These studies were conducted more than
50 years ago, yet they compose the core evidence upon
which a 2017 Presidential Advisory from the American
Heart Association based the following summary: ‘random-
ized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary satu-
rated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable
oil reduced CVD by approximately 30%’ (24). Given the
challenges and escalating costs associated with conducting

 nutritional RCTs with CVD outcomes, these four trials are
likely to remain the highest-quality evidence available
regarding the effects of dietary SFA compared with n-6 fatty
acids (24).
Exemplifying the challenge and the expense of RCTs with
CVD outcomes is the more recent Women’s Health Initia-
tive Dietary Modification Study of ~48,000 women with
an estimated cost of over $400m (34). Women were ran-
domized to receive intensive behaviour modification in
group and individual sessions aimed at reducing total fat
intake to 20% of calories and increasing intake of
vegetables/fruits to five servings per day and grains to at
least six servings per day or to the no-diet-modification
group that received only diet-related education material.
By year 6, the diet-modification group reported a mean in-
crease of 1.1 and 0.5 servings per day of fruit/vegetable
and grain, respectively, and a mean 8% reduction in total
fat energy. This resulted in a group reduction in fat con-
sumption that was less than anticipated (37% of daily en-
ergy down to 28.8%), no significant reduction in CVD
outcomes and only a modest reduction in LDL-C of 3.6%
during the ~8-year intervention (35). It is not possible to
know if the intervention failed to achieve reduction in
CVD outcomes because the fat restriction was focused on
total fat rather than subtype or because the dietary modifi-
cations reported by the participants were too modest or
were overestimations of the dietary changes that actually
occurred.
The
two
latter
limitations,
potential
non-
compliance (36) and inaccurate reporting of food consump-
tion (37) by research participants, are formidable challenges
faced by all nutritional research studies, with the exception
of those conducted in well-monitored inpatient facilities.
In contrast to the Women’s Health Initiative, a recent and
smaller multicentre trial conducted in Spain focused on sub-
types of fat in specific foods (38). Approximately 7,000 par-
ticipants with T2D or three CVD risk factors were
randomized to ad libitum Mediterranean diets supple-
mented either with extra-virgin olive oil (50 mL d�1 pre-
scribed for participants, 1 L week�1 provided for family
needs) or with mixed nuts (30 g d�1 provided for partici-
pants, 1000 g/3 months provided for family needs) or to a
control diet (non-food gifts provided) that was centred
around a Mediterranean diet with advice to reduce dietary
fat. After 4 years, the Mediterranean diets supplemented
with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts resulted in a relative
risk reduction of approximately 30% for major CVD events
(primarily stroke) compared with the control diet (38).
These beneficial results were mainly mediated by consump-
tion of the supplemental extra-virgin olive oil and the nuts,
as there were few diet differences among the groups that
were not due to these foods (38). It is worth noting that
despite receiving supplemental calories in the olive oil
(~9,000 kcal week�1) or nuts (~1,400 kcal week�1), neither
of the experimental groups nor the control group gained
body weight during the trial (group means for Δbody weight
at 4.8 years ranged from �0.9 to �0.4 kg) (39). The authors
suggest that these results provide evidence that restricting
intake of healthy fats is not required for maintenance of
body weight (39).
Biomarkers that can demonstrate causality
Given the high costs and challenges associated with RCTs
with CVD outcomes, the next strongest line of research to
draw on is prospective cohort studies. However, while these
studies increase the feasibility of studying CVD outcomes,
they cannot prove causality and are limited by the inaccura-
cies of self-reported food intake (37) and the challenges
related to identifying and adjusting for relevant covariates.
Evidence of causality must often rely on RCTs in which out-
comes are biomarkers of CVD rather than CVD events.
Among modifiable CVD risk biomarkers, LDL-C and blood
pressure have been the most strongly validated (40), and
they provide the major rationale for therapies aimed at re-
ducing disease risk (28). However, reliance on identifying
dietary macronutrient effects on LDL-C may obscure effects
on LDL particles, especially small dense LDL (sdLDL).
sdLDLs may have more direct and specific effects on the
development and progression of CVD than are predicted
by the LDL-C measurement (41). Increased atherogenicity
of sdLDL may be due in part to a longer residence time in
plasma, which exposes the arterial endothelium to proin-
flammatory and proatherogenic particle components such
as apolipoprotein (apo)CIII (28,41,42). sdLDLs have been
shown to be reduced with lower CHO intake (43). Further,
the prevalence of LDL subclass pattern B, a categorical
marker for atherogenic dyslipidaemia defined by the pre-
dominance of sdLDL, has been linearly and positively asso-
ciated with increasing concentrations of dietary CHO
(consisting of 50% starch and 50% sugar) in RCTs owing
to effects of CHO that can occur in as few as 3 d (43). In
contrast to CHO, dietary SFA in the ranges generally con-
sumed appears to mainly increase larger LDL particles,
which are less strongly associated with risk of CVD (41).
Thus, SFA-induced increases in LDL-C may not signify an
increase in CVD risk commensurate with that predicted
from the relationship of LDL-C to CVD risk in the popula-
tion (41). For example, recent results from the large multi-
national Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study
found a correlation between SFA intake and LDL-C.
However,
simulation
models
indicated
that
LDL-C
provided a poor measure of risk of CVD events and mortal-
ity as opposed to the ratio of serum apolipoprotein (apo)B
(a measure of the total number of atherogenic lipoprotein
particles) to apoAI (the principal high-density lipoprotein
[HDL] protein), a ratio that in turn is associated with
sdLDL levels (44). More studies are needed regarding
whether there are specific pathophysiological properties of
particles within the spectrum of sdLDL that merit the use

 of standardized assays for their measurement as a more in-
formative biomarker of CVD risk than LDL-C (41). An-
other candidate CVD biomarker is apoCIII (28). apoCIII
has been found consistently to be positively associated with
the risk of CVD, likely because of its capacity to retard
plasma clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins (45)
as well as its direct proinflammatory activity (46). Further,
apoCIII in apoB-containing particles is increased with
high-CHO diets (47,48). Given our reliance on the totality
of the scientific evidence (prospective cohort studies: associ-
ation between nutrient and disease outcome + RCTs: direct
effects of nutrient on disease biomarker), valid biomarkers
are essential.
Nutrient substitutions
Any isocaloric change in one macronutrient requires
changes in others, and hence, it is difficult to determine if ef-
fects are caused by the increase in macronutrient A or the
decrease in macronutrient B. Thus, rather than focus on ef-
fects of high versus low consumption of single nutrients on
CVD risk, it is more appropriate to statistically evaluate
the effects of nutrient or, better yet, food substitutions.
The effects of nutrient substitutions for SFA were evaluated
in over 127,500 men and women who were followed for
24–30 years (49). Replacing 5% of energy intake from
SFA with equivalent energy intake from PUFAs, monounsat-
urated fatty acids or CHOs from whole grains was associ-
ated with a 25%, 15%, and 9% lower risk of CHD,
respectively. Replacing SFA with trans fats or CHOs from
refined starches/added sugars was not significantly associ-
ated with CHD risk (49). These results are consistent with
the findings from recent
meta-analyses that are
not
confounded by the challenges discussed above (9,21,24), al-
though the effects of macronutrient heterogeneity and food
context, as discussed above, also require consideration.
The evidence concerning omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs and
cardiometabolic
risk
remains
unclear.
The
consumption/supplementation of n-3 fatty acid is associated
with reduced CVD risk in prospective cohort studies
(10,50), but randomized controlled supplementation trials
have not shown significant beneficial effects (10). Neverthe-
less, a recent Science Advisory from the American Heart
Association (51) stated that treatment with omega-3 PUFA
supplements of patients with prevalent CHD such as a re-
cent myocardial infarction is reasonable as even a potential
modest reduction in CHD mortality (10%) in this clinical
population would justify treatment with a relatively safe
therapy.
Conclusions
Focusing on effects of nutrient substitution rather than high
versus low SFA indicates that replacement of SFA with n-6
fatty acids is associated with lower CVD risk, while replace-
ment of SFA with refined CHOs (starches and sugars) is
associated with a neutral or adverse effect. However, more
research is needed to consider the food and dietary context
in which specific fats are consumed and to develop better
tools to assess dietary patterns. Given the challenges of large
RCTs with CVD disease endpoints, and the limitations of
observational studies, identification and validation
of
additional surrogate biomarkers for RCTs would be of great
value.
Dietary sugars: Kimber Stanhope and Jean-Marc
Schwarz
All the challenges involved with conducting and interpreting
research on dietary fat are also pertinent to the topic of
dietary CHO/sugar. Therefore, similar to dietary fat, recent
reviews (52–58) and meta-analyses (59–65) offer very con-
flicting conclusions concerning the effects of added sugar
on cardiometabolic risk.
Definitions of added sugars and free sugars
As defined by the US Food and Drug Administrations,
added sugars include sugars that are either added during
the processing of foods or are packaged as such and include
sugars (free, monosaccharides and disaccharides), sugars
from syrups and honey and sugars from concentrated fruit
or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be
expected from the same volume of 100% fruit or vegetable
juice of the same type (66). The World Health Organiza-
tion’s definition of free sugars is similar except that it also
includes the sugar naturally present in 100% fruit juices
and fruit juice concentrates (67).
Natural sugars
The sugars naturally present in whole fruit are exempt from
both definitions, and dietary guidelines emphasize the
importance of consuming whole fruits and vegetables.
Prospective cohort studies consistently support this with
evidence that fruit consumption (68–75) or fruit-plus-
vegetable consumption (76–80) is inversely associated with
incidence of CVD and T2D (81). The evidence from RCTs
is inconclusive (82,83), and this is possibly due to the gener-
ally modest changes in fruit and vegetable intake that have
been achieved in these studies (84). While dietary interven-
tion studies comparing the consumption of added sugar to
isocaloric amounts of sugar in whole fruit are lacking, the
results from three RCTs suggest that consumption of natu-
rally sweetened orange juice (85,86) or grape juice (87) de-
creases
risk
factors
compared
with
sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSB). In support of this, there are population
studies that report that incidence/prevalence of metabolic
syndrome (88,89), CVD (90) and T2D (91–93) and their
risk factors (94–96) are associated with consumption of
SSB or fruit juice with added sugar (93), but not with con-
sumption of 100% fruit juice. However, the findings from

 several prospective cohort studies suggest that both 100%
fruit juice and SSB consumption are positively and compa-
rably associated with metabolic syndrome (97) and T2D
(98,99). Therefore, more RCTs comparing SSB and natu-
rally sweetened fruit juice are warranted, as well as RCTs
comparing added sugar with the sugar in whole fruit (82).
Added sugar
Regarding disagreements among meta-analyses concerning
the health effects of added sugar, conclusions differ between
those that compare fructose with any CHO, including
sucrose and HFCS (60,100), and those that compare high
added sugar diets with lower added sugar diets (62).
Meta-analyses that include inappropriate studies also pro-
vide conflicting conclusions. An example of an inappropri-
ate study, included in at least four meta-analyses reporting
little or no detrimental effects of fructose consumption
(61,100–102), is one in which the fructose in the high-
fructose diet (60 g of fructose per day) was not added sugar
but was rather provided by whole fruit (103). Furthermore,
both the high-fructose and low-fructose (20 g of fructose per
day) diets were weight loss diets; thus, subjects in both inter-
ventions lost significant amounts of weight (diet with fruit:
�4.2 ± 0.3 kg; diet without fruit: �2.8 ± 0.3 kg) and, not
unexpectedly, exhibited improvements in cardiometabolic
risk factors (103).
Prospective cohort studies
The recent meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies
investigating consumption of SSB have consistently shown
positive relationships with CVD (59,104,105), T2D (106–
110) and hypertension (59,111). The Nutrition and Chronic
Diseases Expert Group systematically reviewed the evidence
for effects of dietary factors on cardiometabolic diseases, in-
cluding comprehensively assessing evidence for causality
(112). They concluded that evidence from prospective stud-
ies suggests a body mass index (BMI)-independent effect of
SSB on incidence of T2D and CHD and an additional effect
on adiposity (112).
The consumption of added sugar has been less extensively
studied than SSB. In 2014, two large prospective cohort
studies came to differing conclusions concerning the associ-
ation between added sugar consumption and CVD mortal-
ity. Consumption of added sugar was positively associated
with CVD mortality over 15 years in 11,733 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
participants (age 20 and above) (113), but not over 13 years
in
353,751
National
Institutes
of
Health–American
Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and
Health Study participants (age 50–71) (114). In the latter
study (114), fructose in beverage was positively associated
with CVD mortality. Study differences that may have influ-
enced the results include sugar intake: the NHANES partic-
ipants reported a mean baseline level of added sugar
consumption of ~15.7% of daily energy (113), while the
NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study participants reported a
mean baseline level of free sugar consumption of ~9.6% of
daily energy (114). The definition of free sugars for this
study included sugar from dried fruit and applesauce, as
well as from 100% fruit juice (114). A 10-year prospective
study in 2,379 girls (9–10 years at baseline) showed that
consuming <10% of energy as added sugar resulted in in-
creasing concentrations of HDL-C compared with consum-
ing ≥10% of energy as added sugar (115). However, a study
that divided added sugar into sugar added to beverage
(mean intake: 2.6% of daily energy) and sugar added to
solid food (mean intake: 9.4% of daily energy) found that
the development of impaired glucose homeostasis and insu-
lin resistance over 2 years in 8- to 10-year-old children
(n = 564) at risk for obesity was only associated with added
sugar in beverages (116).
Fructose versus glucose
There is evidence and plausible mechanisms to suggest that
there are differences between CHOs with regard to their
effects on cardiometabolic risk factors that mainly involve
the differential metabolism of fructose and glucose. Even
though both pure fructose and pure glucose are generally
not used as added sugars, investigations of their specific
metabolic effects have provided important mechanistic in-
sights into the effects of sucrose and HFCS, the most com-
monly used added sugars that contain both fructose and
glucose. The effects of fructose and glucose were compared
in adults (mean age: 54 years, mean BMI: 29 kg m�2) who
consumed 25% of their energy requirement (Ereq) as
fructose-sweetened or glucose-sweetened
beverages for
10 weeks (117). These subjects resided at the clinical re-
search centre and consumed eucaloric diets consisting of
55% Ereq as complex CHO for 2 weeks while baseline pro-
cedures were conducted. This was followed by an 8-week
outpatient period during which subjects consumed the
fructose-sweetened or glucose-sweetened beverages along
with their usual ad libitum diets. Intervention procedures
were conducted during the last 2 weeks of the study while
subjects resided at the clinical research centre and con-
sumed eucaloric diets consisting of 30% Ereq complex
CHO and 25% Ereq as the assigned beverage. Although
both groups gained comparable amounts of body weight
(~1.5%) and body fat (~3%), there were marked differ-
ences between the effects of the two sugars. Subjects
consuming glucose exhibited markedly higher post-meal
glucose and insulin responses than those consuming fruc-
tose (118). Also, in keeping with the established paradigm
by which positive energy balance promotes the develop-
ment of metabolic syndrome through the increased insulin
resistance and lipolytic activity of enlarged adipocytes
(119) (Fig. 2), subjects consuming glucose exhibited higher
24-h circulating free fatty acids (FFA) (117). In contrast,

 fructose consumption did not affect FFA levels. Yet it
was the subjects consuming fructose who exhibited in-
creased de novo lipogenesis (DNL), reduced fat oxidation,
increased circulating
TG (postprandial only), LDL-C,
sdLDL-C, oxidized LDL, apoB, apoCIII and uric acid and
decreased insulin sensitivity (117,120,121). The essential
mechanistic feature that explains these results is that the
hepatic uptake and metabolism of glucose is regulated by
hepatic energy status, which allows glucose to bypass the
energy-replete liver and raise post-meal blood glucose and
insulin levels. In contrast, the hepatic uptake and metabo-
lism of fructose is unregulated (122,123); thus, excessive
fructose consumption results in a hepatic substrate over-
load that increases uric acid production (121,123–125)
and up-regulates DNL (117,126,127). As illustrated in
Fig. 3, the major downstream effects include inhibition of
fat oxidation (120,127), increased liver lipid content
(127–129), up-regulated secretion of large very-low-density
lipoproteins 1 (130), dyslipidaemia (131) and hepatic insu-
lin resistance (132,133). Increased inflammation induced
by increases in visceral fat (117,128) or fructose exposure
in the intestine (134,135) or liver (136) may also mediate
or enhance metabolic dys-regulation.
High fructose corn syrup versus fructose and glucose
The results from the 10-week intervention comparing fruc-
tose and glucose (117) suggest that the hepatic substrate
overload induced by excessive consumption of fructose
(Fig. 3) is a more rapid pathway to metabolic dys-regulation
than
the
increased
FFA
(Fig.
2)
and
post-meal
hyperglycaemia/hyperinsulinaemia induced by excessive
consumption of glucose. These studies also suggest that be-
cause the commonly consumed sugars HFCS and sucrose
contain 50–55% fructose, their overconsumption would
have less detrimental effects on risk factors than isocaloric
amounts of pure fructose. Data from a 2-week dietary inter-
vention study (125,137), in which adults (mean age:
26 years, mean BMI: 25 kg m�2) consumed beverages con-
taining 25% Ereq as fructose, glucose or HFCS along with
their usual ad libitum diet, showed that circulating post-
prandial TG, apoCIII and uric acid concentrations were
highest
during
fructose
consumption
(Δbody
weight:
�0.1 kg), lowest during glucose consumption (Δbody
weight: 0.4 kg) and intermediate during HFCS consumption
(Δbody weight: 0.4 kg) (137). However, surprisingly, this
was not the pattern for fasting and postprandial concentra-
tions of LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apoB. The levels of these
CVD risk factors were highest after HFCS consumption,
lowest after glucose consumption and intermediate after
fructose consumption (137), suggesting potentially synergis-
tic effects of fructose and glucose consumption on these
measures when the two sugars are consumed concurrently.

(125,137),
adults
(mean

BMI:
26 kg m�2) consuming beverages containing 0% (aspar-

dependent increases of fasting and postprandial non-HDL-
Figure 2
Established paradigm by which positive energy balance promotes the development of the metabolic syndrome. Positive energy balance leads
to fat accumulation and larger and more insulin-resistant adipocytes (a). The insulin resistance increases lipolytic activity and circulating free fatty acids
(FFA) (b). While lipolytic activity is higher in visceral adipose tissue than subcutaneous adipose, upper body subcutaneous adipose is a major contributor
to the increased levels of FFA (328,329). High levels of FFA can mediate muscle (c) (330) and liver (d) (331) insulin resistance. Hepatic uptake of FFA leads
to increased liver lipid (e), which is associated with liver insulin resistance (f) (332) and promotes very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production/secretion
(g) and dyslipidaemia (h) (328,333). Increased exposure to circulating triglyceride promotes intramyocellular lipid accumulation (i) (334), which is associ-
ated with insulin resistance (j) and type 2 diabetes (332). Inflammatory factors released by insulin-resistant visceral adipose tissue (k) may also promote
hepatic insulin resistance (l) and lipid accumulation (m) (119). [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

 C, LDL-C, apoB and uric acid and postprandial apoCIII
and TG concentrations (all P < 0.001) (125). HFCS con-
sumption also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in body
weight (Δbody weight: 0%, �0.1 kg; 10%, 0.0 kg; 17.5%,
0.3 kg; 25%, 0.8; P < 0.05); however, in adjusted statistical
models, the variance attributed to Δbody weight was 1–3%
and the variance attributed to HFCS dose was 9–29%
(125). These results are in contrast to those from a study
in which adults consuming beverages containing 8%, 18%
or 30% Ereq as sucrose or HFCS with usual ad libitum diets
for 10 weeks exhibited no differences in cholesterol and
LDL-C (138) or 24-h uric acid and TG area under the curve
(139) between doses. As previously discussed in detail
(58,125), possible explanations for the conflicting results in-
clude differences in the statistical analyses employed, use of
three cups per day of low-fat milk as a vehicle for the sugars,
lack of a vehicle control group and lack of an objective mea-
sure of compliance in the 10-week study (138,139).
Sucrose
Data from several older studies suggest that consumption of
sucrose also increases total and/or LDL-C (140–144) or
postprandial TG (142,145). More recently, men (mean
age: 26 years, mean BMI: 22 kg m�2) consuming beverages
containing either 80 g d�1 sucrose or fructose with their
usual ad libitum diets for 3 weeks had higher concentrations
of total and LDL-C and reduced LDL particle size than
when they consumed beverages containing 80 g of glucose
(146,147). This study also showed that the fructose-
sweetened beverages decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity
compared with the glucose-sweetened beverages, even
though body weight, body fat and waist circumference were
reduced after fructose consumption compared with glucose
consumption (146). In the longest of the recent intervention
trials, liver fat, and fasting TG, total cholesterol and uric
acid concentrations were increased in adults (mean age:
39 years, mean BMI: 32 kg m�2) consuming 1 L of
Figure 3
Potential mechanisms by which consumption of fructose promotes the development of metabolic syndrome The initial phosphorylation of dietary
fructose in the liver is largely catalysed by fructokinase C (a), which is not regulated by hepatic energy status (122,123). This results in unregulated fructose
uptake and metabolism by the liver. The excess substrate leads to increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL) (b) (117,127). DNL increases the intra-hepatic
lipid supply directly (127–129), via synthesis of fatty acids (c), and indirectly by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation (d) (120,127). Increased intra-hepatic lipid
content promotes very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and secretion (e) (130). This leads to increased levels of circulating triglyceride (TG)
and low-density lipoprotein particles (dyslipidaemia) (f) (131), risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (g). Increased levels of hepatic lipid may also
promote hepatic insulin resistance (132) by increasing levels of diacylglycerol, which may activate novel protein kinase C and lead to serine phosphory-
lation (serine P) of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 and impaired insulin action (h) (335). Because of selective insulin resistance, DNL is
even more strongly activated in the insulin resistant liver (i) (336), which has the potential to generate a vicious cycle (circular arrows) that would be per-
petuated by sustained fructose consumption. This cycle would be expected to further exacerbate VLDL production and secretion via increased intra-
hepatic lipid supply (130). Hepatic insulin resistance also promotes VLDL production/secretion (j) by increasing apolipoprotein B availability (337,338)
and apolipoprotein CIII synthesis (339) and by up-regulating microsomal TG transfer protein expression (MTP) (336). This exacerbates and sustains expo-
sure to circulating TG, leading to intramyocellular lipid accumulation (k) (334), impaired insulin signalling and whole-body insulin resistance (l) (332). The
fructokinase-catalysed phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, which results in conversion of adenosine triphosphate to adenosine
monophosphate and a depletion of inorganic phosphate, leads to uric acid production via the purine degradation pathway (m) (121,123–125). High levels
of uric acid are associated and may contribute to increased risk for development of fatty liver (n) and CVD (o) (340–342). Fructose exposure in the intestine
(p) (134,135) and liver (q) (136) and fructose-induced increases of visceral adipose (r) may promote inflammatory responses (117,343) that further promote
liver lipid accumulation (s) and/or impair hepatic insulin signalling (t) (119). [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

 sucrose-sweetened cola per day with their usual ad libitum
diets for 6 months compared with subjects consuming isoca-
loric amounts of low-fat milk or 1 L of aspartame-
sweetened cola or water per day (124,128). The changes
in body weight ranged from +0.1 (aspartame) to +1.4%
(low-fat milk) and did not differ among the four diet groups
(P = 0.8) (128). A 2-week study that concurrently investi-
gated consumption of 25% Ereq as sucrose-sweetened
(Δbody weight: 0.5 kg) or HFCS-sweetened beverages
(Δbody weight: 0.8 kg) with ad libitum diets in adults (mean
age: 26 years, mean BMI: 25 kg m�2) showed that the
effects of the two added sugars on LDL-C, apoB, apoCIII,
uric acid and postprandial TG were comparable (148).
Sucrose versus starch
There appears to be only one study that has investigated the
effects of replacing starch with sucrose in solid food, as op-
posed to SSB, at levels less than 30% Ereq. Twenty-four
women and men with hyperinsulinaemia (mean age:
36 years, mean BMI: 25 kg m�2) consumed three eucaloric
(42% Ereq fat, 14% protein and 44% CHO), crossover di-
ets in which the 44% CHO component was provided as
39% starch + 5% sucrose, 26% starch + 18% sucrose or
11% starch + 33% sucrose in solid form for 6 weeks each.
Fasting lipids (143), glucose and insulin concentrations,
and the glucose and insulin responses to an oral sucrose tol-
erance test (149) were increased when subjects consumed
the 18% and 33% Ereq sucrose diets compared with the
higher starch diet containing only 5% Ereq sucrose
(143,149). More studies are needed to compare the meta-
bolic effects of sugar consumed in solid and liquid forms
with
both
refined
and
whole-grain
CHO
in
normoinsulinaemic individuals consuming isocaloric diets.
Weight-independent effect of fructose/sugar
All of the studies detailed above, with the exception of the
investigation
on
solid-form
sucrose
versus
starch
(143,149), provided the intervention sugar as supplements
to the participants’ usual ad libitum diets. While the modest
weight gains suggest that most of the subjects partially com-
pensated for the sugar supplements by consuming less of
their usual diet, there is still the potential for confounding
by excess energy consumption and weight gain. However,
studies with dietary protocols that included the provision
of eucaloric diets with matched macronutrient distribution
between the high-sugar and low-sugar diets have demon-
strated that fructose and sucrose consumption can increase
risk factors in the absence of positive energy balance and
weight gain (127,140,143–145,149–158). These studies in-
clude a recent crossover study that provided evidence that
all the major effects of fructose overload, detailed in Fig. 3,
can occur in the absence of positive energy balance and
weight gain. Eight men (mean age: 42 years, mean BMI:
24 kg m�2) resided at a clinical research centre and
consumed eucaloric diets in which the CHO component
consisted of 25% Ereq fructose-sweetened beverage + 25%
complex CHO or 50% Ereq complex CHO for 9 d each
(127). Despite weight maintenance, this short-term expo-
sure
to
fructose-sweetened
beverage
increased
DNL,
inhibited fat oxidation, increased liver fat and postprandial
plasma TG concentrations and decreased hepatic insulin
sensitivity compared with the complex CHO diet. Each of
these effects was observed in all eight participants, with
the exception that postprandial TG was not increased in
one individual (127). It is important to note, however, that
these results could have been affected by both the differ-
ences between fructose and complex CHO and the differ-
ences between beverage and solid food. However, in a
much older study, Hallfrisch et al. compared the isocaloric
substitution of starch with 0%, 7.5% or 15% Ereq as fruc-
tose in solid food, utilizing eucaloric crossover diets that
were provided for 5 weeks each to 12 hyperinsulinaemic
and 12 normoinsulinaemic men (mean age: 40 years, mean
BMI: 26 kg m�2). Compared with the 0% fructose diet,
the 7.5% and 15% fructose diets increased total cholesterol
and LDL-C (154) and the 15% fructose diet increased glu-
cose and insulin responses to a 3-h oral sucrose tolerance
test in both groups of subjects (153). More recently, a study
that provided eucaloric diets including 25% Ereq as
fructose-sweetened (n = 15) or glucose-sweetened beverages
(n = 17) for 2 weeks to men (mean age: 34 years, mean BMI:
29 kg m�2) did not reveal differences in liver fat, but fasting
uric acid concentrations and homeostatic model assessment
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were increased by fructose
compared with glucose consumption (155). Similar results
were reported from a crossover study in which men (mean
age: 46 years, mean BMI: 32 kg m�2) were provided
eucaloric low-sucrose (sucrose 5.2%, total sugar 17.1% of
daily calories) or high-sucrose (sucrose 14.9%, total sugar
30.2% of daily calories – details about non-sucrose sugar
are not provided) diets for 6 weeks (156). While there were
no differences in peripheral glucose utilization and suppres-
sion of endogenous glucose production during a two-step
hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, fasting and oral glu-
cose tolerance test areas under the curve were higher for
both glucose and insulin after the high-sucrose versus low-
sucrose diet (156).
Sugar restriction
In a study designed to demonstrate weight-independent ef-
fects of fructose restriction to reverse the adverse metabolic
effects of excessive fructose consumption, eucaloric diets
were provided for home consumption to 43 Latino and
African–American adolescents (mean age: 13 years) with
metabolic syndrome for 9 d (159). The diets contained
10% Ereq as added sugar, considerably less than the aver-
age of 27% Ereq recorded for the participants’ usual diets
(159). In response to the lower-sugar diets, the adolescents

 exhibited numerous benefits including reductions of liver
fat, visceral adipose tissue and DNL (160), plasma lipids
and lipoproteins (161), glucose and insulin excursions dur-
ing oral glucose tolerance test and diastolic blood pressure
(159). Body fat was not affected (�0.3 kg, P = 0.17), but
body
weight
was
significantly
decreased
(�0.9
kg,
P < 0.01). Despite efforts by the investigators to promote
body weight maintenance by providing more food, body
scales for daily weight monitoring at home, and individual-
ized weight maintenance counselling, 34 of the 43 partici-
pants exhibited a decrease in body weight (159). This
confounds assessment of the direct metabolic effects of fruc-
tose restriction as opposed to those mediated by negative
energy balance and weight loss. However, the subgroup of
nine subjects who did not lose weight also had statistically
significant reductions in most of the outcomes (DNL, liver
fat, visceral adipose tissue, fasting glucose, insulin and
HOMA-IR) (159–161).
Two more recent studies demonstrate benefits of sugar re-
striction in children with obesity (162,163). In response to a
6-week dietary intervention consisting of advice to reduce
fructose consumption from a usual intake >70 to <20 g d�1,
54 children (age range: 6–11 years) exhibited significant de-
creases in liver fat and fasting TG, but no changes in body
weight or BMI (162). A 6-month dietary intervention
consisting of advice to reduce consumption of fructose and
high glycaemic index foods resulted in lowered systolic
blood
pressure,
alanine
aminotransferase,
apoB
and
HOMA-IR in 12 children (age range: 7–18 years) with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (163). An impor-
tant limitation of all three of these studies (159,162,163) is
they did not include control groups. However, in a recent
RCT, adults (mean BMI: 31 kg m�2), whose normal diets
contained ~94 g of sugar per day from SSB, were random-
ized to receive and consume their usual quantity of beverage
sweetened with sucrose (n = 14) or with an NNS (n = 13) for
12 weeks (164). The group consuming NNS exhibited
significant decreases in liver fat compared with the group
who continued to consume SSB (87.9 g sugar from SSB
consumed per day at 12 weeks) (164). However, while the
changes in body weight were not significant, the NNS group
lost ~1.4 kg and the SSB group gained ~1 kg. More ade-
quately powered RCTs are required to delineate the
weight-independent and weight-dependent effects of sugar
restriction.
Conclusions
Consumption of fructose-sweetened, HFCS-sweetened or
sucrose-sweetened beverages leads to greater increases in
risk factors for cardiometabolic disease than isocaloric
amounts of starch. More studies comparing the metabolic
effects of SSB with those of added sugar in solid food and
comparing added sugar in solid foods with both refined
and whole-grain complex CHO are required. The metabolic
dys-regulation
induced
by
excessive
consumption
of
fructose-containing sugar is mainly caused by hepatic fruc-
tose overload increasing DNL, which leads to inhibited fat
oxidation, increased liver fat and increased very-low-density
lipoprotein production/secretion. Risk factors associated
with metabolic dys-regulation increase even when fructose-
containing sugars are consumed with diets that do not result
in positive energy intake and weight gain.
Objective 2: do certain dietary patterns or
components have the potential to promote fat
gain via mechanisms that are in addition to their
specific contribution of calories to the ‘energy in’
side of the energy balance equation?

The high-carbohydrate versus high-fat diet debate
The potential to promote fat gain via mechanisms that are
in addition to caloric content has been attributed to both
high-CHO and high-fat diets. Thirty years ago, the consen-
sus was that a high-fat diet promotes greater fat gain than a
high-CHO diet because dietary fat is converted to body fat
much more efficiently than dietary CHO (165). At that
time, clinical studies showed that the body does not handle
fat ingestion in the same way as CHO or protein ingestion.
More specifically, (a) unlike CHO ingestion, which stimu-
lates CHO oxidation and even DNL in extreme cases (166),
the ingestion of dietary fat is not reciprocated by an increase
in fat oxidation (167–169); (b) similarly, under eucaloric
conditions, replacement of CHO by fat in the diet takes sev-
eral days or weeks to stimulate fat oxidation, even in the
presence of increased physical activity (169–172); (c) the
thermic effect of dietary fat is lower than that from CHO
or protein (173–175); (d) because of the higher energy den-
sity of fat and its low satiating effect, fat ingestion leads to
food overconsumption (176,177). Together, these results
strongly suggested that dietary fat was a key culprit in the
western diet leading to enhanced storage of body fat
(178). All these studies lead to the development of the ‘Flatt
hypothesis’, which proposes that unlike CHO and protein,
excess fat intake is not rapidly buffered by increased fat ox-
idation but requires a significant amount of weight gain to
re-establish a new fat balance (179). At this new weight
and body composition, the amount of CHO, fat and protein
oxidized will match the amount of CHO, fat and protein
consumed (i.e. respiratory quotient = food quotient) and
weight can be maintained (179).
The consensus that dietary fat is the specific culprit in the
obesity crises has waned with the perception that while
Americans decreased their intake of dietary fat, the rates
of overweight and obesity have risen (180). Whether this

 occurred because dietary fat does not promote fat gain more
efficiently than CHO or because Americans did not achieve
substantial reductions in fat intake or because their fat calo-
ries were replaced by even more calories of low-fat/high-
CHO/high-sugar foods is not known. However, it increased
focus on the possibility that a high-CHO diet has the
potential to increase fat gain by affecting both sides of the
energy balance equation. Specifically, when meals with a
high proportion of glucose-containing CHOs are con-
sumed, higher post-meal glucose excursions lead to larger
meal-associated insulin excursions than when isocaloric
high-fat/low-CHO meals are consumed (181). This physio-
logic hyperinsulinaemia has the potential to promote fat
gain by driving glucose and FFA into storage forms, which
also decreases the availability of circulating metabolic fuels
and promotes hunger (182).
Energy-restricted weight loss diets
This mechanism serves as the rationale for many popular
high-fat weight loss diets. However, it is not supported by
a recent 14-day inpatient metabolic balance study examin-
ing the effect of selective isocaloric reduction of dietary
CHO versus fat on body weight, energy expenditure and
fat balance in 19 volunteers with obesity. The results
showed that calorie for calorie, the high-CHO weight loss
diet led to greater body fat loss than the high-fat diet,
despite the fact it was the high-fat diet that led to decreased
insulin secretion (183). A 2014 meta-analysis of 19 RCTs
lasting 3 months to 2 years with ~3,200 participants
showed no significant differences in loss of body weight be-
tween participants assigned to consume low-CHO weight
loss diets compared with those assigned to consume isocalo-
ric higher-CHO (45–65% of energy) weight loss diets (184).
A second meta-analysis also indicated there was no signifi-
cant difference in weight loss between low-fat and high-fat
weight loss interventions when the interventions were con-
cordant for caloric restriction (185). Furthermore, an RCT
with a 2 × 2 factorial design comparing four energy-
restricted diets with low or high amounts of protein (10%
or 20% of energy) and low or normal amounts of CHO
(25% or 50% of energy) showed that weight loss after the
12-month intervention was unaffected by CHO content
but significantly greater on the high protein diets (186). A
recent 12-month weight loss diet study showed comparable
weight reduction in subjects consuming a healthy low-fat
diet (�5.3 kg) vs. a healthy low-CHO diet (�6.0 kg). Nota-
bly, the dietary instructions for both diet groups included
the following: (1) maximize vegetable intake; (2) minimize
intake of added sugars, refined flours and trans fats; and
(3) focus on whole foods that were minimally processed, nu-
trient dense and prepared at home whenever possible (187).
Collectively, these results suggest that hypocaloric high-

Ad libitum diets
However, because the majority of people do not spend the
majority of their time consuming hypocaloric diets, far
more important to the obesity epidemic is the question of
whether high-CHO/lower-fat diets promote fat gain com-
pared with low-CHO/higher-fat diets when consumed ad
libitum (188). In the ad libitum condition, a differential ef-
fect between the two diets to promote weight gain could
be mediated by mechanisms related to satiety and energy in-
take, as well as by differences in their potential to promote
fat storage versus fat oxidation. Results from a meta-
analysis of 16 studies suggest high-CHO/lower-fat diets do
not cause more weight gain than low-CHO/high-fat diets.
Instead it was concluded that a reduction in dietary fat to
27% of energy without intentional restriction of energy
intake caused weight loss compared with control diets con-
taining 37% of energy as fat (and less CHO) in subjects
without obesity (189). A more recent meta-analysis of 30
RCTs comparing participants consuming ad libitum lower-
fat versus usual or moderate-fat diets also showed a consis-
tent but small effect of low-fat intake to reduce body fat
and/or weight (190). However, the majority of the studies
included in both of these meta-analyses provided the partic-
ipants with dietary guidelines rather than diets, and the die-
tary instructions and counselling time spent with the groups
consuming the fat-restricted diets were considerably more
extensive than those provided to the groups consuming the
higher-fat control diets. A separate analysis with five trials
that did equalize attention between both diets groups
showed there was still significantly more weight loss in the
groups consuming the lower-fat diets (190).
Another recent meta-analysis does not support this con-
clusion (185). This 17-trial meta-analysis excluded trials
shorter than 1 year because initial, maximal weight loss af-
ter approximately 6 months is often followed by weight re-
gain (185). It showed that the weight loss exhibited by the
low-fat groups was specific to comparisons with groups
consuming ‘usual diet’ and receiving less attention in the
form of dietary instruction and/or counselling. Only four
of the included trials provided comparable attention to both
the low-fat and higher-fat diet groups, and two showed
greater weight loss with the low-fat diet while the other
two did not. Therefore, the authors of this meta-analysis
concluded that evidence from RCTs does not support low-
fat diets over other dietary interventions for beneficial
effects on energy balance (185).
Thus, the effects of high-CHO/lower-fat diets compared
with low-CHO/higher-fat diets on energy balance continues
to be a subject of controversy owing to the lack of well-
controlled studies of sufficient duration. The challenges
involved in filling this gap do not consist of just ensuring

 that the attention provided to the intervention and control
groups are equal. Study participants often fail to meet the
goals of their dietary assignments, especially in the later
months of the intervention period, even when equal, and
even very intensive (191), dietary instructions and counsel-
ling are provided (191,192). This suggests that the better
way to compare the effects of ad libitum high-CHO/low-
fat diets with low-CHO/high-fat diets on energy intake
and body weight gain is to provide the participants with am-
ple food and meals formulated to the specification of the
assigned diet and prohibit the consumption of any other
foods. This is an expensive protocol that will still be limited
by potential non-compliance (36) and failure to report the
non-compliance (37). Future technological advances may
address the compliance and reporting limitations with, for
example, wearable food intake monitoring devices (193).
However, even if/when perfect compliance and accurate
reporting are achieved, there still remains the possibility that
provided study diets lead to reductions in ad libitum energy
intake because of monotony and curtailment of freedom of
dietary choice, rather than to the specific dietary manipula-
tions. Unintended weight loss, which could have been re-
lated to the lack of dietary choice rather than dietary
composition, confounded the results of a recent crossover
study that provided subjects with high-CHO meals for
4 weeks and then very-low-CHO meals for 4 weeks (194).
The lack of freedom of choice is also a potential confounder
for long-term inpatient protocols, especially ones in which
the change of energy intake is the primary outcome. Restric-
tions related to dietary freedom can reduce energy intake,
but inpatient confinement can lead to boredom and/or de-
pression and increase energy intake.
Possibly, the protocol that best minimizes the monotony
and the freedom of dietary choice issues for studies investi-
gating effects of ad libitum diets on energy intake and body
weight gain is the ‘shop’ model utilized in studies conducted
in Europe for 6-month interventions (195). This protocol
provides free foods that are appropriate to the formulations
of the assigned experimental diets in a grocery shop setting.
At the check-out stand, the foods selected by the partici-
pants are scanned to ensure that the selections in total meet
the specifications for the assigned diet and provide at least
100% of daily Ereq. The uneaten foods are returned and
re-scanned for calculation of energy and nutrient intake.
The feasibility of utilizing this protocol for 1-year interven-
tions is limited by the expense.
In addition to controlling the potential effects that re-
stricted dietary choice and monotony may have on energy
intake, the optimal protocol for comparing the effect of
high-CHO versus high-fat diets on weight gain must also
control for other dietary components that can affect satiety
and energy intake. This includes protein, which has been
shown to dose-dependently increase postprandial fullness,
decrease
postprandial
hunger
and
affect
homeostatic
hormones involved in the regulation of energy intake
(196). There is also evidence to suggest that a high-protein
diet reduces reward-driven eating behaviour (197,198).
Fibre also affects satiety (199) by mechanisms that may in-
clude energy density, decreasing and slowing nutrient
absorption from the intestine or triggering signals related
to fullness by causing water absorption and distention in
the stomach (200). Because whole grains contain more fibre
and have a lower energy density than refined grain, it is not
surprising that most short-term studies suggest they pro-
mote greater satiety (201). It also then would not be surpris-
ing if a study comparing a high-fat diet with a high-CHO
diet with whole grains yielded different results than a study
comparing a high-fat diet with a high-CHO diet with
refined grains. The type of fat to be studied may also affect
results as there is evidence to suggest that n-3 fatty acids
increase satiety (202).
Thus, the challenges involved in resolving the high-CHO
versus high-fat diet debate are immense. Research effort and
funds may be better directed to determining the optimal ad
libitum diet for promoting satiety and reduced energy in-
take. This was recently undertaken by Arguin et al. (200)
who compared an ad libitum diet consisting of food compo-
nents (protein > 20% of energy, whole grain, whole fruit
and
vegetable,
n-3
fatty
acids,
chilli
peppers
with
capsaicinoids (203) and calcium (204)) known to have
satiety-enhancing properties (e.g. low-energy density and fi-
bre) with an ad libitum control diet based the Canadian
Food Guide for Healthy Eating for 16 weeks. Fat mass
was significantly decreased, and the satiety quotient for
hunger, fullness and prospective food consumption was sig-
nificantly increased in male participants who consumed the
diet with the satiety-enhancing food components compared
with those who consumed the control diet. However, an im-
portant limitation of the dietary protocol that may have
affected subject retention rates (satiety diet: 91.4%; control
diet: 55.9%) and study results was the provision of one pre-
prepared meal per day to the high-satiety diet group, but
none to the control diet group (200). Nevertheless, the ad-
vantages of changing focus from diets designed around
macronutrient groups to diets designed around high-
nutrient, satiating food components that have the palatabil-
ity to compete with low-nutrient, energy-dense processed
foods warrant exploration.
Preventing weight regain in weight-reduced subjects
Another area that warrants more focus is how to prevent
weight regain in subjects who have lost weight on energy-
restricted diets. Numerous studies show that the energy
homeostatic systems regulating energy intake, energy ex-
penditure, neuroendocrine function and autonomic func-
tion in weight-reduced subjects conspire to oppose reduced
weight maintenance (205–208), in individuals with or
without obesity (207). These adaptations, rather than the

 comparative efficacy of various weight-loss diets or treat-
ments, are responsible for the depressingly unsuccessful
clinical attempts to reverse the obese or overweight states.
Investigations focusing on the leptin signalling pathways
may have the most potential to yield strategies to prevent
weight regain. Leptin administration, which has little effect
on subjects at their usual body weight or on subjects con-
suming energy-restricted diets, has been shown to, at least
partially, reverse many of the metabolic, autonomic, neuro-
endocrine and behavioural adaptations that lead to weight
regain in weight-reduced subjects (209).
The weight regain period following hypocaloric diets may
represent a specific scenario during which an ad libitum
high-CHO diet does promote more weight gain than a
low-CHO diet. A recent study showed that weight loss
was not different in men consuming low-calorie diets con-
taining either a high glycaemic load (65% of energy as
CHO with a high glycaemic index) or lower glycaemic load
(50% of energy as CHO with a low glycaemic index) (210),
in agreement with the conclusions from the meta-analyses
cited above (184,185). However, during the follow-up
3-week overfeeding period, the same men consuming
150% Ereq as the high-CHO/high-glycaemic-load diet
gained 1 kg more body weight than the men consuming
150%
Ereq
as
the
low-CHO/low-glycaemic-load
diet
(210). Fat regain among all subjects was inversely associ-
ated with fasting fat oxidation (210). Two other investiga-
tions in weight-reduced subjects provide evidence that
high-CHO/high-glycaemic-load
diets
promote
greater
weight regain (211) or lower energy expenditure (212) than
lower-CHO/lower-glycaemic-load diets.
Energy restriction and weight reduction are associated
with improved insulin sensitivity (213,214). However,
with cessation of energy restriction, it may be possible
that the augmented insulin secretion caused by high-
glycaemic-load diets selectively impairs insulin sensitivity
in muscle while maintaining it in white adipose tissue,
thus resulting in lowered fat oxidation and increased
fat storage. This mechanism, lowered muscle insulin
sensitivity and increased adipose sensitivity, has been well
documented in rodents exposed to hyperinsulinaemia
(215–217), including in a rat model of weight recovery
(218). Conversely, it was demonstrated that mice lacking
insulin receptors in adipose tissue had normal whole-body
glucose metabolism, but the insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake in their adipocytes was reduced by 90%. This
resulted in mice with reduced adipose tissue mass and in-
creased longevity (219,220).
Other conditions associated with positive energy balance
and lowered insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle relative to
adipose tissue could also lead to a disproportional gain in
fat mass in response to a high-glycaemic-load diet. One
example may be physical inactivity, which specifically
lowers muscle insulin sensitivity (221). In support of this,
young healthy men displayed lowered whole-body glucose
utilization during a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp
after 10 d of bed rest than before bed rest (222). This sug-
gests decreased insulin sensitivity primarily in their skeletal
muscle. In contrast, the glucose uptake in their subcutane-
ous abdominal adipose tissue was increased after bed rest
(222). Lowered insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle relative
to adipose tissue may also occur in metabolically healthy
obesity (223), a transient state (224) that may be explained
by high adipose insulin sensitivity promoting adipose
expansion over ectopic lipid deposition (225).
Conclusions
At comparable levels of energy restriction, high-CHO/low-
fat weight loss diets do not impede fat loss compared with
low-CHO/high-fat diets. More well-controlled trials lasting
at least 1 year are needed to determine the effects of ad
libitum high-CHO/low-fat diets compared with ad libitum
low-CHO/high-fat
diets on energy balance. Emerging
evidence suggests that, following weight loss on energy-
restricted diets, ad libitum consumption of a high-CHO/
high-glycaemic-load diet may, via increased insulin expo-
sure, decrease insulin sensitivity in muscle and increase insu-
lin sensitivity in adipose, thus increasing susceptibility to
weight regain. More clinical studies are needed to test this
hypothesis, but also to investigate other strategies that
may affect weight regain following otherwise successful
non-surgical weight loss.
High-carbohydrate/high-glycaemic-load diet and
metabolic status: Arne Astrup
A recent publication provides evidence to suggest that sus-
ceptibility to weight gain on a high-CHO diet may be influ-
enced by the metabolic status of the individual (226). The
investigators reanalysed data from three dietary interven-
tion studies in which diets that differed in CHO content
(227,228) or glycaemic load (192) were compared for their
effects on weight loss or weight regain. The reported effects
of diet group on body weight in the total population of indi-
viduals with obesity were quite small (weight-reduced sub-
jects on low-glycaemic-load diet regained 1.9 kg less than
those on the high-glycaemic-load diet over 6 months
(192)) or undetectable (227,228). However, when the sub-
jects were divided into subgroups based on their baseline
fasting glucose and insulin levels, consistent and more pro-
nounced effects of the different diets were detected (226).
In all three studies, participants with high baseline fasting
glucose and low fasting insulin exhibited a greater loss of
body weight on the diets with a low CHO content or
glycaemic load than participants with the same glucose
and insulin profile on diets with higher CHO content
(Fig. 4A) or glycaemic load (Fig. 4B). These analyses suggest
that insulin-resistant obese individuals, with a low capacity

 to increase insulin secretion and overcome the resistance,
achieve more satiety and weight loss on lower-CHO/
lower-glycaemic-load diets.
In another study, 90 participants who consumed the New
Nordic Diet (more calories from local and wild countryside
plant foods, more seafood and seaweed from local seas and
lakes and fewer calories from meat (229)) for 6 months lost
3 kg more body weight than 56 participants who consumed
the average Danish diet (230). Subsequent analysis showed
that participants with high fasting glucose/low fasting insu-
lin lost 6 kg more body weight consuming the New Nordic
Diet than participants with the same glucose and insulin
profile consuming the average Danish diet (226). It is im-
portant to note that food records suggest that the two
groups consumed comparable amounts of available CHO,
but the New Nordic diet group consumed 15 g d�1 more fi-
bre (230) and more whole grain. This suggests that the
glycaemic index/load (not assessed in the study, but likely
lower in the New Nordic diet due to the fibre and whole
grain) rather than CHO content is involved in the body
weight differences between the participants with high
fasting glucose/low fasting insulin on the two diets. How-
ever, a recent report from the study investigators also sug-
gests an influence of gut microbiota on diet response
(231). Faecal samples were collected from a subgroup of
the subjects before starting the New Nordic or average
Danish diets, and the ratio of the relative abundance of
Prevotella spp. to Bacteroides spp. (P/B) was determined.
Previous reports have identified Prevotella and Bacteroides
as two typical bacterial clusters present in humans (232),
with the relative abundance of Prevotella associated posi-
tively with host diet (vegetarian and fibre) (233,234) and
negatively with cardiometabolic risk factors (234). Among
individuals with a high P/B ratio, the New Nordic Diet
resulted in a 3.2 kg larger body fat loss compared with the
average Danish diet, while no difference in body fat loss
was observed between the Nordic diet and average Danish
diet among individuals with low P/B. Among individuals
on the New Nordic diet, those with a high P/B ratio lost sig-
nificantly more body fat than those with a low P/B ratio,
while body fat loss was not different between high-P/B and
low-P/B groups consuming the average Danish diet (231).
Recently, dietary-fibre-induced improvements in postpran-
dial blood glucose and insulin were found to be positively
associated with the abundance of Prevotella (235). There-
fore, the importance of baseline fasting glucose and insulin
(i.e. insulin sensitivity) for diet response with regard to
weight loss may be linked to gut microbiota and dietary
fibre content (231).
Grouping subjects by a combination of fasting glucose
and fasting insulin was found to be superior to other vari-
ous indices of insulin resistance, such as the 30-min re-
sponse to a glucose dose, for detecting group-by-diet
interactions. A good prediction is also achieved when using
fasting glucose alone. Patients with T2D or with three or
more CVD risk factors were assigned to consume a low-
fat Mediterranean diet or a Mediterranean diet with extra-
virgin olive oil, and after 5 years, the weight loss difference
between the two diet groups was less than 0.5 kg (39).
However, when regrouped by fasting glucose, the subjects
with higher glucose levels on the Mediterranean diet lost
~2 kg more body weight than the subjects with higher glu-
cose levels on the lower-fat diet.
Conclusions
Emerging evidence suggests that high-CHO diets, or more
specifically, high-glycaemic-load/low-fibre diets may pro-
mote weight gain or impede weight loss in subjects with

 impaired glucose metabolism/insulin resistance. Pretreat-
ment fasting glucose and insulin measurements could be
useful for identifying individuals who would benefit most
from a low–glycaemic-load/high-fibre diet that may im-
prove their weight loss and/or weight maintenance success.
Non-nutritive sweeteners: Allison Sylvetsky
Because NNSs such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin,
acesulfame K and steviol glycosides such as rebaudioside
A (extracted from the stevia plant) contain zero or negligi-
ble calories, they do not directly contribute to the energy
intake side of the energy balance equation. However, it
has been suggested that NNS consumption, through several
potential mechanisms, may indirectly affect energy balance
(236–238). A meta-analysis of nine prospective cohort
studies of adults and children demonstrated a positive asso-
ciation between NNS consumption and BMI (0.03 kg m�2,
95% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.06) (239). Epidemiologi-
cal studies have also shown positive associations between
NNS
and
metabolic
syndrome
(240–242)
and
T2D
(241,243–248). These studies do not demonstrate causa-
tion and are limited by the possibility of residual confound-
ing and reverse causality. Specifically, individuals with
higher BMI who are concerned about their weight or
patients with T2D may then choose to consume NNS
instead of caloric sweeteners. However, studies in which ro-
dents gained more weight (249,250) or exhibited inflam-
mation (251) or glucose intolerance (252) consuming
NNS compared with rodents consuming glucose (249) or
sucrose (250) provide support for potential cause and effect
relationships.
Mechanisms such as sweet taste receptor activation, dis-
turbance of the expected relationship between sweetness
and calories, changes in taste preferences and alteration of
gut microbiota may explain these associations (236–238).
It is also possible that caloric compensation occurs, negating
calories ‘saved’ by using NNS. This compensation could be
psychological, whereby one’s knowledge of consuming a
lower-calorie NNS-containing alternative may lead to
giving oneself permission for greater calorie ingestion at
subsequent meals. Compensation could be physiological,
in which consumption of lower-calorie NNS-containing al-
ternatives promotes heightened hunger and subsequently
higher calorie intake.
However, it has been questioned whether any of the
above mechanisms occur in humans and whether they occur
consistently in rodents. Based on a systematic review, it was
reported that in 62 of 90 animal studies, NNS did not in-
crease body weight (253), and a more recent meta-analysis
of 12 prospective cohort studies did not support an associa-
tion between NNS consumption and BMI (�0.002 kg m�2;
95% confidence interval: �0.009, 0.005) (253). Further-
more, two separate meta-analyses consisting of 10 (239)
and eight (253) RCTs both indicated that substituting
NNS for sugar resulted in a modest weight loss in adults.
Findings also favoured weight loss when NNS was com-
pared with water, but this meta-analysis only included three
trials (253). Because the benefits of substituting NNS for
sugar is a very different question than the benefits of
substituting NNS for water, more studies comparing NNS
and water are warranted. This is especially true for the su-
cralose, saccharin, acesulfame K and steviol glycosides,
which have been much less studied than aspartame.
Aspartame was utilized in nine of the studies included in
the meta-analyses (239,253), and three of these nine studies
administered aspartame in commercially available bever-
ages, consistent with the manner in which aspartame is fre-
quently consumed (254).
It does not appear that any of these RCTs revealed ad-
verse effects of NNS consumption on risk factors for cardio-
metabolic disease (255). Therefore, NNS may be a useful
tool for increasing adherence to behavioural weight loss
regimens. The longest intervention study conducted to date
included 163 obese women who were randomly assigned to
consume or to abstain from aspartame-sweetened foods and
beverages during 16 weeks of a 19-week weight reduction
programme (active weight loss), a 1-year maintenance pro-
gramme and a 2-year follow-up period. The aspartame
group lost significantly more weight overall and regained
significantly less weight during the 1-year maintenance
and the 2-year follow-up than the no-aspartame group
(256). During a more recent study in which 303 men and
women who habitually consumed diet (NNS) beverages
participated in a weight loss programme that included a
randomized assignment to either stop drinking NNS bever-
ages and consume 24 oz (710 mL) of water or to continue
drinking NNS beverages daily for 1 year (257), those in
the NNS beverage group lost more weight. These results
should be interpreted with caution as those randomized to
NNS beverages were essentially continuing their usual
beverage intake, while those who were assigned to switch
to water were required to implement and sustain a behav-
iour change. Furthermore, consuming NNS in the context
of an intensive weight loss programme focused on calorie
reduction may promote more weight loss than NNS use in
the general population. Nevertheless, several studies that
were not conducted as part of weight loss programmes also
showed no effects of NNS to increase body weight
(125,128,258,259). This includes the 6-month intervention
cited above in which overweight/obese subjects consumed
1 L of sucrose-sweetened cola, isocaloric amounts of low-
fat milk or 1 L of aspartame-sweetened cola or water per
day. There were no significant differences between the
effects of aspartame-sweetened cola and water on body
weight, visceral adiposity, liver fat and metabolic risk fac-
tors including blood TGs, HDL, total cholesterol, fasting
plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, HOMA-IR and uric

 acid (124,128). Indeed, there are no clinical intervention stud-
ies involving chronic NNS exposure in which NNS induced a
weight increase relative to sugar, water or habitual diet (253).
While studies investigating effects of NNS on weight in
children are limited, the largest study to date included 641
normal-weight children, aged 4–11 years, who were ran-
domized to groups consuming 8 oz of sucralose-sweetened
beverage or SSB daily for 18 months (260). Compared with
SSB consumption, consumption of sucralose-sweetened bev-
erage reduced weight gain and fat accumulation. However,
this study did not include an unsweetened control. Because
children gain weight due to growth over an 18-month pe-
riod, without a water or attention control group, it cannot
be determined whether the sucralose-sweetened beverage
had no effect on body weight or just less effect than the SSB.
Conclusions
Randomized controlled trials consistently demonstrate that
consumption of NNS may promote decreased energy in-
take, particularly when used as part of comprehensive
weight loss programmes. Additional well-controlled RCTs
are warranted, most specifically for saccharin, acesulfame
K and steviol glycosides, which have been studied less fre-
quently than aspartame and for periods no longer than
16 weeks. More studies in children and more studies
assessing metabolic and health outcomes beyond body
weight, such as effects on glucose tolerance and inflamma-
tion, are needed.
Responses in brain regions associated with reward
to the palatable Western diet: Eric Stice
Palatable, high-sugar and/or high-fat foods, major compo-
nents of the typical Western diet, can indirectly affect the
energy-in side of the energy balance equation through
activation of brain regions associated with reward that pro-
motes overeating. Importantly, it is not the greater reward re-
gion response to the tastes of palatable food that predicts
future weight gain, but rather the greater reward region re-
sponse to images of palatable foods (including advertise-
ments) and visual cues (eg. Golden Arches™) that signal
impending tastes of palatable foods. Both animal (261,262)
and human (263) experiments indicate that after repeated
pairings of cues (cartoon picture of chocolate milkshake
(263)) that predict palatable food tastes and actual palatable
food tastes, dopamine signalling increases in response to pre-
dictive cues but decreases in response to actual food tastes.
Therefore, excessive caloric intake that results in weight gain
is associated with reduced caudate (one of the brain structures
that compose the reward system) response to tastes of high-
sugar/high-fat foods (264) and an increase in reward region
response to visual cues that suggest impending tastes of these
foods (265). An apparent result of this process is that expo-
sure to food cues prompts eating in the absence of hunger,
which contributes to excessive weight gain. Indeed, prospec-
tive studies show that elevated reward responses to television
advertisements depicting palatable foods that are high in die-
tary fats and sugars (266) or to food cues (267) predicted
weight gain in adolescent girls and boys (266–268), young
women (269) and adults (270) over periods ranging from
6 months to 3 years. Furthermore, interventions that reduce
reward region responses to food cues, either through food re-
sponse training (271,272) or blockage of sweet taste receptors
(272,273), promoted weight loss or reduced intake of high-
sugar foods.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is consid-
ered to be one of the best tools currently available for the
detection of regional brain activations to specific cues or
tasks (274). However, correlations from studies utilizing
fMRI have been faulted for being artificially inflated mainly
due to small sample sizes (275). More recent studies,
though, have confirmed the predictive relationship between
increases in reward region response to food cues and energy
intake or future weight gain using prospective data that es-
tablish temporal precedence (265), split-half replication
(265,267) and sample sizes of ~150 (265,267,276). Further-
more, in these larger studies (265,267,276), healthy body
weight (BMI > 18 and <25 kg m�2) was an inclusion
criteria, thus ensuring that prior overeating or obesity did
not contribute to the reward region response measured by
fMRI at baseline (267,276). Collectively, these studies indi-
cate the potential value of fMRI as a tool to study vulnera-
bilities to weight gain and also highlight food cues for their
likely importance in the obesity epidemic (277).
Conclusions
Elevated reactivity in brain regions associated with reward in
response to food cues predicts future weight gain. Regular in-
take of palatable foods that are high in fat and sugar increases
responses to food cues in brain regions associated with re-
ward, further increasing overeating. Strategies that reduce re-
sponses to food cues in brain regions associated with reward
may be effective for promoting weight loss and preventing
weight gain. This is an evolving area with high potential to in-
crease knowledge regarding the development of obesity and
perhaps help to curb the obesity epidemic.
Emerging evidence about sugar consumption during
critical periods and in vulnerable populations:
Michael Goran
Elevated reactivity in brain regions associated with reward in
response to high-sugar-food cues may explain the positive as-
sociations between added sugar and SSB consumption and
weight gain in both prospective cohort trials (278–283) and
RCTs (281,283). However, it does not explain the emerging
evidence that suggests effects of direct and indirect sugar ex-
posure on body composition in very young children.

 Vulnerability to second-hand sugar exposure during
gestation
Gestation is a critical developmental period during which
second-hand sugar exposure may increase susceptibility to
obesity in the offspring. Gilman et al. recently reported that
in 1,078 mother–child pairs, maternal SSB consumption
during the second trimester of pregnancy was positively as-
sociated with several indices of obesity in 7-year-old chil-
dren, including fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (284). The associations were not attenuated
when adjusted for maternal energy intake or for the number
of SSB servings per day consumed by the children. The re-
sults also showed no association between maternal intake
of NNS beverages and child BMI/adiposity. Both findings
are in conflict with the results of a recent study by Zhu
et al. who reported a positive association between child
BMI z-score at age 7 and maternal intake of NNS beverages
during gestation, but no association with maternal intake of
SSB (918 mother–child pairs) (285). Study differences that
may have contributed to the discordant results include less ac-
curate and objective outcomes (child height and weight re-
ported by the mother (285) versus height, weight and body
fat via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measured by study
staff (284)) and less precise adjustment increments for the
child’s intake of SSB and NNS beverages at age 7 (<1 or ≥1
serving per week (285) versus servings per day (284)) in the
latter study (285). It is also possible that the association be-
tween maternal consumption of NNS beverages and child
BMI z-score represented reverse causation. In the Zhu et al.
study, pre-pregnancy BMI was higher (27.6 kg m�2) (285)
than in the Gilman study (24.6 kg m�2) (284), and it was pos-
itively
associated
with
NNS
beverage
consumption
(P < 0.001) (285). However, another recent study also re-
ported positive associations between maternal consumption
of NNS during pregnancy and risk of overweight of the off-
spring during infancy and no such association with maternal
consumption of SSB (3,033 pairs) (286). Further analyses
from this study showed the positive associations between ma-
ternal consumption of NNS during pregnancy and risk of
overweight were specific to male offspring and to infants
who were not breastfed for at least 6 months (286). Also, post
hoc analyses revealed positive associations between maternal
SSB, fruit drinks and fruit juice consumption and risk of over-
weight in the offspring (287). As recently reviewed, the
evidence concerning the long-term effects of NNS exposure
during gestation, infancy and childhood is limited and incon-
sistent, and more investigation is needed (288).
Vulnerability to second-hand sugar exposure during
lactation
Lactation is also a critical developmental period during
which second-hand sugar exposure may increase suscepti-
bility to obesity in the offspring. A recent study of 25
mother–child pairs provided evidence that the fructose
concentration in breast milk is associated with infant body
composition, including fat mass (289). Breast milk samples
collected at 1 and 6 months post-partum contained fructose,
but at much lower concentrations than glucose and lactose
(means = 0.0037, 0.14, and 421 mmol L�1, respectively).
However, the concentrations of fructose were quite vari-
able, and it was the only component of breast milk that
was positively associated with infant body weight, fat mass,
lean mass and bone mineral content at 6 months of age
(289). While this level of fructose has been shown to en-
hance transcription factors involved in adipocyte differenti-
ation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α) and increase glucose
transporter 4 expression in preadipocyte culture (290),
more research will be needed to determine whether it has
in vivo effects in breastfed infants.
Vulnerability to first-hand sugar exposure during infancy
and early childhood
If infants are susceptible to the effects of second-hand fruc-
tose exposure during gestation and lactation, then it follows
that they are also susceptible to direct effects of fructose
consumption. In support of this, the prevalence of obesity
in a study of 1,189 6-year-old children was twice as high
in those who consumed SSB during infancy (0–12 months
of age) compared with those who consumed none (17.0%
vs. 8.6%) (291). Adjustment for SSB intake at age 6 did
not eliminate this association (291). Importantly, consump-
tion of any SSB during infancy also doubled the risk that
these children would be consuming at least one SSB per
day at age 6 (292).
Added sugar consumption may contribute to the suscepti-
bility of Hispanic children to early-onset obesity within the
first few years of life. The prevalence of obesity in 1,483
Hispanic children, 2–4 years of age, from the Los Angeles
County Women, Infants and Child programme, was 15%
(293) compared with the average of 10% in 2–5-year-old
NHANES children born in the same years (294). Based on
caregiver reports, 18% of the Hispanic children consumed
two or more servings of SSB per day (serving = 12 oz),
25% consumed one serving and 57% consumed zero SSB
serving per day. Overall, this a 50% higher level of SSB con-
sumption than that reported for 2- to 3-year-old children in
NHANES 2003–2004 (295). SSB consumption by the
young Hispanic children was associated with BMI, with
the prevalence of obesity exceeding 20% among children
who consumed two or more SSB servings per day (293).
On the positive side, it was also observed that the preva-
lence of obesity was reduced to 10% among the children
consuming two or more SSB servings per day who had been
breastfed for ≥1 year, resulting in a significant interaction
between SSB intake and breastfeeding (P = 0.005) (293).
More study of young Hispanic children will be needed to
determine the contributions of added sugar consumption,

high prevalence of obesity and to examine the mechanisms
underlying

breastfeeding.
Sugar consumption in vulnerable populations
Sugar exposure may have unique effects in certain popula-
tions. Hispanics for example may be particularly vulnerable
to the adverse effects of sugar exposure because they are dis-
proportionate carriers of the variant allele of the patatin-like
phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3)
gene. The PNPLA3 variant allele has a frequency rate of
about 50% in Hispanics compared with <10% in other
populations (296). The PNPLA3 variant predisposes to
NAFLD (297) and is associated with increased liver fat
(296,298), elevated plasma alanine transaminase levels
(299,300) and cirrhosis/advanced fibrosis (301) in the His-
panic population. Hispanic children with obesity, ranging
in age from 8 to 18 years, also exhibited significantly in-
creased liver fat as a function of PNPLA3 risk allele num-
ber, with 64% of the homozygous carriers having a liver
fat
content
greater
than
5.5%
(302)
(>5%
liver
fat = NAFLD).
The effects of the PNPLA3 variant allele may be exacer-
bated in the context of a high-sugar diet (303). PNPLA3
variant allele knock-in mice had normal levels of hepatic
fat on a chow diet, but when challenged with a high-sucrose
diet, their liver fat levels increased twofold to threefold com-
pared with wild-type littermates consuming a high-sucrose
diet (297). Obese Hispanic children with two copies of the
PNPLA3 variant were particularly susceptible to increased
liver fat when consuming a diet high in added sugar (302).
Conversely, when adults homozygous for the variant allele
were placed on a low-calorie, low-CHO diet, they lost
3 kg of body weight and reduced liver fat by 45% in only
6 d. Control subjects, who were homozygous for the wild-
type gene and matched for BMI and liver fat, lost the same
amount of weight, but their reduction in liver fat (18%)
was significantly lower (304). More studies are needed to
confirm a gene * diet interaction between the PNPLA3 gene
variant and dietary sugar intake.
Conclusions
Added sugar consumption in early life is associated with
higher obesity in childhood. More research is needed to de-
termine if first-hand and second-hand sugar exposure dur-
ing critical developmental periods, specifically gestation,
lactation and infancy, is associated with higher risk of obe-
sity. The greater frequency of the PNPLA3 gene variant in
Hispanics and its potential interaction with dietary sugar
may make Hispanic children and adults particularly suscep-
tible to the negative health effects of high-sugar diets.
Contributions of the gut microbiome to diet-induced
obesity: Peter Turnbaugh
Consumption of a high-fat, high-sugar Western diet may af-
fect one or both sides of the energy balance equation by
shifting the types of microbes found within the gastrointesti-
nal tract (the gut microbiome) and their metabolic activity.
Consumption of the Western diet results in a significant
change to the gut microbiome (often increased Firmicutes
and decreased Bacteroidetes) (305), a microbial signature that
is remarkably reproducible across inbred and outbred
mice of diverse genotypes and mice with defects in immu-
nity and metabolism (306). Gut microbes from mice with
Western-diet-induced obesity or from lean mice consuming a
low-fat, plant-polysaccharide-rich diet were transplanted into
germ-free (GF) recipients. The GF mice receiving the
microbiome from mice with Western-diet-induced obesity
gained more body fat than the mice receiving the microbiome
from the lean donors (305), demonstrating that differences in
the mouse gut microbiome can affect host energy balance.
Human studies also support causal links between diet, the
gut microbiome and host energy balance (307–309). Short-
term dietary interventions revealed that consumption of a
high-fat diet rich in animal products reshapes the human gut
microbiome within a single day (310). Transplantation of
the stool microbiome from human twins discordant for obe-
sity demonstrated that the mice receiving the microbiomes
of the twins with obesity gained more body fat than mice col-
onized with the microbiomes of lean twins (308).
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed through which
changes in the structure and function of the gut microbiome
influence host adiposity, encompassing both sides of the en-
ergy balance equation (311). One possible mechanism by
which gut bacteria may increase ‘energy in’ is by liberating
additional calories from the diet and/or altering the intesti-
nal absorption of nutrients. Compared with lean controls,
the distal gut microbiomes from obese mice were enriched
for genes that encode enzymes that break down substrates
such as plant polysaccharides that cannot be metabolized
by human enzymes (312). Consistent with studies of the
Western-diet-associated microbiome (305), transplantation
of the distal gut microbiome from obese mice resulted in a
significant increase in host adiposity (312). Other groups
have identified single bacterial strains and even specific pro-
teins that are sufficient to ameliorate diet-induced obesity.
Colonization with the gut Verrucomicrobium Akkermansia
muciniphila led to increased stool calories (consistent with
altered intestinal metabolism and/or absorption), normali-
zation of plasma lipopolysaccharide concentration and
decreased insulin resistance and triglyceridaemia in high-
fat-fed mice (313). These effects appeared to be partly medi-
ated by activation of toll-like receptor 2 by a specific protein
present
on
the
outer
membrane

muciniphila
(313,314). Recent studies have also suggested that gut

 bacterial metabolites may increase appetite through the acti-
vation of the parasympathetic nervous system (315).
On the other hand, there is emerging evidence to suggest
that gut bacteria can also affect energy output (316). An ex-
ample of one potential mechanism involves microbiota-
induced changes in bile acid composition, which can alter
signalling to the bile acid nuclear receptor, farnesoid X re-
ceptor (FXR) (317–319). A recent study in conventionally
raised (CONVR) or GF mice that were wild type (FXR+/+)
or FXR knockout (FXR�/�) suggested that the gut microbi-
ota impacts diet-induced obesity via FXR signalling. While
consuming a high-fat diet for 10 weeks, CONVR FXR+/+
mice gained more body weight and had higher levels of liver
fat than CONVR FXR�/� mice, GF FXR+/+ mice or GF
FXR�/� mice (320)). Previous studies in mice treated with
an FXR inhibitor have shown that the decreases in liver
fat were accompanied by unaffected energy intake and in-
creased energy expenditure (321).
Conclusions
Consumption of a processed high-fat, high-sugar diet alters
the structure and function of the mouse gut microbiome
(322). Data from animal models suggest that the gut
microbiome can shape both sides of the energy balance
equation, altering energy intake and expenditure. More re-
search is needed to better understand the mechanisms re-
sponsible, the role of diet-induced changes to the gut
microbiome in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic dis-
ease and the translational relevance of these findings for the
treatment of human obesity.
Overall conclusions
The overall purpose of the 2017 CrossFit Foundation
Academic Conference was to address the following ques-
tion: are all calories equal with regard to effects on cardio-
metabolic disease and obesity? It was the first objective of
the conference to consider whether certain dietary compo-
nents, specifically fat and sugar, increase risk for cardiomet-
abolic disease by metabolic mechanisms that are not
mediated solely by positive energy balance and fat gain. Al-
though this is a complex area involving the need to account
for many inter-related factors, including the challenges re-
lated to manipulating and/or documenting dietary intake
in human research subjects, the authors agree on the follow-
ing points:
• Evidence suggests that consumption of n-6 fatty acids
results in lower cardiometabolic risk factors/risk com-
pared with isocaloric amounts of SFA. However, differ-
ences exist between individual SFA, and the food
matrix needs to be considered; e.g. dairy foods such
as cheese and yogurts are associated with reduced car-
diometabolic risk. More research is needed to clarify
the differences among the individual SFA and SFA-
containing foods.
• Evidence
strongly
suggests
that
consumption
of
fructose-sweetened,
HFCS-sweetened
or
sucrose-
sweetened beverages increases cardiometabolic risk
factors/risk compared with isocaloric amounts of
starch. More research is needed comparing the meta-
bolic effects of SSB versus sugar in solid food and sugar
in solid food versus refined or whole grain starch.
Under the second objective of the conference, it was con-
sidered whether all calories were equal with regard to their
potential to promote fat gain and obesity. More specifically,
evidence was presented suggesting that certain dietary pat-
terns or components have the potential to promote fat gain
via mechanisms that are in addition to their specific contri-
bution of calories to the ‘energy in’ side of the energy bal-
ance equation. The authors agree on the following points:
• There is currently insufficient evidence that a high-
CHO diet affects weight gain or weight loss to a differ-
ent extent than a high-fat diet. Susceptibility to weight
gain
when
consuming
diets
high
in
refined
CHO/glycaemic load may be affected by the metabolic
status of the individual (i.e. glucose tolerance/insulin
sensitivity). More studies focused on strategies to pre-
vent weight regain in weight-reduced subjects are
needed.
• RCTs ranging from 4 weeks to 3 years in duration
demonstrate that consumption of aspartame does not
promote body weight gain in adults. Well-controlled
and long-term RCTs in adults are warranted to assess
the effects of saccharin, acesulfame K and steviol glyco-
sides on body weight and other health outcomes. More
studies to assess the effects of all types of NNSs in chil-
dren are needed.
• Continued research on the following topics could pro-
vide important insights and strategies for slowing the
obesity epidemic.
• The high-sugar, high-fat palatable Western diet
could be perturbing both sides of the energy balance
equation through effects on brain regions associated
with reward and/or on the gut microbiome.
• Susceptibility to weight gain may be affected by ex-
posure to sugar and/or NSS during critical periods
of development from pre-conception to adult life.
Nutrition and public health
Rates of obesity and cardiometabolic disease continue to
climb globally (7,323–326). This is clearly a multifactorial
problem that involves genetic, metabolic, behavioural and
environmental factors, and progress towards a resolution
will require consideration of all these factors (327). Regard-
ing nutrition, the speakers and delegates at this conference

 agree that strategies to solve the complex problems associ-
ated with obesity should include consideration of the above
conclusions regarding added sugar and specific high-SFA
foods. Also, we need more research on the effects of diet
in vulnerable populations and during critical periods of de-
velopment, and the ways that responses to diet may be me-
diated by the genotype or metabolic status of the individual,
by the responsiveness of brain regions associated with re-
ward to food cues or by the microbiome. Such research
may provide new strategies for attenuating the obesity crisis
by developing more individual-based/precision-based nutri-
tion approaches. Therefore, the search for solutions must
include support for research to promote the potential of
these new strategies and to fill knowledge gaps. And, finally,
they also agree that the scientific evidence related to any
single food or macronutrient or mechanism is less likely to
impact the global epidemics of obesity and cardiometabolic
disease as significantly as solutions related to the following:
• Prevention: The food environment needs to be im-
proved. Food policies that will improve the availability
and reduce the costs of healthy foods compared with
high-calorie, palatable foods are needed. Lowering
the plethora of food cues that may promote overeating
of high-sugar, high-fat palatable foods could also be an
effective strategy.
• Healthy dietary patterns: Strategies that emphasize the
health benefits and palatability of dietary patterns
consisting of whole grains, fruits, vegetables and
healthy fats, rather than the negative consequences of
a single food or food group, are likely a better ap-
proach to prevention.
• Personalized nutrition: Individual variability needs to
be considered when defining the healthy diet. For ex-
ample, the optimal diet composition for weight control
may depend on the individual’s glucose metabolism. In
addition, genetics, the microbiome, life stages (preg-
nancy, infancy and early childhood), culture, dietary
preferences and weaknesses (i.e. ‘Is the brain reward
region more activated by sweet candy bars or salty po-
tato chips?’) should all be considered when determin-
ing the optimal diet pattern for an individual or
susceptible segment of the population.
