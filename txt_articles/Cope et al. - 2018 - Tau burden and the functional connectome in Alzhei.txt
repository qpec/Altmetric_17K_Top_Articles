Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) represent neurodegenerative tauopathies with predominantly cortical
versus subcortical disease burden. In Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathology and atrophy preferentially affect ‘hub’ brain regions that
are densely connected. It was unclear whether hubs are differentially affected by neurodegeneration because they are more likely to
receive pathological proteins that propagate trans-neuronally, in a prion-like manner, or whether they are selectively vulnerable due
to a lack of local trophic factors, higher metabolic demands, or differential gene expression. We assessed the relationship between
tau burden and brain functional connectivity, by combining in vivo PET imaging using the ligand AV-1451, and graph theoretic
measures of resting state functional MRI in 17 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, 17 patients with PSP, and 12 controls. Strongly
connected nodes displayed more tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease, independently of intrinsic connectivity network, validating
the predictions of theories of trans-neuronal spread but not supporting a role for metabolic demands or deficient trophic support in
tau accumulation. This was not a compensatory phenomenon, as the functional consequence of increasing tau burden in
Alzheimer’s disease was a progressive weakening of the connectivity of these same nodes, reducing weighted degree and local
efficiency and resulting in weaker ‘small-world’ properties. Conversely, in PSP, unlike in Alzheimer’s disease, those nodes that
accrued pathological tau were those that displayed graph metric properties associated with increased metabolic demand and a lack
of trophic support rather than strong functional connectivity. Together, these findings go some way towards explaining why
Alzheimer’s disease affects large scale connectivity networks throughout cortex while neuropathology in PSP is concentrated in a
small number of subcortical structures. Further, we demonstrate that in PSP increasing tau burden in midbrain and deep nuclei was
associated with strengthened cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Disrupted cortico-subcortical and cortico-brainstem inter-
actions meant that information transfer took less direct paths, passing through a larger number of cortical nodes, reducing
closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality in PSP, while increasing weighted degree, clustering, betweenness centrality and
local efficiency. Our results have wide-ranging implications, from the validation of models of tau trafficking in humans to under-
standing the relationship between regional tau burden and brain functional reorganization.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP) are both characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary
lesions containing hyper-phosphorylated filamentous tau in-
clusions (Goedert and Spillantini, 2006). However, the dis-
eases differ in: (i) the distribution of these tau inclusions;
(ii) the balance of expression of tau isoforms; and (iii) the
ultrastructure of tau filaments. Here, we test the impact of
these differences in tau pathology on the reorganization of
large-scale functional brain connectivity architecture.
Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by widespread extra-
cellular deposition of amyloid-b and paired helical fila-
ments of tau with three (3R) and four (4R) repeats in the
microtubule-binding domain (Sisodia et al., 1990; Liu
et al., 2001). In Alzheimer’s disease, these pathological pro-
teins arise early in the transentorhinal cortex, from where
they spread to limbic regions, followed by inferior frontal
and
parietal
cortex
(Braak
and
Braak,
1991,
1995).
Although tau and amyloid-b have complex and synergistic
effects (Nisbet et al., 2015), there is converging evidence
that tau mediates direct toxic effects on neurons and syn-
aptic plasticity (Ballatore et al., 2007; Roberson et al.,
2007; Ittner and Go
¨tz, 2011; Myeku et al., 2016) and cor-
relates
with
hypometabolism
and
symptomatology
in
Alzheimer’s disease (Lehmann et al., 2013; Ossenkoppele
et al., 2015, 2016). By contrast, pathological tau deposits
in PSP are composed of straight filaments of predominantly
4R tau (Taniguchi-Watanabe et al., 2016). This is most
prominent in midbrain and deep brain nuclei early in the
course of the Richardson’s syndrome variant of PSP,
spreading to cortical regions in advanced stages of the dis-
ease (Williams et al., 2007).
To estimate the burden of tau pathology in vivo, PET
ligands
have
been
developed,
including
18F-AV-1451
(Chien et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2013; Ossenkoppele et al.,
2015, 2016). While there has been significant debate about
the specificity of this ligand for tau, especially in the non-
Alzheimer’s dementias (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017a; Xia and
Dickerson, 2017), the distribution of 18F-AV-1451 binding
recapitulates Braak staging in Alzheimer’s disease (Schwarz
et al., 2016) and correlates with post-mortem neuropathol-
ogy in primary tauopathies (Smith et al., 2016; Passamonti
et al., 2017). 18F-AV-1451 binding has been shown to cor-
relate with cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s disease
(Johnson et al., 2016) and healthy older adults (Scho
¨ll
et al., 2016) more robustly than quantitative amyloid-b
imaging (Brier et al., 2016). The 18F-AV-1451 ligand also
effectively distinguishes between Alzheimer’s disease and
PSP cases based on both the intensity and regional distri-
bution of its binding potential (BPND) (Passamonti et al.,
2017).
In many neurodegenerative disorders, neuropathology
and atrophy are most marked in those brain regions that
are densely connected, both at the structural (Crossley
et al., 2014) and functional level (Dai et al., 2014). In
graph-theoretical terms, these densely connected regions
are usually referred to as ‘hubs’ (Buckner et al., 2009).
There are a number of hypotheses as to why hubs are
vulnerable to neurodegeneration. First, pathological pro-
teins
may
propagate
trans-neuronally,
in
a
prion-like
manner (Prusiner, 1984; Baker et al., 1994; Goedert,
2015) such that highly connected regions are more likely
to receive pathology from ‘seed’ regions affected in early
stages of the disease (Zhou et al., 2012), leading to neuro-
degeneration that mirrors structural and functional brain
connectivity (Raj et al., 2012, 2015; Abdelnour et al.,
2014). Alternatively, hubs might be selectively vulnerable
to a given level of pathology, due to a lack of local trophic
factors (Appel, 1981), higher metabolic demands (Saxena
and Caroni, 2011; de Haan et al., 2012), or differential
gene expression (Rittman et al., 2016).
These alternate hypotheses lead to different predictions
about the relationship between tau burden and connectiv-
ity. The trans-neuronal spread hypothesis predicts that re-
gions that are more strongly interconnected would accrue
more tau pathology. This would manifest as higher tau
burden in nodes with larger weighted degree, which is a
measure of the number and strength of functional connec-
tions involving each node. In contrast, if hubs are vulner-
able to tau accumulation because of increased metabolic
demand this might manifest as a positive relationship be-
tween tau burden and participation coefficient, which is a
measure of the proportion of a node’s connections that are
with other neural communities, and is the graph metric that
is most closely correlated with metabolic activity (Chennu
et al., 2017). Finally, if trophic support is an important
factor in tau accumulation, this might manifest as a nega-
tive relationship between tau burden and clustering coeffi-
cient; nodes with less tightly clustered connectivity patterns
might have more vulnerable trophic supply.
Here we go beyond previous associative studies to exam-
ine, in the same subjects, the relationship between in vivo
tau burden, as measured by the PET ligand 18F-AV-1451

 BPND, and functional connectivity, as summarized by graph
theoretic measures based on resting state (task-free) func-
tional MRI. We test the following linked hypotheses:
(i) Brain regions that are normally more densely inter-
connected accrue more tau pathology.
(ii) In Alzheimer’s disease, where tau accumulation is pre-
dominantly cortical, the functional consequence is
that affected nodes become more weakly connected
and local efficiency of information transfer is reduced.
(iii) In PSP-Richardson’s syndrome, where neurodegenera-
tion associated with tau accumulation is most severe
in midbrain and basal ganglia, the functional conse-
quence of disrupted cortico-subcortical and cortico-
brainstem interactions (Gardner et al., 2013) is that
indirect cortico-cortical connections become stronger.
Materials and methods
Participants
All patients had mental capacity to take part in the study and
provided informed consent. Study procedures were approved
by the National Research Ethics Service. We recruited 17 pa-
tients with Alzheimer’s disease, as evidenced by a either clinical
diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s dementia according to con-
sensus criteria (n = 10) (McKhann et al., 2011), or a clinical
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a positive
amyloid PET scan (n = 7) (Klunk et al., 2004; Okello et al.,
2009). Patients with MCI and evidence of amyloid-b were
included to ensure the largest possible variability in tau
burden within the Alzheimer’s disease group. We also recruited
17 patients with PSP-Richardson’s syndrome by 1996 criteria
(Litvan et al., 1996). Retrospective case review confirmed that
all PSP subjects also met the revised 2017 criteria for PSP-RS
(Ho
¨glinger et al., 2017). Twelve age-matched controls were
also examined. Participant demographics are given in Table
1 and detailed neuropsychological test results for each subject
are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Study procedures
This study formed part of the NIMROD (Neuroimaging of
Inflammation in Memory and Related Other Disorders) pro-
ject, for which the trial protocol containing general methods
has been previously published (Bevan-Jones et al., 2017b).
All participants underwent the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive
Examination-Revised
(ACE-R),
11 min
of
resting
state
functional
MRI at 3 T,
and
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging.
Participants with PSP were also examined according to the
PSP
Rating
Scale
(Golbe
and
Ohman-Strickland,
2007).
Those with a clinical diagnosis of MCI had 11C-PiB PET ima-
ging on a separate occasion—only those with increased uptake
indicative of underlying Alzheimer’s pathology are reported
here.
MRI data acquisition and
preprocessing
MRI was performed at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre,
University of Cambridge, UK using a 3 T Siemens Magnetom
Tim Trio scanner with a Siemens 32-channel phased-array
head coil (Siemens Healthcare).
A T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo
(MPRAGE)
image
was
acquired
with
repetition
time =
2300 ms, echo time = 2.98 ms, matrix = 256 � 240, in-plane
resolution of 1 � 1 mm, 176 slices of 1 mm thickness, inver-
sion time = 900 ms and flip angle = 9�.
Eyes-closed resting state (task-free) multi-echo functional
imaging was carried out for 11 min. A total of 269 EPI
image volumes were acquired with repetition time = 2430 ms,
echo times = 13.00, 30.55 and 48.10 ms, matrix = 64 � 64,
in-plane resolution of 3.75 � 3.75 mm, 34 slices of 3.8 mm
thickness with an interslice gap of 0.38 mm, GRAPPA parallel
imaging with an acceleration factor of 2 and bandwidth =
2368 Hz/pixel. The first six volumes were discarded to elimin-
ate saturation effects and achieve steady state magnetization.
Preprocessing employed the ME-ICA pipeline (https://wiki.
cam.ac.uk/bmuwiki/MEICA)
(Kundu
et
al.,
2012,
2013),
which
uses
independent
component
analysis
to
classify
BOLD and non-BOLD signals based on the identification of
linearly dependent and independent echo time dependent com-
ponents. This provides an optimal approach to correct for
movement-related and non-neuronal signals, and is therefore
particularly well suited to our study, in which systematic dif-
ferences in movement or head position might reasonably have
been expected between patient groups. In fact, perhaps surpris-
ingly, such differences were not observed (Supplementary
Fig. 1)—between group ANOVAs demonstrated no significant
differences between groups in terms of frame displacement
before (P = 0.88) or after (P = 0.42) ME-ICA preprocessing,
nor
in
terms
of
DVARS
(Power
et
al.,
2012)
before
(P = 0.89) or after (P = 0.67) ME-ICA preprocessing. Note
that
both
movement
parameters
were
approximately
an
order of magnitude lower after ME-ICA preprocessing.
The MPRAGE images were processed into the standard
space using DARTEL (Ashburner, 2007), producing a study-
specific template in stereotactic space. Each functional MRI

 series mean image was co-registered to the corresponding
MPRAGE image. The whole functional MRI series was
warped to the template space using the DARTEL flow fields.
To perform a whole brain graph-theoretical analysis that
included the brainstem, cerebellum and subcortical structures,
the
Harvard-Oxford
Cortical
atlas
and
Harvard-Oxford
Subcortical atlas, each thresholded at 25%, were combined.
Additionally, a Freesurfer 6 brainstem parcellation of the
MNI152 (2009 asymmetric) brain together with remaining
Ventral DC completed the whole brain labelling. This atlas
was sub-parcellated into 598 regions of approximately equal
volume [mean 1.995, standard deviation (SD) 0.323 ml] such
that each sub-parcel could be uniquely identified with an atlas
region. The MNI-space parcellation was matched to the group
standard space using inverse deformations following applica-
tion of the ‘Population to ICBM Registration’ SPM function to
the group template, with nearest neighbour interpolation.
The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series for
each node was extracted using the CONN functional connect-
ivity toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012).
Between-node association matrices were generated, and then z-
transformed for further analysis.
Functional connectivity assessment
Graph theoretical analysis was used to investigate the global
and local characteristics of brain networks. These metrics were
calculated in python using the Maybrain software (github.com/
rittman/maybrain) and networkx (version 1.11). Reported met-
rics were calculated in each subject at absolute network density
thresholds of 1–10% in 1% increments using a minimum
spanning tree to ensure complete connectivity of the graph
(Alexander-Bloch et al., 2010). Primary statistical analysis
was performed at an intermediate density of 6%, with con-
firmatory analyses separately performed at all other densities.
Weighted degree and participation coefficient were analysed in
their raw forms, and all other metrics were dissociated from
variation in degree by binarization after thresholding and nor-
malization against 1000 random graphs with the same number
of connections at each node.
The graph metrics assessed were:
(i) Weighted degree: the number and strength of functional
connections involving each node.
(ii) Weighted participation coefficient: the proportion of a
node’s functional connectivity that involves other nodes
that are not part of its own community structure, as
defined by the Louvain community detection algorithm.
Nodes with high degree and low participation coefficient
are ‘provincial hubs’ (i.e. display strong connectivity only
within their own community), while those with high par-
ticipation coefficient are connector nodes (Joyce et al.,
2010).
(iii) Betweenness centrality: the number of shortest paths be-
tween any other two nodes that pass through the node of
interest. Nodes that are important for the transfer of in-
formation between other nodes have high betweenness
centrality.
(iv) Closeness centrality: the inverse of the path length be-
tween a node and all other nodes in the graph. This is
the node-wise equivalent of global efficiency, which is the
inverse sum of all the shortest path lengths in the graph.
(v) Local efficiency: the number of strong connections a node
has with its neighbouring nodes. This reflects the robust-
ness of local networks to disruption.
(vi) Eigenvector centrality: this measure quantifies the func-
tional influence of a node on every other node in the
graph, by weighting the importance of each nodal con-
nection based on the influence of the nodes with which
they connect.
(vii) Clustering coefficient: the fraction of triangular connec-
tions formed by a node with other nodes. In other
words, a node is strongly clustered if a large proportion
of its neighbours are neighbours of each other.
Nodal connectivity strength was assessed for comparison to
weighted degree, to ensure that our results did not result
from bias introduced by proportionate thresholding. This
metric is related to weighted degree, but includes information
from all strengths of connection between every pair of nodes.
As such, it is more subject to functional MRI signal-to-noise
ratio limitations, and it is not a suitable metric for whole-
brain, cross-sectional analysis across individuals, but it can
be used to make a node-wise, group average assessment analo-
gous to that for weighted degree.
Tau burden assessment
Other than the atlas used to define regions of interest, all AV-
1451 and PiB data acquisition and preprocessing steps were
identical to those reported by
Passamonti
et
al. (2017).
Ligand preparation was carried out at the Wolfson Brain
Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge, with high radiochem-
ical purity. 18F-AV-1451 was produced with a specific activity
of 216 � 60 GBq/mmol at the end of synthesis (60 min); 11C-PiB
specific activity was 4150 GBq/mmol. PET imaging was per-
formed on a GE Advance PET scanner with a 15min 68Ge
transmission scan used for attenuation correction acquiring 58
frames of increasing duration. PET scanning was performed in
3D mode (63 image planes; 15.2 cm axial field of view; 5.6 mm
transaxial resolution and 2.4 mm slice interval) 80–100min
after a 9.0 to 11.0mCi bolus injection in frames of 4 � 5 min.
Each 11C-PiB scan was acquired using a 8.5 to 15mCi bolus
injection immediately followed by a 60-min dynamic acquisition
in 69 frames (12 � 15s, 57 � 60s). Scans were reconstructed
on the GE Advance scanner using the PROMIS 3D filtered back
projection algorithm, correcting for randoms, dead time, nor-
malization, sensitivity and scatter attenuation.
The cerebellar grey matter was used as a reference tissue to
express the distribution volume ratio (DVR) for the 11C-PiB
PET data for each MCI participant. PiB scans were classified
as positive if the average SUVR values across the cortex were
more than 1.5 times that of the cerebellar regions of interest.
Seven MCI participants met this criterion and were included in
the study.
The non-displaceable binding potential of 18F-AV-1451 was
assessed at each region of interest in the sub-parcellated atlas
after rigid registration of each subject’s dynamic PET image
series to their T1-weighted MRI scan. This was normalized
against the superior cerebellum, a reference region considered
to have no tau pathology in either PSP or Alzheimer’s disease
(Williams et al., 2007; Scho
¨ll et al., 2016; Passamonti et al.,
2017). These data were corrected for white matter and CSF
partial volumes by calculating the ordinary least squared

 solution for the binding potential map voxel-wise in each
region for grey plus white matter segments, each smoothed
to PET resolution.
Statistical approach
A stereotyped statistical approach was taken to the analysis of
graph metrics of theoretical interest. All statistical analyses
were performed in MATLAB 2015b (The Mathworks Inc.,
2015), with the exception of moderation analysis, which was
performed in R (R Core Team, 2016).
A group-averaged analysis assessed the first hypothesis by
examining the node-wise relationships between
18F-AV-1451
binding potential and weighted degree, weighted participation
coefficient, and clustering coefficient. These analyses were per-
formed across the whole brain and within 10 intrinsic connect-
ivity networks. To avoid circularity, where the regions of interest
are defined by the test data, the intrinsic connectivity networks
were independently derived from a publicly available dataset
(Smith et al., 2009). A binary mask was constructed for each
resting state network by thresholding at Z5 2.6 (P5 0.005 un-
corrected). Nodes were defined as belonging to a network if their
centre of mass was within 5 mm of any positive voxel.
A between-subject analysis assessed the second and third
hypotheses. This was undertaken at a variety of spatial scales.
We first looked across the whole brain. For each individual, we
first calculated a measure of disease-related tau burden. For
participants with Alzheimer’s disease, in whom tau deposition
increases in both magnitude and distribution as disease pro-
gresses (Braak and Braak, 1995), tau burden was calculated
as average
18F-AV-1451 binding potential across the whole
brain. In PSP tau deposition remains confined to brainstem
and deep nuclei even in late disease (Williams et al., 2007);
tau burden was therefore calculated as average 18F-AV-1451
binding potential across the left and right thalamus, caudate,
putamen, pallidum, accumbens, ventral diencephalon, midbrain,
pons and medulla. Both methods were separately assessed for
controls. These measures of individual tau burden were then
correlated with whole-brain averaged graph metrics to assess
the relationship between the metric in question and disease
burden in each group separately. Moderation analysis was per-
formed for each metric to assess whether the relationships dif-
fered between Alzheimer’s disease and PSP. It has recently been
reported that patients with early onset Alzheimer’s disease have
a higher tau burden than those with later onset, especially in
later Braak stage regions (Scho
¨ll et al., 2017). Non-significant
trend relationships between overall tau burden and age were
observed in our cohort (Alzheimer’s disease r = �0.27, PSP
r = �0.02, Control r = �0.38; Supplementary Fig. 2). Cross-sec-
tional analyses were therefore performed twice, with and with-
out partialling out the effect of age on tau burden.
Regionality of the demonstrated effects was assessed within
groups by correlating tau burden with the single subject graph
metric values at each node; the gradient of the best fit linear
regression within each group was the outcome measure. The
nodal gradients in cerebellar regions were discarded (as this
was the reference region for PET imaging), and the remaining
regional maps were then collapsed into a vector. This was
correlated with a matching vector of local tau burden at
each node, calculated as the group-averaged increase in
18F-AV-1451 binding potential. This resulted in a measure of
the relationship between the distribution of disease-related
change in each graph metric and regional deposition of tau.
Results
Resting state connectivity differences
exist between groups
As a prelude to the detailed analysis of network features, we
first confirmed that our groups differed in their resting state
connectivity, by testing for differences between the group
averaged association matrices (Fig. 1, top). Jennrich tests
confirmed highly significant statistical differences between
controls and Alzheimer’s disease (�2 = 1.15 � 108, n1 = 12,
n2 = 17,
P 5 0.0001);
controls
and
PSP
(�2 = 975 547,
n1 = 12, n2 = 17, P 5 0.0001); and Alzheimer’s disease
and PSP (�2 = 733 030, n1 = 17, n2 = 17, P 5 0.0001).
The nature of these differences would be opaque without
abstraction techniques. Pairwise subtraction of the Fisher
transformed association matrices (Fig. 1, bottom) revealed
the presence of structure within the data, with both within-
lobe and between-lobe group differences. While one can
make general observations from these raw data, such as a
prominent reduction in cerebello-cerebellar and brainstem-
cerebellar connectivity in PSP, and a general reduction in
between-region connectivity in Alzheimer’s disease, the in-
sights would be limited. Instead, graph theoretic measures
allow one to examine which specific properties of the net-
work underpin disease-related differences. For this approach
each region in the brain becomes a node in a graph, which
is functionally connected to all other nodes with a finite
strength that is given by their pairwise correlation over
time. Each individual’s graph is then thresholded so that
the highest ‘x’ percentage of connections survive. Effects
are sought that are consistently present at a variety of net-
work thresholds. Here we examine network thresholds from
1 5 x 5 10%, representing a range of graphs from sparse to
dense. Very sparse graphs contain less information and can
miss important relationships. Conversely, very dense graphs
are more subject to noise and, when binarized, begin to
provide less meaningful information. Therefore, in what fol-
lows, we present the primary statistical analyses at an inter-
mediate density of 6%, with statistical detail given for this
density. To assess the robustness of effects to different
thresholding decisions we note separately the range of net-
work densities exhibiting statistical significance.
Findings in Alzheimer’s disease but
not PSP are consistent with trans-
neuronal spread of tau
We hypothesized that trans-neuronal spread of tau would
manifest as a positive relationship between
18F-AV-1451
and weighted degree. As we have parcellated the brain into
nodes of equal size, weighted degree is a measure of the

(Pearson’s r = 0.03, Spearman’s rho = 0.11) (Fig. 2C). These
patterns were present at all examined network density
thresholds.
It is important to acknowledge that the degree of a node
as defined by correlated activity is impacted by the size of
the connectivity network to which it belongs (Power et al.,
2013). Therefore, one concern might be that correlations
between 18F-AV-1451 and degree are driven by the coinci-
dence that Alzheimer’s disease happens to affect the default
mode network (DMN), which happens to be a large intrin-
sic connectivity network. To exclude this possibility, we
undertook two additional analyses. First, we re-examined
18F-AV-1451 and degree when nodes belonging to the
DMN were excluded; this did not abolish the strong rela-
tionship
(Pearson’s
r = 0.43,
P 5 0.0001).
Second,
we
examined the relationship within each intrinsic connectivity
network (Fig. 3). A strong positive relationship between
18F-AV-1451 and degree was seen in 9 of 10 networks
examined (Pearson’s r 5 0.4, P 5 0.0001). In contrast, no
strong positive correlations observed in any network in PSP
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Finally, in each group we examined the relationship be-
tween each node’s unthresholded connectivity strength and
18F-AV-1451 BPND (Supplementary Fig. 4). This is a local
measure of the strength of functional connectivity that does
not rely on thresholding the graph and therefore takes into
account both strong and weak connections. The pattern of
results observed in weighted degree was replicated; in
Alzheimer’s disease, a positive correlation was observed
(r = 0.28, P 5 0.0001), but no significant relationship was
observed in PSP (r = �0.05, P = 0.22) or controls (r = 0.04,
P = 0.31).
Findings in PSP but not Alzheimer’s
disease are consistent with selective
vulnerability
We hypothesized that tau accumulation due to metabolic
demand would manifest as a positive relationship between
18F-AV-1451 and weighted participation coefficient. This
was not observed in Alzheimer’s disease; in fact there was
a weak negative correlation (Pearson’s r = �0.18) (Fig. 4A).
In PSP, however, those nodes that displayed elevated
18F-AV-1451 were those that had the highest participation
coefficient (Fig. 4B).

 Similarly, we hypothesized that tau accumulation due to a
lack of trophic support would manifest as a negative rela-
tionship between 18F-AV-1451 and clustering coefficient. In
Alzheimer’s disease, the opposite relationship was observed;
strongly clustered nodes were more likely to display elevated
18F-AV-1451 binding (Pearson’s r = 0.33) (Fig. 5A).
Again, by contrast, in PSP those nodes that displayed
elevated 18F-AV-1451 were those that had the lowest clus-
tering coefficient (Fig. 5B).
Alzheimer’s disease and PSP have
opposite effects on the strength of
cortical functional connectivity
We assessed the impact of the presence of tau on connec-
tion strength at a variety of spatial scales. First, we aver-
aged weighted degree across the whole brain, resulting in a
single measure for each individual. As the overall number
of connections in each individual’s graph was thresholded
Figure 2 Weighted degree. (A–C) Group-averaged connection strength at each node, quantified by weighted degree, plotted against 18F-AV-
1451 binding potential at that node. A statistically significant linear relationship was demonstrated only in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Pearson’s
r = 0.48, P 5 0.0001, Spearman’s rho = 0.48, P 5 0.0001), and the corresponding regression line is plotted for this group. (D) Between-subjects
analysis of the relationship between global tau burden and each weighted degree at a network density of 6%. No significant relationship was found for
the control subjects with either method of assessing tau burden—for simplicity only their whole-brain average points are illustrated here. Moderation
analysis for a differential relationship between graph metric and tau burden in the two disease groups (Alzheimer’s disease and PSP) was statistically
significant. (E) The magnitude of disease-related change at each node is plotted as a single point, grouped by lobe. Control data are shown for both
methods of assessing tau burden. Stars represent statistically significant excesses of positive or negative gradients in the disease groups. (F) Average
18F-AV-1451 binding potential at each node. Red spheres represent increases compared to the cerebellar reference region. Blue spheres represent
decreases. The centre of the sphere is placed at the centre of the region of interest. The radius of each sphere is linearly related to the magnitude of
binding at that node. All groups are scaled identically. (G) The local tau burden-related change in weighted degree is plotted for each group at each
node. Red spheres represent local increases as a result of greater overall tau burden; blue spheres represent local decreases. The radius of each
sphere is linearly related to the magnitude of disease-related change at that node across the whole range of disease burden observed in each group.
All groups are scaled identically. Control images are based on the whole-brain method of assessing tau burden. (H) Average raw values for weighted
degree within each group. The control mean for each metric is subtracted at every node. Red spheres represent increases compared to the control

linearly related to the difference from the control mean at that node. All groups are scaled identically.

 at an identical network density, this measure represented
the average strength of the strongest x% of connections. To
assess global disease burden in Alzheimer’s disease we aver-
aged 18F-AV-1451 BPND across the whole brain. In PSP, we
averaged
18F-AV-1451 BPND across midbrain and basal
ganglia, reflecting the more focal distribution of disease
and our hypotheses about dissociated functional effects of
cortical and subcortical tau (Passamonti et al., 2017).
Confirmatory tests demonstrated that the pattern of the
moderation analyses below were unchanged if whole-
brain average 18F-AV-1451 BPND was used to assess tau
burden in PSP. Both methods of assessing tau burden were
independently assessed in the control group, with no sig-
nificant effects demonstrated in either case.
In Alzheimer’s disease, we found a negative correlation
between
average
connection
strength
and
tau
burden
(Pearson’s r = �0.58, P = 0.015) (Fig. 2D). In PSP this re-
lationship was reversed, with average connection strength
increasing in line with tau burden (r = 0.65, P = 0.004). No
relationship was observed in controls (r = �0.10, P = 0.75).
Moderation analysis confirmed a dissociated relationship
between tau and connection strength in Alzheimer’s disease
and
PSP
at
all
network
densities
[�r2 = 0.29,
F(1,30) = 19.0,
P = 0.0001;
after
partialling
out
age
(Supplementary
Fig.
5A)
�r2 = 0.28,
F(1,30) = 17.9,
P = 0.0002]. Therefore, while in Alzheimer’s disease the
presence of tau pathology causes the strongest functional
connections to weaken, in PSP, the presence of tau had the
opposite effect, i.e. to strengthen functional connections.
Second, we assessed the distribution of change by repeat-
ing the correlation of disease burden against weighted
degree at every individual node. We hypothesized that
this effect would be greatest in those regions that display
the strongest functional connectivity in the healthy brain,
and which we have demonstrated to accrue most tau in
Alzheimer’s disease. The gradient of this nodewise relation-
ship reflects a measure of local change in weighted degree
with disease burden (Fig. 2E). First, we examined whether
the whole-brain average relationship could be replicated in
these individual gradients, by performing sign tests. For
Alzheimer’s disease, a negative relationship was confirmed
(Z = �13.0, P 5 0.0001); for PSP there was a positive re-
lationship (Z = 14.8, P 5 0.0001); while for controls no
relationship was demonstrated using either whole brain
(Z = �1.1, P = 0.27) or deep brain (Z = 1.1, P = 0.27) tau
burden.
Next, we assessed whether the functional connectivity
change at each node related to local tau burden, by corre-
lating the gradient of the disease-related change in weighted
degree with the disease-associated increase in 18F-AV-1451
binding potential at each node (i.e. correlating each column
of Fig. 2F with the corresponding column of Fig. 2G). A
negative correlation between these measures was demon-
strated
in
Alzheimer’s
disease

 P 5 0.0001, Spearman’s rho = �0.24, P 5 0.0001). This re-
lationship was absent in PSP (Pearson’s r = �0.07, P = 0.11,
Spearman’s
rho = �0.00,
P = 0.98)
and
in
controls
(Pearson’s r = �0.01, P = 0.75, Spearman’s rho = �0.01,
P = 0.80). As well as being present at all examined network
densities, the negative correlation between disease-related
change in functional connectivity strength and tau burden
in Alzheimer’s disease was replicated in nodal connectivity
strength, the equivalent unthresholded measure (r = �0.34,
P 5 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 4B).
Finally, we assessed whether the functional connectivity
change at each node related to the strength of its connec-
tions in the healthy control brain (i.e. correlating each
patient panel of Fig. 2G with the control panel in Fig.
2H). As would be expected from the propensity of
highly connected nodes to accrue tau, a negative relation-
ship was demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease (Pearson’s
r = �0.23,
P 5 0.0001,
Spearman’s
rho = �0.24,
P 5 0.0001). Importantly, however, this relationship ex-
plained less variance than AV binding, with which we
have demonstrated it to be correlated. In PSP, a positive
relationship
was
demonstrated
(Pearson’s
r = 0.27,
P 5 0.0001, Spearman’s rho = 0.26, P 5 0.0001).
In
summary,
nodes
that
are
constitutionally
more
strongly connected to a larger volume of cortex are more
likely to accrue tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease but
not PSP. This relationship is independent of the connectiv-
ity network to which a node belongs. Once present, the tau
pathology appears to cause local functional connectivity
strength to fall. By contrast, in PSP tau selectively accumu-
lates in midbrain and deep nuclei, which has the conse-
quence
of
increasing
the
strength
of
cortico-cortical
functional connectivity, especially in those nodes that are
constitutionally highly connected.
Reorganization of cortical functional
connectivity reflects cortical versus
subcortical pathology
We hypothesized that the presence of subcortical pathology
in PSP might be causing an increase in weighted degree by
necessitating an increase in the relative strength of short--
range cortico-cortical connections as longer range connec-
tions
are
disrupted.
This
view
is
supported
by
the
observation that a consequence of increasing tau burden
in PSP is a marked reduction in participation coefficient
(Fig.
4D).
This
relationship
was
not
observed
in
Alzheimer’s disease, where increasing tau burden caused
increasing participation. Moderation analysis confirmed
this differential relationship at all network densities from
1% to 10% [�r2 = 0.21, F(1,30) = 7.6, P = 0.002; after par-
tialling
out
age
(Supplementary
Fig.
5B)
�r2 = 0.17,
F(1,30) = 8.3, P = 0.007].
We further examined this hypothesis by examining the
effect of tau on other measures of graph structure in each
individual,
dissociated
from
variation
in
degree
by
binarization after thresholding and normalization against
1000 random graphs with the same number of connections
at each node.
The clustering coefficient quantifies how many of a node’s
neighbours are neighbours of each other. All individuals in
all groups displayed clustering to at least 2.8� that of
random graphs of the same degree (Fig. 5D), consistent
with
a
small-world
connectivity
distribution.
While
in
Alzheimer’s disease a non-significant trend was observed to-
wards reduced clustering with increasing tau burden, in line
with previous reports (Stam et al., 2006; Sanz-Arigita et al.,
2010), in PSP the opposite relationship were observed.
Moderation analysis trended towards significance at the
density
of
primary
interest
[�r2 = 0.08,
F(1,30) = 3.8,
P = 0.06; after partialling out age (Supplementary Fig. 5C)
�r2 = 0.07, F(1,30) = 2.5, P = 0.09], and was significant
from 7% to 10% density. The betweenness centrality of a
node is a measure of the number of shortest paths between
any other two nodes that pass through it. If the presence of
subcortical pathology in PSP means that long-range informa-
tion transfer must occur through a transcortical route, aver-
age betweenness centrality should increase. Conversely,
predominantly cortical pathology in Alzheimer’s disease
might increase reliance on cortico-subcortical connections,
reducing average betweenness centrality. This prediction
was verified (Supplementary Fig. 6A), with a differential re-
lationship between tau burden and betweenness centrality
confirmed by moderation analysis at all network densities
from 1–10% [�r2 = 0.21, F(1,30) = 9.3, P = 0.005; after par-
tialling
out
age
(Supplementary
Fig.
5D)
�r2 = 0.20,
F(1,30) = 8.9, P = 0.006].
Long-range information transfer by a cortico-cortical
route implies an inefficient, indirect process, perhaps ac-
counting for the cognitive slowing characteristic of neuro-
degenerative
disorders
with
predominant
subcortical
pathology. We tested for this by examining closeness cen-
trality, which is the inverse of the path length between a
node and all other nodes in the graph. As would be pre-
dicted by this account, increasing disease burden resulted in
a higher average path length (lower closeness centrality) in
PSP but a lower average path length in Alzheimer’s disease
(higher closeness centrality) at network densities from 2%
to 10% [Fig. 6A, moderation �r2 = 0.20, F(1,30) = 9.1,
P = 0.005;
after
partialling
out
age
(Supplementary
Fig. 5E) �r2 = 0.16, F(1,30) = 8.0, P = 0.008]. Averaged
across the whole brain, this measure is equivalent to the
global efficiency of the graph, and indeed the same statis-
tical results were obtained from a moderation analysis of
that metric; increasing disease burden resulted in reduced
global efficiency in PSP.
While tau-mediated reorganization of connectivity in PSP
results in slower and less efficient long-range information
transfer, in Alzheimer’s disease one might suppose it to be a
beneficial consequence of the loss of overall connection
strength as those connections that remain are more globally
efficient. However, we hypothesized this would be at the
cost of local efficiency, which is a measure of the number of

 strong connections between neighbouring nodes and the
robustness of local networks to disruption. Indeed this
was found to be the case at network densities from 4%
to 10% [Fig. 7A, �r2 = 0.15, F(1,30) = 6.5, moderation
P = 0.016;
after

(Supplementary

Finally, we assessed the functional influence of each node
on the other nodes in the network by examining the
eigenvector centrality. Again, an opposite effect of disease
burden was observed in Alzheimer’s disease and PSP at
network densities from 3–10% [Supplementary Fig. 7A,
�r2 = 0.22, F(1,30) = 8.5, P = 0.007; after partialling out
age (Supplementary Fig. 5G) �r2 = 0.20, F(1,30) = 8.3,
P = 0.007] such that, on average, as PSP progressed each
node had less functional influence on every other node in
the graph.

 Local functional connectivity
reorganization is related to tau in
Alzheimer’s disease
To understand the differential reorganization of functional
connectivity in Alzheimer’s disease and PSP, we replicated
the approach taken for weighted degree; correlating the
gradient of the disease-related change at every individual
node with local change in 18F-AV-1451 binding potential.

 Supplementary Figs 6B and 7B). In all cases, controls
showed either no relationship or a weaker effect in the
same direction as patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
The reorganization of graph metrics followed two distinct
patterns. Closeness centrality (Fig. 6D) displayed a global
effect, with most nodes increasing in Alzheimer’s disease
and decreasing in PSP. This was not strongly related to
local 18F-AV-1451 binding potential in Alzheimer’s disease
(Pearson’s
r = 0.05,
P = 0.25,
Spearman’s
rho = 0.06,
P = 0.18) or PSP (Pearson’s r = 0.08, P = 0.06, Spearman’s
rho = 0.11, P = 0.01). Similarly, participation coefficient dis-
played global changes in both diseases (Fig. 4G) (Alzheimer’s

(Pearson’s

Strikingly, the positive relationship we demonstrated across
the whole brain masked opposing regional effects. As global
tau burden increased, the functional influence of frontal re-
gions on all other regions increased, while that of occipital
regions decreased. In PSP, no consistent relationship with
18F-AV-1451 was observed (Pearson’s r = �0.10, P = 0.02,
Spearman’s rho = �0.04, P = 0.38), with almost all regions
having less functional influence on all other regions as tau
burden increased.

Discussion
We have demonstrated that in Alzheimer’s disease a strong
relationship exists between the propensity of a node to dis-
play elevated
18F-AV-1451 binding and the volume of
cortex to which it is strongly connected (Fig. 2A). Further,
we have demonstrated that this effect exists both within and
between intrinsic connectivity networks (Fig. 3). This is con-
sistent with the theory of trans-neuronal spread. The pre-
dictions of the competing hypotheses that highly active
brain regions are vulnerable to tau accumulation due to a
positive relationship with metabolic demand (Fig. 4A) or
negative relationship with clustering due to a lack of trophic
support (Fig. 5A) were not supported by the data.
In contrast, in PSP, we have demonstrated the opposite
findings. Those brain regions that accrue most tau display
weak connectivity (Fig. 2B), but are predicted to have high
metabolic demand (Fig. 4B) and a lack of trophic support
(Fig. 5B).
Further, we have explored the consequences of tau accu-
mulation with cross-sectional analyses at a variety of spatial
scales. In Alzheimer’s disease, we have demonstrated that with
greater levels of tau pathology the strongest internodal con-
nections are weakened (Fig. 2G). This reorganization of the
brain network leads to more direct long-range connections
passing through fewer nodes (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. 6A), at the cost of lower local efficiency (Fig. 7A)
In PSP, where tau accumulation is predominantly subcor-
tical, we demonstrate the opposite reorganization of the
connectivity graph. With greater levels of tau in midbrain
and deep nuclei (Fig. 2F), the strongest functional connec-
tions are strengthened; these are predominantly cortical
(Fig. 2G and H). Information transfer therefore takes a
less direct path (Supplementary Fig. 6A), passing through
a larger number of cortical nodes en route (Fig. 4A), as

assessing tau burden. (E) Average raw values for local efficiency within each group. The control mean for each metric is subtracted at every node.
Red spheres represent increases compared to the control mean value. Blue spheres represent decreases. The centre of the sphere is placed at the

 connectivity. This is accompanied by a decrease in partici-
pation coefficient (Fig. 4D) and an increase in clustering
(Fig. 5D) as connectivity becomes increasingly modular.
Insights into the mechanisms of
disease progression in humans
It has been proposed that the pathological mechanisms
underlying Alzheimer’s disease begin in a single, vulnerable
location and spread from cell to cell, rather than occurring
independently in a large number of vulnerable cell popula-
tions (Guo and Lee, 2014; Goedert, 2015). The primary
direct evidence for such propagation of tau comes from
rodent studies. For example, the injection of brain extract
from transgenic mice expressing mutant tau into mice ex-
pressing wild-type human tau caused wild-type tau to form
filaments
and
spread
to
neighbouring
brain
regions
(Clavaguera et al., 2009). Further, pathological tau from
human brains causes disease in wild-type mice, in which
the pathological human tau species becomes self-propagat-
ing (Clavaguera et al., 2013). This tau propagation is
mediated by the presence and strength of synaptic connect-
ivity rather than spatial proximity (Liu et al., 2012; Iba
et al., 2013; Ahmed et al., 2014).
Associative studies of the healthy brain have demon-
strated that large-scale, functionally connected neural net-
works strongly resemble the known patterns of atrophy in
distinct neurodegenerative syndromes mediated by tau and
TDP-43 (Zhou et al., 2012). Further human evidence
comes from the observation that patterns of atrophy in
the rare disease non-fluent variant primary progressive
aphasia (nfvPPA) strongly correspond to structural and
functional connectivity in the healthy speech production
network (Mandelli et al., 2016). This is an important ob-
servation, because clinically and radiologically indistin-
guishable cases of nfvPPA can be caused either by tau or
by the unrelated protein TAR DNA-binding protein 43
(TDP-43), which has been demonstrated to propagate
trans-neuronally (Braak et al., 2013).
Here, we go beyond these associative studies to measure
tau burden and functional connectivity in the same individ-
uals at both the whole-brain and regional level. Our obser-
vation
that
those
brain
areas
that
are
more
strongly
functionally connected have accrued more tau pathology in
Alzheimer’s disease (Fig. 2A), independent of which connect-
ivity network they belong to (Fig. 3), is consistent with trans-
neuronal spread. We demonstrate that the presence of tau is
not, in itself, inducing stronger regional connectivity by our
cross-sectional analysis of the Alzheimer’s disease group, in
which we demonstrate that as cortical tau accumulates the
overall functional connectivity of cortex falls (Fig. 2D), and
this between-subjects effect is strongest in those brain regions
with most tau accumulation (Fig. 2F and G). Crucially, we
demonstrate that
18F-AV-1451 binding potential at each
node is better than the connectivity of that node in the
healthy
brain
at
accounting
for

variance
in
connectivity change, arguing against the presence of tau
being a secondary marker of neurodegeneration in vulnerable
hubs. In other words, it is not coincidence that Alzheimer’s
disease tends to impact large networks; it is a predictable
consequence of trans-neuronal spread of a disease-causing
protein. Graph theoretic models of transmissible disease epi-
demics are in agreement that the likelihood of an individual
becoming infected (and the dose of the infectious agent
received) is directly proportional to its number of infected
neighbours and their infectivity (Durrett, 2010). As our
nodes represent brain regions of equal volume, the binary
portion of degree represents a surrogate measure of the
number of neurons to which a brain region is connected,
and the weighted portion of degree is a measure of the
strength of these connections. By the time Alzheimer’s disease
is sufficiently advanced to cause the symptoms of MCI, tau is
generally already present to some degree throughout the neo-
cortex (Markesbery, 2010), and therefore reaching a disease
stage at which the number of neighbours more closely ap-
proximates the number of infected neighbours, and the con-
nection
strength between infected
neighbours
(here
the
weighted portion of degree) becomes a strong driver of
infectivity.
Conversely, our analyses do not provide support for
models of hub vulnerability due to metabolic demand or
lack of trophic support in Alzheimer’s disease. It is import-
ant to acknowledge that this does not mean that these
mechanisms are unimportant, but rather that they are a
downstream event of tau accumulation. In other words,
while we demonstrate that the propensity of a node to
accrue tau is not related to metabolic demand or trophic
support, these factors might still contribute to determining
the vulnerability of brain regions to the presence of a given
amount of tau. This hypothesis could be addressed in
future studies by relating the information content of tau
ligand binding to other measures of neurodegeneration
such as longitudinal changes in grey matter volume.
In PSP, we do find support for models of hub vulnerabil-
ity due to metabolic demand and lack of trophic support,
but not for models of trans-neuronal spread. This is in line
with other recent studies, demonstrating that neurodegen-
eration in PSP is related to local gene expression patterns
(Rittman et al., 2016).
Is the difference between Alzheimer’s
disease and PSP mediated by tau
isoform or intrinsic connectivity?
A striking feature of our results is that we demonstrate a
strong relationship between 18F-AV-1451 binding potential
and the strength of functional connectivity in Alzheimer’s
disease but not PSP. There are at least two potential (and
not mutually exclusive) explanations for this dissociation.
The first possibility is that trans-neuronal tau propaga-
tion might occur more slowly in PSP. Cellular models have
demonstrated that the propensity of tau to propagate

 intracellularly depends on its ability to form aggregates
(Falcon et al., 2015). Once present in a new cell, the ability
of tau fibrils to induce the aggregation of constitutionally
present tau depends on the conformation of the fibril struc-
ture (Nonaka et al., 2010; Fitzpatrick et al., 2017). It might
be that the straight filaments of predominantly 4R tau that
characterize PSP are simply less able to propagate or need
to be present in higher concentrations before they can
induce a chain reaction of local tau aggregation (Guo
et al., 2016). This view is supported by our demonstration
that tau is restricted to brainstem and deep nuclei in PSP
despite these nodes being highly promiscuous between net-
works, displaying a high participation coefficient (Fig. 4B)
and low clustering (Fig. 5B).
Second, it is possible that tau propagation does occur,
but that it is limited in range to a subcortical intrinsic con-
nectivity network (Raj et al., 2012) (perhaps network 5 in
Laird et al., 2011). Such a subcortical network may be
poorly visualized by multi-echo functional MRI, and is
less frequently observed at rest than the DMN (Greicius
et al., 2003), which has been implicated in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (Greicius et al., 2004). Together, therefore, our find-
ings of weak functional connectivity in deep nuclei and
brainstem nodes (Fig. 2B) might mask meaningful func-
tional connectivity within and between these regions, ac-
counting for the restricted and stereotyped pattern of tau
accumulation in early PSP (Ellison et al., 2012) and cortical
escape in advanced PSP (Schofield et al., 2012).
Cross-sectional data reveals patterns
less visible at the group level
Computational modelling of connectivity-dependent cell
death predicts a dissociation between changes in functional
connectivity in early and late Alzheimer’s disease (de Haan
et al., 2012). It has been proposed that, in early disease,
hubs compensate for declines in structural connectivity by
increasing their firing rate, manifesting as stronger func-
tional connectivity (Maestu
´ et al., 2015). As disease pro-
gresses, this mechanism breaks down as neural damage
prevents the maintenance of this metabolically demanding
compensation (Jones et al., 2015). This dissociation is
thought to underlie some of the seemingly inconsistent find-
ings in the analysis of graph properties in neurodegenera-
tive disease. By using a cross-sectional approach across a
range of disease severity, we demonstrate relationships con-
sistent
with
this
hypothesis.
In
Alzheimer’s
disease,
weighted degree (Fig. 2D) and betweenness centrality
(Supplementary Fig. 6A) consistently fall as tau burden in-
creases. However, in early disease where tau burden is low
(our sample includes a range of severity, including PiB-posi-
tive MCI), the regression line for these metrics is above the
control average. Similarly, examining the regional changes
related to disease burden reveals striking patterns that are
obscured at the group level. This underlines the more gen-
eral principal that one should be cautious in interpreting a
main effect of group in the presence of an interaction, or
correlation with severity.
Reorganization of brain networks
Our examination of two distinct tau-mediated neurodegen-
erative pathologies with different distributions of pathology
has enabled us to distinguish their consequences. We dem-
onstrate strongly opposing effects in a range of metrics re-
sulting
from
the
presence
of
predominantly
cortical
(Alzheimer’s disease) or subcortical (PSP) tau. The direction
of these effects in Alzheimer’s disease is consistent with the
previously recognized impact of neurodegeneration, leading
to increasingly random cortical connectivity (Sanz-Arigita
et al., 2010; Stam, 2014) and a reduction in small-world
properties (Stam et al., 2006). Eigenvector centrality showed
particularly strong regional effects in Alzheimer’s disease,
with a negative correlation observed between disease-related
changes in this metric and local tau burden at each node—
i.e. those brain regions that displayed less tau pathology had
greater functional influence on other brain regions.
In contrast, cortico-subcortical functional connectivity is
preferentially impaired in PSP-Richardson’s syndrome, re-
sulting in cerebral information transfer taking a less direct
path through a larger number of cortical nodes, reducing
closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality, but increas-
ing cortical degree, betweenness centrality and local effi-
ciency. This results in an excessively modular connectivity
arrangement, with decreasing participation coefficient and
increasing clustering. These findings tie together classical
observations of the ‘subcortical dementia’ phenotype of
PSP (Albert et al., 1974) with more modern observations
that behavioural change and cognitive impairment in PSP
correlates with frontal cortical hypometabolism (D’Antona
et al., 1985; Foster et al., 1988) and atrophy (Cordato
et al., 2002, 2005). We propose that increases in cortical
functional connectivity can compensate for subcortical tau
burden in PSP. Increasingly indirect information transfer
accounts for the cognitive slowing that is the hallmark of
the ‘subcortical dementias’, but performance on untimed
tests is preserved until cortical regions become atrophic in
late disease.
Study limitations
The main limitation of our analysis is that it is cross-sec-
tional, and we use
18F-AV-1451 binding as a surrogate
marker of tau burden. By making observations about the
relationship between tau burden and functional connectiv-
ity in this way, we assume a uniformity of effect within our
disease groups. As novel PET ligands such as 18F-AV-1451
gain maturity, longitudinal assessment of tau burden and
functional connectivity in the same individuals will be an
important and powerful validation of our results. Definite
evidence of the causal relationship between tau and con-
nectivity with require the combination of longitudinal as-
sessment and interventional studies targeting tau pathology.

 It should also be noted that 18F-AV-1451 binding identifies
predominantly aggregated tau in tangles, and does not dir-
ectly measure oligomeric tau, which may be more toxic to
the cell and synaptic plasticity, nor extracellular forms of
tau that may mediate spread of pathology. The molecular
binding target of 18F-AV-1451 in non-Alzheimer’s disease
tauopathies is disputed; elevated ‘off-target’ binding has
been demonstrated in the basal ganglia of healthy controls
(Johnson et al., 2016), albeit to a lesser degree than that
observed in PSP (Fig. 2F) (Passamonti et al., 2017), and in
TDP-43 associated disorders without evident tau pathology
(Bevan-Jones et al., 2017a). Nonetheless, 18F-AV-1451 is
able to recapitulate the distribution of post-mortem neuro-
pathology in these disorders, making it appropriate for use
here (Smith et al., 2016).
Our analysis is focused towards cortico-cortical functional
connectivity. In particular, multi-echo MRI might have a
poor signal-to-noise ratio in deep brain structures, although
the main advantage of using this sequence is that it enables
robust de-noising of movement-related artefacts pipeline
(Kundu et al., 2012, 2013). This is critical in clinical popu-
lations, in which functional MRI data may differentially
suffer from quality degradation due to head movements.
Finally, by examining proportionately thresholded graphs
with 1–10% density, our analysis focusses on the strongest
interregional functional connections. However, it is possible
that we are missing additional effects of neurodegeneration
on weak or medium-strength connections. Tract-tracing
studies indicate that there are weak anatomical connec-
tions, equivalent to a few axons, between some cortical
areas (Ypma and Bullmore, 2016). Such weak links may
have
functional
importance
in
complex
networks
(Granovetter, 1983). However, weak connections are diffi-
cult to evaluate with functional MRI, as it is not possible to
disentangle them from correlation arising from signal noise.
Future evaluation of these weaker connections with in vivo
tractography, neuropathology or novel methods might
reveal additional effects not evident in our dataset. In the
interim, the thresholding procedure retains several advan-
tages; by retaining only the most strongly correlated edges
one is less likely to include false positive correlations and
topologically random edges. It also allows the computa-
tionally intense process of normalization of metrics against
random graphs of equal density. The consistency between
the results using thresholded nodal weighted degree and
unthresholded nodal connectivity strength provides reassur-
ance in the choice of thresholding of connections.
Conclusion
This study reveals the differential relationship between tau
burden and functional connectivity in two distinct human
neurodegenerative tauopathies. Our results enable us to dis-
entangle the causes of tau accumulation from their conse-
quences. They have wide-ranging implications, from the
validation of models of tau trafficking in humans to
corroborating computational models of hub compensation
in Alzheimer’s disease, while accounting for the contrasting
cognitive phenotype of these two conditions. These insights
into the relationship between tau burden and brain con-
nectivity changes will inform translational models and clin-
ical trials of disease-modifying therapies.
