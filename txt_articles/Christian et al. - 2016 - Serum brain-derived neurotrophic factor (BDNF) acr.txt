Abstract
Background—Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated as a causal factor in 
major depression and is critical to placental development during pregnancy. Longitudinal data on 
BDNF across the perinatal period are lacking. These data are of interest given the potential 
implications for maternal mood and fetal growth, particularly among Black women who show ~2-
fold greater risk for delivering low birth weight infants.
Methods—Serum BDNF, serum cortisol, and depressive symptoms (per CES-D) were assessed 
during each trimester and 4–11 weeks postpartum among 139 women (77 Black, 62 White). Low 
birth weight (<2500 g) was determined via medical record.
Results—Serum BDNF declined considerably from 1st through 3rd trimesters (ps ≤ 0.008) and 
subsequently increased at postpartum (p < 0.001). Black women exhibited significantly higher 
serum BDNF during the 1st trimester, 2nd trimester, and postpartum (ps ≤ 0.032) as well as lower 
serum cortisol during the 2nd and 3rd trimester (ps ≤ 0.01). Higher serum cortisol was 
concurrently associated with lower serum BDNF in the 2nd trimester only (p < 0.05). Controlling

 for race, serum BDNF at both the 2nd and 3rd trimester was negatively associated with 3rd 
trimester depressive symptoms (ps ≤ 0.02). In addition, women delivering low versus healthy 
weight infants showed significantly lower serum BDNF in the 3rd trimester (p = 0.004). Women 
delivering low versus healthy weight infants did not differ in depressive symptoms at any time 
point during pregnancy (ps ≥ 0.34).
Conclusions—Serum BDNF declines considerably across pregnancy in Black and White 
women, with overall higher levels in Blacks. Lower serum BDNF in late pregnancy corresponds 
with higher depressive symptoms and risk for low birth weight in Black and White women. 
However, the predictive value of serum BDNF in pregnancy is specific to within-race 
comparisons. Potential links between racial differences in serum BDNF and differential 
pregnancy-related cortisol adaptation require further investigation.

1. Introduction
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin involved in the modulation of 
synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation in the brain (Nagahara and Tuszynski, 2011). 
In addition, BDNF serves unique functions during pregnancy, as it is important for follicular 
development, implantation, and placentation within reproductive tissues (Kawamura et al., 
2007; Kawamura et al., 2009; Mayeur et al., 2010). Two cross-sectional studies with sample 
sizes ≤80 reported median serum BDNF levels to be 30–50% lower among pregnant versus 
non-pregnant women in late pregnancy (≥28 weeks gestation) (Kim et al., 2012; 
Lommatzsch et al., 2006). Data demonstrating the trajectory of change in serum BDNF 
across pregnancy and postpartum are lacking. These data would inform understanding of 
typical versus atypical adaptation in serum BDNF and implications for perinatal mental 
health and pregnancy outcomes.
A sizable literature supports a relationship between BDNF and depression in non-pregnant 
adults (Bocchio-Chiavetto et al., 2010; Brunoni et al., 2008; Molendijk et al., 2014; Sen et 
al., 2008). The neurotrophin hypothesis posits that stress-induced reductions in BDNF result 
in aberrant neurogenesis and subsequent major depression (Duman et al., 1997; Duman and 
Monteggia, 2006) and concentrations of BDNF in serum/plasma are related to BDNF 
activity in the brain (Klein et al., 2011; Sartorius et al., 2009). A meta-analysis of 55 studies 
concluded that there is a consistent relationship between low serum BDNF and depression as 
well as increases in serum BDNF following antidepressant treatment, with stronger effects 
among those showing greater improvement in depressive symptoms (Molendijk et al., 2014). 
Though limited, some data indicate that relationships between low serum BDNF and 
depressive symptoms are also observed during pregnancy and postpartum (Fung et al., 2015; 
Gazal et al., 2012). However, available data are cross-sectional, preventing examination of 
temporal associations or stability of relationships in the midst of significant pregnancy-
associated physiological adaptation.

 In addition to potential implications for perinatal mood, low BDNF bioavailability has been 
implicated in placental pathology; lower placental BDNF gene expression has been observed 
in women with preeclampsia which may have implications for impaired placental 
development observed in this context (D’Souza et al., 2014). BDNF plays an important role 
in healthy placental development through promotion of trophoblast invasion (Kawamura et 
al., 2007; Kawamura et al., 2009; Mayeur et al., 2010). The syncytiotrophoblast – the 
specialized transporting multinucleate epithelium of the placenta – is critical in nutrient 
transfer and removal of waste products to promote fetal growth (Sibley et al., 2010). Thus, it 
has been posited that lower maternal BDNF may result in impaired fetal growth (Kawamura 
et al., 2007; Kawamura et al., 2009; Mayeur et al., 2011; Mayeur et al., 2010). Of clinical 
importance, consistent and marked racial disparities in low birth weight (<2,500 g or 5.5 lbs) 
are evidenced in the US; approximately 13% of non-Hispanic Black infants are born at low 
birth weight compared to 7% of non-Hispanic White infants (March of Dimes Peristats). 
Thus, the potential role of BDNF in this racial disparity merits examination.
Addressing gaps in the current literature, this study examined serum BDNF longitudinally 
with assessment during each trimester of pregnancy and at 4–11 weeks postpartum in a 
racially diverse sample of 139 women (77 Black, 62 White). The trajectory of change in 
serum BDNF across time was examined. It was hypothesized that lower serum BDNF would 
be associated with higher depressive symptoms as well as increased risk for low birth 
weight. In addition, given data linking cortisol with suppressed BDNF production, and the 
robust increases in maternal cortisol observed in pregnancy, the association between serum 
BDNF and serum cortisol were examined. Throughout analyses, potential differential effects 
among Black versus White women were examined.
2. Methods and materials
2.1. Study design and participants
This study enrolled 144 pregnant women who were recruited from The Ohio State 
University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) Prenatal Clinic and the community of 
Columbus, Ohio. Data collection occurred from 2009 to 2014. Study visits were conducted 
at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, as well as 4–11 weeks postpartum. At each visit, participants 
provided a blood sample and completed demographic and psychosocial measures.
Women were ineligible if they had any known fetal anomaly, used illicit drugs, consumed 
more than two alcoholic drinks per week during pregnancy (per self-report or medical 
record), or had a major immunological or endocrine condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, 
hypothyroidism). Women were excluded from the current analyses if they missed more than 
two study visits (n = 5); thus, analyses were conducted with 139 women. Informed consent 
was obtained at the first study visit, and participants received modest financial compensation 
at the completion of each visit. The study was approved by The Ohio State University 
Biomedical Institutional Review Board.

 2.2. Demographics
Race/ethnicity, age, marital status, education, annual household income, and parity were 
collected by self-report at first study visit. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) 
was calculated utilizing self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and height measured at the first 
study visit.
2.3. Depressive symptoms
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a widely used and well-
validated measure consisting of 20 items assessing cognitive, emotional, and somatic 
depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977). The CES-D has shown predictive validity for 
physiological processes (e.g., serum proinflammatory cytokines) as well as health outcomes 
(e.g., preterm birth) in pregnancy in prior studies (Christian et al., 2009; Christian et al., 
2010; Li et al., 2009; Orr et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 2010).
2.4. Health behaviors
Smoking, exercise, prenatal vitamin use, and antidepressant use were assessed via self-report 
at the first study visit. Smoking was defined as current or not current, including those who 
had never smoked. Exercise was operationalized as the frequency with which the participant 
engaged in a vigorous activity long enough to build up a sweat. Prenatal vitamin use was 
categorized as never, 1–3 days per week, 4–6 days per week, or 7 days per week. 
Antidepressant use within the last year was dichotomized as yes or no.
2.5. Blood parameters
Blood was primarily drawn between the hours of 0700 h and 1300 h (93% of draws), 
allowed to clot at room temperature, centrifuged, and serum aliquoted and stored at −80°C 
until assayed. Samples were all run at the same time with kits from the same lot. All samples 
from the same participant were batched together (i.e., run on the same plate). Serum BDNF 
was measured by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to 
manufacturer instructions (R&D Systems, Inc. 614 McKinley Place NE, Minneapolis, MN) 
and using a spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation Spectra Max 
190, 1311 Orleans Drive, Sunnyvale, California USA). The lower limit of detection was 20 
pg/ml. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation are 5% and 9%, respectively.
Serum cortisol was measured by solid-phase competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay 
and the Immulite 1000 per manufacturer instructions (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., 
1717 Deerfield Rd., Deerfield, IL.). Analytical sensitivity was 0.2 ug/dL. Intra-assay and 
inter-assay coefficients of variation were 7.1% and 7.9%, respectively.
2.6. Birth outcomes
Birth weight and gestational age at delivery were obtained by medical record review. Infants 
weighing <2500 g were categorized as low birth weight.

 2.7. Statistical analyses
Serum BDNF levels were log-transformed (base 10) to fit the normality assumption. 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all participants. Data at all four study visits were 
available for 72.7% (n = 101), while 21.6% (n = 30) and 5.8% (n = 8) of participants had 
missing data at one or two study visits, respectively. Thus, data were missing from 46 of 556 
study assessments (7.7%). In addition, two women were excluded from birth weight 
analyses because medical records following delivery were unavailable. To account for 
missing data, prior to analyses, missing values for CES-D scores, BDNF levels, and serum 
cortisol levels were imputed using multiple imputation procedures in SPSS 22. Five 
imputations were generated and results across the five imputed datasets were averaged to 
arrive at the final statistical values (Rubin, 2004). To examine differences between Black and 
White women on the demographic variables and health behaviors, t-tests and chi-square tests 
were conducted. Partial correlations were employed to assess the relationship between 
depressive symptoms and serum BDNF at each time point. Repeated measures ANOVAs 
were used to examine serum BDNF and cortisol levels across pregnancy and postpartum, 
including their associations with race, depressive symptoms, and low birth weight, as 
appropriate. Bivariate correlations were used to examine the relationship between serum 
BDNF and serum cortisol at each study visit. Logistic regressions were conducted to 
examine whether serum BDNF at any study visit during pregnancy subsequently predicted 
low birth weight.
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics
Study visits occurred in the 1st trimester (12.0 ± 1.89 weeks), 2nd trimester (21.7 ± 2.2 
weeks), 3rd trimester (30.3 ± 2.0 weeks), and postpartum (7.6 ± 1.82 weeks). In this sample, 
55% (n = 77) were Black and 45% (n = 62) were White, including 5 White women 
endorsing Hispanic ethnicity. Black and White women did not differ on their age, education, 
or pre-pregnancy BMI; however, Black women were more likely to be unmarried, to report a 
household income ≤$15,000, and to be multiparous (Table 1). In terms of health behaviors, 
no racial differences in smoking status or exercise frequency were observed. However, Black 
women reported less use of prenatal vitamins (Table 2). Antidepressant use within the year 
prior to pregnancy was reported by 11 women, with only 2 women reporting continued use 
after pregnancy was known. Overall, 13 women delivered low birth weight infants (8 Black, 
5 White). Of these 13 infants, 7 (54%) were also born preterm ( < 37 weeks gestation).
3.2. Serum BDNF across pregnancy and postpartum
Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant quadratic pattern of change in serum 
BDNF over the course of pregnancy and postpartum (F(1137) = 122.58, p < 0.001) as well 
as a main effect of race (F(1137) = 7.78, p = 0.006). Post-hoc comparisons showed that 
serum BDNF significantly declined from the 1st to 2nd trimester (p = 0.008), declined 
further from 2nd to 3rd trimester (p = 0.002), and subsequently increased at postpartum (p < 
0.001). In addition, Black women exhibited significantly higher serum BDNF levels than 
White women during the 1st trimester (p = 0. 021), 2nd trimester (p = 0. 032), and at 
postpartum (p = 0. 021).

 3.3. Depressive symptoms and serum BDNF across pregnancy and postpartum
Black and White women did not differ in depressive symptoms at any study visit (ps > 0.31). 
Given the observed racial differences in serum BDNF, the relationship between depressive 
symptoms and serum BDNF was examined utilizing partial correlations controlling for race. 
During the 3rd trimester assessment, depressive symptoms and serum BDNF were inversely 
associated (r = −0.17, p = 0.045). Analyses of CES-D subscales demonstrated that this effect 
was driven by depressed mood (r = −0.21, p = 0.02) and somatic symptoms (r = −0.17, p = 
0.06), rather than positive symptoms (r = −0.11, p = 0.23) or interpersonal symptoms (r = 
−0.09, p = 0.30). No concurrent associations were observed between depressive symptoms 
and serum BDNF at other time points (ps ≤ 0.60).
Next, non-concurrent associations were examined to determine whether lower serum BDNF 
was predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms. Controlling for race, serum BDNF 
during the 1st trimester was not associated with depressive symptoms at later time points (ps 
≤ 0.25). However, also controlling for race, lower serum BDNF at the 2nd trimester 
predicted higher depressive symptoms at the 3rd trimester (r = −0.25, p = 0.005). This effect 
remained after controlling for depressive symptoms during the 2nd trimester (r = −0.31, p = 
0.001), indicating that lower serum BDNF at mid-pregnancy preceded the onset of 
depressive symptoms in late pregnancy. No associations were observed between serum 
BNDF at the 2nd or 3rd trimester for depressive symptoms at postpartum (ps ≤ 0.11)
Given the relationship between depressive symptoms and serum BDNF at 3rd trimester, the 
trajectory of serum BDNF across pregnancy and postpartum was examined by 
dichotomizing groups using a median split on depressive symptoms at this time point. 
Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a differential quadratic trajectory of change 
among women with higher versus lower depressive symptoms in late pregnancy (F(1126) = 
4.15, p = 0.044) (Fig. 1). In follow-up sensitivity analyses, effects were unchanged when 
women who reported antidepressant use within the year prior to study initiation (n = 11) 
were excluded.
3.4. Serum BDNF and low birth weight
In this sample, 9.49% (n = 13) of women delivered infants of low birth weight (< 2500 g). 
Rates of low birth weight did not differ significantly by race, with occurrence in 5/61 (8.2%) 
of Whites and 8/76 (10.5%) of Blacks (p = 0.77). Repeated measures ANOVA showed main 
effects for low birth weight (F(1133) = 4.97, p = 0.027) as well as the previously described 
main effect for race (F(1133) = 3.63, p = 0.06) in predicting serum BDNF levels. In post-hoc 
test one-way ANOVAs, controlling for race, women delivering low birth weight infants did 
not differ from those delivering healthy weight infants in serum BDNF at the 1st (F (1134) = 
0.63, p = 0.43) or 2nd (F(1134) = 2.28, p = 0.13) trimesters but exhibited markedly lower 
serum BDNF during the 3rd trimester (F(1134) = 8.4, p = 0.004; Fig. 2). Further, logistic 
regression showed that, controlling for race, each 100 pg/ml lower serum BNDF in the 3rd 
trimester predicted 3.5 times greater odds of delivering a low birth weight infant (p = 0.009). 
This finding remained significant after controlling for gestational age at delivery (p = 0.017).

 3.5. Low birth weight and depressive symptoms
Finally, we examined the relationship between birth weight and depressive symptoms to 
determine the extent to which these parameters shared common pathways. In this sample, 
women who delivered low birth weight infants did not differ from those delivering healthy 
weight infants in depressive symptoms at any time point during pregnancy (ps ≥ 0.23). 
However, they did exhibit higher depressive symptoms at postpartum (Mean = 17.0 vs 11.1; 
p = 0.04).
3.6. Serum cortisol, race, and serum BDNF
Analyses were conducted to examine a potential role of differential cortisol adaption in the 
reported racial differences in serum BDNF. Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that, 
as expected and shown in Fig. 3, a quadratic pattern in cortisol was observed (F(1137) = 
492.53, p < 0.001), with increases from the 1st and 2nd (p < 0.001) as well as the 2nd and 
3rd trimesters (p < 0.001), followed by a decline from 3rd trimester to postpartum (p < 
0.001). Moreover, Black women exhibited a different quadratic change over time than 
Whites (F(1137) = 7.12, p = 0.009). Specifically, Black women exhibited lower serum 
cortisol than White women at both the 2nd (p = 0.01) and 3rd trimesters (p = 0.002; Fig. 3).
The relationship between cortisol and serum BDNF at each study visit was examined using 
partial correlations controlling for time of sampling. As shown in Table 3, higher serum 
cortisol in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy was associated with lower serum BDNF during the 
1st trimester (p < 0.05), 2nd trimester (p < 0.05), and marginally at postpartum (p = 0.07). In 
addition, lower serum BDNF in the 1st trimester was associated with lower serum cortisol 
during the 3rd trimester (p < 0.05). No other significant associations were observed.
4. Discussion
The current data demonstrate a clear trajectory of change in serum BDNF across the 
perinatal period, with considerable declines from the 1st through 3rd trimesters and a 
subsequent increase at postpartum. Our data extend prior, primarily cross-sectional, studies 
showing markedly lower serum BDNF levels in women during late pregnancy compared to 
non-pregnant women (Kim et al., 2012; Lommatzsch et al., 2006). Our findings contrast a 
prior longitudinal study of 42 women from Bogotá, Columbia which showed increases in 
serum BNDF from the 1st to 2nd trimester, with no significant change between 2nd and 3rd 
trimester (Garcés et al., 2014). The reason for this discrepancy is unknown but may relate to 
differences in assay methodology.
The trajectory observed in the current investigation is consistent with the role of BDNF 
(Kawamura et al., 2007; Kawamura et al., 2009; Mayeur et al., 2010); declining levels across 
gestation may, in part, reflect utilization of maternal BDNF by the placenta and fetus. In 
relation to fetal development, BDNF crosses the utero-placental barrier and animal models 
show that maternal circulating levels of BDNF correspond with fetal brain levels (Kodomari 
et al., 2009). Pregnancy-induced hemodilution may also contribute; serum BDNF is stored in 
platelets, and platelet counts decrease during pregnancy (Fujimura et al., 2002). Thus, this 
may be a factor in the observed drop in serum BDNF across the course of pregnancy. Lack

 of data on platelet counts is a limitation; this should be considered in conjunction with serum 
BDNF levels in future pregnancy studies. In addition, sex hormones may play a role; 
estradiol and progesterone increase considerably across pregnancy (O’Leary et al., 1991). 
Some data suggest that fluctuations in circulating BDNF levels during the menstrual cycle 
correspond with changes in sex hormones (Pluchino et al., 2009). In addition, pregnancy is 
characterized by robust increases in cortisol. Heighted cortisol as well as overexpression of 
glucocorticoid receptors has been implicated in reduced BDNF production/mRNA 
expression in some studies (Issa et al., 2010; Ridder et al., 2005; Smith et al., 1995b). 
Overall, mechanisms underlying pregnancy-related changes remain to be fully determined.
Notably, in the current study, Black women exhibited higher levels of serum BDNF than 
White women during the 1st trimester, 2nd trimester, and at postpartum. This effect was not 
accounted for by racial differences in demographic factors or health behaviors. This finding 
was opposite of the expected direction; given that BDNF production/mRNA expression is 
impaired by stressor exposure (Smith et al., 1995a; Yulug et al., 2009), it was predicted that 
Black women would exhibit lower levels than Whites. Genetic factors may contribute to this 
racial difference; in particular, considerable differences in the frequency of BDNF 
(Val66Met) variants have been documented among those of European versus African 
ancestry (Petryshen et al., 2010).
Moreover, in the context of pregnancy, adaptation of multiple interactive aspects of 
neuroendocrine function may ultimately contribute to serum BNDF levels. Consistent with 
prior data (Glynn et al., 2007), we found that Black women exhibited less robust pregnancy-
induced increases in cortisol across the course of gestation than Whites. As noted above, 
cortisol may reduce BDNF production. In the current study, higher serum cortisol in the 2nd 
trimester was associated with lower serum BDNF during the 1st trimester, 2nd trimester, and 
(marginally) at postpartum. In addition, lower serum BDNF in the 1st trimester was 
associated with higher serum cortisol in the 3rd trimester. While these relationships were in 
the expected direction (i.e., inverse associations), they were primarily non-concurrent and 
not consistently observed. Thus, it is plausible that differential pregnancy-related cortisol 
adaptation is related to the observed racial difference in serum BDNF, but this requires 
further investigation.
In relation to mood, a concurrent inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and 
serum BDNF was observed during the 3rd trimester only. In addition, depressive symptoms 
during the 3rd trimester were preceded by lower serum BDNF in the 2nd trimester. These 
data support a temporal relationship between declines in serum BDNF and subsequent onset 
of depressive symptoms, and suggest that late pregnancy is the period of greatest 
vulnerability to BDNF-induced depression.
The observed patterns of relationship between serum BDNF and depressive symptoms in 
late pregnancy were present in women of both races. However, given the significant main 
effects of race on serum BDNF, this prediction line was shifted upward for Black women. Of 
note, the higher levels of serum BDNF in Black women did not provide a protective 
advantage in terms of depressive symptoms; Black and White women exhibited similar level

 of depressive symptoms at each assessment. Thus, the relationship between serum BDNF 
and depressive symptoms is best understood in the context of within-race comparisons.
Analyses of CES-D subscales demonstrated that the association between serum BDNF and 
depressive symptoms in late pregnancy was driven by somatic symptoms as well as 
depressed mood. Thus, although changes in sleep, appetite, and energy level occur within 
the context of healthy pregnancy, these indicators show relationships with biological 
correlates of depression. Of note, while the CES-D is commonly administered in perinatal 
studies (Christian et al., 2009, 2010; Li et al., 2009; Orr et al., 2002; Phillips et al., 2010), 
the Edinburgh Depression Scale was specifically designed for use in pregnancy and 
postpartum and is also widely used (Cox et al., 1987). The Edinburgh purposefully excludes 
somatic symptoms to avoid overlap with typical perinatal experiences. Perhaps relatedly, 
although it has excellent predictive value for major depression, it is less effective for 
detecting minor depression (Murray and Cox, 1990). The current findings indicate that 
somatic symptoms are important in identifying biological pathways to perinatal depression. 
Thus, assessment method should be carefully considered in future studies.
The current data also support a role for serum BDNF in fetal growth. Women delivering low 
birth weight infants (<2500 g) showed a considerable drop in serum BDNF in late pregnancy 
relative to those delivering healthy weight infants. For each 100 pg/ml decrease in serum 
BDNF in the 3rd trimester, the odds of delivering a low birth weight infant was 3.5 times 
greater. Effects of serum BDNF on low birth weight remained after controlling for 
gestational age at delivery, suggesting that fetal growth rather than timing of delivery was a 
central driver.
In the current study, Black women did not show higher rates of low birth weight than 
Whites; however this racial disparity is considerable and consistent in the larger U.S. 
population (March of Dimes Peristats). The lack of effect in the current study may be related 
to sample size; such effect is likely to emerge more readily in a larger cohort. Similarly, in 
the current study, we did not observe an association between depressive symptoms during 
pregnancy and low birth weight, which has been described in prior studies (Grote et al., 
2010). Women with low birth weight infants did exhibit higher depressive symptoms at 
postpartum; this is likely a function of increased stress associated with caring for affected 
infants (Vigod et al., 2010). It is possible that mediating pathways linking prenatal 
depressive symptoms to low birth weight via BDNF would emerge in a larger cohort.
Multiple factors, including age, weight, and exercise, affect BNDF levels (Bus et al., 2011; 
Lommatzsch et al., 2005). In this study, Black and White women did not differ in age, 
education, smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, or self-reported exercise. However, they did differ 
in income, parity, marital status, and prenatal vitamin usage. The sample size precluded 
examination of the potential mediating roles of these variables in relation to outcomes of 
interest. In addition, other factors that may correspond with serum BDNF were not measured 
such as urbanicity; among 1168 adults in the Netherlands, those living in urban versus rural 
environments exhibited higher serum BDNF (Bus et al., 2011).

 Prior research demonstrates that genetic polymorphisms affecting BDNF production and 
serotonin function moderate the effect of early life adversity on subsequent risk for 
depressive symptoms (Buchmann et al., 2013). The examination of genetic factors would 
provide a more nuanced understanding of the associations observed in this cohort. Another 
important limitation of the current study is that it did not include diagnosis of clinical 
depression per clinical interview. Although the CES-D is a well-validated measure which 
includes measurement of multiple domains of depressive symptoms, it does not permit 
determination of clinical diagnosis. This information would be of value in future 
investigations. In addition, the ELISA utilized does not distinguish between mature BDNF 
and its precursor, proBDNF. Of note, prior data suggest that serum levels of mature BDNF 
are lower in adults with major depression, while serum levels of proBDNF do not differ 
(Yoshida et al., 2012). In addition, levels of mature BDNF in human serum are 
approximately 2-fold higher than levels of proBDNF (Yoshida et al., 2012). Thus, we 
postulate that mature BDNF is driving our observed effects. However, measurement 
quantifying mature as well as proBDNF would be informative in future studies, particularly 
as it is possible that differences may be observed specific to pregnancy.
This study did not examine outcomes in infants beyond birth weight. However, a growing 
literature in human and animal models demonstrates that maternal stress and BDNF 
exposure during gestation affects BNDF functioning in offspring, which has implications for 
related cognitive parameters including spatial learning and memory as well as mood and 
anxiety (Cicchetti et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2000; Perera et al., 2015; Pinheiro et al., 2014; 
Tozuka et al., 2010). Thus, examination of the extent to which differential maternal BDNF 
expression affect subsequent life-course development is an important focus for continued 
studies.
In sum, this study provides novel longitudinal data regarding serum BDNF levels across 
pregnancy and postpartum in a racially diverse sample of 139 women. Our findings show 
that serum BDNF declines across gestation in Black as well as White women, with overall 
higher levels in Blacks. In addition, lower serum BDNF in late pregnancy corresponds with 
higher depressive symptoms and the onset of these symptoms is preceded by lower BDNF 
during the 2nd trimester. Finally, women delivering low birth weight infants exhibited 
significantly different patterns of change in serum BDNF, with substantial declines during 
the 3rd trimester compared to women delivering healthy weight infants. The marked racial 
differences observed in BDNF were reflected in shifted patterns of association of BDNF 
with both mood and birth weight among Blacks versus Whites. Thus, future studies 
examining the health implications of BDNF in pregnancy should fully consider differential 
effects by race.

Serum BDNF across time by race in women with high versus low depressive symptoms in 
late pregnancy.
A differential quadratic trajectory of change across time was observed in women with higher 
versus lower depressive symptoms in late pregnancy (F(1126) = 4.15, p = 0.044). 
Controlling for race, higher depressive symptoms in the 3rd trimester were predicted by 
lower serum BDNF in both the 2nd and 3rd trimester (ps < 0.05). To view this figure in
