Objective: To determine the effect of diets low in saturated fatty acids and high in monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids on body composition in participants at risk for metabolic
syndrome (MetS).
Methods: This study was a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study. Participants (n 5 101, ages
49.5 6 1.2, BMI 29.4 6 0.4 kg/m2) were randomized to five isocaloric diets containing treatment oils: Can-
ola, CanolaOleic, CanolaDHA, Corn/Safflower, and Flax/Safflower. Each diet period was 4 weeks followed
by a 2- to 4-week washout period.
Results: Canola (3.1 kg, P 5 0.026) and CanolaOleic oil diets (3.09 kg, P 5 0.03) reduced android fat mass
compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet (3.2 kg), particularly in men. The decrease in abdominal fat mass was
correlated with the reduction in blood pressure after the Canola (systolic blood pressure: r 5 0.26, P 5 0.062;
diastolic blood pressure: r 5 0.38, P 5 0.0049) and CanolaOleic oil diets (systolic blood pressure: r 5 0.39
P 5 0.004; diastolic blood pressure: r 5 0.45, P 5 0.0006). The decrease in abdominal fat mass also was asso-
ciated with a reduction in triglyceride levels after the CanolaOleic oil diet (r 5 0.42, P 5 0.002).
Conclusions: Diets high in MUFA (compared with PUFA) reduced central obesity with an accompanying
improvement in MetS risk factors. Diets high in MUFA may be beneficial for treating and perhaps pre-
venting MetS.

Obesity
 Introduction
Abdominal obesity is an important criterion for metabolic syndrome
(MetS) along with glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hyperten-
sion (1). MetS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type
2 diabetes mellitus (2). Almost 40% of U.S. adults have MetS based
on the International Diabetes Federation definition (3). Weight loss
is the primary treatment for MetS (4). Evidence is emerging that
demonstrates beneficial effects of dietary monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFA) in regulating body weight and cardiometabolic risk
factors (5). The Prevenci�
on con Dieta Mediterr�
anea (PREDIMED)
study showed that long-term consumption of a high-MUFA diet pro-
vided by extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts reduced central obesity
(6). In addition, studies have shown that MUFA-enriched diets
(21%–23% of energy) reduce abdominal fat and central obesity
(7,8). A short-term study (3 weeks) by Kien et al. (9) reported that a
diet rich in oleic acid versus palmitic acid was associated with
decreased android adiposity in healthy men and women. In the
OmniHeart Trial, a diet with 21% of energy from MUFA (and 10%
from polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA) lowered blood pressure and
coronary heart disease risk compared with the higher carbohydrate
diet (5). Others have shown that high-MUFA (20%–23% of energy)
diets improved the lipid/lipoprotein profile (10,11), as well as insulin
sensitivity and/or glycemic control (10,12). Our understanding of the
role that MUFA play in cardiometabolic disease risk reduction is in
the early stages, and further research is needed to clarify the specific
effects that MUFA have on central obesity, which is causally related
to other MetS criteria.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of five vegetable
oil blends varying in MUFA and PUFA on body composition
changes and cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with or at
risk for MetS. Our hypothesis was that high-MUFA diets would ben-
eficially affect central obesity in individuals with or at risk for MetS
and also reduce other cardiometabolic risk factors.
Methods
Participants
We have published detailed information about the study design, par-
ticipant characteristics, and diet design (13). Briefly, 130 participants
were studied at three research centers: University of Manitoba (Can-
ada), Laval University (Canada), and the Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity (United States). Inclusion criteria were men and women 20 to
65 years of age and BMI between 22 and 40 kg/m2 with central
obesity (waist circumference: men �94 cm; women �80 cm) plus
at least one other MetS criterion. Criteria included raised fasting
blood glucose (�5.6 mmol/L), decreased high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (men �1.0 mmol/L, women �1.3 mmol/L), increased tri-
glycerides (TG) (�1.7 mmol/L), and elevated blood pressure (sys-
tolic blood pressure, SBP �130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure,
DBP �85 mm Hg). Exclusion criteria were thyroid disease, diabetes
mellitus, kidney disease, liver disease; current smokers; or consum-
ing more than two alcoholic drinks per week. Individuals taking any
medications for dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, or inflammation
were not eligible to participate in the study. Recruitment criteria
were based on the International Diabetes Federation criteria for
MetS (14). Participants were recruited via flyers, local newspapers,
radio advertisements, and campus mail. The study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of University Manitoba, Laval University, and
Pennsylvania State University and carried out in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration.
Study protocol
A randomized, crossover, five-period, controlled feeding study was
conducted. Each treatment period lasted 4 weeks and was separated
by a 2- to 4-week break during which time participants followed
their habitual diet. After meeting eligibility criteria, participants
were randomly assigned to a sequence of five experimental diets.
The study coordinators and participants were blinded to the treat-
ments as were all laboratory staff.
Dietary intervention
Test diets were created using Food Processor SQL software, version
10.8 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR). Participants were fed an iso-
caloric diet (calculated by Harris-Benedict equation) and advised to
follow their routine physical activity practices. Baseline body weight
was used to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR). For men: BMR
5 66 1 [13.7 3 weight (kg)] 1 [5 3 height (cm)] – [6.8 3 age
(years)]. For women: BMR 5 655 1 [9.6 3 weight (kg)] 1 [1.8 3
height (cm)] – [4.7 3 age (years)]. Weight was measured daily
(Monday through Friday). During the feeding periods, participants
were provided with all of their food, which was prepared in the met-
abolic kitchen at each research center.
The macronutrient profiles of the study diets were based on a typical
American diet with 50% of energy from carbohydrate, 35% of
energy from fat (18% from treatment oils), and 15% of energy from
protein. Five treatment oils, Canola (conventional canola oil), Cano-
laOleic (high-oleic-acid canola oil), CanolaDHA (high-oleic-acid
canola oil with DHA), Corn/Saff (corn/safflower oil), and Flax/Saff
(flax/safflower oil), were studied and incorporated into smoothies
that participants consumed twice daily. The smoothie contained the
treatment oil, frozen unsweetened strawberries, orange sherbet, and
nonfat milk. The quantity of oil was calculated based on participant
energy needs. For a 3,000 kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil per day
was required to provide 18% of total energy. Each smoothie con-
tained 100 g orange sherbet, 100 g nonfat milk, 100 g frozen
unsweetened strawberries, and 30 g oil. Compliance was verified by
assessing the total plasma fatty acid profile at the end of each inter-
vention period, as described previously (15). In brief, fasted blood
samples were collected. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed
using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph equipped with a flame
ionization detector (Agilent Technologies, Ontario, Canada). The
quantity of each fatty acid was calculated by using the correspond-
ing peak area divided by the total area of the fatty acids assayed.
The macronutrient profiles of the study diets are presented in Figure
1. The fatty acid profiles of treatment oils are presented in Support-
ing Information Table S1. A subgroup of participants (n 5 27) from
the University of Manitoba site prepared their own meals in a com-
munal kitchen under supervision due to cultural habits and con-
sumed smoothies with the treatment oils that were pre-made and
delivered from the University of Manitoba. Since they did not
receive
a
controlled
feeding
regimen,
these
participants
were
excluded from the analysis (15). Two participants who lost more
than 5% of body weight due to illness unrelated to the study were
also excluded from the analysis (Figure 1).

ments.
Body composition was assessed by DXA according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Lunar Prodigy Advance, Madison,
WI; QDR-4500W; Hologic Corp, Waltham, MA). Total and regional
body composition was determined with Prodigy Encore 2005 soft-
ware (version 9.30.044) and APEX System software (version 4.0).
Criteria used to identify the anatomical region of interest were iden-
tical across all sites. A subset of the study population from two sites
(n 5 54) had baseline body composition assessment (measured at the
beginning of the study). All sites performed DXA scans at the end
of each diet period (n 5 101).
Statistics
Variables were tested for normality and reported as the means6 SE.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) mixed model (PROC MIXED) procedure. Models included
the following factors as fixed effects: diet, period, age, gender, diet
by period, diet by gender interaction with participants, and center as
random effects. No diet carry-over effect was observed. A Tukey
adjustment was used for multiple comparisons. Within the 54 partici-
pants who had baseline body composition assessment, changes from
baseline were calculated by subtracting the day 1 measurements from
the day 29 measurements. For end-of-diet measurements, the sample
size of n 5 101 offered at least 90% of power to detect a mean of

 3% differences in android fat mass between treatments with a 5 0.05.
For changes from baseline in response to treatment diets, the sample
size of n 5 54 had 80% of power to detect a mean of 3% of android
fat mass change between treatment with a 5 0.05. The Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure was used to control for the false discovery rate.
With the Benjamini-Hochberg critical value for a false discovery rate
of 10%, the corrected level of significance was 0.03. Pearson correla-
tion was used to calculate the correlation coefficient.
Results
Participant characteristics
Participant screening and enrollment in the study are shown in Figure
1. The study was conducted between July 2010 and April 2012. One
hundred and one participants completed all five controlled feeding
diet periods and were included in the analysis. The mean energy
intake for all participants was the same between treatments (Support-
ing Information Table S1). Participants’ baseline anthropometric and
metabolic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The majority of
participants were Caucasian (95%). All participants had at least one
MetS criterion in addition to central obesity, which characterized
them as a population with or “at risk” for MetS (14). Specifically, 39
participants had elevated BP, 44 had elevated TG, 49 had low high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 34 had elevated fasted glucose. In
addition to increased waist circumference, 50 participants had one
additional criterion for MetS, 33 participants had two additional crite-
ria, 16 had three additional criteria, and 2 had all five criteria for
MetS. Fifty-one participants met the criteria for MetS.
Adherence
Plasma fatty acid profiles at the end of each diet period confirmed
diet adherence (Supporting Information Table S2). Between-diet
comparisons revealed that total MUFA concentration was the highest
in participants on the CanolaOleic oil diet (18.5 6 0.3, P < 0.0001),
followed by the Canola oil diet (17.9 6 0.2, P < 0.0001) versus the
other diets. The Corn/Saff oil diet resulted in the highest total n-6
PUFA (38.7 6 0.3, P < 0.0001), followed by the Flax/Saff oil diet
(35.9 6 0.3, P 5 0.0043). The Flax/Saff oil diet resulted in the high-
est ALA (1.7 6 0.04, P < 0.0001). The CanolaDHA oil diet resulted
in the highest total n-3 PUFA plasma concentration (9.6 6 0.1),
mainly contributed by DHA (7.1 6 0.08) and EPA (1.6 6 0.06).
Outcomes
Correlations between android fat mass and cardiometabolic
risk factors (n 5 54).
Baseline correlations between android fat
mass and cardiometabolic risk factors (n 5 54) are presented in Table
2. Android fat mass was positively correlated with C-reactive protein
(r 5 0.28, P 5 0.04), TG levels (r 5 0.27, P 5 0.04), SBP (r 5
0.32, P 5 0.02), and DBP (r 5 0.32, P 5 0.019). Changes in android
fat mass from baseline after the Canola and CanolaOleic oil diets
were positively associated with decreases in SBP (Canola, r 5 0.26,
P 5 0.06; CanolaOleic, r 5 0.39, P 5 0.004) and DBP (Canola, r 5
0.38, P 5 0.005; CanolaOleic, r 5 0.45, P 5 0.0006). Changes in
android fat mass were positively correlated with decreases in plasma
TG levels after consumption of the CanolaOleic oil (r 5 0.42, P 5
0.002) and the Flax/Saff oil (r 5 0.41, P 5 0.002) diets. Thus, as
android fat mass decreased, there was a corresponding decrease in
both SBP and DBP in the Canola and CanolaOleic oil diets, and a
decrease in TG with the CanolaOleic oil diet.

 diets (P 5 0.02) compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet. There was a
strong trend for the Canola oil diet to decrease trunk fat mass com-
pared with the Flax/Saff oil diet (P 5 0.05). There was a diet effect
on android fat mass (P 5 0.01). Participants had a lower android fat
mass in response to the two high-MUFA diets, CanolaOleic oil diet
(3.09 6 0.1 kg, P 5 0.03), and the Canola oil diet (3.1 6 0.1 kg, P
5 0.03) compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet (3.2 6 0.1 kg). The
decrease in android fat mass was affected by gender (P 5 0.03 for
diet by gender interaction). Specifically, males had a lower android
fat mass (3.3 6 0.1 kg) as well as the android-to-gynoid fat mass
ratio (0.71 6 0.02) in response to the CanolaOleic oil diet compared
with the Flax/Saff oil diet (3.5 6 0.1 kg, 0.73 6 0.03, P 5 0.003, P
5 0.0067, respectively). In contrast, there were no differences in
females across the five treatment diets.
Between-diet comparisons for changes in android fat mass
from baseline (n 5 54).
Android fat mass was decreased from
baseline on the Canola oil (P 5 0.04) and CanolaOleic oil diets
(P 5 0.007); the reduction in response to the CanolaOleic oil
diet was greater than that for the Flax/Saff oil diet (P 5 0.02)
(Figure 2). No between-diet differences were observed among the
Canola, CanolaDHA, and Corn/Saff oil diets in android fat mass. A
gender difference was observed in android fat mass in response to
the experimental diets (P 5 0.02). Male participants experienced a
significant android fat mass loss (P 5 0.02) from baseline after the
CanolaOleic oil diet compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet.
Discussion
Our results add to the emerging evidence that dietary MUFA
decrease central obesity and improve cardiometabolic health com-
pared with PUFA, specifically with ALA (16). After just 28 days,
the two MUFA-rich diets, CanolaOleic oil and Canola oil diets,
reduced android fat mass (about 3%) compared with a n-6 PUFA-
enriched Flax/Saff oil diet (which was high in ALA). The changes
in android fat mass were accompanied by a reduction in the
android-to-gynoid fat mass ratio after the CanolaOleic oil diet in
males. The reduction was due to a decrease in central body fat
mass, rather than a redistribution of adipose tissue to the lower
body, as indicated by no change in the gynoid fat mass. The Cano-
laOleic oil diet provided the most MUFA (19.3% of energy) com-
pared with the Canola and CanolaDHA oil diets (17.6% and 17.8%
of energy, respectively). In the Canola and CanolaOleic oil diets
that decreased android fat mass, plasma oleic acid concentration was
highest (14.9% and 15.6%, respectively) compared with the other
diets. These findings add to the evidence base that dietary MUFA
beneficially affect central adiposity in an isocaloric setting. In sup-
port of our findings, Gillingham et al. (7) reported a tendency for a
reduction (P 5 0.055) in the android-to-gynoid fat mass ratio after
consumption of a high-oleic canola oil diet that provided 21%
MUFA from canola oil for 28 days in hypercholesterolemic individ-
uals. Results from the PREDIMED study corroborate our findings in
which diets high in MUFA have a beneficial effect on reducing cen-
tral obesity and cardiovascular disease risk. The PREDIMED study
reported a decrease in waist circumference, which is a surrogate
marker for central obesity, and demonstrated cardiovascular benefits
in response to long-term consumption of Mediterranean diets supple-
mented with extra virgin olive oil or mixed nuts (6,17,18).
The mechanisms for the reduction in body weight and android fat
mass may include a greater oxidation rate and/or increased energy
expenditure in response to the consumption of a high-MUFA diet.
Previous studies have shown that diets high in MUFA affect fat bal-
ance, body mass, and possibly energy expenditure (16,19,20). Pania-
gua et al. (8) reported that a MUFA-rich diet compared with a
carbohydrate-rich diet resulted in greater fat oxidation rates and a
decrease in the abdominal fat-to-leg fat ratio in insulin resistant par-
ticipants. In addition, Schmidt et al. (21) reported that the fractional
oleic acid oxidation rate was significantly greater (21%) than for
palmitic acid in healthy men (n 5 10) after consuming meals that
provided 16.5% energy from oleate and 16.3% from palmitate dur-
ing an 8-h postprandial period. Kien and Bunn (19) demonstrated
that consumption (for 28 days) of a high-oleic-acid diet (1.7% pal-
mitic acid and 31.4% oleic acid) increased the fatty acid oxidation
rate in women compared with the control diet (8.4% palmitic acid
and 13.1% oleic acid). In the same study, a high-oleic-acid diet
increased daily energy expenditure compared with a high-palmitic-
acid diet (16.8% palmitic acid, 16.4% oleic acid) in men (19). Col-
lectively, the results from other studies are suggestive of increased
oxidation and energy expenditure mechanisms that may explain the
decrease in body weight and android fat mass in response to the two
high-oleic-acid diets evaluated in this study. In contrast, a recent
study by Kien et al. (22) reported that a lower rate of total fatty acid
oxidation was observed when palmitic acid (PA: 16.0% of energy;
OA: 16.2% of energy) was replaced with oleic acid (OA: 28.8% of

 energy) in 18 healthy participants. The authors suggested that the
discrepancy with their previous finding about fatty acid oxidation
could be due to the methods of food delivery and the high serum
concentration of estradiol, which may have masked the effects of
MUFA on fatty acid oxidation.
Related to this, MUFA have been shown to activate PPAR-d and
thereby increase fatty acid oxidative capacity (23,24), a finding that
provides a plausible molecular mechanism for the body weight and

Obesity
High-Oleic Canola Oil Reduces Abdominal Fat Mass
Liu et al.
2266
Obesity | VOLUME 24 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2016
www.obesityjournal.org
 has been shown to induce lipolysis through the activation of PPAR-
a, which provides a possible mechanism of action for the favorable
body composition changes in participants on the high-MUFA diets
(25-27). In addition, a higher MUFA diet has been associated with
lower inflammatory activity that may regulate adipose tissue mass
(28). Recent evidence has shown that inhibition of inflammasome-
mediated caspase-1 activity and reduction of obesity-associated
inflammation (i.e., interleukin-1b) attenuated an increase in body
weight despite a similar daily food intake in animal models (29,30).
High MUFA consumption may also contribute to this particular
pathway in regulating body weight and fat mass.
Numerous studies have shown that android fat mass is positively
correlated with BP, TG, and C-reactive protein levels (31-33). In
our study, the reduction in android fat mass was positively corre-
lated with decreases in cardiometabolic risk factors including TG,
SBP, and DBP after the Canola, CanolaOleic, CanolaDHA, and
Flax/Saff oil diets, but not the Corn/Saff oil diet. Previous evidence
has shown that dietary MUFA decrease SBP (5). A recent cross-
sectional study reported that MUFA intake (ranging from 8.1% kcal
to 12.2% kcal), especially oleic acid from vegetable oil sources,
may contribute to the prevention of high BP (34). Research has
shown that weight loss and a reduction in android adiposity decrease
MetS risk (35). The positive correlation between the reduction in
android fat mass and the decrease in cardiometabolic risk factors
demonstrates unique effects of dietary MUFA on MetS criteria that
could be due to a decrease in android adiposity. Fatty acids have
depot-specific effects on lipid accumulation in that MUFA preferen-
tially accumulate in subcutaneous adipose tissue in contrast to SFA
that preferentially accumulate in visceral adipose tissue (36-38).
Consumption of a high-oleic-acid diet may therefore contribute to
preferential fat deposition in subcutaneous adipose tissue and
thereby decrease visceral adiposity and accompanying adverse meta-
bolic effects.
A strength of this study is the controlled diet design, high rates of
dietary adherence as evidenced by plasma fatty acid concentrations,
and the delivery of the treatment oils, all of which were incorpo-
rated into smoothies for easy and accurate administration of the
specified dose of oil. Second, the crossover study design minimized
the influence of genetic polymorphisms that contribute to variations
in diet responsiveness and consequently interindividual differences
in results among study participants (39). Third, results presented
herein are applicable to a large proportion of the U.S. population
with almost 40% of adults having MetS.
Limitations of the study include the 4-week duration of each diet
period. Further studies are needed to evaluate the specific effects of
a high-MUFA diet longer term on body weight and android fat mass
changes in free-living individuals on self-selected diets. As is always
the case, it not possible to definitively conclude that increasing
MUFA versus decreasing PUFA accounts for the observed effects.
Nonetheless, increasing MUFA occurs both at the expense of
decreasing PUFA (specifically ALA) and decreasing SFA. One
recent study showed that erythrocyte linoleic acid was associated
with decreased trunk fat mass in men and women (40). In conjunc-
tion with our finding, this suggests that varying PUFA (LA vs.
ALA) may have a different effect on android fat mass. It will be
important to conduct additional studies that confirm increasing
MUFA is the mechanistically important event. In addition, while the
baseline body composition is a reasonable covariate for assessing
the effects of the experimental diets, comparisons with the baseline
diet are limited because it was always ingested first and nutrient
composition was only estimated based on the habitual intake of a
Western population. Nonetheless, it is highly improbable that the
SFA content of the habitual diets of our participants was as low as
it was in the experimental diets, nor was MUFA as high.
This study has important clinical implications. Our results add to the
emerging evidence base that diets high in MUFA have beneficial
effects on central obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors.
Conclusion
In summary, short-term consumption of diets high in MUFA pro-
vided by Canola oil and CanolaOleic oil was associated with a
reduced android fat mass in participants with or at risk for MetS.
These changes were associated with favorable shifts in cardiometa-
bolic risk factors. Importantly, our findings provide evidence for a
beneficial effect of dietary MUFA in lowering cardiometabolic risk
that we suggest is mediated by a decrease in android fat mass.O
