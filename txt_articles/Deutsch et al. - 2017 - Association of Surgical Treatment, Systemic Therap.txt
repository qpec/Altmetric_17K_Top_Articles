IMPORTANCE Systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma has evolved rapidly during the last
decade, and patient treatment has become more complex.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the survival benefit achieved through surgical resection of melanoma
metastatic to the abdominal viscera in patients treated in the modern treatment
environment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective review of the institutional melanoma
database from the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence St Johns Health Center, a
tertiary-level melanoma referral center, included 1623 patients with melanoma diagnosed as
having potentially resectable abdominal metastases before (1969-2003) and after
(2004-2014) advances in systemic therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival (OS).
RESULTS Of the 1623 patients identified in the database with abdominal melanoma
metastases, 1097 were men (67.6%), and the mean (SD) age was 54.6 (14.6) years. Of the
patients with metastatic melanoma, 1623 (320 [19.7%] in the 2004-2014 period) had
abdominal metastases, including 336 (20.7%) with metastases in the gastrointestinal tract,
697 (42.9%) in the liver, 138 (8.5%) in the adrenal glands, 38 (2.3%) in the pancreas, 109
(6.7%) in the spleen, and 305 (18.8%) with multiple sites. Median OS was superior in surgical
(n = 392; 18.0 months) vs nonsurgical (n = 1231; 7.0 months) patients (P < .001). The most
favorable 1-year and 2-year OS was seen after surgery for gastrointestinal tract (52% and 41%)
and liver (51% and 38%) metastases, respectively. Multivariable analysis found increasing age
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P = .02) and the presence of ulceration (HR, 1.21;
95% CI, 1.01-1.45; P = .04) were associated with a worse OS. Alternatively, treatment with
metastasectomy (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46-0.74; P < .001) and metastases involving the
gastrointestinal tract (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; P = .004) were associated with a better
OS. The systemic treatment era did not significantly affect outcomes (HR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.67-1.02; P = .15). Overall, patients with gastrointestinal tract metastases undergoing
complete, curative resection derived the greatest benefit, with a median OS of 64 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this series is the largest single-institution
experience with abdominal melanoma metastases, demonstrating that surgical resection
remains an important treatment consideration even in the systemic treatment era.

Given the paradigm shift regarding the treatment of pa-
tients with stage IV melanoma, the role of surgical resection
for abdominal visceral melanoma metastases remains un-
clear. Our aim was to evaluate the survival benefit achieved
through surgical resection of melanoma metastatic to the ab-
dominal viscera in patients treated in the modern treatment
environment.
Methods
We used our institutional melanoma database to prospectively
collectdataondatabase-identifiedpatientswithstageIVmela-
nomawithpotentiallyresectableabdominalmetastasesbefore
(1969-2003)andafter(2004-2014)advancesinsystemicthera-
pies.Becauseourinstitutionisatertiaryreferralcenterformela-
noma, all patients eligible for systemic therapy were enrolled
in clinical trials testing the efficacy of immune and targeted
therapystartingin2004.Asaresult,thisyearwaschosentode-
fine the beginning of the modern era of systemic treatment, as
represented in our database. Ipilimumab was the first immu-
notherapy available to the patients on trial, but toward the end
of the period, several patients gained access to PD-1 inhibitors
(ie, nivolumab and pembrolizumab). The timing of systemic
therapy varied from patient to patient, although patients re-
ceived neoadjuvant therapy as a general rule, and metastasec-
tomy was considered for sites of resistance. In some cases, pa-
tientswhoweresymptomaticunderwentsurgicalresectionprior
to initiating systemic therapy. Abdominal metastases were de-
fined as disease involving the GI tract (ie, the stomach, small
intestine, large intestine, and rectum), liver (including biliary
tract), adrenal glands, pancreas, or spleen. Patients with mul-
tiple abdominal sites of disease were grouped into a separate
cohort.Patientdata(ageatstageIVdiseaseandsex)andprimary
tumordata(Breslowthickness,location,andulceration)aswell
asdataonmetastaticdisease(priorstageIII,isolatedvssystemic

as curative or palliative based on intent. Patients with incom-
plete therapy or survival data were excluded. Subgroup analy-
sis by abdominal disease site was performed. This study of
deidentifieddatawasexemptedfromreviewbytheWesternIn-
stitutional Review Board. Informed consent was waived, as all
data was deidentified and contained in a secure, password-
protected database on the institution’
s server.
Descriptive statistics with the χ2 test (for categorical vari-
ables) and t test (for continuous variables) were used to com-
pare variables between the 2 treatment periods. The primary
end point was OS from date of stage IV diagnosis. Kaplan-
Meier curves were calculated, and differences in treatment pe-
riod were compared using the log-rank test. Univariable and
multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazards
model was performed to evaluate the influence of various fac-
tors, including metastatic site, surgery, and treatment era, on
OS. A 2-sided P value less than .05 was considered signifi-
cant. All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical soft-
ware version 17.0 (IBM Corporation).
Results
Of 5668 patients identified within the database with stage IV
melanoma, 1623 had abdominal metastases, including 336
Key Points
Question What is the role of surgical resection of abdominal
visceral melanoma metastases in the era of modern systemic
therapy?
Findings In this review of 1623 patients with abdominal visceral
melanoma metastases, median overall survival was superior in
surgical (18.0 months) vs nonsurgical (7.0 months) patients. The
most favorable 1-year and 2-year overall survival was seen after
surgery for gastrointestinal tract and liver metastases, respectively,
and the era of systemic treatment did not have a significant effect.
Meaning Surgical resection of abdominal visceral melanoma
metastases continues to afford patients durable long-term survival
irrespective of advances in systemic treatment.

 patients (20.7%) with metastases in the GI tract, 697 (42.9%)
in the liver, 138 (8.5%) in the adrenal glands, 38 (2.3%) in the
pancreas, 109 (6.7%) in the spleen, and 305 (18.8%) with mul-
tiple sites. Patients with GI tract involvement had the best OS
outcomes, with 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survivals of
37%, 30%, 23%, and 11%, respectively. Patients with abdomi-
nal metastases undergoing surgical resection had a superior
median survival compared with patients treated medically (18
months vs 7 months; P < .001). Significant variability was ap-
parent when subdividing patients with stage IV melanoma by
site of abdominal metastasis. The most favorable outcomes
were observed in patients undergoing surgery for GI tract me-
tastases, with greater than 50% surviving 1 year and almost
one-third surviving 5 years. Patients with liver, pancreas,
spleen, and even multiple abdominal sites undergoing metas-
tasectomy also exhibited a significant survival benefit vs those
treated nonsurgically (Table 1).
Patients were next split into 2 cohorts based on the era of
systemic treatment (1969-2003 and 2004-2014). In the ear-
lier period, 1303 patients were evaluated for abdominal me-
tastasesvs320patientsduringthemorecontemporaryera.The
patientsseeninthemoderntreatmenterawereyounger(mean,
53.1 years vs 60.5 years; P < .001) with a higher rate of head
and neck and extremity primary melanomas (43% vs 33%, re-
spectively).Significantlyfewerpatientswerediagnosedashav-
ing stage III disease, with longer mean metastasis-free inter-
vals (85.8 months vs 62.4 months) prior to identification of
abdominal metastases (Table 2). Patients with abdominal me-
tastases diagnosed during the 2004-2014 systemic treatment
era had improved median OS compared with stage IV pa-
tients with melanoma diagnosed prior to 2004 (11 months vs
8 months, respectively; P = .003). Surgically treated patients
showed a trend toward better survival during the modern era.
Multivariable Cox regression analysis controlled for dif-
ferences between the 2 systemic treatment eras. Older age at
stage IV diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01;
P = .02) and the presence of ulceration (HR, 1.21; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.45; P = .04) were associated with poorer survival.
Conversely, GI tract metastases (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87;
P = .004) and treatment with metastasectomy (HR, 0.59;
95% CI, 0.46-0.74; P < .001) were associated with better
OS. Importantly, treatment during the more contemporary
systemic treatment era did not have a significant effect on
survival (Table 3).
A subgroup analysis was performed on patients with only
GI tract metastases because these patients showed the best
outcomes of all intra-abdominal sites investigated. Four
hundredsixty-onepatientswithGItractinvolvement(336with
GI tract only plus 125 with GI tract and another abdominal site)
were analyzed and found to have similar demographic and
clinical characteristics compared with the overall cohort. How-
ever, a greater proportion (259 of 461 [56.2%]) were treated
surgically. Patients undergoing combined treatment with
surgery and immunotherapy had a median OS of 23 months,
which was similar to those treated with surgery alone (21
months) and significantly longer than those patients receiv-
ing either immunotherapy alone (6 months) or no therapy (5
months; P < .001) (Figure 1). Patients whose GI tract metasta-
ses were treated surgically with curative intent had a median
OS of 64 months. Alternatively, patients receiving palliative
surgery or no surgery demonstrated significantly inferior sur-
vival (Figure 2).
Interestingly, patients found to have GI tract metastases
incidentally on routine surveillance imaging had an im-
proved median OS compared with patients presenting with
symptoms (39 months vs 19 months; P < .001). While pa-
tients with abdominal pain (yes, 12 months vs no, 26 months;
P = .01) or obstructive symptoms (yes, 12 months vs no, 31
months; P < .001) on presentation did worse overall, the pres-
ence or absence of anemia did not predict any differences in
OS (yes, 26 months vs no, 17 months; P = .28). There was no
significant difference in outcomes between metastases dis-
covered on computed tomography compared with positron
emission tomography (28 months vs 32 months; P = .69), as
well as by laparoscopic vs open surgical approach (32 months
vs 22 months; P = .51).
Discussion
Surgical resection of stage IV disease has increased substan-
tially across several common cancer types, including mela-
noma, despite the increasing use and efficacy of modern sys-
temic therapy.23 A 2012 retrospective analysis of data from a
multicenter randomized clinical trial highlights the value of
metastasectomy in patients with m1c disease.24 In 2014, our
institution reported that stabilization on systemic therapy was
the most important factor affecting survival in surgically

 treated patients with melanoma with liver metastases.25 Fur-
ther, our institution demonstrated that adrenalectomy, either
as a complete metastasectomy or targeted to lesions resistant
to systemic therapy, has been associated with improved long-
term survival in metastatic melanoma.26 In a 2015 study by He
et al,27 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with BRAF
inhibitor therapy and metastasectomy (14% of whom under-
went small bowel resection) demonstrated durable postopera-
tive control of disease in select patients undergoing resection
of oligometastatic disease.27
Our study builds on these reports, which together pro-

 disease (32% 5-year survival). Surprisingly, the 2004-2014
systemic treatment era did not have a significant effect on
survival outcomes.
Patients with metastases to the GI tract undergoing
complete, curative resection derived the greatest benefit
from metastasectomy, affording patients a 64-month
median OS. This could in part be owing to improved
imaging techniques (ie, thin-slice computed tomography
and positron emission tomography), allowing asymptomatic
patients with GI tract involvement to have an earlier diagno-
sis and surgical treatment.
Limitations
This study, while comprehensive, was not without limita-
tions. First, surgical intent had to be gleaned from the
medical records owing to the study’
s retrospective nature.

 Further, complete data on the specific immunotherapy regi-
mens administered to patients was not available. However,
because this study used data from a database from a tertiary
referral melanoma center, most patients during the modern
era of systemic treatment were evaluated for and treated with
modern therapy. Patients were treated according to clinician
preference, and treatment decisions were not based on a spe-
cific protocol. As a result, the patients within our cohort were
likely carefully selected. For example, our institutional ap-
proach has been aggressive resection in younger patients re-
sulting in longer disease-free intervals from diagnosis to the
appearance of abdominal metastases. Because the study pa-
tients received their care during a 40-year period, it is pos-
sible that survival may have been affected by improvements
in surgical technology, in addition to other refinements that
we were unable to capture. With the advent and widespread
use of more effective systemic immune and targeted therapy,
we believe there is significant potential for a paradigm shift
in the treatment of patients with stage IV melanoma with
abdominal disease.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the largest single-institution expe-
rience with abdominal melanoma metastases, and it demon-
strates that surgical resection continues to afford patients du-
rable long-term survival irrespective of advances in systemic
treatments. Through application of a multidisciplinary ap-
proach, the combination of metastasectomy and cutting-
edge systemic therapies could further enhance disease re-
sponse and its durability.

Metastasectomy for Abdominal Visceral
Oligometastatic Melanoma
Danielle K. DePeralta, MD; Jonathan S. Zager, MD
In the era of targeted immunotherapy for stage IV melanoma,
there is general agreement that patients with isolated abdomi-
nal metastases should be treated with resection if they can be
rendered no evidence of disease. Similarly, there is little
debate that patients with
substantial disease burden
should be offered palliative
metastasectomyonlyincases
ofbleeding,obstruction,orpaintoaddresstheirsymptoms.1We
agree with the conclusion of Deutsch et al2 supporting the im-
portanceofsurgicalresectioninselectedpatientswithabdomi-
nal metastases from melanoma and congratulate the authors
on compiling their institutional experience with an impressive
number of patients and long-term follow-up.2
In patients who can be rendered no evidence of disease
without undue surgical morbidity, we feel the most signifi-
cant area of controversy is not whether to operate but how and
when to coordinate resection with systemic therapy. Should
surgical resection precede adjuvant therapy? Should neoad-
juvant therapy be given to assess tumor biology and response
to therapy? Does delaying surgery risk prevent ongoing meta-
static spread? Is systemic therapy enough to render some pa-
tients no evidence of disease, and if so, is there potential for
durablediseasecontrol?Howmanyfociofdiseasearetoomany
to recommend resection in the asymptomatic patient? In the
Deutsch et al study,2 variables associated with improved sur-
vival included gastrointestinal tract–only metastases and sur-
gical resection. Older age and ulceration were associated
with worse outcomes. Subgroup analysis was included for
patients with gastrointestinal tract–only metastases with simi-
lar survival in patients treated with combined immuno-
therapy and surgery vs surgery alone.
We reported our institutional series of metastatic mela-
noma to the gastrointestinal tract during the modern era of
systemic therapy (2007-2013).3 On multivariate analysis, only
number of metastases and completeness of resection corre-
lated significantly with overall survival. The use of systemic
therapy was not significantly associated with survival. Most
patients treated with curative intent did not receive neoadju-
vant therapy. The effect of systemic therapy on outcomes in
patients with oligometastatic disease remains unknown and
is difficult to assess based on the available data and the bias
drivingpatientselectionforresection.4,5Onmultivariateanaly-
sis, Deutsch et al2 report no survival difference in patients with
abdominal metastases treated before or after 2004, which is
ahumblingreminderthatdespiteadvancesinsystemictherapy,
there remains much work to be done. As systemic options for
melanoma evolve, continued attention to the role and timing
of systemic therapy and surgical resection will be of para-
mount importance.
