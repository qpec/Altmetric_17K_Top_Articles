Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disease of heart muscle that can
be caused by mutations in sarcomere proteins. Clinical diagnosis depends on an abnormal
thickening of the heart, but the earliest signs of disease are hyperdynamic contraction
and impaired relaxation. Whereas some in vitro studies of power generation by mutant
and wild-type sarcomere proteins are consistent with mutant sarcomeres exhibiting
enhanced contractile power, others are not. We identified a small molecule, MYK-461,
that reduces contractility by decreasing the adenosine triphosphatase activity of the
cardiac myosin heavy chain. Here we demonstrate that early, chronic administration
of MYK-461 suppresses the development of ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray,
and myocardial fibrosis and attenuates hypertrophic and profibrotic gene expression
in mice harboring heterozygous human mutations in the myosin heavy chain. These
data indicate that hyperdynamic contraction is essential for HCM pathobiology and
that inhibitors of sarcomere contraction may be a valuable therapeutic approach
for HCM.
H
ypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the
most common inherited disease of the
heart muscle and occurs in ~1 in 500 adults
(1). Patients are diagnosed with HCM when
they present with left ventricular hyper-
trophy (LVH) that cannot be explained by another
cardiac or systemic disease. Associated histopatho-
logic findings include enlarged, disorganized car-
diomyocytes and increased amounts of myocardial
fibrosis. HCM also perturbs heart function, with
characteristically hyperdynamic contraction (2, 3)
and impaired relaxation (4). Both the histopatho-
logic and hemodynamic abnormalities of HCM
contribute to patient symptoms (including exer-
tional angina and shortness of breath) and in-
crease the risk for atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart
failure, and premature death (5). Contemporary
pharmacologic therapy for HCM consists of off-
label use of medications that nonspecifically re-
duce contractile strength by blocking b-adrenergic
receptors or calcium channels (6). Although these
medications can provide some symptom relief,
none alter the progression of disease (7).
Dominant inherited and de novo mutations in
genes that encode protein components of the sar-
comere, the contractile unit of the heart, are iden-
tified in 35% of unselected patients who submit
to gene-based testing (8) and 80% of patients
with familial HCM (9). The two most frequently
mutated HCM genes encode b–cardiac myosin
heavy chain (MYH7), the predominant myosin
isoform expressed in the adult human heart, and
myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), a modula-
tor of cardiac contraction. Pathogenic missense
mutations in MYH7 cluster within the globular
motor domain, the head-rod junction region, and
the rod domain, whereas mostpathogenicMYBPC3
variants encode truncated proteins (8, 10). Studies
of young carriers of either MYH7 or MYBPC3
mutations have shown that hyperdynamic con-
traction and impaired relaxation precede the ap-
pearance of LVH (11–13).
To study the role of sarcomere mutations in
the development of HCM, we used previously gen-
erated mouse models of HCM, which we created
by introducing human disease-causing mutations
into the murine a–cardiac myosin heavy chain
gene (14–17). This is the predominant myosin
isoform expressed in the adult mouse ventricle
and is 92% identical to human b–cardiac myosin
heavy chain. Mice with heterozygous Arg403→Gln403
(R403Q) (within the actin-binding site), Arg453→
Cys453 (R453C) (adjacent to the nucleotide-
binding site), and Arg719→Trp719 (R719W) (within
the converter domain) missense residues (fig. S1)
recapitulate most morphologic and functional
features of human HCM.
Characterizing the biochemical and biophys-
ical effects of these mutations at the molecular
level and connecting these properties to the
clinical phenotype of HCM is an active field of
study. In many biomechanical assays, mutant
myosin molecules expressed in vitro or isolated
from HCM mouse hearts or human myofibrillar
preparations have shown enhanced enzymatic
[adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)] activity, in-
creased tension development, and/or increased
unloaded actin-filament sliding velocities (10, 18).
These molecular phenotypes could explain the
hyperdynamic contraction observed in human
HCM patients. Furthermore, as cardiac fibro-
blasts respond to heightened mechanical, paracrine,
and electrophysiological signals from cardiomyo-
cytes with increased profibrotic gene expression
(19) and production of extracellular matrix pro-
teins (20), the hyperdynamic biomechanical prop-
erties of mutant sarcomeres could contribute
to the downstream development of HCM histo-
pathology (16). However, some HCM mutant pro-
teins in reconstituted systems do not demonstrate
increased power production and appear to slight-
ly decrease force production (21). Such discrep-
ancies highlight the current limitations of the
reconstituted systems: single- rather than double-
headed myosins, as well as the absence of key
protein components and posttranslational mod-
ifications. Thus, the question remains as to wheth-
er mutations found in HCM increase power output
at the molecular level. To test this hypothesis by
an alternate approach, we sought a small mole-
cule that could reduce sarcomere power output.

 We reasoned that if excess sarcomere power is the
primary defect in HCM, small-molecule inhibitors
of sarcomere power might ameliorate the disease
at its source and abolish hallmark features of
HCM such as hypertrophy, cellular disarray, and
myocardial fibrosis.
Sarcomere power output is the product of en-
semble force generated by myosin heads and their
velocity of movement along actin filaments (22).
In principle, either component of power output
could be a target for modulation, and we initially
sought agents that reduce power by reducing en-
semble force generation. Because increases in the
cycle time of myosin ATPase reduce ensemble force
generation, we conducted a chemical screen for
molecules that reduced the maximal actin-activated
ATPase rate of myosin in bovine myofibrils
(Fig. 1A). Both a- and b-cardiac myosin normally
spend ~1/10 of their ATPase chemomechanical
cycle times strongly bound to actin (Fig. 1A, lower
two structures). Lengthening the total cycle time
reduces this proportion, resulting in fewer myosin
molecules in a force-producing state and an over-
all reduction in force generation (22). Compounds
identified via this screen underwent optimiza-
tion of potency and pharmaceutical properties
to yield MYK-461 (Fig. 1B).
Treatment of mouse cardiac myofibrils with
MYK-461 reduced ATPase activity in a dose-
dependent manner [median inhibitory concen-
tration (IC50) of 0.3 mM] (Fig. 1C). Maximal doses
of MYK-461 (>10 mM) reduced the maximal
ATPase rate by ~90%. The potent inhibition of

 ATPase rates in both murine [>90% a-myosin
(23)] and bovine myofibrils [>90% b-myosin
(24)] indicates that MYK-461 is active against
both the a and b isoforms of cardiac myosin.
Because we observed similar activity (IC50 of
0.3 mM) (fig. S2A) in a basal system consisting
of only purified bovine myosin S1, we concluded
that MYK-461 acts directly on myosin. We next
performed transient kinetic experiments to iso-
late individual steps of the myosin chemomechan-
ical cycle by which MYK-461 inhibits myosin
ATPase. Treatment with MYK-461 reduced the
rate of phosphate release (Fig. 1A, step two, and
fig. S2B), the rate-limiting step in the chemo-
mechanical cycle, in a dose-dependent manner
without slowing adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
release (Fig. 1A, step three, and fig. S2C). These
data suggest that MYK-461 reduces the myosin
duty ratio (i.e., the ratio of strongly bound state
time to total cycle time) and thus decreases the
ensemble force, power, and contractility produced
by the sarcomere.
We also directly studied the effect of MYK-461
on power generation in muscle, by measuring
tension produced by skinned cardiac muscle fi-
bers isolated from adult rats. Exposure to MYK-461
reduced maximal tension in a dose-dependent
manner (~70% reduction at 1.0 mM) without al-
tering the pCa50 (i.e., the pCa at half the maximal
activity) or the tension at lower calcium concen-
trations (Fig. 1, D and E). Similarly, adult rat ven-
tricular cardiomyocytes treated with MYK-461
showed a dose-dependent reduction in fraction-
al shortening (IC50 0.18 mM) (Fig. 1D) without
changing the calcium transient (fig. S3).
To study in vivo effects and determine whether
MYK-461 decreases fractional shortening, a mea-
sure of contractility (fig. S4A), we administered
MYK-461 orally (2.5 mg/kg per day via drinking
water) to young (ages 6 to 15 weeks) wild-type
(WT) and HCM mice expressing a–cardiac myosin
heavy chain missense mutations R403Q, R719W,
or R453C. Chamber dimensions, fractional short-
ening, and plasma drug concentrations were mea-
sured at baseline and at 2- to 4-week intervals (fig.
S4B). WT and mutant mice exhibited decreased
fractional shortening that correlated linearly with
MYK-461 plasma exposures (correlation coeffi-
cient r = 0.57; P <10−5) (Fig. 2A). Although MYK-
461 inhibits the ATPase activity of skeletal myosin
with a lower affinity (IC50 of 4.7 mM with rabbit
skeletal myosin), treated rodents had no reduc-
tion in grip strength or voluntary exercise ca-
pacity (fig. S5). Thus, MYK-461 reduced cardiac
contractility in a dose-dependent manner in nor-
mal and mutant mice without overt impairment
of skeletal muscle function.
We next investigated whether MYK-461 ad-
ministered to young prehypertrophic HCM mice
[ages 8 to 15 weeks; left ventricular wall thick-
ness (LVWT) ≤ 0.8 mm] affected the develop-
ment of LVH, the cardinal manifestation of HCM.
Both treated and untreated WT mice maintained
stable LVWT throughout the experiment, where-
as LVWT increased in placebo-treated HCM
mice (Fig. 2B), indicating the emergence of overt
disease. In contrast, HCM mice treated with
MYK-461 had LVWT comparable to that of WT
mice (Fig. 2B).
To determine whether MYK-461 could reverse
pathologic remodeling, we administered this drug
to older HCM mice (ages 30 to 35 weeks) with

 overt LVH (LVWT ≥ 0.9 mm). Serial echocardio-
grams showed a significant reduction in the
fractional shortening by week 2 (fig. S4C) and in
LVWT by week 4 (Fig. 2C), after which these
parameters remained stable with continued treat-
ment. Thus, reduction of the pathologic power
generated by the mutant sarcomere blunted the
development of LVH and promoted partial re-
gression of hypertrophy in older HCM mice.
Seminal histopathologic features of HCM in-
clude cardiomyocyte disarray and fibrosis, which
may contribute to ventricular arrhythmias and
heart failure (25). We hypothesized that counter-
acting the biomechanical effects of sarcomere
mutations with MYK-461 would normalize these
histopathologic phenotypes. Untreated HCM mice
(R403Q or R453C) developed variable amounts
of patchy fibrosis encompassing ~4.5 and ~9.6%
of the left ventricle (LV), respectively (Fig. 3, A
and B). Prehypertrophic mice treated for 20 to
26 weeks (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig S6) displayed
~80% less fibrosis. However, when MYK-461 was
administered after the development of substan-
tial hypertrophy, it did not significantly reduce
the occurrence of fibrosis. These data suggest
that normalizing sarcomere power output can
reduce the fibrotic response to an HCM muta-
tion, but the maximum benefit may be achieved
by administering treatment before the onset of
overt hypertrophy.
To characterize the effect of MYK-461 on myo-
fibrillar disarray, we used an algorithm (26, 27)
that determines the regional orientation of myo-
fibrils across histological sections (Fig. 3C and
fig. S7). We defined the mean myofiber orienta-
tions for a given region (Fig. 3C) and the per-
centage of aligned cells (cells oriented within
20° of the mean; see supplementary materials
and methods). At 30 weeks of age, untreated
HCM R403Q mice had an average of 45 ± 7%
aligned cardiomyocytes per region (Fig. 3D,
red). Prehypertrophic R403Q mice treated with
MYK-461 had 30% more aligned cardiomyo-
cytes (59 ± 10%; P = 0.02) (Fig. 3D, blue),
comparable to the mean alignment of cardio-
myocytes observed in WT heart sections (Fig.
3D, black). In contrast, mice treated with MYK-
461 after the development of overt hypertrophy
showed no significant increase in cardiomyo-
cyte alignment.
To characterize the cardiac transcriptional re-
sponses to reduced contractility from MYK-461
in HCM hearts, we focused on 200 genes with
significantly altered expression in hypertrophic
R403Q and R453C mice compared with WT con-
trols (table S1). This gene set was enriched for
cardiomyocyte-expressed transcripts encoding
contractile-associated proteins and for cardiac
fibroblast transcripts encoding proteins involved
in extracellular matrix production (table S2). RNA
expression of this 200-gene set in R403Q and
R453C mice exposed to MYK-461 either before
(ages 8 to 15 weeks; early Rx) or after (ages 30 to
35 weeks; late Rx) the development of overt LVH
was significantly closer to WT LV levels than to
untreated HCM LV levels (Fig. 4, A and B) (P <
0.0001). Although we did not detect regression of
myocardial fibrosis in these mice, both cardio-
myocyte contractility and profibrotic gene expres-
sion were normalized (Fig. 4C), indicating that
reduction in sarcomere power in the prehyper-
trophic and overt HCM hearts promoted main-
tenance or restoration of normal transcriptional
pathways.
Because LV hypertrophy has been linked with
inefficient energy utilization (28), we also com-
pared gene expression for 1158 genes (29) that
encode proteins localized to mitochondria (fig.
S8A) in WT and HCM mice (R403Q or R453C).
In untreated HCM mice, we observed dysregu-
lated expression in 19.7% (228 genes; R403Q) and
28.7% (332 genes; R453C) of genes encoding mito-
chondrial proteins, as compared with WT levels
(P = 0.01) (fig. S8B). Early treatment with MYK-
461 reduced the percentage of dysregulated gene
expression to 4.2% (49 genes; R403Q) and 7.5%
(87 genes; R453C) (P < 0.01 versus untreated).
These data are consistent with an altered meta-
bolic state in HCM that is normalized by treat-
ment with MYK-461.

 In summary, our data demonstrate that a
small-molecule inhibitor of sarcomere power
administered early in the course of disease can
attenuate the development and progression of
the morphologic, histopathologic, and molecular
changes that characterize HCM. Our findings
support a mechanistic model for HCM in which
sarcomere mutations lead to increased molecu-
lar power output, hyperdynamic contraction, and
ultimately, pathologic remodeling of the heart.
We suggest that analyses from reconstituted sys-
tems (18, 21) have not consistently validated this
model because key components (e.g., MYBPC or
titin) are missing and/or important parameters
for power production have not been examined
(30). Nevertheless, our in vivo results indicate
that reduction of sarcomere power output by
direct manipulation of their biomechanical
properties—with a small molecule that targets
cardiac myosin—may present a therapeutic
approach to HCM.
As other heritable cardiomyopathies are asso-
ciated with mutations that disrupt physiologic
power production by the sarcomere (31), the salu-
tary effects of inhibiting myosin power in HCM
suggest a more general paradigm for treating
genetic cardiomyopathies: pharmacologic nor-
malization of underlying biomechanical defects
by either increasing or decreasing sarcomere
power (22). Small molecules that augment my-
osin power have already been identified and
are in clinical trials for patients with heart failure
(32, 33). Further elucidation of the biochemical
and biophysical consequences of human muta-
tions on cardiac function can form the basis for
future efforts to treat these diseases at their mech-
anistic source.
