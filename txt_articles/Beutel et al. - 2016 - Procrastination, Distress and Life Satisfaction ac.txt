Abstract
Addressing the lack of population-based data the purpose of this representative study was
to assess procrastination and its associations with distress and life satisfaction across the
life span. A representative German community sample (1,350 women; 1,177 men) between
the ages of 14 and 95 years was examined by the short form of the General Procrastination
Scale (GPS-K; 1) and standardized scales of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, fatigue
and life satisfaction. As hypothesized, procrastination was highest in the youngest cohort
(14–29 years). Only in the youngest and most procrastinating cohort (aged 14 to 29 years),
men procrastinated more than women. As we had further hypothesized, procrastination
was consistently associated with higher stress, more depression, anxiety, fatigue and
reduced satisfaction across life domains, especially regarding work and income. Associa-
tions were also found with lack of a partnership and unemployment. Findings are discussed
with regard to potential developmental and cohort effects. While procrastination appears to
be a pervasive indicator for maladjustment, longitudinal analyses in high-risk samples (e.g.
late adolescence, unemployment) are needed to identify means and mechanisms of
procrastinating.
Introduction
Procrastination, putting off intended action, is a universal phenomenon, which may be
employed for many reasons (e.g. postponing action in order to avoid stress; [1]). Therefore,
Steel [2] characterized procrastination as a self-regulatory failure leading to poor performance
and reduced well-being. Klingsieck [3] aptly defined procrastination as “the voluntary delay of
an intended and necessary and/or (personally) important activity, despite expecting potential

 negative consequences that outweigh the positive consequences of the delay” (p. 26). Over the
last decades a considerable amount of literature has been published on procrastination and its
causes and consequences in different aspects of life [2; 4]. In his seminal meta-analysis and
review, Steel [2] identified task (aversiveness, delay) and personality characteristics (particu-
larly low self-efficacy, conscientiousness, self- control and achievement motivation as well as
high impulsiveness and distractibility) as determinants of procrastination, along with a poten-
tial genetic component (based on a twin study). Gröpel & Steel [5] investigated predictors of
procrastination in a large internet- based study with 9,351 participants (mean age of 35 years).
Based on temporal motivation theory, the results showed that goal setting, interest enhance-
ment and energy reduced procrastination. Lack of energy was most strongly associated with
procrastination, mediating the effect of interest enhancement. Goal setting appeared to be par-
ticularly important, when interest in the task was low. Additionally, they found weak negative
associations of procrastination to age (r = -.17) and female sex (r = -.08).
Several studies have explored procrastinating behavior in an academic context and in the
workplace. Procrastination has been most thoroughly studied in student populations, where it
has been associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression and poor academic per-
formance [2; 6], but also with putting off everyday obligations [7]. In a large internet-based
study (N = 22,053) on the association of procrastination with employment status and job char-
acteristics, Nguyen et al. [8] found that procrastination was associated with lower income,
shorter duration of employment and more unemployment. Employees in jobs with lower
intrinsic value (e.g. recognition) and more constraints tended to procrastinate more than
employees having jobs requiring higher levels of intrinsic motivation skills.
Additionally, further studies identified extreme and persistent procrastination as a risk fac-
tor for poor physical and mental well-being (e.g. [9; 10]). Procrastination as a dysfunctional
form of delay was linked to delayed medical treatments and less mental health care utilization
[11; 12]. In regard to socio-demographic variables, men tended to procrastinate more than
women and younger compared to older participants in a large epidemiological study
(N = 16,413). Additionally, procrastinators tended to be single and less well educated [13]. The
found associations between procrastination and lower psychological well-being may indicate
that procrastination is also linked to reduced life satisfaction [14]. As people with the tendency
to procrastinate seem to be less integrated in their social and professional lives (e.g. living more
often without partner, unemployed etc.), the relationship between procrastination and loneli-
ness as an aspect of reduced life satisfaction was also considered to be worth exploring.
However, all of these results depended on the operationalization of procrastination. Among
the diverse measures available, the General Procrastination Scale (GPS) by Lay [15] has been
frequently used to assess “the tendency to postpone that which is necessary to reach some goal”
(p. 475). However, Klingsieck & Fries [16] were not able to reproduce the postulated one-facto-
rial structure of the original scale in a large student sample, which they explained by heteroge-
neity and ambiguity of some of the items (e.g. delay of getting out of bed in the morning).
Based on factor analysis, Klingsieck & Fries [16] identified nine items forming a brief, one-fac-
torial scale covering to a broad range of procrastination behaviors. In a validation study with
the short scale (GPS-K), the authors found high positive correlations to the Aitken Procrastina-
tion Inventory ([17]; r = .75) and high negative correlations to conscientiousness (based on the
BFI-10; r = .-.69) as well as action orientation (r = .-.67). Other negative associations were
found to time management (r = .-.48), planning (r = .-.34), self-efficacy ([18]; r = .-.26) and
agreeability (BFI-10; r = .-.20). Men procrastinated more than women.
Considering the high prevalence of procrastination and its individual and societal conse-
quences, it is essential to explore procrastination, socio-demographic and mental health vari-
ables in a large community sample to identify risk populations. The purpose of this study was

 therefore to study procrastination in a representative sample of the German population across
the full age range from 14 to 95 years. We intended to determine the association of procrastina-
tion to demographic and vocational factors (age, sex, education, employment, income), and a
broad range of mental health characteristics, especially perceived stress, distress (depression,
anxiety, fatigue) and life satisfaction across a broad set of life domains. In line with previous
research findings we hypothesized that procrastination was (1) higher in younger age [13] and
(2) associated with more perceived stress and distress (depression, anxiety, fatigue), reduced
quality of life and less social integration [2; 9; 14].
Method
Participants
The present study was based on a representative survey of the German population. Data were
collected by USUMA (Unabhängiger Service für Umfragen, Methoden und Analysen; Berlin)
between February and April, 2014. The sample consisted of a total of 2,527 participants (1,350
women; 1,177 men) between the ages of 14 and 95 years who were recruited at 258 sample
points, representing East and West Germany; the majority (79.9%) lived in the Western states
of Germany. Participants, who gave informed consent, were interrogated by face-to-face-inter-
views by trained interviewers in their homes and independently filled out additional question-
naires in the presence of the interviewer. No incentives were offered for study participation.
The survey followed ADM (Arbeitskreis Deutscher Markt- und Sozialforschungsinstitute e.V.)
sampling guidelines for generating a representative sample of the German population [19].
The sampling procedure comprised three steps: First the areas were regionally stratified (1st
step) for identifying sampling points, where private households were selected (2nd step). In the
3rd step the individual within the selected household was determined. By applying this ran-
dom-route procedure the region, the households and target persons living in the households
were randomly selected. Table 1 presents the data of the last official survey of the entire Ger-
man population conducted in 2011 by the Statistical Federal Office showing the comparability
with the data of the present sample. After contacting the selected participants in their home,
55.1% of the initial sample (4,607 households) was interviewed. The resulting quota matched
other representative population samples. 46.1% of the sample was married and 58.1% lived in a
partnership. The great majority had completed high school or 10th grade of education (59%);
2.7% attended school. The full or part-time employment rate was 51.4% and the unemploy-
ment rate 6.0%; 28.3% received pension.
Ethics statement
The study and procedure, including the consent procedure, were approved by the institutional
ethics review board of the University of Leipzig (Az 063-14-10032014). The ethics committee
of the University of Leipzig approved the consent procedure for the whole sample including
participants between 14 and 18 years. Furthermore, the study adhered to ICH-GCP-guidelines
(ICH = International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registra-
tion of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use; GCP = Good Clinical Practice) as well as to the guide-
lines of the ICC/ESOMAR (ICC = International Chamber of Commerce; ESOMAR =
European Society for Opinion and Market Research) International Code of Marketing and
Social Research Practice. All participants were informed of the study procedures, data collec-
tion and anonymization of all personal data. Moreover, a detailed data privacy statement was
delivered by the study assistant. The present study posed a low risk to the participants, as pro-
cedures such as medical treatments, invasive diagnostics or procedures causing psychological,
spiritual or social harm were not included in the present study. According to the German law,

 all participants provided verbal informed consent, which was noted by the trained interviewer
before starting with the survey. An additional informed consent of a parent was thus not
required for participants aged 14 or older.
Measures
Demographic data included age (�14 years), sex, marital and employment status, education
and total income of household.
The German short form (GPS-K; [16]) is a one-dimensional short-form of the General Pro-
crastination Scale (GSS) with nine items [15]. Participants rated how characteristic they con-
sider each behaviour (e.g. “I delay the completion of certain things”) on a 4-point scale (1 =
“very uncharacteristic” to 4 = “very characteristic”). As described above, it was validated in a stu-
dent sample (N = 218). The internal consistency in the present study was Cronbach alpha = .92.
Distress, stress and fatigue were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4),
the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Copenhagen Personal Burnout Inventory (CBI).
The PHQ-4 [20] consists of two items reliably assessing the core symptoms of depressed mood
and loss of interest (PHQ-2) plus two screening items of the short form of the GAD-7 (Gener-
alized Anxiety Disorder [GAD]-2 Scale): “Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge” and “not being
able to stop or control worrying”. The frequency of occurrence in the past two weeks was rated
from 0 = “not at all”, 1 = “several days”, 2 = “over half the days”, and 3 = “nearly every day”.
Answers of the first two items were added to a total score (0 to 6); a score � 3 has a good sensi-
tivity (87%) and specificity (78%) for major depression. Cronbach alpha in the present study

 was = .83. A sum score � 3 (range 0–6) of the other two items indicates generalized anxiety
with good sensitivity (86%) and specificity (83%), performing well as a screening tool for all
anxiety disorders [21]. The scale is reliable (Cronbach’s alpha in the current study = .77.) and
was validated in a general population sample [20].The reliable and valid Perceived Stress Scale
[22] has been used world-wide, and has been translated in 25 languages. It measured the degree
to which life in the past month had been experienced as unpredictable, uncontrollable and
overwhelming on a scale from 0 = “never” to 4 = “very often”. Following recommendations by
the review of Lee [23] we used the 10 item scale. The German version of the scale showed good
construct validity [24]. In the present study scores on the Perceived Stress Scale demonstrated
acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .84).
The Copenhagen Personal Burnout Inventory (CBI; [25]) is part of the Copenhagen Psy-
chosocial Questionnaire assessing physical and mental exhaustion, independently from work.
It assessed the frequency of six items („How often do you feel . . .“): “tired, physically, emotion-
ally exhausted, unable to go on, weak and prone to illness.” The items were rated on a 5-point
scale 1 = “never/ almost never”, 2 = “rarely”, 3 = “occasionally”, 4 = “often” to 5 = “always”
(COPSOQ; [26]). The scale was reliable (Cronbach alpha in the present study = .91 and showed
good criteria validity in a former study [27]).
Life satisfaction was operationalized by the Questionnaire on Life Satisfaction (FLZM) and
social integration was measured by the brief Loneliness Scale (LS-S). The Questionnaire on Life
Satisfaction FLZM [28] is a multi-dimensional self-report measure of individual life satisfaction
covering eight relevant areas of life (friends, leisure time activities/hobbies, general health,
income, work/ career, housing/living conditions, family life and partnership/sexuality). The
sum score of all dimensions was used as an index of global life satisfaction. Respondents rated
the present satisfaction with these dimensions on a scale from 1 = “dissatisfied” to 5 = “very sat-
isfied”. The scale is valid and has been applied in diverse studies [29]. As the scale assessed con-
ceptually different domains, the life satisfaction sum-scores indicated only sufficient internal
consistency (Cronbach alpha = .70).
The brief Loneliness Scale (LS-S; [30] reliably assessed emotional and social loneliness. The
three items (“how often do you feel that. . . “you are missing the company of others”, “being
left out” and “being socially isolated”) were rated on a 5-point scale from 0 = “never”, 1 =
“rarely”, 2 = “sometimes”, 3 = “often” to 4 = “very often”. Cronbach alpha in the present study
was = .84.
Statistical Analysis
For all analyses the GPS-K was used as a continuous measure. Age was categorized by decades.
The age group from 14 to 29 years was grouped together, so that the different age groups had
comparable sample sizes. Further, participants are expected to undergo and complete their aca-
demic and vocational training during this age period. Thus, we wanted to determine the effect
of educational training, respectively student status on procrastination by comparing students
and pupils with those without any ongoing educational training within the age group from 14
to 29 years. A one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons (Scheffé test) was conducted for
group comparisons using procrastination as dependent and age groups, respectively employ-
ment status as independent variables. One-sided t-tests, were used to analyze group differences
in regard to socio-demographic variables. Post hoc ANCOVA with age as a covariate was cal-
culated. Associations of procrastination with distress, stress and life satisfaction and loneliness
were determined by Pearson correlations. Correlations in the order of .10 were considered
small, those of .30 of moderate and beyond .50 of strong magnitude [31]. A linear regression
was performed defining the sum score of the GPS-K as outcome variable. Due to the
Procrastination, Distress and Life Satisfaction

 exploratory nature of the analysis, the predictors were selected by a stepwise method. As this
was an exploratory study alpha adjustment was not performed. Because of the large number of
tests applied in this study, p-values should be interpreted with caution and in connection with
effect estimates. We performed calculations by SPSS Version 21.0.
Results
Procrastination according to sociodemographic characteristics
Table 2 shows the comparisons of mean scores in the GPS-K in different sociodemographic
groups. There were no overall differences in sex or education (not presented). Participants liv-
ing in a partnership scored significantly lower on the GPS-K than singles. Students and unem-
ployed participants reported higher levels of procrastination compared to employed and
retired individuals. Participants with a high self-assessed tendency to procrastinate reported
significantly lower incomes. As age correlated with income, age was considered as a covariate
in the analysis with a significant result (F[1, 2442] = 19.4, p <.001; age F[1, 2442] = 100.1, p
<.001).
Procrastination across the life span
Fig 1 presents procrastination scores across the entire life span, separately for men and for
women. As hypothesized, there was a significant main effect for age (F(5, 2504) = 27.0; p
<.001). Post hoc analysis revealed that procrastination was highest in the youngest group (14
to 29 years) declining across the older age groups. A significant sex difference was only found
in the youngest, but not in the other age groups (t = 2.5, p <.05, d = 0.25). In the age group
from 14 to 29 years, students and pupils reported more procrastination compared to their
employed peers (t = 2.1, p <.05, d = 0.29).

 Associations of procrastination with distress, perceived stress and life
satisfaction
As Table 3 shows, all correlations were in the direction hypothesized and of low to moderate
magnitude. Procrastination was most strongly associated with perceived stress followed by
depression anxiety and fatigue. The association with overall life satisfaction was negative. All
individual domains of life satisfaction were significantly negatively associated with

 procrastination (range from r = .13 to r = .31); the correlations between procrastination and
satisfaction with work, respectively income were highest.
Moderate associations were found between depression, anxiety and fatigue and between
perceived stress and depression and anxiety. Moderate to strong and consistent negative corre-
lations were found between life satisfaction, depression, and anxiety.
Predictors of procrastination
As table 4 shows, lower age, male sex, lack of a partnership, unemployment, the presence of
depression, stress and fatigue were predictive of procrastination in a multivariate analysis,
explaining 24% of variance.
Discussion
Unlike most previous studies on procrastination, we conducted a representative community
survey covering a broad spectrum of mental health characteristics and life domains across the
entire life span from 14 to 94 years. As hypothesized and consistent with previous studies, pro-
crastination was highest in the youngest cohort (14–29 years). We have not found a consistent
sex effect, however, only in the youngest (and most strongly procrastinating group) from 14–
29 years, men procrastinated more than women. Previously inconsistent findings on sex effects
may have been due to different age compositions in different samples. Procrastinating was
higher among singles, in unemployed (vs employed and on pension), and students.
Cleary, procrastination, as we assessed it, was associated with a high level of perceived stress,
depressiveness, anxiety, fatigue and reduced life satisfaction across a whole range of domains
(work, leisure time etc.). In a multiple regression model, in addition to age and sex, lack of a
partnership was a predictor of procrastination, along with unemployment, depression, per-
ceived stress and fatigue.
How can the negative association of procrastination and age be explained? Several reasons
can be hypothesized regarding the development of personality, time perception, coping styles
over the life span, and cohort effects:
As reported by McCrae et al. [32], conscientiousness has increased with advancing age, a
personality trait which is strongly negatively associated with procrastination [16]. According to
the maturity principle [33] conscientiousness is essential for successfully achieving develop-
ment tasks like assuming responsibilities of adult work and family life. Indeed, looking more
closely at the youngest age group, participants undergoing education or vocational training
procrastinated more than their working peers. This is an important finding as many studies on

 procrastination were based solely on student samples. As the high procrastination among
unemployed may indicate, work schedules may provide a structure of time and demand coun-
teracting procrastination, whereas less structured educational programs may require more
active scheduling by the student or trainee leaving more opportunities for procrastination. A
further explanation for our finding might be that older adults use more effective and content
specific problem solving strategies than young adults [34] leading to less procrastination com-
pared to less appropriate strategies e.g. an avoidant problem solving style [35]. Moreover, the
perception of time might chance across the life span influencing the association between pro-
crastination and age: According to Socioemotional Selectivity Theory [36] older adults perceive
time as limited in contrast to younger adults, who may perceive more options, choices and
chances available in their future. Interestingly, in a recent study 85 students were given a
restricted time window for studying for a forthcoming exam. The restriction of available work-
ing time increased the learning efficiency and significantly reduced the tendency to procrasti-
nate [37]. If time is perceived as more valuable and scare, individuals may use the available
time by implementing instead of postponing actions. There also has been evidence that non-
procrastinators tended to perceive their use of time to be more purposive and they showed
higher levels in time control [1].
There may also be cohort effects, e,g. the youngest German cohort might be influenced by
affluence, individual workings conditions and internet availability having changed over time.
Compared to the older ones, the younger cohorts have grown up in a climate of economic and
educational affluence and stability offering an increasing range of vocational and life style
chances. While choice is considered as pivotal for autonomy and psychological well-being in
Western countries, choice overload can induce negative outcomes like paralysis and poor deci-
sion-making [38; 39]. Likewise, in our psychotherapeutic practice we have been observing that
the variety of options can be challenging for young people suffering from mental illnesses who
tend to procrastinate (c.f. [40] for trait procrastinators seeking counselling). This clinical obser-
vation is in accord with previous evidence suggesting that individuals with a less developed ego
identity status (e.g. diffusion status) showed higher tendencies to procrastinate in emerging
adulthood, probably to avoid making fateful and identity-shaping decisions [41; 42]. Moreover,
in recent years, the internet has become an integral part of everyday life and is widely used in
working and educational environments. Online activities providing constant distractions from
scheduled tasks may encourage procrastination and can even considered as a key aspect of
problematic internet use, a phenomenon which affects mainly the young generation [43; 44].
Consistent with previous studies, we found pervasive negative associations of procrastina-
tion with successful mastery in virtually all life domains. Deliberately postponing actions can
create a high level of discomfort and distress (e.g. [45]), and individuals with the tendency to
procrastinate were consistently stressed, distressed and fatigued. These associations underscore
the convergent and discriminant validity of the short scale of the GPS used.
Yet, in a cross-sectional study, causality cannot be determined. I.e. procrastination and asso-
ciated failure may reduce self-efficacy and lead to negative consequences regarding mental
health. On the other hand, depression, anxiety and fatigue may induce procrastination. Indeci-
siveness is a core criterion of depression. Avoidance of tackling demands out of a fear of failure
is one of the hallmarks of the major anxiety disorders, which may finally compromise voca-
tional achievement. On the other hand, prolonged unemployment may lead to reduced mental
health and self-efficacy promoting procrastination.
Data were limited to self-report. Therefore the findings of the study can be considered valid
for self-assessed procrastination, however, not necessarily to observable procrastinating behav-
ior [6]. We currently have no clearly defined cut-off score of the General Procrastination Scale.
While our sample was representative of the German community, we cannot preclude that

 people with an extreme level of procrastination may have not participated due to a lack of
intrinsic motivation for action [46]. Overall, our data supported the conceptualization of pro-
crastination as a maladaptive self-regulatory strategy. The connection between distress and
procrastination in this study has important implications for identifying risk groups, who may
also delay necessary medical, particularly mental health treatment [9; 12]. In further analysis
we will focus on the association between procrastination and media use in adolescents and
young adults which might be a major distraction, particularly for those who do not have a regu-
lar work schedule like students and unemployed. As discussed earlier, future studies exploring
the possible mediating role of identity status in different age groups (not only in emerging
adulthood) are required to develop a deeper understanding of the relation between procrastina-
tion and age. Given the broad negative associations of procrastination with vocational success
and interpersonal integration, stress and distress, prospective studies are needed to determine
developmental trajectories, identifying risk factors and mechanism of procrastination.
