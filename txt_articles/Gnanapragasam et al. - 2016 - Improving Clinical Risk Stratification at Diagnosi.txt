Abstract
Introduction
Over 80% of the nearly 1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer annually worldwide
present with localised or locally advanced non-metastatic disease. Risk stratification is the
cornerstone for clinical decision making and treatment selection for these men. The most
widely applied stratification systems use presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) con-
centration, biopsy Gleason grade, and clinical stage to classify patients as low, intermedi-
ate, or high risk. There is, however, significant heterogeneity in outcomes within these
standard groupings. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has recently
adopted a prognosis-based pathological classification that has yet to be included within a
risk stratification system. Here we developed and tested a new stratification system based
on the number of individual risk factors and incorporating the new ISUP prognostic score.
Methods and Findings
Diagnostic clinicopathological data from 10,139 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer
were available for this study from the Public Health England National Cancer Registration
Service Eastern Office. This cohort was divided into a training set (n = 6,026; 1,557 total
deaths, with 462 from prostate cancer) and a testing set (n = 4,113; 1,053 total deaths, with
327 from prostate cancer). The median follow-up was 6.9 y, and the primary outcome mea-
sure was prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). An external validation cohort (n =
1,706) was also used. Patients were first categorised as low, intermediate, or high risk
using the current three-stratum stratification system endorsed by the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The variables used to define the groups
(PSA concentration, Gleason grading, and clinical stage) were then used to sub-stratify
within each risk category by testing the individual and then combined number of risk factors.
In addition, we incorporated the new ISUP prognostic score as a discriminator. Using this

 approach, a new five-stratum risk stratification system was produced, and its prognostic
power was compared against the current system, with PCSM as the outcome. The results
were analysed using a Cox hazards model, the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves, compet-
ing-risks regression, and concordance indices. In the training set, the new risk stratification
system identified distinct subgroups with different risks of PCSM in pair-wise comparison (p
< 0.0001). Specifically, the new classification identified a very low-risk group (Group 1), a
subgroup of intermediate-risk cancers with a low PCSM risk (Group 2, hazard ratio [HR]
1.62 [95% CI 0.96–2.75]), and a subgroup of intermediate-risk cancers with an increased
PCSM risk (Group 3, HR 3.35 [95% CI 2.04–5.49]) (p < 0.0001). High-risk cancers were
also sub-classified by the new system into subgroups with lower and higher PCSM risk:
Group 4 (HR 5.03 [95% CI 3.25–7.80]) and Group 5 (HR 17.28 [95% CI 11.2–26.67]) (p <
0.0001), respectively. These results were recapitulated in the testing set and remained
robust after inclusion of competing risks. In comparison to the current risk stratification sys-
tem, the new system demonstrated improved prognostic performance, with a concordance
index of 0.75 (95% CI 0.72–0.77) versus 0.69 (95% CI 0.66–0.71) (p < 0.0001). In an exter-
nal cohort, the new system achieved a concordance index of 0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.84) for
predicting PCSM versus 0.66 (95% CI 0.63–0.69) (p < 0.0001) for the current NICE risk
stratification system. The main limitations of the study were that it was registry based and
that follow-up was relatively short.
Conclusions
A novel and simple five-stratum risk stratification system outperforms the standard three-
stratum risk stratification system in predicting the risk of PCSM at diagnosis in men with pri-
mary non-metastatic prostate cancer, even when accounting for competing risks. This
model also allows delineation of new clinically relevant subgroups of men who might poten-
tially receive more appropriate therapy for their disease. Future research will seek to vali-
date our results in external datasets and will explore the value of including additional
variables in the system in order in improve prognostic performance.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Prostate cancer incidence is rising worldwide, and, with improved detection, increasing
proportions of men are presenting with non-metastatic disease (over 80%). Amongst
these men, the disease is heterogeneous, and different management options are possible.
• Risk stratification is the primary method of deciding which treatment is appropriate for
an individual. However, the current method of risk stratification is based on historical
data and was not originally validated against prostate cancer mortality as an outcome.
Moreover, no current risk stratification system has been developed first in an unscreened
population, which represents the vast majority of men presenting with prostate cancer
worldwide.

 • Current risk models therefore require improvement to be more relevant for the manage-
ment of prostate cancer in patients. In this study, we sought to improve clinical risk
stratification by refining the attributes that make up the current risk stratification system
and incorporating the latest pathological grading system for prostate cancer from the
International Society of Urological Pathology.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We studied a large dataset from a cohort of UK patients. Data from 10,139 men were
available, and the cohort was split into a training group and a testing group for analysis.
• Clinico-pathological characteristics at diagnosis (including clinical stage, biopsy grade,
and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration) were used first to categorise patients
according to the standard three-stratum risk stratification system (from the UK NICE
guidelines). These same three individual characteristics were then used to sub-stratify
within each risk group. In addition, we incorporated the new pathological prognostic
grading system (score 1–5) recently adopted by the International Society of Urological
Pathology.
• We found that the new risk model (with five subgroups) was significantly better at iden-
tifying patient populations with very different outcomes in terms of prostate-cancer-spe-
cific mortality. The model performance held true even when other competing risks of
death were included. Most importantly, the model demonstrated improved prognostic
power in comparison to the NICE stratification system, both in our primary cohort and
in a separate external validation cohort.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• To our knowledge, this study is the first to test the standard three-stratum risk stratifica-
tion system in an unscreened first diagnosis population and to measure this system’s
ability to predict prostate-cancer-specific mortality. We show that this model has a poor
concordance for predicting mortality outcome at the point of diagnosis and is probably
of little value in this context.
• Our new model performs much better and not only improves prediction of mortality
but also provides better distinction of patient subgroups to inform clinical decision mak-
ing. Moreover, the cohorts used for our study are more representative of real-world
practice, where screening for prostate cancer is uncommon.
• These findings do need further validation in independent external cohorts, and our
study is limited by its reliance on cancer registry records and relatively short follow-up.
• Nevertheless, the large sample size and the consistency of our findings in external valida-
tion suggest that these findings are robust and ready for clinical use. The new model
does not require any additional variables other than those routinely collected at diagno-
sis in any clinic setting worldwide and will therefore be simple to adopt internationally.

 Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most common male cancers in the world, with nearly a million
men diagnosed annually, and its incidence is increasing [1,2]. It is estimated that the number
of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the UK alone will approach 70,000 per annum by 2030, an
increase of 69% over the current incidence [3]. Of this population, over 80% will be men pre-
senting with localised or locally advanced non-metastatic disease. This demographic, therefore,
is and will increasingly become a major burden for healthcare systems internationally [4].
Risk estimation is the cornerstone of management for these men. The most widely used sys-
tem is the three-stratum D’Amico classification first described in the late 1990s [5]. This origi-
nal model has been widely adopted by different international guideline groups and
organisations, although with some variations [6–8]. All, however, rely on the same clinico-
pathological information available at diagnosis: the presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
concentration, the Gleason pathological grade sum, and clinical stage. This information is used
to classify patients as low, intermediate, or high risk using specific cutoff values, which then
guides treatment decisions [5–8]. It is now clear that within these standard groupings there
exists significant heterogeneity in outcomes [9,10]. Key problems from this heterogeneity
include the overtreatment of many indolent cancers and the converse issue of undertreatment
of men with potentially aggressive disease. Recognising this, the International Society of Uro-
logical Pathology (ISUP) has recently adopted a prognosis-based pathological classification of
prostate cancer based on a re-evaluation of the association of Gleason grading with treatment
outcome [11]. This development is particularly welcome as work from our own centre and oth-
ers has shown significant grade inflation in contemporary cohorts that is not necessarily linked
to a poorer outcome [12,13].
A number of organisations have sought to improve risk stratification and identify subgroups
with different outcomes. The US National Comprehensive Cancer Network has, for instance,
included a very low-risk group (based on the percentage of positive biopsies) and a very high-
risk group (based on clinical stage) in their guidelines [8]. The UCSF-CAPRA (University of
California, San Francisco Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score in addition to the stan-
dard variables also considers the percentage of positive prostate biopsies (<34% or �34%) and
patient age (<50 or �50 y) to improve prediction of risk [14]. The Genitourinary Radiation
Oncologists of Canada (GUROC) group is currently exploring new risk models using recursive
partitioning to better predict biochemical-relapse-free survival after radiotherapy [15]. Very
importantly, however, none of these current risk models were originally developed in cohorts
of newly diagnosed patients, nor do they use prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) as an
outcome.
A novel approach to risk sub-stratification was recently reported by the EMPACT group in
patients with high-risk surgically treated prostate cancer [16]. The EMPACT study demon-
strated that better and poorer performing subgroups could be identified by considering the
number of high-risk factors an individual had. In this current study, we explored whether this
notion could be applied in other prostate cancer risk stratification systems and in the context
of predicting prognosis in a primary diagnosis population. We also considered the impending
changes in the pathological classification from ISUP. In the new classification, five prognostic
groups will be defined and reported together with classical Gleason grading [17]. These prog-
nostic groups have yet to be included and evaluated within any contemporary risk stratification
system. Our goal was to test whether a new clinical risk stratification model could be developed
that would provide a better predictive model for PCSM at the point of first diagnosis.

 Methods
Study Cohorts
Primary prostate cancers (ICD-10 code C61) diagnosed in residents of the East of England Can-
cer Network area between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2010 were registered by the Public
Health England National Cancer Registration Service Eastern Office (NCRS[E]). This area covers
2.67 million people (1.32 million men). Recent reports have highlighted the completeness of
information at NCRS(E) [18]. Primary sources of information included electronic and paper-
based reports, clinical notes, and pathology results from ten hospitals, of which only two were
academic centres. The data are therefore closely representative of real-world contemporary clini-
cal practice. Cases with any metastatic involvement (as documented by M stage disease and/or
positive bone or CT scan) were excluded. The stage assigned to each tumour was an integrated
TNM stage (fifth edition up to 2009 and seventh edition in 2010) at diagnosis and was assigned
by the NCRS(E) consultant oncologist and/or consultant histopathologist based on combined
clinical, imaging, and pathological information. Subdivision within each T stage was available for
only a minority of cases; hence, stage was ascribed as T1, T2, T3, or T4 only. Similarly, there were
no data available on the number or percentage of core involvement from diagnostic biopsies as
this parameter is not recorded in registry data. Electronic death notifications were received from
the Office for National Statistics. Vital status was also checked using the Health and Social Care
Information Centre Personal Demographics Service batch tracing system (http://systems.hscic.
gov.uk/demographics/pds/). Cause of death was classified as prostate cancer specific when listed
in cause 1[a], 1[b], or 1[c] of the death certificate, except when a cancer with a markedly worse
prognosis was listed in cause 1[a]. Survival times were calculated from the date of diagnosis to
date of death (prostate cancer specific and all cause) or date of censoring (30 September 2013).
The median follow-up was 6.9 y for the primary cohort. Only cases with all components of diag-
nostic stage, primary and secondary grade, and presenting PSA (ng/ml) as well as data on follow-
up and survival were included as these variables were essential to build the risk model. Any cases
where these data were missing were therefore not included. The final primary cohort used for the
testing and training sets therefore comprised 10,139 individuals in total, with 789 prostate cancer
deaths and 2,610 overall deaths. To validate the results, we sourced an available independent
dataset from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, which has information on all population
PSA tests linked to prostate cancer diagnosis and death covering a similar time period and with
all data fields available as above. This cohort comprised 1,706 individuals, with 43 prostate cancer
deaths, 144 all-cause deaths, and a median follow up of 4.8 y.
Statistical Analysis
Using the cohort of 10,139 men, we used a split-sample validation method to develop and test
the model, with random seed number generation to divide the cohort into 60% (n = 6,026;
1,557 total deaths, with 462 from prostate cancer) as a training set and 40% (n = 4,113; 1,053
total deaths, with 327 from prostate cancer) as a separate validation testing set. The primary
outcome of interest in this study was PCSM. Patients were initially categorised as low, interme-
diate, or high risk based on the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
risk stratification system, which is itself derived from the widely accepted D’Amico classifica-
tion [5,7]. The individual variables used to define the groups (PSA concentration, Gleason
pathological grade sum, and clinical stage) were then used to sub-stratify within each risk cate-
gory by testing the individual and then combined effect of the number of risk factors.
In addition, we used the proposed new ISUP prognostic score as a discriminator [17]. Nota-
ble features of the new scoring system are the independent value of a Gleason 4 + 3 histological

 diagnosis (ISUP prognostic score 3) and sub-classification of Gleason sum 8 and 9–10 (ISUP
prognostic scores 4 and 5, respectively). Based on this, we derived a new risk stratification sys-
tem that identified five potential outcome groups for PCSM. This model was then compared
against the NICE stratification system in the training set. To compare survival differences
between each risk group, we applied a Cox hazards model and the log-rank test with pair-wise
comparisons. This analysis was then repeated for the testing set. The null hypothesis was no
difference between risk groups in the probability of an outcome event (prostate cancer death)
at any time point. For visual comparison and to explore estimation of survival time for each
risk group, Kaplan-Meier plots with 95% confidence intervals are presented for both training
and testing sets. Visual calibration plotting across the risk groups for both the NICE and the
new risk stratification system was also performed for the testing set by using Cox estimates at
10 y of follow-up. To test whether primary treatment modality had any effect on group survival
outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel test was used to compare the incidence rate ratios of radical
therapy uptake. Competing-risks regression using the Fine-Gray test was applied to include the
potential influence of non-cancer deaths on the performance of the model. Hazard ratios
(HRs) were generated and compared between the risk groups in the testing set.
For model discrimination, we used the somersd package in STATA to compute the rank
parameters concordance index. Sub-distribution HRs were used instead of HRs in the compu-
tation in the competing-risks analysis [19]. We then compared the performance of the new
model to the NICE stratification system. Concordance index comparison was also applied to
the external validation cohort. For model calibration with inclusion of competing risks, we
used a visual calibration plot across the risk groups for both the NICE and the new risk stratifi-
cation systems for the testing set. We plotted observed and predicted survival probability at 10
y for each of the risk groups. The STATA command stcrprep was used, which allows fitting of
Fine-Gray models [20]. A difference was considered statistically significant when the p-value
was less than 0.05. All data were anonymised at source in the NCSR(E) before being used for
analysis, and as a result no formal ethics review was deemed necessary for this study. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using STATA/MP version 12.1. The analysis for this study was
not preplanned, but we have included the analysis steps in S1 Text.
Results
Cohort Description and New Risk Stratification System Comparison
The demographic details of the primary study cohort are shown in Table 1. There was a good dis-
tribution across all clinico-pathological characteristics, and the distributions were representative
of contemporary disease presentation trends in the UK [3]. From this cohort, five new risk
groups were defined as described in the Methods (Table 2). These groups corresponded to sub-
classification of both intermediate-risk and high-risk cancers but maintained the current defini-
tion of low-risk disease. In both the training and testing sets, Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed dis-
tinct prostate cancer survival outcomes for the risk groups using the new stratification system
(Figs 1 and 2). The comparable prostate cancer survival curves of the current NICE stratification
system are also shown in Figs 1 and 2. Data on the distribution of cases and deaths as well as HRs
for each of the new risk groups for both sets are shown in S1 and S2 Tables. Visual calibration
plots showed that both the new risk model and the NICE stratification system were well cali-
brated in the testing set for each risk group (Fig 3). Finally, we also tested for any differences in
uptake of radical therapy between the new risk groups, which might have influenced survival out-
come. The breakdown of different treatments for each new risk group is shown in S3 Table. In a
test for homogeneity, the incidence rate ratios for radical therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or
brachytherapy) were not different between the new risk groups (S4 Table).

 Risk Group Sub-classification
Low risk.
Many studies have already shown that the traditional D’Amico low-risk group
identifies men with a very low incidence of prostate cancer mortality [12,21,22]. In our new
system, Group 1 encompassed all low-risk cancers, and the prostate cancer mortality rate was
correspondingly very low (Fig 1). This was seen in both the training and testing sets (Figs 1 and
2). Attempts to further sub-classify low-risk cancers using different PSA cutoffs or separating
T1 and T2 tumours did not lead to any better or worse performing group. Thus, we conclude
that low-risk cancers already represent a very indolent form of tumour, and further sub-stratifi-
cation is unlikely to be useful, at least using clinical parameters alone.

 Intermediate risk.
Intermediate-risk cancers represent the largest and most heteroge-
neous group in contemporary practice [8]. In the primary cohort alone, over 37% of the popu-
lation was intermediate risk (by the NICE stratification system). For our new stratification

 system, we hypothesised that a combination of intermediate-risk factors and/or primary Glea-
son 4 (ISUP prognostic group 3) alone might confer a greater risk of prostate cancer mortality
(Table 2). In the training set, we observed that men within Group 3 (which included these fac-
tors) had a much worse outcome compared to men with a single intermediate-risk factor
(Group 2): HR 3.35 (95% CI 2.04–5.49) versus 1.62 (95% CI 0.96–2.75), p < 0.0001 (Fig 1; S1
Table). This was further illustrated in a pair-wise comparison whereby Groups 2 and 3 repre-
sented distinctly different cohorts with regards PCSM (p < 0.0001) (Table 3). Men with only a
single intermediate-risk factor (Group 2) had a very favourable prognosis, with outcomes
approaching those of the lowest risk group in the study (Fig 1; S1 Table). These results were
recapitulated in the testing set, in that intermediate-risk cancers could be reclassified into two
distinct groups with very different HRs and outcomes: Group 3 HR 5.49 (95% CI 2.75–10.96)
versus Group 2 HR 2.42 (95% CI 1.17–4.98), p < 0.0001 (Fig 2; Tables S2 and 4).
High risk.
In the training set, we found that a combination of high-risk factors or ISUP
prognostic score 5 (Gleason grade 9–10) conferred the greatest risk of prostate cancer mortal-
ity, with a HR of 17.28 (95% CI 11.2–26.67) (Fig 1; S1 Table). This group also included T4 dis-
ease, but the contributing numbers were small (n = 77 in the whole cohort). Conversely, having
a single high-risk factor of Gleason grade 8 (ISUP prognostic score 4) or PSA > 20 ng/ml or
stage T3 conferred a much better outcome, with a HR of 5.03 (95% CI 3.25–7.80). These differ-
ences were clearly illustrated in a pair-wise comparison test where Groups 4 and 5 represented
statistically different groups (Table 3) (p < 0.0001). These findings were recapitulated in the
testing cohort. Here, the HRs were 21.56 (95% CI 11.52–41.07) for Group 5 and 7.05 (95% CI
3.69–13.46) for Group 4, respectively (p < 0.0001) (Fig 2; S2 Table). Pair-wise comparison fur-
ther illustrated the difference in outcome between the two groups (Table 4). These results sug-
gest a clear distinction in mortality outcomes within the traditional grouping of high-risk
disease that can be identified at diagnosis.

 Competing-Risks Analysis.
To account for deaths from other causes, we next carried out
competing-risks analysis in the testing set to see whether this had any effect on the HRs of our
new model. In this analysis, the results continued to demonstrate a good separation in survival
outcomes for the new risk model in intergroup comparisons and cumulative incidence curves
(Table 5; Fig 4). A log likelihood ratio test was also significantly different in favour of the new
risk groups in the testing set (p < 0.0001), suggesting that the new risk model provided a better
overall fit than the NICE stratification system. Calibration curves incorporating competing
risks in the testing set further demonstrated a good calibration of our model for all groups (S1
Fig). These data suggest that inclusion of competing risks does not adversely affect the perfor-
mance of our new risk model in discriminating subgroups with different prostate cancer sur-
vival outcomes.

 Concordance Index Comparison
Our analysis has shown that the proposed new stratification system is able to identify sub-
groups of men within each classical risk category (except in low-risk cancer) with distinctly dif-
ferent PCSM outcomes. A crucial question therefore is whether this translates into a better
prognostic model for PCSM compared to D’Amico-classification-based stratification systems
such as that recommended by NICE. To assess this, we compared the concordance index of the
new risk model and the NICE stratification system in the testing set with incorporation of com-
peting mortality risks. In this cohort, the three-stratum NICE risk stratification system had a
concordance index of 0.69 (95% CI 0.66–0.71) for predicting PCSM (Table 6). The new risk
stratification system, in comparison, had an improved index of 0.75 (95% CI 0.72–0.77) (p <
0.0001 for model discrimination). To further test the prognostic improvement of our new
model, we sourced an independent dataset from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. Details
of the cohort are shown in S5 Table. In this cohort, the NICE concordance index was 0.66
(95% CI 0.63–0.69) (Table 6). The new risk stratification system concordance index however
was higher, at 0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.84) (p < 0.0001) (Table 6). We interpret this validation
result with caution as this external cohort had a much shorter follow-up (4.8 y) and many
fewer death events (43 cancer deaths and only 144 overall deaths). Nevertheless, the fact that
our new model continued to show improved predictive power in this independent population
compared to the NICE stratification system is encouraging.
Discussion
This study has demonstrated a new stratification system that outperforms the standard three-
stratum risk stratification system in predicting the risk of PCSM at diagnosis in men with pri-
mary non-metastatic prostate cancer. A key reason for the success and widespread adoption of
the existing three-stratum system was its simplicity, based as it is on data routinely available at
diagnosis. As a result, this paradigm has remained essentially unchanged for two decades and
remains the first tool used by clinicians in counselling patients.
The primary clinical application of risk stratification is at the point of diagnosis, for treat-
ment recommendation and predicting prognosis [6–8]. There have not, however, been any risk
stratification systems that have been initially derived using this population. The original
D’Amico classification was derived from just over 1,500 US men treated by surgery and radio-
therapy, and used biochemical relapse as the primary outcome [5]. Other risk stratification sys-
tems and nomograms have also been built using data on outcomes after surgery or
radiotherapy [23–25]. The closest comparator to our current system is the UCSF-CAPRA
score. Originally derived from a series of 10,000 radical prostatectomies, its prognostic utility
was retested in a US-registry-based cohort of 10,627 men who received different therapies and
with a median follow-up only 5.9 y [26]. The score achieved good concordance in predicting
metastasis and cause-specific mortality for every point increase in the calculated risk score
(range 1–10). The source cohort, however, was a highly screened population, and, as a result,

 over 80% of new diagnoses were low to low-intermediate grade (Gleason 3 + 3/3 + 4), and 97%
had organ-confined T1–T2 disease. Moreover, over 50% of the cases were treated surgically,
and only 6% were managed by active surveillance/watchful waiting. This cohort is therefore
very different to contemporary unscreened populations (e.g., in the UK) where 15%–20% of
men present with locally advanced (T3–T4) disease, and conservative management is used in
14%–20% of men [7,27]. The UCSF-CAPRA score also requires data on the percentage of
biopsy core involvement, which is not routinely recorded or standardised outside the US. Con-
sidering these factors, unique features of the risk stratification system proposed in this paper
are its derivation from an unscreened primary diagnostic cohort (14% presenting with locally
advanced T3–T4 disease) and that it encompasses all treatment types, including a significant
proportion of men managed conservatively (19.7% in the primary cohort). Thus, our model is
more representative of a contemporary, real-world unscreened primary diagnosis population.
The proposed risk stratification system identifies five risk groups and may better lend itself
to informing therapy choices, though this awaits future evaluation. As an example, our new
model subdivides the previous intermediate-risk and high-risk groups into two further sub-
groups with different survival outcomes. These subgroups could potentially be used to better
determine which men should receive primary radical therapy or to stratify patients for treat-
ment intensification trials. Of note, the current NICE guidelines are already used to direct rec-
ommendations for therapy, despite the fact that they were not originally intended for use in
non-radical-therapy options nor calibrated against PCSM [7]. An intriguing question is
whether our new risk stratification system might help select the best first radical treatment for
an individual. Preliminary analysis suggests that the new system currently cannot preferentially
show the benefit of one therapy over another. The addition of refinements, e.g., biopsy content
and/or genomic markers, might allow this functionality in future.
There are inherent limitations in this study. It is based on registry records rather than a
national prospective study. We also did not have central pathology review. This study necessar-
ily included only men with intact data on stage, PSA concentration, and histological grade (to
be able to construct the individual risk assignments), and this may have biased our results. Our
follow-up is also relatively short in the context of prostate cancer, and we do plan to report the
ongoing and maturing outcome of this cohort. This is particularly important for assessing any
changes in PCSM in the lower risk groups. The cohort of patients in this study received differ-
ent treatments, and the pattern of treatment use has changed through the decade [27]. We
therefore cannot exclude the possibility that this might have biased survival outcomes, particu-
larly in the highest risk group (e.g., inadequate therapy early in the series with androgen depri-
vation treatment alone and without radical therapy). However, we did test for the relative rates
of radical curative therapy use and found no difference in proportional uptake in any group.
Stage data in this study were limited to organ-confined (T1–T2) and locally advanced (T3–T4)
categories, and sub-classifications were not available. It is, however, doubtful how much more
stratification clinical stage subdivision would offer, as clinical staging is known to often be inac-
curate [28,29]. Similarly, we did not have access to information on biopsy core involvement
from pathology reports. We note, however, that none of the other current risk stratification
systems based on national and international guidelines include the extent of core involvement
in all of their risk group assignments [6–8].
The recent advent of multiparametric MRI of the prostate and image-guided biopsies will
no doubt vastly improve the preciseness of diagnostic staging and the assessment of biopsy
core involvement and, in turn, improve the accuracy of our risk stratification system. Finally,
although we have used a relatively large training and testing set as well as an independent exter-
nal cohort, our model does need further validation in independent cohorts with more death
events and longer follow-up, and this is currently being explored. Our model was also not

 tested in this report for its ability to predict all-cause mortality compared to the current stratifi-
cation system. Further data points, including the addition of age stratification and co-morbid-
ity scores, may be needed for this purpose, and we will seek to address this in future
refinements of the stratification system and using larger cohorts. It is however noteworthy that
in competing-risks regression analyses, other causes of mortality did not alter the improved
predictive performance of our new risk stratification system.
In summary, we present here an improved but simple risk stratification system for prostate
cancer mortality in primary non-metastatic prostate cancer. This system is also, to our knowl-
edge, the first reported model to incorporate the new ISUP prognostic score (which will be
adopted by the World Health Organization in 2016). Importantly, we have not here sought to
construct an individualised prognostic tool; instead, we have looked to build on and refine the
most widely applied and clinically useful contemporary tool in risk-stratified management of
prostate cancer. Our key findings are the following: (i) reinforcement of the indolent nature of
the current low-risk category, (ii) identification of a subgroup of intermediate-risk men with a
favourable prognosis, (iii) evidence that men with a combination of intermediate-risk factors
or a single high-risk factor may have a very similar natural history, and (iv) identification of a
subgroup of high-risk men with a particularly poor outcome.
Our results need further validation but may already be useful in contemporary clinical prac-
tice in better stratifying patients at the point of diagnosis. We further propose that this model is
not static but provides an important new baseline to which additional prognostic information
can be added, such as patient age, co-morbidity, biopsy core involvement, functional MRI
characterisation, and molecular sub-typing. In this last regard, a number of genomic classifiers
have been proposed and have shown some promise in improving prognostic prediction at diag-
nosis [30,31]. These molecular tests are commonly based on the premise that clinical risk strati-
fication systems are already at the limit of prognostic power. As we have seen in this study, this
is not necessarily the case. Our new system, evaluated in nearly 12,000 men and using routinely
available clinical variables, had a high predictive ability for PCSM (concordance indices of
0.75–0.79), which is very similar to the published performance of genomic marker panels [32–
34]. Our ongoing research will test how the new model can be further improved with the inclu-
sion of these additional parameters. In the meantime, our new risk stratification system already
shows improved prognostic utility compared to the current NICE stratification system in pre-
dicting the risk of prostate cancer death for men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.
