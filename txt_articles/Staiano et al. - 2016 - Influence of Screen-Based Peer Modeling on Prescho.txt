Abstract
Objective—To determine the influence of screen-based peer modeling on children’s vegetable 
consumption and preference.
Methods—Forty-two children aged 3 to 5 years were randomly assigned to individually view a 
DVD segment of peers consuming a modeled vegetable (bell pepper) vs. a non-food DVD segment 
vs. no DVD. Analysis of covariance models examined bell pepper preference and consumption 
during initial DVD exposure (Day 1) and without DVD exposure (Days 2 and 7), adjusted for age, 
sex, body mass index, and initial bell pepper consumption.
Results—Children in the vegetable condition ate more bell peppers (15.5g) than the control 
condition (5.9g; p=0.0397; model η2=0.85) at Day 7, without differences at Days 1 or 2. Among 
children who ate the modeled vegetable, those in the vegetable DVD condition reported higher 
preference towards eating the vegetable again (p=0.01).
Conclusions and Implications—Screen-based peer modeling is a promising tool to influence 
children’s vegetable consumption.

INTRODUCTION
One third of American children aged 4 years and younger consume zero vegetables on a 
typical day.1 Increased vegetable consumption is linked to improved diet quality and 
decreased total energy intake.2 Food neophobia, or the fear of unfamiliar foods, may account 
for many preschoolers’ low vegetable consumption.3 Early life experiences involving 
vegetables may have a lasting positive impact on future dietary habits.4,5

 Peer modeling influences preschoolers’ food choices. In a prior trial, seventeen children ages 
2 to 4 years tasted and reported preference for nine vegetables, then each child was seated in 
a lunchroom with 3 or 4 peers who selected the target child’s least preferred vegetable to eat. 
By the fourth day of peer modeling, the majority of the target children selected the 
previously least preferred vegetable to model peers’ behavior.4 With digital screens 
becoming ubiquitous in children’s lives, peer models are now being integrated into media 
platforms including DVD. The “Food Dudes” DVD, which displays cartoon animated peers 
who enjoy eating fruits and vegetables in conjunction with an external rewards system (i.e. 
stickers given for tasting/eating the fruit), significantly increased consumption of the 
modeled fruits and vegetables among children aged 4 to 11 years.6 It is unknown whether or 
not screen-based authentic peers (i.e. not animated) will influence younger viewers’ food 
choices and preferences without an external rewards system that is contingent on behavioral 
response.
The present study was modeled on social learning theory, as children develop new patterns 
of behavior by both observing others and direct experience.7 The primary purpose was to 
examine the efficacy of screen-based authentic peer modeling on preschoolers’ vegetable 
preference, selection, and consumption. It was hypothesized that children randomly assigned 
to view a DVD of peers consuming a modeled vegetable would be more likely to prefer, 
select, consume, and request the modeled vegetable, compared to children viewing a non-
food DVD segment or no DVD, during the initial exposure and 1 day and 1 week later.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a randomized controlled trial in which children were randomly assigned to one of 
three conditions: the “Copy-Kids™ Eat Fruits and Vegetables” DVD, the “Copy-Kids™ 
Brush Teeth” DVD, or a no-DVD control.
Participants and Recruitment
Forty-two children, aged 3 to 5 years and attending one of two full-day preschools, were 
recruited as participants. All study procedures were approved by Pennington Biomedical 
Research Center’s Institutional Review Board, and parents provided written informed 
consent. All procedures were explained in child-friendly terms, and a child could refuse to 
take part in the study at any time. See Figure 1 for the CONSORT diagram.
Procedures
Following the consenting process, parents completed a survey that reported child’s 
demographic information and eating behaviors. Block randomization was used to evenly 
distribute age and sex across conditions using a randomization schedule generated with SAS 
programming (SAS PROC PLAN). Each of the three study visits lasted 15 minutes and 
occurred at the preschool during the child’s normal morning snack time in a separate area 
that was quiet and free of distractions. Children attended study visits on two consecutive 
days (Day 1, Day 2) and a final visit one week later (Day 7 ± 2 days).

 Depending on condition, on Day 1 the child viewed one of two DVD clips or sat quietly for 
7.5 minutes. Two plates of snacks (the modeled vegetable and a comparison food) were 
placed in front of the participant in a standardized format (green bell peppers right, dry 
cereal left) on separate, identical white Styrofoam plates (Figure 2). Children were 
instructed to eat as much or as little as they wished during this time. The DVD segments 
were played concurrently during the food presentation, or a timer was set for 7.5 minutes for 
the control condition. Study staff weighed 0.5 cups of the modeled vegetable (i.e. 
approximately 80g of raw, sliced green bell pepper) and 0.5 cups of the comparison food 
(i.e. approximately 16g of Multi Grain Cheerios™; General Mills, Minneapolis, Minnesota) 
using a transportable scale before and after snack presentation at Days 1, 2, and 7. The 
nutrient composition of bell peppers and Multi-Grain Cheerios™ were as follows: 18 kcal, 
0.2g fat, 3mg sodium, 4.3g carbohydrates, 2.2g sugar, and 0.8g protein and 54 kcal, 0.6g fat, 
58mg sodium, 11.8g carbohydrates, 3.1g sugar, and 1.2g protein, respectively.8
On Days 2 and 7, food items were presented for 7.5 minutes without the concurrent DVD 
presentation. At the end of each visit, the child was allowed to select a sticker as a token of 
appreciation. Researchers did not inform parents of which foods were presented to the child.
DVD Stimuli
The Copy-Kids™ DVD series (Santa Monica, CA) is commercially available and designed 
to encourage positive eating habits in young children (ages 6 months to 5 years). The Copy-
Kids™ “Eat Fruits and Vegetables” DVD contains individual segments for six vegetables and 
six fruits. The bell pepper segment features individual clips of five similarly aged toddlers 
(80% 3-4 years old; 60% female; 40% non-White) happily eating and vocally interacting 
with the food item (e.g. “bell peppers” stated 4 times; creatively playing with bell peppers 
by building a roller coaster out of slices). The Copy-Kids™ “Brush Teeth” segment was 
produced by the same company and features eight children of similar ages (88% 3-4 years 
old; 50% female; 37% non-White) modeling tooth brushing. Both segments were spliced to 
be 7.5 minutes in duration. The DVD was displayed on a Dell Latitude E6540 laptop with a 
15” screen. The sound level and laptop distance from the child was standardized within each 
school.
Measurements
The parent pre- and post-survey collected: 1) child demographic information; and 2) dietary 
habits and purchasing trends, including the child’s usual appetite (measured on a scale from 
1 to 4 where 1 is “Excellent”’ and 4 is “Poor”), current dietary habits (“On an average day, 
how many cups of fruits does your child eat?”), and home availability (i.e. “How many fruits 
and vegetables are available in the home?”).9 Parents selected fruits and vegetables 
consumed by their children on a regular basis, eaten in the past week, mentioned or 
requested in the past week, and purchased/available in the home during the past week, from 
a 12-item list of various fruits and vegetables (including bell pepper, the food featured in the 
7.5 minute Copy-Kids™ DVD stimulus). A handout was provided with examples of fruits/
vegetables apportioned into 1 cup to aid parents.10 Finally, media use was reported, 
including the child’s frequency of television usage during meal times (using a scale from 1

 to 6 where 1 is “Always” and 6 is “Never”) and total daily screen time (using a scale from 1 
to 3 where 1 is “<1 hour,” 2 is “1-2 hours,” and 3 is “>2 hours”).
On Day 1, the child was asked whether he or she had previously eaten a bell pepper. 
Children who viewed the “Eat Fruits and Vegetables” DVD were asked to point to the food 
from the DVD segment and verbally express the name of the food item immediately after 
watching the DVD to measure comprehension. Before the food selection task, a sub-set of 
children (n=22) were asked to describe how hungry they felt using a 3-point Likert-like 
Scale featuring figures with stomachs of varying fullness.11 After the food selection task, 
children were asked to describe how they felt while watching the DVD and eating the food 
items using a 3-point Likert-like Scale featuring faces of varying levels of enjoyment (items 
labeled “yummy,” “okay,” and “yucky”) using an adapted version of the validated 
Preschooler Food Preference Assessment Tool.12 Children were asked how they would feel 
about eating the modeled food again at a later time. Assessments were repeated on Days 2 
and 7.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS Version 9.4. Body mass index z-score (BMIz) was calculated 
based on parental report of child’s height, weight, and date of birth and categorized as 
overweight/obese if BMI ≥85th percentile.13 One participant was missing self-reported 
height and excluded from BMI analysis. One BMIz was imputed to be −4.0 because the 
participant’s parent-reported BMIz was outside the CDC bounds of BMIz (<−4.0).13
Differences in baseline characteristics were examined using t tests or chi square tests. 
Differences in outcomes between conditions were examined using ordered logistic 
regression analysis (preference towards modeled vegetable) and logistic regression analysis 
(selection of modeled vegetable and request of modeled vegetable), controlling for relevant 
covariates (age, sex, BMIz, and regular bell pepper consumption). Analysis of covariance 
was used to examine differences in consumption of the modeled vegetable among the three 
conditions, controlling for the same covariates plus initial bell pepper consumption at Day 1. 
Separate models were conducted for the immediate effects (Day 1) and longer-term effects 
(Day 2 and Day 7) using the full sample and the sub-set of children who consumed the bell 
pepper. Effect sizes were reported as partial eta-square (η2) and classified as small (0.01), 
medium (0.06), or large (0.14).14
RESULTS
Most participants were White (73.8%), and half were girls. Descriptive characteristics are 
reported in Table 1. There were no significant differences by condition in age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, or BMI status. At baseline, the majority of parents reported their child’s appetite as 
good to excellent (67.3%). Most parents reported having vegetables in the home most of the 
time or always (88.1%). Parents reported that the family did not frequently watch television 
during meals (54.8% rarely or never, 31.0% sometimes, and 26.2% most of the time or 
always). Parents reported that their child spent less than 1 hour/day in total screen-time 
(38.1%), 1 to 2 hours/day (47.6%), or more than 2 hours/day (14.3%). There were no 
differences by condition in children’s baseline eating, screen-time, or hunger.

 Exposure Verification
Among the 14 participants in the vegetable DVD group, ten correctly identified the modeled 
food as bell pepper, two participants pointed to bell pepper but did not identify it by name, 
one child said “pepper” but refused to point to a food item, and one child refused to answer.
Sensitivity Analysis
At baseline, nine children were reported as regular bell pepper eaters by parents (21.4%). 
When the child was asked whether or not he/she had eaten bell pepper before, 11 answered 
yes, 27 answered no, and 4 answered “don’t know.” Parents’ report of their child’s bell 
pepper consumption was discrepant from children’s report of whether or not they had eaten 
bell pepper before: of the 9 children reported by parents as regular bell pepper eaters, 6 
children reported having never eaten bell peppers before. Children whose parents reported 
them as regular bell pepper eaters consumed more bell peppers at Day 1 (p=0.018), Day 2 
(p=0.048), and Day 7 (p<0.01). Therefore, regular bell pepper consumption was included as 
a covariate.
Selection and Consumption of Modeled Vegetable
In multivariable-adjusted analysis, selection and consumption of the modeled vegetable and 
the comparison food did not differ by condition. The condition effect sizes were small (Day 
1, η2=0.02; Day 2, η2=0.02; Day 7, η2=0.004). However, when controlling for the amount 
consumed at Day 1, there was a significant condition difference in the amount consumed of 
the modeled vegetable at Day 7 (p=0.047). Post hoc Tukey tests indicated that children in 
the vegetable DVD condition ate significantly (p=0.0397) more bell pepper (15.5g) 
compared to children in the no-DVD control condition (5.9g), with children in the control 
DVD in the middle (11.8g) (Figure 3). The model effect size was large (η2=0.85), and the 
condition effect size was small (η2=0.02).
Children in the vegetable DVD condition ate significantly less green bell pepper and dry 
cereal during Day 1 while they were watching the DVD compared to the follow-up visits 
when they did not view the DVD, at Day 2 (p=0.049 for bell peppers and p=0.006 for cereal) 
and Day 7 (p=0.047 for bell peppers and p=0.003 for cereal). There were no differences 
across time for children in the other two conditions.
Preference for Modeled Vegetable
In ordered logistic regression models, there was no significant difference by condition for 
children’s liking of the bell pepper (i.e. “Touch the face you made when you ate the bell 
pepper”) at Days 1, 2, or 7. Among those who ate the bell pepper, children in the vegetable 
DVD condition were significantly more likely to report preference towards eating the bell 
pepper in the future (i.e. “Touch the face that you would make if you ate the bell pepper 
again sometime”) at Day 7 (p=0.01) and were marginally more likely to report liking the bell 
pepper compared to the control condition at Day 7 (p=0.052).

 Request of Modeled Vegetable
After the experiment, there were no significant differences in parent-reported requests by the 
child for bell peppers (p=0.09), for parents purchasing or having the bell peppers available in 
the home (p=0.096), or parent-reported child vegetable or fruit consumption for the past 
week.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the influence of screen-based peer modeling on preschool children’s 
food choice behaviors. Consumption of the modeled vegetable and preference for eating the 
modeled vegetable again were higher 1 week after children viewed screen-based peer 
modeling versus the non-food control DVD condition and no-DVD control condition, after 
controlling for baseline consumption. However, consumption and preferences in the short-
term (during DVD exposure and 1-day after) did not differ based on screen-based modeling, 
nor were there transfer effects of the screen-based peer modeling on children’s overall 
vegetable consumption or requests at home. Importantly, this study examined the effect of 
authentic screen-based modeling on children’s food choices without an external reward 
system, unlike prior studies.8
Interestingly, for those children in the vegetable DVD condition, food consumption was 
lower at Day 1 while children viewed the vegetable DVD versus at Days 2 and 7 when they 
did not view the DVD. The DVD segment was potentially a distraction from energy intake. 
Previous studies presented the DVD immediately prior to, but not during snack times, thus 
avoiding this competing interest effect.15
Young children’s food preferences are positively correlated with frequency of encounters 
with those foods.1, 2 Preschool children who were repeatedly exposed to an initially disliked 
vegetable exhibited significant increases in liking by the sixth exposure.2 Therefore, future 
studies should examine the effects of repeated exposure to the vegetable DVD to examine 
enhanced motivation from repetitive peer modeling. Other future research directions include 
investigating different energy intake responses based on preference for the comparison food, 
the context of the snack, and the characteristics of the peer model. For instance, the children 
on the DVD ate green, red, and yellow bell pepper, whereas the experimental food provided 
was only green bell pepper; more closely replicating the color of the snack may improve 
modeled behavior.3 Another consideration is that many of the children had been previously 
exposed to bell peppers; selecting a food that is novel to all children may yield different 
results.
The strengths of this study include the equal sex distribution and the randomized controlled 
design. Further, the intervention was low in cost, time, and effort. Limitations include the 
potential for within-school contamination across conditions, the small sample size, and the 
short measurement timeframe. Neophobia was not explicitly measured and should be 
considered in future studies as an important influence on food selection. Children’s 
consumption and requests outside of the experimental setting were captured by parental 
report, using questions adapted from other sources.9

 Implications for Research and Practice
Screen-based peer imitation should be replicated with a larger and more diverse population 
of preschool-aged children to increase statistical power to identify between-group 
differences and improve generalizability of the findings. Screen-based peer imitation may 
emerge as a low cost, minimally invasive, and effective behavior change strategy to improve 
children’s vegetable consumption for use in preschool settings or as a tool in obesity 
prevention programs.
