abstract
CONTEXT: Swaddling is a traditional practice of wrapping infants to promote calming and sleep. 
Although the benefits and risks of swaddling in general have been studied, the practice in 
relation to sudden infant death syndrome remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct an individual-level meta-analysis of sudden 
infant death syndrome risk for infants swaddled for sleep.
DATA SOURCES: Additional data on sleeping position and age were provided by authors of 
included studies.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies that measured swaddling for the last or reference sleep 
were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Of 283 articles screened, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 65.5%; P = .03), and a 
random effects model was therefore used for analysis. The overall age-adjusted pooled 
odds ratio (OR) for swaddling in all 4 studies was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.97–2.58). Removing the most recent study conducted in the United Kingdom reduced the 
heterogeneity (I2 = 28.2%; P = .25) and provided a pooled OR (using a fixed effects model) 
of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.05–1.80). Swaddling risk varied according to position placed for sleep; 
the risk was highest for prone sleeping (OR, 12.99 [95% CI, 4.14–40.77]), followed by side 
sleeping (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.08–4.81]) and supine sleeping (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.27–2.93]). 
Limited evidence suggested swaddling risk increased with infant age and was associated 
with a twofold risk for infants aged >6 months.
LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity among the few studies available, imprecise definitions of 
swaddling, and difficulties controlling for further known risks make interpretation difficult.
CONCLUSIONS: Current advice to avoid front or side positions for sleep especially applies to 
infants who are swaddled. Consideration should be given to an age after which swaddling 
should be discouraged.

Swaddling is defined as close 
wrapping of an infant, usually with 
a light cloth and the head exposed, 
although swaddling styles vary 
across cultures. It has been reported 
that swaddling infants for sleep 
is gaining popularity in countries 
such as the United Kingdom and 
the United States, 
1–3 with several 
reported benefits to the practice. 
For the general population of young 
infants, these include more quiet 
sleep, 
3 fewer spontaneous arousals 
during quiet sleep, 
4 and a slight 
reduction in excessive crying in 
infants aged <7 weeks.5 Further 
benefits are observed for specific 
populations, including improvements 
in neuromuscular development 
for very low birth weight infants, 
6 
reduced physiologic and behavioral 
distress among premature infants, 
7 
and improved calming and sleep for 
infants with neonatal abstinence 
syndrome.8
Impaired cardiovascular control in 
association with a failure to arouse 
from sleep, leading to a reduced 
ability to respond to a cardiovascular 
stress (eg, profound hypotension), 
has been described as a potential 
mechanism leading to some sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS) 
deaths.9 It has also been proposed 
that, due to the effects of swaddling 
on sleep, swaddling could be used 
as an intervention to support supine 
sleep for parents who report that 
their infant has difficulty sleeping 
in this position.10 There is some 
evidence that infants who are 
swaddled and sleep supine exhibit 
greater heart rate responses to 
an auditory stimulus than infants 
sleeping supine nonswaddled.11 
In contrast, there is evidence that 
swaddling may increase the risk 
of SIDS, as swaddled infants have 
fewer spontaneous arousals from 
sleep and increased sleep time, 
particularly during quiet sleep, which 
is a state of reduced arousability.4 
In addition, those infants who were 
naive to swaddling (ie, not routinely 
swaddled) had higher induced 
arousal thresholds in both sleep 
states2 and reduced spontaneous 
arousability in active sleep.12 Beyond 
the field of SIDS, swaddling may 
also increase an infant’s risk for 
developmental dysplasia of the hip 
(especially if not applied well), 
13 
hyperthermia, 
1 pneumonia, and 
upper respiratory tract infections.14
To date, the association between 
swaddling and SIDS risk remains 
unclear, and to the best of our 
knowledge, no comprehensive 
review of the literature has been 
performed to determine the strength 
of this relationship. Although health 
professionals and parents need 
this information to help make safe 
infant care choices, currently no 
official guidance exists in the United 
Kingdom or the United States on this 
topic. The purpose of the present 
investigation was to conduct a 
systematic review of the literature 
on this issue and quantify, through 
meta-analysis and using individual 
data when possible, whether 
swaddling is associated with an 
increased risk of SIDS.
METHODS
Search Strategy
A thorough literature search was 
conducted to identify studies 
published from the 1950s to 
December 2014. A comprehensive 
search of online databases was 
conducted on 3 platforms (PubMed, 
Web of Science, and Ovid SP) and 
included Medline, AMED (Allied and 
Complementary Medicine), CAB 
Abstracts, Embase, PsycINFO, BIOSIS 
Citation Index, SciELO Citation Index, 
and Web of Science Core Collection. 
The following search terms were 
used: SIDS, SUDI, SUID, swadd* 
(to include swaddling, swaddled, 
and swaddle), wrap* (to include 
wrapping, wrapped), and swath* 
(to include swathe, swathing, and 
swathed). Swaddling, wrapping, 
and swathing are used alternately 
and may refer to different methods 
of swaddling in different countries; 
in general, these terms are used to 
describe the practice of wrapping 
an infant in blankets or cloth. In 
addition, the authors conducted 
secondary hand-searches of 
reference lists of all articles found 
in the online database search and 
requested unpublished data at 
national and international SIDS 
conferences.
Selection of Eligible Studies
The online database search returned 
389 results, and additional data from 
hand-searches and unpublished 
data (other sources) returned 15 
records; after removing duplicates, 
this total was reduced to 283. The 
initial screen of titles and abstracts 
excluded 272 records, and the 
remaining 11 full-text records were 
assessed. Studies were excluded 
if they were not case-control or 
cohort by design, if they did not use 
SIDS as an outcome, or if they did 
not mention swaddling or infant 
wrapping. Articles in languages 
other than English had the abstract 
translated for screening. There were 
2 studies in which it was unclear if 
wrapping was the same as swaddling; 
in both cases, the investigators were 
contacted to clarify the definition. 
Four studies were deemed eligible 
for inclusion in this review, 
15–18 
including 1 case-control study18 
in which the swaddling data were 
collected but remained unpublished. 
The screening process is detailed in 
Fig 1.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
With only 4 studies included in 
the review, data were extracted 
by hand individually from each 
article or source. The investigators 
were contacted where necessary to 
provide further data on postnatal 
age (in days) and the sleeping 
position (supine, side, or prone) in 
which swaddled and nonswaddled 
infants were placed (both control

subjects and infants with SIDS) for 
their last sleep and were found. The 
Newcastle-Ottowa scale was used to 
assess study quality.19, 
20
Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics included 
median and interquartile ranges 
(IQRs) for data that were not 
normally distributed. The χ2 test 
was used to compare proportional 
differences. The Mann-Whitney U test 
was used for continuous unpaired 
data. The final sleep of the SIDS case 
subjects was compared with the 
reference sleep of age-matched (on 
an individual basis) surviving control 
infants for 3 of the studies and age-
weighted (on a group basis) surviving 
control subjects for 1 study. Odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated by 
using χ2 tests. Logistic regression 
was used to adjust the findings for 
age. A meta-analysis was conducted 
with the use of a fixed effects model 
and a random effects model in which 
heterogeneity proved significant. 
The latter allows for heterogeneity 
by assuming that the true effect 
varies between studies. It provides a 
more conservative pooled estimate 
reflecting the greater uncertainty 
when using heterogeneous data. The 
strength of the association between 
swaddling and SIDS for each study 
was illustrated by using a forest plot. 
Data were pooled and analyzed by 
using Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Included Studies and Swaddling 
Prevalence
A total of 4 case-control studies 
that examined the association 
between swaddling and SIDS were 
included in the review, and the study 
characteristics are summarized 
in Table 1. The 4 studies span 
2 decades and 3 diverse areas: 
regions of England in the United 
3
Kingdom, Tasmania in Australia, 
and Chicago, Illinois, in the United 
States. None of the studies gave 
a precise definition of swaddling. 
Prevalence of swaddling during the 
different time periods varied in the 
3 areas suggested by the control 
populations. Prevalence was highest 
in the study from Tasmania in the 
late 1980s (35.7%) and much lower 
in Chicago in the mid-1990s (9.2%) 
and England (10.3%), with a slight 
decrease in England 10 years later 
(5.7%); the number of infants 
included in this latter study was 
small (only 87 control subjects). 
Across the studies, 17.5% of the 
infants with SIDS were swaddled 
for the last sleep compared with 
10.8% of similar-aged surviving 
control infants during a designated 
reference sleep. In all 4 included 
studies, the proportion of infants 
swaddled was higher in the SIDS 
cases than in the control cases; 
however, only in the 2 UK studies15, 
18 
was the univariate association 
significant, and only in the more 
recent of these studies15 did this 
significance remain after adjustment 
for other factors. The assessment of 
study quality indicated that these 
were good-quality observational 
studies (Table 2). All 4 studies 
used independent case definitions 
and consecutive case recruitment 
methods. They all used community 
control subjects and considered 
comparability in the design and 
analysis stages. None of the studies 
blinded the interviewer to case 
or control status (although this 
approach would have been unethical 
given the outcome under study). 
Nonresponse differences between 
case and control subjects were 
reported in 2 of the 4 studies, and 
the potential for bias was raised as a 
limitation.

Pooled Results and Heterogeneity
In total, 760 SIDS cases were 
compared with 1759 control 
subjects. The fixed effects model, 
assuming equal variance, suggests 
a significant pooled OR of 1.53 
(95% CI, 1.18–1.97; P = .001). 
However, the prevalence of 
swaddling between studies was 
variable, and an I2 statistic of 65.5% 
indicated significant and substantial 
heterogeneity between studies 
(P = .03). To adjust for the 
heterogeneity, a random effects 
model was applied, yielding a pooled 
OR of borderline significance (1.58 
[95% CI, 0.97–2.58]; P = .06). Looking 
more closely at the variance, the 
studies were homogeneous 
(I2 statistic of 28.2%; P = .25) 
when the most recent UK study 
was excluded. The pooled OR for 
swaddling during last sleep for the 
3 remaining studies, by using a fixed 
effects model of analysis (shown in 
Table 3), provided a summary OR 
that remained significant (OR, 1.38 
[95% CI, 1.05–1.80]; P = .02). The 
forest plot for this model is shown 
in Fig 2.
Swaddling and Infant Postnatal Age
Swaddled infants tended to be 
younger (median age, 57 days 
[IQR, 35–94 days], compared with 
96 days [IQR, 60–154 days] for 
nonswaddled infants in all 4 studies), 
although there was no significant 
difference (P = .23) between the 
5
age of the swaddled SIDS infants 
(median age, 55 days [IQR, 30–96 
days]) and swaddled control infants 
(median age, 61 days [IQR, 37–94 
days]). Figure 3 shows the age 
distributions of SIDS case and control 
infants swaddled and not swaddled. 
Swaddling in all groups peaked at 
∼2 months of age and dropped off 
steeply between 4 and 6 months of 
age. Although the numbers were 
small, the risk of SIDS from swaddling 
increased with age (Table 4), with the 
highest risk associated with infants 
aged ≥6 months (OR, 2.53 [95% CI, 
1.21–5.23]).
Swaddling and Sleeping Position
Data for position in which infants 
were placed for the last sleep were 
available from the UK and Chicago 
studies, whereas data for position 
in which infants were found were 
available in the UK and Tasmanian 
studies. In terms of position placed 
for the last sleep (Table 5), being 
swaddled and placed prone conferred 
the greatest risk, although this 
practice was rare. For both the prone 
and side positions, the risk doubled 
when the infant was also swaddled 
compared with nonswaddled.

Notably, there was still a small but 
significant risk associated with 
infants being swaddled and placed 
for sleep on their backs. In terms 
of position found for the last sleep 
(Table 6), being swaddled and found 
sleeping prone was a rare event 
among the control subjects (<1%) but 
was more frequent among the infants 
with SIDS (8%).The numbers were 
small, but even when the lower CI 
was used, the risk was 19-fold. Being 
found on the side while swaddled 
was a slightly higher risk than being 
placed on the side without swaddling. 
Again, being found swaddled on the 
back conferred a small but significant 
risk compared with being found on 
the back nonswaddled.
Only the 2 UK studies included data 
on both the sleeping position placed 
for the last sleep and position found. 
Of the 124 control infants who were 
swaddled, none was placed prone, 
those placed on their side either 
remained on their side (24 infants) 
or rolled on to their back (25 infants), 
and 1 control infant was placed 
supine and found prone. However,

among the 16 swaddled infants with 
SIDS found prone, 3 were placed 
and found prone, 8 were placed on 
their side and found prone, and the 
remaining 5 were placed supine and 
found prone; the mean age of these 
5 infants was >15 weeks (compared 
with 11 weeks among the other 
swaddled infants in these 2 studies).
DISCUSSION
The present analysis combines 
case–control data from 4 studies 
on the risk of SIDS for infants who 
were swaddled. The results from 
the individual-level meta-analysis 
revealed an age-adjusted pooled 
risk between swaddling and 
SIDS, although this finding was of 
borderline significance when the 
heterogeneity of studies was taken 
into account. The data extracted were 
limited to 4 studies from diverse 
regions, during different time periods, 
with variable prevalence rates for 
swaddling. The main source of 
heterogeneity seemed to originate 
from the latest study in the United 
Kingdom; the data for this study were 
collected at least 10 years after the 
other studies in this analysis. Although 
it is possible that this study is 
idiosyncratic, it may also indicate that 
interval changes in sleep practices 
in the United Kingdom have made 
the practice of swaddling more risky. 
Future observational studies will be 
needed to determine this possibility. 
Swaddling as a risk seemed to vary 
according to sleep position and older 
age. The significant risk of placing 
infants on their side or prone to sleep 
doubled when infants were swaddled, 
and the SIDS risk associated with 
swaddling increased with age.
It has been suggested that swaddling 
can be used to encourage supine 
sleep when families are having 
difficulty settling younger infants in 
this position.27, 
28 Evidence regarding 
the effectiveness of this strategy is 
limited, although a survey from Oden 
et al10 found that the supine position 
for sleep was more common in 
infants who were routinely swaddled 
than in those who were swaddled 
occasionally. The limited evidence 
from the analysis in the present 
article does not suggest that placing 
younger swaddled infants supine for 
sleep has a protective effect against 
SIDS, although further studies are 
needed to quantify whether this 
practice poses any risk. It has also 
been postulated that swaddling 
could decrease the risk for SIDS 
by making the side position more 
stable.29 Our evidence suggests 
this is not the case because the risk 
associated with being placed in the 
side position almost doubled among 
swaddled infants. Few infants were 
swaddled and placed prone, although 
this practice was significantly more 
common among the infants who 
died, and the risk of SIDS from being 
placed prone doubled among the 
swaddled infants. We already know 
that being found prone is strongly 
associated with SIDS, but this risk 
also increased fourfold among the 
swaddled infants. The handful of 
swaddled SIDS infants for whom we 
had data suggests that the majority of 
those found prone either moved into 
this position after being placed on 
their side or they were older infants 
who rolled from the supine to the 
prone position.
Swaddling was a more common 
practice among the younger infants, 
and the risk of SIDS linked to 
swaddling seemed to increase in 
older infants. This outcome may 
be related to a greater likelihood 
of rolling to a prone position at an 
older age. The advice given in the 
Netherlands, a country with low rates 
of SIDS, is to encourage swaddling to 
reduce excessive crying.30 Because of 
the likelihood of rolling to the prone 
position, the official advice in the 
Dutch guideline on excessive crying 
is never to initiate swaddling after 
the fourth month, to stop swaddling 
as soon as the child signals he or she 
is trying to turn over, and always 
to stop swaddling before the sixth 
month (after this age, infants will be 
able to roll over).
There are several limitations to 
the present meta-analysis. The 
heterogeneity between studies 
was substantial, reflecting the 
differing swaddling practices across 
countries and time periods. Due to 
the differences in control selection, 
it was not possible to use conditional 
logistic regression, which may have 
increased the power of detecting 
the pooled estimate. The high rates 
of swaddling in the study from 
Tasmania may reflect different 
cultural practices at the time of 
that particular study. Although the 
quality of the studies was high, none 
adequately described the swaddling 
technique, and the questions used 
in each study (provided by the 
investigators) sometimes used the 
terms wrapping and swaddling 
synonymously, when they might 
indicate different infant care 
practices. Safer forms of swaddling 
in the supine position have been 
explored in sleep laboratory studies 
of young infants, especially those 
considering normal hip development 
and chest pressure concerns, 
27 and 
guidelines are more specific in some 
countries than others. The individual-
level analysis adjusted swaddling 
for infant age and sleeping position 
but many other factors associated 
with SIDS were not adjusted for, in 
particular whether the infant was 
bed-sharing with the parents.
Given that the most recent (albeit 
small) case–control study included 
here found that swaddling was a 
significant risk in the multivariate 
analysis, future studies of SIDS risk 
should include a detailed assessment 
of swaddling to further understand 
this infant care practice. Future 
investigations of swaddling could 
include photographic measures of 
how a swaddled child was placed 
for sleep and found thereafter, 
which would improve swaddling 
classifications.

CONCLUSIONS
Despite the limitations, these analyses 
indicate that the current advice to 
avoid placing infants on their front or 
side to sleep may especially apply to 
infants who are swaddled. Given the 
marked increase in infants swaddled 
and found prone (rather than placed 
prone), coupled with an increased 
risk of swaddling with increased age 
regardless of sleeping position, health 
professionals and current guidelines 
should consider an appropriate age 
limit at which swaddling should be 
discouraged.
