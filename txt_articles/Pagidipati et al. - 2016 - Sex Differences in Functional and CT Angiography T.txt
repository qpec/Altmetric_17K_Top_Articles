Abstract
Background—Risk stratification is an important goal of cardiac noninvasive tests (NITs), yet 
little contemporary data exist on the prognostic value of different NITs by patient sex.
Objectives—To compare the results and prognostic information derived from anatomic versus 
stress testing in stable men and women with suspected coronary artery disease.
Methods—In 8966 PROMISE trial patients tested as randomized (4500 computed tomographic 
angiography [CTA], 52% female; 4466 stress testing, 53% female), we assessed the relationship 
between sex and NIT results using logistic regression, and the relationship between sex and a 
composite of death, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization using Cox 
proportional hazards models.
Results—In women, a positive CTA (≥70% stenosis) was less likely than a positive stress test 
(8% vs. 12%, adjusted OR 0.67 [95% CI 0.55-0.82]). Compared with negative tests, a positive

 CTA was more strongly associated with subsequent clinical events than a positive stress test (CTA 
adjusted HR 5.86 [95% CI 3.32-10.35]; stress adjusted HR 2.27 [95% CI 1.21-4.25]; adjusted 
p=0.028). Men were more likely to have a positive CTA than stress test (16% vs. 14%, adjusted 
OR 1.23 [95% CI 1.04-1.47]). Compared with negative tests, a positive CTA was less strongly 
associated with subsequent clinical events than a positive stress test in men, although this 
difference was not statistically significant (CTA adjusted HR 2.80 [95% CI 1.76-4.45]; stress 
adjusted HR 4.42 [95% CI 2.77-7.07]; adjusted p=0.168). Negative CTA and stress tests were 
equally likely to predict an event in both sexes (adjusted p-values=NS). A significant interaction 
between sex, NIT type, and test result (p=0.01) suggests that sex and NIT type jointly influence 
the relationship between test result and clinical events.
Conclusions—The prognostic value of an NIT result varies by test type and patient sex. Women 
appear to derive more prognostic information from a CTA, while men tend to derive similar 
prognostic value from both test types.
Keywords
coronary artery disease; gender; risk stratification; noninvasive testing
Two major goals of noninvasive tests (NITs) in patients with chest pain are the diagnosis of 
obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk stratification, as both diagnostic and 
prognostic information are essential to optimally guide subsequent management (1). Careful 
analyses of diagnostic accuracy have shown different test performances not only by modality 
but also by patient sex (2). These sex-related differences may be due to reasons as varied as 
baseline differences in electrocardiography (ECG) characteristics, breast attenuation, smaller 
coronary vessel size, and the higher prevalence of microvascular coronary dysfunction in 
women, giving rise to a higher rate of false positive test results in women (2-4).
Given these well-established variations by sex in diagnostic test performance, it is 
reasonable to postulate that NITs may also provide different prognostic information in 
women and in men. This in turn may result in differences in the relative value of anatomic 
versus stress testing for patients of each sex. Although older studies have compared the 
prognostic value of stress testing within each sex, there are few contemporary data on this 
issue (5-7). Furthermore, recent observational studies on the prognostic value of computed 
tomographic angiography (CTA) do not include sex-specific analyses (8,9). A fuller 
understanding of the prognostic performance of these tests could aid in selecting the 
diagnostic evaluation strategy for both women and men.
The Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) 
randomized 10,003 outpatients with stable symptoms suggestive of CAD to a strategy of 
either functional or anatomic (CTA) testing (10). Over a median follow-up period of 25 
months, there was no difference between testing arms in clinical events overall or by sex. 
However, the primary analysis did not compare the prognostic capabilities of the 2 types of 
tests in either women or men. Given the high percentage (53%) of women enrolled in this 
trial and the randomized selection of test type, it is an ideal setting in which to explore the 
associations between test results and clinical events in each sex. We hypothesized that the 2 
types of NITs, anatomical and stress testing, would have different likelihoods of being

 positive in women and in men, and that the relationships between a positive test result and a 
clinical event, compared with those of a negative test result, would be jointly influenced by 
patient sex and NIT type.
Methods
Study Cohort and Design
The PROMISE trial was a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial that randomized stable 
symptomatic patients without known CAD requiring noninvasive testing to either an initial 
strategy of anatomic (CTA) or stress testing (10,11). For patients in the stress testing arm, 
the choice of test was left up to the clinician (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, or 
stress nuclear). Randomization was stratified by study site and by the stress test type 
prespecified by the provider.
All tests were performed and interpreted by local physicians who were responsible for all 
subsequent clinical decisions. We defined a positive CTA to be one that showed obstructive 
CAD (i.e., ≥70% stenosis in at least one epicardial artery or ≥50% stenosis in the left main). 
An exercise ECG was considered positive if there were ST-segment changes consistent with 
ischemia during stress or early termination (<3 minutes) due to reproduction of symptoms, 
arrhythmia, and/or hypotension. A stress echocardiography or stress nuclear test was 
considered positive if there was inducible ischemia in at least one coronary territory 
(anterior, inferior, or lateral), or early termination of exercise stress (<3 minutes) due to ST 
changes consistent with ischemia, symptom reproduction, arrhythmia, and/or hypotension.
This secondary analysis included those patients who were tested as randomized and who had 
interpretable results, defined as not missing and not indeterminate. The primary endpoint 
was the same as that of the overall trial (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial 
infarction [MI], or unstable angina hospitalization), except that the major procedural 
complication component was omitted because it was not believed to be related to the 
prognostic value of the test. A composite of time to cardiovascular death or MI was a 
secondary outcome.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics were described using mean ± SD for continuous variables and 
percentages for categorical variables. Characteristics were compared between patients in 
each NIT arm by sex using chi-square testing for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test for continuous variables.
To determine whether the likelihood of a positive test differed by type of NIT (CTA vs. 
stress test) in women and in men, we performed multivariable logistic regression analyses. 
To further determine whether these relationships were independent of risk factors, the model 
was adjusted by patient age, race, baseline cardiac risk factors (history of hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes, tobacco use, family history of premature CAD, absence of regular 
exercise, CAD equivalent [defined as history of cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial 
disease, and/or diabetes], body mass index), global estimates of cardiovascular disease as 
derived from the Framingham Risk Score (12), the ASCVD Pooled Cohort Risk Score (13),

 and the updated Diamond and Forrester Risk Score (14), typicality of chest pain, and 
physician's estimation of the likelihood of significant CAD. A 2-way interaction between 
type of NIT and sex was included to determine whether the relationship between NIT type 
and test positivity was modified by patient sex.
To assess the prognostic value of each type of NIT for women and for men, multivariable 
Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship between test result, test type, 
patient sex, and both the primary composite outcome and the secondary outcome of time to 
cardiovascular death or MI. This model included a 3-way interaction between patient sex, 
test type, and test result to determine whether the relationships between test result and 
outcomes were modified jointly by sex and NIT type. Because the comparison of interest 
(patients with positive test results vs. patients with negative test results) was a 
nonrandomized comparison, we computed direct adjusted event curves to control for 
possible confounders of the relationship between test result and the primary composite 
outcome (14). The event curves and the above Cox regression models were adjusted for the 
same clinical factors as in the test positivity analysis. To further investigate how negative test 
results affect the prognostic value of each type of NIT, Cox regression models were 
developed to examine the relationship between NIT type and the primary composite 
outcome in women and in men with a negative test result.
All statistical calculations were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
North Carolina).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Among the 8966 PROMISE patients who received the NIT type to which they were 
randomized and had interpretable results, CTA was performed in 4500 (52% female) and 
stress testing in 4466 (53% female; Online Figure 1). Although randomization was not 
stratified by sex, the characteristics of women in the 2 testing arms were relatively similar, as 
were those of men (Table 1).
Effect of Sex and Test Type on Test Result
There were 456 women (9.7% of 4720 women total) who had a positive test result, with a 
significantly smaller proportion of positive CTAs compared to positive stress tests (8% vs. 
12%, p<0.001; Table 2). The significance of this difference persisted after adjustment for 
clinical factors, with women being less likely to have a positive CTA than a positive stress 
test (adjusted OR 0.67 [95% CI 0.55-0.82]; p<0.001; Table 3). Specifically, CTA was less 
likely to be positive compared to exercise ECG (OR 0.39 [95% CI 0.25-0.61]; p<0.001) and 
nuclear stress testing (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.53-0.82]; p<0.001), but not compared to stress 
echocardiography (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.63-1.30]; p=0.58; Figure 1).
In contrast, 640 men (15.1% of 4246 men total) had a positive test, with a marginally greater 
proportion of CTAs being positive compared to stress tests (16% vs. 14%, p=0.047; Table 2). 
After adjustment for clinical factors, men were more likely to have a positive CTA than a 
positive stress test (adjusted OR 1.23 [95% CI 1.04-1.47]; p=0.019) (Table 3). Specifically in

 men, CTA was more likely to be positive compared to exercise ECG (OR 1.79 [95% CI 
1.15-2.80]; p=0.01) and stress echocardiography (OR 2.10 [95% CI 1.45-3.04]; p<0.001), 
but not compared to nuclear stress testing (OR 1.03 [95% CI 0.85-1.25]; p=0.75; Figure 1). 
The likelihood of a positive test was strongly influenced by patient sex such that the effect of 
test type on test result was different for women compared with men (interaction p<0.001).
Effect of Sex and Test Type on the Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Testing
During the median 25 months of study follow-up, 112 women (2.4%; 57 in CTA arm, 55 in 
stress test arm) and 153 men (3.6%; 80 in CTA arm, 73 in stress test arm) had a primary 
endpoint event (Table 2). Overall, a positive NIT was strongly predictive of the composite 
endpoint of all-cause death/MI/hospitalization for unstable angina compared with a negative 
NIT (HR 3.37 [95% CI 2.59-4.38]). An analysis of the interaction between sex, NIT type, 
and test result revealed that sex and NIT type jointly modified the association of test result 
(positive vs. negative) with the risk of experiencing the primary composite endpoint 
(adjusted interaction p=0.010; Table 4). Thus, the influence of test type on the relationship 
between test result and outcome was different for women compared with men.
In women, the association of test results (positive vs. negative) with clinical events in CTA 
was stronger than the association of test results with clinical events in stress tests 
(unadjusted HR 6.39 [95% CI 3.65-11.17] vs. 2.70 [95% CI 1.45-5.03]; Table 4, Figure 2). 
This relationship persisted after adjustment for clinical factors, with a more than 2-fold 
greater hazard ratio for the association of test results to clinical events in CTA compared 
with the association of test results to clinical events in stress tests (adjusted HR 5.86 [95% 
CI 3.32-10.35] vs. 2.27 [95% CI 1.21-4.25]; adjusted p=0.028; Table 4, Figure 3). In 
contrast, in men the association of test results to clinical events in CTA was weaker than the 
association of test results to clinical events in stress tests (unadjusted HR 3.69 [95% CI 
2.35-5.79] vs. 5.39 [95% CI 3.39-8.56]) (Table 4, Figure 2). This relationship persisted after 
adjustment for clinical factors, although the difference in adjusted hazard ratios did not reach 
statistical significance (adjusted HR 2.80 [95% CI 1.76-4.45] vs. 4.42 [95% CI 2.77-7.07]); 
adjusted p=0.168 (Table 4, Figure 3). There was no difference in the ability of a negative 
CTA and a negative stress test to predict clinical events in either women or men (adjusted 
HR of negative CTA vs. negative stress test in women = 0.89 [95% CI 0.57-1.38]; adjusted 
HR of negative CTA vs. negative stress test in men = 1.13 [95% CI 0.75-1.72]; all adjusted 
p-values = NS; Figure 2). In both sexes, event rates were too low to meaningfully compare 
prognostic value across the different modalities of stress tests. There was no interaction 
between patient sex, NIT type, and the relationship between a positive test and the secondary 
outcome of cardiovascular death or MI (unadjusted p=0.77).
Discussion
Risk stratification is one of the primary reasons to perform noninvasive testing in patients 
with suspected CAD and provides important supplemental information beyond diagnosis. 
The current analysis suggests that women may derive greater prognostic information from a 
CTA, while men appear to derive similar prognostic value from a CTA and stress test. In 
both sexes, a negative CTA and a negative stress test appear to confer a similar likelihood of

 a clinical event. The durability of our findings after adjustment and the significance of the 
interaction terms suggest that our findings are unlikely to be due to either clinical 
characteristics or chance alone.
This analysis was performed in the context of the parent PROMISE trial, which found no 
difference in clinical events in patients randomized to the CTA versus stress testing arms 
overall or by sex (10). The significant interaction terms in our analyses suggest, however, 
that the rate of test positivity and the prognostic value of a test depend on the type of test 
performed and the patient's sex. Thus, although there was no difference in outcomes 
between the testing arms, which aggregated patients with both positive and negative test 
results, women with a positive CTA tended to fare worse than women with a positive stress 
test. Interestingly, although men randomized to the 2 testing arms had similar outcomes in 
the primary trial, men with a positive stress test had more clinical events than men with a 
positive CTA, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.
This apparent discrepancy between the nonsignificant role of sex and test type in the clinical 
outcomes of the overall trial and the highly significant role of sex and test type in the 
prognostic value of each type of test may be approached in 3 ways. First, there are many 
steps in the clinical pathway of a patient between the result of their diagnostic NIT and their 
ultimate outcome. This is especially relevant in a pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial 
such as PROMISE, which did not control whether patients were referred for angiography, 
revascularized, prescribed appropriate pharmacological therapy, adherent to medications, 
able to access follow-up care, and so on. A number of care patterns could have occurred 
differentially by testing arm and by sex, resulting in similar clinical events despite different 
capabilities of the test types to predict events in women and in men.
Second, during the trial, the providers were unaware of the possible sex-based differences in 
prognostic value of diagnostic testing that we have demonstrated in this secondary analysis. 
Thus, they were not able to act on this information to influence future outcomes.
Third, it is important to note that in a setting such as PROMISE, in which event rates were 
similar in both testing arms in women and in men, the prognostic value of a test is at least 
partially determined by the number of positive tests. Thus the observed sex-based 
differences in prognostic capability may be related to a higher positive rate of stress testing 
compared with CTA in women. In the absence of angiographic data confirming or excluding 
obstructive CAD in the vast majority of our patients, it is impossible to determine whether 
these ‘excess’ positive tests represented disease that was not associated with events during 
trial follow-up, or if they were false positive tests.
The known performance characteristics of the various NITs may help explain the differences 
in test positivity rates that we observed between women and men. Women were less likely to 
have a positive CTA than a positive exercise ECG or nuclear stress test, even after 
adjustment for clinical factors. These findings suggest that some stress test results may be 
falsely positive. This would be consistent with the well-documented significant false positive 
rates of exercise ECG and nuclear stress testing in women (2,3). The reported high false 
positive rate of approximately 28% in nuclear stress testing in women without known CAD

 (2) is particularly relevant to our study, since the majority of patients in the functional arm 
received this type of test. Another reason for the higher positivity rate of stress testing in 
women may be the presence of ischemia in the absence of obstructive CAD, possibly due to 
microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) (16-18). The ability of stress tests to detect both 
obstructive and microvascular disease may have made them more likely to be positive than 
CTAs in women, and less likely to be associated with clinical events, since MCD has a lower 
event rate than obstructive disease (19). These results parallel recent data from the Rule-Out 
Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction by Computer-assisted Tomography (ROMICAT-II) trial, 
which noted greater improvement in acute chest pain care in women compared with men 
randomized to a CTA strategy versus usual care (20).
In contrast to the results seen in women, men in our study were less likely to have a positive 
stress test than a positive CTA. Multiple factors may contribute to this difference between 
the sexes, including the lower false positive rate of stress testing and the lower prevalence of 
MCD in men (3,21). The lower rate of stress test positivity compared to CTA positivity in 
men may be related to the known discordance between obstructive CAD and ischemia, in 
which only a subset of obstructive lesions show hemodynamic significance. In the Fractional 
Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) study, which had 
mostly (75%) male participants, only 35% of the lesions categorized as having 50%-70% 
stenosis were functionally significant by fractional flow reserve (22). Although the 
association of CTA test results with clinical events was not significantly different from that 
of stress test results in men, the relationship clearly trended toward a stronger association 
between stress test result and clinical events. Perhaps the ability of stress tests to detect only 
hemodynamically significant lesions allows identification of the group of men who are most 
likely to have events, but with the low overall event rate, we did not have enough statistical 
power to detect this difference.
Our study has several strengths. PROMISE is the first, large head-to-head comparative 
effectiveness randomized trial of the anatomic versus stress testing strategies in stable 
symptomatic outpatients with adjudicated clinical events, and is therefore the first dataset 
that is able to rigorously address which testing strategy confers the greatest prognostic value. 
The trial is uniquely able to address this clinical question in women, since to our knowledge 
it includes the largest number of stable symptomatic women of any prospective trial of 
diagnostic testing to date. Our analyses harness these 2 strengths of PROMISE by focusing 
on within-sex differences between the 2 randomized testing groups, rather than on between-
sex differences alone. Further, our sex-specific analyses provide clinically relevant 
information that may help to optimize testing choice in all patients, while capitalizing on the 
randomization between testing strategies in PROMISE.
Our study also has several caveats that should be considered when interpreting the results. 
Randomization was not stratified by patient sex; however, within each sex, the 2 testing arms 
were similar. Because less than 10% of the trial population underwent coronary 
angiography, we are not able to draw conclusions about the diagnostic accuracy of each 
testing type between sexes. Although patients were followed for a median of >2 years, there 
were relatively few clinical endpoint events, limiting the ability to assess prognosis by NIT 
type in each sex. Finally, it is unclear whether our findings would be affected by a different

 mix of noninvasive testing. However, this distribution of test types reflects current 
community practice, as PROMISE was a pragmatic trial that left the choice of stress test 
type and the subsequent clinical management up to the provider.
Conclusions
The choice of noninvasive test is a complex one and depends on many factors in addition to 
diagnostic test performance, such as local expertise and availability, prior testing data, body 
habitus, ability to exercise, radiation exposure, and suspicion for cardiac abnormalities other 
than, or in addition to, ischemia. Our data provide novel insights into the differences 
between stress testing and anatomic testing in men and women with respect to positivity 
rates and the prognostic information provided by each type of test, despite the presence of 
similar overall event rates with both tests. The prognostic value of a positive compared with 
a negative noninvasive test result varies by test type and patient sex, while the event rate 
associated with a negative test is similar within each sex regardless of test type. Women 
appear to derive more prognostic information from CTA, while men appear to derive similar 
prognostic value from both types of tests. Further research is necessary to determine whether 
these findings should guide test selection and result interpretation for patients being 
evaluated for suspected CAD.

 Figure 1. Adjusted Association Between Noninvasive Test Type and Test Results in Women and 
Men Tested as Randomized
Adjusted for age, race, body mass index, coronary artery disease (CAD) equivalent, 
Framingham risk score (12), ASCVD score (13), 2011 Diamond and Forrester score (14), 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, family history of premature CAD, sedentary lifestyle, 
smoking, typicality of chest pain, and physician's estimation of likelihood of significant 
CAD. CTA = computed tomographic angiography; ECG = electrocardiography.

 Figure 2. Comparison of Test Results and Clinical Event Rates by Test Type in Women and Men
Clinical event rates are the primary composite outcome consisting of all-cause death, 
myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization. The top 2 panels compare positive 
test rates and event rates by sex in patients undergoing CTA vs. stress testing. In women 
event rates are similar in the 2 arms, but test positivity rates are higher in the stress test arm. 
In men event rates are also similar in the 2 arms, but test positivity rates are higher in the 
CTA arm. The bottom 2 panels compare event rates by positive and negative test results for 
each sex and by test type. Within women, the event rate with a negative CTA was similar to 
that with a negative stress test, but the event rate with a positive CTA was higher than that 
with a positive stress test. Within men, the event rate with a negative CTA was similar to that 
with a negative stress test, as was the event rate with a positive CTA and a positive stress 
test.

 Figure 3. Adjusted Event Curves of the Primary Composite Outcome Comparing Positive Versus 
Negative Test Results by Sex and Test Type
Event curves are shown comparing the association of positive and negative test results for 
each sex and by test type with the primary composite outcome of all-cause death, 
myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization. Curve are adjusted for age, race, 
body mass index, coronary artery disease (CAD) equivalent, Framingham risk score (12), 
ASCVD score (13), 2011 Diamond and Forrester score (14), hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
diabetes, family history of premature CAD, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, typicality of chest 
pain, and physician's estimation of likelihood of significant CAD . Interaction p = 0.010. 
CTA = computed tomographic angiography.
