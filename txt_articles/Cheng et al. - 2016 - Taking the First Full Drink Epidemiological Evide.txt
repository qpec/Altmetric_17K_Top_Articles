Abstract
Background—This research extends prior epidemiological estimates for the United States (US) 
and re-examines a previously described male excess in alcohol drinking. Its aim is to estimate fine-
grained age-specific incidence of becoming a drinker among 12- to 24-year-old US males and 
females, and to compare incidence estimates with prevalence proportions.
Methods—The study population is 12-to-24-year-old non-institutionalized US civilian residents. 
Estimates are from 12 successive US National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), with 
nationally representative samples drawn each year from 2002 to 2013 and assessed via computer-
assisted self-interviews (n~=390,000). Analysis-weighted incidence and prevalence estimates are 
generated using the NSDUH Restricted-Data Analysis System for six year-pairs. Meta-analysis 
derived summary estimates are provided, treating each year-pair as a replication.
Results—In this 21st century evidence, there no longer is male excess of incidence with respect 
to underage drinking. Indeed, in mid-adolescence, there is a clear female excess for the risk of 
becoming an underage drinker. Meta-analytic summaries disclosed no other male-female 
differences in incidence. Nevertheless, a male excess in prevalence of recently active drinking can 
be seen after age 19 years.
Conclusions—This new evidence from the US shows that the so-called ‘gender gap’ in risk of 
becoming a drinker has narrowed to the point of there being no gap at all. Indeed, in mid-
adolescence, risk of starting to drink is greater for females than for males.

 an often-observed male excess, with a few noteworthy exceptions (Erol and Karpyak, 2015). 
One exception can be seen in a ‘convergence’ or narrowing of the ‘gender gap’ with respect 
to estimated prevalence of recently active drinking in the United States (US) and in 
European countries, for which a broad range of cultural, social, and psychological 
explanations have been offered (Keyes et al., 2011; Wilsnack et al., 2009).
With respect to the narrowed gender gap, there is no definitive evidence to favor one 
explanation versus another at present. Many scholars appear to favor social and cultural 
influences associated with changing social roles and role expectations for women since 
World War II, which might be particularly salient in the US, western Europe, and possibly 
Japan and China. For example, in recent multi-national research on the chance to try alcohol 
during adolescence and young adulthood, there was a robust male excess only in three 
countries: Lebanon, Nigeria, and Mexico. For the rest of the 15 participating countries, 
females were just as likely as males to have had the chance to drink alcohol, including the 
US, western Europe, Japan, and China (Wells et al., 2011).
Against this background of unresolved choices between alternative explanations for the 
narrowed gender gap in drinking prevalence, it can be said that the convergence of drinking 
prevalence proportions is determined by the balance of two basic epidemiological 
parameters: (1) drinking incidence rates (i.e., population estimates for the risk of starting to 
drink), and (2) duration or persistence of drinking, once it starts (Cheng et al., in press; 
Freeman and Hutchison, 1980; Kramer, 1957; Lapouse, 1967). Until recently, there has been 
no clear empirical evidence pointing toward which of these two basic epidemiological 
parameters might account for the observed narrowing of the historically observed ‘gender 
gap’ in drinking prevalence. An initial contribution was made by Seedall & Anthony, who 
studied US epidemiological estimates for 12-to-17-year-old adolescents, as a group, and 
found a 2.1% female excess in adolescent drinking incidence rates, with girls being more 
likely to start drinking before age 18 years compared to boys, based on aggregate national 
survey data from 2002 to 2009 (Seedall and Anthony, 2013).
This research project picks up where the Seedall-Anthony investigation left off, drawing 
upon recently gathered US survey data through 2013 in order to address several gaps in 
existing evidence. First, this project seeks fine-grained age-specific estimates of drinking 
incidence rates in adolescents as well as young adults, with an expectation that the 
previously reported female excess might be concentrated in the early years of adolescence, 
and might not be seen during later adolescence or early adulthood before age 25 years. 
Second, this study engages a ‘mutoscope’ approach to construct estimates for successive 
birth cohorts, making it possible to compare cohort experiences over time with 
corresponding age-specific patterns of drinking incidence rates (Cheng et al., in press). The 
approach also clarifies reproducibility of age- and cohort-specific patterns, given that 
reproducibility has become an important but often ignored aspect of scientific progress 
(Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Third, corresponding population estimates are 
produced for prevalence of recently active drinking. The comparison of drinking incidence 
rates with drinking prevalence estimates makes it possible to check on male-female 
differences in duration or persistence of drinking, once drinking starts.

 The research project is focused on male-female differences in drinking incidence rates 
estimated for the US in recent years. We were unable to find recent data on fine-grained age-
specific and cohort-specific drinking incidence for other countries. Nonetheless, our 
discussion section includes some results from recent surveys of young people living in 
European countries. These results provide a check on whether the US experience might be 
unique.
We appreciate that some readers will be disappointed that our research project is not 
ambitious with respect to its probes for theoretical explanations as might account for male-
female differences in drinking behaviors. We focus strictly upon patterns observed in sex-
specific estimates for the risk of becoming a newly incident drinker, age by age, and cohort 
by cohort. With others, we share a view that cross-sectional survey research rarely yields 
definitive evidence about cause-effect relationships, primarily due to possible reciprocal 
influence processes and uncertainty about temporal sequencing, even when there are no 
omitted variables and no model mis-specification. This study's focus on age and sex means 
that constraints are imposed on these sources of uncertainty. For example, newly incident 
drinking is not plausible as an influence on one's age or male-female status per se.
We also appreciate that some readers might be concerned about our focus on a subset of the 
drinking population – namely, adolescents and young adults who are 12-to-24-years-old at 
the time of drinking onset and assessment. As it happens, in the US, newly incident drinking 
after age 24 years is too rare to provide statistically precise fine-grained age-by-age drinking 
incidence estimates even in large population samples (Cheng et al., in press). Due to our 
focus on drinking incidence, this empirical research report does not speak to drinking 
behaviors during the middle or later adult years, nor does it speak to processes that might 
influence a narrowing of the gender gap beyond the early adult years. Nevertheless, as noted 
in our discussion section, some important health and social implications are faced when 
newly incident drinking occurs below the legal minimum drinking age. These implications 
help to justify a research focus on underage drinking.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Study Population and Sample
This study's estimates are from the US National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 
conducted each year from 2002 through 2013, for which the study population was 
designated to include all non-institutionalized community residents of the US aged 12 years 
and above. The sampling approach involved multi-stage probability sampling, with 
oversampling of 12-17 year olds. In contrast to school or household surveys of adolescents, 
the NSDUH sample includes young people irrespective of school attendance, and its 
sampling frame includes non-household group quarters such as homeless shelters. All 
NSDUH participants were recruited via child assent (12-17 year olds) and parental or adult 
consent, based upon protocols approved by cognizant human subjects protection 
committees. More details about NSDUH are shown in online monographs and many 
published articles (Cheng et al., in press; Seedall and Anthony, 2015; United States, 2012, 
2015) (HTTP://WWW.ICPSR.UMICH.EDU/ICPSRWEB/ICPSR/SERIES/64).

 This research's estimates tap a public use data archive known as the Restricted-Data 
Analysis System (R-DAS), which enabled online analyses of data from recent National 
Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). With confidentiality and re-identification 
protections, R-DAS datasets have included large NSDUH sub-samples organized in year-
pairs, with six independently drawn replication samples (organized as 2002-3, 2004-5, ..., 
2012-13). For the same reason, the exact unweighted sample size is not provided in the 
output and, therefore, is unknown. Approximate sample sizes can be derived via a method 
developed by Vsevolozhskaya & Anthony (Vsevolozhskaya and Anthony, 2014), from 
which it can be seen that roughly 390,000 12-24 year olds are in the aggregate sample 
(2002-2013), with roughly 65,000 12-24 year olds in each of the six year-pairs. (In the US, 
after age 24, drinking initiation drops to a near zero value (Cheng et al., in press; United 
States, 2014)). Values from these approximations can be compared to NSDUH descriptions 
of separately sub-sampled public use data, which indicate that each year's dataset includes 
around 55,000 participants, with approximately 2/3rds at 12-to-25-years-of-age (United 
States, 2015). Participation levels, lowest to highest, were 74% (2007) to 79% (2002). Soon 
after completion of our analyses, the R-DAS system was assigned to a new contractor and its 
use has been suspended until the new contractor can complete its reprogramming, which is 
planned for late Spring 2016. An internet search for R-DAS will show that it no longer is 
available for online analyses.
2.2 Assessment and measures
In general, most often within the participant's home, NSDUH assessments have been 
completed as confidential audio computer-assisted self-interviews designed to promote 
reliability, accuracy, and truthfulness of participant reports about potentially sensitive 
behaviors and characteristics. During the assessment module on alcohol, each participant has 
been asked about the lifetime history of drinking experiences, including questions about the 
month and year of drinking onset and the most recent drinking occasion, whenever these 
events occurred within 24 months prior to the date of assessment. Each newly incident 
drinker can be identified as one who had their first full drink no more than 12 months prior 
to the survey assessment date. Examples of a full drink given by the NSDUH includes “a can 
or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with 
liquor in it”. NSDUH questions explicitly explained that “We are not asking about times 
when you only had a sip or two from a drink.”
These alcohol module standardized questions were asked consistently from 2002 to 2013. 
Recently active drinkers have been identified as those for whom the most recent drinking 
occasion occurred during that same 12-month interval.
Age has been derived via self-reported date of birth relative to assessment date. Sex is based 
on participant responses that indicate male or female (with no allowance for gender 
identities such as trans-gender). NSDUH drew upon dwelling unit roster information to 
create variables for age and sex on rare occasions when a participant skipped survey items 
on these characteristics.

 2.3 Analysis
An incidence estimate for becoming a drinker for the first time in any given survey year can 
be approximated by placing each year's analysis-weighted number of newly incident 
drinkers in the numerator, and dividing by a person-year count that has been calculated by 
adding the analysis-weighted number of newly incident drinkers to the analysis-weighted 
number of never drinkers as of the survey assessment date. R-DAS provided the required 
variables as RECALC_B and ELGALC_B.
The corresponding prevalence proportion is the analysis-weighted number of recently active 
drinkers (those who consumed alcohol in the 12 months prior to assessment), divided by the 
analysis-weighted number of all persons. By standard definitions in NSDUH alcohol 
epidemiology reports, the numerator in the prevalence proportion includes all newly incident 
drinkers plus all persons who had started drinking in prior years and whose duration of 
drinking had extended into the interval of 12 months just prior to the survey assessment date. 
Cross-tabulations via the R-DAS were used to produce incidence and prevalence estimates 
for this report. Male-female differences in incidence estimates were estimated using the 
‘Run Comparison of Percents’ function on R-DAS which enabled two-group comparisons 
with due attention to the complex survey design and sample weight. Variance estimates and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) for this study are based on the Taylor series approximation 
that is appropriate for complex survey data (Vsevolozhskaya and Anthony, 2014).
Consistent with a research approach described elsewhere (Cheng et al., in press; Deandrea et 
al., 2013; Seedall and Anthony, 2015), this study's method is one that constrains recall and 
reporting errors such as methodological ‘telescoping’ via the use of information about 
month and year of drinking onset as it has occurred during a relatively short span of 12 
months prior to the assessment in each cross-sectional survey of the community respondents, 
with sampling and analyses designed to yield nationally representative estimates. (Here, 
‘telescoping’ refers to the generic survey research methods artifact and not to the alcohol 
field's more recently introduced concept of ‘telescoping’ as applied to accelerated time from 
first drink to first drinking problem.)
The derived incidence estimates are displayed in a set of time-by-age cross-tabulations, such 
that the time-specific rows depict sets of cross-sectional age-specific estimates, with time 
(years) held constant. The columns depict sets of cross-sectional time-specific estimates, 
with age held constant. The diagonals depict sets of cross-sectional estimates, studied across 
time, with cohort held constant, and provide a ‘mutoscope view’ of each cohort's forward 
progress across time. This type of table layout originated with Johns Hopkins University 
Professor Wade Hampton Frost's posthumously published study of tuberculosis mortality 
rates (Frost, 1939), which Seedall and Anthony (2015) described in the first published article 
on the mutoscope approach. As applied to annual field survey estimates of incidence, the 
approach avoids two theoretically plausible threats to validity found in longitudinal research 
with repeated measurements of the same individuals: (a) sample attrition and loss of 
longitudinal participants over time, and (b) measurement reactivity such that answers to 
assessments at each follow-up might be influenced by assessment processes at baseline or 
prior follow-up. Seedall and Anthony (2015) provide the first and most complete description 
of the mutoscope approach, which has been applied in a series of recent publications (e.g.,

 (Cheng et al., in press; Seedall and Anthony, 2015). Cheng and colleagues explain and 
illustrate differences between the mutoscope approach and a different approach known as 
age-period-cohort analysis (Cheng et al., in press). In brief, the APC approach typically 
requires use of a constrained regression model for analysis of data gathered over a span of 
20-30 or more years, often organized in units of 5-years, and via regression, the APC 
analyses hold period and age constant to estimate effects of being a member of a cohort, 
hold cohort and age constant to estimate period effects, and hold period and cohort constant 
to estimate age effects. The mutoscope approach is focused upon a short interval of time 
(here, 2002-2013) such that a period effect is generally ignorable, and answers the question 
of whether the pattern of over-time experience of each birth cohort, re-sampled in successive 
years, is or is not congruent with the pattern of cross-sectionally viewed age-specific 
estimates.
Because many readers are confused about what can be learned via the mutoscope approach 
versus what can be learned via APC constrained regression analyses, it has become 
customary to present the mutoscope estimates as well as the APC constrained regression 
estimates. Whereas the short period from 2002-2013 impedes formal age-period-cohort 
analyses as one might use for spans of data from 20 or 30 years, for this project we turned to 
the constrained regression approach, and specified an equality constraint for the 2010-11 and 
2012-13 (period) values. The result is a post-estimation confirmation of our assumption 
about null period effects with respect to drinking incidence during the relatively short span 
of time from 2002 through 2013 (Harper, 2015).
Final analysis steps involved the generation of meta-analysis summaries of sex- and age-
specific estimates using Stata software (Stata Corp, 2013), with each NSDUH year-pair 
treated as an independent replication (Deandrea et al., 2013; DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). 
The Cochran's Q and I2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity across replications 
(Higgins et al., 2003). When heterogeneity across replications was observed (i.e., Cochran's 
Q chi-squared test p<0.05 and I2>50%), a random effects estimator was substituted for the 
default fixed effect estimator. We appreciate that readers generally are familiar with meta-
analyses that combine estimates from various published studies on the same topic. In this 
instance, the purpose of meta-analysis is to produce an accurate and robust summary 
estimate for each sex- and age-stratum, year by year, across the successive NSDUH 
replication samples.
An alternative to meta-analysis is a data pooling approach that treats every year or year-pair 
of NSDUH data as exchangeable units of a single study. Our concern is that the data-pooling 
approach generally ignores potential sources of variation (e.g., minor variations in survey 
approach in 2002 relative to 2013), as well as the fact that analysis weights for the early 
years of NSDUH have been derived from US census values from 2000, whereas analysis 
weights for the most recent years have been based on the US census completed in 2010. In 
contrast, our project's meta-analysis approach accommodates these sources of variation, and 
acknowledges heterogeneity across year-pairs.

 One previous report has compared these two approaches. The conclusion was that the meta-
analysis approach can be superior to the data pooling approach in terms of statistical 
robustness (Deandrea et al., 2013).
Readers interested in a more detailed description of the constrained regression for APC 
analyses as compared with the mutoscope approach might wish to read a prior alcohol 
epidemiology contribution cited above (Cheng et al., in press). The same article explains the 
meta-analysis approach (Cheng et al., in press).
3. RESULTS
The estimated sex- and age-specific risk of becoming a newly incident drinker is conveyed 
via the drinking incidence estimates shown in Table 1, year-pair by year-pair. Panel A 
presents results for females and Panel B for males. Age-specific meta-analysis summary 
estimates are shown at the bottom of each Panel. Corresponding 95% CIs are shown in Table 
2.
Because the focus of this paper is on male-female difference, it may be beneficial to look at 
male-female differences and 95% CI before a detailed description of sex- and age-specific 
patterns. Table 3 discloses a set of statistically robust female excess values at age 15 for all 
survey entries. The age-specific meta-analysis summary estimates for 13-through-16-year-
olds show larger drinking incidence estimates for females relative to males, with 14-to-15-
year-old girls about 25% more likely to initiate drinking compared to same-age boys. Parity 
follows until a robust male excess can be seen at age 20. The mutoscope view gained by 
looking down the diagonals show general congruence of cohort experiences and age-specific 
estimates. That is, as we trace the experience of each cohort across successive years (in each 
table's diagonal entries), we can see the same patterns that one sees in each set of cross-
sectionally derived age-specific estimates, year by year. In this instance, the cross-sectional 
age-specific estimates are reflective of the dynamically changing experiences of the cohorts 
moving forward through adolescence toward young adulthood.
According to the cross-sectionally derived age-specific meta-analysis summary estimates for 
females in the US, an estimated 2.9% start drinking at age 12 years (Table 1 and Figure 1). 
The corresponding estimate for age 13 is larger, at 8%, followed by an increment of more 
than 7% such that the drinking incidence estimate is 15.5% at age 14. Then, steady 
increments build toward initial peak values at age 17 years (26.3%) and 18 years (31.3%), 
followed by a statistically robust dip in annual incidence at age 19 years (26.9%) and age 20 
(20.8%). At the minimum legal drinking age (21 years), the annual incidence estimate is 
49.2%. That is, the apparent implication is that almost 50% of those who abstained to the 
legal age then start drinking at age 21 years. Thereafter, there are marked declines in the 
incidence estimates: 20.4% at age 22, 7.9% at 23 years, and 4.6% at 24 years.
Viewed column-wise, estimates in Table 1 show minimal variations in this general age-
specific pattern. Viewed down each diagonal, the mutoscope view shows each female cohort 
following the same general pattern.

 Corresponding incidence estimates for males disclose a pattern not appreciably different 
from the female pattern when 95% CI are taken into account (Table 1 Panel B). For example, 
the meta-analysis point estimate for 21-year-old males is just above 45%, relative to the 
corresponding 49% estimate observed for 21-year-old females, but the 95% CI overlap 
considerably.
Table 4 (for point estimates) and Table 5 (for 95% CI) shift perspective from incidence 
estimates to prevalence proportions. In contrast with the more dynamically varying 
incidence estimates, estimated prevalence of recently active drinking shows a monotonic 
increase from age 12 to 21 years for both males and females, followed by a plateau. The 
prevalence estimates disclose no robust female excess. Indeed, a consistent male excess in 
prevalence of recently active drinking is observed at and after age 20 years.
Figure 1 displays the age-specific meta-analysis summary estimates for both incidence and 
prevalence, as well as the male-female contrast. In line with the tabled values, the age-
specific incidence and prevalence patterns stand in stark contrast with one another. With no 
male-female differences in incidence estimates after age 19 years, an implication of the 
robust male excess in prevalence of recently active drinking seen at and after age 20 years is 
that males are more likely to persist in their drinking, once drinking starts, as compared to 
females.
More details about the experience of specific cohorts and cross-cohort consistency are 
shown in supplementary tables and figures. For example, Supplementary Figure 1 displays 
age-specific drinking incidence estimates for each female cohort, with a suggestion that 12-
to-15-year-olds from more recent cohorts might be experiencing lower incidence rates, 
whereas Supplementary Figure 2, for males, shows the 1990-1 cohort as one with relatively 
higher drinking incidence, especially at age 21. Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 display 
forest plots for the meta-analysis summaries of drinking incidence. Supplementary Tables S4 
and S5 provide estimates for cumulative incidence proportions, showing that by age 17 
years, an estimated 60% of boys and girls have had a first full drink on at least one occasion. 
By age 21 years, an estimated 90% have had at least one full drink.
Findings from the constrained regression models are consistent with our assumption of little 
or no period variations in these incidence estimates, and with what the mutoscope view 
suggests. Namely, estimated ‘effects’ of period and of cohort are null. Estimated age-
associated variations are in line with patterns described in Tables 1 and 2.
4. DISCUSSION
In this study's estimates for incidence of becoming an underage drinker in the US, there is 
little evidence of the ‘gender gap’ that was seen a few decades ago in prevalence estimates 
and adult retrospective age-of-onset incidence re-constructions (Keyes et al., 2008; Keyes et 
al., 2011; Keyes et al., 2010). Instead, there now is a general male-female parity, and in 
early-mid adolescence, an apparent female excess is seen in the estimated incidence of 
starting to drink.

 For both males and females, the largest incidence estimate is seen at the legal minimum 
drinking age at 21 years, when roughly 50% start drinking legally, conditional on no prior 
underage drinking. In addition, for both males and females, there is a previously 
undocumented dip in incidence estimates for the 19-to-20-year olds, as would be the case if 
some adolescents deliberately delay drinking onset until the legal age. Then, after age 21 
years, the estimated incidence for starting to drink drops markedly. Pending confirmation via 
independently gathered epidemiological evidence, we might have discovered a ‘legal 
minimum drinking age effect’ in the form of peak incidence at the legal age (given no prior 
underage drinking), preceded and followed by below-expected incidence estimates, with the 
expected value based on what can be forecast based on prior incidence estimates for early-
mid adolescence (Cheng et al., in press).
The diagonals of Tables 1 and 2 disclose a cohort-wise mutoscope view that is generally 
congruent with the age-specific view obtained by looking across age values, column by 
column. In Figure 1, the display of incidence estimates along with the more commonly seen 
prevalence estimates shows what are distinctly different patterns and conclusions based on 
these two different epidemiological parameters for drinking experiences (Cheng et al., in 
press).
These findings should be interpreted with limitations in mind. First, the self-report 
assessment is from an audio computer-assisted self-interview, and cannot be regarded as a 
perfect measurement tool (Penne et al., 1998). With respect to the dip in incidence at age 19-
to-20-years, we acknowledge possible existence of a pool of underage drinkers who will not 
acknowledge drinking until they have reached the legal minimum drinking age. 
Nevertheless, we have no reason to surmise that this pool shows marked growth during the 
two years between age 18 and age 21. Second, prior research suggests minimum differential 
survival or mortality rates related to drinking initiation among young people, but left-
censoring of underage drinkers might be present, given possibilities of alcohol-related death 
and survey non-participation biases (Dawson, 2000). Third, cross-sectional survey snapshot 
estimates provide a mutoscope view of independently sampled cohort experiences over time, 
but are not the same as estimates of intra-individual changes as can be observed in 
longitudinal follow-ups of a single sample (Seedall & Anthony, 2015). Fourth, inherent to 
the study design, data points ranged from one to six for each cohort; the oldest and youngest 
cohorts could not be fully evaluated.
Notwithstanding limitations such as these, these epidemiological estimates should possess 
reasonably high internal and external validity, with results readily generalizable to the US 
source population of non-institutionalized individuals aged 12-24 years (Penne et al., 1998). 
Via study design, it has been possible to constrain various potential sources of error faced in 
other studies, such as age-of-onset recall errors in studies based on retrospection over long 
spans of time, as well as measurement reactivity errors in longitudinal studies with repeated 
measures (i.e., influence of repeating the same measure at time t, t+1, t+2, etc.).
Recent estimates from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs 
(ESPAD) indicate that the United States is not the only country with a reversal of the 
traditional male excess in the occurrence of teenage drinking. Based on the 2011 ESPAD

 report of a cohort of students born in 1995, girls were more likely to have had drunk 
alcoholic beverages by the age of 15 or 16 in seven out of 34 participating countries– 
namely, Latvia, Hungary, Russian Federation (Moscow sample), Lithuania, Estonia, 
Ukraine, and Monaco under an assumption of no survey design effect on variances (Cheng 
and Anthony, In preparation; Hibell et al., 2012). Under a more plausible assumption that 
ESPAD survey design effects had created a 77% effective sample size of the actual number 
of males and females surveyed, five countries show a statistically robust female excess 
(Latvia, Hungary, Russian Federation, Lithuania, Estonia).
Considered substantively, the findings invite some speculations. For example, when there is 
an observed absence of a male excess in drinking incidence, the explanation might involve 
US social norms that previously promoted male drinking relative to female drinking, such as 
drinking to demonstrate masculinity (Wilsnack et al., 2000; Wilsnack et al., 2009). In this 
study's evidence, the appearance of a female excess of becoming an underage drinker is 
most prominent at 14 and 15 years of age, when there are concurrently evolving socio-
cultural conditions or processes such as differential exposure of females in the early teens to 
alcohol advertising, increasing access to alcohol via romantic partners, or changes in gender 
expectations that include ‘masculinizing’ of female roles (Keyes et al., 2008; Kuhn, 2015; 
Schwartz, 2013).
Secular shifts in motives or reasons for drinking may be at play, as well as variations in peer 
and parental influences (Seedall and Anthony, 2015; Wilsnack et al., 2000). As more mid-
adolescent girls start to drink, there can be an acceleration of incidence via same-age peer 
influence or social sharing (e.g., collectively experienced drinking exposure opportunities or 
peer-to-peer sharing of alcoholic beverages). In research on adolescents in 13 European 
countries, male-female differences in drinking motives were observed across stages of 
adolescence. For example, at age 14-to-16-years, girls were more likely than boys to drink 
alcohol to cope with emotions. This difference was not present in earlier or later 
adolescence. In contrast, boys were more likely than girls to drink for social and 
enhancement reasons during mid- and late-adolescence (Kuntsche et al., 2015).
Irrespective of the explanations, there is a clear sign of potential public health importance in 
this study's evidence of relatively high incidence of underage drinking in both girls and boys, 
as well as the newly observed female excess at mid-adolescence. Effective prevention and 
intervention for underage drinking, especially among early-adolescent girls, is needed in 
order to reduce potential adverse consequences that include risk-taking behaviors, injuries, 
initiation of other drug use, teen pregnancies, and various pathogenetic processes and 
conditions that can emerge when ethanol exposure starts during puberty (Brown et al., 2009; 
Hermos et al., 2008; Hingson et al., 2009; Jackson, 2010; Salas-Wright et al., 2015).
The finding that age-specific prevalence and incidence estimates can lead to quite different 
conclusions about male-female differences in drinking behaviors also deserves some 
discussion. First, the female early teen excess is not apparent in the prevalence estimates. 
Second, incidence estimates show male-female parity from age 20 and onward, whereas 
prevalence estimates show a male excess. The implication is that early adolescent females 
are more likely to initiate drinking, while male drinkers are more likely than female drinkers

 to persist in their drinking during these years (to the extent that prevalence varies as a 
function of incidence and duration), for which explanations can be drawn from a broad 
range of biological, pharmacological, and socio-cultural domains (Keyes et al., 2008; Kuhn, 
2015). From a population perspective, incidence estimates provide information that is 
directly pertinent to the risk of becoming a drinker, as well as the causal influences on the 
risk processes. In contrast, prevalence estimates are useful to gauge the extent of drinking, 
but leave considerable ambiguity with respect to causal influences. A correlate of drinking 
prevalence might be a determinant of drinking persistence (operating after drinking has been 
initiated) when it has nothing whatsoever to do with the risk of starting to drink in the first 
place. In this respect, prevalence analyses yield ambiguous evidence about what might be 
accounting for underage drinking onsets or male-female differences, while incidence 
analyses speak directly and more definitively about these determinants.
As has been true in many areas of epidemiological research, this study disclosed similarities 
across successive cohorts studied during a relatively short span of time, but its incidence 
estimates disclosed differences in relationships that have not been seen in prior prevalence 
investigations. In this instance, this new epidemiological evidence opens up previously 
unaddressed questions for future research, and sets the stage for new studies to shed light on 
the mechanisms that might account for the complete closure of the previously documented 
alcohol ‘gender gap’ and the emergence of what appears to be a robustly reproducible 
female excess in the early-mid adolescent years.
