Abstract
Rationale: The World Trade Center (WTC) collapse generated
caustic airborne particulates that caused chronic rhinosinusitis in
exposed Fire Department of New York firefighters. Surgery was
performed when symptoms remained uncontrolled despite medical
management.
Objectives: To identify predictors of surgical intervention for
chronic rhinosinusitis in firefighters exposed to airborne irritants at
the WTC collapse site.
Methods: We assessed in 8,227 firefighters with WTC exposure
betweenSeptember11,2001(9/11),andSeptember25,2001,including
WTC-site arrival time, months of rescue and recovery work, and
eosinophil concentration measured between 9/11 and March 10, 2003.
We assessed the association of serum cytokines and immunoglobulins
with eosinophil concentration and surgery for rhinosinusitis in 112
surgical cases and 376 control subjects with serum available from the
first 6 months after exposure to the WTC collapse site.
Measurements and Main Results: Between 9/11 and March 10,
2015, the surgery rate was 0.47 cases per 100 person-years. In the first
18 months post-9/11, surgical patients had higher mean blood
eosinophillevelsthanstudycohortpatients(219 6 155vs.191 6 134;
P , 0.0001). Increased surgery risk was associated with increasing
blood eosinophil counts (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 per 100 cells/ml;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.17; P , 0.001); arriving at the
WTC site on 9/11 or September 12, 2001 (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04–1.99;
P = 0.03); and working 6 months or longer at the WTC site (HR,
1.48; 95% CI, 1.14–1.93; P , 0.01). Median blood eosinophil levels
for surgical patients were above levels for the cohort in all 18-month
intervals March 11, 2000, through March 10, 2015, using 51,163
measurements representing 97,733 person-years of observation.
Increasing age, increasing IL-17A, and low IgA in serum from
2001 to 2002 predicted blood eosinophil concentration in
surgical patients but not in control subjects (R2 = 0.26, P , 0.0001;
vs. R2 = 0.008, P = 0.56).
Conclusions: Increasing blood eosinophil concentration predicts
surgical intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly in those
withintenseacuteandprolonged exposuretoairborneirritants.WTC-
exposed Fire Department of New York firefighters who underwent
irritant-associated sinus surgery are immunologically different from
the cohort. Surgical patients have a higher blood eosinophil levels that
is associated with mediators of mucosal immunity.

1253
 Rhinosinusitis is a syndrome producing
obstruction to nasal airflow, drip, anosmia,
and facial pain. Chronic rhinosinusitis
(CRS) is defined as this constellation of
symptoms lasting 3 or more months. The
prevalence of CRS is between 13% and 17%,
with 600,000 sinus surgeries performed in
the United States during 2006 (1–3). In an
analysis of International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision–coded electronic
medical records (EMRs) from a large
private health system, researchers estimated
a CRS incidence of 1.1 cases per 100
person-years (4).
The current European position paper
on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps,
published in 2012, recommended that sinus
inflammation should be objectively
confirmed by computed tomography (CT)
and/or endoscopy and argued for separation
of it into two distinct entities: CRS
without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal
polyps (5). In spite of high disease burden
and associated morbidity, few longitudinal
studies have provided data on risk factors
for CRS, limiting approaches to model
disease outcomes and institute effective
prevention (4, 6–8).
Environmental particulate matter
exposure is a risk factor for upper and lower
airway disease (9, 10). The collapse of
the World Trade Center (WTC) on
September 11, 2001 (9/11), produced a dust
cloud containing alkaline pulverized
concrete and other building materials
that irritated mucosal surfaces of the
aerodigestive system. All individuals
present at the WTC site before September
13, 2001, sustained intense particulate
exposure, which produced upper airway
symptoms, including nasal congestion and
drip, in most survivors (11).
Rainfall 3 days after 9/11 reduced
dust levels and may have played a role in
lower levels of persistent aerodigestive
symptoms in later-arriving Fire Department
of New York (FDNY) firefighters (12).
Digging activities to recover human
remains continued through July 2002,
producing chronic particulate reexposures.
Upper airway filtration of larger particles
protects the lower airway but can produce
inflammation of the nose and paranasal
sinuses, leading to CRS, which has, over
time, become a major health concern
in WTC-exposed populations (13–16).
We have previously shown that chronic
particulate exposure, defined by months
of firefighter work at the WTC site,
predicted health care use, including sinus
surgery (12).
CRS has multiple inflammatory
endotypes (17). Innate as well as Th2- and
Th17-driven eosinophilic responses are
observed in specimens from surgically
treated patients with CRS (18–21),
suggesting that separate eosinophilic
inflammatory pathways produce CRS.
IL-17A is an inflammatory mediator of
sinus disease. Eosinophilia is present in
WTC-exposed area residents and children
with upper and lower respiratory
complaints (14, 22).
In a small cross-sectional study, high
blood eosinophil concentration soon after
WTC exposure increased the odds of
visualizing sinus polyps on CT scans, a
risk factor for sinus surgery (23). This
preliminary study led to the hypothesis that
blood eosinophil concentration early after
9/11 may predict subsequent sinus surgery,
a clearly defined disease with high
morbidity and health care use (12). We
therefore tested if increased blood
eosinophil levels and associated
inflammatory mediators, combined with
WTC exposure, are risk factors for surgical-
CRS in FDNY firefighters.
Methods
Study Population
This study included male firefighters who
were employed by the FDNY on 9/11; first
arrived at the WTC site between 9/11 and
September 24, 2001; had an available
eosinophil concentration from an FDNY
medical monitoring examination between
9/11 and March 10, 2003; and consented
to be research subjects. The Montefiore
Medical Center and New York University
institutional review boards approved this
study.
Identification and Characterization of
Patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis
We obtained surgical-CRS occurrence data
and dates from multiple sources, including
the FDNY-WTC Health Program (FDNY-
WTCHP) EMR, FDNY-WTCHP claims
data, and the records of a WTC center of
excellence otolaryngologist (M.R.S.). When
the FDNY-EMR was the only identifier of
surgical-CRS, a WTC treatment physician
(M.D.W.) reviewed the FDNY-EMR notes
to confirm the date and indication for
surgical-CRS.
Otolaryngologists caring for patients
with CRS were not provided patients’
WTC exposure specifics, job tasks, or
FDNY-WTCHP eosinophil concentrations.
CT reports were reviewed by a WTC
treatment physician (D.J.P.), noting
the symptoms as well as the presence
of upper airway polyps or inflammation.
CRS was defined by having sinus
symptoms and sinus surgery or sinus
CT and findings of inflammation or
polyps.
Eosinophil, Exposure, and
Demographic Data
Eosinophil concentrations were obtained
from cell blood counts (CBCs) drawn at
each WTCHP monitoring examination,
scheduled at 12- to 18-month intervals, and
sent to a single commercial laboratory. The
first eosinophil concentration during each
18-month interval was used in the analysis.
We did not use eosinophil measurements
from physician encounters for symptom
evaluation or treatment. Information
documented during FDNY-WTCHP
examinations included responses from self-
administered questionnaires with questions
about smoking, self-reported race and/or
ethnicity, WTC arrival time, and months of
work.
A never smoker was defined as
consistently denying smoking on
longitudinal questionnaires. High-intensity
acute exposure was defined as arrival
between the morning of 9/11 and the end of
September 12, 2001; lower-intensity acute
exposure was defined as arrival on or after
September 13, 2001. High-intensity chronic
exposure was defined as 6 or more
months of rescue and/or recovery work,
intermediate intensity was defined as
2–5 months, and lower intensity was
defined as 1 month.
Serum Biomarker Cases and
Control Subjects
Serum was obtained from the same
venipuncture as blood drawn at the first
post-9/11 medical monitoring examination
and was stored at 2808C. Exclusions for the
control population were any physician
diagnosis of sinus disease or firefighters
who had presented for evaluation of
respiratory symptoms before March 2008
(24). To exclude chronic sinus disease, CRS
diagnoses and dates were identified by
searching the EMRs for International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,

 codes for chronic sinusitis (code 473.x),
chronic rhinitis or nasopharyngitis (code
472.0/472.2), or polyps of the nose or sinus
(code 471.x). Chronic disease was defined
as at least two FDNY physician visits with
one of these diagnoses at least 4 weeks
apart. Serum IL-17A, IL-6, and IgA were
evaluated by using multiplex assays
(HSTCMAG28SPMX21 for IL-17A and
IL-6, HGAMMAG-301K for IgA; EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA), and IgE was
assessed with a single-plex assay
(HGAMMAG-303E; EMD Millipore).
To avoid batch bias, equal proportions of
cases and controls were included in each
batch.
Statistical Analysis
All reported P values are two sided.
Characteristics between the cohort and the
surgical-CRS group were assessed using
score tests for continuous variables and
log-rank tests for categorical variables.
Follow-up time for CBC was calculated
from the first to the last medical
monitoring CBC for each study
participant. Follow-up time for surgical-
CRS began on 9/11 and ended on the date
of surgical-CRS. For active FDNY
members without surgical-CRS, follow-up
time ended on March 10, 2015. For retirees
without surgical-CRS, follow-up ended at
the last FDNY-WTCHP monitoring
examination or treatment date. Rates for
surgical-CRS included cases occurring
after 9/11.
Cox proportional hazards models for
multivariable analysis of rates, adjusted for
race, were used to assess the effect of WTC
exposure (initial arrival time, and work
duration at the site), smoking, and
eosinophil levels, and stratification by
smoking status was used to assess the effect
modification by smoking. Kaplan–Meier
curves for single-variable assessment of
eosinophils in the top quartile, initial arrival
time, and work duration at the site on
surgical-CRS were produced by setting all
other covariates on the Cox model at their
mean.
In the biomarkers substudy, stratified
multivariable linear models analyzed
predictors of eosinophil concentration
in surgical-CRS patients and control
subjects. All data analyses were performed
with SPSS version 22 software (IBM,
Armonk, NY) and replicated using SAS
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
Results
Characteristics of the Study Cohort,
Surgical-CRS and Medical-CRS
Patients
Figure 1 shows the parent population of
10,612 FDNY male firefighters who were
first present at the WTC site between 9/11
and September 24, 2001. The final
consented study cohort consisted of 8,227
firefighters, the 1,907 with objectively
confirmed CRS, the 479 who were treated
with surgery within 13.5 years of 9/11
(surgical-CRS), and the 1,428 who were
medically managed (medical CRS) up to
March 10, 2015.
Table 1 shows the demographic
characteristics of all exposed firefighters
who consented to research, the study
cohort, those with confirmed CRS,
enumerating medical CRS and surgical-
CRS subgroups, and the biomarker
substudy subjects without a sinus diagnosis
(control subjects) and surgical-CRS
patients. The study cohort was similar to all
exposed male firefighters: mostly white,
never smokers, and usually arrived at the
WTC site on 9/11 or September 12, 2001.
Compared with the study cohort, surgical-
CRS patients had higher blood eosinophil
concentrations, were younger, had a lower
percentage of ever smokers, arrived at the

 WTC site earlier, and had a longer duration
of work at the WTC site and earlier
diagnosis of sinus disease.
Compared with the study cohort,
medical-CRS patients were similar in age,
eosinophil concentration, and time to
diagnosis of sinus disease, but they had
arrived at the WTC site earlier and had a
longer duration of work at the WTC site.
The biomarker substudy contained only
never smokers; substudy surgical-CRS
patients were similar to all surgical-CRS
patients.
Risk Factors for Surgical-CRS
We used the longitudinal database of the
FDNY-WTCHP to identify external
exposures and patient intrinsic
characteristics that altered sinus surgery
rates when compared with the cohort.
Table 2 shows multiple-predictor Cox
regression models predicting surgery
adjusted for age, race, and smoking history.
Increasing eosinophil concentration
(100 cells/ml) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.12; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.17;
P , 0.001), earlier WTC arrival time (HR,
1.43; 95% CI, 1.04–1.99; P = 0.03), and
longer work duration at the WTC site (HR,
1.48; 95% CI, 1.14–1.93; P , 0.01) were all
associated with higher incidence of surgery.
To better understand the impact of smoking,
we tested for interaction between smoking
and other risk factors and found none.
We then stratified subjects by smoking
status and found that increasing eosinophil
concentration remained a significant risk
factor for surgical-CRS in both never
smokers (HR, 1.12; P , 0.001) and ever
smokers (HR, 1.13; P = 0.001). Early arrival
remained significant only in ever smokers
(HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.11–4.29; P = 0.023; vs.
HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.84–1.77; P = 0.29).
Further, ever smokers had higher
eosinophils in than never smokers (213 6
139 vs. 194 6 133; P = 0.003 for CRS;
240 6 166 vs. 209 6 148; P = 0.046 for
surgical-CRS). Since smoking confounds
the association between surgical-CRS
hazard and eosinophils, ever smokers were
excluded from subsequent models to
eliminate this confounding.
We performed a biomarker substudy of
488 individuals with serum drawn within
6 months after WTC exposure, comparing
risk factors for sinus surgery in 112 surgical
patients and 376 control subjects using IgE
concentration as a biomarker for atopic
disease. The control group excluded those
with upper and lower respiratory diagnoses
that could be associated with atopy.
While eosinophil concentration and age
remained significant risk factors for
surgical-CRS, IgE was not associated with
surgical-CRS (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99–1.03;
P = 0.23). Consistent with our prior study
with different cases and controls (23), IL-6
reduced hazard of surgical-CRS (HR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.72–0.97; P = 0.021).
With the cohort as the reference, we
used Kaplan–Meier analysis to illustrate the
effect of risk factors on surgical-CRS. As
opposed to the Cox models that used
eosinophils as a continuous variable, the
Kaplan–Meier analysis used the top quartile
of eosinophils (240 cells/ml) in the cohort to
demonstrate the effect of higher
eosinophils.
Figure 2 shows cumulative incidence
plots for surgical-CRS as a function of
blood eosinophil concentration, WTC
arrival time, and WTC-site work duration.
Higher levels of eosinophils were associated
with higher rates of surgical-CRS

Predictors of Eosinophil Concentration
Biological differences between the
surgical-CRS patients and the study
cohort could explain the impact of
eosinophil concentration on surgery rates.
To gain insight into immunological
pathways associated with elevated
eosinophil concentration in surgical-CRS
patients, we performed multivariable
linear regression with eosinophil
concentration 1.6–6.3 months
post-9/11 as the outcome and
inflammatory biomarkers measured in
serum from the same venipuncture as
the eosinophil concentration as the
predictor.
Table 3 shows two multivariable linear
regressions with post-9/11 eosinophil
concentration as the outcome. IL-17A is
strongly correlated with eosinophil
concentration in surgical-CRS patients
but not in controls (standardized b, 0.428;
P , 0.0001; vs. standardized b, 20.06;
P = 0.23). Similarly, age and low serum
IgA positively correlated with eosinophil
concentration only in surgical-CRS

 patients. Alternately, surgical-CRS patients
had a trend for higher eosinophil
concentration soon after exposure, with
decline over time (28.6 6 16.7 cells/mo
decline; P = 0.093).
In the control group, there was no
impact of time postexposure on eosinophil
concentration (5 6 5 cells/mo increase;
P = 0.32). Age, IL-17A, low IgA, and time
postexposure explained 26% of the
observed variance in surgical-CRS patients’
eosinophil concentration (R2 = 0.26;
P , 0.0001). These four variables had no
association with eosinophils in control
subjects (R2 = 0.008; P = 0.56).
Longitudinal Eosinophil
Concentration in the Study Cohort
and Surgical-CRS
Examination of eosinophil concentration
and biomarkers obtained soon after WTC
exposure suggests biological differences
between surgical-CRS patients and other
subgroups in the study cohort. The FDNY-
WTCHP has preexposure data as well
as compressive longitudinal data on
eosinophil concentration. We therefore
explored if differences in surgical-CRS
patients’ concentrations existed before
exposure or extended beyond the initial
insult.
Figure 3 shows median eosinophil
concentrations from March 10, 2000, to
March 10, 2015, representing 97,733
person-years of follow-up in 18-month
intervals. The surgical-CRS patients had
higher eosinophils than the study cohort at
every time interval, including pre-9/11.
Analyzing results from a subset of 2,444
who had blood drawn 18 months pre-9/11,
in the first 18 months post-9/11, and during
the 36 months between March 11, 2003,
and March 10, 2006, we found that the
pre-9/11 eosinophils were 126 cells per
microliter (interquartile range [IQR],
78–198), increased to 160 cells per

months post-9/11, and then declined to 144

with values in all time intervals, the
pre-9/11 eosinophils were 149 cells per

179 cells per microliter (IQR, 120–251) in

declined to 162 cells per microliter (IQR,

(P , 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively).
Discussion
We present 13.5 years of post-9/11
longitudinal follow-up for 8,227 firefighters
who sustained intense, caustic dust exposure
from the WTC towers collapse and
participated in subsequent rescue and/or
recovery operations. Those who proceeded
to sinus surgery had elevated blood
eosinophil concentrations before exposure.
Further, only those who underwent sinus
surgery had an association between IL-17A
or low IgA and eosinophil concentration
after exposure.
These data are consistent with
immunological differences between those
who proceeded to sinus surgery and the rest
of the cohort that were evident years before
disease presentation. Since both acute and
chronic exposure to the WTC site were
significant risk factors for surgical-CRS,
there is a need for usable and effective
respiratory protection during long-term
rescue or recovery work at future disaster
sites. As this is often difficult to achieve,
blood eosinophils obtained before or
immediately after exposure could identify
those who might benefit the most from early
monitoring and targeted treatment. Blood
eosinophil concentration is a widely available,
well-studied biomarker of upper and lower
respiratory disease that is inexpensive,
externally valid, and currently collected in
many longitudinal cohorts (13, 22, 25).
Those firefighters who underwent sinus
surgery had higher blood eosinophil levels
than the study cohort throughout the study
period, including pre-9/11, suggesting that
an elevated eosinophil set point is intrinsic
to this vulnerable group. Surprisingly,
those with medical-CRS had eosinophil
concentrations similar to those of the cohort
and significantly below the surgical-CRS
patients.
Eosinophil blood levels increased after
9/11. The acute increase likely reflects
the systemic response to acute innate
inflammation. However, blood eosinophil
concentration declined after the first
postexposure 18-month interval and
trended to the preexposure equilibrium after
several years.
Exposed firefighters with elevated
blood eosinophil concentrations had an
8.4% cumulative incidence of sinus surgery
over 13.5 years, compared with 5.9% for
those with eosinophil levels in the bottom
three-fourths of the distribution, This
resulted in a 45% increased risk of surgical-
CRS in the multivariable Cox regression
model using data from the whole study
cohort. Only 20 (4%) of 479 of the surgical-
CRS cases had eosinophil concentrations
above 500 cells per microliter in the first
18 months after exposure, indicating that a
vast majority of those who proceeded to
nonresolving upper airway inflammation
had normal early eosinophil concentrations.
The biomarker component of this
investigation did not identify an association
between IgE and surgical-CRS. This is
different from exposed FDNY firefighters
with a lower airway diagnosis, where IgE
is a significant risk factor (26). The
biomarker data suggest that atopy was not
a large contributor to surgical-CRS in this
cohort.
Consistent with our prior observations
and recent reports, increasing IL-6 reduced
surgical-CRS hazard (23, 27). Importantly,
increasing IL-17A and age, along with low
IgA concentration, were associated with
eosinophils only in surgical-CRS patients
and not in controls. IL-17A is expressed by
excised nasal polyp tissue and correlates
with tissue eosinophil (19, 28, 29). Low IgA
concentration is a known risk factor for
sinus disease (30). Further research is
needed to define the underlying mechanism
of the differences in mucosal immunity
between surgical-CRS patients and those
who do not proceed to surgery.
Increasing acute and chronic
particulate exposure are strong risk factors
for surgical-CRS, demonstrating a link
between surgical-CRS and work at the WTC
site. The upper airway protects the lungs
by adsorbing “large” particles from inhaled
air. This filtering role renders the upper
airway vulnerable to caustic dust exposure.
Compared with arrival at the WTC site
on or after September 13, 2001, those
who arrived on 9/11 or September 12 had a
45% increased risk of surgical-CRS. This
results in a 6.6% cumulative incidence of
surgical-CRS over 13.5 years in the early-
arrival group compared with 4.6% in the
late-arrival group. Compared with working
at the site for 1 month, those who engaged
in WTC rescue or recovery work for 6 or
more months had a 48% increased risk of
surgical-CRS. This results in an 8.7%
cumulative incidence of surgical-CRS over
13.5 years in the prolonged exposure group
compared with 4.9% in the briefer exposure
group.
The combined effect of early acute
injury followed by chronic, persistent
exposure predisposes these workers to
nonresolving inflammation and surgical-
CRS years later. The impact of early
arrival is most pronounced in smokers, a
subgroup with preexisting upper airway
inflammation.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study.
FDNY firefighters may not be representative
of the larger population of non-FDNY
WTC-exposed individuals. First, the FDNY
study cohort is overwhelmingly male and
previously healthy and experienced a
massive particulate exposure. This analysis
identified risk factors for the most common
pathways to surgical-CRS and likely missed
risk factors for less common pathways to
disease in this population.
It is likely that atopy is an
underrepresented pathway to sinus disease
in this population. Asthma precludes work
as a firefighter, and most of the WTC-
exposed patients had irritant-induced
symptoms with no biomarker evidence of
atopy within 18 months of exposure and
little clinical evidence of an allergic
component at presentation. Low levels of
atopy are especially likely in the biomarker
control population that excluded both upper
and lower airway diseases to increase the
likelihood of identifying atopy in the
surgical-CRS patients. Nevertheless, a wide
range of findings in the FDNY cohort has
been replicated in other WTC-exposed
cohorts.
Second, this study was designed to
assess early predictors of surgical-CRS risk,
so subsequent events, such as repeated
irritant exposures or treatment before
surgery, were not studied. Third, the data
represent risk factors obtained before
disease, reducing the potential for “reverse
causation,” but none of the eosinophil or

 other biomarker data imply a causal
relationship to disease. The longitudinal
eosinophil analysis and biomarker data
suggest that surgical-CRS patients are
biologically different in one or more of the
innumerable pathways impacting blood
eosinophil concentration when compared
with the cohort or biomarker controls.
Association of increased IL-17A and
reduced IgA levels with eosinophils could
be a result of the early immune response
in those predisposed to nonresolving
inflammation or could cause nonresolving
inflammation resulting in surgical-CRS.
In spite of these limitations, the FDNY-
WTCHP is a valuable resource for
understanding irritant-induced diseases
such as CRS in the occupational
setting, where there is little available data
(31, 32).
Conclusions
Acute and chronic WTC exposure
were risks for nonresolving upper
airway inflammation, with recurrent
CRS responding poorly to medical
management that ultimately was treated
with surgery years later. Increasing
eosinophils served as a biomarker for a
population that had increased vulnerability
to upper airway injury after WTC
exposure. The finding that increasing
eosinophils was associated with
increased rates of surgical-CRS supports
earlier observations linking eosinophilia
with sinusitis in WTC-exposed
children (13). Finally, surgical-CRS
patients are likely predisposed to
exaggerated inflammation and/or poor
counterregulatory responses to
inflammation (18–21).
In future disasters, improved
respiratory protection during the rescue
and/or recovery phase may be effective in
reducing the hazard of difficult-to-
treat CRS. Pathways to nonresolving
inflammation are induced and/or sustained
by repeated irritant exposures over months.
Targeting these inflammatory pathways
for intervention early in the disease
evolution may yield more effective therapies.
Further research is required to identify
additional biomarkers of disease associated
with above-average blood eosinophil
concentration and develop more effective
treatments for patients with CRS with
persistent symptoms, despite currently
available medical management. n
