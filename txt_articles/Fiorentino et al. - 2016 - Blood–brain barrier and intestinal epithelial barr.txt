Abstract
Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex conditions whose pathogenesis may be attributed
to gene–environment interactions. There are no definitive mechanisms explaining how environmental triggers
can lead to ASD although the involvement of inflammation and immunity has been suggested. Inappropriate
antigen trafficking through an impaired intestinal barrier, followed by passage of these antigens or immune-
activated complexes through a permissive blood–brain barrier (BBB), can be part of the chain of events
leading to these disorders. Our goal was to investigate whether an altered BBB and gut permeability is part
of the pathophysiology of ASD.
Methods: Postmortem cerebral cortex and cerebellum tissues from ASD, schizophrenia (SCZ), and healthy
subjects (HC) and duodenal biopsies from ASD and HC were analyzed for gene and protein expression
profiles. Tight junctions and other key molecules associated with the neurovascular unit integrity and function
and neuroinflammation were investigated.
Results: Claudin (CLDN)-5 and -12 were increased in the ASD cortex and cerebellum. CLDN-3, tricellulin, and
MMP-9 were higher in the ASD cortex. IL-8, tPA, and IBA-1 were downregulated in SCZ cortex; IL-1b was
increased in the SCZ cerebellum. Differences between SCZ and ASD were observed for most of the genes
analyzed in both brain areas. CLDN-5 protein was increased in ASD cortex and cerebellum, while CLDN-12
appeared reduced in both ASD and SCZ cortexes. In the intestine, 75% of the ASD samples analyzed had
reduced expression of barrier-forming TJ components (CLDN-1, OCLN, TRIC), whereas 66% had increased pore-
forming CLDNs (CLDN-2, -10, -15) compared to controls.
Conclusions: In the ASD brain, there is an altered expression of genes associated with BBB integrity coupled
with increased neuroinflammation and possibly impaired gut barrier integrity. While these findings seem to
be specific for ASD, the possibility of more distinct SCZ subgroups should be explored with additional studies.

 Background
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmen-
tal diseases with complex symptoms and whose neurobio-
logical basis remains poorly understood. Research suggests
that a combination of genetic, autoimmune, environ-
mental, and perhaps in utero risk factors leading to
neuroinflammation can contribute to the pathogenesis
of ASD [1–6] as well as other neurobehavioral and/or
neuropsychiatric
disorders
including
schizophrenia
(SCZ) [7–13]. Over-expression of acute phase proteins
in the serum, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid of ASD as
well as SCZ individuals suggests that inflammation is
involved in the pathophysiology of these diseases [4, 6,
14–21]. Autoimmune diseases have been associated
with increased risk of ASD and SCZ [10, 22–28] sug-
gesting altered or inappropriate immune responses.
Furthermore, many ASD patients experience gastro-
intestinal (GI) symptoms and/or dysfunctions [29–38].
Clinical observations describe increased intestinal perme-
ability in ASD [39–42], and permeability to food antigens
derived from the partial digestion of wheat (gliadorphins)
and cow’s milk (casomorphins) has been reported in both
ASD and SCZ [41, 43–46].
Despite research efforts, there are no defined explana-
tions of how environmental triggers can lead to these
neurobehavioral conditions. One hypothesis, based on the
interconnectivity of the gut–brain axis, suggests that in-
appropriate
antigen
trafficking
through
an
impaired
intestinal barrier, followed by passage of antigens or acti-
vated immune complexes through a permissive blood–
brain barrier (BBB), can be part of the chain of events lead-
ing to neuroinflammation and thereby subsequent disease.

 The BBB plays a critical role in the central nervous
system (CNS) defense through limiting the access of
circulating solutes, macromolecules, and cells that could
negatively impact neuronal activity. Dysfunctions of the
BBB have been associated with numerous neurological
disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis,
and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease [47–56].
The overall goal of this study was to assess whether a
dysfunctional BBB or gut barrier could contribute patho-
physiologically to ASD. To address this, we conducted an
in-depth molecular analysis of the components associated
with the BBB and gut barrier integrity in postmortem brain
tissue and small intestinal biopsies obtained from ASD
subjects. In addition, we assessed changes in the BBB in-
tegrity of patients with SCZ as SCZ is a psychiatric illness
in which the involvement of inflammation, immunity and
altered BBB integrity have been postulated [22, 23, 57, 58].
Methods
Postmortem tissues
Human frozen postmortem brain tissue blocks (1 to
2 cm3) from the frontal cortex (Brodmann’s area 45) and
cerebellum (CBL) of 15 HC and eight ASD subjects
were obtained from the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank
for Developmental Disorders at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA, which is a Brain and
Tissue Repository of the NIH NeuroBioBank. Additionally,
the Maryland Brain Collection of the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Center at the University of Maryland School of
Medicine, Baltimore, USA, provided ten SCZ samples from
each of the two aforementioned brain areas of interest.
Duodenal biopsies
Biopsy specimens were taken from the second portion of
the duodenum from ASD (n = 12) and control (n = 9)
patients with GI symptoms undergoing esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy (EGD) for clinically indicated reasons. All
study subjects provided written informed consent for the
collection of additional biopsies, for the purpose of this
study, during the procedure. This study was approved by
the Partners Human Research Committee (PHRC) at
Massachusetts General Hospital and performed in accord-
ance with the ethical standards and regulatory require-
ments set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki.

 Gene expression profile analysis
Total RNA was isolated from samples (~100 mg) using
Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and/or Direct-
zol RNA miniprep spin columns (Zymo Research, Irvine,
CA) following the manufacturers’ instructions. RNA
concentrations and A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios
were measured with the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) before 2 μg total RNA were reverse
transcribed using random hexamer primers and Maxima
universal first strand cDNA synthesis kit #1661 (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR) was used to measure gene expression levels
and was performed in an iCycler96X detection system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. In brain tissues, we analyzed the expression
level of genes associated with the formation, integrity,
and function of the BBB and neuroinflammation, as
follows:
Claudin(CLDN)-1,
CLDN-3,
CLDN-5,
and
CLDN-12; occludin (OCLN); tricellulin (TRIC); vascu-
lar endothelial cadherin (VE-Cad); interleukin (IL)-1b,
IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10; the microglia activation marker
ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (IBA)-1; the
translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO); matrix metallo-
protease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9; tissue transglutami-
nase (tTG)-6; tissue plasminogen activator (tPA); and
the major facilitator super family domain containing
2A (MFSD2A). Duodenal biopsies were evaluated for
the expression of CLDN-1, CLDN-2, CLDN-10, CLDN-
15, TRIC, and OCLN. 18S housekeeping gene was
chosen as internal control. CLDN-2, CLDN-3, CLDN-
10, CLDN-15, TRIC, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tTG-6,
IBA-1, TSPO, and MSFD2A primers were purchased
from Qiagen (RT2 qPCR or Quantitect Primer Assay).
The other primer sets used were purchased by IDT
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), and
their sequences together with gene function in the
context of the BBB and/or gut are listed in Table 1.
The sequence specificity of synthesized primers (IDT)
were determined by the online Blast program from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) and
compared with the GenBank database. Differences in gene
expression profiles were evaluated applying the 2(−ddCT)
method [59].
Protein detection
Western blot analysis was performed as routinely de-
scribed. Brain tissues (~100 mg) were homogenized on
ice in lysis buffer [RIPA Buffer (Sigma, S. Louis, MO)]
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini,

 Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14 K rpm for
30 min at 4 °C in a benchtop centrifuge. The super-
natant, representing total protein lysate, was collected,
and protein concentration was determined by Lowry
protein assay (DC, BioRad, Hercules, CA) using bovine
serum albumin (BSA) as a protein standard. Protein
lysates were mixed with loading buffer and reducing
agent (both from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and
heated at 99 °C for 5 min. The lysates were then loaded
on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) and after gel electrophoresis transferred onto PVDF
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA
in Tris buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and
incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Actin
was used as loading control while ACTA2, also known as
alpha-smooth muscle actin (in this paper reported as
SMA), was used for quantitative analysis normalization
for tight junction (TJ) proteins. The membranes were
washed three times with TBST and incubated with sec-
ondary antibody (diluted 1:5000 in 5% BSA-TBST) for
1 h at room temperature. Western blot signal was visu-
alized using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared scan (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Results were quantified with
the ImageJ 1.47 software (NIH). The protein levels were

Antibodies
Mouse anti-claudin-5 (cat # 35–2500; 1:500) antibody was
purchased from Life Technologies, (Carlsbad, CA). Mouse
anti-actin protein antibody (cat # 82353; 1:2000) was pur-
chased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).
Rabbit anti-claudin-12 (cat # NBP1-87450; 1:500) was pur-
chased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Rabbit anti-
alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody (#Ab5694;
1:1000) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). LI-
COR IRDye800 anti-rabbit (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
NE; cat # 92632211) and Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; cat # A21057)
were used as secondary antibodies in WB analysis.
Statistics
Data were analyzed by using the GraphPad (San
Diego,
CA)
software.
Comparisons
among
groups
were made by the one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis
H test; Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons). Differ-
ences between two groups were calculated by the un-
paired t test (Mann–Whitney). All data with p < 0.05
were considered significant.
Results
Subjects
A total of 33 brain sections from the three subject
groups were studied. No drug abuse or gunshot wounds
were reported for ASD subjects. Two of the ASD indi-
viduals were on therapy with one antipsychotic and/or
antidepressant. Those ASD cases whose cause of death
was drowning were not considered for the brain study to
eliminate the damaging effects on brain and vasculature
caused by hypoxia/anoxia [60, 61]. Of the ten SCZ indi-
viduals, no medical records were available. The only
existing information was collected at autopsy: the post-
mortem toxicological analysis showed that three had
used antipsychotics and/or antidepressants, one had
used cocaine and one had ingested alcohol prior to
death. Similar to ASD patients, no gunshot wounds at
the head region were reported for SCZ subjects. The
control cases had no known neurological disorder or
known neuropathology. Three HC out of 15 had a his-
tory of drugs and/or alcohol abuse. Biopsies from the
second portion of the duodenum were collected from
the ASD (n = 12) and control (n = 8) patients with
gastrointestinal symptoms. The available clinical charac-
teristics of the analyzed subjects, together with demo-
graphic data are summarized in Table 2.

 Genes associated with BBB integrity and function are
differentially regulated in the brain of ASD subjects
To assess the integrity of the BBB, we measured the
gene expression levels of the major components of the
brain microvascular endothelial tight junctions (TJs) by
qRT-PCR, in the cortex and CBL of HC (n = 15), ASD
(n = 8), and SCZ (n = 10) subjects. In the cortex, CLDN-
3, -5, and -12 and TRIC were upregulated in ASD sub-
jects compared to controls (Fig. 1). Neither CLDN-1,
OCLN, nor VE-Cad were differentially expressed in the
cortex in any of the groups analyzed (not shown). Gene
expression profiles of tPA, IBA-1, TSPO, MFSD2A, pro-
inflammatory cytokines, and members of the matrix
metalloprotease (MMP) family, described to be linked to
BBB
function
disruption
and/or
neuroinflammation,
were also analyzed. Results showed that in the cortex of
ASD subjects, MMP-9 and TSPO were significantly
upregulated compared to those of the HC, whereas tPA
and IBA-1 appeared downregulated in SCZ compared in
HC (Fig. 2). None of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
analyzed were differentially regulated in ASD compared
in HC. While IL-8 appeared significantly reduced in SCZ
vs. HC, all cytokines evaluated were expressed at a lower
level in SCZ compared to ASD (Fig. 3). IL-10 and tTG6
expressions were below detection levels. In the CBL,
similar to our findings in the cortex, CLDN-5, −12 and
TSPO were found to be elevated in ASD subjects when
compared to HC (Fig. 4). Among the other genes ana-
lyzed, IL-1b appeared significantly higher in SCZ vs. HC
(Fig. 4). As a general observation, unlike ASD, SCZ
subjects clustered well together for most of the genes
analyzed in both brain areas. The gene expression fold
changes relative to HC (=1) and the corresponding p
values are summarized in Table 3.
BBB tight junction proteins are altered in ASD and SCZ
subjects
To understand whether our gene expression results
correlated with levels of protein produced, we per-
formed western blotting analysis of tissue lysates using
commercially available antibodies against
some TJ
components in both the cortex and CBL of HC, ASD,
and SCZ subjects. Consistent with the gene expression
profile,
we observed a
significant higher level of
CLDN-5 in the cortex of ASD subjects, compared in
HC (Fig. 5). Interestingly and in this case in opposition
to gene expression results, CLDN-12 was reduced in
the cortex of ASD and also showed a reduced trend in
SCZ subjects (Fig. 5).
In the CBL (Fig. 6), the production of CLDN-5 in
ASD appeared slightly higher than in HC (p = 0.1),
whereas its level in SCZ was reduced compared to

 that in HC (p = 0.07), although data did not reach statis-
tical significance. No differences were observed for
CLDN-12 among the groups.
Increased pore-forming CLDNs and decreased barrier-
forming TJ components expression in the intestine of
ASD patients
To corroborate our hypothesis of a possible involvement
of a dysfunctional intestinal barrier in the pathogenesis of
ASD, we analyzed small intestinal biopsies of ASD and
HC subjects for TJ defects (Fig. 7). Our results showed
that 75% (9 out of 12) of the samples analyzed had a
decreased expression of at least one barrier-forming TJ
component (CLDN-1, OCLN, TRIC), whereas about 66%
(eight out of 12) showed increased levels of pore-forming
CLDNs, described to increase intestinal permeability
(CLDN-2, CLDN-10, CLDN-15) ([62–65]).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study ad-
dressing the molecular signature of BBB dysfunctions in
ASD and SCZ in human samples. In spite of the obvious
small sample number, due to the nature of the samples
and the consequent procurement difficulty, we observed
statistically
significant
differences
among
the
study
groups. However, it is also worthwhile to acknowledge
that the small sample number may have affected some
otherwise possibly significant results, which could have
emerged if a larger number of tissues had been available.
Our molecular analysis of the BBB integrity and func-
tion shows an altered BBB in the ASD subjects evalu-
ated. Indeed, the increased gene expression of MMP-9
we detected in ASD subjects supports our hypothesis of
an impaired BBB, most likely associated with neuroin-
flammation. Several pieces of evidence indicate that
MMP-9 secretion induces BBB disruption and this is an
important step in the development of inflammatory
diseases of the nervous system [66–74]. Although we did
not observe elevated gene expression levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in the ASD subjects analyzed in
this study, we found a significantly high expression of
TSPO in the ASD brain. TSPO increased expression level
in activated microglia and reactive astrocytes [75–81] is

 associated with brain injury and neuroinflammation,
making TSPO a reliable marker of brain inflammation.
Of the four claudins (i.e., CLDN-1, -3, -5 and -12)
that to date are thought to be incorporated in the BBB
[82–85], we found that two were significantly more
expressed in the ASD brain as compared in HC. CLDN-
5, the major and more abundant cell adhesion molecule
of TJs in brain endothelial cells, is expressed 5.1 and
3.6 times higher in the cortex and CBL of ASD sub-
jects, respectively, than in those of HC (Table 3). Simi-
larly, CLDN-12 is expressed about 7.7 and 3.6 times
more in the ASD cortex and CBL, respectively, than in
the control group. CLDN-3, on the other hand, appears
elevated by about 2.7 and 3.0 times in the cortex of
both SCZ and ASD subjects, respectively, compared in
that of HC. TRIC, another component of the TJs associ-
ated with increased epithelial tightness and decreased
permeability to macromolecules [86], appears signifi-
cantly elevated in the ASD cortex, suggesting either a
more competent BBB or a compensatory mechanism
for disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.
At the protein level, CLDN-5 is elevated in the ASD
cortex, consistent with its mRNA expression, whereas, on
the other hand, CLDN-12 is significantly reduced. An
increased gene expression of sealing TJ components
(CLDN-5, -12, and -3 and TRIC) should imply a tighter
BBB and a better control in the diffusion of macromole-
cules. However, our data on MMP9 and TSPO expression
compatible with ongoing neuroinflammation suggest a
compensatory mechanism to repair a compromised BBB.
Another plausible explanation for the CLDN-5 data is
that, once produced, the protein is not capable of being
incorporated into the TJ complex because of impaired
trafficking to the endothelial cell–cell interface or because
the protein has some mutations that prevent it from
establishing homophilic and/or heterophilic protein–pro-
tein interactions, leading to a sustained compensatory
gene expression and protein accumulation. On the other
hand, the discrepancy between gene upregulation and de-
creased protein expression observed for CLDN-12 might
suggest the existence of a compensatory mechanism for
post-translational destruction/degradation of the protein
itself. While the sealing function of CLDN-5 in BBB TJs is
well established [83, 87], that of CLDN-3 and -12 are less
understood.
CLDN-1
and
-3
sequences
are
highly
homologous to CLDN-5, suggesting similar properties. In-
deed, several studies strongly suggest that CLDN-3 con-
tributes to BBB tightness [85, 88–90]. Conversely, CLDN-
12 sequence is quite dissimilar from those of CLDN-1 and
-3, and this might indicate a different function. Piontek et
al. [91] showed that CLDN-12 cannot form homophilic
trans-interactions or homopolymeric strands in vitro, sug-
gesting that “heterophilic cis- and/or trans-interactions
with another TJ-protein are necessary for the incorpor-
ation of CLDN-12 in strands.” It may be hypothesized that
the increased CLDN-5 we observed in ASD subjects
might be compensatory to a decreased CLDN-12 in a
heterophilic cis- and/or trans-interaction between the two
claudins.
Our cohort of SCZ individuals did not show major
changes in the genes analyzed compared to HC, except
for an increased IL-1b in the CBL and significantly re-
duced levels of tPA and IBA-1 in the cortex. Whereas
we do not know the physiological relevance of downreg-
ulated IBA-1, our results are in agreement with data
from
other
studies
indicating
activation
of
pro-
inflammatory networks and reduced tPA activity in SCZ
[92–102], this latter feature leading to a dysfunctional
coagulation system and increased risk of thrombotic
events in SCZ patients [101]. Other genes analyzed in SCZ
appeared to follow a trend similar to ASD subjects (i.e., in-
creased CLDN-3 and reduced CLDN-12 protein level in
the cortex). Furthermore, although non-statistically signifi-
cant (p = 0.07), we did observe a trend toward reduced
CLDN-5 protein level in the SCZ CBL as well, suggesting
a possibly leaking BBB. Previous clinical and postmortem
research in SCZ has suggested that an impaired BBB could
be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of the disease
in only a subgroup of SCZ patients [103–105]. It is import-
ant to mention that the SCZ and ASD subjects studied
were not selected on the basis of specific immune bio-
markers and, therefore, may represent a mixed group of
patients, which thereby limits the statistical significance of
some of our findings. A sample stratification approach
based on specific immunological features might be a better
way of analyzing pathways of interest, and this may be par-
ticularly true for SCZ, a disorder characterized by marked
clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity. Alternatively,
SCZ physiopathology may lie in subtle changes that chron-
ically affect brain function.
As for the intestine, due to the high heterogeneity
intrinsic of ASD, our goal was to elucidate the TJ com-
ponent profile from a functional perspective. Toward
this aim, we have analyzed the expression level of TJ
elements
dividing
them
into
two
major
functional
groups:
pore-forming
(CLDN-1,
OCLN, TRIC)
and

 barrier-forming components (CLDN-2, -10, -15). These
results, showing increased expression levels of pore-
forming (66% of the ASD samples) and decreased levels
of barrier-forming (75% of the ASD samples) TJ compo-
nents in the duodenal samples, suggest an impaired gut
barrier and serve as a proof of concept to support the
hypothesis of a gut–brain axis dysfunction in a subgroup
of ASD patients. According to this hypothesis, non-self
antigens crossing a damaged intestinal barrier elicit a
local
and/or
systemic
inflammatory
reaction

 associated with a breach of the BBB, may lead to ASD in
genetically predisposed subjects.
This study addressed for the first time, at the molecular
level, some relevant and still open questions regarding the
gut–brain axis in neurobehavioral disorders and further-
more demonstrated that both the BBB and gut barrier
may be affected in ASD. However, these findings present
with a few limitations. The first lies in the postmortem
nature of the samples with potential confounding factors
deriving from tissue preservation and the personal history
of each subject, including exposure to medications, health
conditions, cause of death, and postmortem interval
(PMI). Our statistical analysis of the PMI showed no
differences among groups suggesting that PMI might not
have affected our results. Similarly, data from medical
records or postmortem toxicology analysis showed that
about the same number of subjects in ASD and SCZ
groups were on antipsychotics/antidepressants, so it is
unlikely that the differences we observed among groups
could be explained by the effects of the drugs. For clarity,
a few studies addressing the impact of antipsychotics on
the BBB function do suggest a disturbance effect on its
sealing property [106, 107], whereas other studies on the
blood–cerebrospinal (BCS) fluid barrier show divergent
results [103, 108]. Furthermore, there are numerous stud-
ies reporting the suppressing effect of antipsychotics on
the blood cytokine profile in SCZ and ASD [98, 109–118],
as well as on microglia activation [119, 120], that could
explain our data on IBA-1 and the cytokine gene expres-
sion profiles. However, our IBA-1 results are well in
agreement with the published studies on postmortem
brain tissues showing no significant changes in its expres-
sion in ASD [121].
The second limitation of this study is represented by its
descriptive nature that does not allow us to draw conclu-
sions on the causality of a breach of the intestinal/BBB in-
tegrity supporting neuroinflammation and ASD and SCZ
symptoms. However, our data is in line with animal studies
suggesting causality between loss of barrier function and
neurobehavioral changes compatible with ASD [122–124].
Finally, as already mentioned, a third limitation is repre-
sented by the small number of samples analyzed due to
limited availability which might impact on the statistical
significance of some of our results. However, given the
complexity of the studies performed and the difficulty
associated with the procurement of these samples, our
study represents a solid foundation to justify a more robust
sample collection and analysis to further investigate the
gut–brain axis in ASD.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results seem to point to a dysfunc-
tional gut–brain axis associated with neuroinflammation
in ASD. When clustered together by functional groups
(barrier
properties,
pro-inflammatory
markers,
and
enzymatic activity), our data support the notion that in
ASD, there is a differential regulation of the pathways
associated with our hypothesis of a gut–brain axis dys-
function involving the intestinal barrier, BBB integrity/
function, and neuroinflammation (Fig. 8). Certainly,
more in-depth molecular studies, possibly in animal or
in vitro cell culture models, are necessary to understand
the specific mechanisms behind the BBB disturbance we
have herein reported. These studies will allow for patient
stratification and personalized interventions (precision
medicine) to target specific pathways involved in the
pathogenesis of ASD.
