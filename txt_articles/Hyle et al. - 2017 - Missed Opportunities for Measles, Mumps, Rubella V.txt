Abstract
Background—Measles outbreaks continue to occur in the United States and are mostly due to 
infections in returning travelers.
Objective—We described how providers assessed the measles immunity status of departing U.S. 
adult travelers seeking pretravel consultation and assessed reasons given for nonvaccination among 
those considered eligible to receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Design—Observational study in U.S. pretravel clinics.
Setting—24 sites associated with Global TravEpiNet (GTEN), a Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention-funded consortium.
Patients—Adults (born in or after 1957) attending pre-travel consultations at GTEN sites 
(2009-2014).
IRB Approval: An institutional review board at all 24 participating sites either approved the study or considered it exempt from 
review.

 Measurements—Structured questionnaire completed by traveler and provider during pretravel 
consultation.
Results—We included 40,810 adult travelers; providers considered 6,612 (16%) to be eligible for 
MMR vaccine at the time of pretravel consultation. Of the MMR-eligible, 3,477 (53%) were not 
vaccinated at the visit; of these, 1,689 (48%) were not vaccinated due to traveler refusal, 966 
(28%) due to provider decision, and 822 (24%) due to health systems barriers. Most MMR-eligible 
travelers who were not vaccinated were evaluated in the South (2,262 travelers, 65%) or at 
nonacademic centers (1,777 travelers, 51%). Nonvaccination due to traveler refusal was most 
frequent in the South (1,432 travelers, 63%) or at nonacademic centers (1,178 travelers, 66%).
Limitations—Our estimates could underrepresent the opportunities for MMR vaccination, as 
providers accepted verbal histories of disease and vaccination as evidence of immunity.
Conclusions—Sixteen percent of U.S. adult travelers who presented for pretravel consultation at 
GTEN sites met criteria for MMR vaccination according to the provider's assessment, but fewer 
than half of these travelers were vaccinated. An increase in MMR vaccination of eligible U.S. 
adult travelers could reduce the likelihood of measles importations and transmissions.
Introduction
In 2000, endemic measles was eliminated in the United States (1). Nevertheless, measles 
outbreaks persist due to imported cases (2). More than half of such measles importations 
occur in returning unvaccinated U.S. travelers who acquire infection with measles while 
abroad; these individuals may infect others following their return to the United States (3).
Since 1989, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)has recommended 
two documented doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for all adult international 
travelers without evidence of prior measles immunity (4, 5). The risk of acquiring measles is 
greatly increased outside the U.S. (6, 7), and air travel has been associated with measles 
transmission (8). When evaluating patients before international travel, some healthcare 
providers may not be aware that measles is a travel-associated illness, despite ACIP 
recommendations (7).
A single imported measles case can lead to many secondary and tertiary cases, so imported 
measles cases often have a wide-reaching impact in the United States (2). Measles spreads 
via aerosolized droplets and is highly infectious; ninety percent of exposed, unvaccinated 
people will become ill with measles after entering a room that housed an infected person for 
up to two hours beforehand (9). The risks of measles transmission are magnified in 
communities with a higher prevalence of unvaccinated adults and children (10), such as 
occurred with the so-called “Disneyland” outbreak of measles in 2015, when an infected 
visitor to Disneyland led to 147 reported cases in 7 states (11). Similarly, just two imported 
measles cases from travelers returning from the Philippines in 2014 led to an outbreak of 
383 cases in Ohio in a primarily unvaccinated Amish community (12, 13).
In this multisite observational study, our goal was to describe how clinicians who are 
experienced in providing pretravel medical advice assess for measles immunity at pretravel

 medical encounters and to examine reasons for nonvaccination among those who are MMR 
vaccine-eligible.
Methods
Study setting
Global TravEpiNet (GTEN) is a consortium of clinical sites throughout the United States 
that provide pretravel health advice and vaccination (14). Fourteen sites are academic 
centers which have affiliations with university hospitals or medical schools; the 10 other 
sites are primary care practices, pharmacies, and public health clinics. Each GTEN site 
prospectively and systematically collects data regarding every pretravel health consultation. 
The 24 sites that contributed data to this analysis are in four census regions of the United 
States: Northeast (8 sites), Midwest (2 sites), South (8 sites), and West (6 sites) (15).
Study population and eligibility criteria
Travelers were included if they were aged 18 years or older when they visited a GTEN 
clinical site for pretravel health consultation between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 
2014. Travelers born before 1957 were excluded because life-long natural measles immunity 
is assumed in this age group and thus ACIP does not recommend MMR vaccination (5).
Data collection, assessment of measles immunity and vaccine eligibility, and clinical 
management of the vaccine-eligible
During the pretravel consultation, travelers and providers used an online structured 
questionnaire, as previously described (14),(16). Travelers entered information into the 
structured questionnaire regarding their age, medical conditions, and travel itinerary (e.g., 
destination(s), reason for travel, and duration of travel). Providers confirmed the information 
entered by the traveler, and then entered additional data about immunization history, health 
advice provided, vaccines administered (including MMR), and medications prescribed 
during the pretravel consultation.
Providers assessed travelers' measles immunity status during the pretravel health encounter 
in accordance with their routine clinical practice. As such, self-reported immunization or 
measles illness history may have been accepted. The structured questionnaire required 
providers to characterize their assessment of measles immunity in one of four ways: (1) a 
history of two MMR vaccinations, (2) a positive measles serology, (3) a prior measles 
illness, or (4) “immune per provider judgment” (i.e. the provider considered the traveler 
immune but did not indicate a specific reason).
Regardless of the time until departure, the structured questionnaire required providers to 
consider MMR vaccination for all travelers not considered immune for one of the reasons 
listed above and who had no medical contraindication to MMR vaccination (i.e. pregnancy 
or immunosuppression), as per ACIP guidelines (4, 5). In this analysis, we term these 
travelers “MMR-eligible”. If providers did not vaccinate a MMR-eligible traveler, they were 
required to select one of the following five explanations: (1) traveler refusal, (2) vaccination 
not indicated for this patient/itinerary, (3) insufficient time for vaccination before departure,

 (4) vaccine unavailable at the clinic, or (5) referral to another provider for vaccination. 
Before 2012, providers did not record a specific reason for traveler refusal of a 
recommended MMR vaccine. Beginning in 2012, providers were required to select only one 
of the following three reasons for why travelers refused vaccination: (1) traveler is 
concerned about vaccine safety, (2) traveler is concerned about vaccine cost, or (3) traveler is 
not concerned about the vaccine-preventable illness.
Statistical analyses
We characterized adult travelers into two cohorts depending on their birth year (1957-89 and 
≥1990) because the recommendation to vaccinate all children aged ≥1 year routinely with 
two doses of MMR vaccine began in 1989 (4, 5).
We grouped destination countries into six geographic regions, as defined by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) in 2012: Americas, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, 
South-East Asia, and Western Pacific (17). Reasons for travel included business, 
humanitarian service work, leisure, research/education, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), 
and other (18). We defined VFR travelers according to the CDC definition: travelers to a 
low- or low-middle-income country of their or their parents' birth who stated the reason for 
travel was “traveling to region of origin of self or family to visit friends or relatives” or who 
noted that they would stay with relatives during the itinerary (19). We dichotomized travel 
duration into <14 days and ≥14 days (14 days being the median duration). We categorized 
the location of GTEN clinic sites into the four U.S. census regions (i.e., Northeast, Midwest, 
South, West). We dichotomized the type of clinic into academic centers (i.e., 14 sites that 
were affiliated with university hospitals or medical schools) and nonacademic centers (i.e., 
10 sites that were primary care practices, pharmacies, and public health clinics). We grouped 
reasons that were provided for not vaccinating the MMR-eligible into three categories: 
traveler refusal (i.e., traveler declined because of lack of concern about measles or concerns 
about vaccine safety or cost); provider decision (i.e., provider considered that the vaccine 
was not indicated or provider reported that there was insufficient time to vaccinate before 
travel); and health systems barriers (i.e., referral of the traveler to another provider for 
vaccination or the vaccine was unavailable at the travel clinic).
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We 
obtained summary statistics (proportions, means, medians and standard deviations) for the 
demographic and travel-related characteristics, overall and within subgroups of travelers 
with measles immunity, medical contraindication to vaccination, vaccine eligibility, and 
nonvaccination among the MMR-eligible, in the four U.S. census regions.
Results
Providers assessed 54,100 adult travelers at 24 GTEN sites (Figure 1). We excluded 13,290 
travelers because they were born before 1957 and therefore were presumed to be immune to 
measles infection. The distribution of sites and travelers from different U.S. census regions 
is described in Supplementary Appendix Table A1.

 Of the 40,810 study participants, 22,987 (56%) were female (Table 1). The median age of 
travelers was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26-44); 35,035 (86%) were born between 
1957 and 1989. Africa was the most common destination region with 14,471 (36%) 
travelers, followed by 11,562 (28%) travelers to the Americas. Of all travelers, 20,507 (50%) 
were planning travel for leisure; 3,208 (8%) were VFR travelers. The median duration of 
travel was 14 days (IQR 10-24).
Providers deemed 34,092 travelers (84%) to be immune to measles based on their clinical 
assessment. Of these, providers considered 24,884 (73%) to be immune because of a history 
of receiving 2 MMR vaccinations, a positive measles serology (3,479; 10%), or a history of 
measles illness (1,024, 3%); the remainder were considered immune per provider judgment 
(5,985, 18%) (Figure 1). Among the 6,718 nonimmune travelers, 106 had a medical 
contraindication to MMR vaccination. A total of 6,612 (16%) adult travelers were therefore 
eligible for MMR vaccination at the pretravel consultation.
Providers were required to consider MMR vaccination for all international travelers. Of the 
6,612 MMR-eligible travelers, 3,477 (53%) were not vaccinated at the pretravel encounter 
(Figure 1). We observed variability in the proportion of MMR-eligible travelers who were 
not vaccinated across GTEN sites. At three sites, providers considered no travelers to be 
MMR-eligible. Of the MMR-eligible travelers evaluated at the remaining 21 sites, providers 
vaccinated none of the MMR-eligible travelers (84 travelers, 1% of MMR-eligible) at two 
sites, <10% of all MMR-eligible travelers (1,477 travelers, 22% of MMR-eligible) at three, 
additional sites, and 10-50% of all MMR-eligible travelers (1,462, 22%) at 10 additional 
sites. Providers vaccinated >50% of MMR-eligible travelers (3,563 travelers, 54% of MMR-
eligible) at only six sites.
We evaluated the demographic and travel-related characteristics of MMR-eligible travelers 
who were vaccinated or not (Table 2). More than half (1,887 travelers, 54%) of the 3,477 
MMR-eligible travelers who were not vaccinated were female; 401 (12%) were VFR 
travelers. The majority of MMR-eligible travelers who were not vaccinated were seen at 
GTEN sites in the South (2,265 travelers, 65%), and more were seen at non-academic 
centers (1,777 travelers, 51%) than at academic centers (1,700 travelers, 49%).
Providers were required to provide a rationale when MMR vaccine was not administered to 
those who were MMR-eligible (Figure 1). Of the 3,477 MMR-eligible travelers who were 
not vaccinated, 1,689 (48%) were not vaccinated because of traveler refusal, 966 (28%) due 
to provider decision, and 822 (24%) due to health systems barriers.
Beginning in 2012, providers assessed the reasons why travelers refused MMR vaccine 
(Figure 1). Of the 958 travelers who refused MMR vaccine in 2012 or after, the most 
frequent reason cited for refusal was that the traveler was “not concerned about illness” (711 
travelers, 74%). We also assessed the reasons why providers did not offer MMR vaccine to 
MMR-eligible travelers. Of the 966 travelers who were not vaccinated because of the 
provider's decision, most were not vaccinated (911 travelers, 94%) because the provider 
thought the MMR vaccine was not indicated; only 55 (6%) travelers were not vaccinated 
because the provider thought there was insufficient time before travel. Of the 822 travelers

 who were not vaccinated due to health systems barriers, the predominant barrier was referral 
to another provider for vaccination (812 travelers, 99%).
The majority of MMR-eligible travelers (51%) who were not vaccinated were evaluated at 
nonacademic sites (Table 2), despite the fact that only 27% of all travelers were seen at 
nonacademic sites (Table 1). Of the 1,777 MMR-eligible travelers evaluated at nonacademic 
centers who were not vaccinated, 1,178 (66%) were not vaccinated due to traveler refusal.
We further examined the differences observed in MMR eligibility and vaccination among 
GTEN sites in different U.S. census regions (Table 3; demographic data in Supplementary 
Appendix Table 2). Providers at the eight clinical sites in the South evaluated 9,692 travelers 
and considered 2,952 (30%) of these travelers to be MMR-eligible. Of the MMR-eligible 
travelers in the South, 2,262 (77%) were not vaccinated with MMR, and the most common 
reason stated for nonvaccination was traveler refusal (1,432 travelers, 63%). In contrast, 
2,695 (17%) of the 15,477 travelers seen at the eight clinical sites in the Northeast were 
considered eligible for MMR vaccination, and only 751 (28%) were not vaccinated. Provider 
decision was the most common reason for failure to vaccinate an MMR-eligible traveler in 
the Northeast (391 travelers, 52%).
Discussion
Routine assessment of measles immunity and vaccination with MMR before international 
travel is an essential means to reduce measles importations into the United States (20, 21). 
We evaluated the clinical practice of MMR vaccination in GTEN, the largest consortium of 
clinical sites providing pretravel health care in the U.S. Providers concluded that 16% of 
adults traveling internationally needed MMR vaccination at the time of their pretravel health 
consultation, yet more than half (53%) of those individuals were not vaccinated at the 
pretravel encounter. Our findings underscore that strategies are needed to improve provider 
and traveler knowledge of measles as a travel-related illness and to increase pretravel uptake 
of the MMR vaccine. Improving vaccination rates is particularly important for communities 
with a higher percentage of nonimmune individuals, since there is a greater risk of 
transmission events following an index case in these settings (10, 22, 23).
Nonvaccination was most commonly due to traveler refusal of MMR, with lack of concern 
about measles cited as the most common reason. This is consistent with prior GTEN 
analyses of vaccine uptake at pretravel encounters (24). Although clinics in the GTEN 
consortium are not selected on the basis of vaccination coverage in specific communities, 
traveler refusal was particularly predominant in clinical sites in the South, suggesting 
geographic variability in the understanding of measles and the benefits of MMR vaccination 
(18). Travelers were also more likely to refuse MMR vaccination after evaluation at 
nonacademic centers than at academic centers; patients evaluated in the South were not more 
likely to be seen at a nonacademic center. These findings support that providers may benefit 
from additional training on how to discuss beliefs regarding measles vaccine and the realities 
of clinical illness with measles, which vaccine-hesitant patients often minimize (25, 26). 
Few travelers in this study expressed concerns about MMR vaccine safety or cost; providers

 should ask travelers explicitly about any safety or cost concerns, as travelers may not state 
them directly (27).
Our findings also indicate that providers might benefit from education regarding pretravel 
MMR vaccination. More than a quarter of all missed opportunities for vaccination were 
because the provider did not recommend the MMR vaccine to eligible travelers. Providers at 
nonacademic centers, in particular, were less likely to recommend MMR vaccination to 
eligible travelers. This observation is consistent with previous work indicating that providers 
deviate from ACIP and CDC recommendations for other travel-related vaccines (28, 29).
Health systems barriers played a role in 24% of missed opportunities for vaccination. In the 
majority of instances, providers referred travelers to another provider, likely a primary care 
provider, for MMR vaccination. Although some travelers may have obtained MMR 
vaccination from a primary care provider before departure, attrition after referral may have 
occurred in some travelers because an additional clinic visit is required. Referral to another 
provider could be an attempt to ensure that records of vaccinations stay with primary care 
providers, given that the Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are not in widespread use 
(30). Alternatively, providers could refer patients in an attempt to reduce costs for travelers 
because “travel-related” vaccinations are not uniformly covered by health insurance even if 
they are covered as part of routine care. Given the serious public health implications of 
undervaccination, strong consideration should be given to requiring insurers to cover MMR 
vaccination regardless of the site of delivery.
With more than 30 million U.S. residents traveling internationally by air every year (31), 
almost 5 million travelers could be at risk for measles infection when traveling abroad, if our 
study's findings apply to the overall population of U.S. travelers. MMR vaccination for 
nonimmune travelers could be a cost-effective strategy to reduce measles cases in the United 
States given the low cost of vaccination (32), the vaccine's two-dose effectiveness of 97% 
(6), and the low likelihood of vaccine-related adverse events (33), especially in the context 
of the morbidity and costs associated with measles infection (34-36), secondary cases caused 
by transmission (37, 38), and the expensive outbreak investigations required with any new 
case of measles in the United States (37, 38). Further evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of 
pretravel measles vaccination is warranted given the low probability of exposure during 
travel but high impact of any imported measles cases.
Our study has limitations. While GTEN is the largest consortium of clinics providing 
pretravel health care in the United States, clinical practice at GTEN sites may not be 
representative of all pretravel health consultations and GTEN patients may not be 
representative of all U.S. travelers. In particular, health-seeking behavior may be more 
common among travelers who pursue a pretravel consultation; our study population may 
therefore be more likely to be up-to-date on routine vaccines and to agree to recommended 
vaccines than the general population of international travelers. GTEN providers assessed 
measles immunity as it is commonly carried out in clinical practice, but their estimates may 
be imprecise. For instance, GTEN providers at times relied on immunization histories 
obtained by traveler recall and also allowed a history of measles illness and self-reported 
vaccination to be considered adequate evidence of measles immunity. This is more lenient 
Hyle et al.

 than current ACIP guidelines (4, 5), and overestimation of measles immunity may therefore 
have occurred. However, an overestimation of measles immunity would result in even more 
opportunities for MMR pretravel vaccination than our analysis suggests. Because our study 
provides data only regarding actions taken at GTEN sites, we were not able to report the 
percentage of travelers who were successfully vaccinated with MMR by another provider 
prior to travel.
In conclusion, our results indicate that measles immunity could be increased among U.S. 
international travelers. Increasing measles immunity in travelers should substantially reduce 
the risk of measles importation and, by extension, decrease the number of new measles cases 
seen due to transmission within the U.S. Strategies to improve traveler knowledge are 
essential to these efforts and should include materials specifically designed for travelers who 
express lack of concern about measles illness. Measles education strategies should also be 
targeted to providers and focus on geographic regions with low uptake of MMR vaccination 
for international travelers. Because MMR vaccination is recommended for all 
immunocompetent and non-pregnant U.S. international travelers, primary care providers 
could play an important role in efforts to improve measles immunity in travelers. For 
instance, primary care providers could routinely ask patients about upcoming travel plans 
and vaccinate those eligible for MMR. Further study of the role of primary care providers in 
improving measles population immunity is warranted. In light of recent measles outbreaks 
associated with travel, pretravel measles immunity screening for U.S. adults traveling 
internationally and MMR vaccination for those eligible should be prioritized.

 Figure 1. 
Assessment of adult travelers' measles immunity and action regarding MMR vaccination by 
providers at 24 GTEN sites (2009-2014).
Abbreviations: MMR, measles-mumps-rubella; GTEN, Global TravEpiNet; h/o, history of.
*At least one specific reason supporting measles immunity was documented for 28,107 
(82%) of these travelers (i.e., a history of two MMR vaccinations, a known positive 
serology, or a self-reported history of illness). Providers were able to select more than one 
supporting reason:1,017 (4%) travelers had 2 MMR vaccinations and a positive serology; 
220 (0.8%) travelers had 2 MMR vaccinations and a self-reported history of illness; and 53 
(0.2%) travelers had a positive serology and a self-reported history of illness.
†Of the 24,884 travelers for which providers noted two prior doses of MMR vaccine, 
providers noted specific supporting evidence (i.e. a date) for prior vaccinations in 11,326 
(46%).
‡Between 2009 and 2012, providers did not have to specify reason for traveler refusal.
§Between 2012 and 2014, providers had to select one of three reasons for traveler refusal.
