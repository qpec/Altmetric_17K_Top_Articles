 Biomarkers for Clinical Decision-Making in the
Management of Pulmonary Embolism
Evangelos Giannitsis1* and Hugo A. Katus1
BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated
with high all-cause and PE-related mortality and requires
individualized management. After confirmation of PE, a
refined risk stratification is particularly warranted among
normotensive patients. Previous prognostic models fa-
vored combinations of echocardiography or computed
tomography suggestive of right ventricular (RV) dysfunc-
tion together with biomarkers of RV dysfunction (natri-
uretic peptides) or myocardial injury (cardiac troponins)
to identify candidates for thrombolysis or embolectomy.
In contrast, current predictive models using clinical
scores such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index
(PESI) or its simplified version (sPESI) rather seek to
identify patients, not only those at higher risk requiring
observation for early detection of hemodynamic decom-
pensation, and the need for initiation of rescue reperfu-
sion therapy, but also those at low risk qualifying for early
discharge and outpatient treatment. Almost all predic-
tion models advocate the additional measurement of bio-
markers along with imaging of RV dysfunction as part of
a comprehensive algorithm.
CONTENT: The following mini-review will provide an up-
dated overview on the individual components of differ-
ent algorithms with a particular focus on guideline-
recommended and new, less-established biomarkers for
risk stratification, and how biomarkers should be imple-
mented and interpreted.
SUMMARY: Ideally, biomarkers should be part of a com-
prehensive risk stratification algorithm used together
with clinical risk scores as a basis, and/or imaging. For
this purpose, cardiac troponins, including high-
sensitivity troponin generations, natriuretic peptides,
and h-FABP (heart-type fatty acid–binding protein) are
currently recommended in guidelines. There is emerging
evidence for several novel biomarkers that require further
validation before being applied in clinical practice.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE)2 is a common disease
with a high fatality rate if not diagnosed early and not
treated appropriately. Every year around 300000 people
in the US die from acute PE, and the diagnosis is often
not established until autopsy (1).
Several biomarkers have been suggested for diagno-
sis and for risk stratification of PE (2, 3). However, the
qualification of these biomarkers for decision-making
and management cannot be understood without basic
knowledge of the pathophysiology of PE (2, 4, 5). A rel-
evant segmental or subsegmental obstruction of pulmo-
nary arteries results in an increase of right ventricular
(RV) afterload causing RV dysfunction and RV failure
resulting in low cardiac output that may be aggravated by
ventricular interdependence, where dilation of the right
ventricle shifts the interventricular septum toward the
left, changing left ventricular geometry (4, 5). Thus, pro-
gressive volume and pressure overload of the RV are be-
lieved to contribute significantly to the release of natri-
uretic peptides. Tissue hypoperfusion resulting from
hypoxemia may result in increased production of lactate
in combination with coronary hypoperfusion. These
events result from tissue oxygen supply-to-demand im-
balance caused by increased RV strain, coronary hypo-
perfusion, and systemic hypoxemia which may ulti-
mately lead to irreversible myocardial injury as signaled
by the release of cardiac troponins (2, 3, 5). Signs of RV
dysfunction may also translate acutely into deterioration
of renal function with subsequent increase of blood urea

Risk Stratification in Confirmed PE
without Biomarkers
In 2014, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) pro-
posed a set of guidelines for the evaluation and management
of PE (2) (see Fig. 1). These guidelines recommended the
initial stratification of patients into a high-risk group and
a non–high-risk group. The non–high-risk group was
further stratified into low-, intermediate–low-, and
intermediate–high-risk groups. In identifying the high-
risk group of patients who have hemodynamic compro-
mise, i.e., hypotension or shock—neither clinical scores
nor imaging for RV dysfunction or measurement of bio-
markers is recommended (Fig. 1) (2). Likewise, measure-
ment of biomarkers or imaging for RV dysfunction is not
obligatory for non–high-risk patients at low risk. If, how-
ever, biomarkers or imaging results are available, they still
should be considered as they contain prognostic informa-
tion. Either a positive biomarker or imaging test converts
low risk patients to intermediate–low-risk patients (2).
Because previous biomarker-based risk stratification
algorithms failed to detect individuals at intermediate
risk who would benefit from thrombolytic therapy (6),
novel clinical risk scores for prediction of 30-day mortal-
ity were developed and validated that contain easily ac-
cessible variables on age and comorbidities (7–11). These
clinical scores provide added value as they allow detection
of more patients at low risk qualifying for early discharge
and outpatient treatment, as well as identification of pa-
tients at intermediate-to-high risk requiring observation
for early detection of hemodynamic decompensation,
and the need for initiation of rescue reperfusion therapy
(7–11). The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index
(PESI) and simplified PESI (sPESI) are among the most
currently used and best validated clinical scores for pre-

 diction of 30-day mortality (8, 9). The PESI score com-
bines 11 differently weighted variables into a score, and
based on the point distribution, a score below 65 points is
being classified as PESI class I, 66–85 as class II, 86–105
as class III, 106–125 as class IV, and over 126 as class V.
PESI class I and II indicate patients at very low risk and
low risk, respectively. The PESI score was simplified to
reduce technical complexity of the original prediction
rule (9). The sPESI consists of 6 equally weighted vari-
ables (1 point each) including age �80 years, history of
cancer, history of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, heart
rate �110 bpm, systolic blood pressure �100 mmHg,
and arterial oxy-hemoglobin saturation �90% (9). Pa-
tients with none of these variables (0 points) are catego-
rized as low risk, and those with a score of � 1 are cate-
gorized as high risk.
PESI or sPESI have been incorporated into the 2014
ESC guidelines for management of acute PE (2). Accord-
ingly, risk assessment should begin with assessment of
hemodynamic stability as patients with massive PE do
not require further risk estimation (step I), followed by
calculation of a validated clinical prognostic score for
normotensive patients (step II), preferably the PESI (9)
or sPESI (10), its simplified version, to distinguish be-
tween intermediate and low risk (Fig. 1). Within the
intermediate-risk category (PESI �III or sPESI �1, fur-
ther risk assessment must consider imaging evidence of
RV dysfunction by echocardiography or computed to-
mographic (CT) angiography (step III). Biomarker test-
ing hereby complements prognostic information (step
III). Thus, patients with increased cardiac biomarker
concentrations, particularly a positive cardiac troponin
test, and imaging evidence of RV dysfunction should be
classified as an intermediate–high-risk category. These
patients require close monitoring over the first 2–3 days
to permit early detection of hemodynamic decompensa-
tion, and the need for initiation of rescue reperfusion
therapy (2). On the other hand, patients with a sPESI �
0 or PESI �III points might be candidates for early dis-
charge and home treatment.
Biomarkers for Risk Stratification in
Confirmed PE
GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED AND NOVEL BIOMARKERS
An overview on guideline-recommended and novel bio-
markers is provided in Table 1.
CARDIAC TROPONINS
Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a highly sensitive and spe-
cific marker of myocardial cell injury and is being used as
the preferable biomarker for the diagnosis of myocardial
infarction (MI). Increases in cTnT and cardiac troponin
I (cTnI) were also observed among patients with con-
firmed PE, irrespective of the presence or absence of cor-
onary artery disease (CAD) (3, 12, 13). Therefore, it was
hypothesized that release of cardiac troponin from myo-
cardium results from acute RV pressure overload, im-
paired coronary blood flow, and severe hypoxemia caused
by PE. In a trial summary (13), troponin increases were
associated with an odds ratio (OR) for mortality of 5.90
(95% CI 2.68–12.95). Consistently, prediction of
mortality and complications in normotensive patients
with PE is feasible using high-sensitivity troponin as-
says (14). Troponin assessment was shown to improve
the predictive value of echocardiography in PE and the
implementation of biomarkers into the echocardiography-
based
risk
assessment
strategies
is
well
established
(2, 3, 15, 16).
NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES
Brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a marker of ven-
tricular dysfunction. This hormone is released in re-
sponse to myocyte stretch. It is synthesized as an inactive
prohormone (proBNP) that is split into the active hor-
mone BNP and the inactive N-terminal fragment (NT-
proBNP) (17). Several prospective studies (3, 16, 18)
and metaanalyses (19) have demonstrated an association
between high concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP
and deterioration of clinical condition in patients with
acute PE. Several different cutoff concentrations for ad-
mission NT-proBNP (�500, �600, or �1000 ng/L)
have been proposed as predictive of better clinical courses
(18, 19). Similarly, 2 cutoff BNP values, �50 or �90
ng/L, have been suggested to identify low-risk patients;
high-risk patients have values �500 ng/L (3, 18). Re-
ported differences regarding cutoff values using the same
assay are presumably due to small sample sizes and
variation in patient characteristics. The use of echocardi-
ography in patients with high values is helpful for iden-
tification of a high-risk subset. Persistent increases in
NT-proBNP (values �7500 ng/L after 24 h or �50%
decrease) indicate RV dysfunction and a poor prognosis
(20), However, the positive predictive value of increased
natriuretic peptide concentrations is low because such
increases occur in a multitude of other conditions, in-
cluding preexisting left ventricular dysfunction, older
age, renal impairment, and chronic lung disease. Con-
versely, patients with normal concentrations of BNP or
NT-proBNP have low risks for death as well as for he-
modynamic deterioration resulting in any adverse events
(18, 19).
HEART-TYPE FATTY ACID BINDING PROTEIN
Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP) is a small
soluble nonenzyme protein composed of 132 amino ac-
ids and is one of the most abundant proteins in the heart
(21, 22). It is released in response to myocardial injury
and has been demonstrated to be both sensitive and spe-
cific in the detection of myocardial injury (21) Several

 studies and metaanalyses have conferred evidence of the
usefulness of h-FABP for prediction of adverse prognosis
in patients with acute PE (2, 3, 22, 23). ESC guidelines
(2) suggested that in normotensive patients, circulating
h-FABP levels �6 ng/mL (23) had a positive predictive
value of 28% and a negative predictive value of 99%.
NOVEL BIOMARKERS AND CONCEPTS
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a cytokine
induced in the heart after ischemia or pressure overload.
The prognostic value of GDF-15 has been investigated in
PE (24). In a prospective study on 123 patients, increased
GDF-15 emerged as an independent predictor of compli-
cated clinical course. GDF-15 added to the prognostic in-
formation provided by cTnT, NT-pro BNP, and echocar-
diographic findings of right ventricular dysfunction (24).
Midregional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) is
an important predictor of short-term mortality in acute
heart failure adding prognostic value to NT-proBNP
(25). So far, the prognostic usefulness of MR-proADM
has been investigated in a small study on 98 patients for
prediction of all-cause mortality (26).
Copeptin has been identified as a valuable bio-
marker for diagnosis and risk stratification in numerous
cardiovascular conditions. Owing to its fast release kinet-
ics (27), copeptin appears to be particularly useful for
prognostic assessment of acute diseases. In a prospective
trial on 268 normotensive PE patients (28), copeptin was

 integrated into a novel stepwise biomarker-based risk as-
sessment strategy. In the first step, high-sensitivity tro-
ponin T (hsTnT) �14 ng/L or NT-proBNP �600 ng/L
were used to identify low-risk patients. In a second step,
in patients with increased hsTnT and NT-proBNP, co-
peptin �24 pmol/L was used to identify 55 (20.6%)
patients at intermediate-high risk. The novel biomarker-
based strategy based on hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and co-
peptin classified more patients as low risk, none of whom
reached the primary outcome, and more patients in the
intermediate-high-risk group had an adverse outcome as
compared to the algorithm proposed by the 2014 ESC
guideline and the Bova score (28).
RENAL MARKERS
Kidney dysfunction has previously been observed in pa-
tients with acute PE and was found to be associated with
worse short-term outcomes. Preliminary evidence sug-
gests a potential prognostic role of serum neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C
(29).
Micro-RNA AND OTHER OMICS-BASED TECHNOLOGIES
Cell-free microRNAs are present in a range of body fluids
and have recently been shown to be useful biomarkers in
patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and acute
PE. In a small study on 38 patients who underwent or-
thopedic surgery, 20 patients had a DVT and 18 patients
without DVT served as controls. It was found that miR-
582, miR-195, and miR-532 were associated with excel-
lent performance to discriminate patients with DVT
from controls (30). In another report on PE patients,
miR-134 was found to distinguish PE patients from nor-
mal individuals (31). In another small study, increased
miR-28–3p was found to be associated with PE (32). In
another study in 30 patients with CT-angiographically
confirmed central PE, serum miRNA-1233 was identi-
fied as a specific biomarker for diagnosing acute PE, al-
lowing acute PE to be distinguished from NSTEMI and
from healthy controls (33).
Genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics, seem to be
powerful approaches in understanding pathophysiology
and searching for new diagnostic biomarkers of various
disorders. Metabolomics can provide a comprehensive
analysis of the whole metabolome. Today, there are
sparse and very preliminary data in PE. In an experimen-
tal pig model, HPLC-MS and capillary electrophoresis–
mass spectrometry for untargeted mass spectrometry-
based metabolic fingerprinting were used to compare the
plasma profiles before and after PE (34). Many of the
significantly changed metabolites in pig plasma after
acute PE were involved in the glycolysis and the tricar-
boxylic acid cycle, responsible for the production of en-
ergy and the creation of primary blocks of other metab-
olisms. In addition, abnormalities were found regarding
lipid metabolism (34).
The amount of omics-based information is still
small, as is the current role of omics-based diagnosis
and/or risk assessment.
Risk Stratification in Confirmed PE with
Biomarkers
BIOMARKER- AND IMAGING-BASED CONCEPTS
The presence of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury at
presentation has significant prognostic implications for
patients diagnosed with acute PE (2, 3, 5, 15, 16).
Therefore, various prognostic models have been pro-
posed for normotensive patients with acute PE. Most risk
prediction models that have been validated for assess-
ment of 30-day all-cause mortality or complications in-
clude algorithms that were advocated by 2008 ESC (15)
and are still being recommended by 2011 American
Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management
of acute PE (3). Most predictive models require measure-
ment of biomarkers of RV dysfunction and/or myocar-
dial injury. A recent review article nicely summarize the
clinical evidence supporting the combination of imaging
of RV dysfunction and guideline recommended bio-
markers (16). However, these prognostic models failed
to unequivocally identify patients with nonmassive PE
who might benefit from thrombolytic therapy without
bleeding.
Accordingly,
the
Pulmonary
Embolism
Thrombolysis (PEITHO) study (6) randomized 1005
normotensive patients with confirmed PE by the pres-
ence of imaging evidence of RV dysfunction and/or the
presence of increased cTnT or cTnI at prespecified cut-
offs, either to thrombolytic therapy with tenecteplase or
standard care. Patients were found to benefit from
thrombolytic therapy but at the cost of an excessive risk of
major bleeding (6). Accordingly, the novel concept of
risk stratification in confirmed PE aims to refine risk
stratification with a particular interest to further discrim-
inate an intermediate–high and an intermediate–low risk
cohort by the use of a 3-step approach that positions
calculation of clinical risk before measurement of bio-
marker or imaging (Fig. 1).
INTEGRATION OF BIOMARKERS AND CLINICAL SCORES
Current ESC guidelines (2) endorse stepwise integration
of clinical scores and biomarkers and imaging for RV
dysfunction, particularly for patients with an intermedi-
ate risk. Among patients at low risk (sPESI � 0 or low
PESI �III) measurement of biomarkers or imaging evi-
dence of RV dysfunction is optional and might be obvi-
ated as these tools may not be readily available in all
hospitals. However, if assessed and either test is positive,
a patients transits from low risk to intermediate–low risk.
There are several studies that have evaluated the additive

 or comparative value of biomarkers vs clinical scores. An
overview on studies is displayed in Table 2. Lankeit et al.
(39) studied a cohort of 526 patients with objectively
confirmed PE and compared sPESI and the ESC 2008
prognostic model. As compared to the ESC model, they
found no death within 30 days in low-risk patients based
on the sPESI. However, if accessible, imaging tests and
biomarkers should be obtained according to 2014 ESC
guidelines (2), even in PESI class I–II, or with sPESI of 0,
because increased cardiac biomarkers or signs of RV dys-
function on imaging tests classify patients from the low-
to the intermediate–low-risk category. Another argu-
ment favoring the latter recommendation is the finding
that addition of biomarkers and imaging to sPESI re-
duced rates of truly low risk patients from a prevalence of
31% (39) to 16.2–17.5% (28, 36). A summary of the
most relevant studies that tested and compared the pre-
dictive performance of different prognostic models, clin-
ical scores, and biomarkers is provided in Table 2.
Other prognostic models that require measurement
of biomarker include the h-FABP, syncope, and tachy-
cardia (FAST) score (10) that is based on a positive
h-FABP test that accounts for 1.5 points. Other compo-
nents comprise syncope (1.5 points) and tachycardia (2
points). A total score �3 points indicates low risk and a
score �3 points indicates intermediate–high risk.
The Bova score (11) includes increased cardiac tro-
ponin (2 points), RV dysfunction [2 points, transtho-
racic echocardiography (CT)], tachycardia with a heart
rate �110 beats/min (1 point), and systolic blood pres-
sure of 90–100 mmHg (2 points). A total of 0–2 points
indicates low risk, 3–4 points as intermediate–low, and
�4 points as intermediate–high risk.
Lankeit et al. (35) examined another 526 normoten-
sive patients with acute PE for the predictive perfor-
mance of hsTnT and sPESI. Both hsTnT �14 ng/L and
sPESI �1 points emerged as independent predictors of
early death or complications with an OR of 4.97 and
9.51-fold, respectively. Patients at low risk as suggested
by a sPESI of 0 and hsTnT �14 ng/L did not suffer any
adverse 30-day outcomes. Thus, the authors concluded
that a combination of both modalities may yield additive
prognostic information and, in particular, identify possi-
ble candidates for out-of-hospital treatment.
Lankeit et al. (37) studied the prognostic perfor-
mance of different NT-proBNP cutoff values in 688 nor-
motensive patients with PE. After adjustment, sPESI and
evidence of RV dysfunction on echocardiography had an
impact on primary outcome. Adding NT-proBNP �600
ng/L provided significant additional impact on top of the
sPESI and RV dysfunction on echocardiography.
Hobohm et al. (36) compared the prognostic per-
formance of sPESI compared to FAST and Bova scores.
As the FAST score requires measurement of h-FABP, a
biomarker of myocardial injury, which is not routinely
available in the majority of hospitals, h-FABP was re-
placed by hsTnT. In direct comparison, all scores per-
formed similarly among low-risk patients. The modified
FAST score was more suitable for identification of
intermediate–high-risk patients, yielding a 15.9-fold
higher risk.
Lauque et al. (23) tested the prognostic performance
of PESI, h-FABP, BNP, and TnI-UltraTM among 123
patients with confirmed PE. h-FABP and PESI gave best
prognostic performance for death within 30 days. The
combination of h-FABP with PESI was a particularly
useful prognostic indicator because none of the 79 pa-
tients (59.8%) with h-FABP �6 ng/mL and PESI
class � III had an adverse outcome.
Hellenkamp et al. (28) studied the prognostic poten-
tial of copeptin, the C-terminal fragment of the precursor
protein of vasopressin, among 268 normotensive PE pa-
tients included in a single-center cohort study. hsTnT and
NT-proBNP yielded an excellent negative predictive value
of 100% each. Accordingly, the biomarker-based strategy
performed better than the sPESI as more patients at low risk
for adverse outcome were identified (52.8% vs 17.5%, P
�0.0001.) Conversely, implementation of copeptin at a
cutoff �24 pmol/L improved identification of patients at
intermediate-high risk. More patients in the intermediate-
high-risk group based on this biomarker-based algorithm
had an adverse outcome as compared to the algorithm pro-
posed by the 2014 ESC guideline and the Bova score.
Finally, there is also evidence (41) that at least
among elderly, measurement of hsTnT or NT-pro BNP
is at least as effective as the PESI score regarding prog-
nostication. Vuilleumier et al. (41) evaluated a total of
230 patients aged �65 years with nonhigh-risk PE to
compare the prognostic accuracy of cardiac biomarkers in
the elderly compared to clinical scores. The authors
found that the accuracy of biomarkers was at least equiv-
alent to that of clinical scores and that the addition of
hs-cTnT to clinical scores improved the efficacy of cur-
rently used clinically based risk-stratification models.
CAVEATS WITH BIOMARKER-BASED ALGORITHMS
There are several concerns with biomarker testing that are
still under debate. First, optimal cutoff values for risk
stratification are unknown. The studies performed were
extremely heterogenous with respect to assay type and a
wide range of cutoffs even with the same BNP, NT-
proBNP, or cardiac troponin assay. In this context, it
should be highlighted that in hemodynamically stable
patients biomarkers of RV dysfunction or necrosis are
poor predictors of death when increased (low positive
predictive value) but consistently identify a benign clin-
ical course when normal or low. Second, there is no clear
recommendation on the timing of measurement as it
takes several hours for cardiac troponin or plasma natri-
uretic peptide concentrations to increase significantly af-

Primary end point of the study was all-cause
mortality; secondary end point included
all-cause mortality, nonfatal symptomatic
recurrent VTE, or nonfatal major bleeding.
All-cause mortality was 7.6%; sPESI
classified fewer patients as low risk than
ESC score (31% vs 39%); low-risk patients
based on the sPESI had no 30-day mortality
whereas low risk patients based on ESC
2008 score had 3.4% 30-day mortality.

 ter the onset of acute myocardial stretch (38, 40). Thus,
a very recent onset of complaints could result in false-
negative BNP or NT-proBNP test results. Still, admis-
sion cutoff concentrations of NT-proBNP �500, 600,
or 1000 ng/L, have been seen to perform reasonably (3).
However, serial measurement may represent an option in
individual cases as persistent increases of NT-proBNP
(values �7500 ng/L after 24 h or �50% decrease) indi-
cate right ventricular dysfunction and a poor prognosis
(20).
Third, biomarkers of RV dysfunction remain inde-
pendent predictors of adverse events after adjustment for
potential confounders including renal function (41).
Nevertheless, in clinical practice, renal failure, older age,
critical illness, and other comorbidities increase bio-
marker concentrations and ultimately confound inter-
pretation of biomarkers. This concern highlights the
recommendation to integrate biomarkers into a compre-
hensive prediction model rather than interpret biomark-
ers in isolation. Finally, there is no recommendation on
how to grade prognosis if biomarkers give divergent in-
formation. Although hsTnT and NT-proBNP represent
the best validated biomarkers, the fact that optimal cutoff
values for NT-proBNP remain unclear makes measure-
ment of hsTnT that has been validated at the established
99th percentile cutoff more relevant (6, 14, 35).
Future Perspective and Ongoing Trial(s)
Risk stratification algorithms have been refined and sim-
plified, and treatment of PE with new oral anticoagulants
(NOAKs) represents a convenient, effective, and safe
therapeutic alternative to coumadin, thus opening a new
avenue for early discharge and home treatment in low risk
patients. It appears that the combination of a validated
clinical score with a high-sensitivity troponin assay (40)
might offer the highest degree of safety in identifying
possible candidates for early discharge and home treat-
ment. However, there is lack of solid evidence and con-
sensus on the appropriate selection criteria for outpatient
treatment, and on the optimal antithrombotic agent and
regimen to be followed. Whether early discharge and
out-of-hospital treatment of patients with low-risk acute
PE with the new oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is
feasible, effective and safe is currently being tested pro-
spectively in the ongoing multicenter Home Treatment
of Pulmonary Embolism (HoT-PE) trial.
There are still many remaining gaps in evidence such
as early discharge and home treatment in special popula-
tions such as cancer patients, elderly, or patients with
renal failure, particularly when considering treatment
with a NOAK. In addition, sparse data are available on
estimation of bleeding risk using more specific and vali-
dated scores in PE. In this context, new biomarkers in-
cluding omics-based biomarkers that not only address
risk of death but also other complications and risk of
major bleedings might improve decision-making and
management of patients with PE in the future.
