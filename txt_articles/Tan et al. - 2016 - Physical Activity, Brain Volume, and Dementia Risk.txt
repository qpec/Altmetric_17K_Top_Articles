Abstract
Background: Several longitudinal studies found an inverse relationship between levels of physical activity and cognitive decline, dementia, 
and/or Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but results have been inconsistent. We followed an older, community-based cohort for over a decade to 
examine the association of physical activity with the risk of incident dementia and subclinical brain MRI markers of dementia.
Methods: The physical activity index (PAI) was assessed in the Framingham Study Original and Offspring cohorts, aged 60 years or older. We 
examined the association between PAI and risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD in participants of both cohorts who were cognitively 
intact and had available PAI (n = 3,714; 54% women; mean age = 70 
± 
7 years). We additionally examined the association between PAI and 
brain MRI in the Offspring cohort (n = 1,987).
Results: Over a decade of follow-up, 236 participants developed dementia (188 AD). Participants in the lowest quintile of PAI had an increased 
risk of incident dementia compared with those in higher quintiles (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.97, 
p = .028) in a multivariable-adjusted model. Secondary analysis revealed that this relation was limited to participants who were apolipoprotein 
(APO)E ε4 allele noncarriers (HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08–2.32; p = .018) and strongest in participants aged 75 years or older. PAI was also 
linearly related to total brain and hippocampal volumes (β ± SE = 0.24 
± 
0.06; p < .01 and 0.004 
± 
0.001; p = .003, respectively).
Conclusion: Low physical activity is associated with a higher risk for dementia in older individuals, suggesting that a reduced risk of dementia 
and higher brain volumes may be additional health benefits of maintaining physical activity into old age.

In the Framingham Heart Study, low levels of physical activity have 
been associated with greater incidence of ischemic heart disease in 
men (1). Additionally, level of physical activity has been shown to 
have an inverse relationship with the incidence of stroke, peripheral 
vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. Several longitudinal 
epidemiological studies have also related physical activity to cog-
nitive decline, dementia, and/or Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with the 
majority (2–4) demonstrating a significant and independent inverse 
relationship between physical activity and cognitive decline and/
or risk of dementia. However, several other studies (5–7) failed to 
show an association, possibly due to insufficient length of follow-up, 
significant loss to follow-up, or inadequate physical activity assess-
ment, such as neglecting to assess for a possible nonlinear relation-
ship, between physical activity and dementia. Thus, studies with a 
longer-term follow-up in older persons are warranted to elucidate 
the true relationship.

 In the Framingham Original and Offspring cohorts, physical 
activity was measured using the physical activity index (PAI). We 
examined the relationship between PAI and the risk of incident 
dementia over a decade of follow-up in both cohorts and identi-
fied associations among PAI and subclinical brain MRI markers of 
dementia in the Offspring cohort.
Methods
Study Population
The Framingham Study Original cohort is a longitudinal commu-
nity-based sample evaluated biennially since 1948 for cardiovascu-
lar risk factors (8). The Framingham Offspring cohort comprises 
the Offspring of the Original participants or spouses of the 
Offspring who were enrolled in 1971–1975 and has been examined 
eight times over the past 40 years, approximately once every 4 to 
8 years. Participants who attended one of the three baseline exami-
nations—the Original cohort 20th cycle examination (1986–1987), 
the Offspring 4th (1988–1992), or Offspring 7th (1998–2001) 
cycle examination—were pooled. Participants eligible for the pre-
sent investigation were dementia free and aged at least 60 years at 
the baseline examination and had available physical activity data 
(n = 3,714; 54% women; mean age = 70 ± 7 years). All participants 
were followed prospectively for the development of incident demen-
tia and AD for up to 10 years.
Physical Activity Index
Physical activity was assessed in the Original Framingham Heart 
Study cohort at the 20th examination cycle and at the 4th and 7th 
examination cycles in the Framingham Offspring cohort. The PAI 
was a composite score constructed for each participant by weighting 
each hour in their typical day based on the their activity level (based 
on oxygen consumption or metabolic equivalents) and summing up 
these weighted hours over a 24-hour period. Participants were asked 
to report the number of hours in a typical day spent sleeping (weight-
ing factor [WF] = 1) and in sedentary (WF = 1.1), slight (WF = 1.5), 
moderate (WF = 2.4), and heavy activities (WF = 5) (9). Thus, based 
on a history of usual activity elicited by the examiner from each 
participant, a person who sleeps continually would receive a score 
of 24, an office worker with no outside exercise a 27, and a laborer 
involved in heavy physical activity a score of 42. In addition to the 
PAI, sedentary time/day and moderate + heavy time/day were used as 
independent variables. Validity of these variables, by correlation of 
comparable physical activity questionnaires to accelerometer-deter-
mined physical activity measures, has only been fair (0.3–0.4), but it 
has been suggested that this correlation may be as high a validity as 
can be expected from a short physical activity questionnaire (10,11). 
PAI scores, sedentary time and moderate + heavy time were divided 
into sex-specific quintiles, from low (Q1) to highest (Q5), with Q1 
as the referent for PAI and moderate + heavy time and Q5 as the 
referent for sedentary time.
Outcomes
Dementia
Methods used for dementia screening and follow-up have been pre-
viously described (12). For this study, we followed the study popu-
lation for the development of incident dementia over a period of 
10 years from the baseline examination. We used data from the 
neurologist’s examination, neuropsychological test performance, 
Framingham study records, hospital records, information from 
primary care physicians, family interviews, CT and MRI records, 
and autopsy confirmation when available. All participants identified 
to have dementia satisfied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria, had dementia severity equiva-
lent to a Clinical Dementia Rating of one or greater, and had symp-
toms of dementia for a period of at least 6 months. All participants 
identified as having Alzheimer’s dementia met the National Institute 
of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (13) criteria 
for definite, probable, or possible AD.
Brain imaging measures
2,063 Offspring participants who attended Examination Cyle 
7 and have available PAI also agreed to have a brain MRI scan 
from 1999 to 2005. MRI acquisition, measurement techniques, 
and interrater reliability have previously been described (14). MRI 
measures assessed total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) and hip-
pocampal volume (HPV). To further explore the potential link 
between physical activity and subclinical markers for dementia, we 
related PAI to TCBV and HPV in 1987 participants (after exclud-
ing 76 participants with prevalent stroke, dementia, or other neu-
rological conditions). TCBV was determined by manual outlining 
in coronal images of the intracranial vault above the tentorium to 
determine the total cranial volume as a function of head size. Once 
the skull and other nonbrain tissues were removed from the image, 
mathematical modeling was performed to determine total paren-
chymal brain volume above the tentorium (cerebral). HPV was 
defined by the operator using manually traced boundaries. Both 
TCBV and HPV were calculated as ratios over total intracranial 
volume. Supplementary Figure 1 provides an overview of the tim-
ing of physical activity data collection and follow-up for dementia 
and brain imaging.
Statistical Analyses
We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relations 
of PAI, sedentary time, and moderate + heavy time (as a continuous 
variable and sex-specific quintiles) assessed at the baseline examina-
tion to the risk of incident AD and all-cause dementia over a follow-
up of up to 10 years (time scale in years from baseline) in tables and 
figures. Participants who developed dementia were followed to the 
date of diagnosis of dementia; those who did not were censored at 
10 years, or at the date last known not to be demented if less than 
10 years after baseline. We used interactions with time to test for 
proportional hazards. We explored this potential relationship fur-
ther by determining the risk of incident AD and all-cause dementia 
in participants who were in the lowest quintile (Q1) of reported PAI 
versus higher quintiles (Q2–Q5). The decision to treat physical activ-
ity variables as continuous and in quintiles was determined a priori 
due to previous suggestion of potential nonlinear relationships of 
physical activity to dementia risk (15). All analyses were adjusted 
for age and sex, and then additionally for apolipoprotein (APO)Eε4 
allele status, plasma homocysteine, diabetes, and prevalent cardio-
vascular disease including stroke. The potential competing risk of 
death in these relations was also assessed, using methods described 
by Fine and Gray (16). Furthermore, to determine whether PAI 
affects longer-term dementia risk, we performed Cox proportional 
hazards models with the methods described earlier to test the rela-
tion of baseline PAI to dementia and AD at 22 years of follow-up in 
the Original cohort.
In the 10-year follow-up analyses, we tested for interactions by 
APOEε4 and age. However, given that in the Cardiovascular Health

(AGES) studies the relationship between physical activity and risk of 
dementia was observed only in APOEε4 noncarriers (17,18), while 
the CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Incidence of 
Dementia) Study found an inverse relationship between physical 
activity and cognitive decline primarily in APOEε4 carriers (3), we 
decided a priori to construct separate models for ε4 carriers and 
noncarriers. We also decided a priori to perform analyses stratified 
by age (<75 years vs 75+ years).
We investigated the association of PAI, sedentary time, and 
moderate + heavy time with brain MRI measures using the same 
forms of PAI (continuous, quintiles, and Q1 vs Q2–Q5). The pri-
mary model was adjusted for age, sex, and the time between PAI 
measure and MRI. Secondary analyses additionally adjusted for 
systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, smoking, 
history of atrial fibrillation, prevalent diabetes, and prevalent car-
diovascular disease, including stroke. We chose the age- and sex-
adjusted model as the primary analysis because we wished to assess 
whether any observed association was partly mediated through 
vascular risk factors. All analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in 
Table 1. After up to 10 years of follow-up (mean 7.5 ± 2.7 years), 
236 participants developed dementia (188 developed AD). We 
found that although PAI was not linearly related to either all-cause 
dementia or AD, there was a threshold effect such that partici-
pants in the lowest quintile (Q1) of PAI had an increased risk of 
incident dementia compared with those in higher quintiles (haz-
ard ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.12–2.01, p = .006; 
Table 2), visually represented in Figure 1. Additional adjustment 
for APOEε4 status and multivariable adjustment did not change 
this relationship. Similar results were observed when analyses were 
limited to incident AD alone (Figure 2), except additional adjust-
ment for APOEε4 allele status and multivariable adjustment made 
the relation nonsignificant (Table 3). Additional analysis assessing 
the competing risks of death (using methods described by Fine and 
Gray (16)) yielded similar results to those demonstrated in Tables 
2 and 3 (data not shown). In contrast, in a longer follow-up period 
of up to 22 years in the Original cohort (n = 1,104, a subsample 
of our study population), the relations of baseline physical activity 
to dementia or AD were not significant (Supplementary Tables 1 
and 2).
Stratified analyses (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) showed that the 
relationship between physical activity and incident dementia risk 
was limited to participants who were non-APOEε4 allele carriers 
and to participants who were 75 years or older. Interactions by age 
and APOEε4 status were not significant (data not shown). Analysis 
testing components of the PAI (sedentary time and moderate + heavy 
time) revealed no significant relations to dementia in multivariable 
models (Supplementary Table 5).
On brain MRI measures, we found that PAI was linearly related to 
total cerebral brain and hippocampal volumes (β ± SE = 0.24 
± 
0.06; 
p < .001 and β ± SE = 0.004 
± 
0.001; p = .003, respectively). These 
relationships remained statistically significant in the multivariate 
model (Table 4).
Discussion
Many longitudinal epidemiological studies have analyzed the pos-
sible relationship between physical activity and cognitive decline, 
dementia, and/or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with varying results 
(19), hinging on a variety of factors: study design (eg, follow-
up time), differences in cohort demographics, adjustment for 
confounders, and assessment of physical activity. The largest of 
the positive studies was performed in the Nurses Health Study 
cohort, wherein women in the highest quintile of physical activ-
ity were 20% less likely to show cognitive decline over a decade 
later, compared with the lowest quintile (2). Larson and colleagues 
found that older persons who participated in a minimal amount of 
aerobic physical activity (lasting only 45 minutes per week) had a 
decreased risk of dementia compared with those who were more 
sedentary (4). Recently, the Rotterdam Study reported an associa-
tion between higher levels of physical activity and lower risk of 
dementia when follow-up was confined to up to 4 years, but no 
such association with longer follow-up (20). On the other hand a 
two-decade follow-up study, the CAIDE Study, found that partici-
pation in leisure-time physical activity for 20–30 minutes at least 
twice a week was associated with a reduced risk of dementia and 
AD (3). But not all studies that looked at this potential relation-
ship have yielded positive results (5–7).
In the Bronx Aging Study, participation in leisure cognitive activi-
ties was found to be associated with a decreased risk of dementia over 
two decades while physical activity was not (when examined over-
all or dichotomized as low or high physical activity) (5). Similarly, 
Yamada and colleagues found that a self-assessment of physical activ-
ity (as a continuous variable) was not associated with the risk for 
AD and vascular dementia in older individuals (6). In the Religious 
Orders Study, an estimate of hours per week spent doing physical 
activities was not associated with incident AD or decline in cognitive 
function after 4 years of follow-up, despite a similar analytic design 
to the one employed in the current study where physical activity was 
divided into quartiles (7). Thus, although the preponderance of epi-
demiological evidence supports the link between physical activity and 
cognitive decline/dementia risk (15), further studies are needed to elu-
cidate this relationship.
In the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of ischemic heart 
disease in men had a statistically significant negative association 
with level of physical activity (1). Additionally, a trend toward an 
inverse relationship between physical activity and the incidence

has been observed, although the associations did not reach statis-
tical significance. In the present investigation, participants in the 
pooled Framingham Original and Offspring cohorts (mean age of 
70 
± 
7 years) who had lower levels of physical activity had a higher 
incidence of dementia and AD. We observed that this association 
was significant even after a follow-up of up to a decade, making 
reverse causality an unlikely explanation for the observed relation-
ship. However, in follow-up longer than a decade (up to 22 years), 
only available in a subsample of our study population, the relations 
of baseline physical activity to dementia or AD were not significant 
and the effect sizes were attenuated. This observation was consist-
ent with a recent systematic review suggesting a weaker protective 
effect of physical activity in studies with follow-up time longer than 
a decade (15).
In the 10-year follow-up analyses, our reported protective 
effect appeared strongest for the difference between the lowest 
physical activity group (Q1) and the more active participants 
(Q2–Q5). We interpret this to mean that even a modest amount of 
physical activity may be protective against dementia. Furthermore, 
our sensitivity analysis did not reveal a significant relation of 
self-reported sedentary or moderate + heavy time to dementia, 
suggesting that the association between PAI and dementia must be 
driven by a balance of all types of activities, not just single com-
ponents of higher intensity activities. These data add to a growing 
body of literature identifying the importance of light activity for 
favorable health outcomes (21).
Another important aspect of the relation of low physical activity 
to higher dementia risk is that it has been suggested to be curvi-
linear with diminishing returns at higher levels of physical activity 
(15), which may explain why some studies (including the current 
study) did not report significant associations when physical activity 
is assessed as a continuous or dichotomous variable. The sugges-
tion of diminishing returns with greater amounts of physical activity 
is also consistent with findings from two studies with follow-up of 
more than 20 years (3,18). Therefore, it is necessary for future stud-
ies to stratify by level of physical activity, or use nonlinear modeling, 
to accurately assess this relationship.
We found a linear association between physical activity lev-
els and total cerebral and hippocampal brain volume, supporting 
reported relations of physical activity with brain volume in other 
cohorts (22). Our findings suggest it is the highest physical activity

 group driving the protective effect on total brain and hippocampal 
volumes. Our results are in agreement with a previous exercise inter-
vention study (walking 2 hours per week) that was shown to prevent 
hippocampal atrophy in older adults (23). More research is neces-
sary to understand the intensity and duration of physical activity 
necessary to slow the brain morphological changes that occur with 
age, but it is becoming clearer that a relation between physical activ-
ity and brain aging exists.
There are several theories to explain the pathophysiologic 
mechanisms underlying the relations observed between physical 
activity and brain aging or dementia. One possible mechanism is 
through exercise-induced increase in brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor, which may result in growth of new brain capillaries, 
increase in length and number of dendritic interconnections, and 
increase in hippocampal cell production (24,25). These structural 
changes from chronotropic aerobic activity observed in animal 
studies may explain our finding of a linear relationship between 
PAI and total cerebral and hippocampal brain volumes. It is pos-
sible that in addition, there are other mechanisms for the rela-
tionship between physical activity and dementia that may not 
be mediated by structural changes. These alternate mechanisms 
include exercise-induced alternations in oxidants/antioxidant sys-
tems (26) and the adrenergic system (27), which may not translate 
to structural brain changes.
Given the known beneficial effects of physical activity on over-
all cardiovascular health, several studies have likewise implicated 
vascular mechanisms, including increase in cerebral capillary den-
sity (28) and augmentation of cerebral blood flow by exercise. The 
brain is a highly metabolic organ that accounts for 20% of the 
oxygen and 25% of the glucose consumed even though it is only 
2% of body weight (29), which makes it particularly vulnerable to 
alternations in blood flow. Resting cerebral blood flow has been 
shown to decline in normal healthy aging (30), whereas people 
older than 65 years who continued to work or elected to partici-
pate in regular physical activities maintained their cerebral blood 
flow for 3 years (31).
The limitation of the relationship between physical activity 
and dementia/AD in the present investigation only to noncarri-
ers of the APOEε4 allele is consistent with observations in the 
Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study (17) and the AGES Study 
(18). Previous studies have shown that APOEε4 carriers do not 
derive the same blood pressure and lipid benefits from physical 
activity as noncarriers (32,33). APOEε4 being an established risk 
factor for dementia, this finding suggests that any beneficial effect 
of physical activity on cognition may not be sufficient to miti-
gate the effect of APOEε4 on dementia risk. However, the CAIDE 
Study reported a relation between physical activity and dementia 
only in APOEε4 allele carriers (3), and others have found no inter-
action between physical activity and the APOEε4 allele as they 
relate to dementia risk (34–36). Differences in cohort demograph-
ics or study design, previously discussed, may explain these incon-
sistent findings. One source of limitation in comparing our results 
to results of other observational studies is the ages of participants

Downloaded from 
 at physical activity assessment and follow-up for dementia. Our 
identification of a stronger relationship between physical activity 
and incident dementia in participants who were aged 75 years or 
older demonstrates the beneficial effects of physical activity espe-
cially in older persons.
The study’s strengths include the prospective design, the long 
follow-up period, the older mean age of the study population, 
and the availability of structural brain MRI measures. We also 
found no measurable effects of the competing risk of death in the 
observed relation of higher physical activity to lower dementia 
risk However, our study also has several limitations, including 
the primarily European American cohort that may limit gener-
alizability to larger, more ethnically diverse samples. Also, there 
is potential measurement error inherent in self-reported physical 
activity used in this study; however, given that random meas-
urement error tends to bias toward null results, we have reason 
to speculate that the relationships described in this study may 
actually be stronger than we reported. The results are consistent 
with the majority of studies published thus far and add to the 
weight of the evidence linking physical activity and dementia risk 
in older persons.
