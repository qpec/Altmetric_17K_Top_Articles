Abstract
Intraindividual variability of reaction time (IIVRT), a proposed cognitive marker of neurobio-
logical disturbance, increases in old age, and has been associated with dementia and mor-
tality. The extent to which IIVRT is an independent predictor of mortality, however, is unclear.
This study investigated the association of IIVRT and all-cause mortality while accounting for
cognitive level, incident dementia and biomedical risk factors in 861 participants aged 70–
90 from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study. Participants completed two computerised
reaction time (RT) tasks (76 trials in total) at baseline, and comprehensive medical and
neuropsychological assessments every 2 years. Composite RT measures were derived
from the two tasks—the mean RT and the IIVRT measure computed from the intraindividual
standard deviation of the RTs (with age and time-on-task effects partialled out). Consensus
dementia diagnoses were made by an expert panel of clinicians using clinical criteria, and
mortality data were obtained from a state registry. Cox proportional hazards models esti-
mated the association of IIVRT and mean RT with survival time over 8 years during which
191 (22.2%) participants died. Greater IIVRT but not mean RT significantly predicted survival
time after adjusting for age, sex, global cognition score, cardiovascular risk index and apoli-
poprotein ε4 status. After excluding incident dementia cases, the association of IIVRT with
mortality changed very little. Our findings suggest that greater IIVRT uniquely predicts
shorter time to death and that lower global cognition and prodromal dementia in older indi-
viduals do not explain this relationship.
Introduction
In addition to average performance level, there is an increasing focus in ageing research on
intraindividual variability or inconsistency in cognitive performance. Such variability in per-
formance is often measured by the trial-to-trial within-person variation in reaction times (RT)

 on a single cognitive task and is known as intraindividual reaction time variability (IIVRT).
IIVRT has received considerable attention as a useful indicator of neurobiological disturbance
[1]. Consistent with this, several studies indicate that IIVRT is greater in older age [2] and in a
variety of neuropathological conditions of old age including mild cognitive impairment [3],
dementia [4] and Parkinson’s disease [5]. Additionally, associations have been found with
measures of brain integrity, including white matter hyperintensities [6], brain connectivity [7],
and dopaminergic neuromodulation [8].
Our present interest is whether this measure can predict mortality in old age. It is possible
that neurobiogical changes that are related to eventual mortality are captured by variability
measures and are present many years in advance. A few studies have reported that increased
variability predicts mortality up to 19 years before eventual death in older populations [9–11]
but it is unknown whether this association is independent of general age-related cognitive
decline, an established risk factor for mortality [12, 13]. Moreover, the potential influence of
incipient dementia on this relationship [14] has not been addressed adequately in previous
studies that have used unreliable means of case identification (e.g., ‘questionable dementia’
written on death certificates [9], dementia screening measures with low sensitivity [10], or
have not attempted to remove dementia cases [11]). There is preliminary support for the rela-
tive importance of IIVRT as a predictor of mortality over the more basic measure of mean RT
from the same cognitive task [9, 10] and this is worthy of further investigation particularly in
the context of the potential influence of global cognitive level and prodromal dementia on
these relationships.
Hence, IIVRT warrants investigation as a specific predictor of impending death in older age
independently of global cognitive level, other mortality risk factors and speed (mean RT from
the same task) and prodromal dementia using robust clinical diagnoses in the years before
death. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of IIVRT with mortal-
ity over 8 years in a large, well-characterised population-based cohort of older adults aged 70
years and over, taking into account general cognitive function as assessed by a battery of psy-
chometric tests, other mortality risk factors including demographics, cardiovascular risk and
apolioprotein ε4 status, and dementia diagnosis based on DSM-IV [15].
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants were drawn from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS), a longitudinal
study of community dwelling older adults recruited through the Australian electoral roll, aged
70 to 90 years at baseline [16]. Wave 1 MAS participants were recruited from September 2005
to November 2007. Exclusionary criteria were as follows: Mini-Mental State Score (MMSE) �
24 [17] adjusted for age and education [18], or baseline diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, developmental disability, and pro-
gressive malignancy. Of the remaining 1037 participants at baseline, we excluded 164 partici-
pants of non-English speaking background because validity of cognitive test performance for
this group is questionable [19, 20], and 12 participants without RT data, leaving 861 for the the
study sample. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the Uni-
versity of New South Wales and South East Sydney and Illawarra Area Health Service. Partici-
pants gave written informed consent.
Reaction time measures
Simple and complex RT tasks were administered at baseline on a touch screen computer with
millisecond accuracy [21]. For the simple RT task, participants had to touch a yellow square as

 quickly as possible, presented at 1, 2 or 4 second interstimulus intervals over a total of 36 trials
over 2 blocks. For the complex RT, two coloured squares appeared vertically (red-red, yellow-
yellow, red-yellow, yellow-red) at 3-second interstimulus intervals over a total of 40 trials over
2 blocks. Participants had to touch the upper square if the squares were the same colour or the
lower square if the squares were different in colour. Practice trials prior to testing ensured that
participants achieved four consecutive correct trials before they were allowed to continue. Pro-
cessing of RT data and computation of metrics followed established procedures [21, 22]. For
the IIVRT measure, intraindividual standard deviation (SD) of RTs were computed using a
regression procedure that partialled out effects of time-on-task (trial order) and age (and their
interaction) from the individual RTs. The residuals obtained were then standardised and con-
verted into T-scores, and finally an estimate of each individual’s standard deviation across the
trials was computed. Mean RT was also computed. To obtain the most reliable estimates, lin-
ear-weighted composite scores for mean RT and IIVRT were computed from the two RT tasks
(Simple and Complex).
Clinical and cognitive measures
Comprehensive assessments consisting of medical history, medical examination, neuropsy-
chological measures and informant interviews were conducted by trained research psycho-
logists at two-yearly intervals. Participants completed a battery of 10 psychometric tests
measuring five major cognitive domains: attention/processing speed (Digit Symbol-Coding
[23], Trail Making Test A[24]), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test[24], Logical
Memory[25], Benton Visual Retention Test[26]), language (Boston Naming Test[27], Cate-
gory Fluency Test[24]), visuospatial (Block Design[28]) and executive abilities (Trail Making
Test B[24], Letter Fluency Test[24]), details of which have been previously published [16, 19].
Participants received the neuropsychological battery at each wave they were present (ranging
from 1–4 occasions) unless they were deemed too cognitively impaired (from wave 2 onward)
in which case they were administered the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised
[29].
Wave 1 neuropsychological test data were used in the analyses. Raw scores were trans-
formed to z-scores using baseline means and SDs of a subgroup of cognitively normal individ-
uals. A global cognition score was calculated by averaging z-scores and transforming this so
that the normal subgroup mean equals 0 and SD equals 1 (a higher score represents better per-
formance). This cognitive composite score was used as a covariate in analyses to control for
the known association of cognitive level with mortality [12]. The MMSE [17] and the National
Adult Reading Test-Revised [30] were administered to measure current cognitive level and
premorbid cognitive level respectively.
Other covariates previously linked to mortality included apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE ε4) status
[31] and cardiovascular disease risk [32], as well as age and sex. ApoE genotyping was obtained
from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood or saliva [33] and ε4 carriers were com-
pared to non-carriers (one or two ε4 alleles versus none). A cardiovascular disease risk score
based on the Framingham Study [34] was derived from age, current smoking status, diabetic
status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, high density lipoprotein level, and current
hypertensive medication.
Dementia and vital status ascertainment
At each study wave, cases were reviewed at case conference to reach a consensus on dementia
diagnosis by a minimum of three clinicians from an expert multidisciplinary panel comprising
of old age psychiatrists, neuropsychiatrists and clinical neuropsychologists. Dementia was

 diagnosed using DSM-IVcriteria [15] using all available clinical information, neuropsychologi-
cal scores, and MRI when available (approximately half the sample) [16]. Vital status of partici-
pants, and cause and date of death were obtained from the New South Wales Registry of
Births, Deaths and Marriages for 8 years after the study commenced.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0. Baseline characteristics for deceased
and surviving participants were compared using Chi-square for categorical variables, and
Student’s t-test for continuous variables with the exception of the RT measures which were
assessed using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney) as these variables were skewed. Bivariate
correlations were assessed using Pearson’s correlations or Spearman’s for correlations between
RT measures and other variables. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine the
effects of baseline mean RT and IIVRT on hazard rates of all-cause mortality. Time to event
was computed as the number of years and months between each individual’s baseline assess-
ment and a) date of death for decedents or b) the last assessment date for which surviving par-
ticipants were known to be alive up to the end of the study period (July 2014). All survivors
were included in the Cox analyses as right-censored. Mean RT and IIVRT measures were trans-
formed to z scores. Each RT measure was entered into separate models. The models were esti-
mated without covariates (Model 1), then with covariates (e.g., age, sex, global cognition score,
cardiovascular disease index, ApoE ε4 status) (Model2) and finally, a backward regression pro-
cedure was used with both RT measures included and all covariates to determine the best pre-
dictors of mortality (Model 3). All analyses were repeated after excluding incident dementia
cases diagnosed over the 8-year period along with additional cases where dementia was listed
as a cause of death on the Death Certificate.
Results
Sample baseline characteristics based on vital status are shown in Table 1. Of 861 participants,
191 died (22.2%) within 8 years of follow-up with a mean survival time of 4.3 years (SD = 2.2).

 Decedants had significantly slower mean RT and greater IIVRT, lower general cognitive ability
and a higher CVD risk score, and were older and more likely to be male than those who sur-
vived. Table 2 displays bivariate correlations between the main variables.
In unadjusted Cox models, greater IIVRT and slower mean RT were both individually asso-
ciated with all-cause mortality (Table 3. Model 1: IIVRT left side; Mean RT right side). The
effect sizes were comparable for the two measures; the hazard was raised by approximately
35% for a 1 SD increase in variability or mean RT. However, in separate multivariable Cox
regression models adjusting for global cognition and the other covariates (i.e., age, sex, APOE
ε4 status, cardiovascular risk score), IIVRT remained significant but mean RT did not reach
significance (Table 3. Model 2: IIVRT left side; Mean RT right side). When both measures were
entered together in a basic regression model adjusted for age and sex, the effects were consid-
erably attenuated (mean RT: Wald = 1.58 HR = 1.12 (95%CI: .94–1.31) p = .21; IIVRT: Wald =
1.42 HR = 1.15 (95%CI: .91–1.44) p = .23), indicating that the respective variables did not
contribute uniquely above the other. A similar result was obtained when the remaining covari-
ates were included in the model. This was not unexpected given the strong correlation of .67
between the two measures (see Table 2). To determine the best set of independent predictors,
backward elimination was used from the fully adjusted model, with IIVRT, mean RT and all
covariates entered at the first step (Table 3: Model 3). In this final model, IIVRT, age, sex and
cognition were retained as the most parsimonious set of predictors of all-cause mortality, not-
ing that cognition was not a significant independent predictor in the model.
Next, in order to account for the potential effects of dementia pathology on the associations
of RT measures and mortality, we evaluated the determinants of survival in persons free of demen-
tia. Over the 8-year study period, 82 individuals from our initial cohort of dementia-free elders,
received a consensus diagnosis of dementia from the expert panel. Three further participants with
evidence of cognitive impairment while in the study and dementia listed as the cause of death on
death certificates were also classified as incident dementia cases. Altogether 29 of 191 of decedents
(15.2%) had a dementia diagnosis. Separate multivariable Cox regression analyses were repeated
after removing these 85 participants with incident dementia from the baseline cohort (N = 708;
144 deceased). The predictive strengths of the RT measures were virtually unchanged though
neither attained conventional significance level after accounting for all risk factors (mean RT:
Wald = 2.84 HR = 1.20 (.97–1.48) p = .09; IIVRT: Wald = 2.84 HR = 1.20 (.97–1.47) p = .09); age
and sex were the only significant predictors in both RT models. Repeating the backward regression
after eliminating dementia cases, with both RT measures and all covariates entered at the first step,
IIVRT remained a significant predictor in the final model along with age and sex (IIVRT: Wald =
3.89 HR = 1.23 (95%CI: 1.00–1.50) p = .049), global cognition was excluded. Additional data for
full models with dementia cases excluded are provided in S1 Table.
Discussion
In this large community-based old age cohort, greater variability in RT performance but not
slower mean RT predicted all-cause mortality while adjusting for conventional mortality risk

 factors of age, sex, cardiovascular risk and APOE ε4 status and important potential confound-
ers of low global cognition and prodromal dementia, both known to be associated with greater
IIVRT [4, 35] and increased mortality risk in old age [12, 13, 36]. Following removal of known
incident dementia cases, the association between IIVRT and time to death in the multivariable
model decreased slightly and failed to reach significance. However, the findings remained
robust in the most parsimonious model even after dementia cases were removed with greater
IIVRT, older age and male sex significant predictors of all-cause mortality.
Our findings broadly support and extend the small extant literature [9–11, 37] by providing
further support for a strong association between IIVRT and all-cause mortality having adjusted
for a broad range of potential confounders. Previous studies have failed to adequately account
for effects of overall cognitive level and dementia on the relationship between IIVRT and mor-
tality. Of the few studies that have included measures of cognition, investigators have simply
controlled for performance accuracy on the individual tasks from which RT data were taken
[9], or compared RT measures with one or two other cognitive measures (e.g., memory, visuo-
spatial reasoning)[11]. The global cognition score employed in the present study is a more
reliable and valid measure of cognition than those previously used since it is based on a large
number of psychometrically validated cognitive tasks and it measures five major cognitive
domains thereby more broadly capturing the individual’s level of cognitive function.
Dementia was also considered a potential confound in light of our previous work showing
that incident dementia is associated with worse performance on cognitive measures, and

Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to test each model. IIVRT and Mean RT were examined separately for Models 1 and 2. The results presented
on the left side of the table are for models examining IIVRT and on the right side of the table for Mean RT. Model 1 measured predictive value of each RT
measure unadjusted for covariates (N = 861; 191 deceased). Model 2 examined individual RT measure and all covariates together using enter method
(N = 789; 172 deceased). Model 3 included IIVRT, mean RT and all covariates using the backward step (Wald) procedure (N = 789; 172 deceased). Final
model is shown.
RT = reaction time; IIVRT = intra-individual variability of reaction time.
Sex represents the risk of mortality for males relative to females. Age is measured in years. Cognition score is a global composite score obtained from
average performance on 10 neuropsychological measures. CVD risk score is based on a Framingham-type composite score.
Mean RT, IIVRT and global cognition measures were analyzed per standard deviation unit. p-values in bold indicate significance at 0.05 level.

 IIVRT and mean RT [21] and reduced survival time [38]. While no MAS participant had
dementia at baseline, 85 were found to have dementia on biennial assessments over the 8-year
follow-up period. After removal of these 85 incident dementia cases, the effect strength was
slightly reduced (IIVRT: HR from 1.22 to 1.20) and failed to reach significance at conventional
levels in the full model (p = .09), possibly because of the smaller sample size and loss of power,
and higher variability scores in those who later developed dementia. However, when the
model was refined by removing non-significant covariates, IIVRT was retained in the set of
best predictors, along with age and sex. Our findings suggest therefore that prodromal demen-
tia does not explain the association of IIVRT and time to death and address the shortcomings
of previous studies that have either not considered dementia, even in the oldest-old when risk
of dementia is very high ([e.g. 11], whose participants were aged up to 94), or have used less
rigorous methods of controlling for dementia. For example, MacDonald and colleagues [9]
relied solely on death certificates which listed “questionable dementia” as an antecedent condi-
tion (not primary cause) of death and reported “identical patterns of inference” with and with-
out 33 cases of questionable dementia (12.5% of decedents). Batterham et al [10] used a cut-
score of �24 on the MMSE to control for possible preclinical dementia. However, conclusions
about the effects of dementia on the IIVRT-mortality relationship were limited by the low posi-
tive predictive value of the MMSE for dementia in population studies [39] and its crude mea-
surement of global cognition compared to a neuropsychological battery and clinical consensus
such as that used in the present study which is the gold standard for dementia diagnosis.
There is preliminary support for a stronger relationship of mortality with variability mea-
sures over mean RT measures when examined together [9, 10] although this is not universal
across studies [37] or cognitive tasks [9, 10]. In our study, mortality effects were attenuated
when both measures were included in the same base model and neither of the RT measures
was an independendent predictor over the other. This may not be surprising given the strong
correlation between the measures; increased IIVRT may be reflecting a higher number of slow
responses would also give rise to a slower mean RT. Furthermore, there is a part-whole associ-
ation between IIVRT and mean performance given that IIVRT scores reflect residual variance
after controlling for age-group and time on task (trial order) while mean RT includes all
sources of variability [9]. However, it is noteworthy that IIVRT was more weakly correlated
with the global cognition score (r = -.26) relative to that of mean RT (r = -.50) supporting the
premise that IIVRT is capturing unique information relating to mortality that other cognitive
measures are not tapping. From a cognitive perspective, increased IIVRT is thought to reflect a)
momentary fluctuations in attentional and executive control [40, 41]; b) individual differences
in the rate at which task-related information accumulates to reach a critical threshold before
triggering a response [42] or c) increased neural noise as the signal to noise ratio in the brain
decreases[43]. The consequence in behavioural terms is increased variation in moment-to-
moment processing efficiency uniquely captured by IIVRT measures.
The present study suggests that variability from performance-based measures of reaction
time is an independent risk factor and not simply a corollary of general cognitive decline or
neuropathological disturbances associated with dementia. Therefore, other explanatory mech-
anisms for the relationship between within-person variability and mortality should be consid-
ered. At the neurobiological level, research suggesting the involvement of striatal dopamine
D2 receptor binding in IIVRT [8] is consistent with the theory that IIVRT may reflect increased
neural noise. Specifically, it has been postulated that neural noise increases with age as a result
of reduced efficiency of the central nervous system and alterations in neurotransmitter systems
(e.g., dopaminergic system) leading to more erratic processing which is captured by IIVRT
measures [43]. This neurobiological disturbance may become further exaggerated closer to
death [10].
Reaction time variability as a predictor of mortality in old age

 However, it is also possible that behavioural variability is a proxy measure of general age-
related deterioration of physiological (body) processes. A deteriorating brain may simply be a
part of a deteriorating body [37] as suggested by the “common cause” hypothesis of cognitive
ageing [44] which delineates a single ageing process in physical and cognitive functions. Our
study suggests that estimating variability from reaction time measures is a more sensitive indi-
cator of survival than estimating mean levels of performance across several performance-based
measures of reaction time and other cognitive domains although all are indicators of a degen-
erating brain. This does not necessarily argue against a common cause since different parts of
the brain may react differentially, for example the hippocampus is more sensitive to hypoxia.
Likewise, the frontal cortex is more vulnerable to aging processes [45] and this may underlie
the sensitivity of IIVRT measures to impending mortality. Future research using a multimodal
approach incorporating cognitive and physical measures, and imaging to examine trajectories
of intra-individual variability, physical frailty and neurodegeneration, and their associations
with mortality in old age, may shed light on the common cause hypothesis.
Limitations of the research should be considered. The primary focus of our study was
on cognition and inclusion of a comprehensive set of potential predictors of mortality is
beyond the scope of this study. The selection of variables for the current study was based on
the most commonly examined in the literature. In a recent publication, our group has exam-
ined a comprehensive range of risk factors for mortality, and also for dementia and Mild
Cognitive Impairment [46]. We identified 85 cases with dementia over the follow-up period
corresponding to an incidence rate of 19.1/1000 person-years in this older adult community
sample. Although this is in line with published rates globally [47, 48], some cases of dementia
may not have been detected before death. There are several reasons for this. First, the study
design used 2-year assessment intervals and conversion to dementia may have occurred after
the last assessment but before death. Second, a common issue in longitudinal studies is the
problem of attrition and persons who drop out of observational cohort studies have an in-
creased likelihood of progression to dementia [49]. Third, in Australia we do not have access
to a dementia registry, which may have allowed more complete identification of new dementia
cases. Given these considerations, we may have underestimated the effects of dementia on the
association of mortality and IIVRT. Despite these limitations, the present study represents the
most rigorous attempt to date to control for general cognitive level and dementia, and also
major risk factors using comprehensive assessments and diagnoses based on clinical criteria.
Nonetheless, it is important that future research address the possibility of dementia and other
risk factors affecting the association of IIVRT and mortality.
In conclusion, the present study suggests that variability of RT represents a unique cogni-
tive marker of impending death beyond an individual’s overall cognitive function and various
other risk factors. Accounting for new cases of dementia up to 8 years after the baseline assess-
ment did not alter the IIVRT-mortality association suggesting that this association is indepen-
dent of dementia-related neuropathological changes in the prodromal period. The findings
supports the view of IIVRT as a behavioural marker of neurobiological integrity [22] and that
this may underlie its sensitivity to terminal decline and death, as well as other neuropathologi-
cal states such as dementia [21], and falls risk [50].
