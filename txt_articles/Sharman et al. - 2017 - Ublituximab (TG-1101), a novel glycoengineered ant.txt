Summary
Ibrutinib is effective in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL);
however, treatment resistance remains a problem. Ublituximab is a novel,
glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with single-agent activity
in relapsed CLL. We report the results of a phase 2 study evaluating combi-
nation therapy with ibrutinib and ublituximab in patients with relapsed or
refractory CLL. Patients received ibrutinib 420 mg once daily. Ublituximab
was administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 followed by day 1 of cycles
2–6. Response assessments were completed at cycles 3 and 6; patients then
continued on ibrutinib monotherapy per standard of care. Forty-one of 45
enrolled patients were evaluable for efficacy. Safety was consistent with
prior experience for each drug, with infusion reactions the most prevalent
adverse event. Combination therapy resulted in an overall response rate
(ORR) of 88% at 6 months. In the 20 patients with high-risk features (17p
or 11q deletions or TP53 mutation) and evaluable for efficacy, the ORR
was 95%, with three patients (15%) achieving negative minimal residual
disease. Median time to response was 8 weeks. Ublituximab in combination
with ibrutinib resulted in rapid and high response rates. The long-term
clinical benefit of ublituximab will be defined by an ongoing phase 3 trial
(NCT 02301156).

Management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has
evolved from single-agent chemotherapy, such as chlorambu-
cil or fludarabine, to combination regimens, such as fludara-
bine and cyclophosphamide. The addition of the anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab to fludarabine and
cyclophosphamide improved overall survival (OS) in CLL
(Hallek et al, 2010), and long-term follow-up of this regimen
has even raised the question of whether some patients with
CLL can be cured of their disease with intensive chemoim-
munotherapy (Fischer et al, 2016; Thompson et al, 2016).
More recently, novel B-cell receptor (BCR)-signalling inhi-
bitors, such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor
ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) delta
inhibitor idelalisib, have transformed the management of
patients with CLL and demonstrated further improvements
in OS (Byrd et al, 2013, 2014; Furman et al, 2014; O’Brien

 et al, 2014; Burger et al, 2015). Ibrutinib has demonstrated
remarkable single-agent activity in both the relapsed and
refractory settings (Byrd et al, 2013), as well as in treatment-
na€
ıve CLL (O’Brien et al, 2014). In randomized studies, ibru-
tinib has improved OS compared to ofatumumab (Byrd
et al, 2014) and chlorambucil (Burger et al, 2015), and has
improved progression-free survival (PFS) when administered
in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (Chanan-
Khan et al, 2015).
Recent studies have suggested that ibrutinib monotherapy
may result in incomplete inhibition of BCR signalling, even
at approved dose levels (Poggesi et al, 2015), and that dose
reductions or interruptions are associated with higher rates
of progression (Barr et al, 2015). The depth of disease con-
trol in patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy is not yet
fully understood, with complete responses (CR) and minimal
residual disease (MRD) negativity rare (Byrd et al, 2014). In
addition, patients with adverse cytogenetic features may
experience less durable disease control with ibrutinib com-
pared with patients who lack such adverse features (Byrd
et al, 2013). Further, mutations in BTK or the downstream-
signalling protein phospholipase C gamma (PLCG2) have
been shown to confer ibrutinib resistance (Woyach et al,
2014a), and survival following discontinuation of ibrutinib
can be very short (Jain et al, 2015; Maddocks et al, 2015).
For these reasons, combination regimens that include ibruti-
nib have the potential to enhance patient outcomes versus
those seen with ibrutinib monotherapy. Both rituximab and
ofatumumab have been added to ibrutinib in separate stud-
ies, with both showing more rapid response rates and higher
overall response rates (ORRs) compared to historic controls
(Burger et al, 2014; Jaglowski et al, 2015). Multiple studies
are also evaluating the addition of the glycoengineered anti-
CD20 mAb, obinutuzumab, to ibrutinib, including a ran-
domized, multicentre, open-label phase 3 study of ibrutinib
in combination with obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil in
combination with obinutuzumab in patients with treatment-
na€
ıve CLL (Flinn et al, 2015).
Ublituximab is a novel, type 1, anti-CD20 mAb that binds
to a unique epitope on the CD20 antigen, distinct from
rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab, and has been
glycoengineered to exhibit a low-fucose fragment crystalliz-
able (Fc) region, thereby demonstrating enhanced antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In in vitro studies,
ublituximab demonstrated 100 times greater natural killer
(NK)-cell-mediated ADCC than rituximab in patient-donor
CLL cells (Le Garff-Tavernier et al, 2011). In a first-in-
human study in patients with relapsed CLL, ublituximab
demonstrated marked and durable B-cell depletion when
administered as a single agent, resulting in a 45% ORR with
a favourable toxicity profile (Cazin et al, 2011). We hypothe-
sized that the addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib would
result in quicker time to response and a greater depth of
response for patients with relapsed and refractory CLL com-
pared with ibrutinib alone.
Methods
Subjects
This was a multicentre, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy
and safety of ublituximab in combination with ibrutinib in
patients
with
select
B-cell
malignancies.
Adult
subjects
≥18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of mantle cell
lymphoma, CLL, or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) were
enrolled in the trial. The demographics and outcomes for the
CLL cohort only are reported herein. CLL subjects were
required to have an indication for treatment according to the
2008 International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria (Hal-
lek et al, 2008) and to have received at least one prior stan-
dard treatment regimen. Subjects were required to have an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status ≤2 with adequate organ function, defined as an abso-
lute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 9 109/l and platelet count
≥50 9 109/l for the dose confirmation period and an ANC
≥0�75 9 109/l and platelet count ≥30 9 109/l for phase 2.
Prior treatment with a BTK inhibitor and/or a PI3K inhibi-
tor was permitted.
Subjects were excluded if they had received cancer therapy
within 3 weeks of cycle 1/day 1; had received an autologous
haematological stem cell transplant within 3 months of study
entry or any prior allogeneic haematological stem-cell trans-
plant; or had Richter transformation, prolymphocytic leukae-
mia, primary central nervous system lymphoma or the
presence of any other active cancers. All subjects gave written
informed consent according to International Review Board
guidelines. This study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was registered at Clinicaltrials.-
gov [National Clinical Trial (NCT) Identifier: 02013128].
Study design
This study consisted of a dose-confirmation safety run-in per-
iod followed by an open enrolment into phase 2. The dose-
confirmation safety assessment enrolled six patients with CLL
into each of two cohorts: Cohort 1 received ibrutinib 420 mg
daily and ublituximab 600 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1.
Safety data were reviewed after all subjects had completed
Cohort 1 therapy. If ≤1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred
in Cohort 1, the dose escalation proceeded to Cohort 2 (ibru-
tinib 420 mg daily; ublituximab dose increased to 900 mg on
days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1). If ≥2 or more DLTs occurred in
Cohort 1, Cohort �1 was initiated (ibrutinib 420 mg daily;
ublituximab dose decreased to 450 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 of
cycle 1). If ≤1 DLT was reported in Cohort 2, the dose was
considered safe for phase 2.
Once the dose was confirmed, subjects were enrolled into
the open phase 2 part of the study, in which they received
six cycles of ublituximab 900 mg and ibrutinib according to
the schedule shown in Fig 1. After cycle 6, ibrutinib was
administered off study per standard of care.

 Ublituximab was administered as an intravenous infusion.
Subjects
received
premedication
with
an
antihistamine
(diphenhydramine 50 mg or equivalent) and a corticosteroid
(dexamethasone 12 mg or equivalent) approximately 30 min
prior to each ublituximab infusion. Oral acetaminophen
650 mg was permitted in subjects who experienced fever or
pyrexia after the first-week dose or as clinically indicated.
Concurrent glucocorticoid therapy was permitted if started at
least 7 days prior to study entry (≤10 mg/day prednisone or
equivalent) if clinically warranted. The day 1 infusion of
ublituximab in cycle 1 was split between day 1 and day 2,
with up to 150 mg administered on day 1 and the remainder
of the dosage on day 2 to minimize infusion-related reac-
tions (IRRs). Prophylactic allopurinol was permitted for sub-
jects at risk for tumour lysis syndrome.
Assessments and endpoints
The primary objective of the safety run-in was to evaluate
the safety of ublituximab in combination with ibrutinib
for the doses given. The primary objective of the phase 2
study was to determine the ORR, defined as the rate of CR plus
the rate of partial response (PR) of the combination. Patients
who met the criteria for a CR but lacked bone marrow confir-
mation were considered to have a PR. Secondary objectives
included safety, CR rate and the rate of MRD negativity.
Efficacy was assessed by a computed tomography (CT)
scan at the start of cycle 3 and then again at approximately
cycle 6. All efficacy assessments had a �7-day window.
Responses were assessed per iwCLL criteria (Hallek et al,
2008), and PR with lymphocytosis (PR-L) was also assessed
per the suggested modification of the iwCLL guidelines (Che-
son et al, 2012). Physical examinations, vital signs, haematol-
ogy and serum chemistry were performed on all ublituximab
dosing days, as well as an additional assessment on day 22 of
cycle 1. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by the Common
Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE), version 4.0 (http://
evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_Quick-
Reference_8.5x11.pdf).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using a one-sided
hypothesis test at the overall 5% level of significance.
Descriptive statistics were used for all variables. The primary
efficacy variable (ORR) and the 90% one-sided confidence
interval of the rate were estimated. Per the statistical design,
up to 50 patients with CLL were to be enrolled, assuming a
10% screen fail or non-evaluable rate. If the response rate
was no more than 60%, the study would be determined a
failure; if a >20% increase in ORR versus the 58% ORR
reported for ibrutinib (https://www.janssenmd.com/pdf/im-
bruvica/PI-Imbruvica.pdf) was achieved, the study would be
considered to have a positive result. MRD was evaluated
from peripheral blood samples in local laboratories using a
minimum of four-colour flow cytometry with a lower limit
of detection of 0�01% (one malignant cell in 10 000 white
blood cells). MRD analysis was completed at the start of
cycles 3 and 6 following the patients’ CT scan results.
This study employed a modified intent-to-treat (ITT)
design. The modified ITT population consisted of all enrolled
patients who had at least one post-baseline efficacy measure-
ment, and the primary efficacy analyses were performed
based on the modified ITT population. The safety population
included all enrolled patients who received at least one dose
of the study drug. All safety assessments including toxicity
were performed on the safety population.
Results
Patients
A total of 45 subjects with CLL were enrolled in the study,
including patients in the safety run-in and open enrolment
Fig 1. Study design and treatment schema. Patients received ibrutinib daily beginning on day 1 of cycle 1. Ublituximab infusions were given on
days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6. Patients were assessed for response after months 2 and 5. Each cycle is 28 days.

 components; all subjects were evaluable for safety, while 41
were evaluable for efficacy. Of the four subjects not evalu-
able for efficacy, two subjects were lost to follow-up (one
patient
withdrew
consent
after
one
infusion,
and
one
patient entered hospice after the second infusion), and two
subjects discontinued the study prior to the first disease
assessment due to an AE. Of the two subjects who discon-
tinued, one was due to diarrhoea, assessed by the treating
investigator as related to ibrutinib; and one was due to
AEs of pneumonia and pleural effusion, which were not
attributed to study drug treatment by the treating investiga-
tor (Table I). Of the 45 patients, 47% (21 of 45) were clas-
sified
as
‘high
risk’,
exhibiting
one
or
more
of
the
following cytogenetic abnormalities: del 17p (n = 12), del
11q (n = 12), and/or a TP53 (n = 2) mutation, with five
having both del 17p and 11q. Prior treatment included
purine analogues (22/44), bendamustine (21/44), idelalisib
(2/44), a spleen-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (2/44) and the
BTK inhibitor CC-292 (1/44). Of the evaluable patients,
29% were considered anti-CD20-refractory, progressing on
or within 6 months of an anti-CD20-based regimen where
prior anti-CD20 therapy included rituximab, ofatumumab
and/or obinutuzumab.
Safety outcomes
Overall, the combination of ublituximab and ibrutinib was
well tolerated. No DLTs were seen in the six patients treated
in the safety run-in cohort. The most common AEs were
IRRs, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and rash (Table II). The
most common (≥5%) grades 3/4 AEs were anaemia, neu-
tropenia, IRRs and thrombocytopenia. All rash and grades 3/
4 diarrhoea events were deemed related to ibrutinib per
investigator assessment. All IRRs were related to ublituximab,
with dose interruptions as the most common intervention;
21 of 45 patients (47%) had dose interruptions due to IRR,
and one patient was dose-reduced to 600 mg due to IRR.
Other ublituximab-related dose interruptions were due to
neutropenia
(two
patients)
and
elevated
aspartate
aminotransferase (two patients). For ibrutinib, two patients
had their dose reduced (one for diarrhoea, one for dizziness)
and 10 of 45 (22%) had their dose interrupted (three for
rash, two for neutropenia, one for anaemia, one for throm-
bocytopenia, one for nausea, one for hypercalcaemia and one
for dehydration).
Four subjects (9%) discontinued study participation due
to an AE: one was due to grade 3 diarrhoea, and three were
discontinued for AEs considered unrelated to study treat-
ment per the treating investigator. Aside from IRRs, the
addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib did not appear to alter
the safety and tolerability profile historically seen with ibruti-
nib monotherapy.
Efficacy outcomes
All evaluable patients (n = 41) achieved some reduction in
disease burden (Fig 2). The primary endpoint of ORR within
6 months by iwCLL criteria (Hallek et al, 2008) was met at
88%; two subjects (5%) achieved a CR and 34 subjects
(83%) had a PR. One subject (2%) achieved a PR-L; inclu-
sion of this subject results in an ORR of 90%, according to
the 2012 suggested modification of the iwCLL guidelines
(Cheson et al, 2012). The four subjects who did not achieve
a response included three who had stable disease and one
who, although exhibiting a >70% nodal reduction, met the
iwCLL criteria for disease progression with the appearance of
a new lesion on CT scan. Notably, the high-risk subgroup of

Ublituximab and Ibrutinib in Relapsed/Refractory CLL

 CLL subjects exhibited an ORR of 95% (10% CR and 85%
PR) with 15% of the high-risk patients (one CR and two
PR) achieving MRD negativity by four-colour flow cytometry
within 6 months of therapy. Of the subjects who achieved a
CR or PR, all but two of the responses occurred by week 8.
All 41 subjects had nodal reduction ranging from 20% to
100%, with 93% (38 of 41) of subjects achieving a >50%
nodal reduction by month 6 (Fig 3). A median nodal reduc-
tion of 62% was observed at week 8 and 77% at week 20 for
all CLL subjects; while among the high-risk subset, median
nodal reductions of 64% and 85% were observed at weeks 8
and 20, respectively.
Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) decreased significantly
in the first month of treatment in most patients in the CLL
group and continued to decrease over time (Fig 4). Addition
of ublituximab to the treatment regimen appeared to reduce
ibrutinib-related lymphocytosis, with a median 75% decrease
in ALC from baseline by the end of cycle 3. More than 70%
of CLL subjects had lymphocyte counts in the normal range
(<4 9 109/l) within 6 cycles of therapy. Marked B-cell deple-
tion and abrogation of lymphocytosis was also observed in
the subset of patients who were refractory to prior anti-
CD20 therapy (Fig S1).
Discussion
It is not yet known whether the kinetics of ibrutinib responses
impact the durability of disease control. Early analyses of
studies conducted with ibrutinib to date suggest that patients
achieving PR-L on ibrutinib monotherapy exhibit similar out-
comes to patients who achieved a true PR on ibrutinib (Woy-
ach et al, 2014b), although long-term follow-up is not
available in this selected clinical trial population. In the sin-
gle-arm, phase 2 study that led to accelerated approval of
ibrutinib (Byrd et al, 2013), the ORR by iwCLL 2008 criteria
(Hallek et al, 2008) at 2 and 5 months were reported as 21%
and 39%, respectively; however, an additional 52% and 46%
of patients at 2 and 5 months, respectively, achieved PR-Ls,
which, if included in the ORR assessment as per the suggested
updates to the iwCLL criteria for response (Cheson et al,
2012), bring response rates at 2 and 5 months to 73% and
85%, respectively (Byrd et al, 2013). In a randomized, phase
3 study comparing
ibrutinib
to ofatumumab,
the
best
response to ibrutinib was 43% PR, with an additional 20%
demonstrating PR-L; CR was not observed (Byrd et al, 2014).
Initiation of ibrutinib often causes a transient lymphocyto-
sis. Much of the initial clinical activity of ibrutinib may result
from a demargination phenomenon, whereby disruption of
the supportive microenvironment results in CLL cell migra-
tion from the lymph nodes into the peripheral circulation,
rather than from direct cytotoxicity (de Rooij et al, 2012).
In this study, we observed that ublituximab abrogated the
lymphocytosis commonly associated with ibrutinib. The ORRs
by iwCLL 2008 criteria at 2 and 6 months were 83% and 88%,
respectively, excluding those patients with PR-L. Further,
within 6 months of initiating therapy, MRD-negative status

iwCLL criteria (Hallek et al, 2008), the ORR within 6 months was
88% with 5% CR and 83% PR. When PR-L is included, the ORR is
90%. In the high-risk CLL population (n = 20), the ORR per iwCLL
criteria was 95%, with 10% CR and 85% PR. CLL, chronic lympho-

 was achieved in 7% of patients, including 15% (3 of 20) with
high-risk markers (17p or 11q deletions or a TP53 mutation).
In light of the recent observations that ibrutinib does not com-
pletely suppress BCR signalling in many patients and resis-
tance is partly mediated through acquisition of BTK/PLCG2
mutations (Jain et al, 2015; Maddocks et al, 2015; Poggesi
et al, 2015), we hypothesize that the addition of anti-CD20
antibodies may protect against acquisition of resistance by
providing alternative mechanisms of cytotoxicity. This study,
however, does not provide confirmation of that hypothesis
and will be addressed in multiple ongoing phase three studies,
including: (i) ibrutinib monotherapy versus ublituximab plus
ibrutinib in patients with previously treated high-risk CLL
(NCT02301156); (ii) ibrutinib monotherapy, ibrutinib plus
rituximab, or bendamustine plus rituximab in older patients
with previously untreated CLL (NCT01886872); and (iii) ibru-
tinib plus obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil plus obinu-
tuzumab
in
patients
with
previously
untreated
CLL
(NCT02264574).
Two previous reports have characterized the addition of a
CD20 antibody to ibrutinib (Burger et al, 2014; Jaglowski et al,
2015). The addition of rituximab to ibrutinib in high-risk CLL
(either relapsed/refractory or treatment-na€
ıve) resulted in an
ORR of 95% by iwCLL 2008 criteria, including 8% CR as best
overall response (Burger et al, 2014). In a separate study in
which ofatumumab was added to ibrutinib, the ORR in CLL/
SLL patients was 83�3%, with a single patient (1�5%) achieving
a CR (Jaglowski et al, 2015). These two reports approximate
the experience reported herein – however, several significant
differences between trials are notable. The rituximab-plus-
ibrutinib study included treatment-na€
ıve patients (10% of
study subjects) (Burger et al, 2014). Differences in response
kinetics were also observed. In our study, the addition of ubli-
tuximab to ibrutinib caused the median lymphocyte count at
1 week to decrease. In contrast, neither rituximab nor
ofatumumab therapy abrogated the lymphocytosis to the
degree seen with ublituximab. In addition, 29% of enrolled
subjects treated with ublituximab were deemed anti-CD20
refractory by standard definitions (progressing on or within
6 months of an anti-CD20-containing regimen). Additionally,
age has emerged as an important predictor of ibrutinib toler-
ance, with older patients less able to tolerate ibrutinib therapy
(Maddocks et al, 2015). Both the rituximab and ofatumumab
studies included younger patient populations (median age 63
vs. 64 vs. 71 years for rituximab, ofatumumab and ublitux-
imab, respectively). Whether rituximab, ofatumumab, obinu-
tuzumab or ublituximab represents the optimal partner with
ibrutinib cannot be determined from these comparisons;
rather, these comparisons reinforce the faster and higher
response rates observed when an anti-CD20 antibody is added.
There are concerns that ibrutinib could interfere with the
activity of anti-CD20 antibodies. Ibrutinib binds interleukin-2
inducible tyrosine kinase (ITK) (Dubovsky et al, 2013). In NK
cells stimulated by Fc receptor, ITK expression leads to cal-
cium mobilization, granule release, and cytotoxicity (Khurana
et al, 2007). Blocking of ITK by ibrutinib could, in theory,
reduce the efficacy of anti-CD20 antibodies, and such antago-
nism has indeed been demonstrated in vitro (Kohrt et al,
2014; Da Roit et al, 2015). However, based on the robust lym-
phocyte depletion demonstrated by ublituximab in the pres-
ence of ibrutinib co-administration, no clinically meaningful
evidence of such antagonism was observed in this study. In
this context, the enhanced ADCC properties of ublituximab
could provide an explanation for overcoming the antagonism
demonstrated in vitro between rituximab and ibrutinib.
One important limitation of the current study is that it
was not designed to evaluate PFS and OS. At the time this
study was initiated, there were no reports of the clinical effi-
cacy of BTK inhibitors given in combination with anti-CD20
antibodies. This study was designed primarily to evaluate

 whether response rates, and particularly depth of response,
were qualitatively different from those seen in the historic
controls of ibrutinib monotherapy. An ongoing study using a
randomized phase 3 design will determine the impact of the
addition of ublituximab to ibrutinib on PFS and ORR in
patients with high-risk CLL (NCT Identifier 02301156).
