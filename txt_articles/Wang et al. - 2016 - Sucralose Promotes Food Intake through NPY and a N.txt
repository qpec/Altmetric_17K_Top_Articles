In Brief
Wang et al. show that chronic
consumption of the synthetic sweetener
sucralose causes increased food intake in
the fruit fly. This effect involves a neuronal
starvation pathway, and a similar effect
was observed in mice. These findings
suggest that disrupting the sweet/energy
balance of food may have unanticipated
consequences.

SUMMARY
Non-nutritivesweetenerslikesucraloseareconsumed
by billions of people. While animal and human studies
have demonstrated a link between synthetic sweet-
ener consumption and metabolic dysregulation, the
mechanisms responsible remain unknown. Here we
use a diet supplemented with sucralose to investigate
the long-term effects of sweet/energy imbalance. In
flies, chronic sweet/energy imbalance promoted hy-
peractivity, insomnia, glucose intolerance, enhanced
sweet taste perception, and a sustained increase
in food and calories consumed, effects that are
reversed upon sucralose removal. Mechanistically,
this response was mapped to the ancient insulin, cate-
cholamine, and NPF/NPY systems and the energy
sensor AMPK, which together comprise a novel
neuronal starvation response pathway. Interestingly,
chronic sweet/energy imbalance promoted increased
food intake in mammals as well, and this also occurs
through an NPY-dependent mechanism. Together,
our data show that chronic consumption of a sweet/
energy imbalanced diet triggers a conserved neuronal
fasting response and increases the motivation to eat.
INTRODUCTION
Synthetic or non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) can be found in
thousands of products and are consumed by billions of people
annually. Despite widespread usage, the impact of a syntheti-
cally sweetened diet on metabolic health remains unclear and
controversial. Experiments using animal models support a role
for NNSs in metabolic dysregulation; however, the molecular
mechanisms involved are unclear. For example, rats given a
saccharin solution showed increased food intake compared to
animals given water, and this increase occurred even when the
sweetener was removed from the diet (Tordoff and Friedman,
1989a, 1989b, 1989c, 1989d). Beyond food intake, numerous
studies have shown that animals consuming synthetic sweet-
eners exhibit weight gain (Feijo
´ et al., 2013; Swithers and David-
son, 2008; Swithers et al., 2010, 2013), accumulation of body fat
(Swithers et al., 2010, 2013), or impaired glucose homeostasis
(Suez et al., 2014; Swithers et al., 2012) or exhibit weaker caloric
compensation (Swithers et al., 2010).
The majority of observational studies addressing NNS con-
sumption show an association with metabolic dysregulation.
An early study reported a significant correlation between
NNS consumption and weight gain in an �80 000 participants
study (Stellman and Garfinkel, 1988). Other independent studies
confirmed these associations, with synthetically sweetened
beverage consumption being associated with a much higher
incidence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio �1.93) when
compared to non-users (Fowler et al., 2008; Lutsey et al.,
2008), and NNS consumption has been identified as a significant
risk factor for metabolic disease in children (Blum et al., 2005),
middle-aged adults (Dhingra et al., 2007), and the elderly (Fowler
et al., 2015). One study showed that NNS consumers exhibit
reduced weight gain (Schulze et al., 2004); however, these
participants showed increased risk for developing diabetes in
an 8-year follow-up. Furthermore, human intervention studies
have also shown that ingestion of NNS could enhance appetite
(Blundell and Hill, 1986; Rogers and Blundell, 1989), promote
hunger (Tordoff and Alleva, 1990), and increase food consump-
tion (Lavin et al., 1997; Rogers and Blundell, 1989; Tordoff and
Friedman, 1989a), resulting in impaired glucose tolerance (Pe-
pino et al., 2013; Suez et al., 2014). However, other studies
have reported no major effect or weight loss as a result of
consuming NNSs (De La Hunty et al., 2006; de Ruyter et al.,
2012; Raben et al., 2002), and the overall impact of NNS on
metabolic health remains controversial.
In order to more definitively determine the impact of NNSs on
energy homeostasis, and potential mechanisms involved in such
effects, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit flies
possess systems that assess both sweetness and caloric con-
tent of food (Burke and Waddell, 2011; Dus et al., 2011, 2013,
2015; Fujita and Tanimura, 2011; Gordesky-Gold et al., 2008;
Stafford et al., 2012) and the insulin and gustatory reward path-
ways are conserved from invertebrates to mammals (Burke et al.,
2012). Moreover, the available genetic tools (Dietzl et al., 2007),
conserved metabolic pathways (Pospisilik et al., 2010) and
controlled behavioral assays (Dethier, 1976; Ja et al., 2007)

 make the fruit fly an ideal system to dissect the impact of syn-
thetic sweetness on energy homeostasis.
RESULTS
Synthetically Sweetened Food Has a Broad Impact on
Energy Homeostasis
Of the commercially available NNSs, fruit flies find sucralose the
most palatable (Gordesky-Gold et al., 2008). Sucralose is highly
stable and thus is often used to sweeten food that requires
baking or products with a longer shelf life. To investigate if con-
sumption of a sucralose-sweetened diet impacts fly energy ho-
meostasis, we fed flies either a standard control diet (sucrose
and yeast) or a control diet plus the synthetic sweetener sucra-
lose for various times. Animals were then removed from the su-
cralose diet and food (sucrose and yeast) intake was determined
over the next 24 hr using the capillary feeding (CAFE) assay. An-
imals consuming the sweetened diet for 1–4 days did not differ
from controls; however, flies exposed to a diet laced with sucra-
lose for prolonged (R5 days) periods exhibited a robust increase
in subsequent food intake (Figure 1A) and calories consumed
(Figure 1B); this effect was observed in both male (Figures 1A
and 1B) and female (not shown) animals. Interestingly, the appe-
tite-stimulating effect was reversible, and food intake returned to
control levels within 3 days of sucralose being removed from the
diet (Figure 1A). The proboscis extension response (PER) assay
can also be used to evaluate taste sensitivity and the overall
motivation to consume food (Dethier, 1976). Interestingly,
compared to control-treated flies, animals fed the sucralose
diet for 6 days showed a marked increase in sucrose sensitivity
by PER (Figure 1C), but removing sucralose from the diet abol-
ished this sensitization after 3 days (Figure 1D). One report
(Suez et al., 2014) recently showed that in mice, saccharin could
trigger metabolic abnormalities through actions on the host mi-
crobiome. We tested if a similar mechanism contributed to the
appetite-stimulating effect of sucralose observed in our system.
However, after prolonged consumption of a sucralose-sweet-
ened diet, flies continued to exhibit a robust appetite-stimulating
response to sucralose pretreatment in both tetracycline-treated
(Figure S1A) or germ-free (Figure S1B) flies, indicating that
in Drosophila this effect is independent of the microbiome. In
addition to sucralose, flies find L-glucose, a sweet-tasting non-
caloric enantiomer of D-glucose, palatable. Importantly, 6 days
ingestion of a diet containing L-glucose also had a sustained
appetite-stimulating effect (Figure 1E).
Sustained sucralose ingestion did not cause a significant
change in body weight (Figure S1C), triglycerides (Figure S1D),
glycogen (Figure S1E), or resting hemolymph glucose (Fig-
ure S1F). However, sucralose-treated flies did show impaired
glucose tolerance in an oral glucose tolerance test (Figure 1F).
Furthermore, flies became hyperactive after 4 days of sucra-
lose-sweetened food (Figure 1G) but not after L-glucose-sweet-
ened food (Figure S1G), and sucralose-treated animals also
exhibited sleep fragmentation (Figure 1H) and reduced total
sleep (Figure 1I). Elevated energy expenditure caused by
increased activity and altered sleep behavior may explain why
these animals do not significantly expand energy stores despite
increased caloric intake. Of interest, similar effects (i.e., altered
sleep behavior and insomnia) have been reported in human sub-
jects ingesting NNSs (Roberts, 1988). These data show that, in
flies, prolonged ingestion of sucralose-sweetened diet triggers
broad physiological changes similar to effects reported in ro-
dents and human studies.
Sucralose Ingestion Increases Appetite through Sweet
Taste Receptor Gr64a
Sucralose may increase appetite directly via taste-dependent or
indirectly via taste-independent mechanisms (Burke and Wad-
dell, 2011; Dus et al., 2011; Fujita and Tanimura, 2011). To test
this, we manipulated sweet taste neurons genetically using the
Gr64f-Gal4 driver line (Klapoetke et al., 2014). Synaptic silencing
of sweet taste neurons with tetanus toxin (Gr64f-Gal4 > UAS-
TNT), but not an inactive toxin (UAS-iTNT), blocked the sucralose
effect (Figure 2A), demonstrating these neurons are required to
promote increased appetite. Importantly, prolonged activation
of sweet taste neurons was also sufficient to drive a lasting in-
crease in food intake, since 6 days of thermogenetic precondi-
tioning (Hamada et al., 2008) of these cells mimicked sucralose
pretreatment and enhanced appetite for 24 hr after temperature
stimulation ended (Figure 2B). In flies, many sweet tastants
require the sweet taste receptors Gr5a or Gr64a (Dahanukar
et al., 2007). We found that sucralose requires Gr64a to mediate
increased food intake (Figure 2C; see Table S1A for basal food
intake) and PER sensitization to sucrose (Figure 2D; see Table
S1B for S50 values). Thus, prolonged ingestion of a sweetened
diet containing sucralose acts specifically through the sweet
receptor Gr64a, and importantly, sustained thermogenetic acti-
vation of sweet taste neurons is sufficient to produce a lasting
increase in food intake even in the absence of the sucralose-
sweetened diet.
The Fly Insulin System Is Critical for the Sucralose Effect
on Appetite
To understand how sucralose promotes changes in food intake,
we used mRNA sequencing. Flies were collected at day 0, or af-
ter 6 days on a sucralose-sweetened diet; mRNA was extracted
from fly heads; and RNA seq was performed. 175 transcripts
showed differential regulation in sucralose-fed versus control
flies, with 30 transcripts upregulated and 145 downregulated
(Figure 3A; Table S2). The 30 upregulated transcripts included
the fly insulin receptor InR (Figure 3B), and upregulation of the
InR starting 4 days after sucralose diet was confirmed by
qPCR (Figure 3C), suggesting an involvement of the fly insulin
system in sucralose-induced feeding changes. To directly test
a role for neuronal InR, we used tissue-specific transgenic
RNAi (Dietzl et al., 2007). While the pan-neuronal driver line
nSyb-Gal4, or the UAS-InR RNAi lines crossed to w1118 control
lines, exhibited robust increases in food intake following 6 days
on the sucralose diet, when the InR was knocked down constitu-
tively (Figure 3D; nSyb-Gal4 > UAS-InR RNAi) or inducibly (Fig-
ure 3E; nSyb-Gal4 > UAS-InR RNAi UAS-Gal80ts), these flies
no longer showed an increase in appetite or PER response (Fig-
ure 3F), and these findings were confirmed with a second RNAi
hairpin (not shown). The output from insulin-producing cells
was also critical for the appetite-stimulating effect of sucralose
pre-conditioning, since blocking output with tetanus toxin
(Dilp2-Gal4 > UAS-TNT) but not inactive control toxin (Dilp2-
Gal4 > UAS-iTNT) abolished the sucralose effect (Figure 3G),

 and inducible silencing of synaptic output was also sufficient to
block the sucralose response (Figure 3H). Importantly, inducible
thermogenetic activation of insulin-producing cells using TrpA1
(Dilp2-Gal4 > UAS-TrpA1) mimicked sucralose treatment and
was sufficient to promote a lasting increase in food intake (Fig-
ure 3I), and this is consistent with human studies where endog-
enously or exogenously increasing insulin levels also promotes
food intake (Rodin et al., 1985; Ryan et al., 2008). Taken together,
sucralose-sweetened food triggers the fly insulin system (Fig-
ure 3J) to promote appetite, and thermogenetic activation of
this system in the absence of sucralose is sufficient to mediate
a lasting increase in food intake.
Sucralose Promotes Hunger through a Pathway
Involving Octopamine and Dopamine
Since sucralose works through a taste-dependent mechanism,
and food consumption can be rewarding, we reasoned sucra-
lose might also act through a reward pathway. The gustatory
reward pathway is an ancient system conserved from inverte-
brates like Drosophila through to mammals (Burke et al., 2012).
The biogenic amine octopamine, which is related to norepineph-
rine, is a major neurotransmitter in the insect reward pathway
(Hammer, 1993; Schwaerzel et al., 2003) and can promote gus-
tatory reward in flies (Burke et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). Octop-
amine is synthesized from tyrosine, and this requires tyrosine
decarboxylase (TDC) and tyramine b-hydroxylase (Tbh). Tbh
mutant (TbhM18) flies (Burke et al., 2012), which cannot produce
octopamine, were indeed resistant to the effect of persistent
sucralose ingestion (Figure 4A). Importantly, when we blocked
synaptic output in octopamine-producing cells (Tdc2-Gal4 >
UAS-TNT), animals were completely resistant to the appetite-
stimulating effect of a sweetened diet, and in this case, pro-
longed sucralose ingestion had an appetite-suppressing effect
(Figure 4B). Moreover, we found octopamine-producing neurons
require the fly insulin receptor to promote increased food intake
(Figure 4C) and PER sensitization (Figure S2A) in response to
sucralose. Thermogenetic activation of octopamine-producing
neurons (Tdc2-Gal4 > UAS-TrpA1) could not mimic sucralose
pretreatment (Figure S2B). Thus, the octopamine system is
required downstream of insulin signaling to enhance appetite
in response to a sucralose-sweetened diet.
Next using pan-neuronal RNAi, we tested all fly octopamine
receptors and found only Oamb (Figures 4D and S2C) was
required for increased appetite. This was confirmed using a sec-
ond RNAi hairpin (data not shown), as well as using an Oamb
mutant line (oamb584), which no longer increased food intake
(Figure S2D) or showed enhanced PER response to sucrose
following the synthetically sweetened diet (Figure 4E). Octopa-
minergic neurons have been shown to interact directly with
dopaminergic neurons to promote gustatory reward (Burke

 et al., 2012; Huetteroth et al., 2015). Moreover, dopamine has
been shown to regulate taste behavior (Marella et al., 2012)
and constitutes a major gustatory reward pathway both in flies
(Burke et al., 2012) and mammals (de Araujo et al., 2008). In flies,
dopaminergic neurons can be manipulated genetically using
Gal4 driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (TH-Gal4)
(Friggi-Grelin et al., 2003). To assess if dopamine is involved in
the appetite-stimulating effect of sucralose, we blocked synap-
tic output from dopamine neurons (TH-Gal4>UAS-TNT), which
caused a complete resistance to sucralose pretreatment (Fig-
ure 4F). Interestingly, however, thermogenetic activation of
dopamine-producing cells (TH-Gal4 > UAS-TrpA1) was not suf-
ficient to mimic the appetite-stimulating effects of sucralose (Fig-
ure S2E). Moreover, when InR or Oamb was knocked down in
dopaminergic neurons, these flies were resistant to the pro-
appetitive (Figures 4G and 4H) and PER-sensitizing (Figures
S2F and S2G) effects of sucralose ingestion. To determine the
responsible dopamine receptor, we tested all known dopamine
receptors (pan-neuronal nSyb-Gal4 > UAS-DopR RNAi) and
identified DopR2 as being required for the appetite-stimulating
effects of sweetened food (Figures 4I and S2H). This was
confirmed using a second hairpin (data not shown) and a
DopR2 hypomorphic mutant line (DopR2MB05108) (Liu et al.,
2012b), both of which were resistant to the sucralose effect on
food intake (Figure S2I) and PER receptivity (Figure 4J). Of
note, a second dopamine receptor, DopEcR, was also required
for sucralose to increase appetite (Figures 4I and S2I) and PER
response (Figure 4J). DopEcR has previously been implicated
in regulating PER in response to starvation (Inagaki et al.,
2012). Furthermore, to identify if there is bi-directional signaling
between dopamine and insulin or octopamine-producing neu-
rons, we knocked down DopR2 using Dilp or Tdc2-Gal4; how-
ever, this had no effect on food intake (Figure S2J). Of note,
TH-Gal4 does not target the PAM cluster of dopaminergic neu-
rons that have been implicated previously in gustatory appetitive
memory, suggesting alternative mechanism of action in this
system (Liu et al., 2012a). Overall, the dopamine system is
necessary for sucralose to increase appetite, and this response
requires insulin (InR) and octopamine (Oamb) receptors in dopa-
mine-producing neurons (Figure 4K).
To identify the components of this response downstream of
dopamine, we crossed UAS-DopR2 to candidate neuronal
Gal4 drivers. The sucralose response did not require DopR2
expression in sweet taste neurons (Gr64f-Gal4 > DopR2 RNAi;
Figure S3A). However, when we knocked down DopR2 in NPF-
producing neurons, the sucralose effects on food intake (Fig-
ure 5A) and PER sensitization (Figure 5B; RNAi control in Fig-
ure S3B) were completely blocked. Of note, by comparing S50
values, NPF-Gal4 > DopR2 RNAi animals exhibit a significant
baseline sucrose sensitization that could explain the observed
loss of sucralose response (Figure S3C); however, basal food
intake was unaffected in these animals (data not shown) and
thus the observed loss of sucralose effect on food intake is
dependent on DopR2 expression in NPF+ neurons. Neuro-
peptide F (NPF), the fly ortholog of the potent mammalian
appetite-stimulating neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY)
(Loh et al., 2015), has been shown to directly interact with dopa-
minergic neurons to regulate feeding behavior in flies (Krashes
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2005). NPF was indeed
involved in the sucralose response, as output from both NPF-
producing (Figure 5C) and NPFR-expressing (Figure S3D)
neurons were critical for the appetite-stimulating activity of
sweetened food. Moreover, pan-neuronal knockdown of the
NPFR also conferred resistance to sucralose effects on food
intake (Figure 5D) and PER sensitization (Figure S3E; confirmed
with a second hairpin, not shown). Of note, NPFR expression
was not required in insulin-producing cells (Figure S3F), but
was required in dopamine-producing cells (Figure 5E), indicating
a bi-directional interaction between these two reward pathways.
Further, NPF-producing neurons did not require Oamb (not
shown) but did require the fly insulin receptor for sucralose to
cause increased appetite (Figure 5F) and PER sensitization (Fig-
ure S3G). Together, these data demonstrate that insulin acts
upstream of NPF-producing cells to promote food intake in
response to sucralose.
Sucralose Causes Sweet Taste Sensitization through
NPFR in Taste Neurons
Given the role for NPFR in modulating food preference (Wu et al.,
2005), and that sweet taste neurons are involved in the sucralose
response (Figure 2), we hypothesized that NPFR was acting
directly on sweet taste neurons. Consistent with this idea,
knockdown of NPFR in sweet taste neurons nullified the sucra-
lose-mediated increased food intake (Figure 5G) and PER sensi-
tization (Figure 5H). We next tested if sucralose was directly
altering sweet taste perception using electrophysiological re-
cordings from single taste sensilla on the fly labellum (Figure 5I).
Flies were fed control food ± sucralose for 6 days, and then
sucrose responses were recorded. Compared to control food,
flies on the sucralose-sweetened diet exhibited a strong (50%)

 sensitization to sucrose (Figure 5J). Importantly, when NPFR was
knocked down in Gr64f+ sweet taste neurons, these animals
showed a complete loss of sweet taste sensitization in response
to sucralose (Figure 5J). Thus, a sucralose-sweetened diet alters
the intensity of natural sugar through NPF acting directly on
sweet taste neurons (Figure 5K).
Consumption of Sucralose Promotes Hunger through
Activation of Neuronal AMPK
We next addressed if the effect of a sucralose diet is due to the
sweetness itself or a result of the imbalance between the sweet-
ness versus actual caloric content of the ingested food. If this
response was due to enhanced dietary sweetness alone, a similar
effect should be observed using a nutritive sweetener. Impor-
tantly, while pretreatment with the sucralose-sweetened diet pro-
moted increased food intake, 6 day pretreatment with 23 or 33
the sucrose content of control food caused a significant reduc-
tion in food intake relative to 13 sucrose control food (Figure 6A).
To address the dietary imbalance between perceived and actual
caloric content, we used sorbitol, a tasteless source of sugar cal-
ories for flies (Burke and Waddell, 2011; Fujita and Tanimura,
2011). While 6-day treatment of the synthetically sweetened
diet again promoted increased food intake, the additional inclu-
sion of nutritive but tasteless sorbitol to this sweetened diet nulli-
fied the appetite-stimulating effect, whereas additional sorbitol
without sucralose had no effect (Figure 6B). Since rebalancing
sweetness and caloric content blocked the sucralose effect, we
hypothesized that sucralose is likely working through an en-
ergy-sensing intermediate. To this end, we investigated a role
for the key cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK). Following 6 days of ingesting sucralose-containing
food, we saw significant activation of AMPK in the brain (Fig-
ure 6C), and when we knocked down AMPK constitutively (Fig-
ure 6D, and second hairpin, not shown) or inducibly (Figure 6E),
or expressed kinase-dead AMPK using pan-neuronal nSyb-
Gal4 (Figure S4A), we found that the effect of sucralose pretreat-
ment on both food intake (Figures 6D and 6E) and PER (Figure 6F)
was abolished. Furthermore, functional mapping of this response
revealed that AMPK was dispensable in insulin-like peptide-pro-
ducing neurons, octopaminergic neurons, and sweet taste
neurons (Figures S4B and S4C). Importantly, however, AMPK
expression in both dopaminergic and NPF-producing neurons
was essential for increased appetite (Figures 6G and S4D) and
PER sensitivity (Figures 6H, 6I, and S4E) after sucralose. Thus,
long-term ingestion of sucralose-sweetened food activates
neuronal AMPK, which acts within dopamine and NPF-producing
cells to promote hunger. Importantly, these data define a novel
neural pathway that integrates taste, hunger, reward, and nutri-
tional content (Figure 6J) to directly alter the taste of food and
promote an increased motivation to eat.
Consuming Synthetically Sweetened Food Mimics
Neuronal Fasting
Our results show that sucralose pretreatment triggers an in-
crease in appetite and sucrose receptivity and promotes hyper-
activity, insomnia, and sleep fragmentation, behaviors that are
consistent with a mild starvation or fasting state (Keene et al.,
2010). Moreover, previous work has implicated NPF (Inagaki
et al., 2014) and the dopamine receptor DopEcR (Inagaki et al.,
2012) in sweet taste sensitization after a 6 hr fast, the same mo-
lecular machinery we identified as critical regulators of the sucra-
lose response. To directly test if the sucralose effect is working
through a neuronal fasting response, we assessed the motiva-
tion to feed (PER) following 6 hr of fasting in animals that showed
resistance to sucralose pretreatment. Wild-type flies exhibited a
robust PER sensitization following fasting (Figure 7A), and as
previously described (Inagaki et al., 2012), this response was
completely absent in DopEcR mutants (Figure 7B; see Table
S1C for all S50 values). As with sustained sucralose ingestion,
this response was also blocked when synaptic output was
blocked from octopamine-, dopamine-, or NPF-producing neu-
rons (Figures S5A–S5C). Fasting-induced PER sensitization
also required neuronal InR (Figures 7C and S5D) expressed in
octopamine- (Figure 7D; Figure S5D), dopamine- (Figures 7E
and S5D), and NPF-producing (Figures 7F and S5D) neurons.
Moreover, this response required Oamb expression in dopa-
mine-producing neurons (Figures 7G and S5D), DopR2 expres-
sion in NPF-producing neurons (Figures 7Hand S5D), and
NPFR expression in dopaminergic (Figures 7I and S5D) and
sweet taste neurons (Figures 7J and S5D). Of note, by comparing
S50 values, NPF-Gal4 > DopR2 RNAi still showed some residual
sensitization in response to fasting (2-fold compared to fed
animals; Table S1C), suggesting a partial requirement for NPF-
expressed DopR2 in the fasting response. Fasting-induced
PER sensitization was also dependent on neuronal AMPK (Fig-
ure S5E), and as with sucralose responses, this function was
mapped to dopamine- (Figures 7K and S5D) and NPF-producing
(Figures 7L and S5D) neurons. Thus, the molecular pathway
promoting appetite in response to a synthetically sweetened
diet also modulates hunger in response to fasting.

 In addition, we tested if fasting also promotes direct sensitiza-
tion of sweet taste to sugar (Figure 7M). We confirmed previous
findings that 6 hr fasting does not induce taste sensitization to a
100 mM sucrose solution (Figure S5F) (Inagaki et al., 2012). How-
ever, at sucrose concentrations of 20 mM, we found a robust
sucrose sensitization in response to fasting when we recorded
single taste sensilla, and this is in line with similar observations
in the locust (Simpson et al., 1991). Importantly, this effect
required NPFR expression in sweet taste neurons (Figure 7N).
Thus, in flies, synthetically sweetened food or fasting activates
a previously unknown neuronal fasting response pathway (Fig-
ure 7O) that integrates the internal nutritional state and gustatory
cues to regulate food palatability and the motivation to eat.
Finally, we tested if sucralose ingestion also increased food
intake in mammals. Wild-type mice that orally consumed sucra-
lose jelly once per day showed a significant increase in food
intake following the 7th jelly treatment, while vehicle control-
treated mice showed no change (Figure 7P). Importantly, the
increased food intake following prolonged sucralose ingestion
was completely absent in NPY knockout (KO) mice (Figure 7Q).
Together, prolonged ingestion of a synthetically sweetened
diet activates a conserved neuronal response pathway involving
NPF/NPY, and these factors are critical for sucralose to promote
increased food intake.
DISCUSSION
While sweetness of an ingested substance often correlates with
nutritional value, this is not the case when food contains syn-
thetic sweeteners such as sucralose. Numerous studies have
reported an appetite-stimulating effect of consuming synthetic
sweeteners in both humans and rodents; however, our under-
standing of this effect has been hampered due to lack of a
molecular mechanism. Here we show that sustained sucralose
ingestion activates a conserved neural fasting response. This
response integrates pathways that govern feeding, gustatory
reward, and energy sensing that together modify how sweet
food is perceived. In conditions of fasting, or when the sensory
sweetness of food does not match the caloric content for a sus-
tained period, a compensatory response is activated that alters
taste sensitivity and feeding behavior accordingly.
Previous work has suggested that synthetic sweeteners act
through the microbiome (Suez et al., 2014) or by reducing the val-
idity of ‘‘sweetness’’ to predict caloric content (Swithers et al.,
2010). We found no role for the microbiome in our system. This
may be a result of the lower overall diversity in commensal gut
microflora in the fly compared to mammals (Wong et al., 2011).
Instead, our data support a mechanism where an imbalance of
sweetness versus caloric content of a diet simulates a fasting
state and triggers a sensory and behavioral response that in-
creases caloric consumption. These data are compatible with
a mechanism where the validity of ‘‘sweetness’’ as a means of
predicting nutritive value is flexible and is recalibrated by ingest-
ing a synthetically sweetened diet.
The discrepancy between dietary sweetness and energy is
detected at multiple levels. In the fly, insulin signaling was inte-
grated at the systems level, with insulin acting upstream of octop-
amine, dopamine, and NPF in this response. Interestingly, we
found insulin required for the orexigenic effect of sucralose, and
chronic activation of insulin-producing cells was sufficient to
mimic this effect. In mammals, the increase of circulating insulin
postprandial under normal conditions is associated with the state
of satiety, and the lack of neuronal insulin signaling has been
shown to increase food intake and obesity in rodents (Bru
¨ ning
et al., 2000). Administration of exogenous insulin directly into the
cerebroventricular system of lean rodents inhibits NPY/AgRP
neurons while simultaneously stimulating POMC neurons (Benoit
et al., 2002;Sato et al., 2005),leading toa positive energy balance.
However, specific deletion of insulin receptors from POMC or
Agrp neurons (Ko
¨ nner et al., 2007) did not reproduce the hyper-
phagic obese phenotype observed in the global neuronal insulin
receptor KO. This suggests a more complex regulatory network
of insulin action in the mouse brain, though the phenotype of ro-
dents lacking the insulin receptor specifically in NPY+ neurons re-
mains to be seen. In addition, a role for insulin in controlling the
rewarding properties of feeding has also been suggested, with
altered insulin signaling in the ventral striatum potentially leading
to inaccurate valuation of nutritive foods, leading to overcon-
sumption or the selection of foods that don’t accurately meet
the body’s current physiological needs (Woods et al., 2016).
In line with our results in the fly, exogenous administration as
well as excessive and prolonged release of insulin (like under
conditions of type 2 diabetes) paradoxically gives rise to the
sensation of hunger, which in the early phase occurs on the
background of normal glycemia. Importantly, insulin therapy
can cause weight gain, and this is most likely occurring through
increased energy intake (Ryan et al., 2008). Moreover, a role for
insulin in promoting increased food intake is also consistent with
human data, where dysregulation of the insulin system through
clamping could increase hunger, food intake, sucrose sweet-
ness intensity, and the overall perceived pleasantness of sugar
taste (Rodin et al., 1985). Similarly, we found the insulin system

 was upregulated following a sucralose diet, while glucose
tolerance was reduced, and an identical response has been
observed in rats fed a saccharin diet (Swithers et al., 2012) or hu-
mans that have consumed saccharin (Suez et al., 2014) or sucra-
lose (Pepino et al., 2013).
Prolonged ingestion of a sucralose-sweetened diet triggered
an activation of neuronal AMPK, and we found, for both fasting
and sucralose responses, AMPK was essential within dopamine-
and NPF-producing cells of the gustatory reward system. These
effects are similar to data from the mammalian system, where
activation of neuronal AMPK in the hypothalamus has also
been shown to increase appetite and regulate NPY expression
in response to starvation (Minokoshi et al., 2004). Mammalian
NPY is a potent regulator of food intake, especially during food
deprivation, and is a critical mediator of insulin’s control on
whole body energy homeostasis (Loh et al., 2015). Through our
systematic dissection of the sucralose response in flies, we
identified the conserved NPF/NPY system as a critical down-
stream component of the sucralose response and confirmed a
conserved role for NPY in promoting food intake in response to
sucralose-sweetened food.
Despite inclusion in thousands of products, and consumption
by billions of people, the molecular effects of ingesting syntheti-
cally sweetened food are not well understood. Moreover, there
is conflicting evidence from both human and animal studies as
to whether or not synthetic sweeteners interact with overall phys-
iology or regulation of energy homeostasis. Our results show that
prolonged consumption of a sucralose-sweetened diet promotes
hunger and changes how animals perceive nutritive sugar. This
involves layered neuronal regulation through conserved meta-
bolic regulatory pathways that we report are also novel compo-
nents of a neuronal response to fasting. Importantly, in mice,
NPY was also critical to mediate increased food intake following
chronic ingestion of sucralose-sweetened food, and a similar
mechanism may also mediate these effects in humans.

Supplemental
Information.
Fly Strains
Fly stocks were maintained on standard diet and were raised in 25�C incubator
with a 12/12 light/dark cycle. See detailed fly stock information in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Diet Conditioning
3- to 7-day-old male flies were fed with control diet ± sucralose (Sigma,
#69293) for indicated time. The control diet was made from 1% agar, 5.4%
sucrose, and 3.6% yeast. Sucralose diet was made from the control diet
plus sucralose (2.5%). Unless otherwise stated, conditioning with sucralose
diet occurred for 6 days. In the experiments involving conditioning with sucra-
lose diet then rest on control diet, flies were fed with sucralose diet for 6 days
and then were transferred to control diet for 1 or 3 days. For the excessive
nutritive sweetness experiment, flies were fed control diet plus additional
5.4% (23) or 10.8% (33) sucrose for 6 days. For the sorbitol rescue experi-
ment, flies were fed with control diet plus sorbitol (1%) or sucralose diet plus
sorbitol (1%) for 6 days. Flies were transferred into fresh vials every 2 to 3 days.
Feeding Assay
Food intake was measured by CAFE assay, which was modified from previous
studies (Ja et al., 2007). In all cases, food intake was measured over 24 hr.
Empty vials were used for evaporation controls. All food intake experiments
were set up at Zeitgeber time 6–8, and food intake was recorded exactly
24 hr after start of food loading.
PER Assay
For PER responses after sucralose-sweetened diet, flies were pretreated with
control or sucralose-sweetened diet for 6 days, and then PER assay was per-
formed as described (Masek and Keene, 2013).
Electrophysical Recording
Tip recordings were performed on flies that were pretreated with or without
sucralose diet for 6 days (Figure 5) or after 6 hr of fasting (Figure 7). Three to
five L-type labellar bristles were recorded on each fly.
RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis
Fifty fly heads were collected at day 0 or day 6 (6 days sucralose treatment).
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies, #10296010) and then
sequenced by Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. Gene expression level was calculated
using RPKM (Reads Per kb per Million reads). Transcripts with Log2 ratio > 1,
FDR < 0.001 were considered differentially regulated.
Western Blot
Fly heads were collected and homogenized in PBS with Roche protease in-
hibitors cocktail. Western blot was performed according to a standard proto-
col. Rabbit-anti-AMPKa (Cell signaling, #2532), Rabbit-anti-pAMPKa172 (Cell
signaling, #2535). Secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 in 10,000
(BioRad). Qualification was performed using Image J software.
Mouse Food Intake
All animals experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant guide-
lines and regulations. 10-week-old female wild-type (C57BL/6) and NPY�/�
mice (on a C57BL/6 background) were fed with a piece of jelly (vehicle group)
or jelly containing 7.5 mg of sucralose (sucralose group) daily for 7 days. Food
intake was determined using Promethion metabolic cages (PromethionTM
Line, Sable Systems International, NV USA).

Response
(A) Flies fed excessive nutritive sweetness (sucrose) for 6 days exhibit decreased food intake; n R 20.
(B) Addition of the tasteless but nutritive sugar sorbitol to the sucralose diet was sufficient to suppress the sucralose-mediated increased feeding response; n R 18.
(C) 6 days of sucralose-sweetened diet caused increased phosphorylated AMPK.
(D) Pan-neuronal AMPK knockdown abolished changes in feeding; n R 15.
(E) Inducible pan-neuronal knockdown of AMPK blocked the sucralose-mediated increased food intake; flies raised at 18�C and tested at 29�C; n R 10.
(F) Pan-neuronal AMPK knockdown abolished changes in PER; n R 3.
(G) Knockdown of AMPK in dopaminergic neurons or NPF+ neurons blocked increased feeding from a sweetened diet; n R 13.
(H and I) Knockdown of AMPK in (H) dopaminergic or (I) NPF+ neurons blocked increased PER after a sucralose diet; n R 3.
(J) A working model of how prolonged ingestion of a synthetically sweetened, calorically sufficient diet alters taste perception and feeding behavior. Sucralose
triggers a response through the insulin system that requires octopamine-, dopamine-, and NPF-producing neurons to alter sweet taste perception and promote
hunger. Moreover, this system involves the cell-autonomous energy sensor AMPK acting within Dop+ and NPF+ neurons. Data represented as mean ± SEM.
Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test was used for all PER data, one-way ANOVA with Turkey’s multiple comparisons test was used for food
intake data, and unpaired t test for western blot data. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001. n.s., not significant. See also Figure S4 and Table S1.
