 characteristics. We used quantitative molecular diagnostic methods to reassess causes of diarrhoea 
in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS).
Methods—GEMS was a study of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years 
in Africa and Asia. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to test for 32 enteropathogens in 
stool samples from cases and matched asymptomatic controls from GEMS, and compared 
pathogen-specific attributable incidences with those found with the original GEMS 
microbiological methods, including culture, EIA, and reverse-transcriptase PCR. We calculated 
revised pathogen-specific burdens of disease and assessed causes in individual children.
Findings—We analysed 5304 sample pairs. For most pathogens, incidence was greater with 
qPCR than with the original methods, particularly for adenovirus 40/41 (around five times), 
Shigella spp or enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and Campylobactor jejuni or C coli (around 
two times), and heat-stable enterotoxin-producing E coli ([ST-ETEC] around 1·5 times). The six 
most attributable pathogens became, in descending order, Shigella spp, rotavirus, adenovirus 
40/41, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium spp, and Campylobacter spp. Pathogen-attributable diarrhoeal 
burden was 89·3% (95% CI 83·2–96·0) at the population level, compared with 51·5% (48·0–55·0) 
in the original GEMS analysis. The top six pathogens accounted for 77·8% (74·6–80·9) of all 
attributable diarrhoea. With use of model-derived quantitative cutoffs to assess individual 
diarrhoeal cases, 2254 (42·5%) of 5304 cases had one diarrhoea-associated pathogen detected and 
2063 (38·9%) had two or more, with Shigella spp and rotavirus being the pathogens most strongly 
associated with diarrhoea in children with mixed infections.
Interpretation—A quantitative molecular diagnostic approach improved population-level and 
case-level characterisation of the causes of diarrhoea and indicated a high burden of disease 
associated with six pathogens, for which targeted treatment should be prioritised.
Funding—Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Introduction
Diarrhoea remains the second leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years 
worldwide, being associated with around 500 000 deaths per year, and ranks sixth in global 
disability-adjusted life-year burden.1–3 Public health interventions rely on estimates of 
pathogen-specific burden for prioritisation. Previous estimates of the infectious causes of 
diarrhoea have been derived from studies that used varying approaches for pathogen 
detection,4 including different media, stool concentration techniques, and detection methods, 
from microscopy to antigen detection to PCR. Each method has its own sensitivity, which 
could substantially affect burden estimates. Furthermore, asymptomatic carriage of some 
enteropathogens is common in children living in developing countries, for which few studies 
have attempted to control.5–7 The quantity of nucleic acid is thought to distinguish clinical 
disease from asymptomatic shedding.8–14
We have shown previously that quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches could detect 
bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens across multiple laboratories with high sensitivity and 
good reproducibility and quantification.15 We therefore did this reanalysis of specimens 
from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), which was a large case-control study of 
moderate to severe diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years in Africa and Asia,6 to inform

 estimates of the global burden of disease.3 We aimed to reassess estimates of pathogen-
specific diarrhoea causes and incidence at the population level, and to provide a case-level 
understanding of mixed diarrhoeal infections.
Methods
Samples
GEMS samples were obtained from regions in seven countries in Asia (Bangladesh, India, 
and Pakistan) and Africa (The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, and Mozambique).6 These countries 
were chosen to represent a range of child health indicators and urban and rural settings, and 
because they have sufficient research infrastructures.6,16 Each country provided a population 
census via a demographic surveillance system to enable estimation of population-level 
incidence of diarrhoea. Inclusion criteria for cases were three or more loose stools within 24 
h and onset of the episode within the previous 7 days, after at least 7 days free from 
diarrhoea, and with at least one of sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, intravenous hydration, 
dysentery, or hospital admission. Three age strata were assessed: infants (0–11 months), 
toddlers (12–23 months), and children (24–59 months). At least one control without 
diarrhoea in the previous 7 days, matched for age (within 2 months for patients aged 0–23 
months and within 4 months for patients aged 24–59 months), sex, and residence (same or 
nearby village or neighbourhood), was enrolled within 14 days of each index case.
The original study enrolled 9439 children with diarrhoea and 13 129 children without 
diarrhoea. The microbiological diagnostic methods used in GEMS had included culture for 
bacteria, EIA for rotavirus, adenovirus, and protozoa, and multiplex reverse-transcriptase 
PCR (RT-PCR) with gel electrophoresis for norovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus.6 For this 
study, we retested up to 300 randomly selected cases and the first available matched controls 
from each age stratum and study site. Stool specimens had been collected between 
December, 2007, and March, 2011, and stored at –80°C until testing. Ethics approval for this 
study was obtained from the University of Maryland, MD, USA, all field sites, and the 
University of Virginia, VA, USA.
Procedures
We assessed all enteropathogens associated with diarrhoea in the original GEMS as well as 
those detected by molecular methods that had a possible association with diarrhoea in 
univariate analysis. We formulated a custom TaqMan Array Card (Thermo Fisher, Carlsblad, 
CA, USA) that compartmentalised probe-based qPCR assays for 32 enteropathogens. This 
platform has shown high reproducibility within and across sites.15 All the assays have been 
described previously and have been extensively validated (appendix).15,17,18 Nucleic acid 
was extracted with the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 
pretreatment steps that included bead beating.18 We added two external controls, 
bacteriophage MS2 and phocine herpesvirus, to monitor efficiency of nucleic-acid extraction 
and amplification. We included one extraction blank per batch and one no-template 
amplification control per three cards to exclude laboratory contamination (appendix).

 Case and control samples were tested simultaneously. Quantification cycles (Cqs) are the 
PCR cycle values at which fluorescence from amplification exceeds the background, which 
acts as an inverse metric of quantity of nucleic acid. All detections with a Cq greater than 35 
were deemed negative.15 Valid results required proper functioning of controls and excluded 
data flagged by the PCR software ViiA 7 (version 1.2.4, appendix). Pathogen target copy 
numbers were calculated (appendix). In a subset of 150 case-control pairs in the 12–23 
month age group from each of India, Mali, and Mozambique, confirmatory qPCR assays 
were done to verify detection of Shigella spp or enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) and 
identify Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei (appendix).
Statistical analysis
We retained the conceptual framework and analytical approach used in the original study.6,19 
Specifically, we used population attributable fractions to adjust for the high prevalence of 
asymptomatic pathogen carriage. For all analyses, we used the Cq values as inverse 
measures of pathogen quantity, where a one-unit increase corresponded to a two times 
decrease in quantity. We then estimated pathogen-specific burdens of diarrhoea by 
calculating attributable fractions, which incorporated the prevalence of the pathogen in cases 
and the strength of association between the pathogen quantity and case or control status.20 
Association strength for each pathogen was estimated by calculation of odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95% CIs in a multivariable conditional logistic regression model, where the outcome 
was case or control status and predictors were pathogen quantity, the quantity of other 
pathogens, a random slope for each study site, and an interaction between pathogen and age 
stratum. We hypothesised that the relation between pathogen quantity and case or control 
status could be non-linear and, therefore, included a quadratic term for pathogen quantity, 
which maintained or improved model fit for all pathogens, as assessed by the Akaike 
information criterion. We also considered power and spline models but rejected them on the 
basis of model fit. Attributable fractions were calculated by summing pathogen attributions 
across each of j cases with the following equation:
where AFi = 1/j×(1–1/ORi). 95% CIs were estimated by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. 
Attributable incidence rates were calculated from the attributable fractions.6 We extrapolated 
attributable fractions to pathogen-specific population attributable incidence, using the 
incidence of moderate to severe diarrhoea from demographic surveillance. To identify 
model-derived Cq cutoff values for detection of diarrhoea-associated pathogens that were 
independent of age, we fitted models that excluded the interaction between pathogen and age 
group but were otherwise identical to those used for the attributable fraction calculations. 
We then defined a pathogen as being diarrhoea associated if it was detected at a quantity for 
which the lower 95% CI of the OR exceeded 1. We used Wilcoxon's rank sum test to 
examine whether the quantity of Shigella spp or EIEC was different when detected in 
dysenteric cases. All analyses were done in R version 3.2.2.

Results
We tested 11 400 specimens from 5700 cases and matched controls in five laboratories that 
showed good assay reproducibility (table 1). Identical positive-control constructs were 
provided to all laboratories, with consistent results for assay linearity (appendix). Valid 
results were obtained from 5304 (93·1%) matched case-control pairs (table 1). When 
compared with qPCR, the original diagnostic methods showed low and variable sensitivity 
but high specificity (98% [SD 2%], appendix).15 Samples positive by the original diagnostic 
methods had higher quantities with molecular testing methods than did originally negative 
samples, across all 16 pathogens detected in the original study.
Shigella spp or EIEC, adenovirus 40/41, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, and heat-stable 
enterotoxin-producing E coli (ST-ETEC) had high prevalence and strong quantity-dependent 
associations with diarrhoea (figure 1). Campylobacter jejuni or C coli, sapovirus, and typical 
enteropathogenic E coli (tEPEC) were also highly prevalent, but even at the highest 
quantities were only moderately associated with diarrhoea. Norovirus GII, Helicobacter 
pylori, astrovirus, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp, Cyclospora cayetanensis, and Entamoeba 
histolytica also showed associations with diarrhoea but prevalence was low (figure 1). 
Entero aggregative E coli and Aeromonas spp were associated with diarrhoea only in 
specific study sites or age strata (enteroaggregative E coli was associated with diarrhoea 
only in the 12–13 months age group in Mozambique; Aeromonas spp was associated with 
diarrhoea only in the 0–11 months age group in Pakistan and in the 24–59 months age group 
in Pakistan, Mozambique, and Bangladesh). Cystoisospora belli was associated only with 
dysentery. All other enteropathogens tested were not associated with diarrhoea at any 
quantity or site or in any age group (appendix). The quantitative relations were robust across 
age groups (appendix).
Compared with the original microbiological methods, more pathogens were attributed as 
causes of diarrhoea, with more consistent attribution across sites. When assessed by age 
strata and study site, the pathogens with the highest attributable fractions for childhood 
diarrhoea were Shigella spp or EIEC, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and 
Cryptosporidium spp (table 2). Shigella spp or EIEC, rotavirus, and ST-ETEC were 
consistently high across all age groups and regions. Cryptosporidium spp and adenovirus 
40/41 were most evident in children up to age 23 months and the prevalence of H pylori was 
notable in children aged 24 months and older. C jejuni or C coli were particularly important 
causes in infants at the Bangladesh, India, Mali, and Mozambique sites. Estimates were 
robust irrespective of whether raw Cqs or those adjusted to standard curves and external 
controls to derive a pathogen target copy number were used (appendix).
For most pathogens, the qPCR-derived attributable incidence surpassed the original estimate, 
including for adenovirus 40/41 (by around five times), Shigella spp or EIEC and C jejuni or

 C coli (around two times), and ST-ETEC (around 1·5 times; figure 2). With few exceptions, 
the increase in attribution for these pathogens was consistent across study sites (appendix). 
For rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp, the attributable incidence remained similar to the 
original estimates (obtained with EIA). In infants, six pathogens had the greatest attributable 
incidence: in descending order, rotavirus (7·9 episodes per 100 child-years, 95% CI 6·2–9·7), 
adenovirus 40/41 (3·9, 2·4–5·4), Cryptosporidium spp (3·3, 2·2–4·4), C jejuni or C coli (2·4, 
1·3–3·4), Shigella spp or EIEC (2·0, 1·4–2·6), and ST-ETEC (2·0, 1·4–2·6). In toddlers, the 
hierarchy was Shigella or EIEC (7·0, 5·0–9·0), rotavirus (4·1, 3·0–5·1), adenovirus 40/41 
(1·8, 0·9–2·6), ST-ETEC (1·7, 1·1–2·3), and Cryptosporidium spp (1·5, 0·8–2·2). In older 
children, Shigella or EIEC was the dominant pathogen (2·3, 1·2–3·4). By qPCR, 89·3% 
(95% CI 83·2–96·0) of diarrhoeal episodes at the population level were attributable to a 
pathogen, as compared with 51·5% (48·0–55·0) by the original workup. Shigella spp, 
rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, heat-stable enterotoxin-producing E coli, Cryptosporidium spp, 
and Campylobacter spp together accounted for 77·8% (74·6–80·9) of all attributable 
diarrhoea.
To further understand the increase in burden attributable to Shigella spp or EIEC, we 
examined the qPCR and culture results by site. Attribution was higher at all study sites with 
qPCR than with the previous diagnostic methods, but to a lesser degree in Bangladesh than 
in the others, which was due mainly to high quantities of Shigella spp and high sensitivity of 
the culture at that site (appendix).
Among analysed diarrhoeal episodes, 4077 (76·9%) of 5304 were described as being watery, 
and gross blood was reported as being seen in 1227 (23·1%). As expected, Shigella spp or 
EIEC was the dominant pathogen associated with dysentery (attributable fraction 63·8%, 
95% CI 61·6–68·0), but was also associated with the second-highest burden of watery 
diarrhoea (12·9%, 11·0–16·4, figure 3), and, overall, 527·7 (40·3%) of 1310·3 attributable 
cases of diarrhoea attributable to Shigella spp or EIEC were non-dysenteric. Generally, 
quantities of Shigella spp or EIEC in dysentery cases were higher than those in cases of 
watery diarrhoea (mean Cq 22·0 [4·6] vs 26·2 [5·8], p<0·0001; appendix). Confirmation of 
Shigella spp or EIEC detection in 450 case-control pairs showed similar attributable 
fractions with different PCR targets (appendix). Additionally, qPCR for gene regions 
specific to S flexneri and S sonnei showed these species account for more than 70% of all 
Shigella spp or EIEC attributable fractions. Adenovirus 40/41 and C jejuni or C coli were 
also associated with a substantial burden of dysentery (attributable fractions 10·4%, 95% CI 
4·5–16·7 and 7·8%, 5·5–12·9, respectively; these estimates control for the presence of other 
pathogens, such as Shigella spp).
The original GEMS microbiology interrogated for ST-ETEC producing the STh subtype 
(STh-ETEC) and heat-labile enterotoxin-producing E coli (LT-ETEC), but not ST-ETEC 
producing the STp subtype, which might have led to underestimation of the burden for ST-
ETEC. qPCR showed that most of the burden was attributable to the STh subtype and was 
mainly evident at specific study sites (appendix). Inclusion of STp subtype in the definition 
of ST-ETEC increased the overall burden estimates for this pathogen by 15%. There was 
essentially no burden attributable to LT-ETEC, and the presence of heat-labile enterotoxin 
did not modify the strength of the association between ST-ETEC producing the STh subtype

 and case or control status (with heat-labile enterotoxin, OR 0·92, 95% CI 0·74–1·13). 
Therefore, to be consistent with the original study, we categorised ST-ETEC producing the 
STh subtype with or without heat-labile enterotoxin. In 249 (43·9%) of 505 samples in 
which ST-ETEC producing STh subtype was detected in diarrhoea-associated quantities, 
heat-labile enterotoxin was detected in similarly high quantities, which suggests that these 
infections might be due to both toxins and the remainder were due to ST-ETEC producing 
STh subtype only.
To examine the causes of diarrhoea in individual children, we identified model-derived 
quantitative cutoffs for diarrhoea association (figure 1, appendix). Diarrhoea-associated 
quantities varied greatly by pathogen, ranging from 7·3 × 103 copies per g of stool for V 
cholerae to 2·7 × 109 copies per g for tEPEC. For the subset of 15 pathogens for which 
cutoff values could be identified, at least one was detected at a diarrhoea-associated quantity 
in 4317 (81·4%) of 5304 cases (one in 2254 [42·5%] and more than one in 2063 [38·9%]; 
figure 4). Combining all study sites and age strata, Shigella spp or EIEC was the most 
frequent cause, followed by adenovirus 40/41, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, and ST-
ETEC (figure 4). In 1517 (79·6%) of 1905 cases in which Shigella spp or EIEC and 984 
(84·2%) of 1168 in which rotavirus was present in diarrhoea-associated quantities, these 
were the primary pathogens (ie, the only diarrhoea-associated pathogen or at a quantity that 
delivered the highest diarrhoea association). The predominance of Cryptosporidium spp and 
ST-ETEC was slightly less (313 [58·0%] of 540 and 332 [65·6%] of 506 cases, respectively). 
The opposite was seen for adenovirus 40/41, which in most cases (1070 [71·4%] of 1499), 
even at diarrhoea-associated quantities, occurred with pathogens more strongly associated 
with diarrhoea (appendix). In general, we saw no preferential co-occurrence between 
particular diarrhoea-associated pathogens, although Shigella spp or EIEC was frequently 
identified as a diarrhoea-associated co-infection when H pylori was detected as the primary 
diarrhoea-associated pathogen (appendix). In many samples, quantities of C jejuni or C coli, 
tEPEC, H pylori, Cryptosporidium spp, ST-ETEC, and norovirus GII were low and the 
pathogens were not associated with diarrhoea.
Discussion
In this reanalysis of the causes of diarrhoea in GEMS, we have shown with a quantitative 
molecular diagnostic approach that the estimated burdens of Shigella spp, adenovirus 40/41, 
ST-ETEC, and C jejuni or C coli were underestimated with the original diagnostic methods. 
By contrast, estimates for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp, for which detection was based 
on EIA diagnostics, changed little. These six pathogen groups were responsible for 77·8% of 
attributable diarrhoea in this study and, therefore, targeted interventions could have larger 
public health benefits than previously projected.4
The increases in estimated burden were a function of improved sensitivity with molecular 
diagnostics and the higher resolution provided by pathogen quantification. Previous studies 
of the causes of diarrhoea have generally used non-quantitative diagnostics, which yield 
dichotomous results at detection limits that might not be clinically relevant. Such results 
become potentially problematic for the study of causes of diarrhoea in children in resource-
limited settings because the rate of enteropathogen carriage shortly after birth is high.7,21

 We identified a high burden of diarrhoea attributable to Shigella spp or EIEC, which we 
suspect is due to the fastidious nature of this pathogen in culture, particularly when 
quantities are low and in areas where antibiotics are frequently used. Underdetection of 
Shigella spp by culture compared with PCR has been seen in various settings 
worldwide.8,22–25 The ipaH target has been widely used for detection of Shigella spp, and its 
presence has only been described in Shigella spp and EIEC, both of which genera are highly 
similar at the DNA level.26 Nevertheless, EIEC has not been a major diarrhoea-associated 
pathogen in similar settings.7 The detection of additional gene regions clarified that Shigella 
spp explained most of the burden estimate. Shigella spp were particularly associated with 
dysentery, which was a case definition inclusion criterion in GEMS and was common at the 
Bangladesh site, but were also notably associated with watery diarrhoea across all study 
sites, which raises questions about the treatment guidelines for infection with Shigella spp, 
which emphasise the presence of blood in stools as an indication.27 The higher quantities of 
Shigella spp in samples from children who had dysentery than in those who had watery 
diarrhoea without a diagnosis of dysentery supports previous findings26 and suggests that 
watery diarrhoea might indicate a less advanced stage of this disease. Development of a 
vaccine against Shigella spp is underway, and these findings and the high detection rate in 
samples in this study suggest that it should be prioritised. Vaccination of children early in 
life could be beneficial.
The importance of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp was reaffirmed, with burden estimates 
being similar to those in the original study, whereas the importance of ST-ETEC and 
Campylobacter spp was increased. The association of adenovirus 40/41 with diarrhoea has 
been noted previously,28 including by use of EIA in the original GEMS study,6 but 
molecular diagnostics revealed a substantially higher prevalence and retained diarrhoea 
association. Our array card for qPCR did detect panadenovirus of any serotype, but this was 
not associated with diarrhoea after controlling for the presence of adenovirus 40/41. The 
association of H pylori with diarrhoea was unexpected. This pathogen has been reported in 
children with diarrhoea, most often those with chronic diarrhoea or hypochlorhydria,29,30 
but other studies have identified no risk or suggested protection.31,32 We found frequent co-
infection with H pylori and Shigella spp, which has been reported previously33 and suggests 
that infection with H pylori could be a risk factor for infection with Shigella spp. Further 
study is needed to understand the role of H pylori in diarrhoea.
By identifying model-derived quantitative cutoff values for detection of diarrhoea-associated 
pathogens, we were able to describe the causes of diarrhoea in individual children, which is 
crucial for clinical diagnosis or case definitions. Quantitative cutoffs have previously been 
described for tEPEC, norovirus GII, and rotavirus,9–14 mostly in comparisons of quantities 
in cases versus controls, but those studies involved fewer samples and did not adjust for 
other pathogens or provide the resolution afforded by the present analytical methods. We 
were able to identify cutoff values for 15 pathogens. This approach worked well for most 
pathogens but less so for others. For example, Campylobacter spp had weak but significant 
associations with diarrhoea that yielded poorly discriminatory quantitative cutoff values 
despite a substantial burden in the overall population due to the high prevalence of this 
group of pathogens. The cutoffs associated with diarrhoea in this study varied by pathogen.

 previously estimated from a subset of GEMS sites of approximately 107 copies per g of 
stool.8 We found a slightly lower value of 2 × 106 copies per g. The quantitative relations we 
identified were reasonably generalisable across age groups for the pathogens with the 
greatest attributions and, therefore, these cutoff values should be useful for future studies 
when control stools are not available.
More than 80% of samples revealed pathogens at diarrhoea-associated quantities, which is a 
much greater diagnostic yield than has been found with routine microbiological 
methods.4,34,35 Among those containing a diarrhoea-associated pathogen, roughly half had 
more than one. This extent of mixed infections, even after filtering out probable 
asymptomatic infections, was substantial. Some pathogens, such as Shigella spp and 
rotavirus, were most frequently detected as sole pathogens in diarrhoea-associated 
quantities, meaning that misattribution of diarrhoea to these pathogens would be uncommon. 
Many other pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium spp, ST-ETEC, norovirus GII, adenovirus 
40/41, and Campylobacter spp, were not detected in diarrhoea-associated quantities or 
present in quantities associated with diarrhoea but with other pathogens that showed stronger 
associations (figure 4). This finding underscores the difficulty in attributing diarrhoea to 
such pathogens without quantification or considering other pathogens. It will also challenge 
vaccine trials, because efficacy would be underestimated if a non-quantitative PCR result 
were used that might over-attribute diarrhoea to the pathogen of interest. For such trials, 
more stringent quantitative cutoffs could be applied, for example using the quantity of the 
highly diarrhoea-associated ST-ETEC to improve the specificity of the case definition for 
ETEC-associated diarrhoea (appendix). Other criteria, such as clinical severity scores or 
inflammatory markers, could be assessed to see whether they increase the specificity of 
detection.
Achieving optimum clinical management in the era of molecular diagnostic panels for 
enteropathogens is a work in progress. Commonly available commercial panels are 
qualitative PCR-based tests that do not distinguish between low-level enteropathogen 
detection of unclear relevance and infections that are more clearly clinically important.36 For 
example, detection of the Clostridium difficile toxin gene by PCR in the setting of a negative 
toxin EIA is not clinically relevant.37 We believe that the quantitative cutoff concept we have 
assessed will be helpful, although it places additional requirements on commercial assay 
developers, and the exact cutoffs used might depend on the clinical setting. Management 
guidelines for acute diarrhoea recommend supportive care with rehydration and zinc 
supplementation without antibiotics unless signs are indicative of dysentery or cholera is 
suspected,27 but could be adapted as pathogen-specific diagnosis improves and hopefully 
becomes more widely available. For a high-mortality entity, such as childhood diarrhoea, an 
overly stringent cutoff could lead to underdiagnosis of treatable causes. Thus further 
assessment of quantitative cutoff values for clinical care is needed, along with studies that 
assess therapeutic response, for instance whether treatment of diarrhoea associated with 
Shigella spp in children in low-resource settings that is negative to culture but positive on 
PCR improves outcomes. The necessity of treating multiple pathogens during mixed 
infection is also unknown. Finally, the existing quantitative PCR assays for enteropathogens 
do not assess antimicrobial resistance and, therefore, for now these emerging molecular 
technologies should ideally be used in conjunction with conventional culture methods.

 This study had some limitations. The quantitative approach, while incrementally useful, will 
inherently function less well for pathogens that are shed with high frequency, in high 
quantities, and for an extended duration in the absence of diarrhoea. Longitudinal studies 
might further refine understanding for such pathogens. Theoretically, the sum of the 
attributable fractions for individual pathogens can be greater than 100%, although this 
possibility is the same for estimates derived from molecular and non-molecular diagnostic 
approaches, and is implicit in any clinical entity with co-infections. Although GEMS was 
carefully designed to study the causes of diarrhoea and the study sites were broadly 
representative of countries with moderate to high mortality in children younger than 5 years, 
some heterogeneity in the hierarchy of pathogens was noted between sites. Generalisability, 
therefore, should be audited by local epidemiology. Finally, vaccine development often relies 
on speciation and subtyping of infections,38 and our molecular assays did not provide such 
information.
This reanalysis of the causes of diarrhoea in young children by use of molecular diagnostic 
methods substantially increased attribution at the population level and clinical diagnostic 
yields. We found a high burden of diarrhoea associated with six main pathogens: Shigella 
spp, rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium spp, and Campylobacter spp. 
Mixed infection with diarrhoea-associated pathogens was common and has implications for 
vaccine efficacy trials, responses to treatments, and the clinical diagnosis of pathogen-
specific diarrhoea.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed relevant studies on the cause of diarrhoea, identified by searching PubMed 
with the terms “PCR” and “diarrhoea/diarrhea”. We did not restrict our search by 
language, date, or age group. We identified 4258 reports, of which only 216 described 
case-control studies (to control for asymptomatic carriage) and 17 that assessed pathogen 
quantity. Quantitative case-control analyses on rotavirus, norovirus GII, diarrhoeagenic 
Escherichia coli, and Shigella spp were done in six studies, but either involved only one 
pathogen or a panel of enteropathogens at only one study site.
Added value of this study
This study of diarrhoea aetiology used quantitative molecular diagnostics for 32 
enteropathogens in multiple study sites, with cases and controls. Through this approach 
we were able to reveal each pathogen's relative importance at the population level and in 
individual children.
Implications of all the available evidence
Use of quantitative real-time PCR led to revised estimates of global diarrhoeal burden. 
The most attributable pathogens were, in descending order, Shigella spp, rotavirus, 
adenovirus 40/41, heat-stable enterotoxin-producing E coli, Cryptosporidium spp, and 
Campylobacter spp, which together accounted for 78% of all attributable diarrhoea. 
Interventions targeting these pathogens should be prioritised.

Attributable fractions are shown as the percentage of cases for each age stratum and study site with 95% CIs, listed in descending order of overall value. All pathogens with attributable fractions >0 for each 
combination of age stratum and site are shown. Only attributable fraction CIs that exceed 0 are significant. EAEC=enteroaggregative E coli. EIEC=enteroinvasive E coli. tEPEC=typical enteropathogenic E 
coli. LT-ETEC=heat-labile enterotoxin-producing E coli. ST-ETEC=STh-producing enterotoxigenic E coli.
