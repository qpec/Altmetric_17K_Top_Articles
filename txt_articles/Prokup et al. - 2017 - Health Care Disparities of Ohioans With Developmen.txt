Health Care Disparities of Ohioans With Developmental 
Disabilities Across the Lifespan
ABSTRACT
We explored health care differences across the lifespan comparing people with 
developmental disabilities to people without developmental disabilities. Health 
care disparities are inequities occurring during the provision of and in access to 
health care that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations. We dis-
covered significant disparities between persons with and without developmental 
disabilities in health status, quality, utilization, access, and unmet health care 
needs. Our results highlight the need to educate health care clinicians on the 
care of patients with developmental disabilities of all ages.

INTRODUCTION
D
evelopmental disability training is lacking in medicine and public 
health even though this population has major health needs and 
poor health outcomes. Developmental disabilities are severe, 
chronic conditions that impair cognitive and/or physical functioning, are 
manifest before the age of 22 years, result in functional limitations in at 
least 3 major activities of daily living, and require assistance throughout 
the lifespan.1 Transitioning from pediatric to adult care can be challenging 
for young adults with developmental disabilities because of their increased 
health and support needs.2-4 Unfortunately, the health needs of adults with 
developmental disabilities are rarely addressed in medical training. Using 
Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey (OMAS) data, we explored differences 
on a range of health indicators between populations of those who have 
developmental disabilities and those do not across their lifespans.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the 2015 OMAS. 
This stratified, random digit-dialing telephone survey is designed to col-
lect health and health care data from Ohio’s Medicaid and non-Medicaid 
populations. In 2015, researchers completed 42,876 interviews with adults 
and 10,122 proxy interviews for children aged 0 to 18 years (completed 
by the adult most knowledgeable about the child’s health). The OMAS 
uses single imputation to handle missing data; all indicators used had fewer 
than 10% missing responses. Details on the survey design are available 
elsewhere.5
We constructed 2 mutually exclusive groups, (those who had develop-
mental disabilities and those who did not), which were further subdivided 
by age: children (0 to 18 years), those in health care transition (19 to 30 
years), adults (31 to 64 years), and older adults (65 years and older). A suc-
cessful health care transition requires finding appropriate adult medical and 
specialty health care. This effort is challenging for young adults with dis-
abilities, as many clinicians who treat older adults are uncomfortable caring 
for this population. Consequently, many young adults with disabilities con-
tinue to see pediatric clinicians well into adulthood.6 Consistent with previ-

ous studies,7 we defined health 
care transition as ranging from 
19 to 30 years to fully capture 
young adults with developmen-
tal disabilities in transition.
The group comprised chil-
dren whose adult proxy replied 
yes to each of the following 
questions: (1) Does [child] cur-
rently have a developmental 
disability? (2) Is [child] limited 
or prevented in any way in 
[his/her] ability to do things 
most children of the same age 
can do? (3) Is this because of 
any medical, behavioral or 
other health condition? (4) Is 
this a condition that has lasted 
or is expected to last for at least 
12 months? A response of no to 
any of these questions resulted 
in the child being assigned to 
the no disability group.9
The adult survey ques-
tionnaire was administered 
to individuals aged 19 years 
and older and was completed 
by a proxy, if necessary. 
Adults were assigned to the 
developmental disability 
group if they endorsed hav-
ing developmental disabilities 
and reported at least 1 special 
health care need, including 
needing assistance with activi-
ties of daily living or receiving 
special therapies, treatment, 
or counseling.8 The special 
health care need requirement 
was intended to capture those 
persons meeting criteria for 
the federal definition of devel-
opmental disabilities. Respon-
dents were classified to the no 
disability group if they denied 
having developmental dis-
abilities or denied having any 
special health care needs.
Statistical Analyses
We conducted bivariate com-
parisons between the 2 groups 
on selected health indicators.

the OMAS public release data 
to produce population-level 
estimates. The Rao-Scott 
χ2 test was used to test for 
associations. Because the 
adult and child survey ques-
tions were similar, we were 
able to compare health indi-
cators across the different 
age-groups. All analyses were 
conducted in SAS version 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc).
RESULTS
Demographic information by 
age-group and disability status 
can be found in Supplemental 
Table 1 at http://www.annfa-
mmed.org/content/15/5/471/
suppl/DC1. Study findings 
are reported in Table 1; key 
findings are summarized here. 
Adults with developmental 
disabilities were less likely to 
have a primary care clinician 
that spends enough time with 
them compared with a peer 
group without developmental 
disabilities of the same age. 
Among those with devel-
opmental disabilities, older 
adults were the least likely to 
have clinicians who explained 
things well (83.0%). People 
with developmental disabilities 
in all 4 age-groups experi-
enced access barriers, particu-
larly having problems getting 
needed care and delayed treat-
ment. Finally, children and 
older adults with developmen-
tal disabilities experienced the 
greatest disparities in unmet 
health care needs.
DISCUSSION 
We found significant health 
care disparities for those with 
developmental disabilities in 
all 4 age-groups. Although 
previous research highlighted 
the difficulty in transitioning

from pediatric to adult care for young adults with dis-
abilities,6 we did not find the young adult age-group 
(19 to 30 years) to have unique health care disparities. 
These findings highlight the importance of disability 
competency for health care clinicians. Health equity 
in care quality and unmet health care needs may be 
achieved by incorporating disability education into 
the undergraduate medical curriculum. Unfortunately, 
81% of medical students reported having had no clini-
cal training in disabilities,9 and 58% of medical school 
deans reported that a curriculum for patients with 
disabilities was not a high priority.10 Physicians in prac-
tice and in training have shown inadequacies in their 
knowledge of disabilities.10
This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, 
the requirement of spoken English or Spanish, and 
Ohio residency. Despite careful weighting, response 
bias and inconsistencies related to self-reported data 
may have occurred.
With advances in medicine, persons with devel-
opmental disabilities are living much longer; medical 
education, however, has not changed accordingly. 
To reduce the health care disparities experienced by 
adults and children with disabilities, medical schools 
should incorporate training specific to developmental 
disabilities into their curricula.
