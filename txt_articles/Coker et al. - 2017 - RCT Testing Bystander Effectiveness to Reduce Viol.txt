Introduction: Bystander-based programs have shown promise to reduce interpersonal violence at
colleges, yet limited rigorous evaluations have addressed bystander intervention effectiveness in high
schools. This study evaluated the Green Dot bystander intervention to reduce sexual violence and
related forms of interpersonal violence in 26 high schools over 5 years.
Design: A cluster RCT was conducted.
Setting/participants: Kentucky high schools were randomized to intervention or control (wait
list) conditions.
Intervention: Green Dot�trained educators conducted schoolwide presentations and recruited student
popular opinion leaders to receive bystander training in intervention schools beginning in Year 1.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was sexual violence perpetration, and related
forms of interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration were also measured using
anonymous student surveys collected at baseline and annually from 2010 to 2014. Because the
school was the unit of analysis, violence measures were aggregated by school and year and school-
level counts were provided.
Results: A total of 89,707 students completed surveys. The primary, as randomized, analyses
conducted in 2014–2016 included linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations to
examine the condition�time interaction on violence outcomes. Slopes of school-level totals of sexual
violence perpetration (condition�time, po0.001) and victimization (condition�time, po0.001)
were different over time. During Years 3–4, when Green Dot was fully implemented, the mean
number of sexual violent events prevented by the intervention was 120 in Intervention Year 3 and 88
in Year 4. For Year 3, prevalence rate ratios for sexual violence perpetration in the intervention
relative to control schools were 0.83 (95% CI¼0.70, 0.99) in Year 3 and 0.79 (95% CI¼0.67, 0.94) in
Year 4. Similar patterns were observed for sexual violence victimization, sexual harassment, stalking,
and dating violence perpetration and victimization.
Conclusions: Implementation of Green Dot in Kentucky high schools significantly decreased not
only sexual violence perpetration but also other forms of interpersonal violence perpetration and
victimization.

 INTRODUCTION
A
lthough much research on sexual violence has
focused on college populations,1 sexual violence
is often first experienced as early as middle or
high school.2,3 Sexual violence includes attempted or
completed nonconsensual sex, unwanted sexual contact,
and sexual harassment; dating partners are frequently
those responsible.4 Sexual violence victimization rates
range from 6% among male victims to 14% among
female victims, and this violence has been associated with
significant lifelong consequences, including suicide and
substance abuse.5
Bystander approaches have been recognized as “prom-
ising prevention strategies” for violence prevention.6
Bystander training teaches individuals how to recognize
situations or behaviors that may become violent and
intervene to reduce the likelihood of violence.7 At the
individual level, bystander interventions may reduce vio-
lent behaviors by increasing willingness and self-efficacy to
challenge violence-supportive norms and behaviors in
one’s peer group8 and intervene in risky situations to
prevent violence.9–11 These individual interventions within
peer groups can diffuse the benefits of training through
social networks to produce changes in social norms and
behavior at the community level. Emerging evidence
suggests that bystander approaches to violence prevention
may increase bystander intentions,9–11 promote positive
bystander behaviors,8 and reduce violence among college
students12,13 and adolescent male athletes.14
Bystander intervention programs share a philosophy
that all members of the community have a role in
preventing violence. By engaging participants not as
potential victims or perpetrators, but as potential allies,
both defensiveness and victim-blaming attitudes are
reduced.6,15,16 Designated driver campaigns are examples
of effective bystander-related messaging applied to
reduce drunk driving.17
In this study, school-level frequency of self-reported
sexual violence perpetration and victimization was
hypothesized to decline over time in high schools
receiving a bystander intervention compared with no-
intervention (control) high schools.18 Because different
types of violence frequently co-occur,19 intervention effects
on sexual harassment, stalking, and dating violence were
also measured for both victimization and perpetration.
Declines over time in the intervention relative to control
condition were hypothesized for all violence forms. An
intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used.
METHODS
The Green Dot violence prevention program (www.livethegreen
dot.com) aims to engage potential bystanders to act to reduce
sexual violence and related forms of interpersonal violence.8,13
This program is theory-based and supported by research drawing
from
bystander
psychology,20–23
diffusion
of
innovation
theory,24,25 and sexual violence perpetrator characteristics.26–28
Male and female students are trained to recognize situations and
behaviors that can contribute to violence and determine actions
they could safely take to reduce the likelihood or effect of violence.
These active bystander behaviors are called “green dots” to
distinguish them from “red dots” or behaviors that may contribute
to violence. Although originally developed for college students, for
this trial, the developer adapted the program for high school�aged
populations.18 This adapted curriculum was delivered in two
phases by trained rape crisis center educators (hereafter “educa-
tors”; n=28 educators; all female). Intervention training began Fall
2010 (beginning Year 1 [Y1]), with the majority (450%) of
students in intervention schools receiving a 50-minute introduc-
tory persuasive speech delivered by educators (Phase 1). This
schoolwide presentation oriented students to their potential role as
engaged bystanders and explained how to recognize “red dots” and
“green dots.” Green Dot speeches were provided annually to
students in the intervention schools. Phase 2 was implemented
beginning Spring 2011 (Y2) using the popular opinion leader
strategy,29,30 which suggests that training 12%�15% of a student
body would maximize diffusion of the intervention. Educators
worked with high school staff to identify students as leaders.
Leadership qualities were operationalized as students others
respected, followed, or emulated and not necessarily those with
academic, athletic, or social leadership skills. These students were
invited to participate in intensive (5-hour) bystander training. If
space permitted, this training was also open for other students.
Both training phases focused on violence victimization, perpetra-
tion, and on prosocial behaviors to recognize situations that may
lead to violence and to act directly to distract or to delegate to
others tasks to reduce the likelihood of violence (three Ds).
Training focused not only on sexual violence risk but on sexual
harassment, stalking, and partner violence.
Educators attended a 4-day training delivered by the developer.
Research staff, including the developer, reviewed educators’
audio recordings of training sessions to assess the fidelity of
program implementation. Research staff provided individualized
feedback to educators throughout the trial. This feedback
addressed how well educators connected with the audience
and the degree to which their training was consistent with the
curriculum.
Study Sample
Across the 13 rape crisis centers’ regions, 46 demographically
similar high schools were recruited and were willing to be
randomized. Researchers reviewed the size of these 46 public
schools and excluded ten as being too small (o100 per grade).
Among the remaining 36 schools, two schools within the 13
regions were selected by the rape crisis centers for simple
randomization to each condition in this cluster RCT (n=26).
Participating high schools signed Memorandums of Understand-
ing indicating willingness to be randomized, to remain in the trial,
and allow data collection for 5 years (Spring 2010–2014). Upon
trial completion, schools in both conditions had the option to
continue implementation or adopt the intervention at no cost to
the school.

 High schools randomized to the control condition received no
additional prevention programming (usual care). Staff monitored
new program implementation in control schools over time and
confirmed that no bystander programs were implemented.
The sample size for the primary analysis was determined a priori
based on number of regional rape crisis centers (n=13) and the
design in which two demographically similar public high schools
were identified and randomized in each of the 13 service regions.
For capacity and feasibility reasons, educators within each region
were asked to provide the intervention to only one school per
region. For secondary analyses using individual-level data within a
single year, power calculations were provided using Stata, version
11 (sampsi), assuming 500 students participating at each school
within a year, accounting for clustering of students within schools
(intraclass correlation of 0.005), and a two-sided significance level
of 0.05. Greater than 80% power was anticipated to test for a 50%
reduction in physically forced sex, relative to 5% rate in control
condition (Appendices, available online).
Primary data collection was conducted at schools with all
students (Grades 9–12) invited to complete an annual, anonymous
survey before intervention implementation (Spring 2010, baseline)
and during implementation from 2011 (Y1) through 2014 (Y4) as
planned without an early stop. Researchers worked with each high
school each year to identify 1 or 2 days between February and April
that the majority of students would be present. The study protocol
was approved by the University of Kentucky IRB (13-0680-F1V).
Letters describing the study were mailed to all parents annually. If
parents did not want their child to participate, parents could
contact researchers by phone or e-mail with their student’s name
and school; surveys were not given to these students. At each
administration, all students were given the option of refusing to
complete the anonymous survey. The 99-item paper and pencil
questionnaire was administered by research staff during the school
day; students typically took 20–45 minutes to complete the survey.
Research staff read elements of assent to all students. Pencils with
website and hotline numbers for domestic violence, sexual
violence, and depression support agencies were provided to all
students. A more detailed student recruitment and data collection
methodology is provided elsewhere.15,16
Measures
The outcomes were self-reported violence perpetration and victim-
ization in the past 12 months; response options were expanded
beyond yes/no to include frequencies (response options: zero, one
to two, three to five, six to nine, and ten or more times). For
analyses, response categories were scored as the minimum value in
each response range (zero, one, three, six, and ten) to err toward
undercounting versus overcounting incidents. The measures used,
their source, psychometric properties, and response options for the
outcomes are provided in Appendix Figure 1 (available online).
To measure hypothesized declines over time in school-level
reports of violence perpetration and victimization in the inter-
vention relative to control schools, two approaches were used:
a school-level count of violence reported over time and a
dichotomous measure student-reported violence forms by year.
First, as the primary outcome, school-level sums for the number
of violent events provided a frequency of violence per school.
A school-level summary was used as the primary outcome because
student reports were anonymously collected and did not allow for
data linkage over time; aggregated, school-level data (cluster-level
summaries) could be linked longitudinally. To make interpreta-
tions of estimates easier, school-level sums were selected as the
cluster-level summary in lieu of the more traditional cluster-level
mean. Resulting estimates by condition, within year, were used as a
measure of direct public health relevance: the absolute number of
events prevented by the intervention.
The second approach to measuring intervention effectiveness
used a dichotomous variable of student-reported violence. These
dichotomous variables were then used to estimate prevalence rates
(%) for all violence forms for both victimization and perpetration
in each condition by year.
Students were also asked about sociodemographic (gender,
grade, race/ethnicity, and receiving reduced-price school meals)
and violence risk (sexual attraction, current romantic/dating
relationship status, seen or heard a parent being physically abused
by a partner, and binge drinking in the past month) characteristics.
Statistical Analysis
School-level differences in demographic characteristics (mean and
SD of percentages) at baseline were evaluated using two-sample t-
tests to identify imbalances by condition.
Annual school sums of student responses (n¼26) were used as
the primary outcome to address the study hypothesis that using
violence would be reduced over implementation in intervention
relative to control schools. The primary analytic goal for this
randomized intervention trial was to provide a longitudinal
evaluation of randomized conditions. Repeated school-level meas-
ures were analyzed over time, where schools, not students, were the
unit of analysis. Owing to significant overdispersion in Poisson
models, linear mixed models were chosen to evaluate condi-
tion�time (CxT) interactions and provide mean estimates by
condition year. Histograms and quantile plots were used to assess
distributional assumptions, and violations to normality were not
observed. Therefore, to estimate the longitudinal effect of the
intervention over time, which was central to the study hypothesis,
linear mixed models included the effects of randomized condition,
time (baseline, Y1 2010–Y4 2014), and the CxT interaction on
violence outcomes (PROC GLIMMIX with an AR [1] R matrix and
bias-corrected empirical SE estimates in SAS, version 9.3, 9.4).31
Because the outcomes were school-level sums, the number of
students responding in each year was also included for covariate
adjustment. For these analyses, the mean school-level sum (yearly
totals) of violent events were presented by condition (and 95% CI)
with absolute differences (intervention�control [I�C]; 95% CI)
within year, providing an estimate of events potentially prevented.
Parallel analyses using each of the three items comprising the
primary measures of sexual violence (perpetration and victim-
ization) were also conducted.
Using the dichotomous reports of violence provided by students
within a year, violence prevalence rates at the individual level were
used to estimate prevalence rate ratios comparing intervention to
control conditions within year using generalized estimating
equations
(PROC
GENMOD,
link¼log,
dist¼bin,
using
REPEATED with EXCH matrix in SAS, version 9.3, 9.4). Gener-
alized estimating equations allow for the comparison of prevalence
rates while accounting for school-level clustering in a log-binomial
regression framework. Analyses and results were provided by year;
adjusted prevalence rate ratios with 95% CIs were also presented.
Coker et al / Am J Prev Med 2017;52(5):566–578
568
www.ajpmonline.org
 To provide results for gender subgroups, parallel analyses were
repeated for female and male students.
All analyses were conducted as ITT. To maintain ITT analyses
for the longitudinal analysis, missing school-level data (n¼2) were
imputed using single imputation (last observation carried for-
ward), because the school-level sample size (n¼26) was small for
multiple imputation and missingness occurred in a monotone
pattern (i.e., missingness is due only to school dropout, and once
dropout occurred, schools did not return). A significance level of
0.05 (two-sided) was used for all statistical tests. Adjustments for
multiple comparisons were not made for exploratory analyses.
Though data collection began in 2010, no data analyses were
conducted until after final data collection and cleaning in late 2014.
A delay in registering this trial at ClinicalTrials.gov (2013) was due
to determining how best to characterize this cluster-based trial.
The cooperative agreement specified sexual violence perpetration
as the primary outcome indicating intervention effectiveness.
RESULTS
At the school level, two high schools dropped out of the
study, one randomized to the control (Y2) and one to the
intervention condition (Y4). Within schools, the refusal
rates were 0.5% and 13.6% for parents and students,
respectively.
From baseline to Y4, a total of 106,867 students were
present on survey days, and 83.9% completed surveys.32
This rate was 92.6% at baseline and declined to 76.6% in
Y4. Response rates were similar in intervention (84.4%,
47,311/56,029)
and
control
(83.4%,
42,396/50,838)
schools (Figure 1). Students who did not provide
demographics or violence information were excluded
(n¼9,427) from the analytic sample. Potential mischie-
vous responders were also identified33 (never drinkers
reporting symptoms of alcohol abuse, never sexually
active responders but pregnant or having children, or
those in multiple relationships in the past 12 months yet
no relationship in the same time frame for dating
violence items) and excluded (n¼6,485) as a conservative
approach to limit potential bias introduced by including
inaccurate responses. The final analytic sample included
73,795 responses over 5 years, representing 26 schools.
Based on self-reported survey data, almost half of
students in intervention schools recalled hearing a Green
Dot speech (Phase 1 training: Y1, 58%; Y2, 52%; Y3,
48.5%; Y4, 47%). Phase 2 intensive training was delivered
in groups (mean group size, 32 students; range, 17–60)
held during school hours, with at least two trainings per
academic year per school. A total of 2,599 students
received bystander training (Phase 2 intensive training:
Y1, 8.3%; Y2, 11.1%; Y3, 12.6%; Y4, 13.2%).
Similarities in sociodemographic and violence risk
characteristics (school-level averages) between condi-
tions suggested that randomization resulted in compa-
rable schools across conditions (Appendix Table 1,
available online). Rates (%) of violence by form and
condition at baseline were provided for all students and
by sex (Appendix Table 2, available online) and similarly
indicated no differences by condition.
Greater declines in the number of sexual violence
perpetration events (CxT, po0.001) and victimization
(CxT, po0.001) were observed from Y1 to Y4 in
intervention relative to control schools (Table 1). After
the intervention was fully implemented (Y3 and Y4), the
mean differences in the number of events perpetrated in
the intervention versus control schools were �120 (Y3)
and �88 (Y4). An estimated 120 fewer sexual violence
events were perpetrated in Y3 for an average intervention
school than in an average control school. I�C differences
in sexual violence victimization events were �167 (Y3)
and �62 (Y4).
The intervention was associated with a significant
reduction over time (CxT, po0.01) for each of the three
sexual violence perpetration items. In Y3 and Y4,
respectively, the intervention was associated with 38
and 24 fewer coerced sex events, 40 and 23 fewer
physically forced sex events, and 44 and 43 fewer alcohol
drug facilitated sex events perpetrated.
In all three sexual violence victimization items, a
significant CxT interaction was also observed (CxT,
po0.01). However, the pattern of significantly fewer
events (I�C) in Y3 for all three items did not hold for Y4.
Statistically significant CxT interactions were observed
for both perpetration and victimization of sexual harass-
ment, stalking, and psychological and physical dating
violence (Table 1). Further, significantly fewer violent
events were perpetrated and experienced in the inter-
vention versus control schools (I�C) in Y3 for sexual
harassment, stalking, and both forms of dating violence.
For both Y3 and Y4, significantly fewer physical dating
violence events (victimization and perpetration) were
observed in the intervention relative to control schools.
For the three items measuring the effect of experienc-
ing sexual or dating violence, each resulted in significant
CxT interactions with significantly fewer events in the
intervention relative to control schools for Y3. On
average, there were 39 and 25 fewer reports of students
missing school because of violence victimization for Y3
and Y4, respectively. This pattern of fewer events
associated with the intervention was also observed for
help seeking for and being physically hurt by sexual
violence or dating violence.
Table 2 and Appendix Table 3 (available online)
provide the student-level analyses clustered within
schools. Because the student-level data were anony-
mous, changes in the violence rates (%) over time could
not be estimated; yet, prevalence rates and rate ratios
were
estimated
within
year.

aNumber present is the number of students in school on the day of the survey administration by year and condition. Each year all students in the
schools were surveyed, thus student numbers differ by year. Individual students are not followed over time. The number of students enrolled defined
as those administratively enrolled at each school at the beginning of the academic year across all schools by condition was used as the denominator
for response rate calculation reported in text.
bRefusals include both student and parental refusal of study participation.
cMissing includes students agreeing to participant yet completing no demographic items nor violence or intervention training items.
dStudent responses were identified as potentially “mischievous” if there were discrepancies between similar questions (e.g., never drinker reporting
binge drinking).eTwo schools initially agreed to participate in the trial and dropped out before randomization. Values for the missing school were
imputed from prior year. One intervention school dropped out in Year 4 and one control school dropped in Year 1; the school-level means from the last
year of data collection were used as the imputed value.

 respectively, sexual violence perpetration rates were
17% (prevalence rate ratio [PRR]¼0.83) and 21%
(PRR¼0.79) lower in the intervention relative to
control schools. This pattern held for perpetration of
alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual violence for Y3 and
Y4. A pattern of a reduced sexual violence perpetration
PRR was observed among female students yet not
among male students.
Regarding sexual violence victimization, rates were
12%�13% lower in the intervention versus control
schools in Y3 and Y4, respectively. For Y3 alone, sexual
violence victimization rates were significantly lower in
the intervention relative to control schools for both male
and female students and for all three sexual violence

 harassment, stalking, and physical dating violence vic-
timization in Y3 alone. Similarly, rates of missing school
or needing to seek help for violence experienced were
significantly lower only in Y3.
DISCUSSION
Results from this 5-year RCT indicate that this bystander
program to reduce violence, adapted for high school
students, was associated with 120 fewer sexually violent
events in Y3 and 88 in Y4 when the intervention was fully
implemented. Significant CxT interactions indicated
intervention effectiveness to reduce sexual violence
perpetration, victimization, and other forms of inter-
personal violence over time. A time delay between
intervention implementation and reductions in violent
behavior was anticipated, as the intervention was
hypothesized to reduce violence at the school level by
first changing individual-level social norms suppor-
ting violence and increasing bystander skills and actions
among the subset of trained individuals. Changes
at the individual level in norms and behaviors require
time to ultimately be detected as changes in vio-
lence at the school level. From secondary analyses, the
intervention was effective in reducing the student-level
violence perpetration rates by 17%�21% (po0.01) in
Y3 and Y4.
This study is the first RCT of a bystander intervention
focusing on sexual violence prevention and implemented
with both sexes in a high school setting. This intervention
is unique in its use of a gender-neutral approach to
engage and train bystanders. The popular opinion leader
model for recruitment and training may be a particularly
efficient method to diffuse prosocial, non-violent norms
through students’ peer networks and change violence
rates. Cost efficiencies of providing an intervention to
only 12%�15% of students using this training strategy,
yet finding a 17%�21% reduction in sexual violence, as
observed here, may be particularly attractive for policy-
makers and school administrators because prevention
programs that effectively address multiple violence forms
may be particularly efficient strategies, given schools’
multiple educational objectives.19
The present finding that Green Dot was associated
with a significant reduction in high school�level reports
of using alcohol- or drug-facilitated sex was consistent
with a recently reported observational study of a similar
intervention among college freshmen.34 Unwanted sex was
significantly lower (po0.05) on the campus receiving a
bystander program compared with two campuses without
a bystander program (adjusted rate ratio, 0.75), with the
largest reduction for alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual
violence (adjusted rate ratio, 0.64, po0.001). The inter-
vention campus also had significantly lower rates of sexual
harassment, stalking, and psychological dating violence.35
The only other rigorous evaluation of a bystander
prevention
strategy
among
high
school
students35
focused on violence perpetration in dating situations
(including sexual violence against a partner). The current
design and dating violence findings were similar to that
reported by Miller et al.,35 who observed a reduction in
self-reported physical dating violence perpetration asso-
ciated with this intervention over time among male
athletes. The studies differed in that other forms of
interpersonal violence perpetration and victimization
were measured and both young women and men were
the target of this intervention. Other evidence-based
programs36–39 set in middle or high schools have relied
on different strategies to reduce sexual violence, such as
teaching skills for building healthy relationships, chang-
ing violence acceptance, or implementing in-school
protective orders and hot spot mapping.
The identification of Green Dot as an effective
intervention for reducing school-level violence advanced
the evidence base for bystander programming by dem-
onstrating bystander program impacts on more than one
violence form with a stronger effect for perpetration than
victimization. Bystander programs were hypothesized to
reduce violence rates over time. Data from this 5-year
trial also indicated that sufficient time is required to see

 the ultimate effect of the bystander training on violent
behaviors; results from these approaches may not appear
with short-term implementation.
There are important attributes to Green Dot that may
differentiate it from other programs and explain program
effectiveness. Educators received extensive intervention
training
and
feedback
on
their
program
delivery
throughout the implementation, which may have con-
tributed to programmatic success. A unique benefit to
using rape crisis center educators is their dual training as
advocates and prevention educators. This dual training
has the potential to be important for implementation in
school settings because most teachers lack the training to
provide counseling and advocacy services to students
who may self-identify as experiencing violence. Using
dually trained educators, at no cost to schools, further
reduced any additional burden on schools because
teachers were not required to be trained and implement
the bystander program curriculum.
Limitations
Although an experimental study design was used in this
trial, there were limitations. Lack of blinding of inter-
vention status may have led to a social desirability bias in
violence reporting, such that students in intervention
schools may have under-reported violence because they
may knew their school had a violence prevention
program. The validity of the findings hinged on the
accuracy of students’ anonymous self-reports. However,
even when those identified as mischievous responders
were included via sensitivity analyses, no differences in
findings were observed, thus indicating no apparent
information bias in findings.
Several factors may explain why some program effects
were not maintained in Y4. Small sample sizes (n=26) by
condition may explain the lack of statistical significance
over time and for analyses by sex (Table 2). Maintaining
a consistent intervention across 13 schools over 4 years
was a challenge. Data were collected to characterize
program implementation quality over time and will be
the focus of additional research. Finding greater program
effective for perpetration versus victimization may be a
function of violence perpetrated by non-students who
were not exposed to this school-based intervention;
victimization measures did not differentiate between
perpetration by students and non-students.
Results of this trial may not generalize to other settings if
implemented with different educator training or fidelity.
However, this ITT analysis provides an estimate of effec-
tiveness that contrasts intervention and control conditions
regardless of school-level dosage received by students.
This study was not able to track individuals over time
because anonymous surveys were used. However, the
study was designed to measure change not among
trained individuals but in violence at the school level,
which is consistent with Green Dot model for diffusion of
the intervention through trained individuals to changes
in violence at the school level. Future research is
encouraged to measure bystander effectiveness in chang-
ing violence at the trained individual, their social net-
work, the school, and community levels.
CONCLUSIONS
Implementation of a bystander intervention to reduce
violence in Kentucky high schools decreased sexual
violence over time with program implementation. Fur-
ther studies are needed to assess bystander intervention
efficacy in other settings. The medical and educational
communities frequently serve as first responders to
adolescents exposed to violence. These findings are
among the first to identify an effective bystander inter-
vention to prevent or reduce sexual and dating violence.
