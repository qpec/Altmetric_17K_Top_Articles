Summary
GM crops are the most studied crops in history. Approximately 5% of the safety studies on them
show adverse effects that are a cause for concern and tend to be featured in media reports.
Although these reports are based on just a handful of GM events, they are used to cast doubt on
all GM crops. Furthermore, they tend to come from just a few laboratories and are published in
less important journals. Importantly, a close examination of these reports invariably shows
methodological flaws that invalidate any conclusions of adverse effects. Twenty years after
commercial cultivation of GM crops began, a bona fide report of an adverse health effect due to
a commercialized modification in a crop has yet to be reported.
Introduction
Concerns over the lack of safety of genetically modified (GM)
crops are used as arguments to ban them, or at least to regulate
them heavily. Many citizens, politicians and countries generally
take those arguments to reinforce misconceptions about GM
crops. Anecdotal and newspaper reports also reinforce an anti-
GM stance (Wunderlich and Gatto, 2015). Usually, the debate is
driven by political and ideological arguments instead of science-
based discussion (Trewavas and Leaver, 2001). Some aspects of
agriculture in general, such as herbicides, monocultures and
intellectual property, also contribute to concerns over GM crops
(Hilbeck et al., 2015), despite applying equally to conventional
agriculture.
Although referred to monolithically as GM crops in conversa-
tion, GM crops are quite distinct from each other; the only thing
in common they share with each other is the process—recom-
binant DNA—used to produce them. Each individual use of
recombinant DNA to produce a GM crop is known as an ‘event’.
In the United States, the FDA has reviewed 153 events to date
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=Biocon), many
of which are on the market. Yet, most of the publications that
are recurrently cited as evidence against GM crop safety
(Domingo and Bordonaba, 2011; Dona and Arvanitoyannis,
2009; Hilbeck et al., 2015; Maga~
na-G�
omez and de la Barca,
2009; Seralini 2011) centre on a small number of studies on
specific events and that received extensive media coverage. The
hundreds of scientific studies that do not support safety concerns
go unnoticed in the public debate (Nicolia et al., 2014).
What follows is an assessment of original research papers
addressing food/feed safety aspects of GM crops, which are used
frequently as evidence of adverse effects and health risks of GM
crops. Potential conflict of interests (COI), the scientific quality of
the studies and the logic and credibility of arguments and
conclusions were appraised. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper analysing this information all at once.
About the papers evaluated
The papers selected for study include those cited in four reviews
of adverse effects of GM crops (Domingo and Bordonaba, 2011;
Dona and Arvanitoyannis, 2009; Maga~
na-G�
omez and de la Barca,
2009; Seralini 2011). References cited in the Internet by GM Free
USA, Coalition for a GM Free India and GM Watch were added.
Studies not published in scientific journals (e.g. Ermakova,
Velimirov, Surov, abstracts) as well as those reports evaluating
only immunogenicity of pure proteins, instead of whole food or
GM crops studies, were not included. Reports in a language other
than English were not considered.
Thirty-five articles meet the above criteria (Table 1). These 35
studies represent fewer than 5% of all published studies assessing
GM food/feed safety (Nicolia et al., 2014; S�
anchez, 2015).
In the 35 articles assessed, the herbicide-tolerant soya bean
event 40-3-2 has been the GM crop/feed most analysed, for a
total of 15 studies (43%). The insect-resistant maize event,
MON810, is part of eight studies (23%). Another three (9%)
evaluated noncommercial events, two on GM potato and one on
GM pea. Seven studies (20%) do not indicate which event was
evaluated, which makes it impossible to replicate the experiments
or interpret the results. Maize NK603, MON863 and BT176 are
the other tested events. All of these were among the first events
to reach the market, or at least, to appear in the literature.
The geographical origin of the 35 studies is striking. There are
just a few laboratories from a few places that are responsible for
articles claiming adverse effects. While 57% (20) were conducted
in Europe, 43% (15) were carried out in Italy (Figure 1). Egyptian
scientists contributed 17% (6) of the studies here assessed. Only
one paper reviewed here, though written in Australia, is based on
research conducted in the USA.
The most frequent author on these publications, having co-
authored 11 of 35 studies (31%), is the Malatesta group at the
University of Urbino and University of Verona, Italy. Nine of their
articles are on soya bean 40-3-2 and represent 60% of all studies

 suggesting adverse effects from this event. Their studies on maize
events BT176 and NK603 were co-authored with the M.
Trabalza-Marinucci (Universit�
a degli Studi di Perugia, Italy) and
G-E. S�
eralini (University of Caen, France) teams, respectively. R.
Tudisco and F. Infascelli (both from University of Naples Federico
II) were part of four studies (11%), all of which assessed soya
bean 40-3-2. Altogether, 87% of all studies on event 40-3-2
come from the Malatesta and Infascelli groups. G-E. S�
eralini was
the corresponding author in three studies (9%) on different
events of GM maize, corresponding to 25% of all studies
assessing GM maize.
Because of the relevance of food safety, any well-conducted
study under rigorous standards of scientific quality and showing
adverse effects of any GM food/crop could and would be
published in the most prominent journals. However, most
studies often used in the public debate against GM food/crops
have been published in journals with lower visibility; eight were
even published in journals without a listed impact factor
(Table 1).
The only study published in a high-ranking journal has been
that of Ewen & Pusztai (1999) (see Table 1). However, something
usually not mentioned in the public debate is that editors
published an accompanying analysis highlighting the study’s
flaws in many aspects of design, execution and analysis (Kuiper
et al., 1999). Furthermore, the editor, Richard Horton, stated that
publication of Ewen and Pusztai’s findings was not a ‘vindication’
of Pusztai’s claims. Horton argued if the study was not published,
a critical evaluation of the results could not be conducted. He also
cited a reviewer pointing out that he ‘would like to see the work
published in the public domain so that fellow scientists can judge
for themselves. . . if the paper is not published, it will be claimed
there is a conspiracy to suppress information’ (Horton, 1999).
Conflicts of interest
All 35 studies declared no competing interests. Financial COIs
arise when research is fully or partially funded by a party with a
stake in the development of GM crops or in activities anti-GMO,
whereas professional COIs arise when at least one author is
affiliated with a company developing GM crops or anti-GMO
institutions, even if the research is supported through public
funding. Upon our examination, fewer than half—14 of 35 (40%)
—show no financial or professional COIs. It is worth noting that in
the most of the cases, conflicts cannot be discerned unless an
author mentions if he or she is affiliated with declared anti-GMO
institutions. The proportion of these 35 studies truly without a
COI is somewhat lower than that for the vast majority of scientific
studies supporting the safety of GM crops food/feed, where at
least 406 of 698 reports (58.3%) have no financial or professional
COIs (Sanchez 2015).
Overall, research for which the authors did not provide funding
information represents 49% of the total reports (17 articles). Four
of 35 articles (11%) had COIs either in terms of the author
affiliation or funding source. The three studies from Seralini’s
group were supported by the Committee of Independent
Research and Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN),

 which is financed by the Charles Léopold Mayer Foundation for
the Progress of Humankind (FPH). This foundation has publicly
supported
anti-GMOs
initiatives
like
Inf’OGM,
Foundation
Sciences Citoyennes; the European Network of Scientists for
Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER), Combat Mon-
santo and Stop OGM, among others (http://alerte-environneme
nt.fr/2012/11/12/etude-anti-ogm-de-saralini-les-petits-soldats-de-
la-fondation-pour-le-progres-de-lhomme/). Likewise, Greenpeace
partially funded the two studies (S�
eralini et al., 2007; de
Vendomois et al., 2009) that found hepatorenal effects.
Although not considered in the analysis, it is worth noting that
conflict of interest may have been involved in the review process
of the retracted and criticized S�
eralini et al. (2012) study. J.L.
Domingo, author of another review here assessed (Domingo and
Bordonaba, 2011), was an editor of Food and Chemical Toxicol-
ogy when the Seralini study was accepted.
Carman et al. (2013) also present COIs. George Kailis, an
organic food entrepreneur having a cautionary approach to GMO
(http://www.farmweekly.com.au/news/agriculture/agribusiness/ge
neral-news/technology-must-benefit-the-consumer-kailis/10451.as
px), partially funded the study. Furthermore, Verity Farms, another
funder, has a non-GMO grain-marketing venture in the USA, and
it is catalogued in the Non-GMO Sourcebook, which is a directory
of non-GM food and agricultural products (http://www.nong
mosourcebook.com/non-gmosourcebook/non-gmo-company.php?
company=Verity+Farms). Plus, assistance is acknowledged from
John Fagan, Arpad Puzstai and Jeffrey Smith, among others, three
recognized opponents of GMO.
Scientific quality of the studies
In general terms, all papers analysed here violate at least one of
the basic standards for assessment of GM food/feed safety
(Bartholomaeus et al., 2013; European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA), 2011; ILSI 2008, 2004; Kuiper et al., 2001; Codex
Alimentarius Commission (www.codexalimentarius.org)):
1.
The control and experimental varieties should be isogenic
and should have the same origin (i.e. grown in the same
field, under similar conditions and in the same season) to
diminish differences in nutritional content of control and
experimental diets;
2.
A proper statistical test should be selected before the study
and not change it for convenience throughout the exper-
iments. Furthermore, statistically significant differences are
not necessarily biologically significant due to the normal
range of physiological parameters among the organisms of
the same species; and
3.
If some differences or alterations are observed in a well-
designed study assessing GM diets, then it is necessary to
contrast it with similar previous studies—if they exist—that
do not show the same effects. The discrepancy should be
addressed with a plausible hypothesis explaining the causes
of the nonreproducibility.
Three of 35 studies (9%) did not do any experimentation either
and report results solely based on statistical re-analysis of
previously published data. S�
eralini et al. (2007) and de Vendo-
mois et al. (2009) suggest hepatorenal effects on rats fed GM
maize. According to the authors, the use of standard statistics
does not show significant changes; rather, the parameters fell
within the normal range for control animals. Therefore, the
authors used a nonconventional statistical method to show
significant effects at low doses but not at higher doses of
exposure to GM maize. These findings do not fit the standard
dose–response expected in toxicology (Wilson et al., 2001), a fact
that was dismissed by the authors, who stated they ‘considered
equally important effects that were neither time nor dose
related’.
Likewise, Ayyadurai and Deonikar (2015) claim that algorithms
developed by them predict that GM soya bean has increased
formaldehyde and decreased glutathione relative to non-GM soya
bean. Thus, they concluded that current safety assessment for
GM food/crops is not adequate, given that formaldehyde has not
been detected nor evaluated so far. The authors never validated
their formulas by comparing GM and non-GM soya beans for
their formaldehyde content. Instead, the authors developed their
formulas by searching ‘online databases including PubMed and
Google Scholar’, and data from over six thousand studies were
included, but the origin of the data and their validity are unknown
(European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 2015).
The Malatesta group has been involved in nine of 35 studies
(26%). This series of studies is full of methodological flaws
(Table 1), but perhaps the critical point is that the level of
isoflavones in the soya bean diets was never measured. Such
measurements are essential because these molecules can mod-
ulate the physiology of mammals due to the similarity they have
with female sexual hormones (Brown and Setchell, 2001; Thigpen
et al., 2004) and are known to be highly variable between soya
bean varieties and locations (Eldridge and Kwolek, 1983).
Four studies (11%) belong to Professor Infascelli’s group.
Recently, Infascelli’s group was informed that two papers from his
group (Tudisco et al. 2010 and Mastellone et al., 2013, not
assessed here) have been retracted. The articles intended to show
that GM feed is detectable as GM DNA in goat kids and that
these have abnormal gamma-glutamyl transferase activity. The
University of Naples Federico II, where the studies took place,
conducted its own investigation and reprimanded the authors
(http://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/02/09/news/universita_
-133079638/?refresh_ce%3C/a).
It
concluded
that
multiple
image heterogeneities were likely attributable to digital manip-
ulation, raising serious doubts about the reliability of the
findings. The retraction notice that was posted by the journal
for Mastellone et al. (2013) specifically cites fraud. Additional
details on these publications are posted on PubPeer at https://
pubpeer.com/search?q=tudisco&sessionid=B66D1BF6E6EDF5224
777&commit=Search+Publications (Accessed 12 March 2017).
Finamore et al. (2008) reported that ingestion of GM maize
provokes an immune response in mice. Although mycotoxins can
affect the immune system (Sobrova et al., 2010), the authors
dismissed a mycotoxin effect arguing the levels were modest and
were only slightly higher than the maximum allowable concen-
tration. In reality, the amount was twofold (1300 vs. 750 lg/kg)
higher than allowed for deoxynivalenol.
Trabalza-Marinucci et al. (2008) provide even fewer details.
The authors did not mention the variety of maize used as the
control, nor its origin, and mycotoxins are not addressed. In
Maga~
na-G�
omez et al. (2008), it is unclear which soya bean
varieties were used and whether they were isogenic lines. The
origin of the soya bean tested is not mentioned, making it
impossible to evaluate inherent variability that can affect results.
Carman et al. (2013) published on pigs fed GM or non-GM
diets for 22.7 weeks. There were no differences in feed intake,
weight gain, mortality and routine blood biochemistry measure-
ments. The GM diet was associated with severe stomach
ª 2017 The Authors. Plant Biotechnology Journal published by Society for Experimental Biology and The Association of Applied Biologists and John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 15, 1227–1234
Plant biotechnology and GM food/feed safety 1231
 inflammation and thicker uteruses. Despite what was claimed,
stomach inflammation was not tested histologically. Instead, a
visual scoring of the colour of the lining of the stomach was
performed, and redness was considered inflammation. It is not
evident how pigs with severe stomach inflammation could have
had the same weight gain as pigs with no stomach inflammation.
The pattern of inflammation is likewise difficult to explain. There
were more pigs with mild and moderate inflammation eating the
non-GM feed than GM feed. Further, there were fewer pigs with
nil inflammation in non-GM feed than GM feed. In addition,
although the authors classified the stomach inflammation into
four visual categories, they grouped them in two for statistical
analyses: severe inflammation versus nonsevere inflammation.
Uteruses of non-GM and GM-fed pigs accounted for 0.10%
and 0.12% of body weight, respectively. The heaviest uterus in
the GM-fed group weighed less than the heaviest uterus in the
non-GM-fed group. The differences in uterus weights disappear if
conventional statistical analysis is used (http://www.inexactcha
nge.org/blog/2013/06/19/gmo-pig-study/). Finally, the authors
did not provide information on the varieties of corn and soya
bean used as control, and no chemical analysis of the diet was
conducted (e.g. isoflavone content is unknown) to ensure the
treated groups received equivalent diets.
S�
eralini et al. (2014), which is a retracted and republished
article (S�
eralini et al., 2012), is one of the emblematic cases
reporting criticized experiments. The authors claimed animals fed
either GM maize or herbicide had higher tumour and mortality
rates, as well as severe kidney and liver alterations. Among the
most notorious flaws according to Arj�
o et al., 2013 are as
follows: (i) the tumour rate reported is within the normal tumour
rate for rats Sprague Dawley; (ii) inappropriate use of statistics:
when the statistics are corrected for multiple comparisons, the
negative effects disappear; (iii) inadequate sample size: that is, 10
rats per group instead of 20 rats for chemical toxicity studies, 50
rats for carcinogenicity studies and 65 rats if the survival of them
is less than 50% at 104 weeks; (iv) no dose–response relationship
as is expected in toxicology; (v) biased results: that is, paper
contained pictures of treated rats with huge tumours, but no
pictures of control group rats which had the same tumours; and
(vi) the results go against an overwhelming body of evidence to
the contrary.
There are several cases that do not need an extensive analysis.
For instance, Oraby et al. (2015) reported health hazards linked
to the ingestion of diets containing GM maize and GM soya bean.
The control animals were not treated equally and instead were
fed a diet of wheat.
El-Kholy et al. (2014) investigated the effect of extra virgin
olive oil and GM soya bean in rodents. However, the study aimed
to compare only olive and soya bean, instead of GM and non-GM
soya bean, so no conclusions are possible.
Brasil et al. (2009) designed a study to compare the effects of a
prolonged use of organic and GM soya bean on the lipid profile
and the ovary and uterus morphology of rats. Both diets improved
the lipid profile and reduced body weight, but alterations in
uterine and ovarian morphology were found in animals with
prolonged exposure to these diets. Although there were no
differences in isoflavone content, a chemical analysis of diets was
not conducted, and no information on how the crops were
grown was provided. For that reason, the authors remark that
small differences in diets (fat, sugar and especially protein or
amino acid content) could have led to the slight differences seen
between animals.
Ibrahim and Okasha (2016) evaluated the effect of GM maize
on the histological structure of jejunal mucosa of adult male
albino rats using different histological, immunohistochemical and
morphometrical
methods.
Histopathological
changes
were
claimed in the intestine. These changes are the author’s
interpretation of the photographs, not the interpretation of a
panel of experts. No analysis of the diet was provided, so the
differences, if they are real, may be due to variations in nutrients
and protein content instead of GM maize per se. Furthermore, no
mycotoxin content was conducted and nothing is mentioned
about the origin of crops, that is no information on how the crops
were grown or whether pesticides were used.
Kilic
�g€
un et al. (2013) observed differences in organ size and
other parameters in rats fed a diet with GM maize versus controls.
In this case, the same mistakes in Ibrahim and Okasha (2016)
committed (discussed above) were made. El-Shamei et al. (2012)
showed that rats fed on GM maize showed histopathological
changes in liver, kidney, testis, spleen and small intestine, again
without being interpreted by a panel of experts. Aside from not
indicating the number of animals that were or not affected in the
different conditions, no mycotoxin content was conducted, and
nothing is mentioned about the origin of crops. The same mistake
was made by Gab-Alla et al. (2012), who reported significant
differences in organs/body weight and serum biochemistry
between rats fed GM and non-GM maize.
While the bulk of the studies have been on commercialized
crops, safety studies on events that were never commercialized
have also been widely reported on. Prescott et al. (2005) and
Sagstad et al. (2007) studied the immunogenicity of a GM pea
and adverse effects of a GM maize in salmon, respectively. It has
not been possible to replicate these studies (Lee et al., 2013;
Sissener et al., 2011). It is now known that pea (both GM and
non-GM) elicit an immunogenic response in mice, and the results
obtained in 2005 were not specific to GM pea; for salmon, the
effects observed in 2007 corresponded to the effect of con-
founding factors (i.e. mycotoxins) instead of the GM trait. These
cases highlight the importance of repeating experiments in other
laboratories to confirm results, before drawing any conclusions.
Fares and El-Sayed (1998) observed adverse effects when
potatoes supplemented with Bt protein—in the form of an
uncharacterized crude extract from bacteria—were provided to
mice. However, GM potatoes producing Bt protein did not cause
significant effects. Purity and concentration of the protein in
treated potatoes were not determined, and as it was a crude
extract, it has impurities and other proteins unrelated to Bt.
Finally, there are some studies in which the authors remark that
their results do not show health concerns, but are nevertheless
cited as an example of harm. Kilic
� and Akai (2008) found minor
histopathological and biochemical effects in rats fed GM maize,
but long-term consumption over three generations did not cause
health concerns. Yum et al. (2005) recognized several flaws they
committed and discussed that they could not conclude GM soya
bean is allergenic. Eleven years after this publication, no other
studies have reported similar results.
Even well-designed studies have been misrepresented. Selec-
tive omission of details in Dona and Arvanitoyannis (2009) gives
the impression of health concerns when there were none (posted

eralini et al. (2011) used a filtered reference from
a large list of papers addressing GM food/feed, safety assess-
ments list in their review, and suggested health concerns from
papers in which the original authors concluded no negative

 effects or concerns on tested animals. For instance, Zhu et al.
(2004) concluded ‘the results of this 13-week dietary feeding
study demonstrated that the two types of soybean meal prepared
from GM herbicide-tolerant (RR) and nearly isogenic conventional
soybeans were comparable in composition and nutritional value
for Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, there was no evidence of
any pathologic signs of RR soybean meal even when included at a
high percentage of the diet (two or three times greater than
normal)’. However, S�
eralini et al. cited this study pointing out
GMO affected body weight increase. Moreover, S�
eralini et al.
cited seven of 19 studies of his list as cases where statistical
differences were not biologically meaningful for the original
authors; however, this can be debated according to his narrative.
They did not provide new statistical analysis or details from those
articles.
Finally, it is helpful to put these 35 studies in the context of the
larger body of literature that has used animal studies to help
evaluate food and feed safety. There are at least 204 articles
assessing animal health parameters, and 111 studies assessing
animal performance, 106 testing nutritional equivalence and 46
addressing allergenicity (S�
anchez, 2015). A summary of published
data in peer-reviewed journals comparing feeds from GM plants
with their isogenic counterparts and organized by food-producing
animal model can be found elsewhere (Flachowsky and Reuter,
2017).
While the 35 studies showing adverse effects only tested 11
events, the 204 other articles that assess animal health evaluate 94
different events. The soya bean event 40-3-2 has been the most
analysed (28 studies; 15%), along with the maize event MON810
(25 studies; 14%). In the same subset of papers, different animal
models have been used, where rat (46%), mouse (26%), fish
(9%), pig (6%) and cow (5%) have been the most common.
At least 44 peer-reviewed articles describing 90-day subchronic
toxicity feeding studies for nine crops (Ricroch et al., 2014) have
been published along with 23 long-term studies and 19 multiple-
generation feeding studies (Ricroch, 2013; Snell et al., 2012). No
biologically relevant effects on feed intake, digestibility, fertility,
performance or animal health have been reported. Furthermore,
it has been noted that over 100 billion animals have consumed
GM feed with no unfavourable or perturbed trends in animal
health and productivity (Van Eenennaam and Young, 2014).
It is always possible that all or some of these studies failed to
detect adverse effects simply because animal studies lack enough
sensitivity (Bartholomaeus et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the point
remains that, in contrast to the 35 studies here assessed, when
the same events tested have been conducted under a robust
study design—that is proper statistical analysis, controls, etc.—no
adverse effects have ever been observed.
