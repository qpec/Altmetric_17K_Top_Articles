IMPORTANCE There is a concern that Helicobacter pylori therapy containing clarithromycin
might be associated with acute neuropsychiatric events.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin
and acute neuropsychiatric events.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A self-controlled case series study was conducted using
the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System database in Hong Kong to explore any
association. The exposure of interest was H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin in the
outpatient setting. Study patients, 18 years or older at cohort entry, must have had both
exposure to H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin and their first recorded
neuropsychiatric events between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012. A post hoc nested
case-control analysis was also performed in patients receiving H pylori therapy containing
clarithromycin.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was composite neuropsychiatric
events, while secondary outcomes were psychotic events and cognitive impairment. Risk
periods in the self-controlled case series analysis were defined as 14-day preexposure period,
current use (days 1-14 since prescription start date) and recent use (days 15-30). Age-adjusted
incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using the conditional Poisson regression.
RESULTS Of 66 559 patients who had at least 1 outpatient prescription of H pylori therapy
containing clarithromycin. Their mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 50.8 (14.8 years); their
mean age at first exposure was 55.4 (14.8) years, and 30 910 were male (46.4%). A total of
1824 patients had their first recorded composite neuropsychiatric events during the study
period. An increased IRR of 4.12 (35 composite neuropsychiatric events during 72
person-years; 95% CI, 2.94-5.76) during current use was observed but not in recent use (9
events during 82 person-years; IRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.49-1.83) and 14-day preexposure period
(14 events during 72 person-years; IRR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.96-2.77) vs baseline (1766 events
during 16 665 person-years). Similarly, both the risk of psychotic events and cognitive
impairment increased during current use vs baseline, although this subsequently returned to
baseline incidence levels during recent use. The crude absolute risks of composite
neuropsychiatric events, psychotic events, and cognitive impairment during current use were
0.45, 0.12, and 0.12 per 1000 prescriptions, respectively. The nested case-control analysis
also gave similar results to that of the self-controlled case series analysis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study shows evidence of a short-term increased risk of
neuropsychiatric events associated with H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin.

scribed in 1995 when 2 patients with AIDS developed delu-
sions,anxiety,andagitationfollowingtreatmentwithclarithro-

several case reports raised concerns that clarithromycin might
be associated with neuropsychiatric events in patients with or
without other long-term comorbidities, such as renal disease,
hypertension, and obstructive airway disease.4-16 One litera-
ture review reported 38 adult patients with clarithromycin-
inducedneuropsychiatriceventsalsosuggestingapossiblelink
betweenclarithromycinandneuropsychiatricevents.17Mostof
the reported neuropsychiatric symptoms were related to psy-
choticmanifestationsandcognitivedisturbances.17 Inthesere-
ports, the neuropsychiatric symptoms seemed to be resolved
after discontinuation of clarithromycin treatment. Notably,
clarithromycin was frequently reported to be associated with
mania based on unpublished reports from the World Health
Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration.18
Apart from clarithromycin monotherapy, neuropsychiat-
ric symptoms were also observed in patients receiving H pylori
therapy containing clarithromycin.19-25 Despite signal detec-
tion implicating clarithromycin as the causative agent of neu-
ropsychiatric events, to our knowledge, no population-based
study has been conducted to assess and evaluate the neuro-
psychiatric risk associated with clarithromycin.
Patients receiving clarithromycin might have a higher risk
of severe acute infections than those prescribed amoxicillin
or other penicillins. Owing to different underlying neuropsy-
chiatric risks, indication bias might result in findings of non-
causal associations. In our previous work, we examined the
association between cardiovascular events and clarithromy-
cin using the cohort of H pylori therapy containing clarithro-
mycin in a secondary analysis to reduce confounding.26 Using
similar methods, we further explored the safety consider-
ations of clarithromycin in this study by investigating the as-
sociation between H pylori therapy containing clarithromy-
cin and acute neuropsychiatric events.
Methods
Data Sources
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong
Kong West Cluster. The data were retrieved from the Clinical
Data Analysis and Reporting System database, which is devel-
oped and managed by the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong.27
The Hospital Authority currently manages 42 public hospi-
talsandinstitutions,47specialistoutpatientclinics,and73gen-
eral outpatient clinics.28 More than 7 million local residents
have access to these primary, secondary, and tertiary public
health care services through 7 hospital clusters.27 In the
Hospital Authority, the Clinical Management System was es-
tablished as a clinical workstation to provide access to wards
and ambulatory settings, as well as laboratory, radiology, and
pharmacy systems in public hospitals and clinics. The clini-
cal information is directly recorded into the Clinical Manage-
ment System by clinicians and other health care profession-
als. The health records in the Clinical Management System are
then routinely transferred to the Clinical Data Analysis and
Reporting System for audit and research purposes. Since 1993,
the electronic health records in the Clinical Data Analysis and
Reporting System have included patient demographics and
clinical data such as diagnosis, operation, prescription use,
accident and emergency visits, and outpatient and inpatient
visits. A unique patient identifier is generated for each indi-
vidual patient to link all medical records. To protect patient
confidentiality, all medical records are anonymized. This
database has been used to conduct high-quality epidemiologi-
cal studies in Hong Kong26,29,30 and multinational pharmaco-
vigilance studies.31,32
Study Design
The self-controlled case series method is a case-only
approachforeliminatingbetween-personconfounding.Itcom-
pares the rate of outcomes in risk periods with baseline within
individuals, derived from cohort methodology.33 The analy-
sis is based on individuals who must have had both the expo-
sure and the event. In Hong Kong, H pylori infection is diag-
nosed during endoscopy by rapid urease test or histologic
analysis before treatment, and empirical therapy is not a com-
mon practice. In this study, the exposure of interest was
H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin in the outpatient
setting. We defined it as coprescription of clarithromycin with
either amoxicillin or metronidazole and one of the PPIs with
British National Formulary recommended doses (eTable 1 in
theSupplement)becausetherearenootherindicationsforthis
coprescription. The coprescriptions must share the same pre-
scriptionstartdatewithanoverlappingdurationof7to14days.
We estimated the treatment duration by adding 1 day to the
difference of prescription end date and prescription start date.
The application of a strict definition increases the precision of
identifying such exposure to avoid introducing bias from
identifying other acute infection indications.
Key Points
Question Is there an association between the use of Helicobacter
pylori therapy containing clarithromycin and acute
neuropsychiatric events?
Findings In this study of 66 559 patients, 1824 patients receiving
H pylori treatment with clarithromycin had an incident
neuropsychiatric event, a 4-fold statistically significant increase
during a 14-day treatment period. The risk was not raised before
treatment and returned to baseline incidence after treatment.
Meaning The risk of neuropsychiatric events during the use
of H pylori treatment with clarithromycin is short-term and will
usually resolve after cessation of treatment and psychiatric
intervention can be avoided.

The primary outcome was the first recorded acute com-
posite neuropsychiatric events, while secondary outcomes
were the first recorded psychotic events and first recorded cog-
nitive impairment as principal diagnosis for an inpatient or ac-
cident and emergency admission. All cases were identified ac-
cording to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Based on the
symptoms (ie, psychosis, delirium, mood, and sleep distur-
bances) described in the identified case reports,19-25 a list of
diagnostic codes that describes acute and possibly drug-
induced clinical conditions for neuropsychiatric events was
developed and independently reviewed by 2 local clinical
psychiatrists (E.H.M.L. and W.C.C.). To enhance the reliabil-
ity and validity of the case definition, a final list of diagnostic
codes was then confirmed by consensus in meetings involv-
ing psychiatrists and researchers.
Patients who were at least 18 years old and had received at
least1outpatientprescriptionofHpyloritherapycontainingcla-
rithromycin during the study period (from January 1, 2003, to
December31,2012)wereidentified.Iftherewasaprecedinggap
of more than 7 days with no prescription, this was defined as a
new prescription. To remove those patients with more severe
health issues identified on the prescription date, patients who
received any clarithromycin prescription or inpatient therapy
prior to the first outpatient therapy were excluded. Follow-up
was censored if patients received a clarithromycin prescrip-
tion or inpatient therapy after the first outpatient therapy. This
cohort of patients with H pylori therapy containing clarithro-
mycin was also described in our previous publication.26
The observation period (Figure) started 1 year after pa-
tients entered the database, and follow-up was censored at the
studyenddate,death,oranycensoringeventsdescribedherein.
Because treatment duration for each prescription ranged from
7 to 14 days, 2 risk periods were defined as follows: current use
(days 1-14 since prescription start date) and recent use (days
15-30). To correct the estimates if the exposures are event de-
pendent, we also separated a 14-day preexposure period from
the baseline. This could address bias resulting from change in
baseline incidence in the period just before the exposure if the
event alters the likelihood of subsequent exposure.
Statistical Analyses and Sensitivity Analyses
Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with age adjustment in single years
were estimated using the conditional Poisson regression, com-
paring the rate of events during risk periods with that during
baseline.
Because events identified on the first day of prescription
might reflect the underlying health status of the patient rather
than being induced by the therapy of interest, we conducted
a sensitivity analysis by either removing the first day of pre-
scription from current use of treatment or including it in the
preexposure period (ie, we considered only days 2-14). We car-
ried out additional sensitivity analysis to divide current use
into 2 periods (days 1-7 and days 8-14). Another sensitivity
analysis was conducted to include other ICD-9 codes, which
have nonspecific descriptions for psychotic events to test the
robustness of the outcome identification (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Because metronidazole has infrequently been
reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric events,34-37
we conducted additional sensitivity analyses that included
patients with H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin,
amoxicillin, and PPIs only.
We estimated the crude absolute risk with 95% CIs for all
outcomes as the number of events occurred during current use
divided by the total number of identified outpatient H pylori
therapy containing clarithromycin.30

A post hoc nested case-control analysis among patients
withoutpatientHpyloritherapycontainingclarithromycinwas
conducted to validate the findings of the primary outcome in
the self-controlled case series analysis. Patients were eligible
if they were at least 18 years old at the prescription start date.
Follow-up commenced from the date of first outpatient pre-
scription until study end date, death, occurrence of event, or
any censoring events described in the self-controlled case se-
ries analysis. We identified cases within the study period and
then randomly matched 4 controls at most to each case by year
of birth and sex using the incidence density sampling method.
We defined current and recent exposure periods similar to the
self-controlled case series analysis (Figure). Only the current
exposure period was considered if the prescription spanned
the current and recent exposure periods. Using conditional lo-
gistic regression, we estimated the crude and adjusted odds
ratios with adjusted variables of psychiatric service use in pub-
lic sector and the use of other drugs (diuretics, calcium chan-
nel blockers, bronchodilators, psychotropic drugs, antiepilep-
tic drugs, antiparkinsonian drugs, antiretroviral drugs, oral
corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) in
the previous 365 days prior to the event.
The statistical analyses were conducted independently by
2 investigators (A.Y.S.W. and C.S.L.C.) for quality assurance. All
statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS soft-
ware (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc) and R (version 3.2.0; http:
//www.R-project.org).
Results
A total of 66 559 patients who were at least 18 years old and
had received at least 1 outpatient prescription of H pylori
therapycontainingclarithromycinduringthestudyperiodwere
identified. Their mean (SD) age at cohort entry was 50.8 (14.8
years); their mean age at first exposure was 55.4 (14.8) years,
and 30 910 were male (46.4%). A total of 1824 patients were
identified with a first recorded composite neuropsychiatric
event (eFigure 1 in the Supplement), 354 with a first recorded
psychotic event, and 726 with a first recorded cognitive im-
pairment within the study period (Table 1). eTable 3 in the
Supplement shows the top 3 most frequently reported diag-
nostic codes for each outcome.
Table 2 shows the IRRs of all outcomes. Comparing cur-
rent use with the baseline, the IRR for composite neuropsy-
chiatric events was 4.12 (95% CI, 2.94-5.76) (35 events during
72 person-years) and was reduced to 0.95 (95% CI, 0.49-1.83)
during recent use (9 events during 82 person-years). No in-
creased risk could be found during the preexposure period (14
events during 72 person-years) vs baseline (1766 events dur-
ing 16 665 person-years). For psychotic events, an increased
IRR of 5.42 (95% CI, 2.77-10.60) was found during current use
(9 events during 14 person-years) but not in other risk periods
vs baseline. The risk of cognitive impairment was nearly 2- to
3-fold higher during current use (9 events during 28 person-
years; IRR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.36-5.09]), but there was no evi-
dence of increased risk for all other risk periods. Similar to the
primary analyses, increased IRRs were also found during days
2to14sincetheprescriptionstartdateforalloutcomesvsbase-
line (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement). The sensitivity analy-
sis in which current use was divided into days 1 to 7 and days
8 to 14 still showed an increased risk for primary outcome and
psychotic events. For cognitive impairment, an increased risk
was observed from days 1 to 14 but not for days 1 to 7. The in-
significant finding for the former period was likely due to un-
stable estimates resulting from small sample size (eTable 6 in
the Supplement). After including the nonspecific ICD-9 codes
in the sensitivity analysis, a similar temporal pattern could also
beobserved(eTable7intheSupplement).Foradditionalanaly-
ses that considered only therapy containing clarithromycin,
amoxicillin, and PPIs, increased risk during current use was
still observed for all outcomes (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
A total of 77 758 outpatient H pylori therapy containing
clarithromycin prescriptions were identified during the

study period. The crude absolute risk of neuropsychiatric
events, psychotic events, and cognitive impairment during
current use of therapy were 0.45 (95% CI, 0.32-0.63), 0.12
(95% CI, 0.06-0.22), and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.06-0.22) per 1000
prescriptions, respectively.
Similar to self-controlled case series analysis, we found
increased crude and adjusted odds ratios during treatment
in the nested case-control analysis (eTables 9 and 10 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
Relative to baseline incidence, the incidence of neuropsychi-
atric events was approximately 4-fold higher during the cur-
rent use of H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin. Nota-
bly, the risk returned to baseline incidence during recent use
oftreatment,suggestingthattheriskofneuropsychiatricevents
is short-term. In our previous study,26 we highlighted the car-
diovascular safety issues of clarithromycin and recom-
mended that clarithromycin should be prescribed with cau-
tion in patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk. In this
study, however, given the low absolute neuropsychiatric risk,
an abrupt change in prescribing practice based on the ob-
served increase in neuropsychiatric events is not suggested,
particularly in the absence of better treatment alternatives.
Similar to our previous study,26 clinicians should also be well
informed of transient neuropsychiatric events associated with
this treatment. Such transient neuropsychiatric events will
usually resolve spontaneously after treatment cessation, and
psychiatric interventions can be avoided.
Because the self-controlled case series analysis is suit-
able for investigating the association between transient expo-
sure and acute outcome,33 this method was used in our study
to eliminate time-invariant confounders. However, similar to
other observational study designs, it is still susceptible to time-
varyingconfounders,suchasashort-termchangeinhealthsta-
tus and the use of other drugs. To address this, we further ad-
justed for the use of other drugs in the nested case-control
study analysis and found similar results.
Notably,acuteinfection(eg,pneumonia)mightleadtosub-
stantialshort-termincreasedriskofneuropsychiatricevents.38
Because H pylori is by nature a chronic infection, it is unlikely
to temporally change the incidence of neuropsychiatric events
shortly before and after treatment initiation. Therefore, it is
less likely to lead to a spurious short-term association be-
tween therapy and outcome. Another consideration was that
if the neuropsychiatric events were due to the infection rather
than therapy, we would have observed an increased risk dur-
ingthepreexposureperiod.Becausethiswasnotobserveddur-
ing the preexposure period in any of the analyses, we can con-
clude that the short-term increased risk of neuropsychiatric
events is more likely to be attributable to the therapy than the
infection itself.
Because we investigated H pylori therapy as the expo-
sure, we could not pinpoint which drug in the regimen con-
tributed to the neuropsychiatric events in our study. We hy-
pothesized that clarithromycin is the most probable drug
because very limited evidence suggested that neuropsychiat-
ric events are associated with amoxicillin39,40 or PPIs.41-43 We
also conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of
the result when metronidazole (for which there are some re-
ports of association with neuropsychiatric events compared
withotheringredients)34-37wasremovedfromtheanalysis.The
increased risk of neuropsychiatric events during current use
still remained. In addition, a case report raised an interesting
and important case in which a patient who should have re-
ceived clarithromycin, lansoprazole, and amoxicillin for
H pylori eradication inadvertently took ciprofloxacin instead
of clarithromycin for a week owing to a dispensing error. The
neuropsychiatric symptoms did not appear until 2 days after
the patient changed back to the correct regimen (ie,
clarithromycin).25 Moreover, all the identified cases remitted
1 to 3 days after treatment discontinuation in the current
literature.19-25 Therefore, clarithromycin is the most prob-
able culprit to increase neuropsychiatric risk. Although the po-
tential effect of other drugs in the regimen could not be en-
tirely ruled out, the evidence in our study still suggests that
H pylori therapy containing clarithromycin as a whole in-
creases short-term neuropsychiatric risk. This should be
brought to the attention of prescribers. Further research is
needed to evaluate the neuropsychiatric risk associated with
different drugs in the regimen.
While macrolides diffusion to the central nervous system
is considered to be poor,44 the mechanism pathway govern-
ing its neuropsychiatric adverse effect is still unknown. Sev-
eral explanations have been postulated, including direct toxic
effects on the central nervous system by the active metabo-
lite of clarithromycin (14-hydroxyclarithromycin), altera-
tions in the metabolism of cortisol, prostaglandin, and other
hormones associated with neuropsychiatric events, as well as
interactions with neurotransmitters (glutamate and gamma-
aminobutyric acid).17,18 Further research is warranted to
explore these hypotheses.
Withreferencetothetemporalassociationanddosage,our
findings are consistent with the results of many potential cases
ofclarithromycin-inducedneuropsychiatricevents,whichwere
summarized in a review.17 This review reported that neuro-
psychiatric symptoms manifested 1 to 10 days after receiving
clarithromycin treatment, which is in line with our results. It
alsoseemsthathigh-doseclarithromycin(>1000mg/dfortreat-
ment of Mycobacterium avium complex or Mycobacterium
abscessus lung infection) is not a necessary condition for neu-
ropsychiatric events.3,17,18,45 In our study, patients were pre-
scribed the British National Formulary usual recommended
dose (1000 mg/d or 500 mg/d).
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study
investigating this association using the self-controlled case
series method to eliminate any fixed residual confounding. In
addition, comprehensive linkages between public hospitals
and outpatient clinics health services provided accurate case
ascertainment in our database. Although the retrospective na-
ture of our study precludes us from conducting prospective
structuredinterviewstoconfirmdiagnoses,inaccuraciesinthe
ascertainment of cases are minimized because the diagnostic
codes for each inpatient case in public hospitals in Hong Kong

nician. Previous studies using similar methods to ascertain
other clinical outcomes by the Clinical Data Analysis and
Reporting System have reported high positive predictive val-
ues for events such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding,29 myo-
cardial infarction,26 stroke,26 autism spectrum disorders, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder(K.K.Man;emailcom-
munication; February 17, 2016). Moreover, if we assume the
likelihood of diagnostic inaccuracy was the same during the
risk period and baseline, this error would underestimate the
association and increase the likelihood of a negative finding.
Our study is limited to patients with H pylori infection; there-
fore, our findings are less generalizable to patients who have
been prescribed clarithromycin for other indications. An-
other limitation is that we were not able to determine drug ad-
herence owing to limited data availability, and this might lead
to some degree of bias from misclassification of exposure. In
addition, clinical data from private health care setting are not
available in our database. However, we included patients who
used public health care services at least twice. These in-
cluded patients were very likely to use public health care ser-
vicesinsteadofprivateservices,becausethepublichealthcare
cost is heavily subsidized by the government.
Conclusions
This study found a short-term increased risk of neuropsychi-
atriceventsassociatedwithcurrentuseofHpyloritherapycon-
taining clarithromycin, and the temporal increased risk is in
full concordance with the treatment duration. Such transient
neuropsychiatric events will usually resolve spontaneously af-
ter treatment cessation and psychiatric interventions can be
avoided.
