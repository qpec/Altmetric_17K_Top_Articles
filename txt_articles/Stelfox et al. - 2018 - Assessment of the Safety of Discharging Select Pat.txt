IMPORTANCE The safety of discharging adult patients recovering from critical illness directly
home from the intensive care unit (ICU) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To compare the health care utilization and clinical outcomes for ICU patients
discharged directly home from the ICU with those of patients discharged home via the
hospital ward.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective population-based cohort study of adult
patients admitted to the ICU of 9 medical-surgical hospitals from January 1, 2014, to January
1, 2016, with 1-year follow-up after hospital discharge. All adult ICU patients were discharged
home alive from hospital, and the propensity score matched cohort (1:1) was based on patient
characteristics, therapies received in the ICU, and hospital characteristics.
EXPOSURES Patient disposition on discharge from the ICU: directly home vs home via the
hospital ward.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was readmission to the hospital
within 30 days of hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes were emergency department
visit within 30 days and death within 1 year.
RESULTS Among the 6732 patients included in the study, 2826 (42%) were female; median
age, 56 years (interquartile range, 41-67 years); 922 (14%) were discharged directly home,
with significant variation found between hospitals (range, 4.4%-44.0%). Compared with
patients discharged home via the hospital ward, patients discharged directly home were
younger (median age 47 vs 57 years; P < .001), more likely to be admitted with a diagnosis of
overdose, substance withdrawal, seizures, or metabolic coma (32% [295] vs 10% [594];
P < .001), to have a lower severity of acute illness on ICU admission (median APACHE II score
15 vs 18; P < .001), and receive less than 48 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation (42%
[389] vs 34% [1984]; P < .001). In the propensity score matched cohort (n = 1632), patients
discharged directly home had similar length of ICU stay (median, 3.1 days vs 3.0 days; P = .42)
but significantly shorter length of hospital stay (median, 3.3 days vs 9.2 days; P < .001)
compared with patients discharged home via the hospital ward. There were no significant
differences between patients discharged directly home or home via the hospital ward for
readmission to the hospital (10% [n = 81] vs 11% [n = 92]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI,
0.64-1.20) or emergency department visit (25% [n = 200] vs 26% [n = 212]; HR, 0.94; 95%
CI, 0.81-1.09) within 30 days of hospital discharge. Four percent of patients in both groups
died within 1 year of hospital discharge (n = 31 and n = 34 in the discharged directly home and
discharged home via the hospital ward groups, respectively) (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-1.35).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The discharge of select adult patients directly home from the
ICU is common, and it is not associated with increased health care utilization or increased
mortality.

 P
atients recovering from critical illness have historically
been transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to a
hospital ward before being discharged home.1,2 These
transitions allow patients to progressively receive lower-
intensity care, physical and functional assessments, and reha-
bilitation before returning to the community.2,3 However, long
waits for hospital ward beds in many health care systems have
resulted in a new model of care where select patients recover-
ing from critical illness are discharged directly home from the
ICU.4,5
The discharge of preterm infants directly home from neo-
natalICUshasbeenwelldescribed,showninrandomizedclini-
cal trials to be safe and efficient,6,7 and endorsed in guide-
lines from professional societies.8 Conversely, the discharge
of adult patients directly home from the ICU has only been re-
cently described,5,9-13 has not been comparatively evaluated
with the historical model of patient discharge via the hospital
ward, and is not mentioned in guidelines from professional
societies.2 Data are lacking regarding the safety of discharg-
ing adult patients directly home from the ICU.
Methods
We used a population-based, retrospective, cohort study de-
sign to compare the characteristics, health care utilization, and
outcomes of ICU patients recovering from critical illness who
were discharged directly home from the ICU with those dis-
charged home after a stay on a hospital ward. We selected this
design because it was a practical approach to provide timely
safety information to inform evolving clinical practice and fu-
ture randomized clinical trials.14 Study methods were con-
ducted and reported in accordance with recommendations of
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.15 The health research eth-
ics boards at the University of Calgary approved this study
(REB16-0191), waiving patient written informed consent.
Study Cohort
We identified consecutive patients 18 years or older admitted
to 9 medical-surgical ICUs in 9 hospitals in 2 cities in Alberta,
Canada from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2016; all patients
were discharged alive from the hospital to their home. Pa-
tients were excluded if their home was located outside of Al-
berta. The first hospital admission was used if patients were
admitted to the hospital more than once during the study pe-
riod. The last ICU admission was used if patients were admit-
ted to the ICU more than once during the same hospital ad-
mission. The ICUs were closed medical-surgical units (able to
provide invasive monitoring, vasoactive medications, and
mechanical ventilation), staffed by accredited intensive care
physicians, and included vascular surgery, thoracic surgery,
neurosurgery, trauma, and transplant patients.16
The exposure variable was patient disposition on ICU dis-
charge. The exposed group comprised patients discharged di-
rectlyfromtheICUtohome,bypassingastayonahospitalward
(hereinafter referred to as directly home). The nonexposed
group comprised patients transferred from the ICU to a hos-
pital ward (unit not able to provide invasive monitoring, va-
soactive medications, and mechanical ventilation) and sub-
sequently discharged home (hereinafter referred to as home
via the hospital ward).16 None of the hospitals had guidelines
to inform the discharge of patients directly home from the ICU.
Data Sources
We used data from 3 databases that have previously been used
for program evaluation and research.17,18 eCritical Alberta pro-
spectively captures demographic, clinical, and outcome data
for all patients admitted to the study ICUs using a fully inte-
grated bedside electronic medical record (MetaVision;
iMDsoft).19 The discharge abstract database captures data on
all hospitalized patients, including dates of admission, dis-
charge, and death, up to 25 Canadian Enhancement of Inter-
national Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision,
diagnostic codes, and up to 20 Canadian Classification of
Health Interventions procedure codes.20 The National Ambu-
latory Care Reporting System Metadata (NACRS) captures data
on all emergency department visits.21
Patient and Hospital Factors
We identified, a priori, factors that may affect health care uti-
lization and outcomes of patients recovering from critical ill-
nessafterdischargehome.1,22,23Patientfactorsincludeddemo-
graphic variables (age, sex); comorbidities; ICU admission
diagnosis24; illness severity on ICU admission (Acute Physi-
ology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score and
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score in the first
24 hours in the ICU) and at ICU discharge (SOFA score on the
last day in the ICU); interventions received in the ICU (me-
chanical ventilation, vasoactive medications, renal replace-
ment therapy); and community support prescribed at hospi-
tal discharge (services from an external agency including
attendant care, home care, food home delivery, homemak-
ing, and supportive housing).20 The presence of comorbidi-
ties was derived using the Deyo classification of the Charlson
Comorbidity Index and validated by Canadian Enhancement
of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Re-
vision, coding algorithms.25 Hospital factors included teach-
ing status, number of hospital and ICU beds, number of
Key Points
Question What are the health care utilization and clinical
outcomes for adult patients discharged from the intensive care
unit (ICU) directly home compared with those discharged home
via the hospital ward?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 6732 ICU
patients discharged home from 9 hospitals, 14% went directly
home from the ICU, and 86% went first to a hospital ward from
which they were subsequently discharged home; the proportions
of these 2 groups with a readmission to the hospital (10% vs 11%)
or with an emergency department visit (25% vs 26%) within 30
days of discharge were not significantly different. About 4% of
patients in each group died within 1 year of initial discharge home.
Meaning Discharging select patients directly home from the ICU
is not associated with increased health care utilization or mortality.

 patient discharges directly home (<1 vs â¥1 patient per week),
ICU occupancy (percentage), and transfer delay (time from
when a patient was determined to be ready for ICU discharge
to when the patient left the ICU).26,27
Health Care Utilization and Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was readmission to the hospital within
30 days.28-30 We examined 2 secondary outcomes: (1) emer-
gency department visits within 30 days and (2) death at 365
days.
Statistical Analyses
We used multivariable generalized estimating equation logis-
tic regression models with an exchangeable correlation struc-
ture accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals to
determine factors associated with a patient being discharged
directly home. We used Cox proportional hazards regression
models accounting for clustering of patients within hospitals
to determine factors associated with hospital readmission or
an emergency department visit within 30 days of discharge for
patients discharged directly home from the ICU. As agreed a
priori, variables with P < .20 in univariable analyses were en-
teredintoeachmodelandsequentiallyeliminateduntilallvari-
ables had P < .10. Sensitivity analyses were used to adjust for
patient characteristics.
Comparisons between patients discharged directly home
and home via the hospital ward were conducted both in the
overall study cohort and in a propensity score matched
cohort. Patients discharged directly home were matched to
patients discharged home via the hospital ward using 1:1 pro-
pensity score matching. The propensity score was estimated
using a logistic regression model based on patient character-
istics (age, sex, comorbidities, previous ICU admission, ICU
admission diagnosis, location before ICU admission, admis-
sion APACHE II score, admission SOFA score, discharge SOFA
score), therapies received in the ICU (mechanical ventilation,
vasoactive medications, renal replacement therapy), and
hospital characteristics (hospital, ICU occupancy at dis-
charge, individual patient transfer delays).31,32 Nearest-
neighbor matching (R package software, version 3.4; MatchIt)
was performed, without replacement, using the logit of the
propensity score and a specified caliper width equal to 0.2 of
the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score.33
The final propensity score model had a C statistic of 0.85 and
McFadden R2 value of 0.27. Model performance was similar
when variables with continuous data were treated as con-
tinuous or categorized using clinically relevant thresholds.
(Note that of the 899 patients discharged directly home with
complete data, 83 could not be matched within the specified
propensity score caliper width of 0.2 and so were excluded
from the matched analyses, leaving 816 patients for propen-
sity score matching.)
Time to first hospital readmission; first subsequent emer-
gency department visit; and mortality at 30, 90, and 365 days
after hospital discharge were compared between patients dis-
charged directly home and home via the hospital ward using
the Kaplan-Meier method to determine cumulative inci-
dence. For the overall cohort, Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to adjust for baseline character-
istics and accounted for clustering of patients within hospi-
tals by using robust standard errors. For the propensity-
matched cohort, no adjustments were made, and analyses
accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals. All
analyses were performed using R software, version 3.4.0
(2017-04-21).34
Results
Study Population
The cohort consisted of 6732 patients admitted to 9 medical-
surgical ICUs and discharged alive from the hospital to their
home (Figure 1). Among these, 922 were discharged directly
home (14%) and 5810 were discharged home via the hospital
ward (86%). The proportion of patients discharged directly
home varied substantially across hospitals (range, 4.4%-
44.0%) and was higher at those hospitals that were non-
teaching and had fewer ICU and hospital beds (eFigure in the
Supplement).
Compared with patients discharged home via the hospi-
tal ward, patients discharged directly home were younger (me-
dian age, 47 vs 57 years; P < .001), less likely to have 1 or more
comorbidities (39% [n = 360] vs 65% [n = 3774]; P < .001), less
likely to have been admitted to the ICU from the operating or
recovery room (11% [n = 98] vs 29% [n = 1669]; P < .001), and
were less acutely ill in the first 24 hours in the ICU (median
APACHE II score 15 vs 18; P < .001) (Table 1). The most fre-
quent ICU admission diagnoses among patients discharged di-
rectly home were overdose (23%; n = 208); pneumonia (11%;
n = 104);andtraumaororthopedicinjuries(9%;n = 79)(eTable
1 in the Supplement). During the ICU stay, patients dis-
charged directly home were less likely to receive invasive me-
chanical ventilation (56% [n = 514] vs 64% [n = 3714]; P < .001)
or vasoactive medications (19% [n = 176] vs 38% [n = 2204];
P < .001). In multivariable logistic regression analyses, pa-
tients were more likely to be discharged directly home from
the ICU if their ICU admission diagnosis was overdose, with-
drawal, seizures, or metabolic coma; if they received less than
48 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation; or if they spent
more than 24 hours in ICU after being determined ready for
discharge (supporting data found in eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Conversely, patients were less likely to be discharged
directly home if they were older; admitted to the ICU from an
operating or recovery room or hospital ward; had a previous
ICU admission during the hospital stay; or had higher sever-
ity of acute illness on admission or discharge (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Health Care Utilization and Clinical Outcomes
Due to missing patient characteristics for 105 patients (1.6%),
propensity scores were calculated for 899 patients (97%) dis-
charged directly home and 5728 patients (99%) discharged
home via the hospital ward. Of the 899 patients discharged di-
rectly home with complete data, 83 could not be matched
within the specified propensity score caliper width (0.2) and
so were excluded from the matched analyses. The remaining

 816 (91%) were matched to patients discharged home via the
hospital ward, resulting in a matched cohort of 1632 patients
(Table 1).
In the propensity score matched cohort, patients dis-
charged directly home had similar length of ICU stay (me-
dian, 3.1 days vs 3.0 days; P = .42), but significantly shorter
length of hospital stay (median, 3.3 days vs 9.2 days; P < .001)
than patients discharged home via the hospital ward. Pa-
tients discharged directly home were more likely to leave
against medical advice (6% [n = 45] vs 4% [n = 31]) and less
likelytobeprescribedcommunitysupportservices(6%[n = 52]
vs 16% [n = 131]) at the time of hospital discharge (P < .001).
After hospital discharge, there were no significant differ-
ences in health care utilization or in outcomes between pa-
tients discharged directly home or home via the hospital ward
(supporting data reported in Table 2 and Figure 2). Thirty days
after hospital discharge, 10% of patients discharged directly
home (n = 81) had been readmitted to the hospital compared
with 11% of patients discharged home via the hospital ward
(n = 92) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.20). Approxi-
mately one-quarter of patients in both groups had an emer-
gency department visit within 30 days of hospital discharge
(25% [n = 200] vs 26% [n = 212]; HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-
1.09). A small proportion of patients, in both groups, died
within 1 year of hospital discharge (4% [n = 31 directly home]
vs 4% [n = 34 via hospital ward]; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-
1.35). Subgroup analyses of patients according to the most
common ICU admission diagnoses (overdose, withdrawal, sei-
zures,metaboliccoma,pneumonia,andrespiratoryother)pro-
duced similar results (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Multivari-
able adjusted analyses of the overall study cohort produced
similar findings (Table 2). Mortality is a competing risk for hos-
pital readmission and emergency department visit, and the
results from competing risk models were similar.35
Risk Factors for Hospital Readmission or Emergency
Department Visit for Patients Discharged Directly Home
Of the 29 patient and hospital factors evaluated (eTable 4 in the
Supplement), 5 were found to be associated with hospital re-
admissionoremergencydepartmentvisitwithin30daysofdis-
charge for patients discharged directly home: (1) ICU admis-
sion diagnosis of overdose, withdrawal, seizures, or metabolic
coma;(2)durationofinvasivemechanicalventilationof48hours
or longer; (3) hospital with 600 or more beds; (4) ICU with 1 or
more patients discharged directly home per week; and (5) leav-
ing against medical advice (Table 3). After adjustment for pa-
tient factors, only prescription of community supports, leav-
ing against medical advice, and ICUs with 1 or more patient
discharged directly home per week remained statistically
significant (Table 3).
Discussion
In this population-based, multicenter cohort study, we ob-
served that more than 1 in 10 adult patients recovering from
critical illness were discharged directly home from a medical-
surgical ICU. These patients had similar lengths of ICU stay, but
shorter lengths of hospital stay, compared with patients dis-
charged home via the hospital ward. In the subsequent year,

 discharged directly home, factors associated with readmis-
sion to the hospital or an emergency department visit within
30 days included leaving against medical advice, prescrip-
tion of community supports, and discharge from an ICU with
1 or more patients discharged directly home each week. Our
study suggests that discharging select patients directly home
from the ICU is not associated with increased health care uti-
lization or worse outcomes.
While the transfer of patients from the ICU to a hospital
ward before discharge home has been extensively studied,
much less is known about the discharge of patients from the
ICU directly home.1,2 Both discharge processes are likely to
have common and distinct elements. What do we know
about the discharge of adult patients directly home from
ICU? Three articles have reported this practice in the context
of palliative care, where patients were discharged home to
die.9-11 Chawla et al12 conducted a retrospective cohort study
of adult patients discharged directly home from a 20-bed
medical-surgical ICU at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center between 2008 and 2010. During the study period, 5%
of all patients discharged alive from the ICU were discharged
directly home. Of these, 23% had an unplanned readmission
to the hospital within 30 days, and two-thirds of these read-
missions were for problems related to the prior ICU admis-
sion. A single study in the cardiology literature surveyed 425
patients discharged directly home and reported that within 6
weeks of discharge, 28% of patients had made an unsched-
uled return visit to a hospital or physicianâ
s office.13 The qual-
ity of care was reported to be good to outstanding by 91% of
patients, although 18% reported a perception that they had
been discharged prematurely.13 Lau et al5 reported that the
proportion of patients discharged directly home from 2
medical-surgical ICUs at a health sciences center increased
from 3% of patients in 2003 to 12% of patients in 2015. In a
follow-up study, the authors reported that only 5% of ICU
physicians felt very comfortable with discharging patients
directly home.36
Our study contributes to the literature by providing the
strongest data yet reported, to our knowledge, for health care
utilization and outcomes among patients discharged directly
home from the ICU. The results suggest that select adult pa-
tients recovering from critical illness are being discharged di-
rectly home from the ICU and that, compared with similar pa-
tients discharged home via the hospital ward, no important
differences in posthospital health care utilization or out-
comes were observed. Earlier findings of our research group
demonstrate that delays in patient discharge from ICU are
common,16 and data from the present study show that these
delays are strongly associated with discharge directly home.
One in 3 patients in the present cohort spent more than 24
hours in the ICU after being determined ready for ICU dis-
charge. This misallocation of resources may slow care pro-
gression for patients recovering from critical illness and limit
ICU access for other patients. The root causes of flow failure
need to be delineated and strategies developed to improve pa-
tient flow including ICU discharge.
We believe that one potential strategy to improve patient
flow through the health care system is to reconceptualize the
discharge of patients recovering from critical illness. First,
analogous to models used by many medical and surgical
hospital wards, discharge planning for ICU patients should
commence as early as possible, perhaps as soon as clinical re-
covery is anticipated.37 Early discharge planning would ex-
tend the concept of ICU liberation of critically ill patients from

 life support technologies to include transitions of care to help
patients, family caregivers, and clinicians prepare for patient
discharge.38
Second, select patients should be eligible to be discharged
directly home. The potential benefits include shortening hos-
pitallengthsofstay,reducingtransitionsofcare,decreasingflow
failure, and alleviating ICU capacity strain.39 However, strat-
egies are needed to make the discharge of patients directly
home from the ICU more effective. Our data suggest that this
practice varies widely across institutions and that most ICU
clinicians likely have little experience with it.
Furthermore, in the present study, all 3 factors associ-
ated with readmission to the hospital or an emergency depart-
ment visit within 30 days of a patient being discharged di-
rectly home were associated with characteristics of the ICU or
the discharge process, suggesting opportunities for improve-
ment. We recommend that ICUs develop discharge proce-
dures that include identification of candidate patients for
dischargedirectlyhome,developprotocolstofacilitatethepro-
cess, and train ICU clinicians (including trainees) in these pro-
cedures. Processes and outcomes of care for patients dis-
charged directly home from the ICU should be monitored to
ensure that patients are not exposed to increased risk and that
any burden of care is not inappropriately shifted to the com-
munity or family. Conversely, continuing to discharge all pa-
tients home via the hospital ward because that is how it has
been historically done would represent a missed opportunity
for improving efficiency.
Limitations
The results of our study need to be interpreted within the con-
text of its limitations. First, even with propensity score match-
ing using detailed patient and hospital characteristic data for
risk adjustment, residual confounding is an inherent risk of
observational studies. Nevertheless, our data provide a ro-
bust observational evaluation and can be used to provide clini-
calguidanceandjustifyequipoiseforrandomizedclinicaltrials.
For example, clinicians can now ask themselves whether they
are comfortable discharging a patient similar to one included
in the present study directly home if their risk of readmission
to the hospital within 30 days is approximately 10%. Second,
despite a cohort of more than 6000 patients, we are unable
to exclude small differences in mortality. Third, we are not able
to provide any information about ambulatory care visits or pri-
vate supports (eg, unpaid caregivers) utilized by patients af-
ter hospital discharge. Finally, our study was performed in a
single publicly funded health system. This was an important
strength of our methodology because it allowed us to mea-
sure health care utilization and outcomes for patients follow-
ing hospital discharge. However, allocation of resources and
decision-making processes may vary across health care sys-
tems, and the results may not apply to other institutions. We
are unaware of any studies that have compared the incidence
and experience with the discharge of patients directly home
from the ICU across different health care systems. Neverthe-
less, common challenges to the safe and efficient transition of
patients recovering from critical illness back home have been
documented in diverse health care systems.1
Conclusions
In summary, we found that the discharge of select adult pa-
tientsrecoveringfromcriticalillnessdirectlyhomefromtheICU
is common, associated with shorter hospital stays, but not as-
sociated with increased health care utilization or mortality in
theyearfollowinghospitaldischarge.Threeriskfactorsinclud-

Invited Commentary
The Complexity and Challenges of Intensive Care Unit
Admissions and Discharges
Similarities With All Hospitalized Patients
Kyan Safavi, MD, MBA; Jeanine Wiener-Kronish, MD; Dusan Hanidziar, MD, PhD
Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are hetero-
geneous in their underlying illnesses, comorbidities, and re-
quirements for either invasive or nearly continuous monitor-
ing of physiologic and laboratory values. There is also variance
in their need for mechanical
ventilation, renal replace-
ment therapy, and other me-
chanical support. Given this heterogeneity, it has been difficult
to make broad conclusions about âcritically illâ patients.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Stelfox and
colleagues1 report that more than 1 in 10 adult patients treated
in a medical-surgical ICU are sent home directly from the ICU
without experiencing an increase in health care utilization or
worseoutcomescomparedwiththosefirsttransferredtoahos-
pitalgeneralcareunitpriortodischargehome.Theseresultssug-
gestthattherearegroupsofpatientswhomayrequirelessmoni-
toring and support. Early recognition of this patient group and
establishment of alternative pathways to ICU admission might
decrease ICU utilization and the cost of hospitalization. On the
other hand, it is possible that the ICU is appropriate for a sub-
set of patients through their entire stay, and then they are ap-
propriately discharged directly home as soon as they are ready
fortransferoutoftheICU.Earlyidentificationofthisgroupbased
on patient characteristics and disease characteristics may help
the ICU team prospectively prepare the patient and family for
transition to home from the outset of ICU admission.
Transitioning from acute care to home is a complex pro-
cesswithsubstantialpatientsafetyimplications.Intensivecare
unitteamshavenottraditionallyfacedthischallengeandmust
be prepared to coordinate this process. Discharge planning in-
cludesphysicaltherapyandnursingassessmentsregardingmo-
bility, a sustainable nutrition plan, an appropriate home medi-
cation regimen, coordination of home care services, and close
outpatient follow-up. Care transition techniques previously
used in population health management that are aimed at in-
creasing safety and reducing readmissions may be appli-
cable. The better studied of these interventions include de-
livering the patientâ
s discharge medication regimen to the
bedside prior to discharge from the ICU; scheduling a fol-
low-up outpatient appointment within 7 days of discharge;
sending a care practitioner to the patientâ
s home during the
immediate discharge period; and creating clear and open lines
of communication for patients to reconnect with clinicians if
problems arise.2-4
Stelfox et al1 also identified several risk factors for read-
mission, including leaving against medical advice and lack of
community supports. These observations are congruent with
prior literature that has found that patient socioeconomic cir-
cumstances play a significant role in their risk of readmis-
sion. For example, insurance status, race, and home situation
have been associated with readmission risk.5 Patients dis-
charged directly from the ICU appear no different. Care coor-
dinators, social workers, and others who focus on designing
safe transition plans with the appropriate patient support sys-
tems in place may not typically see patients in the ICU, since
most patients are not discharged home from the ICU. Stelfox
