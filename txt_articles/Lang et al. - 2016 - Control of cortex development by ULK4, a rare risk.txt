Schizophrenia is a debilitating familial neuropsychiatric disorder which affects 1% of people worldwide. 
Although the heritability for schizophrenia approaches 80% only a small proportion of the overall 
genetic risk has been accounted for, and to date only a limited number of genetic loci have been 
definitively implicated. We have identified recently through genetic and in vitro functional studies, a 
novel serine/threonine kinase gene, unc-51-like kinase 4 (ULK4), as a rare risk factor for major mental 
disorders including schizophrenia. Now using the approach of in utero gene transfer we have discovered 
that Ulk4 plays a key modulatory role in corticogenesis. Knockdown of Ulk4 leads to significantly 
decreased cell proliferation in germinal zones and profound deficits in radial migration and neurite 
ramification. These abnormalities can be reversed successfully by Ulk4 gene supplementation. Ulk4 also 
regulated acetylation of α-tubulin, an important post-translational modification of microtubules. We 
conclude that Ulk4 plays an essential role in normal brain development and when defective, the risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia is increased.
Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling brain disorder with a life time risk around 1%. It is among the top 10 
causes of human disability worldwide. The causes are highly variable with both genetic and environmental fac-
tors predisposing to overall risk. Although heritability is estimated at between 60–80%, the genetic architecture 
and the molecular mechanisms remain controversial. Current treatments are palliative and do not alter overall 
prognosis.
Although schizophrenia normally presents in early adult life, overwhelming evidence indicates that it has a 
strong neurodevelopmental component1,2. An increased predisposition has been shown to stem from various 
developmental insults that occur at first, or early second trimester of pregnancy. These insults often cause molec-
ular changes which disturb the cellular architecture and neuronal connectivity and therefore interfere with brain 
maturation and integrity3. The neurodevelopmental model is based on rapidly growing knowledge from animal 
models4, environmental interactions5 and clinical findings including pre-existing morphological abnormalities in 
the brains of schizophrenia cases6 and behavioural changes in childhood before the onset of symptoms7,8.
It is essential to dissect out how genetic alterations predisposing to schizophrenia alter brain development 
and synaptic connectivity in order to understand the underlying pathogenesis. Unfortunately, despite large num-
bers of susceptibility genes having been proposed, only a small proportion of the overall genetic risk has been 
implicated robustly in human patients either by enrichment of rare gene copy number variations, or through 
genome-wide significant associations of common genetic variants9–11. Given the polygenic nature of schizophre-
nia, it is possible that manifestation of this condition represents the end point of many parallel and/or convergent 
pathogenic processes. Many more causative genes will need to be found and their underlying mechanisms under-
stood before it will be possible to use genetics clinically to aid diagnosis and to partition people at risk for early 
prevention and for stratified therapy.

Through a meta-analysis of several large cohorts worldwide, we reported recently a serine/threonine kinase 
gene, unc-51-like kinase 4 (ULK4), as a novel, rare risk factor for human schizophrenia, autism and major depres-
sion12. ULK4 belongs to the family of unc-51-like serine/threonine kinases which participates in a conserved 
pathway involving both endocytosis and axon growth13–15. Mutation of the unc-51 gene in C. elegans results in 
stalled axon outgrowth, aberrant axonal fasciculation and abnormal accumulation of intracellular membranous 
structures13. In Drosophila, Unc-51-mediated membrane vesicle transport is pivotal in axonal and dendritic devel-
opment. It aids targeted localization of guidance molecules and organelles which regulate the elongation and the 
compartmentalization of developing neurons and motor-cargo assembly16. Interestingly, although the biology of 
other members of unc 51-like kinases (ULK1-3) have been well documented17,18, the functions of ULK4 have been 
neglected and remain poorly understood.
Using a lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown approach, we have demonstrated that depletion of ULK4 in 
human neuroblastoma cells (SH5Y-SY) alters multiple signalling pathways (MAPK, p38, PKC, and JNK) associ-
ated closely with stress and schizophrenia. Consequently, the cells present abnormal cytoskeleton remodelling, 
reduced cell motility and reduced neuritogenesis12. These findings provide the first body of mechanistic evidence 
which potentially associates ULK4 with mental disorders.
The in vivo function of ULK4 is largely unknown especially in the context of neurodevelopment. Although 
Ulk4−/− mutant mice are available, the majority of them presents with severe congenital hydrocephalus due to 
disrupted motile cilia protruding from ependymal cells, which frequently associates with brain hemorrhage 
accompanied by fibrosis, neuroinflammation and neovascularization19. Importantly, hydrocephalus itself pro-
foundly impairs neurogenesis and disturbs brain development20–24. Therefore, caution is needed to interpret the 
phenotypes emanating from Ulk4−/− mice because they may result from the hydrocephalus and not from the 
direct consequences of Ulk4 deletion.
In this study, we have used the technique of in utero gene transfer and silenced Ulk4 successfully in subsets of 
neural progenitors in the developing mouse cortex. We have observed a spectrum of abnormal cell behaviours 
including deficits in cell proliferation, neurite ramification and in the temporal sequence of neural migration. 
Knockdown of Ulk4 leads to decreased acetylation of α 
-tubulin both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, supplement 
of a shRNA-resistant Ulk4 cDNA reversed the observed migration and neurite arborisation abnormalities. To 
our knowledge, our data indicate for the first time that Ulk4 regulates key cellular and molecular events essential 
for normal brain development and if perturbed, may contribute to the onset of major mental disorders including 
schizophrenia.
Results
Expression profile of Ulk4 transcripts in cerebral cortex. 
Previously, we reported abundant neuronal 
expression of ULK4 protein in adult human and mouse brains by immunohistochemistry12. To understand fur-
ther the precise function of Ulk4 in cortical development, we synthesized specific riboprobes and performed 
 
in situ hybridization in both embryonic and postnatal mouse brains. Ulk4 transcripts were detected widely in 
the E12.5 cortex, when active cortical neurogenesis takes place and brain lamination arises (Fig. 1A). In E15.5 
cortex, abundant hybridization signals were observed in the ventricular zone (VZ), subventricular zone (SVZ) 
and cortical plate, but only a weak signal was evident in the intermediate zone (Fig. 1B,C). This distribution pat-
tern highlights the potential regulatory roles of Ulk4 in both neural progenitors and post-mitotic neurons which 
have exited the cell cycle and initiate migration and differentiation. In E17.5 cortex, dense hybridization signals 
were located in cortical plate (CP) and were more prominent than in the intermediate zone and SVZ/VZ regions 
(Fig. 1D). At postnatal day 7, Ulk4 transcripts were distributed extensively in all cortical layers (Fig. 1E) and 
in adulthood (Fig. 1F), which mirrors our previous immunohistochemical findings12. Hybridization with sense 
probes also was carried out and no specific signals were detected (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results show 
wide and dynamic Ulk4 expression in both developing and postnatal cortex which strongly supports a modula-
tory role of Ulk4 in corticogenesis and functional maturation.
Knockdown of Ulk4 at E15.5 significantly affected corticogenesis. 
In view of the intense expression 
of Ulk4 mRNA in germinal zones of developing cortex, especially at E12.5 and E15.5 (Fig. 1A–C), we speculate 
that Ulk4 may regulate the proliferation of neural progenitors and thus control the expansion of stem cell pools. 
To obtain direct evidence for this hypothesis, we analysed the influence of Ulk4 knockdown through an in utero 
gene-transfer technique via electroporation.
We first tested the knockdown efficiency of Ulk4 shRNA268, 269 and 270 by co-transfection with Ulk4 
full-length cDNA (tagged with c-Myc and DDK) in HEK293 cells. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed 
and blotted with anti-Flag. The results showed that among the three Ulk4 shRNAs, 268 presented the strongest 
knockdown capacity whilst 270 displayed the weakest effect (Fig. 2A,B). Blotting with anti-c-Myc also demon-
strated similar knockdown capacity of the three shRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, shRNA268 and 269 
were chosen for functional analysis.
Panels of plasmids containing shRNA268 or 269 together with GFP were injected into lateral ventricles of 
E15.5 mouse brains prior to in utero electroporation. The embryonic brains were collected on the next day (E16.5) 
one hour after BrdU pulse injection. Immunostaining with anti-Ulk4 antibody demonstrated a successful Ulk4 
targeting (Supplementary Fig. S3). To estimate the proportion of transfected cells in S phase, immunostaining 
with anti-BrdU (Supplementary Fig. S4) was performed and the number of GFP/BrdU double-labelled cells was 
counted. The expression ratio was calculated by normalization against the total number of GFP-containing cells. 
Our results suggest that both Ulk4 shRNA268 group (n = 
 3, p < 
 0.02) and 269 group (n = 
 3, p < 
 0.001) have a 
significantly lower percentage of GFP/BrdU double-labelled cells compared with control group (n = 4) (Fig. 3A). 
These results strongly indicate that silencing Ulk4 in the developing brain significantly inhibits neural progenitor 
proliferation.

Knockdown of Ulk4 at E15.5 disturbed neuronal migration and neurite arborisation 
 
substantially. 
The strong expression of Ulk4 transcripts in the post-mitotic neurons prompted us to 
investigate the influence of Ulk4 on radial migration, a precisely-controlled process by which neurons move 
from their site of origin to the final laminar position. To address this question, we examined the distribu-
tion of GFP-traced cells in the P7 brains which underwent electroporation at E15.5. In the control group, 
the majority of neurons (born on E15.5) have completed migration and settled compactly in layers II–III 
(Fig. 4A), a highly vulnerable target region in schizophrenia. Strikingly, in the shRNA268 knockdown brains, 
GFP-positive neurons were located in loose arrays within layers II–III. In addition, many neurons were scattered 
along the migration route, and many others appeared trapped in the deeper cortical lamina close to the corpus 
callosum (Fig. 4B). We counted the number of GFP-positive cells in each individual layer and performed sta-
tistical comparison. The results show that compared with control brains (n = 
 3), knockdown brains contained 
significantly less GFP-positive cells in layers II–III (n = 
 3, p < 
 0.001), but high proportions of these cells in deeper 
layers (IV–VI) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4G), indicating a dramatically delayed neuronal migration.
To further validate the identities of neurons with Ulk4 knockdown, we carried out immunostaining by using 
antibodies against specific transcription factors including Satb2 (strongly expressed in cortical neurons, especially

layers II–III), Ctip2 (commonly used for layer V/VI) and Tbr1 (a marker for layer VI). Most of these GFP-traced 
cells in layers V–VI also expressed Satb2 (Fig. 3B, white arrows), however, almost no GFP-positive cells in deeper 
cortical layers displayed positive staining for either anti-Ctip2 (Fig. 3C, white arrowheads) or anti-Tbr1 (Fig. 3D, 
white arrowheads). Similarly, the GFP-positive cells in layer II–III also expressed Satb2, but did not display pos-
itive staining for both anti-Ctip2 and anti-Tbr1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This result suggests that Ulk4 knock-
down does not change the fate specification of these “trapped” GFP cells which are geographically “ectopic” layer 
II/III neurons.
In separate experiments, electroporation at E15.5 with low concentration of GFP (0.1μ 
g/μ 
l), which highlights 
fewer GFP-expressing neurons, was used to facilitate the morphological reconstruction of the GFP-expressing 
neurons by z-stack confocal scanning. In control cortex, the majority of cells in layers II–III presented the typical 
shape of pyramidal neurons, with a long apical dendrite branching out in an apical tuft which terminates in layer I 
 
(Fig. 4E). In the shRNA268 knockdown brains, most of the GFP-positive cells in the deeper layers developed 
stalled apical dendrites and had a poorly-formed apical tuft (Fig. 4C,D,F, white arrows). Intriguingly, some have 
an “ectopic” apical dendrite (Fig. 4C,F, white asterisks) and long secondary dendritic branching (Fig. 4F, white 
arrowheads) or an apical dendrite which did not stick out from the apex of the cell body (Fig. 4C, yellow arrow). 
We reconstructed and compared the dendritic trees between control and knockdown neurons using confocal 
microscopy. As expected, the GFP-labelled neurons in knockdown brains, regardless of position, presented sig-
nificantly reduced dendrite network complexity (Fig. 5A–C,E, 41 cells from 6 control brains, 33 cells in layers 
II–III from 4 shRNA268 brains, 30 cells in deeper layers from 3 shRNA268 brains; * 
* 
p < 
 0.01, * 
p < 
 0.05). This 
result is also in agreement with our previous observation that ULK4 deletion leads to a remarkable impairment 
of neuritogenesis in SHSY-5Y cells12.
We carried out the same sets of studies in shRNA269 knockdown brains in order to rule out any “off-target” 
effects. Although there was no significant migration delay in the deeper layers of the P7 knockdown brains 
(Fig. 4I), layers II–III however were slightly dispersed and full of loosely packed and aberrantly aligned 
GFP-positive neurons (Fig. 4H,I). Similarly, many of these cells had ectopic (Fig. 4I, inset i; Fig. 4K,L, white 
arrowheads), stalled (Fig. 4K, white arrows) or aborted apical dendrites (Fig. 4K,L, slim white arrows) and long 
secondary branching (Fig. 4K, asterisks), as was observed in the shRNA268 knockdown brains. Some cells had 
multiple apical dendrites with (Fig. 4N, white arrow, and inset n) or without a clearly predominant one (Fig. 4J, 
white arrow). In addition, areas containing dis-oriented cell populations which have lost the polarity of pyramidal 
neurons were apparent (Fig. 4M). Sholl analysis again showed that the knockdown cells had poorly-developed 
dendritic arborization (Fig. 5A,D,E, 37 cells from 6 shRNA269 brains).

Knockdown of Ulk4 leads to decreased acetylation of α-tubulin both in vitro and in vivo. 
How 
Ulk4 silencing leads to abnormal corticogenesis remains unclear. In our previous study, depletion of ULK4 in 
SHSY-5Y cells remarkably decreased acetylation of α 
-tubulin12. Intriguingly, reduced tubulin acetylation could 
result in profound deficits in radial migration and neurite ramification during brain development25,26 and disrupt 
hippocampal formation27. We therefore postulate that acetylated α 
-tubulin could be a component molecule of 
Ulk4 signalling which modulates corticogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we transfected primary cultured mouse 
cortical neurons with control and shRNA268 plasmids. The transfection efficiency was 76% and 74% respectively 
with no statistically significant difference (p > 
 0.05). We then determined the expression of acetylated α 
-tubulin 
by western blotting. Our results indeed showed that shRNA268 significantly reduced the expression of acetylated 
α 
-tubulin in the cultured neurons (n = 3, p < 0.05, Fig. 6A,B). In P7 brains, Ulk4 knockdown resulted in consist-
ently diminished expression of acetylated α 
-tubulin (Fig. 6C–H). The reduction of acetylated α 
-tubulin also was 
confirmed by imaging analysis in both primary cultured neurons and brain sections (Supplementary Fig. S6). 
Similarly, shRNA269 also led to reduced expression of acetylated α 
-tubulin in P7 mouse brains (Supplementary 
Fig. S7). These results suggest that acetylated α 
-tubulin may contribute at least partially, to the altered corticogen-
esis caused by Ulk4 knockdown.
Supplementation of Ulk4 successfully reversed the effects of Ulk4 silencing in vivo. 
To further 
validate that the deficits described above were directly caused by Ulk4 knockdown, we designed and cloned shR-
NA268-resistant Ulk4 cDNA (Ulk4R cDNA) by introducing 7 point mutations into Ulk4 full length cDNA within 
the targeting locus without alteration of the amino acid sequence. We chose shRNA268 because of its potent

knockdown ability which leads to the overt phenotypes in vivo (Fig. 4B–F). To determine the resistant capacity of 
Ulk4R cDNA against shRNA268, we transfected both of these two constructs into HEK293 cells and then deter-
mined the Ulk4 expression by western blotting. Our results showed that the reduced expression of Ulk4 caused 
by shRNA268 was recovered successfully by Ulk4R cDNA (Fig. 7A).
To determine the effects of Ulk4R cDNA in vivo, panels of expression plasmids including control, shRNA268 
or shRNA268+ 
Ulk4R cDNA were delivered into lateral ventricles of E15.5 mouse brains and in vivo gene transfer 
performed and sections of P7 brains were examined to trace the positioning of these transfected cells. Compared 
with the control group (Fig. 7B), almost all GFP-tracked cells in the Ulk4R cDNA group were located in layers 
II–III (Fig. 7D). This observation was confirmed further by statistical analysis of the percentage of cell numbers in 
individual sublayers (Fig. 8E; n = 3 for each group, * 
* 
p < 0.01). These results suggest that this construct success-
fully resumed normal migration and settlement of layers II–III neurons which had been perturbed by shRNA268 
(Fig. 7C). We further reconstructed and compared the arborisation pattern of apical dendrites between the two 
groups in subsequent electroporation using lower concentration of GFP. Sholl analysis showed that dendrite 
branching deficits mediated by shRNA268 have been rescued effectively by Ulk4R cDNA (Fig. 8A–D, forty-one 
cells were included from 6 control brains and forty-three cells were from 4 Ulk4R cDNA brains). Our results 
strongly indicate that the phenotypes caused by Ulk4 knockdown are specific and can be restored successfully 
upon Ulk4 overexpression.
Discussion
Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with significant genetic signatures. Although the precise 
aetiology is debatable, the genetic alterations are believed, alone or in combination, to perturb the process of 
normal brain development and maturation, which in part causes this condition. Considering its polygenic nature, 
identification and validation of novel risk factors will provide new insights into this disease. We were the first to 
identify ULK4 as a novel rare risk factor of schizophrenia12. Here, we provide the first body of evidence that Ulk4 
is involved closely in the regulation of corticogenesis and that disrupted Ulk4 expression leads to neurodevelop-
mental abnormalities which could perturb brain development and function and contribute to mental disorders 
with a significant neurodevelopmental component.
Corticogenesis is a precisely controlled process which is vulnerable to a variety of genetic and environmental 
insults. In our study, the strong expression of Ulk4 transcripts in neurogenic regions of embryonic mouse brains 
suggests a functional involvement in corticogenesis. Coincidentally, a recent in situ hybridization study has shown 
abundant Ulk4 transcripts in ventricular and subventricular zones in Xenopus laevis. Further immunohistochem-
ical staining also revealed localization of Ulk4 in neural stem cells, radial glia and cells with neural commitment28. 
This morphological evidence highlights important regulatory roles for Ulk4 during neurogenesis. Indeed, in our 
study, knockdown of Ulk4 in embryonic brains caused reduced proliferation of neural stem cells as well as aber-
rant radial migration and positioning of projecting neurons. These alterations could be restored however upon 
replenishment of the Ulk4 protein. Interestingly, de-regulated neurogenesis is shared by many other generalized 
candidates for schizophrenia such as Neuregulin (NRG1) and Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1). Aberrant 
NRG1-ErbB4 signalling not only alters the proliferation of neuronal progenitors in vitro29 and in vivo30, but also 
interferes with fundamental processes of neuronal development31, including the radial migration of glutamatergic 
neurons32 and the tangential migration of GABAergic neurons33. Disc1 not only modulates embryonic34 and adult 
neurogenesis35, but also governs the production and settlement of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons through 
radial36–38 and tangential migration39.
Dysfunction of proper GABAergic inhibition in the cerebral cortex underlies at least part of the pathophysio-
logical process of schizophrenia both in mice and humans6,40. Although we have no direct evidence to support the 
modulatory roles of Ulk4 in the origin and migration of GABAergic interneurons, we have observed strong in situ

signals of Ulk4 transcripts in medial and lateral ganglionic eminences of the telencephalon, which accommodates 
GABAergic interneuron precursors and facilitates tangential migration. Moreover, we also observed wide Ulk4 
expression in GAD67-postive neurons in both human and mouse brains12. Concordantly, Ulk4 heterozygous 
mice present reduced expression of GAD67 and components of GABAA receptor subunits (β 
1, ɛ 
, δ 
, ρ 
2) in amyg-
dala and display anxiety-like behaviour41. Interestingly, CTNNB1, an essential component in the WNT signalling 
pathway and a 3′ 
-flanking gene of ULK4, participates in hippocampal network regulation and contributes to the 
decreased GAD67 expression in both schizophrenia and bipolar patients42. Therefore, it is likely that Ulk4 also 
provides instructive cues to coordinate the migration and functional integrity of interneurons though the precise 
process needs further investigation.
Proper neurite arborisation is important not only in establishing appropriate synaptic contacts but also in 
mediating neuronal plasticity which underlies important aspects of behaviour. Impaired neuronal connectivity 
and synaptic plasticity have been considered as an endo-pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In the present study, we 
used two shRNAs (268 and 269) which recognize distinct DNA coding sequence and display different knockdown 
capacity (Fig. 2) and phenotypes. While shRNA268 significantly inhibits radial migration but moderately affects 
cell proliferation, shRNA269 strongly impedes cell division and only slightly affects radial migration (Figs 3 and 4). 
 
However, both of them robustly interfere with neurite growth and arborisation (Fig. 5). In both groups, the 
pyramidal neurons in layers II–III consistently displayed abnormal neurite branching including stalled apical 
dendrites and poorly developed dendritic tree. Similarly, defective neuritogenesis also was observed in SHSY-5Y 
cells with Ulk4 depletion12. Due to technical limitation, we could not perform the same analysis in adult mice as 
GFP may be degraded over a long period of time and a conditional knockout paradigm could be a better option. 
Nevertheless, imaging studies have shown a reduced brain volume and progressive grey matter loss in schizophre-
nia patients even before the onset of the disease, implicating a contribution of aberrant neurodevelopment43. This 
reduction is largely due to diminished neuropil and smaller neuronal sizes rather than decreased cell numbers6,44. 
Our results support the involvement of Ulk4 in neurodevelopment and synaptic connectivity which is compat-
ible with current neuro-imaging and post-mortem studies3,6,45–48. On the other hand, we have observed ULK4 
deletion in Caucasian autism populations12. Ou et al. reported that ULK4 genetic variants strongly associate with 
Han Chinese autism and affect ULK4 expression in the prefrontal cortex of post-mortem human brains49. In the 
BBGRE cohort, 7/5891 patients exhibit ULK4 deletion and 6 deletions are unique, intragenic and non-related. 
These patients manifest a range of developmental disorders including developmental delay, behavioural prob-
lems, severe learning difficulties and severe language delay50. We assume that ULK4 may be involved in these 
conditions through common pathological alteration such as deficits in dendrite formation and neural network 
described by us.
ULK4 belongs to the unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase family which participates in a conserved pathway 
involving both endocytosis and axon growth13–15. Due to insufficient studies, the precise function and relevant 
pathways of Ulk4 remain unclear though the other family members are all well-studied. Recent GWAS stud-
ies suggest that Ulk4 is a risk locus for multiple myeloma51 and inter individual diastolic blood pressure varia-
tion52. In mice, targeted deletion of Ulk4 leads to significantly shorter motile cilia on respiratory and ependymal

epithelia. These mice display a series of ciliopathy-related phenotypes including respiratory inflammation, serious 
congenital hydrocephalus and even otitis media19. During the revision of this manuscript, Liu et al. reported 
that Ulk4−/− mice present a thinner cortical layers II–III owing to a decreased proliferation of NSCs at E15.550. 
However, it is not ideal to investigate the proliferation of NSCs utilizing Ulk4−/− mice because the accumulated 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during hydrocephalus robustly disrupts the cell cycle23 and inhibits proliferation of 
NSCs21. CSF also contains many neurotrophic or growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein, fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF), insulin-like growth factor, sonic hedgehog, retinoic acid, brain derived neurotropic factor 
(BDNF) and WNT24. These circulating factors regulate the mitosis of NSCs closely and their levels are altered in 
both animal models and human hydrocephalus patients20,22,24. For example, bFGF is expressed in the ventricular 
epithelium and choroid plexus53,54. Immuno-depletion of CSF bFGF in embryonic brains reduces the prolif-
eration of neural progenitors55,56. Ventricle administration of bFGF induces hydrocephalic brain morphology 
and aberrant differentiation of neurons in the cerebral cortex54. BDNF promotes NSCs to exit the cell cycle, 
down-regulates the expression of PAX6, an essential transcription factor for generation of layer II–III neurons,

and determines neuronal laminar fate in the developing mouse cerebral cortex57. Interestingly, in rats with con-
genital hydrocephalus, the expression of BDNF is increased in ventricular zones where NSCs reside20. Therefore, 
utilizing Ulk4 KO mice for neurodevelopmental studies inevitably will introduce many new variances and ignor-
ing the influence of these variances may lead to biased judgement and conclusions.
One of the most striking findings in our study is the reduced acetylation of α 
-tubulin, which can be replicated 
consistently in SHSY-5Y cells12, primary cultured neurons and brain sections upon Ulk4 knockdown. Tubulin 
acetylation is an important post-translational modification which not only stabilizes microtubules but is required 
for polarity establishment and directional migration. In cultured neurons, tubulin acetylation is important for 
polarized protein trafficking and regulates cell shape and neurite outgrowth27,58. In mice, decreased acetylation 
of α 
-tubulin results in abnormal hippocampal development27, profound impairment of radial migration and 
the branching of projecting neurons in cortex25,26. Proper acetylation of α 
-tubulin has been reported in various 
neurological conditions. For example, α 
-tubulin acetylation is reduced in brains with Huntington’s disease, and 
enhancement of acetylation improves the recruitment of dynein and kinesin-1 to microtubules and increases the 
flux of vesicles and subsequent release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor59. Similarly, in Parkinson’s disease, 
increased tubulin acetylation alleviates α 
-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity60. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) 
functions in many cellular events by deacetylating non-histone proteins including α 
-tubulin and HDAC6 inhibi-
tion could generate antidepressant-like properties with improved brain bioavailability61. In line with this obser-
vation, HDAC6−/− mice exhibit less anxiety and antidepressant-like behaviour62. In addition, HDAC6 mutation 
could increase α 
-tubulin acetylation and rescue human tau-induced microtubule defects in Drosophila63. In 
our experiments, we observed reduced acetylation of α 
-tubulin and overt deficits in cell migration and neurite

arborisation. We assume that these phenotypes would be fundamental for Ulk4-relevant neurodevelopmental 
diseases and further studies including behavioural tests would be important.
On the other hand, acetylated α 
-tubulin is an important cytoskeleton component of the axoneme, the core 
structure of cilium. The cilium is an antenna-like small organelle which exists in most mammalian cell types 
and when defective, leads to a suite of inherited diseases known as ciliopathies. It is not clear whether Ulk4 null 
knockout mice have reduced acetylated α 
-tubulin, however, they do present shorter and disorganized motile cilia 
on respiratory epithelium and on ependymal cells lining the ventricles indicating that they are dysfunctional19. 
Although no imaging studies are available from patients with ULK4 mutation, imaging data has suggested 
increased global or regional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)45,46,64,65 and larger 3rd and lateral ventricles6 in schizophre-
nia patients. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate how defective acetylated α 
-tubulin caused by Ulk4 dis-
ruption impairs motile cilium elongation and the wave-like beating which propels the directional CSF flow. We 
assume that Ulk4-relevant diseases may be linked with ciliopathies, neurodevelopmental disorders and psychosis.
In summary, we have provided the first in vivo evidence that ULK4 is implicated in fundamental cellular and 
molecular processes during corticogenesis. Ulk4 disruption leads to multiple abnormalities common to multiple 
neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism.
Methods
Plasmids and DNA constructs. 
Three individual plasmids harbouring different mouse Ulk4 shRNAs 
 
were purchased from Sigma (TRCN0000328268: 5′ 
-CCGGCTGCGAAGATTATCGAGAATGCTCGAGCATTC 
TCGATAATCTTCGCAGTTTTTG-3′; TRCN0000328269: 5′ 
-CCGGGAAGCAGGACTGTCGTATATAC 
TCGAGTATATACGACAGTCCTGCTTCTTTTTG-3′; TRCN0000328270: 5′ -CCGGAGCTGA 
ATGAATCCATATTTCCTCGAGGAAATATGGATTCATTCAGCTTTTTTG-3′ 
). These plasmids con-
tained the backbone of TRC2-pLKO-puro vector with the insertion of the corresponding shRNA sequence. 
They were abbreviated as shRNA268, 269 and 270 respectively in the subsequent procedures. A control 
plasmid was also from Sigma which contains a non-specific sequence for any mammalian gene (SHC002; 
 
5′ 
-CCGGCAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAACTCGAGTTGGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGTTTTT-3′ 
). The 
knockdown efficiency of these three shRNAs was assessed by co-transfection with full-length Ulk4 cDNA 
(MR217918, Myc-DDK-tagged, Origene) and determined by western blotting. The shRNA268-resistant mouse 
Ulk4 cDNA (Ulk4R cDNA) was generated from Ulk4 cDNA by introducing seven nucleotide mutations in the 
shRNA268 target region without changing the coded amino acids. Its ability against shRNA268 was evaluated by 
co-transfection in HEK293 cells followed by western blotting.
In Utero Electroporation. 
Time-mated pregnant mice (E15.5) were anaesthetized and embryos were 
manipulated surgically as described previously66. Plasmids containing Ulk4 shRNAs 268 or 269 (0.5 μ 
g/each) 
were injected into the lateral ventricles of the embryonic brains through glass micropipettes. CAG-EGFP was also 
injected (1 μ 
g/μ 
L) simultaneously in order to trace the successfully transfected cells. To reverse the phenotypes 
caused by Ulk4 knockdown, Ulk4R cDNA was co-injected together with shRNA268. To label neurons relatively 
isolated from other transfected cells, the concentration of CAG-EGFP was reduced to 0.1 μ 
g/μ 
l. Five square elec-
tric pulses (30 V) were delivered through the uterus at 1s intervals with forceps-type electrodes while the uterus 
was kept wet with saline. The female mice were then divided into two groups. In group one, they were culled one 
day after electroporation and the embryonic brains were harvested (E16.5) one hour after a single pulse of BrdU 
injection (100 mg/kg). In group two, the pup brains were collected on postnatal day 7 (P7) for histochemical 
examination.
Cell culture, western blot and immunoprecipitation. 
HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). To determine the 
knockdown efficiency of Ulk4 shRNAs, cells at 80% confluence were transfected with plasmids containing either 
control (1 μ 
g) or Ulk4 shRNAs (268 or 269, 1 μ 
g/each) combined with full length mouse Ulk4 cDNA (1 μ 
g) using 
jetPRIME transfection reagent (Source Biosciences, UK). To test the function of Ulk4R cDNA, full length Ulk4 
cDNA was replaced by Ulk4R cDNA (1 μ 
g) and co-transfected with shRNA268 for 2 days. For western blotting, 
proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer containing complete protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). 
Equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted 
with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-c-Myc (1:2000, Sigma), rabbit 
anti-Flag (1:2000, Sigma), mouse anti-Flag (1:2000, Sigma), mouse anti-α 
 acetylated tubulin (1:50000, Sigma) 
and mouse anti-GAPDH (1:8000, Proteintech). After primary antibody incubation, the membranes were treated 
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit 
(Millipore).
Primary neuronal culture and plasmid transfection. 
Primary neuronal culture was conducted 
as described previously66. Briefly, round coverslips (VWR) were placed in 24-well plates and coated with 
poly-L-lysine (Sigma). The cortices of E15.5 wildtype mouse embryos were dissected, trypsinized, and dissociated 
mechanically into single cell suspension. Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105/ml and cultured in Neurobasal 
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) plus 2 mM glutamine (Sigma) at 37 °C with 5% 
CO2. Twelve hours after plating, tissue debris was removed and the medium was renewed. Neurons at day 7 of cul-
ture were transfected with control shRNA or Ulk4 shRNAs combined with GFP (0.5 μ 
g for each) using magnetic 
beads as per the manufacturer’s instruction (Neuromag, OZ Biosciences, UK). Neurons were fixed at 48 hours 
after transfection and studied using immunocytochemistry and microscopical examination. Transfection effi-
ciency was determined with the percentage of GFP-positive cells/field and compared between the control and 
shRNA268 groups by ImageJ. For western blotting, neurons were plated in 6-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine

and subject to transfection with either control shRNA or Ulk4 shRNA268 at day 7 of culture. Proteins were 
extracted after 2 days and subject to western blotting as described above.
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. 
Coronal brain sections were prepared from E16.5 
mouse brains (20 μ 
m thickness) and P7 brains (40 μ 
m thickness) within a cryostat (Leica 1850). These sections 
were then processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously66. The following primary antibodies were 
used: rabbit anti-GFP (1:800; Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFP (1:800, Invitrogen), rat anti-BrdU (1:500, Abcam), 
mouse anti-BrdU (1:200, BD), rabbit anti-Tbr1 (1:500, Abcam), mouse anti-Satb2 (1:500, Abcam), rat anti-Ctip2 
(1:500, Abcam) and rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signalling). Species-specific Alexa Fluor 488 
(1:500, Molecular Probe) or Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000, Molecular Probe) conjugated secondary antibodies were 
used to detect primary antibodies. Heat mediated antigen retrieval (citrate buffer, pH = 
 6.0) was used to reveal 
BrdU incorporation.
For in situ hybridization, mouse brains (E12.5, E15.5, E17.5, P7 and 4 month) were fixed and sectioned at 
a thickness of 20 μ 
m (for embryos) and 40 μ 
m (for postnatal brains). Sections were mounted on poly-L-lysine 
coated slides and dried for 2 hours at 55 °C. Riboprobe complementary to 719 bp ULK4 cDNA was transcribed 
and subject to DIG RNA-labelling (SP6/T7; Roche Diagnostics Ltd. UK). The hybridization was performed as 
described previously66 and the signals were visualized using 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Boehringer 
Mannheim), and 4-nitroblue tetrazolium salt (BioRad) as substrates for alkaline phosphatase. The sequences of 
the primers are: Forward, 5′ 
-AACAATCTGGTTGCCTACA-3′ 
; Reverse, 3′ 
-CACTTGAGACTGGTGAGAA-5′ 
.
Image acquisition and data analysis. 
All the immunostaining and in situ hybridization images were 
viewed with either a Nikon Eclipse E400 or Zeiss AX10 microscope and sequentially captured by Volocity (5.3.1) 
or Axiovision (4.8.1). ImageJ was used to define the threshold and to measure the density of fluorescent sig-
nals (40X magnification). To reconstruct the dendritic architecture of GFP-positive cells, confocal images were 
acquired on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope using established protocols67. Briefly, images 
were taken with 40x or 63x oil objectives as z series, and around 30–40 images (for 40x) and 40–50 images (for 
63x) were taken at 0.6 μ 
m intervals (scan averaged, x4; 512 × 512 pixel resolution) for image reconstruction. The 
acquisition parameters were kept constant for all scans in the same experiment. Two-dimensional projection 
reconstructions of z series of images were achieved by using Zeiss Zen software, and morphometric analysis and 
quantification were carried out using NIH ImageJ programme. Sholl analysis for dendritic complexity was carried 
out by analysing the number of intersections that crossed a series of concentric circles at 10 μ 
m intervals from the 
cell soma using ImageJ equipped with the Sholl Analysis Plugin.
Statistics. 
A univariate linear model and post-hoc analysis were run to analyse BrdU incorporation. To com-
pare neurite arborisation pattern and to measure the fluorescent intensity, repeated measurement analysis with 
post-hoc Tukey test were used to compare between whole groups, followed by multivariate analysis to compare 
the data of separate distant points among different groups. Data were presented as mean ± 
 S.E.M. P < 
 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Study approval. 
All the animal care and experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the ethical 
committees of the Universities of Aberdeen (GM-04-003), Scotland and Tongji (Tongji-med-2009-02), Shanghai. 
All the experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the care and use of laboratory 
animals set by both Universities.
