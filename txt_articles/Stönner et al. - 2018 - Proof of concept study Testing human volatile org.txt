Abstract
Humans emit numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through breath and skin. The
nature and rate of these emissions are affected by various factors including emotional state.
Previous measurements of VOCs and CO2 in a cinema have shown that certain chemicals
are reproducibly emitted by audiences reacting to events in a particular film. Using data from
films with various age classifications, we have studied the relationship between the emission
of multiple VOCs and CO2 and the age classifier (0, 6, 12, and 16) with a view to developing
a new chemically based and objective film classification method. We apply a random forest
model built with time independent features extracted from the time series of every measured
compound, and test predictive capability on subsets of all data. It was found that most com-
pounds were not able to predict all age classifiers reliably, likely reflecting the fact that cur-
rent classification is based on perceived sensibilities to many factors (e.g. incidences of
violence, sex, antisocial behaviour, drug use, and bad language) rather than the visceral bio-
logical responses expressed in the data. However, promising results were found for iso-
prene which reliably predicted 0, 6 and 12 age classifiers for a variety of film genres and
audience age groups. Therefore, isoprene emission per person might in future be a valuable
aid to national classification boards, or even offer an alternative, objective, metric for rating
films based on the reactions of large groups of people.
Introduction
With box office revenues worldwide estimated to be around 40 billion US dollars,[1] the global
film industry is an important element of many national economies. Once a film is recorded
and edited it is must be classified prior to distribution to the cinemas. Movie classification
serves to protect children from unsuitable media content and to inform consumers, particu-
larly parents, of the film´s subject material. This classification is made at the national level by
an independent regulator according to guidelines based on the legal framework of the

 individual country. The regulator assigns a rating to the film that reflects the public´s sensibil-
ity to the film´s content, ranging from unrestricted (suitable to all) up to adults only (typically
18 years old). The division of the classification system into age groups varies greatly from
country to country. For example, Germany uses 0, 6, 12, 16, 18,[2] while the United States has
G (general audiences), PG (parental guidance suggested), PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned),
R (restricted) and NC-17 (no one 17 and under admitted).[3] India the world´s most prolific
film maker, uses U (0 to 11), UA (to 17) and A for adult.[4] The classification process is com-
plicated by the numerous influencing factors that must be considered together before the age
classifier can be assigned, such as the degree of violence, sex, antisocial behaviour and bad lan-
guage.[5] Furthermore, public opinion on certain aspects of the classification guidelines may
change with time requiring the regulator to revise their guidelines regularly. Ultimately, the
classifying authority expresses a subjective assessment on behalf of the public in the form of an
age limit.[6] On some occasions this can be a contentious decision as a film maker seeking a
larger market for their film may consider their work suitable for a broader audience than the
classifying agency.
Clearly, it would be helpful to classification authorities if objective data based methods
could be used to support the decision. Recently it was shown that cinema audiences emit
chemical signals into the surrounding air in response to specific scenes in a film. Moreover,
the sequence of signals over time was reproducible over multiple screenings of the same film.
[7,8] The effect can be most easily understood in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes
up circa 4% of exhaled human breath. Cinemas are ventilated continuously with outside air
containing circa 0.0004% CO2 so that when an audience is present the CO2 level rises smoothly
until an equilibrium is reached. However, when audience pulse and breathing rates increase
momentarily in unison, in response to a particularly exciting scene, a peak in the CO2 is gener-
ated which can be detected in air vented from the cinema. Current air measurement technol-
ogy allows, in addition to CO2, several hundred volatile organic compounds to be measured at
high frequency (every 30 seconds). In the aforementioned study, it was found that certain
chemicals corresponded to specific scene types, with suspense and comedy scenes being best
characterized. The chemical response measured in the “crowd breath” represents the reaction
of a large group of people to the scenes shown.[7,8] This information could be potentially very
useful in film classification as the chemical information is a direct, non-invasive measure of
how a large group of people react to particular scenes and to the film as a whole. It is easy to
imagine that the variability in the CO2 trace, the number of peaks in the individual VOCs or
the absolute amounts of the chemicals emitted per person are all possible indicators of the
group response.
Recently, computerized systems evolved to support the decision making of the age rating of
a film by the committee. Most of these methods utilize the language (use of bad words) and the
image properties (colour variance, shot length) to classify the films [9,10] but do not take into
account the human reaction to the film.
In this study we systematically examine the feasibility of using CO2 and over 60 VOCs mea-
sured in air ventilating from a cinema to classify films. The assessment is based on 135 screen-
ings of 11 different films collected over 8 weeks from two separate cinemas involving more
than 13000 people. Our approach involves a random forest model built with time independent
features extracted from the time series of every measured compound for every film. These
features include for example peak height, peak width and the number of peaks in a film nor-
malized to its length.[11,12] Finally, a permutation test was performed to test the resulting per-
formance measures (area under ROC curve) of the original model versus the ones calculated
from randomized class labels.[13]

 Materials and methods
Cinema measurement
We are very grateful to the Cinestar company for permission to use their facilities. No specific
permission was required. Individual audience members were neither harmed or identifiable in
the gas mixture and therefore the measurements were not subject to ethical approval.
The measurements were conducted in the multiplex cinema Cinestar in Mainz, Germany
(located at 49˚ 59’ 37.511" N 8˚ 16’ 45.548" E) in two different screening rooms for approxi-
mately four weeks during the winter 2013/2014 and winter 2015/2016. Over the 8 weeks of
measurement, 11 different films were shown multiple times resulting in a total of 135 separate
screenings. Table 1 summarizes the films measured, categorized according to the German film
classification system age recommendations “FSK” (“Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Film-
wirtschaft” meaning voluntary self-regulation) along with the number of screenings. The aver-
age number of people present at each screening is given in the supplementary S1 Table. It can
be seen that each age recommendation class was attended by approximately the same amount
of people.
For this study, the German motion picture rating system was used dividing the films in 5
categories. Unrestricted films are classified as “FSK 0”, films released to 6-years-old and over
as “FSK 6”, films released to 12-years-old and over “FSK 12”, films released to 16-years-old
and over “FSK 16” and films allowed only to adults “FSK 18”. During the period of measure-
ment, no film with the age rating “FSK 18” was screened. Since children under 12 have a dis-
counted ticket price, the proportion of viewers at a particular film under 12 could be taken
from the ticket sales.
The two different screening rooms were approximately the same size with a seating capacity
of 237 and 227 viewers respectively. The size of the screening rooms was 6500 m3 and the
rooms were continuously flushed with 1300 m3/h fresh outside air. No internal influx of con-
sumed air from the cinema was mixed with the fresh outside air. The entire exhaust air of the
screening room was drawn through a 75x75 cm stainless steel ventilation shaft. The air from
the exhaust shaft was measured in a separate technical room with a PTR-TOF-MS and a CO2-
Analyzer.
Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer
The exhaust air of the cinema was measured with a PTR-TOF-MS 8000 (Ionicon Analytik
GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria). The ionization of each analyte occurs via hydroxonium ions
(H3O+) resulting in protonated positively charged ions. This transfer reaction proceeds only to
molecules with a higher proton affinity than water (691 kJ/mol). Thus the system is blind to
the main air components like nitrogen, oxygen and argon. The low energy involved in the pro-
tonation reaction results in small fragmentation of the analyte facilitating identification.
A detailed description of the set up and the calibration can be found elsewhere. [14]

 Data analysis
In total, 20% of the film screenings measured had to be discarded due to problems associated
ventilation system checks around midnight (only in winter 2013/2014) and high VOC emis-
sions from cleaning products in the morning masking some human emissions (only for pre-
midday screenings).
The data analysis was divided up into a pre-processing step and a model building step. The
latter includes the generation of instances and the partitioning into training and test sets.
Finally, the resulting performance measures were compared to the results obtained from a per-
mutation test.
Pre-processing.
The measured time series for the isoprene mixing ratio for one film
(“I´m off then”, “FSK 0”) is shown as the black curve on the left side of Fig 1. As the audience
enters the cinema, the mixing ratio of isoprene increases quickly at first and then steadily
during the film before decreasing sharply at the end when the audience leaves the screening
room. In the case of isoprene, the peak that can be seen at the end of each movie is caused by
enhanced release of isoprene due to muscle contractions associated with standing up and walk-
ing out.[15,16] This peak was discarded for the analysis by removing the last 5 minutes of each
film in the data pre-processing step.
Zooming in, several peaks and valleys can be seen which re-occur at the same time in every
screening of the same film.[7] The maximum mixing ratio of the VOCs measured for each
film, positively correlates with the number of viewers attending the screening room. Therefore,
the time series of the individual films were normalized to the number of viewers which is
known from the ticket sales. The temporal behaviour of isoprene with an initial sharp increase,
followed by a smooth steady enhancement and final rapid decrease were similarly observed for
many other breath-borne compounds such as CO2 and acetone. The increase in the mixing
ratio (red curve in Fig 1) can be calculated using a box model assuming a constant emission
rate during the film. Within the model the mixing ratio is dependent only on the inflowing
and outflowing air and the emission rate of the VOCs from the audience. A detailed descrip-
tion of the model can be found in the supplement. The modelled behaviour of the mixing ratio
assuming a fixed emission rate (red curve in Fig 1) was subtracted from the measured mixing
ratio (black curve on the left side in Fig 1). The resulting trace without the increasing trend
was termed as the “residual time series” and can be seen on the right hand side in Fig 1.
The corrected time series was used to extract distinctive features comprising standard devi-
ation, skewness and kurtosis of the time series as well as several features describing the occur-
rence of peaks in the time series. Additionally, the mean of the positive and negative values
was included into the feature set to obtain an overall measure of change within the time series.
The residual time series allows the comparison between the peak heights of different films. In
one case all peaks were counted (single time step increase and decrease). In a second case,
peaks were only counted exhibiting a sequence of a minimum of 3 consecutive increasing and
decreasing steps. In the case of the peak height and peak width only the 5 highest and widest
peaks with a minimum of 3 increasing and decreasing steps were taken and included in the
feature set. In total 18 features were included in the feature set. The complete list of extracted
features can be seen in Table 2. These features were extracted for each film and for each mea-
sured VOC. A separate model was built for each of the measured 66 VOCs. The statistics of
the data set are shown in the supplementary S2 and S3 Tables.
Model building.
Instances were created for each molecule in the same manner using the
four age ratings “FSK 0”, FSK 6”, “FSK 12” and “FSK 16”. For the modelling process, the films
were divided up into a training and a test set. For each age recommendation class, one film
was chosen to be in the test set and the remaining films were put in the training set. In order to

 receive statistically meaningful results, the test set contained only films with 8 or more
recorded screenings. An exception involves the age recommendation “FSK 16” because two
films were measured only once (“The Counselor” and “Machete Kills”). These two films were
always put into the same set (training or test set) and were evaluated together. Consequently,
the other set includes “Paranormal Activity”. This set up results in 24 combinations of different
training and test sets (two possible films in “FSK 0”, “FSK 12”and “FSK 16” and three possible
films in “FSK 6”).
For each training set a random forest model was constructed.[17] The random forest classi-
fier was run with the default values for its parameter specifically the number of trees to grow
was set to 500 and the number of variables randomly sampled at each split was set to 6 (num-
ber of variables divided by 3). This model was used to predict the age rating of the correspond-
ing and unseen test set. The classifier performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC)[18,19] and Precision-Recall curves (PRC).[20] The ROC curve with its
corresponding area under curve (AUC) value is frequently used in the machine learning com-
munity. However, this performance measure lacks interpretability when it comes to imbal-
anced data sets.[21] In our study the number of negative examples exceed the number of
positive examples. For instance, a large number of false positives weakly enhances the false
positive rate used in ROC. On the other hand, the precision value is affected by a larger
amount because this value compares the false positives and the true positives. Between the
ROC and PRC curves a one-to-one relationship exists, meaning that each point in one curve
uniquely corresponds to one point in the other curve and vice versa.[22]
Permutation test.
A permutation test was performed to check for spurious results. For
this test a random age rating was assigned to each film in the training set and the initial class
distribution was retained. The test set kept the original age ratings. From the resulting model,
the area under curve from the ROC and the PRC were calculated. For each test set composition
the training set labels where shuffled 50 times and the resulting 50 performance measures
where compared to the corresponding original performance measures. Therefore, the cases in
which the performance measure of the permutation test exceeds the one of the original test set
composition were counted and divided by the total amount of permutations. The calculation
of the p-value was according to Ojala et al.[13]
Generally, a Holm-Bonferroni correction should be applied to the p-values to counteract
the problem of multiple comparisons as in our case summarizing the models from all mea-
sured VOCs. In this study we did not apply this correction since we only searched for indica-
tions pointing to VOCs which might be useful for further analysis. Therefore, we used the
uncorrected p-values.

 Results
The resulting AUC values are summarized in Table 3. The complete results with the corre-
sponding standard deviation of the AUC values and p-values are given in the supplement (sup-
plement S4–S6 Tables).
It can be seen that most of the VOCs show AUC values below or around 0.5 indicating a
performance similar to a random classifier. The AUC value for CO2 shows the highest value in
the age class “FSK 12”, whereas almost no significance is seen in the other categories. Isoprene
shows AUC values above 0.7 for the age classes “FSK 0”, “FSK 6” and “FSK 12”. The AUC
value for the age class “FSK 16” lies below 0.5. However, this class is hardly interpretable since
we measured only 6 films for this class. This may pose a problem to the reliable prediction of
this class. Therefore, in the following discussion the age recommendation class “FSK 16” was
omitted.
In general, it can be seen that based on the AUC values several different compounds are
able to distinguish between one or more age classes. Isoprene, which is one of the main VOCs
on breath, seems to be a potentially useful compound for the differentiation of the age classes
FSK 0, 6 and 12. Other compounds being able to predict only one age recommendation class
are for example CO2, formaldehyde and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane. Additionally, a filter
for low attendance films was imposed and films with less than 10 (in total 5 films were
excluded) and 20 (in total 8 films were excluded) people were removed from the data set. The
resulting AUC values show that this removal does not affect the prediction significantly.
Fig 2 shows the average behaviour of the AUC values derived from the ROC curves and
PRC for the age classes from 0 to 16 for isoprene. In general, 24 models were built for each
measured VOC corresponding to the 24 different test and training set combinations. The plots
in Fig 2 show the average value of the performance measures calculated from the 24 different
test and training set combinations of isoprene. In case of the age class “FSK 0” all AUC values
lie above 0.5 indicating a non-random classifier. For the age recommendations “FSK 6” and
“FSK 12” some of the AUC values lie around the value of 0.5 (median AUC value ~0.70) indi-
cating that some models trained and tested on particular sets cannot be predicted with a higher

 chance than a random classifier. The PRC shows the average curve over all models. The PRC
curve shows a similar behaviour as the AUC values describing the age class “FSK 0” as the best
predicted class followed by the age classes “FSK 6” and “FSK 12”. However, the age classes
“FSK 6” and “FSK 12” exhibit higher average precision values of ~0.6 for lower recall values up
to 0.2. The p-values from the permutation test for isoprene for the “FSK 0”, “FSK 6” and “FSK
12” are 0.01, 0.05 and 0.16 respectively. Consequently, for a significance level of α = 0.05 the
null hypothesis for “FSK 6” and “FSK 12” cannot be rejected. Examining the variable impor-
tance for all 24 random forest models built for isoprene no specific feature was found to distin-
guish oneself from the others.
Different genre labels
In this section we examine the differences in classifier performance between films of the same
age class but with different genre label. The genre labels for the films were taken from the
International Movie Database (IMDb).[23] For this purpose, the films of the age class “FSK 6”
were selected due to their similar frequency in the number of screenings (10 films of “Buddy”,
12 films of “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” and 13 films of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”).
Here the film “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” was labelled as “action” whereas “Buddy” and
“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” are “comedy” films.
Fig 3 shows the distribution of AUC values and PRC depending on the film in the test set.
On the right side the results are shown for the age recommendation “FSK 0” and on the left
side the results for “FSK 6”. Note that one film was chosen in the test set putting the other two
films in the training set. It can be seen on the left side that the highest mean AUC value
(~0.77 ± 0.13) is obtained placing the film “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” in the test set. This
test and training set combinations also shows the highest standard deviation. Fig 3 compares
the mean PRC of the three films in the age class “FSK 6”. In general, all three PRC curves seem
to behave similarly despite using films with different genre labels. Evaluating the permutation
tests separately for the three different films results in p-values for the film “Buddy” to be 0.06,
“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” to be 0.04 and “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” to be 0.11. In
this case the p-values were calculated by comparing the original test set combinations in which
the selected film appears with the corresponding randomized ones. These p-values are in
accordance with the boxplot in Fig 3 showing the film “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” with the

and the whiskers define 1.5 times the IQR or the minimum and maximum if no points exceed the 1.5 time IQR.

 highest standard variation. Thus, the chances are higher that the AUC values of the permuta-
tion test exceeds the values of the original one. It seems that some of the training and test set
combinations do not predict the “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” film well and that the genre
label has an effect on the prediction results. However, the film “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D”
could be predicted comparably well keeping in mind that there is no other action film in the
training set if “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” is in the test set.
Different age of the audience
The ticket sales information provided the proportion of viewers younger than 12, to viewers 12
years or older. In the case of the age rating class “FSK 0” the films shown were aimed at quite
varied audiences. The film “Help, I’ve shrunk my teacher” was classified as a “family” film by
IMDB and the proportion of viewers younger than 12 was 64%. In contrast, the film “I’m off
then” was attended only by viewers of 12 or older. The film “I’m off then” was more targeted
to adults as it deals with a man on a pilgrimage in Spain. Additionally, it is known that the
emission rate of CO2 is age dependent and rises until the age between 21 to <30 for male and
female persons and then decreases again.[24] It was shown in a previous publication concern-
ing the emission rates of VOCs that the emission rate for CO2 for the film “I’m off then” is
higher than for the film “Help, I’ve shrunk my teacher”.[14] This gives an important hint that
the average age of the audience is older for the film “I’m off then” than for the film “Help, I’ve
shrunk my teacher”. Remarkably, this age rating could be predicted with the highest AUC of
0.84 despite the difference in the average age of the viewers.
The difference in the AUC value between those two films with the averaged PRC curve for
each film can be seen in Fig 4 on the right side. Both PRC curves exhibit precision values higher
than that of a random classifier. It can be seen that the classifiers perform worse, if the training
set contains the film “I’m off then” and the test set “Help I’ve shrunk my teacher” than vice
versa. Nevertheless, the age difference of the audience between those two films does not seem
to worsen the classifier critically and the age class can be still predicted to a reasonable degree.
Discussion
In this study we have assessed whether the age classification of a film can be predicted based
on variations of airborne chemicals measured in a cinema. Previous publications[7,8] have
Fig 3. Performance measures for isoprene models involving only the “FSK 6” films. Area under ROC curve and Precision-Recall-curves divided up
into the different films in the age recommendation "FSK 6". The film “Walking with Dinosaurs 3D” was labelled as “action” whereas “Buddy” and”The
Secret Life of Walter Mitty” are comedy films.

 reported correspondence between audio-visual stimuli and the emission of VOC from human
beings. The aforementioned study reported that scenes labelled with “suspense” and “comedy”
caused the audience to change their emissions of chemicals significantly. Intuitively then, we
may think that these chemical changes may be related to the age classification given to the
film. For example, films with horrific scenes will induce rapid pulse and breathing rates and
hence higher and more variable levels of CO2. Indeed, CO2 values are effective in predicting
FSK 12 films, probably because the films in this category were action films. However, our
results show that most of the chemicals measured, including CO2, do not reliably predict all
the age classifications of the films (0, 6, 12). One reason for this may be that current age recom-
mendations for films are not solely linked to the intensity of induced fear, or the audience´s
innate visceral responses to film content. Rather it is subjectively based on a synthesis of multi-
ple aspects such as the degree and intensity of violence, sex, antisocial behaviour, drug taking
and bad language. Provided that the audience´s reaction to these aspects of the film are in
some way reflected within the large chemical dataset, an alternative and objective age classifi-
cation may still be possible. It is interesting to reflect that a chemical based approach as advo-
cated here, would be based on directly measured responses from large test audiences, whereas
the current scheme is based on a subjective appraisal of the film by relatively few people
entrusted to reflect the general public sentiment.
Of all species tested we found that isoprene performed best in predicting the different age
classifications. The highest AUC value was obtained for “FSK 0” (AUC value of 0.84 ± 0.07). In
this age recommendation class, the two films had a different proportion of younger viewers (in
“Help I’ve shrunk my teacher” 64% of the audience was younger than 12 and in “I’m off then”
only viewers of the age of 12 or older attended). It is known, that the children emit significantly
less isoprene than adults.[14,25] Nevertheless, it was found that the age structure of the audi-
ence does not critically worsen the predictive power of the classifier and that the features dis-
playing the structure of the films were able to distinguish this class from the rest. Lower
precision values were reported for the age recommendation classes “FSK 6” and “FSK 12”. For
these two classes the p-value of the permutation test lies between 0.05 for “FSK 6” and 0.16 for
“FSK 12”. The age recommendation “FSK 6” included three films with similar frequency of
two different genre labels (two comedy films and one action film). Again, this does not seem
to influence the classifier’s performance. In the case of “FSK 12”, the average AUC values were
0.63 ± 0.10 if the film “Star Wars” is included in the test set (and the films “The Hunger

into the different films in the age recommendation "FSK 0". The film “Help I’ve shrunk my teacher” was attended by a large proportion of viewers
younger than 12 (64%) whereas the film “I’m off then” was only seen by viewers of 12 or older.

 Games” and The Starving Games” in the training set), and 0.77 ± 0.05 if the film “The Hunger
Games” is included in the test set (the films “Star Wars” and The Starving Games” in the train-
ing set). The lower AUC (0.63) value and the higher corresponding p-value of the permutation
test (0.25 versus the p-value of 0.08 including “The Hunger Games” in the test set) is likely due
to the lower amount of training examples (12 screenings with “The Hunger Games” and the
“Starving Games” in the training set).
Isoprene is generated in the body during cholesterolgenesis[26] and stored in muscle tissue.
Muscle movement causes stored isoprene to enter the bloodstream and then vent the body via
the breath.[15,16] It is interesting that that this species, rather than CO2, can be used as a suc-
cessful delineator for film classification, at least for FSK 0,6, and 12. Generally, it could be seen
that isoprene was reproducibly emitted at higher rates at the same time point in the same film,
even with different audiences. The height of peaks depicted in Fig 5 show smallest values for
the age class “FSK 0”. This could be because of the lower concentration of isoprene in the
breath of children for the film “Help I’ve shrunk my teacher” or because of fewer suspense
scenes in both films. Suspense scenes generally lead to increased heart and breathing rates as
well as involuntary movement, all of which enhance the isoprene emission rate of the audience.
We may speculate that in future isoprene may be used to objectively classify films, using the
dataset shown here as the basis or conceivably, measurements from a test audience could be
used by the classification board to aid in decision making in borderline cases.
The presented findings imply that features within the isoprene trace correspond to the pat-
tern and the intensity of induced emotions in the film. This structure can be distinguished
from the other classes even when the audiences between the films in the same class consists of

 different age proportions (“FSK 0”) or the genre labels of the films are different (“FSK 6”). In
general, the isoprene trace properties should reflect the subjective assessment of the rating
agency (age classification). It would be interesting to see if isoprene acts as an indicator in
other domains with multiple underlying stimuli like psychological stress. The perception of
stress can also be caused by several environmental conditions and events.
In this study we used a random forest model built for each measured mass separately to pre-
dict the age recommendation of a film. Future work should involve combinations of different
masses. As shown in Table 3 masses like m65.0215 or CO2 show higher AUC values for the
specific age classes like “FSK 6” (AUC of 0.79 for m65.0215) and “FSK 12” (AUC of 0.75 for
CO2) than isoprene. These masses might respond better to specific scenes or capture similar
structures of films within the same age recommendation class. Thus, the combination of the
features of these masses might help to reflect the structure of the film and to improve the classi-
fier’s performance. This approach requires a larger number of measured films because as in
our case the classifier adopted the features of the few films in the training set very well (result-
ing in a perfect classification for the training set) so that the extrapolation to new films in the
test set resulted in comparably low performance values. The addition of new features from
other masses exacerbates this problem. Therefore, a new validation set should be used to
choose the best combinations of these masses and to test them on an unseen set of films.
Therefore, future datasets should include a larger number of films.
Conclusion
This study presents a framework to objectively gauge a film into an age classification system
based on VOCs and CO2 in cinema air. The evaluation of these compounds resulted in no sin-
gle human generated volatile compound being able to distinguish all four age classes (0, 6, 12,
16). Problems arise because of the small number of available films within each age class, espe-
cially for the age class “FSK 16”. Overall, the results of this first study are promising for iso-
prene. Perhaps in future metrics can be devised using combinations of isoprene and other
VOCs to designate movie classification. This could be useful for the film industry which edits
films to make them accessible for their desired target audience. It can be seen for the age rec-
ommendations “FSK 0” that the classification is based on the films in this class and not on the
age structure (different target audience in “FSK 0”), so the classifying ability is not based on
the lower isoprene emission from children. The concepts proposed here could be tested more
thoroughly if more films are sampled. In particular, a larger suite of films with rating “FSK 16”
and “FSK 18” would be interesting as they represent the extreme categories.
