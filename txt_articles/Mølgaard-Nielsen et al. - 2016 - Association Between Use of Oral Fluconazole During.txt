IMPORTANCE Vaginal candidiasis is common during pregnancy. Although intravaginal
formulations of topical azole antifungals are first-line treatment for pregnant women, oral
fluconazole is often used despite limited safety information.
OBJECTIVE To study the association between oral fluconazole exposure during pregnancy
and the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationwide register-based cohort study in Denmark,
1997-2013. From a cohort of 1 405 663 pregnancies, oral fluconazole–exposed pregnancies
were compared with up to 4 unexposed pregnancies matched on propensity score, maternal
age, calendar year, and gestational age (based on gestational age at first day of treatment
with eligible controls surviving through this date). To test for confounding by indication,
pregnancies exposed to intravaginal formulations of topical azoles were used as an additional
comparator group.
EXPOSURES Filled prescriptions for oral fluconazole were obtained from the National
Prescription Register.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth,
estimated using proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS Among 3315 women exposed to oral fluconazole from 7 through 22 weeks’
gestation, 147 experienced a spontaneous abortion, compared with 563 among 13 246
unexposed matched women. There was a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion
associated with fluconazole exposure (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.23-1.77). Among 5382 women
exposed to fluconazole from gestational week 7 to birth, 21 experienced a stillbirth, compared
with 77 among 21 506 unexposed matched women. There was no significant association
between fluconazole exposure and stillbirth (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.82-2.14]). Using topical
azole exposure as the comparison, 130 of 2823 women exposed to fluconazole vs 118 of 2823
exposed to topical azoles had a spontaneous abortion (HR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.26-2.07]); 20 of
4301 women exposed to fluconazole vs 22 of 4301 exposed to topical azoles had a stillbirth
(HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.64-2.16]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationwide cohort study in Denmark, use of oral
fluconazole in pregnancy was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of
spontaneous abortion compared with risk among unexposed women and women with
topical azole exposure in pregnancy. Until more data on the association are available, cautious
prescribing of fluconazole in pregnancy may be advisable. Although the risk of stillbirth was
not significantly increased, this outcome should be investigated further.

P
regnant women are at increased risk of vaginal candi-
diasis, due to the increased secretion of sex hormones.1
The prevalence of vaginal candidiasis among preg-
nant women is estimated to be 10% in the United States.2 Al-
though intravaginal formulations of topical azoles are first-
line treatment during pregnancy, oral fluconazole is used in
cases of recurrence, severe symptoms, or when topical treat-
ment has failed3 but also may be used as the first treatment
by personal preference.4
Concern regarding the safety of fluconazole use in
pregnancy has been raised after case reports have linked
long-term, high-dose fluconazole treatment in pregnant
women to a distinct pattern of craniofacial and skeletal
birth defects.5-8 Consequently, epidemiologic safety studies
of the lower doses of fluconazole commonly used in preg-
nancy have focused on possible teratogenic effects and
have not shown an association with birth defects overall
or most specific birth defects.9-14 Only 2 epidemiologic
studies have investigated spontaneous abortion and still-
birth, suggesting that fluconazole is not associated with an
increased risk; however, with a combined sample of 1512
fluconazole-exposed pregnancies, these studies may not
have had sufficient power to detect even a moderately
increased risk.11,13
In a nationwide register-based cohort study, we evalu-
ated the association between oral fluconazole exposure dur-
ing pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion and
stillbirth.
Methods
Study Design
The Medical Birth Register contains records of all Danish
births with gestational age recorded in days15 and primarily
based on ultrasonography.16 The National Patient Register
contains records of all outpatient and inpatient hospital
contacts in Denmark.17 In records with diagnoses of abortive
outcomes, gestational age is primarily recorded in days
(89.4% in our study cohort; those recorded in weeks were
converted into days by multiplying with 7) and based on
ultrasonography or the first day of last menstrual period
(eMethods in the Supplement). Based on the 2 registers, we
identified a cohort of all pregnancies ending with a single-
ton live birth, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and other
abortive outcomes (including ectopic pregnancy, hydatidi-
form mole, other abnormal products of gestation, or
induced abortion) in Denmark between January 1, 1997, and
December 31, 2013. Pregnancy onset was estimated by sub-
tracting gestational age from the date of birth or abortive
outcome. We excluded pregnancies with a missing or
implausible gestational age and pregnancies with multiple
records on overlapping dates. Using unique personal identi-
fiers, individual-level data on maternal exposures and
covariates were obtained from the National Prescription
Register,18 the National Patient Register,17 the Central
Person Register,19 and Statistics Denmark and linked to the
cohort (registers are described in eMethods in the Supple-
ment). Many very early pregnancy losses are not recognized
clinically, and we expected incomplete recording in the
National Patient Register. Hence, including pregnancies
with very early exposure to oral fluconazole in the study
cohort, which is constructed by identifying pregnancy out-
comes (in contrast to all initiated pregnancies), would have
introduced immortal time bias—an artificially low risk of
very early spontaneous abortions biasing the results down-
ward. Therefore, ascertainment of exposure and pregnancy
outcomes started in gestational week 7. Furthermore, we
excluded women who filled oral azole antifungal prescrip-
tions before pregnancy onset to account for delayed use and
women diagnosed with fungal infection during hospitaliza-
tion to account for unavailable data on inpatient antifungal
drug treatment (eMethods in the Supplement). The study
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency.
Informed consent is not required for register-based research
in Denmark.
Oral Fluconazole–Exposed Pregnancies
Information on prescriptions for oral fluconazole (a
prescription-only drug) was obtained from the National
Prescription Register. The specific time windows of expo-
sure and nonexposure in the analyses of spontaneous abor-
tion and stillbirth were gestational week 7 to 22 and
week 7 to birth, respectively (eFigure in the Supplement).
Exposed person-time was defined to start on the date
when the first prescription was filled; thereafter, women
were considered exposed throughout follow-up. In
the analysis of different doses of fluconazole, we calculated
the total milligram amounts in the latest filled prescrip-
tion. The predefined dose categories (150 to 300 mg and
350 to 5600 mg) were based on the standard treatment of
vaginal candidiasis, which is one or two 150-mg doses of
oral fluconazole, while higher doses are used for more com-
plicated fungal infections, including recurrent vaginal
candidiasis.20
Matched Control Pregnancies
To control for potential confounders, we matched each
fluconazole-exposed pregnancy to up to 4 unexposed con-
trol pregnancies based on propensity scores, maternal age
(5-year categories), calendar year, and gestational age
(based on gestational age at first day of treatment for each
exposed pregnancy; unexposed pregnancies eligible as
matches were those who had survived through to this date
of gestational age). The nearest neighbor matching algo-
rithm was used (caliper width 0.2 of the standard deviation
of the logit score).21,22 The propensity score was estimated
using logistic regression as the probability of fluconazole
treatment given all maternal baseline characteristics at
pregnancy onset and calculated for the specific exposure
time window for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Covariate balance in the matched
cohorts was assessed by checking standardized differences
between exposed and unexposed pregnancies. Any given
characteristic was considered well-balanced if the standard-
ized difference was less than 10%.

Pregnancy Outcomes
Cases of spontaneous abortion, defined as pregnancy loss
from 7 through 22 gestational weeks, were identified
through the National Patient Register and cases of stillbirth,
defined as pregnancy loss from 23 weeks, were identified
through the National Patient Register and the Medical Birth
Register. The definition of stillbirth in Denmark changed
during the study period; from April 2004, stillbirth was
defined as pregnancy loss after 22 completed weeks, while
prior to this the cutoff was after 28 completed weeks.23 In
our study, pregnancy losses from week 23 were considered
stillbirths (eMethods in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Proportional hazards regression with gestational age in days
as the underlying time-scale was used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals, comparing haz-
ard rates of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth in exposed
and matched control pregnancies. The final model included
the matched cohorts for analyses of spontaneous abortion
and stillbirth, respectively, with no additional adjustment.
In the analysis of spontaneous abortion, follow-up was from
the day of exposure or index date (from week 7 at the earli-
est) through gestational week 22. Censoring criteria were
other abortive outcomes in the follow-up period. In the

analysis of stillbirth, follow-up was from gestational week
23 or from the day of exposure or index date (if this
occurred after week 23) and censoring criteria were induced
abortion or livebirth in the follow-up period. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was assessed using a Wald test
for the interaction between treatment status and the time
scale; the assumption was fulfilled in all analyses. Analyses
were conducted on individual pregnancies, and a woman
could contribute with repeated pregnancies. We used the
generalized-estimating-equation method (with the mother’
s
identification number as a cluster) to take into account the
possibility of correlation between several pregnancies in the
same mother.
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) was used for all
analyses. Differences were considered statistically signifi-
cant when the 95% CIs did not overlap 1.0 and when P < .05
(2-sided test).
We conducted a number of preplanned sensitivity analy-
ses. To investigate the possibility of confounding by indica-
tion, each oral fluconazole–exposed pregnancy was matched
to 1 pregnancy exposed to topical azoles. Intravaginal formu-
lations of clotrimazole or miconazole are considered safe,
owing to minimal systemic absorption,24,25 and represent
first-line treatment of vaginal candidiasis during pregnancy.3
They can also be purchased over the counter in Denmark,
but only those filled as prescriptions are included in the
National Prescription Register. The matching was based on
propensity score and the gestational age at which the expo-
sure occurred. Similarly, each fluconazole-exposed preg-
nancy was matched to 1 pivmecillinam-exposed pregnancy
(a prescription-only penicillin used as first-line treatment of
urinary tract infection during pregnancy in Denmark26) to
control for unmeasured confounders related to infections
treated with systemic anti-infectives during pregnancy.
We also matched each fluconazole-exposed pregnancy to a
pregnancy exposed to fluconazole in the year before the
index pregnancy on propensity score, maternal age, calen-
dar year, and gestational age to address the influence of
time-independent characteristics of women using flucon-
azole. To control for time-independent factors, such as
hereditary predisposition and unmeasured risk factors
related to lifestyle, we analyzed the risk associated with flu-
conazole in a cohort of women who had at least 2 pregnan-
cies with different treatment status. The within-mother
analysis was adjusted for maternal age, parity, and calendar
year (eMethods in the Supplement).
Additionally, to examine potential mechanisms, we
assessed the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth
according to low (150-300 mg) vs high (350-5600 mg) flu-
conazole dose, within 2 weeks after exposure (which would
presumably be consistent with an acute adverse effect) vs
later, and restricted the exposure time window to week 7 to
10 weeks vs later. Follow-up started in week 7. The period of
maximal susceptibility to teratogenic agents is gestational
weeks 4 to 1027; an increased risk isolated to exposure in
this period may suggest potential for malformation-related
fetal death. The difference in the HRs in the sensitivity
analyses was assessed using a Wald test for the interaction
between treatment status and subcategory of exposure. We
assessed HRs according to the timing of spontaneous abor-
tion (gestational weeks 7 through 12, with exposure time-
window in the same period and weeks 13 through 22, with
exposure time window from week 7 to 22). In post hoc sen-
sitivity analyses, estimates of spontaneous abortion were
adjusted for filled prescriptions of different anti-infective
agents during pregnancy, antihypertensive drugs before
pregnancy onset, and hospital diagnosis of infections dur-
ing pregnancy (eMethods in the Supplement).
We also analyzed the association between oral itracon-
azole exposure and spontaneous abortion to investigate a
class effect (eMethods in the Supplement). Itraconazole is
an azole antifungal agent also used for recurrent vaginal
candidiasis but not recommended during pregnancy
because of higher treatment doses.
Results
A total of 1 405 663 pregnancies were included in the study
cohort (Figure 1). Compared with unexposed unmatched
pregnant women, fluconazole-exposed pregnant women
differed in a number of characteristics. However, these dif-
ferences were eliminated by the matching procedure, in
which controls were identified for all but 5 fluconazole-
exposed women (0.09%) (Table 1 and Table 2; eTable 2 in
the Supplement).
Spontaneous Abortion
One hundred forty-seven spontaneous abortions occurred
in the 3315 pregnancies exposed to fluconazole in weeks 7
through 22, and 563 spontaneous abortions occurred in the
13 246 unexposed matched control pregnancies. Flucon-
azole exposure, compared with nonexposure among
matched control pregnancies, was associated with a signifi-
cantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion (HR, 1.48;
95% CI, 1.23-1.77) (Table 3). A similar risk was observed
comparing with unexposed unmatched pregnancies (HR,
1.49; 95% CI, 1.27-1.75). The mean gestational age of sponta-
neous abortion was 77 days for for fluconazole-exposed
women and 76 days for unexposed matched control
women.
Stillbirth
Twenty-one stillbirths occurred in the 5382 pregnancies
exposed to fluconazole from week 7 to birth, and 77
stillbirths occurred in the 21 506 unexposed matched preg-
nancies. The HR for stillbirth in fluconazole-exposed preg-
nancies, compared with unexposed matched control preg-
nancies, was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.82-2.14) (Table 3). Compared
with unexposed unmatched pregnancies, the HR was 1.44
(95% CI, 0.94-2.21).
Sensitivity Analyses
For spontaneous abortion, the HRs associated with flucon-
azole doses of 150 mg to 300 mg and 350 mg to 5600 mg
were 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22-1.77) and 1.55 (95% CI, 0.94-2.58),

respectively (P = .84 for difference between HRs) (Table 3).
For stillbirth, the HRs associated with low and high dose
were 0.99 (95% CI, 0.56-1.74) and 4.10 (95% CI, 1.89-8.90),
respectively; the HRs were significantly different (P = .002).
Table 3 shows the other sensitivity analyses, including
the HRs within 2 weeks after exposure vs later, and expo-
sure in gestational week 7 to 10 vs later; none of the HRs
were significantly different. In the analysis of the timing of
the outcome, the HRs were 1.32 (95% CI, 1.06-1.65) for early
spontaneous abortion and 1.90 (95% CI, 1.39-2.60) for late
spontaneous abortion.
In the sensitivity analyses with different comparator
groups, oral fluconazole–exposed pregnancies were at sig-
nificantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion compared
with topical azole-exposed pregnancies (130/2823 vs
118/2823, respectively; HR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.26-2.07]) and
compared with pivmecillinam-exposed pregnancies
(140/3018 vs 143/3018, respectively; HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.14-
1.82]) (Figure 2). The HRs for spontaneous abortion were
attenuated and not significantly increased in the compari-
son of pregnancies exposed to fluconazole during preg-
nancy with pregnancies exposed to fluconazole in the year
before pregnancy onset (92/2338 vs 107/2338, respectively;

pregnancies; adjusted HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.94-1.92]). In post
hoc sensitivity analyses, additional adjustment for potential
confounders had no effect on the HRs for spontaneous abor-
tion (Table 3).
In itraconazole-exposed pregnancies, 7 of 131 women had
spontaneous abortions, vs 34 of 524 in the matched control
pregnancies (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.51-2.60]) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
In this nationwide cohort in Denmark, oral fluconazole use
in pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased
risk of spontaneous abortion. The risk of stillbirth was not
significantly increased, but this outcome was relatively rare
and the results were therefore imprecise.

Abortions have been observed in animals exposed to flu-
conazole, but at doses many times higher than those recom-
mended for humans; thus, this effect may be attributable to
toxic overdosing.28 Fluconazole works by inhibiting the fun-
gal CYP51 enzyme, essential for ergosterol synthesis in the cell
membrane.28 Fluconazole can (while much less potently) in-
terfere with human CYP450 enzymes, which are also ex-
pressed during in utero development, and a potential ad-
verse drug effect could operate through this mechanism of
action.29 Two previous epidemiologic studies have investi-
gated the prevalence of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth as-
sociated with fluconazole. One study found no significantly
increased risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio [OR], 1.21
[95% CI, 0.67-2.21]) or stillbirth (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.03-
3.90]) in 226 first-trimester exposed pregnancies.11 Another
study found no increased risk of stillbirth among 1286 first-
trimester exposed pregnancies (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.40-
3.50]); spontaneous abortion was not investigated.13 In com-
parison, our study included 5382 women exposed to
fluconazole during pregnancy, which adds substantially to the
existing safety data. Furthermore, our study design imple-
mented survival analyses that took gestational age into ac-
count, which is essential when investigating spontaneous
abortion.30
To address confounding by vaginal candidiasis in a sensi-
tivity analysis, we used an active comparator group of preg-
nancies exposed to intravaginal formulations of azole anti-
fungals used for the same indication. This analysis did not
support confounding by indication as an explanation for the
results observed in the main analysis of spontaneous abor-
tion. However, confounding by severity of vaginal candidia-
sis might be present, since pregnant women treated with oral
fluconazole may have more severe infection. It has been de-
scribed that candida can ascend from the vagina and cause in-
trauterine candidiasis, which may result in prematurity and
fetal loss.31-35 The incidence of diagnosed intrauterine can-
dida infection is unknown, but there are fewer than 100 cases
reported in the literature; this is therefore unlikely to explain
the association observed in our study. However, it remains a
possibility that severe vaginal candida infection alone could
result in prematurity or pregnancy loss, as has been proposed
forbacterialvaginosis.36Ontheotherhand,manypatientswith
vaginal candidiasis prefer the convenience of oral flucon-
azole with no local adverse effects,4 and the use of oral flu-
conazole vs topical azoles may therefore reflect not only se-
verity of infection but also personal preferences. Late
pregnancy losses have been associated with bacterial
vaginosis,37 intrauterine infections, or severe acute or chronic
maternalillness(hypertensionanddiabetes).38However,when
we adjusted our analyses for use of different anti-infective
agents, diagnosis of infections (in hospitals), or antihyperten-
sives, the estimates were similar to those in the main analysis
of spontaneous abortion. This suggests that co-occurrence
of discovered infections or treated hypertension among
fluconazole-exposedwomendoesnotexplaintheobservedin-
creased risk of spontaneous abortion.
In the analysis comparing fluconazole exposure during
pregnancywithpregnanciesexposedtofluconazoleintheyear
before pregnancy and in the within-mother analysis, the HRs
for spontaneous abortion were somewhat attenuated and,
while greater than 1.0, not statistically significant. These re-
sultscouldindicatethatresidualconfoundingfromeitherfam-
ily or lifestyle factors (such as smoking or alcohol consump-
tion) or hereditary predisposition may explain the increased
risk observed in the main analysis of spontaneous abortion.
However, both these analyses were based on a lower number
of exposed cases than the main analysis, so the results could
also reflect statistical imprecision.
In women using high doses of fluconazole (350-5600 mg),
we found no further increased risk of spontaneous abortion

(in fact, the association was not statistically significant) but a
significantly elevated risk of stillbirth. However, the high-
dose category was heterogeneous and the analyses were based
on few exposed cases (n = 15 spontaneous abortion and n = 7
stillbirth exposed to high doses) and hence should be inter-
preted with caution. Analyses of potential mechanisms did not
suggest that our results were explained by an acute toxic ef-
fect or implicate fatal teratogenesis. The small number of preg-
nancies exposed to itraconazole precludes comment on
whether the association may be related to a class effect.
Our study has a number of strengths. The registry-based
design allowed assembly of a nationwide cohort of all regis-
tered births and abortions for a 17-year period, with indepen-
dent ascertainment of exposure and outcome. We used filled
prescriptions for exposure ascertainment, and nondifferen-
tial nonadherence would bias our results toward no effect of
the drug. However, because fluconazole is primarily pre-
scribed as a single dose of 150 mg or 2 doses of 150-mg therapy,
we would expect a high degree of medication adherence com-
pared with long-term therapy. Validation studies have re-
ported a near-complete (>99.5%) recording of births in the
Medical Birth Registry23 and a 99% positive predictive value
for diagnoses of spontaneous abortions recorded in the Na-
tional Patient Register.39
However, the study also has limitations. The National Pa-
tient Register, like any other large database of hospital care, is
unlikely to capture very early spontaneous abortions, many
of which are not recognized clinically.40 To minimize any in-
fluence of this fact on the investigated association, we used a
study design in which ascertainment of exposure and out-
comes started in gestational week 7; hence, our results are not
generalizable to fluconazole exposure or spontaneous abor-
tion outcomes occurring in weeks 0 through 6. Given that
Denmark has free and universal health care, we expect that al-
most all spontaneous abortions occurring after gestational
week 7 are managed by hospital specialists. However, in the
case of unrecognized early pregnancy, spontaneous abortion
may be mistaken for a late menstrual period. If pregnancies
were on average recognized earlier in fluconazole-exposed
women than in unexposed women, then bias toward in-
creased risk would be introduced, given the relatively higher
risk of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy. Likewise in
cases of recognized pregnancy, if fluconazole-exposed women
experiencing spontaneous abortion more often sought medi-
cal attention than unexposed women, then spontaneous abor-
tionwouldbemorelikelytobediagnosedamongthesewomen,
which would again bias the results toward an increased risk
with fluconazole exposure. However, we believe that differ-
ential misclassification of outcome in fluconazole-exposed
women vs unexposed women is unlikely, especially given that
our analyses using active drug users as comparators (topical
azole and pivmecillinam) were consistent with the main analy-
sis of spontaneous abortion.
Conclusions
In this nationwide cohort study in Denmark, use of oral flu-
conazole in pregnancy was associated with a statistically sig-
nificantincreasedriskofspontaneousabortioncomparedwith
risk among unexposed women and women with topical azole
exposure in pregnancy. Until more data on the association are
available, cautious prescribing of oral fluconazole in preg-
nancy may be advisable. Although the risk of stillbirth was not
significantly increased, this outcome should be investigated
further.
