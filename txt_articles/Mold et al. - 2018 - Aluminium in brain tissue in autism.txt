Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown aetiology. It is suggested to involve
both genetic susceptibility and environmental factors including in the latter environmental toxins. Human ex-
posure to the environmental toxin aluminium has been linked, if tentatively, to autism spectrum disorder. Herein
we have used transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry to measure, for the first time,
the aluminium content of brain tissue from donors with a diagnosis of autism. We have also used an aluminium-
selective fluor to identify aluminium in brain tissue using fluorescence microscopy. The aluminium content of
brain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5
individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) μg/g dry wt. for the occipital,
frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human
brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe
of a 15 year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) μg/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used
to identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it
appeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the
meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with non-
neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the
brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder.
1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental
conditions of unknown cause. It is highly likely that both genetic [1]
and environmental [2] factors are associated with the onset and pro-
gress of ASD while the mechanisms underlying its aetiology are ex-
pected to be multifactorial [3–6]. Human exposure to aluminium has
been implicated in ASD with conclusions being equivocal [7–10]. To-
date the majority of studies have used hair as their indicator of human
exposure to aluminium while aluminium in blood and urine have also
been used to a much more limited extent. Paediatric vaccines that in-
clude an aluminium adjuvant are an indirect measure of infant ex-
posure to aluminium and their burgeoning use has been directly cor-
related with increasing prevalence of ASD [11]. Animal models of ASD
continue to support a connection with aluminium and to aluminium
adjuvants used in human vaccinations in particular [12]. Hitherto there
are no previous reports of aluminium in brain tissue from donors who
died with a diagnosis of ASD. We have measured aluminium in brain
tissue in autism and identified the location of aluminium in these tis-
sues.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Measurement of aluminium in brain tissues
Ethical approval was obtained along with tissues from the Oxford
Brain Bank (15/SC/0639). Samples of cortex of approximately 1 g
frozen weight from temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital lobes and
hippocampus (0.3 g only) were obtained from 5 individuals with ADI-R-
confirmed (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised) ASD, 4 males and 1
female, aged 15–50 years old (Table 1).
The aluminium content of these tissues was measured by an estab-
lished and fully validated method [13] that herein is described only
briefly. Thawed tissues were cut using a stainless steel blade to give
individual samples of ca 0.3 g (3 sample replicates for each lobe except
for hippocampus where the tissue was used as supplied) wet weight and
dried to a constant weight at 37 °C. Dried and weighed tissues were
digested in a microwave (MARS Xpress CEM Microwave Technology
Ltd.) in a mixture of 1 mL 15.8 M HNO3 (Fisher Analytical Grade) and
1 mL 30% w/v H2O2 (BDH Aristar). Digests were clear with no fatty
residues and, upon cooling, were made up to 5 mL volume using

 ultrapure water (cond. < 0.067 μS/cm). Total aluminium was mea-
sured in each sample by transversely heated graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectrometry (TH GFAAS) using matrix-matched standards
and an established analytical programme alongside previously vali-
dated quality assurance data [13].
2.2. Fluorescence microscopy
All chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich (UK) unless otherwise
stated. Where available frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal and hip-
pocampal tissue from 10 donors (3 females and 7 males) with a diag-
nosis of ASD was supplied by the Oxford Brain Bank as three 5 μm thick
serial paraffin-embedded brain tissue sections per lobe for each donor
(Table S1). Tissue sections mounted on glass slides were placed in a
slide rack and de-waxed and rehydrated via transfer through 250 mL of
the following reagents: 3 min in Histo-Clear (National Diagnostics, US),
1 min in fresh Histo-Clear, 2 min in 100% v/v ethanol (HPLC grade) and
1 min in 95, 70, 50 & 30% v/v ethanol followed by rehydration in ul-
trapure water (cond. < 0.067 μS/cm) for 35 s. Slides were agitated
every 20 s in each solvent and blotted on tissue paper between transfers
to minimise solvent carry-over. Rehydrated brain tissue sections were
carefully outlined with a PAP pen for staining, in order to form a hy-
drophobic barrier around the periphery of tissue sections. In between
staining, tissue sections were kept hydrated with ultrapure water and
stored in moisture chambers, to prevent sections from drying out.
Staining was staggered to allow for accurate incubation times of brain
tissue sections. We have developed and optimised the fluor lumogallion
as a selective stain for aluminium in cells [14] and human tissues [15].
Lumogallion (4-chloro-3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenylazo)-2-hydroxybenzene-
1-sulphonic acid, TCI Europe N.V. Belgium) was prepared at ca 1 mM
via dilution in a 50 mM PIPES (1,4-Piperazinediethanesulphonic acid)
buffer, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Lumogallion staining was per-
formed via the addition of 200 μL of the staining solution to rehydrated
brain tissue sections that were subsequently incubated at ambient
temperature away from light for 45 min. Sections for autofluorescence
analyses were incubated for 45 min in 200 μL 50 mM PIPES buffer only,
pH 7.4. Following staining, glass slides containing tissue sections were
washed six times with 200 μL aliquots of 50 mM PIPES buffer, pH 7.4,
prior to rinsing for 30 s in ultrapure water. Serial sections numbered 1
and 2 for each lobe were incubated in 50 mM PIPES buffer, pH 7.4 or
stained with 1 mM lumogallion in the same buffer, respectively, to
ensure consistency across donor tissues. All tissue sections were sub-
sequently mounted under glass coverslips using the aqueous mounting
medium, Fluoromount™. Slides were stored horizontally for 24 h at 4 °C
away from light, prior to analysis via fluorescence microscopy.
Stained and mounted human brain tissue sections were analysed via

 the use of an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope, equipped with a
vertical illuminator and BX-FLA reflected light fluorescence attachment
(mercury source). Micrographs were obtained at X 400 magnification
by use of a X 40 Plan-Fluorite objective (Olympus, UK). Lumogallion-
reactive aluminium and related autofluorescence micrographs were
obtained via use of a U-MNIB3 fluorescence filter cube (excitation:
470–495 nm, dichromatic mirror: 505 nm, longpass emission: 510 nm,
Olympus, UK). Light exposure and transmission values were fixed
across respective staining treatment conditions and images were ob-
tained using the CellD software suite (Olympus, Soft Imaging Solutions,
SiS, GmbH). Lumogallion-reactive regions identified through sequential
screening of stained human brain tissue sections were additionally
imaged on autofluorescence serial sections, to assess the contribution of
the fluorophore. The subsequent merging of fluorescence and bright-
field channels was achieved using Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc. US).
When determining intracellular staining the type of cells stained were
estimated by their size and shape in the context of the brain area
sampled and their surrounding cellular environment.
3. Results
3.1. Aluminium content of brain tissues
The aluminium content of all tissues ranged from 0.01 (the limit of
quantitation) to 22.11 μg/g dry wt. (Table 1). The aluminium content
for whole brains (n = 4 or 5 depending upon the availability of hip-
pocampus tissue) ranged from 1.20 (1.06) μg/g dry wt. for the 44 year
old female donor (A1) to 4.77 (4.79) μg/g dry wt. for a 33 year old male
donor (A5). Previous measurements of brain aluminium, including our
60 brain study [13], have allowed us to define loose categories of brain
aluminium content beginning with ≤1.00 μg/g dry wt. as pathologi-
cally benign (as opposed to ‘normal’). Approximately 40% of tissues
(24/59) had an aluminium content considered as pathologically-con-
cerning (≥2.00 μg/g dry wt.) while approximately 67% of these tissues
had an aluminium content considered as pathologically-significant
(≥3.00 μg/g dry wt.). The brains of all 5 individuals had at least one
tissue with a pathologically-significant content of aluminium. The
brains of 4 individuals had at least one tissue with an aluminium con-
tent ≥5.00 μg/g dry wt. while 3 of these had at least one tissue with an
aluminium content ≥10.00 μg/g dry wt. (Table 1). The mean (SD)
aluminium content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were
3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) μg/g dry wt. for the
occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. There were
no statistically significant differences in aluminium content between
any of the 4 lobes.
3.2. Aluminium fluorescence in brain tissues
We examined serial brain sections from 10 individuals (3 females
and 7 males) who died with a diagnosis of ASD and recorded the pre-
sence of aluminium in these tissues (Table S1). Excitation of the com-
plex of aluminium and lumogallion emits characteristic orange fluor-
escence that appears increasingly bright yellow at higher fluorescence
intensities. Aluminium, identified as lumogallion-reactive deposits, was
recorded in at least one tissue in all 10 individuals. Autofluorescence of
immediately adjacent serial sections confirmed lumogallion fluores-
cence as indicative of aluminium. Deposits of aluminium were sig-
nificantly more prevalent in males (129 in 7 individuals) than females
(21 in 3 individuals). Aluminium was found in both white (62 deposits)
and grey (88 deposits) matter. In females the majority of aluminium
deposits were identified as extracellular (15/21) whereas in males the
opposite was the case with 80 out of 129 deposits being intracellular.
We were only supplied with 3 serial sections of each tissue and so we
were not able to do any staining for general morphology which meant
that it was not always possible to determine which subtype of cell was
showing aluminium fluorescence.
Aluminium-loaded mononuclear white blood cells, probably lym-
phocytes, were identified in the meninges and possibly in the process of

 entering brain tissue from the lymphatic system (Fig. 1). Aluminium
could be clearly seen inside cells as either discrete punctate deposits or
as bright yellow fluorescence. Aluminium was located in inflammatory
cells associated with the vasculature (Fig. 2). In one case what looks like
an aluminium-loaded lymphocyte or monocyte was noted within a
blood vessel lumen surrounded by red blood cells while another prob-
able lymphocyte showing intense yellow fluorescence was noted in the
adventitia (Fig. 2b). Glial cells including microglia-like cells that
showed positive aluminium fluorescence were often observed in brain
tissue in the vicinity of aluminium-stained extracellular deposits
(Figs. 3 and 4). Discrete deposits of aluminium approximately 1 μm in
diameter were clearly visible in both round and amoeboid glial cell
bodies (e.g. Fig. 3b). Intracellular aluminium was identified in likely
neurones and glia-like cells and often in the vicinity of or co-localised
with lipofuscin (Fig. 5). Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy
was successful in identifying aluminium in extracellular and in-
tracellular locations in neurones and non-neuronal cells and across all
brain tissues studied (Figs. 1–5). The method only identifies aluminium
as evidenced by large areas of brain tissue without any characteristic
aluminium-positive fluorescence (Fig. S1).
4. Discussion
The aluminium content of brain tissues from donors with a diag-
nosis of ASD was extremely high (Table 1). While there was significant
inter-tissue, inter-lobe and inter-subject variability the mean aluminium
content for each lobe across all 5 individuals was towards the higher
end of all previous (historical) measurements of brain aluminium
content, including iatrogenic disorders such as dialysis encephalopathy
[13,15,16–19]. All 4 male donors had significantly higher concentra-
tions of brain aluminium than the single female donor. We recorded
some of the highest values for brain aluminium content ever measured
in healthy or diseased tissues in these male ASD donors including values
of 17.10, 18.57 and 22.11 μg/g dry wt. (Table 1). What discriminates
these data from other analyses of brain aluminium in other diseases is
the age of the ASD donors. Why, for example would a 15 year old boy
have such a high content of aluminium in their brain tissues? There are
no comparative data in the scientific literature, the closest being simi-
larly high data for a 42 year old male with familial Alzheimer’s disease
(fAD) [19].
Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy has provided indica-
tions as to the location of aluminium in these ASD brain tissues
(Figs. 1–5). Aluminium was found in both white and grey matter and in
both extra- and intracellular locations. The latter were particularly pre-
eminent in these ASD tissues. Cells that morphologically appeared non-
neuronal and heavily loaded with aluminium were identified associated
with the meninges (Fig. 1), the vasculature (Fig. 2) and within grey and
white matter (Figs. 3–5). Some of these cells appeared to be glial
(probably astrocytic) whilst others had elongated nuclei giving the
appearance of microglia [5]. The latter were sometimes seen in the
environment of extracellular aluminium deposition. This implies that
aluminium somehow had crossed the blood-brain barrier and was taken
up by a native cell namely the microglial cell. Interestingly, the pre-
sence of occasional aluminium-laden inflammatory cells in the vascu-
lature and the leptomeninges opens the possibility of a separate mode
of entry of aluminium into the brain i.e. intracellularly. However, to
allow this second scenario to be of significance one would expect some
type of intracerebral insult to occur to allow egress of lymphocytes and
monocytes from the vasculature [20]. The identification herein of non-
neuronal cells including inflammatory cells, glial cells and microglia
loaded with aluminium is a standout observation for ASD. For example,
the majority of aluminium deposits identified in brain tissue in fAD
were extracellular and nearly always associated with grey matter [19].
Aluminium is cytotoxic [21] and its association herein with in-
flammatory cells in the vasculature, meninges and central nervous
system is unlikely to be benign. Microglia heavily loaded with
aluminium while potentially remaining viable, at least for some time,
will inevitably be compromised and dysfunctional microglia are
thought to be involved in the aetiology of ASD [22], for example in
disrupting synaptic pruning [23]. In addition the suggestion from the
data herein that aluminium entry into the brain via immune cells cir-
culating in the blood and lymph is expedited in ASD might begin to
explain the earlier posed question of why there was so much aluminium
in the brain of a 15 year old boy with an ASD.
A limitation of our study is the small number of cases that were
available to study and the limited availability of tissue. Regarding the
latter, having access to only 1 g of frozen tissue and just 3 serial sections
of fixed tissue per lobe would normally be perceived as a significant
limitation. Certainly if we had not identified any significant deposits of
aluminium in such a small (the average brain weighs between 1500 and
2000 g) sample of brain tissue then such a finding would be equivocal.
However, the fact that we found aluminium in every sample of brain
tissue, frozen or fixed, does suggest very strongly that individuals with a
diagnosis of ASD have extraordinarily high levels of aluminium in their
brain tissue and that this aluminium is pre-eminently associated with
non-neuronal cells including microglia and other inflammatory mono-
cytes.
5. Conclusions
We have made the first measurements of aluminium in brain tissue
in ASD and we have shown that the brain aluminium content is ex-
traordinarily high. We have identified aluminium in brain tissue as both
extracellular and intracellular with the latter involving both neurones
and non-neuronal cells. The presence of aluminium in inflammatory
cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter is a standout
observation and could implicate aluminium in the aetiology of ASD.
