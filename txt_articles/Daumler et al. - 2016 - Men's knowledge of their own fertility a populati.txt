STUDY QUESTION: How knowledgeable are men about the medical, environmental and psychological factors that are associated with
male infertility?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Men, across most demographic groups, have limited knowledge of the various factors that are associated with
male infertility.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Few surveys have focused on men’s knowledge of their own fertility. Studies of both men and women
have found that men are comparatively less knowledgeable about issues of fertility and reproductive health.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A regionally representative sample of Canadian men completed a web-based survey of male fertil-
ity and reproductive health, over a 2-month period in 2015.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Men, aged 18–50 years, were recruited for the study. There were 701 male
participants, with a mean age of 34.1 years. Each participant was asked to identify factors associated with male infertility; fertility knowledge
was assessed through two open-ended questions and a comprehensive list of risk factors and attendant health issues.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Men were only able to identify 51% of the risk factors and 45% of the health issues
associated with male infertility. Men were most aware of the modifiable risk factors for infertility (e.g. sexually transmitted infections, smoking
cigarettes), relative to their knowledge of fixed risk factors (e.g. delayed puberty, size of testicles) and the attendant health issues (e.g. cardio-
vascular disease, diabetes). The overall level of fertility knowledge did not vary by most demographic characteristics (e.g. age, education,
employment, income), though men from ethnic minority groups displayed moderately greater awareness. Additionally, younger men, those
with lower incomes and those who had no desire to have future biological children were more likely to identify themselves as unaware of
associations with infertility in the open-ended questions. Self-reported knowledge was significantly associated with higher overall knowledge
scores. More than half of the sample expressed an interest in obtaining information about male fertility and reproductive health, with the
majority of these men indicating that medical professionals and online sources were their preferred methods for receiving information.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Participants were self-selected and required to have Internet access in order to participate.
This may affect the generalizability of results.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Previous studies of fertility knowledge have either omitted men from their samples or
when men have been included, they were asked about general fertility or women’s fertility. This is the first large-scale survey that focuses
solely on men’s knowledge of male fertility. Insight into the areas where men’s knowledge may be lacking can inform strategies for

 disseminating fertility-related information and improving men’s fertility awareness. Public health initiatives should tailor campaigns to educate
men about the lesser known associations with male infertility, particularly those that are most prevalent and preventable through lifestyle
modification.

Introduction
Most men express a desire to become fathers at some point in their
lives (Lampic et al., 2006; Peterson et al., 2012). Insufficient knowl-
edge of factors associated with male infertility could lead some men
to engage, unknowingly, in activities that reduce their ability to have
biological children. Male infertility can lead to impaired quality of life
in many domains, including general and mental health, social function-
ing and role performance (Chachamovich et al., 2010). Male factors,
such as low sperm count and abnormal sperm morphology, are pri-
mary or contributing causes in almost half of the diagnosed cases of
infertility (Wiser et al., 2012). Certain medical conditions affect male
fertility rates; for example, male cancer survivors are half as likely to
produce biological children compared to healthy men (Green et al.,
2010). Male infertility is associated with poor general health status;
compared to fertile men, infertile men exhibit more health problems,
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, prostate cancer and testicu-
lar cancer (Walsh, 2011; Eisenberg et al., 2016). Therefore, it is import-
ant to assess awareness of the factors associated with reduced fertility
in order to promote the general and reproductive health of men.
Research that specifically measures men’s fertility knowledge is lim-
ited. Several studies of fertility knowledge in the general population
only sampled women (Bretherick et al., 2010; Daniluk et al., 2012;
Lundsberg et al., 2014), and studies on men have tended to use sam-
ples of secondary and postsecondary students, thereby limiting the
generalizability of the results (e.g. Trent et al., 2006; Bunting and
Boivin, 2008; Quach and Librach, 2008; Ekelin et al., 2012). Two stud-
ies measured men’s fertility knowledge using population-based sam-
ples (Bunting et al., 2013; Daniluk and Koert, 2013), though their
samples were restricted to coupled individuals and childless individuals,
respectively. Both surveys included a few questions about male fertility
(3/13 and 4/20 questions, respectively). This study builds upon previ-
ous research, by assessing a general population sample from a broad
age range of men, single and coupled, with and without biological chil-
dren and by focusing exclusively on male fertility.
To assess men’s fertility knowledge, we compiled a comprehensive
set of risk factors for male infertility, as well as health issues associated
with male factor infertility. We classified these items into three cat-
egories: (i) modifiable risk factors that are controllable by lifestyle
modification or medical management; (ii) fixed risk factors that are
congenital or outside the control of the individual and (iii) attendant
health issues, including illnesses and disorders that are linked with an
infertility diagnosis. Our survey also incorporated questions about
men’s information-seeking and the use of technology in an attempt to
inform novel modalities for reaching men and increasing fertility aware-
ness. The objective of this study was to investigate fertility knowledge
among Canadian men, examining: (i) what men know about their own
fertility, (ii) demographic factors associated with fertility knowledge
and (iii) where men receive their fertility information and whether they
are interested in learning more about this topic.
Material and Methods
Data
Between 20 April and 29 May 2015, a web-based survey was administered
to Canadian men who met the study’s inclusion criteria; respondents were
required to be male and between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Data were
gathered by a polling and market research company, which follows the eth-
ical principles outlined in the Code of Conduct for Market and Social
Research (MRIA, 2015). The questionnaire, which was available in both
French and English, was pilot-tested by the survey company to ensure clar-
ity and acceptability of the items. Participants were guaranteed anonymity,
and no identifying information was recorded or saved.
Participants
A total of 701 men, aged 18–50 years (mean, 34.1; SD, 9.1), completed
the survey. The sample’s margin of error was ±3.7%. Most men identified
as heterosexual (92.3%), Canadian born (73.2%), full-time employed
(59.6%) and either married or in a common-law relationship (49.0%).
Although 60.1% of men had no biological children, 46.8% expressed the
intention to have future biological children. Our survey is representative of
Canadian men with respect to regional distribution, immigrant status and
paternity, as the composition of our sample was statistically consistent
with Canadian men of equal age in the 2011 General Social Survey, a
nationally representative survey of 22,435 Canadians (Statistics Canada,
2012). Our sample had slightly higher levels of education and mean income
than the general population; most men possessed a postsecondary degree
(64.6%), and the mean income fell within the $40,000–$79,999 bracket. We
oversampled visible minorities (38.5%) to allow for statistical comparisons of
subpopulations. A complete demographic overview and comparison with
weighted survey data are presented in Supplementary data, Table S1.
Men’s fertility knowledge
The survey questions were designed by the research team, including two
male fertility specialists with >20 years of clinical practice. The full survey
questionnaire is available in Supplementary data, Table SII. The survey
began with questions about the respondent’s demographic characteristics
and fertility experiences. Then two open-ended questions asked men to
list up to 15 risk factors and health issues associated with male infertility;
respondents had the option to indicate that they were unaware of any
associations. Two close-ended questions provided a list of 34 possible risk
factors, 10 of which were decoy items and 11 possible health issues, 4 of
which were decoy items. Responses were coded as “1: correctly identi-
fied” if men correctly identified an item as “definitely a risk factor” or
“probably a risk factor.” Reponses were coded as “0: not correctly

 identified” if men identified an item as “definitely not a risk factor,” “prob-
ably not a risk factor,” or “unsure.” To assess men’s fertility knowledge,
we created two overall knowledge scores, ranging from 0 to 100, based
on the aggregate percentage of correctly identified risk factors and attend-
ant health issues. Inclusion of incorrectly identified decoy items did not
substantially alter the results; we therefore present the data on actual risk
factors and attendant health issues. To create the overall knowledge
scores,
we
summed
each
man’s
responses
(e.g.
1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + [..] + 0 + 1) and divided the sum by the total number of
items to create an aggregate percentage (e.g. 18 correctly identified/24
actual risk factors = 66.7%). We also created two dichotomous variables
for men’s unprompted awareness of risk factors and attendant health
issues. Each variable focuses on the respondent’s self-assessment in the
open-ended questions; they were coded as “1: aware” if men reported
being aware of associations and “0: unaware” if men reported being
unaware of any associations with male infertility.
Items were selected based on expert opinion and systematic reviews.
Risks factors included advanced age (Harris et al., 2011), complications
with male reproductive organs and genetic abnormalities (Morey et al.,
2004; Juul et al., 2014), exposure to heat sources and injurious daily activ-
ities (Shefi et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2014), exposure to pesticides and
environmental toxins (Oliva et al., 2001), substance use (Close et al., 1990;
De Souza and Hallak, 2011), urinary tract infections (Pellati et al., 2008)
and various medical treatments (Green et al., 2010; Abarikwu, 2013).
Attendant health issues included depression (Martins et al., 2016), prostate
cancer (Walsh, 2011) and testicular cancer (Peng et al., 2009). Several
items were classified in both categories. We asked respondents about
their
knowledge
of
the
clinical
sequelae
of
metabolic
syndrome
(Sermondade et al., 2013; Schisterman et al., 2014; Pergialiotis et al., 2016)
and sexually transmitted infections (Gimenes et al., 2014) in two different
survey questions, one relating to risk factors and the other to attendant
health issues, as various studies have posited that the associations may pre-
cede and/or follow an infertility diagnosis (Lunenfeld and Van Steirteghem,
2004; Michalakis et al., 2013; Eisenberg et al., 2016). Accordingly, it was
possible that men could be aware of an item being a risk factor for infertil-
ity but not an attendant health issue or the inverse scenario. This study,
however, was concerned only with whether men had any knowledge of
such associations rather than causal or directional claims.
Covariates
For our analyses, we included 10 demographic covariates (age, ethnicity,
immigration, education, employment, income, sexual orientation, marital
status, current biological children and intention to have biological children)
and six fertility covariates (self-reported knowledge, awareness that male
factors can contribute to infertility, fertility concerns, experience with fertil-
ity assessment, experience with fertility treatment, interest in learning
more about fertility).. For an overview of covariates and how each was
recoded, see Supplementary data, Table SIII.
Statistical analyses
For the univariate analysis, the overall knowledge scores were compared
for each covariate; a one-way ANOVA or two-sample t-test was used,
where appropriate. Pearson’s chi-squared tests were conducted to exam-
ine groups that were most interested in fertility-related information. We
corrected for multiple comparisons using the stepwise Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure that controls for the false discovery rate (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995). To assess which factors were independent predic-
tors of overall knowledge scores, we conducted a multivariate regression
analysis to test four models. The first two models assessed the odds of
correctly identifying risk factors: Model 1 with demographic variables only
and Model 2 with the addition of fertility covariates. Similarly, Models 3
and 4 assessed the likelihood of correctly identifying attendant health
issues. For the two open-ended questions, we ran multivariate logistic
regression analyses of the odds that men were aware of associations with
male infertility without prompting. All models were run with robust stand-
ard errors, and P-values were reported at 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 levels.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 13.0 statistical software
(StataCorp, USA).
Results
Men’s fertility experience
Most men (88.5%) considered themselves to be somewhat, very or
extremely knowledgeable about male reproduction and fertility.
Although 35.8% of men had at least some concerns about their fertil-
ity, only 13.6% had undergone fertility assessment, and 8.8% had
experienced fertility treatment. A small number of men (8.8%) were
unaware that male factors can contribute to a couple’s infertility
(Table I).
Sources of fertility knowledge
Most respondents (78.7%) indicated that they had obtained fertility
information from at least one source with the remaining 21.3% never
having acquired information about male fertility. As Table I indicates,
many men learned about fertility from online sources (55.8%), and
fewer men gained information from medical professionals (41.5%),
written materials (40.9%) and educational institutions (25.2%).
Gaining fertility information
Overall, 58.2% of men were interested in receiving information about
male reproduction and fertility. Among those who wished to learn
more, medical professionals (65.9%) and online sources (58.3%) were
their preferred methods for receiving information (Table I). When
asked about their use of technology, most men reported using a
smartphone (81.2%) or laptop computer (76.3%) to access online
information.
Knowledge of male infertility
Modifiable risk factors
Though most men (88.5%) considered themselves to be knowledge-
able, respondents could identify only half (53.1%) of the modifiable
risk factors for male infertility (Table II). While several factors were
widely known—including the long-term use of steroids, sexually trans-
mitted infections, pain or injury to the testicles or scrotum, stress and
smoking cigarettes—fewer men identified the fertility risk associated
with obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, alcohol consumption and fre-
quent bicycling.
Fixed risk factors
Men were comparatively less knowledgeable about fixed risk factors
for male infertility, identifying less than half (46.9%). More than 67% of
respondents correctly identified three such factors (cancer treatment,
genetic abnormality, age greater than 45 years), but <50% of respon-
dents were aware that factors, such as X-rays, hernia repair, delayed
puberty and size of testicles were associated with male infertility
(Table II).

 Attendant health issues
Men were aware of less than half (45.0%) of the health issues asso-
ciated with male infertility. As Table II indicates, testicular cancer,
depression and prostate cancer were most commonly known. Less
than 50% of men were able to correctly identify sexually transmitted
infections, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Open-ended responses
While 64.6% of respondents listed risk factors, only 26.1% listed health
issues associated with male infertility. The most common risk factors
that men reported included: smoking (16.5%), alcohol consumption
(16.4%), medical conditions (16.1%) and drug usage (13.6%). The
most frequently listed health issues included: cancer (8.0%), diabetes
(3.1%), erectile dysfunction (2.9%) and depression (2.6%).
Demographic variation in knowledge
Variation in overall knowledge
There was little demographic variation in the overall knowledge
scores. Of 10 demographic covariates in the univariate analysis, only 4
were associated with significant disparities in knowledge of attendant
health issues, and there were no significant differences regarding risk
factors. As Table III indicates, those with at least one biological child,
men from immigrant and minority groups and those without a partner
demonstrated greater levels of knowledge. Men’s fertility knowledge
did not vary by age, education, employment, income, sexual orienta-
tion and intention to have biological children. The overall knowledge
scores did, however, vary by men’s fertility characteristics. Self-
reported knowledge, awareness of male factors contributing to infertil-
ity, fertility concerns, experience with fertility treatment and interest in
learning more were associated with the knowledge of risk factors and/
or attendant health issues.
Variation in unprompted responses
Men who were younger than 30 years, those who earned <$80,000
and those who did not intend to have any future children were the
least likely to report any risk factors, controlling for the 10 demo-
graphic variables. Furthermore, men who did not wish to have bio-
logical children were less likely to report awareness of health issues
associated with male infertility (P < 0.05).
Predictors of fertility knowledge
As Table IV shows, only one demographic covariate from Models 1
and 3 remained significant when fertility covariates were introduced in
Models 2 and 4; men who identified as a visible minority had more
knowledge of attendant health issues, controlling for every variable.
After introducing fertility covariates into the analysis, only two vari-
ables consistently predicted higher levels of relative knowledge: self-
identified knowledge and interest in receiving fertility information (see
Models 2 and 4).
Men who were interested in fertility-related information
Four demographic groups exhibited greater interest in fertility infor-
mation: employed men (P < 0.05), immigrants (P < 0.01), men from
visible minority groups and those who intend to have biological chil-
dren (P < 0.001). Additionally, men who self-identified as knowl-
edgeable, those who were aware that male factors can contribute
to infertility (P < 0.05), those who have experienced fertility assess-
ment and treatment (P < 0.01) and men with fertility concerns
(P < 0.001) expressed a greater interest in receiving fertility-related
information.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first large-scale survey
that focuses solely on men’s knowledge of male fertility, inquiring
about risk factors and health issues related to male infertility. We
developed a three-category classification scheme to facilitate the dis-
cussion of areas where men’s knowledge is lacking. Our survey also
incorporated questions about men’s use of information and technol-
ogy in order to recommend strategies for disseminating fertility-
related resources to men. Our results demonstrate that (i) Canadian
men’s knowledge of their own fertility was limited, (ii) men’s level of
fertility knowledge was similar across most demographic groups and
(iii) the majority of men were interested in learning more about their
reproductive health.
Overall, men were able to correctly identify only half of the risk fac-
tors and health issues associated with male infertility. Men were rela-
tively familiar with the modifiable risk factors for infertility. They
tended to be aware of how substance use (e.g. smoking cigarettes)
and health-related risks (e.g. sexually transmitted infections) were
related to male infertility, though a substantial minority of men (20–
40%) remain unaware of these associations. Less than 50% of the
respondents were aware of the effects of common health problems,
such as high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes. Men were even less
knowledgeable about how daily activities and excessive heat sources,
such as the use of laptops and frequent hot tub use, can impact male
fertility. It is crucial that men be made aware of modifiable risk factors,
as a lack of awareness could lead to the missed opportunity to
actively improve one’s fertility health. Men were moderately aware of
certain fixed risk factors (e.g. cancer treatment) though there was a
considerable lack of knowledge regarding the male reproductive anat-
omy (e.g. size of testicles, delayed puberty) and its association with
male infertility. Poor knowledge of fixed risks could lead to delayed
recognition or diagnosis of infertility; greater awareness may promote
early assessment and treatment. We found that men were least
informed about the health issues associated with male infertility. In
particular, there was a clear lack of knowledge of the heightened risks
that infertile men face regarding the clinical sequelae of metabolic syn-
drome (e.g. cardiovascular disease). Only ~50% of men identified
depression as a consequence of infertility. These findings highlight the
importance of educating men about such health risks in order to
address modifiable risk factors through health promotion activities,
such as diet, exercise and stress reduction techniques. Greater fertil-
ity awareness has also been associated with the decision to seek out
fertility services (Bunting and Boivin, 2007). Therefore, the more
information that individuals have about fertility, the more likely they
are to exhibit positive health-seeking behaviours to improve their
own fertility.
Contrary to expectations, the overall level of fertility knowledge did
not vary by most demographic characteristics. Ethnicity was the only
demographic characteristic that remained significant after controlling for
fertility covariates. Men from cultural groups with strong pronatalist
views may have a particular interest in fertility information, due to the

 cultural importance of having biological children (Becker et al., 2006;
Whitten et al., 2013). Furthermore, men from ethnic minority groups
may have more experience with, and therefore knowledge of, certain
medical conditions that are associated with infertility, given the ethnic
disparities in obesity and its metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities
(Cossrow and Falkner, 2004). Three demographic groups were unable
to identify, without prompting, associations with male infertility; younger
men may not be thinking about having children, those with lower
incomes may have less exposure to fertility-related information and
those who do not want to have biological children would not be con-
cerned about their own fertility. Although Daniluk and Koert (2013)
found a negligible relationship between self-reported knowledge and
overall fertility awareness, our study found that a man’s self-assessment
of his own knowledge was an accurate indicator of his relative fertility
knowledge; those who rated themselves as knowledgeable achieved
higher knowledge scores than those who rated themselves as less
knowledgeable. Disparate findings may be due to the different method-
ologies that were used to measure fertility knowledge; rather than focus
on widespread beliefs, our study examined the awareness of specific
associations with infertility.
Since a lack of knowledge was not restricted to particular demo-
graphic groups, the results of this study highlight the need for universal
public education regarding male fertility. Some men (~9% in our study)
may be unaware that male factors contribute to a couple’s infertility,
and many others overestimated the extent of their knowledge. More
than 33% of our sample expressed concerns about their own fertility,
and almost 60% indicated that they wished to learn more about male
fertility. The survey results suggest several strategies for improving
men’s fertility awareness. (i) Few men indicated that they gained fertil-
ity knowledge from schools or universities. Educational institutions
provide an excellent forum for disseminating information to the wider
population. It would therefore be beneficial to incorporate fertility-
related topics in sexual education curricula. (ii) After exiting the edu-
cation system, the responsibility to keep individuals informed about
fertility shifts logically to primary health providers. Indeed, our study
found that most men would prefer to receive fertility information
from medical professionals. Men tend to ask fewer questions and get
less information from their healthcare providers (Wenger, 2011), so
primary care physicians should incorporate a discussion of repro-
ductive health when men access healthcare. (iii) our results showed
that men seek fertility information from online sources, confirming
what other studies have indicated about men’s preference for finding
medical information on the Internet (Berger et al., 2005), particularly
when it concerns stigmatized illnesses, such as infertility (Oliffe and
Phillips, 2008). While the Internet can be an excellent medium for
disseminating reproductive health information, quality reviews of fer-
tility websites have demonstrated that this information may not be
wholly accurate or accessible (Okamura et al., 2002; Marriott et al.,
2008); as such, public health agencies should consider providing
improved online resources regarding infertility. (iv) As online articles,
by themselves, may be an ineffective tool for generating long-term
retention of fertility knowledge (Daniluk and Koert, 2015), other
technological platforms ought to be considered. Our results suggest
that mobile devices might be an effective way to reach men, as the
majority of our sample reported that they use a smartphone. The
accessibility and interactive nature of mobile technology may
enhance men’s engagement with health interventions (Short et al.,
2014). Therefore, future initiatives to increase men’s knowledge
should capitalize on emerging technologies, such as mobile health
applications, to educate men about their own fertility.
A limitation of our study is that the sample consisted of men who
volunteered to take the survey resulting in the self-selection of

 respondents. The sample may be skewed toward individuals with
Internet access, just as telephone-based surveys exclude respondents
without a telephone in the household. There may be some question
about our choice of decoy items, as there is ongoing research of the
associations with infertility. Insomnia, for example, has been shown to
be associated with an infertility diagnosis (Bak et al., 2012). However,
as the decoy items did not factor into our overall knowledge scores,
they did not impact our results. Future studies will be required to
evaluate the associations that have mixed evidentiary support in the lit-
erature. Additionally, we interpreted respondents’ correct identifica-
tion of associations with male infertility as being an indication of fertility
knowledge, but it is possible that respondents were demonstrating
awareness of how certain behaviours, such as smoking, can negatively
impact general health status (Bunting and Boivin, 2008). Likewise, men
may erroneously think that frequent bicycling is not a risk factor for
male infertility, because they believe that nearly all exercise has a posi-
tive impact on general health.
By focusing solely on men, our study is among the first to provide
insight into the current state of men’s fertility knowledge. While further
studies are required to confirm these findings, we identified specific
gaps in knowledge in the general population. Public health initiatives
should tailor campaigns to educate men about the lesser known asso-
ciations with male infertility, particularly those that are most prevalent
and preventable through lifestyle modification. Our results also reveal
men’s preferences for receiving information. By increasing fertility
knowledge, one can promote general health, through early diagnosis of
related medical conditions and reduce the risk of infertility, with its
attendant physical, emotional and financial costs.
