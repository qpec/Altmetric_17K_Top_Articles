Abstract
Objectives—To explore whether work schedules and physically demanding work were 
associated with markers of ovarian reserve and response.
Methods—This analysis included women (n=473 and n=313 for ovarian reserve and ovarian 
response analysis, respectively) enrolled in a prospective cohort study of couples presenting to an 
academic fertility center (2004–2015). Information on occupational factors was collected on a 
take-home questionnaire, and reproductive outcomes were abstracted from electronic medical 
records. Generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the 
associations.
Results—Women who reported lifting or moving heavy objects at work had 1.0 fewer total 
oocytes (p-value=0.08), 1.4 fewer mature oocytes (p-value=0.007), and 0.7 fewer antral follicles 
(p-value=0.06) compared to women who reported never lifting or moving heavy objects at work. 
The inverse association between heavy lifting and oocyte yield was stronger in women >37 years 
and with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Women who worked evening/night/rotating shifts had 2.3 (p-
value<0.001) fewer mature oocytes, on average, compared with women who worked day-only

 shifts. None of the occupational exposures were associated with day 3 FSH or peak estradiol 
levels.
Conclusion—Women working non-daytime shifts and those with physically demanding jobs had 
fewer mature oocytes retrieved after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Our results provide

INTRODUCTION
Some occupational factors have been suggested to disrupt circadian regulation [1] which 
could in turn affect reproductive outcomes among women. For instance, shift work, long 
working hours and physical factors have been found to increase the risk of menstrual cycle 
disturbances,[2, 3] spontaneous abortion,[4] preterm birth [5, 6] and low birth weight;[6] 
however the relation of these occupational factors with fecundity is less clear.[7–15]
While the terms fertility and fecundity are often used synonymously, they are separate 
constructs with fecundity defined as the biologic capacity for reproduction and fertility 
defined as demonstrated fecundity, usually measured by live births. Given the absence of a 
gold standard to measure fecundity, previous studies have relied on a variety of different 
endpoints. For example, in previous publications on occupational factors and fecundity, the 
main outcome was defined as the time to pregnancy,[7–9, 12–15] while in others it was 
measured as the pregnancy duration,[5, 11] pregnancy and delivery rate,[11] or time of 
unprotected intercourse.[10] However, given the nature of these studies, they were unable to 
measure biomarkers of fecundity such as reproductive hormones or ovarian function, and as 
such they could only postulate on the possible mechanisms underlying associations between 
occupational factors and fecundity. By studying a cohort of women undergoing in vitro 
fertilization (IVF), it is possible to directly observe many biomarkers of fecundity which 
cannot be observed in couples attempting to conceive naturally. These include markers of 
ovarian reserve (e.g. number of antral follicles and levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH), commonly used as indicators of ovarian age) and ovarian response to stimulation 
(e.g. number of mature oocytes which are capable of developing into healthy embryos); 
these measures can thus lend insight into potential biological mechanisms.
To address this gap, we examined whether shift work and physically demanding work are 
associated with markers of ovarian reserve (i.e. total antral follicle count (AFC) and follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) levels) and ovarian response to controlled ovarian 
hyperstimulation during IVF (i.e. peak estradiol (E2) levels and oocyte yields) among 
women attending an academic fertility center in Boston, MA.

 METHODS
Study population
Study participants were women enrolled in the Environment and Reproductive Health 
(EARTH) Study, an ongoing prospective cohort established in 2004 to evaluate 
environmental and dietary determinants of fertility.[16] Women between 18 and 45 years 
and who planned to use their own gametes at enrollment were eligible to participate in the 
study. Approximately 60% of those contacted by the research nurses enrolled. For this 
analysis, women were eligible if their AFC was determined at the Massachusetts General 
Hospital (MGH) Fertility Center prior to assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle 
initiation between the years of 2004 and 2015 (n=581). Of these, 107 (18%) women were 
excluded because they did not complete a take-home questionnaire. Women who did not 
complete the take-home questionnaire did not have significantly different demographic 
characteristics compared to women included in the analysis. We additionally excluded 1 
woman who was missing body mass index (BMI). Of the 473 women included in the AFC 
analysis, 313 (66%) had completed at least one fresh IVF cycle (n=462 cycles) by December 
2015. Women excluded from the second analysis did not have significantly different baseline 
characteristics compared to women included in the analysis. The study was approved by the 
Human Studies Institutional Review Boards of the MGH, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School 
of Public Health. Participants signed an informed consent after the study procedures were 
explained by trained research study staff and all questions were answered.
Assessment of the exposure
Information on work schedule and physically demanding work was collected on a take-home 
questionnaire. Women reported how often they lifted or moved heavy objects in their current 
job with response options of “never”, “sometimes”, or “often”. Women also reported the 
level of physical exertion in their current job using the following categories: light (e.g. most 
time spent sitting, office work), moderate (e.g. lifting/pushing light loads, long periods of 
walking), and heavy (e.g. lifting, pushing heavy loads, heavy manual labor). To assess the 
effect of shift timing, women reported whether their typical work shift was day, evening, 
night, or rotating.
Assessment of the outcomes
Markers of Ovarian Reserve—All women participating in the study underwent an 
evaluation of ovarian AFC through transvaginal ultrasonography. All of these transvaginal 
ultrasounds were performed in the year prior to the IVF cycle by one of the MGH 
reproductive endocrinology and infertility physicians on the 3rd day of an unstimulated 
menstrual cycle or on the 3rd day of a progesterone withdrawal bleed. FSH was measured in 
serum, collected on the third day of the menstrual cycle, using an automated 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at the MGH Core Laboratory as previously 
described.[17] No fertility medications were used in the cycle preceding either the 
ultrasonographic determination of the AFC or the FSH measurements. Women with a 
diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) as noted in their medical records were not 
included in this analysis (n=48), however, of the 473 women, 11 (2.3%) women had 
AFC>30 and to reduce the influence of these very high values, we truncated AFC at 30.

 Markers of Ovarian Response—Women who completed an IVF cycle in our study 
underwent one of three controlled ovarian stimulation protocols on day 3 of induced menses 
after completing a cycle of oral contraceptives: 1) luteal phase gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH)-agonist protocol, 2) follicular phase GnRH-agonist/Flare protocol, or 3) 
GnRH-antagonist protocol. Lupron dose was reduced at, or shortly after, the start of ovarian 
stimulation with FSH/hMG in the luteal phase GnRH-agonist protocol. FSH/hMG and 
GnRH-agonist or GnRH-antagonist was continued to the day of trigger with human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). During gonadotropin treatment, women were monitored for 
serum E2 levels (Elecsys Estradiol II reagent kit, Roche Diagnostics), follicle size 
measurements and counts, and endometrial thickness and pattern. hCG was administered 
intramuscularly approximately 35–36 hours before the scheduled egg retrieval procedure to 
induce oocyte maturity. Details of egg retrieval have been previously described.[17] In brief, 
peak serum E2 concentration was defined as the highest level of E2 preceding the oocyte 
retrieval and obtained on the day of hCG administration. Following egg retrieval, 
embryologists determined the total number of oocytes retrieved and classified them as 
germinal vesicle, metaphase I, metaphase II (MII) or degenerated.
Assessment of covariates
The participant’s date of birth was collected at entry, and weight and height were measured 
by trained study staff. BMI was calculated as weight (in kilograms) per height (in meters) 
squared. The detailed take-home questionnaire also contained additional questions on 
lifestyle factors, reproductive health, and medical history. Time spent in leisure time 
physical and sedentary activities was assessed using a validated questionnaire.[18] 
Specifically, women reported the average time per week during the preceding year spent on 
any of the following activities: walking, jogging, running, biking, swimming, tennis, squash, 
weightlifting, aerobics or aerobic exercise equipment, and moderate (e.g. yard work, 
gardening), heavy (e.g. digging, chopping) outdoor work, sitting at work, sitting while 
driving, and sitting at home. Each activity question had 13 categories for response ranging 
from “never” to “40+ hours per week”. The duration of activity was assigned using the 
median value for each category. We calculated total physical and sedentary activity (hrs/
week) by summing across all physical and sedentary activities. Clinical information 
including infertility diagnosis and protocol type was abstracted from electronic medical 
records.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and baseline reproductive characteristics of the women were presented using 
median ± interquartile ranges (IQRs) or percentages. Women’s exposures to each 
occupational factor were categorized into groups based on the questionnaire responses, 
although when appropriate, categories were collapsed due to small sample sizes. 
Associations between frequency of moving heavy objects at work and typical work shift, 
with demographic and reproductive characteristics were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis 
tests for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables (or Fisher’s 
exact test where appropriate). We fit multivariable generalized linear models to estimate the 
association of occupational factors with AFC (Poisson distribution and log link) and FSH 
level (normal distribution and identity link). For the IVF outcomes, multivariable

 generalized linear mixed models with were used to evaluate the association of occupational 
factors with oocyte counts (Poisson distribution and log link) and peak E2 level (normal 
distribution and identity link), with a random intercept to account for correlation in 
outcomes across multiple IVF cycles per woman. To allow for better interpretation of the 
results, population marginal means [19] are presented adjusting for all the covariates in the 
model (with covariates at their average values).
Confounding was assessed using prior knowledge based on biological relevance and through 
descriptive statistics from our study population. The variables considered as potential 
confounders included factors previously related to reproductive outcomes in this and other 
studies, and factors associated with occupational factors and reproductive outcomes in this 
study. Covariates were retained in the final models if they resulted in a change in the 
exposure-outcomes effect estimate >10%. Final models were adjusted for age (continuous), 
BMI (continuous), education (less than college graduate, college graduate and graduate 
degree) and infertility diagnosis (male, female and unexplained). Additional models were 
run co-adjusting for other occupational factors to account for any correlations between 
occupational exposures. Effect modification by age (<37 yrs vs. ≥37 yrs) and BMI (<25 
kg/m2 vs. ≥25 kg/m2) was tested by adding a cross product term to the final multivariate 
model. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA).
RESULTS
The median (IQR) age and BMI of the 473 women was 35 years (32, 38) and 23.2 kg/m2 
(21.2, 26.2), respectively (Table 1). Participants were mostly Caucasian (85%), with a 
college degree or higher (92%), and most had never smoked (73%). The majority of women 
(80%) had undergone a previous fertility exam and less than half of the women (48%) had 
been treated for infertility before the study. Unexplained infertility was the primary 
infertility diagnosis at enrollment (44%). 40% of women reported lifting or moving heavy 
objects at work, 22% reported moderate or heavy physical exertion at work, and 91% 
worked day-only shifts. Women who reported moving or lifting heavy objects at work, were 
less educated on average, compared with women who reported never moving or lifting 
heavy objects at work (49% vs 66% with graduate school education). No other baseline 
characteristics differed substantially across these two groups (Table 1). Women who worked 
evening/night or rotating shifts were less educated and engaged in more leisure-time 
physical activity on average, compared with women who worked day-only shifts (38% vs 
62% with graduate school education, and 9 vs. 5 hr/week) (Supplemental Table 1). The 
median (IQR) AFC among the 473 women was 12 (8, 17), and the median (IQR) number of 
mature oocyte yields in the 313 women who underwent IVF was 9 (6, 12).
There was a marginal association between frequency of lifting or moving heavy objects at 
work and total AFC after adjusting for age, BMI, education and infertility diagnosis (Table 
2). Women who reported lifting or moving heavy objects at work had a lower AFC (adjusted 
difference = -0.7) compared with women who reported never lifting or moving heavy objects 
at work (p-value=0.06). This association remained after adjustment for level of physical 
exertion but became attenuated when adjusted for typical work shift (data not shown).

 Frequency of moving heavy objects was unrelated with day 3 FSH levels. Typical work 
schedule and level of physical exertion at work were not associated with total AFC and day 
3 FSH levels (Table 2).
In regards to markers of ovarian response, peak E2 level was unrelated to the occupational 
exposures. However, women who reported lifting or moving heavy objects at work had 1.0 
(p-value=0.08) and 1.4 (p-value=0.007) fewer total and mature oocyte counts compared to 
women who reported never lifting or moving heavy objects at work, reflecting decreases of 
8.8% and 14.4%, respectively (Table 3). Level of physical exertion at work and typical work 
schedule were also related to number of total and mature oocyte yields in our study 
population (Table 3). In adjusted models, women who had moderate to heavy physical 
exertion at work had a 1.3 (p-value=0.02) fewer mature oocytes on average than woman with 
light physical exertion at work. In addition, women who worked evening/night/rotating shifts 
had 2.3 (p-value<0.001) fewer mature oocytes, on average, compared with women who 
worked day only shifts. This association was stronger when evening/night shift workers 
were considered as a separate category (3.2 fewer mature oocytes compared with women 
working day shifts, n=8) (data not shown).
The associations between frequency of moving or lifting heavy objects and typical work 
shift and oocyte yields remained similar when the individual models were further adjusted 
for the other occupational characteristics (Supplemental Table 2); however, the inverse 
association between level of physical exertion at work and mature oocyte yield became 
attenuated after adjustment for either work schedule or frequency of moving or lifting a 
heavy load. Further adjustment for total leisure-time physical activity (hr/week) and 
smoking status (never vs. ever smoker) did not affect the results (data not shown).
Finally, we explored whether BMI or age modified the associations between occupational 
characteristics and markers of ovarian reserve and response. The association between 
frequency of moving heavy objects at work and number of mature oocyte yield appeared to 
be stronger among overweight/obese women compared to lean women and stronger among 
older women compared with young women (Figure 1); however, the tests for interaction 
were not significant (p-value for interaction=0.19 and 0.26, respectively). For example, 
women with a BMI≥25 who reported moving or lifting heavy objects at work had 2.2 fewer 
mature oocytes (p-value=0.008) compared to women with a BMI≥25 who never reported 
moving or lifting heavy objects at work, whereas this difference in lean women was only 1.1 
fewer mature oocytes (p-value= 0.10). Similarly, women who were ≥37 years old and 
reported moving or lifting heavy objects at work, on average, had 1.9 fewer mature oocytes 
(p-value=0.02) compared women who were ≥37 years old and never reported moving or 
lifting heavy objects at work. The analogous difference in younger women was 1.2 fewer 
mature oocytes (p-value= 0.07) (Figure 1). None of the other associations were modified by 
age or BMI.
DISCUSSION
As far as we are aware, this is the first study exploring the association between occupational 
factors and markers of ovarian reserve and response among women of reproductive age. We

 found inverse associations between moving or lifting heavy objects at work and total and 
mature oocyte yields and possibly AFC. Moreover, the inverse association between heavy 
lifting and mature oocyte yield was slightly stronger among overweight and obese women 
and women ≥37 years. In addition, non-day work schedules were inversely related to oocyte 
yields, independent of physical work demands. These findings have clinical implications, as 
women with fewer mature oocytes would have fewer eggs which are capable of developing 
into healthy embryos. None of the occupational factors, however, were associated with day 3 
FSH or peak E2 levels following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. These results suggest 
that occupational factors may be more specifically affecting oocyte production and quality, 
rather than accelerating ovarian aging, in this study population of women attending a fertility 
center.
Our findings that women who reported moving or lifting heavy objects at work had lower 
oocyte yields is consistent with a previous study which examined the effect of physical 
factors at work on menstrual cycle characteristics and fecundity among female nurses in the 
US.[3, 7] In these studies, nurses who reported lifting or moving a heavy load >15 times/day 
had had a 34% higher prevalence of irregular cycles and a 43% (95% CI 10, 83%) longer 
median duration of pregnancy attempt (even after further adjustment for current menstrual 
cycle regularity) compared to women who never lifted heavy loads. Also similar to us, 
Gaskins and coworkers found that the inverse association between moving heavy objects at 
work and fecundity was modified by BMI, being much stronger in overweight and obese 
women.[7] However, they did not find any effect modification by age. Our findings are also 
in agreement a study conducted among 260 nonmedical female hospital workers employed 
at 39 Dutch hospitals who were planning a pregnancy.[5, 15] In this study, women who 
worked jobs with high intensity and fatigue had shorter pregnancy durations (up to 18 days 
shorter) [5] and a longer time to pregnancy.[15] Taken together with our results, it appears 
that lower oocyte quality could be one pathway mediating the relationship between high 
frequency of moving or lifting heavy loads at work and reduced fecundity. However, the 
specific mechanism by which moving or lifting heavy loads at work affects oocyte quality is 
still unknown.
We also found that women who worked rotating, night, and evening shifts had lower oocyte 
yields, compared with women who worked day shift. Our finding that working non-day 
shifts tends to have negative reproductive consequences is consistent with two papers which 
shown that rotating shift work was associated with a higher prevalence of irregular cycles.[2, 
3] Irregular work shift has been also related to reduced fecundity in European [9, 10, 12] and 
Asian women.[11] For instance, Zhu and colleagues found that fixed evening workers and 
fixed night workers had a longer time to pregnancy among 39,913 women enrolled in the 
National Birth Danish Cohort between 1998 and 2000.[12] Based on our results, working 
non-day shifts may affect oocyte quality and fecundity through circadian rhythm disruption. 
However, Gaskins and coworkers found no relation between work shift and fecundity in 
women enrolled in the NHS3.[7] Similarly to them, other previous publications found no 
associations between work shift and fecundity [13, 14] and a recently published meta-
analysis found a non-significant effect of shift work compared with no shift work on 
infertility (adjusted odds ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.86, 1.43). [8] 
Given the mixed results of previous studies, clearly more research is needed.

 Our study has limitations worth noting. Due to its design, it may not be possible to 
generalize our findings to couples conceiving without medical intervention. However, these 
findings may be applicable to other women seeking infertility treatment which is a sizeable 
population.[20] Also, as is true for all observational studies, misclassification of 
occupational exposure is possible, however because we collected the occupational 
information when the women joined the study and all outcomes were collected subsequent 
to this, we would expect any misclassification to be non-differential. In addition, only 
current shift work and physically demanding work were assessed in our questionnaire. Thus, 
we were not able to assess the effect of long work hours on markers of ovarian reserve or 
response and we were not able to control for other work characteristics that might be 
correlated with shift and physically demanding work. Because we did not explicitly define 
rotating shifts, but rather left this up to the interpretation of the woman, this was likely a 
heterogeneous category including women working rotating day shifts and those switching 
between day and night shifts. We also did not collect information on duration of shift or 
duration of physically demanding work and thus it is hard to tease out the short- vs. long-
term effects of these exposures. Future work in other studies is needed to further disentangle 
the effects of rotating shift work with and without nights and current versus lifetime 
exposure to shift work on fecundity. Finally, the amount and type of work a woman does 
could be related with many aspects of her life, such as socioeconomic status and financial 
pressure, which are hard to quantify and could result in residual confounding. It is also 
possible that women who perform heavy lifting at work are exposed to other occupational 
exposures and this residual confounding may still be driving some of the results we 
observed. Strengths of our study include its prospective design which minimizes the 
possibility of reverse causation and avoids recall bias and our ability to measure well-
accepted markers of fertility and fecundity. By studying a population of women undergoing 
infertility treatment we were also able to circumvent a major limitation of prior studies on 
occupational exposures and fecundity which is the lack of information on frequency or 
timing of sexual intercourse which is suspected to be a major confounder of the work 
schedule and fecundity associations. Finally, our comprehensive adjustment for other 
lifestyle factors that could be confounding the association between occupational factors and 
fecundity was a strength.
In conclusion, women working non-day shifts and those who had more physically 
demanding jobs had fewer mature oocytes retrieved after controlled ovarian 
hyperstimulation. Our results provide insight into possible mechanisms linking these 
occupational exposures with decreased fecundity.

 WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
-
While previous studies have demonstrated a link between work schedule and 
physical factors and fecundity, none have been able to directly measure 
biomarkers of fecundity such as reproductive hormones or ovarian function, 
and as such they could only postulate on the possible mechanisms underlying 
the associations between occupational factors and fecundity.
-
In this prospective cohort study of women presenting to an academic fertility 
center, moving or lifting heavy objects at work was inversely associated with 
total and mature oocyte yields and antral follicle counts. The inverse 
association between heavy lifting and mature oocyte yield was stronger 
among overweight/obese women and women ≥37 years. Non-daytime work 
schedules were inversely related to oocyte yields.
-
Our results provide insight into possible mechanisms linking these 
occupational exposures with decreased fecundity.
