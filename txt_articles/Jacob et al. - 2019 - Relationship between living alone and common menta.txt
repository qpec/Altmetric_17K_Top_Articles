Abstract
Given the high prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) and individuals living alone
in the United Kingdom, the goal of this study using English nationally representative data
was to examine the association between living alone and CMDs, and to identify potential
mediating factors of this association. The data were drawn from the 1993, 2000 and 2007
National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys. CMDs were assessed using the Clinical Interview
Schedule-Revised (CIS-R), a questionnaire focusing on past week neurotic symptoms. The
presence of CMDs was defined as a CIS-R total score of 12 and above. Multivariable logistic
regression and mediation analyses were conducted to analyze the association between liv-
ing alone and CMDs, and to identify mediators in this association. The prevalence of CMDs
was higher in individuals living alone than in those not living alone in all survey years. Multi-
variable analysis showed a positive association between living alone and CMDs in all survey
years (1993: odds ratio [OR] = 1.69; 2000: OR = 1.63; and 2007: OR = 1.88). Overall, loneli-
ness explained 84% of the living alone-CMD association. Living alone was positively associ-
ated with CMDs. Interventions addressing loneliness among individuals living alone may be
particularly important for the mental wellbeing of this vulnerable population.
Introduction
Globally, the lifetime prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) is around 30% [1].
CMDs have a major impact on quality of life [2], physical illness [3] and mortality [4]. For
example, depressive disorders were the second and anxiety disorders the sixth leading causes
of years lived with disability in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study, respectively [5,6]. The
effects of CMDs are not limited to the individual level, and these chronic conditions are associ-
ated with an important economic burden [7]. Therefore, there is a need for a better

Data Availability Statement: Regarding the data
on which the present study was based, the dataset
is available to qualified researchers upon formal
request to the UK data service data repository
(https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/). Approval to
have access to the dataset is at the discretion of the
UK data service, and we had no special access
privileges in requesting data. Our approval to
access these data from the UK data service was
based on the condition that it would not be shared.
Thus, it will not be possible to share this data
ourselves. Once permission is granted, the UK data
 understanding of the risk factors of CMDs in order to improve the prevention, management
and treatment of these disorders.
In the past decades, there has been a growing interest in the association between living
alone and CMDs [8–18], partly driven by the fact that in many settings, the proportion of indi-
viduals living alone is increasing due to factors such as population ageing [19], lowering fertil-
ity [20], decreasing marriage rates [21], and increasing divorce rates [22]. Although most
previous studies on this topic have found that living alone increases risk for CMD, they have
several limitations. First, since most of these studies were conducted in the elderly, their results
cannot be generalized to younger adults [12,13,15–18]. Second, the analyses often focused
exclusively on depression and did not include other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety or
obsessive-compulsive disorders [9,12–16,18], despite the fact that these disorders represent an
important share of CMDs and are highly debilitating conditions [23–25]. Finally, to the best of
our knowledge, to date, there are only a few studies which have quantified the extent to which
various factors can explain the association between living arrangements and CMDs [10,12,14].
For example, factors such as obesity [26,27], smoking status [28,29], alcohol dependence
[30,31], drug use [32,33], loneliness [34,35] and social support [36,37] are known to be more
common in those living alone, and are risk factors for psychiatric disorders.
Therefore, our goal was to examine the association between living alone and CMDs, and to
identify the factors that may be important in this association using nationally representative
community-based data from the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys.
The UK is a particularly apposite setting to examine this association given the high prevalence
of CMDs [38] and individuals living alone in this setting [39]. In particular, the magnitude of
loneliness in the UK is such that a minister of loneliness has recently been appointed to tackle
this problem in this country. Assessing the association between living alone and CMDs, and
the factors that may underlie this association is important for the identification of vulnerable
populations and the establishment of effective strategies to improve population mental health.
Materials and methods
Study participants
The data were drawn from the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys
(NPMS) [40]. Although the surveys have similar overall characteristics, there were some differ-
ences. For example, the 1993 and 2000 surveys were carried out by the Office for National Sta-
tistics in the UK (England, Wales and Scotland), while the 2007 survey was undertaken by the
National Centre for Social Research in England and thus only included data from England.
Furthermore, only participants aged 16–64 years and 16–74 years were included in the first
and second surveys, respectively, while the third survey was conducted among all individuals
aged �16 years. In addition, the 1993 and 2000 surveys were carried out from January to
April, while the 2007 survey was carried out from January to December. Finally, the first sur-
vey was paper-based, whereas the 2000 and the 2007 were computer-based.
The multistage-stratified probability sampling design was similar across the 1993, 2000 and
2007 surveys, with the sampling frame consisting of the small user postcode address file, and
the primary sampling units of postcode sectors [41]. Sampling weights were constructed to
account for non-response and the probability of being selected, so that the sample was repre-
sentative of the adult household population of the United Kingdom (1993 and 2000 surveys)
or England (2007 survey). None of the surveys recruited previous participants or sampled
from identical areas. The survey response rate was 79% for the year 1993 (n = 10108), 67% for
the year 2000 (n = 8580) and 57% for the year 2007 (n = 7403). Finally, institutional review

 board approval was obtained and all participants provided informed consent before their
inclusion.
Dependent and independent variables
Common mental disorders (dependent variable).
CMDs were assessed using the Clini-
cal Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R), a questionnaire focusing on past week neurotic symp-
toms. The presence of CMDs was defined as a CIS-R total score of 12 and above [38]. The
reliability and validity of the CIS-R have been reported in previous publications [42,43].
Living arrangement (independent variable).
Living arrangement was assessed with the
number of persons in the household, with “1” coded as “living alone” and “>1” coded as “not
living alone”.
Control variables.
The selection of the control variables was based on past literature [8–
18] and included sex (male or female), age (16–34, 35–59 or 60–64 years), ethnicity (British
White or other), employment status (employed, unemployed or economically inactive) and
level of education: high—A-level (advanced level) or higher, implying education until the age
of at least 18 years; medium—O-level (ordinary level) or GCSE (General Certificate of Second-
ary Education), indicating having left school at the UK statutory school, leaving age of 16
years; or low—implying having left school before the age of 16 years and/or with no educa-
tional qualifications.
Mediating variables.
The potential mediating variables were selected based on previous
studies which have shown that they are associated with living arrangement [26,29,31,33,34,36],
and are risk factors for CMDs [27,28,30,32,35,37].
Obesity. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared based on self-reported weight and height. Using the standard WHO definition,
obesity was defined as �30 kg/m2 [44].
Smoking status. Current smoking was a binary variable based on the question “Do you
currently smoke cigarettes at all?”, with yes and no answer options [40].
Alcohol dependence. Excessive alcohol consumption was screened using the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [45]. Alcohol dependence was assessed with the Sever-
ity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C) in participants with an AUDIT score of
10 or above [46]. Scores of four or above indicated alcohol dependence in the past six months.
Drug use. Each individual was asked if he/she had used in the past year one of the following
drugs: cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, acid or LSD, magic mush-
rooms, methadone or physeptone, tranquilizers, amyl nitrate, anabolic steroids, and glues [44].
Those who claimed to have used any of these drugs were considered drug users.
Loneliness. This was assessed with an item from the Social Functioning Questionnaire
(SFQ) [47]. Respondents were asked to assess to what extent they had felt “lonely and isolated
from other people” in the past two weeks with the response options, “very much”, “some-
times”, “not often” and “not at all”. In the analyses that follow, these response options were
dichotomized with those who responded “sometimes” and “very much” being categorized as
lonely [48].
Social support. This was assessed with a 7-item measure. Using answer options “not true”
(score = 0), “partly true” (score = 1) and “certainly true” (score = 2), participants responded to
statements which inquired if, family and friends did things to make them happy, made them
feel loved, could be relied on no matter what, would see that they were taken care of no matter
what, accepted them just the way they are, made them feel an important part of their lives, and
gave them support and encouragement. Responses were added to create a scale score that
could range from 0 to 14. The internal consistency of the scale was good: Cronbach’s α = 0.89.

 Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed with Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, Texas).
The sample weighting and the complex study design were taken into account in all analyses.
The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
In order to have comparable samples across surveys, the data were restricted to participants
aged 16–64 years from England. Differences in the sample characteristics by living arrange-
ment were tested using Chi-squared tests in the three separate datasets. Effect sizes were esti-
mated as Phi for dichotomous categorical variables, and as Cramer’s V for categorical variables
with more than two categories. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis
adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, employment status and level of education to assess the associa-
tion between living alone (independent variable) and CMDs (dependent variable) separately
for each survey. The logistic regression analysis was further stratified by sex and age (16–34,
35–59 and 60–64 years). Finally, using the 2007 dataset, we tested whether smoking status,
alcohol dependence and drug use are effect modifiers in the association between living alone
and depression by including product terms (living alone X smoking, living alone X alcohol
dependence, living alone X drug use) in the fully adjusted model.
Mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the specific contribution of obesity, smok-
ing status, alcohol dependence, drug use, loneliness, and social support in the living alone-
CMD relationship. This analysis only used data from the 2007 survey because most of the vari-
ables were missing from other surveys, and included all individuals aged �16 years from
England. We used the khb (Karlson Holm Breen) command in Stata for the mediation analysis
[49]. This method can be applied in logistic regression models and decomposes the total effect
(i.e., unadjusted for the mediator) of a variable into direct (i.e., the effect of living alone on
CMDs adjusted for the mediator) and indirect effects (i.e., the mediational effect). Using this
method, the percentage of the main association explained by the mediator can also be calcu-
lated (mediated percentage). The mediation analysis controlled for sex, age, ethnicity, employ-
ment status and level of education.
Results
Of the 20503 individuals from England aged 16–64 years, 8903 were from the 1993 survey,
6175 from the 2000 survey, and 5425 from the 2007 survey (Table 1). The prevalence of those
living alone in the respective surveys were 8.8%, 9.8% and 10.7%. The corresponding figures
for CMD were 14.1%, 16.3%, and 16.4%, respectively. Male sex, older age and unemployment
were more frequent in participants living alone than in those not living alone, while the distri-
bution of education was significantly different between the two groups. Details of the relation-
ship status of the participants by year and living arrangement (alone or not) are shown in
Table 2. The answer options for the survey conducted in 2000 were different from those of
1993 and 2007 but across all surveys, there were very few people who were married but living
alone. The prevalence of CMDs was higher in individuals living alone than in those not living
alone in all surveys (1993: 19.9% versus 13.6%; 2000: 23.2% versus 15.5%; and 2007: 24.7% ver-
sus 15.4%; Fig 1). The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis are shown in
Table 3. There was a positive association between living alone and CMDs in the 1993 (odds
ratio [OR] = 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.44–2.00), 2000 (OR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.37–
1.93) and 2007 datasets (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.57–2.26). This association remained significant
in the stratified analyses except in people aged 60–64 years in 1993 (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 0.99–
2.55) and 2000 (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 0.76–2.22). The non-significance among the older popula-
tion may have been due to lack of statistical power as the proportion of individuals in this age
group was small in the 1993 and 2000 surveys (i.e., <8%). No significant interactions were

 found for smoking status, alcohol dependence and drug use in the 2007 dataset. Table 4 dis-
plays the results of the mediation analysis using data from 7403 people aged �16 years from
England. Overall, loneliness explained 84% of the living alone-CMD association and no other
significant mediators explaining more than 20% of this association were identified.

 living alone. Furthermore, the results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis showed
that people living alone had a significant 1.39–2.43 times higher odds for CMDs. This associa-
tion was observed in all age groups including young adults and both sexes, and the magnitude
of the association remained relatively stable between 1993 and 2007. Finally, overall, the rela-
tionship between living alone and CMDs was largely mediated by loneliness.

 Interpretation of the findings
Several authors have investigated the association between living alone and CMDs [8–18]. In
the late 1990s, researchers from the UK found that living alone was associated with a 1.3-fold
increase in the risk of diagnosis of depression and anxiety [8]. The main limitation of this
study is that it focused on sociodemographic factors and did not account for other variables
such as behavioral factors. Later, in 2008, another study conducted in the same country
showed that the prescription of antidepressant, anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs was higher in
people living alone than in those not living alone [11]. Similar findings have been reported
from other settings. For example, in a population-based sample of 4685 adults from Finland,
there was a 2-fold increase in the risk of having anxiety or depressive disorders in people living
alone compared to those who were married [10]. Therefore, our findings are in line with exist-
ing literature but extend previous knowledge by showing that the association between living
alone and CMDs has remained relatively stable between 1993 and 2007, and that this associa-
tion is ubiquitous regardless of age and sex.
Based on data from 2007, we found that loneliness was the strongest significant explanatory
factor of the association between living alone and CMDs, explaining approximately 84% of the
association overall. Loneliness has previously been reported to be more frequent in people liv-
ing alone than in those living with a spouse [34]. In our study, the prevalence of loneliness
among those living alone in 2007 was 34% and this figure was much higher than in those who
were not living alone (18%). Loneliness has been prospectively associated with the subsequent
emergence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety [50,51]. It has been sug-
gested that loneliness may lead to CMDs via rumination [52], negative appraisals of social
company [53], immune dysregulation [54] or addiction [55]. Regarding rumination, previous
research conducted in the US revealed that rumination mediates the association between lone-
liness and depressed mood in college students, suggesting that negative cognitive and emo-
tional self-regulatory strategies have a major impact on mental health [56]. Negative appraisals
of social company also play a major role in the association between loneliness and CMDs, and
this involves hostility [57] and social phobia [58]. Finally, researchers have previously observed
that perceived social isolation increases the risk of immune dysregulations [59], and both
immune suppression and activation are known to be key features of depression and other
mental disorders [60].

 Clinical implications and directions for future research
Our study results indicate that living alone may be a risk factor for CMDs regardless of age
and sex and that loneliness may be an important mediating factor. Clinicians should be aware
that those living alone have a higher prevalence of CMDs and that this may largely be
explained by loneliness. Previously reported interventions to decrease levels of loneliness
include social facilitation interventions, psychological therapies, health and social care provi-
sion, animal interventions, befriending interventions and leisure/skill development [61].
Given that our study was of cross-sectional design, future studies of longitudinal design are
warranted to provide more concrete evidence regarding causality and temporal associations.
Future studies should also seek to identify other potential mediators such as cortisol dysregula-
tions [62,63] or changes in brain structure [64,65] that were not assessed in our study. Investi-
gating cortisol dysregulations is important because it has been found that people living alone
are at a particular risk for elevated night time cortisol and flat diurnal slope [63], and that corti-
sol is a key player in the development of major depressive disorder [62]. Social exclusion and
loneliness are also associated with major changes in the brain (e.g., decreased activity of corti-
cal regions involved in mentalizing) [65], while imaging studies have reported changes in the
volume of several cerebral regions (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala) in CMDs [64]. Finally, given
that cognition (especially social cognition) is frequently impaired in individuals with low levels
of social interaction [66] and people with mental disorders [67], future studies should assess its
mediating and moderating role in the relationship between independent living and CMDs.
Strengths and limitations
The large sample size and the use of three nationally representative surveys are the main
strengths of the study. Nonetheless, there are several limitations that should be mentioned.
First, the declining response rates in the successive surveys are problematic and may have
introduced bias in our results. However, previous research has highlighted the fact that the risk
estimates in the identification of risk factors of psychiatric conditions are only minimally
affected by low response rates [68,69]. Second, since the analysis did not include the homeless,
the present results cannot be generalized to this population, where living alone is very com-
mon. Third, as self-reports were used to assess CMDs, and as CMDs are frequently associated
with stigma [70], it is possible that we have underestimated the prevalence of these disorders.
Finally, since the design of this work was cross-sectional, causality or temporality in the rela-
tionship between living alone and CMDs cannot be determined. Thus, future longitudinal
studies are warranted.
Conclusion
Living alone was positively associated with CMDs regardless of sex or age, and this association
was largely explained by loneliness. Based on these findings, prevention of CMDs in people liv-
ing alone should consider all ages and targeting loneliness in particular may be important.
