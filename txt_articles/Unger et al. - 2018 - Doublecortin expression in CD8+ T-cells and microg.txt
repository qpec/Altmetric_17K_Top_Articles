Abstract
Introduction: One characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease is the formation of amyloid-b plaques, which
are typically linked to neuroinflammation and surrounded by inflammatory cells such as microglia and
infiltrating immune cells.
Methods: Here, we describe nonneurogenic doublecortin (DCX) positive cells, DCX being gener-
ally used as a marker for young immature neurons, at sites of amyloid-b plaques in various transgenic
amyloid mouse models and in human brains with plaque pathology.
Results: The plaque-associated DCX1 cells were not of neurogenic identity, instead most of them
showed coexpression with markers for microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and for
phagocytosis(CD68andTREM2).Anothersubpopulationofplaque-associatedDCX1 cellswasnegative
for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 but was highly positive for the pan-leukocyte marker
CD45. These hematopoietic cells were identified as CD3-and CD8-positive and CD4-negative T-cells.
Discussion: Peculiarly, the DCX1/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 11 microglia and
DCX1/CD81 T-cells were closely attached, suggesting that these two cell types are tightly interact-
ing and that this interaction might shape plaque pathology.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by a progres-
sive loss of cognitive functions [1,2]. Formation of
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-b plaques is
described as major neuropathological hallmarks of AD,
and several transgenic mouse models are designed to
produce amyloid-b plaques and/or tau pathologies and to
mimic the cognitive deficits of AD for studying AD
pathogenesis
[3,4].
Neuroinflammation,
especially
the
activation of microglia is heavily debated to contribute to
disease progression and to worsen late-stage pathology
[5–7]. Microglia cells are located directly at sites of
amyloid deposits in AD brains, where they are supposed to
phagocytose the amyloid plaque material [8,9]. Several
reports suggest that in more advanced stages of plaque
pathology
and
AD,
microglia
become
increasingly
dysfunctional
in
phagocytosis,
in
cell
proliferation,

 motility, signaling, and in proteostasis, all contributing to an
altered microglia phenotype [10]. The occurrence of periph-
eral immune cells in the brain, specifically T-cells, and their
functional role and interaction with brain resident glial cells
is currently discussed. For example, there is evidence for
increased T-cell homing into the aged but otherwise healthy
brain [11, 12]. Moreover, higher T-cell numbers are found in
the brains of several amyloid plaque mouse models [13].
However, the specific T-cell subtypes, their functional rele-
vance, and a possible modulatory activity of T-cells in brains
with plaque pathology are still controversial [14].
Besides neuroinflammation, altered levels of adult neuro-
genesis are reported to manifest along AD pathology in
several amyloid-b transgenic mouse models [15]. Adult hip-
pocampal neurogenesis is the production of new functional
neurons from neural stem and progenitor cells and takes
place in specific neurogenic niches in the mammalian brain,
namely the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the
subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle walls [16–19].
There, stem cells give rise to neuronal progenitor cells,
which mature and integrate functionally in the existing
neuronal network [20]. The population of neuronal precur-
sors or young immature neurons can be identified by its
expression of the microtubule-associated protein doublecor-
tin (DCX) [21,22].
We recently demonstrated changes in hippocampal neu-
rogenesis already at very early stages of disease pathology
in transgenic amyloid-b animal models, before the manifes-
tation of amyloid-b plaques [23]. In the frame of this
analysis,
we
made
the
surprising
finding
of
DCX-
immunoreactive cells outside the neurogenic niche at sites
of amyloid deposits. Here, we present a detailed analysis
of the identity of DCX-immunoreactive cell populations
associated with amyloid plaques in cortical and hippocam-
pal brain regions of various transgenic amyloid mouse
models and in human brains with plaque pathology and in
AD specimen. We report for the very first time on DCX-
immunoreactive microglia in amyloid mouse models and
on DCX-positive T-cells that presumably infiltrate the brain
parenchyma of AD transgenic mice and tightly associated
with the resident microglia.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
Female amyloid-b precursor protein (APP) Swedish
PS1 dE9 (APP-PS1) mice [24] expressing a chimeric mouse
or
human
mutant
amyloid
precursor
protein
(Mo/
HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1
dE9) both directed to central nervous system neurons under
the prion protein promoter (Jackson Laboratory, http://www.
jax.org/strain/005864) were used. For brain histology, we
analyzed mice at 3, 10, and 13 months of age. Age-
matched nontransgenics derived from the breeding of APP
Swedish PS1 dE9 were used as control animals. Mice were
housed at the University Hospital Bonn–Clinical Neurosci-
ence in groups under standard conditions at a temperature
of 22�C and a 12 h light or dark cycle with ad libitum access
to standard food and water. Animal care and handling were
performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by local ethical committees. Brain sections of
the APP-Lon/Swe mice overexpressing hAbPP751 with
the London (V717I) and Swedish (K670M/N671L) muta-
tions [25,26] and the transgenic APP-SDI mouse model
overexpressing human amyloid-b precursor protein (APP
770 isoform) with the Swedish K670N/M671L, Dutch
E693Q, and Iowa D694N mutations [27,28] were kindly
provided
by
Prof.
Christian
Humpel

and
Psychosomatic, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria).
Brain sections from transgenic Tg2576 mice [29,30]
overexpressing the human APP Swedish mutation and
wild type littermates at postnatal ages from 3 to 18 months
were kindly provided by Prof. Steffen Roßner (Paul
Flechsig
Institute
for
Brain
Research,
University
of
Leipzig, Germany). Brain sections from DCX knockout
mice (DCX-KO) and age-matched controls [31] were kindly
provided by Fiona Francis (Institut du Fer �
a Moulin, Paris,
France). Brain sections of 8-month-old human a-synuclein
overexpressing mice (D-line), a model of synucleinopathy
and of Lewy body dementia [32–34], were included in the
study.
2.2. Behavior test
For analysis of spatial learning and memory function,
Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed in accor-
dance
with
the
local
Animal
Health
Commission
(BMWFW-66.019/0032-WF/V/3 b/2016). This MWM para-
digm was performed as previously published [35]. For
behavior analysis, 13- to 15-month-old female and male
APP-PS1 and age-matched Nestin-CreERT2/R26R-YFP
control animals [35,36] were used (n 5 4/group). For
the MWM test, a 108 cm round basin arena filled with
22� 6 1�C warm water was used. A 10 ! 10 cm square
platform was placed 1 cm below the water surface in the
maze. Big black cue symbols were put on each wall of the
basin and the testing room to allow the animals spatial
orientation. The experimental setup was not changed
throughout the whole learning session and performed
under
constant
light
conditions.
Water
maze
trials
(maximum 60 s) for learning were performed twice a day
for a total of 5 days. On each trial, every mouse was put in
the water and given 60 s to swim and locate the
submerged platform. If the platform was not detected
within 60 s, the animal was guided onto the platform and
allowed to remain there for 10 s to learn the spatial
position of the platform. Only on the first trial of day 1,
the platform was marked with a black flag to visualize the
platform location to the mice. On day 6, an additional

 memory paradigm was performed by removing the platform,
and mice were tracked for 60 s. The swim path, that is, the
total distance moved and the swim speed was recorded
using EthoVision software (XT 9.0.726, Noldus). In the
absence of the platform during the last session, the time
the animals spent in the platform quadrant and the visits in
the platform quadrant were additionally calculated.
2.3. Human brain samples
We used 7 mm hippocampal sections from formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded brain samples which were ob-
tained from the Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource in accor-
dance with Newcastle University ethics board and ethical
approval awarded by the Joint Ethics Committee of New-
castle and North Tyneside Health Authority (reference:
08/H0906/136).
Irrespective of clinical diagnoses, all brains underwent
neuropathological examination according to a routine proto-
col that uses standardized neuropathological scoring or
grading systems, including NFT Braak staging [37,38],
Consortium
to
Establish
a
Registry
for
Alzheimer’s
Disease scores [39], Newcastle/McKeith Criteria for Lewy
body disease [40], National Institute on Aging—Alz-
heimer’s Association guidelines [41], and Thal phases of
amyloid-b deposition [42]. Our study group consisted of
14 AD cases which showed NFT Braak stages 4-6 and ful-
filled the criteria for high AD neuropathological change ac-
cording to the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s
Association guidelines [41] and besides classical AD pathol-
ogy (i.e., NFTs, amyloid plaques, and neuritic plaques) did
not show any other pathology (e.g., Lewy bodies, TAR
DNA-binding protein 43 positive intracellular inclusions)
in the hippocampus. As controls, we used seven cases with
NFT Braak stages 0 to 3, which showed no or only very
limited amounts of amyloid pathology in the hippocampus.
2.4. Perfusion and tissue processing
APP-PS1 animals were anesthetized and transcardially
perfused for immunohistochemistry as previously described
[43]. Following perfusion, the brains were extracted and
postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in sodium phosphate
buffer (0.1 M; pH 5 7.4) over night at 4�C. The brains
were cryoprotected and transferred into 30% sucrose in
0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (PBS) (pH 5 7.4). Sagittal
sections of 40 mm were cut on dry ice with a sliding
microtome.
2.5. Immunohistochemistry
Fluorescence immunohistochemistry of mouse tissue was
performed on free-floating sections as previously described
[23,43]. Antigen retrieval was performed depending on the
used primary antibody by steaming the sections for
15–20 min in citrate buffer (pH 5 6.0, Sigma). The
following primary antibodies were used:
Rabbit anti-DCX (1:300, Cell Signaling), normal rabbit
IgG control (prediluted to the concentration of rabbit anti-
DCX c 5 156 mg/mL and finally used at 1:300, Cell
Signaling),
goat
anti–ionized
calcium-binding
adapter
molecule 1 (Iba1) (1:500, Abcam), rat anti-CD45 (1:100,
Millipore), mouse anti-Ab (1:1000, Covance), sheep anti-
TREM2 (1:300, R&D Systems), rat anti-CD68 (1:250, Sero-
tec), rat anti-CD3 (1:100, Bio-Rad), rat anti-CD8 (1:100,
eBioscience), goat anti-PCNA (1:300, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), mouse anti-Nestin (1:300, Abcam), goat anti-Sox2
(1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-PSA-
NCAM (1:2000, Millipore), chicken anti-GFAP (1:2000, Ab-
cam), goat anti-Olig2 (1:300, R&D Systems), mouse anti-
NeuN (1:500, Millipore), rat anti-B220 (1:100, eBioscience),
rat anti-Ly6G (1:100, eBioscience), rat anti-CD169 (1:50,
Bio-Rad), rat anti-CD4 (1:100, eBioscience), and rat anti-
Foxp3 (1:100, eBioscience). For a synuclein staining rat
anti-a-synuclein (1:50, Enzo) antibody was used and anti-
body incubation time was increased for a total of 2 days.
Sections were extensively washed in PBS and incubated
for 3 h at room temperature (RT) in secondary antibodies
all diluted 1:1000. The following secondary antibodies
were used: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa
Fluor 647, donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 568, donkey
anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568, donkey
anti-sheep 488, donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (all In-
vitrogen or Molecular Probes), donkey anti-rat Rhodamine
Red, donkey anti-mouse AF647, donkey anti-goat AF647,
donkey anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 647, donkey anti-rat
AF647 (all Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nucleus counter-
staining
was
performed
with
40,60-diamidino-2-
phenylindole dihydrochloride hydrate (DAPI 1 mg/mL,
1:2000, Sigma). For qualitative amyloid-b plaque staining,
Thioflavin S (1 mg/mL, 1:625, Sigma) was added to the
secondary antibody solution. Mouse tissue sections from
AD brains were additionally treated with 0.2% Sudan
Black (Sigma) in 70% ethanol for 1–2 minutes to reduce
the autofluorescence in tissue from old animals [44]. After
this treatment, the sections were extensively washed in
PBS and mounted onto microscope glass slides (Superfrost
Plus, Thermo Scientific). Brain sections were cover slipped
semi-dry in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Life Tech-
nologies) or Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako).
Human samples were immunohistologically stained as
follows: after antigen retrieval and H2O2 quench, sections
were incubated in a primary antibody for 1 hour at room tem-
perature. The following primary antibody was used: rabbit
anti-DCX (1:3000, Abcam). Visualization was performed us-
ing the Menarini Diagnostics X-Cell DAB kit (MP-
XCPDAB-U100) following the outlined protocol.All washes
were done in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer pH 7.6.
2.6. Microscopy, visualization, and image processing
For qualitative and quantitative microscopic analysis
of mouse tissue, confocal laser scanning microscopy was
M.S. Unger et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia - (2018) 1-16
3
 performed using a LSM 700 and LSM 710 from Zeiss.
Representative images were taken as z-stack image from
the stained sections. Orthogonal projections (maximum in-
tensity) of the images were created and depicted in respec-
tive false colors using Zen 2012 blue edition software. For
3D reconstruction, images were processed at the LSM 710
using the Zen 2011 SP7 (black) software. Images were
generated using the 3D tool with surface representation
function, and each staining was depicted in respective
false colors. Representative images of human DCX-
stained samples were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E600
microscope and the NTS Elements Imaging Software
(version 4.30.01).
2.7. Western blot analysis
For protein analysis, brains from 13-month-old APP-PS1
and littermates (n 5 4/group) were extracted, and the hippo-
campus and cortex were dissected from one hemisphere per
animal. Cortex and hippocampus regions were immediately
frozen on dry ice and stored for further processing at 280�C.
Brain regions were homogenized using an electric homoge-
nizer pestle in 500 mL radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40 [Sigma],
0.25% Na-deoxycholate [Sigma], and 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA), and protease (cOmplete, Roche) and phos-
phatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche). Afterward, lysates
were manually dissociated using surgical needles of 20G
and 27G size (Dispomed) to obtain a homogeneous sample
solution. Samples were thoroughly vortexed, placed on an
orbital shaker at 4�C for 30–60 min, and were then centri-
fuged for 20 min at 14,000 g. Supernatants were collected,
and protein concentrations were calculated using Pierce
BCA Protein Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following man-
ufacturer’s instruction. Total protein (7.5 mg) was denatu-
rated for 5 min at 98�C in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer with sodium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer
and loaded onto a Mini-Protean TGX stain-free precast gel
(Bio-Rad).
After
standard
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted
onto a Mini-Format 0.2 mm nitrocellulose membrane using
the Trans-Blot Turbo System (Bio-Rad) according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. Afterward, the membranes were
washed in TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween) for a total of three
washes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at RT with TBS-T
containing 4% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and incubated
over night at 4�C with following primary antibodies: rabbit
anti-DCX (1:1000, Cell Signaling) and mouse anti-b-actin
(1:2000, Sigma). The next day, membranes were washed
three times 10 min in TBS-T and incubated with following
secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 488 and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1000,
all Molecular Probes). After three times 10 min washes of
TBS-T, fluorescence signals were detected using the Chem-
iDoc Mp Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
ImageJ (1.44p) and the function “Analyze Gel” was used
for quantitative analysis. The protein band of interest and the
loading control were selected from every loaded sample, and
the area under the signal peak was calculated. After manual
background subtraction, the protein band densities were
normalized to b-actin. In addition, the densities of APP-
PS1 lysates were normalized to wild type (WT) lysates
and expressed as relative density to control lysate in %.
2.8. Electron microscopy
For ultrastructure analysis, 13-month-old APP-PS1 mice
and WT controls were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB. Brains were removed,
and 50 mm sagittal sections were cut using a vibratome and
stored in 0.1 M PB with 0.05% sodium azide. Sections with
brain areas of interest were selected and preembedding 3,30-
Diaminobenzidine
immunostaining
was
performed
as
already described [23]. As primary antibody, the rabbit
anti-DCX (1:300, Cell Signaling) antibody was used and
incubated over night at RT. After several washes in PBS, sec-
tions were incubated for 3 h with goat anti-rabbit bio-
tinylated antibody (1:500, Vector). To increase staining
signal, sections were incubated in Vectastain ABC Hrp Kit
(Vector) for 1 h according to manufacturer’s instructions.
After three times 10 min washing in PBS, sections were
transferred to 3,30-Diaminobenzidin using the Peroxidase
Substrate Kit (Vector) following manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Sections were rigorously washed and osmificated by
incubating in 1% OsO4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in
0.1 M PB for 1 h. Following three washes for 10 min in
distilled water, sections were incubated in Uranyl Acetate
Replacement Stain (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for
30 min. Sections were dehydrated by incubation in an
increasing series of ethanol and transferred to propylenoxide
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) before embedding in aral-
dite durcupan (four component resin, Sigma) over night in
aluminum foil cups at RT. On the next day, the slices were
gently transferred to acetate slides (100 micron color laser
printer film, 5 star office), covered with small amounts of
araldite and coated with a second acetate slide and hardened
in an oven at 60�C for 3 days. Regions of interest were cut
out of the embedded sections, followed by removing one
side of the acetate slide and glueing on an araldite durcupan
block with cyanoacrylate adhesive (UHU). This protocol
was performed with small modifications according to the
research group of Jos�
e-Manuel Garcia Verdugo [45,46].
After removing the acetate slides and careful trimming of
the samples into a trapezial shape, semithin sections of 1–
1.5 mm were generated using a Reichert Ultracut S ultra-
microtome (Leica). Semithin sections were transferred to
object slides and were stained with 1% Toluidine blue for
orientation. After identification of stained cells, ultrathin
sections of 70 nm were directly cut using a diamond knife
(Diatome). Sections were stretched with chloroform and
subsequently collected with 75 mesh copper grids of 3 mm

s & Dementia - (2018) 1-16

 diameter coated with 0.2% Formvar solution. Grids were
dried and analyzed using a Zeiss Leo 910 electron micro-
scope with an integrated Zeiss 906 TRS USB camera. The
utilized software was ImageSP, version 1.2.4.29 from TRS
& Sys Prog.
2.9. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of
immunohistological data
For qualitative image analysis, amyloid plaques in the
cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus from 10- to 13-
month-old APP-PS1 animals were analyzed. Quantitative
analysis of mean particle size and percentage area of staining
was performed in 13-month-old APP-PS1 and age-matched
WT littermates. For each animal, four fields of view in the
cortex and hippocampus were photographed as z-stack at
40! magnification using a confocal laser scanning micro-
scope (n 5 3/group). Images were analyzed using ImageJ
software (1.44p). For every image, maximum intensity pro-
jections were generated, and the threshold for each represen-
tative staining was manually set. The number of particles
(bigger than 1 mm2) and the particle areas [mm2] were calcu-
lated for each staining using the ImageJ tool “Analyse parti-
cles”. The total tissue area [in mm2] of each image was
calculated, and the % area (area of stained particles/field
of view) was calculated.
Light microscopic analysis of human brain tissue was
done as follows: images were captured at !100 magnifica-
tion, three from each region of interest: dentate gyrus, ento-
rhinal cortex, and the CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus,
using a Zeiss Axio Scope A1 microscope with an Infinity
2 camera attached and using the Infinity 2-1C imaging soft-
ware. Image analysis was performed by Image Pro Analyzer,
version 6.3 software blind to disease state. The area of inter-
est was identified, and positive staining was highlighted.
Measurements for area, per area, and integrated optical den-
sity were taken for statistical analysis. All statistical analyses
were done using GraphPad Prism.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software, version 5-7). Outliers were identified
by Grubb test analysis (https://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/
Grubbs1.cfm). Values between two groups were compared
by the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test with or without
Welch’s correction for normally distributed data. Two-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test was per-
formed for learning curve analysis of the MWM data.
P values of P , .0001 (****) and P , .001 (***) were
considered most significant, P ,.01 (**) highly significant,
and P , .05 (*) significant. Values were expressed as
mean 6 standard deviation or mean 6 standard error of
the mean.
3. Results
3.1. DCX-immunoreactive cells cluster at amyloid-b
plaques in mouse brains and in human AD brain specimen
By analyzing amyloid plaque pathology in the cortex and
hippocampus of 3-, 10-, and 13-month-old APP-PS1 ani-
mals, we recognized the presence of plaque-associated
DCX-immunoreactive cells. These cells appeared with the
onset of amyloid-b plaque deposition. Whereas, 3-months-
old APP-PS1 animals were mostly devoid of amyloid-b pla-
ques, 10- and 13-month-old animals already showed severe
plaque pathology in hippocampal and cortical brain regions
(Fig. 1A and 1B).
Interestingly, we observed increased DCX immunoreac-
tivity clustered at these amyloid deposits (Fig. 1A and 1B).
Three-month-old APP-PS1 animals did barely show any
DCX immunoreactivity outside the neurogenic niches in
cortical or hippocampal brain regions; however, increased
DCX-positive staining was observed in cells surrounding
cortical and hippocampal plaques of 10- and 13-month-old
APP-PS1 animals (Fig. 1A and 1B). To test the specificity
of the DCX antibody, appropriate negative controls were
performed: omitting of primary antibody (Fig. 1C) and stain-
ing with an isotype control antibody (Fig. 1C0) to detect the
level of nonspecific background signal. In addition, we
proved the specificity of the DCX antibody used in this
study, by staining DCX-KO brain tissue. The KO tissue
did not show any staining in the dentate gyrus of the hippo-
campus (Fig. 1C00) or in any other brain region of DCX-KO
animals.
To confirm the DCX protein expression in the APP-PS1
brain, we isolated proteins from the hippocampus and cor-
tex of 13-month-old WT and APP-PS1 animals and per-
formed Western blot analysis. In accordance with the
immunohistochemistry data, the Western blot analysis
showed increased amounts of DCX protein in the cortex
of aged APP-PS1 animals compared with WT (Fig. 1D
and 1E). This difference in DCX protein expression was
not detected in hippocampal lysates, most likely due to
the fact that the adult hippocampus expresses already
high levels of DCX protein and that the further increase
due to plaque-associated elevation of DCX expression
might not be detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1D and
1E). Alternatively, a reduced level of hippocampal neuro-
genesis at this stage might cover the elevation of plaque-
associated DCX protein levels.
Next, we investigated whether the appearance of DCX
cells clustering around amyloid plaques was specific for
the APP-PS1 mouse model or whether this was a more gen-
eral phenomenon related to amyloid plaque pathologies. In
all additional transgenic AD animal models tested at stages
with advanced amyloid pathology, that is, the APP-Lon/Swe
(11 months old) the APP-SDI (12 months old) and the
Tg2576 (18 months old), DCX-immunoreactive cells were
present at sites of amyloid deposits (Fig. 1F). Moreover,

 Fig. 1. Increased DCX immunoreactivity and protein expression at sites of amyloid deposits in brains of transgenic AD animals and human AD specimen:
DCX-immunoreactive cells (red) were detected at sites of amyloid deposits (Thioflavin S, green) in the hippocampus (A) and cortex (B) of transgenic APP-
PS1 animals with advanced plaque pathology. Three-month-old APP-PS1 animals were devoid of amyloid-b plaques and did barely show DCX-
immunoreactive cells outside the neurogenic niche, whereas 10- and 13-month-old animals, with already severe plaque load, showed clustering of DCX-

 the analysis of human AD brain samples revealed increased
DCX staining in hippocampus AD samples with plaques
compared with control samples without any amyloid plaques
(Fig. 1G). Furthermore, DCX staining was prominent in hip-
pocampal brain structures of control samples, that is, clini-
cally nondemented, with a detectable amount of plaque
pathology (Fig. 1G). Semi-quantitative analysis revealed
that the percentage area for DCX staining was significantly
increased in human CA1 hippocampus regions of AD spec-
imen compared with controls (Fig. 1H).
3.3. Two different DCX expressing cell types cluster at
amyloid plaques in brains of APP-PS1 mice
We first hypothesized that the plaque-associated DCX
cells might be of neurogenic origin. Therefore, we stained
for markers of cell proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear
antigen), stem and progenitor cells (Nestin, SOX2, PSA-
NCAM), oligodendrocytes (Olig2), astrocytes (GFAP), and
neurons (NeuN). However, none of these markers (except
proliferating cell nuclear antigen) co-localized with the
plaque-associated
DCX
cells
(data
not
shown,
see
Table 1), suggesting that these cells were not of neurogenic
origin. Surprisingly, however, the DCX-positive staining at
sites of amyloid deposition in APP-PS1 animals highly co-
localized with the microglia marker Iba1 (Fig. 2A). Interest-
ingly, in areas with almost no amyloid deposits, microglia
did barely, if at all, express DCX (Fig. 2A, rectangle). How-
ever, microglia directly located at sites of the amyloid pla-
ques were observed as highly immunoreactive for DCX
(Fig. 2A, arrow) to the extent that all plaque-associated
Iba1 cells were DCX positive. We further observed a second
population of DCX-immunoreactive cells, which did not ex-
press Iba1 and hence represent a non-microglia population
(Fig. 2A, arrowhead). To investigate whether some of these
DCX1 cells could be infiltrating macrophages or other pe-
ripheral immune cells, we performed staining with the
pan-leukocyte marker CD45. Remarkably, all amyloid
plaque–associated DCX1 cells clearly co-localized with
CD45 (Fig. 2B, asterisk). One fraction of these cells co-
localized with Iba1 and showed only very faint expression
for CD45 (see Fig. 2B, asterisk), while the other fraction
lacked the expression of Iba1 but was highly positive for
CD45 (Fig. 2B, arrow). Vice versa, all plaque-associated
CD45-positive cells were DCX positive. These data suggest
the presence of two different DCX-expressing cell popula-
tions, one with a microglia identity and one with a hemato-
poietic origin. In the following, we refer to the cells that lack
Iba1 but show high expression of CD45 as CD4511/
DCX1 population; the Iba1 positive but CD45 faintly ex-
pressing
DCX-immunoreactive
population
is
termed
Iba11/DCX1.
Next, we performed quantitative analysis of DCX, Iba1,
and CD45 expressions in APP-PS1 brain sections. We
analyzed the percentage area (area of stained particles or
field of view) for each respective staining in cortical and hip-
pocampal brain regions of 13-months-old APP-PS1 animals
and compared age-matched WT littermates. We detected
a significant increase in the percentage area for Iba1
and DCX staining in the cortex of APP-PS1 animals
compared with WT littermates (Fig. 3A and 3C). DCX
immunoreactivity in the cortex co-localized with Iba11/
CD451 microglia (Fig 3A, insert). Analysis of the hippo-
campus revealed a significant increase in percentage area
of DCX staining (Fig. 3B and 3D). Furthermore, strong
CD4511 cells, negative for Iba1, were detected in the brain
parenchyma as being highly positive for DCX (Fig. 3B,
asterisk).
To analyze the DCX expression at sites of amyloid de-
posits in more detail, we analyzed the ultrastructure of
cortical and hippocampal brain regions from APP-PS1 ani-
mals using immunoelectron microscopy. DCX immunoreac-
tivity was detected at the inner side of the cell membranes in
processes of microglia that were located at sites of amyloid
plaques (Fig. 2C, red arrow). A second population of cells
with very strong DCX staining, but a different morphology
was detected (Fig. 2D). In this population, DCX staining
was localized within the cytoplasm and at the cortical
actin-rich cytoskeleton of these small cells with a round-
shaped nucleus and pseudopod-like structures (Fig. 2D,
red arrow). These cells were identified by their morphology
and CD45 expression (Fig. 2B) as leukocytes.
To summarize, we demonstrated an increased expression
of DCX in brains of AD mouse models with already
advanced plaque pathology and documented the occurrence
of DCX-immunoreactive cells at sites of amyloid-b plaques.
These cells were identified as Iba11 microglia and
CD451 cells with hematopoietic origin. Ultrastructure anal-
ysis revealed intracellular DCX expression in microglia
located at sites of amyloid deposition and in cells with
leukocyte-like morphology.
3.4. DCX-immunoreactive cells at sites of amyloid-
plaques are positive for markers of phagocytosis and
contain engulfed plaque material in APP-PS1 mice
Because DCX-immunoreactive cells were observed very
close to the amyloid deposits and co-localized with the mi-
croglia marker Iba1, we investigated whether DCX might
be involved in amyloid plaque clearance. Therefore, we
stained for various markers known to be involved in phagocy-
tosis such as the triggering receptor 2 expressed on myeloid
cells (TREM2) and the lysosomal marker CD68. Indeed,
strong co-localization of DCX with TREM2-positive cells
plot with mean). In A, B, C, C0, C00, F, DAPI was used as nucleus stain. Unpaired Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction was performed (H, control n 5 7, AD

 at sites of amyloid-b staining was detected (Fig. 4A). Also,
we observed co-localization of DCX with CD68-positive mi-
croglia (Fig. 4B). In addition to the described co-localization
of DCX with this phagocytosis-related marker, DCX-
immunoreactive cells contained Thioflavin S-positive mate-
rial in their cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). Moreover, high resolution
images revealed that the DCX-positive cell cytoplasm
reached toward the amyloid plaque deposits (Fig. 4D). These
data strongly suggest that plaque-associated DCX cells
participate in phagocytosing plaque material.
3.5. Plaque-associated CD4511/
DCX1 immunoreactive cells are CD31/CD81 T-cells
We further tried to identify the CD4511 hematopoietic
DCX-immunoreactive cell population in the APP-PS1
mouse brain in more detail by using various markers of the
hematopoietic cell lineage (for details see Table 1). The
CD4511/DCX1 cell population in the brain of APP-PS1
did not co-localize with markers of B-cells, granulocytes,
or monocytes (data not shown). However, we found DCX-
immunoreactive CD31 T-cells in the brains of APP-PS1 an-
imals (Fig. 5A). Those T-cells were randomly distributed in
the brains, some were associated with vessels, but some were
directly located at sites of amyloid deposition. Because reg-
ulatory T-cells (Foxp31) and CD41 T-cells were described
to enter mouse brains with massive neurodegeneration and
brains of AD animal models [13,47], we tested for CD4
and
Foxp3
expression
in
the
DCX1/CD31
T-cell
population. None of these markers were expressed by the
CD4511/DCX 1 cell population. However, the majority
of DCX-immunoreactive cells were positive for the T-cell
marker CD8 (Fig. 5B, insert). Confocal imaging and 3D sur-
face representation of high magnification images revealed
that many of these DCX-immunoreactive CD81 cells
were closely attached to DCX1/Iba11 microglia (Fig. 5C).
In summary, we detected DCX-immunoreactive cells
at sites of amyloid-deposition in APP-PS1 animals. We
identified two subpopulations of these cells: one population
represents an Iba11 microglia population immunoreactive
for DCX, expressing markers for phagocytosis and with
incorporated amyloid deposits. A further subpopulation of
DCX-immunoreactive cells was positive for the T-cell
marker CD3 and was characterized as a CD8-positive
T-cell population most likely entering the brain and highly
interacting with microglia.
4. Discussion
We employed a broadly used mouse model for AD, the
APP-PS1 mouse model, which is well described to develop
a variety of human hallmarks for AD pathology. The APP-
PS1 mouse model starts to form amyloid-plaque deposits
from 3–4 months of age [23,48–50] and along disease
progression, it develops reactive astrogliosis [51], microglio-
sis or microglia activation [52,53], synaptic loss [54],
changes in synaptic long-term potentiation [55], and even
modest neuronal loss adjacent to plaques [56]. These changes
in brain structure and function lead to a decline in cognitive
performance of these mice, tested in several cognitive
behavior tasks [55,57]. Indeed, we confirmed impaired

NOTE. Detailed IHC characterization was performed using markers for cell proliferation, stem and progenitor cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons,
microglia, phagocytosis, and of the hematopoietic cell lineage. DCX-immunoreactive cells at sites of plaques were negative for markers of neural stem- and
progenitor cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or mature neurons. Most interestingly, DCX immunoreactivity colocalized with markers for cell proliferation
(PCNA), microglia (Iba1), phagocytosis (TREM2, CD68), and with markers for the hematopoietic cell lineage (CD45, CD3, and CD8).

(Supplementary Fig. 1). Animals were trained to find a
water-submerged platform over a time period of 5 days,
and the total distance the animals traveled to find the platform

(Supplementary Fig. 1A and 1B). Spatial memory analysis
after removal of the platform on day 6 revealed decreased
memory functions in APP-PS1 animals compared with
age-matched controls (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Neverthe-
less, the APP-PS1 mouse has its limitations as a model for
AD. Obviously, spatial learning and memory is only one of
the plethoras of cognitive dysfunctions AD patients are
suffering from, and therefore, data derived from experiments
with APP-PS1 animals should not be overinterpreted. Also,
APP-PS1 mice do not develop NFTs by hyperphosphoryla-
tion of the tau protein, which is observed in the brains of
many AD patients [37]. Finally, the APP-PS1 model repre-
sents one of the genetic and familial forms of AD and not
the much more frequent sporadic forms.

colocalized with the microglia marker Iba1 (A). Microglia close to the amyloid plaques showed DCX expression (arrow), whereas microglia in areas with
no amyloid deposition were barely positive for DCX (rectangle in A). Furthermore, a subpopulation of DCX-immunoreactive cells lacking the expression
of Iba1 was detected (A, triangle). Using the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 for further characterization of the DCX-immunoreactive population revealed two
distinct DCX cell types at sites of amyloid deposition: a DCX1/Iba11/CD451 microglia (asterisk) and a DCX1/Iba12/CD4511 population (B, arrow).

electrodense laminar bodies, showed intracellular DCX expression in their processes and in the cytoplasm along their inner cell membrane (C, red arrows). In
addition, strong polarized DCX expression lining the inner cell membrane was observed in leukocyte-like cells of round shape, with pseudopod-like processes

 Here, we identify and characterize DCX-immunoreactive
cells outside the neurogenic niches at sites of amyloid depo-
sition in the brains of transgenic amyloid-plaque mouse
models
and
in
human
AD
specimen.
The
plaque-
associated DCX cells were of nonneurogenic origin, as
they lacked the expression of stem or progenitor cell markers
and those of neuronal and glial cells (see Table 1). This
is essential knowledge, as DCX is generally used as a
marker for young immature neurons and for neurogenesis
[21,22]. Thus, elevated DCX expression in brains with
neurodegeneration outside of the neurogenic niches could
easily be misinterpreted as enhanced neurogenesis. There
were no obvious signs of potential migration of these cells
from the neurogenic niches, instead they were highly
proliferative (data not shown) and clustered at plaques in
the transgenic animal models. This may lead to the
assumption that at least some of these cells were generated
locally. The plaque-associated DCX1 cells were identified
as immune cells, more specifically as Iba11 microglia and
as CD81 T-cells. These two cell types appeared in close
proximity to each other, suggesting that they might interact
and modulate phagocytic and/or immune activities.
DCX is highly expressed in the developing brain, specif-
ically in migrating or differentiating neurons [58,59]. In
the adult organism, its expression is mainly confined to
neuronal precursor cells and young immature neurons in
the neurogenic niches of the dentate gyrus and of the
subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle [21,22]. There
is very little evidence for DCX expression in the adult
uninjured brain in cells outside the neurogenic regions,
and if it appears then, that DCX expression in such areas
is confined to cells of neurogenic origin. For example, in
the piriform cortex, a pool of neurons with an immature
phenotype retains DCX expression in the adult [60], and it
is thought that such immature DCX neurons might provide
the
brain
circuitry
with
increased
plasticity
[61,62].
Interestingly, cortical DCX expression in nonneurogenic
regions is unaffected by age or by neurogenesis-inhibiting
interventions such as radiation [63].
In animal models of stroke, leptomeningeal cells express
DCX, and these cells might contribute to repair processes
[64]. Also, after stroke, the production of DCX cells in the
subventricular zone is increased, and DCX-positive cells
migrate toward the lesion site [65]. Besides immature neu-
rons, GFAP-positive astroglia have been shown to express
DCX after an ischemic lesion [66]. Furthermore, DCX
expression was described in oligodendrocyte precursor cells
of healthy rodent brains [67]. Taking into account that levels
of adult neurogenesis, that is, levels of DCX 1 neuronal pro-
genitors, correlate with cognitive behavior in rodent animal
models [68], the nonneurogenic DCX protein expression de-
tected along amyloid pathology has to be carefully inter-
preted. At least, up to now, there is no correlation between
nonneurogenic DCX cells in the brain and cognitive out-
comes. Nevertheless, one possible interpretation of this
might be a beneficial process allowing cellular plasticity
and involvement in regeneration rather than being detri-
mental. To address the question whether nonneurogenic
DCX-positive cells are generally present in rodent models
for neurodegenerative diseases, we additionally analyzed
DCX expression in a Lewy body dementia mouse model
with severe a-synucleinopathy in the brain [34]. We did
not observe DCX expression in these transgenic mice other
than in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, and there was no
co-localization with microglia marker (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Therefore, it is more likely that the herein described
nonneurogenic DCX expression is specific for amyloid pa-
thology; however, this would need further investigations.
Nevertheless, if so, this harbors the possibility of the future
use of DCX to stratify AD brains in neuropathology.
The microglia fraction of the plaque-associated DCX
cells co-expressed the microglia markers Iba1, CD68,
and TREM2, suggesting that these cells are phagocytic
cells. Indeed, they showed incorporated amyloid deposits
in their cell soma. Interestingly, non–plaque-associated mi-
croglia as well as microglia in wild type mice did barely
show any DCX immunoreactivity. This might be an expla-
nation for the fact that DCX was so far never described in
microglia of the adult brain. Nevertheless, there is evi-
dence that microglia do express DCX under certain cir-
cumstances. A RNA sequence database on embryonic
and adult-isolated microglia [69] reveals that microglia
during development do express DCX mRNA at consider-
able amounts compared with all genes (Fragments Per
Kilobase Million 46), but they lose DCX expression during
postnatal stages (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/
cgi-bin/geneSearchMariko.py?geneNameIn5DCX).
Also, a transcriptome analysis of amoeboid microglia
versus ramified microglia isolated from the corpus cal-
losum of rat brains revealed expression of DCX in micro-
glia. The DCX gene was within the top 25 highly
expressed genes in amoeboid microglia but was not ex-
pressed in ramified microglia. At the protein level, the
authors demonstrated that amoeboid microglia showed
positive immunoreactivity for DCX [70]. The function
of DCX in developmental or amoeboid microglia is un-
clear, but as DCX is a microtubule-associated protein
involved in neuronal migration [71,72], it might as
well modulate
migration and motility of microglia.
Alternatively, DCX might be involved in intracellular
processes such as phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is a key
function of microglia and involves high motility and
the hippocampus revealed a significantly increased percentage area of DCX staining in APP-PS1 animals compared with WT (D). Furthermore, strongly
CD4511 cells negative for Iba1 were detected in the brain parenchyma being highly positive for DCX (asterisk in B). DAPI was used as nucleus stain. Unpaired

 plasticity of the intracellular cytoskeleton coordinated by
various receptor complexes on the microglia cell surface
[9]. DCX might play an essential role in cytoskeletal reor-
ganization specifically in microglia associated with the
amyloid-b plaques. Regardless of a putative function of
DCX in this process, the morphology and location, as
well as the expression of the phagocytosis markers
TREM2 and CD68, and the presence of amyloid plaque
material in the DCX cells strongly suggests that they
have phagocytic activity and that they contribute to amy-
loid plaque clearance. The role of TREM2 and of
microglia-mediated phagocytosis in AD pathogenesis is
evident, as human genetic studies showed a higher risk
to develop AD with certain TREM2 variants [73]. Besides
TREM2, the co-localization of the DCX cells with CD68
also points toward a critical role in phagocytosis, as CD68
is expressed in lysosomal vesicles [74,75].
The DCX immunoreactivity was not limited to the mi-
croglia cell population at sites of amyloid plaques. We
identified a specific hematopoietic T-cell population pre-
sent in the brain of APP-PS1 animals, which was positive
for DCX. Assuming that these cells infiltrated the brain
from the periphery, we also analyzed peripheral immune
organs, for example, spleen and bone marrow from adult
mice, and surprisingly found high DCX immunoreactivity
in T-cell–rich areas of this tissue (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We used various markers of the hematopoietic cell lineage
to characterize these cells in the brain of APP-PS1 animals
and detected mainly CD81 DCX-immunoreactive T-cells
that were in direct contact with microglia. The existence
of two subpopulations of nonneurogenic DCX1 cells is
fascinating and might be explained by their cellular func-
tion: microglia as already discussed previously have to be
highly motile for phagocytosis, and T-cells have to form
and change their cytoskeleton depending on their activity
status
[76,77].
Both
functions
involve
cytoskeleton
reorganization and might therefore involve the DCX
protein.

T-cells, in the brain and their functional role and interaction

 with brain resident glial cells is currently discussed, and
increased T-cell homing into the healthy aged brain has
been reported [11,12]. Although the increased occurrence
of T-cells in the brains of patients with autoimmune
diseases such as multiple sclerosis is well documented, the
evidence of T-cells in chronic neurodegenerative disease
such as AD is less [78]. The occurrence of T-cells in the brain
was first reported in human AD postmortem brain biopsies in
1988 [79]. Elevated numbers of T-cells in the brains of am-
yloid plaque mouse models has further been documented in
several transgenic AD mouse models [13]. This, of course,
raises the question whether T-cells might have a modulatory
activity, ameliorating or worsening AD pathology [14].
Whereas, studies on regulatory T-cells (Tregs) report on a
beneficial function of T-cells by slowing down disease pro-
gression and modulating microglia responses to amyloid-b
deposits [80], others report about detrimental effects of
Tregs in AD. For example, while in one study, depletion or
inhibition of Tregs reversed the cognitive deficits in an AD
animal model [47], the genetic ablation of T-, B-, and natural
killer cells in a 5XFAD AD mouse model (Rag-5xfAD)
revealed a twofold increase in amyloid-b plaque pathology
and exacerbated
neuroinflammation. Conversely, bone
marrow transplantation in these mice again reduced AD pa-
thology [81].
We summarized our findings in a hypothesis model for
T-cell microglia interaction in amyloid plaque-diseased
brains (Fig. 6). It will be essential to uncover the functional
role of the different T-cell subpopulations in the brain along
AD pathology. In particular, research on these cells and
their interactions with central nervous system resident cells
such as microglia, neurons, and others might identify new
therapeutic targets in future. So far, the functional charac-
terization of these cells is very limited, and their

marker CD3. Most interestingly, in the brain, no colocalization with Foxp3 or CD4 was detected (data not shown). (B) The majority of T-cells did express CD8
and were therefore identified as natural killer T-cells present in the brain parenchyma of APP-PS1 animals. These DCX1/CD81 T-cells were often located very
closely to microglia suggesting a strong interaction of these two cell populations (B, insert). High magnification images and 3D surface representation showed
detailed DCX colocalization with CD8 and Iba1-positive cells (C). DAPI was used as nucleus stain. Scale: 50 mm (A, B), 10 mm (C). Abbreviations: DCX,

 interactions with the brains resident glial cells are not fully
understood. We confirmed our main findings in several
other amyloid plaque models and even in human AD brains
or brains with plaque pathology, considering our finding
relevant for the broad AD field.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: The authors reviewed the litera-
ture using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources and
meeting abstracts and presentations. Doublecortin
positive cells have been analyzed in AD and in amy-
loid plaque models of AD, however, always in the
context of neurogenic niches. These relevant cita-
tions are appropriately cited.
2. Interpretation: Our findings led to an integrated hy-
pothesis describing two populations of doublecortin
expressing cells associated with plaques, that is, mi-
croglia and CD8 T-cells.
3. Future directions: Need to investigate the role of the
two cell population in plaque pathology.

DCX1 microglia and DCX1/CD81 T-cells associated to amyloid plaques.
With increased amyloid plaque deposition activated microglia cluster at
sites of the amyloid plaques and express the microtubule-associated protein
DCX (Iba11/DCX1, light green). Via blood vessels (orange) DCX1
T-cells (red) were observed to infiltrate the brain parenchyma and closely
attached with brain resident microglia, presumably modulating immune
cell functions. Abbreviation: DCX, doublecortin.
