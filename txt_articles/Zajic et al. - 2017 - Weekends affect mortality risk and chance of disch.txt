Abstract
Background: In this study, we primarily investigated whether ICU admission or ICU stay at weekends (Saturday and
Sunday) is associated with a different risk of ICU mortality or chance of ICU discharge than ICU admission or ICU
stay on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Secondarily, we analysed whether weekend ICU admission or ICU stay
influences risk of hospital mortality or chance of hospital discharge.
Methods: A retrospective study was performed for all adult patients admitted to 119 ICUs participating in the
benchmarking project of the Austrian Centre for Documentation and Quality Assurance in Intensive Care (ASDI)
between 2012 and 2015. Readmissions to the ICU during the same hospital stay were excluded.
Results: In a multivariable competing risk analysis, a strong weekend effect was observed. Patients admitted to
ICUs on Saturday or Sunday had a higher mortality risk after adjustment for severity of illness by Simplified Acute
Physiology Score (SAPS) 3, year, month of the year, type of admission, ICU, and weekday of death or discharge.
Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for death in the ICU following admission on a Saturday or Sunday
compared with Wednesday were 1.15 (1.08–1.23) and 1.11 (1.03–1.18), respectively. Lower hazard ratios were
observed for dying on a Saturday (0.93 (0.87–1.00)) or Sunday (0.85 (0.80–0.91)) compared with Wednesday. This
is probably related to the reduced chance of being discharged from the ICU at the weekend (0.63 (0.62–064) for
Saturday and 0.56 (0.55–0.57) for Sunday). Similar results were found for hospital mortality and hospital discharge
following ICU admission.
Conclusions: Patients admitted to ICUs at weekends are at increased risk of death in both the ICU and the
hospital even after rigorous adjustment for severity of illness. Conversely, death in the ICU and discharge from
the ICU are significantly less likely at weekends.

 Background
Results from recent studies suggesting that increased
mortality is associated with weekend admission to Na-
tional Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the United
Kingdom—the so-called “weekend effect”—have prompted
intensive discussions in both the scientific community and
the public [1–3]. In studies like these, adjustment for sever-
ity of illness is paramount, since the case mix may differ
substantially between weekends and weekdays [4]. This ad-
justment is of utmost importance in critically ill patients,
which may explain why a recent study, focused on patients
in intensive care units (ICUs) in the NHS, found no dis-
cernible weekend effects following emergency admission to
the ICU [5].
Because there is no generally agreed-on methodo-
logical approach, the existing body of evidence is incon-
sistent. While increased risk of death following weekend
ICU admission has been found in some studies [6–8],
other studies have failed to demonstrate any weekend ef-
fects [9–13] following adjustment for severity of illness.
Yet a meta-analysis based on data available in 2010 has
concluded that weekend ICU admissions are associated
with increased risk of death [14]. As the available evi-
dence is conflicting and confounded by several factors,
additional high-quality data are required to address the
question of whether there are “weekend effects” in ICU
patients. Furthermore, it needs to be clarified whether
these supposed effects affect mortality risk only, and
whether the admission day represents the only influen-
cing factor.
To specifically assess the impact of intensive care upon
patient outcomes, it is prudent to focus on ICU mortality
following adjustment for baseline risk of death and type of
admission as the primary variable of interest. Death in the
ICU may obviously be preceded by discharge or transfer
from the ICU at any given time point. In this setting, com-
peting risk analysis may be the methodological approach
of choice [15]. In this study, we therefore primarily investi-
gate whether ICU admission or ICU stay at weekends
(Saturday and Sunday) is associated with a different risk of
ICU mortality or chance of ICU discharge than ICU ad-
mission or ICU stay on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Sec-
ondarily, we analyse whether weekend ICU admission or
ICU stay influences the risk of hospital mortality or
chance of hospital discharge.
Methods
The Austrian Centre for Documentation and Quality
Assurance in Intensive Care (ASDI) is a non-profit or-
ganisation which has established a multicentre database
containing anonymised data on patients admitted to
ICUs in Austria (Additional file 1: Table S1). The data set
is described in detail elsewhere [16]. The prospectively col-
lected data include: sociodemographic data, such as age,
sex, and chronic conditions; reason for admission, re-
corded according to a predefined list of medical and
surgical diagnoses [17]; severity of illness, as measured
by either the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)
II (used until 2011) [18] or the SAPS 3 (used since
2012) [19, 20]; level of provided care, as measured by
the Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System
(TISS-28) [21]; length of ICU and hospital stay; and
outcome data, including survival status at ICU and hos-
pital discharge. Since no additional interventions were
performed, the need for informed consent was waived
by the institutional review board.
Statistical analysis
The main analysis was conducted using the Fine and
Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model [22].
Competing events of interest were ICU mortality and
ICU discharge within 30 days. Patients staying in the
ICU for more than 30 days were censored, because 30-
day mortality is a widely accepted outcome measure, the
model is likely to fit better when applied over a limited
time interval only, and previous studies on the same
topic did so [1]. Sensitivity analyses without censoring
after 30 days were performed. All analyses were conducted
according to Beyersmann et al. [23] with R version 3.3.1
and the package survival version 2.39-4.
The following variables were used as risk factors for
modelling death in the ICU or ICU discharge: weekday
of admission, weekday of event (death or discharge),
SAPS 3, year of admission, month of admission, type of
admission as outlined in the SAPS 3 [19], and centre
(ICUs as fixed effects). The weekday of death or discharge
was modelled by a time-dependent covariate. Wednesday
was chosen as the reference day. The survConcordance
function [24] was used to evaluate the calibration of
the model. Additionally, we assessed the impact of the
inclusion of twofold interactions between the variables
admission day, type of admission, and SAPS 3 as well
as the reasons for admission. Proportionality of hazards
was investigated using an interaction term between week-
day of admission and time to assess a possible influence of
weekday of admission on early or late mortality.
Secondary analysis consisted of investigating possible
weekend effects on hospital mortality and hospital dis-
charge following ICU admission. The model was built
upon the variables already described.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the
magnitude of possible weekend effects in the following
subgroups: patients admitted to ICUs that reported
more than 99% of hospital outcomes; only readmissions
during the same hospital stay; and patients in the first,
second, or third tertile of the SAPS 3. The main ana-
lysis was repeated by fitting Cox proportional hazards
models for the cause-specific hazards in the competing

 risk setting on the same sets of data, based on different
risk sets of patients.
Data are generally presented as median and interquartile
ranges (IQR) or absolute number (n) and percentage (%)
unless specified otherwise.
Results
All patients admitted to 119 participating ICUs between
1 January 2012 and 31 December 2015 (n = 167,425)
were included in the study. This time period was chosen
because the risk adjustment system was changed from
SAPS II to SAPS 3 at the beginning of 2012. We consid-
ered the use of multiple risk adjustment systems to be
inadequate for this study.
Patients < 18 years of age (n = 1762) or with missing age
data (n = 31) were excluded from the analysis. For patients
who were admitted more than once (n = 14,297), only
the first admission was included. Patients without doc-
umented ICU admission or discharge dates or outcome
(n = 67) were excluded. A total of 151,268 patients were
available for the main analysis. For the secondary ana-
lysis, patients with missing hospital outcome (n = 1584)
or missing discharge dates from the hospital (n = 2287)
were also excluded, leaving 147,397 patients.
A total of 25,838 (17.1%) patients were referred to an
ICU on Saturday or Sunday. In total, 86,564 (57.2%) pa-
tients were male and the median (IQR) age was 68 (54–77)
years. Neither age nor the male/female distribution varied
noticeably between days of the week (Table 1).
Severity of illness and reasons for admission varied no-
ticeably between weekends and weekdays. Median (IQR)
SAPS 3 was 44 (34–56); the lowest values were found
from Tuesday to Thursday (42 (33–54)), and the highest
on Saturday and Sunday (48 (37–61)). Overall, the docu-
mented type of admission to the ICU was “medical” in
36.6% of patients and “scheduled surgery” in 32.6%. On
Saturdays and Sundays, however, 50.3% and 51.7% of pa-
tients were documented as a “medical” type of admis-
sion, respectively. Conversely, “scheduled surgery” was
recorded as the type of admission in only 10.0% and
9.9% of patients on Saturdays and Sundays, respectively.
A total of 13,887 (9.2%) patients died in the ICU, and
137,381 (90.8%) were discharged. Overall, 20,537 (13.7%)
hospital deaths and 129,147 hospital discharges were ob-
served. Both unadjusted hospital and ICU mortality differed
between weekdays and weekends. Eight per cent of patients
admitted on a Wednesday died in the ICU, while 13.1% of
patients admitted on Saturdays and 13.4% of patients ad-
mitted on Sundays died in the ICU. A total 12.4% of pa-
tients admitted to the ICU on Wednesday died in hospital;
18.5% of patients admitted to the ICU on Saturdays
and 19.4% of patients admitted on Sundays died during
their hospital stay. The observed-to-expected (O/E, (95%
CI)) ratio for hospital mortality was 0.71 (0.69–0.73) on
Wednesdays compared with 0.78 (0.75–0.80) on Saturdays
and 0.79 (0.77–0.82) on Sundays. Table 1 presents detailed
patient demographics and outcome data. Additional file 1:
Table S2 describes reasons for admission in depth.
Patients admitted to the ICU at weekends had higher
summative TISS-28 scores than patients admitted during
the week, yet there was no discernible difference in these
scores between individual days of admission (Table 1).
There was significant variation in the frequencies of
several key procedures, however, such as placement of
peripheral arterial lines and central venous catheters
(Additional file 1: Table S3).
Main analysis
Findings from the descriptive analysis regarding mortal-
ity were confirmed in multivariable competing risk ana-
lysis concerning the outcomes “death in the ICU” and
“discharge from the ICU” within 30 days (Fig. 1).
The weekday of admission exerted a significant in-
fluence on the risk of death in the ICU. Adjusted sub-
distribution HRs (95% CI) for ICU mortality were 1.15
(1.08–1.23) and 1.11 (1.03–1.18), respectively, for pa-
tients admitted to an ICU on Saturday or Sunday as
compared with Wednesday (Fig. 1). Chance (hazard)
of ICU discharge also varied with the day of ICU ad-
mission: patients admitted on Fridays had the highest
chance of discharge (HR 1.07 (95% CI 1.04–1.09)),
whereas adjusted HRs for ICU discharge were signifi-
cantly lower when admission was on Sunday, Monday,
or Tuesday as compared with Wednesday (Fig. 1).
Conversely, the risk of dying in the ICU during week-
ends was significantly reduced; HRs (95% CI) for death in
the ICU on Saturdays and Sundays were 0.93 (0.87–1.00)
and 0.85 (0.80–0.91), respectively, as compared with
Wednesday (Fig. 1). Chances of ICU discharge during
weekends were also significantly lower compared with
weekdays; HRs (95% CI) for discharge from the ICU were
0.63 (0.62–0.64) on Saturdays and 0.56 (0.55–0.57) on
Sundays.
Risk of death in the ICU varied greatly between types
of admission. Patients admitted to the ICU in the group
“scheduled surgery” were at the lowest risk of ICU death
(HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.39–0.46)) compared with the ref-
erence group of “medical” admission. Admission for
“unscheduled surgery” was also associated with lower
risk (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.72–0.79)). A highly significant
association between the SAPS 3 and mortality risk was
observed (HR 1.91 (95% CI 1.89–1.93) per 10 SAPS 3
points).
The chosen explanatory variables allowed for good
prediction (C-index = 0.863). Neither the inclusion of a
quadratic term for SAPS 3 into the model nor the omis-
sion of the ICU as a fixed effect changed the results in a
noticeable way. We added the time-dependent covariable

 “weekday of admission × time” to the model to check the
proportional hazards assumption. This influence variable
did not contribute significantly.
After the inclusion of interaction terms into the main
model, HRs (95% CI) for death in the ICU were elevated:
1.21 (1.07–1.36) for admission on Saturday and 1.18
(1.05–1.34) for admission on Sunday (Additional file 1:
Table S4). In this extended model, a noticeable interaction
was identified. Weekend admissions of patients with the
type of admission “scheduled surgery” were associated
with increased hazards for death in the ICU compared
with admissions on Wednesdays. HRs (95% CI) for the
interaction between the type of admission “scheduled sur-
gery” and the weekday of admission were 1.56 (1.14–2.14)
for admission on Saturday and 1.45 (1.03–2.04) for admis-
sion on Sunday (Additional file 1: Table S2).
Secondary analysis
Results for hospital mortality and hospital discharge
(Fine and Gray model) were practically identical to the
aforementioned findings. Adjusted HRs (95% CI) for
hospital mortality were 1.15 (1.08–1.23) for ICU admis-
sion on Saturday and 1.11 (1.03–1.18) for ICU admission
on Sunday. ICU admission on Sunday or Monday was
associated with the lowest chances of hospital discharge.
Risk of in-hospital death and chance of hospital discharge
at weekends were also significantly lower than during the
week (Additional file 1: Table S5).
Sensitivity analyses
Findings in subgroup analyses confirmed our results’ stabil-
ity. Weekend effects were almost identical in patients admit-
ted to ICUs that reported more than 99% of hospital
outcomes (n = 113,161) (Additional file 1: Table S6). Week-
end effects were reproduced in all three tertiles of the SAPS
3 (Additional file 1: Table S7). The effects were present in
all admission-type subgroups except for unscheduled sur-
gery (Additional file 1: Table S9). When the Cox propor-
tional hazards model was applied to the main analysis,
significant weekend effects were found, although they were
slightly less pronounced; concordance was 0.846 (Additional
file 1: Table S10). Results from the model without censoring
at 30 days did not differ significantly from the main model's
results. (Additional file Additional file 1: Table S11)
The inclusion of interaction terms of weekday of ad-
mission and time did not indicate any noticeable time
dependency of the effect on mortality apart from a slight
tendency for higher short-term mortality when admitted

 on Saturday (p = 0.03). An accentuated tendency towards
earlier discharge when admitted on Friday or Saturday
was observed (data not shown).
Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that there are weekend effects
in Austrian ICUs. Admission to an ICU on Saturday or
Sunday was associated with both increased risk of ICU
and hospital mortality and a reduced chance of ICU
and hospital discharge. These findings were stable in all
models, although we applied rigorous risk adjustment
using the well-established SAPS 3 risk adjustment model
[19, 20, 25]. Adjustment for baseline risk of death was im-
perative [26], as the case mix admitted to ICUs on week-
ends differs noticeably from admissions during the week.
These weekend effects, however, did not result in an
increased risk of dying in the ICU during weekends.
Mortality rates in ICUs and hospitals were actually lower
on Saturdays and Sundays. Moreover, discharge from the
ICU and the hospital was substantially less likely at
weekends than during the week. The competing risk
analysis itself offers a possible explanation for these find-
ings. Because of the low chance of discharge at weekends,
patients tended to remain in the ICU over the weekend
regardless of their physiologic status. This would result
in a lower risk of death at weekends.
The statistical validity of the models used can be inferred
from the good results in prediction and the fairly identical
results in the Fine and Gray model for subdistribution haz-
ards and the well-established Cox proportional hazards
model fitted for competing risks. A major strength of this
study lies in the statistical analysis based on the competing
risks concept, which models transitions in patient status (in
ICU, discharged, dead). The observed concordance coeffi-
cient for the main analysis is satisfactory in heterogeneous
populations such as the critically ill [27, 28].
The clinical validity of our findings relies on the SAPS
3 risk adjustment tool’s ability to adequately correct for
patients’ individual risk of death. If characteristics nega-
tively influencing outcomes were more prevalent in pa-
tients admitted at weekends and remained unadjusted for,
an increased risk of death could falsely be associated with
weekend admission instead of the patients’ characteristics.
For this reason, we conducted detailed sensitivity analyses
to assess both statistical and clinical validity.
We stratified the study cohort by tertiles of the SAPS
3 to evaluate whether the effects observed targeted specific
subpopulations only. Similar effects were found, however,
in all three tertiles (Additional file 1: Table S5). We can
thus rule out the possibility that our results are attributable
to high or low acuity bias. Additional sensitivity analyses
included only patients admitted to ICUs with excellent
reporting characteristics (more than 99% of all patients
included in the study cohort) to minimise the risk of
reporting bias (see Limitations). Weekend effects were
the same in this subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S4).
Weekend effects were observed when we analysed
readmissions to the ICU during the same hospital stay
(Additional file 1: Table S8). The results’ reliability is
backed by their consistency over various subgroups of
patients. The completeness of reporting in the partici-
pating ICUs is another strength of our study and is due
to Austrian healthcare legislation that requires report-
ing of key items for all admitted patients before ICU
costs are reimbursed.
Patients referred to ICUs at weekends were more likely
to be admitted after emergency surgery and exhibited a
higher severity of illness as measured by the SAPS 3. In-
creased risk of death after weekend ICU admission was
not observed in patients admitted after unscheduled sur-
gical procedures, whereas weekend effects were clearly
identifiable in both subgroups of patients admitted to
ICU after scheduled surgery or due to medical conditions.
These findings are in concordance with previous findings
from other studies that unscheduled surgery outside
regular working hours is not associated with increased
mortality [29–31].
In fact, scheduled surgeries are rare on weekends com-
pared with weekdays. A higher risk of death following
weekend procedures could therefore be due to a lack of
experienced staff [32, 33] or insufficient resources. It could
be speculated that the quality of necessary interventions
provided for critically ill patients outside the ICU might
influence overall outcome, affecting some patients more
than others. Previous studies have demonstrated dif-
ferences in outcomes following critical procedures; for
example, in patients with acute myocardial infarction
and stroke [34, 35].
If the higher risk of death following weekend ICU
admission cannot be explained by case mix alone, the
reasons for this effect need to be identified. Because of the
complexity of providing critical care and the retrospective
nature of this study, we are unable to give detailed an-
swers. Possible explanations for worse outcomes in pa-
tients admitted to ICUs at weekends involve both
structures and processes, such as inadequate staffing or
increased workload. While high workloads on weekends
were demonstrated in other studies [36], we have no direct
data about physicians’ workload or ICU staffing during the
observation period. The TISS-28 allows us, however, to
evaluate nursing workload and the use of different sets of
interventions and other measures.
Analysing these data, we found that, for all patients in
the ICU, fewer “specific interventions” (according to the
TISS-28) were performed on Saturdays and Sundays
compared with the rest of the week (Additional file 1:
Table S3). For patients admitted at weekends, however,
“specific interventions” were performed at a higher rate
Zajic et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:223 
Page 6 of 8
 both in and outside the ICU. These findings seem
plausible, taking into account the higher severity of illness
exhibited by patients admitted to ICUs on weekends.
However, patients admitted to the ICU at weekends were
surprisingly less likely to receive several key treatments on
the day of admission, such as “central venous catheters”,
“peripheral arterial lines”, and “lung function-improving
treatments”.
Limitations
This study’s findings are based on a retrospective ana-
lysis of data queried from a prospectively gathered data-
base using a multivariable competing risk model for
time-until-event data. The study is therefore subject to
all limitations that apply to this study type. Documenta-
tion and coding are the responsibility of individual
health care providers and may be incomplete, especially
if data input is not required by law or local policy.
Non-ICU data and information on decision-making
(e.g. termination of care) may be fragmentary, since
they are not in the focus of the ASDI database. Quality
of documentation may vary between days of the week
due to differences in workload [37]. Patient heterogen-
eity and variations in case mix between weekdays may
contribute to bias affecting the analysis. We sought to
adjust for these limitations as described, yet our adjust-

Conclusion
In summary, our study yielded several key findings. First,
the case mix that healthcare professionals were con-
fronted with at weekends was distinctly different from
that seen during the week. Patients referred to the ICU
at weekends were sicker than those admitted during the
week, whilst those already present in the ICU would
otherwise be discharged earlier. Second, ICU admission
at weekends is associated with a higher risk of death in
the ICU and the hospital in the subgroups of scheduled
surgery and medical admissions. This effect is not ob-
served in patients undergoing emergency surgery, a
primary purpose of hospitals at weekends. Third, the
intensive care provided at weekends differs noticeably
from that during the rest of the week in our dataset.
This could be a potential source of the observed
higher risk of death.
These findings should generate further research and
critical evaluation of the process of providing critical
care at weekends. If weekend effects were to be repro-
duced prospectively in comparable populations, health
care providers and policy-makers alike would be obliged
to take action to remove any obstacles that prevent the
same quality of care being provided during the week
and at weekends. Equipment, expertise, and staff need
to be available in the same quantity and quality on
every day of the week, especially if plannable, high-risk
procedures (i.e. scheduled operations) are to be performed
at weekends.
