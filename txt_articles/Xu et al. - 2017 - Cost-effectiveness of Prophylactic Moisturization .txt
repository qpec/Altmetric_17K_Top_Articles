IMPORTANCE Emerging evidence suggests that the use of moisturizers on newborns and
infants (ie, from birth to 6 months of age) is potentially helpful in preventing the
development of atopic dermatitis.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the cost-effectiveness of using a daily moisturizer as prevention
against atopic dermatitis among high-risk newborns.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a cost-effectiveness analysis, the average cost of
total-body moisturization using 7 common moisturizers from birth to 6 months of age was
determined for male and female infants. We assumed the same unit of weight per moisturizer
used for a given body surface area. Based on previously reported data (relative risk reduction
of 50%), the incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was determined using
a 6-month time window. The cost-effectiveness of each moisturizer was determined by
assuming equal efficacy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the relative risk from
0.28 to 0.90.
INTERVENTIONS Use of prophylactic moisturizing compounds.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the incremental
cost-effectiveness values ($/QALY) for each moisturizer in preventing atopic dermatitis
during a 6-month time window.
RESULTS The calculated amount of daily all-body moisturizer needed at birth was 3.6 g
(0.12 oz) per application, which increased to 6.6 g (0.22 oz) at 6 months of age. Of the
7 products evaluated, the average price was $1.07/oz (range, $0.13/oz-$2.96/oz). For a
6-month time window, the average incremental QALY benefit was 0.021. The sensitivity
analysis showed that the incremental gain of QALY ranged from 0.0041 to 0.030. Petrolatum
was the most cost-effective ($353/QALY [95% CI, $244-$1769/QALY) moisturizer in the
cohort. Even assuming the lowest incremental QALYs for the most expensive moisturizer,
the intervention was still less than $45 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall, atopic dermatitis represents a major health
expenditure and has been associated with multiple comorbidities. Daily moisturization may
represent a cost-effective, preventative strategy to reduce the burden of atopic dermatitis.

A
topic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflam-
matory skin condition worldwide with a prevalence
ranging from 8.7% to 18.1% for children 17 years of age
or younger.1 Almost half of affected individuals first develop
atopic dermatitis during the first year of life, and the majority
during the first 5 years of life.2 The atopic march, the propen-
sity for asthma and other allergic disorders to develop after the
onsetofatopicdermatitis,occursinapproximatelyhalfofthese
pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis.3 Both lesional skin
and nonlesional skin in atopic dermatitis have a defective bar-
rier, as measured by transepidermal water loss. Abnormali-
ties in transepidermal water loss at 2 days of age are predic-
tive of the development of clinical atopic dermatitis,
particularly when mutations in filaggrin, a critical protein in
skin barrier function, are found. Loss-of-function mutations

dermatitis, food allergies, and asthma.4 In 30% of children, cy-
tokines known to be increased in atopic dermatitis downregu-
latetheexpressionoffilaggrinitself.5,6Emergingevidencesug-
geststhatearlypediatricatopicdermatitisexhibitsaphenotype
distinct from adult atopic dermatitis, supporting the benefit
of early intervention.7
Recent attention has been directed toward the preven-
tion of atopic dermatitis and atopic disease. Early studies have
suggested that full-body application of moisturizers for 6 to 8
months, beginning within the first few weeks of life in high-
risk infants (defined as a first-degree relative with atopic der-
matitis), reduced the cumulative incidence of atopic derma-
titis in a British/US cohort (relative risk, 50%) and a Japanese
cohort (relative risk, 25%).8,9 In this study, we assess the po-
tentialcost-effectivenessofprophylacticmoisturizationinpre-
venting atopic dermatitis in high-risk newborns.
Methods
Because this study did not involve human participants, it was
exempt from review by the Northwestern University institu-
tional review board. Age-specific body surface area was cal-
culated using the Mosteller formula10 and the 50th percentile
heights and weights (World Health Organization growth charts
for boys and girls) at 0 and 6 months of age.11 Given that 30 g
oftopicalmoisturizercoversanadultwithanaveragebodysur-
face area of 1.73 m2, the ratio of moisturizer per meters squared
wasdeterminedtobe17g/m2.Weaveragedthecostoftheprod-
ucts at 4 major online retailers (Walmart, Amazon, Target, and
Walgreens in July 2016). We included 6 moisturizers that po-
tentially would reduce the risk of future sensitization for in-
fantile atopic dermatitis: petroleum jelly,12,13 Vaniply Oint-
ment, Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, Cetaphil
Moisturizing Cream, and CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.14 Sun-
flower seed oil, used in the study by Simpson et al,9 was also
included. From 0 to 6 months of age, we assumed linear
growth. This enabled us to determine the average body sur-
face area requiring moisturization and then calculate the cost
per application.
In brief, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for atopic
dermatitis were determined using the prevalence of child-
hood atopic dermatitis for mild, moderate, and severe dis-
ease as previously reported15 with health utility values of 0.86
for mild disease, 0.69 for moderate disease, and 0.59 in se-
vere disease in a pediatric population.16 A decision tree was
created to visualize the alternatives to standard care for atopic
dermatitis (eFigure in the Supplement). The incremental cost-
effectiveness of moisturization as prophylaxis for atopic der-
matitis was then calculated using the relative risk reduction
of 50% determined by Simpson et al9 to better represent a
US population with sensitivity analysis conducted assuming
a relative risk ranging from 0.28 to 0.9. The $/QALY value was
calculated by dividing the cost of moisturization with stan-
dard care (assumed to be $0) by the incremental QALYs. The
time window of health utility was set at 6 months.
Results
The calculated amount of daily all-body moisturizer needed
at birth was 3.6 g (0.12 oz) per application, which increased to
6.6 g (0.22 oz) at 6 months of age. Of the 7 products evalu-
ated, the average price was $1.07/oz (range, $0.13/oz-$2.96/
oz)(Table).Petrolatum(Vaseline;petroleumjelly)wasthemost
affordable ($7.30 for 6 months of use), while Vaniply Oint-
mentwasthemostexpensive($173.39for6months).TheTable
summarizes the costs and outcomes used in the incremental
cost-effectivenessanalysis.TheincrementalQALYgainofmois-
turizers was 0.030, 0.021, and 0.0041 for a relative risk of 0.28,
0.5, and 0.9, respectively, using a 6-month time window. The
Figure demonstrates the sensitivity analysis of $/QALY with
changes in relative risk. Compared with usual care and assum-
ing equal efficacy among moisturizers, petrolatum was most
cost-effective ($353/QALY), and Vaniply Ointment least cost-
effective ($8386/QALY).
Discussion
Our data show that moisturization from birth to 6 months of
life is likely to be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention
of atopic dermatitis. Even with a relative risk of only 0.9, pro-
phylactic moisturization would still likely meet the National
Key Points
Question What is the cost benefit of using moisturizers for the
prevention of atopic dermatitis in high-risk newborns?
Findings In this cost-effectiveness study, there was an
incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) benefit of
prophylactic moisturization with 7 common moisturizers used in
a 6-month window. Overall, the prophylactic use of moisturizers
was determined to be cost-effective, with petroleum jelly
demonstrating the best cost-benefit ratio ($353/QALY).
Meaning Prophylactic moisturization for atopic dermatitis
in high-risk newborns is likely to be cost-effective for all
7 moisturizers studied.

s threshold for cost-effectiveness (approximately
$38 000/QALY).17 Our estimate of the incremental QALYs is
based on only 6 months of benefit. Longer-term studies will
reveal whether prophylactic moisturization will lead to a lon-
ger, more durable benefit with regard to the development of
atopic dermatitis beyond the first 6 months of life.
Limitations
Thereareseverallimitationstothisanalysis.First,thedatasur-
rounding the clinical efficacy of prophylactic moisturization
are based on preliminary data, which are a part of a larger ef-
fort to determine the role prophylactic moisturization should
play in atopic dermatitis. Second, we estimated equal effi-
cacy across all moisturizers; there is limited available empiri-
cal data to compare the effectiveness of different moisturiz-
ers for atopic dermatitis. In the study by Simpson et al,9 there
was an insufficient study size for a subgroup analysis of the
clinical efficacy stratified by moisturizer used. Future efforts
should be made to distinguish whether variations in moistur-
izer vehicle (ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or oil) or ingredi-
ents yield clinically significant differences. In addition, we as-

subsequent rate of atopic dermatitis development is un-
known. Larger-scale studies with longer follow-up will deter-
minewhetherprophylacticmoisturizationsimplydelaystheon-

Conclusions
The US annual cost for atopic dermatitis is estimated to range
anywhere from $364 million to $3.8 billion, which is compa-
rable to costs of other conditions with large economic bur-
dens such as emphysema.18,19 Given the predominance of chil-
dren with atopic dermatitis, the cost to Medicaid is $5900 per
beneficiary per year.18 Beyond the direct cost savings in pre-

a The amount of dollars per ounce
was determined by averaging the
listed price of the moisturizer across
4 major retailers. The average cost
per application is determined by
averaging the body surface area of
an average sex-neutral child from
birth to 6 months of age. The total
cost represents the amount of
moisturizer needed for a once-daily
application for 6 months. The
incremental quality-adjusted
life-years (QALYs) were assumed to
be equal for all 7 moisturizers.

venting atopic dermatitis, preserving the skin barrier early in
life for high-risk individuals may theoretically reduce the risk
ofdevelopingotheratopicdiseases.Forinstance,neonatalskin
barrier dysfunction is associated with food allergies at 2 years
of age.20 Furthermore, prophylactic moisturization may miti-
gate the risk of the occurrence of a growing list of atopic der-
matitis comorbidities, which include sleep disturbances, obe-
sity, anemia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.21-23
Prophylactic moisturization has decreased mortality by 32%
forpretermbabiesinadevelopingcountrybypreventingnoso-
comial sepsis,12 and thus providing the precedent for a large-
scale moisturization campaign.
The future for atopic dermatitis prevention is bright given
the emerging biologics expected to come to market in the next
few years. However, the US health care system will continue
to shift toward more cost consciousness. Although the use of
moisturizers based on preliminary efficacy data is cost-
effective from a health system perspective, insurers do not
cover moisturizers for patients with atopic dermatitis. Thus,
out-of-pocket expenses for these interventions represent a sig-
nificant economic burden for many families. In one recent
study,24 an average of 35% of a familyâ€™
s discretionary income
was spent out of pocket on atopic dermatitis, with moisturiz-
ers representing the single highest medication expense. Cur-
rently, therapy for atopic dermatitis is reactive. Prophylactic
moisturization would represent an attractive preventative
health strategy against atopic dermatitis from both a medical
and economic perspective.
