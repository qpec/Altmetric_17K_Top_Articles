ABSTRACT
Patients with CKD suffer from food aversion, anorexia, and malnutrition. Although olfaction has a significant role in
determiningfoodflavor,ourunderstandingofolfactoryimpairmentandoftheolfaction-nutritionaxisinpatientswith
kidney disease is limited. We quantified odor identification, odor threshold, and subjective odor perception in a
cohort (n=161) comprising 36 participants with CKD, 100 participants with ESRD, and 25 controls. We investigated
olfaction-nutrition associations in these participants and examined a novel intervention to improve olfaction in
ESRD. The mean odor identification score was lower in patients with CKD (75.6%613.1%; P=0.02) and ESRD
(66.8%615.1%; P,0.001) than in controls (83.6%611.4%). Patients with ESRD exhibited higher odor threshold
than the remaining participants exhibited. All groups had similar scores for subjective smell assessment. In multivar-
iable adjusted analyses, kidney disease associated with increased odds of odor identification deficits (odds ratio,
4.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.94 to 11.89). A reduction in odor identification score was associated with higher
subjective global assessment score and lower serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and albumin concentrations.
We found no associations between odor threshold and nutritional parameters. In a proof of concept, 6-week, open-
label clinical trial, intranasal theophylline (an epithelial membrane transport and proton secretion activator) increased
odor identification score in five out of seven (71%) patients with ESRD. In conclusion, patients with kidney disease
haveolfactorydeficitsthatmay influencetheirnutritionalstatus.Ourpreliminary results regardingolfactoryimprove-
ment using intranasal theophylline warrant confirmation in a randomized controlled trial.

RESULTS
Study Cohort
The study participants (n=161) included controls with normal
kidney function (n=25), patients with CKD (n=36), and pa-
tients with ESRD (n=100). Patients with CKD were recruited
from an outpatient nephrology clinic, patients with ESRD
were recruited from outpatient dialysis units, and the controls
were recruited from our institution’s volunteer database.
The baseline characteristics of study participants are pre-
sented in Table 1. The control, CKD, and ESRD groups did not
differ with respect to age, sex, education (high school graduation
rate), and current tobacco use. No participants in the control,
CKD, or ESRD groups had medical/surgical conditions directly
linked with defects in olfaction, such as allergic rhinitis, trauma
to olfactory apparatus, neurodegenerative diseases, or cancer.8
All patients with ESRD were dialysis-dependent; 94 were on he-
modialysisandsixwereonperitonealdialysis.Themediandialysis
vintage for patients with ESRD was 14.7 months (interquartile
range, 5.5–36.5 months). The mean Kt/V for patients with ESRD
was 1.4460.34. All except two patients on hemodialysis were on
three times a week, in-center hemodialysis (one patient was re-
ceiving two times a week, in-center hemodialysis and the other
was receiving four times a week, in-center hemodialysis).
The control, CKD, and ESRD groups did not differ in terms
of body mass index or waist circumference. However, sub-
jective global assessment (SGA) score, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, and albumin demonstrated deterioration of
nutritional status among patients with kidney disease.
Olfactory Defects in Patients with Kidney Disease
Odor Identification
Odor identification was assessed using the University of
Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a validated
40-item smell identification test.9 We computed odor identifi-
cation score for each participant as the percentage of correctly
identified odors. As shown in Table 2, the mean odor identifi-
cation score was lower in patients with CKD (75.6%613.1%)
and ESRD (66.8%615.1%) compared with controls (83.6%6
11.4%). On the basis of a previously established classification
pattern,10 we categorized olfactory function as follows: normal

 olfaction (at least 34 correct answers for men or at least 35 cor-
rect answers for women), mildhyposmia(30–33 correct answers
for men or 31–34 correct answers for women), moderate hypo-
smia (26–29 correct answers for men or 26–30 correct answers
for women), severe hyposmia (19–25 correct answers for both
sexes), and anosmia (#18 correct answers for both sexes). The
majority of patients with CKD (69%) and ESRD (92%) had
abnormal odor identification (Figure 1). Mild hyposmia was
present in 32% of controls, 25% of patients with CKD, and
29% of patients with ESRD; moderate hyposmia was present
in 8% of controls, 22% of patients with CKD, and 24% of pa-
tients with ESRD; severe hyposmia was present in 8% of con-
trols, 19% of patients with CKD, and 29% of patients with
ESRD; and anosmia was present in 0% of controls, 3% of pa-
tients with CKD, and 10% of patients with ESRD (P,0.001 for
differences in olfactory function categories across control, CKD,
and ESRD groups).
We also measured the time taken by study participants to
complete the UPSIT, as a measure of the patients’ difficulty
in identifying the odorants.11,12 As shown in Table 2, the
mean UPSIT completion time was higher in patients with
kidney disease, 18.166.3 minutes in patients with CKD and
16.966.1 minutes in patients with ESRD compared with
14.264.6 minutes in controls (P=0.02 for the differences
across control, CKD, and ESRD groups).
Presence of kidney disease was associated with increased
odds of odor identification deficits in univariate analysis (odds
ratio, 6.83; 95% confidence interval, 2.94 to 15.88) (Figure 2).
Presence of kidney disease remained a significant predictor of
odor identification deficits in a multivariable logistic regres-
sion model adjusted for age, race, and sex (odds ratio, 5.93;
95% confidence interval, 2.50 to 14.05); in a model adjusted
for age, race, sex, education, presence of diabetes, and current
tobacco use (odds ratio, 4.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.94 to
11.89); in a model adjusted for age, race, sex, education, pres-
ence of diabetes, current tobacco use, and for the use of the
following medications: aspirin, statin, b blocker, angiotensin
inhibitor, vitamin D (nutritional and/or active vitamin D),
and cinacalcet (odds ratio, 4.41; 95% confidence interval,
1.53 to 12.65); and in a model adjusted for age, race, sex,
education, presence of diabetes, current tobacco use, and prior
stroke (odds ratio, 4.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.82 to
11.18). Dialysis vintage and Kt/V were not associated with
odor identification scores.
The control participants recorded a higher percentage of
correct answers than patients with CKD or ESRD for both
food-related (P=0.03) and nonfood-related (P,0.001) odor-
ants on the UPSIT (Figure 3). The largest differences in the
percentage of correct answers between control and ESRD
groups were found for: pineapple (identified correctly by
31% more controls than patients with ESRD); pine (30% dif-
ference); cheddar cheese and rose (28% difference for both);
and menthol, strawberry, and turpentine (26% difference for
all three).
Odor Threshold
We used the Snap & Sniff Threshold Test to determine the
lowest 2-phenylethanol concentration that a study participant
can reliably detect.13 As shown in Table 2, the mean odor
threshold was similar between controls (24.361.3 log vol/vol)
and patients with CKD (24.561.4 log vol/vol). However,
patients with ESRD (23.961.3 log vol/vol) exhibited a
higher odor detection threshold compared with patients
with CKD (P=0.04 versus patients with CKD; P=0.01 versus
remaining cohort). The mean threshold value in patients

 with ESRD corresponds to an approximately four-fold
higher odorant concentration (126 mM) compared with
the mean concentration that patients with CKD are able to
detect (approximately 32 mM). The number of attempts
(odorant presentations) during the administration of the
threshold test was lower in patients with ESRD compared
to controls and patients with CKD.
Subjective Odor Perception
On average, participants rated their sense of smell at approx-
imately 80% on a scale of 0%–100% (0, complete impairment
of olfaction and 100, no impairment in olfaction). Scores on
subjective assessment of smell did not differ among control,
CKD, and ESRD groups (Table 2). We observed a correlation
between odor identification and subjective olfactory assess-
ment in the control (r=0.41; P=0.04) and CKD groups
(r=0.41; P=0.02); however, a similar correlation was not ob-
served for the ESRD group (r=0.12; P=0.23).
Olfaction-Nutrition Association
We assessed the association between olfaction and nutrition in
thestudy participantsbydeterminingtheSGAscoreandserum
levels of nutritional markers. The SGA score, a validated nu-
tritional assessment tool that addresses food intake, weight
changes, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and
anorexia,14 increased as odor identification score worsened
(r=20.22; P,0.01). A reduction in odor identification score
was also associated with lower serum total cholesterol (r=0.36;
P,0.001), LDL cholesterol (r=0.34; P,0.001), and albumin
(r=0.32; P,0.001). No association was noted between odor
identification score and prealbumin (r=0.11; P=0.18). In pa-
tients with ESRD, no association was noted between odor
identification score and normalized protein catabolic rate
(r=20.04; P=0.70).
The SGA score increased (P=0.01), whereas total choles-
terol, LDL cholesterol, and albumin demonstrated reductions
(P,0.001 for all three nutritional parameters) across the
graded odor identification categories (Figure 4). In analyses
restricted to patients with kidney disease (CKD and ESRD) or
ESRD alone, trends suggesting similar olfaction-nutrition as-
sociation were noted.
No associations were noted between odor threshold and
SGA score (r=20.14; P=0.08), total cholesterol (r=0.11;
P=0.17), LDL cholesterol (r=0.15; P=0.08), albumin
(r=0.07; P=0.36), and prealbumin (r=0.04; P=0.66). In pa-
tients with ESRD, no association was noted between odor
threshold and normalized protein catabolic rate (r=0.01;
P=0.95).
In multivariable analyses adjusted for age, race, sex, current
tobacco use, education, and presence of diabetes, the associa-
tions between odor identification deficits and the SGA score
and the associations between odor identification deficits and
nutritional markers (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and
albumin) remained significant (Table 3). In multivariable
analyses restricted to patients with ESRD, similar associations
were noted for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The
magnitude of association statistics for SGA score and albumin
levels were attenuated; however, trends in a similar direction
were noted for patients with ESRD.
Pilot Clinical Trial
In a proof of concept clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT02479451), we enrolled seven patients with ESRD with at
Figure 3. Percentages of correct answers for food-related and
nonfood-related odorants on the odor identification test are
higher in the control than in the CKD and ESRD groups.

 least mild odor identification deficit detected by the UPSIT,
and examined the safety and efficacy of intranasal theophylline
for mitigating olfactory deficits. Before treatment, we tested
for and confirmed that there was no learning effect by retesting
odor identification in trial participants. This is in agreement
with previous reports that concluded that the UPSIT has high
test-retest reliability (r=0.91).9,15 Intranasal theophylline has
been previously reported to improve olfactory function in
hyposmic patients without kidney disease.16,17 In our trial,
20 mg intranasal theophylline was self-administered by study
patients once daily into each naris for 6 weeks. The trial par-
ticipants were followed at 2-week intervals for 6 weeks. The
trial participants tolerated intranasal theophylline well and no
adverse events were reported during follow-up visits. Serum
theophylline levels assessed at every follow-up were undetectable
throughout the study period in all participants. Theophylline
treatment caused an increase in mean odor identification score
in five out of the seven (71%) participants (mean improvement
of 5.0%63.5% compared with baseline). In two patients, the
mean odor identification score deteriorated during treatment by
1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. The maximum increase in odor
identification score during the trial period was 10.7%64.2%
compared with baseline. For three trial patients the increase in
odor identification score translated into improvement by one
functional category (e.g., from severe to moderate hyposmia, or
from moderate to mild hyposmia). The mean odor detection
threshold improved in four patients after theophylline treatment
by 10.5%614.1%, but the average value within the group was
not different from the baseline threshold.
DISCUSSION
We performed a large cross-sectional study to examine olfactory
deficits in patients with kidney disease. Our data demonstrate
that odor identification is impaired in a majority of patients
with CKD (approximately 70%) and ESRD (approximately
90%). In our study, olfactory threshold values were compa-
rable between patients with kidney disease and controls, but
patients with ESRD exhibited a higher threshold (i.e., worse
odor detection) compared with patients with CKD. In a pilot
clinical trial, olfactory deficits appear to be correctable with
intranasal theophylline administration. Our results highlight
olfactory deficit as a potential novel mechanism to compre-
hend malnutrition, as patients with odor identification defi-
cits in our study were noted to have a higher SGA score and
lower levels of biochemical measures of nutritional status.
Our findings of patients with CKD demonstrating defects in
odor identification and patients with ESRD demonstrating
defects in odor identification and odor threshold may facili-
tate the development of interventions tailored to the severity
of underlying kidney disease.
Possible explanations for the occurrence of olfactory def-
icits in patients with CKD and ESRD include reduced capacity
and impaired regeneration of olfactory epithelial cells in the
Figure 4. Box plots of nutritional markers across the olfactory func-
tional categories in all study participants indicate a worsening of the
nutritional status associated with olfactory identification impairment.

 presence of uremic toxins.7,18–20 Olfactory function has also
been reported as a marker of uremia associated neurologic
dysfunction.7Ourdatavalidate previoussmaller reportssuggest-
ing that kidney disease affects odor identification capacity,21,22
and that olfactory dysfunction in patients with kidney disease
correlates with the severity of the underlying kidney disease.18,23
As far as odor threshold is concerned, prior studies have yielded
mixed results, from no change in odor detection threshold in
patients with kidney disease24,25 to a significant impairment in
odor threshold in patients with kidney disease compared with
controls.18 This study is notable as it provides the largest sample
size compared with any of the aforementioned investigations of
olfaction in patients with kidney disease. Because a large part of a
meal’s flavor is attributed to olfactory input,26 loss or alteration
of smell could indeed lead to loss or alteration of taste.27 This
may underline the association between poor olfaction and poor
nutritional status.28,29
Odor identification is thought to reflect central olfactory
processing pathways, whereas detection thresholds may reflect
peripheral events, i.e., processes occurring at the level of the
epithelial olfactory sensory neurons.22 The question regarding
which aspect of olfaction—odor threshold or identification—
is affected in kidney disease can inform the development of
future targeted therapeutics that modulate central or peripheral
pathways. Landis et al. previously reported that a given kidney
patient cohort might detect one odor normally and yet exhibit
an elevated detection threshold for another odorant.22 This al-
lowed them to hypothesize that the olfactory deficit in patients
with ESRD isunderlined by mixed mechanisms, i.e., they are due
to defects inboth central and peripheral processing pathways.7,22
Results from our pilot clinical trial suggest that the kidney dis-
ease-associated odor identification deficit may be corrected by
nasal theophylline administration, a phenomenon that needs
further mechanistic evaluation considering that effects of
theophylline are likely mediated via peripheral olfactory
processing pathways.
Data from our pilot clinical trialareconsistent with findings
regarding reversibility of olfactory deficits in patients without
kidney disease. In an open-label study of 312 patients with
hyposmia caused by influenza, chronic sinusitis, and head in-
jury, 60% of participants reported improvement in olfactory
function after receiving oral theophylline.16 A subsequent
study by the same group reported an 80% rate of response
to intranasal theophylline.17 Theophylline, a nonselective
phosphodiesterase inhibitor, activates epithelial ion channels
and other membrane transporters by increasing intracellular
cAMP and cGMP levels. One possible novel mechanism for
theophylline action involves the vacuolar proton-pumping
ATPase (V-ATPase), which we found to be highly expressed
in rodent30,31 and human olfactory epithelium (T.G. P�
aunescu,
D. Brown, and E.H. Holbrook, unpublished data). We and others
have independently demonstrated the functional importance
of V-ATPase–mediated proton secretion for odor detection in
mice,31,32 and showed that elevation of intracellular cAMP
and cGMP levels markedly activates V-ATPases in renal proton-
secreting cells.33,34 The role of V-ATPase as a target for theophyl-
line action on olfaction needs future investigation.
Despite theclear separationseen among thethree cohortsin
theodor identificationtest,subjectiveself-assessments ofsmell
were similar in the control, CKD, and ESRD groups. In addi-
tion, in the ESRD group there was no correlation between
subjective and objective measures of olfaction, indicating
that these patients are unaware of their disease-associated
olfactory decline. Taken together with previously published
data from smaller populations,21,22,35 our findings emphasize
the importance of objective olfactory assessment in future
studies. This occurrence has also been described in patients
with diabetes36 and Alzheimer disease.37
Althoughtheassociationsbetweenodoridentificationscore
and nutritional markers demonstrated consistent directional-
ity and retained significance in multivariable analyses, the
moderate strength of these associations suggests that olfactory

control, CKD, andESRD groupsdespitesimilar body mass index
and waist circumference emphasize the advantage gained from a
multidimensional dynamic assessment that incorporates food
intake, weight changes, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Our study has limitations. Residual confounding cannot be
ruled out in an association study of this nature and causality

 cannot be attributed to the described associations. A future
longitudinal CKD progression study will corroborate the severity
of olfactory impairment and malnutrition as kidney function
deteriorates. We did not investigate olfactory hedonics (specific
assessments of pleasant versus unpleasant stimuli); however, such
assessments should be included in a longitudinal study because
it was suggested that patients exhibit changes in food preferences
with development of kidney disease.38 A longitudinal study in
patients with kidney disease is also needed to examine whether
the association between olfactory impairment and mortality ob-
served in the general population holds true in patients with CKD
and ESRD.39 Although none of our patients had known neuro-
degenerative diseases, a formal assessment of cognition was not
conducted, limiting our ability to exclude the influence of
nonuremic etiologies of cognitive impairment on olfactory
function. The majority of our ESRD group were receiving
in-center hemodialysis three times a week; thus, our current
findings may not be generalizable to patients receiving peri-
toneal dialysis or hemodialysis prescription different than in
this study. The olfactory impairment has been suggested to
improve with hemodialysis treatment, and future studies that
compare effects of different dialysis prescriptions on olfaction
are needed.7,22
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with
CKD and ESRD have olfactory deficits that correlate with
markers of malnutrition. Our findings from a pilot clinical
trial support further testing of nasal theophylline to alleviate
olfactory deficits and malnutrition in patients with kidney
disease.
CONCISE METHODS
Our studies (cross-sectional study and clinical trial) were approved by
the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Institutional Review
Board. We adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki protocol.
Research Setting and Study Participants
Any adult (18–85 years of age) without kidney disease or with CKD or
ESRD who was capable of providing informed consent was eligible to
participate. Between March of 2015 and May of 2016, 161 patients
signed informed consent forms to enroll in the cross-sectional study.
Participants included controls with normal kidney function (n=25),
patients with CKD (n=36), and patients with ESRD (n=100).
Participants were recruited from outpatient settings including a
CKD clinic, peritoneal dialysis center, and outpatient dialysis units
affiliated with the Fresenius Medical Care North America and MGH.
Patients’ demographic information, medical history, SGA score, and
subjective rating of olfaction were recorded and 10 ml of serum were
collected from each patient.
Assessment of Olfaction
Olfactory function was assessed using the UPSIT and the Snap &
Sniff Threshold Test (Sensonics, Inc., Haddon Heights, NJ). The
UPSIT15 includes 40 multiple choice questions, each referring to
an encapsulated scratch-and-sniff odorant. The odorants on the UP-
SIT include 18 food-related odorants (e.g., pineapple, dill pickle, and
chocolate) and 22 nonfood-related odorants (e.g., pine, motor oil,
and leather).
The Snap & Sniff Threshold Test uses the pure olfactory nerve
stimulant 2-phenylethanol40 at half-log dilutions ranging from 1022
to 1029 M in a protocol based on a single staircase forced-choice
paradigm.13,41
For subjective self-assessments of olfaction, patients were asked
to rate their own sense of smell and taste on a scale of 0–100, with 100
being the best.
Assessment of Nutritional Status
NutritionalstatuswasassessedusingtheSGAscore,bymeasurements
of serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, albumin, and prealbu-
min, and by computing normalized catabolic rate (for patients with
ESRD).
Serum collected from each patient was aliquoted, and the aliquots
were frozen at 280°C. Samples were further processed by LabCorp
(Burlington, NC). Patients’ serum was assessed for concentrations of
creatinine, BUN, albumin, prealbumin, total cholesterol, and LDL
cholesterol.
Pilot Clinical Trial
We recruited hemodialysis-dependent patients with ESRD from
the cross-sectional study described above for a pilot, open-label clin-
ical study to examine the safety and efficacy of intranasal theophylline
for mitigating olfactory deficits (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier
NCT02479451). Inclusion criteria were as described above for pa-
tients with ESRD. Seven patients provided written informed consent.
Nasal theophylline (20 mg theophylline methylpropyl paraben in a
0.4-ml saline solution) was self-administered by study patients once
daily (in the morning) into each naris for a total of 6 weeks. The study
medication is consistent with what was used in a previously published
study in the non-ESRD setting and was provided by Foundation Care
Pharmacy (Earth City, MO).16,17 Follow-up visits occurred at 2, 4,
and 6 weeks, when study procedures including objective assessment
of olfaction, subjective rating of smell, SGA score determination, and
blood collection were performed as described above. Serum theoph-
ylline levels were assessed with an immunoassay using THEO2 in
vitro tests (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) on a Roche/Hitachi
cobas c analyzer. A physical examination for study participants was
also performed, as well as an assessment of adverse events.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics were compared using one-way ANOVA tests
for Gaussian continuous measures, Kruskal–Wallis test for non-
Gaussian continuous variables, and chi-squared test for categorical
variables. Olfactory assessments among control, CKD, and ESRD
groups are summarized as the mean and SD and compared using
one-way ANOVAs. For statistically significant ANOVAs, all pairwise
comparisons among the three groups are tested using the Tukey stu-
dentized range adjustment.

faction deficits, where olfactory defects are categorized on an ordinal

 scale (normal, mild, moderate, severe, or anosmia), was analyzed
using univariate and multivariable ordinal logistic regression models.
Foursetsofcovariateswereadjusted:multivariable1,adjustedforage,

3, adjusted for age, race, sex, current tobacco use, educational level,
presence of diabetes, and for the use of the following medications:
aspirin, statin, b blocker, angiotensin inhibitor, vitamin D (nutri-
tional and/or active vitamin D), and cinacalcet; and multivariable 4,
adjusted for age, race, sex, current tobacco use, educational level,
presence of diabetes, and prior stroke. Odds ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals were reported.
We applied both visual and analytical approaches to study the
association between olfactory defects and nutritional markers. The
distribution of each nutritional marker across the olfactory func-
tional categories was visualized by box and whisker plots (boxes
demonstrate median and 25%–75% range; whiskers demonstrate
the 10%–90% range). Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression
models were performed. For adjusted analyses, two multivariable
models were constructed: multivariable model 1, adjusted for age,
race, and sex; and multivariable model 2, adjusted for age, race,
sex, current tobacco use, educational level, and presence of diabe-
tes. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed among pa-
tients with ESRD.
The statistical significance was set at a two-sided P,0.05. All
analyses were performed using the SAS program version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) or R version 3.2.2.
