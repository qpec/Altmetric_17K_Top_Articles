 Setting—3 New York hospitals.
Participants—161 hip fracture patients.
Intervention—79 patients were randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided single injection 
femoral nerve block administered by emergency physicians at emergency department admission 
followed by placement of a continuous fascia iliaca block by anesthesiologists within 24 hours. 82 
control patients received conventional analgesics.
Measurements—Pain (0-10 scale), distance walked on post-operative day (POD) 3, Walking 
ability at 6 weeks following discharge, opioid side effects.
Results—Pain scores 2 hours following emergency department presentation favored the 
intervention group compared to controls (3.5 versus 5.3 respectively, P=.002). Pain scores on POD 
3 were significantly better for the intervention as compared to the control group for pain at rest 
(2.9 versus 3.8, p=.005), with transfers out of bed (4.7 versus 5.9, p=.005), and with walking (4.1 
versus 4.8, p=.002). Intervention patients walked significantly further than controls in 2 minutes 
on POD 3 (170.6 feet (95% CI 109.3, 232) versus 100.0 feet (95% CI 65.1, 134.9) respectively. 
P=.041). At 6 weeks, intervention patients reported better walking and stair climbing ability (mean 
FIM locomotion scores of 10.3 (95% CI 9.6, 11.0) versus 9.1 (95% CI 8.2, 10.0), P=0.045. 
Intervention patients reported significantly fewer opioid side effects (3% versus 12.4%, P=.028) 
and required 33-40% fewer parenteral morphine sulfate equivalents.
Conclusion—Femoral nerve blocks performed by emergency physicians followed by continuous 
fascia iliaca blocks placed by anesthesiologists are feasible and result in superior outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Over 250,000 adults over age 65 are hospitalized with hip fracture in the U.S. annually and 
this number is expected to increase to 289,000 by 2030.1,2 For the 80% of patients who 
survive to six months post fracture, 60% will have recovered their pre-fracture walking 
ability and only 50% will have recovered their pre-fracture ability to perform their activities 
of daily living.3 Despite its perception as a surgical problem, almost all hip fracture patients 
are treated by geriatricians/internists/family physicians, emergency physicians, 
anesthesiologists, physiatrists and surgeons.4 In a single care episode, they receive treatment 
in emergency departments (EDs), operating rooms, surgical and medicine services, and have 
rehabilitation services in acute and sub-acute centers, nursing homes, or their own homes 
following discharge.4
Given the impact of hip fracture on function - after one year, only 54% of surviving patients 
are able to walk unaided3 – interventions to improve post-operative recovery are needed. 
Pain is universally present and a major impediment to recovery in hip fracture.5 
Observational studies have shown that hip fracture pain has been associated with an 
increased risk of post-operative complications5-7 and has been shown to lead to prolonged 
bed rest, delayed ambulation, missed or shortened physical therapy sessions, and impaired

 function post-operatively and as long as six months following surgery.5 Whereas opioids are 
an effective treatment for pain, opioids are problematic in older adults due to their side effect 
profile.8,9
Due to their potential to reduce opioid side effects, regional anesthetic techniques are 
attractive alternatives in older adults with fracture pain. Two recent systematic reviews have 
highlighted the benefits of perioperative nerve blocks compared to standard care (oral and 
parenteral analgesics) in reducing hip fracture pain, and the American Academy of 
Orthopedic Surgeons recently issued a strong recommendation to employ these techniques 
in the management of this disease.10,11 Nevertheless, the integration of these techniques into 
routine care has been problematic. A comprehensive review on the management of pain in 
hip fracture noted that although “nerve blockade is within the repertoire of most practicing 
anesthesiologists, many clinicians do not perform it routinely because they believe the 
additional time, effort, and supervision required may outweigh the benefits.”11 It is also 
unclear as to the effect of blockades on ambulation or rehabilitation, outcomes beyond the 
peri-operative period, and systemic opioid use.
Ideally, effective pain management for hip fracture should begin at presentation to the ED 
and be seamlessly integrated into routine medical and surgical care. We have previously 
reported results which demonstrated that femoral nerve blocks administered under 
ultrasound guidance can be taught to and administered safely by emergency physicians 
(EP)12 and that a mobile peripheral nerve block service can be seamlessly integrated into 
routine pre-operative hip fracture care.13 Here, we report the main outcomes of our 
randomized controlled trial that compared a pain management program comprised of a 
single injection femoral nerve block (FNB) administered by EPs followed by placement of a 
continuous fascia iliaca block (cFIB) by anesthesiologists 24 hours later to conventional 
analgesic treatment (opioids and acetaminophen administered at treating physician 
discretion) at 3 New York hospitals. Outcomes included ED pain, pain and function post-
operatively and 6 weeks following discharge, as well as opioid requirements and side effect 
incidence.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare peripheral nerve blocks versus 
conventional analgesic therapy in hip fracture patients aged 60 years and older presenting to 
3 New York EDs on outcomes of pain, functional recovery, and analgesic side effects. The 
study hospitals included a 1,171 bed quaternary care academic medical center (Mount Sinai) 
and an 856 bed academic teaching hospital (Beth Israel), both located in Manhattan, and a 
711 bed teaching hospital in Brooklyn (Maimonides Medical Center). Maimonides was 
added as a third site mid-way through the study (10/11) due to declining hip fracture 
admissions at Beth Israel. Following training sessions for EPs at the 3 study sites in the 
utility and performance of FNBs (described elsewhere12), eligible and consenting hip 
fracture patients presenting to study hospitals were randomized to receive FNB 
(intervention) or standard therapy (control) in the ED. Intervention patients subsequently had 
a cFIB placed by an anesthesiologist within 24 hours after the initial single injection FNB,

 either on the orthopedic ward or in the operating room at the time of surgery – whichever 
occurred sooner. This mobile peripheral nerve block service has been previously 
described.13 Control patients received conventional standing and “as needed” parenteral or 
oral analgesics (opioids and acetaminophen) as determined by the treating physicians. 
Evidence and expert guidance available at the time of the study did not yet support the use of 
nerve blocks over conventional analgesics and standard practice in the study institutions did 
not include regional nerve blocks for hip fracture analgesia.
Subjects were interviewed daily about pain and opioid related side effects, had physical 
performance testing conducted on post-operative day (POD) 3, and were interviewed by 
telephone 6 weeks after discharge to assess walking ability. The study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Boards of the 3 participating hospitals.
Patients
All admissions to the 3 EDs were prospectively screened daily from 08:00 to 20:00, Sundays 
to Fridays, 4/2009 through 3/2013 by trained clinical interviewers. The screening window 
was based on admission data that suggested that 80% of hip fracture patients would be 
captured during this time period. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 60 
years or older with a radiographically confirmed hip fracture (femoral neck, 
intertrochanteric, or peri-capsular). Exclusion criteria are detailed in Figure 1. All patients 
gave written consent.
Randomization and Masking
Subjects were randomized to FNB or standard care (control) using a computer generated 
stratified blocked randomization list with stratification by site. The block size for the 
randomization was randomly chosen for each block as two, four or six patients. After 
determining eligibility and obtaining informed consent at ED admission, the interviewers 
(CIs) conducted an initial brief pain interview. After conducting the initial interview, CIs 
informed the treating physician that the patient was enrolled in the trial, left the ED and 
contacted the project manager to inform her of a study enrollment in the ED and the identity 
of the treating physician. The project manager determined randomization status by opening a 
sealed envelope, and while remaining blinded to the patient’s identity, contacted the treating 
EP to let them know if their enrolled patient was to receive a FNB or standard analgesic 
care. Intervention patients were also able to receive as needed opioids at the discretion of 
treating physicians. CIs remained blinded to patients’ randomization status throughout the 
trial, as did the investigators.
Procedures
In July of each study year (October of 2011 at Maimonides initially), all incoming EP 
residents at each site were trained in ultrasound-guided FNB.12 Additionally, a core group of 
teaching attending EPs were trained at each site to ensure appropriate oversight. The single 
shot FNB consisted of 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and was performed under ultrasound 
guidance. Within twenty-four hours after the FNB or at the time of surgery, whichever was 
sooner, an anesthesiologist inserted a cFIB infusion catheter under ultrasound guidance. A

 bolus of 15 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine was injected followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2% 
ropivacaine at 5 mL/hour. Catheters were removed after POD 3.
Control patients received oral and intravenous analgesic therapy at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Sham saline injections and catheter infusions were considered but 
rejected as pilot data demonstrated that both EPs and anesthesiologists would not perform 
sham injections as they believed them to be “unethical”. Sham catheters taped to the skin 
were initially employed as a blinding technique for the cFIB but were subsequently 
discarded early in the course of the study as they failed to blind clinical nursing staff.
Immediately after obtaining informed consent at ED admission, CIs queried eligible patients 
about their pain. Enrolled patients were asked to rate their pain on a 0-10 numeric rating 
scale (NRS) with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable. Subjects were also 
queried as to their current pain level (0-10 NRS) and pain relief (worse pain than prior pain, 
no relief, slight relief, moderate relief, a lot of relief, complete relief) 1 and 2 hours 
following enrollment.
Patients were interviewed by CI’s on a daily basis (Sunday-Friday). Patients were asked to 
rate their pain at rest, with transfer out of bed, and with walking past a bedside chair on 0-10 
NRSs. CIs performed daily assessments of opioid side effects14 and delirium using the 
Confusion Assessment Method supplemented by chart review.7 If a patient was not able to 
be interviewed on a particular day (e.g., Saturdays or because they were unavailable and off 
the floor), we asked these patients on the following day to rate their present pain level and 
their pain on the prior missed day. On POD 3, patients cleared for weight bearing performed 
a 2-minute walk under supervision of a physical therapist and the distance ambulated was 
recorded. Patient characteristics were obtained from interviews and medical record review. 
Comorbid conditions were measured using the Charlson comorbidity index.15 Functional 
status before fracture was measured using the motor subscales of the Functional 
Independence Measure (FIM),16 depression using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale,17 
and overall health-related quality of life according to self-report using excellent, very good, 
good, fair, or poor. CIs interviewed patients by telephone 6-weeks after discharge about their 
functional status.
Outcomes
Main outcome measures included pain at 1 and 2 hours following ED admission, pain at 
rest, with transfers out of bed, and with walking on POD 3 and distance walked in 2 minutes 
on POD 3. Secondary outcomes included opioid requirements (morphine sulfate equivalents) 
and opioid related side-effects (1 or more days of severe nausea, sedation, or mental 
cloudiness), number of physical therapy sessions missed or shortened, and FIM locomotion 
scores (ability to walk and climb stairs) 6 weeks after discharge.
Statistical Analyses
Our initial sample size projections targeted a total sample size of 396 subjects to provide 
80% power to detect a 0·5-point difference in ED and post-operative pain scores using a 
two-sided α of ·05 employing standard deviations and means from our prior publications. 
Midway through our planned patient enrollment it became apparent that the rate of hip

 fractures had declined substantially at one of our study hospitals and the study’s Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended adding two additional study sites pending the 
results of a pre-planned interim analysis. The interim analysis, however, revealed a markedly 
greater effect size of the intervention on pain scores and function than hypothesized. As a 
result of these analyses, the DSMB advised a reduction in the targeted sample size to 150 
patients, and recommended adding only one additional site – Maimonides Medical Center. 
Differences between study groups in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were 
assessed with two-sided Fisher’s exact tests, chi-square tests for categorical variables, and 
independent-samples Student’s t-tests for continuous variables. All analyses were intention 
to treat and performed using STATA version 13.1.18 In order to reduce the possibility of an 
inflated Type 1 error due to multiple comparisons, p-values were adjusted (q) using the 
Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure (Q = 0.05). 19,20 Multivariable 
analyses (not presented) controlling for age, pre-fracture functional status, pre-fracture pain 
levels, type of fracture/repair, and pre-existing comorbidity revealed similar results.
This project was supported by a grant (R01AG030141) from the National Institute on Aging 
(NIA) and an NIA appointed DSMB oversaw the trial. The trial is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT00749489.
RESULTS
Study enrollment details and patient characteristics are in Figure 1 (CONSORT diagram) 
and Table 1 respectively. Analyzable data were available for 81 control (98% of enrolled 
subjects) and 72 intervention patients (91% of enrolled subjects) at hospital discharge and 57 
(70%) control and 51 (71%) intervention patients at 6 weeks following discharge. Eight 
intervention patients (11%) were transferred to the operating room before they could receive 
an ED FNB. Seven intervention patients (no overlap) had their cFIB catheter removed prior 
to POD 3 (2 at patient request, 3 became dislodged, and nursing staff insisted that 2 be 
removed because patients developed delirium that staff attributed to the catheters). There 
were no significant differences in baseline patient characteristics between the two groups 
and between patients who completed the study and those lost to follow-up.
There were no significant differences in baseline pain at ED admission. Compared to 
controls, intervention patients had significantly less pain both at 1 hour (3.7 (95% CI 3.0, 
4.5) versus 5.3 (95% CI 4.7, 6.1), p=.001, q=.001) and 2 hours following ED admission (3.5 
(95% CI 2.8, 4.3) versus 5.3 (95% CI 4.6, 6.0), p<.001, q=.003 (Figure 2) Pain scores on 
POD 3 also favored the intervention (Figure 3). Compared to control patients, patients in the 
intervention arm had significantly less pain at rest (1.8 (95% CI .9,1.9) versus 2.9 (95% CI 
2.3, 3.6), p=.005, q=.013), with transfers (4.7 (95% CI 4.1, 5.3) versus 5.9 (95% CI 5.2, 6.6), 
p=.005, q=.013), and with walking (4.1 (95% CI 3.5, 4.8) versus 5.6 (95% CI 4.8, 6.4), p=.
002, q=.008)
Function was improved in the intervention patients as compared to controls. Intervention 
patients walked over 70 feet farther in 2 minutes on POD 3 as compared to controls: 170.6 
feet (95% CI 109.3, 232.0) compared to 100.0 feet (95% CI 65.1, 134.9), p=.041, q=.048. 
Compared to controls, intervention patients were significantly more likely to report that they

 were walking beyond a bedside chair by POD 3 (82% versus 64% respectively, odds ratio 
2.49, 95% CI 1.17, 5.29, p=.018, q=.039), and were significantly less likely to have a 
physical therapy session missed or shortened (12.5% versus 27.2% of controls (odds ratio=.
38, 95% CI .16, .89, p=.027, q=.048). At 6 weeks, intervention patients reported better 
walking and stair climbing ability (mean FIM locomotion scores of 10.3 (95% CI 9.6, 11.0) 
versus 9.1 (95% CI 8.2, 10.0) for controls, p=0.045, q=.049).
Intervention patients required 33% fewer parenteral morphine sulfate equivalents than 
controls in the ED (0.8 mg/hour (95% CI .64, 1.05) versus 1.2 mg/hour (95% CI 0.94, 1.40) 
respectively, p=.035, q=.048). Post-operatively for the first 3 days, control patients received 
an average of 3.5 mg/day (95% CI 2.46, 4.48) of parenteral morphine sulfate equivalents as 
compared to 2.1 mg/day (95% CI, 1.16, 2.95) for intervention patients (P=0.04, q=.048). 
The number of patients reporting a severe opioid-related side effect (one or more days of 
severe nausea, sedation, or unclear thinking) was significantly lower in the intervention 
group versus control (3.0% versus 12.4%, OR=0.20, 95% CI .04, .96, p=.044, q=.048). 
There were no episodes of bleeding, falls, or catheter related infections in the intervention 
group and delirium rates were similar in both groups (17.1% in the control and 15.9% in the 
intervention, p=0.83).
CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that an interdisciplinary, regional anesthesia-based nerve block program 
for acute hip fracture patients involving early single shot FNBs performed by EPs followed 
by cFIBs performed by anesthesiologists is feasible and provides superior analgesic and 
functional outcomes when compared to conventional oral and parenteral analgesic therapy. 
Patients randomized to the intervention reported lower pain scores following ED admission, 
and this improvement persisted through POD 3. Intervention patients were also observed to 
have enhanced walking ability post-operatively and at 6 weeks after hospital discharge and 
had lower opioid requirements.
Whereas untreated pain has been shown to be associated with increased suffering and other 
adverse outcomes in hip fracture,7,21 its treatment remains problematic.11,22 Scheduled 
opioid therapy, although shown to be effective in improving pain and other outcomes,14 is 
difficult to manage and associated with challenging side effects in older adults. Peripheral 
nerve blocks performed by anesthesiologists have been shown to result in improved pain 
management as compared to standard analgesic therapy (acetaminophen/opioids).11 Despite 
recent guidelines recommending their use,10 regional nerve blocks have yet to become the 
standard of care in the management of hip fracture pain – largely because of logistical 
difficulties in getting anesthesiologists to the ED and because of beliefs that the additional 
time and effort outweigh the block’s benefits.
This study adds to the existing literature described above in several important ways and 
presents novel findings. First, it replicates the results of prior single site and single operator 
studies that have demonstrated enhanced analgesia associated with regional nerve blocks as 
compared to oral and parenteral analgesic therapies.10,11 As importantly, this is the first 
multicenter trial to our knowledge that demonstrates that regional nerve blocks can result in

 improved ambulation following hip fracture as compared to traditional analgesic 
treatments.10 Indeed the difference in the FIM locomotion scale represents the difference of 
being able to walk 150 feet as compared to less than 50 feet without human assistance. In 
real-life terms, this may represent the difference between being confined at home versus 
having the ability to ambulate for reasonable distances outside the home.
Second, we have shown that our interdisciplinary analgesic program of a single FNB placed 
immediately upon fracture diagnosis in the ED followed by a cFIB results in significantly 
improved pain control, lower rates of opioid-related side effects, and lower opioid 
requirements as compared to conventional analgesic therapy within one hour of presentation 
through POD 3. Our study builds upon prior research by extending the period of analgesia 
compared to studies that have only employed single blocks (either in the ED or immediately 
prior to surgery)23-27 and by providing analgesia immediately after presentation to the ED as 
compared to studies that employed continuous blocks at the time of surgery.28 Third, we 
have extended the work of Fletcher et al23 by demonstrating that emergency physicians can 
be trained effectively in ultrasound-guided FNB12 and that this procedure can be performed 
safely and efficaciously in 3 diverse EDs thus ensuring immediate and effective relief for hip 
fracture-related pain. Finally, we have demonstrated that placement of cFIB can be easily 
integrated into pre-operative hip fracture care by anesthesiologists using a mobile block 
service.13 In both settings – the ED and perioperative medical/surgical floors, blocks are 
well tolerated by patients, and do not appear to interfere with surgical repair, post-operative 
recovery, physical therapy, post-operative ambulation, nor are they associated with increased 
rates of complications.
There are several limitations to this study. Patients did not receive sham nerve blocks and it 
is possible that some of our observed results may have resulted from a placebo effect. Sham 
blocks were considered but rejected due to ethical concerns of subjecting patients to 
unnecessary pain and because our EP clinical partners refused to administer sham injections. 
Our control group consisted of patients receiving “usual pain care” and consistent with 
studies,5,14,29 pain management practice at all study sites was not reflective of expert 
guideline recommendations in terms of opioid dosing, use of regularly scheduled analgesics, 
and management of opioid side effects. Whereas one could argue that the provision of 
guideline appropriate opioid therapy might mitigate the differences in outcomes observed in 
our trial, two decades of research and quality improvement programs have failed to ensure 
that patients in pain receive adequate opioid therapy.30 Although the cFIB were well 
tolerated, 10% of intervention patients either requested that the catheter be discontinued or 
had the catheter become dislodged and elected not to have it reinserted. Enrollment in our 
study was limited to a specific population of hip fracture patients and as such, our results 
may not generalize to the hip fracture population as a whole. For example, we only enrolled 
patients who were able to self-report their pain and we do not have data on patients with 
advanced dementia. Given known disparities in treatment of pain in dementia patients,31 
they may benefit even more from these procedures than our study subjects. Other groups 
excluded included those on anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors and those who did not speak 
English, Spanish, or Russian. We were also not able to evaluate the maintenance of FNB 
skill among EPs over a period longer than 1 year. Nevertheless, ultrasound-guided 
procedures (vascular access, paracentesis, lumbar puncture, and other regional blocks) have

 become well integrated into EM practice, and are now considered fundamental components 
of emergency medicine.32 Finally, 29% of our sample could not be contacted at 6 weeks and 
it is possible that the improvements in function that we observed in the intervention group 
might not have persisted at this time frame had the full sample been available for analyses. 
Prior studies, albeit observational and non-randomized clinical trials, have shown similar 
improvements in post-discharge function associated with better pain management.5,14
In summary, this randomized controlled trial of regional nerve blocks and catheters to 
control hip fracture pain beginning at ED admission revealed important and novel findings. 
It is the largest and most rigorously designed study to date of the use of regional nerve 
blocks in this disease in older adults and provides the first randomized controlled trial data 
showing that reducing peri-operative pain improves functional outcomes. Our research, 
combined with prior smaller single site studies, supports the integration of regional nerve 
blocks into the routine care for hip fracture patients commencing with their presentation to 
the ED.

 Figure 1. CONSORT Diagram
Figure 1 details enrollment statistics and intervention protocols. Patients were eligible for 
inclusion if they were aged 60 years or older with a radiographically confirmed hip fracture 
(femoral neck, intertrochanteric, or peri-capsular). We excluded patients: with multiple 
trauma, cancer-related fractures, bilateral hip fractures, or previous fracture or surgery at the 
currently fractured site; transferred from another hospital; presenting greater than 48 hours 
after fracture; with a history of substance abuse as evidenced by an affirmative response to 
either of the first two items on the Drug Abuse Screening Test14 or documentation of a 
history of substance abuse in the medical record; who were delirious as determined by the 
Confusion Assessment Method (CAM);15 who did not speak English, Spanish, or Russian; 
with a history of an allergy or adverse reaction to bupivacaine/ropivicaine; with an allergy to 
opioid analgesics; with a bleeding diatheses, unable to self-report their pain, or with 
moderate cognitive impairment as documented by a score of 3 or less on the Callahan six 
item screener.16 Details regarding the 1004 excluded patients are as follows: Advanced 
dementia - 390, ruled out for hip fracture - 86, presented after study hours - 102, under age 
60 - 168, language barrier - 72, pathologic fracture - 68, over 48 hours at home before 
presenting to ED - 45, decision for non-operative management - 29, bilateral fracture - 17, 
substance abuse - 15, transferred from another hospital - 12. Following enrollment, subjects 
were randomized to FNB or conventional care using a stratified blocked randomization list 
with stratification by site. The block size for the randomization was randomly chosen for 
each block as either 2, 4 or 6 patients.33.
