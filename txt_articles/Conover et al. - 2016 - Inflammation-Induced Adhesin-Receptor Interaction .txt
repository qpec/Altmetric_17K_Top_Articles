SUMMARY
Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the dominant cause of urinary tract infections, clinically 
described as cystitis. UPEC express CUP pili, which are extracellular fibers tipped with adhesins 
that bind mucosal surfaces of the urinary tract. Here we identify the role of the F9/Yde/Fml pilus 
for UPEC persistence in the inflamed urothelium. The Fml adhesin FmlH binds galactose β1-3 N-
acetylgalactosamine found in core-1 and -2 O-glycans. Deletion of fmlH had no effect on UPEC 
virulence in an acute mouse model of cystitis. However, FmlH provided a fitness advantage during 
chronic cystitis, which is manifested as persistent bacteriuria, high bladder bacterial burdens and 
chronic inflammation. In situ binding confirmed that FmlH bound avidly to the inflamed, but not 
the naïve bladder. In accordance with its pathogenic profile, vaccination with FmlH significantly 
protected mice from chronic cystitis. Thus, UPEC employ separate CUP pili to adapt to the rapidly 
changing niche during bladder infection.

 Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) express extracellular, adhesion-tipped, fibers that bind 
mucosal surfaces of the urinary tract. Conover et al. show that urothelial glycome remodeling 
during ongoing UPEC bladder infection induces the emergence of an F9 pilus receptor, which 
enables F9 pilus-mediated adherence, late stage colonization and chronic UTI.
INTRODUCTION
Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common bacterial infections with 50% of 
women experiencing a UTI in their lifetime (Ikaheimo et al., 1996). Additionally, an initial 
acute infection has a 25–40% chance of a recurrent UTI (rUTI) within six months, even with 
appropriate antibiotic treatment (Czaja et al., 2009; Foxman et al., 2000; Stamm et al., 
1991). Further confounding this problem, UPEC, which cause ~80% of such infections, are 
becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant (Boucher et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Stamm, 
2002). Multidrug resistant UPEC increase the risk of UTIs progressing to life-threatening 
septicemia (Wagenlehner et al., 2015). Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand 
UPEC pathogenesis in order to inform treatment strategies and therapeutic development.
UPEC, like other gram-negative pathogens including Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, 
Haemophilus, Salmonella and Yersiniae utilize chaperone usher pathway (CUP) pili to 
mediate attachment to both biotic and abiotic surfaces (Nuccio and Baumler, 2007). These 
extracellular fibers mediate attachment through specific stereochemical interactions with 
target ligands, most often glycans (Lillington et al., 2014). UPEC encode multiple types of 
adhesive CUP pili. A recent analysis of available Escherichia sequences identified at 38 
distinct CUP pilus types based on usher phylogeny (Wurpel et al., 2013). Single Escherichia 
genomes have as many as 16 distinct CUP operons, many encoding two-domain adhesins 
that likely mediate colonization of a particular host and/or environmental habitat. For 
example, type 1 pili are critical for bladder colonization in cystitis, while P and S pili 
function in pyelonephritis and meningitis, respectively (Hultgren et al., 1985; Leffler and 
Svanborg-Eden, 1980; Saukkonen et al., 1988).

 UPEC utilize type 1 pili, and their tip adhesin FimH, to bind the urothelium through 
interactions with mannosylated uroplakins and α-1/β-3 integrins (Eto et al., 2007; Wu et al., 
1996). These FimH-mediated interactions facilitate bacterial colonization and invasion of 
terminally differentiated superficial umbrella cells (Mulvey et al., 1998; Mulvey et al., 
2001). After invasion, UPEC can be expulsed through a TRPML3 dependent mechanism or 
escape into the cytoplasm where a single bacterium can rapidly divide to form an 
intracellular bacterial community (IBC), which upon maturation, can contain ~104–5 bacteria 
(Anderson et al., 2003; Miao et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2011). IBCs are transient and upon 
maturation, UPEC can filament and flux out of these cells to initiate subsequent rounds of 
IBC formation (Justice et al., 2006). These distinct acute stages of UPEC infection that were 
first seen in mice are also observed in humans with UTI (Rosen et al., 2007) and has been 
correlated with increased risk of children developing a rUTI (Robino et al., 2013).
Acute infection can self-resolve or develop into a chronic cystitis characterized by: i) 
persistent, high titer bacteriuria (>104 colony forming units (CFU)/ml); ii) high titer bacterial 
bladder burdens at sacrifice >4 weeks post-infection (wpi); iii) chronic inflammation and 
urothelial necrosis; iv) lymphonodular hyperplasia in the bladder submucosa and; v) 
urothelial hyperplasia with a lack of uroplakin expression, which is a marker for terminal 
differentiation in superficial facet cells (Hannan et al., 2010). Similar histological findings 
have been observed in humans suffering persistent bacteriuria and rUTI (Hansson et al., 
1990; Schlager et al., 2011).
The function of FimH in pathogenesis has been well studied, however, E. coli carry 12 CUP 
operons on average per genome, inferring a depth and diversity of function (Wurpel et al., 
2013). Sequence comparison has revealed that the Fml/F9/Yde pilus is the closest related 
pilus to type 1 pili (Wurpel et al., 2013). Given the close relationship between these pili and 
the pathogenic role of FimH in UTI, we hypothesized that Fml pili may play a role in 
pathogenesis. In this study we report the structure of the Fml tip-associated adhesin, FmlH 
and its specificity for binding Gal(β1-3)GalNac epitopes. We demonstrate that FmlH 
functions in UPEC pathogenesis by providing a fitness advantage during chronic cystitis but 
not in acute cystitis. Consistent with these findings, FmlH binds to inflamed bladder tissue 
of chronically infected mice, but not to naïve bladder tissue. Further, we elucidated that 
chronic cystitis alters the glycan/galactose profile of mouse bladders, and UPEC expression 
of fml is upregulated in chronically infected bladders. We showed clinical relevance of these 
findings by demonstrating that FmlH binds human urothelial cells and uromodulin isolated 
from human urine. In addition, analysis of published data showed higher expression of 
FmlH in urines directly isolated from UTI patients compared to expression during in vitro 
growth in media or normal urine, suggesting host-specific Fml induction 
(Subashchandrabose et al., 2014). On the basis of these findings, we developed an FmlH 
vaccine, and showed significantly decreased bacterial colonization after the initial acute 
stages of infection with potential therapeutic implications.

 RESULTS
Role of F9 pili in UTI pathogenesis
Phylogenetic analysis of E. coli CUP operons shows type 1, S and F1C pili form a 
monophyletic cluster with F9 pili (fml; E. coli CFT073 c1931-c1936), suggesting they 
originated through gene duplication from a common ancestral CUP operon (Figure S1A,B) 
(Wurpel et al., 2013). Additionally, the presence of complete fml pilus operons was found to 
be enriched in UPEC isolates Figure S1A, (Wurpel et al., 2014) and transcriptomic data 
indicate that F9 pili are expressed in the urine of women with UTI (Subashchandrabose et 
al., 2014; Welch et al., 2002b). Thus, we investigated the function of F9 pili during UTI in 
well-established C3H/HeN mouse models of UTI (Hannan et al., 2010; Hopkins et al., 1996; 
Hopkins et al., 1998; Schwartz et al., 2011).
We performed competitive infections between the prototypical UPEC strain CFT073 and an 
isogenic strain (CFT073ΔfmlH) with a deletion of fmlH, which encodes the predicted 
adhesive subunit FmlH (Figure S1B) each carrying different antibiotic markers (Welch et al., 
2002a). Bacteriuria was monitored over a 28-day time course. One day post-infection (dpi) 
no difference in urine titers of these strains was observed. However, a competitive defect of 
CFT073ΔfmlH was evident in bacteriuria counts 3 dpi but was most clearly observed 10–28 
dpi (Figure 1A and S1D). At 28 dpi, CFT073ΔfmlH was outcompeted by CFT073 by ~1000 
and ~100 fold in the bladder and kidneys, respectively, as assessed by CFU determination of 
harvested tissue homogenates (Figure 1B and S1D). In vitro cultures showed no growth 
difference in CFT073 and CFT073ΔfmlH (Figure S1C), indicating the competitive defect of 
the mutant was specific to the in vivo context. Additionally, CFT073ΔfmlH:fmlH, a strain 
with fmlH reintegrated into the original deletion site, showed no significant competitive 
difference compared to CFT073 (Figure 1C and S1E). In single infections, CFT073ΔfmlH 
also exhibited attenuated virulence compared to CFT073 as observed by infection outcome. 
Only 17% of C3H/HeN mice infected with 1x108 cfu of CFT073ΔfmlH developed chronic 
infection, characterized by persistent bacteriuria and bladder inflammation (Figure S2), 
compared to 38% infected with CFT073 (Figure 1D). Thus, both single and competitive 
colonization profiles suggest that FmlH engages in critical interactions for the establishment 
and/or maintenance of chronic cystitis.
Identification of the FmlH receptor
To confirm FmlH is the F9 adhesin and to determine its glycan specificity, FmlH’s predicted 
N-terminal adhesin domain (FmlHAD, residues 1-158) was cloned, purified and binding 
profiles to the core H mammalian glycan array (Consortium for Functional Glycomics 
(CFG)). FmlHAD bound to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), Galβ1-3GalNAc as well as 
GlcNAc β1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAc, the latter two representing the basal structures of Core 1 
(commonly called Thomsen-Friedenreich or TF antigen) and Core 2 O-glycans, respectively 
(Figure 2A, Table S1). The array data indicated that additional modification in the 
GlcNAcβ1-6 branch of the Core 2 glycans is accepted, but suggested that the short 
Galβ1-3GalNAc – branch of the glycans needs to be unmodified and forms the common 
epitope of FmlH receptors (Table S1). Core 1 and 2 O-glycans are abundant in secreted 
mucosal proteins such as mucins, where they are frequently capped by terminal sialic acid

 (Table S1). We therefore performed in vitro enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 
using a model O-glycosylated mucosal protein, bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), with or 
without sialidase pre-treatment (Tsuji and Osawa, 1986). FmlHAD displayed robust binding 
upon enzymatic removal of terminal sialic acid residues to BSM, but showed little to no 
affinity to untreated BSM (Figure 2C). As controls, Peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Helix 
pomatia agglutinin (HPA), which recognize exposed Galβ1-3GalNAc or α-GalNAc 
respectively (Loris et al., 1994; Sanchez et al., 2006) displayed similar BSM binding 
patterns as FmlH with removal of terminal sialic acid enhancing binding (Figure S3B, C). In 
addition, in whole cell ELISA, CFT073 adhered to sialidase treated BSM and 
CFT073ΔfmlH showed decreased binding, which was restored by plasmid-based fmllH 
complementation, (Figure 2D).
To obtain relative binding affinities of FmlH for specific ligands we used Surface Plasmon 
Resonance (SPR). FmlHAD bound TF antigen and Core2 glycans with similar equilibrium 
dissociation constants (Kds) of 17.4μM and 12.2μM respectively, thus showing the Core2 
branch glycan (GlcNAcβ1-6) can be accommodated but does not add binding affinity 
(Figure 2B). Solution binding studies for the component monosaccharides of the 
Galβ1-3GalNAc epitope showed binding affinities of 625 and 961 μM for D-Gal and Tn 
(αGalNAc), respectively (Figure S3A). In accordance with the SPR data, the lactosyl 
disaccharide that is added in the Core2 branch of the glycans did not show a detectable 
binding interaction with the adhesin (Figure S3A). Thus, we propose that FmlH 
preferentially binds Galβ1-3GalNAc and terminal α-GalNAc, both of which are components 
of core-1 and 2 O glycans.
Structure-function correlates of FmlH
To gain insight into the molecular determinants of FmlH receptor interactions we determined 
the X-ray structures of FmlHAD in apo form and in complex with Galβ1-3GalNAc. Apo 
FmlHAD adopts a 12-stranded immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich topology closely 
resembling the FimH lectin domain structure (Choudhury et al., 1999) with a root mean 
squared deviation (RMSD) of 1.3 Å for 147 matching Cα residues (Figure 3A). In FimH, 
three loops connecting β-strands A1 and A2 (Loop 1, residues 6-15), B2 and C1 (Loop 2, 
residues 44-53) and F and G (Loop 3, residues 132-142) form a confined binding pocket that 
binds terminal D-mannose residues (Figure 3A, S4B). These three loops coincide with the 
regions with highest sequence and structural divergence between FimH and FmlH (Figure 
3A, S4A). Co-crystallization of FmlHAD with Galβ1-3GalNAc reveals the FmlH L1–L3 
loops constitute a TF antigen-binding site, equivalent to the FimH D-mannose binding 
pocket (Figure 3B). Similar to FimH, the FmlH-TF interaction is dominated by an extensive 
H-bond network with the terminal, non-reducing residue of the glycan epitope (Figure 3B, 
S4B). The terminal Gal residue makes a stacking interaction with Y46 and eight H-bond 
interactions with the FmlH binding pocket, compared to a single H-bond between Y46 and 
the β1-3GalNAc N-acetyl (Figure 3B, D). Mannose and galactose differ in configuration of 
the C2 and C4 stereogenic centers. Superimposition of the FimH oligomannose-3 (Wellens 
et al., 2008) and FmlH Galβ1-3GalNAc complexes shows residues at positions 132 and 134 
(Q and N for FimH vs. K and A for FmlH, respectively) play a prominent role in 
determining the monosaccharide binding specificities of the respective binding sites (Figure 
Conover et al.

 3D). The FmlH K132 - C3 hydroxyl interaction tilts the monosaccharide upwards and allows 
K132 to additionally bind Gal’s axial C4 hydroxyl. The upwards tilt also projects the 
equatorial C2 hydroxyl within H-bond distance of N140. In FimH, the C3 – Q133 H-bond 
pulls the mannose (Man) residue in a downward tilt, allowing Man’s axial C2 hydroxyl to 
H-bond with the F1 amine. Man’s equatorial C4 hydroxyl is H-bonded by the N135 (Figure 
3D). The binding topology of the Galβ1-3GalNAc – FmlH interaction explains the 
requirement for unmodified C3, C4 and C6 positions in the terminal Gal residues, and the 
requirement for sialic acid uncapping of Core 1 and 2 O-glycans for F9-mediated adherence 
(Figure 2). Superimposition of the Galβ1-3GalNAc – FmlH structure with an energy-
minimized Core 2 glycan shows that the GlcNAcβ1-6 residue in the Core 2 branch localizes 
above the FmlH molecular surface where it can accept further modifications (Figure S4D), 
in agreement with the binding profiles observed by glycan array (Table S1). Based on the 
very similar binding affinities for Core 2 and Core 1 glycans (Figure 2B) and the modeled 
binding position of the Core 2 GlcNAcβ1-6, no additional H-bond or stacking interactions 
are expected on top of the interaction with the Galβ1-3GalNAc epitope (Figure S4D).
For independent confirmation of the observed binding interactions, we examined the effects 
of selected mutations in the FmlH pocket residues on F9-mediated adherence. D53 was 
mutated to either a glutamic acid (D53E) or lysine (D53K) to alter charge and/or bulk inside 
the galactose-binding pocket. Additionally, K132 was changed to the FimH-like glutamine 
(K132Q), thus altering positioning and H-bonding capacity of Gal in the FmlH binding 
pocket. We found that D53E, D53K, and K132Q all dramatically decreased FmlHAD affinity 
for sialidase treated BSM to background levels (Figure 3C).
Binding of FmlH to human bladder cells and uromodulin
We next assessed the presence of FmlH receptor in immortalized urothelial cells by 
assessing binding to 5637 and T24 human bladder cells. Since bladder biopsies during 
clinical UTI are contraindicated due to risk of sepsis, bladder tissue from UTI patients is 
unavailable. The 5637 cell line originates from a male grade II bladder carcinoma and the 
T24 cells originate from a female transitional carcinoma (Bubenik et al., 1973; Fogh et al., 
1977). When these cells are grown in culture they resemble transitional urothelial cells since 
they do not differentiate into superficial facet cells, are rapidly dividing and do not express 
uroplakin on the cell surface (Eto et al., 2007). We found that FmlHAD, but not K132Q 
FmlHAD, bound to both of these cell lines, demonstrating that cells of an urothelial lineage 
can support FmlH binding (Figures 4A and S5). Additionally, we tested for the presence of 
FmlH receptors on secreted proteins in the UT. Far-western analysis of concentrated total 
human urine protein revealed binding of FmlHAD, but not FmlHAD K132Q, to a band of 
approximately ~85 KDa, identified as uromodulin by N-terminal sequencing (Figure 4B). 
Uromodulin is heavily O-glycosylated and contains possible FmlH binding epitopes 
including Gal(β1-3)GalNac (Chia-Yean Hong, 2013). Human uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall) 
is abundantly secreted by the kidneys into the urine (Tamm and Horsfall, 1950). This protein 
functions as an inhibitor of calcium crystallization and has been proposed to be part of an 
innate immune defense mechanism against UPEC by presenting soluble decoy receptors for 
the FimH adhesin (Bates et al., 2004; Pak et al., 2001). In an ELISA based technique both 
FimH and FmlH displayed a concentration-dependent binding to urine protein concentrates

 enriched for uromodulin; with FimH binding being 10 fold greater, possibly reflecting FimH 
nanomolar versus FmlH’s micromolar dissociation constants for their preferred epitopes 
(Figure 4C, D). FmlHAD K132Q and FimH Q133K, displayed little to no affinity in this 
assay (Figure 4C, D). Together these data suggest that the innate immune defense protein 
uromodulin may have in part evolved as a host defense against tissue binding via numerous 
UPEC adhesins.
FmlH-mediated host-pathogen interactions in the urinary tract
Many aspects of host-pathogen interactions, as well as disease outcomes and host responses 
observed in human UTIs have been successfully replicated in the mouse model UTI 
(Garofalo et al., 2007; Hannan et al., 2014; Rosen et al., 2007). Since fmlH deletion 
decreased virulence during chronic infection (Figure 1), we examined the spatio-temporal 
distribution of the FmlH receptors in the mouse UT. Microscopic analysis of an FmlHAD-
mCherry fusion protein (FmlHADmC) was used to probe binding to inflamed and naïve 
bladder and kidney tissue sections in situ. Kidney tissue supported strong FmlHADmC 
binding in both naïve and chronically infected mice (Figure 5A and S6A). This staining 
appeared to correlate with staining of the distal convoluted tubules (Figure 5A and S6B). In 
contrast, FmlHADmC displayed little to no affinity for naïve bladder tissue (Figure 5F), but 
bound avidly to tissue sections from infected (inflamed) bladders (Figure 5I). FmlH bound 
throughout the transitional urothelial cell layer, which due to the exfoliation of the 
superficial cells during acute cystitis, is exposed on the luminal surface of the bladder. Thus, 
our data argue for a constitutive exposure of the FmlH receptor in mouse kidney, but suggest 
that the FmlH receptor only becomes exposed during the inflammatory response to infection 
that leads to a shift or modification of the glycan expression profile.
During chronic/recurrent UTI the bladder becomes markedly inflamed and hyperplastic, 
denoting a dramatically altered tissue compared to the naïve bladder, as described and 
reviewed in (Hannan et al., 2010; Hannan et al., 2014; Hannan et al., 2012; O’Brien et al., 
2015). Further, proteomic studies showed that chronic cystitis results in urothelial 
remodeling that persists even after antibiotic therapy and into convalescence (Hannan et al., 
2014). In the kidney, PNA appeared to co-localize with FmlHADmC binding (Figure 5E) and 
recognition of both was abolished by prior O-glycosidase treatment (Figure 5C–D), 
suggesting that in the kidney FmlH binds O-linked polysaccharides that contain uncapped 
Galβ1-3GalNAc. However, in the bladder, PNA staining was not observed in either chronic 
or naïve bladder tissue (Figure 5G,J). Prior sialidase treatment did not reveal significant 
urothelial PNA or FmlHADmC staining in naïve urothelium (Figure S6C,E,F), indicating that 
the lack of binding was not due to the capping of O-glycans by terminal sialic acid. 
Additionally, O-glycosidase treatment of chronic bladder tissue did not prevent FmlHADmC 
staining (Figure S6D), suggesting FmlH is not binding mature O-glycans in the bladder. Our 
glycan array shows that besides Galβ1-3GalNAc, FmlHAD can also bind terminal α-N-
acetylgalactosamine (Figure 2). Staining with HPA as a reporter for terminal α-N-
acetylgalactosamine demonstrated affinity to the transitional epithelial cells in chronic 
bladder sections, as well as the basal membrane in both naïve and chronic bladders (Figure 
5H,K). Sialidase treatment did not influence HPA staining on either chronic or naïve bladder 
sections (Figure S6G,H). While FmlHADmC did not bind the basal membrane in the bladder

 (Figure 5F), its inflammation-induced binding in the transitional cell layer during chronic 
cystitis is very similar to that seen for HPA (Figure 5K). Treatment of chronic bladder 
sections with alpha-N-acetyl-galactosaminidase decreased FmlHADmC and HPA binding, 
especially in the transitional cell layer (Figure 5L,N). Further, co-staining of chronic bladder 
with HPA and FmlHADmC resulted in an overlap of signal (Figure 5M) suggesting binding of 
a similar ligand or structure. Thus our staining analyses suggest that FmlH, at least in part, 
recognizes αGalNAc that becomes exposed in the bladder during an inflammatory response 
to infection.
FmlH and FmlH receptor expression during chronic cystitis
The dramatic increase in the affinity of FmlH for the inflamed bladder epithelium suggests 
that the glycan, and more specifically the terminal Gal and GalNAc profiles of the 
urothelium change during chronic cystitis. Notably, Ser-/Thr-linked αGalNAc (Tn antigen) 
forms the precursor of O-glycan synthesis. Tn antigen is rare on healthy tissues, but changes 
in tissue homeostasis, including inflammation and malignant transformation, can result in a 
stalled O-glycan maturation and Tn antigen accumulation (Ju et al., 2011). We, thus, 
performed qPCR on naïve and chronic bladder samples and found that c1galt, galnt3, 
b3gnt3, b4galnt1, ggta1 and galnt4 were all upregulated during chronic cystitis (Figure 6A). 
C1GALT, and the polypeptide GalNAc transferases GALNT4 and GALNT3, catalyze the 
synthesis of the TF and the Tn antigens, respectively. Further, FmlH has been shown to be 
upregulated in E. coli found in the urine of women with UTI (Subashchandrabose et al., 
2014). Thus, we performed qPCR on tissue-associated CFT073 harvested from chronically 
infected bladders 28 dpi. We observed that expression of fmlA, the major F9 subunit, was 
increased approximately 6 fold during chronic cystitis when compared to the inoculum 
(Figure 6B). While the expression pattern of fimI, a representative gene of the fim locus, 
revealed no further induction of type 1 pili relative to the inoculum (Figure 6B). Thus, it 
appears that as the host bladder is being remodeled by chronic infection, UPEC is adapting 
to this environment by upregulating the FmlH adhesin whose receptors are being revealed 
during this process.
FmlH vaccination
We hypothesized that vaccination with FmlH would protect against chronic/recurrent cystitis 
when the bladder becomes inflamed, similar to the protection against acute UTI seen with 
FimH vaccination (Firon et al., 1987; Langermann and Ballou, 2001; Langermann et al., 
2000). To test this we vaccinated mice with 30μg of FmlHAD in Freund’s complete adjuvant 
for 4 weeks before boosting with a second 30μg dose in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Mice 
were challenged with CFT073 4 weeks after boost and bacterial titers were assessed 1, 2 and 
3 dpi. One dpi there was no significant difference in bacterial load between the mock 
vaccinated animals or the ones vaccinated with FmlHAD (Figure 7). However, by 2 and 3 dpi 
a significant decrease in UPEC colonization was seen in mice that received the FmlHAD 
vaccine (Figure 7). While we did not measure inflammatory readouts at these time points, 
the bacterial load is significantly diminished compared to mock vaccination. Thus, 
vaccination with FmlHAD protected against UPEC colonization during the chronic stages of 
infection when FmlH plays a significant role in host-pathogen interactions.

 DISCUSSION
Progression from acute to chronic cystitis is accompanied by a loss of superficial facet cells 
through exfoliation; an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear lymphocytes 
and CD45+ cells and; a hyperplastic transitional epithelial cell layer which is poorly 
differentiated, containing few terminally differentiated umbrella cells accounting for the lack 
of uroplakin III staining, a marker of superficial cell differentiation (Hannan et al., 2010; 
Hannan et al., 2014). Markers of inflammation are also present in the lamina propria where 
lymphoid-like CD45+ follicle-like aggregates are histologically visible. This is a much 
altered environment compared to the naive bladder first encountered by UPEC during acute 
cystitis. Herein we present evidence of UPEC adaptation to the changing UTI environment 
by expressing a Gal/GalNAc recognizing adhesin at the same time as alteration to the host 
glycan expression are occurring in the inflamed bladder habitat. We discovered that FmlH is 
expressed during chronic inflammation. Others have shown that FmlH is expressed during 
human UTI (Subashchandrabose et al., 2014). Our structural and binding analysis revealed 
that FmlH binds Gal(β1-3)GalNAc as its primary ligand, but also displays affinity to its 
precursor, αGalNAc. Our histological studies suggest that FmlH binds, at least in part, to 
αGalNAc exposed during chronic cystitis. While the proteinaceous ligand for FmlH during 
chronic cystitis is unknown, it is likely connected with a Tlr4 inflammatory process since 
Tlr4 is necessary for CFT073, and other stains, to cause chronic cystitis in the C3H 
background (our unpublished results and (Hannan et al., 2010)). Alternately, in the kidney, 
FmlH appears to bind constitutively exposed Gal(β1-3)GalNAc, often found in core 1 and 2 
O-glycans, possibly reflecting the kidney epithelia’s secretion of glycoproteins like Muc1 
and uromodulin.
Glycan alteration in response to disease has been well documented in the bladder. Previous 
reports have shown diabetes alters the expression of several sugar moieties in the bladder 
including mannose, galactose and N-acetlyglucosamine (Ozer et al., 2015). These changes 
likely provide receptors that can be recognized by adhesins such as FimH and FmlH. In fact, 
previous reports have shown that FimH displays increased affinity to the diabetic bladder 
compared to non-diabetic controls (Geerlings et al., 2002; Ozer et al., 2015). Further, our 
results (Figure 6) are in agreement with the glycan remodeling seen in a recent study of the 
mouse bladder transcriptome during chronic cystitis, which revealed the alteration of many 
glycosyl transferases including 20 involved in modifying the galactose epitopes such as 
C1GALT, GALNT4, B3GNT3 and GALNT3 that can make or modify Gal(β1-3)GalNAc 
(Schwartz et al., 2015). Finally, studies looking at specific lectin binding to naïve and 
inflamed rat bladders chronically exposed to UPEC showed a very similar phenotype to 
what we observe in mice with increased expression of Gal and GalNAc epitopes (Nakagawa 
et al., 1996).
Bladder remodeling associated with UTI, including superficial cell exfoliation, chronic 
inflammation and urothelial hyperplasia, has been well documented in mice (Hannan et al., 
2014). Similar phenotypes are associated with human UTI where exfoliation, IBCs and 
inflammation routinely occur with UPEC infection (Czaja et al., 2009; Rosen et al., 2007). 
Additionally, biomarkers associated with myeloid cell development and chemotaxis have 
been shown to be elevated in individuals who are prone to rUTI, suggesting an altered

 bladder environment in this population (Hannan et al., 2014). While these similarities to the 
mouse model and data presented herein infer a role for FmlH in human disease, further 
studies are needed to determine whether FmlH plays a similar role in binding the inflamed 
bladder in humans as it does in mice. Notably, FmlH has also been shown to be upregulated 
between 4 and 64 fold in bacteria recovered in each of 5 human UTI urine samples/isolates 
compared to growth in standard LB conditions (Subashchandrabose et al., 2014). 
Interestingly, this upregulation was most dramatic in urines taken directly from human UTI 
and tempered when grown in vitro in normal human urine suggesting that the host-specific 
induction we see in our mouse model may also take place within the inflamed human 
bladder during clinical UTI.
It has been well documented that antibiotic resistance is increasing among UPEC isolates, 
thus evoking a need for alternate therapeutics. Therapeutic/preventitive strategies targeting 
bacterial adhesion have shown promise including small molecules called mannosides that 
bind to the FimH binding pocket with 106 greater potency than mannose and have been 
shown to be orally bioavailable and potent in treating UTI in a mouse model (Cusumano et 
al., 2011a; Han et al., 2012). Further, a FimCH vaccine has been developed that elicits 
protection against UTI in mouse and monkey models and currently is in phase 1 clinical 
trials (Cusumano et al., 2011b; Langermann and Ballou, 2001; Langermann et al., 2000) 
(Gary Eldridge, personal communication). We show that vaccination with purified FmlH 
lectin domain is sufficient to decrease UPEC burden as early as 2dpi. This data implies that 
inhibition of FmlH reduces UPEC colonization making it, or an FmlH/FimH combination, 
another possible target for improved vaccination techniques or galactose analogue inhibition 
similar to mannosides with FimH.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Strains and Plasmids
The pyelonephritis isolate CFT073 was utilized as the wild type isolate for these studies. 
CFT073ΔfmlH was constructed using the λ Red Recombinase system to insert a kanamycin 
cassette in place of fmlH (Table S3). Complementation of CFT073ΔfmlH was accomplished 
by cloning the fmlH gene into pTRC99a using Kpn1 and Xba1 sites (Table S3). 
CFT073ΔfmlH:fmlH was constructed by homologous recombination to reintegrate fmlH 
into the ΔfmlH strain using homologous recombination with a modified λ Red Recombinase 
system (Khetrapal et al., 2015).
Mouse experiments
UPEC strains were grown statically in LB at 37°C overnight and then subcultured 1:1,000 
into 10 ml of fresh LB for a second static outgrowth at 37°C for 18 to 24 h. From these 
cultures, 1x108 bacteria suspended in PBS were inoculated into lightly anesthetized 
C3H/HeN mice transurethrally in a 50μl injection. For competitive infections, strains were 
inoculated with equal CFU of CFT073, ΔfmlH or ΔfmlH:fmlH carrying either 
chloramphenicol or kanamycin resistance markers. Infections proceeded for 28 days with 
urines collected at indicated time points before sacrifice under anesthesia, and the bladders 
and kidneys were removed and homogenized in sterile PBS. Homogenates were plated for

 bacterial enumeration. Competitive infections were initiated by mixing 1x108 bacteria from 
each indicated strain in the inoculum. These strains carried different antibiotic markers, 
which allowed for the tracking of bacterial titers of the individual strains throughout the time 
course. For competitive infections, sterile urines were processed as the limit of detection for 
determining the competitive index. As previously published, most C3H/HeN mice (~60%) 
are capable of resolving an acute UTI (Hannan et al., 2010). Mice that developed persistent 
bacteriuria (>104 cfu/ml) were considered chronically infected, as has been shown 
previously to be predictive of chronic cystitis (Hannan et al., 2010). All animal studies using 
mice were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University (Animal 
Protocol Number 20120216).
FmlH constructs and purification
FmlHAD corresponds to the first 158 amino acids of mature FmlH (CFT073). The 
corresponding gene sequence was cloned into expression vector pDEST14 with its natural 
leader and a 6 His tag and stop codon incorporated at the 3′ end. FmlHADmC corresponds to 
FmlHAD with mCherry fused between the FmlHAD C-teminus and the 6 His tag. All 
proteins were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli C43(DE3). Periplasmic extracts were 
dialyzed against 1xPBS, bound to a Cobalt (Goldbio) column and eluted with 1xPBS and 
200mM imidazole. Pooled fractions containing FmlHAD were dialyzed against 20mM Tris 
pH 8.4 and applied to a Source 15Q and eluted at 100mM NaCl.
Crystallization and structure determination
FmlHAD (8mg mL−1) was crystallized using sitting drop vapor diffusion against a solution 
containing 0.1M Citrate pH2, 1M Ammonium sulfate. FmlHAD crystals were flashed cooled 
to 100K in 0.1M Citrate pH2, 1M Ammonium sulfate and 30% glycerol. For co-
crystallization, His-tagged FmlHAD (24mg ml−1) was incubated with 1mM Thomsen-
Friedenreich sugar (TF: Galβ1-3GalNAc) (Lectinity, Russia). Data for FmlHAD apo (1.75 
Å) and FmlHAD-TF (2.2 Å) were collected at beamline i04 (Diamond Light Source, Didcot, 
UK). Data were indexed and processed with XDS and XSCALE (Kabsch, 2010), phased by 
molecular replacement [Phaser (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994)] using 
coordinates of FimH (PDB:2VCO) and refined using Refmac5.5 (The CCP4 suite: programs 
for protein crystallography., 1994). Data and refinement statistics in Table S2.
Vaccination
FmlHAD was emulsified in Freud’s complete adjuvant at a final concentration of 300μg/ml. 
C3H/HeN mice were injected subcutaneously with 100μl of this emulsion for an effective 
dose of 30μg per animal. Mock-vaccinated animals received PBS emulsified in the same 
concentrations of the adjuvant. Four weeks after initial injection, a boost dose of 30μg of 
FmlH or PBS emulsified in Freud’s incomplete adjuvant was given to each vaccinated 
animal and control animals, respectively. Anti-FmlH titers were monitored throughout the 
time course to assess antibody response. Mice were challenged with 2x108 CFU of CFT073 
inoculated transurethrally 4 weeks after boost. Animals were sacrificed 1, 2 and 3 dpi and 
the bacterial titers were assessed in the bladder and kidneys. These time points were chosen 
since naïve aged mice are relatively resistant to chronic cystitis.

 Figure 1. FmlH enhances UPEC colonization during chronic cystitis
(A) The log competitive infection urine titers of C3H/HeN mice infected with equal 
numbers of CFT073 or CFT073ΔfmlH over 28 days. 20 mice were infected over the course 
of 2 experiments, 7 developed chronic cystitis. (B) Tissue log competitive indexes of mice 
chronically infected with CFT073 vs. CFT073ΔfmlH or CFT073 vs. CFT073 as controls 28 
dpi. Asterisk denotes p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test. (C) Complementation of fmlH restores 
virulence during chronic cystitis, 10 mice infected and 4 developed chronic cystitis. B and K 
represent the bladder and kidney titers 28dpi, respectively. (D) Rates of chronic cystitis 
development in C3H/HeN mice infected with CFT073 (11/29) or ΔfmlH (4/29) as 
represented by bladder bacterial burden 28dpi. Asterisk denotes p<0.05, Fisher’s exact test. 
Bars represent the mean of each data set.

 Figure 3. FmlHAD-TF structure and binding specificity
(A) Superimposition of ribbon representation of FmlHAD (tan) and FimH (PDB 2VCO; light 
blue) lectin domains. The binding pocket regions of FmlHAD (red) and FimH (blue) are 
formed by loops L1, L2 and L3. (B) Close-up view of the binding pocket region (L1, L2 and 
L3) of FmlHAD bound to Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) carbohydrate (Galβ1-3GalNAc; cyan; 
Gal and GalNAc are labeled A and B, respectively). H bonds are depicted in yellow dashed 
lines. Inset, schematic representation of the Ser/Thr-Galβ1-3GalNAc motif (TF). (C) 
Selected point mutants in the FmlHAD binding pocket abolish FmlHAD binding to sialidase 
treated BSM. (D) Close-up view of FmlHAD (red) and FimH (blue), bound to TF or oligo-
mannose 3, respectively (only the reducing end Gal (cyan) or Man (magenta) are shown for 
comparison). H bonds are depicted in pink (for Gal/FmlHAD) or light blue (for Man/FimH) 
dashed lines.
