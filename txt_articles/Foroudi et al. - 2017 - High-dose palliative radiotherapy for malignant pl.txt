Abstract
Introduction: High-dose
radiotherapy
to
the
hemithorax
for
patients
with
malignant pleural mesothelioma is a controversial treatment. Between 2003
and 2013 our institution had a policy of giving hemithoracic radiotherapy to at
least 45 Gy. This retrospective study reports survival, progression and toxicity
associated with this policy.
Methods: Seventy-one patients with pleural mesothelioma were irradiated with
doses of 45–60 Gy. Conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to the lower hemithorax
was used for 17 and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the whole
hemithorax for 54 patients. All patients have been followed up for at least
2 years from commencement of radiotherapy.
Results: Sixty-four patients (90%) completed planned radiotherapy and seven
stopped early, usually due to progressive disease. Median overall survival was
9.5 months (95% CI: 7.7–12.4) and median progression-free survival was
4.9 months (95% CI: 4.4–5.8). Eighty-seven per cent of patients progressed
or died within 2 years: 25% in-field, 49% outside the RT field and 13% died
without progression. Severe toxicity (grade 3–5) was observed in 53% of 3D-
CRT and 78% of IMRT patients, most commonly pulmonary fibrosis 27%, radi-
ation dermatitis 18%, dyspnoea 11%, GGT increased 11%, pneumonitis 10%,
pleuritic pain 8% and fatigue 8%. There were two, possibly three, treatment-
related deaths.
Conclusion: High-dose radiotherapy to the hemithorax caused significant toxic-
ity to most patients with no improvement in survival. Lower doses of radio-
therapy to limited volumes may be useful for palliative purposes.
Key words: high dose; mesothelioma; radiotherapy; survival.
Introduction
The optimal management of malignant pleural mesothe-
lioma is controversial, principally because it is a rare
malignancy with few randomised trials to guide therapy.
Australia has one of the world’s highest incidences of this
disease due to the widespread use of asbestos products,
with about 700 cases diagnosed annually.1 The survival
rate has changed little since the 1970s with median sur-
vival from diagnosis of 9 months, and very rare long-
term survivors.2–4
Radical surgery for mesothelioma has high rates of
severe side effects and local relapse, with many institu-
tions abandoning extrapleural pneumonectomy in favour
of less morbid pleurectomy/decortications or even more
palliative procedures.5 Chemotherapy produces modest
benefits with few durable responses.6 Use of radiother-
apy alone with a curative intent for unresectable disease
has
traditionally
been
considered
impractical
as
the
target volumes would typically exceed normal tissue tol-
erance limits.7,8 Prior to 3-dimensional conformal radio-
therapy, doses of 50 Gy alone were associated with a
treatment-related mortality rate of at least 16% and no
improvement in survival.9 It has been shown in retro-
spective studies that doses greater than 40 Gy improve
local control but are limited by dose constraints for the
remaining lung tissue.10
A recent randomised trial failed to demonstrate any
benefit
of
radiotherapy
given
after
chemotherapy
and extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma.11

 Nevertheless, there are reports of high-dose radiother-
apy after pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortica-
tion,
which
are
used
to
argue
for
an
aggressive
approach.12
Intensity-modulated
radiation
therapy
(IMRT)
was
originally
developed
for
small
tumours
with
limited
motion, and then adapted to the large surgical bed for
malignant pleural mesothelioma by investigators at the
MD Anderson Cancer Center.13,14 The goal of developing
IMRT technique is to improve the therapeutic ratio of giv-
ing a higher dose to areas at risk while sparing the nor-
mal abutting structures. An IMRT technique generally
results in a more heterogeneous dose distribution, with a
larger volume of normal tissue receiving low-dose radia-
tion than standard two- and three- dimensional tech-
niques. Several studies have shown improved toxicity
profiles and local control with IMRT after pleurectomy/
decortication.15–17 In addition, helical tomotherapy, a
form of IMRT that uses a rotational gantry system, has
also shown promise in the adjuvant treatment of pleural
mesothelioma in terms of improved local control with
acceptable toxicity reported.18
In 2003, our institution commenced a programme that
offered
highly
conformal
high-dose
radiotherapy
for
treatment of mesothelioma patients who were not candi-
dates for radical surgery. Three-dimensional conformal
radiotherapy
(3D-CRT)
was
initially
utilised
followed
by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Functional
imaging with 18F-FDG PET scans was also used consis-
tently. Feigen et al. published the results of the first 14
treated patients in 2011.19 It was believed that toxicities
from radiation damage to normal tissues surrounding the
cancer deposits could be limited by new radiotherapy
techniques (3D-CRT and IMRT). The aim of this study is
to present the long-term survival and toxicity outcomes
of highly conformal high-dose radiotherapy for malignant
pleural mesothelioma at our institution.
Methods
All patients gave written consent at our institution for the
radiation
treatment.
This
retrospective
analysis
was
approved by our institutional human ethics committee in
August 2014. All patients with histologically confirmed
pleural
mesothelioma
treated
at
our
institution
with
planned doses of at least 45 Gy were reviewed for this
study. They were all staged clinically with 18F-FDG PET/
CT scans following the International Mesothelioma Inter-
est Group Staging System.20 Of the 74 patients who met
these inclusion criteria, three with prior extrapleural
pneumonectomy were excluded from this analysis. The
remaining 71 patients commenced radiotherapy between
31 July 2003 and 15 July 2013.
The most common pattern of early recurrence is deep
in the costophrenic recess, most often from inadequate
resection of mesothelioma: hence the rationale for this
volume being treated post-operatively with radiotherapy.
The
programme
began
in
July
2003
using
3D-CRT,
targeting
areas
of
high
FDG-avidity
located
in
the
hemithorax. In April 2006 the first patient was treated
with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), when it
became available at our centre, and this became stan-
dard practice from January 2009. With the introduction
of IMRT the target volume was increased to encompass
the entire hemithorax as it had been noted that the unir-
radiated portion of the affected hemithorax was the main
site of disease failure in the earlier patients. Altogether
17 patients were treated with 3D-CRT and 54 with IMRT.
In the 3D-CRT cases the gross tumour volume within
the hemithorax was contoured with a 1–2-cm margin,
and in the IMRT cases the full hemithorax, including the
full hemi-diaphragm and chest wall, was irradiated using
the PET scan to define FDG-avid masses for boost doses.
All patients underwent a course of megavoltage radio-
therapy
of
45–60 Gy
in
1.8–2.4 Gy
fractions
over
6 weeks. The planned target volume (PTV) was generally
prescribed 50.4–54 Gy and sites of high-18F-FDG avidity
received simultaneous integrated boosts of 6–10 Gy over
the treatment course. Dosimetry parameters were calcu-
lated at the time of planning and re-calculated retrospec-
tively for this study for all patients and compared to dose
constraints specified for liver, oesophagus, thecal sac,
heart, contralateral lung and contralateral kidney.
Patients were followed up with clinical assessments
and CT scans and those who were geographically acces-
sible had repeat PET/CT scans. Serum mesothelin levels
were repeated if they were elevated at presentation. Tox-
icities were recorded by the treating radiation oncologist
and others, and reviewed and graded according to the
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 4.0 retrospectively by one
of two senior radiation oncologists (MW, FF).21 Toxicities
based on laboratory tests were graded only for the first 6
months after ceasing treatment: subsequent tests were
considered more likely to reflect progression of disease
or subsequent chemotherapy rather than radiotherapy.
Data were entered into a database and thoroughly
checked
by
an
experienced
data
manager
(FP).
All
patients were followed up to death or the close-out date
(12 March 2015), whichever was earlier. Overall and pro-
gression-free survival from commencement of radiother-
apy was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, with
censoring of times at the close-out date.22 For overall
survival the events counted were deaths from any cause.
For progression-free survival, the events counted were
the first progression of mesothelioma at any site or
death
without
progression.
The
Brookmeyer–Crowley
method was used to obtain 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for median survival times and the logit transforma-
tion was used to obtain 95% CIs for percentages surviv-
ing at 1 and 2 years. Subgroups were compared using
the Mantel–Cox log rank test. The cumulative incidences
of in-field progression, out-of-field progression and death
without progression were estimated from the progres-
sion-free survival curve using the method of Kalbfleisch

 and Prentice.23 Simultaneous in-field and out-of-field
progressions, as well as progressions at unknown site,
were counted as in-field progressions in the cumulative
incidence curve. The median follow-up time was esti-
mated using the reverse Kaplan–Meier method, in which
deaths are censored and being alive at the close-out date
is counted as the event. The worst grades of each toxic-
ity
were
calculated
and
the
crude
incidences
were
reported. Actuarial estimates of toxicity incidences (i.e.
cumulative incidence from a competing risks analysis of
toxicity and death) were not indicated due to the com-
pleteness of follow-up.
Comparisons of continuous variables between the two
RT techniques were done using the Wilcoxon rank sum
test.24
Results
Fifty-six patients (79%) were male and the median age at
commencement of radiotherapy was 64 years (range 45–
81). Patient and tumour characteristics prior to commenc-
ing radiotherapy are summarised in Table 1. There were
no stage I cases and 83% had advanced stage III–IV dis-
ease. Time from diagnosis to commencement of radio-
therapy ranged from 2 to 69 months (median 9 months)
and was significantly longer for the IMRT patients (3D-CRT
median
6.2 months,
IMRT
median
11.1 months,
P = 0.0001). This was probably because 87% of the 54
IMRT patients had received prior chemotherapy compared
to only 24% of the 17 3D-CRT patients. Altogether 51
patients (72%) received prior chemotherapy (usually
pemetrexed
with
either
cisplatin
or
carboplatin),
38
(54%)
debulking
surgery
(pleurectomy/decortication)
and 35 (49%) pleurodesis. One patient had prior radio-
therapy to the chest wall (21 Gy in three fractions using
electrons) to prevent port site recurrence. Most patients
had good performance status (ECOG 0–1) but eight were
ECOG grade 2 and two were ECOG 3 prior to radiotherapy.
Pre-radiotherapy tests showed that 27 patients (38%)
had abnormal haematological function, mainly grade 1–2
anaemia, 24 (34%) had abnormal liver function (ALP, ALT
or GGT grade 1–3) and 7 (10%) had abnormal renal func-
tion (creatinine grade 1–2), probably due to their disease
or prior chemotherapy. Soluble mesothelin-related pep-
tides within 3 months prior to radiotherapy were recorded
for 43 patients (61%). Of these, 18 were within the nor-
mal range (≤1.5 gmol/L) and 25 were above normal
(range 1.6–170 gmol/L).
Radiotherapy
Seventeen patients were treated with 3D-CRT and 54
patients received IMRT. Patients were planned to receive
doses of megavoltage radiotherapy ranging from 45 to
60 Gy over 6 weeks, all as outpatients. The prescribed
dose,
including
concomitant
boost,
was
significantly
higher for IMRT than for the 3D-CRT patients (3D-CRT
median 50.4, range 45–60 Gy; IMRT median 60, range
54–60 Gy, P < 0.0001). The PTV was also significantly
larger for the IMRT patients (median 6.5 L, range 2.4–
9.6 L) than for the 3D-CRT patients (median 2.9 L, range
1.4–6.3 L) (P < 0.0001). In some cases the PTV did not
encompass all disease sites because of dose constraints
for normal tissue. Despite this, planned doses to the
liver, oesophagus, thecal sac, heart, contralateral lung
and contralateral kidney exceeded pre-specified dose
constraints in 13%, 6%, 6%, 72%, 13% and 1% of
cases respectively (Table 2).
Seven patients (one 3D-CRT, six IMRT) did not com-
plete their treatment, six due to progressive disease and
one chose to miss the last fraction. Five patients (one
3D-CRT, four IMRT) had treatment breaks of more than
3 days: two due to toxicity, two due to machine mainte-
nance or public holidays and one for replanning after the
first fraction.

High-dose palliative RT for mesothelioma
799
 Four 3D-CRT patients and 1 IMRT (7%) had subse-
quent courses of palliative radiotherapy to the chest for
recurrence, 25 (35%) had subsequent pleurodesis and
27 (38%) subsequent chemotherapy.
Treatment outcomes
Eight patients remained alive at the close-out date,
including four without progression. Follow-up time for liv-
ing
patients
was
at
least
25 months
(median
48 months). One patient has survived 10.2 years but the
survival graphs were curtailed at 5 years in order to
show more detail in the early years. Of the 63 deaths, 51
were due to mesothelioma (one complicated with possi-
bly RT-related myelitis), 2 due to radiation pneumonitis,
1 due to another cancer (melanoma), 3 due to other
causes (two stroke, one pulmonary embolus) and 6
unknown (probably
mesothelioma). Estimated overall
median survival time was 9.5 months, with 42% surviv-
ing at 1 year and 18% at 2 years (Table 3, Fig. 1). The
survival of patients treated with 3D-CRT was similar to
that of the IMRT patients. As expected, patients with
good
pre-treatment
performance
status
(ECOG
0–1)
survived longer than those with ECOG 2–3 performance
status
(median
11.1 months
versus
4.9 months,
P = 0.021).
Nine patients (13%) first progressed in the radiother-
apy field, 37 (52%) outside the field, 10 (14%) both in
and outside simultaneously and 2 (3%) with the sites
not specified. Nine patients (13%) died without docu-
mented progression. Median progression-free survival
time was estimated to be 4.9 months for the whole
group and 4.4 and 5.4 months for the 3D-CRT and IMRT
patients respectively (Table 3). At 2 years following com-
mencement of radiotherapy the cumulative incidence
graph showed that 25% of patients (SE 5.2%) had first
progressed in the RT field (including concurrent and non-
specific progressions), 49% (SE 5.9%) outside the field
and 13% had died without progression being recorded
(SE 3.9%) (Fig. 2). The remaining 13% were alive with-
out progression at 2 years (Table 3).
Toxicities
Severe toxicity (grade 3–5) was observed in nine 3D-CRT
patients (53%, CI 28–77%) and 42 IMRT patients (78%,
CI 64–88%). The most common severe toxicities were
pulmonary fibrosis in 27% of patients, radiation der-
matitis

Discussion
In this retrospective study of patients treated with high-
dose palliative radiotherapy at our institution between
2003 and 2013 we estimated median overall survival
from
the
commencement
of
radiotherapy
to
be
9.5 months with 18% surviving at 2 years, and median
progression-free survival to be 4.9 months with 13%
surviving without progression at 2 years. Within the first
2 years the sites of first progression were in the radio-
therapy field in 25% of patients, outside the field in
49%, and 13% died without progression. Severe toxicity
(grade 3 or worse) was experienced by 72% of patients,
with two, possibly three, treatment-related deaths.
Patients were offered high-dose radiotherapy because
they had advanced disease or had already progressed
after chemotherapy or surgery. Their options were lim-
ited. Of the 71 patients irradiated, 13 survived more than
2 years and 1 more than 10 years after commencing RT.
The patient who survived more than 10 years had stage
II epithelioid mesothelioma and was ECOG 0 before com-
mencing radiotherapy. He was treated with 50.4 Gy 3D-
CRT and progressed more than 4 years later. He had sub-
sequent chemotherapy and a second course of palliative
radiotherapy of 50 Gy to the ipsilateral chest avoiding
overlap and at the close-out date his recurrent disease
was progressing very slowly.
Radiotherapy has a role for palliative management of
patients with mesothelioma, with studies showing effec-
tive palliation is associated with doses ≥40 Gy, although
lower doses have also been found to be effective.25,26
However, most studies have had small numbers, have
used outdated radiotherapy techniques, and measures of
control were not standardised. Although the patients in
our cohort were not formally assessed for palliative
response, most of them did not have a symptomatic
benefit from the radiotherapy.
The previous paper from our institution by Feigen
et al. reported on 14 patients with follow-up PET scans
who had median survival of 17 months from commence-
ment of radiotherapy. However, seven patients, who did
not receive PET scans after treatment, were excluded,
which would largely explain the apparently better sur-
vival.19 In addition, the Kaplan–Meier method of survival
analysis was not used in that analysis. Abstracts on vari-
ous subgroups have been published in conference pro-
ceedings but these predated a rigorous review of the
toxicities and thus presented a more optimistic picture
than was revealed by the full analysis of all patients in
this paper.27,28
The presence of intact lung after pleurectomy/decorti-
cation presents concerns about pulmonary toxicity and
previous studies using radiotherapy techniques other
than IMRT have shown treatment-related deaths.10 The
assumption of the technique used at our institution was
that loss of ventilation in the irradiated lung could be lar-
gely compensated by the functioning contralateral lung,
but the other toxicities outweighed the potential benefits
of this treatment. There are other series using IMRT and
tomotherapy that have reported lower rates of toxicities
than what we have found, however, most are single insti-
tution retrospective studies with fewer patients than our
series.15,17,18,29–31 The higher incidence of severe toxic-
ity in our IMRT patients (78%), compared to other series
and to our 3D-CRT patients (53%), may be due to the
larger target volumes and higher doses used for the
IMRT group. Based on our findings, we have now ceased
treating patients with this specific technique for malig-
nant pleural mesothelioma.
