Summary
Background Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary substantially across different national 
guidelines. To define thresholds associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, we 
studied individual-participant data from 599 912 current drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease.
Methods We did a combined analysis of individual-participant data from three large-scale data sources in 19 high-
income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised 
dose–response associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g per week of alcohol (12·5 units per week) 
across 83 prospective studies, adjusting at least for study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes. To be eligible 
for the analysis, participants had to have information recorded about their alcohol consumption amount and 
status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at least 1 year of 
follow-up after baseline, and no baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses focused on current 
drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised into eight predefined groups according to the 
amount in grams consumed per week. We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, total 
cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes. We corrected HRs for estimated long-term 
variability in alcohol consumption using 152 640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years apart (median 
interval 5·6 years [5th–95th percentile 1·04–13·5]) from 71 011 participants from 37 studies.
Findings In the 599 912 current drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 40 310 deaths and 39 018 incident 
cardiovascular disease events during 5·4 million person-years of follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded 
a positive and curvilinear association with the level of alcohol consumption, with the minimum mortality risk 
around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of 
stroke (HR per 100 g per week higher consumption 1·14, 95% CI, 1·10–1·17), coronary disease excluding 
myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00–1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03–1·15), fatal hypertensive disease (1·24, 
1·15–1·33); and fatal aortic aneurysm (1·15, 1·03–1·28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was log-
linearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR 0·94, 0·91–0·97). In comparison to those who 
reported drinking >0–≤100 g per week, those who reported drinking >100–≤200 g per week, >200–≤350 g per 
week, or >350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 
4–5 years, respectively.
Interpretation In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause 
mortality was about 100 g/week. For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there were no 
clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These 
data support limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in most current guidelines.

Introduction
Alcohol consumption guidelines vary substantially across 
the globe.1,2 In the USA, for example, an upper limit of 
196 g per week (about 11 standard UK glasses of wine or 
pints of beer per week) is recommended for men, and an 
upper limit of 98 g per week is recommended for women.1 
Similar recommendations apply in Canada and Sweden.2 
By contrast, guidelines in Italy, Portugal, and Spain 
recommend low-risk limits almost 50% higher than 
these.1,2 At the other extreme, UK guidelines recommend 
low-risk limits for men almost half that recommended by 
US guide 
lines.1,2
Such variation in policy might reflect ambiguity about 
drinking risk thresholds associated with the lowest risk of 
mortality,3–15 as well as uncertainty about the specific 
consequences of alcohol consumption, including those 
related to cardiovascular disease subtypes. For example, 
recent studies have challenged the concept that moderate 
alcohol consumption is universally associated with lower 
cardiovascular disease risk,16,17 but the dose–response 
associations of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular 
disease subtypes remain poorly understood. Therefore, to 
help in the formulation of evidence-based alcohol policy, 
we analysed individual-participant data from 83 long-
term prospective studies in 19 high-income countries. 
Our aim was to characterise risk thresholds for all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular disease subtypes in current 
drinkers of alcohol.
Methods
Study design, data sources, and participants
We focused our study on current alcohol drinkers for 
three main reasons. First, alcohol guidelines provide 
recommendations about low-risk limits only for drinkers 
(we are unaware of any guidelines that encourage 
non-drinkers to consume alcohol). Second, a focus on 
current drinkers should limit potential biases that are 
difficult to control in observational studies (eg, reverse 
causality, residual confounding, and unmeasured effect 
modification) because ex-drinkers include people who 
might have abstained from alcohol owing to poor health 
itself,18–20 as well as those who have changed their habits 
to achieve a healthier lifestyle. Third, never-drinkers 
might differ systematically from drinkers in ways that 
are difficult to measure, but which might be relevant to 
disease causation.21
We did a combined analysis of individual-participant 
data from three large-scale data sources available to our 
consortium, each constituting purpose-designed pro-
spective cohort studies with quantitative information 
about alcohol consumption (appendix p 21). First, the 
Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC) is a 
collaboration of prospective cohort studies with infor-
mation about a variety of risk factors, cardiovascular 
disease outcomes, and mortality.22 Of the 102 studies in the 
ERFC with information about alcohol status, 81 contained 
information about the quantity of consumption. Second,

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for prospective epidemiological studies of alcohol 
consumption investigating disease risk thresholds published in 
any language up until March 1, 2017 (with no specified earliest 
date), in PubMed, Scientific Citation Index Expanded, and 
Embase using relevant terms (“alcohol”, “mortality”, “survival”, 
“cardiovascular disease”, “cohort”, and “prospective”). We found 
many primary reports and literature-based reviews. However, 
no study had combined the following key features required to 
achieve reliable estimates of dose–response associations: 
availability of individual-participant data; quantitative 
assessment of alcohol consumption levels using validated 
instruments; periodic re-surveys of alcohol consumption levels; 
recording of large numbers of deaths (eg, >20 000 deaths); 
and sufficient detail and power to disaggregate incident 
cardiovascular disease outcomes into subtypes 
(eg, >20 000 incident total cardiovascular disease outcomes).
Added value of this study
The current study combined all the key study design features 
mentioned above, and afforded several additional advantages. 
First, it reduced the potentially distorting effects of reverse 
causality by focusing on current drinkers without previous 
cardiovascular disease who survived at least 12 months of 
follow-up. Second, it enhanced generalisability by including 
individual-participant data from 83 prospective studies in 
19 different high-income countries. Third, it used a variety of 
established and emerging risk factors, enabling investigation 
of potential confounders and mediators.
Implications of all the available evidence
The chief implication of this study for public policy is to 
support reductions of alcohol consumption limits in existing 
guidelines, suggesting that the threshold for lowest risk for 
all-cause mortality is about 100 g per week (about 
5–6 standard UK glasses of wine or pints of beer per week). 
The chief implication for scientific understanding is the 
strengthening of evidence that the association between 
alcohol consumption and total cardiovascular disease risk is 
actually comprised of several distinct and opposite 
dose–response curves rather than a single J-shaped 
association.

EPIC-CVD, a ten-country case-cohort study nested in the 
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and 
Nutrition (EPIC) prospective cohort study, had quantitative 
alcohol information from 22 of its 23 contributing 
centres.23 Third, UK Biobank—a single large prospective 
study—had cohort-wide data about quantitative alcohol 
consumption.24 Therefore, our combined analysis included 
information from a total of 83 prospective studies that each 
used broadly similar methods to quantify alcohol 
consumption, record risk factors, and ascertain cause-
specific death and cardiovascular disease events. We 
harmonised records of alcohol consumption across the 
contributing studies using a conversion of 1 unit=8 g of 
pure alcohol to a standard scale of grams per week 
(appendix pp 1–2), enabling a common analytical approach 
despite variation in the methods used (eg, self-administered 
vs interview-led question 
naires; food frequency question-
naires vs dietary recall surveys), and in consumption 
scales over different periods of ascertainment. Details of 
contributing studies are in appendix pp 3–4, 10–11.
To be eligible for the analysis, participants had to have 
information recorded about their alcohol consumption 
amount and status (ie, non-drinker vs current drinker), 
plus age, sex, history of diabetes and smoking status, at 
least 1 year of follow-up after baseline, and no known 
baseline history of cardiovascular disease (defined as 
coronary heart disease, other heart disease, stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, or 
cardio 
vascular surgery); appendix p 21. The main analyses 
focused on current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol 
consumption was categorised into eight predefined 
groups according to the amount in grams consumed per 
week: >0–≤25, >25–≤50, >50–≤75, >75–≤100, >100–≤150, 
>150–≤250, >250–≤350, and >350 g per week. We assessed 
alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality, 
total cardiovascular disease, and the following car-
diovascular disease subtypes (defined in appendix p 5): 
fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction; fatal and non-
fatal coronary disease excluding myocardial infarct 
ion; 
fatal 
and 
non-fatal 
stroke 
(including 
ischaemic, 
haemorrhagic, subarachnoid, and unclassified subtypes 
of stroke); fatal and non-fatal heart failure; and mortality 
from other cardiovascular causes, including cardiac 
dysrhythmia, hypertensive disease, sudden death, and 
aortic aneurysm.7,17,25 In analyses of cardiovascular disease 
subtypes, participants contributed follow-up time until 
the first outcome recorded (ie, cardiovascular deaths 
preceded by non-fatal outcomes were not included). Event 
times were censored at the end of follow-up or death from 
non-cardiovascular causes.
Statistical analysis
Hazard ratios (HRs) for alcohol consumption were 
calculated separately within each study using Cox 
regression models, stratified by sex and with adjustment 
for known confounders: age, smoking status (current vs 
non-current) and history of diabetes. To account for 
EPIC-CVD’s case-cohort design (which was used because 
lipids and other cardiovascular disease bio 
markers were 
measured only in the case-cohort subset and not the full 
EPIC cohort), the Cox models for cardiovascular disease 
events were adapted using Prentice weights and stratified 
by centre.26 For the four case-control studies nested within 
prospective cohorts of the ERFC, odds ratios were 
calculated using, as appropriate, conditional or uncon-
ditional logistic regression models, taking into account 
relevant matching factors. Study-specific estimates were 
then pooled across studies by random-effects meta-
analysis.27 We tested for violation of the proportional 
hazards assumption by including time interactions with 
alcohol consumption. To avoid model overfitting, studies 
with fewer than five incident cases of a particular outcome 
were excluded from analyses of that particular outcome.
To correct for measurement error and within-person 
variability in alcohol consumption over time, we 
estimated long-term average (henceforth, “usual”) alcohol 
consumption using multi-level regression calibration and 
information 
from 
152 640 
serial 
assessments 
in 
71 011 individuals from 37 studies. This calculation was 
achieved either by regressing re-survey measurements 
(for the repeat alcohol assessments available in the ERFC 
studies and UK Biobank) or lifetime alcohol consumption 
measure 
ments (for calculated lifetime alcohol con-
sumption measurements available in EPIC-CVD) on 
baseline alcohol consumption, adjusted for duration of 
follow-up and baseline age, sex, smoking status, history 
of diabetes, other relevant covariate(s), and with random 
effects for study and re-survey.28,29 The regression dilution 
ratio (ie, the calibration slope), which measures the extent 
of within-person variability,28 was extracted from the 
calibration model. HRs in this paper relate to usual 
alcohol consumption levels unless specified otherwise.
We assessed the shapes of associations for all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes by 
calculating study-specific HRs within the predefined 
groups of baseline alcohol consumption, pooled them by 
multivariate random-effects meta-analysis, and plotted 
them against mean usual (and baseline) alcohol 
consumption within each group. We estimated 95% CIs 
for each group (including the reference group) that 
corresponded to the amount of information underlying 
each group.30,31 For each major outcome, we determined 
the best fitting first or second order fractional polynomial32 
to describe the association with baseline alcohol 
consumption (using a 1% significance level as evidence 
for a second order fractional polynomial over a first order 
fractional polynomial) using Cox regression models 
stratified by sex, study, and centre. Further analyses 
assumed a linear association with alcohol consumption, 
expressing results per 100 g per week (12·5 units/week) 
in usual alcohol consumption. To assess the effect of 
excluding known current drinkers with missing alcohol 
consumption data, we did a sensitivity analysis using 
multiple imputation within studies, before combining

the data in a meta-analysis. We investigated associations 
with alcohol type (wine, beer, and spirits), consumption 
frequency (dichotomised as drinkers who consumed 
alcohol on ≤2 days per week or those who consumed 
alcohol on >2 days per week) and episodic heavy drink-
ing (dichotomised as binge drinkers who consumed 
≥100 g per drinking occasion or non-binge drinkers who

self-reported red meat consumption, and self-reported 
use of anti-hypertensive drugs. We investigated effect 
modi 
fication with formal tests for interaction, using a 
0·1% significance threshold to make some allowance for 
multiple testing. Heterogeneity was investigated by 
grouping studies according to recorded characteristics 
and through meta-regression, assessed by the I² statistic.33 
Evidence of small study effects was assessed visually with 
funnel plots and by Begg and Mazumdar’s test34 and 
Egger’s test.35
Methods we used to estimate reductions in life 
expectancy (years of life lost) are described in the appendix 
(pp 6–7). Briefly, estimates of cumulative survival from 
40 years of age onwards in different categories of baseline 
alcohol consumption were calculated by applying 
estimated HRs (specific to age-at-risk) for cause-specific 
mortality to the detailed mortality component of the 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
WONDER database,36 which recorded 10 million deaths 
(from all causes) in more than 305 million individuals in 
the USA during 2007–10.37,38 Results were modelled from 
age 40 years and enabled estimation of years of life lost 
between light drinkers (defined as those consuming 
>0–≤100 g/week of alcohol) and pre-defined groups of 
>100–≤200, >200–≤350, and >350 g per week. This method 
does not make use of the survival estimates from the 
modelled data; instead, it makes inferences by estimating 
age-at-risk specific HRs, which are then combined with 
external population age-specific mortality rates.39
Analyses used Stata (version 14.2 and 15.1). All p values 
presented are for 2-sided tests.

Results
Of the 786 787 participants with sufficient information for 
inclusion in this consortium, 186 875 (19%) reported not 
drinking at baseline, leaving 599 912 current drinkers 
without a history of cardiovascular disease at base-
line who were eligible for the prespecified principal 
analysis. The current drinkers were derived from ERFC 
(247 504 participants), EPIC-CVD (26 036), and the UK 
Biobank (326 372; table 1). Baseline year of recruitment 
ranged from 1964 to 2010. The mean age of the participants 
was 57 years (SD 9). 265 910 (44%) of 599 912 participants 
were women, and 128 085 (21%) were current smokers 
(appendix p 12). About 50% reported drinking more than 
100 g of alcohol per week, and 8·4% drank more than 
350 g per week (table 1). During 5·4 million person-years 
(median 7·5 years of follow-up [5th–95th percentiles 
5·0–18·4]), there were 40 310 deaths from all causes, 
(including 11 762 vascular and 15 150 neoplastic deaths), 
and 39 018 first incident cardiovascular disease out-
comes, including 12 090 stroke events, 14 539 myocardial 
infarction events, 7990 coronary disease events exclud-
ing myocardial infarction, 2711 heart failure events, 
and 1121 deaths from other cardiovascular diseases 
(appendix p 13).
Baseline alcohol consumption varied substantially across 
studies, was generally lower in more recent calendar 
periods of recruitment, and was positively skewed (median 
96 g/week [5th–95th percentiles 6–448]; appendix p 22). It 
was weakly and positively correlated with male sex, 
smoking status and amount, systolic blood pressure, 
HDL-C level, fibrinogen, and lower socioeconomic status 
(appendix pp 23–24). 152 640 serial assessments of alcohol 
consumption were available for 71 011 participants from 
37 studies (median interval between baseline and serial 
measurements 5·6 years [5th–95th percentiles 1·04–13·5]). 
Participants with serial measurements were younger, had 
slightly higher baseline alcohol consumption, and were 
more likely to be men than those without serial 
measurements (table 1, appendix p 14). The regression 
dilution ratio for alcohol consumption was 0·50 (95% CI 
0·47–0·52), similar to that for systolic blood pressure 
(0·52, 0·50–0·55) but lower than that for HDL-C 
concentration (0·74, 0·72–0·76) in a common set 
of participants. 
For all-cause mortality, there was a positive and 
curvilinear association with alcohol consumption, with 
the lowest risk for those consuming below 100 g per 
week (figure 1, appendix p 25). Associations were similar 
for men and women (appendix p 26), but weaker at older 
ages (appendix p 27). There was a J-shaped association 
for the aggregate of cardiovascular dis 
ease outcomes 
(figure 1, appendix p 25). However, disaggregation 
showed two opposing sets of associations (figure 2).

Cardiovascular disease was defined as an aggregate of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and stroke. 
Hazard ratios are adjusted for age, smoking, and history of diabetes, and stratified by sex and EPIC centre. 
The reference category is the lowest baseline alcohol consumption category (between 0 and 25 g/week). HRs are 
plotted against the mean usual alcohol consumption in each category. Sizes of the boxes are proportional to the 
inverse of the variance of the log-transformed hazard ratios. Vertical lines represent 95% CIs.

After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and history of 
diabetes, the amount of alcohol consumed had positive 
and roughly linear associations with stroke (HR per 
100 g/week higher consumption 1·14, 1·10–1·17), 
coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction (1·06, 
1·00–1·11), heart failure (1·09, 1·03–1·15), fatal 
hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15–1·33), and fatal aortic 
aneurysm (1·15, 1·03–1·28; figures 2, 3). By contrast, 
there was an inverse and approximately log-linear 
association with myocardial infarction (0·94, 0·91–0·97; 
figures 2, 3). Stroke associ 
ations were similar for fatal 
and non-fatal outcomes (appendix p 28) and across 
subtypes (appendix p 29). However, for coronary disease 
excluding myocardial infarction, associ 
ations were 
stronger for fatal than non-fatal outcomes (appendix 
p 28). For myocardial infarction, inverse associations 
were possibly more pronounced with non-fatal than fatal 
outcomes (figure 3, appendix p 28).
With the following notable exceptions, further adjust-
ment for additional covariates did not substantially change 
HRs (table 2, appendix pp 15, 30). First, adjustment for 
HDL-C level weakened the inverse association between 
alcohol consumption and myocardial infarction, but 
strengthened the positive association between alcohol 
consumption and both coronary disease and heart 
failure. Second, adjustment for systolic blood pressure 
strengthened the inverse asso 
ciation between alcohol 
consumption and myocardial infarction, but weakened 
the positive associations between alcohol consumption 
and all other cardiovascular disease outcomes. Our 
analysis con 
firmed the established association of alcohol 
consumption with cancers of the digestive system, which 
did not change after additional adjustment for the factors 
listed above (appendix p 16). Furthermore, additional 
adjustment for smoking amount abolished the apparent 
association of alcohol consumption with lung cancer 
(appendix pp 16), in line with the accepted view that 
alcohol consumption does not cause lung cancer.40

recorded fewer than five events for a particular outcome 
(appendix p 36); provided separate analyses of men and 
women (appendix p 17, appendix p 26); omitted outcomes 
recorded in the initial 5 years of follow-up (appendix p 18); 
excluded participants with diabetes or other known 
chronic diseases at baseline (appendix p 18); and restricted 
the analyses to studies that recorded both non-fatal and 
fatal endpoints (appendix p 37). Associations of baseline 
alcohol consumption with all-cause mortality were 
stronger in drinkers of beer or spirits than of wine, and in 
those drinking less frequently (when consuming the same 
weekly amount), including binge drinkers (appendix 
p 38). However, people showing these behaviours had 
higher baseline levels of smoking and other indicators of 
lower socioeconomic status, suggesting the potential for 
confounding effects (appendix pp 19–20). For cardio-
vascular disease subtypes, HRs tended to be higher in 
beer and spirit drinkers than in wine drinkers, but not 
significantly so in direct com 
parisons involving a common 
set of participants (appendix p 39).
We noted little heterogeneity in the studies contrib-
uting results for stroke (I²=12%), myocardial infarc-
tion (I²=12%), coronary disease excluding myocardial 
infarction (I²=26%), heart failure (I²=4%) or deaths from 
other types of cardiovascular disease (I²=33%; figure 3). 
HRs for the cardiovascular disease outcomes we 
studied were broadly similar for different geographical 
regions, decade of study enrolment, by data source 
(ie, ERFC, EPIC-CVD, and UK Biobank), and alcohol 
assess 
ment method (appendix pp 40–42). HRs for the 
cardiovascular disease outcomes were generally higher at 
younger ages, but did not vary substantially by sex, 
history of diabetes, proatherogenic lipids, BMI, smoking 
status, or other individual-level characteristics (appendix 
pp 43–45). There was no evidence of small study effects 
(appendix p 46). Our data showed no evidence of violation 
of the proportional hazards assumption. 
In comparison to those who reported drinking 
>0–≤100 g (mean usual 56 g) alcohol per week, those who 
reported drinking >100–≤200 g (mean usual 123 g) per 
week, >200–≤350 g (mean usual 208 g) per week or 
>350 g (mean usual 367 g) per week had shorter life 
expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 
1–2 years, or 4–5 years respectively (figure 4). Similarly, 
men who reported consuming above the UK upper limit 
of 112 g per week had a shorter life expectancy at age 
40 years of 1·6 years (95% CI 1·3–1·8), and men who 
reported drinking above the US upper limit of 196 g per 
week had a shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of 
2·7 years (2·4–3·1) compared with men who reported 
drinking below these respective upper limits. Thus, men 
who reported drinking less than 100 g alcohol per week 
had about a 1–2 years longer life expectancy at age 
40 years than those who reported drinking 196 g per 
week (appendix p 47). Women who reported drinking 
above either the UK threshold (112 g per week) or US 
threshold (98 g per week) had about 1·3 (1·1–1·5) years 
shorter life expectancy at age 40 years compared with 
women who reported drinking below these thresholds 
(appendix p 47). About 20% of the alcohol-related survival 
difference for men (and slightly less for women) was 
attributed to excess death from cardio 
vascular disease 
(appendix p 47). Similar findings to those for the US 
population were observed when modelling was based on 
EU mortality rates (data not shown).
Discussion
The main finding of this analysis was that the threshold 
for lowest risk for all-cause mortality was about 100 g per 
week. For men, we estimated that long-term reduction of 
alcohol consumption from 196 g per week (the upper 
limit recommended in US guidelines) to 100 g per week 
or below was associated with about 1–2 years of longer 
life expectancy at age 40 years. Exploratory analyses 
suggested that drinkers of beer or spirits, as well as binge 
drinkers, had the highest risk for all-cause mortality.
Our study has highlighted the complex and diverse 
potential mechanisms by which alcohol consumption 
may exert cardiovascular effects.41,42 It has shown that the 
association between alcohol consumption and total 
cardiovascular disease risk comprises several distinct 
and opposite dose–response curves, rather than a single 
J-shaped association. In particular, whereas higher 
alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated 
with a higher risk of all stroke subtypes, coronary dis-
ease excluding myocardial infarction, heart failure, and 
several less common cardiovascular disease subtypes, it 
was approximately log-linearly associated with a lower 
risk of myocardial infarction. Our results are concordant 
with recent observational data and Mendelian ran-
domisation studies.16,43–46

Figure 4: Estimated future years of life lost by extent of reported baseline alcohol consumption compared

The estimates of cumulative survival from 40 years of age onwards in the alcohol-drinking groups were calculated 
by applying hazard ratios (specific to age at risk) for all-cause mortality associated with categorised baseline 
alcohol consumption to US death rates at the age of 40 years or older. Mean usual levels of alcohol consumption 
within each baseline alcohol consumption category were 56, 123, 208 and 367 g per week, respectively, for the 
groups >0–≤100 g per week, >100–≤200 g per week, >200–≤350 g per week, and >350 g per week.

Our results contribute toward understanding of the 
basis for these directionally divergent cardiovascular 
disease associations. For example, our data have 
suggested that elevated systolic blood pressure could 
mediate alcohol consumption’s positive association 
with stroke and coronary disease excluding myocardial 
infarction.44,47,48 By contrast, pathways related to HDL-C 
(but not necessarily HDL-C itself49–52) could mediate 
alcohol consumption’s inverse association with myo-
cardial infarction. Both blood pressure and HDL-C are 
known to increase in response to alcohol consumption.50 
They have contrasting associations with cardiovascular 
disease outcomes: the inverse association of HDL-C 
with cardiovascular disease is substantially stronger for 
coronary disease than stroke,53,54 whereas the positive 
association of systolic blood with cardiovascular disease 
is considerably stronger for stroke than coronary 
disease.55 However, we did not find convincing evidence 
that other known risk factors were important mediators 
or confounders.
Our study’s access to individual-participant data avoided 
limitations of previous literature-based reviews.56 To limit 
reverse causality, our study focused on current drinkers 
without baseline cardiovascular disease and omitted the 
initial period of follow-up. To limit confounding, our 
study adjusted for a variety of risk factors. To correct for 
misclassification in alcohol consumption and covariates, 
our study also used extensive information on serial 
assessments. Our results were robust to a variety of 
sensitivity analyses. Generalisability of the findings 
was enhanced by inclusion of data from 83 prospective 
studies based in many different high-income countries 
recruited between 1964 and 2010. Although alcohol 
consumption levels declined during this period, HRs 
were similar over calendar time.
Nevertheless, our study has some potential limitations. 
Self-reported alcohol consumption data are prone to 
bias and are challenging to harmonise across studies 
conducted over different time periods that used varying 
instruments and methods to record such data.20,57 We 
did not, however, identify major diff
 erences in results 
across studies that used differing alcohol measurement 
instruments. Despite our study’s access to extensive serial 
alcohol re-surveys from mid-life, our study could not 
investigate alcohol consumption during the entire life 
course. Misclassification in outcomes would have diluted 
dose-response 
associations, 
suggesting 
that 
true 
under 
lying associations of alcohol consumption with 
cardio 
vascular disease subtypes are stronger and more 
divergent than we observed. Because we did not generally 
have access to additional alcohol-related adverse out-
comes (eg, non-fatal liver disease, injuries, or psychiatric 
comorbidities), we probably under-estimated potential 
benefits associated with lowering alcohol consumption. 
Because some individuals who reduced, but did not cease, 
alcohol consumption due to health complications were 
probably included in our analysis, we cannot exclude the 
effects of reverse causation (especially since some 
contributing studies did not record baseline chronic 
disease other than cardiovascular disease). Therefore, 
alternative study designs including randomised trials58 
are needed, to control more completely for residual biases 
(including those related to studying ex-drinkers and 
never-drinkers).
In conclusion, our study shows that among current 
drinkers, the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause 
mortality was about 100 g per week. For cardiovascular 
disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction, there 
were no clear thresholds below which lower alcohol 
consumption stopped being associated with a lower 
disease risk. These data support adoption of lower limits 
of alcohol consumption than are recommended in most 
current guidelines.
