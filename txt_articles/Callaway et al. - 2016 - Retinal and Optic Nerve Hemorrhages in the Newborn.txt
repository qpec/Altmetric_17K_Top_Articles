Abstract
 Purpose—To report the birth prevalence, risk factors, characteristics and location of fundus 
hemorrhages (FH) of the retina and optic nerve present in newborns at birth.
 Design—Prospective cohort study at Stanford University School of Medicine.
 Participants—All infants who were 37 weeks postmenstrual age or older and were deemed 
stable by their pediatrician were eligible for screening. Infants who were anophthalmic or had 
known or suspected infectious conjunctivitis were excluded.
 Methods—Infants born at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) from July 25, 2013 
through July 25, 2014 were offered universal newborn screening via wide-angle digital retinal 
photography in the Newborn Eye Screen Test (NEST) study. Maternal, obstetric, and neonatal 
factors were obtained by reviewing hospital records prior to discharge. The location, retinal layer, 
and laterality of FH were recorded by one pediatric vitreoretinal specialist.
 Main Outcome Measures—Birth prevalence of FH. Secondary outcomes included rate of 
adverse events, risk factors for FH, hemorrhage characteristics and adverse events.
 Results—The birth prevalence of FH in this study was 20.3% (41/202 infants). Ninety-five 
percent of FHs involved the periphery, 83% involved the macula, and 71% involved multiple 
layers of the retina. The fovea was involved in 15% of FH cases (birth prevalence, 3.0%). No cases 
of bilateral foveal hemorrhage were found. Fundus hemorrhages were more common in the left 
eye than the right. Fundus hemorrhages were most commonly optic nerve flame hemorrhages 
(48%) and white-centered retinal hemorrhages (30%). Retinal hemorrhages were found most 
frequently in all 4 quadrants (35%) and more often were multiple than solitary. Macular

 hemorrhages most often were intraretinal (40%). Among the risk factors examined in this study, 
vaginal delivery compared with cesarean section (odds ratio [OR], 9.34; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 2.57-33.97) showed the greatest level of association with FH. Self-identified ethnicity as 
Hispanic or Latino showed a protective effect (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.94). Other study factors 
were not significant.
 Conclusions—Fundus hemorrhages are common among newborns. They often involve 
multiple areas and layers of the retina. Vaginal delivery was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of FH, whereas self-identified Hispanic or Latino ethnicity was protective against 
FH in this study. The long-term consequences of FH on visual development remain unknown.
Studies conducted outside of the United States on ethnically homogenous populations report 
the incidence of birth-related fundus hemorrhages (FH) to be between 2.6% and 50%.1-4 The 
mechanism of increased risk of FH during a vaginal delivery is hypothesized as follows: 
passage of the head through the canal can cause an acute rise in intracranial pressure that 
causes stasis of blood flow in the central retinal vein, which then turns into an acute change 
in pressure of the central retinal artery and thus, may precipitate a hemorrhage.5, 6 Still, not 
all infants born via vaginal delivery have FH. Therefore, there must be maternal or neonatal 
factors that remain poorly understood influencing the development of FH at birth.
Little is known about FH at birth because evidence is limited and prospective studies are 
usually conducted in select populations.2, 7 The studies that have examined FH at birth 
report that FH are not uncommon at birth, are more frequent among infants delivered via 
vaginal delivery, and at times can take up to 58 days to resolve completely.8 No study has 
performed universal retinal examination on a diverse group of infants such as the United 
States population. Herein, we present the results of the first universal newborn ocular 
screening initiative conducted in the United States. The study aimed to determine the birth 
prevalence of FH, describe risk factors for FH, and to describe the retinal layer, location, 
characteristics, and laterality of FH. We hypothesized that FH is present in a large proportion 
of otherwise healthy newborns and that vaginal delivery will increase the odds of FH.
 METHODS
 Study Design
The Newborn Eye Screen Testing (NEST) study is a prospective institutional cohort study 
conducted at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) at Stanford University School of 
Medicine. It was designed to determine the birth prevalence of ophthalmic disease and the 
long-term vision outcomes of newborns with ocular abnormalities identified at birth. 
Universal newborn screening with retinal image photography was offered to all infants born 
at LPCH who did not receive retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening. A pediatric 
vitreoretinal specialist (DMM) reviewed images sent to the Byers Eye Institute telemedicine 
reading center. Parents were notified within 48 hours of any abnormal screenings. Baseline 
demographic, maternal, and obstetric, delivery, and newborn characteristics were recorded 
for each subject. In this article we report the one-year birth prevalence, characteristics and 
associated risk factors for FH among newborns screened in the NEST study during the first 
year of enrollment.

  Ethical Considerations
The Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee at Stanford University School of 
Medicine prospectively approved this study (IRB # 25098). Informed consent was obtained 
from all subjects participating in NEST screening and the study was conducted in a Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant fashion. All research 
adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Operational Logistics
Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital is one of only a few hospitals offering quaternary care in 
Northern California. It captures an ethnically, geographically, culturally, and 
socioeconomically diverse patient population. The hospital has three levels of newborn care: 
the well-baby nursery, the intermediate care nursery and the neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU). All infants who do not qualify for ROP examination were considered eligible for 
screening.
At Stanford, a telemedicine infrastructure is in place for the Stanford University Network for 
the Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) initiative that screens premature 
infants for ROP. The NEST study utilizes the same network with a separate database routed 
to a central reading center at Byers Eye Institute. Infants who did not require ROP screening 
were offered screening with the NEST study. For those who agreed to participate, images 
were obtained, stored electronically, and forwarded via a HIPAA-compliant, encrypted, 
secure image server to the reading center. One pediatric vitreoretinal specialist (DMM) then 
interpreted these images. Parents were contacted within 48 hours of screening if the 
examination warranted ophthalmic referral.
 Patients and Study Population
Selection of subjects for the study aimed to maximize the study's external and internal 
validity by using a large, tertiary referral center drawing from an ethnically, racial, and 
socioeconomically diverse patient population. The target population was all newborns in the 
United States who were 37 weeks' postmenstraul age or older. The source population was all 
infants born at LPCH. The eligible population was all infants born at LPCH weekdays 
excluding holidays who were deemed stable for retinal image photography examination by 
their attending pediatrician at morning rounds. The study sample represented subjects whose 
parent and pediatrician consented to the study and the infant completed the screening 
procedure.
Inclusion criteria were all live infants born at LPCH who were 37 weeks’ postmenstrual age 
or older from July 25, 2013, through July 25, 2014. Exclusion criteria were patients who 
were bilaterally anophthalmic, patients whose images or medical charts were not available 
for review, patients with infectious conjunctivitis (risk of transmission via camera contact 
lens), and patients deemed too unstable for exam by their attending pediatrician. HIPAA and 
informed consent forms including risks, benefits, and alternatives, were thoroughly 
discussed with parents prior to obtaining consent for screening. The consent process was 
conducted in the parent's preferred language utilizing translators when necessary. The 
screening was offered free of charge to all parents. For subjects who declined screening, a

 brief questionnaire about their demographics, delivery method, and reasons for not 
participating was administered. No standard treatment was withheld or delayed for the 
purposes of this study.
 Photography Protocol
The RetCam III (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) was used to obtain wide-angle 
images of all infants enrolled in the NEST study. A NICU certified nurse was trained prior to 
initiating screening. First, Clarity Medical Systems provided RetCam III training by a 
certified ophthalmic photographer using both mannequins and live infants. There the nurse 
was observed and corrected on technique for capturing high-quality images and managing 
potential adverse outcomes. Second, the nurse was trained by the overseeing vitreoretinal 
specialist (DMM) to obtain photographs of adequate quality and proper retinal views for 
physician reading.
Parents and nursing staff assisted in positioning the newborn during screening. Parents were 
encouraged to swaddle infants, offer non-nutritive sucking during the exam and, if necessary, 
nursing staff provided oral sucrose solution to agitated infants prior to the examination. 
These interventions have been shown to reduce infant pain profiles during ophthalmic 
screening.9, 10 Subject's eyes were dilated with 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide 30 
to 60 minutes prior to examination. Feedings were discontinued 2 hours pre- and post-
examination in keeping with aspiration precaution guidelines. Infants were continuously 
evaluated during the examination for signs of apnea or distress. A topical anesthetic 0.5% 
proparacaine was administered in each eye before examination. A sterile lid speculum was 
used to open the eye and provide adequate exposure for photography. 2.5% hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose was used to couple the digital camera lens to the infant's cornea. Digital 
images were taken by the nurse and stored on the RetCam III computer hard drive as well as 
input into the NEST telemedicine database management system via automated, HIPAA-
compliant synchronization.
The goal was to obtain at least six clearly focused images in each eye and one external 
image of the face using the 130° lens (Figure 1A): 1) iris image, 2) optic nerve centered, 3) 
optic nerve superior, 4) optic nerve inferior, 5) optic nerve nasal, and 6) optic nerve 
temporal. After screening, the infant was observed by the NICU nurse for any adverse 
outcomes. In accordance with the current standard for red reflex screening, all screenings 
were performed prior to hospital discharge (mean 45.0 hours, range 11.6 to 103.3 hours). In 
general at LPCH, newborns are hospitalized for 48 hours after vaginal birth and 72 hours 
after cesarean section. Therefore, an effort was made to screen newborns within 48 hours 
after vaginal delivery and within 72 hours after cesarean delivery. The nursing staff did not 
take images over weekends.
 Data Collection and Management
Retinal images were reviewed at the Byers Eye Institute telemedicine reading center and a 
pediatric vitreoretinal specialist recorded data in the HIPAA-compliant, encrypted, REDCap 
server.11 Image review included ascertainment of external (facies) structures in addition to 
the standard ophthalmic examination that includes eyelids, orbit, lashes, conjunctiva, sclera,

 cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, vitreous, macula, retina and vessels, and the optic nerve, 
as they are seen on retinal image photography. Attempts to contact the parents via secure 
healthcare messaging and/or phone call about any abnormalities requiring ophthalmic 
referral were performed within 48 hours of screening.
The examiner collected the following information: gender, self-identified ethnicity (Hispanic 
or Latino vs. not), and recruitment in English (yes vs. no). The following factors were 
collected via chart review of hospital notes after subject enrollment and were unknown to the 
examiner: mother’s first baby (yes vs. no), parity (number), age at screening (hours), 
maternal age (years), birth weight (grams), delivery method (vaginal vs. cesarean section), 
instrumentation (any forceps or vacuum assist during vaginal delivery), gestational age, 
Apgar score, and time of rupture of membranes (minutes). Maternal age was classified as 
advanced when the mother was 35 years of age or older, and birth weight was low when the 
infant weighed less than 2500 g. Early screening was defined as screening before 48 hours 
of age. Instrumentation was any use of forceps or vacuum during delivery.
 Outcomes
The primary outcome in this study was the birth prevalence of FH. Fundus hemorrhages 
included hemorrhages in the retina, macula, fovea, or optic nerve. Birth prevalence was 
calculated as the number of cases at birth over the number of subjects screened during the 
study period. Secondary aims were to assess the rate of adverse events in the study, 
determine the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal risk factors for FH in the study population, 
and to describe the location, laterality and morphology of FH. FH characteristics were 
reported by pathology noted (not by subject) including layer, solitary vs. multiple, 
description (i.e. white-centered) and location.
 Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Software Enterprise Guide version 6.1 
(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Variables were tested for normality with the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess for outliers and determine the appropriate statistical test. 
Crude bivariate (unadjusted) testing was used to compare the cohort with and without FH. 
Exposure variables were excluded if they were missing and missing variables composed less 
than 10% of the sample. There were no missing outcome data.
Multivariate logistic regression modeling was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 
95% confidence interval (CI) as measures of the association between FH and each potential 
risk factor. As the odds ratio is less intuitive and can exaggerate the effect of an association, 
a previously published conversion formula was used to calculate the relative risk.12 All FHs 
in modeling were reported according to newborn (i.e., whether the subject had any FH in 
either eye) unless otherwise noted. Those undergoing cesarean section served as the 
reference category for all comparisons related to delivery method. We considered screening 
prior to two days of age, self-identified ethnicity, low birth weight, parity and maternal age 
as potential confounders based on literature review and our crude bivariate comparisons. The 
final model contained terms for delivery method, self-identified ethnicity, screening prior to 
two days of age, and low birth weight. All statistical tests had a two-tailed alpha of 0.05.

  RESULTS
 Eligible Study Population
During the one-year study period 830 newborns who met inclusion criteria for NEST study 
participation were approached. The approached study population was 53.7% male and 
included 33 sets of twins and 3 sets of triplets. Thirty-one percent of approached mothers 
self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, and self-identified race was reported as 52.2% white or 
Caucasian, 41.0% Asian, 4.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 2.6% African 
American or black. Study recruitment was performed in English 88.0% of the time. Other 
languages included Spanish, Arabic, French, Mandarin and Portuguese. The newborn was 
mom's first baby 45.9% of the time and the delivery method was cesarean section 41.6% of 
the time.
 Screened Population
Two hundred two subjects (403 eyes; 1 eye was not visualized) participated in the NEST 
study screening, for a participation rate of 24.3%. Overall, the screened population had an 
average birth weight of 3318 g (range, 2010-4510 g) that included 6.4% of infants who 
qualify as being of low birth weight (<2500 g). One hundred thirty-one infants were 
screened less than 48 hours after birth and 71 infants were screened 48 hours or more after 
birth. Maternal age ranged from age 16 to 48 years with a median of 32 years at delivery. 
The most common indications for cesarean section were repeat cesarean delivery (22.4%), 
elective (18.4%), and arrested labor (17.1%).
 Screened vs. Unscreened Cohort
The screened cohort was 47.5% female (difference between two cohorts by gender, p=0.79), 
50% of those screened were mom's first baby (p=0.18) and there was no significant 
difference in the percentage of recruitment that was done in English between the two cohorts 
(87.6% screened in English, 88.2% declined screening in English, p=0.80). There was no 
statistically significant difference in delivery method (vaginal vs. cesarean section) between 
the two cohorts with 61.9% of screened participants having a normal spontaneous vaginal 
delivery (NSVD) and 57.3% of unscreened individuals with NSVD (p=0.25). There was a 
statistically significant difference (p=0.0001) in the ethnic composition of the screened and 
unscreened cohorts with significantly more families who self-identified as Hispanic or 
Latino participating in screening (117/451 or 32.9%) compared to those who self-identified 
as Not Hispanic or Latino (84/255 or 20.1%). There was also a significant difference in 
screening among families with multiple births, specifically triplets, because the parents of all 
3 sets of triplets consented to screening, whereas none of the parents declined. There was no 
significant difference in screening rates among single and twin births.
The most common reasons why individuals chose not to participate in screening were: 
“Don't want to bother baby”, “Believe it is not necessary for the child”, and “Concern about 
adverse effects”. Other less common reasons for declining screening included “Do not want 
to wait for screening” and “Mom too tired”.

  Fundus Hemorrhages
Among the 202 subjects screened during the one-year study period, 41 subjects had an FH 
thus, the birth prevalence of FH was 20.3%. Table 1 compares baseline characteristics and 
previously reported risk factors for FH between the cohorts with and without any FH. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the gender, recruitment language, mother's 
parity, advanced maternal age (>35 years), birth weight (low birth weight binary and 
continuous) or location (NICU vs. well-baby nursery) between the screened and unscreened 
cohorts all with P values of more than 0.10. There was a significant difference in the rate of 
FH by delivery method. Among infants delivered by vaginal delivery, 29.6% (37/125) had 
FH versus 5.2% (4/77) among those born via cesarean section (OR, 7.67; 95% CI, 
2.61-22.53; p < 0.0001). When evaluating vaginal delivery forms (NSVD, forceps, vacuum) 
there was a very small sample size, however, there was an increased odds of FH that was 
statistically significant among those delivered via instrumentation (forceps or vacuum 
assisted) when compared to subjects delivered with normal spontaneous vaginal birth 
(p=0.01). Age at time of screening (in hours) was statistically significant (p=0.04 when 
continuous, p=0.02 when binary). 80.5% (33/41) of FH were reported among infants 
screened within the first two days of life. Finally, self-identified ethnicity approached 
statistical significance where 29.3% (12/41) of infants with FH had parents who identified as 
Hispanic or Latino as opposed to 45.0% (72/160) among the cohort that did not have FH 
(p=0.07).
 Fundus Hemorrhage Characteristics
A matrix of the retinal layer (or optic nerve) characteristics of all FH are shown in Table 2. 
Fundus hemorrhages were most often optic nerve flame hemorrhages (48.3%; 98/203) then 
most commonly white-centered (30.0%; 61/203). By location, retinal hemorrhages were 
distributed throughout the eye most often in all four quadrants (35.2%; 37/105). By location, 
optic nerve flame hemorrhages were detected most often temporally (34%; 33/98) and 
nasally (32%; 31/98). There were no vitreous hemorrhages found during screening.
 Macular and Foveal Hemorrhages
Macular hemorrhages are reported by layer of retina and whether or not they affect the 
fovea. A matrix of macular hemorrhage characteristics by retinal layer, solitary versus 
multiple, and foveal versus extrafoveal is shown in Table 3. A total of 34/202 subjects 
(16.7%) had a macular hemorrhage (82.9% of all FH) in at least one eye with 11 subjects 
having left macular hemorrhage and 5 with right macular hemorrhage. Eighteen subjects had 
bilateral macular hemorrhages. Most macular hemorrhages detected at birth were intraretinal 
(40.0%; 38/95), extrafoveal (93.7%; 89/95), and multiple (85.4%; 76/89). Overall birth 
prevalence of foveal hemorrhage was 3.0% (6/202).
 Laterality and Location of Fundus Hemorrhage
Figure 2 summarizes the laterality and location of FH detected during the one-year study 
period in the NEST study. Of the 41 newborns found to have any hemorrhages, 70.7% 
(29/41) were found to have multilaminar hemorrhages, 41% (12/29) of which were bilateral. 
Furthermore, 95.1% (39/41) of hemorrhages included the peripheral retina and 82.9%

 (34/41) affected the macula. Only 14.6% (6/41) of hemorrhages affected the fovea, and 
overall, FH affected the left fovea (5/6) more often than the right fovea (1/6). There were no 
bilateral cases of foveal hemorrhage.
 Logistic Regression Modeling
Based on crude bivariate analyses and review of the available literature, the following 
variables were assessed as possible risk factors in regression modeling: delivery method, 
screening prior to 48 hours after birth, self-identified ethnicity, low birth weight, parity and 
maternal age. The final multivariate model is shown in Table 4. Vaginal delivery 
significantly increased the odds of FH (OR, 9.34; 95% CI, 2.5-33.97). Screening prior to 48 
hours after birth and low birth weight were not significant in the model. Parity and maternal 
age were not significant and were not included in the model. Self-identified ethnicity as 
Hispanic or Latino was protective against FH (OR, 0.428; 95% CI, 0.2-0.94). The OR also 
was converted to the more intuitive risk ratio using the previously published methodology 
for this conversion based on the prevalence of the disease among the reference cohort for 
each variable.12
 Adverse Outcomes
There were no episodes of clinically significant bradycardia, allergic reactions to drops, and 
no corneal abrasions evident after screening or reported to the study team at discharge. No 
infants in the 1-year cohort have returned to the LPCH Department of Pediatric 
Ophthalmology for evaluation of possible corneal abrasion or any other screening-related 
issue after NEST study participation.
 DISCUSSION
This article presents the 1-year results of the first universal retinal image screening 
performed in healthy term infants in the United States. The birth prevalence of FH among 
the newborns screened during the first year of enrollment in the Newborn Eye Screen Test 
(NEST) study at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University was 20.3% 
(41/202). The birth prevalence of multilaminar hemorrhages was 14.4% (29/202) and the 
birth prevalence of foveal hemorrhages was 3.0% (6/202). The rate of FH reported in this 
study is similar to that reported in studies conducted in other populations.1-4, 8, 13, 14 
However, the presence of multilaminar and white-centered retinal hemorrhages in otherwise 
healthy, term newborns is novel.
Secondary aims of this study were to compare the cohort with and without FH on maternal, 
obstetric, and neonatal characteristics to understand better the risk factors for FH at birth. 
Further, we aimed to enrich our understanding of the characteristics, laterality, and 
descriptive appearance of birth-related FH. Hemorrhages found in healthy term newborns 
varied from isolated optic nerve hemorrhages to hemorrhages involving the macula (Figure 
1B) to extensive FH bilaterally (Figure 1C). When comparing the cohorts on previously 
reported risk factors we found an unadjusted difference in the frequency of FH by delivery 
method (p<0.0001) and by whether or not instrumentation was used during a vaginal 
delivery (p=0.01). We also found that early screening was significant (p=0.02) and that self-

 identified ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino approached significance (p=0.07) as shown in 
Table 1. We used these data and previously described risk factors such as maternal age and 
low-birth weight as possible predictors in a multivariate model.
The final multivariate regression model (Table 4) included delivery method, screening 
before or after 48 hours of age, self-identified ethnicity, and low birth weight. Maternal age 
and the other study variables were not included because they were not significant in crude 
comparisons or in other studies.13, 15-18 The model demonstrated a significant increase in the 
odds (OR, 9.34; 95% CI, 2.57-33.97; p < 0.001) of FH among infants delivered via vaginal 
delivery after controlling for the other variables in the model. After accounting for the 
underlying prevalence of the condition in the unexposed population, we found that vaginal 
delivery significantly increased the risk of FH 6.1 fold when compared to newborns with 
cesarean section. Unfortunately, there were insufficient case counts to include 
instrumentation in a model, however, we suspect that any instrumentation further increases 
the odds of FH given that 72.7% of infants who underwent vaginal delivery with 
instrumentation had an FH (p=0.01).
A surprising finding in this study was the significant difference in the risk of FH by ethnicity 
with self-identified ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino conferring a protective effect, or a 
reduction of risk by approximately 56%, for FH. This effect held after controlling for the 
other variables in the model. This finding has never been reported in the literature as no 
study to these authors' knowledge has evaluated ethnicity and its relationship to FH. There 
may be ethnic factors that affect the maternal pelvic diameter, fetal head circumference, or 
vessel elasticity that reduce the rate of FH among Hispanic or Latino populations, however, 
we were unable to discern this information using our current study design. Of note, the 
distribution of delivery types by ethnicity were similar, with Hispanic or Latino populations 
undergoing vaginal delivery 67% of the time compared with 59% among non-Hispanic 
Latinos. While evaluating for possible effect modification an interaction term of ethnicity by 
delivery method was included in a separate model, however, this term was not significant 
(p=0.13), thus there was no evidence of multiplicative interaction. There was a statistically 
significant difference in the rate of enrollment in the study by ethnicity, with Hispanics and 
Latinos more commonly being screened. Therefore, there may be selection bias that could 
be affecting the data. Nevertheless, this finding warrants further investigation.
Importantly, FH in a young infant can be the result of head trauma or could be secondary to 
birth-related FH. A better understanding of the typical characteristics of both patterns can 
help the clinician discern the etiology of the hemorrhage. Among the 41 infants with FH, 
most had hemorrhages in multiple parts of their retina, and most retinal hemorrhages were 
found in all 4 quadrants (35.2% [37/105]; Figure 2). This picture is commonly seen with 
non-accidental trauma and Terson syndrome, two disease processes commonly associated 
with intracranial injury.19-23 This is the first prospective analysis to document the 
multilaminar hemorrhage nature of FH in a consecutive term, healthy population. Overall, 
70.7% (29/41) of FH involved 2 or more layers of the eye. Approximately half of infants 
with a retinal or macular hemorrhage had bilateral hemorrhages, consistent with prior 
studies on birth-related FH.14 Among infants with unilateral hemorrhage, left-sided 
hemorrhages were far more common. We suspect this is because the left occiput anterior

 presentation is the most common, in which the left eye may press against the sacrum during 
delivery and is most likely to experience rapid pressure changes through the birth canal. For 
the same reason, the left eye is also the most likely to be affected by injury or pressure when 
instrumentation is used.
When looking at all FH (Table 2A, B), this study found that optic nerve flame hemorrhages 
(48.3%; 98/203) and white-centered retinal hemorrhages (30.2%; 61/203) were the most 
common types of FH. Also known as “Roth spots,” white-centered hemorrhages were first 
associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis and infection.24 However, white-centered 
hemorrhages may also arise from focal ischemia, an inflammatory infiltrate, or an 
accumulation of fibrin and platelets or neoplastic cells.1,25 They have been associated with 
complicated labor and delivery as well as non-accidental trauma.26 Herein we report the 
presence of white-centered hemorrhages in otherwise healthy, term newborns.
Table 3 isolates macular hemorrhages as we suspect these have the greatest potential for 
obscuring the visual axis and potentially affecting vision later in life. Of subjects with birth-
related FH, 82.9% (34/41) had hemorrhage that involved the macula. Among macular 
hemorrhages, six subjects had foveal hemorrhage and no subject had bilateral foveal 
hemorrhages. Hemorrhages that involved the macula more often were intraretinal (40.0%; 
38/95) and most commonly were extrafoveal. Macular hemorrhages were mostly multiple, 
as opposed to solitary (Figure 1B).
The overarching purpose of the NEST study is to describe the birth prevalence of ocular 
disease among newborns who otherwise would not have undergone screening by an 
ophthalmologist until they reached school age. The long-term goals of the study are to 
determine the incidence and risk factors for amblyopia—a leading cause of monocular 
vision impairment among children and young adults.27-30 Vision loss from amblyopia can 
have long-lasting adverse effects on school performance, social interactions, motor tasks, 
and confidence.31-35 Because vision development continues after birth, we hypothesize that 
any obstruction to the visual axis that persists for a sufficient period of time can induce 
amblyopia that is found later in the child's life as either strabismic or idiopathic amblyopia. 
This is in contrast to published literature reporting that retinal hemorrhages are benign, self-
resolving conditions.1 The studies evaluating the resolution of hemorrhages demonstrate that 
the majority resolve within 10 days, but studies also include patients with more severe 
hemorrhages that persist for many weeks.8, 13 These slow-resolving hemorrhages could 
obstruct the visual axis during the critical period and ultimately lead to deprivational 
amblyopia without ophthalmoscopic findings later deemed idiopathic.
At this point in time we are unable to evaluate this hypothesis because we do not have 
longitudinal data for the subjects in this study. Most patients continue their outpatient well-
child and ophthalmic care in other healthcare systems. This represents the greatest limitation 
of this study. Other limitations include a potential difference in enrollment by ethnicity as 
discussed above, and obtaining information from patient records retrospectively. Strengths of 
this study are that this is the first study in the United States to prospectively enroll infants 
that would have not otherwise received ophthalmic screening. This study is the first to 
present differences by ethnic composition, to these authors knowledge. This study also

 highlights the multilaminar nature of FH in a normal term population, something previously 
associated with non-accidental trauma and Terson syndrome in infants. Further, with the 
support of our research and hospital team we were able to utilize translation services to 
maximize diverse enrollment. Unlike other studies, we do not exclude infants unless they are 
potentially infectious, unstable, or are anophthalmic. Other studies exclude infants with 
systemic disease. The NEST study aimed to capture the unscreened newborn population.
The next phase of this study would be to determine the long-term vision outcomes of 
patients with various types of FH and determine the incidence of amblyopia among those 
with and without FH at birth. If slow-resolving hemorrhages are obstructing the visual axis 
during the critical period and causing a deprivational amblyopia then we could identify them 
at birth rather than during school screening.36 Although there is no treatment for FH, early 
intervention for deprivational or strabismic amblyopia detected with patching, cycloplegics, 
and correcting refractive errors would optimize the child’s vision potential, because these 
interventions have been shown to improve outcomes.37-39 Thus, early identification of birth-
related FH may offer the opportunity to identify potentially modifiable disease that could 
affect the child's vision potential.

 Newborn fundus hemorrhages are often multilaminar and arise in multiple areas of the 
retina. Vaginal delivery is associated with a significantly increased risk of fundus 
hemorrhages while self-identified Hispanic or Latino ethnicity may be protective.

Note –Fundus hemorrhage is reported by participant (i.e. a retinal hemorrhage in one or both eyes qualifies a newborn has having a retinal 
hemorrhage). Fundus hemorrhages included hemorrhages of the retina, macula, fovea and optic nerve. Newborns who met retinopathy of 
prematurity screening criteria were excluded from the NEST study because they were screened by another telemedicine initiative targeting ROP 
detection. Forceps delivery was not included in a separate analysis because there was only one subject. Percentages may not add up to 100 due to 
rounding.

Note - Multivariate logistic modeling based on crude bivariate analysis of baseline maternal, obstetric and neonatal characteristics. Maternal age 
and time of rupture of membranes were not significant in initial modeling and was not included in the final multivariate model. Vaginal delivery 
includes both normal spontaneous delivery and instrumentation because there were too few cases of instrumentation to perform separate modeling.
*All variables adjusted for delivery method, self-identified ethnicity, screening prior to 2 days of age, and presence of low-birth weight
**Based on a prevalence of 6.5% of retinal hemorrhage among babies delivered by C-section who were not low birth weight, not screened prior to 
two days after birth and did not identify as Latino/Hispanic. Odds ratio was converted to risk ratio using previously described methodology for 
cohort studies.
