SUMMARY
Some phages encode anti-CRISPR (acr) genes,
which antagonize bacterial CRISPR-Cas immune
systems by binding components of its machinery,
but it is less clear how deployment of these acr genes
impacts phage replication and epidemiology. Here,
we demonstrate that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas
resistance are still partially immune to Acr-encoding
phage. As a consequence, Acr-phages often need to
cooperate in order to overcome CRISPR resistance,
with a first phage blocking the host CRISPR-Cas im-
mune system to allow a second Acr-phage to suc-
cessfully replicate. This cooperation leads to epide-
miological tipping points in which the initial density
of Acr-phage tips the balance from phage extinction
to a phage epidemic. Furthermore, both higher levels
of CRISPR-Cas immunity and weaker Acr activities
shift the tipping points toward higher initial phage
densities. Collectively, these data help elucidate
how interactions between phage-encoded immune
suppressors and the CRISPR systems they target
shape bacteria-phage population dynamics.
INTRODUCTION
Bacteriophages (phages) are highly abundant in virtually all envi-
ronments and are thought to play a key role in shaping the ecol-
ogy and evolution of their bacterial hosts (Koskella and Brock-
hurst, 2014; Weitz, 2015; van Houte et al., 2016a). In response
to phage predation, many bacteria evolved defense mecha-
nisms that provide protection against phage predation (Labrie
et al., 2010), including many with molecular mechanisms that
are only starting to be understood (Makarova et al., 2011; Gold-
farb et al., 2015; Doron et al., 2018). The observation that phages
persist in the environment in spite of these host defenses is likely
due to a combination of ecological and evolutionary processes
(Thompson, 2005). One factor that is important in this context
is the evolution of phage genes that can specifically block host
defenses (Samson et al., 2013). For example, approximately
half of the sequenced bacterial genomes encode CRISPR-Cas
immune systems (Grissa et al., 2007; Makarova et al., 2015),
and in response, many phages have evolved anti-CRISPR (acr)
genes that inhibit the CRISPR immune response (Bondy-Den-
omy et al., 2013; Pawluk et al., 2014; Pawluk et al., 2016a).
However, the conditions and extent to which these immunosup-
pressive genes allow phages to persist in the face of bacteria
with CRISPR resistance have remained unclear.
CRISPR-Cas immune systems provide defense against phage
infection by inserting phage-derived sequences (spacers) into
CRISPR loci on the host genome (Barrangou et al., 2007). The
evolution of CRISPR resistance is determined both by the abun-
dance of phage genome fragments in the cell that serve as
substrates for spacer acquisition as well as the relative fitness
advantage of bacteria with newly acquired spacers (Levin,
2010; Swarts et al., 2012; Datsenko et al., 2012; Hynes et al.,
2014; Levy et al., 2015; Westra et al., 2015; Ku
¨ nne et al., 2016;
Semenova et al., 2016; Severinov et al., 2016). Following the
acquisition of novel spacers, processed transcripts of CRISPR
loci guide CRISPR-associated (Cas) surveillance complexes
and effector nucleases to detect and destroy complementary
genomes of re-infecting phages (Brouns et al., 2008; Garneau
et al., 2010). In some natural populations and experimental sys-
tems, phages can coexist for relatively long periods of time with
their bacterial hosts despite the evolution of CRISPR resistance
(Weinberger et al., 2012; Paez-Espino et al., 2013, 2015; Levin
et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016;), which may be explained by incom-
plete immunity provided by some CRISPR-Cas systems (Levin
et al., 2013), phage coevolution with CRISPR-resistant hosts
(i.e., escaping CRISPR resistance through the evolution of point
mutations in the sequences that are targeted on the phage
genome) (Deveau et al., 2008; Semenova et al., 2011; Childs
et al., 2012; Iranzo et al., 2013), the loss of CRISPR resistance
in some bacterial clones in the population (Weissman et al.,
2018), or the immigration of sensitive hosts into the CRISPR-
resistant population (Chabas et al., 2016, reviewed in Westra
et al., 2016). However, in other cases, the evolution of CRISPR
resistance

phage
extinctions,
particularly
if
CRISPR-Cas immune systems generate high population-level
spacer diversity, which is difficult for the phage to overcome
by point mutation (Childs et al., 2014; van Houte et al., 2016b;
Morley et al., 2017). In this context, acr genes can provide a

 critical benefit to the phage by antagonizing the CRISPR immune
systems of their bacterial hosts (van Houte et al., 2016b).
All Acrs characterized to date function by inhibiting either
the CRISPR surveillance complexes or the effector nucleases
(Bondy-Denomy et al., 2015; Pawluk et al., 2016b, 2017; Wang

2017; Peng et al., 2017; Rauch et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2017;
Yang and Patel, 2017; Hong et al., 2018). These acr genes

phages
(Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013) and can rescue phage from
CRISPR-mediated extinction (van Houte et al., 2016b). However,
previously reported data suggests that their ability to block
CRISPR resistance is imperfect and that some Acrs are more
potent than others (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013). For example,
phages encoding AcrIF1 had greater levels of infectivity on
CRISPR resistant hosts compared to phages encoding AcrIF4,
but in all cases, Acr-phage infectivity was highest on hosts lack-
ing CRISPR-Cas immunity (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013). While
these data suggest that CRISPR immunity provides partial resis-
tance against Acr-phage infection, it has remained unclear how
these patterns of partial resistance impact the ability of Acr-
phages to replicate and amplify. Here, we demonstrate that
Acr-phages need to cooperate in order to overcome partial resis-
tance of CRISPR immune hosts. This requirement for coopera-
tion has important epidemiological consequences as it causes
Acr-phages to be driven extinct if their initial titers are below a
critical threshold value but allows them to amplify when their ti-
ters exceed this threshold.
RESULTS
CRISPR-Cas Confers Partial Immunity to Acr-Phages
To investigate the consequences of the partial resistance of
CRISPR immune bacteria against Acr-phages (Figure S1A), we
expressed AcrIF1 (from phage JBD30) and AcrIF4 (from phage
JBD26) in an isogenic phage DMS3mvir background, which
lacks an endogenous AcrIF but is closely related to both parental
phages (91% and 80% pairwise sequence identity, respectively).
Consistent with previous observations (Bondy-Denomy et al.,
2013), efficiency of plaquing (EOP) assays with DMS3mvir-
AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 confirmed partial immunity of
P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 (WT PA14) hosts with CRISPR
resistance to these Acr-phages and demonstrated that Acrs
differ in their ability to block CRISPR resistance, with AcrIF1 be-
ing a more potent suppressor of CRISPR resistance than AcrIF4
(Figure 1A). As expected, EOPs of Acr-phages on wild-type (WT)
hosts were higher compared to ancestral phage DMS3mvir,
which is a priori targeted by one spacer of the WT PA14
CRISPR-Cas system but lower than those of phage DMS3vir,
which is not a priori targeted by the WT PA14 CRISPR-Cas sys-
tem (Figure 1A). Furthermore, EOPs decreased when hosts car-
ried two or five (hereafter named BIM2 and BIM5 [bacteriophage
insensitive mutant]) targeting spacers, presumably because this
increases the proportion of surveillance complexes that target
the phage (in addition to the targeting spacers, all bacteria
encode 35 non-targeting spacers). Furthermore, competition be-
tween bacteria with CRISPR resistance and sensitive bacteria
showed that, in the presence of Acr-phages, CRISPR resistance
provides a fitness advantage (Figure 1B; F1,53 = 193.98, p <
0.0001), which is consistent with the observation that targeting
spacers provide partial resistance to Acr-phages.
The Initial MOI of Acr-Phages Determines the
Epidemiological Outcome
While full CRISPR resistance can drive phages extinct (van
Houte et al., 2016b), the phage epidemiology associated with
partial resistance to Acr-phages is unclear. We explored this
by measuring phage amplification following infection of hosts
with CRISPR resistance. Whereas phages always reached
similar titers when amplified for 24 hr on CRISPR-KO (knockout)
hosts, independent of the initial phage amount (Figures 2A–2C),
phage amplification on WT bacteria (one targeting spacer) was
dependent on the initial phage amount, with phage DMS3mvir
amplifying exclusively beyond a threshold of around 106 pla-
que-forming units (pfus), corresponding to an approximate mul-
tiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10�2 (Figures 2D–2F). For the Acr-
phages, this effect was even stronger on BIM2 (two targeting

epidemiological tipping points that depend both on the level of
host resistance and the strength of the Acr (Figures 2G–2L).
DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 could only cause an epidemic on BIM2 if the
initial amount of phage exceeded a threshold of �105 pfus, cor-
responding to an MOI of 10�3, and was driven extinct below this
threshold (Figure 2H), and for DMS3mvir-AcrIF4, approximately
100-fold more phage was necessary to cause an epidemic
(Figure 2I). On BIM5, the tipping point shifted to approximately
10-fold higher phage titers for both Acr-phages (Figures 2K
and 2L). Similar experiments with the parental phages JBD26
and JBD30 revealed a qualitatively similar correlation between
EOPs and phage amplification patterns on bacteria with CRISPR
resistance (one newly acquired targeting spacer) (Figure S1),
with a relatively low EOP and clear amplification threshold for
JBD26 (Figures S1A and S1D) and relatively high EOP and
no clear amplification threshold for JBD30 (Figures S1A and
S1E). However, unlike the DMS3mvir-based isogenic mutants,
JBD26 and JBD30 also displayed CRISPR-independent varia-
tion in their epidemiological dynamics (Figures S1B and S1C),
suggesting that differences in the amplification patterns of
JBD26 and JBD30 on CRISPR-resistant hosts are unlikely to
be solely due to their different Acrs.
Epidemiological Tipping Points in Acr-Phage
Amplification Are Not Due to Phage Evolution
Given that DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 epidemics
often required the bacterial cultures to be infected with higher

 amounts of phages, we hypothesized that they might be caused
by rare phage mutants that ‘‘escape’’ (partial) CRISPR resistance
due to mutations in their target sequence (protospacer) (Antia
et al., 2003; Deveau et al., 2008; Semenova et al., 2011; Levin
et al., 2013; van Houte et al., 2016b). To test this, we re-
sequenced the genomes of phage populations that were iso-
lated from the observed epidemics on WT, BIM2, and BIM5
following infection with 108 pfus, corresponding to an MOI of 1
(i.e., from Figures 2D–2F, 2H, 2I, 2K, and 2L). This showed that
the epidemic caused by control phage DMS3mvir on WT bacte-
ria was indeed caused by phage that carried a mutated
protospacer (i.e., mutation in the seed and protospacer adjacent
motif [PAM] region) (Figure S2A). However, in the context of
Acr-phages, we found only one example, namely that of
DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 on WT bacteria, where the epidemic was
associated with a protospacer mutation (Figure S2A). For all
other Acr-phage epidemics, protospacer SNP frequencies
were similar to those of the ancestral phage (Figure S2A). In
these cases, we could also not detect any differences in the abil-
ity of evolved and ancestral phages to amplify on the hosts with
CRISPR resistance they were isolated from (Figure S2B). There-
fore, unless the Acr is weak and the host carries only one spacer,
phage evolution cannot explain the observed epidemiological
tipping points of Acr-phages.
Acr-Phage Amplification Is Density Dependent
Having ruled out that the observed tipping points by Acr-phages
are the result of escape-phage evolution, we hypothesized that
the density of Acr-phages may determine the observed tipping
points. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether amplifica-
tion of Acr-phages was density dependent without altering the
initial amount of phages. This was done by measuring amplifica-
tion of the same initial amount of phages on different volumes
of bacterial host culture, generating a high phage-density
(HPD) condition (small volume), and a low phage-density (LPD)
condition (large volume). Phage amplification was greater on
CRISPR-KO hosts under LPD conditions compared to HPD con-
ditions, simply because the bacterial densities are constant
across the treatments and the large volume therefore contains
proportionally more bacteria on which the phage can replicate
(Figure 3; Table S1; F1,47 = 64.79, p < 0.0001). However, when
Acr-phages were amplified on hosts with CRISPR resistance
(BIM2 or BIM5), the greatest level of amplification was observed
under HPD conditions (Figure 3; Table S1; F1,47 = 47.17, p <
0.0001), demonstrating that Acr-phage amplification is indeed
positively density dependent. Furthermore, the level of amplifi-
cation of Acr-phages on a host with CRISPR resistance was in-
dependent of the presence of high amounts of phage DMS3mvir,
which lacks an acrIF gene, demonstrating that the observed
density dependence is specifically linked to the density of acr
genes and cannot be explained by saturation of CRISPR-Cas
complexes with targeted phage genomes (Figures S2C–S2F).
Consistent with Acr-phages only being able to successfully over-
come CRISPR resistance at high phage densities, we observed
at 2 days post-infection (dpi) an invasion of bacteria with surface-
based resistance under high Acr-phage-density treatments,
which was accompanied by a reduction in relative fitness of
CRISPR-resistant bacteria (Figure S3; F1,17 = 48.9, p < 0001).
Epidemiological Tipping Points Can Result from
Cooperation between Sequentially Infecting Acr-
Phages
The observed density-dependent phage amplification sug-
gested that Acr-phages may cooperate in order to successfully
amplify. For example, if co-infections were required to effectively
suppress host resistance, epidemiological tipping points could
correspond to parasite densities where co-infections become

 common (Regoes et al., 2002). However, this hypothesis is un-
likely to explain our results because the tipping points occurred
at MOI values where co-infections are expected to be rare (Fig-
ure 2). To explore what factors may cause the observed epidemi-
ological tipping points at low MOIs and in the absence of phage
evolution, we generated a theoretical model (see STAR Methods
for a detailed description of the model and the differential equa-
tions). Given that we aimed to understand how the observed
epidemiological tipping points could emerge without escape-
phage evolution, we modeled CRISPR-phage population dy-
namics using fixed bacterial and phage genotypes. In the model,
we can manipulate both the efficacy r of CRISPR resistance in
the bacteria (r increases with the number of spacers targeting
the phage) as well as the efficacy f of Acr in the phage (consis-
tent with the EOP data). In this form, the model predicts that upon
infection of 106 bacteria with CRISPR resistance, phages ex-
pressing a strong Acr can always amplify, regardless of the initial
phage density (Figure S4, f = 0.67, purple line), whereas phages
with a weak Acr can never amplify (Figure S4, f = 0.6 and f = 0.5,
magenta and green lines, respectively; gray lines correspond to
the initial amount of phage, and values below this line indicate a
lack of phage amplification). Given that these model predictions
are inconsistent with our experimental data, we then extended
the model by incorporating the assumption that during failed in-
fections, some Acr proteins are produced that cause the surviv-
ing host to enter a ‘‘suppressed’’ state (S). This immunosuppres-
sion decreases the efficacy of host resistance and allows
following phages to exploit these bacteria (Figure 4A). Crucially,
if the immunosuppressed state is assumed, the model predicts
epidemiological tipping points and, in accordance with our
empirical data, these tipping points occur at MOIs far below 1
(Figure 4B). Besides, our experimental observations that the po-
sition of the tipping points shifts when Acrs are weaker or host
resistance is stronger (Figure 2) are fully explained by our model
when we vary the effect of the efficacy f of the Acr in the phage
(Figure 4B) or the efficacy r of CRISPR resistance in the bacteria
(i.e., the number of spacers in the host targeting the phage; Fig-
ure 4C). Moreover, longer periods of immunosuppression shift
the tipping points to lower phage densities, as it increases the
probability that a host will be re-infected when it is still in the im-
munosuppressed state (Figure 4D, indicated by g). This model
therefore predicts that Acr-phage infections can cause bacteria
with CRISPR resistance to become immunosuppressed, allow-
ing cooperation between sequentially infecting Acr-phages to
overcome CRISPR immunity, which is a critical factor in deter-
mining whether Acr-phages can amplify.
Unsuccessful Infections by Acr-Phages Cause Hosts
with CRISPR Resistance to Become Immunosuppressed
To validate this model, we tested the key assumption that unsuc-
cessful infections by Acr-phages cause hosts with CRISPR
resistance to become immunosuppressed. To this end, we
pre-infected BIM2 and BIM5 with Acr-phages at a low MOI
(�0.3) and subsequently washed away all remaining phages
from the culture. We then measured the relative transformation
efficiency (RTE) of the surviving cells by transforming pre-in-
fected bacteria with either a CRISPR-targeted plasmid (T) or a
non-targeted plasmid (NT). For all phage treatments, the RTE
of pre-infected CRISPR-KO bacteria and no-phage controls
were not significantly different, as expected (Figure 5; Table
S2; F1,51 = 1.12, p = 0.35). However, when BIM2 or BIM5 were
pre-infected with phage DMS3mvir-AcrIF1, the RTE increased
significantly

suppression of hosts with CRISPR resistance following an un-
successful infection with Acr-phages. Consistent with its weaker

DISCUSSION
The discovery of acr genes has been a major breakthrough in
CRISPR-Cas research (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013). Much prog-
ress has been made toward biochemical characterization of Acrs
and the unraveling of their molecular mode of action. Here, we
studied the population dynamics associated with CRISPR-Acr
interactions and demonstrated that the initial density of Acr-
phages that infect bacteria with CRISPR resistance determines
whether phages go extinct or amplify. Our data and theory offer
a parsimonious explanation for these epidemiological tipping
points based on long-term suppression of CRISPR resistance
following an unsuccessful infection, which is consistent with
the slow dissociation kinetics of Acr-Cas protein complexes
(Chowdhury et al., 2017). During the initial stages of infection,
Acr-phage densities decline due to the high proportion of unsuc-
cessful infections (Figures S5A and S5B). However, as the den-
sities of immunosuppressed hosts increase, a greater proportion
of infections becomes successful. If the initial densities of Acr-
phages are high enough, densities of immunosuppressed hosts
reach a critical threshold where the amount of new Acr-phages
that are produced from successful infections outweighs the
loss of Acr-phages due to unsuccessful infections, causing the
epidemic to take off (Figure S5B). If this critical threshold is not
reached, the Acr-phages go extinct, and immunosuppressed
hosts revert to their resistant state (Figure S5A).
We ruled out that the need for high Acr-phage densities is sim-
ply linked to the evolution of phage escape mutations. When
phages lack acr genes, escape mutations are known to be an
important determinant for phage persistence in the face of
CRISPR-resistant bacteria (Deveau et al., 2008; Semenova
et al., 2011; Weinberger et al., 2012; Paez-Espino et al., 2013,
2015), provided the CRISPR-resistant clones carry a single
spacer (Levin et al., 2013) and the diversity of single spacer
clones in the bacterial population is low (Iranzo et al., 2013;
Childs et al., 2014, van Houte et al., 2016b). While escape muta-
tions in Acr-phages were not required for phage amplification at
high phage densities, they were still found to emerge when the
Acr was weak and the host carried only one spacer. Evolution
of escape mutants may therefore contribute to Acr-phage
persistence in nature where phages exist in populations that
are often genetically more heterogeneous than the initially clonal
populations used in our experiments.
When phages overcome CRISPR resistance, natural selection
likely favors the evolution of alternative host defense mecha-
nisms (van Houte et al., 2016a). Indeed, we observed that
bacteria
carrying
two
spacers
targeting
phage
DMS3vir-
AcrIF1 evolved surface-modification-based resistance at 2 dpi
when exposed to high Acr-phage densities but retained their
CRISPR-resistance phenotype when exposed to low Acr-phage
densities (Figure S3). As expected, this was associated with a
decreased fitness of the bacteria with CRISPR resistance rela-
tive to those with surface-modification-mediated resistance at
high but not at low Acr-phage densities (Figure S3). In nature,
bacteria inevitably have greater access to genes encoding for
alternative defense strategies that may be selected instead of
CRISPR-Cas or in combination with CRISPR-Cas to provide
synergistic levels of resistance, as was found to be the case
for CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification (Hynes et al.,
2014). Similarly, phage-encoded acr genes may drive the evolu-
tion of multiple CRISPR subtypes being encoded by the same
host to provide functional redundancy, explaining why hosts
often need a diversified defense arsenal.
The artificial lab media used in our experiments inevitably
lacks much of the biotic and abiotic complexity found in natural
environments. For example, in natural environments, different
CRISPR genotypes often coexist (Andersson and Banfield
2008), whereas in our experiments, we studied clonal popula-
tions of bacteria with CRISPR resistance. However, our theoret-
ical and experimental analyses suggest that the coexistence of
different CRISPR genotypes does not impact the observed
epidemiological dynamics of Acr-phages (Figures S5C–S5F).
Metagenomics analyses of bacteria-phage interactions in natural
communities will be essential to further map the evolutionary and
population dynamics of Acr-phages and their bacterial hosts.
Our experimental data suggest that the long-term immuno-
suppression following a failed infection by Acr-phages is an
important factor in determining Acr-phage population dynamics
and is cooperative in that it provides a benefit to Acr-phages
that sequentially infect the same host to overcome CRISPR

 resistance. Future studies aimed at measuring the costs and ben-
efits associated with phage-encoded acr genes and their natural
ecology will be critical to understanding the evolutionary drivers
of Acr-phage cooperation. Specifically, it is unclear whether last-
ing immunosuppression evolved because of the indirect fitness
benefits associated with the enhanced infection success of clone
mates in the population or whether it is primarily a by-product of
the direct individual-level benefits of suppressing the host im-
mune system (Sachs et al., 2004, West et al., 2007).
Positive density-dependent fitness effects, such as the one
observed here for Acr-phages, play an important role in various
ecological contexts, such as species invasions, extinctions, and
disease epidemics (Courchamp et al., 1999; Stephens and Su-
therland, 1999). Existing theory predicts that parasite density-
dependent tipping points in disease epidemics can occur
when the infection dynamics of an individual host depends on
the parasite dose, for example when there is a threshold in the
number of co-infecting parasites that are required to establish
a successful infection (Regoes et al., 2002). This work shows
that epidemiological tipping points can also take place under
conditions where parasite densities are too low for co-infections
to be common if unsuccessful infections leave behind an
immunosuppressed host. The profound epidemiological conse-
quences that were found to be associated with lasting immuno-
suppression in our empirical system warrant future studies to
explore whether similar effects play a role in the epidemiology
of other infectious diseases.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Bacterial strains
P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 (referred to as WT, carrying one spacer targeting DMS3mvir, see Table S3), and derived P. aeruginosa
UCBPP-PA14 strains BIM2, BIM3, BIM4, and BIM5, and the strain P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 csy3::LacZ (referred to as CRISPR-
KO, since it carries a disruption of an essential cas gene that causes the CRISPR-Cas system to be non-functional), and the
P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 csy3::LacZ-derived surface mutant 1 (referred to as SM (Westra et al., 2015)) were used in all experi-
ments. Phage was amplified on P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 csy3::LacZ. Cells were grown overnight at 37�C in either LB broth, or
M9 medium (22 mM Na2HPO4; 22 mM KH2PO4; 8.6 mM NaCl; 20 mM NH4Cl; 1 mM MgSO4; 0.1 mM CaCl2) supplemented with
0.2% glucose.
Virus strains
Temperate phages JBD26 and JBD30 were used in efficiency of plaquing experiments and infection assays in liquid medium and
have been previously described (Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013). Recombinant lytic phages DMS3vir, DMS3vir-AcrIF1, DMS3mvir,
DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 have been used in all experiments (described in Cady et al., 2012, Bondy-Denomy
et al., 2013, and van Houte et al., 2016b).
METHOD DETAILS
Evolution of P. aeruginosa PA14-derived BIMs
The P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 BIM2 strain (referred to as BIM2, carrying two spacers targeting DMS3mvir, see Table S3) was
evolved during infection of P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 with DMS3vir (Westra et al., 2015). P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 BIM3
(referred to as BIM3, carrying three spacers targeting DMS3mvir), BIM4 (referred to as BIM4, carrying one newly acquired and
two pre-existing spacers targeting JBD26 and JBD30) and BIM5 strains (referred to as BIM5, carrying five spacers targeting
DMS3mvir) were generated by challenging P. aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 BIM2 bacteria with escape phage in multiple rounds, giving
rise to BIM3, and finally BIM4 and BIM5.
Generation of recombinant phage
DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 phage was generated by homologous recombination with a plasmid-encoded acrIF4 gene (flanked by homology
arms) to replace the native acrIE3 gene of DMS3, as described in Bondy-Denomy et al., 2013, followed by truncation of the
c-repressor gene as described in Cady et al., 2012.
Efficiency of Plaquing assays
Efficiency of plaquing (EOP) assays were carried out on square polypropylene plates containing LB with 1.5% agar. A mixture of
molten soft LB agar (0.5%) and 300 mL of bacteria (grown overnight in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose) were poured
on top of the hard agar layer. Next, 5 mL of serially diluted phage was spotted on the resulting plates, which were subsequently incu-
bated overnight at 37�C and plaques were enumerated the next day.
Competition assays to measure fitness
Competition experiments were performed in glass vials in 6 mL M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Competition exper-
iments were initiated by inoculating 1:100 from a 1:1 mixture of overnight cultures (grown in M9 medium + 0.2% glucose) of the strain
with CRISPR resistance and either the sensitive CRISPR-KO strain or a CRISPR KO-derived surface mutant (described in Westra
et al., 2015). For the competitions between the strains with CRISPR resistance (WT, BIM2 or BIM5) and the sensitive CRISPR-KO
strain 104 plaque forming units (pfus) of either DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 or DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 phage was added to each glass vial.
At 0 and 24 hours after the start of the competition experiment samples were taken and cells were serially diluted in M9 salts
(22 mM Na2HPO4; 22 mM KH2PO4; 8.6 mM NaCl; 20 mM NH4Cl) and plated on LB agar supplemented with 50 mg,ml-1 X-gal (to allow
discrimination between bacteria with CRISPR resistance (white) and sensitive CRISPR-KO (blue) bacteria). For all competitions, a
control competition experiment was performed in the absence of phage. For the competitions between bacteria with CRISPR resis-
tance (BIM3) and surface mutants, 104, 105 or 106 pfus of DMS3vir-AcrIF1 phage was added to each glass vial. At 0 and 48 hours after
the start of the competition experiment samples were taken and processed as above.
Analysis of bacterial evolution of resistance
For evolution of bacterial resistance experiments 6 mL of M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose were inoculated with approx-
imately 108 bacteria, and 600 mL was inoculated with approximately 1010 bacteria, from fresh overnight cultures of BIM3 (2 spacers
targeting DMS3vir-AcrIF1 phage). These cultures were infected with 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 pfu of DMS3vir-AcrIF1 (Figure S3A) or
106 pfu of DMS3vir-AcrIF1 (Figure S3C), followed by incubation at 37�C and shaking at 180 rounds per minute (rpm). Cultures were
transferred 1:100 into fresh medium every 24 hours. Evolution of resistance was determined after 48 h by streaking individual clones
through DMS3vir and DMS3vir-AcrIF1. Surface modification was confirmed by colony morphology, broad-range resistance of
Cell 174, 908–916.e1–e6, August 9, 2018
e3
 colonies to DMS3vir phages carrying Acr genes, and lack of newly acquired spacers. CRISPR-Cas-mediated immunity was
confirmed by PCR using primers 50-CTAAGCCTTGTACGAAGTCTC-30 and 50-CGCCGAAGGCCAGCGCGCCGGTG-30 for CRISPR
array 1, and primers 50-GCCGTCCAGAAGTCACCACCCG-30 and 50-TCAGCAAGTTACGAGACCTCG-30 for CRISPR array 2.
Infection assays in liquid medium
Infection assays were performed in glass vials by inoculating 6 mL M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose with approximately
108 colony forming units (cfus) bacteria from fresh overnight cultures (also grown in M9 medium + 0.2% glucose) of either the
CRISPR-KO, WT, BIM2 or BIM5 strain. To these microcosms 104, 105, 106, 107 or 108 pfus of either DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1
or DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 phage were added. Microcosms were incubated at 37�C while shaking at 180 rpm. Phage was extracted at
24 hours after the start of the experiment by chloroform extraction on all samples (sample: chloroform 10:1 v/v), and phage titers
were determined by spotting isolated phage samples on a lawn of CRISPR-KO bacteria. For the experiment shown in Figures
S2C–S2F and S5F the same protocol was used but with 108 pfus DMS3mvir added to each treatment at the start of the experiment
(Figures S2D and S2F) or using a bacterial population that consisted of an equal mix of BIM2 and BIM5 (Figure S5F). For the infection
assays in which phage densities were manipulated by using different volumes of growth medium (Figure 3), glass vials containing
6 mL M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose were used for the high phage-density (HPD) treatment. These were inoculated
with approximately 108 cfus of bacteria from fresh overnight cultures of the CRISPR-KO, BIM2 or BIM5 strains, as above. For the low
phage-density (LPD) treatment Duran 1L glass bottles containing 600 mL M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose were used,
which were inoculated with approximately 1010 cfus of bacteria from the same overnight cultures. To both glass vials and bottles
phage was added (106 pfus of DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 or DMS3mvir for infection of BIM2; 107 pfus of DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 or DMS3mvir
for infection of BIM5; 108 pfus of DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 or DMS3mvir for infection of both BIM2 and BIM5). Glass vials and bottles
were incubated at 37�C while shaking at 180 rpm. Total phage was extracted at 24 hours after the start of the experiment and phage
titers were determined as described above.
Deep sequencing of phages
From the experiments shown in Figures 2D–2F, 2H, 2I, 2K, and 2L, phage was isolated at 24 hpi from the treatments that were in-
fected with 108 pfus of phage (MOI = 1). These phages were used for a new round of infection assays in liquid media (Figure S2B),
effectively following the methods described above, and for deep sequencing analysis (Figure S2A). To obtain sufficient material for
the latter, isolated phage was amplified on plate by infecting a lawn of the CRISPR-KO strain and harvesting phage by adding M9
salts solution and subsequent chloroform extraction. Phage samples from all replicates within a single treatment were pooled. As
controls, ancestral DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 and DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 phage were processed in parallel. Phage genomic DNA
extraction was performed with 600 mL sample at approximately 1012 pfu/ml using the Norgen phage DNA isolation kit, following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Barcoded Illumina Truseq Nano libraries were constructed from each DNA sample with an approx-
imately 350 bp insert size and 2 3 250 bp reads generated on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Reads were trimmed using Cutadapt
version 1.2.1 and Sickle version 1.200 and then overlapping reads merged using Flash version 1.2.11 to create high quality sequence
at approximately 8000 3 coverage of DMS3mvir per sample. These reads were mapped to the DMS3 reference genome (NCBI
RefSeq: NC_008717) using bwa mem version 0.7.12 and allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms within viral target re-
gions quantified using samtools mpileup version 0.1.19. Draft genomes were constructed using the ancestral sample sequences
which were randomly subsampled to 10000 reads per sample. Assembly was done using SPAdes version 3.5.0 run in ‘careful’
mode. Assemblies were visualized using Bandage version 0.8.1 and a single contig was extracted based on coverage. Contigs
were annotated using Prokka version 1.12.
Long-term immunosuppression experiment
For the long-term immunosuppression experiment (Figure 5) bacteria were transformed with plasmid pHERD30T and a pHERD30T-
derived plasmid that was a priori targeted by the PA14 WT Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. This mutant plasmid pHERD30Ttarg was
generated by inserting a 32-nt protospacer sequence flanked by a GG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) with full complementarity to
spacer 1 in CRISPR locus 2 of the PA14 WT Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. This was done by ligation of T4 Polynucleotide Kinase
phosphorylated oligonucleotides that upon annealing create overhangs that are compatible with HindIII ligation (50-agctt
ACCGCGCTCGACTACTACAACGTCCGGCTGATGGa-30
and
50-agcttCCATCAGCCGGACGTTGTAGTAGTCGAGCGCGGTa-30,
HindIII overhangs in small caps, protospacer sequence in capitals and PAM underlined) in the HindIII-digested Antarctic phospha-
tase-treated pHERD30T vector. Suppression of CRISPR immunity by Acr was measured through a transformation assay. Overnight
cultures of CRISPR-KO, BIM2 or BIM5 bacteria (approximately 5*109 cfus) grown in LB broth were either not infected or infected with
1.6*109 pfus DMS3mvir, DMS3mvir-AcrIF1 or DMS3mvir-AcrIF4 in 50 mL Falcon tubes containing 10 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth,
and incubated at 37�C while shaking at 180 rpm for 2 hours. Bacteria were harvested by spinning at 3500 rpm for 30 minutes. A sam-
ple from the supernatant was used to quantify phage titers following chloroform extraction as described above (data not shown). The
bacterial pellet was further processed for the transformation assay. First, cells were washed twice in 1 mL of a 300 mM sucrose so-
lution to make them competent (Choi et al., 2006). Next, the pellet was resuspended in 300 mL of 300 mM sucrose, and 100 mL from
this was used for plating on LB agar to enumerate total bacterial cfus after the infection and sucrose-washing steps (data not shown).
Finally, the remaining 200 mL was divided in equal volumes over two eppendorf tubes, and used for electrotransformation with either
e4
Cell 174, 908–916.e1–e6, August 9, 2018
 plasmid pHERD30T (not targeted by CRISPR-Cas; NT) or pHERD30Ttarg (targeted by CRISPR-Cas; T). Electroporated bacteria were
resuspended in 1 mL LB broth and incubated 1h at 37�C at 180 rpm. Bacteria were then pelleted and resuspended in 100 mL LB and
plated on LB agar plates containing Gentamycin (50 mg,ml-1) and incubated for 16h at 37�C to allow transformants to grow.
Mathematical modeling
We developed the following epidemiological model to understand the dynamics of bacteriophages that carry an anti-CRISPR mech-
anism (Acr) in a host population with CRISPR resistance, with all simulations performed in Mathematica version 11.2.
Resistant bacteria may either be in their normal resistant state (the density of these bacteria is noted RðtÞ) or in an immunosup-
pressed state (the density of these bacteria is noted SðtÞ).
Initially the host population is homogeneous, consisting exclusively of bacteria with CRISPR resistance, and the density of these
resistant bacteria is Rð0Þ. Then an inoculum of free Acr-phage particles with density Vð0Þ is introduced in the host population. Free
Acr-phage particles adsorb to the bacteria at a rate a. When a free Acr-phage adsorbs to a bacterium with CRISPR resistance three
outcomes are possible:
(i) with probability r the Acr-phage genome is destroyed and there is no change in bacterial resistance (i.e., no immunosuppres-
sion). Hence, r is a measure of bacterial resistance and increases with the number of spacers targeting the phage,
(ii) with probability ð1 � rÞf the Acr-phage genome is not destroyed because of Acr activity. In this case the infection therefore
leads to cell lysis, with the release of B new Acr-phage particles. The efficacy of Acr activity is thus measured with f (the greater
f the higher the Acr efficacy is).
(iii) with probability ð1 � rÞð1 � fÞ, the Acr-phage fails to complete its lytic cycle but expresses some Acr before the Acr-phage
genome is cleaved, which blocks bacterial CRISPR resistance causing the bacterium to become immunosuppressed. This
state is reversible and immunosuppressed bacteria become resistant again at rate g.
If an immunosuppressed bacterium is infected by an Acr-phage, the absence of immunity allows the Acr-phage to complete its lytic
life cycle. This yields the following set of ordinary differential equations (see Figure 4A):
_
RðtÞ = � ðað1 � rÞVðtÞÞRðtÞ + g SðtÞ
_
SðtÞ = að1 � rÞð1 � fÞVðtÞRðtÞ � ðg + a VðtÞÞSðtÞ
_
VðtÞ = að1 � rÞfB VðtÞRðtÞ + aB VðtÞSðtÞ � aðSðtÞ + RðtÞÞVðtÞ
(1)
Initially there are no immunosuppressed bacteria around (i.e., Sð0Þ = 0) and if a few Acr-phage particles are introduced the Acr-
phage population will increase if the Acr activity is higher than a threshold value:
f > f0 =
1
ð1 � rÞB
(2)
In other words, when f is low and r is high the phage population cannot take off when the inoculum of the Acr-phage is small (Fig-
ures 4B and 4C).
Yet, if one introduces a sufficiently high density of Acr-phages they will shut down the immunity of the bacterial population and will
increase the density of immunosuppressed bacteria. At time T the following condition may be verified
f > f0
�
1 � SðTÞ
RðTÞ ðB � 1Þ
�
(3)
and the Acr-phage population may thus take off for lower values of Acr activity. Conditions (2) and (3) indicate a range of values of f
where the epidemiological outcome depends on the initial density of the Acr-phage (epidemiological bistability). Note that the
threshold value of the density of Acr-phage leading to an epidemic depends also on the duration of the immunosuppression (see
Figure 4D).
In Figure S4 we illustrate the epidemiological dynamics taking place when the initial density of the Acr-phage is either below or
above the threshold value of the phage inoculum. Below the threshold (Figure S4A), the density of immunosuppressed bacteria
does not reach a high enough level to satisfy condition (3) and the Acr-phage population goes extinct. Above the threshold (Fig-
ure S4B), the immunosuppressed bacteria reaches a high enough density, condition (3) is verified and the Acr-phage population
can exploit the whole bacteria population.
Cell 174, 908–916.e1–e6, August 9, 2018
e5
 The above model assumes that the host population is initially monomorphic (i.e., only one type of resistant bacteria). We can relax
this assumption and consider a case where the initial population is composed of n different resistant bacteria. The initial frequency of
these different bacteria is assumed to be pi and each resistant may have a different efficacy of resistance ri. In this case, the threshold
value of the Acr efficacy becomes (compare with (2)):
f > f0 =
1
Pn
i = 1pið1 � riÞB
(4)
Below this threshold, the Acr-phage will be able to induce an epidemic only if the initial density of the virus is above a threshold
density. In other words, the initial diversity of the host population does not affect qualitatively the behavior of the system: the exis-
tence of an epidemiological bistability is robust to the existence of an initially diverse bacteria population. In Figures S5C and S5D we
illustrate the epidemiological dynamics taking place when the initial density of the Acr-phage is either below or above the threshold
value of the phage inoculum in a situation where the initial bacterial population is polymorphic (compare with Figures S5A and S5B). In
Figure S5E we show the effect of increasing inoculum size on the final phage population size in a situation where the initial bacterial
population is polymorphic (compare with Figure 4B).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All experiments were carried out in at least six biological replicates (n R 6). Statistical parameters and tests are stated in figure leg-
ends, figures and results. Unless otherwise stated, the statistical tests used were general linear models with the appropriate error
structure with significance determined by stepwise model simplification comparing full and null models using ANOVA. Model resid-
uals were checked to satisfy the assumptions made by each model. In all cases the threshold for significance was p < 0.05. Analysis
was conducted in R version 3.4.1. Figures were created using SigmaPlot version 12, and CorelDRAW version x7.
Efficiency of Plaquing assays
EOP was calculated based on the number of phage plaques on CRISPR-KO and CRISPR resistant hosts.
EOP = #plaques on CRISPR resistant host
#plaques on CRISPR KO host
Competition assays to measure fitness
Relative frequencies of the strains with CRISPR resistance compared to the competing CRISPR-KO strain were determined through
colony numbers and used to calculate the relative fitness.
Relative fitness = ðfraction strain A at t = xÞ 3 ð1 � ðfraction strain A at t = 0ÞÞ
ðfraction strain A at t = 0Þ 3 ð1 � ðfraction strain A at t = xÞÞ
Long-term immunosuppression experiment
Relative transformation efficiency was calculated using the number of transformed colonies on antibiotic selection plates for each of
the four phage treatments.
Relative transformation efficiency = #colonies transformed with T plasmid
#colonies transformed with NT plasmid

(pfu/ml) at the start of the experiment (corresponding to the addition of 104, 105, 106, 107 or 108 pfus). Colored points represent phage titers at 24 hpi; each data
point represents an independent biological replicate (n = 6). The limit of detection is 200 pfu/ml.
 Figure S3. Surface Mutants Invade the Bacterial Population at High Acr-Phage Densities, Related to Figure 3
(A) Resistance phenotypes (C = CRISPR resistance, SM = surface resistance) that evolved at 48 hpi with phage DMS3vir-AcrIF1 at the indicated MOIs. All bacteria
in the populations initially had CRISPR resistance (2 spacers targeting the phage). Phage amplification was observed at an MOI of 10�2 or higher.
(B) Relative fitness of bacteria with CRISPR resistance (2 spacers targeting the phage) and surface resistance in the presence of phage DMS3vir-AcrIF1 at the
indicated MOIs.
(C) Resistance phenotypes (C = CRISPR resistance, SM = surface resistance) that evolved at 48 hpi with phage DMS3vir-AcrIF1 under either high phage densities
(HPD, 6 mL culture) or low phage densities (LPD, 600 mL culture). All bacteria in the populations initially had CRISPR resistance (2 spacers targeting the phage).
Data correspond to the mean of 6 independent replicate experiments. Error bars represent 95% c.i.
 Figure S4. Partial Immunity Alone Cannot Explain the Observed Epidemiological Tipping Points, Related to Figure 4
Model predictions of the effect of initial Acr-phage inoculum density on the phage density at 24hpi for different values of Acr strength when no immunosup-
pressive state S is assumed in the model (f = 0.67, 0.6 and 0.5; purple, magenta, green respectively); other parameter values: B = 5, a = 0.001, g = 20, r = 0.7. Grey
line corresponds to the initial amount of phage and values below this line indicate a lack of phage amplification.
 Figure S5. Model Predictions of the Temporal Population Dynamics of Acr-Phage and Resistant and Immunosuppressed Hosts, Related to
Figure 5
(A and B) Model predictions for the densities of resistant bacteria (black), immunosuppressed bacteria (orange) and phages (red) across time for two initial
inoculum sizes: (A) V(0) = 5.104, (B) V(0) = 8.104. Other parameter values: R(0) = 106, B = 5, a = 0.001, g = 20, r = 0.7.
(C and D) Model predictions of the temporal population dynamics of Acr-phage and resistant and immunosuppressed hosts when the bacteria is initially
composed of two different resistant hosts with different efficacy of resistance (r1 = 0.7 and r2 = 0.4) in equal frequency, with the densities of the two resistant
bacteria (full and dashed black lines, respectively), immunosuppressed bacteria (orange) and phages (red) across time for two initial inoculum sizes: (C) V(0) =
5.104, (D) V(0) = 6.104. Other parameter values: B = 5, a = 0.001, g = 20.
(E) Effect of initial Acr-phage inoculum density on the phage density at 24 hpi for different values of Acr efficacy (f = 0.42 (purple), f = 0.35 (magenta) and f = 0.2
(green)) when the bacteria is initially composed of two different resistant hosts with different efficacy of resistance (r1 = 0.7 and r2 = 0.4) in equal frequency. Other

(F) Viral titers at 24 hpi of a 50:50 mix of BIM2 and BIM5 with 104, 105, 106, 107 or 108 pfus DMS3mvir-AcrIF1. Grey circles indicate the phage titers (pfu/ml) at the
start of the experiment. Colored points represent phage titers at 24 hpi; each data point represents an independent biological replicate (n = 6). The limit of
detection is 200 pfu/ml.
