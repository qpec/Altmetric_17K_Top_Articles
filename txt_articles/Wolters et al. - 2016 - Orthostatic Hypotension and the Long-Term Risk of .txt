Abstract
Background
Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common cause of transient cerebral hypoperfusion in the
population. Cerebral hypoperfusion is widely implicated in cognitive impairment, but
whether OH contributes to cognitive decline and dementia is uncertain. We aimed to deter-
mine the association between OH and the risk of developing dementia in the general
population.
Methods and Findings
Between 4 October 1989 and 17 June 1993, we assessed OH in non-demented, stroke-
free participants of the population-based Rotterdam Study. OH was defined as a �20 mm
Hg drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or �10 mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) within 3 min from postural change. We furthermore calculated within participant vari-
ability in SBP related to postural change, expressed as coefficient of variation. Follow-up
for dementia was conducted until 1 January 2014. We determined the risk of dementia in
relation to OH and SBP variability, using a Cox regression model, adjusted for age; sex;
smoking status; alcohol intake; SBP; DBP; cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein ratio; diabe-
tes; body mass index; use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or anticholinergic medication;
and apolipoprotein E genotype. Finally, we explored whether associations varied according
to compensatory increase in heart rate. Among 6,204 participants (mean ± standard devia-
tion [SD] age 68.5 ± 8.6 y, 59.7% female) with a median follow-up of 15.3 y, 1,176 devel-
oped dementia, of whom 935 (79.5%) had Alzheimer disease and 95 (8.1%) had vascular
dementia. OH was associated with an increased risk of dementia (adjusted hazard ratio
[aHR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.00–1.34, p = 0.05), which was similar for Alzheimer disease and vas-
cular dementia. Similarly, greater SBP variability with postural change was associated with

OH who lacked a compensatory increase in heart rate (within lowest quartile of heart rate
response: aHR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85, p-interaction = 0.05). Limitations of this study
include potential residual confounding despite rigorous adjustments, and potentially limited
generalisability to populations not of European descent.

In this population predominantly of European descent, OH was associated with an increase
in long-term risk of dementia.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Orthostatic hypotension is a common cause of transient cerebral hypoperfusion that is
associated with subclinical brain disease, as well as increased risk of stroke.
• Hypoperfusion has been implicated in the pathophysiology of dementia, but whether
orthostatic hypotension affects the risk of dementia is uncertain.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• Back in 1990, we measured orthostatic hypotension in 6,204 community-dwelling indi-
viduals participating in the Dutch population-based Rotterdam Study, and we followed
these people for occurrence of dementia until 2014.
• Having orthostatic hypotension at start of the study increased the risk of developing
dementia over the next 25 years by 15%, with similar results for all-cause dementia and
Alzheimer disease.
• The risk of dementia was particularly increased when the orthostatic blood pressure
drops were not compensated for by a sufficient increase in heart rate.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• These findings suggest that transient cerebral hypoperfusion plays a role in the aetiology
of dementia and that further studies are warranted to investigate the effects of hypoper-
fusion and treatment of orthostatic hypotension on markers of neurodegenerative dis-
ease and cognition.

 Introduction
Cardiovascular health is now well-established as a key determinant in the prevention of
dementia, including Alzheimer disease [1,2], but the mechanisms by which vascular damage
leads to cognitive decline remain largely unknown. As cerebral hypoperfusion is widely impli-
cated in dementia [3,4], cerebral haemodynamics have been suggested as a potential link
between vascular risk factors and dementia [5]. Two important mechanisms for maintenance
of proper and continuous cerebral perfusion are local vasoreactivity and autonomous nervous
system function. Cerebral vasoreactivity has indeed been found to be associated with the risk of
developing dementia in the general population [6], but the role of autonomous nervous system
function in the onset of dementia has been less well studied.
Autonomic dysfunction may result in orthostatic hypotension (OH), which affects 20%–
30% of the elderly population [7,8]. OH is characterised by a marked drop in blood pressure fol-
lowing postural change, insufficiently compensated for by sympathetic and parasympathetic
mechanisms. This drop in blood pressure may elicit transient cerebral hypoperfusion, especially
in the absence of a compensatory increase in heart rate. OH is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular events, stroke, and mortality [9]. Moreover, OH is highly prevalent among
patients with dementia and mild cognitive impairment, compared to healthy controls [10–13],
but only one study has assessed the longitudinal relation between OH and the risk of dementia
in initially healthy participants. In this Swedish population, OH was associated with an
increased risk of dementia at re-examination after 6 y, but the investigators were unable to
adjust for cardiovascular risk factors aside from hypertension, and attrition was substantial,
with 37.5% of participants lost to follow-up between examination rounds [14]. These limited
data regarding OH and cognition prompted a recent review and meta-analysis to conclude that
longitudinal studies using standardised criteria are needed to elucidate whether OH is an inde-
pendent risk factor for developing dementia [9,15]. We therefore aimed to determine the associ-
ation between OH and the risk of dementia, in a long-term, ongoing population-based study.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The Rotterdam Study has medical ethics committee approval per the Population Study Act
Rotterdam Study, executed by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports of the Netherlands.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. For the current study, the analy-
sis plan was drafted in June 2015.
Study Population
This study is embedded within the Rotterdam Study, a large ongoing population-based cohort
study in the Netherlands, with an initial study population of 7,983 participants (78% of invi-
tees) aged �55 y from the Ommoord area, a suburb of Rotterdam. The Rotterdam Study meth-
ods have been describedin detail previously [16]. In brief, participants were interviewedat
home and subsequently examined at the research centre for baseline assessment from October
1989 to July 1993. OH was determined during baseline assessment. Of 7,983 interviewedpar-
ticipants, 7,157 (89.7%) visited the research centre for the baseline physical examination. As of
2015, five follow-up examinations have been carried out.
Orthostatic Hypotension Assessment
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using an automatic recorder (Dinamap, Criti-
kon). The baseline blood pressure reading was the mean of two measurements on the right

 upper arm with the participant in supine position, after 5 min of rest. Measurements were
repeated in the standing position after 1, 2, and 3 min. OH was defined as �20 mm Hg
decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or �10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) after postural change at any of the three measurements, in accordance with the Consen-
sus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology
[17,18]. We defined severity of OH by degree of blood pressure drop, i.e., �20/10 but <30/15,
�30/15 but <40/20, and �40/20 mm Hg. We calculated continuous measures of blood pres-
sure change in response to postural change, expressed as the coefficientof variation of within
participant variability, defined as the ratio of the standard deviation (SD) to the mean of all
measurements (i.e., measurements in supine and upright position combined). Furthermore, we
determined the maximum increase in heart rate within 3 min after postural change. Directly
afterwards, participants were asked whether they had felt unwell within the minutes following
postural change.
Dementia Screening and Cognitive Function Assessment
Participants were screened for dementia at baseline and follow-up examinations using a three-
step protocol [19]. Screening was done using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and
the Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMS) organic level. Those with MMSE < 26 or GMS > 0
subsequently underwent examination and informant interview using the Cambridge Examina-
tion for Mental Disorders of the Elderly (CAMDEX). Additionally, the total cohort was contin-
uously monitored for dementia through computerised linkage of medical records from general
practitioners and the regional institute for outpatient mental healthcare with the study data-
base. Available neuroimaging data were used when required for establishing a diagnosis. For all
suspected cases of dementia, a consensus panel led by a consultant neurologist (P. J. K.) decided
on the final diagnosis in accordance with standard criteria for dementia (DSM-III-R), Alzhei-
mer disease (NINCDS-ADRDA), and vascular dementia (NINDS-AIREN). Follow-up until 1
January 2014 was near complete (94.0% of potential person years), and participants were cen-
sored within this follow-up period at date of dementia diagnosis, date of death, date of loss to
follow-up, or 1 January 2014, whichever came first.
Other Measurements
We assessed smoking status (i.e., current, former, never), alcohol intake, use of antihyperten-
sive medication, use of lipid-lowering medication, and use of anticholinergic medication at
baseline by interview. Anticholinergic medication included antipsychotic and antidepressant
medication, but also drugs prescribed against parkinsonism, urinary incontinence, or
obstructive pulmonary disease that can have anticholinergic side effects. Fasting serum lipid
levels were measured at baseline. Hypertension was defined as the use of antihypertensive
medication and/or elevated systolic or DBP (>140/90 mm Hg). Body mass index (kg/m2)
was computed from measurements of height and weight. Diabetes mellitus was defined as
the use of blood-glucose-lowering medication at baseline or a random serum glucose level
�11.1 mmol/l [20]. Myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation were assessed by direct ques-
tioning and presence of abnormalities on a 12-lead electrocardiogramas determined by
study physicians and reviewed by a cardiologist. Heart failure was determined using a vali-
dated score, similar to the definition of heart failure of the European Society of Cardiology
[21]. APOE genotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction on coded DNA
samples.

 Analysis
Analyses included all non-demented, stroke-free participants attending the study centre for
examination. Of 7,157 participants attending the study centre, 531 were ineligible due to
prevalent dementia (n = 312), stroke (n = 168), or both (n = 51). Missing covariate data
(maximum 17.6%), except for APOE genotype, were imputed using 5-fold multiple imputa-
tion, based on determinant (presence of OH and postural SBP variability), outcome, and
included covariates. Distribution of covariates was similar in the imputed versus non-
imputed dataset.
We determined the association between presence of OH and incident dementia, using Cox
proportional hazard models. We repeated the analysis with dementia or death as a joint out-
come measure, to reduce selection due to competing risk (upon referee’s request). Subse-
quently, we analysed categories of increasing severity of orthostatic blood pressure drop, and
OH with and without feeling unwell. Because of right-skewedness, we performed a natural log-
arithmic transformation of SBP variability to obtain a roughly normal distribution (mean
−2.52, SD 0.58). Z-scores were computed by dividing the difference between the individual
value and the population mean by the population SD. We determined the association between
SBP variability related to postural change and incident dementia, per quartile and continuously
per SD increase, using a Cox model. To eliminate a paradoxical impact of high blood pressure
variability in those with excessive increases, we repeated analyses after excluding those with a
�20 mm Hg increase in SBP or �10 mm Hg increase in DBP within 3 min (upon referee’s
request). Furthermore, we determined whether associations extended to those without a formal
diagnosis of OH. We then assessed whether the risk of dementia in relation to orthostatic
blood pressure drops was modifiedby response in heart rate after postural change, by testing
for multiplicative interaction in the above Cox model and providing risk estimates of OH for
dementia per quartile of response in heart rate. We verified that the proportional hazard
assumption was not violated in these models by plotting the partial (Schoenfeld) residuals
against follow-up time.
All analyses were adjusted for age and sex (model I), and additionally in a second model for
smoking status, alcohol intake, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive
medication, ratio of serum total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, use of lipid-lowering
medication, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, use of anticholinergic medication, and APOE
genotype (model II).
We repeated the analyses for Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia separately, after cen-
soring participants at time of incident stroke, after excluding those with Parkinson disease at
baseline, after excluding those with heart disease (i.e., coronary heart disease, heart failure,
atrial fibrillation; upon referee’s request), and after excluding those with possible postural
tachycardia syndrome (defined as a �30 beats per minute increase in heart rate or any heart
rate of �120 beats per minute). Finally, we performed several sensitivity analyses: (1) for men
and women separately, (2) for persons above and below the median age (68.5 y), (3) excluding
the first 5 y of follow-up to assess for reverse causality, (4) for those with and without heart fail-
ure at baseline, (5) for those with and without a history of hypertension, (6) distinguishing use
of antihypertensive drugs, and (7) for those with and without diabetes (upon referee’s request).
Finally, we repeated analyses for OH, SBP variability, and dementia risk in a subset of partici-
pants without significant comorbidity (i.e., excluding those with heart disease, Parkinson dis-
ease, and diabetes; upon referee’s request).
All analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.0. Alpha level (type 1 error) was
set at 0.05.

 Results
Of 6,626 eligible participants, 6,303 (95.1%) underwent examination for OH. No baseline
blood pressure measurement was obtained in eight individuals, and no measurement after pos-
tural change in 91 individuals, leaving a total of 6,204 (93.6%) cases for analysis. Baseline char-
acteristics of participants are shown in Table 1.
Overall, 1,152/6,204 (18.6%) participants had OH. The prevalence of OH steeply increased
with age, to 30.6% of those aged �75 y. Although prevalence in the elderly was similar for men
and women, there was a slightly higher prevalence in women at younger ages (Fig 1). Of all
patients with OH, 160 (13.9%) reported feeling unwell along with their blood pressure drop.
During a median follow-up time of 15.3 y (interquartile range 8.3–20.8), 1,176 individuals
developed dementia, of whom 935 (79.5%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease, 95 (8.1%)
with vascular dementia, 43 (3.7%) with Parkinson dementia, and 30 (2.6%) with another type
of dementia, and in 73 (6.2%) no definite subdiagnosis could be made. Of all incident dementia
cases, 129 were preceded by a stroke a median 3.7 y (interquartile range 1.2–7.2) before diagno-
sis of dementia.

 OH at baseline was associated with an increased risk of dementia during follow-up (adjusted
hazard ratio [aHR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.00–1.34, p = 0.05; Table 2). Similarly on a continuous scale,
variability in SBP related to postural change was associated with an increased risk of dementia
(aHR per SD increase: 1.08, 95% CI 1.01–1.16, p = 0.02). This association was similar when
excluding those who fulfilledthe formal criteria for OH (aHR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00–1.17) and
unaltered by excluding those with a marked increase in blood pressure following postural
change (see S1 Table). Results were similar for Alzheimer disease only. For vascular dementia,
we observedhigher risk estimates with OH than for Alzheimer disease in the age- and sex-
adjusted model (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97–2.43), but these were largely explained by cardiovascu-
lar risk factors, so that fully adjusted estimates were similar to those for Alzheimer disease
(aHR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73–1.96; Table 2). We did not observe a clear exposure-response relation
for severity of OH, because of lower effect estimates for participants with the most severe blood

 pressure drops (Fig 2). In contrast, the risk of dementia strongly increased per quartile of blood
pressure variability (Fig 2; for a full table with risk estimates per quartile and per SD, see S2
Table). Risk estimates were similar when modelling dementia or death as a joint outcome (OH:
aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08–1.27; blood pressure variability: aHR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.12). Estimates
for both OH and SBP variability were attenuated when incorporating these simultaneously in a
model (OH: aHR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90–1.27; blood pressure variability: aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99–
1.14).
Results for OH where individuals reported feeling unwell along with the blood pressure
drop were similar to results for OH without feeling unwell (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 0.86–1.66, versus
aHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98–1.34, respectively). The risk of dementia related to OH was most pro-
found in participants who lacked a compensatory increase in heart rate (aHR for lowest quar-
tile of heart rate response 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85, p-value for interaction = 0.05; Fig 3). This
risk was similar after excluding all participants taking beta-blockers (see S2 Table).

 Sensitivity analyses showed similar results after censoring for incident stroke, excluding par-
ticipants with prevalent Parkinson disease, excluding those with possible postural tachycardia
syndrome, or omitting the first 5 y of follow-up (Table 3). A history of hypertension or use of
any antihypertensive medication did not modify the risk of dementia associated with OH
(Table 3). Amongst 177 participants with heart failure at baseline, risk estimates for OH were
higher than in those without heart failure, albeit not statistically significantly (aHR 1.52, 95%
CI 0.63–3.66, p-value for interaction = 0.07). Risk estimates for both OH and SBP variability
were slightly stronger when excluding participants with cardiac disease, neurodegenerative
comorbidity, or diabetes all together (see S3 Table).
Discussion
In this large population-based study, OH was present in nearly one in five participants and was
associated with a 15% increase in long-term risk of dementia. The risk of developing dementia
was highest in those with OH lacking a compensatory increase in heart rate. Similarly, higher
variability in blood pressure related to postural change was associated with a higher risk of
dementia, even in individuals without a formal diagnosis of OH.
Prevalence of OH in our study was high and increased steeply with age, in line with previous
studies among individuals within a similar age range in the community [7,8]. A few studies
have investigated OH in relation to cognitive test performance. In the ARIC study, OH was

 associated with decline on two cognitive tests, but this decline was largely explained by cardio-
vascular risk factors [22]. Two smaller studies found no overall association between OH and
decline on the MMSE after 2 y [7,23]. Conversely, OH was found to increase the risk of conver-
sion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia after 3 y [24], as well as the risk of dementia
in patients with Parkinson disease [25]. Only one other study has assessed the relation between
OH and the risk of dementia in initially healthy individuals. In a sample of 1,480 individuals in
the Swedish general population, OH was associated with the risk of having dementia at re-
examination after 6 y [14]. However, the investigators were unable to fit survival models or
adjust for cardiovascular risk factors aside from hypertension, and attrition was substantial,
with 37.5% of participants lost to follow-up [14]. We found OH to be associated with long-
term risk of dementia on continuous follow-up, independent of various other risk factors.
The most apparent explanation for our findings is that OH causes brain damage due to
recurrent transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Autonomic nervous system function is responsible
for maintaining continuous cerebral perfusion, together with local vasoreactivity, which has
previously been associated with the risk of dementia in the general population [6]. Brief epi-
sodes of hypoperfusion elicited by sudden blood pressure drops may lead to hypoxia, with det-
rimental effects on brain tissue via, for instance, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress [26].
These mechanisms have been suggested to be of particular relevance in the pathogenesis of
small vessel disease [27], and orthostatic blood pressure drops in patients with dementia have
been associated with deep white matter and basal ganglia hyperintensities [28], albeit not with
overall white matter lesion volume [29]. The reduction in cerebral blood flow with autonomic
failure has also been reported to predominantly affect the hippocampus [30], possibly linking
hypoperfusion to early Alzheimer pathology. Another potential explanation for our findings
might be that OH serves as a marker of other detrimental consequences of autonomic dysfunc-
tion, such as blood pressure variability [31,32], response to Valsalva manoeuvre [13,33], car-
diovascular reflex and heart rate variability [34,35], and 30/15 ratio [35]. Several of these
measures may be linked to dementia via hypoperfusion, but other pathways could be involved
also. For instance, decreased arterial wall compliance with hypertension likely contributes to
OH by diminishing baroreceptor sensitivity [36]. Arterial stiffness and OH are both associated
with increased burden of cerebral white matter lesions and vascular disease including stroke
[9,28,37,38]. As these are established risk factors for dementia, these conditions may act as
mediators or indicate shared aetiology between diseases. Nevertheless, we did not see risk esti-
mates for all-cause dementia attenuated after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, cen-
soring for clinical stroke, or restricting the population to those without cardiac or
neurodegenerative comorbidities. Alternatively, sympathetic failure can occur with diabetic
neuropathy, and although we adjusted for clinical history of diabetes, some patients with
impaired fasting glucose might already have had autonomic derailment together with subclini-
cal small vessel disease. We had no other direct measures of autonomic dysfunction to ascer-
tain whether OH is the main driving force behind our findings. Blood pressure variability in
our study was measured following postural change and therefore reflects a distinct orthostatic
response, although it might in part occur as a manifestation of wider autonomic failure, unre-
lated to postural change. Accordingly, risk estimates for both OH and blood pressure variabil-
ity attenuated after incorporating both in the same model, but it remains unclear whether this
is because they are both computed from postural-change-related measurements or because
they reflect the same underlying autonomic dysfunction. Given the interaction we found
between OH and the lack of a compensatory increase in heart rate, the impact of OH may well
vary with the degree of overall autonomic failure, and future studies are encouraged to incorpo-
rate various measures of autonomic dysfunction collected in the same individuals simulta-
neously (for which reported risks and effect estimates may serve as a guidance). Although

 autonomic dysfunction may even reflect early signs of neurodegeneration,the long follow-up
duration of our study renders reverse causality less likely.
The risk of dementia associated with OH in our study was independent of whether partici-
pants reported feeling unwell along with the blood pressure drop, and the vast majority of
patients with OH did not have symptoms during testing. Although for blood pressure variabil-
ity we observedan exposure-response association, we did not find this for severity of OH itself.
As OH is also associated with mortality [9], this finding may be attributable to competing risk,
causing the most severely affected participants to die at a younger age, prior to developing
dementia. Alternatively, rather than the degree of blood pressure drop, the lack of compensa-
tory increase in heart rate may better reflect the severity of consequences of orthostatic drops
in blood pressure. Taken together, our findings suggest that formal assessment of OH is neces-
sary to have sufficient test sensitivity, and incorporation of heart rate response in the definition
of OH may contribute to evaluating aetiology and clinical severity. Hypotension might be
harmful even without accompanying clinical symptoms such as light-headedness. This lack of
symptoms with orthostasis was previously observedin patients with dementia [39] and may
warrant caution in view of studies linking low blood pressure in late life to cognitive decline
and dementia [40].
OH most commonly arises due to autonomic dysfunction in the absence of neurological
disease, but may be provoked by synucleinopathies (e.g., Parkinson disease), small fibre
peripheral neuropathy, volume depletion (e.g., due to diuretics), and diminished cardiac
pump function. In addition, several drugs can cause or aggravate OH, including antihyperten-
sive agents and antidepressants. Participants in our study with heart failure at baseline seemed
particularly affected by OH, possibly due to the lack of a compensatory increase in stroke vol-
ume. OH has been associated with the development of structural cardiac changes, including
left ventricular hypertrophy [41], which may function as a mediator towards dementia
[42,43]. However, the subgroup of participants with heart failure in our study was too small to
draw any firm conclusions. We found similar associations between OH and dementia after
excluding those with Parkinson disease, and in users versus non-users of antihypertensive
medication.
Although we believe our findings are valid, there are certain limitations to our study to take
into account. First, measures of OH were not available for all eligible participants. Although
this was largely due to logistic reasons, we cannot completely rule out selection bias. Second,
despite adjustment for many potentially confounding factors, residual confounding may still
occur. However, given the lack of attenuation of our results in our second, more fully adjusted
model, residual confounding is unlikely to result from the most relevant, included covariates.
Third, we continued blood pressure measurements for up to 3 min after postural change, and
while this approach is in line with international guidelines, it may have resulted in missed
orthostatic blood pressure drops beyond this time window [44]. However, any misclassifica-
tion (i.e., missed diagnosis of OH) would likely have led to underestimation of the true effect.
Fourth, subtypes of dementia were based on clinical diagnosis, and mixed pathology (e.g.,
Lewy bodies) in patients with clinical Alzheimer disease may contribute to the observed asso-
ciations. Fifth, we were unable to adjust for the fact that OH predisposes for falls, which may
contribute to cognitive decline due to traumatic brain injury. Finally, the majority of our
study population was of European descent, and findings may not be applicable to other
ethnicities.
In conclusion, OH is associated with an increased risk of dementia in the general popula-
tion. This finding supports an important role for maintaining continuous cerebral perfusion in
the prevention of dementia.
