Abstract
Each year millions of Americans present to the emergency department (ED) for care after a motor 
vehicle collision (MVC), the great majority (>90%) are discharged to home after evaluation. Acute 
musculoskeletal pain is the norm in this population, and such patients are typically discharged to 
home with prescriptions for oral opioid analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). The influence of acute pain management on subsequent pain outcomes in this common 
ED population is unknown. We evaluated the effect of opioid analgesics versus NSAIDs initiated 
from the ED on the presence of moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain and ongoing opioid use at 
6 weeks in a large cohort of adult ED patients presenting to the ED after MVC (n=948). The effect 
of opioids versus NSAIDs was evaluated using an innovative quasi-experimental design method 
using propensity scores to account for covariate imbalances between the two treatment groups. No 
difference in risk for moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain at six weeks was observed between

 those discharged with opioid analgesics versus NSAIDS (Risk Difference = 7.2% (95% CI:

1. Introduction
Each year almost 4 million people are evaluated in US emergency departments (EDs) after 
experiencing a motor vehicle collision (MVC).[27] Greater than 90% of these individuals 
are discharged to home after ED evaluation.[11; 30] Acute musculoskeletal pain (most 
commonly in the neck or back) is the norm among those discharged from the ED,[3] and 
while the majority recover within the first few weeks, up to 40% transition to persistent post-
traumatic musculoskeletal pain.[26] Persistent pain after MVC is a common and costly 
public health problem in industrialized countries.[5] Despite this, there is limited 
information about the influence of initial ED care, specifically analgesic medications, on 
persistent pain outcomes.
At the time of ED discharge, providers generally prescribe an opioid analgesic and/or a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[16] Available data support the potential 
advantages of both options. Opioid analgesics may provide more potent acute analgesia than 
NSAIDs and may more effectively dampen peripheral and central nervous system 
neuroplastic changes mediating persistent pain and other adverse posttraumatic outcomes.
[15; 19; 25; 36; 45] However, after an initial period of analgesia, opioids are also known to 
cause hyperalgesia.[20; 22; 24; 42] Consistent with these data, genetic epidemiologic studies 
suggest that endogenous opioids at the time of traumatic stressors such as MVC worsen pain 
outcomes.[1; 23] In addition, an early prescription for an opioid might also increase the risk 
of chronic opioid use[43] and chronic opioid use has been associated with dependence and 
abuse.[28] NSAIDs appear to have a lower risk of promoting hyperalgesia, but also have less 
acute pain efficacy and have not been shown to have any beneficial effects on longer term 
pain outcomes.[6] Finally, some individuals may respond better to opioid analgesics or 
NSAIDs, and this phenomenon may be dependent on factors such as age, medication history, 
and sex.[23]
Understanding the risks and benefits of analgesics prescribed for common ED conditions 
such as acute post-MVC pain is important to optimize pain reduction and improve trauma 
recovery. In this study, we applied innovative analytic methods to data from a large 
prospective cohort study of MVC patients to assess the effect of opioid versus NSAID 
prescription at the time of ED discharge on persistent pain outcomes. Our primary aim was 
to evaluate the average and individual-level effect of opioid versus NSAID analgesics on

 persistent moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain 6 weeks after an MVC. A secondary aim 
was to examine whether receipt of an opioid versus an NSAID was associated with ongoing 
prescription opioid use at 6 weeks. In addition, because of the potential effect of factors such 
age, prior opioid medication use, and sex on the effect of these analgesics, we explored 
whether the treatment effect of opioids versus NSAIDs was associated with these factors.
2. Methods
2.1 Study Design and Setting
This investigation was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a large, multi-center, 
prospective cohort study of adult patients who presented to an ED within 24 hours of an 
MVC and were discharged to home after evaluation. The primary aim of the parent study 
was to assess the association between epidemiologic and genetic characteristics and pain 
outcomes after an MVC. Data were collected at the ED visit via patient interview and self-
report survey and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after the ED visit via internet-based self-
report survey or telephone interview. Participants were enrolled at eight EDs in four states 
(Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York) between February 2009 and October 
2011. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each of the study 
sites and all participants provided written informed consent. Further details of study 
methodology are described elsewhere.[26; 29]
2.2 Study Population
Patients aged 18 to 65 years old who presented to a participating ED within 24 hours of an 
MVC and were unlikely to require hospitalization were screened for study eligibility. 
Patients who were admitted to the hospital, had any fractures other than phalangeal 
fractures, had more than 4 lacerations requiring sutures or a single laceration more than 20 
cm in length, or had intracranial or spinal injuries were excluded. Spinal injury was defined 
by the presence of a fracture, dislocation, or new neurologic deficit. Patients who were not 
alert and oriented also were excluded, as were pregnant patients, custodial prisoners, and 
patients unable to read and understand English. Enrollment was limited to non-Hispanic 
white subjects of European-American descent because the aims of the parent study included 
genetic analyses and studies involving genetic analyses can be biased by population 
stratification in a more diverse sample.[4]
2.3 Measures
2.3.1 Exposure Assessment—ED discharge medications were extracted from the 
electronic medical record (EMRs) of each study participant. Participants were categorized as 
having received an opioid analgesic at discharge if they received an opioid agonist 
medication prescription, such as hydrocodone or oxycodone. Participants who received a 
combination medication containing both an opioid and acetaminophen were also classified 
as having received an opioid. Participants were categorized as having received an NSAID if 
they received a non-specific cyclo-oxygenase enzyme inhibitor, such as ibuprofen or 
naproxen, but not aspirin. Participants who received both an NSAID and an opioid were 
excluded from the analyses.

 2.3.2 Outcomes Assessment—The primary outcome was the presence of persistent 
self-reported moderate to severe pain 6 weeks after MVC. The six week time point was 
selected because it was the most proximate follow-up point to medication prescription, and 
because evidence suggests that chronic pain trajectories after MVC are generally established 
within 6-8 weeks after MVC.[17; 37; 39] Overall pain severity was assessed by asking 
individuals to rate their average overall pain intensity during the preceding week on a 0-10 
numeric rating scale. Moderate to severe pain (>4 on this 0-10 numeric rating scale[21]) was 
chosen as the primary outcome because of its clinical relevance; its presence has been shown 
to be correlated with other patient-centered outcome measures, such as pain interference 
with function.[35] A secondary outcome of interest was the ongoing use of pain medication 
at week 6, because ongoing analgesic use is likely an important surrogate outcome in the 
measurement of pain[9] and because persistent opioid administration may increase the risk 
for problematic opioid use.
2.4 Statistical Analysis
2.4.1 Overview of Analyses—In a randomized controlled trial, the probability of 
receiving a given treatment is usually 50%. In an observational study like this, the 
probability that a physician will prescribe an opioid or an NSAID varies between patients, is 
dependent on many factors, and is likely confounded with the outcomes. To adjust for this 
confounding, we used multiple imputation propensity score methods with flexible 
parametric cubic splines along the propensity score (probability that a patient received an 
opioid). Using these methods, we estimated both average (group) effects and individual 
effect of opioid versus NSAIDs prescription on the likelihood of having moderate to severe 
musculoskeletal pain 6 weeks after an MVC.[12] In addition, we used innovative analytic 
techniques to estimate outcomes for individuals and groups had they received the other 
treatment option (opioid instead of NSAID, or vice versa).[7] By comparing these observed 
and estimated counterfactual (unobserved) outcomes, we determined both the overall 
average differential treatment effect of opioids versus NSAIDs and differential treatment 
effects according to individual characteristics.
As suggested by Rubin, we performed the statistical analysis in two stages.[32-34] The first 
stage comprised missing data imputation, propensity score estimation, and declaration of the 
procedures used for data analysis. All of these components were implemented without 
viewing the outcome data. The second stage involved imputation of missing counterfactual 
outcomes and estimation of treatment effects. All statistical analyses were conducted using 
Stata MP 13.1 (StataCorp, 2013. College Station, Texas) and R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).
2.4.2 Multiple Imputation of Missing Covariate Data—Multiple imputation of 
missing data was performed using chained equations; this method specifies the conditional 
models for all of the variables with missing values.[40; 44] To maintain objectivity of the 
analysis, covariates were imputed using only treatment indicators (opioid or NSAID) and 
other covariates. Imputation was performed using logistic regression for binary variables, 
ordinal logistic regression for ordinal variables, linear regression for continuous variables 
and predictive mean matching for semi-continuous variables. Twenty (m=20) complete

 imputed datasets were generated and used for calculation of the propensity score and further 
analyses.
2.4.3 Propensity Score Modeling—The conditional probability of receiving an opioid 
instead of an NSAID, given the observed covariates, was estimated using logistic regression 
in a stepwise iterative fashion.[18] In brief, initial covariate selection for the propensity 
score model was based on substantive knowledge about factors that might influence provider 
analgesic choice.[14; 38] Next, other covariates, as well as quadratic and interaction terms 
were selected based on likelihood ratio testing. The final propensity score model included 48 
variables comprising socio-demographic data, baseline pain levels and body regions with 
pain, MVC characteristics, standardized assessments,[29] medical history (including 
previous opioid use), and study site. Individuals with propensity scores outside the region of 
common support (overlapping propensity scores between groups) were truncated. This 
truncation essentially excluded people whose probability of receiving a particular treatment 
approached 100%. A clinical analogy to this might be a patient who had a recent 
gastrointestinal bleed on NSAIDs, as this person will almost always be prescribed an opioid 
given the choice between an NSAID and an opioid. Since this was a comparative 
effectiveness study, we were interested in comparing participants who had some chance of 
receiving either treatment. Socio-demographic characteristics were compared between those 
included and excluded (truncated) from analyses.
The remaining patients who were not truncated were classified into six strata based on 
quantiles of the propensity scores. We then assessed whether covariates were balanced 
between the NSAID and opioid groups within and across strata. Student's t-test for 
continuous variables and z-test for binary variables were used to assess differences within 
strata and balance of covariates across strata was assessed by testing the null hypothesis that 
block-adjusted average difference in average covariate values is equal to zero for each 
covariate. Imbalance of covariates was addressed by re-specification of the initial propensity 
score model and then repeating the procedures above until the distribution of covariates was 
similar between the opioid and NSAID groups.
2.4.4 Imputation of Missing Potential Outcomes—Because loss to follow-up 
occurred after the ED visit, it could not be adjusted for in our propensity score analysis.[31] 
However, loss to follow-up is an important factor when determining unobserved 
counterfactual outcomes. We therefore imputed loss to follow-up using a logistic regression 
model that included a cubic spline the propensity score, covariates, and an indicator value 
for opioids versus NSAIDS, and only imputed counterfactual primary outcome (presence or 
absence of moderate to severe pain at 6 weeks) and secondary outcome (ongoing pain 
medication use) within the strata of patients who were estimated to have followed up 
regardless of whether they received an opioid or an NSAID. The first model involved the 
presence of pain as a function of a cubic spline along with the propensity score and 
covariates. The second model involved the ongoing use of pain medication as a function of 
spline along the propensity score, covariates, and the presence of moderate to severe pain at 
6 weeks. (The use of two separate models enabled us to account for possible associations 
between the primary and secondary outcomes.)

 Each of the outcome imputations were performed (l=40) within each of the m=20 imputed 
datasets. All of the point estimates and standard errors were combined using the 
combination rules for two-stage imputation [13] and confidence intervals were obtained 
using the t-distribution. We examined the average difference between the observed and 
counterfactual outcomes between individuals to estimate the average treatment effect (risk 
difference) of opioids versus NSAIDs on the presence of moderate to severe pain at 6 weeks, 
as well as the ongoing use of pain medications. We further estimated the average risk 
difference in moderate to severe pain at week 6 among men and women in order to examine 
possible effect modification by sex. Lastly, we determined heterogeneity of treatment effect 
by reporting the proportion of participants who would have responded to: 1) opioids only, 2) 
NSAIDs only, 3) both treatments or 4) neither treatment. We further describe the age, 
gender, and history of opioid use prior to the MVC among these four possible types of 
treatment response.
3. Results
Figure 1 displays the flow of study participants from enrollment to inclusion in the final 
analyses. Slightly more than 60% of enrolled study participants were female, more than 
three-quarters had received formal education past high school, and more than half worked 
full time [26]. The median age of all study participants was 36 years (range 18 to 65). The 
vast majority (∼94%) had musculoskeletal strains only related to their MVC, the remainder 
also had minor associated injuries such as small lacerations or phalange fractures. The socio-
demographic characteristics of participants who received either an opioid analgesic or an 
NSAID, before and after propensity score matching, are displayed in Table 1. Only 
educational status was significantly different between the opioid analgesic and NSAID 
groups in the unmatched sample (χ2=19.38, df=5, p<0.002).
Of the 948 enrolled in the initial cohort study, 6 week follow-up data were obtained in 91% 
of participants. Participants who were lost to follow-up in the initial cohort tended to be 
male, younger, and of lower socio-economic status.[26] Of the 859 cohort participants with 
complete follow-up data, 25% were discharged with an opioid analgesic (with or without 
acetaminophen) and 30% were discharged with an NSAID alone. Among those prescribed 
an opioid analgesic at ED discharge (n=213), 84% received hydrocodone and the rest 
received oxycodone. Among those participants prescribed only an NSAID (n=260), 90% 
received ibuprofen. The most frequently prescribed dose of hydrocodone and oxycodone 
was 5mg (range 5 – 10mg); the most frequently prescribed dose of ibuprofen was 800mg 
(range 400 – 800mg). Participants in both medication groups received a median duration of 
3 days of analgesic medications. The median pain score among participants who received 
opioid was 7 (IQR 5 – 8); among those who received an NSAID, the median pain score was 
5 (IQR 4 – 7).
In unadjusted analyses, 49% of all participants receiving NSAIDS and 56% of all 
participants receiving opioids reported moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain at 6 weeks 
post ED MVC visit. After propensity score methods were applied, there was no difference in 
risk of persistent moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain when participants were discharged 
from the ED with an opioid analgesic compared to an NSAID (Risk Difference = 7.2% (95%

 CI: -5.2, 19.5%). When stratified by sex, there was no statistically significant difference in 
the risk for persistent pain in women (Risk Difference = 11.1% (95% CI: -3.5 – 25.5%) or 
men (Risk Difference = 2.2% (95% CI: -14.4 – 18.8%). However, participants prescribed 
opioid analgesics were more likely than those who received NSAIDs to report using 
prescription opioids at the 6-week follow-up (Risk Difference = 17.5% (95% CI: 5.8, 
29.3%).
As described in the above methods section, we used innovative analytic techniques[7] to 
predict treatment success (no moderate or severe pain six weeks after MVC) for each 
individual for each treatment. Using the results of these analyses, we classified individuals 
into one of four predicted treatment success categories i.e. treatment success with: 1) opioids 
alone, 2) NSAIDs alone, 3) either treatment, or 4) neither treatment (Table 2). Treatment 
effects according to participant characteristics are displayed in Table 2. No treatment 
response was predicted in ∼3/10 individuals, with responses to either treatment or NSAIDs 
alone predicted in ∼1/4 individuals, and response to opioids alone predicted in 1/5 
individuals. There was no significant difference in age, sex or prior opioid use across the 4 
different types of treatment response.
4. Discussion
The results from this investigation suggest that the initial ED prescription for an NSAID 
versus opioid medication at ED discharge following an MVC-related visit does not influence 
the development of persistent moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain six weeks after 
MVC. Although patients in our study who were discharged with NSAIDS, on average 
seemed to be experiencing less pain than those released with opioids (RD= -7.2%), this 
result was not significant.
In addition, participants prescribed opioid analgesics were nearly 20% more likely to report 
prescription opioid medication use at 6-week follow-up. It is possible that individuals who 
were experiencing greater levels of pain continued to take opioids, or this observation may 
also reflect the properties of opioid medications to induce dependence, tolerance, or 
hyperalgesia. While the reason for the finding is unknown, it is worth further examination 
given the recent stance by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to limit opioid prescribing 
for chronic pain.[8]
Study results also suggest that there is individual variability in treatment response. 
Approximately 1 in 5 individuals would not have persistent moderate or severe pain six 
weeks after MVC if they were prescribed an opioid, but they would if they had moderate to 
severe pain had they been prescribed an NSAID. Conversely, 1 in 4 patients would have only 
experienced such treatment success with an NSAID. These results add to growing data that 
opioids are effective in some individuals, but in others opioids may increase the risk of 
persistent pain development and/or persistent opioid use.
These data further underscore the importance of individualized medicine – determining 
which treatment is right for which individual and under what conditions. In this context, it is 
important to note that this study did not address other adverse effects of opioids (ex. nausea, 
Beaudoin et al.

 constipation, overdose) or NSAIDs (ex. hypertension, dyspepsia, or gastrointestinal bleed), 
only continued opioid use. Future work should focus on the utility of a clinical decision tool 
to aid prescribing based on the likelihood of both treatment response, as well as unwanted 
sequelae (continued opioid use, adverse effects). Such a tool could optimize pain outcomes 
and reduce unnecessary medication use. Based on this study, one can infer that 
approximately 19% of people will only improve with an opioid (when given the choice 
between an opioid and an NSAID), but 25% of the study cohort received an opioid. If only 
the people who were going to get better on an opioid, actually received an opioid, opioid 
prescribing would be reduced based on this estimate. Moreover, if patients receive the 
treatment that they will respond to best (whether it be an opioid or an NSAID), the 
proportion of participants experiencing improvements in pain would be increased. Notably, 
there are some individuals will not respond to either an opioid or an NSAID. This 
emphasizes the importance of finding alternatives to our usual arsenal of pain medications.
In these preliminary analyses, we did not detect any significant differences in age, gender or 
history of opioid use to explain the variation in individual treatment response. This suggests 
that other mechanisms, clinical factors or even genetics, might determine whether an 
individual responds to treatment. It is worthwhile to note that the point estimate for the 
increased risk of persistent pain among women prescribed an opioid was 11% (vs. only 2% 
for men). This could represent a clinically meaningful difference and a larger study 
primarily aimed to examine gender difference might demonstrate statistical significance. 
Women have been shown to be at greater risk for chronic pain and chronic widespread pain 
development compared to men for some painful conditions.[41] Subsequent research should 
explore whether sex differences in chronic pain risk are mediated by opioid use.
4.1 Limitations
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the study results. As with any 
observational study where the assignment to treatment is not randomized, the possibility of 
unmeasured confounding exists and could bias the study results. In addition, this 
investigation was an analysis of observational data, participants were aware of their 
“treatment assignment” and their expectations of pain and pain relief could also impact their 
reported pain scores. However, it is unlikely that expectations based on recollection of 
medication prescription at the time of ED discharge affected pain reporting at six weeks.
In addition, the study findings are only generalizable to the population of patients included 
in the analysis. In particular, the analysis only included participants who received an opioid 
or an NSAID at discharge – participants who received nothing or something other than these 
analgesics could have been systematically different than those included in the study. 
However, we did not identify any differences in sociodemographic characteristics (as listed 
in Table 1) between those included and not included in the analyses. In addition, the 
prospective cohort study from which these data were drawn included only white participants 
of self-reported European ancestry. It is possible that a more diverse or different racial and 
ethnic group could yield different findings.
This study only addressed the comparative effectiveness of opioid analgesics versus 
NSAIDs; we did not make a comparison to no analgesics or other types of analgesics. 
Beaudoin et al.

 Comparative effectiveness assessments of two treatments is also intended to reflect clinical 
practice, and most ED patients are either prescribed or recommended to use some type of 
analgesic medication after presenting to the ED after an MVC.[2] As such, a comparison to 
no analgesics is likely not feasible, and in a randomized controlled trial it might be 
considered unethical to discharge people without analgesics. We also did not assess whether 
or not the combination of opioid analgesics and NSAIDs was superior to either type of 
medication alone. However, a recent randomized controlled trial among acute low back 
patients demonstrated no difference in pain and functional outcomes when oxycodone was 
added to the NSAID naproxen.[10] In addition, data were not available to examine adverse 
effects other than persistent pain and/or continued opioid use in this analysis, and this could 
possibly influence analgesic treatment choice. Lastly, our investigation was an intention-to-
treat analysis based on prescription provided at discharge. As such, it reflects only the initial 
treatment choice by the provider and does not reflect adherence or efficacy and is also 
subject to confounding after the point of treatment assignment, as in an RCT. In addition, we 
did not examine the impact of different prescription regimens (strength, frequency, or “as 
needed” dosing) as there was not sufficient heterogeneity to examine these factors.
4.2 Conclusion
Based upon the results of this investigation, opioid analgesics prescribed to post-MVC ED 
patients use was not associated with greater improvements in pain outcomes than NSAIDS 
at 6 weeks after the ED visit. Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to support 
recommending an opioid analgesic over an NSAID for all post-MVC ED patients. Of 
concern, individuals prescribed an opioid analgesic were more likely to report ongoing use 
of this medication at 6 weeks. There is likely variation in individual response to treatment 
and this phenomenon should be further explored in randomized controlled trials. Additional 
research is needed to determine the optimal intervention to prevent persistent or chronic pain 
following an MVC.
