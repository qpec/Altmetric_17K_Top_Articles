Background. Infections such as group B Streptococcus (GBS) are an important cause of maternal sepsis, yet limited data on epi-
demiology exist. This article, the third of 11, estimates the incidence of maternal GBS disease worldwide.
Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health 
Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpub-
lished data on invasive GBS disease in women pregnant or within 42 days postpartum. We undertook meta-analyses to derive pooled 
estimates of the incidence of maternal GBS disease. We examined maternal and perinatal outcomes and GBS serotypes.
Results. Fifteen studies and 1 unpublished dataset were identified, all from United Nations–defined developed regions. From 
a single study with pregnancies as the denominator, the incidence of maternal GBS disease was 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
.28–.48) per 1000 pregnancies. From 3 studies reporting cases by the number of maternities (pregnancies resulting in live/still birth), 
the incidence was 0.23 (95% CI, .09–.37). Five studies reported serotypes, with Ia being the most common (31%). Most maternal 
GBS disease was detected at or after delivery.
Conclusions. Incidence data on maternal GBS disease in developing regions are lacking. In developed regions the incidence is 
low, as are the sequelae for the mother, but the risk to the fetus and newborn is substantial. The timing of GBS disease suggests that a 
maternal vaccine given in the late second or early third trimester of pregnancy would prevent most maternal cases.

Maternal sepsis is an important and potentially preventable 
cause of global maternal mortality. Although data are limited, 
particularly from countries with the highest maternal mortality 
ratios, maternal sepsis was estimated to cause around 11% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 6%–19%, n = 261 000) of maternal 
deaths worldwide between 2003 and 2009 [1]. It is especially 
prevalent in South Asia where it accounts for 14% of all mater-
nal deaths (95% CI, 3%–36%) and sub-Saharan Africa (10% 
[95% CI, 5.5%–18.5]) [1]. In comparison, the proportion of 
maternal deaths due to sepsis in developed countries was esti-
mated at 4.7% (95% CI, 2.4%–11.1%) [1].
In northwestern Europe, >40% of all maternal deaths were 
caused by puerperal sepsis in the early 1900s [2]. Serial data from 
England and Wales, one of the few areas to have extensive histori-
cal data on maternal mortality, show that puerperal sepsis caused 
55% of deaths in the 1870s but only 4.6% by the 1980s [3]. This 
decline is attributed primarily to knowledge of hygienic child-
birth practice and antibiotics. However, sepsis has reemerged as a 
leading cause of maternal death in the United Kingdom, account-
ing for nearly 25% of deaths in 2009–2012 [4] and is now the 
second most common cause of death [5]. This may be due to a 
number of factors, including (1) changes in maternal risk factors 
for sepsis, such as age at first pregnancy, the prevalence of comor-
bidities including obesity and diabetes, the ethnic makeup of a 
population, and levels of multiple births; (2) alterations in the

virulence of circulating organisms; and/or (3) variation in iatro-
genic factors such as the use of repeated invasive diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures. A corresponding increase in the inci-
dence and severity of sepsis in the general population has been 
noted in Europe and in the United States [6–8].
In keeping with the general decline in maternal deaths due to 
sepsis in developed countries over the last 150 years, the inci-
dence of maternal sepsis has fallen from 0.8% in the 1970s [9, 
10] to 0.1%–0.3% [11–14] in the 2000s. However, up to 10% of 
all pregnant women are reported to experience febrile morbid-
ity [15], representing a significant burden of ill health. Beyond 
maternal mortality, maternal infection can have short and long-
term effects not only on maternal health but also on the outcome 
of the pregnancy (eg, preterm labor, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis) 
and the longer-term health and development of the child [16–19].
Despite the burden of maternal, perinatal, and neonatal mor-
tality and morbidity associated with maternal sepsis, data on the 
etiology, particularly in low- and middle-income contexts, are 
limited [20]. Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalac-
tiae), part of the normal flora in the intestine, vagina, and rec-
tum, is likely an important pathogen in maternal sepsis because 
around 1 in 5 pregnant women are colonized worldwide [21], 
and in pregnancy there is increased risk of invasive GBS disease 
[11, 22–25]. Indeed, GBS is frequently identified as a pathogen 
in maternal sepsis [9, 10, 14, 19, 26]; GBS accounted for 25% of 
clinically significant bacteremia in hospitalized pregnant women 
in Ireland [27] and 20% of hospitalized women with puerperal 
bacteremia in the United States [19]. Few publications, how-
ever, have specifically estimated the incidence of maternal GBS 
disease.
This article, assessing the incidence of invasive maternal 
GBS disease worldwide (Figure 1), is part of a supplement esti-
mating the burden of GBS disease in pregnant and postpartum 
women, stillbirths, and infants, which is important in terms of 
public health policy and particularly vaccine development [28]. 
The supplement includes systematic reviews and meta-analy-
ses on GBS colonization and adverse outcomes associated with 
GBS around birth [21, 29–35], which form input parameters to 
a compartmental model [36]. These are reported individually 
and according to international guidelines [37, 38].
The specific objectives of this article are:
1. To provide a comprehensive and systematic literature review 
and meta-analyses to assess the incidence of maternal GBS 
disease per 1000 pregnancies, the associated maternal, peri-
natal, and neonatal outcomes and the serotype distribution of 
maternal GBS disease;
2. To use the data input available for estimating the burden of 
GBS in pregnancy and postpartum for women, stillbirth, and 
infants; and

METHODS
This article is part of a wider study protocol entitled “Systematic 
estimates of the burden of GBS worldwide in pregnant and 
postpartum women, stillbirths and infants.” It was submit-
ted for ethical approval to the London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine (reference number 11966) and approved on 
30 November 2016.
Definitions
Maternal GBS disease was defined as laboratory isolation of 
GBS from a sterile site (blood or cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] 
only) in a pregnant or postpartum woman (up to 42 days post-
partum), with a minimum of fever and physician suspicion of 
sepsis. Nonsystemic infections, such as chorioamnionitis, pye-
lonephritis, or soft tissue infections, were excluded.
Search Strategy
We identified data for this supplement through systematic review 
of the published literature and through development of an inves-
tigator group asking clinicians, researchers, and relevant profes-
sional institutions worldwide. For this article, systematic searches 
of Medline, Embase, the World Health Organization Library 
Information System (WHOLIS), Literature in the Health Sciences 
in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS), and Scopus were 
completed in November 2016, and updated to include all stud-
ies published to the end of January 2017. Search terms related to 
“pregnancy,” “maternal,” “peripartum,” “GBS,” and “sepsis” were 
used and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms were used 
where possible (see Supplementary Table 1 for the full search 
terms). Each article was reviewed and had data extracted by at 
least 2 reviewers. Where there was discrepancy between 2 review-
ers, a third was consulted. The reference lists of relevant articles 
were hand-searched to identify additional studies.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Any observational studies reporting the incidence of invasive 
GBS disease in pregnant women or women up to 42 days post-
partum were eligible for inclusion. Reviews, case reports or 
series, and commentaries were excluded. No date or language 
restrictions were applied; texts were translated to English when 
published in other languages.
Data Abstraction and Meta-analyses
Data from each study were extracted into standard Excel forms 
and imported to Stata 13 software (StataCorp) for meta-analy-
ses. Where available, data were extracted and used to describe 
the maternal, perinatal, and neonatal outcomes for women with 
maternal GBS disease. Information on the serotype of GBS was 
extracted where reported.
We used random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the inci-
dence of maternal GBS disease using the DerSimonian and 
Laird method [39]. The same approach was used to estimate 
the timing of disease in relation to the course of pregnancy 
(antepartum, peripartum, or postpartum), case fatality risks 
for maternal and neonatal mortality in maternal GBS disease, 
the incidence of early-onset GBS disease (EOGBS) in neonates 
born to women with maternal GBS disease, and the prevalence 
of GBS serotypes causing maternal GBS disease.
RESULTS
The database searches returned a total of 3580 hits combined; an 
additional 14 articles were identified through hand-searching 
the references, and 1 unpublished dataset was included. After 
duplicates were removed, 1488 papers remained. Following 
review of the title and abstract, the full text of 56 articles was 
reviewed. From these, 15 were retained, although only 4 were 
included in the meta-analysis of the incidence of invasive mater-
nal GBS disease. In addition, one unpublished dataset from the 
United Kingdom [40] was included, for a total of 16 studies, 5 of 
which were included in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 2.
Characteristics of Included Studies
Thirteen studies from the systematic review met our inclusion cri-
teria; an additional 2 provided relevant information on maternal 
GBS disease but no incidence estimate, plus one unpublished data-
set from the United Kingdom [40] for a total of 16 studies, which 
are summarized in Table 1 [12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 25–27, 40–47]. The 
study periods ranged from 1981 to 2016; only 4 were published 
pre-2000 [19, 41, 44, 46]. All studies were hospital-based with 
many studies using the methodology of an audit of blood cul-
tures from obstetric patients linked with a review of their medical 
records, some prospectively and some retrospectively. Different 
population denominators were used to estimate incidence: preg-
nancies, maternities (defined as women delivering either live or 
stillbirths), live births, total births, or per 1000 woman-years, and 
several studies only reported risks without providing the data that 
went into the estimate. We intended to estimate incidence rates 
per 1000 pregnancies; however only 1 study reported these data 
[26]. Four more used maternities as the denominator [12, 14, 40, 
42], which we used for the meta-analysis. The number of materni-
ties will be lower than the number of pregnancies, as pregnancies 
include miscarriages and induced abortions. The studies included 
in the meta-analysis of the incidence of maternal GBS disease were 
all published since 2013 (and included 1 set of unpublished data) 
and were conducted in the United States [12], France [14], Ireland 
[26], and the United Kingdom [40, 42] (Figure 3). Four were con-
ducted retrospectively and 1 prospectively, and they were all large 
studies covering tens or hundreds of thousands of women.
All 16 studies were used to provide data on other aspects 
and outcomes of maternal GBS disease. Five studies reported

information on the timing of the disease with relation to the 
antenatal, delivery, or postnatal period [14, 26, 43, 44, 46]. 
Eleven articles reported the absolute number of maternal deaths 
[14, 22, 23, 25, 26, 40–44, 47], 6 articles reported some data on 
maternal morbidity. Nine articles provided data on perinatal 
outcomes from pregnant women with GBS disease [19, 23, 26, 
40–42, 44, 46, 47]. Seven articles reported on neonatal mortality 
associated with maternal GBS disease [19, 23, 25, 41, 42, 44, 46], 
and 6 reported on cases of EOGBS disease in neonates born to 
pregnant women with GBS disease [19, 23, 41, 42, 44, 47]. Two 
articles reported on colonization [14, 44]. Serological typing of 
GBS bacterial isolates was undertaken in 5 studies [22, 23, 25, 
44, 47].
Incidence
From the single study using pregnancies as the denominator 
(n = 150 043), the incidence of invasive maternal GBS disease 
was 0.38 (95% CI, .28–.48) per 1000 pregnancies, as shown in 
Figure 4. From the 4 studies reporting cases of invasive mater-
nal GBS disease by the number of maternities (n = 1 576 138), 
the incidence was 0.17 (95% CI, –.01 to .35), also shown in 
Figure 4.
Most studies included cases of sepsis on the basis of clin-
ical suspicion and positive sterile-site cultures. One study 
[42] only reported cases of severe maternal sepsis, defined as 
death related to infection; severe sepsis requiring admission 
to a high dependency or intensive care unit; or clinical sus-
picion of sepsis with ≥2 of the symptoms of systemic inflam-
matory response syndrome (see Supplementary Table 2). By 
focusing on the most severe cases, this study reported a sig-
nificantly lower incidence of maternal GBS disease (7 cases 
in 799 003 maternities, incidence 0.01/1000 maternities). 
A meta-analysis stratified by case definition calculated the 
incidence of invasive maternal GBS disease from the remain-
ing 3 studies as 0.23 (95% CI, .09–.37) per 1000 maternities 
(Figure 5).

 GBS Maternal Disease and Serotype Distribution • CID 2017:65 (Suppl 2) • S119
The studies that reported incidences but could not be included 
in the meta-analysis are shown in Supplementary Table 3. The 
incidence appears to have fallen in the United States, from the 
highest estimate of 2.3 per 1000 deliveries in the late 1970s [44] 
to 0.12 per 1000 live births in the early 2000s [22]. It should 
be noted that not all of these studies applied the same defini-
tion of a sterile site (for example, some included amniotic fluid, 
others did not), nor do they use the same denominator and are 
therefore not strictly comparable either to each other or to the 
findings of the meta-analysis.
Timing
The timing of the detection of maternal GBS disease in relation 
to the course of pregnancy was available for 122 cases from 5 
studies [14, 26, 43, 44, 46]. Pooled estimates for the timing of 
detection show that most cases (66.7% [n = 83]) were detected 
during labor/delivery (95% CI, 46.6%–86.8%) or postpartum 
(32.5% [95% CI, 12.1%–52.9%]; n = 37) (see Supplementary 
Figures 1–3).
Maternal Outcomes
The overall case fatality risk for pregnant or postpartum women 
experiencing invasive GBS disease was 0.20% (95% CI, –.40 to 
.80; 11 studies, 2 deaths, 890 cases) (Supplementary Figure 4). 
One death occurred in 211 cases (case fatality risk, 0.47% [95% 
CI, .01–2.61]) [45] and a second, coincidentally, among another 
211 cases [22]. The limited data on maternal morbidity are 
shown in Supplementary Table 4.

Perinatal Outcomes
From 9 studies where pregnancy outcome was reported [19, 
23, 26, 40–42, 44, 46, 47], there were 323 live births, 21 mis-
carriages, and 14 stillbirths in 357 women with maternal GBS 
disease. There is some variation in the definition of stillbirth 
worldwide; not all papers reported their definition, but those 
that did used 20 or 24 weeks as is common in developed set-
tings. Pooled estimates for pregnancy outcomes were as follows: 
live births, 93% (95% CI, 88%–98%); miscarriages, 4% (95% CI, 
1%–7%); and stillbirths, 3% (95% CI, 1%–5%) (Supplementary 
Figures 5–7).
Neonatal Mortality and Morbidity in Babies Born to Women 
With Maternal Group B Streptococcus Disease
In the 7 studies reporting neonatal mortality, there were 4 
neonatal deaths in 160 live births. The pooled estimate for 
the case fatality risk (all cause) for newborns born to women 
with maternal GBS disease was 2.2% (95% CI, –1.1% to 5.6%) 
(Supplementary Figure 8). Of the 4 deaths, no information was 
given on cause of death for 3; the fourth was a death of a neo-
nate with EOGBS.
In the 6 studies reporting EOGBS, there were 24 cases among 
213 live births to women with maternal GBS disease. The 
pooled incidence estimate for EOGBS was 6.09 (95% CI, .69–
11.5) per 1000 live births in women with maternal GBS disease 
(Supplementary Figure 9). In a case-control study, the infants of 
mothers with maternal GBS disease had increased odds of either 
being born prematurely (odds ratio [OR], 6.00 [95% CI, 2.45–
14.7] before 37 weeks’ gestation and 13.4 [95% CI, 3.11–57.3] 
before 32 weeks) or developing sepsis (causative organisms not 
specified) themselves (OR, 32.7 [95% CI, 8.99–119.0]) [42].
Colonization
Thirteen neonates who were born to women with maternal GBS 
disease were colonized among 29 who were tested (44.8%). No 
information was given on serotypes.
Serotypes
Three hundred ten cases were serotyped. The distribution of 
capsular serotypes causing maternal GBS disease is shown in 
Figure 6. Serotype Ia was the most common (31%), followed by 
III (27%), V (19%), Ib (14%), and II (5%).

 GBS Maternal Disease and Serotype Distribution • CID 2017:65 (Suppl 2) • S121
DISCUSSION
Our review is the first assessing invasive maternal GBS disease, 
and we found an incidence of 0.38 (95% CI, .28–.48) per 1000 
pregnancies (1 study; 150 043 pregnancies) and 0.23 (95% CI, 
.09–.37) per 1000 maternities in high-income contexts, exclud-
ing the study focused solely on severe sepsis. This maternal inci-
dence is lower than the incidence of neonatal GBS disease (0.42 
[95% CI, .30–.54]) in developed countries (see Madrid et al in 
this supplement [33]), but it is likely to be an underestimate due 
to underreporting and/or low case ascertainment.
While the risk of mortality and morbidity for women with 
maternal GBS disease appears low in the developed region (case 
fatality risk, 0.19% [95% CI, –0.25% to 0.62%]), the same can-
not be said for the fetus or neonate. Where pregnancy outcomes 
were known, around 7% of pregnancies ended in miscarriage 
(4% [95% CI, 1%–7%]) or stillbirth (3% [95% CI, 1%–5%]), 
and 2.22% (95% CI, –1.11% to 5.55%) of the babies born alive 
died in the first month of life. These may be underestimates, 
as some studies did not include the antenatal period (therefore 
omitting miscarriages and a high proportion of stillbirths) and 
not all studies followed women up long enough to fully assess 
pregnancy outcomes. There is a significantly increased risk of 
EOGBS (6.09 cases [95% CI, .69–11.5] per 1000 live births in 
women with maternal GBS disease) compared to the back-
ground incidence of EOGBS (0.42/1000 live births) [33], and 
increased odds of preterm birth or sepsis in general [42]. In one 
study, maternal GBS disease was associated with pregnancy loss 
or EOGBS in 28% of cases [47]. The risk to the fetus and new-
born is likely to be higher in low- and middle-income contexts.
The small number of articles and limited geographies cov-
ered, particularly those with pregnancies as a denominator, 
limit the analysis. However, all data in the studies included in 
the meta-analysis of the incidence of maternal GBS disease were 
collected after the year 2000, when the data may be more likely 
to be comparable. Despite this, there was significant heteroge-
neity between studies (I2 = 88.9%). Other important factors for 
both study heterogeneity and case ascertainment are the case 
definition employed, the demographic profile of the women 
included in the study, variations in sampling strategy for the 
collection of blood cultures in febrile pregnant women and 
in other clinical practices such as instrumental deliveries and 
cesarean section rates, the duration of the inclusion period (ie, 
the length of the antenatal to postpartum period studied), lab-
oratory culture methods used and sensitivity of detection, and 
use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and/or antenatal and 
postnatal antibiotic use (which was poorly reported in these 
studies), which will reduce detection of GBS [26].
The influence of the case definition used can be seen when 
comparing the study focusing on severe maternal sepsis with 
strictly applied clinical criteria, which found the lowest inci-
dence of maternal GBS disease (0.01/1000 maternities) [42], to 
studies using microbiological results with less stringent clinical 
criteria, which reported higher incidence risks. For example, 
GBS bacteremia in febrile pregnant women had a reported inci-
dence of 0.3 per 1000 births [47]. The latter may overestimate 
cases, as transient bacteremia can occur in the absence of overt 
clinical sepsis, though in the presence of fever. These inconsist-
encies in studies purporting to investigate the same issue arise 
from a lack of consensus on maternal sepsis case definitions 
[48].
There are further issues with case ascertainment. First, clin-
ical signs of sepsis may be obscured to some extent by the 
physiological changes in pregnancy [43]. For example, leuko-
cytosis, a sign of sepsis (see Supplementary Table 2), is a nor-
mal physiological change in pregnancy; in 1 study only 38% of 
women with pre- or intrapartum bacteremia had a white cell 
count outside the normal reference range for pregnancy [43]. 
Second, many studies looked only at cases of bacteremia, and 
not at cultures from other sterile sites, underestimating the bur-
den of GBS disease. Third, some febrile pregnant or postpartum 
women might not have had blood samples taken, reducing case 
ascertainment. Finally, in up to half of cases of severe sepsis the 
infection is polymicrobial—that is, a single causative organism 
cannot be identified from a sterile culture site [49], again lead-
ing to an underestimate of the number of cases of maternal GBS 
disease.
The inclusion period considered by the study could also 
affect the incidence estimate. A longer postpartum inclusion 
period could increase case ascertainment, although this may be 
limited by the fact that most of the postpartum cases occurred 
within the first 48 hours after delivery, meaning an extended 
inclusion period may not necessarily detect many more cases. 
Some studies did not include the antenatal period, or only 
included the 7 days prior to delivery, which may underestimate 
cases and lead to an underestimate of the impact of GBS disease 
on miscarriages and following induced abortion, particularly 
unsafe abortion. It was not possible to conduct a sensitivity ana-
lysis to investigate the effect of the inclusion period as, within 
the 5 studies included in the meta-analyses, 4 different inclusion 
periods were used. The categorization of the timing of disease 
presents a risk of misclassification. For example, a case detected 
during labor might actually have been an antenatal case where 
the infection precipitated labor. In the only study where gesta-
tional age was reported, 6 cases of maternal GBS disease were 
identified during labor and 4 of these were premature labor 
(before 37 weeks), suggesting that these could have been ante-
natal infections [44].
The complete burden of maternal GBS disease is higher than 
that estimated here, as there are many other infections caused 
by GBS. This includes chorioamnionitis (intra-amniotic infec-
tion) and postpartum endometritis (PPE), both important 
contributors to maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality and 
morbidity. A study in the United States found that GBS was the

most common cause of endometritis or chorioamnionitis [19]. 
Chorioamnionitis (infection of the intrauterine environment 
and fetal membranes) affects 1%–4% of pregnancies in devel-
oped countries; the incidence in low- and middle-income con-
texts is not known [50]. In one study, GBS was recovered from 
amniotic fluid from 15% of women with chorioamnionitis [51]. 
PPE occurs in around 5% of all vaginal births and 10% of cesar-
ean deliveries in developed countries [52]. Most cases of PPE 
are not evaluated using sterile site cultures because endometri-
tis is treated empirically [25]. Nonetheless, GBS is an impor-
tant cause of PPE; a systematic review of 25 studies reported the 
recovery of GBS from the endometrium in 305 of 3026 (10%) 
women with PPE [53]. The incidence of PPE, and the contri-
bution of GBS to this, in low- and middle-income contexts is 
unknown. It is likely to be higher, with fewer deliveries using 
antisepsis measures and reduced access to antibiotic prophy-
laxis [54]; however, unpublished data from an ongoing study in 
Pakistan found that 11 of 468 (2.4%) endometrial samples taken 
for suspected PPE were positive for GBS (Shakoor et al, for the 
ANISA-Postpartum Sepsis Study Group, personal communica-
tion, 2017). While data from low- and middle-income contexts 
are limited, the data from developed countries suggest that GBS 
is an important contributor to total maternal infectious mor-
bidity and perinatal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, even 
in the absence of systemic infection and sepsis.
We noted an apparent fall in the incidence of maternal GBS 
disease in the United States, the only country with serial data, 
from the 1970s to the early 2000s with a possible subsequent 
plateau (Supplementary Table 3). This is compatible with the 
decline in the incidence of sepsis noted in developed countries 
over this time period, recent increases in incidence notwith-
standing. It is also in keeping with other findings of a fall in inci-
dence of GBS disease in the United States, which may be due 
to the introduction of universal screening and increased use of 
intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) during this time [45]. 
The fact that screening and IAP cannot prevent all maternal or 
neonatal disease further supports the case for vaccination prior 
to labor.
The serotype distribution of maternal GBS disease is, unsur-
prisingly, similar to that seen in maternal colonization [21] and 
EOGBS [33]. In all 3 population groups, Ia, III, and V are the 
most common serotypes causing disease, though there is more 
serotype III in neonatal disease [33]. Given this similarity, cur-
rent vaccine candidates are likely to be effective in preventing 
some maternal GBS disease.
CONCLUSIONS
This first review of maternal GBS disease suggests that the inci-
dence in developed countries is lower than, but comparable to, 
neonatal disease in developed countries, and that associated 
maternal mortality and morbidity are uncommon sequelae. 
In contrast, the risk for the neonate, in terms of mortality and 
morbidity, is increased. Given that most maternal cases were 
peri- or postpartum, maternal vaccination in the late second or 
early third trimester is likely to be effective at preventing GBS 
disease in the mother as well as the infant.
The absence of studies from low- and middle-income con-
texts means these findings cannot be generalized. The incidence 
of 0.23 (95% CI, .09–.37) per 1000 maternities should be seen as 
a “minimum estimate” of maternal GBS disease, given the likely 
higher incidence in the rest of the world, and the fact that we 
have only considered the more severe, systemic cases and not 
all infections caused by GBS during pregnancy and the post-
partum period.
There is a need for high-quality research into the etiology of 
maternal sepsis worldwide, but especially in low- and middle-in-
come contexts. This need is credited in the new Global Maternal 
and Neonatal Sepsis Initiative. This commenced in 2015 under 
the leadership of the World Health Organization and Jhpiego 
Table 2. Key Findings and Implications
What’s new about this?
• This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of maternal GBS disease worldwide and to describe the causative serotypes 
and outcomes of disease.
What was the main finding?
• The incidence of maternal GBS disease in the developed region is lower than, but comparable to, neonatal GBS disease in the developed region at approxi-
mately 0.38 (95% CI, .28–.48) per 1000 pregnancies and 0.23 (95% CI, .09–.37) per 1000 maternities. The serotype distribution of maternal GBS disease is 
similar to that seen in maternal colonization and early-onset neonatal GBS disease, with serotypes Ia, III, and V most common. The risk of maternal mortality 
or morbidity is low; however, the risk for the neonate, in terms of mortality and morbidity, is increased.
How can the data be improved?
• The incidence of maternal GBS disease in low- and middle-income contexts is an important data gap. To improve the availability and comparability of data, 
standardized surveillance and reporting systems are required. Agreement is needed on the parameters used to define maternal GBS disease, pregnancies 
should be used as the denominator, and appropriate follow-up should be conducted to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.
What does it mean for policy and programs?
• As most maternal GBS disease is peripartum or postpartum, maternal vaccination in the late second or early third trimester is likely to be effective at pre-
venting GBS disease in the mother as well as the infant. Maternal GBS vaccination would be expected to be more effective than IAP in preventing maternal 
postpartum GBS sepsis; a maternal vaccine study should measure this outcome and could also contribute to improved measurement of burden as a “vaccine 
probe” approach.

(an international, nonprofit health organization affiliated with 
The Johns Hopkins University). The Initiative notes the impor-
tance of infection in maternal and newborn morbidity and 
mortality; the goals include research on the burden and causes, 
prevention, and management, and information/advocacy [55]. 
Community-based mother and newborn surveillance systems 
with identification, appropriate biosampling, and management, 
such as those implemented in South Asia, can shed further light 
on the microbiology, along with the epidemiology of maternal 
infection, including GBS [56].
However, as 80% of the world’s births are now facility 
based, a routine approach to surveillance is becoming more 
feasible. National surveillance systems for maternal sepsis 
would ensure that more attention is paid to pregnant and 
postpartum women with a fever. Systematically sampling 
with appropriate laboratory investigation should be done if 
women have a fever, whether antenatally, during labor, or 
after birth. Women and their babies should be followed up 
to assess clinical outcomes. To facilitate international com-
parisons regarding GBS, agreement on the parameters used 
to determine cases of maternal GBS disease and the denom-
inator is required. Because sepsis may occur at any stage of 
pregnancy, and may influence the outcome of pregnancy, 
the recommended denominator is all pregnant women. Such 
studies are needed globally, but especially in developing 
countries to fill this data gap. These data are required to assess 
the burden of GBS disease and to determine the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of antenatal screening, treatment, and vac-
cination strategies to inform policy decisions (Table 2).
