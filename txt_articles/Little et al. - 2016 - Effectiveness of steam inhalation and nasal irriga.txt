hinosinusitis probably affects more than 
25 million Americans and 2.5 million 
Canadians.1 Quality of life of patients 
with chronic or recurrent sinusitis has been re-
ported to be similar to congestive heart disease 
and chronic pulmonary disease.2 Antibiotics are 
prescribed for nearly all patients with sinusitis,3 
but the evidence is modest4 and an international 
priority is to contain antibiotic resistance.5 Steam 
inhalation is widely advocated in rhinosinusitis, 
but a Cochrane review of steam for the “common 
cold” found equivocal evidence,6 and a recent 
primary care trial found no benefit and some 
harm (mild thermal injury) for pragmatic advice 
to inhale steam twice daily for a range of respira-
tory tract infections.7 The Cochrane review of 
 
nasal saline irrigation reported benefit.8 However, 
most of the trials were small, mainly from sec-
ondary care settings, and the review documented 
symptom data from only 129 participants, with 
high heterogeneity. Two small randomized con-
trolled trials included some participants from pri-
mary care settings.9,10 One of the studies com-
pared a gravity-based nasal irrigation device with 
routine care among 76 participants mainly from 
primary care settings; it found that symptoms im-

Background: Systematic reviews support 
nasal saline irrigation for chronic or recurrent 
sinus symptoms, but trials have been small 
and few in primary care settings. Steam inha-
lation has also been proposed, but support-
ing evidence is lacking. We investigated 
whether brief pragmatic interventions to 
encourage use of nasal irrigation or steam 
inhalation would be effective in relieving 
sinus symptoms.
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic ran-
domized controlled trial involving adults 
(age 18–65 yr) from 72 primary care practices 
in the United Kingdom who had a history of 
chronic or recurrent sinusitis and reported a 
“moderate to severe” impact of sinus symp-
toms on their quality of life. Participants 
were recruited between Feb. 11, 2009, and 
June 30, 2014, and randomly assigned to 1 of 
4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal 
saline irrigation supported by a demonstra-
tion video, daily steam inhalation, or com-
bined treatment with both interventions. 
The primary outcome measure was the 
Rhino 
sinusitis Disability Index (RSDI). Patients 
were followed up at 3 and 6 months. We im-
puted missing data using multiple imputa-
tion methods.
Results: Of the 961 patients who consented, 
871 returned baseline questionnaires (210 
usual care, 219 nasal irrigation, 232 steam in-
halation and 210 combined treatment). A total 
of 671 (77.0%) of the 871 participants reported 
RSDI scores at 3 months. Patients’ RSDI scores 
improved more with nasal irrigation than 
without nasal irrigation by 3 months (crude 
change −7.42 v. −5.23; estimated adjusted 
mean difference between groups −2.51, 95% 
confidence interval −4.65 to −0.37). By 6 
months, significantly more patients main-
tained a 10-point clinically important improve-
ment in the RSDI score with nasal irrigation 
(44.1% v. 36.6%); fewer used over-the-counter 
medications (59.4% v. 68.0%) or intended to 
consult a doctor in future episodes. Steam in-
halation reduced headache but had no signifi-
cant effect on other outcomes. The proportion 
of participants who had adverse effects was 
the same in both intervention groups.
Interpretation: Advice to use steam inhalation 
for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms in pri-
mary care was not effective. A similar strategy 
to use nasal irrigation was less effective than 
prior evidence suggested, but it provided 
some symptomatic benefit. Trial registration:

proved very little in the control group (by 1 point 
on the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index [RSDI] 
converted to a 100-point scale), as compared with 
a 14-point improvement in the irrigation group.9 
The other (published since the Cochrane review) 
compared a positive-pressure squeeze bottle with 
saline nasal spray among 121 volunteers from 
various sources and found an 8.5-point improve-
ment in the control group, as compared with a 
15-point improvement in the irrigation group.10
We conducted a large pragmatic randomized 
controlled trial of the effectiveness of brief 
advice to use nasal irrigation or steam inhalation 
in routine primary care for chronic or recurrent 
sinus symptoms.
Methods
Study design and setting
We conducted a parallel-group, patient-level ran-
domized controlled trial with an equal allocation 
ratio between Feb. 11, 2009, and June 30, 2014. 
Primary care practices near the study centre in 
Southampton, England, were invited to partici-
pate. There were no exclusion criteria for prac-
tices. Adults identified from the computerized 
registers from 72 primary care practices were sent 
letters inviting them to attend a recruitment clinic 
run by practice nurses only if they reported “mod-
erate to severe impact of sinus symptoms on their 
quality of life.” Nurses assessed eligibility, ob-
tained consent and randomly assigned patients to 
1 of 4 advice strategies.
The study design was approved by the 
Hampshire Research Ethics Committee B.
Participants
We selected patients using pragmatic inclusion 
criteria that matched those of the Cochrane re-
view:8 age 18–65 years; 2 episodes of acute 
 
sinusitis or 1 episode of chronic sinusitis as the 
reason for the encounter recorded in the medical 
records in the 3 years before enrolment; and a 
 
report of “moderate to severe” impact of sinus 
symptoms on quality of life.
We excluded patients who were unable to 
complete outcome measures (e.g., language bar-
rier, too unwell, mental incapacity), had head or 
neck cancer, had HIV infection, were receiving 
immunosuppressive treatment, had cystic fibro-
sis, were pregnant or breastfeeding, or had other 
nasal disorders (e.g., polyps, and poor gag or 
swallow reflexes).
Interventions
We randomly assigned participants to 1 of 4 ad-
vice strategies defined by 2 interventions using a 
2 × 2 factorial design (nasal irrigation v. no nasal 
irrigation, and steam inhalation v. no steam 
inhalation).
Usual care: All of the study participants had 
access to usual care. The use of medications or 
referral was at the discretion of the patient’s 
phys 
ician according to his or her normal practice 
(i.e., not standardized).
Nasal saline irrigation: Participants were ran-
domly assigned to receive advice to use nasal sa-
line irrigation daily or no such advice. They 
were given verbal instructions and a link to 
watch a demonstration video on YouTube. They 
were given a neti pot (SinuCleanse Neti Pot, 
 
Ascent Consumer Products) and asked to irrigate 
their nose (150 mL through each nostril) daily 
for 6 months. Patients made their own buffered 
2.0% saline irrigation solution every 1 to 2 days 
comprising 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of salt (heaped), a 
half teaspoon (2.5 mL) of baking soda and 1 pint 
(473 mL) of tap water; how to do this was also 
shown on the video. We chose this particular in-
tervention based on the provisional evidence 
from a previous randomized controlled trial in 
primary care.9
Steam inhalation: Participants were also ran-
domly assigned to receive advice to use steam in-
halation daily or no such advice. Those advised 
to use this intervention were asked to inhale 
steam for 5 minutes each day by placing a towel 
over their head while standing over a bowl of re-
cently boiled water. This intervention was cho-
sen for its wide availability and ease of use; the 
advice sheet did not mention use of a particular 
commercial steaming device.
Combination treatment: This group included 
the participants who were randomly assigned to 
receive advice to perform both daily nasal irri-
gation and daily steam inhalation, as described 
above.
Randomization
With the use of computer-generated random num-
bers, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 
pragmatic advice strategies contained in opaque 
sealed numbered envelopes. Sealed envelopes 
were used for 2 reasons: (a) because of the com-
plex factorial design, envelopes facilitated imme-
diate access to the correct structured advice sheets 
for each group (which ensured robust group differ-
entiation) and helped simplify logistics for recruit-
ers; and (b) with attention to equipoise, this 
method has resulted in robust randomization in 
several studies.7,11–13 In our study, there was no evi-
dence of selective use of numbered envelopes or 
of meaningful difference in group characteristics.
Because of the nature of the interventions, it 
was not possible to conceal the group allocation 
from the participants and health care providers.

Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the vali-
dated RSDI.14 We chose this measure because it 
permitted comparisons with findings from a 
previous US primary care trial.9 Three months 
was the primary follow-up period specified in 
the funding application; 6 months was included 
to document longer term effects.
The secondary outcome measures were the 
20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20);15 
a single-item sinus severity assessment;9 severity 
of respiratory symptoms (as determined by the 
number of days feeling unwell with respiratory 
tract infections or sinusitis);16 reported use of 
over-the-counter medications, and reported head-
aches and adverse effects (e.g., nosebleeds, nasal 
burning or stinging); the EuroQol 5-dimension 
(EQ-5D) health-related quality-of-life index; anti-
biotic prescription and visits to primary care phy-
sician; and belief in antibiotics and belief in the 
need to see the doctor in future episodes. A cost-
effectiveness analysis will be reported elsewhere.
The RSDI, SNOT-20, single-item sinus se-
verity assessment and EQ-5D were completed at 
baseline, 3 and 6 months. Information on respi-
ratory and sinus symptoms, belief in the need to 
see the doctor, adverse effects and use of over-
the-counter medications was obtained at 3 and 6 
months. Review of medical records for antibiotic 
use and physician visits was done at 6 months.
Statistical analysis
To detect an interaction of 10 points in the RSDI 
between intervention groups, we estimated that 
we would need to power the study to detect a 
5-point (about 0.36 standard deviation) main ef-
fect. This would require a minimum of 125 pa-
tients per group, or 316 in total, to allow for 4 
study groups, 80% power, an α value of 0.05 and 
80% follow-up. Early pilot work suggested that 
compliance and attrition might be important is-
sues. We calculated that we would need to recruit 
1190 patients (250/[0.3 × 0.7]) if 30% complied 
and we achieved 70% follow-up at 6 months, 894 
patients (250/[0.4 × 0.7]) if 40% complied, and 
716 (250/[0.5 × 0.7]) if 50% complied. Our mini-
mum target, therefore, was 716 participants. 
Large samples also provided power for key ex-
ploratory secondary analyses (described below).
There were no interim analyses or rules for 
stopping the study. For missing data, we used 
multiple imputation (100 imputations) by 
chained equation model in Stata, using partici-
pant baseline characteristics, the outcome vari-
ables and the randomization group. We con-
trolled for baseline values in the multivariate 
linear regression models. Because the interaction 
term between the 2 interventions was not signifi-
cant for any outcome, we estimated the main ef-
fects of each intervention after controlling for the 
other intervention. We built models using back-
ward variable selection, retaining the variables 
that were associated with the outcome at p ≤ 0.2. 
Key exploratory secondary analyses were 
specified in advance: (a) the number of partici-
pants achieving a 10-point reduction in RSDI 
score, which was estimated to be the minimal 
clinically important difference in the context of 
surgical trials;17 (b) the physical subscale of the 
RSDI (where we anticipated the greatest impact) 
and the number of participants achieving a clini-
cally important 3.8-point reduction in the score 
for this subscale; and (c) other subgroups (effect 
of RSDI score above the median, history of al-
lergic rhinitis, higher deprivation score, age 
above the median, longer duration of sinus 
symptoms [> 15 yr], use of topical nasal steroids, 
and sex-specific effects).
Changes to the protocol
We increased the planned sample size to assess 
the impact of noncompliance, and we modified 
the randomization protocol (see above). We 
originally did not have permission from the eth-
ics committee to collect the RSDI data by phone, 
but we gained approval half-way through the 
trial because follow-up rates were too low. The 
primary analysis was initially intended for par-
ticipants with complete data, but because of 
lower follow-up (< 80%), we used multiple im-
putation to avoid the unlikely assumption that 
data were missing completely at random. 
Following peer review, we performed a post-
hoc secondary analysis among participants who 
used nasal corticosteroids. Because we did not 
specify the timing of nasal irrigation, it is possible 
that patients who irrigated following corticosteroid 
use could have lessened the net benefit of irrigation.
Results
A total of 961 eligible patients agreed to partici-
pate and were randomly assigned to the study 
groups; of these, 871 (90.6%) provided baseline 
data (Figure 1). The study groups were well bal-
anced (Table 1). Overall, the RSDI was com-
pleted by 671 of the particpants at 3 months and 
by 623 at 6 months. Because there was no evi-
dence of a significant interaction between inter-
vention groups for either RSDI or SNOT-20, the 
main results are presented by factorial groups (na-
sal irrigation v. no irrigation; steam inhalation v. 
no steam inhalation).
At 3 months, the group advised to perform 
nasal irrigation reported doing the intervention 
for a median of 20 (interquartile range [IQR]

5–30) days in the preceding month. Those in 
the steam inhalation group also reported doing 
the intervention for a median of 20 (IQR 6–30) 
days in the preceding month.
Participants’ RSDI scores improved more 
with nasal irrigation than with no nasal irrigation 
(crude change in score at 3 mo −7.42 v. −5.23).

mean difference between groups was −2.51 
(95% confidence interval [CI] −4.65 to −0.37) at 
3 months and −2.41 (95% CI −4.66 to −0.16) at 
6 months (Tables 2 and 3). The adjusted estimate 
differed slightly from the crude estimate because 
of better control of the small differences in con-
founding variables between groups. By 6 
months, significantly more patients maintained a 
10-point clinically important improvement in the 
RSDI score with nasal irrigation (44.1% v. 
36.6%; Table S1 in Appendix 1, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.160362/-/DC1), mostly in the physical sub-
scale of the RSDI (Tables S2 and S3 in Appen-
dix 1). There was no effect of steam inhalation 
(see Table 3). The analysis of complete cases 
was similar to the imputed analysis, although the 
imputed analysis was slightly more conservative. 
Although there were no significant interactions 
between interventions, the benefit of nasal irriga-
tion at 3 and 6 months occurred mostly in the 
combined treatment group (Appendix 1).
There were no significant differences in the 
SNOT-20 scores for either intervention at 3 or 6 
months (Table 3). Compared with those who did 
not use nasal irrigation, participants in the nasal 
irrigation group were more likely to agree by 6 
months that they would not visit a doctor for 
subsequent sinus symptoms (mean difference in 
score on 7-point Likert scale, 0.30, 95% CI 0.08 
to 0.53; Table 4) and less likely to report head-
ache at 3 months (72.0% v. 81.7%, p = 0.004; 
Table 5). Nasal irrigation resulted in less use of 
over-the-counter medications (60% v. 67.4%, 
p = 0.051) (Table 5). There was no difference in 
the number of respiratory infections reported in

the month before follow-up (median 1 for all 
groups at 3 and 6 mo). Nasal irrigation did not 
significantly reduce the number of days partici-
pants felt unwell with respiratory tract infections 
at 3 or 6 months (1 v. 2 d at 3 mo, and 2 v. 3 d at 
6 mo, respectively) (Table 6). Nasal irrigation 
significantly reduced the number of days of feel-
ing unwell with sinusitis at 6 months (4 v. 7 d 
without nasal irrigation) (Table 6). There was 
no effect of steam inhalation on the secondary 
outcomes except headache (Table 5).
There was no difference in the proportions 
of participants who experienced adverse effects 
(e.g., nose bleeds, nasal soreness or burning) in 
either intervention group (Table 5).
Prespecified subgroups
There was no evidence of a differential effect of 
either intervention in the clinical subgroups de-
fined before analysis (Tables S5, S6a and S6b, 
Appendix 1).
Following peer review, we assessed interac-
tion for nasal irrigation among individuals who 
used nasal corticosteroids. We found no evi-
dence of a lesser effect: the interaction term for 
the imputed dataset for RSDI scores was −2.90 
(95% CI −10.54 to 4.75) at 3 months and 0.37 
(95% CI −7.88 to 8.61) at 6 months. Further-
more, only a minority of participants used nasal 
corticosteroids (nasal irrigation: 9.5% [42/442]; 
no irrigation: 10.0% [43/429]).
Interpretation
This is one of the few studies to address the ef-
fectiveness of brief advice to use nasal irrigation 
or steam inhalation for chronic or recurrent sinus 
symptoms, and the largest trial in any setting. 
Brief advice to use nasal irrigation resulted in 
modest improvement in the primary outcome 
(RSDI score), which was significant at both 3 
and 6 months, and evidence of improvement in 
several secondary outcomes. A similar strategy 
to use steam inhalation was not effective.
The RSDI scores improved with nasal irriga-
tion, but the control group’s scores also improved. 
The 2- to 3-point difference between the irrigation 
and control groups, and a number needed to treat 
of about 13, was smaller than in 2 prior US trials

colleages10), which enrolled volunteer patients 
from primary care, secondary care and community 
settings. In the US studies, participants in the nasal 
irrigation groups reported changes on 100-point 
scales of 14 and 15 points,9,10 as compared with 1 
and 8.5 points reported by the control groups.9,10 
Several factors may have contributed to the differ-
ences: Rabago and colleagues allowed participants 
to know their previous ratings, which may have 
anchored the control group responses, and pro-
vided individualized training (including video, live 
demonstration and coached practice to ensure pro-
ficiency), which was valued.18 Pynnonen and col-
leagues also allowed coached practice, and both 
studies had more follow-up contacts and diary 
monitoring. These more intensive approaches may 
have increased treatment effect through adherence. 
However, participants in our study used irrigation 
on most days, and the impact was the same among 
participants who irrigated more often. Although 
the number of irrigations may not explain the dis-
crepancies, the quality and duration of irrigation 
may still be relevant. Rabago and colleagues9 as-
sessed a more severely affected sample; however, 
we found no evidence of greater effectiveness 
among participants in our study who had higher 
RSDI scores at baseline. Participants in the 2 US 
studies were younger (10 and 6 years younger on 
average than our study population, respectively) 
and had a much shorter history of sinus com-
plaints; therefore, symptoms may have been more 
amenable to change. Culturally, nasal irrigation is 
popular in the US, and expectations about benefit 
may be higher.
We found potentially important changes in 
other outcomes; in particular, fewer participants 
in the nasal irrigation group than in the no-
irrigation group had headaches, used over-the-
counter medications and intended to consult a 
doctor in future episodes. Although there was no 
significant difference in either physician visits or 
antibiotic use, as might be expected over only a

6-month follow-up period, our findings concern-
ing consultations are important in the longer 
term, given antibiotic use increases the risk of 
antimicrobial resistance.
Apart from being associated with fewer head-
aches, the strategy of advising patients to use 
steam inhalation was ineffective in our study, a 
finding that matches the limited impact in acute 
coryzal illness6 or in acute respiratory tract infec-
tions more generally.7 However, advice to use na-
sal irrigation was beneficial mostly in the com-
bined treatment group, which suggests a possible 
role for steam inhalation in supporting nasal irri-
gation. There was no evidence of the modest 
harm (minor thermal injury) previously observed 
among patients using steam inhalation for acute 
respiratory tract infections.7 We chose a prag-
matic target of steam inhalation once a day, be-
cause intrusive interventions that require more 
effort and offer limited benefit are not main-
tained. Whether a more intensive approach to 
this intervention might be beneficial is unclear.
Limitations
The proportion of patients who consented to par-
ticipate in the study but did not provide a base-
line RSDI score (9.4%) was much higher than in 
our previous studies. This suggests that we may 
not have engaged individuals adequately when 
obtaining their consent; despite feedback to the 
practices, there was no improvement during the 
trial. However, the participants who did return 
the questionnaire were almost identical to the 
sample who consented.
Slightly less than 80% follow-up was achieved, 
but we found little evidence of attrition bias using 
multiple imputation. 
The primary outcome was self-reported, but 
the impact on symptoms can be documented only 
by self-report, and the ineffectiveness of steam in-
halation suggests that generalized reporting bias 
was unlikely. Furthermore, meaningful changes 
also occurred in other outcomes.
The rate of uptake to the baseline appointment 
was more than 40%, which is good for a cold-call 
invitation, and the participants were our intended 
target (i.e., sufficiently concerned about their 
symptoms to be motivated for self-management).
Randomization envelopes were chosen for 
good logistic reasons, but equally they can be 
used to undermine randomization. However, there 
was no evidence of either selective use of enve-
lopes or significant differences in characteristics 
between groups, which suggests that the random-
ization worked. We also controlled for a range of 
baseline characteristics.
We chose chronic or recurrent acute sinus 
symptoms, so the sample was heterogeneous (e.g., 
some participants had allergic rhinitis, and the 
duration of prior illness varied). However, these 
criteria were similar to those in prior studies and 
in the Cochrane review,8 and there was no evi-
dence of substantial selective treatment effects in 
any clinical subgroup.
The inclusion criteria were based on the clinical 
diagnosis recorded by the doctor, and participants 
reported substantial impact on their quality of life. 
It is possible that a more tightly defined group 
might have benefitted more from the interventions.
The timing of nasal irrigation was not speci-
fied, but we found no evidence of a lesser effect 
among patients who used nasal corticosteroids.
Conclusion
Brief advice to use nasal irrigation in routine pri-
mary care for chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms 
was less effective than prior evidence suggested, 
but it resulted in reduced overall symptom burden, 
headache, use of over-the-counter medications and 
the perceived need to consult primary care physi-
cians in future episodes. Steam inhalation had no 
consistent benefits. Future research on nasal irriga-
tion should address how much coaching is needed, 
the role of expectations and its place in relieving 
symptoms of acute sinusitis.
