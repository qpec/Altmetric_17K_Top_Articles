 Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and stress and adjustment
disorders are common psychiatric disorders in general practice. In
Europe, the estimated proportions of patients visiting a general
practitioner (GP) because of these disorders vary between 12
and 32%.1–5 Depressive, anxiety, and stress and adjustment disor-
ders cause emotional and social difficulties for patients and their
relatives, loss of income and a poorer quality of life. These very
common psychiatric disorders also place a large economic burden
on society. Standard treatment of depressive, anxiety, and stress
and adjustment disorders includes pharmacological treatment
and/or different types of psychotherapy. For example, cognitive–
behavioural therapy (CBT) has been recognised as an effective
way of treating depressive disorders6 and is currently being
introduced as a standard treatment in Swedish general practices.
A meta-analysis of CBT for adult depression, based on 115 studies,
found that CBT is an effective treatment for adult depression. The
authors also concluded that CBT is the most studied psychotherapy
for depression, and thus has the greatest weight of evidence.7 In
Sweden, clinical psychologists and social counsellors mainly give
CBT on an individual basis. However, CBT therapists are in short
supply and the individual therapeutic approach is expensive for
the tax-financed healthcare system. A stronger focus on group
therapy in general practice could help to save limited resources
and might, according to a study involving participants from 46
general practices in Sweden, be implemented in the routine care
of patients with depression.8
Mindfulness-based therapies might be suitable for group therapy
sessions for psychiatric patients in general practice. An important
advantage of mindfulness-based
therapies over most other
psychotherapies are that mindfulness may be accessible to larger
groups of patients as they can, after introduction, practice
mindfulness on their own. A practice review of the benefits of
mindfulness found that mindfulness-based therapies decrease
depressive symptoms and anxiety and reduce psychological
distress. Mindfulness was also associated with less physical illness,
improved well-being, increased self-control, decreased negative
affect, better affect tolerance and improved concentration, focus
attention and working memory. Among therapists, it was
associated with increased empathy and better overall wellness.9 A
recent meta-analysis based on 19 studies found that mindfulness-
and acceptance-based interventions are associated with robust and
substantial reductions in symptoms of anxiety and comorbid
depressive symptoms.10 Practising mindfulness regularly may
decrease vulnerability to cognitive and emotional reactions
leading to stress and other psychological problems.11 Merely by
means of specific breathing techniques, the patient learns to focus
and sustain attention and increase his or her awareness. Habitual
and negative automatic reactions and responses to emotions and
cognition can thereby be prevented. Instead, more balanced
responses and reactions will be possible choices for the patient.11
Finally, recent research has shown that mindfulness has positive
effects on affective experience.12 as well as on cognition and
pain.13,14 Mindfulness-based therapies have become increasingly
popular as therapeutic strategies for a variety of medical and
psychiatric conditions and include mindfulness-based stress
reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT).15–18 MBSR is a clinically based method with developed
manuals and standardised techniques19 and MBCT is based on
an integration of CBT and MBSR.15 One important advantage
when implementing MBSR is that certified instructors can give
MBSR after a 6-day course. The instructors may have a
background as psychologists or social counsellors but may also
be nurses, physiotherapists or doctors. In Sweden, MBCT is a
method that is used to treat mild to moderate depression and
chronic stress reactions.20 However, mindfulness-based therapies
are not well documented regarding their effectiveness in group
therapy sessions given in general practice settings, where a
majority of patients are treated. This study addresses this issue.

Mindfulness group therapy in primary care
patients with depression, anxiety and stress and
adjustment disorders: randomised controlled trial
Jan Sundquist, A
˚ sa Lilja, Karolina Palme
´ r, Ashfaque A. Memon, Xiao Wang, Leena Maria Johansson
and Kristina Sundquist
Background
Individual-based cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) is in
short supply and expensive.
Aims
The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to
compare mindfulness-based group therapy with treatment as
usual (primarily individual-based CBT) in primary care patients
with depressive, anxiety or stress and adjustment disorders.
Method
This 8-week RCT (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01476371) was
conducted during spring 2012 at 16 general practices in
Southern Sweden. Eligible patients (aged 20–64 years) scored
510 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 57 on the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale or 13–34 on the
Montgomery–A
˚ sberg Depression Rating Scale (self-rated
version). The power calculations were based on non-
inferiority. In total, 215 patients were randomised. Ordinal
mixed models were used for the analysis.
Results
For all scales and in both groups, the scores decreased
significantly. There were no significant differences between
the mindfulness and control groups.
Conclusions
Mindfulness-based group therapy was non-inferior to
treatment as usual for patients with depressive, anxiety or
stress and adjustment disorders.
Declaration of interest
None.

 The aim of this clinical randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to
compare the effect of a structured mindfulness-based group
therapy programme with treatment as usual (TAU, mostly
individual CBT) in patients with clinical diagnoses of depressive,
anxiety and stress and adjustment disorders in 16 general practices
in Southern Sweden.
Method
Recruitment of general practices
This RCT was conducted in the county of Ska
˚ne, the most
Southern region in Sweden. Ska
˚ne includes 150 general practices
serving a population of 1.3 million people. Twenty-four general
practices from all parts of the region were randomly selected in
order to achieve a geographic representativeness of the whole
county. J.S. informed all the directors at the 24 general practices
via an email that provided details about the study and possible
participation.
Recruitment of instructors
Seventeen of the contacted 24 general practices were interested in
participating in the study and one dropped out at an early stage.
The staff at the remaining 16 general practices (participation rate
16/24, 67%) were informed about the study by their clinical
directors, who also suggested suitable occupational groups for
the task as instructors (i.e. psychologists, social counsellors,
nurses, physiotherapists and doctors).
Training of instructors
Our goal was to train two instructors per participating general
practice. Two of the 16 general practices were relatively small
and located close to each other and were therefore given
permission to work together. In total, 30 instructors (mainly
psychologists
and
social
counsellors)
received
the
training
programme at our department (Center for Primary Health Care
Research, Malmo
¨, Sweden). The training was given during 6 days
that were evenly spread between September 2011 and December
2011 and all sessions were led by Ola Schenstro
¨m (O.S.) and
L.M.J., one of the authors. O.S. was trained at the Center for
Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society, founded by
Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts, US. O.S. is a
leading expert in mindfulness education in Sweden and L.M.J.
is a psychiatrist and licensed psychotherapist with long clinical
experience of mindfulness therapy.
A key part of the training is the future instructors’ own
mindfulness training. The future instructors were trained in how
to guide individuals and groups in mindfulness training so that
the individual may develop a greater awareness of thoughts,
feelings and bodily sensations and be able to cope better with
stress and difficulties in everyday life. All the 30 participants
in the 6-day course completed the course, passed the oral
examination and became certified mindfulness instructors. The
6-day course was given to the 30 participants at no cost.
Recruitment of patients
Each participating general practice was responsible for the
recruitment of patients who met the inclusion criteria (see below).
The recruitment of patients started on 4 January 2012 and ended
on 22 March 2012. Newly diagnosed patients as well as those who
had a history of psychiatric disorders were eligible. However, only
those who sought treatment for their psychiatric disorder during
the recruitment period were considered for inclusion in the study.
Typically, the patient called the general practice and talked to a
nurse, who asked what type of medical problem the patient had.
If the nurse suspected that the patient might be eligible for
inclusion in the study, she or he booked an appointment with
the doctor that was 10–15 min longer than usual in order to make
sure that the doctor had time to inform potentially eligible
patients about participation in the study. The patients also
received written information about the study and were given the
opportunity to ask questions. It was emphasised to the patient
that participation was voluntary and could be terminated at any
time during the study. If the patient agreed to participate, both
the doctor and the patient signed a written informed consent.
The patients were assessed for the need of pharmacological
treatment and were prescribed psychotropic drugs if that was
considered necessary. Sometimes the doctor also ordered thyroid
laboratory tests, in order to exclude potential thyroid disease that
might explain the psychiatric symptoms. If the thyroid tests were
abnormal, the patient was not considered for inclusion in the
study. After the consultation, the patient was asked to fill in three
self-rated depression and anxiety scales: the Montgomery–A
˚ sberg
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S),21 the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS, anxiety and depression subscales)22 and
the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).23
Inclusion criteria
The four criteria below all needed to be fulfilled for inclusion in
the study. The listed ICD-1024 codes in the first criterion were
based on clinical diagnoses, made by medical doctors.
(a) One or more of the following ICD-10 psychiatric diagnoses:
F32.0, mild depressive episode; F32.1, moderate depressive
episode; F32.9, depressive episode, unspecified; F33.0, recurrent
depressive disorder, current episode mild; F33.1, recurrent
depressive disorder, current episode moderate; F41.0, panic
disorder; F41.1, generalized anxiety disorder; F41.2, mixed
anxiety and depressive disorder; F41.3, other mixed anxiety
disorders; F41.8, other specified anxiety disorders; F41.9,
anxiety disorder, unspecified; F43.2, adjustment disorders;
F43.8, other reactions to severe stress; and F43.9, reaction to
severe stress, unspecified.
(b) Age 20–64 years (i.e. the population of working age).
(c) Ability to speak and read Swedish.
(d) One or more of the following cut-offs: a score between 13 and
34 on the MADRS-S scale; a score 57 on the HADS-A scale; a
score 57 on the HADS-D scale; a score 510 on the PHQ-9
scale.
Exclusion criteria were: severe psychiatric symptoms requiring
psychiatric care, risk of suicide; inability to participate at group
sessions because of severe substance misuse; pregnancy; current
psychotherapy of any kind; participation in any other psychiatric
intervention study; thyroid disease (if newly diagnosed by the
doctor).
Self-rated scales and cut-offs
MADRS-S
The MADRS was designed in 1979 by British and Swedish
researchers in order to measure the severity and change over
time of depressive symptoms in patients with mood disorders.21
A self-rated version of this scale, MADRS-S, has often been used
in clinical practice and the agreement between physicians’ and
patients’ ratings is moderate to good.25 The MADRS-S instrument
has nine questions/items, with each item yielding a score of 0–6.
129
Mindfulness therapy in primary care patients
 Sundquist et al
The overall score ranges from 0 to 54 points. Usual cut-offs are as
follows: 0–12 (no depression), 13–19 (mild depression), 20–34
(moderate depression) and 434 (severe depression).
HADS
The HADS was developed in 1983 to identify possible cases of
anxiety and depression among patients in non-psychiatric hospital
clinics.22 It was divided into an anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and a
depression subscale (HADS-D), both containing seven items. A
review of 747 identified papers that used HADS concluded that
‘an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity was
achieved when caseness was defined by a score of 8 or above on
both HADS-A and HADS-D’
.26 Usual cut-off points for both
HADS-A and HADS-D are as follows: 8–10 (mild anxiety/
depression), 11–14 (moderate anxiety/depression) and 515
(severe anxiety/depression).
PHQ-9
The PHQ is a self-rated version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic
instrument for common mental disorders.23 The PHQ-9 is the
depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV27
criteria for depression as ‘0’ (not at all) to ‘3’ (nearly every day).
Usual cut-off points for PHQ-9 are as follows: 0–4 (no
depression), 5–9 (mild depression), 10–14 (moderate depression),
15–19
(moderately
severe
depression)
and
20–27
(severe
depression).
The rationale for using multiple scales to assess symptoms of
depression and anxiety was that different scales are used in
different clinical practices worldwide and we wanted to increase
the generalisability of our results as well as the robustness of
our findings. With the MADRS-S, an upper limit for the score
was set in order to exclude those participants with severe
depression, whereas no such upper limit was set for HADS-A,
HADS-D and PHQ-9. The rationale for this decision was that
previous research comparing the HADS-D and PHQ-9 has shown
that they differ considerably in how they categorise severity and
that further work is needed to assess the validity of these scales’
severity cut-off bands.28
Randomisation
The certified mindfulness instructors called those participants that
were eligible for inclusion in the study. The instructors were
present at the participants’ first study-related visit to the general
practice. This first visit was performed before any psychotherapy
or counselling had been started and often took place in a group.
During the visit, participants provided blood samples and filled
in a questionnaire that included general questions about their
health, current medication and sociodemographic characteristics.
They were also informed as to whether they would be included in
the intervention or control group. The randomisation protocol
was designed by the Competence Centre for Clinical Research at
Lund University and included a list with numbers 1–20 for each
general practice. Each number corresponded to allocation to the
intervention or the control group and participants were added
to the list in the order in which they signed the informed consent
form. Once allocated to one of the two groups, participants were
not allowed to change group. The allocation was masked, that is,
the investigators did not know during the allocation to which
group they were assigning each patient.
Intervention
The programme used in the present study was based on the two
mindfulness-based
therapies
MBSR29–31
and
MBCT.15–18
It
included structured and controlled meditative exercises. The
period of intervention varied somewhat between the different
sites. The first and last mindfulness session took place on 26
January 2012 and 15 May 2012, respectively, in the 16 general
practices. The mindfulness-based group therapy lasted 8 weeks
and was given in 2 h sessions, once a week. The participants were
also instructed to practice mindfulness at home for 20 min/day
and were given a compact disc, a training manual and a diary
for this purpose. On average, the participants undertook 102
individual-based mindfulness sessions (s.d. = 44, range 0–219).
Two mindfulness instructors were present at each group session
and each group consisted of a maximum of ten participants.
The time for the sessions was flexible, in order to increase the
participation rate. Individual attendance at each group session
was recorded but not required. Participants were asked to wear
comfortable clothes and to bring a mat or blanket for some of
the exercises. All participants received pharmacological treatment,
if deemed necessary, and follow-up by the doctor at the general
practice.
Control group
The control group received TAU, which sometimes included
pharmacological treatment and in most cases also psychotherapy
or counselling. Most patients in the control group received CBT
(n = 80). The average number of individual CBT sessions was six.
Follow-up
Immediately after the intervention, all participants were evaluated
for psychiatric symptoms using the same questionnaires as
described above. The participants were asked to come to the
general practice to fill in the questionnaires.
Site visits
To ensure data credibility, patient integrity and patient safety, a
research team consisting of one research nurse, one psychologist
and one project administrator supported all sites at monitoring
visits.
Ethical considerations and handling of personal data
The study was performed according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. It was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Lund University prior to its commencement on 5 October 2011
(application no. 2011/491).
Written
informed
consent
was
obtained
from
all
participants.
All
data
were
analysed
anonymously. During the intervention, identification lists were
kept in a locked place by the mindfulness instructors. However,
all names and personal ID numbers (the Swedish version of social
security numbers) were replaced with anonymous serial numbers,
which were associated with all questionnaires throughout the
study. The results are reported at the group level and it is not
be possible to identify individuals.
Statistical analyses and power calculations
All analyses were repeated for the four outcome scales: MADRS-S,
HADS-A,
HADS-D
and
PHQ-9.
Differences
in
baseline
characteristics between the mindfulness and control groups were
tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test for medians, Student’s t-test
for means and w2 test for proportions. Within-group analyses
(median
change
between
baseline
and
follow-up
in
the
mindfulness and control group) were conducted using Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. The rationale for having the main focus on
medians rather than means was the ordinal nature of our data:
all scales for assessments of depressive symptoms and anxiety were
based on ordinal data. To test the robustness of our analyses, we
also analysed the data based on mean scores and in a continuous
130
 Mindfulness therapy in primary care patients
manner; the results were almost identical (Table 4). Because of the
potential correlation of measurements within individuals as well
as within general practices, we used an ordinal mixed model (in
this case a proportional odds mixed model) to examine the effect
of mindfulness on the outcome (change from baseline), adjusted
for the baseline score. Another advantage with mixed models is
that all available data are used under the missing at random
assumption, which means that data from those who drop out as
well as data from those who complete the study can be used. All
scales were categorised and odds ratios (ORs) were estimated
using ordinal logistic regression models (the proportional odds
model relaxes the assumption of identical log odds over all levels
of the outcome). An interaction term between time and
randomisation group was created to estimate the treatment effect.
In an explorative analysis we wanted to examine how the
number of attended mindfulness sessions affected the outcome
and also to separately analyse the control group according to
CBT and other types of psychotherapy/counselling. We used
median change from baseline (adjusted for baseline score) to
explore this. This was obtained by applying a median regression
model to the data and by then predicting the median for the
different groups, adjusted for the sample mean for baseline score.
Confidence intervals were obtained from bootstrapped standard
errors.
Patients who had not responded on three or more items on
the scales were counted as missing. For those who had missing
values for one or two items, the mean number of points for the
questions they had responded to was used to impute values for
the missing questions. In a sensitivity analysis we also examined
how influential observations and outliers affected our results.
Cluster effects, i.e. people from the same general practice being
more alike than people from different general practices, were
assessed as variance between general practices. This variance was
very small compared with the individual variance and did not
change our results. Stata version 12 for Windows was used for
all statistical analyses.
The power calculations were based on the assumption that the
mindfulness group therapy would be no worse than TAU. We
therefore performed a power calculation that was based on non-
inferiority. The patients were expected to have mild to moderate
depression, i.e. 13–34 points on the MADRS-S and a mean
MADRS-S score of 20 at baseline. The treatment group was
considered non-inferior to the control group at a difference of
at most 3.5 points. Based on previous studies, we assumed that
the improvement in the control group would be around 15 points
after treatment32 and judged that a difference between the
mindfulness and control groups of 3.5 points would represent a
clinically negligible difference between the two groups. In the
non-inferiority analysis, we used a 97.5% one-sided confidence
interval to examine whether the upper limit exceeded 3.5. With
a standard deviation of 8, a power of 80% and an alpha (a) of
0.025, each group should consist of at least 83 patients. With an
expected drop-out rate of about 30%, the final number of patients
per group should be 119. Based on these assumptions, the study
would have an effect size of 0.4, which corresponds to a ‘medium
level’ (‘small to moderate level’ according to Cohen).33 Using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test instead of a t-test gave almost the same
efficiency (the asymptotic relative efficiency of the two tests never
falls below 0.864).34
Results
In total, 215 eligible patients at the 16 general practices were
randomised to either mindfulness (n = 110) or the control group
(n = 105). Figure 1 shows the randomisation, drop-out, missing
items and observed cases. The main reasons for drop-out were
work situation and lack of time. Other reasons included moving
house, sickness, no desire for treatment and disappointment at
being
randomised
to
the
control
group.
The
number
of
participants who dropped out after the randomisation and
baseline examination was higher in the mindfulness group
(n = 18) than in the control group (n = 9). There were no
significant
differences
in
sociodemographic
characteristics
between those who dropped out and those who remained in the
study. However, those who dropped out scored significantly
higher at baseline on all scales than those who remained in the
study. A total of 81 (MADRS-S), 83 (HADS-A and HADS-D)
and 82 (PHQ-9) patients were included in the final analysis of
the mindfulness group. For the control group, a total of 86
(MADRS-S, HADS-A and HADS-D) and 85 (PHQ-9) patients
were included in the final analysis.
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics and missing data in the
two groups. The mean age was 42 and 41 years in the mindfulness
and control groups, respectively. Women as well as those with a
middle or high level of education were in the large majority in
both groups. Around two-thirds were married. More patients were
not taking medication than those who were for depression or
anxiety. There were no significant differences in sociodemographic
characteristics or medication between the two groups. The P-values
for treatment with antidepressants and tranquilisers were 0.882
and 0.937, respectively, which indicates that there were no
statistically significant differences in pharmacological treatment
between the mindfulness and the control group. Baseline scores

 Sundquist et al
for MADRS-S (23 v. 20, P= 0.045) and HADS-D (9 v. 8, P= 0.050)
were significantly higher in the control group than in the mindful-
ness group. The most common therapy in the control group was
individual CBT (CBT, n= 80; physical activity therapy, n= 2; none,
n = 8.).
Table 2 shows median scores and number of observed cases at
baseline and follow-up in the mindfulness and control groups.
Before the treatment started, the scores indicated mild to
moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety in the different
subgroups. After the intervention had ended, the scores indicated
no to mild symptoms in the different subgroups. For all three
scales, the median scores decreased significantly in both groups;
all P-values were 50.001. There were no significant differences
(treatment effects) between the mindfulness and control groups
(Tables 3 and 4) for any of the three scales. The estimated
differences in Table 4 were based on mean values.
Table 5 shows median score changes from baseline, adjusted
for baseline score, in the mindfulness group (by number of
mindfulness sessions, i.e. 1–5 or 6–8 sessions) and control group
(any treatment or CBT only). The control group in Model 1
includes those patients with any treatment (for example CBT,
body awareness or counselling) whereas the control group in
Model 2 only includes those with CBT. In both control groups,
there was a statistically significant change in median score at
follow-up, compared with baseline, for MADRS-S, HADS-D,
HADS-A and PHQ-9, i.e. all the self-rated scales used in this
study. Among those who had undergone 6–8 mindfulness
sessions, there were also significant changes at follow-up for all
the self-rated scales in both models. However, among those who
had undergone 1–5 mindfulness sessions, there were statistically
significant changes at follow-up only for the HADS-D scale. For
MADRS-S, HADS-A and PHQ-9, there were no statistically
significant changes at follow-up after only 1–5 mindfulness
sessions. The absolute differences in median change among those
who had undergone 6–8 mindfulness sessions v. those who had
undergone only 1–5 mindfulness sessions were 2.55, 1.00, 2.80
and
4.31
for
MADRS-S,
HADS-D,
HADS-A and
PHQ-9,
respectively (control group: any treatment). These differences
were, however, not statistically significant (Table 6).
In an explorative analysis we examined separately those
participants on antidepressants and those not on them. The results
remained the same in both groups (data not shown). We also
performed a non-inferiority analysis in order to test whether the
mindfulness treatment was non-inferior to TAU. We used a
97.5% one-sided confidence interval to examine whether the
upper limit exceeded 3.5. This test showed that mindfulness was
non-inferior to TAU (upper limit 3.17). Finally, in a sensitivity
analysis we examined whether any influential observations or
outliers affected the results, which was not the case.

 Mindfulness therapy in primary care patients
Discussion
Main findings and comparison with findings from
other studies
The main finding of the present RCT is that mindfulness group
therapy given in a general practice setting, where a majority of
patients with depression, anxiety, and stress and adjustment disorders
are treated, is non-inferior to individual-based therapy, including
CBT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT performed
in a general practice setting where the effect of mindfulness group
therapy was compared with an active control group.
Although a growing body of research has examined the effect
of mindfulness on somatic as well as psychiatric conditions,
scientific knowledge from RCT studies is scarce. For example, a
2007 review based on 15 various types of studies found that
diversity in the methodologies and participant samples was
evident.35 Although around half of the studies (8/15) reported a
statistically significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or
depression after mindfulness-based therapy, none included an
active control group. The authors of the 2007 review concluded
that increased emphasis on research designs with active control
groups would be necessary in future studies to assess the unique
effect of mindfulness-based therapies compared with other types
of therapies. In addition, recent studies of mindfulness-based
programmes have concluded that further studies using an RCT
design are warranted.36

 Sundquist et al
Examples of previous studies include a study of 56 adults in
the USA that found that MBSR treatment was associated with
reductions in social anxiety and depression and an increase in
subjective well-being.37 A Norwegian study of 76 people, recruited
through a newspaper advertisement, randomised participants to
an MBSR programme or a waiting-list control group. Treatment
completers showed medium to large effect sizes on measures of
anxiety and a large effect size on symptoms of depression. The
authors concluded that MBSR is an effective treatment for anxiety
disorders and related symptomatology.38 A Danish clinical trial
used
a
structured
8-week
group-based
mindfulness-based
programme on 336 women who had been operated on for breast
cancer.39 The 8-week intervention had statistically significant
and clinically meaningful effects on depression and anxiety at
follow-up, and medium to large effect sizes.
Limitations
The present study has some limitations. Although immigrants
were included in the RCT, those who could not speak Swedish
fluently were not invited to participate. In a country like Sweden,
with a large proportion of immigrants, it would have been a better
approach to include non-Swedish-speaking immigrants as well.
However, as the Swedish immigrant population is very hetero-
geneous, it would not have been feasible to conduct a reliable
study of the many different immigrant groups in Sweden within
the scope of the present study. Another limitation is that we
included patients with depressive as well as anxiety disorders.
However, overlapping symptoms are relatively common among
these conditions and our approach is in line with previous studies.
The drop-out rate among those individuals who started treatment
was 17.8% (18/101) and 9.5% (9/95) in the mindfulness and
control groups, respectively. High drop-out rates could affect the
generalisability of findings but we have no reason to believe that
the drop-out rate was higher in the present study than in previous
evaluations
of
different
psychotherapies.
There were
slight
differences in baseline scores for MADRS-S and HADS-D between
the mindfulness and control groups. However, these differences
were most likely random and relatively small and should not
have affected our results, adjusted for baseline scores, to a large
extent. The follow-up was relatively short and included an
assessment of symptoms immediately after the 8-week inter-
vention, which means that we cannot judge whether the
improvement of symptoms will remain if the follow-up is longer.
Finally, we had no access to treatment data from non-participating
general practices and previous research from the UK has shown
that there are variations in, for example, psychotropic prescribing
by GPs. However, a study from the UK found that demographic
factors were more powerful determinants of prescribing than
characteristics of the practice itself,40 which indicates that
differences between practices should have a smaller impact than
individual demographic factors on potential variation between
practices. The limitations of the present study are, however,
balanced by the many strengths. For example, the use of an
RCT with an active control group is a major main contribution
to this relatively under-researched field. Moreover, our study of
215 randomised patients with a medical diagnosis was performed
in a monitored clinical setting of 16 general practices in urban as
well as rural areas. Although this study was not designed to
examine whether those who had undergone 6–8 mindfulness
sessions had larger median changes v. those who had undergone
only 1–5 mindfulness sessions, the results suggest that future
studies could examine a possible dose–response relationship in a
larger sample.
Implications
Patients who receive antidepressants have a reported remission
rate of only 35–40%.41 Additional treatment is therefore needed
for non-responders as well as for those who are either unable or
unwilling to engage in traditional psychotherapy. The findings
of the present study therefore have several potential clinical
implications and may be used in primary care patients with
depressive, anxiety, or stress and adjustment disorders. Another
important clinical implication is that certified instructors, that
do not necessarily need to be psychologists or counsellors, can give
mindfulness-based therapy to a group of patients with psychiatric
symptoms common in primary care. We would also like to stress
that CBT therapists are in short supply and that a stronger focus
on group therapy given by certified instructors could help to save
limited resources. However, it is important to note that not all
patients are suited to participate in group sessions and it is thus
important to offer an individual therapeutic approach to these
patients. The present RCT provided evidence that mindfulness
group therapy given by certified instructors is non-inferior to
individual-based CBT. Future studies in other settings could
provide more evidence on whether such an approach can
provide effective treatment to a larger number of patients in a
cost-effective manner.
