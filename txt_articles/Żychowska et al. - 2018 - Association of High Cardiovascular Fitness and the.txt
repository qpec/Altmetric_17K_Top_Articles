This study aimed to compare changes in genes expression associated with inflammation and apoptosis in response to heat stress
caused by sauna between people with varying cardiorespiratory fitness levels. We hypothesis that high cardiorespiratory level caused
higher positive changes after four weeks of sauna bathing. Blood samples were taken at rest before and after the first and last sauna
sessions and 48 hours after the last sauna session and used to assay HSP70 (HSPA1A), HSP27 (HSPB1), interleukin 6 (IL6), and
interleukin 10 (IL10) genes expression in blood with quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Overall, small decreases in rest values of
HSPA1A and IL6 mRNA, increase in HSPB1 mRNA, and a significant increase in IL10 mRNA were observed after four weeks of
exposure to heat stress. Our findings suggest that an adaptive response to heat stress (an anti-inflammatory response) occurs faster
in people with higher cardiorespiratory fitness.
1. Introduction
Finnish sauna bathing is a very popular and easily accessible
wellness treatment in sports, recreation, and rehabilitation.
The effects of sauna bathing can be positive or negative,
depending on many factors, for example, differences in
physical condition, disease status, and external conditions.
Sauna bathing has been observed to influence skeletal muscle
[1], reduce oxidative stress [2], activate secretion of adreno-
corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol in young women
[3], stimulate the immune system [4], affect genes expression
[5, 6], and impact the functionality of other organs (e.g.,
reducing the viability of sperm cells) [7].
The physiological systems most impacted by sauna ses-
sions are the skin and the thermoregulatory and cardiovas-
cular systems [8]. Despite a normal strong response of the
thermoregulatory system, involving an increased production
of sweat, internal body temperature typically increases during
a dry sauna. Overheating and dehydration are stressors
that activate homeostatic mechanisms, such as the increased
expression of stress-related genes at the molecular level.
Stress-related genes can be overexpressed, especially those
associated with apoptosis and the degradation of damaged
and denatured proteins, such as Hsp70 (HSPA1A) or Hsp27
(HSPB1) [9, 10]. These two genes are commonly induced by
physiological stress [11–14]. Recently, in the literature there

are some studies in which impact of sauna bathing on the
human body was investigated in active and sedentary people
on transcriptional level [5, 6]. Cited studies showed that IL6
mRNA and CRP mRNA were higher in people with lower car-
diorespiratory fitness after single sauna session [5]. Moreover,
sauna can cause higher changes in genes expression (HSPA1A,
HSPB1, IL6, or IL10 mRNA) than moderate exercise [6].
Repeated thermal stress can induce thermos tolerance at
the cellular level and that is important for health and phys-
iological possibilities and translates into efficiency in work
performed at high temperatures. So we investigated the adap-
tive effect of four weeks of sauna bathing on the expression of
the genes HSPA1A, HSPB1, IL6, and IL10. Expression of the
genes coding for heat shock proteins (HSPA1A and HSPB1)
and interleukins (IL6 and IL10) is particularly interesting in
sports medicine because these genes appear to have the effect
of increasing exercise tolerance [6]. We hypothesized that
the adaptive effect of total body exposure to the heat stress
associated with sauna sessions would vary as a function of the
physical condition of the experimental subjects. Specifically,
we hypothesized that the sauna-induced increases in the
expression of the genes mentioned above would be higher in
nonathletes than athletes and any adaptive effect would
appear earlier because of the cellular thermotolerance athletes
acquire during physical training. Then people with higher
cardiorespiratory system easier tolerate work in high temper-
atures.
As the type of training may affect gene expression [15], we
chose to study athletes playing the same sport. We therefore
monitored footballers, who we considered the experimental
group, and sedentary people, who were considered to be
the control group. In our opinion, differences in responses
between groups for sauna bathing may be similar to those
obtained by physical exertion [6]. Therefore we hypothesized
that the upregulation of anti-inflammatory rather than proin-
flammatory interleukins would be faster in people with
higher cardiorespiratory fitness.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Ethics Statement. The study was approved by the
Bioethics Committee for Clinical Research at the Regional
Medical Chamber in Gda´
nsk (KB14/14). The authors were
obliged to respect the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.
All participants gave written, informed consent to participate
in the study and could withdraw consent at any time for any
reason.
2.2. Participants. Twenty-two healthy men participated in
the experiment: eleven athletes playing football (average
career length was 8 years) and eleven nonathletes. No signif-
icant differences between the groups’ body mass, BMI, and
body height were found (Table 1).
Athletes trained for 2 sessions per day, 6 days per week
(25–28 hours). Control group participants reported recre-
ational physical activity such as running, swimming, or team
sports maximum 2 times a week, for a duration of 45 minutes
per session. All subjects had a normal health status during the
two months prior to the study (no drugs, alcohol, nicotine,
negative medical history for injures, and situations that may
influence the results).
2.3. Study Design. Participants avoided use of a sauna and
intensive sunbathing for a month before the experiment and
during the time of experiment (beyond the impact of the
experiment). The experiment was performed in January dur-
ing a break in training and competitive football for the ath-
letes; participants in the control group reported average levels
of spontaneous physical activity during the study period (on
average 2 sessions per week). Athletes and the control group
participated in a dry sauna bath 3 times a week, for 4 weeks.
Participants spent time in a Finnish sauna room at 98.2∘C and
10 ± 2% humidity; the time was comprised of two 15-minute
stints during the same session (total time: 30 min per session)
with a 5-minute break for cooling under the shower (water
temperature was 18±2∘C). Before and after each session in the
sauna, weight and percent body fat were measured using an
InBody 720 Segmental Body Composition Analyser, Biospace
(Korea).
2.4. RNA Extraction, qRT–PCR. Two millimeters of venous
blood was collected five times: sample (1) was taken imme-
diately before the first sauna, sample (2) 15 minutes after the
first sauna, sample (3) immediately before the twelfth sauna,
sample (4) 15 minutes after the twelfth sauna, and sample (5)
48 hours after the twelfth sauna. The samples were processed
immediately after each collection. Erythrocytes were lysed
using RBCL buffer according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). The remaining
white blood cells were lysed using Fenozol according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia,
Poland). Isolation of total RNA was carried out by a chemical
method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi [16]. Purity
and concentration of the isolated RNA were determined by
spectrophotometry (Eppendorf, BioPhotometer Plus, Ger-
many). cDNA synthesis from 2 micrograms of total RNA
was performed with a TranscriptMe Kit, using oligo dT and
random hexamers (Blirt, Gda´
nsk, Poland).

Determine Gene Expression. For the analysis of gene expres-
sion, real-time PCR (LightCycler 480II, Roche, Poland) was

twice performed in triplicate for each sample using Light-
Cycler polymerase (Roche, Poland). The temperature-time
protocol of each reaction was programmed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For each reaction, melting curve
analysis was performed. The B-tubulin (TUBB) was used as a
reference gene. Primer sequences are shown in Table 2.
2.6. Statistical Analysis. The data were collected and relative
gene expressions were analysed in Excel 2005. In order to
calculate the level of gene expression, the comparative 𝐶𝑇
method of Schmittgen and Livak [17] was used. The results
are expressed as mean 𝐶𝑇 values and standard deviations. The
data were transformed to linear values and to assess statistical
significance, the following tests were used: normal distribu-
tion was checked with the Shapiro-Wilk’s test, and the non-
parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare results before
and after the sauna baths. To determine the significance
of differences between the groups, a one way ANOVA was
applied. All calculations and graphics were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 (ftx.pl/program/graphpad-prism). Sta-
tistically significant differences were considered at a level of
𝑝 ≤ 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Changes in Somatic Indicators and Dehydration. Small
changes of body weight and percent body fat were observed
before and after four weeks of sauna sessions in both groups:
the mean weight of the group of athletes decreased from
72.26±2.4 kg to 71.78±3.8 kg (a decline of 0.48 kg), while the
mean weight of the nonathletes decreased from 77.6 ± 5.7 to
77.3 ± 5.5 kg (a decline of 0.3 kg). Weight change due to
dehydration during a single session in the sauna ranged from
0.42 to 1.1 kg. There were no significant differences either
within or between groups in terms of loss of body mass,
dehydration, or duration of their stay in the sauna.
3.2. Genes Expression. Rest value of HSPA1A mRNA was
slightly higher in sedentary people before saunas (first and
last) and after first sauna bathing, contrary to HSPB1 mRNA
(higher before and after first sauna bathing and significantly
lower before and after last sauna bathing, Figures 1(a) and
1(b)). Changes in relative expression of HSPB1 mRNA were
from 2∧0.2 before last sauna to 2∧0.24 after last sauna in
control group and 2∧0.04 before last sauna to 2∧0.08 after last
sauna in athletes (𝑝 = 0.004). Changes in IL6 mRNA caused
by first and last sauna bathing were lower in athletes while in
IL10 mRNA they were significantly higher at the same time,
significantly after last sauna bathing (2∧0.11 in control and
2∧0.25 in athletes, 𝑝 = 0.04, Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).
Adaptation to heat stress was determined by comparison
rest value before first sauna bathing and 48 h after last
sauna bathing and results as 2∧-fold changes are presented
at Figure 2.
Decreases in the expression of HSPA1A and IL6 mRNA in
response to heat stress were observed after four weeks of
sauna sessions in both groups, while expressions of IL10
mRNA in athletes significantly increased in the time span
and were 2∧2.04-fold in athletes and 2∧1.27-fold in sedentary
people, 𝑝 = 0.04. For HSPA1A mRNA, decreases in 2∧-
fold changes were slightly higher in athletes (to 2∧0.6-fold
in athletes and to 2∧0.85-fold in sedentary people). For
all genes tested, similar adaptive effects were reported for
each individual group. The differences in response in genes
expression obtained after first and last (12) sauna sessions are
presented at Figure 3.
No changes in delta 2∧-fold changes (2∧-fold changes
after first sauna/2∧-fold changes after last sauna) in HSPA1A
were observed in both groups, while increases in HSPB1,
IL6, and IL10 mRNA were seen. Changes in response in IL6
mRNA after the last sauna compared to the first one differed
between groups and were 2∧1.44-fold in athletes and 2∧1.26-
fold in sedentary people, while in IL10 mRNA they were
2∧2.14-fold in athletes and 2∧1.28-fold in sedentary people.
The differences between groups in delta 2∧x-fold changes
were not significant (ANOVA one way).
4. Discussion
There are a number of studies examining the effect of high
temperature on gene expression, but we are not aware of in
vivo investigations of mRNA levels of stress-related genes
after sauna bathing. Furthermore, little has been reported on
the impact of physical activity on the molecular response of
leukocytes to the same stressor. The small differences in
expression seen in this study occurred between a sample
taken at rest before and 48 hours after a course of 12 sauna
baths. Four weeks of sauna sessions caused a significant
increase in IL10 mRNA in people with high cardiorespiratory
fitness. In our studies faster adaptation to heat was observed
in active people.
Stress-related genes are overexpressed after exercise, as
shown by Neubauer et al. [18], B¨
uttner et al. [19] and Radom-
Aizik et al. [20], Rasmus et al. [21], and Szołtysek et al. [22].
Regardless of the stressor, a cellular response involves several
hundred stress genes, including production of heat shock
proteins or interleukins [23, 24]. Increased expression of
genes encoding anti-inflammatory interleukins like IL10 can
result in lower expression of IL6 mRNA, important indicators
of inflammation. Four weeks of sauna bathing caused a
decrease in rest value of IL6 mRNA (not significant) and
an increase in IL10 mRNA (significant in active people).
Stimulation of the synthesis of heat shock proteins and
interleukins in leukocytes in response to stressors including
temperature was studied by Pizurki and Polla [25] and
Jacquier-Sarlin et al. [26]. Using in vitro study of leukocytes,
these authors found that increasing the temperature to 41∘C

caused a 10-fold increase in HSPs [25, 26]. The aim of our
study was to determine adaptive effect to heat stress, but our
results were not this high. This difference confirms the sub-
stantial differences between in vivo and in vitro testing [27].
However, repeated heat stress caused an visible increase in
the expression of HSPB1 mRNA at rest value and after 12
sauna baths compared to the first sauna bath and decrease
expression of HSPA1A and IL6 mRNA at rest value (Figures
2 and 3). By analysing changes in the expression of HSPB1,
IL6, and IL10 mRNA, it can be seen that a four-week course
of whole body exposure to high temperature caused slightly
higher expression of these genes in response to the last saunas
compared to the first one. Changes in rest value showed
decrease in HSPA1A and IL6 mRNA and increase in HSPB1
and IL10 mRNA, measured before experiment and 48 hours
after last sauna session. The same thermal load caused in the
similar direction of changes occurred faster in people with
higher cardiorespiratory fitness. It is possible that adaptive
effect to heat stress occurs faster in physically active people.
Based on our results, we suggest that the adaptation of
regulation of genes associated with apoptosis and the immune
response to heat stress may be associated with level of physical
activity. Furthermore, the changes achieved in our groups
after four weeks of overheating consisting of decrease in
proinflammatory and increase in anti-inflammatory genes
expression indicated positive impact on health (more pro-
nounced in athletes). This is an important conclusion for
planning biological regeneration and for people who work in
