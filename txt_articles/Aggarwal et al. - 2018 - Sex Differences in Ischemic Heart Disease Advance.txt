ABSTRACT: Evolving knowledge of sex-specific presentations, improved 
recognition of conventional and novel risk factors, and expanded 
understanding of the sex-specific pathophysiology of ischemic heart 
disease have resulted in improved clinical outcomes in women. Yet, 
ischemic heart disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality in women in the United States. The important publication 
by the Institute of Medicine titled “Women’s Health Research—Progress, 
Pitfalls, and Promise,” highlights the persistent disparities in cardiovascular 
disease burden among subgroups of women, particularly women who 
are socially disadvantaged because of race, ethnicity, income level, 
and educational attainment. These important health disparities reflect 
underrepresentation of women in research, with the resultant unfavorable 
impact on diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies in women at 
risk for cardiovascular disease. Causes of disparities are multifactorial 
and related to differences in risk factor prevalence, access to care, use of 
evidence-based guidelines, and social and environmental factors. Lack of 
awareness in both the public and medical community, as well as existing 
knowledge gap regarding sex-specific differences in presentation, risk 
factors, pathophysiology, and response to treatment for ischemic heart 
disease, further contribute to outcome disparities. There is a critical need 
for implementation of sex- and gender-specific strategies to improve 
cardiovascular outcomes. This review is tailored to meet the needs of a 
busy clinician and summarizes the contemporary trends, characterizes 
current sex-specific outcome disparities, delineates challenges, and 
proposes transformative solutions for improvement of the full spectrum of 
ischemic heart disease clinical care and research in women.

I
schemic heart disease (IHD) represents the leading 
cause of death in women. It accounts for a third of 
all female deaths globally and affects nearly 48 mil-
lion women in the United States.1,2 The landmark 2010 
Institute of Medicine’s publication, “Women’s Health 
Research—Progress, Pitfalls, and Promise,” highlights 
the fact that women’s health involves 2 aspects: (1) sex 
differences because of the biological factors and (2) 
gender differences, those affected by broader social, 
environmental, and community factors.3 The emphasis 
on sex- and gender-specific cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
research and our improved understanding of sex-specific 
pathophysiology for coronary atherosclerosis in  
women 
have resulted in important insights into an expanded 
spectrum of IHD in women to include obstructive coro-
nary artery disease as well as dysfunction of the coro-
nary microvasculature and endothelium.4 The focus on 
sex and gender research in CVD has resulted in a nearly 
30% decline in the number of women dying from CVD, 
and for the first time, in 2014, more men than women 
died of CVD in the United States since 1984.2 The de-
creased mortality rate, specifically because of IHD, has 
been attributed to increased awareness, greater focus 
on women and their IHD risk, and the application of 
evidence-based treatments for established IHD.2,5 De-
spite this progress, women with IHD experience relative-

ly worse outcomes compared with men, and younger 
women (<55 years) and subgroups of women defined 
by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and educa-
tional level still show striking disparities in cardiovas-
cular health (Figure 1).6,7 These disparities reflect our 
limited understanding of the sex differences in physi-
ology, which is substantially related to lack of female-
specific data.8 An expanded view of the multifactorial 
epidemiology of IHD in women has identified important 
risk factors, including age, race, culture, ethnicity, and 
lifestyle influences that adversely impact cardiovascular 
outcomes.5 This review, customized to meet the needs 
of a busy clinician, highlights the contemporary data on 
sex-specific differences in traditional and novel risk fac-
tors, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and man-
agement of the full spectrum of IHD in women, includ-
ing acute myocardial infarction (MI), chronic epicardial 
stenosis, and microvascular and endothelial dysfunction. 
It summarizes the underlying biological differences in 
IHD, sex- and gender-based disparity in outcomes, and 
contemporary challenges for equitable health care and 
proposes transformative solutions for improvement of 
clinical care and research in women.
UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL 
DIFFERENCES IN ISCHEMIC HEART 
DISEASE
Biological sex and socio-cultural gender are often indis-
tinguishably coupled together. Contemporary research 
highlights the impact of these variables on many 
observed sex-differences in presentation, natural  
history, 
pathophysiology, diagnosis, and outcomes of IHD.9–11  
While men and women share many traditional risk 
factors for IHD, additional sex-based risk factors and 
mechanisms of disease have been shown to be impor-
tant in women.12–14 Menopause marks an important 
cardiovascular biological transition, with a significant-
ly increased CVD risk in women aged ≥55 years, and 
equals the risk of men aged ≥45 years. Estrogen loss 
seems to have a negative effect on arterial function and 
adversely alters the cholesterol profile.15 Menopause 
increases the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and 
truncal obesity.16 Early menopause, whether natural 
or surgically induced, significantly increases a woman’s 
risk for IHD.16 Sex differences in risk factors, presenta-
tion, and pathophysiology of IHD are listed.
Risk Factors
There is increasing evidence that biological differences 
may impact the expression of cardiovascular risk factors 
and impart a differential risk for women compared with 
men (Figure 2). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and 
smoking are more potent risk factors for MI in women 
than in men, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.5, 1.6, and 
1.3, respectively.17 Additionally, there are several non-
traditional cardiac risks unique to or predominant in 
women, including early menopause or menarche, ges-
tational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, preeclampsia 
and eclampsia during pregnancy, and systemic inflam-
matory disorders (Figure 2).18–21 The 2013 American Col-
lege of Cardiology/American Heart Association (AHA) 
guidelines on assessment of CVD risk recommend the 
use of ASCVD risk calculator, which accounts for sex 
and ethnic diversity but not the emerging risk factors 
prevalent in women.22
Presentation
Differences exist in the presentation of IHD in women 
compared with men. Fewer women present with the 
classic symptoms of chest pain (31% compared with 
42% men), particularly in young patients.23,24 Women 
often exhibit dyspnea, weakness, arm, back or jaw 
pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or loss of appe-
tite.23,24 The historic limited interpretation of women’s 
symptoms based on the traditional approaches such 
as the Diamond and Forrester risk model results from 
under-recognition of the sex-specific presentation of 
IHD and contributes to misdiagnosis and delayed rec-
ognition of ischemia.25–28
Pathophysiology
The distribution and burden of coronary plaque differs 
by sex, with nearly 60% of symptomatic women having 
no flow-limiting stenosis.4,15,29,30 Emerging data have 
significantly contributed to our understanding of the 
full spectrum of IHD in women, which includes obstruc-
tive epicardial disease, microvascular disease, coronary 
spasm, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection. 
The role of microvascular dysfunction, vascular inflam-
mation, coronary reactivity, endothelial function, hor-
monal influences, oxidative stress, and coronary size on 
the development of IHD in women is being increasingly 
recognized.4,31 Similarly, there are pathophysiologic dif-
ferences in MI, with women having a higher prevalence 
of plaque erosion compared with more plaque rupture 
in men.31 These observations support a need for an 
in-depth and integrated understanding of the factors 
accounting for the varying mechanisms and presenta-
tion of IHD in women.
SEX-SPECIFIC ROLE OF DIAGNOSTIC 
IMAGING
Vascular dysfunction in absence of obstructive coronary 
disease is more prevalent in women and associated with 
increased use of healthcare resources, higher symptom 
burden, and importantly a 2-fold higher mortality, indi-

cating that nonobstructive disease is not benign.4,31–33 
Among 10 
003 subjects with stable angina and inter-
mediate probability of atherosclerosis in the The Pro-
spective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of 
Chest Pain trial, women were less likely to have posi-
tive stress tests.34 The higher burden of nonobstructive 
atherosclerosis in women may result in negative stress 
tests and obscure the diagnosis of IHD, underscoring 
the need for additional diagnostic imaging that reveals 
the nonobstructive pathophysiological mechanisms of 
IHD.30,35 Consequently, the 2014 AHA consensus state-
ment for noninvasive evaluation of woman at risk for 
IHD recommends testing for the full spectrum of IHD 
(Figure 3).35 Contemporary cardiac imaging techniques

include detecting the extent and severity of myocardial 
ischemia resulting from obstructive coronary artery dis-
ease, visualizing the nonobstructive plaque burden on 
coronary computed tomography, and evaluating small 
vessel disease by use of myocardial perfusion coronary 
flow reserve (positron emission tomography and stress 
magnetic resonance imaging).36 Guidelines for diagnosis 
and management of symptomatic women with suspect-
ed IHD comprise both the determination of a woman’s 
risk status for IHD (including a pretest evaluation based 
on AHA guidelines) and shared decision-making regard-
ing the need for and choice of diagnostic testing.35
SEX-BASED DISPARITIES IN 
OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF CARE
A growing body of evidence supports a lack of recogni-
tion, inadequate medical resource utilization, and sub-
optimal application of evidence-based guidelines as fac-
tors resulting in higher case fatality rates among women 
with IHD (Table 1).12,37 Women with IHD use more cardi-
ac resources and incur greater healthcare costs because 
of greater symptom burden, frequent office visits, and 
hospitalizations.31,62 Subgroups of women who experi-
ence worse outcomes for IHD include younger women 
(aged <55 years) and those of Black, Latino, and South 
Asian descent.2,7
Higher Morbidity and Mortality
Although the mortality of IHD in women has sharply 
declined over the last 4 decades, sex-based differences in 
outcomes persist (Table 1). Paradoxically, women present-
ing with acute coronary syndrome have less obstructive 
disease but exhibit higher in-hospital (OR, 1.85) and 1-year 
(OR, 1.6) mortality compared with men.59–61 Additionally, 
women also experience a higher incidence of cardiogenic 
shock (5.8% versus 4.0%) and heart failure (5.8% versus 
3.4%) compared with men (Figure 1).2,39,63 These differ-
ences in outcome were ameliorated after adjusting for 
baseline comorbidities. These disparate outcomes are 
potentially caused by a combination of less-intensive 
hospital and postdischarge care44,48,64 and underlying bio-
logical differences in response to pharmacological and 
reperfusion therapies. Similar trends are noted in sex-
specific outcomes of nonobstructive IHD, which is now 
recognized to be far from benign, and associated with 
recurrent angina, and frequent cardiac events compared 
with women with normal coronaries (Table 1).65,66
Delayed Presentation
Recognizing the delays in door-to-balloon time and its 
association with decreased likelihood of survival in patients 
with an acute ST-segment–elevation MI, the American 
College of Cardiology and AHA launched the door-to-
balloon alliance in 2006 and partnered with hospitals, 
medical personnel, third-party payers, and hospital qual-
ity alliance to standardize systemic approaches for time-
liness of percutaneous coronary intervention.67 However, 
a decade later, significant disparities persist in timeliness 
of revascularization, with women experiencing longer 
median first medical contact-to-device times (80 versus 
75 minutes; P<0.001) and a lower propensity to achieve 
the recommended contact-to-device times ≤90 minutes 
target than men (67.5% versus 75.6%; P<0.001).39 
This delay was secondary to differences in both prehos-
pital presentation times and in getting crucial admission 
procedures, with longest delays in young women (aged 
18–55 years).39,41 These findings underscore the need for 
improved symptom recognition and triage strategies used 
by first responders, particularly in young women.
Fewer Revascularization
Despite the proven efficacy of revascularization, wom-
en are less likely than men to be referred for revascu-
larization for ST-segment–elevation MI,41 non–ST-seg-
ment–elevation MI,42 and stable angina (Table 1).44 This 
inequality in referral was more profound in younger 
women6,41,44 and might be explained by increased tech-
nical complexity related to smaller coronary arteries,68 
less obstructive coronary plaque,29 and a perceived high-
er rate of postprocedural complications in women.48 
Studies have demonstrated a higher rate of in-hospital 
complications after percutaneous and surgical revascu-
larization and higher rates of bleeding in women. These 
sex differences in clinical outcomes were resolved after 
adjusting for the higher prevalence of comorbidities, 
smaller body habitus, and lower renal function seen 
in women compared with those in men.42,69–71 Further-
more, most women are diagnosed with IHD later than 
men, and have more comorbidities resulting in a higher 
surgical risk profile, which may preclude them from get-
ting surgical revascularization.72
Less Cardiac Rehabilitation
Despite documented benefits and corresponding Amer-
ican College of Cardiology/AHA recommendation for 
cardiac rehabilitation post-MI, women are substantially 
less likely to be referred and participate in cardiac reha-
bilitation compared with men.53,54,73 Sex-based attrition 
occurs at each step of cardiac rehabilitation: referral, 
enrollment, and adherence (Table 1). Potential barriers 
for suboptimal enrollment of women in cardiac rehabili-
tation included inadequate reinforcement by healthcare 
professionals, financial constraints, inadequate patient 
awareness, perception of exercise being painful, subop-
timal social support system, transportation issues, fam-
ily responsibilities, and higher comorbidities.73

Less Intense Pharmacotherapy
Since the release of AHA’s first women-specific clini-
cal recommendations for the prevention of CVD in 
1999,74 with growing sex-specific CVD knowledge, 4 
sets of guidelines and statements exclusively focused 
on CVD in women have now been published.14,35,75,76 
The efficacy of aspirin, statins, and β-blockers for sec-
ondary prevention are equally established in both men 
and women and endorsed by guidelines.14,77 Addition-
ally, data from Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation 
(WISE) Study demonstrated that angiotensin-convert-
ing enzyme inhibitors improved coronary flow reserve 
and angina symptoms in women with microvascu-
lar coronary disease.78 Despite documented efficacy 
and guideline endorsement, women are less likely to 
receive guideline-based primary and secondary preven-
tion. Women are less likely than men to have their car-
diac risks assessed, with the majority not adhering to 
appropriate primary prevention guidelines and instead 
resorting to nonevidence-based therapies.45,46,79 Simi-
larly, EUROASPIRE III and IV surveys demonstrated that 
despite the higher burden of comorbidities at time of 
presentation of MI, women are less likely to receive 
recommended pharmacotherapies (Figure 4)47,48 and 
less likely to achieve secondary prevention targets for 
hyperlipidemia (OR, 0.5), hyperglycemia (OR 0.78), 
physical activity (OR, 0.74), or body mass index (OR, 
0.82).47,51,52 These disparities are most prominent in 
Black women, the majority of whom have ≥3 tradi-
tional risk factors and yet are significantly less likely to 
receive appropriate secondary prevention compared 
with age-matched White women after hospitaliza-
tion for MI.49 Decreased adherence was present in the 
Medicare claims data with a 30% to 35% lower likeli-
hood of medication adherence in Black and Hispanic 
women 12 months post-MI. This decreased adherence 
was postulated to be secondary to lack of social sup-
port, community resources, cognitive deficiencies, and 
physician follow-up.50 Disparities in medication pre-
scription and adherence might explain the sex differ-
ences for suboptimal outcomes post-MI.
SUBGROUPS WITH HIGHER DISPARITY 
IN OUTCOMES
The improved mortality from IHD in women conceals sig-
nificant disparities across subsets of population, particular-
ly in racial minorities and young women. The age-adjusted 
death rate for IHD was highest in Black women (89 per 
100 
000 compared with 72 per 100 
000 in White wom-
en; Figure 1).2 South Asian women also exhibit a greater 
prevalence of severe and extensive coronary artery disease 
compared with those of European and Chinese descent.7
Analysis of temporal trends is notable for decelera-
tion in the rate of decline of IHD death in young women 
(<55 years) in the United States (annual percent decline 
of −1.9% in women versus −2.8% in age-matched 
men).80 Two large prospective trials focused on young 
women with acute MI [VIRGO (Variation in recovery: 
Role of gender on outcomes of young acute myocardial 
infarction patients) and GENESIS-PRAXY (GENdEr and 
Sex determInantS of cardiovascular disease: From bench 
to beyond-Premature Acute Coronary Syndrome)] 
showed that these women were less likely to receive 
perfusion therapy, be referred for cardiac rehabilitation, 
experienced more angina and depression, had higher 
mortality, had worse quality of life, and were less likely 
to return to work at 12 months.6,11,57
CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES 
AND SOLUTIONS FOR EQUITABLE 
HEALTHCARE FOR WOMEN
Public Awareness
Since the launch of the Red Dress Campaign, dedicated 
to increasing recognition of CVD in women, awareness 
of IHD as the leading cause of death in women has ris-
en from 30% to 56%.79 Awareness, however, has pla-
teaued as the most recent survey demonstrated nearly 
45% of women are still unaware of IHD being the lead-
ing cause of death, with even lower awareness rates in 
women with lesser education, low income, and racial

and ethnic minorities.13 Most women did not recognize 
the typical risk factors for IHD. Although most women 
had ≥3 risk factors, only 52% considered themselves at 
risk at the time of their index MI (Figure 5).26 To date, 
there is suboptimal recognition of the atypical pre-
sentation of MI in women.13 Of concern, even when 
the symptoms were recognized, only half would seek 
medical attention.13,79 Given the perceived social stigma 
and anxiety associated with CVD, 63% put off visiting 
their physician.13 Potential barriers to healthcare aver-
sion include social stigma regarding body weight, care-
taking responsibilities, inadequate financial resources, 
limited personal confidence, and insufficient time.79
Improved awareness of risk for IHD are paramount 
for improving outcomes in women. Public education 
campaigns and tailored social media messages need 
to include young women and minorities. Collaboration 
between local faith–based organizations, local gyms, 
schools, community leaders, and work-place wellness 
sites to engender heart-healthy behaviors, improved 
health literacy, and improved adherence to lifestyle-
based primary prevention in a manner that is culturally 
acceptable, affordable, and readily accessible may be 
helpful. Expanding the partnership to include patient-
centered organizations, like WomenHeart,81 to identify 
female IHD survivors from lower socioeconomic sta-
tus and ethnic and racial minorities, who understand 
the challenges of their communities and can serve as 
community leaders, liaisons, and media spokeswomen 
may help reduce sex disparities in outcomes. Reduc-
ing the social stigma of IHD and integrating the tenets 
of health literacy and affordable heart-healthy lifestyle 
choices with cultural awareness are pivotal for improv-
ing IHD care.
Use of Sex- and Gender-Specific 
Guidelines
Inadequate recognition of the full spectrum of IHD in 
women by the medical community continues to be a bar-
rier. In a recent survey, only 22% of primary care physi-
cians and 42% of cardiologists felt adequately prepared 
to assess women’s cardiovascular risk.13 Nearly 70% of 
postgraduate trainees report insufficient discussion of 
sex-based medical concepts in their training.82 Integra-
tion of a formal sex-based cardiovascular curriculum in 
medical, nursing, public health and pharmacy schools, 
and residencies and fellowships is needed for integra-
tion of guidelines into day-to-day practice. Case-based 
learning modules can effectively promote cultural aware-
ness and expose learners to the unique challenges of 
delivering care to women. Fostering a partnership with 
healthcare teams that are most in contact with wom-
en—Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Women’s 
Health and Emergency Department—may enhance the 
delivery of guideline-directed care for women.83 Inclusion 
of credentialing policies that mandate continuing medi-
cal education credits devoted to detection and manage-
ment of IHD in women, along with the promotion of 
sex- and gender-based modules in scientific meetings, 
will further promote medical awareness.
The identification of at-risk women is presently sub-
standard. Increasing the utilization of the ASCVD Risk 
Calculator for female patients, currently used by only 
44% primary care physicians and 53% cardiologists, 
would be helpful.13 A multidisciplinary team approach to 
treatment with improved inclusion of advanced practice 
providers has demonstrable effectiveness with improved 
risk factor modification, medication adherence, and

implementation of guidelines.84 Systematic approaches 
such as automated referral for cardiac rehabilitation or 
computerized physician reminders for diagnostic and 
therapeutic considerations when patients meet criteria 
will likely increase adherence to guidelines.
Inclusion of Women in Research
Recognition of sex differences in presentation, patho-
physiology, treatment, and outcomes accentuates the 
need for sex-specific research. Underrepresentation of 
women results in male outcomes being extrapolated to 
females, which does not consider sex and gender dif-
ferences. Despite mandates by the National Institute of 
Health and the major funding body for Europe (Horizon 
2020) on inclusion of women in trials,85,86 women con-
tinue to be grossly underrepresented in IHD trials (only 
34% in 2006).87 Analysis of the 2007 women’s CVD 
prevention guidelines revealed that women comprised 
only 25% of the participants of the 156 IHD trials.87 
Recognizing these disparities, the 2010 report pub-
lished by the Institute of Medicine called for ongoing 
efforts to enhance the inclusion of women in clinical 
trials.3 Ongoing enforcement by federal, industrial, and 
professional regulatory bodies and by journal editors 
for mandatory reporting of adequately powered sex-
based analysis would help. A thorough implementation 
of National Institute of Health mandates that ensure 
transparent and publicly available publication of sex-
specific research data will be key. Novel strategies such 
as oversampling, focused recruitment of women sub-
groups, better incentives for researchers for inclusion 
of women, and social networking-enabled recruitment 
may be beneficial.88
Recognition of Other Important 
Determinants of Health
Beyond the biological differences, gender roles encom-
passing a multifaceted, complex construct of cultural 
norms, psychosocial attributes, and environmental 
factors are increasingly recognized as having a strong 
influence on health-seeking behaviors and outcomes in 
women. In a study of 3500 patients across 24 centers, 
women had a 29% increased likelihood of rehospital-
ization within 1 year after an acute MI compared with 
age-matched men.57 This increased risk of readmission 
was largely attributed to baseline health and psycho-
social factors like perceived social support and stress.57 
Presence of anxiety and depression after a cardiac event 
was strongly associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and 
poor compliance with medications and risk factor mod-
ification.89 Similarly, analysis of risk factors in the INTER-
HEART study (n=29 
972) revealed that psychosocial 
stress was twice as common in women and a more sig-
nificant predictor of risk of future MI (OR, 3.49 versus 
2.58 in men).9,17 Interventions that enhance perceived 
social support, psychosocial factors, and emotional 
state by reassurance, support groups, stress–reduction 
intervention programs, health coaches, church support, 
and psychotropic medications might result in improved 
clinical outcomes.90 Furthermore, women, particularly 
of ethnic minorities, experience a greater demand for 
family caregiving responsibilities, which in turn is asso-
ciated with chronic stress, time constraints for self-care, 
and ultimately poor health outcomes.91 Improved rec-
ognition of barriers to seeking care including time con-
straints, primary caretaker responsibilities, and psycho-
social stress is important. Alternate modes of delivery 
such as telemedicine or web-based approaches that 
offer flexible hours and personalized treatment options 
may be better embraced by women.73
Other gendered determinants of health, including 
access to education and economic opportunities, access 
to community resources and healthcare, social support, 
language and literacy, significantly contribute to differ-
ences in delivery of care for women, particularly racial 
and ethnic minorities.15 These often overlooked factors 
expose patients to unique risks, may restrict access to 
care, and make them vulnerable to worse outcomes. 
Training a more culturally and linguistically competent 
and diverse workforce along with improved awareness 
of unconscious bias, stereotyping, and prejudice by 
healthcare providers may help reverse gender, ethnic, 
and racial disparities prevalent in IHD care.
Dedicated Heart Centers for Women
Most heart centers for women offer a personalized 
approach with a sex- and gender-specific care model 
and address risks that predominantly affect women, 
including pregnancy outcomes, hormonal changes, 
breast cancer therapies, and autoimmune disorders. 
With a multidisciplinary team of clinicians versed in 
cardio-oncology, cardio-rheumatology, pregnancy dis-
orders, and medically, culturally, and linguistically aware 
nursing and allied health professionals, these centers 
can be well positioned to identify at-risk women and 
prevent IHD. In addition, their role reaches beyond pre-
vention by identifying and phenotyping women with 
specific forms of IHD and promoting women-specific 
research.92 They may improve the cardiovascular health 
of women by advancing research and the implementa-
tion of sex- and gender-specific prevention, diagnostic, 
and treatment strategies that can lead to the elimina-
tion of CVD disparities in women.93

Advocacy

makers, and researchers have resulted in landmark

actions which have advanced women’s cardiovascular 
health. An example is the 2014 FDA action plan of 27 
points to enhance the collection and availability of sex-
specific data and development of a new women’s health 
research plan to answer specific sex-specific concerns 
and promote enrollment of a diverse subpopulations.94 
In spite of these recommendations and legislations 
addressing the gaps in sex- and gender-based dispari-
ties in CVD, these are inadequately implemented.95 Pol-
icies supporting the health of women to include access 
to high quality care, and address aspects of financing 
and payment models, must be expanded and adopted. 
These include addressing the social determinants of 
health as barriers to care and the built environment (eg, 
access to safe spaces to exercise) contribute to dispari-
ties and challenges facing women, particularly racial 
and ethnic minorities, immigrants, and those living in 
rural areas.96 Addressing these issues is critical and will 
require policy changes, investments, and collaboration 
among an array of stakeholders.96 These recommenda-
tions made at the 2015 WomenHeart policy and sci-
ence summit should lead to healthier women, families, 
and communities.95 Federal agencies, researchers, clini-
cians, patients, women advocates, and policy makers 
must commit to work together to fully implement and 
expand existing policies (Figure 6).95,97
CONCLUSIONS
Despite dramatic improvements in mortality from IHD 
in women, it continues to be the leading cause of 
death. Sex- and gender-specific disparities in outcome 
persist, particularly, in subsets of women disadvantaged 
by race, ethnicity, income level, and educational attain-
ment. There is a need for improved recognition of the 
unique biological risk factors, differences in patho-
physiology of IHD, and unique challenges of sex- and 
gender-specific delivery of care in women. Increasing 
awareness of the unique aspects of women’s IHD in the 
public and medical community to include the tenets 
of health and cultural literacy and improve adherence 
to prevention, diagnostic, and treatment guidelines 
are instrumental to improving women’s heart health. 
Advancing the focus on sex- and gender-specific CVD 
research beyond conventional biomedical models to 
incorporate the social determinants that affect a wom-
an’s health and establishment of health policies which 
facilitate a sex- and gender-based patient-centered per-
sonalized model will result in equitable IHD outcomes 
and care for women.

Take-Home Points for the Clinician
• Sex-specific risk of traditional and novel risk fac-
tors for ischemic heart disease should be con-
sidered for improved risk stratification of at-risk 
women.
• Diagnostic imaging should evaluate the full spec-
trum of ischemic heart disease and include assess-
ment with stress testing and coronary computed 
tomography for epicardial stenosis and with posi-
tron emission tomography and magnetic reso-
nance imaging for microvascular disease.
• Psychosocial variables, including perceived social 
support, depressive symptoms, and caretaking 
responsibilities, play an important role in influ-
encing health-seeking behaviors and clinical out-
comes in women.
• Increased awareness of ischemic heart disease in 
women, attention to social determinants of health, 
health and cultural literacy, improved adherence 
to sex-specific guidelines, and adequate inclusion 
of women in trials are needed to address the exist-
ing disparities in research and clinical care.
