Daptomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic of last resort for serious infections caused by methicillin-
34 
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)1,2. Although resistance is rare, treatment failure can occur 
35 
in >20% of cases3,4 and so there is a pressing need to identify and mitigate factors that contribute 
36 
to poor therapeutic outcomes. Here, we show that loss of the Agr quorum-sensing system, which 
37 
frequently occurs in clinical isolates, enhances S. aureus survival during daptomycin treatment. 
38 
Wild-type S. aureus was killed rapidly by daptomycin but Agr-defective mutants survived 
39 
antibiotic exposure by releasing membrane phospholipid, which bound and inactivated the 
40 
antibiotic. Although wild-type bacteria also released phospholipid in response to daptomycin, Agr-
41 
triggered secretion of small cytolytic toxins, known as phenol soluble modulins, prevented 
42 
antibiotic inactivation. Phospholipid shedding by S. aureus occurred via an active process and was 
43 
inhibited by the β-lactam antibiotic oxacillin, which slowed inactivation of daptomycin and 
44 
enhanced bacterial killing. In conclusion, S. aureus possesses a transient defence mechanism that 
45 
protects against daptomycin, which can be compromised by Agr-triggered toxin production or an 
46 
existing therapeutic antibiotic.   
47 
S. aureus encodes multiple virulence factors, many of which are controlled by Agr5,6, a 
48 
quorum-sensing system encoded by a 4 gene operon (agrBDCA) and a gene encoding a regulatory 
49 
RNA (RNAIII). However, invasive S. aureus infections often give rise to Agr-defective mutants, 
50 
typically involving agrA or agrC, hypothesised to provide a selective advantage in the presence of 
51 
antibiotics7-14. To test this hypothesis, we determined the killing kinetics of wild-type S. aureus or agr 
52 
mutants by clinically-relevant antibiotics.  
53 
Agr status did not affect the rate of staphylococcal killing by vancomycin, oxacillin or 
54 
gentamicin (Supplementary Fig. 1, 2). By contrast, whilst wild-type S. aureus was killed by 
55 
daptomycin, loss of quorum-sensing components of Agr (AgrA or AgrC) enabled S. aureus strains 
56 
USA300 or SH1000 to survive in the presence of daptomycin during the first 8 hours of exposure (Fig. 
57 
1a,b). A mutant lacking the regulatory RNAIII component of agr was killed as efficiently as the wild-
58 
type (Fig. 1a), as were agrA or agrC mutants complemented with the relevant genes on plasmids 
59 
 3 
 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). After the initial period of killing, CFU counts of both wild-type and agr-
60 
mutant S. aureus recovered to similar levels by 24 h, without the acquisition of resistance, explaining 
61 
why all strains had identical daptomycin MIC and MBC values (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1, 
62 
Supplementary Fig. 4). This biphasic killing and subsequent recovery profile is similar to several 
63 
previously reported daptomycin killing assays, although the contribution of Agr to this phenomenon 
64 
was unknown15-17.  
65 
In addition to agr-deletion mutants, clinical isolates with dysfunctional Agr systems were 
66 
also less susceptible to daptomycin than strains with functional Agr, indicating a potential role in 
67 
treatment failure (Supplementary Fig. 5).To test this, mice were inoculated via the intraperitoneal 
68 
route18 and then treated with daptomycin. Similar to that reported previously19, daptomycin 
69 
treatment reduced the size of the wild-type population 15-fold by 8 h, compared with mice treated 
70 
with PBS alone (Fig. 1d). By contrast, daptomycin did not significantly decrease the size of the ΔagrA 
71 
mutant population (Fig. 1d). Therefore, the loss of Agr activity confers a selective advantage to S. 
72 
aureus during daptomycin exposure, resulting in treatment failure. 
73 
  
Staphylococcal infections are often caused by mixed populations of agr mutants and wild-
74 
type bacteria8,10-12 and we therefore explored how this affected daptomycin susceptibility of the 
75 
whole population. Using various ratios of wild-type and agrA mutant S. aureus, we found that larger 
76 
agr-mutant sub-populations resulted in greater survival of both the Agr-defective strain and the 
77 
wild-type (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 6). Similarly, we found that the presence of the ΔagrA mutant 
78 
in the peritoneal cavity of mice protected wild-type bacteria from daptomycin (Fig. 1f), providing 
79 
additional evidence that agr-mutants can promote daptomycin treatment failure.  
80 
To understand the mechanism by which S. aureus agr mutants survived daptomycin 
81 
exposure we determined the antibiotic activity in spent culture supernatants. After 8 h incubation 
82 
with wild-type USA300, daptomycin activity was reduced 50%, although this was still sufficient for 
83 
bacterial killing (Fig. 1g,h; Supplementary Fig. 7). However, there was a rapid and total loss of 
84 
daptomycin activity in cultures of the ΔagrA mutant and the antibiotic was no longer bactericidal 
85 
 4 
 
(Fig. 1g,h). In keeping with this, culture supernatant from the USA300 ΔagrA mutant exposed to 
86 
daptomycin protected wild-type bacteria from subsequent daptomycin challenge both in vitro and in 
87 
vivo (Supplementary Fig. 8). Similar findings were obtained with S. aureus SH1000, where the agrA 
88 
mutant inactivated daptomycin within 4 h, whereas this did not occur until 8 h in the wild-type 
89 
(Supplementary Fig. 9). These experiments indicated that daptomycin was inactivated by a secreted 
90 
factor, which we confirmed by showing that the supernatant from the ΔagrA mutant exposed to 
91 
daptomycin inactivated a subsequent dose of the antibiotic, whilst supernatant from bacteria not 
92 
exposed to the antibiotic did not (Supplementary Fig. 10).   
93 
To identify the secreted daptomycin inactivator, we examined culture supernatant from the 
94 
ΔagrA mutant and found that its capacity to inactivate the antibiotic was not sensitive to heat or 
95 
proteases, suggesting an enzyme-independent process (Fig. 2a). Daptomycin targets 
96 
phosphatidylglycerol (PG), the most abundant lipid in the staphylococcal membrane, triggering 
97 
membrane blebbing without lysis20- 24. Therefore, we hypothesised that membrane phospholipids 
98 
released into the extracellular space could bind and inactivate daptomycin, as has been 
99 
demonstrated for pulmonary surfactant25. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of ΔagrA culture 
100 
supernatant with phospholipases or Triton X-100 significantly impaired daptomycin inactivation (Fig. 
101 
2a). Analysis of culture supernatants revealed that daptomycin triggered the release of lipid from the 
102 
ΔagrA mutant (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 11) and we confirmed the presence of membrane 
103 
phospholipid via thin-layer chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 12). This identified PG as the most 
104 
abundant lipid species (>65% total phospholipid), along with a small quantity of lysyl-PG (LPG) and 
105 
cardiolipin (CL) (Supplementary table 2; Supplementary Fig. 12). At concentrations similar to those 
106 
found in the culture supernatant, purified PG inactivated daptomycin in a dose-dependent manner 
107 
(Fig. 2c). By contrast, LPG only inhibited daptomycin activity at supraphysiological concentrations, 
108 
and cardiolipin had no effect on the antibiotic (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, a mixture of PG, LPG and CL at 
109 
the approximate ratio found in the membrane24 efficiently inactivated daptomycin (Fig. 2d). In 
110 
keeping with these findings, purified PG, and to a lesser extent LPG, protected S. aureus from 
111 
 5 
 
daptomycin, whilst CL did not (Fig. 2e). Together, these data confirm that released membrane PG 
112 
was responsible for inactivating the antibiotic. 
113 
Next, we investigated whether the presence of phospholipids in the supernatant occurs via 
114 
an active process or was simply a consequence of membrane damage caused by the antibiotic. The 
115 
presence of inhibitors of respiration, protein biosynthesis or lipid biosynthesis significantly reduced 
116 
lipid-release in response to daptomycin, as did reducing the incubation temperature to 4 oC (Fig. 2f). 
117 
By contrast, inhibitors of protein biosynthesis or respiration did not block lipid released from 
118 
bacteria due to damage caused by lysostaphin or high temperature (Supplementary Fig. 13). We 
119 
therefore concluded that lipid released in response to daptomycin occurred via an active 
120 
mechanism.   
121 
Previous work with Escherichia coli suggested that outer membrane vesicles provide 
122 
protection against membrane-targeting antimicrobials26. However, most of the phospholipid 
123 
released by S. aureus existed as monomers or small micelles and although some of the released 
124 
phospholipid was in the form of membrane vesicles, these contained very little daptomycin and 
125 
were inefficient at inactivating the antibiotic (Supplementary Fig. 14).  
126 
We then determined why S. aureus lacking a functional Agr system, but not wild-type, 
127 
inactivated daptomycin. The simplest explanation was that the wild-type did not release lipids in 
128 
response to daptomycin. However, exposure of wild-type S. aureus to daptomycin resulted in 
129 
release of phospholipid at similar levels and composition to the ΔagrA mutant, demonstrating that 
130 
the Agr quorum-sensing system does not influence lipid-release (Supplementary Fig. 12, 14, 15; 
131 
supplementary table 2). Using pull-down assays, we discovered that daptomycin bound to 
132 
phospholipid in culture supernatant from ΔagrA but not wild-type S. aureus (Supplementary Fig. 15). 
133 
Because Agr triggers the secretion of numerous products5,6, we hypothesised that these prevented 
134 
the binding of daptomycin by phospholipid from wild-type bacteria.  In support of this hypothesis, 
135 
we discovered that spent culture supernatant from wild-type bacteria prevented ΔagrA bacteria 
136 
from inactivating daptomycin (Supplementary Fig. 16). Further analysis determined that the agent 
137 
 6 
 
responsible was heat-sensitive and passed through a 3 kDa cut-off filter, indicative of a small peptide 
138 
(Supplementary Fig. 16). AgrA regulates the expression of 7 small peptide cytolysins known as 
139 
phenol soluble modulins (PSMs), categorised into alpha (PSMα1-4) or beta (PSMβ1,2) families27,28. 
140 
Given the surfactant properties of PSMs we hypothesised that they prevented the sequestration of 
141 
daptomycin by phospholipids.  
142 
Mutants in both the USA300 and SH1000 backgrounds lacking PSMα cytolysins inactivated 
143 
daptomycin and survived exposure to the antibiotic in a similar manner to agr-mutants (Fig. 3a,b) 
144 
(Supplementary Fig. 17). By contrast, PSMβ-defective mutants were impaired in daptomycin 
145 
inactivation and were as susceptible to the antibiotic as the wild-type, despite releasing similar levels 
146 
of phospholipid to the Δpsmα mutant (Fig. 3a,b,c; Supplementary Fig. 11). Supplementation of the 
147 
culture medium with a mixture of synthetic PSMα, but not PSMβ, peptides restored killing of 
148 
Δpsmαβ mutants (Fig. 3d,e; Supplementary figure 18). Of all the PSMs, PSMα1 was most effective at 
149 
preventing daptomycin inactivation by the USA300 Δpsmαβ mutant and was also able to prevent the 
150 
inactivation of daptomycin by USA300 ΔagrA mutant and purified PG, most likely via its surfactant 
151 
properties (Fig. 3f; Supplementary fig. S18). To test whether PSMα1 bound to released phospholipid 
152 
we measured the haemolytic activity of the toxin in the presence of shed membrane phospholipid, 
153 
or purified PG. The presence of phospholipid completely inhibited the haemolytic activity of PSMα1, 
154 
indicating direct binding of the cytolysin to the phospholipid (Supplementary Fig. 19). Based on these 
155 
findings, we hypothesised that PSMα peptides enhanced daptomycin-mediated killing of S. aureus 
156 
by preventing antibiotic sequestration by the released phospholipid. Using BoDipy-tagged 
157 
daptomycin, we found that wild-type S. aureus steadily accumulated daptomycin over time (Fig. 3g). 
158 
By contrast, binding of daptomycin to S. aureus ΔagrA decreased over time. In the presence of 
159 
PSMα1 peptide, however, daptomycin bound strongly to the ΔagrA mutant, demonstrating that this 
160 
cytolysin promoted binding of the antibiotic to bacteria, as observed for the wild-type (Fig. 3g).  
161 
Daptomycin shares functional similarities with cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs), and 
162 
we therefore hypothesised that lipid shedding may also confer protection against these membrane-
163 
 7 
 
acting antimicrobials. We found that lipid shedding by the ΔagrA mutant was triggered by both nisin 
164 
and melittin, which target the staphylococcal membrane, and that PG inactivated the antimicrobial 
165 
peptides (Supplementary Fig. 20). These findings suggest that CAMPs may have provided a selection 
166 
pressure for the evolution of the phospholipid-shedding response to membrane damage. 
167 
It has been reported previously that β-lactam antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations 
168 
promote daptomycin activity against wild-type S. aureus by increasing the binding of the lipopetide 
169 
to the bacterial membrane29,30. We decided, therefore, to determine if this combination therapy 
170 
could prevent treatment failure of infection caused by the presence of agr-mutant S. aureus. A sub-
171 
inhibitory concentration of the β-lactam antibiotic oxacillin enhanced killing of the S. aureus ΔagrA 
172 
mutant by daptomycin, by reducing the rate of lipid shedding and therefore prolonging the activity 
173 
of the lipopeptide antibiotic (Fig. 4a,b,c,). By contrast, oxacillin did not show synergy with 
174 
daptomycin against wild-type S. aureus, despite reducing lipid release, presumably because the lipid-
175 
shedding mechanism is already compromised by PSM production (Fig. 4d,e,f). Similarly to the ΔagrA 
176 
mutant alone, daptomycin was significantly more effective against mixed populations of wild-type S. 
177 
aureus and ΔagrA mutant in the presence of oxacillin both in vitro, and in an in vivo model of 
178 
invasive infection, suggesting that daptomycin/β-lactam combination therapy would reduce 
179 
treatment failure due to agr-mutant S. aureus (Fig. 4g,h,i,j).  
180 
  
In conclusion, this work has identified membrane phospholipid shedding as a rapid 
181 
and transient defence utilised by S. aureus against an antibiotic of last resort, (Supplementary Fig. 21 
182 
and extended discussion in the Supplementary data file). However, this defence mechanism is 
183 
compromised by Agr-regulated toxins, providing a selective advantage to bacteria with agr-
184 
inactivating mutations during daptomycin exposure. Furthermore, there are several host factors 
185 
which inhibit Agr activity14, indicating that wild-type bacteria may successfully employ this defensive 
186 
system during certain types of infection. To combat the sequestration of daptomycin by 
187 
phospholipids, we describe a simple dual therapy approach of combining daptomycin with oxacillin. 
188 
 8 
 
The presence of this β-lactam reduces the rate of lipid shedding, slows daptomycin inactivation and 
189 
thereby reduces the likelihood of treatment failure.

 Methods  
1 
Bacterial culture 
2 
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are detailed in Supplementary Table 3. S. aureus was 
3 
grown, unless otherwise stated, in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 37 °C, with shaking (180 RPM). Where 
4 
required, culture medium was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg ml-1), chloramphenicol (10 μg 
5 
ml-1) or tetracycline (10 μg ml-1). Staphylococcal CFU were enumerated by serial dilution and plating 
6 
onto tryptic soy agar (TSA). E. coli was grown in Luria Broth at 37 °C, with shaking at 180 RPM or on 
7 
LB agar with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1) as required.  
8 
 
9 
Construction of agr mutants 
10 
Mutants deficient in RNAIII, agrA or agrC were generated in USA300 LAC with pIMAY as described 
11 
previously31,32. Primers, detailed in Supplementary Table 4, were used to amplify DNA corresponding 
12 
to approximately 500 bp up- and down-stream of the coding regions to be deleted. Primers were 
13 
designed to include regions of homology that facilitated fusion of amplicons using the Gibson 
14 
assembly kit (New England Bioscience). The resulting product was digested at the 5’ and 3’ ends 
15 
using KpnI and SacI and ligated into similarly digested pIMAY, before transformation into E. coli 
16 
DC10B. Constructs were recovered from DC10B using a Qiagen midiprep kit and transformed into 
17 
electro-competent S. aureus USA300 LAC31,32. Mutants were selected for using anhydrotetracycline, 
18 
as described previously31,32, on blood agar plates to identify agr mutants defective for haemolysis. 
19 
This approach resulted in full, markerless deletion of agrA or RNAIII, and deletion of nucleotides 127-
20 
1119 from agrC as confirmed by PCR using oligonucleotides labelled as ‘Out Fwd’ or ‘Out Rev’ in 
21 
Supplementary Table 2 to amplify and sequence the mutated locus. DNA sequencing confirmed loss 
22 
of relevant regions of DNA without the acquisition of mutations in flanking regions. Mutations in 
23 
agrA or agrC were complemented using plasmid pCN34 containing the agrA or agrC gene under the 
24 
control of the P2 promoter33,34.   
25 
 
26 
  
27 
Determination of antibiotic minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC/MBC) 
28 
MICs were determined using the broth microdilution protocol35,36. Stationary-phase S. aureus grown 
29 
in TSB was adjusted to 5 × 105 CFU ml-1 in fresh TSB or Muller-Hinton Broth (MHB), each containing 
30 
CaCl2 (50 μg ml-1) and a range of concentrations of daptomycin. After static incubation at 37 °C in air 
31 
for 18 h, the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth35,36. 
32 
MBC values were defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic required for a >1000-fold 
33 
reduction in CFU counts compared to the inoculum37,38. In some cases, MIC or MBC assays were 
34 
done in TSB supplemented with 10 μM purified lipids. 
35 
 
36 
Spent culture supernatant bactericidal activity assay 
37 
Bacterial cells were removed from spent culture supernatant by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min) 
38 
and filtration through a 0.2 μm filter. Wild-type USA300 was then added to the supernatant to a 
39 
density of 5 × 105 CFU ml-1 and incubated statically at 37 °C in air for 18 h. Bacterial CFU were then 
40 
determined by serial dilution and plating onto TSA. 
41 
 
42 
Determination of antibiotic bactericidal activity 
43 
Stationary-phase bacteria were inoculated into 3 ml TSB containing antibiotics to ~108 CFU ml-1: 
44 
daptomycin (20 μg ml-1) with CaCl2 (0.5 mM); gentamicin (10 μg ml-1); vancomycin (10 μg ml-1) or 
45 
cloxacillin (1.25 μg ml-1) or antimicrobial peptides nisin (20 μg ml-1) or melittin (50 μg ml-1). Cultures 
46 
were subsequently incubated at 37 oC with shaking (180 RPM) and bacterial viability determined by 
47 
CFU counts. Stationary-phase bacteria were used as this is when Agr is active in vitro. Most 
48 
experiments used mono-cultures of strains but some utilised mixtures of wild-type and agr-mutant 
49 
bacteria, with the inoculum maintained at a total of 108 CFU ml-1. All concentrations used fall within 
50 
previously described free serum concentrations from humans or animal models given clinically-
51 
relevant therapeutic doses and were at least 2.5 × MIC, which has been shown previously to be 
52 
 bactericidal for the antibiotics used39-44. 
53 
In some assays the respiratory inhibitors 2-n-Heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO, 10 µg ml-1) 
54 
or sodium azide (0.05%) were included, or the protein synthesis inhibitors tetracycline (10 µg ml-1) or 
55 
chloramphenicol (20 µg ml-1). Other assays included the beta-lactam antibiotic oxacillin (0.25 µg ml-1) 
56 
or the lipid biosynthesis inhibitor platensimycin (7.5 µg ml-1).  
57 
In several cases, the culture supernatant was recovered for analysis of daptomycin activity or lipid 
58 
content. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation (17,000 x g, 5 min) and filtration through a 0.2 µM 
59 
filter.  
60 
In other assays, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (17,000 x g, 5 min), the supernatant 
61 
removed and the bacteria resuspended in an equal volume of filter sterilised spent culture 
62 
supernatant from a different strain before immediate use in assays. 
63 
 
64 
Daptomycin activity determination 
65 
A well of 10 mm was made in TSA plates containing 50 μg ml-1 CaCl2 followed by the spreading of 50 
66 
μl stationary phase wild-type USA300 LAC (~106 CFU ml-1) in TSB across the surface. The spread 
67 
bacterial inoculum was allowed to air dry and the wells filled with supernatant from cultures that 
68 
had been processed by centrifugation (17,000 × g) and filter sterilization (0.2 μm filter) to remove 
69 
bacterial cells. Plates were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C before the zone of growth inhibition around 
70 
the well was measured at 4 perpendicular points. In some cases, fresh daptomycin was added to 
71 
culture supernatants, incubated for 0-8 h at 37 oC and antibiotic activity determined as described 
72 
above. In other experiments, culture supernatants were pre-treated with heat (80 oC, 20 min), or 
73 
Triton X-100 (0.1%), phospholipases (5 U ml-1) or proteases (10 μg ml-1) for 16 h at 37 oC prior to the 
74 
addition of fresh daptomycin. In addition to culture supernatants, daptomycin activity was 
75 
determined in the presence of purified lipids and/or PSMα1 peptide at the concentrations indicated 
76 
in the figure. All experiments used the same batch of agar plates and a standard plot was generated 
77 
 for each experiment using a range of daptomycin concentrations, enabling the conversion of the size 
78 
of the zone of inhibition into percentage daptomycin activity.   
79 
 
80 
Murine infection model 
81 
Animal work was conducted in accordance with the Animals [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986 
82 
outlined by the UK Home Office regulations. Work was approved by the UK Home Office after ethical 
83 
approval by the Imperial College Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB). Six- to eight-
84 
week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, United Kingdom) were infected via the intraperitoneal 
85 
route with 2.5 × 107 CFU USA300 LAC or a 1:1 mixture of wild-type and ΔagrA mutant USA300 LAC 
86 
(total of 2.5 × 107 CFU). For the indicated experiment, wild-type bacteria were resuspended in spent 
87 
culture supernatant from either wild-type of agrA bacteria exposed to daptomycin. Mice were then 
88 
treated with 250 μl PBS containing daptomycin (40 μg ml-1) and calcium (0.5 mM), with or without 
89 
oxacillin (0.5 μg ml-1), injected into the peritoneal cavity (i.e. the daptomycin concentration within 
90 
the peritoneal cavity was ~20 μg ml-1 and, where used, oxacillin was present at 0.25 μg ml-1). Control 
91 
groups were treated with PBS alone. Experiments were continued for 8 h before animals were 
92 
humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation and death confirmed by severing the femoral artery. The 
93 
peritoneal cavity was washed with PBS and CFU counts determined on blood agar plates. Wild-type 
94 
and ΔagrA mutant bacteria were differentiated on the basis of haemolytic activity. The size of the 
95 
groups used was determined prior to undertaking the experiment using power analysis based on in 
96 
vitro data45. Tubes containing the inocula and antibiotic solutions were blinded prior to commencing 
97 
the experiment. Mice were randomly allocated to individual study group cages by animal husbandry 
98 
technicians who were not involved in the study. Each group was randomly allocated to a treatment. 
99 
In keeping with Home Office regulations, any animals that displayed 2 or more of the following signs 
100 
were humanely killed by a Schedule 1 method and excluded from the study: reduced movement, 
101 
hunched posture, shivering, dyspnoea or cyanosis or circling.  
102 
 
103 
 Bacterial growth and Agr activity assays 
104 
Bacteria were inoculated into the wells of black microtitre plates with clear bottoms containing 200 
105 
μl TSB to a concentration of ~107 CFU ml-1 and incubated in a Polarstar Omega multiwell plate reader 
106 
at 37 oC with shaking (500 RPM)31,34. The plate reader was programmed to take OD600 readings every 
107 
30 min for 17 h. Simultaneously, GFP fluorescence from the agr-P3 promoter was measured using an 
108 
excitation filter of 485 nm and an emission filter of 520 nm to generate values expressed as relative 
109 
fluorescence units31,34. 
110 
 
111 
Haemolysis assay 
112 
Spent culture supernatants (1 ml) from stationary phase bacteria were subjected to serial 2-fold 
113 
dilution in fresh TSB before the addition of sheep blood to 2%. Supernatant/blood mixtures were 
114 
incubated statically at 37 oC for 1 h before intact blood cells were removed by centrifugation. The 
115 
degree of red cell lysis was determined by measuring A450
31. Blood incubated in TSB only served as a 
116 
negative control, whilst TSB containing 0.1% Triton X-100 served as a positive control and was 
117 
considered to represent 100 % lysis.   
118 
 
119 
Membrane lipid detection 
120 
S. aureus membrane lipid was detected and quantified using FM-4-64 (Life Technologies)46. Bacterial 
121 
culture supernatants (200 μl) or other solutions were mixed with FM-4-64 to a final concentration of 
122 
5 µg ml-1, and fluorescence measured with a Tecan microplate reader using excitation at 565 nm and 
123 
emission at 660 nm. Standard plots of purified phospholipids were used to determine the relative 
124 
concentration of lipid in culture supernatants.  
125 
 
126 
Daptomycin pull-down assays  
127 
Daptomycin was labelled with desthiobiotin (Pierce) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. 
128 
Briefly, desthiobiotin (100 μl, 10 mM) was mixed with daptomycin (100 μl, 6 mM) and PBS to 1 ml 
129 
 before incubation at room temperature with gentle rocking for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then 
130 
dialysed against H2O at 4 oC to remove unbound desthiobiotin using a Float-A-Lyser G2 device 
131 
(Spectrum labs) with a molecular weight cut-off of 0.1 kDa. The antibiotic activity of the labelled 
132 
daptomycin was confirmed using a MIC assay and LC-MS analysis of labelled daptomycin was 
133 
employed to confirm labelling of the antibiotic (data not shown). For the pull-down assay spent 
134 
culture supernatant (1 ml) was incubated with 20 μg ml-1 desthiobiotin-labeled daptomycin for 1 h at 
135 
37 oC with end-over-end mixing at 10 RPM. In some assays 10 µM PSMα1 was included. Streptavidin-
136 
agarose beads (200 µL) were washed with PBS and added to the supernatant containing labelled 
137 
daptomycin and incubation continued for 1 h at 37 oC. Beads were then allowed to settle for 10 min 
138 
before centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min to pellet remaining beads in suspension. The supernatant 
139 
was then removed and the pelleted beads washed with TSB. An additional round of centrifugation 
140 
and a TSB wash was done before the beads were resuspended in elution buffer (100 µl, 4 mM biotin) 
141 
followed by incubation at 80 oC for 20 min. TSB was then added to the beads and elution buffer, 
142 
mixed by pipetting and beads removed by centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was 
143 
recovered and lipid content measured using FM-4-64 dye as described above. 
144 
  
145 
Measurement of cell-associated daptomycin 
146 
Daptomycin was labelled with BoDipy FL SE (D2184, Life Technologies). Daptomycin (50 μl, 50 mg ml-
147 
1) was mixed with Bodipy (100 μl,10 mg ml-1 in DMSO) and the reaction volume made to 1 ml with 
148 
sodium bicarbonate (0.2 M pH 8.5) before incubation at 37 oC for 1 h. Unbound Bodipy was removed 
149 
by dialysis as described above for desthiobiotin. Also as above, the antibiotic activity of the labelled 
150 
daptomycin was confirmed using a MIC assay, and LC-MS analysis of labelled daptomycin was 
151 
employed to confirm labelling of the antibiotic (data not shown). Bacterial cells were incubated in 
152 
TSB containing the labelled antibiotic for 0-8 h, as described for killing assays before they were 
153 
washed 3 times in TSB. BoDipy-labelled daptomycin bound to bacterial cells was quantified with a 
154 
Tecan microplate reader using excitation at 502 nm and emission at 510 nm. 
155 
  
156 
Lipid extraction and thin-layer chromatography 
157 
Lipids were extracted from spent culture supernatants using a method based on that described by 
158 
Bligh and Dyer47. Culture supernatants or TSB containing various purified lipid standards and 
159 
daptomycin were extracted with 1 sample volume of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The samples 
160 
were mixed by vortexing and then centrifuged (17,000 x g, 10 min) to separate the aqueous and 
161 
organic phases. The aqueous phase was removed and the organic phase evaporated at room 
162 
temperature. Samples were then resuspended in 100 µl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Samples 
163 
were then separated by one-dimensional TLC as described previously48. In brief, equal volumes of 
164 
lipid extracts were spotted onto silica 60 F254 HPTLC plates (Merck) and migrated for 25 min with 
165 
chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (30%) (65:30:4, by volume)48. TLC plates were allowed 
166 
to dry by evaporation before lipids were detected using iodine vapour. Purified lipid standards 
167 
included phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid and 
168 
phosphatidylethanolamine. All standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the exception of 
169 
lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Avanti Polar lipids). To ensure accurate comparison between spent 
170 
culture supernatant and the lipid standards, purified lipids were added to TSB at 100 µM and 
171 
daptomycin (20 µg ml-1) added before the mixtures were subjected to the lipid extraction procedure.  
172 
The identity and relative proportions of lipids were determined as described previously24,49. Lipids 
173 
were extracted from spent culture supernatant into chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) as described 
174 
above. Samples were then subjected to 2D thin layer chromatography, firstly with 
175 
chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (30%) (65:30:4, by volume) and then with 
176 
chloroform:acetic acid:methanol:water (170:25:25:4, by volume). Plates were then dried and lipids 
177 
visualised with iodine as described above. The identity of each spot was determined by reference to 
178 
the migration pattern of purified phospholipid standards as described previously49,50. Each spot was 
179 
scraped from the plate using a sterile scalpel and the quantity of phospholipid in each determined by 
180 
digestion with 0.3 ml 70% perchloric acid at 150 oC for 3 h. The digested phospholipid was then 
181 
 incubated with a detection reagent (10% ascorbic acid, 2.5% ammonium molybdate, 5% perchloric 
182 
acid at 1:1:8 ratio by volume) at 37 oC for 2 h, and quantification by measurement at 750 nm and 
183 
reference to standards of known concentrations49,50. The concentration of each lipid was derived 
184 
from quantification of lipid in culture supernatant from USA300 WT or ΔagrA mutant using FM-4-64 
185 
and reference to a standard plot generated using purified phosphatidylglcyerol.

187 
Daptomycin resistance emergence assay 
188 
Bacterial strains were inoculated into TSB containing daptomycin (20 μg ml-1) and CaCl2 (0.5 mM) 
189 
and survival over 8 h measured as described in the Methods section for the determination of 
190 
antibiotic bactericidal activity. After 8 h bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (17,000 x g, 5 min), 
191 
washed twice in TSB and resuspended in 3 ml fresh TSB, before incubation at 37 oC with shaking (180 
192 
RPM) for 16 h to stationary phase. The activity of daptomycin in the culture supernatants was 
193 
determined by the zone of inhibition assay (daptomycin activity determination in the Methods 
194 
section). The bacterial populations were then inoculated once again into TSB containing daptomycin 
195 
(20 μg ml-1) and CaCl2 (0.5 mM) and survival over 8 h measured. We also determined the daptomycin 
196 
MIC of recovered bacterial populations as described in the Methods section. At the end of the 
197 
second period of daptomycin exposure, the daptomycin activity was determined and bacteria 
198 
transferred into antibiotic-free TSB. This assay was repeated for a third time. Measurements of 
199 
bacterial survival, daptomycin activity and daptomycin MIC were made for all three rounds of 
200 
daptomycin exposure. 
201 
 
202 
Synthetic peptides 
203 
Synthetic peptides were generated by Peptide Protein Research Ltd, UK according to previously 
204 
described sequences, with formylated methione (fM) at the N-termini27:  PSMα1 
205 
fMGIIAGIIKVIKSLIEQFTGK; PSMα2 fMGIIAGIIKFIKGLIEKFTGK; PSMα3 fMEFVAKLFKFFKDLLGKFLGNN; 
206 
PSMα4 fMAIVGTIIKIIKAIIDIFAK; PSMβ1 fMEGLFNAIKDTVTAAINNDGAKLGTSIVSIVENGVGLLGKLFGF; 
207 
 PSMβ2 fMTGLAEAIANTVQAAQQHDSVKLGTSIVDIVANGVGLLGKLFGF. In addition, a peptide comprised 
208 
of the reverse sequence of PSMα1 (PSM-rev; KGTFQEILSKIVKIIGAIIGM) was synthesised. Unless 
209 
otherwise indicated, peptides were used in assays at 10 μM, which was based on concentrations 
210 
described for stationary phase cultures of USA30030. When used in combination, 10 μM of each 
211 
peptide was used.  
212 
 
213 
Statistical analyses 
214 
Unless otherwise mentioned, data are represented as the arithmetic mean average from 3 or more 
215 
independent experiments and error bars represent the SD of the mean.  For multiple comparisons, 
216 
data were analysed using a one-way ANOVA for data generated from a single time point or two-way 
217 
ANOVA for data collected from multiple time points. Post-hoc tests were only used when the overall 
218 
ANOVA P value was <0.05. Unless stated otherwise, for one-way ANOVA the Tukey post-hoc test was 
219 
used and for two-way ANOVA Dunnett’s or Sidak’s multiple comparison tests were used as 
220 
appropriate. For single comparisons data were analysed using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student’s t-test. 
221 
Where there are significant differences in values, these are described in the legend and indicated on 
222 
the figure (*). Non-significant differences are only highlighted for animal studies but were omitted 
223 
from other figures for clarity. For each experiment, n refers to the number of independent biological 
224 
repeats, followed by the number of technical replicates in each case. CFU counts from murine 
225 
experiments are presented as the value obtained from each animal. These data were compared 
226 
using Mann-Whitney or two-way ANOVA tests as indicated in figure legends and median values used 
227 
for comparisons.
