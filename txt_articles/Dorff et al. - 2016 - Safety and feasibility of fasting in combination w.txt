Abstract
Background: Short-term starvation prior to chemotherapy administration protects mice against toxicity. We
undertook dose-escalation of fasting prior to platinum-based chemotherapy to determine safety and feasibility in
cancer patients.
Methods: 3 cohorts fasted before chemotherapy for 24, 48 and 72 h (divided as 48 pre-chemo and 24 post-chemo)
and recorded all calories consumed. Feasibility was defined as ≥ 3/6 subjects in each cohort consuming ≤ 200 kcal
per 24 h during the fast period without excess toxicity. Oxidative stress was evaluated in leukocytes using the
COMET assay. Insulin, glucose, ketones, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) were
measured as biomarkers of the fasting state.
Results: The median age of our 20 subjects was 61, and 85 % were women. Feasibility criteria were met.
Fasting-related toxicities were limited to ≤ grade 2, most commonly fatigue, headache, and dizziness. The COMET assay
indicated reduced DNA damage in leukocytes from subjects who fasted for ≥48 h (p = 0.08). There was a
non-significant trend toward less grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in the 48 and 72 h cohorts compared to 24 h cohort (p = 0.
17). IGF-1 levels decreased by 30, 33 and 8 % in the 24, 48 and 72 h fasting cohorts respectively after the first fasting
period.
Conclusion: Fasting for 72 h around chemotherapy administration is safe and feasible for cancer patients. Biomarkers
such as IGF-1 may facilitate assessment of differences in chemotherapy toxicity in subgroups achieving the physiologic
fasting state. An onging randomized trial is studying the effect of 72 h of fasting.

Background
Platinum chemotherapy is a mainstay of combination
systemic therapy for many solid tumors, with the ability
to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence after curative
surgery in some situations, or to extend survival in
advanced disease. However toxicity frequently limits the
amount of chemotherapy that can be administered. Both
the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy agents, includ-
ing platinum drugs, are related to oxidative cellular
damage. Preclinical studies have shown that the heart,
liver, and renal tissue may be protected from toxicity by
the concurrent administration of antioxidants [1–3]. The
limitation of this approach has been concern over a pos-
sible attenuation of efficacy against malignant cells, al-
though this has not been substantiated in the available
randomized trial data [4]. A more appealing approach
would be to differentially induce protection in normal
host cells without reducing, or potentially even increasing,
susceptibility of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Cell culture

 experiments have identified that chemotherapy toxicity to
normal primary cells was reduced when cultured in condi-
tions mimicking fasting, while neoplastic cells did not ex-
perience the same protection, and in some cases be
sensitized to the chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in the
low-glucose and low growth factor environment [5, 6].
Further experiments with xenografts in mice revealed that
short-term starvation (STS) for 48 h prior to chemother-
apy treatment significantly reduced side effects and death
from high-dose chemotherapy when compared to mice
fed with standard diets prior to receiving chemotherapy,
leading to a hypothesis that fasting induces oxidative
stress resistance [5]. The mice subjected to STS regained
most of the weight lost during the 4 days after chemother-
apy, whereas the control mice lost a significant proportion
of their weight in the same post-chemotherapy period, po-
tentially reflecting their experience of chemotherapy toxic-
ities of anorexia and nausea. The overall response of the
mice exposed to STS was encouraging for the safety of
translating this concept into human cancer patients.
Powerful and wide-ranging metabolic and gene expres-
sion changes are induced by calorie restriction in normal
cells, including upregulation of antioxidants and DNA
repair pathways, in part mediated by dampening the
nutrient-sensing and pro-proliferative pathways such as
IGF-1/Akt and mTOR [6]. Oncogene expression, affect-
ing the same pro-growth signaling cascades among
others, prohibit a fasting-like response in cancer cells
which continue to proliferate, and cancer cells may actu-
ally be sensitized to toxins in the setting of nutrient
deprivation [7]. Studies in healthy volunteers have re-
vealed that within 22 and 48 h of fasting, blood glucose
and insulin levels decrease significantly, and blood ke-
tones increase [8, 9]. STS has been shown to induce a
40 % reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor-
1 (IGF-1) as well as changes in IGF-1 binding protein
(IGFBP) levels in mice [10, 11]. These changes represent
a potential set of biomarkers for identifying when a pro-
tective state may occur, although they only represent a
subset of the changes induced by fasting.
As a first step in exploring the ability of fasting to
induce differential stress resistance in humans, we
performed a clinical trial to determine the safety and
feasibility of fasting prior to chemotherapy adminis-
tration in human cancer patients. We sought to iden-
tify a recommended fasting duration to be studied in
a subsequent randomized trial, embedding correlative
studies to generate preliminary data regarding bio-
markers of the fasting state and to evaluate oxidative
stress in host leukocytes as proof of principle. To
assess safety and compliance, we designed a dose-
escalation protocol in a “real-world” setting of pa-
tients with advanced cancer receiving platinum-based
combination chemotherapy.
Methods
Eligible patients had cancer for which platinum-based
combination chemotherapy without concurrent radiation
was being recommended with curative (peri-operative)
or palliative intent. Because fasting was timed around
the administration of platinum, regimens in which plat-
inum was administered consecutively for more than
2 days (ex: Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin for germ cell
tumors) were not eligible. Patients may have begun re-
ceiving
platinum
chemotherapy (1–2
cycles
of
the
chemotherapy could have already been administered),
provided at least 2 more cycles were planned during
which fasting could occur. Chemotherapy was adminis-
tered at the treating physician’s discretion; standard anti-
emetics were administered, including dexamethasone
and 5HT3 inhibitors. Subjects were excluded if they had
diabetes, low body mass index (<20.5), or had lost more
than 10 % of their weight in the preceding year.
Escalation of fasting began at a “dose” level of 24 h,
and each cohort consisted of 6 subjects; the design is
summarized in Fig. 1. Subjects were instructed to con-
sume zero calories, but ample water and non-caloric
beverages. However subjects were advised that if they
had symptoms related to fasting (such as feeling faint,
weak, dizzy, etc.) that they should consume a small
amount of juice or food, aiming to stay under 200 kcal
in a 24 h period. All food consumed was recorded in a
food diary, including quantity, so that calorie intake
could be estimated. There were no specific requirements
for what to eat on all other days of the chemotherapy
cycle, although a transition diet (ex: starting with small
quantities of soft cooked foods, then advancing to regu-
lar diet) was recommended at the completion of longer
fasting durations.
A patient was classified as “compliant” if he or she
consumed fewer than 200 kcal/24 h during the fasting
period for 2 consecutive courses of chemotherapy. Feasi-
bility for the fasting regimen was defined as 3 or more
complaint subjects who did not experience unacceptable
fasting-related toxicity. Unacceptable fasting-related tox-
icity was defined as: patients being hospitalized during
the fasting period (for reasons that are not attributed to
disease, chemotherapy or post-operative complications)
OR patients experiencing any Grade 3+ adverse events
not
attributed
to
disease,
chemotherapy
or
post-
operative complications during the fasting period. Toxic-
ities were recorded at the start of each chemotherapy
cycle, and were graded according to CTCAE v4.0. The
safety benchmark was set at 0 subjects in the 6 person
cohort experiencing unacceptable toxicity related to
fasting.
If the 24 h fasting cohort did not meet the criteria for
safety AND feasibility, the protocol would be terminated.
If safety and feasibility were met, escalation would

Page 2 of 9
 proceed to 48 h, and then if the 48 h cohort met the cri-
teria for safety and feasibility, the plan was to escalate to
72 h fasting (48 h before and 24 h after completion of
platinum chemotherapy, the split timing based on pre-
clinical observations). If feasibility or safety were not
met at 48 h, a 48 h fasting cohort would be opened with
a specific low-calorie diet plan. If the 72 h cohort was
opened but was found to be not safe or feasible, expansion
of the 48 h cohort would occur (see Fig. 1).
After enrollment, baseline levels of glucose, insulin,
and IGF-1 pathway markers were measured. Subjects
were instructed to begin the fast 24 (or 48) hours before
the expected completion of their platinum infusion, thus
requiring coordination with the infusion centers and
careful estimation of pre-medication and hydration infu-
sion times. Fasting was undertaken prior to chemother-
apy during 2 chemotherapy treatment cycles. Subjects
were allowed to choose whether to continue fasting or
to consume a regular diet prior to subsequent chemo-
therapy treatments.
Blood samples were collected after fasting but before
administration of premedications and chemotherapy,
and then again 24 h after completion of chemotherapy.
Serum samples were analyzed for IGF-1 and IGFBP1 by
an in-house ELISA developed in the Cohen laboratory
[12, 13]. Single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet
assays [14]) for the detection of DNA damage was
performed with Trevigen Comet Assay kits according to
the manufacturer’s protocols Fig. 2. In brief, cells iso-
lated from buffy coats were embedded in Comet LM
Agarose and then lysed followed by electrophoresis in
TBE buffer. Cells were stained with SYBR Green and im-
aged. Analysis was performed using CometScore™, where
values of Olive moment were generated [15]. Biomarker
data,
except
the
Comet
assay,
were
logarithm-
transformed prior to analysis; to compare differences
among the 3 fasting cohorts, only “compliant” patients
were included. Geometric means and associated 95 %
confidence intervals were calculated; p-values for the
biomarkers analyses were based on the F-test from re-
gression analyses with patients classified as a random ef-
fect. Categorical data were summarized with numbers
and percentages; Fisher’s exact test was used to test as-
sociation and Mantel-Haenszel test for trend was used
for testing for trend. Intent-to-treat analysis was used
for clinical endpoints.
Results
After Institutional Review Board approval, 20 subjects
provided written informed consent and were enrolled
from October 2009 to November 2012 at the University
of Southern California (USC) Norris Comprehensive
Cancer Center and the Los Angeles County/USC Medical
Center. Trial design schema is provided in Additional file

hours fasting, we planned a “de-escalation” to a 48 hour fasting period with planned rescue food: R48p. However, if 48 hours fasting was safe and
feasible, we would escalate to 72 hours fasting, broken down as 48 hours before chemotherapy and 24 hours after, R48/24r

scription of the tumor types and chemotherapy regimens
and disease states for study participants is presented in
Table 1. Demographics and study treatment course are
summarized in Table 2. Nine subjects were Hispanic, 2
were African-American, 8 were non-Hispanic white, and 1
patient was Asian. 17 (85 %) were women.
In the 24 h cohort, all 6 subjects were evaluable, but
only 4 successfully fasted for 2 chemotherapy cycles; no
significant fasting toxicities were noted. Reasons for fail-
ure included forgetting (n = 1) and desire not to fast due
to social constraints with visiting friends/family (n = 1).
In the 48 h cohort, 6 subjects were evaluable and 5 were
compliant; one inevaluable due to change in chemother-
apy plans before completing 2 cycles and was replaced.
Of the 6, one failed to regain 25 % of lost weight during
the rest of the treatment cycle and per protocol could
not fast again. In the 72 h cohort, 7 subjects were
enrolled but 1 was ineligible due to normal BMI, but
lower than eligibility criteria; with subsequent protocol
amendment, this patient would have been eligible and is
included in the analysis. All subjects in the 72 cohort
consumed some calories, but 4 were reported compli-
ance with <200 kcal/24 h of fasting. Overall, 13 of
the 20 patients recorded calorie consumption falling
within the < 200 kcal/24 h compliant range. Fasting-
related symptoms included fatigue (10 subjects, 6
grade 1 and 4 grade 2), grade 1 headache (6 subjects),
dizziness
(6
subjects),
hypoglycemia
(3
subjects),
grade 1 weight loss (2 subjects), hyponatremia (2 sub-
jects) and hypotension (1 subject); there were no
grade 3 or 4 fasting-related toxicities.
Chemotherapy-related toxicities were collected and
tabulated, with data summarized in Table 3. Grade 3 or
4 neutropenia occurred in 4 of 6 patients in the 24 h
cohort (67 %), 1 of 7 patients in the 48 h cohort (14 %)
and 2 of 7 patients in the 72 h cohort (29 %) p = 0.17 for

 24 h compared to the 48 + 72 h cohort patients. Routine
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) support
was not prohibited, but was not used in our study popu-
lation except in one patient after neutropenia had oc-
curred. All 6 subjects in the 24 h fasting cohort
experienced grade 1 or 2 nausea, compared to 6 of 7
(87 %) in the 48 h cohort and 3 of 7 (43 %) in the 72 h
cohort (p = 0.019, test for trend); 5/6 (83 %) subjects in
the 24 h fasting cohort experienced grade 1 or 2 vomit-
ing, compared to 3/7 (43 %) in the 48 h cohort and none
(0 of 7) in the 72 h cohort (p = 0.003, test for trend).
Pathologic complete responses in the setting of radio-
graphic complete responses were observed in 2 patients
(Table 2). Partial radiographic responses were seen in 6
of the 20 patients, of which 1 patient subsequently was
found to have pathologic complete response. Three pa-
tients had stable disease as their best radiographic re-
sponse,
of
which
2
underwent
surgery
and
had
pathologic complete response. Four of the pathologic
complete responses were seen in the 72 h cohort; the
other was in the 48 h cohort. One patient had progres-
sive disease during treatment (48 h cohort), and 6 were
not evaluable because they were treated in the adjuvant
setting.
Changes in insulin, glucose, IGF-1, IGFBP, and β-
hydroxybutyrate levels are summarized in Table 4,

Among the
compliant
patients,
blood glucose did not change significantly or consist-
ently (p = 0.35). In the 24 h cohort, 4 of 6 subjects re-
ported compliance with fasting and recorded <200
kCal consumed; in these, 4 patients, insulin levels de-
creased by a mean of −56 % just after chemotherapy
following the first fast. In the 48 h cohort, in 6 com-
pliant patients, the insulin level decreased by 27 %
and in the 7 compliant patients in the 72 h cohort,
insulin levels decreased by 42 % at 48 h after fasting.
Although patterns were suggestive, given the patient-
to-patients variability, the 3 cohorts did not differ sig-
nificantly in terms of changes over time (p = 0.35).
Just after chemotherapy following the first fast, IGF-1
levels decreased by a mean of −30 % (−44 %, −12 %)
in the 24 h cohort, −33 % in the 48 h cohort, and
−8 % in the 72 h cohort (p = 0.32 comparing all 3

 were elevated in the 48- and 72-h cohorts; in contrast
the levels in the 24-h cohort were decreased (see
Table 4). Overall the changes in the 48- and 72-h
cohorts differed from the changes in the 24-h cohort
(p = 0.037), depicted in Additional file 1: Figure S2.
Serum pre-albumin levels did not change consistently
with fasting based on the 10 compliant patients who
had data available.
DNA damage in normal cells was measured using per-
ipheral blood mononuclear cells from study subjects
using the COMET assay (Fig. 2). DNA damage increased
in all cohorts after chemotherapy, however after fasting
48 or 72 h there was a decrease in Olive tail moment
whereas the 24 h cohort continued to have evidence of
increased DNA damage. At baseline the Olive tail mo-
ments, based on the COMET assay, were similar for the
3 fasting cohorts (see Fig. 3) and were essentially un-
changed just after chemotherapy following the first fast
(p = 0.61 based on least significant difference method of
pairwise
comparisons
following
overall
p-value
for
changes over time p < 0.001). 24 h later the peripheral
blood mononuclear cell DNA damage had increased
slightly for all three groups (p = 0.042). In contrast, by
the second course, the DNA damage decreased for the
48-h and the 72-h cohorts (range 0.9 to 20.7 – all values
less than baseline), but not for the 24-h cohort (p = 0.08).
Discussion
Calorie restriction has been associated with an increase
in longevity in animals [16], and with lower rates of de-
veloping aging-related diseases such as spontaneous can-
cer formation [16, 17]. However, calorie restriction
requires long periods to be effective and can cause a
number of side effects which includes impaired immune
function and wound healing. In contrast, brief cycles of
STS lead to profound changes in gene expression and
cellular metabolism that render normal cells more resist-
ant to oxidative stress [6, 18]. There has been interest in
studying the effect of calorie intake and nutritional com-
position of diet on the risk of disease progression or re-
currence in patients with cancer diagnoses [19, 20].
Fasting has been studied as an adjunct to traditional
therapy in rheumatoid arthritis [21] and as a means of
preventing chronic disease [22, 23]. However, the use of
STS to reduce chemotherapy side effects in cancer
patients has, to our best knowledge, never been studied
in a clinical trial. We present the first dose-escalation
study of fasting in human cancer patients receiving

cohort. The post-fasting blood draws were taken after 24 h of fasting in the 24 h cohort, and after 48 h of fasting in both the 48 and 72 h cohorts, and were done
prior to any premedications or chemotherapy

 chemotherapy, and found that up to 72 h of calorie
intake <200 kcal per 24 h was safe and feasible in a
population of men and women aged 31 to 75. There
were no grade 3 toxicities attributed to fasting, and only
one subject failed to regain any of the fasting associated
weight prior to the next chemotherapy cycle. We did
not find any evidence of malnutrition, although we were
unable to obtain pre-albumin data in all subjects. Im-
portantly, the safety of fasting prior to chemotherapy
can only be extrapolated to a selected population of on-
cology patients, as we excluded those with >10 % recent
weight loss, body mass index <20.5, or diabetes mellitus.
Although the study was not designed to compare
the toxicity experience between cohorts, we did plan
to look at changes in fasting biomarkers as part of
the determination of which duration of fasting would
be optimal to pursue in the randomized portion of
the trial. IGF-1 has been shown to be one of the
major growth factors that promote cell proliferation
and growth. In model organism, inhibition of the
IGF-1 signaling is associated with enhanced cellular
protection against various stresses including toxins.
By contrast, most tumor cells harbor oncogenic muta-
tions in the IGF-1 signaling pathway. Constitutive ac-
tivation of IGF-1 downstream mediators renders the
tumor
cell
irresponsive
to
fasting-induced
cellular
protection. IGF-1 is significantly reduced by fasting
[24], while its binding proteins exhibit divergent pat-
terns of change in response to fasting. IGFBP-1 in-
creases rapidly even with overnight fasting and is
quickly suppressed by calorie intake [25]. The IGF-1
axis has been implicated in conferring differential stress re-
sistance [5, 18]. Chemotherapy toxicity was found to be
dramatically reduced using the liver IGF-1 deficient (LID)
mouse model, which has a tissue-specific knockdown of
IGF-1 resulting in approximately 70 % lower circulating
IGF-1 levels than in normal mice [18]. In our subjects,
there was some significant reduction of IGF-1 after fasting,
which continued at the 24 h post-chemotherapy point, des-
pite resuming normal diet. Although we would have ex-
pected greater reductions in IGF-1 in the cohorts with
longer durations of fasting, the degree of change was simi-
lar between the 24 h fasting and longer duration fasting
groups. The variability in insulin and IGF-1 changes likely
reflects some non-compliance, perhaps a greater degree in
the cohorts with longer fasting. Furthermore, values during
the second fasting cycle may have been affected by dexa-
methasone administration with the previous cycle of
chemotherapy. Since many patients joined the study after
having completed one cycle of chemotherapy, even the first
fasting cycle results could have been impacted.
Because there was no control group eating a regular
diet, we cannot yet address the hypothesis of whether
patients experience fewer or less severe chemotherapy
side effects after fasting. However, we found preliminary
evidence of reduced DNA-damage evident in host leuko-
cytes after chemotherapy exposure for subjects who
fasted for 72 h compared to 24 h. This is one mechan-
ism by which we hypothesize fasting may not only re-
duce toxicity to normal tissues, but improve cancer
treatment efficacy: by reducing damage to hematopoietic
precursors and promoting hematopoietic stem cell-
Fig. 3 Olive moments, indicating DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, are shown here by cohort, comparing the chemotherapy-free
baseline (BL) to a sample taken after fasting, but before chemotherapy (C1D1 = cycle 1, day 1) and 24 hours after chemotherapy (C1D2 = cycle 1, day
2) and again after fasting but before chemotherapy (C2D1 = cycle 2, day 1). The difference comparing the 48 + 72 hour cohorts to the 24 hour cohort
is p=0.08 by F test with ANOVA

 dependent regeneration [26, 27], blood counts might be
maintained at higher levels, which would allow patients
to receive their chemotherapy at full dose, on time. The
reduced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells seen based on the COMET assay results (Fig. 3)
may translate into clinical benefit if host tissues, such as
hematopoietic precursor cells, are protected and regen-
erated. Our findings in the study population mirror what
we have observed in mice. We previously reported pre-
liminary evidence of hematopoietic protection from this
patient population, with less depletion of lymphocyte
counts noted after repeated cycles of chemotherapy in
patients who fasted for 72 h compared to those who
fasted 24 h [26, 27]. Now we present additional evi-
dence for protection against myelosuppression (Table 3),
with fewer patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
in the 48 and 72-h fasting cohorts, as well as lower rates
of grade 1 and 2 thrombocytopenia. This, of course, is
confounded by the varying chemotherapy regimens, and
specifically by the fact that there was more gemcitabine/
cisplatin in the 24 h cohort (4/6) compared to the 48- and
72-h cohorts (1/7 and 2/7, respectively). Furthermore, pa-
tients did not always enroll in the clinical trial during their
first cycle of chemotherapy, so that the number of cycles
an individual had experienced at the time point blood was
drawn was not uniform. Nevertheless, the trends are fa-
vorable, and the lower rate of neuropathy in the 48 and
72 h fasting cohorts is particularly intriguing, given the
greater number of taxane-containing regimens in these
cohorts. Additional data from the ongoing randomized
phase II portion of this trial will provide direct compara-
tive data to evaluate whether STS indeed protects cancer
patients against chemotherapy toxicity.
One of the reasons anti-oxidants and similar com-
pounds have not been met with enthusiasm by the on-
cology community as potential methods via which to
reduce chemotherapy toxicity is the concern for redu-
cing chemotherapy efficacy. Thus, while evaluating treat-
ment response was not feasible as an endpoint for this
study due to the heterogeneity of cancer types and
chemotherapy regimens as well as the inclusion of pa-
tients receiving treatment in the adjuvant setting, we felt
it was important to at least evaluate whether we saw a
lack of response to chemotherapy. Our observation of
pathologic complete responses and radiographic re-
sponses provides reassuring preliminary evidence that
the anti-neoplastic effect of chemotherapy was not nega-
tively affected by fasting, in agreement with results pub-
lished in animal studies. Our ongoing phase II trial will
focus on patients being treated in the metastatic or neo-
adjuvant setting, and will have larger numbers of pa-
tients receiving the same chemotherapy regimens so that
we can better speak to this concern, and evaluate
whether enhancement of chemotherapy effect occurs.
Limitations of our study include the possibility of in-
complete compliance and the variability of the compos-
ition of the “rescue” food consumed. Despite our
encouragement to study subjects to honestly disclose all
food and beverage consumed during the fasting period,
the lack of consistent changes in glucose or ketone gen-
eration may indicate that more than 200 kcal/24 h
period were consumed even in subjects whose food diar-
ies reported <200 kcal/24 h. Furthermore, the protein
content and derivation of rescue foods could theoretic-
ally influence the perception by host tissues of lack of
nutrients in the environment, which may have contrib-
uted to the variable results. In the randomized trial
which is currently underway, we will perform intention-
to-treat analysis, but will also analyze a subgroup of
“biochemically compliant” subjects to determine whether
achievement of the protective fasting state, not just the
attempt to achieve a fasting state, is associated with re-
duced chemotherapy toxicity. In addition, a separate
study is underway which employs a specific fasting-
mimic diet, in which subjects are provided all the food
they should consume during the “fasting” period around
chemotherapy (NCT01802346). This approach will elim-
inate the variability in the composition of the rescue
food consumption and may be more acceptable to pa-
tients than aiming for zero calorie intake.
Conclusions
In conclusion, fasting for up to 72 h, divided as 48 h be-
fore and 24 h after chemotherapy infusion, is safe and
feasible in human cancer patients receiving platinum
combination chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from
correlative studies supports the hypothesis that fasting
may confer some protection to host tissues against
chemotherapy damage to normal tissues.
