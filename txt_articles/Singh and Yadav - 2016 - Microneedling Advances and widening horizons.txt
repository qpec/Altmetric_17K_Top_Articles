ABSTRACT
Microneedling is a very simple, safe, effective, and minimally invasive therapeutic technique. It was initially 
introduced for skin rejuvenation, however, now it is being used for a very wide range of indications including 
acne scar, acne, post‑traumatic/burn scar, alopecia, skin rejuvenation, drug delivery, hyperhidrosis, stretch 
marks, and many more. Moreover, during the last 10 years, many new innovations have been made to the 
initial instrument, which was used for microneedling. This technique can be combined with other surgical 
techniques to provide better results. In particular, it is a very safe technique for dark skin types, where risk of 
postinflammatory pigmentation is very high with other techniques that damage the epidermis. In this review 
article, we are updating on the different instruments now available for this procedure, and its efficacy when 
performed alone or in combination with other techniques for various indications.
Key words: Dermaroller, dermatosurgery, microneedling, percutaneous collagen induction
INTRODUCTION
Microneedling is a relatively new minimally 
invasive procedure involving superficial and 
controlled puncturing of the skin by rolling with 
miniature fine needles. Over a short period 
of time, it has gained mass popularity and 
acceptance as it is a simple, cheap, safe, and 
effective technique requiring minimal training. 
Traditionally used as a collagen induction therapy 
for facial scars and skin rejuvenation, it is also 
widely used now as a transdermal delivery 
system for therapeutic drugs and vaccines. In 
this review, we highlight the constantly evolving 
research and developments in microneedling 
techniques, instruments, and its applications in 
dermatology.
THE INVENTION
The advent of the concept of microneedling 
dates back to 1995 when Orentreich and 
Orentreich described dermal needling in the 
form of subcision for scar treatment and then 
independently in 1997 by a plastic surgeon 
Camirand who used tattoo guns without ink 
to take-off tension from postsurgical scars.[1,2] 
Microneedling technique was given further shape 
by a German inventor Liebl in 2000 and a plastic 
surgeon Fernandes in 2006 who self-designed a 
drum-shaped device with multiple fine protruding 
needles and used it for percutaneous collagen 
induction.[3,4]
BASIC INSTRUMENT
The standard medical dermaroller [Figure 1] 
has a 12 cm long handle with a 2 × 2 cm wide 
drum-shaped cylinder at one end studded 
with 8 rows and 24 circular arrays of 192 fine 
microneedles, usually 0.5–3 mm in length and 
0.1–0.25 mm in diameter.[3] These single use 
microneedles are synthesized by reactive ion 
etching techniques on silicon or medical-grade 
stainless steel. The instrument is presterilized 
by gamma irradiation. Rolling with a standard 
dermaroller containing 192 needles of 2 mm 
length and 0.07 mm diameter over an area of 
skin for 15 times results in approximately 250

holes per square cm upto the papillary dermis depending on 
the pressure applied.[5] Each pass produces 16 micropunctures 
in the stratum corneum per square cm without damaging the 
epidermis significantly.[6]
Principle and mechanism of action
Micropunctures are created using microneedles which produce 
a controlled skin injury without actually damaging the epidermis. 
These microinjuries lead to minimal superficial bleeding and 
set up a wound healing cascade with release of various 
growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor (PGF), 
transforming growth factor alpha and beta (TGF-α and TGF-β), 
connective tissue activating protein, connective tissue growth 
factor, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).[7] The needles 
also breakdown the old hardened scar strands and allow it 
to revascularize. Neovascularization and neocollagenesis is 
initiated by migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and laying 
down of intercellular matrix.[8,9] A fibronectin matrix forms after 
5 days of injury that determines the deposition of collagen 
resulting in skin tightening persisting for 5–7 years in the form 
of collagen III. The depth of neocollagenesis has been found 
to be 5–600 µm with a 1.5 mm length needle. Histological 
examination of the skin treated with 4 microneedling sessions 
1 month apart shows upto 400% increase in collagen 
and elastin deposition at 6 months postoperatively, with 
a thickened stratum spinosum and normal rete ridges at 
1 year postoperatively.[10] Collagen fibre bundles appear to 
have a normal lattice pattern rather than parallel bundles as 
in scar tissue.[6]
Liebl et al. have proposed another hypothesis to explain how 
microneedling works.[11] Resting electrical membrane potential 
of cells is approximately −70 mV, and when needles come 
near the membrane, the inner electrical potential increases 
quickly to −100 mV. This triggers increased cell activity and 
the release of various proteins, potassium, and growth factors 
from the cells into the exterior leading to the migration of 
fibroblasts to the site of injury, and hence, collagen induction. 
Thus, the needles do not create a wound in a real sense, but 
rather body cells are fooled into believing that the injury has 
occurred.[9,11-13]
The expression of matrix metalloproteinases induced 
by microneedling is speculated in reduction of 
hyperpigmentation.[11] In addition, the hyperproliferation of 
keratinocytes is downregulated by microneedling in acne 
patients because it overall balances out the cell equilibrium.[11] 
However, more research needs to be done to elucidate the 
chain of events clearly.
Microneedling enhances the delivery of various drugs across 
the skin barrier as it bypasses the stratum corneum and 
deposits the drug directly up to the vascularized dermis. It has 
also been shown to cause significant widening of the follicular 
infundibulum by 47%, which may partly explain the increased 
penetration of the medication across the skin barrier. In addition, 
it removes the scales and sebum residues in the neighbourhood 
of the infundibulum.[14]
Hence, this procedure extrapolates the body’s own physiology 
of wound healing and the new collagen deposition results in 
skin tightening and filling-up of atrophic scars with an overall 
better aesthetic appeal since overlying epidermis is not 
ablated.
PROCEDURE
Microneedling is a simple office-based procedure lasting 
10 to 20 minutes depending on the area to be treated. 
The patients must be counselled prior to the procedure 
explaining the expected outcomes, delayed response, and 
need for multiple sittings. The skin should preferably be 
prepared preoperatively for at least a month with vitamin A 
and C formulations twice a day to maximize dermal collagen 
formation. Vitamin A influences 400–1000 genes that control 
proliferation and differentiation of all major cells in epidermis 
and dermis, and Vitamin C is essential for production of 
normal collagen.[10]
The procedure is performed under topical anesthesia 
containing eutectic mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine/
tetracaine for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After preparation of the 
area with antiseptic and saline, the skin is stretched with 
one hand, and perpendicularly, rolling is done 5 times each 
in the horizontal, vertical, and oblique directions with the 
other hand [Figure 2]. The treatment endpoint is identified 
as uniform pin-point bleeding which is easily controllable. 
Post-procedure, the area is made wet with saline, or ice

packs can be used for comforting the patient. Thereafter, 
the patient is advised to use sunscreen regularly and follow 
sun-protective measures. The procedure is well-tolerated by 
the patients and there are usually no post-treatment sequelae 
except slight erythema and edema lasting for 2–3 days. 
There is no downtime and the patient can resume daily work 
the very next day. Treatments are performed at 3–8 week 
intervals and multiple sittings are needed to achieve the 
desired effect on the skin. The final results cannot be viewed 
immediately because new collagen continues to be laid 
down for approximately 3–6 months after treatment has 
ceased.[10,15]
V A R I O U S  I N S T R U M E N T S  A N D 
TECHNIQUES
A simple dermaroller has evolved over the past decade through 
a variety of advancements. The current market is booming with 
an assortment of devices based on needle length, drum size, 
and automation [Figure 1].
The most important is the diversity of needle lengths. High ratio 
of tip length versus diameter of 13:1 is an important property of 
good needles.[6] The length of needle selected for an individual 
patient depends upon the indication for microneedling. For 
treating acne and other scars as a routine, a needle length of 
1.5–2 mm is usually used. When microneedling is used as a 
procedure to treat ageing skin and wrinkles, the needle length 
of 0.5 mm or 1.0 mm is usually recommended.[9] When the 
needles are only up to 0.5 mm long, the procedure is essentially 
painless, and the perception of pain increases as the depth of 
needle penetration increases. It also depends on the thickness 
of epidermis and dermis of the skin.
The minimum time interval between two sittings of microneedling 
depends upon the indication for which the procedure is being 
done as well as the needle length of the dermaroller being 
used. More is the needle length, greater should be the interval 
between two sittings of microneedling. When using 1.5 mm 
dermaroller, at least 3 weeks gap should be there between 
two procedures.
Five basic types of medical dermarollers, which are registered 
with the FDA, have been described in the dermaroller series 
by Konstantinos, and most dermarolling devices are adopted 
from these elementary types:[16]
• 
C-8 (Cosmetic type), is the basic dermaroller as described 
above with a needle length of only 0.13 mm (130 µm) used 
for enhancing penetration of topical agents. It is completely 
painless.
• 
C-8HE (Cosmetic type for hair-bearing surfaces, scalp) 
has a needle length of 0.2 mm (200 µm). Even this length 
is below the pain threshold.
• 
CIT-8 (CIT: Collagen Induction Therapy, Medical type) has 
a needle length of 0.5 mm (500 µm) and helps in collagen 
induction and skin remodelling.
• 
MF-8 type has a needle length of 1.5 mm (1500 µm). This 
creates deeper microchannels on the whole epidermis 
and dermis and at the same time destroys scar collagen 
bundles.
• 
MS-4 is the only dermaroller that has a smaller cylinder, 
1 cm length, 2 cm diameter, and subsequently 4 circular 
arrays of needles (total 96 needles) that have 1.5 mm 
length. It is used on areas where better precision and 
deeper penetration is required. It is mostly used on facial 
acne scars.
• 
Devices similar to MS-4 are available with needle lengths of 
0.5–0.75 mm, which are used for thin-skinned areas such 
as the periorbital and perioral regions.
Home care dermaroller
Home-care dermarollers (C-8) are used by patients 
themselves as they are of needle length less than 0.15 mm 
and are available for reduction of pore size, fine lines, and 
sebum production, as well as for transdermal delivery of 
substances such as lipopeptides and other antiageing 
products. They can be used twice or thrice a week for up 
to 100 times. After use, the rollers should be cleaned in 
hot tap water and shaken dry.[3,17] Beauty Mouse is another 
approved device intended for home use. It contains a total 
of 480 needles of approximately 0.2 mm size on 3 separate 
drums strategically placed inside a computer mouse shaped 
device. It has been developed to ensure coverage of larger 
skin surface areas, such as the arms, legs, and buttocks 
for the treatment of stomach or thigh stretch marks and 
cellulite.[18]

Derma‑stamp
These are miniature versions of the dermaroller available 
in different needle lengths (0.2–3 mm) and a diameter of 
0.12 mm that are used for localized scars such as varicella 
scars. Advantage over the dermaroller is that a more focussed 
treatment of individual scars is possible. It causes vertical 
penetration to create infusion channels in the skin and is 
considered ideal for use on isolated scars and wrinkles.[3,5,17,18]
Dermapen
Dermapen [Figure 3] is an automated microneedling device 
which looks like a pen. This ergonomic device makes use of 
disposable needles and guides to adjust needle length for 
fractional mechanical resurfacing. The tip has 9–12 needles 
arranged in rows. It makes use of a rechargeable battery to 
operate in two modes, namely, the high speed mode (700 cycles/
min) and the low speed mode (412 cycles/min) in a vibrating 
stamp-like manner.[19] It has the advantage of being reusable 
in different patients as the needles are disposable, safe as the 
needle tips are hidden inside the guide, and more convenient to 
treat narrow areas such as the nose, around the eyes and lips 
without damaging the adjoining skin. It makes the procedure 
less painful and more economical as there is no need to buy 
a new instrument every time.[20] This technology has been 
designed to overcome the issues of varying pressure application 
and the subsequent depth of penetration achieved.[18]
DermaFrac
DermaFrac treatment is a newer modification of microneedling 
combining microdermabrasion, microneedling, simultaneous 
deep tissue serum infusion, and light emitting diode (LED) 
therapy. DermaFrac treatments target aging and sun damaged 
skin, acne, enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, 
fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and superficial scars. It takes 
approximately 45 min to complete full face treatment when 
all four modalities are used. This noninvasive, cost-effective 
treatment carries the advantage of having no downtime with 
individualized selection of serums for infusion.[20,21]
Microneedle delivery systems
Microneedle delivery systems offer a minimally invasive and 
painless method of transdermal drug administration, especially 
useful for vaccines.[22] The various types of microneedles 
available for this purpose can be solid, coated, dissolving, 
hollow, and swellable polymer microneedles synthesized by 
microfabrication technique.[18] Silicon, metals such as titanium, 
natural and synthetic polymers, and polysaccharides are 
the various materials used to fabricate these microneedles. 
Solid-coated microneedles are used to pierce the superficial 
skin followed by topical application and delivery of the drug, 
whereas dissolvable or biodegradable and hollow needles 
deliver drugs directly into the dermis.[22]
Fractional radiofrequency microneedling
The amalgamation of microneedling with radiofrequency has 
further expanded the prospects of application of this technology. 
Insulated needles are used to penetrate the skin and release 
radiofrequency currents from the needle tips producing thermal 
zones in the dermal structural components and accessory 
glands without damaging the overlying epidermis.[23] This 
triggers long-term dermal remodelling, neoelastogenesis, and 
neocollagenesis. The depth of the needles can be adjusted 
from 0.5 mm to 3.5 mm allowing us to target different layers of 
the dermis discretely.[24] Operating person can exercise a good 
control over tissue damage by adjusting the power level and 
duration of energy pulse. The main energy delivery system has 
a disposable tip with 49 gold plated needles.  
Microneedling 
radiofrequency (MNRF) technology does not damage the 
epidermis, and is therefore, safe in darker skin types. Its 
indications include scar treatment, hyperhidrosis, skin 
tightening, rejuvenation, and many more.
Light emitting microneedling device
LED microneedling rollers have been recently launched. 
These incorporate titanium microneedles and LED light to 
combat wrinkles and scarring.[19] These devices have not yet 
been explored and no published data is available regarding 
its efficacy.
APPLICATIONS OF MICRONEEDLING IN 
DERMATOLOGY
Dermarolling has been used for a wide range of indications 
with many trials supporting evidence for its usefulness.[5,6,17,23] 
It has been tried alone as well as in combination with other 
treatment modalities such as chemical peeling, platelet rich

plasma, radiofrequency, subcision, punch elevation, and lasers. 
It is often used in conjunction with a topical formulation, and 
hence, enhances its penetration and action.
Skin rejuvenation
Microneedling leads to reorganization of old collagen fibres and 
laying down of new collagen, elastin, and capillaries leading 
to the effect of skin tightening. A significant increase in level 
of collagen type I, III, and VII, newly synthesized collagen and 
tropoelastin from baseline was observed after 6 microneedling 
sessions at 2-week intervals by El-Domyati et al.[25] This 
percutaneous collagen induction leads to an overall youthful 
appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, 
reducing pore size, more suppleness, and elasticity.
The effects are enhanced when the procedure is combined with 
topical antiageing vitamin C serum and tretinoin application. 
Microneedling has also been combined with human embryonic 
stem cells derived endothelial precursor cell conditioned 
medium and has shown significant reduction in wrinkles and 
pigmentation.[26,29] Fractional microneedling radiofrequency has 
been studied in a large multicentre trial and has found to be 
effective in reducing wrinkles [Table 1].[27]
Scars
Acne scars
The most frequently used indication of microneedling is 
post-acne facial atrophic scars [Figure 4], and a large number 
of trials have been conducted to evaluate the same alone 
as well as in combination with chemical peels, platelet-rich 
plasma, subcision, cryotherapy, and CROSS technique. 
Microneedling has been found to be more effective for rolling 
and boxcar scars, and relatively less effective in ice-pick 
scars. It is safe for all skin types with minimal downtime. 
Only the affected area needs to be treated and there is 
minimal risk of post-inflammatory dyschromia. However, 
a minimum of 4–6 sessions are required for a significant 
improvement [Table 2].
Nonacne scars
Post-burn scar, post-traumatic scar, hypertrophic scars, 
varicella scars [Table 3].
Post-surgical scars were the first to be studied by Camirand[2] 
who used tattoo gun needles to reduce the scars. Since then, 
microneedling has been used for almost all types of surgical 
scars and are to be found useful. Microneedling has been 
found to be effective in reducing even burn scars [Figure 5] 
by up to 80% in a study on 16 patients by Aust et al. It was 
stipulated that there is normalization of collagen-elastin matrix 
in the dermis at 1 year.[10,15] Microneedling is also effective for 
varicella scars [Figure 6] and post-traumatic scars [Figure 7].
Acne vulgaris
The advent of fractional microneedling radiofrequency has 
expanded the application of microneedling to acne vulgaris 
as well. It directly targets the sebaceous glands and helps in 
reducing the sebum production. It is also known to reduce the 
hyperproliferation of keratinocytes [Table 4].
Androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata
Use of microneedling over scalp for alopecia is one of its recent 
advances. It has been compared with minoxidil alone and 
has been found to be better in combination.[47,48] Home-use 
dermarollers are prescribed to patients who are using minoxidil, 
and a better hair growth is observed. However, when topical 
minoxidil was compared with Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and 
microneedling therapy in a recent study, minoxidil alone continued 
to remain better.[49] Microneedling has also been combined with 
topical triamcinolone acetonide application in alopecia areata 
and better response has been observed [Table 5].[50]
P igmentation—Melasma and periorbital 
hypermelanosis
The introduction of Dermafrac technique and smaller drums 
with needles sizes approximately 0.5 mm has made the 
microneedling to periocular skin amenable. Microneedling

Miscellaneous conditions
Extended applications of microneedling include stretch marks, 
axillary hyperhidrosis, and actinic keratosis in photodamaged 
skin. MNRF has been used even in patients with rosacea and 
post-acne erythema with favorable results [Table 7].

TRANSDERMAL DELIVERY OF DRUGS
The technique of microneedling has been well-exploited to 
increase penetration of drugs across the skin barrier. This has 
been proven in in‑vitro skin models where enhanced absorption 
of larger molecules such as calcein has been observed.[62,63] 
Microneedles cover a range of activity between that of a 
transdermal patch and a hypodermic needle attempting to gain 
the advantages of both and eliminate the disadvantages of each 
one of them. Microneedling has been used for the transdermal 
delivery of various types of drugs including macromolecular 
biopharmaceuticals such as insulin, growth hormone, heparin, 
and albumin; immunobiologicals such as hepatitis B, tetanus 
toxoid, and influenza vaccines; proteins, peptides and drugs 
such as aspirin, minoxidil, tretinoin, and L-ascorbic acid.[21,64,65] 
Microneedling has also been combined with other advanced 
techniques such as micropumps, sonophoresis, iontophoresis, 
and electroporation for better drug penetration.[21]
With respect to dermatology, microneedling is often combined 
with topical tretinoin and vitamin C for the treatment of 
acne scarring and skin rejuvenation, as described above. 
Penetration enhancement of minoxidil and platelet-rich plasma 
for androgenic alopecia is another application. Microneedling 
enhances the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid for more efficacious 
photodynamic therapy.[66] They have been used in combination 
for the treatment of actinic keratosis[56] and photoaging.[28]
CONTRAINDICATIONS[5,6]
1. Active acne
2. Herpes labialis or any other local infection such as warts
3. Moderate to severe chronic skin disease such as eczema 
and psoriasis
4. Blood dyscrasias, patients on anticoagulant therapy
5. Extreme keloidal tendency
6. Patient on chemo/radiotherapy.
LIMITATIONS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS
Dermarolling has its own set of limitations despite its assembly 
of effective uses and advantages over other procedures. It is

less efficacious in some types of scars such as pitted scars, 
linear scars, and deep boxcar scars. However, combining other 
surgical procedures to microneedling can improve its results.
Certain adverse events are also known with the procedure, the 
common ones being potential erythema and irritation which 
usually subside within a few hours. Other events noted are 
post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, aggravation of acne 
and reactivation of herpes, systemic hypersensitivity, allergic 
granulomatous reactions and local infections following the use 
of a nonsterile instrument.[6,9,17,22] Allergic contact dermatitis 
to materials used in the needles has also been observed.[67] 
Tram-track effect after two sessions of microneedling has been 
reported in a patient with acne scars who developed regularly 
placed linear papular scars over bony prominences of the 
face.[68] This can be avoided by using less pressure and smaller 
needles over these areas.
Microneedling is relatively safe to use in Indian skin because 
it rarely leads to hyperpigmentation unlike other ablative and 
resurfacing procedures.[23] It carries a better safety profile with 
regards to risk of dyspigmentation in all skin types.[34]
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Because skin is an easily accessible tissue, has a good 
regenerative capacity, and is easily scrutinized directly, it serves 
as a potential organ for the development of therapeutic and 
prophylactic genetic medicines. It was demonstrated by Chabri 
et al. that microneedling can be used for intradermal delivery of 
a nonviral vector which can be exploited for localized treatment 
of genetic diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa.[69]
Dermarolling may be useful to dye poorly pigmented hairs 
and improving laser hair removal because it has been shown 
that it dilates the follicular infundibulum and increases the 
transfollicular absorption of melanin.[14]
CONCLUSION
Microneedling is an effective modality of treatment, especially 
in patients with Fitzpatrick’s IV and V skin types because it 
overcomes the side effects of scarring and hyperpigmentation 
resulting from other procedures in which the epidermis is 
compromised. It certainly promises to be a valuable technique 
with its numerous applications and its ever-expanding 
modifications as well as feasibility of home use.
