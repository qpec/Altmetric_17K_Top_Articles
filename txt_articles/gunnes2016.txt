Novelty and impact: Death by suicide was assessed using national registry data for survivors of cancer 
diagnosed before 25 years of age. The authors present striking new findings indicating >2-fold increased 
risk of suicide in survivors of childhood cancer (diagnosed <15 years) as well as survivors diagnosed 
during adolescence/young adulthood (15-24 years). These findings have implications for follow-up care, 
including implementation of screening and suicide prevention efforts for cancer survivors.

Abstract: 
Suicide risk in adult cancer patients is found to be elevated, but limited information exists regarding risks 
of suicide and non-suicidal violent deaths when diagnosed with cancer in young age. We investigate 
suicide and violent deaths in a national cohort including individuals diagnosed with cancer before age 25. 
Through the linkage of different national registries (Cancer Registry of Norway, Norwegian Causes of 
Death Registry, and the National Registry) a cohort of all live births in Norway during 1965-1985 was 
defined and followed up through 2008. Individuals diagnosed with cancer before age 25 and the cancer-
free references were compared using an extended Cox proportional hazard regression model. The cohort 
comprised 1,218,013 individuals, including 5,440 diagnosed with cancer before age 25. We identified 24 
suicides and 14 non-suicidal violent deaths in the cancer group. The hazard ratio (HR) of suicide in the 
cancer group was 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-3.8), and was increased both when diagnosed 
with cancer in childhood (0-14 years of age); HR=2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.6), and during adolescence/young 
adulthood (15-24 years); HR=2.6 (95% CI 1.5-4.2). Survivors of bone/soft tissue sarcomas, CNS tumors 
and testicular cancer were at particular risk. The risk of non-suicidal violent death was not increased in 
the cancer survivors (HR=1.0; 95% CI 0.6-1.7). Although based on small numbers and the absolute risk of 
suicide being low, these are novel findings with important implications for establishing adequate follow-
up including suicide prevention strategies for young cancer survivors.

Introduction: 
Improved survival after cancer in young age has led to an increased attention towards the long-term 
medical and psychological well-being of these survivors.  In developed countries, suicide and violent 
deaths are the most common causes of death in the 15-30 age group.1-3 Hence, it is important to define 
at-risk individuals or groups, in order to develop appropriate prevention strategies.  
The risk of suicide in cancer patients (regardless of age at diagnosis), is found to be increased, and 
especially during the first year after diagnosis.4-7However, large prospective studies of suicide risk in 
childhood and adolescent/young adult (AYA) cancer survivors are lacking, and risk estimates are not 
necessarily transferable to this age group. One Swedish study of cancer survivors diagnosed between 15 
and 30 years of age found a 1.6-fold increase in risk of suicidal behavior (completed suicide and suicide 
attempts combined).8 Previous studies of late mortality (all causes) in childhood cancer survivor (CCS) 
populations (surviving >5 years from diagnosis) have not found an increase in the risk of death from 
external causes or suicide, except for a recent publication from the British Childhood Cancer Survivor 
Study, where a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.4) for (all) 
external causes of death was found .9-13,  Suicidal ideation, however, appear to be increased in CCS, at 
least in a selected, US population.14, 15 
Since both cancer in young age and suicide are infrequent events, large population-based studies are 
needed for investigating a possible association. Suicide is a definite event, and may serve as the ultimate 
surrogate marker of the burden of late- and long-term effects after cancer in young age. The aim of the 
current study was to investigate, through a prospective design, the risk of suicide and violent deaths in a 
population-based cohort including survivors diagnosed with cancer before the age of 25 in Norway.  
Materials and methods: 
Our cohort consisted of all individuals born in Norway from 1965 to 1985, identified by the National 
Registry and followed through 2008 (age 23-43 years at end of follow-up).16 Information on cancer 
diagnoses before the age of 25 (including date of diagnosis, primary site and morphology) was supplied 
by the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN), and information on cause of death was provided by the 
Norwegian Cause of Death Registry.17 Quality assessments have found the data from both the CRN and 
the Norwegian Causes of Death registry to be of high quality.17, 18 Cancer was categorized into major 
cancer sites according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-7, ICD for oncology (ICD-O-2), and 
Manual of Tumor Nomenclature and Coding (MOTNAC).18 External causes of death were identified by 
diagnostic codes in the ICD 8-10, as registered on the death certificate (Supplementary Table S1).19, 20 
Information on emigration and marital status was provided by the National Registry, on disability 
pension by the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Service and on parental education by the Norwegian 
National Education Database. Precise record linkage was made possible by a unique personal 
identification number, assigned to all residents in Norway since 1960.

An extended Cox proportional hazards method was applied, with age at cancer diagnosis as the time-
varying covariate, yielding hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This method was 
chosen in order to fully take advantage of the prospective nature of our data, to allow change in status 
of the classifying event (cancer) during follow-up, avoiding immortal-time bias21, and thus maintaining 
full statistical power. The cohort member changed follow-up strata from non-cancer to cancer at the 
time of cancer diagnosis, and thereby contributed their observation time to the non-cancer (non-
exposed) group prior to their cancer diagnosis. Analyses were adjusted for year of birth and parental 
education (highest educational level achieved by either the mother or father of each cohort member) in 
order to control for preexisting differences in socioeconomic status. We did not include intermediary 
variables such as marital status or disability pension in the final Cox regression model, since these 
variables are down-stream in the causal pathway, and adjustment might lead to overadjustment bias.22 
Stratified analyses for these variables are precluded by small numbers, and interaction analyses revealed 
nonsignificant results. For basic characteristic differences, we used independent t-test, chi-squared test 
or Fishers exact test, as appropriate. 
Follow-up started at birth for suicide as the outcome (due to some suicides occurring in the age group 8-
14 years), and at age 15 years for the outcome of non-suicidal violent (external) causes of death. Follow-
up ended at death by suicide or other external causes, death by other causes, emigration or December 
31st 2008, whichever occurred first. The term cancer survivor in this study comprises all individuals in the 
cohort diagnosed with cancer before 25 years of age.23 SPSS version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and 
STATA version 14 (StataCorp 2015, College Station, TX, USA) were used for statistical analyses. The study 
was approved by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority and the Regional Committee for Medical and 
Health Research Ethics of Western Norway. 
Results: 
Of the 1,218,013 individuals in our cohort, 5,440 were diagnosed with cancer before the age of 25. 
Among the individuals diagnosed with cancer, there were 24 suicides, compared with 3,375 in the 
cancer-free reference population (Table 1). There was no significant difference regarding disability 
pension status (p=0.06), marital status (p=0.74), suicide methods (p=0.60), or sex (p=1.00) between 
cancer survivors committing suicide and the non-cancer comparisons (Table 2). The cancer survivors 
were slightly older at suicide (mean age 28.0 years) compared to the non-cancer references (mean age 
25.1 years, p=0.03). Death by external causes (other than suicide) was recorded in 14 individuals in the 
cancer group and 6,690 in the non-cancer comparisons (Table 1). Six of the cancer patients who 
completed suicide were diagnosed during 1965-1979, 16 during 1980-1994 and two during 1995-2007. 
The suicides in the cancer group were completed at a range of 6 to 497 months from cancer diagnosis 
(median 146 months; 10th percentile 18 months, 90th percentile 387 months), and 2/24 (8.3%) within the 
first year of diagnosis (Figure). None of the cancer survivors committing suicide were receiving disability 
pension on the background of a diagnosis of depression or anxiety at the time of suicide. 
There was more than twofold increased risk of death by suicide in the cancer survivors compared to the 
cancer-free references (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.7-3.8) (Table 1). The risk of death by all external causes was 
significantly increased in the cancer survivor population when including suicide (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.2)

but not when analyzing external causes excluding suicide (HR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6-1.7). Assessing specific 
external causes of death, we found no significant difference in the risk for any of these (except suicide) 
between the cancer group and the non-cancer references (Table 1). When analyzing the risk of suicide 
stratified by sex, the estimates were similar, although reaching statistical significance for men only (HR 
2.4; 95% CI 1.6-3.8). The risk of suicide was increased both when diagnosed with cancer before age 15 
years (childhood cancer survivors (CCS)), HR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.6, and between age 15 and 24 years 
(adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors), HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.5-4.1 (Table 3). The suicide risk 
was increased particularly for survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (HR=3.9; 95% CI 1.9-8.3), 
testicular cancer (HR=2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.4), leukemia (HR=3.3; 95% CI 1.3-8.9), and bone/soft tissue 
sarcomas (HR=8.2; 95% CI 2.6-25.5), although each category was based on small numbers (Table 3). 
Discussion: 
In this population-based study of all residents born in Norway over a 20-year period, we found a more 
than twofold increased risk of suicide in persons diagnosed with cancer before age 25, when compared 
to cancer-free references. The risk of violent death (suicide excluded) was not increased.  
We propose alternative explanations for the deviating results on suicide risk found in the current study 
compared to previous late-mortality studies.9-12 First, our data are of high quality as we utilize national 
registries with a uniform recording of all completed suicides within the whole source population, while 
the aforementioned studies compared suicide rates among cancer survivors with expected rates based 
on official statistics. Second, our cohort study included also AYA cancer survivors), and third, our analyses 
were not restricted to 5-year survivors. By using a Cox model (with a time-varying covariate) we take full 
advantage of the prospective nature of our data, and are able to estimate unrestricted and unbiased 
suicide risks among the cancer survivors.  
We also wanted to study external causes of death other than suicide, since there are some publications 
stating disadvantageous behavior related to alcohol and drug use in CCS, which we hypothesized could 
lead to an increased risk of violent (external) deaths (accidental poisoning, road traffic accident, 
drowning).24,25 Our results do not provide any support for this, based on the risk estimates of non-
suicidal violent deaths, although death naturally measures the most extreme outcome possibly resulting 
from this behavior. We also wanted to study non-suicidal external deaths since there is a possibility that 
a small number of suicides might be misclassified as accidental deaths.26, 27  
In our material, survivors of bone/soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia and testicular cancer 
were particularly vulnerable to suicide. Seven individuals with a brain tumor committed suicide, none of 
whom had a high grade tumor (according to the WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous 
system28). This is consistent with studies from the US reporting increased suicidal ideation in survivors of 
brain tumors, and in particular low-grade tumors followed by observation or treated by surgery alone.14, 
29 In a large Norwegian study, Hem et al also found significantly increased risk of suicide in individuals 
with brain tumors (all ages)5. Our results suggest that increased vigilance should be applied not primarily 
to survivors of high grade brain tumors and those most heavily treated, but also to survivors with low-
grade tumors, treated by one modality or observation only. However, these results need confirmation in 
further studies.

An increased suicide risk in patients with testicular cancer was found in a recent publication, especially 
when diagnosed at a young age (<30 years), which corresponds well with our study.30 In contrast, the 
previously mentioned Norwegian study did not find increased risk of suicide in testicular cancer 
patients5. This discrepancy is probably due to the different age distribution in the previous Norwegian 
study and ours. Neither did the Swedish study by Lu et al find an increased risk of suicide behavior in 
testicular cancer patients, but a direct comparison to our study is difficult as the Swedish study did not 
differentiate between suicide attempts and completed suicides8. There are recent reports of increased 
psychological distress, impaired health-related quality of life and increased prevalence of chronic fatigue 
in survivors of testicular cancer, which are factors that might be associated with suicide risk.31, 32 
Previous studies have demonstrated a particularly high suicide risk within the first year following a 
cancer diagnosis5, 7, 8. In our material, the time between diagnosis and suicide varied from 6 to 497 
months, and the median time from cancer diagnosis to suicide was 250 and 86 months for childhood and 
AYA survivors respectively. Only two suicides occurred within the first year after diagnosis, both in the 
AYA group. This might be explained by different (and largely unknown) underlying factors leading to 
suicide in young compared to older cancer patients. 
Weaknesses of our study include a lack of information on suicide attempts or suicide ideation, and 
information on comorbidity was only available for somatic or psychiatric disease severe enough to 
qualify for disability pension. Access to supplementary information could have given a more complete 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the increased suicide risk and how better to identify 
survivors at risk. Another weakness is the lack of treatment data, which could have provided a clearer 
insight into the possible association between specific treatment exposures and suicide. Further studies 
are therefore needed to confirm the findings of this study, both through large, population-based studies, 
and also through other study designs with access to complete treatment data. 
Strengths of our study include the prospective cohort and national registry design, virtually eliminating 
inclusion- and selection bias, and ensuring complete follow-up. In addition, all cancer diagnoses are 
represented in the current study, analyses were not restricted to 5-year survivors and we also studied 
non-suicidal violent deaths. Despite studying very rare outcomes, and thereby analyzing small numbers, 
there are, to our knowledge, no population-based cohort studies on suicide and violent deaths in larger 
populations of CCS and AYA cancer survivors currently available.  
This study present novel information on a heightened suicide risk in individuals diagnosed with cancer in 
childhood, adolescence and young adulthood in Norway, which might be generalizable to other countries 
with similar social structures and cancer treatment programs. Survivors of low grade brain tumors and 
testicular cancer seem particularly vulnerable. The absolute risk of suicide, however, was low both for 
the cancer survivors and for the cancer-free references. The risk factors for suicide in young age are 
complex and involve a spectrum of different underlying mechanisms and vulnerabilities, including 
adverse childhood experiences, chronic medical conditions and certain personality factors. In 
epidemiological studies of suicide risks, such as the current one, information on many of these risk 
factors is not available. Once a heightened suicide risk is demonstrated, the ultimate goal is to 
implement suicide prevention strategies tailored for the group at risk. Our findings complement existing

knowledge on the long-term well-being of survivors of cancer in young age. Until further studies have 
confirmed specific at-risk groups within the increasing number of survivors of cancer in young age, the 
perspective of suicide prevention should be considered in developing long term follow-up guidelines for 
this survivor group as a whole.
