Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed with the search terms “randomized OR randomised” AND 
“ceftazidime AND avibactam” OR “ceftazidime AND avibactam AND Clinical Trial[ptyp]” 
for articles published up to 18 May 2017. These searches identified two phase 2 studies and 
four phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam (± 
metronidazole as applicable for anaerobic coverage) in patients with serious Gram-negative 
infections, including complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI; NXL104/2002 
[NCT00752219], RECLAIM 1 and 2 [NCT01499290], RECLAIM 3 [NCT01726023]), 
complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI; NXL104/2001 [NCT00690378], RECAPTURE 1 
and 2 [NCT01595438 and NCT01599806]), or cIAI/cUTI caused by ceftazidime-non 
susceptible Gram-negative pathogens (REPRISE [NCT01644643]). Across these studies, 
ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated similar efficacy and safety compared with 
predominantly carbapenem comparators. These clinical data, and a phase 1 study 
(NCT01395420) showing that both ceftazidime and avibactam penetrate dose-proportionally 
into epithelial lining fluid (ELF), supported the clinical investigation of ceftazidime-
avibactam in nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 
Added value of this study 
The Phase 3 REPROVE trial is the first clinical study to evaluate ceftazidime-avibactam in 
adults with NP (including VAP). The patient population and pathogens isolated were 
consistent with those commonly observed in patients with NP. The results demonstrated that 
ceftazidime-avibactam was non-inferior to meropenem, a standard therapy for NP, in this 
setting. Efficacy of ceftazidime-avibactam was similar against infections caused by 
ceftazidime-susceptible and ceftazidime-resistant pathogens. The safety profile of 
  
 
 
Page 3 
ceftazidime-avibactam was consistent with that previously observed with ceftazidime alone 
and with the known profile of ceftazidime-avibactam in cIAI and cUTI. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
The pathogens isolated in this study are consistent with those commonly observed in patients 
with NP, including VAP. NP is among the most serious bacterial infections, and �-lactams 
are frequently the cornerstone of antimicrobial therapy in this setting. These results add to the 
evidence base demonstrating the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam in treating 
infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens, including those considered non-susceptible to 
ceftazidime. These findings collectively support a role for ceftazidime-avibactam as a 
potential alternative to carbapenems in patients with serious infections caused by Gram-
negative pathogens, including NP/VAP.

Summary 
Background: Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is commonly associated with antimicrobial-
resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam in 
patients with NP, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), were evaluated in a 
multinational phase 3 double-blind, non-inferiority trial (REPROVE). 
Methods: Adults with NP including VAP (enrolled at 136 centres in 23 countries) were 
randomised (1:1) to ceftazidime-avibactam 2000-500 mg (2-h intravenous [iv] infusions 
every 8 hours [q8h]) or meropenem 1000 mg (30-min iv infusions q8h) for 7–14 days 
(regimens adjusted for renal function). Computer-generated randomisation codes were 
stratified by infection type (VAP or non-VAP) and geographic region using a block size of 4. 
The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (21–25 days post-
randomisation). Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the treatment difference was greater than –12·5% in the co-primary clinically modified 
intention-to-treat (cMITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) populations. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01808092) and EudraCT (2012-004006-96). 
Findings: Between April 2013 and December 2015, 879 patients were randomised; 808, 726 
and 527, respectively, were included in the safety, cMITT, and CE populations. Predominant 
Gram-negative baseline pathogens (microbiologically modified intent-to-treat population; 
n=355) were Klebsiella pneumoniae (36·6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29·6%); 28·2% 
were ceftazidime-non-susceptible. Clinical cure rates (ceftazidime-avibactam versus 
meropenem) were 245/356 (68·8%) versus 270/370 (73·0%; difference [95% CI], –4·2%  
[–10·76, 2·46]) and 199/257 (77·4%) versus 211/270 (78·1%; difference [95% CI], –0·7%  
[–7·86, 6·39]) in the cMITT and CE populations, respectively. Adverse events occurred in 
302/405 (74·6%) versus 299/403 (74·2%) patients in the safety population; most were 
mild/moderate in intensity and unrelated to study treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
  
 
 
Page 5 
and treatment-related SAEs occurred in 75/405 (18·5%) versus 54/403 (13·4%) and 4/405 
(1·0%) versus 0/403 (0·0%) patients, respectively. 
Interpretation: Ceftazidime-avibactam was non-inferior to meropenem in the treatment of 
NP.

Introduction 
Nosocomial pneumonia (NP), also referred to as hospital-acquired pneumonia, remains 
among the most common hospital-acquired infections,1 and is associated with high mortality 
and healthcare expenditure.2,3 Gram-negative pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, predominate in NP.4 These pathogens often harbour 
multiple antimicrobial resistance mechanisms (particularly extended-spectrum �-lactamases 
[ESBLs], and increasingly, carbapenemases).5,6 Treatment options for ESBLs, and 
particularly carbapenemases, are extremely limited.7 Mortality risk and costs of treatment are 
increased in patients receiving inappropriate or delayed appropriate antibiotics.8,9 
Ceftazidime-avibactam combines the anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin ceftazidime, and the 
novel non-�-lactam �-lactamase inhibitor avibactam, which extends the in vitro activity of 
ceftazidime to include Gram-negative organisms producing Ambler class A (eg, ESBLs, 
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase), class C (AmpC) and some class D (OXA-48)  
�-lactamases.10-12 This microbiological profile covers most carbapenem-non-susceptible 
Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa (excluding metallo-�-
lactamase producers), and makes the combination a potential alternative to carbapenems for 
the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections, including those caused by some 
carbapenemase-producing bacteria.13-15 
This paper reports the primary data from the international, randomised phase 3 REPROVE 
trial (NCT01808092) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam versus 
meropenem in the treatment of NP, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods 
Study design 
REPROVE was a prospective, international, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, double-
blind, double-dummy, Phase 3 non-inferiority trial in patients with NP, including VAP. The 
study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and are consistent with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 
E6(R1) for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. All participants 
provided written informed consent. The study protocol and amendments (available at 
www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com) were approved by local ethics committees and/or 
institutional review boards. 
Participants 
Hospitalised adult patients (aged 18–90 years) with NP were eligible for inclusion (see 
appendix pp 4–5). NP was defined as pneumonia with an onset ≥48 hours after admission or 
<7 days after discharge from an inpatient care facility. VAP was defined as parenchymal lung 
infection with an onset ≥48 hours after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
The term ‘non-VAP’ was used to identify patients with NP who did not have VAP. Diagnosis 
of NP was based on clinical assessment, including new/worsening infiltrate on chest X-ray 
within 48 hours of randomisation, and at least one systemic and at least two respiratory signs 
or symptoms of pneumonia. A respiratory specimen for Gram stain and culture was required 
within 48 hours prior to randomisation. Key exclusion criteria included: infections caused by 
any Gram-positive pathogens only or other pathogens not expected to respond to ceftazidime-
avibactam and/or meropenem (polymicrobial infections were permitted if they included a 
target Gram-negative pathogen); patients expected to require >14 days’ treatment (appendix 
  
 
 
Page 8 
pp 5–6). Patients without baseline culture data at the time of randomisation could receive 
study therapy empirically. 
Randomisation and masking 
Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 using an interactive voice/web response system to 
receive either ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem. Patients were stratified by infection type 
(VAP and non-VAP) and geographic region (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, China, rest of 
the world) at randomisation. Randomisation codes were computer-generated by AstraZeneca 
using the AstraZeneca Global Randomization System with a block size of 4. To maintain 
blinding of study treatments, patients received double-dummy matching placebos 
(ceftazidime-avibactam plus meropenem placebo or ceftazidime-avibactam placebo plus 
meropenem). Patients, investigators and all study centre personnel remained blinded to study 
treatment, except for an unblinded pharmacist/designee, who was responsible for maintaining 
accountability and preparing blinded study treatment. 
Procedures 
Patients assigned to ceftazidime-avibactam (AstraZeneca AB; Södertälje, Sweden) received a 
fixed-dose combination of ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg-500 mg) by 2-hour intravenous 
infusion every 8 hours. Patients assigned to the comparator arm received meropenem (ACS 
Dobfar SpA, Milano, Italy) 1000 mg by 30-min intravenous infusion every 8 hours. Dosages 
of both treatments were adjusted for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment 
(CrCL 16–50 mL/min); following a protocol amendment, ceftazidime-avibactam dosage 
adjustments in patients with renal impairment were modified (see appendix pp 7–8), and the 
statistical analysis plan was updated to exclude patients with moderate/severe renal 
impairment at baseline who were randomised before the protocol amendment (MSRIBorig) 
from the main analyses to ensure the main efficacy and safety results were reflective of the 
  
 
 
Page 9 
approved ceftazidime-avibactam dosage regimens; data for MSRIBorig patients were 
summarised separately. Study treatment was discontinued after a minimum of 7 days (21 
doses) and maximum of 14 days (42 doses). 
Patients awaiting identification of aetiologic pathogen(s) and/or susceptibility results from the 
baseline culture at randomisation received open-label linezolid or vancomycin for Gram-
positive pathogen coverage. Open-label amikacin (or other aminoglycoside) for additional 
Gram-negative coverage was given to all patients awaiting baseline culture results for a 
minimum of 48–72 hours (extended depending on culture/susceptibility results) unless 
contraindicated or considered at low risk of MDR Gram-negative pathogens. 
Respiratory specimens for Gram stain and culture were obtained via endotracheal aspirate 
(ventilated patients), expectorated or induced sputum (non-ventilated patients), 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), mini-BAL or protected brush specimen at baseline, end of 
treatment (EOT, within 24 hours after the last dose of study treatment) and at the test-of-cure 
(TOC) visit (21–25 days after randomisation). Two sets of blood samples were collected from 
different sites for aerobic and anaerobic incubation within 24 hours prior to randomisation 
and as clinically indicated. If a previous culture was positive, repeat samples were collected 
at least every three days until clearance of bacteraemia was documented. 
Local laboratories performed pathogen identification and susceptibility testing for all 
respiratory and blood isolates using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk 
diffusion methods16 against ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem and ceftazidime. Isolates 
identified by local laboratories and considered pathogens by investigators were sent to a 
central reference laboratory for confirmation of identification and susceptibility testing. 
Patients had daily assessments from Days 2–14, as well as at an EOT visit within 24 hours 
after completion of the last infusion of study treatment, a TOC visit 21–25 days from 
  
 
 
Page 10 
randomisation, and a final protocol follow-up (FPFU) visit 28–32 days from randomisation. 
The schedule of procedures and assessments is shown in the appendix (pp 9–12). 
Clinical outcomes at EOT and TOC (appendix pp 13–14) were classified by investigators as 
cure (defined at TOC as resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia such that no 
antibacterial therapy for NP was taken between EOT and TOC inclusive), indeterminate or 
failure. Per-pathogen and per-patient microbiological responses (appendix p 15) were 
assessed as favourable (eradication or presumed eradication); unfavourable (persistence, 
persistence with increasing minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], or presumed 
persistence); or indeterminate (per-pathogen responses only). 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients clinically cured at the TOC visit in co-
primary clinically modified intention-to-treat (cMITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) 
populations (see appendix pp 16–17 for definitions of analysis populations). Key secondary 
endpoints included: clinical response at EOT in the cMITT and CE populations and clinical 
response at EOT and TOC in the microbiologically modified intention-to-treat (mMITT), 
extended microbiologically evaluable (eME) and microbiologically evaluable (ME) 
populations; all cause-mortality at TOC and at Day 28 in the CE, cMITT and mMITT 
populations; clinical response at EOT and TOC in patients with ceftazidime-non-susceptible 
pathogens in the CE, cMITT and ME populations; per-patient and per-pathogen 
microbiological responses at EOT and TOC in the mMITT, ME and eME populations (see 
appendix p 18–20 for secondary and exploratory analyses). Safety evaluations included 
monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms, and 
mortality. AEs were summarised for events occurring from the first dose of study treatment 
to the FPFU visit. AEs occurring from the time when informed consent was obtained to the 
  
 
 
Page 11 
first dose of study treatment were recorded, but are not reported here. 
Statistical analyses 
The study was sized to ensure there was sufficient power (at least 85%) for the co-primary 
hypothesis tests against a 12·5% non-inferiority margin, in line with EMA guidance.17 It was 
expected that the underlying clinical cure rate at TOC would be approximately 78% in the CE 
population and 70% in the cMITT population, and that 50% and 85% of patients, 
respectively, would be eligible for inclusion in the CE and cMITT populations. 
The number of patients to be randomised for the primary analysis for non-inferiority was 
approximately 790 patients, to obtain approximately 394 and 670 evaluable patients in the CE 
and cMITT populations, respectively. The estimated power with these numbers of evaluable 
patients (with the above described cure rate assumptions, and with one-sided c=2·5%) was 
calculated using nQuery® Version 7 (Statistical Solutions Ltd Cork, Ireland) using the 
Newcombe-Wilson score method (uncorrected).18 VAP patients were recruited in parallel 
with non-VAP patients (ensuring ≥25% with VAP in the total study population). 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at the TOC visit. Statistical analyses and the non-
inferiority assessment were based on the difference in clinical cure rates between treatment 
groups. The primary efficacy outcome was analysed in the co-primary cMITT and CE 
populations (see appendix pp 16–17). The cMITT population comprised patients who met 
minimum disease criteria (based on inclusion criteria 4 to 7; see appendix pp 4–5) with ≥1 
eligible Gram-negative pathogen, or those without any identifiable pathogen; patients with 
only non-target pathogens were excluded. The CE population comprised patients in the 
cMITT population who received an adequate course of treatment, had an evaluable clinical 
outcome within the assessment window, no protocol deviations that could affect the 
assessment of efficacy, and no unacceptable prior or concomitant antibiotics as defined in 
  
 
 
Page 12 
exclusion criterion 3 (see appendix p 5). The safety population comprised all patients who 
received any amount of study therapy. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
was established with an IDMC charter to ensure the safety of patients was not compromised. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for difference between treatments in proportion of 
patients with clinical cure were computed using the unstratified method of Miettinen and 
Nurminen.19 For primary efficacy endpoints, non-inferiority of ceftazidime-avibactam to 
meropenem was considered demonstrated if lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
treatment difference (ceftazidime-avibactam minus meropenem) was greater than –12·5% 
and the p value was calculated for the corresponding one-sided non-inferiority hypothesis 
test. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 or higher (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary efficacy variable: (1) 
adjusting for the effect of pre-specified stratification factors, type of infection (VAP or non-
VAP), and geographical region; (2) considering patients who had received potentially 
effective concomitant antibiotics as having indeterminate clinical response at TOC; and (3) 
considering patients who died after TOC and up to FPFU visit as clinical failures at TOC. 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses evaluated impact of baseline patient and disease 
characteristics, including infection type (ie, non-VAP or VAP), study region, Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) category, prior systemic 
antibiotic use, presence of bacteraemia, and baseline renal function (including 
moderate/severe impairment [CrCL 16–50 mL/min] and augmented renal clearance [CrCL 
>151 mL/min]). Concomitant aminoglycoside use was evaluated as an exploratory post hoc 
subgroup analysis with patients assigned to categories of concomitant aminoglycoside 
exposure defined before study database lock by blinded review of post-baseline data. This

trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01808092) and EudraCT (2012-004006-96).

Results 
Between April 2013 and December 2015, 879 patients were randomised; 62 patients with 
MSRIBorig (randomised before the protocol amendment) were excluded from the main 
analyses. Of the remaining 817 patients (enrolled at 136 centres in 23 countries; see appendix 
p 22 for patient recruitment by region and country), 409 and 408, respectively, were 
randomised to ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem, and 405 and 403, respectively, 
received study treatment and comprised the safety population (figure 1). The cMITT and CE 
populations comprised, respectively, 356 and 257 patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam 
group and 370 and 270 patients in the meropenem group. Baseline and disease characteristics 
were generally well balanced (Table 1 and appendix pp 76–77). Main reason for exclusion 
from the cMITT population was isolation of only Gram-positive pathogens at baseline (46 
[11·2%] and 31 [7·6%] patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem groups, 
respectively). Overall, 131 patients (70[17·3%] and 61 [15·1%] respectively) had important 
protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the CE population; main reasons for exclusion 
(patients could be excluded for more than one reason) were receipt of concomitant non-
protocolled antibiotics with potential impact on efficacy up to TOC (ceftazidime-avibactam 
43 [10·5%], and meropenem 46 [11·3%]) and not having response of cure or failure at TOC 
(40 [9·8%] and 37 [9·1%] patients, respectively). 
  
 
 
Page 14 
Of 817 randomised patients, 355 (43·5%) were included in the mMITT population. Baseline 
pathogens were similar between groups and as expected for patients with NP (appendix pp 
23–26). Predominant Gram-negative pathogens isolated from respiratory site or blood were 
K. pneumoniae (n=130; 36·6%) and P. aeruginosa (n=105; 29·6%); 100 patients (28·2%) 
had ≥1 ceftazidime-non-susceptible Gram-negative pathogen, including 79 with 
Enterobacteriaceae and 25 with P. aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus (58 patients; 16·3%) 
was the only Gram-positive pathogen to be isolated in ≥10 patients. Ceftazidime and 
ceftazidime-avibactam MIC90 values were >32 mg/L and 0·5 mg/L, respectively, against 317 
isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, and >32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively, against 101 isolates 
of P. aeruginosa tested at the central laboratory. Among these isolates, 79/317 (24·9%) 
Enterobacteriaceae and 25/101 (24·8%) P. aeruginosa were non-susceptible to ceftazidime 
by CLSI criteria (MIC >4 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae and MIC >8 mg/L for P. 
aeruginosa); thus, the ceftazidime-avibactam MIC distribution was left-shifted compared 
with that of ceftazidime alone (appendix p 84). Meropenem MIC90 values against the same 
isolates were 0·12 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae and >8 mg/L for P. aeruginosa. Two isolates 
of K. pneumoniae and nine isolates of P. aeruginosa were resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam 
(MIC >8 mg/L), and six isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (five K. pneumoniae and one Serratia 
marcescens) and 31 isolates of P. aeruginosa were non-susceptible to meropenem (MIC 
>2 mg/L); among these isolates, two K. pneumoniae and eight P. aeruginosa were non-
susceptible to both study drugs. 
In the mMITT population, 203 (57·2%) patients had monomicrobial infections and 152 
(42·8%) patients had polymicrobial infections; 66 (18·6%) patients had a mixture of Gram-
negative and Gram-positive pathogens. These results were balanced between treatment 
groups and were generally similar for the extended-ME and the ME populations. 
  
 
 
Page 15 
Non-inferiority of ceftazidime-avibactam to meropenem was demonstrated in both co-
primary analysis populations (figure 2). Clinical cure rates at TOC were 245/356 (68·8%) for 
ceftazidime-avibactam and 270/370 (73·0%) for meropenem (difference [95% CI], –4·2  
[–10·76, 2·46], p=0·007) in the cMITT population and 199/257 (77·4%) and 211/270 
(78·1%), respectively (difference [95% CI], –0·7 [–7·86, 6·39], p<0·001) in the CE 
population. Similar results were observed in secondary analysis populations (appendix p85). 
Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for stratification factors, or considered patients who died 
after TOC as clinical failures at TOC, were consistent with the primary analysis (data not 
shown). In the cMITT population, 24/356 (6·7%) ceftazidime-avibactam and 33/370 (8·9%) 
meropenem patients with clinical cure at TOC received potentially effective concomitant 
antibiotics. Sensitivity analysis adjusted for treatment with potentially effective concomitant 
antibiotics (cMITT population) accounted for a 2·2% shift in treatment difference, with 
clinical cure rates of 221/356 (62·1%) for ceftazidime-avibactam and 237/370 (64·1%) for 
meropenem (difference [95% CI], –2·0 [–8·99, 5·04]). 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (figure 3) revealed no trends associated with 
various patient factors, including baseline renal status (including moderate/severe renal 
impairment and augmented renal function), prior systemic antibiotic use, type of infection (ie, 
non-VAP or VAP and early vs late VAP), and APACHE II score category. Cure rates were 
generally comparable across treatment groups and similar in both co-primary populations in 
each subgroup, including among non-VAP and VAP patients. Clinical cure rates were similar 
across treatment groups in the exploratory analysis of patients who received concomitant 
aminoglycosides (either ≤72 hours or >72 hours; appendix pp 274–28) and those who did not. 
Per-pathogen clinical cure rates at TOC were generally comparable between treatment 
groups, with numerical differences containing wide CIs among individual bacterial species 
  
 
 
Page 16 
(Table 2). Results of other secondary efficacy analyses are presented in the appendix (pp 
296–72, 85). Per-pathogen clinical cure rates at TOC among patients infected with 
ceftazidime-non-susceptible pathogens (appendix pp 64–66) were comparable between 
groups (29/36 [80·6%] for ceftazidime-avibactam and 32/41 [78·0%] for meropenem; 
difference [95% CI] 2·5% [–16·42, 20·74]), and were similar to those in patients with only 
ceftazidime-susceptible pathogens isolated at baseline (63/84 [75·0%] vs 69/88 [78·4%]; 
difference [95% CI] –3·4% [–16·18, 9·30]). 
Of the 62 MSRIBorig patients, 58 were included in the cMITT population and 44 were 
included in the CE population. Clinical cure rates at TOC among these patients were 18/30 
(60·0%) vs. 16/28 (57·1%), and 15/21 (71·4%) vs. 13/23 (56·5%), respectively. 
All-cause mortality rates were similar across treatment groups at both TOC and Day 28. In 
the cMITT population, mortality rates at TOC were 29/356 (8·1%) in the ceftazidime-
avibactam group and 25/370 (6·8%) in the meropenem group (difference [95% CI], 1·4  
[–2·48, 5·35]), and were 30/356 (8·4%) and 27/370 (7·3%), (difference [95% CI], 1·1 [–2·84, 
5·18]), respectively at Day 28. Respective rates in the CE population were 11/257 (4·3%) and 
8/270 (3·0%; difference [95% CI], 1·3 [–2·01, 4·89]) at TOC and 12/257 (4·7%) and 9/270 
(3·3%; difference [95% CI], 1·3 [–2·14, 5·04]) at Day 28. 
Per-patient favourable microbiological response rates at TOC were generally lower than 
clinical cure rates, but were similar across treatment groups and consistent across the mMITT 
(ceftazidime-avibactam 95/171 [55·6%] vs meropenem 118/184 [64·1%]; difference [95% 
CI], –8·6 [–18·65, 1·64]), eME (80/125 [64·0%] vs 89/131 [67·9%]; difference [95% CI],  
–3·9 [–15·49, 7·66]) and ME (70/107 [65·4%] vs 83/118 [70·3%]; difference [95% CI], –4·9 
[–17·10, 7·28]) populations. In patients infected with ceftazidime-non-susceptible pathogens, 
per-patient favourable microbiological response rates were similar between groups at EOT 
  
 
 
Page 17 
and TOC in the mMITT, eME and ME populations (appendix p 67), and were similar to the 
overall per-patient favourable microbiological response rates. 
Favourable per-pathogen microbiological response (eradication or presumed eradication) 
rates at TOC were similar between groups, with numerical differences containing wide CIs 
among individual bacterial species (Table 2). Per-pathogen eradication rates at TOC (eME 
population) for common Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 75·0% to 90·9% for ceftazidime-
avibactam and from 60·0% to 88·9% for meropenem; respective eradication rates for P. 
aeruginosa were 42·9% and 40·0% (Table 2). 
Persistence with increasing MIC (≥4-fold MIC increase) at EOT and/or TOC was observed in 
2/125 (1·6%) patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam group and 11/131 (8·4%) patients in the 
meropenem group. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing showed that organisms with increasing 
MIC with the same genotype as the baseline isolate occurred in one patient in the 
ceftazidime-avibactam group (K. pneumoniae), and 11 patients in the meropenem group (nine 
P. aeruginosa, one K. pneumoniae, one with both P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae). Rates 
of emergent infections (eME population; appendix p 73) were low across both treatment 
groups. New infections were identified in 5/125 (4·0%) and 6/131 (4·6%) patients treated 
with ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem, respectively. Three (2·3%) superinfections and 
three (2·3%) new infections were identified with P. aeruginosa, all in the meropenem group. 
Rates of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) are shown in Table 3. Overall, ≥1 AE occurred in 
302/405 (74·6%) and 299/403 (74·2%) patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem 
groups, respectively; AEs were considered treatment-related in 66/405 (16·3%) and 54/403 
(13·4%) patients, and were of severe intensity in 66/405 (16·3%) and 51/403 (12·7%) 
patients, respectively. Few AEs resulted in discontinuation of the study drug (ceftazidime-
avibactam 16/405 [4·0%], meropenem 11/403 [2·7%]; appendix p 74). AEs reported in ≥5% 
  
 
 
Page 18 
of patients in either group comprised diarrhoea (see appendix p 83 for narrative of diarrhoea 
AEs), hypokalaemia, anaemia, constipation and vomiting. No clinically meaningful trends or 
changes in haematological values, clinical chemistry parameters, coagulation results or 
urinalysis results were identified, and no clinical changes of concern were noted for vital 
signs or electrocardiograms in either treatment group. 
SAEs occurred in 75/405 (18·5%) and 54/403 (13·4%) patients in the ceftazidime-avibactam 
and meropenem groups, respectively. The most commonly reported SAEs were in the system 
organ classes of infections and infestations; respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders; 
and cardiac disorders. Four patients (1·0%) in the ceftazidime-avibactam group (and none in 
the meropenem group) had an SAE that was considered by investigators as possibly related to 
the study drug, and two of these led to study drug discontinuation. These SAEs comprised 
diarrhoea in a male aged 22 years, acute coronary syndrome in a male aged 79, subacute 
hepatic failure in a female aged 33, and liver function test abnormal in a male aged 22; all 
were recovered/resolved or recovering/resolving at the time of the FPFU visit. Safety data for 
the 62 MSRIBorig patients are presented in the appendix (p 80).

Discussion 
REPROVE is the first phase 3 study of ceftazidime-avibactam in adults with NP (including 
VAP), and the first randomised controlled trial to our knowledge to demonstrate non-
inferiority of a new antimicrobial therapy versus a carbapenem targeting Gram-negative 
pathogens in this setting. The results demonstrate non-inferiority of ceftazidime-avibactam 
versus meropenem for the treatment of NP (including VAP) caused by ceftazidime-non-
susceptible or ceftazidime-susceptible Gram-negative aerobic pathogens. The safety profile 
of ceftazidime-avibactam was comparable to that of the well-established safety profile of 
ceftazidime alone and consistent with the known profile of ceftazidime-avibactam.20-24 No 
new safety concerns were identified; the overall pattern of AEs and SAEs was reflective of 
the underlying disease and co-morbidities in this patient population. Although there was a 
numerical difference in the reported incidence of SAEs, most were unrelated to study 
treatment. There were no new trends in SAEs compared with previous trials of ceftazidime-
avibactam.20-24 
Baseline pathogens were as expected for NP,3,4 and balanced between treatment groups. In 
the mMITT population, 73·0% of patients were infected with Enterobacteriaceae (36·6% K. 
pneumoniae, 13·5% Enterobacter cloacae), and 29·6% with P. aeruginosa. Overall, 28·2% 
of patients had Gram-negative isolates that were non-susceptible to ceftazidime. Two K. 
pneumoniae and nine P. aeruginosa isolates at baseline were resistant to ceftazidime-
avibactam, and five K. pneumoniae and 31 P. aeruginosa were non-susceptible to 
meropenem. 
Per-patient favourable microbiological response rates were generally lower than clinical cure 
rates, but similar across treatment groups. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to previous 
antibiotic trials, albeit in community-acquired pneumonia,25,26 no improvement was observed 
  
 
 
Page 20 
in clinical cure rates for patients who received ≤24 hours of prior antibiotics compared with 
patients who did not receive prior antibiotics in either treatment group. These findings may 
have implications for future NP clinical trial design, such as potentially extending permitted 
prior antibiotic use to a period greater than the current convention of ≤24 h. 
All randomised patients were to receive concomitant aminoglycoside for a minimum of 48–
72 hours unless they were known to have a carbapenem-susceptible Gram-negative pathogen 
or low risk of infection with a resistant pathogen. Interestingly, the exploratory analysis of 
clinical cure rates among patients who received concomitant aminoglycoside (either ≤72 
hours or >72 hours exposure) revealed no differences compared with patients not receiving 
concomitant aminoglycosides. The favourable clinical outcomes observed with either 
ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem without aminoglycoside should be interpreted with 
caution, however, since REPROVE was not designed to evaluate monotherapy (�-lactam 
alone) versus combination therapy (�-lactam plus aminoglycoside). 
The observation that persistence of an organism with increasing MIC with the same genotype 
as the baseline isolate occurred in 11 patients in the meropenem group (vs one patient in the 
ceftazidime-avibactam group) may have an impact on clinicians’ choice of empiric antibiotic 
therapy in the future for patients deemed to be at higher risk of NP recurrence, particularly 
for those with P. aeruginosa infections. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint revealed no trends in treatment differences across 
various patient subgroups. Despite initial expectations, no difference was observed in clinical 
cure rates among non-VAP versus VAP patients. This might be related to continuing 
improvements over time in care of VAP patients, and possibly to the use of a standard 
comparator (meropenem) in this trial. Also, some patients diagnosed as non-VAP 
subsequently required mechanical ventilation. Clinical cure rates were similar between 
  
 
 
Page 21 
groups for patients with augmented renal clearance, normal renal function/mild impairment 
or moderate to severe impairment. 
During the early stages of REPROVE, results from the RECLAIM 1 and 2 studies became 
available,20 suggesting the potential for underdosing of ceftazidime-avibactam with the 
protocolled dosage regimen in patients with moderate/severe renal impairment. Thus, the 
REPROVE protocol was amended to increase the ceftazidime-avibactam dose for such 
patients, and the 62 patients with MSRIBorig were excluded from the main analyses. Efficacy 
and safety results in these patients were consistent with the overall population; however, the 
small number of patients in this subgroup prevents definitive conclusions. The amended 
dosage modifications are supported by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses27 and 
reflect the approved product labelling.28,29 
Mortality rates for NP are influenced by multiple factors, and reported rates vary 
substantially. All-cause mortality rates at Day 28 (cMITT population) were 8·4% in the 
ceftazidime-avibactam group and 7·3% in the meropenem group, somewhat lower than some 
other investigators have reported;3 however, REPROVE recruited a representative patient 
population in terms of VAP/non-VAP, APACHE II score and prior antibiotics use within the 
confines of a clinical study. Patients were not enrolled if they had concurrent morbidities 
preventing accurate disease assessment, or if they had a high likelihood of dying within the 
treatment period despite delivery of adequate antibiotics for NP; this is likely to be reflected 
in the overall mortality rates. A key limitation of this trial is that it is unable to determine the 
optimum duration of treatment with either ceftazidime-avibactam or meropenem (as noted 
above it is also unable to determine the relative benefits and risks of adding aminoglycosides 
to either regimen), and hence it does not provide any additional information that impacts on 
the current standard of care with respect to these aspects of patient management. Moreover, 
  
 
 
Page 22 
various aspects of the design, particularly the duration of study treatment of 7–14 days, while 
consistent with guidelines available at the start of the study,30 may be unrepresentative of 
current real-life practice and guidelines, which typically involve antibiotic de-escalation 
based on culture results. Similarly, the mode of meropenem administration (30 minute 
infusions every 8 hours), although consistent with the approved label and guidelines,3,30 may 
not reflect current practice (some institutions employ prolonged or continuous infusions). 
Such design constraints are common in non-inferiority trials where careful efforts to avoid 
confounding the results and falsely concluding non-inferiority are required. Moreover, the 
small numbers of patients with bacteraemia limits the applicability of the results to septic 
patients. 
In summary, these results confirm the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam for the 
treatment of NP, including VAP. Consistent with other phase 3 trial results in patients with 
complicated intra-abdominal or urinary tract infections, which have consistently 
demonstrated the non-inferiority of ceftazidime-avibactam to carbapenem comparators,20-22 
the data also support a role for ceftazidime-avibactam as a carbapenem-sparing strategy for 
serious Gram-negative infections (including NP).

Terms defined according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity (version 18.1). AE=adverse event. FPFU=Final 
Protocol Follow Up. SAE=serious adverse event. Data are n (%). *Patients with multiple AEs in the same category were 
counted only once in that category. Patients with AEs in more than one category were counted once in each of those 
categories. †Excludes patients who died due to disease progression. ‡Excludes one patient in each group with an AE with 
onset before FPFU, that had an outcome of death post-FPFU. §An SAE was defined as any event occurring during any study 
phase that fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: resulted in death; was immediately life-threatening; required in-
  
 
 
Page 34 
patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; was a congenital abnormality or birth defect; was an 
important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Deaths due to disease progression were not counted as SAEs.
