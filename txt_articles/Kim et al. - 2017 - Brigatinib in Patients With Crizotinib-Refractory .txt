Purpose
Most crizotinib-treated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)–rearranged non–small-
cell lung cancer (ALK-positive NSCLC) eventually experience disease progression. We evaluated
two regimens of brigatinib, an investigational next-generation ALK inhibitor, in crizotinib-refractory
ALK-positive NSCLC.
Patients and Methods
Patients were stratified by brain metastases and best response to crizotinib. They were randomly
assigned (1:1) to oral brigatinib 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at
90 mg (180 mg once daily [with lead-in]; arm B). Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response
rate (ORR) was the primary end point.
Results
Of 222 patients enrolled (arm A: n = 112, 109 treated; arm B: n = 110, 110 treated), 154 (69%) had
baseline brain metastases and 164 of 222 (74%) had received prior chemotherapy. With 8.0-month
median follow-up, investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 45% (97.5% CI, 34% to 56%) in arm A
and 54% (97.5% CI, 43% to 65%) in arm B. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival
was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and
B, respectively. Independent review committee–assessed intracranial ORR in patients with mea-
surable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18
patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/
40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/
34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2. A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset
(median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade $ 3, 3%); none
occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with
brigatinib.
Conclusion
Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-
free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable
safety.

INTRODUCTION
In approximately 5% of patients with non–small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic lymphoma
kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements encode an on-
cogenic fusion protein.1,2 Treatment with crizotinib,
the first ALK inhibitor approved for use in meta-
static ALK-rearranged (ALK-positive) NSCLC, has
yielded objective response rates (ORRs) of 61% to
74% and median progression-free survival (PFS) of
approximately 8 to 11 months in patients with
advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.3-5 Most crizotinib-
treated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC even-
tually experience progression, because of acquired
changes in the dominant biology of the cancer, poor
CNS drug penetration resulting in CNS progression,
or both.6-8

 Mechanisms of acquired resistance to crizotinib typically
involve changes in the ALK gene or activation of signaling
pathways that bypass ALK.9-11 Second-generation ALK inhibitors
currently approved in the postcrizotinib setting, ceritinib and
alectinib, have been associated with a median PFS of 5.7 to
6.9 months12-14 and 8.1 to 8.9 months,15,16 respectively. How-
ever, secondary ALK kinase domain mutations, including the
recalcitrant G1202R mutation, have been identified in patients
whose disease progressed with ceritinib or alectinib after crizo-
tinib therapy.17-19 Therefore, additional ALK inhibitors that are
effective against (and can suppress the development of) a broader
array of ALK mutations are needed.
Brigatinib (AP26113; ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
MA), an investigational next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, was designed for potent activity against a broad range
of ALK resistance mutations.20 In preclinical models, brigatinib
potently inhibited all ALK resistance mutations tested, including
G1202R, and overcame mechanisms of resistance to other ALK
inhibitors at clinically achievable brigatinib levels.21 In an on-
going phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01449461), brigatinib yielded
promising antitumor activity (confirmed ORR, 62%; median
PFS, 12.9 months) in patients with advanced ALK-positive
NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib.22 However, during
dose escalation and an initial phase II expansion at 180 mg once
daily, a small proportion of patients had moderate or severe
pulmonary adverse events (AEs) with early onset (usually within
24 to 48 hours) that were observed more frequently at higher
starting doses. The phase II expansion therefore explored two
additional regimens, 90 mg once daily and 180 mg once daily with
a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg (180 mg once daily [with lead-in]). These
regimens had similar preliminary activity and acceptable overall
safety; 180 mg once daily (with lead-in) seemed to reduce early
pulmonary AE frequency while providing greater treatment
exposure.22,23
On the basis of phase I/II trial results, we conducted a ran-
domized phase II trial to prospectively assess brigatinib efficacy and
safety at 90 mg once daily and 180 mg once daily (with lead-in) in
patients with crizotinib-refractory advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
The ALK in Lung Cancer Trial of AP26113 (ALTA trial; ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT02094573) is an ongoing open-label, randomized,
multicenter, international phase II study. Eligible patients ($ 18 years of
age) had locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, investigator-
determined disease progression while receiving crizotinib, at least one
measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1),24 adequate organ and hematologic function,
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status # 2. Pa-
tients must not have received any prior ALK inhibitor other than crizo-
tinib; crizotinib within 3 days of the first brigatinib dose; cytotoxic
chemotherapy, investigational agents, or radiation therapy (except ste-
reotactic [body] radiosurgery) within 14 days; or monoclonal antibodies
within 30 days. Patients were excluded on the basis of a history or presence
of pulmonary interstitial disease or drug-related pneumonitis, or symp-
tomatic CNS metastases that were neurologically unstable or required an
increasing dose of corticosteroids. Any number of prior chemotherapy
regimens was allowed. The protocol (Data Supplement) lists complete
inclusion/exclusion criteria and was approved by the local institutional
review board or ethics committee at each site. This study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for
Harmonisation guidelines for good clinical practice. All patients provided
written informed consent.
Procedures
Patients were stratified by baseline brain metastases (present v absent)
and best investigator-assessed response to crizotinib (complete response
[CR] or partial response [PR] v other or unknown) and were randomly
assigned (1:1) to 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with
a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg (180 mg once daily [with lead-in]; arm B).
Treatment continued until disease progression requiring alternative
systemic therapy, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Treatment
in either arm could be continued at the investigator’s discretion after
progression. Patients in arm A could receive brigatinib 180 mg once
daily after objective progression at 90 mg once daily. Dose interruptions
or reductions were allowed to manage treatment-related AEs, on the
basis of the investigator’s judgment. AEs were graded with National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 4.0.
At screening, disease assessment (per RECIST v1.1) included chest
and abdomen imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) with contrast. Contrast-enhanced brain MRI was required
at screening and was repeated postbaseline for patients with CNS me-
tastases. A central independent review committee (IRC) reviewed on-study
images. Disease was assessed every 8 weeks through cycle 15 (28 days per
cycle), and then every 12 weeks until progression. Objective responses were
confirmed $ 4 weeks after initial response.
Visits were scheduled to occur on days 1, 8, and 15 of the first 28-day
cycle and then every 4 weeks (starting on day 1 of cycle 2), at treatment
discontinuation, and at 30 days post-treatment. On days 8 and 15, patients
were assessed for early pulmonary symptoms. Follow-up for survival and
subsequent therapy continued every 3 months after treatment discon-
tinuation. The protocol includes the assessment schedule.
Outcomes
The primary end point was confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 (per
investigator). Secondary end points included confirmed ORR (per central
IRC), CNS response (IRC-assessed intracranial confirmed ORR and PFS in
patients with active brain metastases), duration of response, PFS, overall
survival (OS), safety, tolerability, and patient-reported symptoms of lung
cancer and health-related quality-of-life (QoL) scores assessed with the
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL
questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0), including mean trans-
formed global health status/QoL score (on the basis of questions 29 and
30). Active brain metastases were defined as lesions without prior ra-
diotherapy or with investigator-assessed progression after prior radio-
therapy. Intracranial response was defined as a $ 30% decrease in
measurable lesions or complete disappearance of lesions in patients with
only nonmeasurable lesions.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of $ 109 patients in each arm provides approximately
90% power to rule out an ORR of 20% when the true ORR is $ 35% with
a two-sided alpha level of 0.025. Efficacy was evaluated in the intention-to-
treat population. Patients with baseline brain metastases (by IRC assess-
ment) were included in IRC analyses of intracranial efficacy. Patients who
received any brigatinib were included in the safety population. CIs were
calculated using the exact binomial method; 97.5% CIs were estimated for
confirmed ORR (primary end point), and 95% CIs were used for other end
points. For time-to-event efficacy analyses (duration of response, PFS, and
OS), median values and two-sided 95% CIs were estimated using Kaplan-
Meier methods. Investigator-assessed efficacy data and all safety data
are reported as of February 29, 2016. IRC-assessed whole-body and

 intracranial efficacy data had last scan dates of May 16, 2016, and April 14,
2016, respectively. The trial was not designed for statistical comparisons
between arms; however, post hoc hazard ratios were estimated for PFS to
support dose selection. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 9.4).
RESULTS
Patients
Between June 4, 2014, and September 21, 2015, 222 patients
were enrolled at 71 centers in 18 countries. Patients were randomly
assigned to brigatinib in arm A (90 mg once daily; n = 112) or arm
B (180 mg with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg [180 mg once daily (with
lead-in)]; n = 110; Fig 1). Three patients in arm A were never
treated and are included in intention-to-treat analyses. Overall,
arms were balanced for baseline factors, including sex, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, brain metas-
tases, prior chemotherapy, and best response to prior crizotinib
(Table 1). Of 222 patients, 154 (69%) had brain metastases at
baseline per investigators, 164 (74%) had prior chemotherapy, 144
(65%) had a best response of CR or PR to prior crizotinib, and 69
(31%) were Asian. As of February 29, 2016, 64 patients (57%) in
arm A and 76 patients (69%) in arm B remained on study
treatment, with median (range) follow-ups of 7.8 (0.1 to 16.7)
months and 8.3 (0.1 to 20.2) months, respectively.
Efficacy
Investigator-assessed efficacy. Response rates are shown in
Table 2. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 45% (97.5% CI,
34% to 56%) in arm A, including one CR, and 54% (97.5% CI,
43% to 65%) in arm B, including four CRs. Confirmed ORR in
patients with prior chemotherapy was 42% (35 of 83 patients) in
arm A and 54% (44 of 81 patients) in arm B; in patients without
prior chemotherapy, confirmed ORRs were 52% (15 of 29 patients)
in each arm. One patient in arm B with a G1202R mutation
detected from tumor tissue at baseline had a confirmed PR. The
median time to response was rapid: 1.8 months (range, 1.7 to
9.1 months) and 1.9 months (1.0 to 11.0 months) in arms A and B,
respectively. As of data cutoff, the median duration of response was
13.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 13.8) in arm A (with 14 [28%] events
in 50 responders) and 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 13.8) in arm B
(with 12 [20%] events in 59 responders). The change from baseline
in target lesions is shown in Fig 2A. Investigator-assessed median
PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (11.1 to
not reached) in arms A and B, respectively (Fig 2B). The PFS
hazard ratio was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.86; arm B v A). Pre-
liminary OS estimates are shown in Fig 2C. The 1-year OS
probability was 71% (95% CI, 60% to 79%) and 80% (67% to
88%) in arms A and B, respectively.
IRC-assessed
whole-body efficacy. IRC-assessed confirmed
ORR was 48% (95% CI, 39% to 58%) and 53% (95% CI, 43% to
62%), with four and five CRs, in arms A and B, respectively. The
median duration of response was 13.8 months (95% CI, 7.4 to not
reached) in arm A and 13.8 months (95% CI, 9.3 to not reached) in
arm B. The IRC-assessed median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4
to not reached) and 15.6 months (11.0 to not reached) in arms A
and B, respectively (Data Supplement).
IRC-assessed intracranial efficacy. Of 222 patients, 217 had an
IRC-evaluated baseline brain MR image; 153 had baseline brain
metastases and 44 had measurable lesions. Table 3 shows intra-
cranial response rates. The IRC-assessed intracranial ORR in
patients with measurable baseline brain metastases was 42% (11 of
26 patients; 95% CI, 23% to 63%) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18
patients; 95% CI, 41% to 87%) in arm B. Within each arm, re-
sponse rates were similar among all patients with measurable
baseline brain metastases and those with active brain metastases
(lesions without prior radiotherapy or with investigator-assessed
progression after prior radiotherapy). In patients with only
nonmeasurable baseline brain metastases, 7% (four of 54 patients;

 95% CI, 2% to 18%) in arm A and 18% (10 of 55 patients; 95% CI,
9% to 31%) in arm B had complete resolution of intracranial
lesions. The change from baseline in measurable brain lesions is
shown in Fig 3A. In patients with intracranial response, the median
duration of intracranial response was not reached (95% CIs:
3.7 months to not reached, arm A; 5.6 months to not reached, arm
B). The median intracranial PFS was 15.6 months (95% CI, 7.3 to
15.7) and 12.8 months (11.0 to not reached) in arms A and B,
respectively (Fig 3B).
Safety
AEs. The most common any-grade treatment-emergent AEs
(TEAEs) included GI symptoms (nausea, 33%/40% and diarrhea,
19%/38%, in arms A/B, respectively), headache (28%/27%, arms
A/B), and cough (18%/34%, arms A/B; Table 4). Some TEAEs
seemed to be dose related, although differences were mainly in
grade 1 to 2 events. The most common grade $ 3 TEAEs (ex-
cluding neoplasm progression) were hypertension (6%/6%, arms
A/B), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (3%/9%, arms A/B),

 pneumonia (3%/5%, arms A/B), and increased lipase (4%/3%,
arms A/B).
Pulmonary AEs with early onset. A subset of pulmonary AEs
with early onset (median time to onset, 2 days [range, 1 to 9 days])
that included dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, pneumonia, or pneumo-
nitis occurred in 14 patients (6%); seven patients (3%) had
grade $ 3 events (Data Supplement). These AEs occurred at 90 mg,
in both arms, and no such events occurred after escalation to
180 mg. They were managed with dose interruption and successful
reintroduction of brigatinib in six of 14 patients, and one patient
continued treatment with resolution of symptoms after dose re-
duction to 60 mg once daily without needing interruption. Seven
patients discontinued treatment, including one patient who died
on day 7, after experiencing dyspnea, cough, and pneumonia. This
patient’s autopsy revealed lymphangitic carcinomatosis, wide-
spread lung scarring, and diffuse alveolar damage. Pathologist-
reported causes of death were lung cancer, adhesive pericarditis,
and respiratory failure. A multivariable analysis evaluated the
impact of baseline risk factors on the development of pulmonary
AEs with early onset (Data Supplement). Older age and shorter
interval (, 7 days) between the last crizotinib dose and the first
brigatinib dose were significantly associated with an increased
event rate. Baseline characteristics for patients receiving crizoti-
nib , 7 versus $ 7 days before brigatinib are shown in the Data
Supplement.
Dose modifications. Dose reduction as the result of any AE
occurred in 7% (eight of 109) and 20% (22 of 110) of treated
patients in arms A and B, respectively. Dose interruption
($ 3 days) for any reason occurred in 18% (20 of 109) and 36%
(40 of 110) of patients in arms A and B, respectively. The median
dose intensity was 90 mg per day in arm A and 174 mg per day in
arm B. The most common reasons for dose reduction were in-
creased blood creatine phosphokinase (n = 2, arm A/n = 5, arm
B), pneumonitis (n = 1, arm A/n = 2, arm B), and rash (n = 1,
arm A/n = 2, arm B). Eight patients (4%) died within 30 days
of the last dose (excluding those who died as a result of neo-
plasm progression, malignant pleural effusion, and metastases
to meninges). Investigator-reported reasons for death in-
cluded pneumonia (n = 2; one case was an early pulmonary AE),
bacterial meningitis (n = 1), dyspnea (n = 1), pulmonary em-
bolism (n = 1), respiratory failure (n = 1), sudden death (n = 1),
and urosepsis (n = 1).
QoL
The mean transformed global health status/QoL score (on the
basis of questions 29 and 30 of EORTC QLQ-C30) gradually
increased through approximately month 7 and then slowly de-
clined, but remained higher than baseline values (Data Supple-
ment). No significant differences between arms were observed at
baseline or during follow-up.
DISCUSSION
Brigatinib demonstrated substantial efficacy with both regimens.
Objective response rates were high, and responses occurred
quickly and were durable in both arms. Efficacy outcomes favored
the higher dose, most notably in PFS and intracranial re-
sponses. At 180 mg (with lead-in at 90 mg), the confirmed ORR
was 54% (59 of 110 patients), and the intracranial ORR was
67% for patients with measurable brain metastases. The median
PFS was . 1 year by investigator assessment (12.9 months) and
by IRC assessment (15.6 months), and the estimated 1-year OS
was 80%.
Objective response rates for ALK inhibitors in the post-
crizotinib setting (brigatinib, ceritinib, and alectinib) seem
similar across most trials, at 50% to 56%,13,15,16,25 although
somewhat different patient populations and methods of as-
sessment limit comparison. These response rates probably
reflect comparable activity against dominant crizotinib-resistant
clones. However, any differences among these drugs in their ability
to suppress clinically relevant ALK mutations, including those
that may not be dominant initially but could emerge later, are
more likely to be reflected in PFS or duration of response.12-16,21
In preclinical models, brigatinib had broader predicted muta-
tion coverage, compared with ceritinib and alectinib.21 Con-
sistent with this observation, in the phase I/II trial of brigatinib,
the median PFS of patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC
who previously received crizotinib (most of whom received
180 mg per day, with or without lead-in at 90 mg) was recently
reported as 12.9 months, across all doses tested.22 This extended
PFS, relative to ceritinib12-14 and alectinib15,16 results, is sub-
stantiated by the median PFS of . 1 year in arm B of ALTA.
Additionally, a patient with the recalcitrant G1202R mutation
had a confirmed PR, as predicted by preclinical data. A limitation

 of the current study is that the randomized selection design
did not include formal statistical PFS and OS comparisons
between arms.
The safety profile in this study was consistent with that
previously reported for brigatinib22,23 and was acceptable in both
arms. The frequency of any individual grade $ 3 AE was low in
both arms. Dose modifications and discontinuations as the result
of AEs were more common with 180 mg (with lead-in). Dose-
reduction rates were 20% (arm B) versus 7% (arm A). In contrast,
at the recommended starting doses of ceritinib and alectinib, re-
ported dose-reduction rates are 58% and 23%, respectively.26,27
Beyond tolerability, the impact of dose reductions on efficacy,
particularly CNS efficacy, should be considered. The intracranial
ORR of 67% in patients with measurable brain metastases who
received 180 mg (with lead-in) in this study compares favorably
with second-generation ALK-inhibitor data.28,29 The CNS benefit
seems to be sustained with a median intracranial PFS . 1 year in
both arms and the median durations of intracranial response not
being reached. Health-related QoL remained at or higher than
baseline levels and did not differ between arms.
The current results confirm phase I/II observations regarding
pulmonary AEs with early onset.23 In the phase I/II trial, the
frequency of these AEs seemed to be related to starting dose; a lead-
in dose of 90 mg once daily for 1 week before escalation to 180 mg
once daily seemed to reduce the risk of these AEs compared with
starting at 180 mg once daily. In ALTA, all early pulmonary AEs
occurred at 90 mg (in arm A or before dose escalation in arm B); no
such events occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B.
Therefore, the efficacy of 180 mg (with lead-in) was not associated
with an increased risk of additional early pulmonary AEs, com-
pared with 90 mg. Pulmonary toxicity, including pneumonitis and
interstitial lung disease, has been observed with crizotinib, cer-
itinib, and alectinib in similar patient populations26,27,30; however,
rapid onset in the small subset of brigatinib-treated patients with
these AEs, and the potential to tolerize and continue dosing,
suggest a different underlying etiology that is unknown. Patients

 treated with brigatinib should be monitored for new or worsening
respiratory symptoms, particularly during the first week of
treatment. Management of early pulmonary AEs should include
dose interruption and prompt clinical evaluation.
In conclusion, efficacy and safety in the phase II ALTA trial
support future trials with the 180-mg regimen (with lead-in at
90 mg). On the basis of these results, brigatinib seems to be
a promising new treatment option for crizotinib-refractory ALK-
positive NSCLC. Brigatinib is currently being investigated in
a randomized, phase III trial of brigatinib (180 mg [with lead-in])
versus crizotinib in ALK inhibitor–na¨
ıve patients (ALTA-1L;
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02737501).
