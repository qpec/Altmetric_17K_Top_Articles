 excluded if they had a diagnosis of ALS, another neurodegenerative condition, or a family history 
of ALS in a first- or second-degree blood relative. Additional exclusions included age less than 18 
or inability to communicate in English.
Main Outcome and Measure(s)—Cases and controls completed a survey assessing 
occupational and residential exposures. Blood concentrations of 122 persistent environmental 
pollutants, including organochlorine pesticides (OCP), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 
brominated flame retardants (BFRs), were measured using gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry. Multivariable models with self-reported occupational exposures in various exposure 
time windows and environmental toxin blood concentrations were separately fit by logistic 
regression models. Concordance between the survey data and pollutant measurements was 
assessed using the nonparametric Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficient.
Results—Survey data revealed that reported pesticide exposure in the cumulative exposure 
windows was significantly associated with ALS (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 1.85–14.0). Military 
service was also associated with ALS in two time windows. A multivariable model of measured 
persistent environmental pollutants in the blood, representing cumulative occupational and 
residential exposure, showed increased odds of ALS for 2 OCPs, 2 PCBs, and 1 BFR. There was 
modest concordance between survey data and the measurements of persistent environmental 
pollutants in blood.
Conclusions and Relevance—Persistent environmental pollutants measured in blood are 
significantly associated with ALS. These environmental pollutants may represent a modifiable 
ALS disease risk factor and should be further studied.
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease.1 Toxic 
exposures, combined with genetic susceptibility, may trigger motor neuron degeneration 
explained via the gene-time-environment hypothesis.2
In Michigan, geographic variations in ALS death rates may correspond to locations of 
environmental toxins identified by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxics Release 
Inventory3 and National Priorities List.4 We hypothesized that toxic exposures are more 
likely to be identified in ALS subjects compared to healthy controls. Organochlorine 
pesticides (OCPs),5 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, electrical insulation),6 and 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, brominated flame retardant (BFRs))7 are of 
particular interest as potential ALS risk factors due to known neurotoxic properties and high 
persistence in the environment and body.
In 2011, we initiated a case-control study to evaluate ALS environmental risk factors with 
the strength of combining assessments of environmental pollutants in blood with detailed 
exposure reporting. Importantly, the ability to validate self-reported exposures with 
biospecimens is necessary for large scale efforts identifying ALS risk factors. We previously 
showed that reported pesticide exposure is associated with ALS.8 This report extends and 
advances our previous work by incorporating blood measurements of persistent organic 
pollutants in conjunction with reported exposures.

 METHODS
Study populations and data collection
Cases and controls were older than 18 years, and able to provide consent and communicate 
in English. All ALS patients meeting inclusion criteria with definitive, probable, probable 
with laboratory support, or possible ALS by revised El Escorial criteria9 were asked to 
participate during visits at the University of Michigan (UM) ALS Clinic; recruitment 
announcements were also sent via the National ALS Registry. Controls, recruited through 
postings and a UM clinical research volunteer database (umclinicaltrials.org), with a 
neurodegenerative condition, ALS or family history of ALS in a first- or second-degree 
blood relative were excluded. The study received Institutional Review Board approval. 
Controls received compensation.
Subjects completed a self-administered written survey, derived from Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry instruments,10 assessing residential history, occupational 
history, military services, smoking history, and demographics. Questionnaires were 
distributed in person or via mail. Telephone follow-up clarified responses as needed; next of 
kin was contacted for patients with communication impairments. Double data entry was 
performed for quality assurance in a random sample of surveys. Blood samples were 
collected for measurements of pollutants.
Data types
Demographics included age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, tobacco history, and 
military service history. Job titles, workplace, dates of employment, and 22 exposure-related 
questions assessed occupational risk factors in each job (2 most recent and 2 longest-held 
jobs, Supplement). This report focuses on occupational exposures, from which 98 candidate 
covariates were derived from exposure-related questions, including job titles and workplace 
settings for each job. Specifically, 58 identified exposure risk factors, 20 occupational 
groups, and 20 industrial groups were queried for each job. Residential exposures were 
assessed using 54 questions for the current house and 18 for the houses where the subject 
was born and the 2 houses where the subject lived the longest (Supplement). Surveys with 
>70% missing responses were excluded from further analyses.
Blood samples measured 122 persistent neurotoxic organic pollutants (OCPs, PCBs, BFRs) 
utilizing NHANES and NHEXAS methods (Supplement).11 These compounds had wide use 
and existing quality-assured measurement methods.5–7 Due to a protocol change, some 
subjects provided whole blood while others provided plasma samples. Partition coefficients 
between plasma and whole blood for all measured compounds (eTable 1) were determined 
in a small study involving 21 volunteers (data not shown) and used to covert whole blood 
concentrations to plasma concentrations (Supplement). Compounds analyzed had a detection 
frequency >30% (eTable 1).
Exposure time windows
Four exposure time windows categorized past occupational exposures: Window 1 (W1) 
indicates exposure occurred in at least one period over the entire job history; windows 2, 3

 and 4 (W2, W3, W4) respectively indicate exposures in the last 10 years, 10–30 years, and 
more than 30 years ago. Reference dates for cases and controls were symptom onset and 
survey consent date, respectively. Occupational exposure variables in each job were assigned 
to the appropriate time windows. An individual could be exposed in multiple time windows 
depending on job history.
Job-exposure matrix for occupational pesticide exposures
Lifetime cumulative occupational exposures to pesticides were derived from a job-exposure 
matrix developed using the participants’ reported job titles and workplace. The probability 
(0 ≤ P ≤ 1) and intensity of exposure (low to high: I = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) was estimated for each 
occupation and industry group based on previous studies12,13 and judgments of two 
experienced exposure scientists (F-CS, SB). Exposure scores equaled the product of 
probability and intensity and were mapped to four levels (scores = 0, 1, 2 and 3 for 
probability-intensity products of 0, 1–2, 3–6 and ≥7, respectively; eTable 2). The lifetime 
cumulative exposure was estimated by weighting exposure scores by job duration.14
Statistical analyses
Descriptive analyses, including central tendency and dispersion, characterized 
demographics, smoking status, and exposure to pollutants by case type. T-tests for 
continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables examined differences 
between cases and controls. The normality of pollutant data was evaluated using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and stratified by case type. Spearman rank-order correlations 
assessed correlations between pollutants within chemical groups.
Multivariable logistic regression models tested associations between ALS and reported 
occupational exposures. Variable selection used a three-step method. First, the 98 candidate 
covariates in W1 were fitted into a logistic regression model using the stepwise method to 
select potential risk factors. Next, identified factors, including smoking status and military 
service,15,16 were incorporated into a model with adjustments for age, gender, and education 
levels. Finally, the stepwise-selected risk factors with the largest p-values were sequentially 
excluded from the model until all remaining stepwise-selected risk factors were significant 
or marginally significant (p-values ≈ 0.05). The same covariates were used in each exposure 
time window. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests examined goodness-of-fit, with the null hypothesis 
representing that observed and predicted values of the dependent variable were not different.
Associations between ALS and pollutants were tested using two approaches. First, single 
pollutant logistic regression models provided an initial screen of the pollutant’s association. 
The Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the critical value (i.e. α/number of tests = 
0.05/28), which tends to increase the chance of false negative results. Tests of individual 
chemicals increase the likelihood of significant results by chance alone because the 
correction is conservative as a result of multiple comparisons17 and does not reflect effects 
of multiple exposures; therefore, the second approach used a multiple pollutant logistic 
regression model. This stepwise variable selection method accounts for multicollinearity 
occurring due to high correlations between pollutants. Both models adjusted for age, gender

 and educational level and used standardized pollutant levels (obtained by subtracting the 
mean and dividing by the standard deviation).
The nonparametric Kendall's Tau correlation coefficient, which measures agreement 
between rankings of two ordinal variables, examined concordance between self-reported 
risks and occupational pollutant concentrations. OCP concentrations were first partitioned 
into 5 groups, from the lowest to the highest levels, and were displayed in a matrix plot of 
the correlation coefficients. Because pollutant measurements integrate exposures that may 
occur in both occupational and residential settings, the survey questions regarding potential 
residential exposures that might account for OCP exposure were also tested.
Missing responses and exposure measurements underwent multiple imputation, provided the 
missing rate was <30%. Ten imputations for incomplete values were obtained using the 
Markov chain Monte Carlo method.18 Both observed and imputed datasets were tested.
Logistic and linear regression analyses and multiple imputations were performed in SAS 9.2 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The correlation plots used the package "corrplot" in R 
3.2.1.19
RESULTS
Descriptive analyses
One hundred fifty-six ALS cases and 128 controls were recruited (66 cases and controls 
were reported in our previous survey-only study8). Age, gender, educational level, smoking 
status and occupational risk factor information was complete for 126 cases and 118 controls. 
Pollutant measurements were performed on subjects who provided blood equaling 129 cases 
and 119 controls. Together, 101 cases and 110 controls had complete demographic and 
pollutant data.
Demographics are summarized in Table 1. Twenty-eight of the 122 persistent organic 
pollutants had detection frequencies >30% (eTable 1).
Occupational ALS risk factors by exposure time window
Of the 98 candidate occupational risk factor variables in each time window, a stepwise 
logistic regression model identified 14 risk factor variables meeting significance levels for 
entering and removing effects of 0.30 and 0.35, respectively. The question “Did you get 
material on your skin or clothing?” was excluded due to a missing rate >70%. When 
including smoking status and military service into the model and adjusting for age, gender, 
and educational levels for each window, the following 6 occupational risk factors with p-
values <0.05 comprised the final model: (1) lead exposure; (2) pesticide exposure; working 
in (3) the U.S. armed forces; (4) health care or social assistance; (5) accommodation (i.e., 
lodging) or food services; and (6) public administration (Table 2). Goodness-of-fit tests for 
the 4 models did not indicate differences between observed and predicted values (p-values 
>0.05).

 Chemical concentrations in blood and ALS
Fitted models using single pollutants are shown in Figure 1 (imputed data) and eTable 3 
(observed data). Figure 1 depicts ORs for 28 chemicals. Using the stepwise selection with 
imputed data, 10 compounds were selected into the multiple-compound model, including 4 
OCPs, 3 PCBs, and 3 BFRs (Figure 1 and Table 3); 7 were significantly associated with 
ALS (3 OCPs, 2 PCBs and 2 BFRs). Results between the single-compound models and 
multiple-compound model were similar, which may be explained by lower correlations 
between selected compounds (most correlations were <0.40, except for correlations between 
β-HCH and cis-Chlordane, and PCB 175 and PCB 202).
Concordance between survey data and pollutant exposures
As both the survey and exposure measurements showed significant associations between 
pesticide exposures and ALS, we considered the concordance of these independent datasets. 
Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients (Figure 2) showed weak agreement between OCP 
concentrations and survey-based cumulative occupational exposure to pesticides. The use of 
occupational and residential variables provided modest correlation with measurements of 
environmental pollutants, suggesting that pesticide exposure in the study population 
occurred in both occupational and residential/environmental settings and that survey data 
may help indicate the exposure source.
Sensitivity analysis in a smaller geographic region
Given the geographic variation between cases and controls, a subgroup analysis on subjects 
who lived <70 km from UM was performed. Fifty-three cases and 90 controls were selected 
to balance sample size and geographic matching. Single pollutant logistic regression models 
for all subjects and this subgroup showed high agreement for OCPs and PCBs (5 OCPs and 
2 PCBs showed significant associations with ALS before Bonferroni correction; eTable 3). 
ORs for BFRs were very similar; however, the significant associations with ALS obtained 
using all subjects (5 BFRs with significant results before Bonferroni correction) no longer 
attained statistical significance, probably due to reduced sample size. Therefore, geographic 
variation between the cases and controls was a limited confounder.
DISCUSSION
The gene-time-environment hypothesis supports the contention that toxic exposures 
combined with genetic susceptibility may trigger motor neuron degeneration and ALS.2 
Most studies assessing ALS environmental and occupational risks, however, use surveys and 
are limited by recall bias and exposure misclassification.20 Our study used both surveys and 
measurements of pollutants in blood. Notably, the survey used assesses exposure windows to 
identify periods of susceptibility for developing ALS to help clarify exposure-time 
interaction effects. Exposure to critical risk factors during such periods may have a greater 
effect than during other periods,21 but other than our previous study,8 windows of ALS 
susceptibility have not been investigated.
We report that service in the US military is statistically or marginally significant in multiple 
exposure windows, agreeing with reports that military personnel are high-risk populations

 for ALS.22–24 While triggers remain unknown,24 suspected risk factors include 
environmental exposures, multiple vaccinations, physical activity, and traumatic injury.25,26 
Similar to our initial report of survey data,8 we again found associations of ALS with 
reported occupational pesticide use and lower educational attainment. Unexpectedly, lead 
showed a statistically significant protective effect across all occupational exposure windows. 
Lead has received extensive attention as an ALS risk factor,27 and may increase survival,28 
indicating this topic deserves further attention.
Associations between persistent organic pollutants and ALS are strengthened utilizing 
biological exposure measurements. Prior studies used a small set of exposure measurements 
to assess ALS risk. Our approach of testing a large number of chemicals, contrasts to studies 
testing single compounds. Applying multipollutant models, 7 of 10 model-selected 
compounds were significantly associated with ALS (3 OCPs, 2 PCBs and 2 BFRs). Results 
between the single-compound models and multiple-compound model were similar, and 
agree with studies demonstrating an increased ALS-pesticide association.29–32 Surprisingly, 
two chemicals (PCB 151 and PBDE 66) showed protective effects. The positive association 
between PCB 151/PBDE 66 and ALS may result from correlations among co-existent 
chemicals and weak associations between the chemical themselves and the disease. The 
analysis of a large number of pollutants and other exposure metrics can increase the 
likelihood of such effects, as well as false associations resulting from multiple comparisons. 
The confidence in our results, particularly for OCPs, is increased by the agreement between 
pollutant and survey data.
Our approach is important because as persons are likely to be exposed to combinations of 
pollutants, such toxins may work in concert to activate several disease mechanisms. Similar 
methods in cognitive research show varying associations of disease risk.33–38 Environmental 
pollutants cause biological effects that overlap with hypothesized ALS mechanisms 
suggesting biologic plausibility. For example, p,p’-DDE causes sustained depolarization, 
leading to release of neurotransmitters (including glutamate) and hyperexcitability.39 PCBs, 
which accumulate in the brain, impair neurotransmitter reuptake (including glutamate), 
calcium homeostasis, and signal transduction, and accelerate cell death.40,41 That PCBs can 
modify glutamate levels is consistent with proposed ALS disease mechanisms,42 and both 
PCBs43 and PBDEs result in neuronal apoptosis in vitro.44 Finally, persistent environmental 
pollutants alter global DNA methylation,45 which may play a role in ALS pathogenesis.46 
Further work is needed to understand the aforementioned potential pathogenic implications 
in ALS.
Because survey data and blood measurements both implicated pesticide exposure in ALS, 
we examined the concordance between survey responses addressing cumulative 
occupational exposure of pesticides and actual chemical measurements of OCPs. The fact 
that we found only a weak concordance is not unsurprising. First, pollutant measurements 
reflect not only occupational exposures but also residential exposures and diet. Second, one-
time collected pollutants may not represent lifetime cumulative occupational exposures due 
to temporal variation, the finite biological half-lives of the chemicals, and sampling 
variation. Third, job exposure matrix-based estimates along with self-reported exposures 
vary in validity and reliability, despite widespread use in occupational case-control studies.47

 Fourth, many currently used pesticides are short-lived organophosphate compounds (not 
measured in the current study) and while exposure to these compounds was likely included 
in responses to the occupational survey, these short-lived compounds were not measured in 
the current study. Fifth, and finally, individuals may also falsely believe they experienced 
pesticide exposures.
The lack of concordance between survey data and actual measurements of blood pollutants 
supports the use of direct pollutant assessments when possible, particularly for compounds 
that have long half-lives, and thereby reflect both current and historical exposures. For 
example, organochlorine pesticides have environmental half-lives that potentially reach 
hundreds of years for DDT and DDE,5 and in humans, over 7 years for p,p'-DDE48 and β-
HCH.49,50 While most OCPs have been banned or restricted in the US, exposure still occurs, 
primarily through diet. As the relative contribution of diet on environmental exposures 
increases, agreement between occupational survey and pollutant data will likely even further 
decrease.
Given the case-control study design, selection and recall biases are possibilities in our study, 
and varied validity and reliability of self-reported data and single biological measurements 
may occur. Seventy percent of controls lived <20 km from UM due to the recruitment 
strategy, although a sensitivity analysis of a smaller geographic region supported the 
association of pollutants with ALS. Controls had higher educational levels, which contrasts 
to National ALS Registry data showing a higher rate of ALS in more educated persons.51 
While other ALS studies do have control groups with higher educational attainment,29 the 
use of a primarily internet-based recruitment strategy for controls may have biased the group 
towards higher socioeconomic levels. Every model adjusted for education to control for 
potential confounding. Additionally, conditional logistic regression models on a frequency 
matched dataset, matching cases with controls for age, gender, and education did not show 
changes in effect associations (eTables 8–10). Next, self-reported data typically involve 
recall bias that can lead to exposure misclassification and affect risk estimates.52 Due to a 
protocol change, the current pollutant measurements also used both plasma and whole blood 
samples, although method- and chemical-specific partition coefficients were measured and 
used to determine unified measures with very high validity (data not shown). Lastly, 
pollutant measurements weight more recent exposures; however, most chemicals measured 
in this study have long half-lives, and thus are a good indicator of historical exposure.5–7
In conclusion, our findings identify classes of pollutants that increase the likelihood of ALS 
and therefore are modifiable disease risk factors. Relative to the previous literature, the 
present study includes (1) a thorough survey assessment of occupational exposure risk 
factors over time, (2) neurotoxic occupational pollutant measurements, and (3) concordance 
testing between the survey and pollutant concentrations. We report that military service 
increases ALS risk throughout an individual’s lifetime, and survey data reveal an association 
with pesticide exposure and ALS. Measured blood pollutants, particularly OCPs, increased 
the odds of ALS across all reported time exposure windows, although there was a low 
concordance between survey reports of pesticide exposure and actual blood measurements. 
These results highlight differences in reported versus measured exposures and underscore 
the need to understand how survey responses relate to actual exposures; this understanding is

 essential in many applications, particularly large scale efforts to identify ALS risk factors 
such as the National ALS Registry. Finally, as environmental factors that affect the 
susceptibility, triggering, and progression of ALS remain largely unknown, we contend 
future studies are needed to evaluate longitudinal trends in exposure measurements, assess 
newer and non-persistent chemicals, consider pathogenic mechanisms, and assess 
phenotypic variations.53

 Figure 1. 
Results of logistic regression models for ALS and exposure pollutants using single and 
multiple chemicals.
Odds ratios (●, ▲, ■) and 95% CIs (─) were examined using standardized chemical 
concentrations from the imputed sample (n = 284, 10 imputations), and adjusted with age, 
gender and educational levels.
Single model shows the results of 28 regression models for individual compounds; multiple 
model shows the result of one regression model for 10 selected compounds.

 Figure 2. 
The matrix plot of Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients for self-reported and exposure 
pollutant data of pesticide exposures.
The OCP concentrations were partitioned into 5 groups from the lowest to the highest levels; 
the occupational cumulative exposure to pesticides was partitioned into 4 groups from the 
lowest to the highest levels; the residential variables of pesticide exposures were yes/no 
questions.
Larger circles indicate larger correlation coefficients. There was weak agreement between 
OCP concentrations and survey-based cumulative occupational exposure to pesticides 
(coefficients = −0.11 to 0.05, p-values >0.05, depending on OCP). For residential variables, 
the “use of pesticides in home or yard” was positively correlated with pentachlorobenzene 
(coefficient = 0.19, p-value <0.01), and negatively correlated with Dacthal (coefficient = 
−0.18, p-value = 0.01); “storing lawn care products in garage” was positively correlated with 
pentachlorobenzene and trans-nonachlor (coefficients = 0.15 and 0.24, p-values = 0.02 and 
<0.01 respectively); and “storing pesticides or lawn care products in garage” was positively 
correlated with pentachlorobenzene (coefficient = 0.16, p-value = 0.02).
