Previous research has demonstrated that individuals with higher intelligence are more likely
to have larger gray matter volume in brain areas predominantly located in parieto-frontal
regions. These findings were usually interpreted to mean that individuals with more cortical
brain volume possess more neurons and thus exhibit more computational capacity during
reasoning. In addition, neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligent individuals, despite
their larger brains, tend to exhibit lower rates of brain activity during reasoning. However, the
microstructural architecture underlying both observations remains unclear. By combining
advanced multi-shell diffusion tensor imaging with a culture-fair matrix-reasoning test, we
found that higher intelligence in healthy individuals is related to lower values of dendritic
density and arborization. These results suggest that the neuronal circuitry associated with
higher intelligence is organized in a sparse and efficient manner, fostering more directed
information processing and less cortical activity during reasoning.

ndividuals differ with regard to their intellectual abilities in a
manner consistent with a normal distribution. The measure
most commonly used to quantify broad mental capabilities of
an individual is that of intelligence, often termed the intelligence
quotient (IQ). Over the last century, researchers have constructed
a large number of psychometric test batteries targeting various
realms of intelligence. This line of research has created a foun-
dation for quantifying interindividual differences in intelligence
with both high reliability and validity1. It has also revealed the
importance of intelligence for predicting various aspects of
everyday life, including academic success, professional advance-
ment,
social
mobility,
physical
well-being,
and
even
life
expectancy2.
From the very beginning of intelligence research, there has
been a profound interest in linking interindividual differences
measured by psychometric test instruments to differences pos-
sessing a neurobiological substrate. Early attempts relating brain
size to intelligence can be traced to the nineteenth century, with
scientists including Pierre Paul Broca and Francis Galton
demonstrating a positive relationship between coarse measures of
head size and intellectual ability1,3. Contemporary differential
psychologists have fully embraced the possibilities of neu-
roscientific methods, especially magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) techniques. Over several decades, a large body of evidence
has consistently shown that bigger brains tend to perform better
at tasks related to intelligence. Meta-analyses have reported cor-
relation coefficients in the range of 0.24 – 0.33 for the association
between overall brain volume and intelligence4,5. This moderate
structure–function relationship can be observed for the whole
brain, its lobar volumes, and even within specific brain areas
predominantly located in parieto-frontal regions6. A common
biological explanation for this association is the fact that indivi-
duals with more cortical volume are likely to possess more
neurons7,8 and thus more computational power to engage in
problem solving and logical reasoning.
In the late 1980s, researchers made an important contribution
with regard to the biological bases of intelligence, namely, the first
PET scan conducted while performing the Raven’s Advanced
Progressive Matrices9. They found a negative correlation between
Raven scores and absolute regional metabolic rates, suggesting
lower energy consumption in individuals with higher Raven
scores10. This study was the first to hypothesize that intelligence
is not a function of how hard the brain works but rather how
efficiently it works, an observation known as the neural efficiency
hypothesis of intelligence11,12. The hypothesis that intelligence is
accomplished through efficient rather than excessive information
processing by the brain’s neuronal circuitry has been supported
by several studies using a wide range of neuroscientific meth-
ods12. Thus, the notion that intelligence is largely determined by
brain size has been criticized for being far too simplistic. A more
recent working hypothesis endorses the idea that interindividual
differences in intelligence are, to a significant extent, manifested
in the wiring properties of brain tissue, for example, in circuit
complexity or dendritic arborization13.
Evidence supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis of intel-
ligence mainly comes from studies investigating brain function by
the use of PET, fMRI, and EEG methods12. Apart from a few post
mortem examinations, little is known about the anatomical
substrates of neural efficiency14. This is due to a lack of practical
in vivo methodologies to examine the microstructural correlates
of efficient information processing at the level of axons or den-
drites. Currently, the most promising technique for the quanti-
fication of neurite morphology is a diffusion MRI technique
known as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging
(NODDI). This technique is based on a multi-shell high-angular-
resolution diffusion imaging protocol and offers a novel way to
analyze diffusion-weighted data with regard to tissue micro-
structure. It features a three-compartment model distinguishing
intra-neurite, extra-neurite, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) envir-
onments. NODDI is based on a diffusion model that was suc-
cessfully validated by histological examinations utilizing staining
methods in gray and white matter of rats and ferrets15,16. In
addition, Zhang, Schneider17 have shown that NODDI is also
capable of estimating diffusion markers of neurite density and
orientation dispersion by in vivo measurements in humans.
Direct validation of NODDI has recently been performed in a
study investigating neurite dispersion as a potential marker of
multiple sclerosis pathology in post-mortem spinal cord speci-
mens18. The authors reported that neurite density obtained from
NODDI significantly matched neurite density, orientation dis-
persion, and myelin density obtained from histology. Further-
more, the authors also found that NODDI neurite dispersion
matched the histological neurite dispersion. This indicates that
NODDI
metrics
are
closely
reflecting
their
histological
conditions.
Here we present the first study using NODDI to examine the
microstructural fiber architecture of the human brain in order to
shed light on possible neuroanatomical correlates affecting
intelligence. We demonstrate that NODDI measures of neurite
density and arborization show negative relationships to measures
of intelligence, implicating neural efficiency, particularly within
parieto-frontal brain regions, as suggested by the vast majority of
neuroimaging studies of intelligence6,19,20.
Results
Associations on a whole-brain level.
All analyses were per-
formed with data from two independent samples, namely, an
experimental sample (S259) and a validation sample (S498). In
the experimental sample we included healthy participants (N =
259, 138 males) between 18 and 40 years of age (M = 24.31, SD
= 4.41). We determined macrostructural and microstructural
brain properties and examined their relationship with cognitive
measures of intelligence. Intelligence was assessed with a matrix-
reasoning test called Bochumer Matrizentest (BOMAT)21. The
BOMAT test scores ranged from 7 to 27 correctly answered items
(M = 15.75, SD = 3.72) with 28 items being administered in total.

by

scans. Brain microstructure was quantified with NODDI coeffi-
cients representing neurite density, neurite orientation dispersion,
and isotropic diffusion within the cortex (INVFCortex, ODICortex,
ISOCortex) and white matter (INVFWM, ODIWM, ISOWM)17,24
(Fig. 1, right box). For the purpose of validating our experimental
results, we used data provided by the Human Connectome Pro-
ject25. This sample included 498 participants (202 males) between
22 and 36 years of age (M = 29.16, SD = 3.48). As with sample
S259, the intelligence test scores from sample S498 were also
obtained with a matrix-reasoning test, in this case the Penn
Matrix Analysis Test (PMAT24)26. The PMAT24 test scores
ranged from 5 to 24 correctly answered items (M = 16.53, SD =
4.74) with 24 items being administered in total. The neuroima-
ging data from sample S498 were processed identically to sample
S259.

 < 0.01) (Fig. 2), indicating that individuals with less neurite
density and less neurite orientation dispersion in the cortex
performed better on the intelligence test. Intelligence was not
significantly associated with INVFWM, ODIWM, ISOCortex, and
ISOWM (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Partial correlation

showed
a

positive
association
between
intelligence and VOLCortex (r = 0.20, p < 0.01) (Supplementary
Fig. 1). This result is consistent with previous research linking
intelligence with brain size5,27,28. However, in contrast to
previous research28, intelligence was not significantly related to
VOLWM. The results obtained from sample S498 replicated those
obtained from sample S259. Partial correlations, controlling for
age and sex, revealed that intelligence was negatively associated
with INVFCortex (r = −0.10, p < 0.05) and ODICortex (r = −0.15,
p < 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. 2) and positively associated with
VOLCortex (r = 0.19, p < 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Again,
intelligence was not significantly associated with INVFWM,
ISOCortex, and ISOWM, while partial correlation analysis revealed
significant negative associations between intelligence and ODIWM
(r = −0.12, p < 0.01) as well as intelligence and VOLWM (r = 0.10,
p < 0.05).
Importantly, the brain properties included in this study are
significantly correlated with one another (Supplementary Tables 1
and 2). In sample S259, this is particularly apparent for the
association between gray and white matter estimates: INVFCortex
and INVFWM (r = 0.60, p < 0.01), ODICortex and ODIWM (r =
0.47, p < 0.01), ISOCortex and ISOWM (r = 0.71, p < 0.01), as well as
VOLCortex and VOLWM (r = 0.75, p < 0.01). Therefore, it is
reasonable to assume that these brain properties share some of
the explained variance when predicting intelligence. Previous
research has shown that intelligence and cerebral cortex volume
are negatively associated with age29,30. This is consistent with
sample S259 showing a negative correlation between age and
intelligence (r = −0.17, p < 0.01) as well as age and VOLCortex

Fig. 1 Methodological sequence for the estimation of brain properties. First, T1-weighted anatomical images were partitioned into two segments including
the overall cortex and white matter of the brain, respectively. Second, the cortical segment was further partitioned into 180 regions per hemisphere based
on the multi-modal parcellation scheme provided by the Human Connectome Project. Third, both segments and the cortical brain regions were linearly
transformed into the native space of the diffusion-weighted NODDI images. Fourth, mean values of different macrostructural and microstructural measures
(volume estimates and NODDI coefficients) were computed for the overall cortex and white matter using the respective segments. Fifth, at the level of
single brain regions, volume estimates and NODDI coefficients from homotopic brain regions were averaged across both hemispheres resulting in 180
mean values for each macrostructural and microstructural measure, respectively

 (r = −0.24, p < 0.01). Furthermore, we observed significant sex
differences with males having greater VOLCortex (t(257) = 10.01,
p < 0.01) and VOLWM (t(257) = 10.63, p < 0.01) as well as higher
INVFCortex (t(257) = 2.70, p < 0.01) and INVFWM (t(257) = 2.44,
p < 0.05) relative to females. This suggests that the prediction of
intelligence by macrostructural and microstructural brain proper-
ties might, in part, be confounded by an individual’s age and sex
or collinearity among the predictors. To address these issues, we
employed an approach similar to recent studies investigating the
relationship
between
different
brain
properties
and
intelligence31,32. We computed a multiple regression analysis
that enabled us to extract the unique contribution of each
macrostructural and microstructural brain property in predicting
intelligence.
In this model, intelligence was regressed on age, sex, and all
brain properties included in the partial correlation analysis. The
regression model for sample S259 was significant (R² = 0.14, F
(10, 248) = 3.86, p < 0.01) and yielded significant regression
coefficients for INVFCortex (β = −0.22, p < 0.05) and ODICortex (β
= −0.19, p < 0.05). The regression coefficient for VOLCortex was

 of comparable magnitude but failed to reach statistical signifi-
cance (β = 0.22, p = 0.08) (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4).
Nevertheless, these results generally confirmed the pattern
revealed by the partial correlation analysis and indicate that the
two microstructural brain properties, INVFCortex and ODICortex,
contribute to the prediction of intelligence independently.
Furthermore, we observed no significant associations between
intelligence and the remaining predictors ISOCortex, INVFWM,
ODIWM, ISOWM, VOLWM, age, and sex. It is conceivable that
intelligence might be associated with study compliance in such a
way that low-IQ individuals show more unwanted head move-
ments during the MRI examination. This in turn might distort
the estimated magnitude of certain brain properties and hence
affect the outcome of the aforementioned multiple regression
analysis. However, in the S259 sample, intelligence was not
significantly correlated with head motion measured during the
diffusion-weighted scan (r = −0.03, p = 0.69). Consequentially,
adding head motion as a covariate to the multiple regression
analysis did not alter the respective results in any substantial way
(Supplementary Table 3).
Results of the same regression analysis for sample S498
(R² = 0.08, F(10, 487) = 4.27, p < 0.01) were comparable to
sample S259 (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Importantly, we observed significant regression coefficients
with a negative sign for INVFCortex (β = −0.15, p < 0.05) and a
positive sign for VOLCortex (β = 0.27, p < 0.01). ISOCortex, despite
not showing a significant correlation with intelligence (r = 0.02,
p = 0.62), had a positive β coefficient that reached statistical
significance (β = 0.17, p < 0.01). This condition, in which an
independent variable shows no correlation with the dependent
variable, but makes a significant contribution in the context of a
multiple regression analysis with other variables, is called
“suppression” in statistics33–35. The variable suppresses variance
that is not related to the dependent measure in other independent
variables and thereby enhances predictive power of the variable
set as a whole36. Thus, only INVFCortex and VOLCortex can be
regarded as uniquely contributing to the prediction of intelligence
in the S498 sample. None of the remaining regression coefficients
reached statistical significance.
Associations on the level of single brain regions. Next, we
focused our analysis on NODDI coefficients derived from single
brain regions in order to draw a more refined picture of the
structure–function relationships observed at the whole-brain
level. Based on the Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT)
6,19, we aimed to test hypotheses related to specificity of regional
associations with intelligence. To this end, we utilized the multi-
modal parcellation scheme provided by the Human Connectome
Project, which delineates 180 cortical brain regions per hemi-
sphere37. NODDI coefficients from homotopic brain regions were
averaged across both hemispheres, resulting in 180 mean values.
The associations between these NODDI coefficients and intelli-
gence were analyzed by means of partial correlations, controlling
for age, sex, and all remaining cortical brain properties, while
correcting
for
multiple
comparisons
using
the
Benjamini–Hochberg method (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6).
For sample S259, the vast majority of brain regions exhibited
negative associations between intelligence and INVFCortex (159
out of 180 brain regions) as well as intelligence and ODICortex
(164 out of 180 brain regions) (Fig. 3). However, none of the
partial correlations involving INVFCortex survived correction for
multiple comparisons. In contrast, the negative associations
between intelligence and ODICortex reached statistical significance
in 12 brain regions with partial correlation coefficients in the
range of −0.21 to −0.18. Importantly, the majority of these brain
regions (9 out of 12) showed an overlap with brain regions from
the original P-FIT model as defined by Jung and Haier6 or its
updated version proposed by Basten et al.19 (see Methods).
Performing the same analysis for sample S498 resulted in 154
out of 180 brain regions showing negative associations between
intelligence and INVFCortex with partial correlation coefficients in
11 of these regions reaching statistical significance (r = −0.19 to
−0.14) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Again, there was an overlap
between the P-FIT model and some of the statistically significant
brain regions (7 out of 11). Intelligence was negatively associated
with ODICortex in 151 out of 180 brain regions. In five of these
brain regions the respective partial correlations reached statistical
significance with coefficients ranging from −0.17 to −0.14. Brain
regions overlapping with the P-FIT model could be identified in
four out of five cases.
Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to investigate the relationship
between intelligence and neuroanatomical correlates on both
macroscopic and microscopic levels. To this end, we examined
volume estimates of the whole-brain as well as single brain
regions and utilized an advanced diffusion MRI technique to
analyze the architecture of dendrites and axons.
Our data as well as data provided by the Human Connectome
Project25 revealed an expected positive association between cor-
tical volume and intelligence, corrected for age, sex, and colli-
nearity. It is a well-established and consistent observation that
cognitive abilities are related to brain volume, especially the
volume of the cerebral cortex1,4,5. The biological explanation for
this structure–function relationship is usually derived from the
fact that individuals with more cortical volume possess a higher
number of neurons7,8 and thus more computational power to
engage in logic reasoning (Fig. 4). However, the major aim of our
study was to investigate the microstructural architecture of the
cortex by closely analyzing the diffusion characteristics of den-
drites and axons.
We found that specific microstructural properties were asso-
ciated with intelligence, especially in cortical regions included in
the P-FIT network. Cortical gray matter is largely composed of
the neuropil, namely, dendrites, axons, and glial cell processes.
These structures restrict the movement of water molecules and
are modeled as sticks in the NODDI model, from which markers,
resembling neurite density and neurite orientation dispersion, can
be computed15–18. Histological examinations have shown that the
relative proportion of glial cells within a fixed volume of cortex is
relatively small compared to other components38,39. The influ-
ence of their processes on the diffusion signal can thus be
regarded as negligible. As a consequence, the diffusion signal
arising from the intra-neurite space can be attributed to the
architecture of dendrites and axons15. Our results indicate that
neurite density and neurite orientation dispersion within the
cortex are both negatively associated with intelligence. At first
glance, this finding might appear counterintuitive to the central
working hypothesis of differential neuroscience, which usually
finds that “bigger is better” (i.e., more neuronal mass is associated
with higher ability levels). However, our results conform well to
findings on the mechanisms of maturation-induced and learning-
induced synaptic plasticity. Brain maturation is associated with a
sharp increase of synapse number, followed by a massive activity-
dependent synaptic pruning that reduces synaptic density by half,
thereby enabling the establishment of typical mature cortical
microarchitecture40. Maturation-associated synaptic pruning is
not only an event of early childhood, but proceeds at a rapid rate
at least until the end of the second decade of life41. Most
importantly, the mechanisms of synaptic growth and pruning

 during maturation overlap with those of learning in the mature
brain42. Consequently, diverse learning tasks are associated with
simultaneous growth and retraction of dendritic and synaptic
processes in involved neural zones43,44. Microstructural studies
with confocal imaging on organotypic brain cultures reveal that
long-term potentiation initially induces synaptic growth, followed
by an increased loss of connections within 10% of non-stimulated
hippocampal spines45. Thus, both the ability to produce and
prune neural connections constitutes the neurobiological foun-
dation of learning and cognition.
Perturbations of synaptic and dendritic growth and pruning
have grave consequences with regard to cognitive performance46.

Fig. 3 Partial correlation analyses with data from sample S259 quantifying structure–function associations at the level of single brain regions. For each
hemisphere, 180 cortical brain regions were defined based on the multi-modal parcellation scheme provided by the Human Connectome Project. NODDI
coefficients and volume measures from homotopic brain regions were averaged across both hemispheres, resulting in 180 mean values. Structure–function
associations between INVFCortex and intelligence (a) as well as ODICortex and intelligence (b) were analyzed by means of partial correlations with age, sex,
and the remaining cortical brain properties as controlling variables. FDR correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method was applied to account for a
total of 180 comparisons. Partial correlation coefficients are depicted as gray bars arranged by magnitude from negative to positive. Due to space
restrictions, a middle portion of 110 brain regions exhibiting no significant structure–function associations is spared out. Statistically significant partial
correlation coefficients that survived a critical FDR threshold of q = 0.05 (see Methods) are highlighted in either red or yellow. The yellow color marks
significant partial correlation coefficients that are exhibited by brain regions from the P-FIT model of intelligence. Following this color scheme, respective
brain regions are marked in either red or yellow on a cortical surface. INVFCortex = intra-neurite volume fraction representing neurite density in the cortex,

 For example, reduced synaptic pruning results in an excess of
synapses, which is associated with pathologies characterized by
low intelligence including Down’s syndrome47,48. An increase in
synapses may also cause failure in differentiating signals from
noise, reducing network efficiency49. Indeed, computational stu-
dies show that synaptic pruning increases learning and processing
speed, and saves network and energy resources50, by requiring
less computation to learn relations between data sets51. These
observations are in line with the results obtained from both our
experimental data and validation data from the Human Con-
nectome Project25. We found that both INVFCortex and ODICortex,
representing neurite density and orientation dispersion in the
cerebral cortex, were negatively associated with intelligence. Since
both markers are closely related to the amount of synaptic con-
nections, our findings provide the first evidence of specific
microstructural brain correlates facilitating efficient information
processing as measured by intelligence (Fig. 4). This supports the
neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence10–12. In the original
PET study of neural efficiency52, researchers examined two
samples of low-IQ individuals, including patients suffering from
Down’s syndrome and another form of mental retardation, as
well as a control group of individuals with average intelligence.
They found that both low-IQ groups exhibited higher rates of
cortical glucose metabolism compared to the healthy control
participants while working on Raven’s Advanced Progressive
Matrices9,53. They attributed their observations to a failure of
neural pruning in the brains of low-IQ individuals13,52. It is very
important to note that these researchers were restricted to a
pathological sample when proposing a biological foundation for
the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence. Given the lack of
suitable post mortem data or practical in vivo methods to obtain
information about cortical microstructure, they examined indi-
viduals that were known to have dendritic trees with a very dis-
tinct microstructure,
i.e., patients with Down’s syndrome.
However, evidence from a clinical sample is prone to influence by
various confounding factors. Therefore, one should proceed with
utmost care when generalizing these findings to our results, which
were obtained from healthy individuals in the range of average
intelligence.
Nevertheless, there is some evidence from healthy subjects to
support the idea that interindividual differences in intelligence are
associated with different levels of cortical activation during rea-
soning. For example, early EEG studies showed that high-IQ
individuals, when working on an elementary cognitive task, dis-
play an event-related desynchronization (ERD) limited to cortical
areas required for the task54. In contrast, low-IQ individuals were
characterized by an ERD that was spread across a wide range of
cortical areas. We hypothesize that this evidence of unfocused
cortical activity was associated with redundant neuronal circuits
in the form of expendable dendrites in the cortex. In another EEG

Fig. 4 Schematic depiction of differences between low-IQ and high-IQ individuals with regard to brain volume, neurite density, and arborization of dendritic
trees within the cortex. High-IQ individuals are likely to possess more cortical volume than low-IQ individuals, which is indicated by differently sized brains
(left side) and differently sized panels showing exemplary magnifications of neuron and neurite microstructure (right side). The difference in cortical
volume is highlighted by the shadow around the upper brain. Due to their larger cortices, it is conceivable that high-IQ individuals benefit from the
processing power of additional neurons, which are marked by the dotted line in the lower panel. The cerebral cortex of high-IQ individuals is characterized
by a low degree of neurite density and orientation dispersion, which is indicated by smaller and less ramified dendritic trees in the respective panel.
Intellectual performance is likely to benefit from this kind of microstructural architecture since restricting synaptic connections to an efficient minimum
facilitates the differentiation of signals from noise while saving network and energy resources. Neurons and neurites are depicted in black and gray to
create a sense of depth. Please note, this depiction does not correspond to the actual magnitude of effect sizes reported in the study. For the purpose of an
easier visual understanding, differences in both macrostructural and microstructural brain properties are highly accentuated

 study by Walhovd et al.30 the authors demonstrated that the
latency of the ERP component P3a, as a measure of speed-of-
processing, was negatively correlated with intelligence. Again,
these findings can be interpreted in terms of neural efficiency and
correspond to the results presented in our study. Future studies
utilizing both structural and functional techniques will be critical
in determining whether a higher degree of neurite density and
orientation dispersion could slow cortical speed-of-processing
due to inefficient circuitry, thus having a negative effect on
intelligence.
Taken together, the results of the present study contribute to
our understanding of human intelligence differences in two ways.
First, our findings confirm an important observation from pre-
vious research, namely, that bigger brains with a higher number
of neurons are associated with higher intelligence. Second, we
demonstrate that higher intelligence is associated with cortical
mantles with sparsely and well-organized dendritic arbor, thereby
increasing processing speed and network efficiency. Importantly,
the findings obtained from our experimental sample were con-
firmed by the analysis of an independent validation sample from
the Human Connectome Project25. This replication of results is
particularly striking given that both data sets are very different on
many levels. For example, two different cognitive tests were used
in order to measure intelligence, i.e., BOMAT and PMAT24. Both
of them are culture-fair matrix-reasoning instruments capable of
assessing the construct of fluid intelligence. Nevertheless, both
tests tend to produce different results when testing individuals
from high-IQ ranges. This might be attributed to the fact that
BOMAT, in contrast to PMAT24 and other matrix-reasoning
tests, was deliberately designed to avoid ceiling effects in very
intelligent samples such as university students or high potentials.
Moreover, both data sets used for this study differ with regard to
their MRI data. Although the diffusion-weighted data from
sample S259 is of sufficient quality and meets current standards
in the field of neuroscience, it goes without saying that the data
provided by the Human Connectome Project is of higher quality
in terms of data acquisition and preprocessing. For example,
diffusion-weighted data from sample S498 is superior to sample
S259 in terms of voxel size (1.25 × 1.25 × 1.25 mm vs. 2 × 2 × 2
mm) and number of total diffusion directions (288 vs. 128). In
addition to that, there are differences in the preprocessing pro-
tocols of both data sets as well. While the eddy_correct pipeline
from FSL was used to correct for eddy-current-induced distor-
tions in the S259 sample, the Human Connectome Project uti-
lized FSL’s recently published eddy tool for this task55. Another
important aspect worth mentioning is that the two samples
themselves are not completely equal to one another. The
S259 sample includes 259 participants with about 53% of them
being male, whereas the S498 sample features almost twice as
much participants of which merely 41% are males. In view of all
these differences, it is hardly surprising that there are some results
from the S259 sample that do not exactly match those obtained
from the Human Connectome Project’s data. Nevertheless, we
feel that the similarities far outweigh the minor differences. Both
data sets indicate that intelligence is associated with neurite
density and orientation dispersion. Equally important, both data
sets also show that this association points into a negative direc-
tion. This general pattern is clearly visible in both data sets.
Moreover, one has to acknowledge that most of the statistically
significant cortical areas, despite lacking a perfect match between
data sets, show an impressive overlap with regions previously
identified as belonging to the P-FIT network (about 70%). Finally,
to the best of our knowledge, these results are the first to offer a
neuroanatomical explanation underlying the neural efficiency
hypothesis of intelligence.
In conclusion, the results obtained by NODDI substantially
extend our knowledge about the biological basis of human
intelligence differences, by providing insight regarding the bio-
logical basis of efficiency of processing at the neuronal level. The
complementary findings at both macrostructural and micro-
structural levels provide a comprehensive biological mechanism,
adding to the growing body of literature supporting a distributed
network of efficiently organized neurons and axons underlying
the expression of human intelligence.
Methods
Participants in the S259 sample. Two hundred fifty-nine participants (138
males) between 18 and 40 years of age (M = 24.31, SD = 4.41) took part in the
study. Since this is the first study to investigate the microstructural correlates of
intelligence using NODDI, it was not possible to estimate the necessary sample size
a priori based on existing literature. Instead, we collected data from a reasonably
large sample and computed the achieved power post hoc using G*Power56. The
analysis was based on the multiple regression model reported for sample S259
(Table 1) (f2 = 0.16, α = 0.05, 10 predictors, 259 participants) and yielded a power
of 0.99, thereby indicating sufficient sample size. Two hundred thirty-five parti-
cipants were right-handed and the remaining 24 participants were left-handed as
measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory57. This ratio is representative of
the human population58. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision and hearing. They were either paid for their participation or received course
credit. All participants were naive to the purpose of the study and had no former
experience with the administered intelligence test. Participants had no history of
psychiatric or neurological disorders and matched the standard inclusion criteria
for fMRI examinations. Each participant completed the matrix-reasoning test and
neuroimaging measurement described below. All behavioral and neuroimaging
variables used for analyses on the whole-brain level were normally distributed
according to a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. All data were checked for extreme
outliers as defined by Tukey’s fences59 (observations three interquartile ranges
below the first or above the third quartile, respectively), but none were found. Thus,
no observations were excluded. The study was approved by the local ethics com-
mittee of the Faculty of Psychology at Ruhr-University Bochum. All participants
gave their written informed consent and were treated in accordance with the
declaration of Helsinki.
Participants in the S498 sample. For the purpose of validating the results
obtained from sample S259, recruited at Ruhr-University Bochum, we downloaded
additional data provided by the Human Connectome Project, namely, the “S500
plus MEG2” release25. This set includes 506 participants with data suitable for our
analyses. We excluded eight participants because of extreme outliers being detected
in their behavioral or neuroimaging data59. Thus, all of the reported analyses were
performed on data from 498 participants (202 males) between 22 and 36 years of
age (M = 29.16, SD = 3.48). Again, we performed a post hoc analysis using
G*Power56 in order to compute the achieved power. Based on the multiple
regression model reported for sample S498 (Supplementary Table 4) (f2 = 0.09, α
= 0.05, 10 predictors, 498 participants), the analysis resulted in a power of 0.99 and
indicated sufficient sample size. As with sample S259, all neuroimaging variables
used for analyses on the whole-brain level were normally distributed according to a
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The PMAT24 test scores did not follow a normal
distribution but were slightly skewed to the left. For the sake of comparability,
sample S498 was analyzed in the same way as sample S259.
Acquisition of behavioral data in the S259 sample. The acquisition of beha-
vioral data was conducted in a group setting of up to six participants, seated at
individual tables, in a quiet and well-lit room. Intelligence was measured with a
German matrix-reasoning test called BOMAT21, which is widely used in neu-
roscientific research60–62. The test examines non-verbal mental abilities that con-
tribute to intelligence and is similar to Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices9.
We conducted the “advanced short version” of the BOMAT, which has the
advantage of high discriminatory power in samples with generally high intellectual
abilities, thus avoiding possible ceiling effects60. The BOMAT inventory comprises
two parallel test forms (A and B) with 29 matrix-reasoning items each. Participants
had to complete only one of the two test forms, which were randomly assigned.
Split-half reliability of the BOMAT is 0.89, Cronbach’s α is 0.92, and parallel-forms
reliability between A and B is 0.8621. Additionally, convergent and predictive
validity are given for both BOMAT test forms since they are strongly correlated
with other intelligence inventories (r = 0.59), tests of perceptual speed (r = 0.51),
and German high school GPA (r = −0.35)21. The recent norming sample consists
of about 2100 individuals with an age range between 18–60 years and equal sex
representation.

 Neuropsychological Test Battery provided by the University of Pennsylvania
(PennCNP). The PMAT24 is an abbreviated version of the Raven’s Progressive
Matrices and includes 24 items of increasing difficulty. Each matrix pattern is made
up of 2 × 2, 3 × 3, or 1 × 5 arrangements of squares with one of the squares missing.
The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing
square on the pattern. There is no time limit to the completion of the test, although
the task discontinues if the participant makes five incorrect responses in a row. The
PMAT24 has two test forms of which the Human Connectome Project only used
one (form A) in order to assess intelligence.
Acquisition of imaging data in the S259 sample. All imaging data were acquired
at the Bergmannsheil hospital in Bochum (Germany) using a Philips 3T Achieva
scanner with a 32-channel head coil.
For the purpose of segmenting brain scans into gray and white matter
segments as well as for the identification of anatomical landmarks, a T1-weighted
high-resolution anatomical image was acquired (MP-RAGE, TR = 8179 ms,
TE = 3.7 ms, flip angle = 8°, 220 slices, matrix size = 240 × 240, voxel
size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm). The acquisition time of the anatomical image was 6 min.
For the analysis of NODDI coefficients, diffusion-weighted images were
acquired using echo planar imaging (TR = 7652 ms, TE = 87 ms, flip angle = 90°,
60 slices, matrix size = 112 × 112, voxel size = 2 × 2 × 2 mm). Diffusion weighting
was based on a multi-shell, high-angular-resolution scheme consisting of diffusion-
weighted images for b-values of 1000, 1800, and 2500 s/mm2, respectively, applied
along 20, 40, and 60 uniformly distributed directions. All diffusion directions
within and between shells were generated orthogonal to each other using the
MASSIVE toolbox63. Additionally, eight data sets with no diffusion weighting
(b = 0 s/mm²) were acquired as an anatomical reference for motion correction
and computation of NODDI coefficients. The acquisition time of the diffusion-
weighted images was 18 min.
Acquisition of imaging data in the S498 sample. All imaging data included in
sample S498 were acquired on a customized Siemens 3T Connectome Skyra
scanner housed at Washington University in St. Louis using a standard 32-channel
Siemens receive head coil. Anatomical and diffusion-weighted imaging were car-
ried out on two separate days with a mock scanner practice preceding the anato-
mical imaging on the first day. The Human Connectome Project’s imaging
hardware and protocols are documented elaborately in the reference manual for the
“S500 plus MEG2” release.
A T1-weighted high-resolution anatomical image was acquired by means of an
MP-RAGE sequence and the following parameters: TR = 2400 ms, TE = 2.14 ms,
flip angle = 8°, matrix size = 224 × 224, voxel size = 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm. The
acquisition time of the anatomical image was 7 min and 40 s.
The Human Connectome Project provides diffusion-weighted data suitable for
the analysis of NODDI coefficients. The respective images were acquired using
echo planar imaging and the following parameters: TR = 5520 ms, TE = 89.5 ms,
flip angle = 78°, 111 slices, matrix size = 168 × 144, voxel size = 1.25 × 1.25 × 1.25
mm. The diffusion-weighted imaging session included six runs based on three
different gradient tables once acquired in the right-left and left-right phase-
encoding direction. The gradient tables included 90 diffusion weighting directions
and six acquisitions with b = 0 s/mm² interspersed throughout each run. As with
the data obtained for sample S259, diffusion weighting consisted of three shells, in
this case b = 1000, 2000, and 3000 s/mm² interspersed with an approximately equal
number of acquisitions on each shell within each run. Each of the six runs lasted
approximately 9 min and 50 s, thereby, overall acquisition time amounted to about
an hour.
Analysis of imaging data in the S259 sample. We used published surface-based
methods in FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu, version 5.3.0) to
reconstruct the cortical surfaces of the T1-weighted images. The details of this
procedure have been described elsewhere22,23. The automated reconstruction steps
included skull stripping, gray and white matter segmentation, as well as recon-
struction and inflation of the cortical surface. After preprocessing, each individual
segmentation was quality controlled slice by slice and inaccuracies for the auto-
mated steps were corrected by manual editing if necessary. The automated brain
segmentation yielded an estimate of the overall cortical volume (VOLCortex) and the
overall white matter volume (VOLWM). For the purpose of analyzing our data with
regard to structure–function relationships on the level of single brain regions, we
utilized the Human Connectome Project’s multi-modal parcellation (HCPMMP)37.
This parcellation scheme delineates 180 cortical brain regions per hemisphere and
is based on the cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and topography from
210 healthy individuals. The original data provided by the HCP were converted to
annotation files matching the standard cortical surface in FreeSurfer called
fsaverage. This fsaverage parcellation was transformed to each participant’s indi-
vidual cortical surface and converted to volumetric masks. In a final step, the two
segments delineating the overall cortex and white matter as well as the 360 masks
representing single cortical brain regions yielded by the HCPMMP were linearly
transformed into the native space of the diffusion-weighted images (Fig. 1, left
box). The transformed regions served as anatomical landmarks from which
NODDI coefficients were extracted (Fig. 1, right box).
Diffusion images were preprocessed using FDT (FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox) as
implemented in FSL version 5.0.7. Preprocessing steps included a correction for
eddy currents and head motion using the eddy_correct tool. Subsequently, gradient
directions were corrected to account for any reorientations in the eddy_correct
output. NODDI coefficients were computed using the AMICO toolbox24. The
AMICO approach is based on a convex optimization procedure that converts the
non-linear fitting into a linear optimization problem24. This reduces processing
time dramatically64. Data analysis with NODDI can be applied to cortical regions
as well as white matter structures. However, it is necessary to optimize the NODDI
model for the purpose of analyzing gray matter structures since different types of
brain tissue may vary considerably with regard to their intrinsic free
diffusivity18,65,66. Because of this, we adjusted the AMICO toolbox and changed its
respective parameter for intrinsic free diffusivity to 1.1 × 10−3 mm2/s for analyzing
gray matter structures and utilized the toolbox’ default setting of 1.7 × 10−3 mm2/s
for the analysis of white matter. The NODDI technique is based on a two-level
approach and features a three-compartment model distinguishing intra-neurite,
extra-neurite, and CSF environments. First, the diffusion signal obtained by the
multi-shell high-angular-resolution imaging protocol is used to determine the
proportion of free moving water within each voxel15–17,24,67. This ratio is termed
isotropic volume fraction and reflects the amount of isotropic diffusion with
gaussian properties likely to be found in the CSF of gray (ISOCortex) and white
matter (ISOWM) regions. Second, the remaining portion of the diffusion signal is
attributed to either intra-neurite environments or extra-neurite environments15–17.
The proportion of intra-neurite environments is quantified as the intra-neurite
volume fraction (INVF). INVF represents the amount of stick-like or cylindrically
symmetric diffusion that is created when water molecules are restricted by the
membranes of neurites. In white matter structures this kind of diffusion (INVFWM)
is likely to resemble the proportion of axons. In gray matter regions (INVFCortex) it
serves as an indicator of dendrites and axons forming the neuropil. Extra-neurite
environments are characterized by hindered diffusion and are usually occupied by
various types of glial cells in white matter structures and both neurons and glial
cells in gray matter regions15–17.
Neurite orientation dispersion is a tortuosity measure coupling the intra-neurite
space and the extra-neurite space, resulting in alignment or dispersion of axons in
white matter (ODIWM) or axons and dendrites in gray matter (ODICortex)17,67.
Examples of INVF, ODI, and ISO coefficient maps from a representative individual
are illustrated in Fig. 1, right box. As described above, the cortical and white matter
regions defined for the T1-weighted anatomical scans were transformed into the
native space of the diffusion-weighted images to compute NODDI coefficients for
areas across the whole brain.
Analysis of imaging data in the S498 sample. The analyses of anatomical and
diffusion-weighted data from sample S498 were carried out in the same way as
described for sample S259. The only differences in analyses were found in their
preprocessing. For example, the Human Connectome Project utilizes a combina-
tion of the FSL tools topup and eddy in order to correct for eddy currents, head
motion, and EPI distortions simultaneously. These tools represent an updated
version of the eddy_correct tool used for the S259 sample and make use of the fact
that one-half of the HCP’s diffusion-weighted data was acquired in the right-left
phase-encoding direction and the other half in the left-right phase-encoding
direction. The HCP’s preprocessing pipelines for anatomical and diffusion-
weighted data are detailed in the reference manual for the “S500 plus MEG2”
release as well as in Glasser, Sotiropoulos68.
Matching single brain regions against the P-FIT model. Subsequent to the
analysis of structure–function relationships on the level of single brain regions, all
brain regions showing statistically significant associations between NODDI coef-
ficients and intelligence were matched against the P-FIT model6,19. To this end we
employed a cortical parcellation based on Brodmann areas69, which is included as
annotation files named “lh.PALS_B12_Brodmann” and “rh.PALS_B12_-
Brodmann” in FreeSurfer. By using FreeSurfer’s aparc2aseg tool, both files were
converted to a volumetric segmentation matching the cortex of the fsaverage
standard brain. The same was done to the HCPMMP annotation file. By means of
an in-house Matlab program, each brain region included in the HCPMMP was
assigned to one of the Brodmann areas. This was done by comparing each voxel
within a HCPMMP region to its corresponding voxel from the Brodmann seg-
mentation. The Brodmann area showing the largest overlap with the respective
HCPMMP region was identified in terms of number of matching voxels. In the
original version proposed by Jung and Haier6, the P-FIT features a network of 14
Brodmann areas. In an updated version by Basten et al.19 the network’s compo-
sition was confirmed, but also extended to five additional Brodmann areas. If our
partial correlation analyses yielded a statistically significant brain region that was
assigned to one of these 19 Brodmann areas, it was considered to belong to the P-
FIT model.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out using Matlab, version
7.14.0.739 (R2012a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and SPSS version 20 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). For all analyses, linear parametric methods were used. Testing
was two-tailed with an α-level of 0.05, which was FDR corrected for multiple

 comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method70 when conducting correla-
tion analyses on the level of single brain regions.
We examined structure–function relationships on a whole-brain level by
computing partial correlation coefficients reflecting the associations between
intelligence and the structural brain properties included in this study. Age and sex
were used as controlling variables. We followed a similar but more stringent
approach for our analyses on the level of single brain regions. As described above,
the parcellation scheme provided by the Human Connectome Project37 yielded 180
cortical regions per hemisphere. NODDI coefficients and volume measures from
homotopic regions were averaged across both hemispheres, resulting in 180 mean
values for INVFCortex, ODICortex, ISOCortex, and VOLCortex, respectively. The
associations between INVFCortex and intelligence as well as ODICortex and
intelligence were analyzed by means of partial correlations, controlling for age and
sex, and the remaining cortical brain properties, while correcting for multiple
comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method70.
To examine the structure–function relationships with regard to the unique
contribution of each brain property included in the correlation analyses, we
computed a multiple regression analysis using SPSS. Intelligence was treated as the
dependent variable and INVFCortex, INVFWM, ODICortex, ODIWM, ISOCortex,
ISOWM, VOLCortex, VOLWM, age, and sex as predictors.
