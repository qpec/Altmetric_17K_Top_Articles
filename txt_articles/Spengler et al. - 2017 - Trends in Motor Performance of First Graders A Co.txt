Background: Motor performance is an important factor for health. Already in childhood, 
motor performance is associated with, e.g., obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular 
diseases. It is widely believed that the motor performance of children has declined over 
recent years. However, this belief is lacking clear evidence. The objective of this study 
was to examine trends in motor performance of first grade students during a period of 
10 years (2006–2015). We examined trends in (a) aerobic fitness, (b) strength, (c) speed, 
and (d) balance for boys and girls separately and considered body mass index (BMI) as 
a potential confounder.
Methods: From 2006 to 2015, we tested 5,001 first graders [50.8% boys; mean age 
6.76 (0.56) years] of 18 primary schools in Germany. Each year between 441 and 552 
students of the same schools were surveyed. Performance tests were taken from the 
Motorik-Module Study and the “German Motor Ability Test”: “6-min run,” “push-ups,” 
“20-m sprint,” and “static stand.” Linear regression models were conducted for statisti-
cal analysis.
results: A slightly negative trend in aerobic fitness performance was revealed in boys 
(β = −0.050; p = 0.012) but not in girls. In the strength performance test no trend 
over time was detected. Performance in speed (boys: β = −0.094; girls: β = −0.143; 
p ≤ 0.001) and balance tests (boys: β = −0.142; girls: β = −0.232; p ≤ 0.001) increased 
over time for both boys and girls. These findings held true when BMI was considered.
conclusion: This study only partly supported the assumption that motor performance 
of children has declined: in our study, aerobic fitness declined (only in boys), while 
strength remained stable and speed and balance even increased in both sexes. 
Moreover, it seems as if BMI can explain changes in performance only to a small extent. 
Changed lifestyles might be a substantial cause. Further research on recent trends of 
motor performance and interacting variables is needed to support the results of our 
study and to provide more knowledge on causes of these trends.

Already in childhood motor performance is an important factor for health as it is associated with, 
e.g., obesity (1) and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (2) in this early age. However, it is 
widely believed that motor performance of children has declined in recent years (3, 4). An often 
discussed reason for this potential decline is the verified increase of body mass index (BMI) among

youth in the last decades (5, 6). The assumption that changed 
physical conditions are associated with changed motor perfor-
mance seems to be reasonable. Though, inverse but independent 
trends in obesity and fitness levels among children are shown 
(7) and performance differences persist even after matching 
for overweight (8). To investigate the question of decline in 
motor performance among youth by reviewing the scientific 
literature, we first have to distinguish different aspects of motor 
performance. Different approaches exist (9–12). Most of them 
assume that motor performance is a multidimensional construct 
(13). The dimensionality described by Bös (12) was shown to be 
valid for children and adolescents (13) and assumes that motor 
performance can be differentiated by four main dimensions 
of motor performance ability which are endurance (including 
aerobic fitness), strength, speed, and coordination (including 
balance) (12).
Considering the results of extensive systematic reviews 
there is evidence on an improvement in aerobic fitness from 
1958 until about 1970, followed by a decline from the 1970s 
to 2003. Strength and speed performance seemed to be stable 
over this time period (3, 4, 14). The aforementioned systematic 
reviews cover approximately five decades of the last century and, 
therefore, give an overview of a long period of time, in which 
substantial societal changes took place. Other studies examine 
trends over a shorter period of time, reflecting smaller societal 
changes, which are especially significant for the examined time 
period [e.g., the rapid increase of media offers within western 
countries in recent years (15)]. With regard to current literature 
about trends covering the last two decades and thus represent-
ing current societal changes, the picture is fragmentary. There 
are only few studies which follow heterogeneous designs and 
present heterogeneous results (7, 16–20): for example, the 
majority of studies finds a decline in aerobic fitness (7, 16, 17). 
One study detects a positive change in aerobic fitness, but only 
in girls (19). In one study, strength performance declines (20), in 
another study it remains stable (7), in a third study it increases 
(19). Trends in speed, coordination or in balance performance 
are less investigated. Most of the studies compare only two 
measurement points. The age of the examined children as well 
as tests performed differ between the studies considered. Most 
studies examine trends in boys and girls separately. This seems 
to be important as in some instances different results for each 
sex appear. However, most studies do not adjust for BMI and, 
therefore, cannot eliminate the possibility that changed physical 
conditions determine changes in performance.
The objective of this study was to examine trends in motor 
performance of first grade students during a period of 10 years 
(2006–2015). More specific, we aimed at examining trends in 
(a) aerobic fitness, (b) strength, (c) speed, and (d) balance, for 
boys and girls separately. BMI was considered as a potential 
confounder.

study Design and Participants
Within a project of the foundation “Baden-Badener Sportstiftung 
Kurt Henn,” motor performance of 5,001 first grade students of 
18 primary schools was tested each year from 2006 until 2015. 
The schools are located in southern Germany (region around 
Baden-Baden), while all schools in the region were represented. 
Each year between 441 and 552 students of the same schools 
took part in the survey. The survey was approved by the ethics 
committee of the University of Freiburg, Germany. Parent of each 
participant gave informed written consent before enrollment into 
the survey. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki. The tests were performed each year in springtime. 
Participants’ mean age was 6.76 (±0.56) years, 50.8% were male. 
A detailed description of sample size, age, sex, and BMI of each 
cohort can be found in Table 1.
Measurements
Motor Performance
Motor performance was examined using tests that are part of 
the Motorik-Module Study (21) and the “German Motor Ability 
Test” (22). Four tests were selected to cover four dimensions of 
motor performance: (a) aerobic fitness as part of the endurance 
dimension, (b) strength, (c) speed, and (d) balance as part of the 
global coordination dimension (12). Content-related validity 
of all tests was evaluated based on expert ratings with regard to 
significance and feasibility (rating scale ranging from 1 = “very 
good” to 5 = “very poor”). Values between 1.3 and 2.1 showed 
good content-related validity (21, 22). Reliability of all tests 
 
was good or very good (rmin = 0.73 to rmax = 0.92) (22, 23). The 
exact testing procedure has been described previously (13, 22, 24).
Aerobic fitness was tested using the test “6-min run.” Par-
ticipants were asked to run or walk constantly for 6 min. The 
distance covered by each participant was measured by test lead-
ers (22). Strength was tested using the test “push-ups”: The par-
ticipant lay in prone position and the hands grasped one another 
on the buttocks, then placed the hands next to the shoulders 
and pushed his/her body up. One hand clapped onto the other, 
before the participant moved back to the starting position by 
flexing the arms. A test leader supervised correct performance 
and counted repetitions within 40 s (13, 22). Speed was tested 
using the test “20-m sprint.” Participants were asked to sprint 
a 20-m distance as fast as possible, starting in lunge position. 
Time was measured manually by three independent test leaders. 
 
The mean value was calculated. The better attempt out of two 
was used for analysis (22). The test “static stand” was used to 
test balance. The task was to stand on one leg on a T-shaped

balancing bar (width 3 cm) wearing sneakers and to rest in 
the balance position. The number of contacts of the free foot 
with the ground or the T-bar (correction steps) within 1 min 
was counted by the test leader and was used for analysis. If the 
participant left the bar completely, the timer was paused until the 
participant was back in the initial position.
Anthropometrics
Height was measured with a height measuring scale (accuracy: 
0.1 cm) with the participants standing upright not wearing shoes. 
Weight was measured by using an electronic scale (Soehnle, 
Murrhardt, Germany; accuracy: 0.1 kg), while participants wore 
sports clothes and no shoes. The measurements were performed 
each year by the same skilled test leaders. BMI was calculated 
 
as body mass divided by height squared (kg/m2).
Data analysis
All statistical tests were conducted using SPSS statistical soft-
ware for Windows Version 23.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, 
 
NY, USA). Linear regression models were used to test if assess-
ment year was a significant predictor of performance in the four 
motoric tests, having the year of examination as independent 
factor. The assumptions of linear regression were tested and 
confir 
med. Analyses were conducted for each sex and each test 
separately. In a second step, multiple regression analysis was con-
ducted to detect if the effects of assessment year were influenced 
by BMI, i.e., assessment year and BMI were included together as 
independent factors. Again, analyses were made for each sex and 
each test separately. For expressing temporal trends as change in 
percent, B coefficient of each test was multiplied by 10 to express 
the mean change per decade. Subsequently, we calculated the 
percentage of change in relation to the mean test performance. 
The significance level for all statistical tests was set a priori  
to α = 0.05.
resUlTs
Figure 1 displays mean values of performance in (a) “6-min run,” 
(b) “push-ups,” (c) “20-m sprint,” and (d) “static stand” for boys 
and girls separately.
Table 2 shows the results of linear regression analyses, dis-
playing the effects of assessment year on performance within the 
four tests.
In linear regression analyses, assessment year had a sig-
nificantly negative effect on the distance covered within the 
aerobic fitness test “6 min run” in boys. Among girls, the effect 
of assessment year was positive but not significant. For the 
strength test “push-ups” no significant effect of assessment year 
could have been observed neither for boys nor for girls. Values 
within the speed test “20 m sprint” were negatively affected 
by assessment year in boys and even more in girls, with lower 
values reflecting higher performance. For the balance test 
“static stand” significant effects of assessment year could have 
been observed, too. Assessment year negatively affected the 
number of correction steps (reflecting a positive performance 
trend) in boys and in girls. Overall, the explained variance of

the models was very low, with the highest value for girls in the 
test “static stand.”
Table 3 shows the results of the multiple regression analysis. 
Except for the test “push-ups,” BMI significantly predicted test 
performance. However, all significant effects of assessment year 
on test results remained nearly unchanged after including BMI 
into the model.
Expressing the trends of motor performance in percent, the 
mean change per decade in aerobic fitness performance was 
−2.3% (−4.0 to −0.5) in boys and 0.9% (−0.8 to 2.6) in girls. 
For strength performance, mean change per decade was 0.7% 
(−3.3 to 4.7) in boys and −0.5% (−4.5 to 3.3) in girls. For speed 
performance, mean change was 2.7% (1.7 to 4.0) in boys and 4.3% 
(3.3 to 5.5) in girls, and for balance performance, it was 22.8% 
(16.6 to 29.0) in boys and 41.1% (34.2 to 47.8) in girls.
DiscUssiOn
The aim of the present study was to examine trends in motor 
performance of first grade students during a period of 10 years 
(2006–2015). Overall, we found a negative trend in aerobic 
fitness performance in boys but a stable performance in girls. 
 
In the strength performance test no trend over time could have 
been detected. Performance in speed and balance tests increased 
in both boys and girls. These findings held true even when BMI 
was considered as a confounder.
Aerobic fitness performance decreased in boys. This result is 
in line with the results of the reviews of Tomkinson and Olds 
(4) and Malina (14), where a negative trend of aerobic fitness 
between the 1970s and 2000 is shown. Moreover, the majority 
of the studies on trends over the last two decades also show a 
decline (7, 16, 17). Thus, our results support the assumption of 
an ongoing negative trend in aerobic fitness in boys. However, 
the effect (B- and β-coefficients) was small and the observed 
decline was smaller than in another examination from Germany, 
where cross-sectional data of different studies are compared (25). 
 
The divergence could be due to different methodological 
approaches and due to the time periods considered, as in the 
latter study trends between 1976 and 2005 are analyzed. In girls, 
aerobic fitness was stable over the 10-year period. This result 
is contrary to former studies which find a negative trend (4, 7, 
16–18, 25). Only one study discovers a positive trend among its 
female sample (19). However, Tambalis et al. show in their study 
that performance of children living in rural areas did not change 
between 1997 and 2007, while performance of children in urban 
areas decreased (26). In our study, most of the schools where the 
sample was recruited are located in rural areas. With respect to 
the results of Tambalis et al., this might be a possible explanation

for the stable performance in girls and for the relatively small 
decline in boys.
Strength performance did not change over time, neither in 
boys nor in girls. Stability of strength performance in both boys 
and girls is also shown in a large systematic review for the time 
period between the 1960s and 2003 (3). While evidence for trends 
of strength performance during this time period is quite good, 
trend analyses for the time period between 2000 and today are 
rare. We found one study by Tambalis et al. reporting a stable 
performance between 1997 and 2007 (7). Another study reports 
a positive change between 1992/1993 and 2006/2007 (19), and 
a third study reports a negative change between 2001 and 2006 
(20). Out of these three studies, Tambalis et al. are the only ones 
who performed tests every year and thus offer a higher reliability. 
With our results we confirm their results of a stability in strength 
performance in children. Our results suggest that the stability 
holds true until today. However, this suggestion should be taken 
with care, as evidence is small and results showed a huge vari-
ability in strength performance for both sexes in our study.
Speed performance increased in both sexes over the period 
of 10 years. Again, our results are in line with the results of the 
Greek study of Tambalis et al. (7), but differ from results of the 
study of Dos Santos et al., where a negative change is observed 
for boys and girls (16). In our study, effects were relatively high 
compared to aerobic fitness and strength test results and the posi-
tive trend was even higher in girls. Similar findings are reported 
in the Greek study, where the increase in girls is also higher than 
in boys (7). Compared to the trend from the 1960s to 2000, where 
a relative stability of speed performance in children is shown (3), 
it seems that between 2000 and today the trend line increased 
and today’s children are faster than children were in earlier times.
Balance performance also increased in both boys and girls 
from 2006 to 2015. Compared to the other test results, effects 
in balance performance were the highest, reflecting a relatively 
strong positive trend in balance performance, especially in girls. 
Another study, comparing the balance performance of Estonian 
and Lithuanian adolescents finds a decline in the Estonian group, 
while performance in the Lithuanians increases (27). In addition, 
German scientists published material on changes in balance per-
formance, comparing their results with results of former German 
studies. They also find an increase in the test “static stand” in 
their sample (28). Though, comparability of these studies is lim-
ited, as both include adolescents (11 years and older) and their 
methodological approach is different.
Body mass index predicted test performance. This result 
was expected, as BMI and motor performance were shown to 
be associated (1). However, BMI was included into the model 
to test if BMI was a confounder of the assessment year effects. 
 
By adding BMI into the regression models, effects of assessment 
year on test results remained significant. Actually, effects of 
assessment year remained almost unchanged. Tambalis et al. test 
the contrary hypothesis, i.e., that motor performance accounts for 
BMI trends in children. Likewise, after introducing the aerobic 
fitness variable into their model, obesity trends remain signifi-
cant with practically unchanged effect sizes (7). In addition, Olds 
et al. report persisting performance differences after matching 
their sample for overweight (8). It seems as if BMI can explain 
changes in performance only to some extent, and our study 
suggested that this holds true for performance in aerobic fitness, 
and moreover in speed and balance. These results indicated that 
changed lifestyle [e.g., level of physical activity, participation in 
organized sports, media use, transport patterns (15)] might be a 
substantial cause of changes in motor performance.
Comparing the identified trends overall, our results showed 
that trends in the four motor performance dimensions differed. It 
can be speculated that these differences have at least two reasons. 
First, speed and balance performance could have increased due 
to the fact that—in contrast to most other Western countries 
(15)—participation rates in organized sports in young children 
increased within the last years in Germany (20). Moreover, par-
ticipation starts at an early age with 41% of the 4-year olds and 54% 
of the 5-year olds being a member of a sports club (29). Organized 
sports programs probably focus on games and exercises suit-
able for young children, which are more likely to train speed and 
coordination instead of aerobic fitness. This could be a reason for 
the positive trend in speed and balance, as in former years young 
children were not specifically trained in such a way. Second, it is 
shown that everyday physical activity in children declined within 
recent years, as transport patterns changed from active to passive 
transport as well as to a more “dependent mobility” and the time 
playing outside decreased (15) [playing outdoors is strongly related 
to energy expenditure (30)]. The decrease in everyday physical 
activity might be a reason for the decline of aerobic fitness in boys 
in our study. Furthermore, in this study trends in girls were overall 
more positive than in boys. Similar results were found in other 
studies, where decreases in girls are smaller than in boys (4, 20, 25), 
or increases are stronger (19). Different “starting levels” could be a 
possible explanation: it can be assumed that motor performance in 
boys was on a higher relative level than in girls in earlier times. This 
could be due to the assumption that girls were more protected by 
their parents and thus played less outdoors, their games were more 
sedentary (e.g., playing with dolls vs. playing soccer) and boys 
had higher levels of overall physical activity (30). Therefore, their 
relative motor performance level was probably lower. So changes 
in lifestyle could have had less negative/stronger positive effects 
on their motor performance than on boys’ motor performance. 
 
In addition, it is shown that in Germany sports club participation 
increased more among girls than among boys (20). This could have 
had an impact on the more positive trends in girls, too.
The present study has some strengths and limitations that 
should be considered when interpreting the findings. Exam-
inations took place in each year between 2006 and 2015, allowing 
the description of trends instead of single comparisons between 
measurement points. Moreover, data collection was region-
exhaustive. However, as data are restricted to a regional sample it 
is not representative for Germany. Performed tests are validated 
and approved, but testing procedures were partly suboptimal, as 
the time needed for “20-m sprint” was measured manually and 
not with the use of a light barrier. The test “static stand” was used 
to measure balance. However, balance covers only one part of the 
complex motor performance ability dimension “coordination.” 
Further, comparisons with other studies should be interpreted 
with care, as at some stage different motor performance tests were 
used (e.g., “shuttle run” vs. “6-min run” to test aerobic fitness).

Nevertheless, this study accounted for all four dimensions of 
motor performance ability (10) which contributed to a compre-
hensive picture of trends in motor performance of children.
In summary, this study only partly supported the widely 
believed assumption that the motor performance of children 
declines: in our study, aerobic fitness declined in boys—which 
is in line with other studies (4, 14)—but not in girls. All the 
other assessed dimensions of performance remained stable or 
even increased in both sexes. Strength performance remained 
stable. This is also shown by Tomkinson (3). In contrast, speed 
performance increased, while older studies present it as stable (3). 
 
Concerning balance performance, there are few studies to be 
found in the literature and results are heterogeneous (27, 28). 
In our study, balance performance increased substantially in 
 
both sexes. In addition, we showed that for all performance dimen-
sions BMI explained changes only to a small extent. Changed 
 
lifestyles might be a substantial cause. More studies on recent 
trends and interacting variables are needed to support our results 
and to provide further knowledge on causes of these trends.
