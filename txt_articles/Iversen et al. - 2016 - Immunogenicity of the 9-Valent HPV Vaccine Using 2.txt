IMPORTANCE Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause anogenital cancers and warts.
The 9-valent HPV vaccine provides protection against 7 high-risk types of HPV responsible
for 90% of cervical cancers and 2 other HPV types accounting for 90% of genital warts.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether HPV type–specific antibody responses would be noninferior
among girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years after receiving 2 doses of the 9-valent HPV vaccine
compared with adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years receiving 3 doses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label, noninferiority, immunogenicity trial
conducted at 52 ambulatory care sites in 15 countries. The study was initiated on December
16, 2013, with the last participant visit for this report on June 19, 2015. Five cohorts were
enrolled: (1) girls aged 9 to 14 years to receive 2 doses 6 months apart (n = 301); (2) boys aged
9 to 14 years to receive 2 doses 6 months apart (n = 301); (3) girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years
to receive 2 doses 12 months apart (n = 301); (4) girls aged 9 to 14 years to receive 3 doses
over 6 months (n = 301); and (5) a control group of adolescent girls and young women aged
16 to 26 years to receive 3 doses over 6 months (n = 314).
INTERVENTIONS Two doses of the 9-valent HPV vaccine administered 6 or 12 months apart or
3 doses administered over 6 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was prespecified as the antibody
response against each HPV type assessed 1 month after the last dose using a competitive
immunoassay. Each of the three 2-dose regimens was compared with the standard 3-dose
schedule in adolescent girls and young women using a noninferiority margin of 0.67 for the
ratio of the antibody geometric mean titers.
RESULTS Of the 1518 participants (753 girls [mean age, 11.4 years]; 451 boys [mean age, 11.5
years]; and 314 adolescent girls and young women [mean age, 21.0 years]), 1474 completed
the study and data from 1377 were analyzed. At 4 weeks after the last dose, HPV antibody
responses in girls and boys given 2 doses were noninferior to HPV antibody responses in
adolescent girls and young women given 3 doses (P < .001 for each HPV type). Compared
with adolescent girls and young women who received 3 doses over 6 months, the 1-sided
97.5% CIs for the ratio of HPV antibody geometric mean titers at 1 month after the last dose
across the 9 HPV subtypes ranged from 1.36 to � to 2.50 to � for girls who received 2 doses 6
months apart; from 1.37 to � to 2.55 to � for boys who received 2 doses 6 months apart; and
from 1.61 to � to 5.36 to � for girls and boys who received 2 doses 12 months apart.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years receiving 2-dose
regimens of a 9-valent HPV vaccine separated by 6 or 12 months, immunogenicity 4 weeks
after the last dose was noninferior to a 3-dose regimen in a cohort of adolescent girls and
young women. Further research is needed to assess persistence of antibody responses and
effects on clinical outcomes.

iseases related to the human papillomavirus (HPV)
impose a substantial health care burden on both the
developing and developed world.1 A 9-valent HPV
vaccine was developed to prevent infection and disease from
the 9 HPV types (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31,
HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, HPV-58) responsible for causing
approximately 90% of cervical cancers and other HPV-
related anogenital cancers and 90% of genital warts,1-4 thus
providing broader coverage than the earlier bivalent (HPV-16,
HPV-18) and quadrivalent (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18)
vaccines. In the pivotal trial5 in young women, 3 doses of
the 9-valent HPV vaccine reduced infection and disease from
all 9 vaccine types.
Clinical efficacy cannot be directly tested during early
adolescence because of limited exposure to HPV. Efficacy of
all HPV vaccines has been demonstrated as a 3-dose series in
young women.5,6 In contrast, efficacy in young adolescents
has been inferred from the demonstration of noninferior HPV
antibody responses compared with young women (immuno-
bridging). With the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, anti-
body responses 1 month after the second dose in girls within
the 9- to 14-year age range who received a 2-dose regimen
were noninferior to responses in adolescent girls and young
women within the 15- to 26-year age range given 3 doses.7-12
Based on these results, vaccine efficacy previously estab-
lished in young women receiving 3 doses was inferred for
younger age groups receiving 2 doses. In 2014, the World
Health Organization changed its recommendation for routine
HPV vaccination of girls aged 9 to 14 years from a 3-dose to a
2-dose schedule based on data from clinical trials with the
bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines.13
In this study, immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen of the
9-valent HPV vaccine was assessed using standard immuno-
bridging criteria by comparing antibody responses to vaccine
types in girls and boys given 2 doses separated by 6 or 12
months vs antibody responses in adolescent girls and young
women given the standard 3-dose regimen.
Methods
Study Design
An international clinical trial was conducted of the immu-
nogenicity and safety of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in girls
and boys aged 9 to 14 years given 2 doses 6 or 12 months
apart compared with a control group of adolescent girls and
young women aged 16 to 26 years given the standard 3-dose
schedule. The protocol is available in Supplement 1. This
study assessed whether a 2-dose regimen of the 9-valent
HPV vaccine in girls and boys would likely be protective
by bridging antibody responses to the older group of ad-
olescent girls and young women shown to be protected
against HPV infection and disease. Such an approach allows
direct comparison with antibody geometric mean titers
(GMTs) proven to be effective against clinically meaningful
end points.
The trial was initiated on December 16, 2013, at 52
ambulatory care sites in 15 countries and was conducted
according to good clinical practice principles. The protocol
was approved by the regulatory agencies of all participating
countries and by the institutional review boards with juris-
diction over the study sites. All participants or their parents
or guardians signed informed consent at entry. Enrollment
was concluded on April 18, 2014, but follow-up is ongoing to
assess antibody persistence through month 36. The last par-
ticipant visit contributing to the current report occurred on
June 19, 2015.
Eligible girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years had to be gener-
ally healthy and not sexually active prior to enrollment. Ado-
lescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years had to be
generallyhealthywith4orfewerlifetimesexualpartners,with-
out a history of abnormal Papanicolaou test results or other
cervical abnormalities, and agree to use effective contracep-
tion through study month 7. Participants were required to be
afebrile(oraltemperature<37.8°C)for24hoursbeforeeachvac-
cine injection.
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, known allergy to
any vaccine component, thrombocytopenia, prior or ongo-
ing immunosuppression, or previous receipt of an HPV vac-
cine. An interactive voice response system was used to allo-
cate study participants, balance randomization between
sites, and assist with vaccine supply management at the
study sites.
The 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9, Merck & Co) was
administered to 5 vaccination cohorts. The first cohort was
composed of girls aged 9 to 14 years who were randomized to
receive 2 doses of the HPV vaccine 6 months apart (at 0 and 6
months); the second cohort, boys aged 9 to 14 years were ran-
domized to receive 2 doses of the HPV vaccine 6 months
apart (at 0 and 6 months); the third cohort, girls and boys
aged 9 to 14 years were randomized to receive 2 doses of the
HPV vaccine 12 months apart (at 0 and 12 months); the fourth
cohort, girls aged 9 to 14 years were randomized to receive 3
doses of the HPV vaccine (at 0, 2, and 6 months); and the
fifth cohort, adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26
years were allocated to receive 3 doses of the HPV vaccine
(at 0, 2, and 6 months) (Figure).
Each vaccination cohort was to enroll approximately 300
participants. Enrollment of girls and boys was stratified into
Key Points
Question Are 2 doses of the 9-valent human papillomavirus
(HPV) vaccine in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years noninferior to
3 doses in adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years?
Findings In this international, open-label, noninferiority trial
involving 1518 participants, antibody responses measured 4 weeks
after the last dose in girls and boys given 2 doses separated by 6 or
12 months were noninferior to responses in adolescent girls and
young women given 3 doses.
Meaning Short-term immune responses after 2 doses of 9-valent
HPV vaccine in girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years were noninferior
to immune responses after 3 doses in adolescent girls and young
women. Persistence of response and clinical outcomes need
to be studied.

Participants were observed for 30 minutes after each
vaccine injection for any immediate reaction. Serious ad-
verse events were to be reported irrespective of causality from
day 1 (month 0) through 6 months after the last vaccination.
Serious adverse events were predefined as those events that
resulted in death, were deemed life-threatening, led to a per-
sistentorsignificantdisability,requiredhospitalization,orwere
associated with a congenital anomaly, cancer, or other impor-
tantmedicalevent.Investigatorswereinstructedtoassigncau-
sality to adverse events on the basis of exposure, time course,
likely cause, and consistency with the vaccine’
s known safety
profile (extensively described in previous trials).14
Outcomes
The primary end point was prespecified as the antibody
response against HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31,
HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58 assessed just prior to
the first dose and 1 month after the last dose (after dose 2 or
after dose 3 depending on the assigned vaccine schedule)
using a competitive Luminex immunoassay.15 The second-
ary end point was seropositivity rates assessed just prior to
the first dose and 1 month after the last dose of the given
regimen. Seroconversion was defined as a changing serosta-
tus from seronegative at baseline to seropositive by 4 weeks
after the last vaccine dose. Serostatus cutoffs were defined
as the antibody level above the assay’
s lower limit of quanti-
fication that reliably distinguished samples classified by
clinical likelihood of HPV infection and positive or negative
status using previous versions of the competitive Luminex
immunoassay.
A participant with an antibody titer at or above the pre-
determined cutoff for a given HPV type was considered sero-
positive for that type. Antibody titers function as a surrogate
marker for vaccine protection in children before sexual de-
but, although the actual minimum antibody concentration
needed for prevention has not been established. Human pap-
illomavirus seropositivity at day 1 was not a reason for exclu-
sionfromthestudy;however,itwasareasonforexclusionfrom
the HPV type–specific per-protocol analyses.
In the primary noninferiority analyses using the per-
protocol population, antibody GMTs at 1 month after the last
dose in girls and boys who received 2 doses (6 or 12 months
apart) were compared with antibody GMTs at 1 month after the
last dose in adolescent girls and young women who received
3 doses over 6 months. A supportive intention-to-treat analy-
sis was conducted in all randomized participants. The pre-
specified secondary analyses examined noninferiority of se-
ropositivity rates at 1 month after the last dose in girls and
boys who received 2 doses vs adolescent girls and young
women who received 3 doses.
Exploratory analyses were planned to summarize anti-
body GMTs at 1 month after the last dose in girls and boys
who received 2 doses by age strata. Four hypothesis-
generating post hoc analyses were performed comparing
(1) antibody GMTs 6 months after the last dose in girls and
boys who received 2 doses 6 months apart vs adolescent girls
and young women who received 3 doses; (2) antibody GMTs
1 month after the last dose in girls and boys who received 2
doses vs girls who received 3 doses; (3) antibody GMTs
1 month after the last dose in girls who received 3 doses vs
adolescent girls and young women who received 3 doses; and
(4) 2-dose regimens separated by 6 or 12 months.
Statistical Analyses
As a noninferiority trial, the primary analysis used the per-
protocol population. Participants were required to (1) be se-
ronegative at day 1 for the HPV type being analyzed (for the
HPV-6 and HPV-11 immunogenicity analyses, participants had
to be seronegative for both HPV-6 and HPV-11); (2) receive all
planneddosesofthevaccinewithinpredetermineddayranges;
(3) have a serology result after the last dose within an accept-
able time window; and (4) have no other protocol violations
that could interfere with the evaluation of the participant’
s im-
mune response to the vaccine.
Noninferiority of antibody GMTs at 1 month after the
last dose in girls and boys who received 2 doses vs adoles-
cent girls and young women who received 3 doses (primary
immunogenicity hypothesis) was tested by constructing a
2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of antibody GMTs as stipulated
by the trial protocol. Although 2-sided 95% CIs were pre-
specified by the protocol, 1-sided 97.5% CIs are presented
for the primary immunogenicity hypotheses in keeping
with currently accepted methods of presenting noninferior-
ity results.
Prespecified noninferiority criteria required that the lower
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI (equivalent to the lower bound
of the 1-sided 97.5% CI) for the ratio of antibody GMTs in girls
and boys who received 2 doses relative to antibody GMTs in
adolescent girls and young women who received 3 doses to be
0.67 or greater for each of the 9 vaccine HPV types. For an in-
dividual HPV type, the 95% CI for the ratio of antibody GMTs
was derived from an analysis of variance model with the log
of type-specific antibody titers as the response and vaccina-
tion group as the fixed effect.
The lower bound of 0.67 represents a more conservative
choice than the 0.5 limit used in the earlier bridging noninfe-
riority study of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.9,16 The spe-
cific choice of the noninferiority margin was based on protec-
tive antibody levels in the pivotal efficacy trials of the
quadrivalent HPV vaccine, which informed benchmarks set by
Merck in conjunction with regulatory agencies for bridging
studies leading to licensure.
Noninferiority of seroconversion rates at 1 month after
the last dose in girls and boys given 2 doses vs adolescent
girls and young women given 3 doses (secondary immuno-
genicity hypothesis) was tested by constructing a 2-sided
95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates (girls,
boys, or girls and boys minus adolescent girls and young

women). Although 2-sided 95% CIs were again prespecified,
1-sided 97.5% CIs are presented for the secondary immuno-
genicity hypotheses to be consistent with currently
accepted methods of presenting noninferiority results. Pre-
specified noninferiority criteria required that the lower
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI (equivalent to the lower bound
of the 1-sided 97.5% CI) for the difference in seroconversion
rates exceed −5 percentage points for each HPV type. All
data analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc).
To satisfy the 3 primary immunogenicity hypotheses,
noninferiority criteria had to be met for all 9 HPV types;
thus, no multiplicity adjustment was made to account for
the multiple HPV types within each hypothesis. A closed
stepwise procedure was used to control for multiplicity
resulting from 3 primary hypotheses and to ensure an over-
all 1-sided type I error rate at the 0.025 level. Noninferiority
in girls vaccinated at 0 and 6 months had to be established
vs adolescent girls and young women vaccinated at 0, 2,
and 6 months before noninferiority in boys vaccinated at
0 and 6 months vs adolescent girls and young women vacci-
nated at 0, 2, and 6 months was tested. Similarly, noninferi-
ority in boys vaccinated at 0 and 6 months vs adolescent
girls and young women vaccinated at 0, 2, and 6 months
had to be established before noninferiority in girls and boys
vaccinated at 0 and 12 months vs adolescent girls and young
women vaccinated at 0, 2, and 6 months was tested.
With the planned sample size of approximately 300 par-
ticipants per cohort, the study had greater than 99% power
to establish the primary immunogenicity hypothesis at a
1-sided significance level of 0.025, assuming a true ratio of
antibody GMTs of 1.2 for all 9 vaccine HPV types, an exclu-
sion rate from the per-protocol analyses of 20% for girls and
boys and 30% for adolescent girls and young women, an SD
of 1.2 for the natural log-transformed titers, and a noninferi-
ority margin with a 1.5-fold difference for the ratio of anti-
body GMTs.
Every participant who received at least 1 study vaccina-
tion and had follow-up data was included in the safety
analysis. Because the safety profile of the 9-valent HPV vac-
cine has already been characterized in phase 3 clinical
studies,14 the protocol did not use vaccination report cards.

actively solicited (although investigators could report such
events at their discretion). Consequently, the frequencies of
nonserious adverse events reported in this study cannot be

that used vaccination report cards.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
A total of 1536 potential participants were screened for inclu-
sion in the study and 1518 (753 girls [mean age, 11.4 years];
451 boys [mean age, 11.5 years]; and 314 adolescent girls and
young women [mean age, 21.0 years]) were enrolled, includ-
ing 1516 who received at least 1 vaccine dose (Figure). Overall,
1474 completed the study and data from 1377 (274 girls aged
9-14 years randomized to receive 2 vaccine doses 6 months
apart; 273 boys aged 9-14 years randomized to receive 2
doses 6 months apart; 269 girls and boys aged 9-14 years ran-
domized to receive 2 doses 12 months apart; 275 girls aged
9-14 years randomized to receive 3 doses over 6 months; and
286 adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years
allocated to receive 3 doses over 6 months) were included in
the per-protocol analyses.
Baseline characteristics of randomized participants ap-
pear in Table 1. The most common reasons for exclusion from
the per-protocol immunogenicity analyses were seropositiv-
ity for a HPV type included in the vaccine on day 1 or a miss-
ing result for the primary end point collected 4 weeks after the
last vaccination (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Immunogenicity
Antibody GMTs against the 9 HPV types assayed 1 month
after the last dose were consistently higher in girls (vaccine
doses at 0 and 6 months), boys (vaccine doses at 0 and 6
months), and girls and boys (vaccine doses at 0 and 12
months) than for adolescent girls and young women (vaccine
doses at 0, 2, and 6 months) in the per-protocol population
(Table 2). Compared with adolescent girls and young women
who received 3 doses over 6 months, the 1-sided 97.5% CIs
for the ratio of antibody GMTs at 1 month after the last dose
across the 9 HPV vaccine subtypes ranged from 1.36 to � to
2.50 to � for girls who received vaccine doses at 0 and 6
months; from 1.37 to � to 2.55 to � for boys who received
doses at 0 and 6 months; and from 1.61 to � to 5.36 to � for
girls and boys who received doses at 0 and 12 months.
Accordingly, noninferiority criteria of antibody GMTs
were met for all 9 HPV types for the 27 primary comparisons
(all P < .001). Similar results were found in supportive
analyses of the intention-to-treat population (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2).

pared with adolescent girls and young women (vaccine doses
at 0, 2, and 6 months) were less than −5 percentage points for
all comparisons (Table 3). Thus, the noninferiority criteria for
seroconversion rates were met for all 9 HPV types for the 27
secondary comparisons (all P < .001).
In a planned exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis
of antibody GMTs by age strata among girls and boys receiv-
ing a 2-dose regimen (eTable 3 in Supplement 2), antibody
GMTs for each age stratum of girls and boys receiving 2 doses
on a 6- or 12-month schedule were higher than in adolescent
girls and young women given 3 doses over 6 months.
Post hoc hypothesis-generating analyses at 1 month after
the last dose showed that the 2-dose regimen given at 0 and
6 months in girls aged 9 to 14 years resulted in higher anti-
body GMTs against 5 HPV types (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16,
HPV-33, HPV-58) and lower antibody GMTs against 4 HPV
types (HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-45, HPV-52) than the 3-dose regi-
men given at 0, 2, and 6 months in girls aged 9 to 14 years.
The 2-dose regimen given at 0 and 12 months to girls aged 9
to 14 years resulted in higher antibody GMTs against 8 HPV
types (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-
52, HPV-58) and lower antibody GMTs against 1 HPV type
(HPV-45) than the 3-dose regimen given at 0, 2, and 6 months
in girls (Table 4). Similar relative results for antibody GMTs
also were seen for boys after 2 doses compared with girls
after 3 doses (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
A post hoc analysis was performed to assess the persis-
tence of antibody responses at 6 months after the last dose
in the vaccine groups receiving 2 or 3 doses on a 6-month
schedule. Although antibody GMTs declined in all 4 cohorts
(girls, vaccine doses at 0 and 6 months; boys, doses at 0 and
6 months; girls and boys, doses at 0 and 12 months; adoles-
cent girls and young women, doses at 0, 2, and 6 months)
over the 5-month period from study month 7 to study
month 12, the ratio of antibody GMTs for responses after 2
doses in girls and boys relative to 3 doses in adolescent girls
and young women were maintained above the noninferior-
ity threshold (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). Another post hoc
analysis of girls aged 9 to 14 years receiving doses at 0, 2,
and 6 months showed that antibody GMTs against HPV
types in the vaccine were higher in girls than in adolescent
girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2).
In a hypothesis-generating analysis contrasting 2 doses
separated by 6 or 12 months, antibody GMTs were higher in
thecohortofgirlsandboysgivendosesat0and12monthsthan
in either the cohort of girls or cohort of boys given doses at 0
and 6 months with nonoverlapping 2-sided 95% CIs for all HPV
types except HPV-45 (Table 2).
Safety and Tolerability
Twenty-two participants experienced serious adverse events
(eTable 7 in Supplement 2), none of which were considered
related to the vaccine. One participant (a 9-year-old girl) dis-
continued the study because of a vaccine-related adverse
event of transient urticaria 1 day after the first dose of vac-
cine, which fully resolved. There were no deaths during the
course of the study.

Discussion
In an international immunogenicity trial of the 9-valent HPV
vaccine, HPV type–specific antibody responses in girls and
boys aged 9 to 14 years after 2 doses separated by 6 or 12
months were noninferior to responses in adolescent girls and
young women aged 16 to 26 years after the standard 3-dose
series. Quantitative antibody responses to HPV vaccines tend
to be higher in children than in adults, as previously shown
in studies assessing a 3-dose schedule.17,18 In this study, an
exploratory analysis found that antibody GMTs at 1 month
after the last dose were higher in each subgroup of girls and
boys vaccinated with 2 doses when categorized by age strata
(9-10 years, 11-12 years, and 13-14 years) than in adolescent
girls and young women after 3 doses for all 9 HPV types.
These observations suggest that the overall results of the pri-
mary immunogenicity analyses may be applicable across the
entire studied age range of girls and boys.
In exploratory analyses, antibody GMTs at 1 month after
the last dose were lower for some HPV types in girls who re-
ceived a 2-dose series compared with girls who received a
3-dose series. Previous studies of 2-dose regimens of the bi-
valent or quadrivalent vaccines had also reported lower anti-
body responses with 2 doses for some HPV vaccine types
(HPV-16 for the bivalent vaccine and HPV-18 for the quadriva-
lent vaccine).9,10 Vaccine-mediated protection against HPV in-
fection is thought to be primarily mediated through neutral-
izingantibodies.19Highseroconversionrateshaveconsistently
occurred after HPV vaccination but the minimum protective
titer has not been established.
The relevant objective of this study was to demonstrate
that 2 doses given to boys and girls aged 9 to 14 years led to
protective antibody levels as operationally quantified by effi-
cacy trials, and was not to show which age group and dosing
regimen achieved the highest antibody levels. The 2-dose regi-
mens were limited to girls and boys in this study to take ad-
vantage of the recognized higher immunogenicity in the
younger age cohort. Without direct evidence of vaccine effi-
cacy in girls, the clinical significance of these differences in im-
munogenicity is unknown.
Dosing interval appears to be an important determinant
of immunogenicity. In studies of 3-dose regimens of the qua-
drivalent HPV vaccine, a longer interval preceding the third
dose (ie, third dose at month 12 instead of at month 6) re-
sultedinhigherantibodyresponsesafterthethirddose.20Like-
wise, a longer interval between the first 2 doses (ie, 12 months
vs 3 or 6 months) resulted in higher antibody responses after
the second dose.21-23
Vaccination with a 2-dose regimen separated by short in-
tervals is likely to be less immunogenic than separation by lon-
ger intervals. In the current study, HPV antibody responses
were generally higher in girls and boys who received 2 doses
at a 12-month interval than in girls and boys who received 2
doses 6 months apart. These results allow for some flexibility
in the spacing of the second dose.
The European Medicines Agency approved the 2-dose
regimen of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in April 2016 for young

adolescents aged 9 to 14 years,24 recommending that the sec-
ond dose be administered 5 to 13 months after the first dose.
Similarly, the World Health Organization recommended
administration of 2 doses separated by 6 months or longer,
without specifying a maximum interval.13 In this regard,
postlicensure observational data indicate that administering
the second dose earlier than 5 months after the initial dose
may be associated with reduced effectiveness.25,26
This study provides a broad evaluation of the immunoge-
nicity of 2-dose schedules of the 9-valent HPV vaccine (in-
cluding a direct comparison of 2 alternative schedules in both
girls and boys); however, there are several limitations. First,
because children are typically not exposed to HPV prior to
adolescence, efficacy of prophylactic HPV vaccines cannot be
directly assessed in this population. Thus, the primary objec-
tive was to demonstrate noninferior immunogenicity com-
pared with a group in whom efficacy had been established.
Second, although this approach has been widely adopted by
regulators, there are no universally accepted noninferiority
criteria. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that antibody responses
in girls and boys who received 2 doses were consistently and
substantially greater than the protective responses seen in
adolescent girls and young women who received 3 doses.
Third, effectiveness and antibody responses over time
were not evaluated. The ratio of antibody GMTs comparing
2-dose with 3-dose regimens for the bivalent and quadriva-
lent vaccines can vary over time.9,27 Observational studies
suggest that administration of less than 3 doses may be asso-
ciated with reduced effectiveness, although prevalent HPV
infection and noncompletion of the vaccination schedule
may itself be associated with higher-risk behavior and com-
pliant participants may therefore be at lower risk of HPV
exposure.25,26,28-34 Duration of protection is important both
from clinical and public health standpoints.35 Evaluation of
antibody persistence is ongoing and assessment of the dura-
tion of protection is planned. The 2-dose schedule has not
been tested in persons aged 15 years or older.
In many countries, HPV vaccination rates remain
suboptimal.36Usinganeffective2-doseregimenentailingfewer
visitscouldimproveadherencetoHPVvaccinationprograms.35
Coadministration of the 9-valent HPV vaccine with diphthe-
ria,tetanus,pertussis,polio,andmeningococcalvaccinescould
also be completed at the same visit, which has been demon-
stratedinclinicalstudies.37,38Basedonhealtheconomicsmod-
eling, use of a 2-dose vaccination schedule could potentially
reduce the total costs of HPV vaccination.13,39
Conclusions
Among girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years receiving 2-dose regi-
mens of a 9-valent HPV vaccine separated by 6 or 12 months,
immunogenicity 4 weeks after the last dose was noninferior
to a 3-dose regimen in a cohort of adolescent girls and young
women. Further research is needed to assess persistence of an-
tibody responses and effects on clinical outcomes.
