Background: STRRIDE (Studies Targeting Risk Reduction Interventions through
Defined Exercise) was an eight-month exercise study conducted from 1998–2003.
Subjects were randomized to control or one of three exercise groups differing in intensity
and amount. To determine if there were legacy effects, we invited 161 individuals who
completed the intervention phase to return for a 10-year Reunion study.
Methods: Subjects completed medical history and physical activity questionnaires.
Height, body weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, and peak VO2 were
measured. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin and lipids. Of
161 original subjects, 153 were within 10 years of STRRIDE completion. Of these, 28
were lost to follow-up and 21 declined to participate in the Reunion study. Overall, 104
subjects (83% eligible) participated. Change over time was computed as the 10-year
Reunion value minus the pre-intervention value. Significant within group changes were
calculated using two-tailed t-tests. ANCOVA determined differences among groups with
pre-intervention values as covariates. Bonferroni corrections were applied to account for
multiple comparisons.
Results: Ten years after completing STRRIDE, there were a number of group-
specific health and fitness legacy effects. Original participation in either the moderate
intensity exercise or control group resulted in a 10.5% decrease in peak VO2 over the
ensuing 10 years. Conversely, both vigorous intensity groups experienced only a 4.7%
decrement in cardiorespiratory fitness over that time period. As compared to controls, all
three exercise groups experienced smaller increases in waist circumference. Those who
participated in moderate intensity exercise experienced the greatest 10-year reduction
in fasting insulin. Compared to all other groups, the moderate intensity subjects had
greater reductions in mean arterial pressure at the Reunion timepoint.

Legacy Effects of Exercise Training
Summary: Ten years after completing a randomized eight-month exercise training
intervention, previously sedentary individuals exhibited group-specific differences
consistent with an intervention-based legacy effect on cardiorespiratory fitness and
cardiometabolic parameters. These findings highlight the critical need to better
understand the sustained legacy health effects of exercise training interventions.

INTRODUCTION
According to the 2008 United States Physical Activity Guidelines
Advisory Committee Report, “Very strong scientific evidence
based on a wide range of well-conducted studies shows that
physically active people have higher levels of health-related
fitness, a lower risk profile for developing a number of
disabling medical conditions, and lower rates of various chronic
diseases than do people who are inactive” (Physical Activity
Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008). In previously sedentary
subjects, aerobic exercise interventions lead to improvements in
cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic disease risk factors.
However, whether a period of supervised exercise training of
modest duration (e.g., 8-month) can result in persistent long-
term (legacy) benefits is unknown.
In medicine, a legacy effect describes the sustained benefit
of a treatment long after cessation of the treatment which
was given in the early phase of disease (Coppo, 2013). The
legacy effect concept was first discussed in the medical literature
by Holman et al. (2008) regarding 10-year post-trial follow-
up of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study. The
original study, a randomized controlled trial, investigated early
and strict control of diabetes in over 5,000 patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although between-group
differences in glycated hemoglobin were lost within one year
of treatment cessation, over 66,000 person-years of follow-
up revealed significant, persistent cardiovascular benefits of
intensive blood glucose control therapy (sulfonylurea-insulin
or metformin) on micro- and macrovascular complications
compared to patients randomized to the conventional therapy
group (Holman et al., 2008). Additional results supporting
potential legacy health effects have been documented from long-
term follow-up of lipid-lowering statin trials, including reduced
cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, and increased
quality-of-life compared to controls (Sever et al., 2011; Kashef
and Giugliano, 2016).
Furthermore, in three major diabetes prevention follow-up
studies, intense lifestyle interventions — involving diet, exercise
and weight loss goals — resulted in persistent beneficial effects
up to 10 years following trial cessation. The Finnish Diabetes
Prevention Study reported both improved lifestyle and decreased
diabetes risk over 13 years compared to controls (Lindstrom
et al., 2013). In the Chinese Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study,
lifestyle interventions (exercise-only, diet-only, or exercise plus
diet) conducted over 6 years prevented or delayed diabetes for up
to 14 years after the active intervention compared to participants
in the control group (Li et al., 2008). In the Da Qing study, there
was a reduced incidence of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality
and diabetes 23 years after the intervention (Li et al., 2014). In the
10-year follow-up of the Diabetes Prevention Program, a reduced
incidence of diabetes persisted in the lifestyle group for 10 years
following the end of the study (Diabetes Prevention Program
Research Group, 2009). Thus, long-term follow-up after the end
of lifestyle trials provides substantial evidence for legacy effects
resulting from even relatively short-term interventions. These
long-term benefits reported from the diabetes prevention studies
could be the result of the sustained effects of the single intensive
intervention itself, or that there may be long-term effects on
healthy lifestyle behaviors, or both.
Despite these encouraging reports, there remains little
information about the legacy effects of exercise-based programs
on long-term cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic health
benefits, and whether responses differ by the intensity or total
energy expenditure of the exercise training program. In STRRIDE
(Studies of Targeted Risk Reduction Interventions through
Defined Exercise), an 8-month randomized, controlled exercise
study, the numerous metabolic health and cardiorespiratory
benefits were often specific to the exercise intervention group.
These intervention groups exposed subjects to different amounts
and intensities of exercise training, ranging from fairly substantial
to more modest amounts and intensities. In light of the numerous
studies of intensive lifestyle interventions (i.e., diet and exercise)
and the findings of long-term legacy benefits, we invited our
STRRIDE subjects who completed the original study back for
testing 10 years later to determine if there were any legacy
benefits, and if there were, whether they were specific to the
exercise training group to which they were originally assigned.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The original STRRIDE study (1999–2003) enrolled previously
sedentary, overweight or obese men and women aged 40–65 years
with mild to moderate dyslipidemia [classified by low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): 130–190 mg/dL or high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): ≤ 40 mg/dL for men and
≤ 45 mg/dL for women] (Kraus et al., 2001). Subjects were
randomized into one of four groups: (1) inactive control; (2)
low amount/moderate intensity exercise: 14 kcal/kg of body
weight/week (KKW) at 40–55% peak oxygen consumption
(VO2); (3) low amount/vigorous intensity exercise: 14 KKW
at 65–80% peak VO2; (4) high amount/vigorous intensity: 23
KKW at 65–80% peak VO2. Subjects originally randomized to the
control group were offered the opportunity to be randomized to

Legacy Effects of Exercise Training
one of the three exercise interventions at the end of their control
period. For subjects who successfully completed the subsequent
exercise training, data collected during their control period was
not used in analysis.
All 161 individuals from the Duke study site who completed
the original STRRIDE study were invited to return for a
“Reunion” study. For practical and geographical reasons, subjects
who participated at the East Carolina University study site were
not invited to the Duke Reunion study. Subjects were invited
approximately 10 years following their study completion. The
Reunion study was approved by the Duke University Institutional
Review Board. Subjects signed written informed consent.
For the 10-year Reunion study, subjects completed medical
history and physical activity questionnaires. Expanding upon
the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire (Paffenbarger
et al., 1978), subjects completed a 23-item assessment of
frequency, duration, mode, and intensity of recent physical
activity participation. Subjects also underwent height, body mass,
resting blood pressure, minimal waist circumference (Willis et al.,
2007), and cardiorespiratory fitness assessments. Subjects were
asked to provide a fasting blood sample.
Fasting blood samples were obtained from 103 of the
Reunion subjects. Plasma was analyzed for HDL-C, triglycerides
and glucose with a Beckman-Coulter CxC600 clinical analyzer
(Brea, CA, United States). In the original STRRIDE study,
plasma glucose was determined via a YSI analyzer (Yellow
Springs, OH, United States), and HDL-C as well as triglycerides
were determined via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(LipoScience, Raleigh, NC, United States). Reunion plasma
insulins were measured by electrochemiluminescent plate assay
(Meso Scale Discovery; Gaithersburg, MD, United States),
whereas plasma insulin in the original STRRIDE study were
determined via immunoassay (Access Immunoassay System,
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, United States). We reasoned
that although different assays were used before and after the 10-
year interim, the calculated change scores should not be biased
by group assignments, permitting an assessment of differences
among the various exercise intensity and amount exposures
over time (Marcovina et al., 2007; Staten et al., 2010); However,
statistically significant change scores within a single group should
be interpreted with caution—particularly with the fasting glucose
measure — due to differences in assay parameters that may have
been used in each of the original STRRIDE and Reunion studies.
On a separate day, 89 subjects (of the 104) completed
graded
maximal
treadmill
exercise
testing
with
12-lead
electrocardiography and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2)
was measured via gas exchange (TrueMax Parvomedics; Provo,
UT, United States). As an additional marker of cardiorespiratory
fitness, we assessed submaximal exercise capacity by determining
VO2 at anaerobic threshold using the V-slope method (Beaver
et al., 1986). A plot of 15-s averages of VO2 versus VCO2 from
each exercise test was given to two separate readers in order to
determine the VO2 (mL/min) at which the anaerobic threshold
occurred. If the two reads were within 150 mL of each other, the
value for VO2 at anaerobic threshold was considered to be the
average of the two chosen values. If the values differed by more
than 150 mL, the plot was given to a third reader to confirm one
of the two reads. If the third reader was not in agreement with
either of the first two readers, the VO2 at anaerobic threshold for
that subject’s test was not included in the analysis. The result was
52 subjects with complete anaerobic threshold data.
Means and standard deviations were determined for each of
the variables collected at the 10-year Reunion visit. Absolute
change scores were calculated as the difference between the 10-
year Reunion value minus the pre-training intervention value.
We also calculated percent change as the absolute change
score divided by the pre-training value. This permitted us to
compare the combined effects of randomization, participation
and differential post-training behavior among the groups for
the entire intervention and follow-up periods. To determine
statistical significance for within group effects, two-tailed t-tests
were used; a p-value of 0.05 was used to indicate statistical
significance. For among-group effects, an analysis of variance
(ANCOVA) was used with baseline values considered covariates;
to correct for multiple comparisons, an overall p-value of
0.05 with Bonferroni post hoc analyses were performed. With
four groups, there are six possible pairwise comparisons;
therefore, alpha level for significance was set at p ≤ 0.0083
(0.05/6 comparisons) for between groups comparisons. To
address potential differences in change in fasting plasma
glucose based upon medication usage that might affect glucose
concentrations (e.g., beta-blockers, thiazides, dedicated glucose
lowering medication), we performed an additional ANOVA that
separated subjects into two groups (glucose-affecting medication
use yes/no). When assessing change in blood pressure among
the original intervention groups, blood pressure medication
usage (yes/no) was used as a covariate in our ANCOVA model.
In addition, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to
assess the relationship between self-reported exercise frequency
over the last three months (taken at the STRRIDE Reunion
timepoint) and change in cardiometabolic health variables.
All statistics were conducted using STATVIEW (SAS, Cary,
NC, United States).
RESULTS
At the Duke site, there were 161 intervention completers from the
original STRRIDE study; of these, 153 were within the 10-year
(± six-month) window. Of the 153, 28 were lost to follow-
up (7 moved, 15 unable to be contacted, 5 deceased, 1 was in
another exercise study) and 21 declined. Therefore, out of the
possible 125 subjects, 104 subjects came in for testing — an
83.2% return success rate. Of the 104 subjects, 13 elected not
to do the maximal treadmill test and in one subject we were
not able to obtain a blood sample. Of the 104 subjects (mean
age 63.0 ± 6.2 years; 77.9% Caucasian), 52 were men and 52
were women; this compares to 101 men and 87 women who
completed the original STRRIDE study at Duke. Over the ensuing
10 years, on average, the BMI was not changed: 29.9 kg/m2
versus 29.9 kg/m2. Table 1 contains baseline (pre-randomization)
metabolic characteristics for the original STRRIDE study data,
as well as the data for these same variables obtained from the
Reunion study. In addition, the statistical significance of the

for each variable.
Cardiorespiratory Fitness
As expected, after more than an intervening decade, there
were reductions from pre-intervention to the 10-year Reunion
in both time-to-exhaustion and peak VO2 for all groups
(Table 1 and Figures 1, 2). However, as compared to 10%
peak VO2 reductions for the controls and the moderate
intensity training group, the two vigorous intensity training
groups experienced fitness reductions that were about half
as much (∼5%; Figure 1, Panel A). The vigorous intensity
group-specific differences appeared to be due, at least in
part, to obtaining a higher peak VO2 at the end of training
(Figure 2, Panel A). In fact, the slopes of the decrease
from post training peak VO2 to the Reunion time point was
steeper for the vigorous intensity exercise groups than for the
control group (P < 0.0083). The moderate intensity group
experienced a steeper slope also, but after controlling for
multiple comparisons, the difference from the control group
was not significant (P = 0.046). If the groups are combined
into vigorous intensity and non-vigorous intensity exposures
groups, the average fitness reduction of 4.7% for the vigorously
trained was significantly different from the reduction of 9.6%
for the controls plus moderate intensity groups (P < 0.05;
data not shown).
For the subset of subjects that had complete VO2 at
anaerobic threshold data, we also combined groups into vigorous
intensity (n = 38) and non-vigorous intensity (n = 14)
exposure groups. Changes in VO2 at anaerobic threshold
mirrored the changes observed in peak VO2. The non-vigorous
intensity group displayed a significant 10-year reduction in
VO2 at anaerobic threshold from baseline to Reunion (16.9
and 15.0 mL/kg/min, respectively; P = 0.008). Conversely,
the vigorous intensity group experienced a larger increase
in VO2 at anaerobic threshold post-training and a steeper
decreasing slope during the following 10 years compared to
the non-vigorous intensity group. Overall, this resulted in an
apparent attenuation of decline in submaximal exercise capacity
for the vigorous intensity group, as baseline and Reunion
VO2 at anaerobic threshold values (17.1 and 16.5 mL/kg/min,
respectively) were not significantly different (P = 0.07). Although
not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.07), as
compared to the 11.1% reduction in VO2 at anaerobic threshold
for the non-vigorous intensity group, the vigorous intensity
group experienced a reduction in VO2 at anaerobic threshold
that was almost a fourth as much (3.0%) over the 10-year period
(Supplementary Figure S1).

Additional
analyses
showed
a
significant
correlation
(r =
−0.40; P = 0.0001) between the subjects’ reported
exercise frequency over the last 3 months (questionnaire data
taken at the Reunion time point) and the peak VO2 reduction
over the decade of follow-up (Table 2). That is, in all groups
combined, subjects reporting no exercise over the previous
3 months averaged a 12.8% decline in peak VO2 over the 10-year
follow-up period, whereas those reporting exercising three
times per week averaged a 6.1% decline. Finally, those reporting
exercising four or more times per week over the last 3 months
actually gained 5.5% in peak VO2 over the 10-year follow-up
period (data not presented). That said, recent exercise explains
only 16% of the variance (r = 0.40) in the effect on peak VO2.
Minimal Waist Circumference
As shown in Table 1, minimal waist circumference increased
only in the controls over 10 years. Both low amount training
groups had significantly different changes in waist circumference
compared to the control group over the follow-up period
(Figure 1, Panel D). Interestingly, in the initial training phase
(from pre- to post-intervention) the controls did not change
in waist circumference (Figure 2, Panel D). However, all three
exercise groups experienced decreases in waist circumference
during training. All three exercise training groups benefitted from
both a decrease in waist circumference during training and a
much slower increase in waist circumference over 10 years. As
with peak VO2, there was a significant correlation between recent
exercise frequency and minimal waist change over this period
(r = −0.27; P = 0.007; Table 2).
Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP)
Ten years after the intervention, none of the groups experienced
an increase in MAP. Perhaps this is because approximately one
third of the subjects were on blood pressure medications at the
time of the Reunion (they were not permitted at study initiation).
Of note, those in the moderate intensity group (−7.7 mmHg;
P < 0.0001) and the high amount/vigorous intensity group
(−3.4 mmHg; P < 0.05) had significantly lower blood pressures
than prior to the intervention (Table 1). Compared to the
other three groups, the moderate intensity group experienced
significantly greater reductions in MAP (Figure 1). As reported
in Table 2, there was no significant relationship between change
in MAP and recent self-reported exercise.
Fasting Insulin
The greatest reduction in fasting insulin occurred in the moderate
intensity group; this decrease was significantly greater than the
control group and the high amount/vigorous intensity group. As
already noted, the assay techniques for fasting plasma insulin
before and after the follow-up period were different. Thus, the
apparent changes over time are best understood in comparisons
among groups. With that in mind, fasting insulin decreased in

STRRIDE study; ten years later, it appears that two of the exercise
groups continued to decrease — especially with moderate
intensity exercise — and both the high amount/vigorous intensity
group and the control group appeared not to change over the
10 years. There was no significant correlation between change in
fasting insulin and recent self-reported exercise (Table 2).
Fasting Plasma Glucose and
Medications
Over the decade of follow-up, fasting glucose levels increased
substantially across all groups, which was true whether they
exercised frequently during the last three months or not, and
after controlling for medications. A total of 62 subjects had
fasting glucose concentrations in the impaired (> 100 mg/dL;
n = 52) or diabetic (> 125 mg/dL; n = 10) range. In
spite of this large and widespread increase in fasting glucose
over the follow-up period, only three subjects were taking
medications specifically for glucose control. Approximately half
of the subjects (n = 51) were taking medications that might
affect glucose levels (e.g., beta-blockers, thiazides, dedicated
glucose lowering medication). When the change in glucose over
the decade was controlled for glucose-affecting medications,
the increase in fasting glucose was 11.4 versus 15.3 mg/dL,
which was not significantly different between those two groups
(P = 0.14). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship
between change in fasting glucose and recent self-reported
exercise (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
In the STRRIDE Reunion study, we evaluated changes in
cardiometabolic health parameters 10 years after completion
of
the
original
STRRIDE
study
relative
to
assessments
taken at the time of original randomization; thus, change
scores reflect the original study-related changes plus those
persisting over the ensuing 10 years—the so-called “legacy
effect.” We observed several group-specific legacy effects

Legacy Effects of Exercise Training
from the eight-month exercise training programs.
These

value

programs
of
even
moderate
duration
for
long-term
cardiometabolic
health benefits.
Ten years after subjects finished the eight-month exercise
training study (STRRIDE), several important cardiometabolic
health measures were improved and/or maintained better
over 10 years of follow-up depending on group assignment
and participation. The strongest and most consistent findings
with respect to metabolic health variables were observed
with moderate intensity exercise. Moderate intensity exercise
resulted in persistent beneficial effects for blood pressure,
fasting insulin, and waist circumference — all strong measures
of metabolic syndrome. Blood pressure responses persisted
even after controlling for blood pressure medication use and
were similar for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood
pressure (data not shown). These legacy effects of moderate
intensity exercise on metabolic syndrome markers are in contrast
to the effects of participating in vigorous intensity exercise
of any amount. These observations are consistent with our
findings from two of our previous STRRIDE studies, where
moderate intensity exercise out-performed vigorous intensity
exercise of the same amount for glucose control and metabolic
syndrome measures (Houmard et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2007;
Slentz et al., 2016).
Cardiorespiratory Fitness
The legacy effects specific to moderate intensity training did
not extend to cardiorespiratory fitness. Conversely, while there
were no significant group differences, both the inactive control
and the moderate intensity groups experienced fitness losses
approximately twice as great as that of the vigorous intensity
groups (peak VO2Control = 12.3%; peak VO2Moderate = 10.5%;
peak VO2LowAmt/Vig = 4.8%; peak VO2HighAmt/Vig = 5.8%). When
combined into two groups (vigorous intensity exercise training
versus non-vigorous or no exercise training), the difference
between these two categories was significant; this suggests that
eight months of vigorous exercise training may lead to a higher
fitness level 10 years later. As previous research has consistently
reported loss in aerobic fitness of approximately 10% per decade
(Rogers et al., 1990; Loe et al., 2013; Kaminsky et al., 2015), our
findings suggest that eight months of vigorous training combined
with the apparent legacy effects may attenuate as much as half of
this expected loss. Furthermore, in our subgroup analyses of VO2
at anaerobic threshold, we observed an even greater maintenance
of submaximal aerobic capacity as those who completed vigorous
intensity training experienced only a 3.0% reduction in VO2 at
anaerobic threshold over the 10-year period. In order to address
whether this subset of subjects potentially had a differential fitness
response compared to those who did not have complete anaerobic
threshold data, we compared the average change in peak VO2
from baseline to Reunion and found no statistical difference.
Although the groups started with similar peak VO2 values,
the greatest improvements were seen in the vigorous intensity
training groups. Thus, one reason for the lesser decline in the
vigorous intensity groups appears to be the greater peak fitness
gain achieved during the 8-month training period (demonstrated
in Figure 2). This is similar to observations in the Look
AHEAD trial where post-intervention increases in glucose over
time appeared to be consistent among the group assignments
(parallel trajectories); the differences among groups at follow-
up appeared to be related to the initial intervention-related
improvement in glucose control with a relatively similar post-
intervention decrement over time. In addition, there was a
significant moderate correlation between change in peak VO2
and self-reported exercise frequency over the last 3 months (taken
at the Reunion timepoint).
Waist Circumference
Remarkably, when compared with controls, all three exercise
groups experienced a legacy effect for waist circumference — that
is, all three exercise groups had reduced waist circumferences.
These results reflect the fairly stable maintenance of post-
intervention waist circumference in these three exercise groups
when compared to the large increase observed in the control
group. As with peak VO2, there was a significant correlation
between reported exercise frequency over the three months just
before the Reunion visit and change in minimal waist over the
entire follow-up period. Taken together, these data suggest that
the observed legacy effect of an eight-month exercise training
period is due to both the effect of reducing waist circumference
during the STRRIDE intervention period, and the effect of
frequent exercise over the more recent timeframe (and, although
we were not able to measure this, possibly over the duration of
the 10-year follow-up period).
We previously observed that moderate intensity exercise may
have a greater metabolic benefit than vigorous exercise (Houmard
et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2007; Slentz et al., 2007, 2009,
2016). If the moderate intensity group chose moderate intensity
exercise when they resumed or continued their exercise routine
over the last 10 years, this could explain the metabolic benefits
(better blood pressure and fasting insulin levels) compared to the
vigorous groups 10 years after they finished the study. Similarly,
for the vigorous groups, if they chose more vigorous exercise
when they resumed or continued their exercise routine over the
past 10 years, this may help explain their smaller reductions in
peak VO2.
Both of these possibilities are supported by recent data
published from the Look AHEAD study (Group, 2013). Look
AHEAD was a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the
United States investigating the effects of intensive lifestyle
intervention on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among
patients with type 2 diabetes (Ryan et al., 2003). The intensive
lifestyle intervention included both group and individual sessions
that promoted a weight loss goal of at least 7% through
decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. The
control group received diabetes support and education in group-
based settings. In their article on the cardiovascular effects of
intensive lifestyle intervention in type 2 diabetes, each of the
four variables studied over 10 years — body weight, physical
fitness, waist circumference and glycated hemoglobin —robustly
improved in the lifestyle group compared to the diabetes
support and education group during the first year of the

Legacy Effects of Exercise Training
intervention (Group, 2013). While these large differences were
quickly reduced, becoming much less during the next few years,
there were still differences for each of these variables with the
lifestyle group still significantly better compared to the diabetes
support and education group at each time point of follow-
up. This suggests a benefit of a much-improved “baseline”
which persisted for several years. In another paper from the
Look AHEAD study group, at least part of this benefit was
due to greater levels of continued physical activity (Unick
et al., 2016). They observed that when measured objectively, the
intensive lifestyle group engaged in significantly more moderate-
to-vigorous physical activity than the diabetes support and
education group over a four-year period. These data suggest that
an intensive intervention can provide long-lasting effects both by
contributing to better immediate post-intervention health as well
as long-term maintenance of healthy behaviors.
There are a number of limitations to the current study.
In STRRIDE, all subjects in the control group were offered
exercise training after the control period. Those deciding to not
join an exercise group constituted the control group; thus, the
control group may be biased toward persons maintaining lifelong
inactivity. Similarly, we did not invite persons that “dropped
out” of any arm back for the Reunion study. In a future study,
to increase the generalizability of the study and allow us to
make comparisons between those who successfully completed the
exercise training and those who did not, we plan to invite back
subjects who dropped out of either the control group or any of
the exercise groups. This would allow us to evaluate whether or
not completing a significant exercise training program can have
an effect 10 years later on overall health.
Our findings indicate that a relatively modest period of
regular exercise training creates legacy effects over the ensuing
10 years; these findings are consistent with those of other
behavioral interventions. The patterns observed indicate that as
compared to those without a defined exercise training exposure,
vigorous exercise training offers benefits for maintaining aerobic
fitness; moderate intensity exercise training produces sustained
legacy effects on metabolic parameters; and any exercise training
helps maintain body weight and waist circumferences better
than continued inactivity. The importance of these findings
is hard to overestimate from both individual and global
health viewpoints. If a single, prolonged 8-month exercise
training study can lead to behavior changes that continue for
10 years — with the attendant health benefits — this would
have potentially sizeable and widespread beneficial effects. The
observed responses may not be purely behavioral; they may
also be partly mediated by some contributions from epigenetic
or other biological effects. These possibilities warrant further
study. Irrespective of the mechanisms, the observed 10-year
consequences of an 8-month aerobic exercise intervention
include better weight control, greater retained aerobic fitness for
vigorously exercise-trained individuals, and improved metabolic
profiles for moderate intensity-trained individuals. In conclusion,
as both the individual and public health implications are
substantial, conducting more studies designed to specifically test
for the possible health and/or fitness legacy effects of a single
prolonged exercise training program is imperative.
