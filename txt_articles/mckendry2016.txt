New Findings
r What is the central question of this study?
Does shorter rest between sets of resistance exercise promote a superior circulating hormonal
and acute muscle anabolic response compared with longer rest periods?
r What is the main finding and its importance?
We demonstrate that short rest (1 min) between sets of moderate-intensity, high-volume
resistance exercise blunts the acute muscle anabolic response compared with a longer rest
period (5 min), despite a superior circulating hormonal milieu. These data have important
implications for the development of training regimens to maximize muscle hypertrophy.
Manipulating the rest-recovery interval between sets of resistance exercise may influence
training-induced muscle remodelling. The aim of this study was to determine the acute muscle
anabolic response to resistance exercise performed with short or long inter-set rest intervals.
In a study with a parallel-group design, 16 males completed four sets of bilateral leg-press and
knee-extension exercise at 75% of one-repetition maximum to momentary muscular failure,
followed by ingestion of 25 g of whey protein. Resistance exercise sets were interspersed by
1 min (n = 8) or 5 min of passive rest (n = 8). Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest, 0, 4, 24
and 28 h postexercise during a primed continuous infusion of l-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine to
determine myofibrillar protein synthesis and intracellular signalling. We found that the rate of
myofibrillar protein synthesis increased above resting values from 0 to 4 h postexercise with
1 (76%; P = 0.047) and 5 min inter-set rest (152%; P < 0.001) and was significantly greater
in the 5 min inter-set rest group (P = 0.001). Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates at 24–28 h
postexercise remained elevated above resting values (P < 0.05) and were indistinguishable
between groups. Postexercise p70S6KThr389 and rpS6Ser240/244 phosphorylation were reduced
with 1 compared with 5 min inter-set rest, whereas phosphorylation of eEF2Thr56, TSC2Thr1462,
AMPKThr172 and REDD1 protein were greater for 1 compared with 5 min inter-set rest. Serum
testosterone was greater at 20–40 min postexercise and plasma lactate greater immediately
postexercise for 1 versus 5 min inter-set rest. Resistance exercise with short (1 min) inter-set rest

Introduction
Contractile loading is a potent stimulus for muscle
hypertrophy. It is well established that resistance exercise
stimulates myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and that
protein/amino acid provision potentiates this response
(Moore et al. 2009). Thus, muscle hypertrophy occurs as a
result of cumulative increases in MPS with each successive
bout of resistance training (Phillips, 2000; Brook et al.
2015). Much attention has been given to understanding
how resistance exercise parameters can be modified to
augment the muscle anabolic response. Previously, it
has been demonstrated that manipulation of resistance
exercise load, intensity and work volume can profoundly
influence MPS and hypertrophy (Burd et al. 2010a,b;
Mitchell et al. 2012).
The mechanisms through which contractile stimuli
induce muscle anabolism are complex and poorly defined.
A pervasive view is that acute postexercise responses of
testosterone (T) and growth hormone (GH) are critical for
muscle anabolism (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005). Indeed,
resistance exercise protocols that are high in volume (the
product of load x repetitions x sets) activate a large muscle
mass and are of sufficient intensity to elicit a high degree
of effort, transiently elevate circulating concentrations of
T and GH (Goto et al. 2003; Smilios et al. 2003; McCaulley
et al. 2009) which, it is assumed, may influence or predict
resistance training-induced hypertrophy (Rønnestad et al.
2011).However,othershaveshownthattransientincreases
in the hormonal milieu following resistance exercise are
not related to MPS or muscle hypertrophy in healthy
young individuals (Wilkinson et al. 2006; West et al.
2009, 2010b; West & Phillips, 2012; Mitchell et al. 2013).
Alternatively,itissuggestedthatintracellularmechanisms,
activated through a contractile stimulus of sufficient size
to achieve maximal motor unit recruitment, may dictate
the MPS response irrespective of circulating hormonal
changes (West et al. 2010a; Burd et al. 2010b; Mitchell et al.
2012).
Manipulationoftherestintervalbetweensuccessivesets
of resistance exercise is thought to be important for muscle
hypertrophy (de Salles et al. 2009). This position has been
established through studies demonstrating that resistance
exercise performed with a short inter-set rest interval
(�1 min) elicits a greater transient rise in circulating
GH and T compared with long-duration inter-set rest
(�3 min; Kraemer et al. 1990; Goto et al. 2004; Bottaro
et al. 2009; Rahimi et al. 2010). However, given the
equivocal nature of exercise-induced systemic hormonal
alterations on muscle anabolism, the notion that a
short inter-set rest duration provides a superior stimulus
for muscle hypertrophy is questionable. Furthermore,
insufficient rest between resistance exercise sets induces
metabolic perturbations (lactate and H+ accumulation
and lowered pH) and facilitates the onset of neural
fatigue, which may compromise the ability to sustain
repeated high-force contraction and potentially impair
muscle anabolic processes (Kleger et al. 2001; Willardson
& Burkett, 2005). Uncertainty over the superiority of
short versus long inter-set rest for muscle hypertrophy
is reflected in the conflicting findings of chronic resistance
training studies, with some demonstrating an advantage
of short inter-set rest duration for muscle hypertrophy
(Villanueva et al. 2015), whereas others report an
advantage of long inter-set rest (Buresh et al. 2009;
Schoenfeld et al. 2015) or no clear difference (Ahtiainen
et al. 2005; de Souza et al. 2010).
To provide a clearer insight into the precise mecha-
nisms
through
which
rest-recovery
may
facilitate
resistance exercise-induced muscle remodelling, we in-
vestigated the MPS and intracellular signalling response
to moderate-intensity, high-volume resistance exercise
performed with a short (1 min) or long (5 min) inter-set
rest in healthy young males. We hypothesized that the MPS
andintracellularsignallingresponsetomoderate-intensity
high-volume resistance exercise performed to momentary
muscular fatigue would be equivalent between short and
long inter-set rest, irrespective of any potential difference
in the circulating endocrine response between conditions.
Given evidence that MPS over 0–6 h of recovery from
resistance exercise is not correlated with the magnitude of
muscle hypertrophy following chronic resistance training
(Mitchell et al. 2014) and that MPS rates remain elevated
above basal levels for 24–48 h postexercise (Phillips et al.
1997; Burd et al. 2011a), we chose to assess MPS and
intracellular signalling during the ‘early’ (0–4 h) and ‘late’
(24–28 h) postexercise recovery phase to provide a closer
indication of the capacity for muscle remodelling.

Methods
Participants
Sixteen young males were recruited through local
advertisement.
Participants
habitually
performed
lower-limb resistance training at least once per week
for �1 year prior to study enrolment and were deemed
‘recreationally
trained’.
Participant
anthropometric,
strength and training characteristics are detailed in
Table 1. Participants were informed of the purpose
and methodology of the study, were deemed healthy
by assessment of a general health questionnaire, and
provided their written consent. Ethical approval was
obtained through the National Health Service Black
Country Research Ethics Committee (13/WM/0455). The
study conformed to the standards set forward by the
Declaration of Helsinki (seventh version).
Experimental design
Following
initial
eligibility
screening,
participants
reported
to
the
School
of
Sport,
Exercise
and
Rehabilitation Sciences (SportExR) laboratory on three
separate occasions. During the initial visit, participants
underwent preliminary assessment of body composition
and maximal leg strength. Approximately 1 week after
preliminary assessments, participants completed two
experimental trials on consecutive days (referred to
hereafter as experimental trials 1 and 2). Experimental
trials consisted of a stable isotope amino-acid infusion,
combined with serial muscle biopsy sampling, to
determine MPS over the ‘early’ (0–4 h in experimental
trial 1) and ‘late’ (24–28 h in experimental trial 2) phase
of recovery following a bout of bilateral leg resistance
exercise. The study had a parallel design (because of the
number of biopsies required), with participants matched
in pairs based on anthropometric, strength and training
characteristics before being randomized to either 1 min
(1M; n = 8) or 5 min (5M; n = 8) rest-recovery between
successive exercise sets. Participant matching was used to
increase homogeneity between groups.
Preliminary assessments
Body mass and height. Body mass was determined by
weighing each participant in loose clothing, without
shoes, to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital balance scale.
Measurement of body mass was repeated upon arrival
at each visit to ensure that participants maintained a
constant weight throughout the duration of the study.
Height measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 cm.
Body composition. Following assessment of body mass
and height, participants underwent a Dual X-ray
Absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Discovery DXA Systems,
Hologic
Inc.,
Bedford,
MA,
USA)
to
determine
whole-body and regional fat and fat-free mass. The DXA
scans were performed in a �10 h fasted state and lasted
7 min in total. Briefly, participants lay supine on the
scanner in light clothing with their feet placed shoulder
width apart and held in pace by tape to avoid discomfort.
A trained operative analysed all images.
Leg strength. Maximal leg strength was obtained using a
standardized,progressiveonerepetitionmaximum(1RM)
protocol adapted from Mayhew et al. (1992) in order to
determine the appropriate load of 75% 1RM for the acute
exercise protocol in experimental trial 1. Leg 1RM strength
was determined on leg-press and knee-extension exercise
machines (Cybex VR-3, Medway, MA, USA). The 1RM
protocol consisted of a self-selected warm-up, followed

by a 4–5RM set, a 3–4RM set, a 2–3RM set, and finally, a
1RMattempt.Warm-up and lead-in sets wereseparatedby
3 min. Exercise intensity was monitored throughout using
a modified Borg category-ratio scale (CR-10; Day et al.
2004; Buckley & Borg, 2011). The load for the warm-up
and initial 4–5RM set was subjectively chosen based on
previous training history. Participants were instructed to
lift until momentary muscular failure on the final 1RM
attempt only. In the event a 1RM attempt was failed, 5 min
of passive rest was taken and the load was progressively
lowered by 5 kg until 1RM was achieved. Exercise machine
positions were recorded for use during experimental trials
1 and 2.
Dietary control. On the day prior to experimental
trial 1, participants consumed a standardized evening
meal (917 kcal) composed of �18% protein (�32 g),
�60% carbohydrate (�103 g) and �22% fat (�39 g).
Following experimental trial 1, prior to reporting to the
laboratory the following morning for experimental trial
2, participants consumed a standardized lunch (778 kcal)
composed of �22% protein (�34 g), �58% carbohydrate
(�88 g) and �20% fat (�32 g), in addition to an evening
meal of the same composition consumed on the evening of
experimental trial 1 (described above). Participants were
asked to consume their evening meal between 19.00 and
21.00 h to ensure a 10–12 h fast prior to each experimental
trial. All standardized meals were provided to participants
by the research team. Participants were asked to refrain
from alcohol and caffeine for 24 h prior to experimental
trial 1 until completion of experimental trial 2.
Experimental trials 1 and 2
ParticipantsreportedtotheSportExRlaboratoryat07.00h
having fasted for �10–12 h. Upon arrival, body mass
was recorded (described above) and a 21-gauge cannula
was inserted into a forearm vein of each arm. One
cannula was used for frequent arterialized blood sampling,
whereas the other was used to infuse the stable isotope
tracer. After obtaining a rested-fasted blood sample,
participants received a primed continuous infusion
of
L-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine (prime, 2 μmol kg−1;
infusion, 0.05 μmol kg−1 min−1; Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories,Andover,MA,USA)todetermineMPSrates.
The contralateral arm was warmed in a heated blanket
for frequent arterialized blood sampling (Abumarad et al.
1981) at −210, −180, −120 and −60 min prior to
exercise and 0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min
postexercise. A total of 10 ml of arterialized blood was
collected at each sampling time point in EDTA and
serum-separator vacutainers (BD, Oxford, UK). Blood
samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 10 min at 4°C,
and serum and plasma aliquots were frozen at −80°C for
later analysis. After �150 min of stable isotope infusion, a
muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the quadriceps
vastus lateralis under local anaesthesia (1% lidocaine)
using the Bergstr¨
om needle technique (Bergstrom, 1975).
Muscle biopsy tissue was quickly rinsed in ice-cold saline
and blotted to remove any visible fat and connective
tissue before being frozen in liquid nitrogen at stored at
−80°C for later analysis. Immediately after the first biopsy,
participants completed a bout of bilateral leg resistance
exercise, comprising four sets of leg-press and four sets
of knee-extension exercise at 75% of 1RM. Participants
performed exercise with a lifting–lowering cadence of �1 s
in both concentric and eccentric phases, without pause,
until momentary muscular failure (i.e. fatigue or level
9–10 on the Borg CR-10 scale). Attempts were made to
clamp the exercise load at 75% of 1RM across all exercise
sets, with the expectation that the number of repetitions
achieved at the point of fatigue would decrease across
sets. In exceptional circumstances when participants
completed more or fewer than 8–14 repetitions per set,
exercise load was adjusted by ±5 kg. Depending on
which condition participants were allocated, resistance
exercise sets were interspersed with 1 or 5 min of passive
rest-recovery, during which participants remained seated
on the machine. Following completion of each exercise set,
time under tension and Borg CR-10 level were recorded.
Immediately after completion of exercise, a second muscle
biopsy was obtained �3 cm proximal from the first biopsy,
followed by the consumption of 25 g of whey protein
isolate (MyProtein, Northwich, UK) dissolved in 400 ml
of water. This amount of protein has been established to
stimulate rates of MPS maximally after resistance exercise
in young men (Witard et al. 2014). The amino acid content
of the whey protein isolate was (as percentage content):
Ala, 4.6; Arg, 2.1; Asp, 9.7; Cys, 2.6; Gln, 17.1; Gly, 1.6;
His, 1.5; Ile, 5.6; Leu, 9.7; Lys, 9.7; Met, 2.0; Phe, 2.9; Pro,
5.5; Ser, 3.7; Thr, 6.1; Trp, 1.6; Tyr, 2.7; and Val, 4.6. A small
amount of L-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine tracer (30 mg)
was added to the drink (enriched to 4%) to minimize
changes in blood phenylalanine enrichment after drink
ingestion. Following whey protein ingestion, participants
rested supine for 240 min, after which a third muscle
biopsy was obtained �3 cm proximal to the second biopsy
to determine MPS rates over the ‘early’ phase (0–4 h)
of postexercise recovery. Before leaving the laboratory,
participants were provided with a standardized lunch and
eveningmeal(describedabove)andinstructedtoconsume
only the food provided throughout the remainder of the
day.
The following morning, participants reported to the
SportExR laboratory at 07.00 h for experimental trial
2, having fasted for �10 h. Cannulas were inserted
into both forearm veins for frequent arterialized blood
sampling and an identical stable isotope infusion to that
described in experimental trial 1. After �90 min of stable

enrichment
and
concentrations.
Plasma [13C6]phenylalanine enrichment was determined
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS;
model 5973; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
by monitoring ions 234/240. Upon thawing, plasma
samples
were
combined
with
diluted
acetic
acid
and purified on cation-exchange columns (Dowex
50W-X8-200; Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The amino
acids were then converted to their N-tert-butyldimethyl-
silyl-N-methyltrifluoracetamide (MTBSTFA) derivative.
Simultaneously, concentrations of leucine were deter-
mined by GCMS using an internal standard method
(Tipton et al. 1999; Breen et al. 2011), based on the known
volume of plasma and internal standard added and the
known amino acid concentration of the internal standard.
The internal standard was U-[13C6]leucine (ions 302/308)
added in a ratio of 100 μl ml−1 of blood.
Plasma
lactate. Plasma
lactate
concentrations
were
determined
using
BIOSEN
C line
Clinic/GP+
Glucose/Lactate Measuring System (EKF Diagnostics,
Cardiff, UK). Briefly, 20 μl of plasma was added to a
micro test tube provided with the analytical kit and
prefilled with a haemolysing solution to dilute the sample
to 1:51.
Hormone concentrations. Serum GH, insulin and sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were
measured using commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (GH and insulin: IBL
International, Hamburg, Germany; SHBG: BioVendor,
Karasek, Czech Republic) following the manufacturers’
instructions.
Serum
testosterone
was
measured
by
liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) using a Waters Xevo mass spectrometer with
Acquity uPLC as described previously (Hassan-Smith et al.
2015; Oostdijk et al. 2015). An electrospray ionization
source was used in positive ionization mode. Steroids
were extracted from 400 μl of serum via liquid–liquid
extraction using 2 ml of tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE).

The MTBE was subsequently evaporated to dryness, and
samples were reconstituted in 125 μl of methanol/water
(50/50) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. An optimized LC
method using methanol and water both with 0.1% formic
acid was used to separate steroids on a T3, 1.8 μm,
1.2 mm × 50 mm column. Steroids were identified and
quantified based on matching retention times and two
mass transitions when compared to authentic reference
standards (testosterone 289 > 97 and 289 > 109). Steroids
were quantified, after addition of appropriate internal
standards, relative to a calibration series ranging from
0.25 to 50 ng ml−1. Free testosterone was calculated from
total T and SHBG concentrations as described previously
(Ly & Handelsman, 2005).
Muscle tissue analyses
Myofibrillar
and
muscle-free
amino
acid
extraction.
From�40–50mgofmuscletissue,themyofibrillarprotein
fraction and muscle free pool were extracted for analysis
of [13C6]phenylalanine enrichment. Muscle tissue was
powderedandtransferredtoaneppendorftubecontaining
500 μl of 0.6 M percholoric acid. Muscle tissue was
homogenized under liquid nitrogen using small scissors
and a Teflon pestle, and centrifuged at 2000 g at 4°C
for 5 min. The supernatant containing the intracellular
free pool of amino acids was transferred to a 2 ml
eppendorf container. A 500 μl volume of doubly distilled
water was added to the pellet, which was vortexed and
spun at 2000 g at 4°C for 5 min. The sample was then
further homogenized with small scissors and a Teflon
pestle. A 7.5 μl mg−1 volume of homogenization buffer
(50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M M EGTA, 10 mM
β-glycerophosphate and 50 mM sodium fluoride, pH 7.5)
was added to the sample and centrifuged at 2000 g at
4°C for 10 min, before the supernatant was discarded.
The pellet was washed with 500 μl of doubly distilled
water, and the myofibrillar fraction separated from any
collagen by adding 1 ml of 0.3 M NaOH and heating
for 30 min at 50°C (vortexing every 10 min). The
sample was then centrifuged at 9500 g at 4°C for 5 min,
and the supernatant was transferred to a 4 ml glass
collection tube. Myofibrillar proteins were precipitated by
adding 1 ml of 1 M percholoric acid to the supernatant,
which was centrifuged at 1500 g at 4°C for 10 min.
The pellet was then washed with 1 ml of 70% EtOH.
The remaining myofibrillar protein pellet was hydrolysed
overnight in 2 ml of 1 M HCl and 1 ml of activated
Dowex 50W-X8 100–200 resin (Bio-Rad laboratories
Inc., Hercules, California, USA). Constituent amino acids
in the myofibrillar fraction and intracellular free pool
were purified on cation-exchange columns (Bio-Rad
laboratories Inc., USA). Amino acids in the myofibrillar
fraction were then converted to their N-acetyl-n-propyl
ester
derivative,
and
phenylalanine
labelling
was
determined by gas chromatography–combustion–isotope
ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS; Delta-plus XP;
Thermofinnigan, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Ions 44/45
were monitored for unlabelled and labelled CO2,
respectively. Amino acids in the intracellular free pool
were converted to their MTBSTFA derivative, and
[13C6]phenylalanine enrichment was determined by
monitoring at ions 234/240 using GCMS (as described
in ‘Blood analyses’).
Western blot. Approximately 25–30 mg of muscle tissue
was powdered on dry ice using a CellcrusherTM tissue
pulverizer (Cellcrusher Ltd, Cork, Ireland) and prepared
for Western blot analysis as described previously (Philp
et al. 2015). Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were
boiled for 5 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and
separatedon7.5–10%gelsbySDS-PAGEfor1h.Following
electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a Protran
nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany)

UK]. In addition, membranes were incubated with
regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1
(REDD1) rabbit polyclonal (#10638-1-AP) antibody from
Proteintech Ltd (Manchester, UK). Immobilon Western
chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Merck Millipore,
Watford, UK) was used to quantify protein content
following IgG binding, visualized on a G:BOX Chemi
XT4 imager using GeneSys capture software (Syngene UK,
Cambridge, UK). Imaging and band quantification were
carried out using a Chemi Genius Bioimaging Gel Doc
System (Syngene).
Calculations
The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the
trapezium method. Serum hormone concentrations at 0,
20, 40, 60 and 90 min postexercise were used to determine
the AUC.
The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of the myofibrillar
protein fraction was calculated from the incorporation

Training rest interval for muscle anabolism
of [13C6]phenylalanine into protein using the standard
precursor–product model as follows:
FSR(%h−1) = �E b/E p × 1/t × 100
(1)
Where �Eb is the change in bound [13C6]phenylalanine
enrichment between two biopsy samples, Ep is the pre-
cursor enrichment and t is the time between muscle bio-
psies. We used the mean plasma [13C6]phenylalanine
enrichment
from
arterialized
blood
to
determine
an ‘estimated’ intracellular precursor enrichment as
described previously (Breen et al. 2011). For the
calculation of resting-fasted MPS rates, the recruitment
of tracer-‘naive’ participants allowed for the use of
pre-infusion plasma [13C6]phenylalanine enrichment as
a proxy for basal muscle protein enrichment, an approach
that has been validated previously (Burd et al. 2011b).
Statistics
Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 for
Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Anthropometric
and training characteristics were analysed using Student’s
unpaired t test. Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates
and Western blot data were analysed using a two-way,
mixed-model ANOVA with one within (two levels;
‘early’ and ‘late’ recovery) and one between factor (two
levels; condition). Exercise and blood parameters were
analysed using a two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA
(time × condition). Additionally, plasma enrichments
were analysed using linear regression. Tukey’s HSD post
hoc analysis was performed whenever a significant F ratio
was found to isolate specific differences. Significance for
all analyses was set at P < 0.05. All values are presented as
means ± SEM.
Results
Exercise variables
Anthropometric, strength and training characteristics
were similar between 1M and 5M (Table 1). Load-volume
(load x repetitions) during leg press exercise decreased
significantly during sets 3 and 4 compared with set 1 in
1M (−28 and −33%, respectively; P < 0.05), but did not
decrease across sets in 5M (Table 2). Load-volume during
sets 3 and 4 of leg press exercise were significantly lower in
1M compared with 5M (P = 0.001). Total volume for leg
press exercise was �13% lower in 1M compared with 5M
(P = 0.03; Table 2). Knee-extension load-volume was not
significantly different between groups in each set and did
not significantly diminish as sets progressed. However,
when taken together the total volume achieved over all
four sets of knee-extension exercise was �17% lower in
1M compared with 5M (P = 0.03; Table 2). The rating

Plasma leucine and serum insulin
In experimental trial 1, plasma leucine concentration
increased above fasted values 40 min after ingestion
of 25 g of whey protein in 1M and 5M (P < 0.001
for both; Fig. 2A). Plasma leucine concentration peaked
60 min after protein ingestion (�2.2- and 2-fold above
fasted values for 1M and 5M, respectively) and returned
to fasted values 120 min after protein ingestion for
1M and 5M. In experimental trial 2, plasma leucine
concentration displayed a similar temporal response to
that in experimental trial 1, increasing above fasted values
at 40 min after drink ingestion for 1M and 5M (P < 0.001
for both; Fig. 2B) and returning to fasted values at 120 min
after drink ingestion. Plasma leucine concentration did
not differ between 1M and 5M at any time point during
experimental trial 1 or 2.
In experimental trial 1, serum insulin concentration
increased above fasting values, peaking 40 min after
ingestion of 25 g of whey protein in 1M and 5M (�2.8-
and 3.1-fold, respectively, P < 0.001 for both; Fig. 2C)
and returning to fasted values thereafter. In experimental
trial 2, serum insulin concentration demonstrated the
same temporal pattern of response as in experimental
trial 1, increasing above fasted values at 40 min after
protein ingestion for 1M and 5M (�3.6- and 2.6-fold,
respectively, P < 0.001 for both; Fig. 2D) and returning to
fasted values thereafter. Plasma insulin concentration did
not differ between 1M and 5M at any time point during
experimental trial 1 or 2.
Plasma [13C6]phenylalanine enrichment
In experimental trial 1, plasma [13C6]phenylalanine

Discussion
It is generally well accepted that manipulation of
resistance exercise training parameters can influence
skeletal muscle remodelling. This is the first study
to investigate the acute mechanisms through which
resistance exercise inter-set rest duration influences MPS
and intracellular signalling. The findings of the present
study demonstrate that a short inter-set rest duration
(1 min; 1M) during moderate-intensity, high-volume
fatigue-inducing resistance exercise blunts MPS rates and
intracellular signalling in recreationally trained young
men over the ‘early’ postexercise recovery period (0–4 h),
compared with long inter-set rest duration (5 min;
5M). Paradoxically, the blunting of MPS rates and
intracellular signalling in the early postexercise recovery
period for 1M occurred in parallel with a greater
systemic testosterone response compared with 5M. Thus,
inter-set rest duration between sets of resistance exercise
can profoundly influence acute muscle intracellular
signalling and systemic hormonal parameters, with
potential implications for resistance training-induced
muscle remodelling.
In
contrast
to
our
initial
hypothesis
that
the
MPS
response
to
moderate-intensity,
high-volume
fatigue-inducing resistance exercise would be similar
between 1M and 5M, we demonstrated that the increase in
MPS during the early phase of postexercise recovery was
attenuated in 1M compared with 5M (76 versus 152%
increase above rested-fasted MPS values, respectively).
The physiological significance of the acute impairment
in MPS in the early postexercise recovery period in 1M
was unexpected and, although difficult to interpret, is
somewhat contradictory to the belief that a short inter-set
rest interval (1–2 min) may provide a superior stimulus
for resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy over
longer rest intervals (>3 min; American College of
Sports Medicine, 2009). Although we did not presently
assess muscle hypertrophy in response to long-term
training with divergent inter-set rest intervals, others have
previously done so. In line with our acute mechanistic
findings, resistance training-induced changes in regional
muscle thickness and cross-sectional area were greater
with longer (2.5–3 min) compared with shorter (1 min)
inter-set rest (Buresh et al. 2009; Schoenfeld et al. 2015). In
contrast, others report no difference in the magnitude of
muscle hypertrophy between resistance training protocols
employing short or long rest periods (Ahtiainen et al.
2005; de Souza et al. 2010), which may be attributable to
the short rest interval exceeding 1 min, thereby avoiding
any metabolic perturbations that might blunt adaptive
responses. Taken together, the findings of the present
study and the paucity of chronic resistance training studies
demonstrate that insufficient rest between resistance
exercisesetsispotentiallydetrimental,oratleastequivocal,
for muscle hypertrophy.
The position that resistance exercise inter-set rest
duration
is
an
important
determinant
of
muscle
hypertrophy is rooted in the premise that short inter-set
rest results in greater circulating concentrations of GH
and/or T (Kraemer et al. 1990; Goto et al. 2004;
Bottaro et al. 2009; Rahimi et al. 2010), thought to
be important in the stimulation of MPS (American
College of Sports Medicine, 2009; de Salles et al. 2009).
The present findings demonstrated that high-volume,
moderate-intensity resistance exercise resulted in a similar
elevation in circulating GH in 1M and 5M. Irrespective
of inter-set rest interval, all participants exercised the
same large area of muscle mass to momentary muscular
fatigue to achieve a high total training volume, which
we posit may have been sufficient to reach an acute
‘ceiling’ GH response as previously demonstrated (Smilios
et al. 2003). Important to note is that our data do
not account for the various aggregate and splice variant

isoforms of GH that are reported to be >100 in number
(Kraemer et al. 2010). Likewise, we chose not measure
GH-mediated intramuscular signalling in the Janus
kinase/signal transducers and activator of transcription
(STAT) pathway, because these proteins are unresponsive
to resistance exercise-induced elevations in GH (West et al.
2010b). Interestingly, the resistance exercise-induced T
response was greater for 1M compared with 5M. In line
with these data, Buresh et al. (2009) reported superior
resistance training-induced hypertrophy with 2.5 min of
inter-set rest, despite a lower T response compared with a
1 min rest condition. Thus, our data add to a growing
body of evidence demonstrating that exercise-induced
circulating GH and T concentrations are not related to
MPS (West et al. 2009; West & Phillips, 2012; Mitchell et al.
2013). It is possible that alternative biological functions
exist for resistance exercise-induced hormonal increases,
including connective tissue remodelling (Doessing et al.
2010; West et al. 2015). Furthermore, it is important
to consider that circulating concentrations of T may
be poorly related to intramuscular T concentrations.
Exercise-inducedintramuscularTorT–androgenreceptor
complex formation may play an important regulatory role
in MPS and hypertrophy (Bamman et al. 2001; Mitchell
et al. 2013) and warrants further investigation.
Given recent evidence that acute resistance exercise-
induced MPS rates do not predict chronic training-
induced muscle hypertrophy (Mitchell et al. 2014),
the suggestion that the blunted MPS and intracellular
signallingresponseintheearlyrecoveryperiodfor1Mmay
be indicative of impaired long-term muscle hypertrophy
is tenuous. However, exercise-induced elevations in MPS
persist for 24–72 h postexercise (Phillips et al. 1997;
Miller et al. 2005; Burd et al. 2011a), which may explain
the discord between acute assessment of MPS over
several hours postexercise and long-term hypertrophy.
To gain a clearer understanding of the potential for
resistance exercise inter-set rest duration to influence
muscle remodelling, within the context of our acute
mechanistic investigation, we re-assessed MPS in the ‘late’
24–28 h postexercise recovery period and found that
fed-state MPS rates were elevated to a similar extent in 1M
and 5M. Methodological issues associated with prolonged
intravenous stable isotope tracer infusions meant that
we were unable to investigate MPS continuously over
the entire 0–28 h postexercise recovery period. Thus,
we cannot rule out the possibility that MPS in 1M was
delayed beyond the 0–4 h early postexercise recovery
period, potentially ‘rebounding’ at a later time point prior
to MPS reassessment at 24–28 h postexercise. Nonetheless,
our observation that MPS was blunted in the early
postexercise recovery period in 1M offers a new insight
into the acute metabolic implications of insufficient
inter-set rest.
The mechanisms underpinning the blunted MPS
response in the early postexercise recovery period for 1M
are undoubtedly complex and not easy to reconcile. As
expected, 1M elicited a greater rate of fatigue than 5M, as
evidenced by a higher postexercise plasma lactate response
and a marginally lower exercise volume (Richmond &
Godard, 2004; Willardson & Burkett, 2005). Previously,
others have demonstrated that the volume of resistance
exercise affects the acute muscle anabolic response, with
three sets increasing MPS to a greater extent than a
single set (Burd et al. 2010a). However, although multiple
sets of resistance training elicit greater rates of MPS
and hypertrophy compared with a single set, there is
a plateau (and potentially a decline) in hypertrophic
adaptations beyond certain resistance training volumes
(Krieger, 2010). Thus, we ensured that the training volume
load completed in 1M would, in theory, be sufficient
to exceed the threshold required for maximal MPS
stimulation. As such, it is unlikely that the 16% lower
exercise volume achieved in 1M can fully explain the
76% lower MPS and attenuated intracellular signalling
response compared with 5M. Furthermore, the �1.6-fold
increase in MPS above resting values from 0 to 4 h
postexercise in 1M is notably lower than previously
reported in response to resistance exercise protocols of
much lower volume (Kumar et al. 2009; Burd et al. 2010a).
This comparison further supports the position that
the metabolic perturbations associated with insufficient
inter-set rest in 1M may have been primarily responsible
for the blunting of MPS and intracellular signalling, with
the marginal reduction in exercise volume playing a lesser
role. Thus, although we are unable to determine the
extent to which the marginal reduction in training volume
contributed to the inferior muscle anabolic response in
1M, we feel that additional contractions in 1M to match
the exercise volume achieved in 5M (which would have
required approximately eight more repetitions) would
not have completely reversed the blunted MPS and
intracellular signalling response in the early postexercise
recovery period.
The present data support the position that resistance
exercise-induced MPS and hypertrophy are initiated
through intramuscular mechanisms activated through
contraction-induced calcium influx and mechanical
stress/tension, rather than transient systemic hormonal
events (West et al. 2010a; Mitchell et al. 2013). The blunted
MPS response in the early postexercise recovery period
in 1M occurred in parallel with blunted intracellular
signalling of targets associated with the mTORC1
pathway, critical for resistance exercise (Drummond
et al. 2009) and nutrient-induced MPS stimulation
(Dickinson et al. 2011). Specifically, rPS6Ser240/244 and
p70S6KThr389 phosphorylation at 4 h postexercise was
bluntedin1Mcomparedwith5M.Furthermore,eEF2Thr56

phosphorylation was greater in 1M than 5M immediately
postexercise, previously reported to be associated with
impairments in ribosome translocation on mRNA,
peptide chain elongation and MPS (Carlberg et al. 1990).
Induction of REDD1 has been closely linked to reduced
activity in the mTORC1 pathway (Kimball et al. 2008;
Murakami et al. 2011) and has been linked to adverse
physiological conditions, including ATP depletion (Sofer
et al. 2005) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Protiva
et al. 2008). In human skeletal muscle, REDD1 mRNA
expression is repressed following resistance exercise in
association with mTORC1 activation (Drummond et al.
2008). Herein, we demonstrate that REDD1 protein was
greater in 1M compared with 5M at 4 h postexercise,
which may partly explain the impaired MPS response
over this period. Finally, Akt phosphorylation was greater
in 5M immediately and 4 h postexercise compared
with 1M. Akt phosphorylates PRAS40, which results in
its dissociation from mTORC1, thereby relieving the
inhibitory effect (Sancak et al. 2007) although, in our
hands, PRAS40 phosphorylation was not different over
time or between groups. Another mTORC1 inhibitor,
TSC2, can be activated by AMPK in response to cellular
energy deprivation (Inoki et al. 2003) or repressed by
Akt (Manning et al. 2002). Although AMPK and TSC2
phosphorylation were not different between 1M and
5M in the early recovery phase, a greater response was
apparent in the late recovery phase. These surprising
findings, alongside a greater 4E-BP1 response for 1M at
24–28 h postexercise, are difficult to explain, because late
recovery MPS was equivalent between groups. However, a
lack of congruence between the intramuscular signalling
phosphorylation and MPS in relatively small cohorts
has been well documented (Greenhaff et al. 2008).
Thus, regardless of any discord in the temporal time
course of intramuscular signalling and MPS, the multiple
attenuationsinanabolicsignallingin1Mcouldcollectively
explain the blunted MPS response in the early postexercise
recovery period.
The practical implications of our acute mechanistic
investigation warrant discussion. Short inter-set rest
(�90 s) is typically implemented during high-volume,
moderate-intensity resistance training to emphasize
muscle hypertrophy, whereas longer rest (�3 min) is
typically implemented in lower volume heavier intensity
resistance training to emphasize strength enhancement.
Herein, we chose to match the relative intensity and
number of exercise sets between 1M and 5M which,
although not entirely reflective of ‘real-world’ practice,
was necessary to study the isolated effects of divergent
inter-set rest conditions. Incongruent with our acute
demonstration of a blunting of MPS and intracellular
signalling in 1M are data demonstrating that substantial
muscle hypertrophy can be achieved over the course of
chronic resistance training in conditions of brief inter-set
rest(Mitchelletal.2013).Onepossibleexplanationforthis
inconsistency may be that moderate-intensity resistance
exercise with short inter-set rest elicited unfamiliar
muscular energetic demands in our recreationally trained
participants,whoweretypicallyusedtorestingfor2–3min
between exercise sets. Thus, given evidence that the
acute exercise-induced MPS response is modified during
long-term resistance training (Tang et al. 2008), it is
possible that the blunted MPS and intracellular signalling
response we observed in the early phase of postexercise
recovery in 1M may be abated when individuals routinely
undertake resistance exercise with short inter-set rest and
adapt to the specific metabolic and neural demands of
this contractile stimulus. Therefore, we speculate that
the present findings have implications for individuals
pursuing specific volume goals for hypertrophy that may
need longer rest intervals initially, but may later adapt to
shorter rest intervals. In line with this point, de Souza and
colleagues (2010) reported similar muscle hypertrophy
between individuals who rested for 2 min between sets
and those whose inter-set rest gradually declined from
2 min to 30 s over 8 weeks of training.
In
conclusion,
we
have
demonstrated
that
sets
of moderate-intensity, high-volume fatiguing resistance
exerciseinterspersedbyverybrief1minrestintervalsresult
in a blunted MPS and intracellular signalling response
in the early postexercise recovery period compared with
exercise sets interspersed by 5 min of rest in recreationally
trained young men. Combined with evidence from
chronic resistance training studies, the blunted MPS
response in early recovery with short inter-set rest
refutes the position that short rest intervals between
successive sets of resistance exercise provide a superior
stimulus for muscle hypertrophy. However, the blunted
MPS response with short inter-set rest may be an acute
adaptive response to the metabolic perturbations induced
by a novel energetically demanding contractile stimulus.
In summary, these findings shed light on the acute
muscle anabolic response to resistance exercise performed
with divergent inter-set rest conditions, with potentially
important implications for those seeking to maximize
muscle hypertrophy through resistance training. However,
there is a clear need for further, rigorously controlled
studiestoreconcilethelong-terminfluenceofinter-setrest
duration on the muscle adaptive response to prolonged
resistance exercise training, particularly in well-trained
individuals.
