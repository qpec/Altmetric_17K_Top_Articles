Abstract
Elevated basal serum tryptase levels are present in 4–6% of the general population, but the cause 
and relevance of such increases are unknown1, 2. Previously, we described subjects with 
dominantly inherited elevated basal serum tryptase levels associated with multisystem complaints 
including cutaneous flushing and pruritus, dysautonomia, functional gastrointestinal symptoms, 
chronic pain, and connective tissue abnormalities, including joint hypermobility. Here we report 
the identification of germline duplications and triplications in the TPSAB1 gene encoding α-
tryptase that segregate with inherited increases in basal serum tryptase levels in 35 families 
presenting with associated multisystem complaints. Individuals harboring alleles encoding three 
copies of α-tryptase had higher basal serum levels of tryptase and were more symptomatic than 
those with alleles encoding two copies, suggesting a gene-dose effect. Further, we found in two 
additional cohorts (172 individuals) that elevated basal serum tryptase levels were exclusively 
associated with duplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1, and affected individuals 
reported symptom complexes seen in our initial familial cohort. Thus, our findings link 
duplications in TPSAB1 with irritable bowel syndrome, cutaneous complaints, connective tissue 
abnormalities, and dysautonomia.
Medically unexplained symptoms and symptom complexes can be vexing for clinicians and 
patients alike. Manifestations such as cutaneous flushing, certain chronic pain disorders, 
autonomic dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysmotility have been attributed to a number of 
disparate etiologies, including neurological, immunological, physical, and psychological 
mechanisms3–6. Despite a lack of diagnostic clinical findings, many of these symptoms are 
comorbid and often follow a dominant inheritance pattern in affected families7–10. 
Furthermore, many of these features have been reported in association with genetic disorders

 or joint hypermobility syndromes such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type III (hypermobility 
type, EDS III). For these reasons, identifying genetic bases to characterize subgroups of 
individuals with these disorders may substantially advance the field; however, employing 
classical phenotypic ascertainment approaches in these individuals is extremely challenging.
Recently, we and others described family cohorts with symptom complexes conforming to 
these functional presentations but found them in association uniquely with elevated basal 
serum levels of tryptase—a mast cell mediator commonly used to assist in the diagnosis of 
mast cell–associated diseases7,11. Mast cells have often been implicated in certain functional 
disorders; however, our patients did not have evidence of clonal mast cell disease or 
evidence of mast cell activation, whereas many did have connective tissue manifestations 
overlapping with those seen in EDS III. Because elevated basal serum tryptase levels 
without mastocytosis is a relatively common trait in the general population and in one report 
has been associated with functional symptoms1,2, we set out to identify the genetic cause for 
elevated tryptase levels and to characterize associated clinical phenotypes in these families 
and in unselected individuals.
We approached this challenging problem by first mapping and identifying the genomic 
lesion associated with elevated basal serum tryptase levels and characterizing symptoms in 
affected families (Supplementary Fig. 1). We identified 96 subjects from 35 families with a 
syndrome of elevated basal serum tryptase levels and complex clinical features following an 
autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance without evidence of mastocytosis (see 
Supplementary Table 1 for demographics). Affected individuals had multiple comorbid 
symptoms, including those often considered ‘functional’ in nature because of the lack of 
pathological findings. Gastrointestinal dysmotility was common, most often manifesting as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), defined by Rome III criteria (49%) or symptoms of chronic 
gastroesophageal reflux (65%), with both present at a prevalence approximately three- to 
fivefold greater than that in the general population12,13. Connective tissue abnormalities 
were also common; the overall prevalence of joint hypermobility (Beighton ≥ 4, ages 12–76 
years) was 28% (approximately twice the prevalence for the general population14), while 
congenital skeletal abnormalities (26%) and retained primary dentition (21%) were also 
frequently identified. These findings were associated with chronic arthralgia (45%) and 
headache or body pain (47%). Complaints suggestive of autonomic dysfunction, including 
postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), were common. Forty-six percent of 
individuals had elevated composite autonomic symptom scores by validated measure 
(COMPASS 31), of whom 11 (34% of those with elevated scores) were validated by tilt-
table testing (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Additional symptoms included recurrent cutaneous 
flushing and pruritus (51%), which in some cases associated with urticaria, concomitant 
with complaints of sleep disruption (39%). Systemic reaction to stinging insects (for 
example, Hymenoptera), an occurrence known to be associated with elevated basal serum 
tryptase levels15, was increased by two- to threefold (16%) over the frequency of such 
reactions in the general population16 (Table 1).
Exome and genome sequencing of the first 12 families yielded no shared rare or common 
variants. However, linkage analysis identified a single 5.1-Mb peak on chromosome 16p13.3 
(logarithm of odds (LOD) = 4.46), a region containing the human tryptase locus, composed

 of four paralogous genes (TPSG1, TPSB2, TPSAB1, and TPSD1) (Fig. 1a). The primary 
secreted tryptase gene products at this locus include β-tryptase, encoded by TPSAB1 and 
TPSB2, and α-tryptase, resulting from a series of variants within the TPSAB1 gene. A 
modified Southern blot assay performed on 15 families (55 affected and 13 unaffected 
individuals) identified elevated α–tryptase/β-tryptase ratios among affected family members 
and, when applied to pedigrees, suggested that multiple copies of α-tryptase–encoding 
sequence were inherited together (Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). Inspection of genome 
sequencing reads permitted in silico construction of a consensus reference sequence that was 
used to calculate copy number for the sequence encoding α-tryptase and for design of a 
digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay to specifically target α-tryptase (Supplementary Figs. 3 
and 4). ddPCR analysis of all 35 families (96 affected and 41 unaffected individuals) 
confirmed increased copy number for α-tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1 inherited 
on one or both alleles in all affected individuals. All individuals who inherited a single copy 
of α-tryptase–encoding sequence on both alleles (thus, also having a 2α genotype at 
TPSAB1) had normal basal serum tryptase levels (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Having duplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence on both alleles or a triplication of the 
sequence on a single allele was associated with significantly higher tryptase levels than 
having duplication on one allele (P = 0.0012 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, 
having triplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence on one allele was associated with 
greater prevalence of associated clinical phenotypes than having duplication on one allele, 
demonstrating a correlation of phenotype with gene dose (Table 1).
Mast cells grown from CD34+ progenitors derived from the whole blood of individuals with 
increased copy number on a single allele of α-tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1 did 
not have abnormal growth or morphology. Likewise, intracellular tryptase expression and 
IgE-mediated degranulation activity did not significantly differ in comparison to controls 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). However, we identified increased total TPSAB1 and TPSB2 
mRNA levels both in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived primary mast cells 
(n = 5 for each group) and ex vivo total PBMCs (n = 10 for each group) from individuals 
with duplication or triplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1 
(Supplementary Fig. 6c). Furthermore, among individuals with a single-allele increase in the 
number of copies of α-tryptase–encoding sequence, supernatants from primary mast cell 
cultures showed more spontaneous tryptase secretion than comparable cells from matched 
controls (n = 5 individuals for each group) (Fig. 1d).
To begin to determine whether additional copies on a single allele of α-tryptase–encoding 
sequence in TPSAB1 might commonly be associated with elevated basal serum tryptase 
levels in the general population, we next applied our bioinformatic strategy to a large cohort 
of patients and healthy family members from the National Institute of Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) programs in clinical genomics on whom genome sequencing 
was performed for reasons unrelated to mast cells or tryptase. This retrospective analysis 
was limited to individuals in whom sequencing coverage was sufficient to call TPSAB1 
copy number and from whom serum samples were available to measure tryptase levels 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). We performed ddPCR on all individuals (n = 17) with basal serum 
tryptase concentration >8 ng/ml or ≥2 copies of α-tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1

 identified using our bioinformatic strategy. Among 98 individuals, we identified 8 (8.2%) 
with duplications on a single allele of α-tryptase–encoding sequence. This accounted for all 
individuals with elevated basal serum tryptase concentration (>11.4 ng/ml) in the cohort 
(Fig. 2a). Moreover, we observed a dominant inheritance pattern for elevated basal serum 
tryptase levels in both families for which samples were available.
Finally, to validate the observed association between copy number of α-tryptase–encoding 
sequence in TPSAB1 and basal serum tryptase levels, and to explore the effect of this 
genetic finding on clinical phenotypes in an unselected population, we interrogated the 
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) ClinSeq cohort, a group of healthy 
unrelated volunteers. First, 125 deidentified serum samples were found to be partially 
enriched for duplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence using a common haplotype and 
were screened for elevated basal serum tryptase levels (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for details 
of enrichment). Sixteen of the individuals with a concentration above 8 ng/ml (n = 25) were 
genotyped by the bioinformatic algorithm (9 individuals were excluded because of a lack of 
genomic sequence coverage) and subsequently by our ddPCR assay. Attempts were then 
made to contact all available individuals for phone interview; interviewers were blinded to 
tryptase levels and genotype (see Supplementary Table 2 for demographics). Single-allele 
duplications of α-tryptase–encoding sequence were identified in nine of these individuals, 
fully accounting for all individuals with elevated basal serum tryptase levels of those 
genotyped in this cohort (Fig. 2b). Three of the nine individuals were phenotypically 
indistinguishable from affected members of the initial referral cohort (Supplementary Table 
3), and duplication of α-tryptase–encoding sequence was significantly associated with 
cutaneous flushing, itching, or hives (P = 0.014), systemic venom reactions (P = 0.047), IBS 
(defined by Rome III criteria; P = 0.042), retained primary dentition (P = 0.020), and 
elevated autonomic symptom scores (defined by COMPASS 31; P = 0.038) (Table 2). 
Family histories suggestive of affected family members were present for four of the nine, 
and elevated basal serum tryptase levels could be confirmed in first-degree relatives for two 
of the three families for which these measures were available.
The overall sensitivity of the ddPCR TPSAB1 genotyping assay in detecting individuals 
with elevated basal serum tryptase levels was 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 95.1–
100%), and the specificity was 90.0% (95% CI = 85.1–93.7%).
Consistent with previous studies, our data indicate that elevated basal serum tryptase 
concentration is a relatively common biochemical trait. We have found that this phenotype is 
most frequently inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and that, when this occurs, it is 
exclusively associated with increased copy number on a single allele of α-tryptase–encoding 
sequence in the TPSAB1 gene, a genetic trait we have termed hereditary α-tryptasemia. In 
turn, elevated basal serum tryptase concentration is associated with increased prevalence of 
multiple predominantly functional and clinical phenotypes, including recurrent cutaneous 
symptoms, symptoms of autonomic instability, and functional gastrointestinal disorders, as 
well as systemic venom reactions and connective tissue abnormalities. The families studied 
in our initial cohort likely represent the most severe phenotypes among individuals affected 
with hereditary α-tryptasemia, owing in part to the lack of detection of triplication of α-

 tryptase–encoding sequence in unselected populations, which we have tentatively designated 
as hereditary α-tryptasemia syndrome.
In vitro experiments suggest that elevated TPSAB1 transcript levels lead to increased 
translation and constitutive secretion of α-protryptase, thereby accounting for the elevated 
basal serum tryptase levels seen in vivo. This may occur by a stoichiometric phenomenon, 
particularly if only a single allele of the TPSAB1 locus is expressed, as has commonly been 
shown to occur for other genes17. The apparent gene-dose effect manifested as total basal 
serum tryptase levels seems to support this assertion. However, altered epigenetic regulation 
of the locus when additional copies of α-tryptase–encoding sequence are present may serve 
as a contributing factor.
The genetics of the human tryptase locus are complex. This locus sits within a gene-rich 
region at 16p13.3 that is a hotspot for genetic recombination18,19. It is hypothesized that the 
multiple tryptase genetic loci in humans evolved through duplication and inversion of this 
locus20. Two adjacent genes, TPSAB1 and TPSB2, encode the four major isoforms (βI, βII, 
βIII, and α (αI)) of what is believed to be biologically relevant soluble tryptase; the α-
tryptase isoform is only reported as being encoded at the TPSAB1 locus. The high degree of 
identity between sequences encoding the α-tryptase and β-tryptase isoforms, and the 
presence of multiple paralogs in a single locus, makes detection of copy number variation 
difficult, likely precluding genome-wide association studies or quantitative arrays from 
detecting TPSAB1 copy number variation. Our ddPCR assay provides indirect evidence that 
gene duplications are occurring within the locus; duplicated or triplicated α-tryptase–
encoding sequence in TPSAB1 did not randomly assort into droplets without restriction 
digestion, indicating that multiple copies were present within fragments of genomic DNA 
formed during extraction (maximum fragment size is approximately 50 kb) and that the 
duplicate copies are therefore relatively tightly linked in the genome and may be subject to 
the same enhancers and other control elements.
Part of the clinical presentation in hereditary α-tryptasemia syndrome includes symptoms 
that may be associated clinically with mast cell mediator release and, in the context of 
elevated basal serum tryptase levels, can trigger an extensive work-up for clonal mast cell 
disease, including bone marrow biopsy. Because elevated tryptase levels are seen in a 
relatively large proportion of the general population, the decision to proceed with such a 
work-up can be challenging. Performing tryptase genotyping as part of this work-up may be 
warranted in light of our findings.
How elevated basal serum tryptase levels might contribute to the associated multisystem 
disorder we observed remains unclear. On the basis of clinical phenotypes, including pain 
and connective tissue abnormalities, a compelling case could be made for activation of 
protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)-dependent pathways. However, coinheritance of a 
second functional genetic variant contributing to the complex clinical phenotype cannot be 
ruled out. Although further work is required to determine the relationship between elevated 
tryptase levels and associated phenotypes, α-tryptase remains an attractive future therapeutic 
candidate, as a substantial proportion of the general population (>25%) is deficient in α-
tryptase without known untoward effects.

ONLINE METHODS
Subjects
α-Tryptasemia cohort—Informed consent was provided by all patients and their relatives 
on NIH IRB-approved research protocols designed to study mastocytosis (NCT00044122 
and NCT00001756) and/or atopy (NCT01164241, NCT00852943, and NCT00557895). 
Over a 5-year period, family and personal medical histories were obtained and physical 
examinations were performed on all individuals able to travel to the NIH. After recognizing 
that this familial presentation included a wide range of symptoms, histories and exams were 
expanded throughout family accrual (for demographics of this cohort, see Supplementary 
Table 1). When patients were unavailable for a direct encounter or if the patients were 
evaluated before establishing the full phenotype, a comprehensive history and assessment 
was performed using electronic media to characterize symptoms and reported physician 
diagnoses. Blood samples were collected for genetic testing and tryptase measurement. 
Reported clinical diagnoses were based upon patient report of physician diagnosis and/or a 
consistent clinical history and physical exam, as well as review of outside records and test 
results, where available/applicable. For definitions and criteria for reported symptoms and 
diagnoses pertaining to all three cohorts, see the Supplementary Note. Two validated 
questionnaires, the Rome III questionnaire to interrogate IBS21 and the COMPASS 31 
questionnaire to interrogate dysautonomia22, were also administered to a majority of 
individuals in the cohort.
NIAMS and NIAID clinical genomics cohort—Informed consent was provided by all 
patients and their relatives on NIH IRB-approved research protocols designed to study 
immunodeficiency and autoinflammation (NCT00246857, NCT00128973, and 
NCT00059748).
ClinSeq cohort—Individuals were chosen (Supplementary Fig. 1c) from the ClinSeq 
study (NCT00410241), a project employing exome sequencing in a clinical research setting, 
to serve as an unselected study cohort. The majority of participants were healthy adult 
volunteers (for demographics of those included, see Supplementary Table 2), with 
approximately 25% having a personal history of coronary artery disease. Participants were 
broadly consented to genome sequencing and the return of individual sequencing results23. 
Blinded phone interviews were conducted to identify clinical phenotypes and reported 
physician diagnoses among the ClinSeq participants comporting with our defined criteria 
(Supplementary Note). Histories focused on symptoms and conditions we identified in 
association with inherited elevation of tryptase levels7, as well as those queried in a 
published questionnaire for the diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS)24. 
Standardized questionnaires to assess for IBS (Rome III) and autonomic dysfunction 
(COMPASS 31) were also administered to this population.

 Individual controls—Volunteers who did not have significant clinical allergic disease or 
connective tissue abnormalities and did not have elevated basal serum tryptase levels were 
selected and provided informed consent on NIH IRB-approved protocols. They were 
recruited to act as experimental controls (NCT00806364).
Genetic sequencing and analysis
For the α-tryptasemia cohort, exome sequencing was performed on eight families using 
TruSeq (Illumina) capture kits and a custom analysis pipeline as described25. Genome 
sequencing was performed as described26 on nine families (five of which had previously 
undergone exome sequencing) using the HiSeq platform (Illumina) with the Burrows–
Wheeler aligner, and Picard was used for basic alignment and sequence quality control. The 
same capture kits and strategies were employed for the genome sequencing performed in the 
NIAMS and NIAID clinical genomics cohorts. For the ClinSeq cohort, exome sequencing 
was performed as described27.
Linkage analysis
The GATK UnifiedGenotyper (with parameters -stand_call_conf 5.0, -stand_emit_conf 5.0, 
-dcov 500) and SAMtools were used to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 
indels, and GATK VariantsToBinaryPed (with parameter -minGenotypeQuality 10) was used 
to produce binary pedigrees from variant call format (VCF) files. PLINK was then used to 
convert the binary pedigree files to LINKAGE format files. The PEDSTATS module in 
Merlin28 was used to check pedigree structure, and Merlin was used to perform parametric 
rare dominant linkage analysis.
Bone marrow biopsy and KIT gene analysis
Bone marrow biopsies were performed on probands from seven families to exclude the 
diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis as described7. An additional eight families were 
screened for the activating KIT mutation c.2447A>T (p.Asp816Val) using allele-specific 
PCR, as described29.
Tryptase protein quantification
Total basal serum tryptase levels were measured using a commercially available 
fluorescence enzyme immunoassay in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA)-certified laboratories. Further fractionation and measurement of tryptase levels were 
performed as described30, using the UniCAP immunofluorescent assay (Thermo Fisher) for 
total protein (precursor and mature forms of α- and β-tryptase) and an ELISA for mature α- 
and β-tryptase levels, in a CLIA-approved laboratory (L.B.S.). The lower limit of detection 
for each tryptase assay was 1 ng/ml. Currently, the normal range in serum for total tryptase 
is 1–11.4 ng/ml and for mature tryptase is <1 ng/ml (ref. 31).
Tryptase genotyping
A unique reference consensus sequence for the tryptase locus was generated using genome 
sequencing data. A computer algorithm was then created to extract all reads originally 
mapped to the ~50-kb region containing the locus. These reads were then remapped to the

 deduced short consensus region (see the Supplementary Note for a complete description) to 
determine specific tryptase gene sequences and their relative abundance. Initial tryptase 
genotyping used a validated modified semiquantitative Southern blot technique as 
described32.
To directly quantify allelic α- and β-tryptase copy number, a ddPCR assay was developed 
using custom primers and probes for α- and β-tryptase based on published sequences20,33,34 
and consensus sequences derived in silico (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary 
Table 4); the probes did not hybridize to γ- or δ-tryptase. The assay was performed on 
native or restriction-endonuclease-treated genomic DNA using the PrimePCR ddPCR Copy 
Number reference AP3B1, according to the manufacturer’s specifications (Bio-Rad), 
allowing for accurate detection of multiple TPSAB1 copies on a single allele 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–d and Supplementary Note).

The code generated for in silico tryptase genotyping is provided in the Supplementary Note.

Mast cell culture and analysis
CD34+ cells were isolated from PBMCs and cultured under conditions as described to yield 
primary mast cells35. Cells were washed, stained with Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (Invitrogen), 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 5% saponin, and stained intracellularly 
with antibody to tryptase (clone AA1) conjugated to phycoerythrin (Novus Biologicals). 
Total mRNA was extracted from mast cells and real-time PCR was performed as described25 
to quantify total tryptase mRNA expression using the tryptase primer–probe set for TPSB2 
(Life Technologies) that captures all α and β isoforms from TPSB2 and TPSAB1, but not δ- 
or γ-tryptase. Mast cell degranulation was assessed by measuring β-hexosaminidase release 
as described36, and whole-cell lysates from mast cells were obtained as described37. To 
characterize the size and quantity of tryptase molecules from these cultures, total tryptase 
levels in lysates and culture supernatants were determined by immunoblotting, using rabbit 
antibody to human tryptase at a 1:1,000 dilution (clone G3, EMD Millipore).
Statistical analyses
Mann–Whitney, Wilcoxon matched-pairs, or Fisher’s exact tests were employed to test the 
significance of associations as indicated; in all cases, two-tailed tests were used. In all 
populations examined, basal serum tryptase levels did not follow a normal distribution 
(D’Agostino–Pearson test): unaffected individuals (n = 196, K2 = 16.84, P = 0.0002), 
individuals with α-tryptasemia (n = 113, K2 = 18.38, P = 0.0001), αα tryptase allele carriers 
(n = 91, K2 = 15.85, P = 0.0004), and ααα tryptase allele carriers (n = 17, K2 = 8.28, P = 
0.0159). A two-tailed F test was used to determine whether the observed variances in 
populations were different. The standard deviation of basal serum tryptase values among 
individuals with hereditary α-tryptasemia (n = 113), regardless of genotype, was 
significantly different than the standard deviation observed in unaffected individuals (n =

 196) (F value = 11, DFn = 112, Dfd = 195, P < 0.0001), indicating that this population 
distribution is distinct from that of unaffected individuals. Among affected individuals, the 
standard deviation of tryptase values was not significantly different when comparing 
between αα (n = 91) and ααα (n = 17) individuals (F value = 1.144, DFn = 16, Dfd = 90, P 
= 0.65).
To assess dysautonomia among individuals, an expected scoring range was established. To 
accomplish this, the COMPASS 31 questionnaire was administered to 35 healthy family 
members from the α-tryptasemia and NIAID clinical genomics cohorts, in whom tryptase 
levels were within the normal range and in whom α-tryptase gene dose was confirmed both 
by bioinformatic algorithm and ddPCR assay to be ≤1 copy per allele. The upper 95% 
confidence interval of the median was defined as the normal cutoff, with individuals scoring 
higher than this number considered to be outliers and symptomatic. Fisher’s exact test was 
then applied to test statistical significance.

Inherited duplications and triplications of the α-tryptase–encoding sequence in the TPSAB1 
gene are associated with elevated basal serum tryptase levels and enhanced mast cell 
secretion of tryptase. (a) Top, linkage analysis of exome sequence data from eight families 
showing the single linkage region on chromosome 16p13.3 (556,104–5,653,182, GRCh37/
hg19) (LOD = 4.46). Middle, the 36.6-kb tryptase locus present within this region contains 
four tryptase-encoding genes: TPSG1, TPSB2, TPSAB1, and TPSD1. TPSB2 and TPSAB1 
can both encode β-tryptase, but only TPSAB1 encodes α-tryptase. Individuals with inherited

tryptase–encoding sequence in TPSAB1; schematics of how this genetic change may 
manifest are shown at the bottom. (b) Basal serum tryptase levels and corresponding 
TPSAB1 tryptase genotypes (where α represents one copy of α-tryptase and β represents 
one copy of β-tryptase) among families (n = 35) identified with hereditary α-tryptasemia 
syndrome. The upper limit of normal, as defined by multiple clinical laboratories (>11.4 ng/
ml), is indicated by the dashed line. Data are shown as geometric means; *P = 0.0012, **P < 
0.0001, Mann–Whitney test. (c) Sample pedigrees from four families with hereditary α-
tryptasemia syndrome; numbers indicate basal serum tryptase concentration (in ng/ml). (d)
