Survival to extreme ages clusters within families. However, identifying genetic loci conferring
longevity and low morbidity in such longevous families is challenging. There is debate con-
cerning the survival percentile that best isolates the genetic component in longevity. Here, we
use three-generational mortality data from two large datasets, UPDB (US) and LINKS
(Netherlands). We study 20,360 unselected families containing index persons, their parents,
siblings, spouses, and children, comprising 314,819 individuals. Our analyses provide strong
evidence that longevity is transmitted as a quantitative genetic trait among survivors up to
the top 10% of their birth cohort. We subsequently show a survival advantage, mounting to
31%, for individuals with top 10% surviving first and second-degree relatives in both data-
bases and across generations, even in the presence of non-longevous parents. To guide
future genetic studies, we suggest to base case selection on top 10% survivors of their birth
cohort with equally long-lived family members.

uman lifespan has a low heritability (12–25%)1–4, whereas
survival into extreme ages (longevity) clusters within
families5–9. Studies showed that parents, siblings5–7,9–12,
and children7,13–17 of longevous persons lived longer than first-
degree relatives of non-longevous persons or population controls.
In addition, members of these longevous families seem to delay or
even escape age-related diseases18–21 and in fact, healthy ageing
in such families is marked by well attuned immune systems and
good metabolic health22–24. Understanding the genetic factors
influencing longevity may provide novel insights into the
mechanisms that promote health and minimize disease risk1,25.
Identifying longevity loci, however, has been challenging and only
a handful of genetic variants have been shown to associate with
longevity across multiple independent studies25–32. The most
consistent evidence has been obtained for variants in APOE and
FOXO3A genes25–30,33 in either genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) or candidate gene studies.
The lack of consistent findings in longevity studies hampers
comparative research and may be explained by genetic and envir-
onmental heterogeneity on one hand and uncertainty in defining
the longevity trait itself, as illustrated by the large variation of
longevity definitions on the other hand1,3,7,10,13–17,19,20,25–32,34–38.
Establishing a threshold that best isolates the genetic component of
longevity and including mortality information of family members is
important because the environmentally-related increase in lifespan
over recent decennia has caused an increase in longevity pheno-
copies. As a result, genetic longevity studies generally focus on
singletons (i.e., individuals without longevous family members),
selected based on one generation of mortality data27,28,31,32,39. Here,
we aim to establish the threshold for longevity in unselected (for
survival) multigenerational families and determine the importance
of longevous family members for case selection so that those
insights can be used in genetic studies to identify novel longevity
loci.
We use the data available in the Utah Population Database
(UPDB, Utah) and the LINKing System for historical family
reconstruction (LINKS, Zeeland) based on US and Dutch citizens,
respectively. Zeeland was a region with difficult living conditions
compared to Utah (see Methods section). In these datasets, we
identify 20,360 three-generational families (F1–F3) containing
index persons (IPs, F2), their parents (F1), siblings (F2), spouses
(F2), and children (F3) comprising 314,819 persons in total. First,
we examine the association between the survival, measured as age
at death, of IPs (F2) and the number of parents (F1) and siblings
(F2) belonging to the top 1–60% of their birth cohort, in a
cumulative
way
(comparing
mutually
inclusive
percentile
groups). Second, we determine the survival percentile threshold
that drives the cumulative effects as a criterion for defining
human longevity by investigating IP (F2) survival when divided
into mutually exclusive groups based on the longevity of their
parents (F1) and siblings (F2). Third, we focus on the top 10%
parents and siblings to investigate whether longevous and non-
longevous parents, with increasing number of longevous siblings,
transmit longevity to the IPs. Fourth, we confirm our findings in
the next generation (F3) by examining the association between
the survival, measured as age at death or last observation, of IPs’
children (F3) and longevity of IPs (F2), their spouses (parents, F2)
and siblings (aunts and uncles, F2). Finally, we explore potential
environmental influences by studying spouses (F2) of longevous
IPs (F2).
Results
Study population. We identified three generations of families in the
UPDB and LINKS covering 10,246 and 10,114 families, respectively,
who were centered around a single IP (F2) per family (Fig. 1). We
identified parents (F1, NUPDB = 20,492 and NLINKS = 20,228),
siblings
(F2,
NUPDB = 54,144
and
NLINKS = 53,978),
spouses
(F2,
NUPDB = 11,230
and
NLINKS = 10,788),
and
children
(F3, NUPDB = 61,104 and NLINKS = 62,495) for all IPs in both
datasets (Table 1). IPs were born between 1767 and 1902 in the
UPDB, and between 1797 and 1902 in LINKS. In the UPDB, 51% of
the IPs were female, compared to 53% in LINKS. The IPs’ mean age
at death was 70.88 (SD = 16.03) years in the UPDB and 63.86
(SD = 17.99) years in LINKS. No IPs were censored, as they were
selected to have an available birth and death date. In addition,
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the age at death distribution for the
IPs in both datasets. In the following sections, we explore associa-
tions between IP survival and the number of 1–60% surviving
parents and siblings in a cumulative analysis and subsequently
identify in mutually exclusive IP groups the survival percentile
threshold that drives the cumulative effect and demarcates longevity
(see Methods section).
IP survival advantage with top 1–60% parents and siblings. For
the first examination of the association between the number of
parents (1 or 2, F1) and siblings (1 or 2+, F2) and IP (F2) survival
and to explore if a larger level of family aggregation, in terms of
numbers of parents (F1) and siblings (F2), was more evident at
extreme survival percentiles, we fitted Cox regressions for each
subsequent survival percentile (1st to 60th percentile). Figure 2a,
c shows that IPs with 1 parent belonging to the top 1–60%, had a
survival advantage over IPs without a parent belonging to the top
1–60%. This was shown by the lowest observed statistically sig-
nificant hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80 (95% CImax-top 1% = 0.73–0.88)
in the UPDB and 0.74 (95% CImax-top 1% = 0.65–0.85) in LINKS
where max refers to the age with the largest effect and CI to
confidence interval. These HRs indicate a 20% and 26%
lower hazard of dying respectively and from here we will refer to
this as a 20% and 26% survival advantage. Having 2 parents
belonging to the top 1–60% provides a stronger survival advan-
tage to IPs (HRmax-top 2%-UPDB = 0.64 (95%CI = 0.50–0.84) and
HRmax-top 14%-LINKS = 0.72 (95% CI = 0.65–0.80)), although Fig. 2
shows that the power to detect survival effects of IPs with 2
longevous parents up to the 10th percentile was weak for LINKS
due to low group sizes.
The association of IP survival with longevous siblings is shown
in Fig. 2b, d. The maximum statistically significant HRs for IPs
with 1 longevous sibling were 0.76 (95% CImax-top 1% = 0.62–0.92)
and 0.79 (95% CImax-top 5% = 0.67–0.93) in the UPDB and LINKS,
respectively. For IPs with 2 or more longevous siblings, these HRs
were 0.65 (95% CImax-top 3%-UPDB = 0.51–0.84) and 0.67 (95%
CImax-top 8%-LINKS = 0.50–0.90). The slopes in Fig. 2a–d show a

 slight increase of IP survival advantage with the increase in
percentile score. For example, IPs with parents with the best
survival (the left-most end of the x-axis) had lower hazard rates
than IPs with the least survival (the right-most end of the x-axis).
We conclude that IP survival when expressed in HRs, both in the
UPDB and LINKS, increased with the number of longevous
parents, with the number of longevous siblings and, though
modestly, with the increase of parent and sibling survival
percentile scores as observed in Fig. 2.
Top 10–15% surviving family members demarcates longevity.
To determine the survival percentile threshold that drove the
survival advantage of IPs (F2) with the number of top 1–60%
parents (F1), as shown in Fig. 2, we constructed 6 mutually
exclusive IP (F2) groups (g) based on the survival percentiles of
F1 parents (g1 = [≥0th & ≤1th percentile], g2 = [≥1th & ≤5th
percentile], g3 = [≥5th &
≤10th percentile], g4 = [≥10th &
≤15th percentile], g5 = [≥15th & ≤20th percentile], g6 = [≥20th
& ≤100th percentile], see Methods section) and compared groups
1–5 with group 6. Figure 3a, b shows the HRs of IP groups for the
UPDB and LINKS and is supplemented by the IP age at death
and survival percentile variation, as depicted in Supplementary
Figure 2. Figure 3a, b illustrates that IPs in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4
had a significant survival advantage compared to group 6, with
the lowest HR for group 1 in both the UPDB and LINKS (HRmax-
UPDB = 0.76 (95% CI = 0.67–0.86) and HRmax-LINKS = 0.72 (95%
CI = 0.60–0.86)). Group 5 did not statistically differ from group 6
(HRgroup5-UPDB = 1 (95% CI = 0.91–1.10) and HRgroup5-LINKS =
0.96 (95% CI = 0.87–1.05)) and thus, these effects indicate that
the top 15% surviving parents drove the association with the
survival advantage of IPs as shown in Fig. 2.
In the same way, we investigated the association of IPs’ (F2)
survival with that of siblings (F2). Figure 3c, d shows a survival
advantage of IPs in UPDB group 1–3 and LINKS group 2 and 3 as
compared to group 6 with the lowest HR for group 1 (UPDB) and
group 2 (LINKS) (HRgroup1-UPDB = 0.70 (95% CI = 0.59–0.85) and
HRgroup2-LINKS = 0.77 (95% CI = 0.65–0.92)), respectively. Groups
4 and 5 did not significantly differ from group 6 (HRgroup4-UPDB =
0.99 (95% CI = 0.88–1.12) and HRgroup4-LINKS = 0.86 (95% CI =
0.73–1.02)), which indicated that both in the UPDB and LINKS
the top 10% surviving siblings drove the association with the
survival advantage of IPs as shown in Fig. 2.
Based on the results presented in the cumulative and mutually
exclusive group analyses, we focused on the top 10% surviving
family members because the mutually exclusive group analysis
(analysis 2, Fig. 3) indicated longevity effects up to the top 10%
and 15% for siblings and parents, respectively. Using the top 10%
is consistent between the two groups and is a conservative choice.
Furthermore, the cumulative analysis (analysis 1, Fig. 2) indicated
that the top 10% was a reasonable trade-off between effect size
and group size (power) within and between the UPDB and
LINKS. Hence, we explored the familial clustering of longevity
and the influence of covariates for the top 10% surviving parents
and siblings and verified all results in the subsequent generation
(F3). Next to the top 10% we also conducted our analyses on the
top 5% which are illustrated in Supplementary Figures 3–5 and
Supplementary Tables 1–5.
Additive association between 10% surviving relatives and IPs.
Figure 2e–h shows the cumulative hazard (CH) curves for IPs
(F2) with 0, 1 and 2 or more, or exactly 2 parents/siblings (F1/F2)
belonging to the top 10% of their birth cohorts and we show
Kaplan–Meier and Nelson–Aalen baseline measures in Supple-
mentary Figure 6. Both in the UPDB and LINKS, the survival
advantage associated with the number of top 10% siblings
appeared to start during the beginning (45 years in LINKS) and
end (65 years in the UPDB) of the mid-life period. In both the
UPDB and LINKS, the survival advantage of IPs with the number
of top 10% parents started at the age of 40 years. It should be
noted that early life effects could not be tested for, because IPs
were selected on having a child for the construction of three
generation families.
Table 2 accompanies Fig. 2e–h by showing the HRs for the
number of top 10% parents (F1) and siblings (F2) and for the
covariates we used to adjust the analyses. IPs with 1 top 10%
parent had a maximum survival advantage of 12% and 18%
compared to IPs without such a parent (HR = 0.88max-UPDB (95%
CI = 0.83–0.92) and HR = 0.82max-LINKS (95%CI = 0.78–0.86)).
The maximum statistically significant survival advantage for IPs
with 2 top 10% parents was 27% and 31% (HRmax-UPDB = 0.73
(95%CI = 0.65–0.83)
and
HRmax-LINKS = 0.69
(95%CI =
0.58–0.82)). The maximum statistically significant HR for having
1 top 10% sibling was 0.82 (95% CIUPDB = 0.76–0.90) and 0.82
(95% CILINKS = 0.73–0.93). For 2+ top 10% siblings the HR was

or exactly 2 top 10% siblings and parents respectively was
independent of covariates such as sibship size and religion (LDS
church affiliation, Table 2 and Supplementary Table 6 and 7).
Religious IPs from Utah had a lower HR than non-religious
persons (HRUPDB = 0.73 (95% CI = 0.65–0.81)) and in the UPDB
we observed that sibship size had a small influence on the survival
of IPs (HRUPDB = 1.01 (95% CI = 1.00–1.02) whereas in LINKS,
sibship size had no significant effect HRLINKS = 1.01 (95% CI =
1.00–1.02)). The survival of IPs increased with the increase of
birth cohort (HRUPDB
and
LINKS = 0.99 (95% CI = [>0.99 to
<1.00])) and women had a better survival than men in the UPDB
(HRUPDB = 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76)), but not in LINKS
(HRLINKS = 1.01 (95% CI = 0.96–1.06)). Furthermore, in Utah,
high socio-economic status IPs outlived low socio-economic
status IPs whereas this was not the case in LINKS. The association
between the number of longevous parents/siblings and the
survival of IPs were independent of each other and no other
statistically significant effect was observed for having both
longevous parents and siblings. Moreover, the number of
longevous siblings showed a strong association with the survival
of IPs when both parents were non-longevous. The HR for 1
longevous sibling was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.79–0.91) and the HR for
2 or more longevous siblings was 0.78 (95% CI = 0.67–0.90) in
the UPDB. The HR for 1 longevous sibling was 0.78 (95%

 CI = 0.72–0.85) and the HR for 2 or more longevous siblings was
0.72 (95% CI = 0.53–0.99) in LINKS (Supplementary Table 8). In
a final step, we observed no evidence that the association of IP
survival and parental longevity depended on maternal or paternal
effects, for example through transmission preferentially via the
mother or father (Supplementary Table 9). Likewise,
the
association of IP survival and parental longevity did not depend
on the sex of the IPs, meaning that this association was equal for
sons and daughters (Supplementary Figure 7 and Supplementary
Table 10).
Survival advantage for children with longevous relatives. We
explored the robustness of our findings in F1 and F2 by examining
the association between the longevity of IPs (F2), their spouses (F2)
and siblings (F2) and the survival of IPs’ children (F3). We inves-
tigated whether longevity was transmitted from IPs (F2) to their
children (F3) and if the children (F3) with longevous aunts and
uncles (siblings of the IPs, F2) had a survival advantage compared
to children (F3) without longevous aunts and uncles (F2). To test
this, we fitted Cox regressions, with a random effect (frailty) to

the UPDB and 0.77 (95% CILINKS = 0.71–0.84) in LINKS. Similar to
the IPs, we observed (1) that the survival of children did not depend
on maternal or paternal effects (Supplementary Table 9) and (2)

 that the association between parents and offspring was equal for
sons and daughters (Supplementary Table 10).
Children with 1 or more top 10% aunts or uncles had a 4–16%
survival advantage compared to children without such aunts or
uncles (HRmin-UPDB = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93–0.99) and HRmax-
LINKS = 0.84 (95% CI = 0.78–0.92)), and this effect was indepen-
dent of having a top 10% parent (either the IP or the IP’s spouse).
A stratified analysis showed that the survival benefit for children
with the number of top 10% aunts and uncles was still strongly
present when the IP and the IP’s spouse were non-longevous
(HRmin-UPDB−1 aunt/uncle = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93–0.99) and HRmax-
LINKS−2+ aunts/uncles = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.73–0.90)) (Supplementary
Table 11). Lastly, Supplementary Figure 8 shows that the survival
benefit for children of a longevous IP and a longevous IP with a
longevous spouse (i.e., 1 or 2 longevous parents) started from
birth (LINKS) and very early in life (UPDB).
Spouses live longer in Zeeland but not in Utah. Familial clus-
tering of longevity may depend on (later life) shared environ-
mental effects which could also provide survival benefits to the
spouses (F2) of longevous IPs (F2). Hence, we divided the spouses
(F2) into mutually exclusive groups according to the survival
percentiles of the IPs (see Methods). Figure 4a, c shows that none
of the spouse groups in the UPDB differed from reference group 6
or from any of the other groups, indicating no survival benefit for
spouses. In LINKS (Fig. 4b, d), spouses of IPs with the highest
survival percentile (group 2) had a 14% (HRgroup2-LINKS = 0.86
(95% CI = 0.78–0.94)) survival advantage compared to group
6 spouses. This survival advantage was similar for spouses of IPs
in groups 3, 4, and 5 (HRgroup3-LINKS = 0.86 (95% CI =
0.80–0.94);
HRgroup4-LINKS = 0.92
(95%
CI = 0.85–0.99);
HRgroup5-LINKS = 0.86 (95%CI = 0.79–0.93)). For group 1, the
effect was comparable but not significant (HRgroup1-LINKS = 0.85
(95% CI = 0.70–1.04)), the test in group 4 did not meet Bonfer-
roni correction for multiple testing.
Discussion
Human longevity clusters within specific families. Insight into
this clustering is important, especially to improve our under-
standing of genetic and environmental factors driving healthy
aging and longevity. The analyses of the UPDB and LINKS
datasets, which cover different environmental circumstances,
provide strong evidence that for longevous (up to the top 10%)
survivors and their families, longevity is transmitted as a quan-
titative genetic trait, regardless of parental and offspring sex. The
main observations supporting this notion are (1) in both datasets
the survival of F2 IPs, and their F3 children, increased with each
additional longevous parent (F1 and F2) and sibling (F2); (2) in
both datasets the survival of IPs (F2) increased with the number
of longevous siblings (F2) in the absence of longevous parents
(F1) and likewise the survival of IPs’ children (F3) increased with
the number of longevous aunts and uncles in the absence of
longevous parents. Finally, (3) both datasets indicate an absence
of a sex-specific pattern.
Previous studies of smaller sample size than the current study,
usually focusing on two generations of selected data (for mortality
or geographical locations) identified (1) an increase in the herit-
ability of lifespan with parental age8,40,41 and showed high recur-
rence risks between parental and offspring or sibling longevity.
Thus, providing indications that the heritability of longevity may
be stronger than that of lifespan5,7,13,14,42, (2) that sibling relative
risks beyond the top 5% survivors might not increase in a linear
fashion12 and that this non-linearity may indicate the existence of a
longevity threshold43, and (3) longevity recurrence risks for sib-
lings or parents of selected longevous individuals5–7,9–12 and
showed increased survival probabilities and longevity recurrence
risks for children of longevous parents7,13–17.
Here we used two unique, large three-generational datasets
(314,819 individuals in 20,360 families) which were unselected for
survival and cover multiple geographical areas. We utilized these
datasets to robustly identify a longevity threshold by showing that
the association between IP survival and the survival of parents
and siblings was not linear but in fact was driven by the oldest, up
to the top 10%, surviving parents and siblings. We further showed
that the survival of F2 IPs (and their F3 children) increased with
each additional longevous parent (F1 and F2), and sibling (F2).
We extended these analyses by showing that the survival for
children of IPs increased with each additional longevous aunt or
uncle. We also extended the analyses by investigating the asso-
ciation between IP survival and sibling longevity, and between the
survival of IPs’ children and the longevity of their aunts or uncles
in the absence of longevous parents.
Longevity was transmitted even if parents themselves did not
become longevous, which supports the notion that a beneficial
genetic component was transmitted. Likewise, the identified asso-
ciations are additive in the sense that an increase in the number of
parents, siblings, or aunts and uncles is associated with an increase
in the survival of IPs and the children of IPs. This additive pattern is
not necessarily expected if the findings are due to other, non-
genetic, factors that cluster within families (for example wealth).
This evidence is strengthened by the fact that similar additive
associations were identified for IPs and children of IPs without
longevous parents but with longevous siblings or aunts and uncles
(where the latter generally share less environmental influences with
the IPs). Further evidence for the transmission of a genetic com-
ponent was shown by the fact that none of the tested environmental
confounders affected the associations between parental/sibling
longevity and IP/children survival, as will be discussed further on in
the Discussion section. In addition, the fact that we observed very
similar results between the two databases, which cover populations
with vastly different environmentally-related mortality regimes,
significantly adds to the generalizability of our observations
regarding the associations between parental/sibling longevity and IP
(F2) and children (F3) survival.
We showed that spouses (F2) who married longevous IPs (F2)
did not live significantly longer than spouses (F2) who married a
non-longevous IP (F2) in the UPDB while they did in LINKS.
Previous studies showed inconclusive results regarding a possible
survival benefit for spouses of longevous persons6,7,9,44,45. In the
Long Life Family study, Pedersen et al.6 identified a survival
benefit for spouses of longevous siblings. The authors compared
the spouses to sex and birth cohort matched controls and suggest
assortative mating as an explanation for the observed survival
benefit of the spouses6. A Quebec study, focused on the spouses of
806 centenarians, also reported a survival benefit44 and a study of
Southern Italy demonstrated that male nonagenarians outlived
their spouses, whereas this was not the case for female non-
agenarians45. A recent study showed that the spouses of 944
nonagenarians had no survival benefit but a life-long sustained
survival pattern similar to the general population9. An explana-
tion for the difference between the UPDB and LINKS datasets
may possibly be that Zeeland had a higher level of relatedness
than in Utah. Zeeland had poor living conditions46 and was
characterized by out-migration to other provinces or abroad, but
limited mobility within the province to other places47. Utah at
that time had better living conditions48 with continuous streams
of freshly incoming migrants, ensuring a steady influx of new
genes49, creating high genetic diversity. Hence, it could be that in
Zeeland, spouses and IPs were often related to each other and
thus shared some of the genetic component contributing to
longevity.

 Unlike observations we previously made in the Leiden Long-
evity Study (LLS)9 concerning maternal effects on longevity in the
generation of the nonagenarians and their parents, we did not
observe evidence for a stronger transmission from either parent
to the IPs (F1 to F2), or from IPs to their children (F2 to F3) in
our current study. We cannot draw final conclusions on this
aspect because for the F1–F2 transmission we may have missed
parental influences on early life mortality since IPs were selected
for having survived to an age at which they had one child.
However, we did capture early life mortality for F2–F3 but in
those generations the selection pressure on child mortality was
already slightly decreasing50. In the same way, we observed no
differential association between parental longevity and the sur-
vival of sons or daughters (F2 and F3). This equal distribution is
in line with our observations in the LLS9, but so far, the literature
was less conclusive on this point15–17.
In all our analyses, except for the spouse analysis, we adjusted
for religion (UPDB only), sibship size, birth cohort, sex,

spouses of whom the IP belonged to the [≥5th & ≤10th percentile] of their birth cohort, group 4 = spouses of whom the IP belonged to the [≥10th & ≤15th
percentile] of their birth cohort, group 5 = spouses of whom the IP belonged to the [≥15th & ≤20th percentile] of their birth cohort, group 6 = spouses of
whom the IP belonged to the [≥20th & ≤100th percentile] of their birth cohort. The left column (panels a and b) shows the HRs of groups 1–5 compared to
group 6. Groups were colored by the extremity of the HR. The darker the blue the stronger the survival benefit, the darker the red, the weaker the survival
benefit and the effect was not significant with the red colors. The green lines represent the reference category, which is group 6. Ngreen line at the top-left =
8065, Ngreen line at the bottom-left = 7887. The right column (panels c and d) represents a post-hoc test of all groups and illustrates the p-values for the
differences in HR between the spouse groups. p-Values are estimated with Cox regression. Blue color indicates a statistically significant effect after
Bonferroni correction, red color indicates a non-statistically significant effect after Bonferroni correction. All estimates are adjusted for religion (UPDB
only), sibship size, birth cohort, sex, socio-economic status, mother’s age at birth, birth order, birth intervals, and twin birth. Error bars represent confidence
intervals

 socio-economic status, mother’s age at birth, birth order, birth
intervals, and twin birth. Some of these biological, social, and
demographic factors associated with the mortality of IPs (F2) and
their children (F3). Nevertheless, these covariates neither con-
founded the association between parental (F1) and sibling (F2)
longevity and IP (F2) survival, nor that between IP (F2) and
spouse (F2) longevity and their children’s (F3) survival or
between longevity of aunts and uncles (F2) and the survival of
IPs’ children (F3). This is in line with previous studies showing
only a minor51 or no52 influence of environmental covariates on
the association between parental longevity and offspring survival.
It was also shown that a range of early life factors, such as farm
ownership, parental literacy, and parental occupation did not
affect the association between parental and offspring mortality52.
We, however, cannot completely rule out that other, unobserved
non-genetic familial effects may affect our results. Furthermore,
using either Swedish or Dutch lifetables to determine survival
percentiles was quite strict for Zeeland because of the hazardous
environment46. As a result, the number of longevous persons was
quite low in LINKS relative to the UPDB. Although the IPs were
randomly selected, we could not completely rule out selection
effects, for example related to early life mortality. However,
confirmation of the F1–F2 results in the next generation
F2–F3 significantly strengthens the results and allowed us to cope
with the potential selection effects for IPs. In addition, a sensi-
tivity analysis for sample size, in which we fitted all our statistical
models on half of the UPDB and half of the LINKS data, provided
similar results to the full sample results, indicating that our results
are robust for a reduced sample size (Supplementary Figure 9).
Human Lifespan (defined as age at death) has a low heritability
in the population at large1–4. Studies estimated the heritability of
lifespan between 12% and 25%1–3 and a recent study estimated
that the heritability of lifespan was even lower, ~7%, after
adjustment for the lifespans of nongenetic (in-law) relatives4.
Therefore lifespan-based gene mapping may not be fruitful. In
addition, the genetic component of lifespan includes the herit-
ability of early life mortality, which is mainly due to disease and
external causes. Despite the low heritability and polygenic
architecture26,37 of lifespan, recent genetic studies have identi-
fied31,32 and replicated53 some lifespan loci of which the rare
alleles lower the risk of age-related diseases. Hence, using the
lifespan trait hampers the identification of genetic loci con-
tributing to survival into extreme ages (longevity). Longevity
however, clusters strongly within families as shown by previous
studies5–9 and robustly quantified in this study. Hence, the
longevity trait is much more promising and appropriate for the
identification of genetic loci contributing to survival into extreme
ages and should not be confused with the lifespan trait1,12. Our
results imply that to find loci that promote survival to the highest
ages in the population, genetic studies should be based on long-
lived cases including at least parental mortality information but
preferably also mortality information of siblings and other first
and second-degree relatives. The longevity threshold should
include cases belonging up to the top 10% survivors, with parents
belonging up to the top 15% survivors of their birth cohort and
siblings belonging up to the top 10% survivors of their birth
cohort. To sharpen the longevity effect, the percentile threshold
applied may be made more extreme but would likely lead
unnecessarily to a sample size with limited power. If our proposed
longevity definition is consistently applied across studies, the
comparative nature of longevity studies may improve and facil-
itate the discovery of novel genetic variants.
Methods
Ethical regulations. We complied with all relevant ethical regulations. For the
Utah data (UPDB), the study was approved by the Resource for Genetic and
Epidemiologic Research (RGE). For the Zeeland (LINKS) data, the study was
approved by the International Institute of Social History. For this study, no
informed consent needed to be obtained.
Utah Population Database. The UPDB contains demographic and genealogical
information which is linked to medical records. The data construction began in the
mid-1970s with genealogy records from the archives at the Utah Family History
Library and was initially based on the founding members of the Utah population,
their descendants, and then subsequently all individuals living in Utah. These
records contain demographic and mortality information on the pioneers of Utah
(US), their parents and children, and have been linked into multigenerational
pedigrees. The founding families were selected for the UPDB when at least one
member had a vital event (birth, marriage, or death) on the Mormon pioneer trail
or in Utah. The UPDB has been expanded to incorporate other high-quality, state-
wide data sources, such as birth and death certificates, cancer records, driver license
records, and census records. Currently, the UPDB contains information on more
than 11 million individuals and covers a maximum of 17 generations54 (https://
healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/research/updb/data/family-records.
php).
LINKing System for historical family reconstruction. The LINKS data contains
demographic and genealogical information which was derived from linked vital
event registers (birth, marriage, and death certificates). The data indexing began in
1995 by the “Zeeuws” archive and the results were published by way of “Wie-
WasWie”. The data currently covers over 25 million Dutch vital event records55
(https://socialhistory.org/en/hsn/linking-system-historical-family-reconstruction-
links). Data construction has been completed for the province of Zeeland and is
still ongoing for the other provinces in the Netherlands. Currently LINKS Zeeland
(henceforth referred to as LINKS) contains 739,453 birth, 387,102 marriage, and
641,216 death certificates which were linked together to reconstruct intergenera-
tional pedigrees and individual life courses47. In total, the Zeeland data contains
1,930,157 persons covering a maximum of 7 generations56.
Historical context of Utah and Zeeland. Both Utah and Zeeland were high
fertility populations46,48,57, with a mean number of children of around 7 during the
period of this study (1740–1952). In general, Utah was marked by healthy living
conditions and Zeeland by contrast, was a much unhealthier place to live. One of
the main reasons for the unhealthy living conditions in Zeeland was the lack of
clean drinking water, the high prevalence of waterborne diseases and of
malaria46,58,59. In Utah the quality of the drinking water was good, since water
from melting snow, that was filtered running of the mountains, was used to
drink48. The differences in living conditions between Utah and Zeeland were
reflected by a relatively low infant and childhood mortality in Utah60 and high
mortality rates for infants and children in Zeeland59, especially before 1900.
Moreover, Utah was known to be a high in-migration population49 whereas there
were indications that Zeeland had a low influx and outflux of migrants47.
Study selection. For the current study, we used 3 filial (F) generations (F1–F3) from
the UPDB and LINKS (NUPDB+LINKS = 314,819). We reconstructed families in both
datasets and denote generation 1 as the starting point of the pedigrees in the data.
The starting point for this study was generation 3 because starting here minimized
missing family links and birth or death dates due to the nature of the source material
underlying the data. We denote generation 3 as filial generation 1 (F1). Subsequently,
the children (NUPDB+LINKS = 123,599) of the F1 parents were identified (F2) so that
unique families were represented by 2 parents (F1) and their offspring (F2). Next an
IP (F2) was randomly selected per F2 sibship (NUPDB+LINKS = 20,360) meeting
the following criteria: (1) the date of birth and death had to be available, (2) at least
one child, sibling, and spouse had to be available, (3) sex had to be available, (4) for
the UPDB data only, the IP should preferably be identifiable on a genealogy record
(Supplementary Table 12). From there we identified the siblings (F2, NUPDB+LINKS =
108,122), spouses (F2, NUPDB+LINKS = 22,018), and the children (F3, NUPDB+LINKS =
123,599) of the IPs (Table 1 and Fig. 1). To summarize, both in the UPDB and
LINKS we identified IPs (F2), their parents (F1), siblings (F2), spouses (F2), and
children (F3).
All individuals in LINKS have at some point in their lives lived in Zeeland, this
is because the data were constructed based on vital event records from Zeeland.
Utah was first settled in 1847 and in the UPDB mortality information for ancestors
of Utah associated persons are available. As a result not all persons necessarily had
to live in Utah. Supplementary Table 13 shows that in our data, 97% of the IPs
lived in Utah. This percentage is lower for their fathers (80%) and mothers (87%),
and is an expected pattern given the historic nature of how Utah was settled.
Furthermore, 70% of the siblings, 97% of the spouses, and 92% of the children lived
in Utah. The majority of the persons from our sample who lived in Utah, migrated
from another state in the US to Utah (87%), 12% came from Europe, and 1% from
the rest of the world.
Lifetables. We used cohort lifetables to calculate birth cohort and sex-specific
survival percentiles for each individual in the UPDB and LINKS. This approach
prevents against the effects of secular mortality trends over the last centuries and

 enables comparisons across study populations1,12. We could not use US lifetables
because cohort lifetables were not available and period lifetables were only available
from 1933 onward. Moreover, the US birth cohort-based central death rates were
generally incomplete at the earlier cohorts (up to 1900) and proved to be of limited
use for our analyses. However, for Sweden and the Netherlands, population-based
cohort lifetables were available from 1751 and 1850 until 2018 respectively61–64.
These lifetables contained, for each birth year and sex, an estimate of the hazard of
dying between ages x and x + n (hx) based on yearly intervals (n = 1) up to 99 years
of age. Conditional cumulative hazards (Hx) and survival probabilities (Sx) were
derived using these hazards. In turn, we could determine the sex and birth year
specific survival percentile for each person in our study. Swedish cohort lifetables
date back furthest of all available lifetables and were shown to be consistent with
the lifetables of multiple industrialized societies65. In addition, we ensured that the
survival percentiles were calculated in the same way for the UPDB and LINKS to
make a fair comparison between the survival percentiles. Hence, the Swedish
cohort lifetables were used for both datasets and for the LINKS data the Dutch
lifetables were used as a sensitivity analysis. Supplementary Figure 10 shows the
ages at death corresponding to the top 10%, 5%, and 1% survivors for the UPDB
and LINKS. This figure can be used to map the percentiles, which are based on
percentile–age pairings from the Swedish lifetables, to absolute ages. For example: a
top 10% female in 1750 matched an age of 76 years whereas this was 74 years for
males. In 1850, a top 10% female and male matched an age of 83 years and 81
years, respectively.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.166.
We reported 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and considered p-values statistically
significant at the 5% level (α = 0.05).
IP survival at increasing survival percentiles of relatives. Analysis 1: To
determine if (1) the association between the survival (measured as age at death) of
IPs and the survival percentiles of their parents and siblings increased with
increasing survival percentiles, and (2) a larger level of family aggregation, in terms
of numbers of parents and siblings, was more evident at extreme survival per-
centiles, we investigated the association between IP survival and the number of
parents and siblings reaching increasingly more extreme survival percentiles. We
sequentially identified the number of parents and siblings belonging to the top x
(x = 1, 2, 3, …, 60) percentiles of their birth cohorts (from here: percentiles) and
we analyzed their association with the survival of the IPs for each subsequent
survival percentile using a Cox proportional hazard model:
λ tij
� �
¼ λ0 tij
� �
exp βZij þ γXij
�
�
ð1Þ
where tij is the age at death for IP j in family i. λ0(tij) refers to the baseline hazard,
which is left unspecified in a Cox-type model. β is the vector of regression coef-
ficients for the main effects of interest (Z) which correspond to (1) the number of
parents belonging to the top x percentile, (2) and the number of siblings belonging
to the top x percentile. γ is a vector of regression coefficients for the effects of
covariates and possible confounders (X) which are IPs’ religion (UPDB only),
sibship size, birth cohort, sex, socio-economic status, mother’s age at birth, birth
order, birth intervals, and twin birth.
Identifying a survival threshold that demarcates longevity. Analysis 2: The
previous analysis, based on the cumulative effects, does not allow us to identify a
specific threshold to define longevity, since the top x percentiles were not mutually
exclusive, i.e., if a person belonged to the top 1% survivors, this person also
belonged to the groups of top 5% and top 10% survivors. To determine the survival
percentile threshold that drove the cumulative top x percentile effects described in
the previous section, we grouped IPs according to the survival of their parents and
siblings for two separate analysis. More specifically, we constructed mutually
exclusive groups of IPs based on having at least one parent or sibling belonging to
group g (g = 1, 2, 3, …, 6): group 1 = [≥0th & ≤1th percentile], group 2 = [≥1th &
≤5th percentile], group 3 = [≥5th & ≤10th percentile], group 4 = [≥10th & ≤15th
percentile], group 5 = [≥15th & ≤20th percentile], group 6 = [≥20th & ≤100th
percentile]. Group membership was defined by the most long-lived parent or
sibling of the IP. Using Cox proportional hazards models (see expression (1)), we
compared the effects of all groups to reference group 6, corresponding to IPs with
all parents or siblings belonging to the 20th or less extreme survival percentile and
multiple combinations of defining group 6 were tested. Here, the β is the vector of
regression coefficients for the main effects of interest (Z) which correspond to (1)
the IPs who were divided into mutually exclusive groups by their parental mortality
and (2) the IPs who were independently grouped by their sibling mortality. Other
parts of the expression are the same as noted in expression (1).
Top 10% relatives and covariates in an integrated design. Analysis 3: Based on
the analyses expressed in the previous section, we chose the top 10% survivors for
specific follow-up analyses. Based on the results presented in the cumulative and
mutually exclusive group analyses, we focused on the top 10% surviving family
members because the mutually exclusive group analysis (analysis 2) indicated
longevity effects for siblings beyond the top 10% and 15% for siblings and parents,
respectively. Using the top 10% is consistent between the two groups and is a
conservative choice. Furthermore, the cumulative analysis (analysis 1) indicated
that the top 10% was a good trade-off between effect size and group size (power)
within and between the UPDB and LINKS. Hence, we focused on top 10% parents
and siblings in an integrated design to investigate the association between IP
survival and the number of parents and siblings belonging to the top 10%. We
subsequently investigated the association between the number of top 10% siblings
and IP survival for IPs without top 10% parents, using Cox regression (see
expression (1)). Here the β is the vector of regression coefficients for the main
effects of interest (Z) which correspond to (1) the number of parents and siblings
belonging to the top 10% and (2) the number of siblings belonging to the top 10%
for IPs without top 10% parents. Other parts of the expression are the same as
noted in expression (1).
In all Cox regression analyses, based on expression (1), we accounted for the
fact that IPs were selected to have a spouse and at least one child (left truncation)
by using an IP specific age at entry in the study based on the IP’s age at first child or
the age at marriage, whichever was later. A similar approach was followed for the
spouses of the IPs and no adjustment for left truncation was necessary for the
children of the IPs, since they were not selected in any way. Moreover, we
accounted for right censoring in all relatives of the IPs. We furthermore adjusted
for religion (UPDB only), sibship size, birth cohort, sex, socio-economic status,
mother’s age at birth, birth order, birth intervals, and twin birth since these are
known to influence human survival1. Socio-economic status was constructed
according to the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) occupational
coding scheme of 1950 (OCC1950)67. Importantly, for the sibling contribution to
the cumulative percentile analysis (analysis 1), the sibling contribution to the top
10% analyses (analysis 3), and in all mutually exclusive group analyses (analysis 3),
we used analytical weights when fitting the Cox models to avoid family size
confounding. Adjustment was not necessary for the number of parents because this
number is two by definition. However, sibship sizes vary. For example, a
hypothetical IP with 4 siblings belonging to percentiles 1, 6, 8, and 30 will
contribute with a weight w = 3/4 in the first analysis, based on the cumulative
percentiles, when considering the top 10%. This same IP, when considering the top
5% will contribute with less weight, namely w = 1/4. In this way, each person
contributed the same to the overall analysis across all percentiles. In the second
analysis based on mutually exclusive groups, this same hypothetical IP would be
assigned to g1, and will contribute to the analysis with a weight w = 1/4. In analysis
3, based on the top 10%, the IP will contribute with a weight of w = 3/4. In this
way, we avoid a potential advantage of larger families to be represented in more
extreme groups. Finally, we checked the proportional hazards and linearity
assumptions in all fitted Cox models. We did not find evidence that model
assumptions were violated for the main effects (parent/sibling and IP/children of
IPs associations). The proportional hazards assumption was violated for some
covariates. In such a case, stratification was applied for that covariate and this was
mentioned in the legend of the table/figure.
Verification of the results in a subsequent generation. Analysis 4: To verify our
results regarding the top 10% parents and siblings (analysis 3) in a subsequent
generation (children, F3), we investigated whether children of top 10% IPs had a
survival advantage compared to children of non-longevous IPs and whether this
effect is stronger if the spouse of the IP also belonged to the top 10%. We further
investigated familial clustering of longevity by studying the number of top 10%
aunts and uncles of the children of IPs. A Cox-type random effect model was used:
λ tij
� �
¼ uiλ0 tij
� �
exp βZij þ γXij
�
�
ð2Þ
where tij is the age at death or the age at last follow-up for child j in family i, λ0(tij)
refers to the baseline hazard, which is left unspecified, β is a vector of regression
coefficients for the main effects of interest (Z) which correspond to (1) having a
parent top 10% survivor in a first analysis and (2) the effect of the number of
uncles/aunts (F2) top 10% in a second analysis. u > 0 refers to an unobserved
random effect (frailty) shared by F3 children of a given IP. This unobserved het-
erogeneity shared within sibships was assumed to follow a log-normal distribution.
γ contains the effect of person-specific covariates X, similar to those included in the
previous analyses.
Survival of spouses by the longevity of the index persons. Analysis 5: To
investigate the survival of spouses, we applied a group approach, similar to that
used above, and analyzed the groups with Cox regression. We grouped the spouses
by the survival of the IPs creating 6 different groups g (g = 1, 2, 3, …, 6): group 1 =
[≥0th & ≤ 1th percentile], group 2 = [≥1th & ≤ 5th percentile], group 3 = [≥5th &
≤10th percentile], group 4 = [≥10th & ≤15th percentile], group 5 = [≥15th & ≤
20th percentile], group 6 = [≥20th & ≤100th percentile]. We compared the groups
in two steps: (1) group 6 was the reference category and (2) comparing all groups
with each other (post-hoc), applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing:
λ tij
� �
¼ λ0 tij
� �
exp βZij

ð3Þ
where tij is the age at death or the age at last follow-up for spouse j in family i.
