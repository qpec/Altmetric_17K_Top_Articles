ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To provide an early risk assessment of extending 
screening intervals beyond five years for a human 
papillomavirus (HPV) based cervical screening 
programme in the Netherlands.
Design
14 year follow-up of a population based randomised 
cohort from the POBASCAM randomised trial. 
setting
Organised cervical screening in the Netherlands, 
based on a programme of three screening rounds 
(each round done every five years).
PartiCiPants
43 339 women aged 29-61 years with a negative HPV 
and/or negative cytology test participating in the 
POBASCAM trial. 
interventiOns
Women randomly assigned to HPV and cytology 
co-testing (intervention) or cytology testing only 
(control), and managed accordingly.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Cumulative incidence of cervical cancer and cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse 
(CIN3+). Associations with age were expressed as 
incidence rate ratios. In HPV positive women, 
reductions in CIN3+ incidence after negative cytology, 
HPV type 16/18 genotyping, and/or repeat cytology 
were estimated.
results
The cumulative incidence of cervical cancer (0.09%) 
and CIN3+ (0.56%) among HPV negative women in the 
intervention group after three rounds of screening 
were similar to the cumulative among women with 
negative cytology in the control group after two rounds 
(0.09% and 0.69%, respectively). Cervical cancer and 
CIN3+ risk ratios were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 
0.41 to 2.31, P=0.95) and 0.82 (0.62 to 1.09, P=0.17), 
respectively. CIN3+ incidence was 72.2% (95% 
confidence interval 61.6% to 79.9%, P<0.001) lower 
among HPV negative women aged at least 40 years 
than among younger women. No significant 
association between cervical cancer incidence and age 
could be demonstrated. CIN3+ incidence among HPV 
positive women with negative cytology, HPV 16/18 
genotyping, and/or repeat cytology was 10.4 (95% 
confidence interval 5.9 to 18.4) times higher than 
among HPV negative women.
COnClusiOns
Long term incidences of cervical cancer and CIN3+ 
were low among HPV negative women in this study 
cohort, and supports an extension of the cervical 
screening interval beyond five years for women aged 
40 years and older. HPV positive women with 
subsequent negative cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping, 
and/or repeat cytology have at least a fivefold higher 
risk of CIN3+ than HPV negative women, indicating 
that HPV based programmes with long intervals (>five 
years) should be implemented with risk stratification.

Introduction 
Randomised controlled clinical trials have shown that 
screening for high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) 
leads to earlier detection of cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia (CIN) grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) than cytology,1-4 
 
and provides better protection against cervical 
 
cancer.5-10  Primary HPV testing shows positive results 
more often than primary cytology testing in the general 
screening population, and subsequent triage testing of 
HPV positive women (by use of cytology and of geno-
typing of HPV subtypes 16 and 18) has been recom-
mended to avoid over-referral to colposcopy and 
overuse of biopsies.8 11-15  The screening programme 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Randomised controlled trials have shown that cervical screening with primary 
human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or combined HPV and cytology testing leads to 
earlier detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 than cytology 
screening and provides a better protection against cervical cancer
Evidence on the safety of screening intervals beyond five years is limited
For HPV negative women aged 40 years and older in the Netherlands, screening 
intervals in the HPV based screening programme will be increased from five years to 
10 years in 2017 
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Cumulative incidence of cervical cancer and CIN3+ among HPV negative women 
after three screening rounds at five year intervals was similar to the corresponding 
cumulative incidence among cytology negative women after two screening rounds
HPV based programmes with long screening intervals (at least five years) should be 
implemented with risk stratification, because HPV positive women with subsequent 
negative cytology, genotyping for HPV 16/18 subtypes, and/or repeat cytology have 
at least a fivefold higher risk of CIN3+ than HPV negative women
Age dependent screening intervals are supported by CIN3+ risk estimates but data 
on cervical cancer risk are inconclusive

could be further improved by reducing the number of 
screening rounds. Separately defined screening inter-
vals have been suggested for women who are HPV neg-
ative and women initially HPV positive with negative 
triage tests, because they have substantially different 
risks of CIN3+.1 
16-18 However, stratification of screened 
women on the basis of their HPV (DNA) test result will 
add to the complexity of the programme and should be 
supported by evidence from longitudinal studies.
Several countries have decided or recommended to 
implement HPV screening as the primary screening test 
(Australia, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, 
and the UK) or in combination with cytology (USA). In 
those countries screening women every two to three 
years, the interval will be extended to five or seven 
years. In the Netherlands, the screening interval for 
HPV negative women aged 40 years or more will be 
extended from five to 10 years; this extension is based 
on predictions from cost effectiveness models.19 
20  How-
ever, there remains a concern about an increase in the 
number of interval cancers;21 hence, policy decisions 
should also be supported by estimated incidence of 
long term cervical cancer and precancer (CIN3+ risk) 
when available.
We assessed 14 year risks of histologically confirmed 
cervicalcancer and CIN3+ in women aged 29 years and 
older who participated in the POBASCAM (population 
based screening study Amsterdam) randomised con-
trolled trial.5 A follow-up of 14 years comprises three 
screens: at baseline, and after five and 10 years. Women 
were randomly assigned to receive both HPV and cytol-
ogy testing (intervention), or cytology testing only (con-
trol). We aimed to compare cervicalcancer and CIN3+ 
incidence among HPV negative women in the interven-
tion group and cytology negative women in the control 
group, and to evaluate the safety of extending the 
screening interval beyond five years in women who are 
HPV negative and in women who are HPV positive and 
triage negative.
Methods
study population
The POBASCAM study design has been published 
 
previously.1 
5 
15 
22  In summary, women aged between 29 
and 61 years were invited to participate in cervical 
screening from January 1999 to September 2002. They 
were randomised either to the intervention group 
(cytology and HPV co-testing) or the control group 
(cytology with blinded HPV testing). Of 44 938 women 
enrolled, 22 420 were randomised to the intervention 
group and 22 518 to the control group (fig 1).
In the intervention group, women who had negative 
results for both HPV and cytology co-testing (that is, 
double negative) were referred to routine screening 
every five years. Women with moderate dyskaryosis or 
worse cytology (comparable to cytology worse than 
atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance 
or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) were 
directly referred for colposcopy. HPV positive women 
with negative cytology and women with borderline or 
mild dyskaryosis cytology (comparable to atypical 
squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-
grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) were advised 
to repeat both HPV and cytology testing at six and 18 
months. These women were referred for colposcopy if 
they were HPV positive or if their cytology result showed 
moderate dyskaryosis or worse.
In the control group, women with negative cytology 
were referred to routine screening and women with 
moderate dyskaryosis or worse were immediately 
referred for colposcopy. Women with borderline or mild 
dyskaryosis cytology were advised to repeat cytology at 
six and 18 months, and were referred to colposcopy if 
their repeat cytology result showed borderline dyskary-
osis or worse.
At the second screening round at five years, partici-
pants in both study groups were managed according to 
the protocol of the intervention group. At the third 
screening round at 10 years, participants in both study 
groups were managed according to the protocol of the 
control group.
A conventional cervical smear test was prepared on a 
glass slide after which the brush was placed in a vial for 
HPV testing (general primer 5+/6+ polymerase chain 
reaction enzyme immunoassay).22 
23  Cytology and HPV 
testing were performed without knowledge of the other 
test result. HPV positive samples were genotyped by a 
previously published reverse line blot assay.24
Study participants of the POBASCAM trial were 
enrolled by their general practitioner when attending 
the nationwide screening programme, and provided 
written informed consent. The general practitioners 
were invited to attend postgraduate medical education 
courses to best inform the study participants.
Histology
We tracked histological follow-up data through the 
nationwide network and registry of histopathology and 
cytopathology (PALGA).25  Histology was examined 
locally and classified as no dysplasia; CIN grades 1, 2, or 
3; or invasive cervical cancer according to international 
criteria.26 We included adenocarcinoma in situ in the 
CIN3 group. Treatment by loop electrosurgical excision 
procedure was recommended after CIN2 or CIN3, 
whereas cervical cancer was treated depending on can-
cer stage and according to national guidelines.
statistical analysis
We included women from the intervention and control 
group with a negative HPV test or negative cytology. Fol-
low-up data were collected until July 2013, at which 
point all women had had the opportunity of three 
rounds of five year screening. Events occurring after 14 
years were excluded because they are likely to be 
detected at the fourth screen after baseline. The censor-
ing date was brought forward to the date when an inter-
rupting event had occurred (eg, CIN2+ excision or 
uterus extirpation). If no screening test results had been 
reported at the third screen, the censoring date was 
brought forward to nine years after the study entry date. 
If no screening test results had been reported at the sec-
ond or the third screen, the censoring date was brought

forward to four years. We did statistical analyses in 
SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20.0 and Stata Sta-
tistical Software release 11.
We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the 
cumulative incidence of cervical cancer and CIN3+. 
Separate estimates were reported for HPV and cytology 
groups combined, from the intervention and control 
group. Cytology was labelled positive if the result was 
borderline dyskaryosis or worse (that is, atypical squa-
mous cells of undetermined significance or low grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse), and 
labelled negative otherwise. Cervical cancer and CIN3+ 
incidence was also reported. We evaluated subgroup 
differences between cumulative incidence curves by 
log-rank testing and differences between incidences 
and between cumulative incidences at specific fol-
low-up times by Wald testing. We constructed 95% con-
fidence intervals using the normal approximation to the 
distribution of the logarithm of the incidence.
To determine the level of reassurance from a negative 
test result, we compared the cumulative incidences of 
cervical cancer and CIN3+ among HPV negative and 
double negative women from the intervention group 
with those among cytology negative women from the 
control group. Furthermore, because the new HPV 
based screening programme in the Netherlands 
involves an extension of the screening interval for 
women aged 40 years and older only, we studied the 
effect of age (≥40 v <40 years) on cervical cancer and 
CIN3+ incidence among HPV negative and double neg-
ative women. Because age specific incidence of cervical 
cancer and CIN3+ was similar in intervention and con-
trol groups (log rank test for the endpoints cancer and 
CIN3+, P>0.2), they were pooled over the two study 
groups.
Finally, in the intervention group, we compared the 
incidences of cervical cancer and CIN3+ among women 
with a negative HPV test with those among women with 
a HPV positive test and negative triage testing. We con-
structed four different triage algorithms by combining 
results for cytology at baseline, HPV 16/18 genotyping 
at baseline, and repeat cytology at six months. These

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community. As 
described in the study protocol, women in the interven-
tion group were informed about their HPV and cytology 
results. Women in the control group were only informed 
about their cytology results (regular screening).22
Results
The study included 43 339 women (fig 1). Of 21 623 
women in the intervention group, 20 490 had double 
negative test results, 764 had negative cytology with a 
positive HPV result, and 369 had positive cytology with 
a negative HPV result. The control group included 21 716 
women, of whom 20 533 had double negative test 
results, 814 had negative cytology with a positive HPV 
result, and 369 had positive cytology with a negative 
HPV result. The mean age was 42.8 years (range 29-61) 
in both study groups. Among women who were eligible 
for at least two screening rounds (based on their age), 
non-attendance in both the second and third screen 
after enrolment was 9.3% (1817/19 622) in the interven-
tion group and 9.7% (1916/19 772) in the control group. 
Among women who participated at the second screen 
and were eligible for the third screen, non-attendance 
was 15.7% (2450/15 572) in the intervention group and 
15.5% (2416/15 579) in the control group.
During 14 years of follow-up, 149 CIN2, 152 CIN3 
(including five adenocarcinomas in situ), eight squa-
mous cell carcinomas, and six adenocarcinomas were 
detected in the intervention group (fig 1 ). In the control 
group, 126 CIN2, 169 CIN3 (including five adenocarcino-
mas in situ), 17 squamous cell carcinomas, and 10 ade-
nocarcinomas were detected. Table 1 shows incidence 
of cervical cancer and CIN3+ for the intervention and 
control groups, according to women with a negative 
cytology, negative HPV test result, or both at 14 year fol-
low-up. Among women with negative cytology and a 
positive HPV test, the cancer incidence was signifi-
cantly lower in the intervention group than the control 
group (rate ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 
0.87, P=0.02). For the other cytology and HPV test 
groups, cancer incidence did not differ significantly 
between intervention and control group. CIN3+ 
 
incidence did not show a significant difference between 
the intervention and control group in any of the test 
groups.
Figure 2 shows cumulative incidence of cervical can-
cer and CIN3+ after two and three screens (correspond-
ing to nine and 14 years after baseline, respectively). 
After the second and third screening round, cumulative 
cervical cancer incidence was 0.03% (95% confidence 
interval 0.01% to 0.06%) and 0.09% (0.04% to 0.18%) 
among HPV negative women from the intervention 
group, respectively. Corresponding values for the sec-
ond and third rounds were 0.01% (95% confidence 
interval0.00% to 0.05%) and 0.07% (0.03% to 0.17%) 
among double negative women from the intervention 
group, and 0.09% (0.05% to 0.14%) and 0.19% (0.12% to 
0.28%) among cytology negative women from the con-
trol group. 
After the second and third screening rounds, cumula-
tive CIN3+ incidence was 0.31% (95% confidence inter-
val 0.24% to 0.41%) and 0.56% (0.45% to 0.70%) among 
HPV negative women from the intervention group, 
respectively. Corresponding values for the second and 
third rounds were 0.27% (95% confidence interval 
0.20% to 0.36%) and 0.52% (0.41% to 0.66%) among 
double negative women from the intervention group, 
and 0.69% (0.58% to 0.82%) and 1.20% (1.01% to 
1.37%), among cytology negative women from the con-
trol group. 
After the third screening round, cervical cancer inci-
dence among HPV negative and double negative 
women from the intervention group were similar to the 
cervical cancer incidence among cytology negative 
women from the control group after the second round 
(risk ratio 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 2.31), 
P=0.95; 0.83 (0.32 to 2.15), P=0.69). This indicated that a 
negative HPV test provides longer reassurance against 
cervical cancer than negative cytology. After three

rounds of screening, CIN3+ incidence among HPV neg-
ative and double negative women from the intervention 
group was slightly lower than CIN3+ incidence among 
cytology negative women from the control group after 
the second round (risk ratio 0.82 (0.62 to 1.09), P=0.17; 
0.76 (0.57 to 1.03), P=0.07).
Among women with double negative test results 
pooled over the intervention and control groups, cervi-
cal cancer incidence was 64.2% (95% confidence inter-
val −37
.6% to 332%) higher in women aged at least 40 
years than in younger women, although this increase 
was not significant (P=0.32). The corresponding inci-
dence of CIN3+ was 72.1% (60.5% to 80.4%) lower in 
women aged at least 40 years than in younger women 
(P<0.001). Similarly, among HPV negative women, cer-
vical cancer incidence was 62.0% (−33.9% to 297%, 
P=0.29) higher in women aged at least 40 years than in 
younger women; CIN3+ incidence was 72.2% (61.6% to 
79.9%, P<0.001) lower.
In the intervention group, cervical cancer incidence 
among HPV positive women with negative cytology tri-
age was 11.9 (95% confidence interval3.7 to 38.1; 
P<0.001) times higher than among HPV negative 
women. When HPV 16/18 genotyping or repeat cytology 
was added as a triage test, only one cancer case was 
observed. 
Cumulative CIN3+ incidence among HPV positive, 
triage negative women were substantially higher than 
among HPV negative women (P<0.001; fig 3). The fold 
increases in CIN3+ incidence, relative to the CIN3+ inci-
dence after a negative HPV test, were 29.1 (95% confi-
dence interval21.5 to 39.5) after a positive HPV and 
negative cytology test; 18.5 (12.5 to 27
.3) after a positive 
HPV test and negative baseline and repeat cytology 
tests; 15.5 (10.2 to 23.5) after a positive HPV test and neg-
ative genotyping HPV 16/18 test; and 10.4 (5.9 to 18.4) 
after a positive HPV test, negative genotyping HPV 16/18 
test, and negative baseline and repeat cytology tests.
discussion
Principal findings
This study reports on 14 year follow-up data of a large 
population based screening cohort from the Dutch 
POBASCAM trial, with a five year screening interval, in 
which participants were managed on the basis of both 
cytology and HPV test results. Our findings on the long 
term protective effect of a HPV negative test are consis-
tent with previously reported data.4-6 8-10 16-18 27 28 
 
Together, these publications indicate that HPV based 
screening provides significantly better protection 
against CIN3 than cytology based screening. Further-
more, compared with primary HPV testing, the value of 
primary HPV and cytology co-testing is limited. Our 
data also provide a long term confirmation of the pro-
tective effect against invasive cervical carcinomas, as 
previously described by Ronco and colleagues.8
strengths and limitations of study
The major strengths of the current study are its large 
size, long follow-up, and wide age range of participants 
(29-61 years). The study was nested within a population 
based screening programme, indicating that results 
should be scalable to the country level. 
A limitation to our study was that the presented inci-
dence estimates of cervical cancer and CIN3+ were 
tracked through the nationwide histopathology and

cytopathology registry PALGA, which does not contain 
information on gynaecological procedures. Therefore, we 
were not able to assess how many cases were missed 
because women did not comply with the colposcopy 
advice. 
The histological diagnoses were performed by local 
pathologists, which could have led to misclassification, 
resulting in a dilution of true differences between study 
groups. However, in earlier publications, we showed 
that interobserver reliability of CIN3+ was very high 
(absolute agreement 0.97).5 
22 The absolute cumulative 
CIN3 incidences presented in our study might also be 
influenced by the screening protocol, because the third 
screen after study entry uses cytology only, and thus 
women with newly developed CIN3 could have been 
missed. 
Another limitation related to the time of cancer diag-
nosis. In order to compare cervical cancer risk after a 
negative HPV test in the intervention group at the third 
screening round with the risk after a negative cytology 
test in the control group at the second round, we 
included all cancers detected up to 14 and nine years 
after enrolment, respectively. These follow-up times are 
greater than the targeted screening times at 10 and five 
years, respectively, because of variation in the month of 
invitation, variation in the time between invitation and 
screening appointment, and conservative management 
of positive screening results. Regarding the manage-
ment of positive screening results, only women with 
moderate or severe dyskaryosis cytology were immedi-
ately referred for colposcopy. Other women are rein-
vited for a cervical smear after six and 18 months. The 
adopted approach implicitly assumes that cervical 
 
cancers are present at the beginning of the screening 
round, but that some are detected with delay. However, 
a proportion of these cancers could have progressed 
during the screening round. To evaluate whether this 
altered our conclusions, we compared the cervical can-
cer risk after a negative HPV test in the intervention 
group at 10.5 years after baseline with the correspond-
ing risk after a negative cytology test in the control 
group at 5.5 years after baseline. The estimates were 
0.05% for both subgroups with a risk ratio of 0.94 (95% 
confidence interval 0.37 to 2.43, P=0.91), and are in 
accordance with our findings.
Comparison with other studies
Several other studies have also recommended extend-
ing the interval after a negative HPV test. Recently, Elf-
ström and colleagues18  reported on the potential of 
extending the screening interval with primary HPV 
based screening and recommended, based on CIN3+ 
risks, an extension of three to five years for Sweden. A 
similar analysis was provided after a six year follow-up 
of the ARTISTIC screening trial in the UK, which sup-
ported an extension of the interval from three to six 
years after a negative HPV test.27  Ronco and colleagues8 
 
pooled data from four screening trials and recom-
mended an extension of the screening interval to five 
years after negative HPV testing, replacing a cytological 
screening programme done every three years. In the 
USA, Katki and colleagues17 recommended extending a 
screening interval from one year after negative cytology 
to three years after a negative HPV test and up to five 
years after a negative co-test. Both studies based their 
recommendations on estimated cancer risks. To sum-
marise, recommendations are consistent in the differ-
ent studies. Extensions to 10 years (as done in our 
analysis) have not yet been studied, because other 
countries used cytological based screening intervals of 
one to three years as a benchmark in their analyses.
Another conclusion that can be drawn from our data 
is that a long interval of 10 years is supported for only 
HPV negative women and not for HPV positive, triage 
negative women. The risks of cervical cancer and CIN3+ 
among HPV positive, triage negative women were at 
least five times higher than those among HPV negative 
women for all four triage strategies. Triaging distin-
guishes HPV positive women with and without underly-
ing CIN3+,13 
15  but apparently does not offer additional 
reassurance against future CIN3 or cervical cancer over 
a longer period of follow-up. Another Dutch screening 
study, in which women were followed for five years, 
reached a similar conclusion.29  In a US study evaluating 
the value of co-testing done every three years to identify 
women at high risk of CIN3+, researchers also con-
cluded that HPV positive women with negative cytology 
accrued a substantial risk of CIN3+ over five years, and 
thus needed follow-up.17
Conclusions and policy implications
The current cytological based screening in the Nether-
lands has a five year interval that provides a cumulative 
five year risk of CIN3+ after a negative screen below 
1%.30  A screening interval of 10 years for HPV negative 
women aged at least 40 years will be incorporated in 
the new, primary, HPV based screening programme that 
will start in 2017
.21 Our data indicate that good safety for 
both cervical cancer and CIN3+ risk is provided by 
extending the interval from five to 10 years, because the 
risks after three screening rounds after a negative HPV 
test are similar to the risks after two rounds after nega-
tive cytology. 
In the new HPV based screening programme in the 
Netherlands, the screening interval will only be 
extended among women aged at least 40 years. This age 
specific recommendation is partly supported by our 
data—the CIN3+ risk in women aged at least 40 years 
was estimated to be 72% lower than in younger women, 
but cervical cancer risks did not decrease with age. 
Despite our analyses, the risk of an increase in interval 
cancers remains a point of concern. Controlling both 
cervical cancer and CIN3+ risks is reassuring but an 
increase in the cancer risk cannot be ruled out com-
pletely as long as the interval has not actually been 
extended. Therefore, it remains important to closely 
monitor the number of interval cancers observed under 
the new HPV based screening programme.
The use of the HPV test result and age to define the 
year of next screen is a first step towards risk based 
screening. Tailoring screening to individual risks could 
improve screening efficiency and eventually provide

optimal prevention for all women. However, risk 
 
stratification also adds to the complexity of the pro-
gramme, and it could become challenging to maintain 
a high quality screening programme. 
An important prerequisite for a risk based pro-
gramme is the availability of a linked digitalised screen-
ing registry and invitation system. Such a system is not 
yet in place in every country with an organised pro-
gramme. However, linking of screening and invitation 
systems is recommendable,31 since the benefits of risk 
based screening are expected to become even larger in 
the future. Individual cancer risks can then be based on 
information from multiple HPV screening rounds and 
vaccination status, yielding individual risk assessments 
that will strongly deviate from average risks. This will 
offer substantial room for further improvement of 
resource allocation in the healthcare system.
In summary, our results indicate that primary HPV 
screening provides better long term protection against 
cervical cancer than cytology testing. HPV negative 
women have a very low risk of CIN3+ in the long term, 
indicating that extension of the current screening inter-
val in the Netherlands to 10 years seems justifiable. For 
HPV positive, triage negative women, the long term risk 
of CIN3+ was too high to support an extension of the 
screening interval beyond five years for any of the used 
triage strategies.
