Abstract
Objectives Studies based on the Bchallenge hypothesis^ have linked men’s andro-
gens—testosterone and DHEA—to short term mating and antisocial behaviors. Causal
direction at a given stage of the life cycle remains ambiguous. Religion is a major social
institution through which actions violating social norms are controlled. Thus, ties to this
institution may be lower among men with higher androgen levels. The present study
queried these linkages.
Procedures Data were from the 2005–2006 and 2010–2011 waves of the National
Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), a national probability sample of older
U.S. adults. Analysis was through autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (minimum
N = 1071).
Results Higher baseline levels of both testosterone and DHEA prospectively predicted
religious ties, whether measured through attendance at services or network connections
to clergy. Moreover, contrary to arguments of sociocultural modulation of androgens,
the pattern of associations was most consistent with hormonal causation of religious
connections. Results were robust to a range of time invariant and time varying
confounders, including demographics, hormone supplements, and physical health.
Conclusions Findings add to the growing evidence that religiosity may have physio-
logical and not simply psychosocial roots. Implications for hormonal confounding of
previously published religion-deviance linkages, and for neuroendocrine underpinnings
of population-level social and cultural patterns, are discussed.

 Introduction
A large literature links men’s higher androgens—both testosterone and dehydroepian-
drosterone (DHEA)—with stable predispositions toward prolific short-term partnering
(Archer 2006). Associated psychological traits include risk taking and impulsivity, and
are accompanied by a range of Bantisocial^ behaviors. Religion is a major social
institution through which actions and attitudes violating social norms are controlled
(Ellison et al. 1999; Wilcox 2006). As scholars have speculated, if androgens induce
such traits, they might also lower men’s propensity to tie themselves to religious
institutions (Bradshaw and Ellison 2009; Miller and Stark 2002; Stark 2002). No
population-based studies examine these potential effects. Causal direction also remains
unclear: recent social neuroendocrinology research indicates behavioral and relational
modulation of androgen levels, suggesting that men’s religious ties may lower their
androgen levels by controlling their promiscuous partnering and risk taking (Archer
2006; Van Anders et al. 2015).
In turn, religious connections have consistent associations with better physical and
mental health (Bradshaw and Ellison 2010; Buck et al. 2009). This is especially true
among older adults (Krause 2008; Levin and Chatters 2008), indicating the crucial role
of this resource in healthy aging. More broadly, religion is a major social institution,
shaping a broad range of social, political and cultural patterns (Sherkat and Ellison
1999). Thus, its potential androgen associations become important to explore. Yet,
explanations for religious connections are usually posited either at the psychological
(e.g., responses to life transitions) or social (e.g., being raised in a particular social
environment) levels, leaving their physiological roots unexplored (Stark 2002).
The current study filled these gaps by examining linkages of salivary testosterone
and DHEA with religious ties among older men. Specifically, it used data from the first
two waves of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP)—a national
probability sample of older U.S. adults—along with autoregressive cross-lagged
(ARCL) panel models (Curran 2000) to simultaneously address reciprocal influences
of men’s androgens on their religious connections and vice versa. The latter were
indexed by frequency of attendance at religious services as well as network ties to
clergy. Following recent work in causal modeling, between-wave participant attrition
and corresponding selection issues were addressed through inverse-probability-of-
attrition (IPA) weights. Two research questions were examined: (1) do older men’s
testosterone and DHEA levels predict their religious connections? And (2) are these
effects bidirectional?
Androgens, Social Constraints, and Life Trajectories
An older literature conceptualized social factors and prepubertal androgen exposure as
complementary but unrelated antecedents of crime and deviance (Halpern et al. 1994;
Udry 1988). Androgens were seen as purely Binternal^ or biologically-determined
drivers of motivation, contra dominant notions of action shaped by cultural scripts.
This naïve hormonal causation idea was also in keeping with popular conceptions of
biological processes as innate and fixed (Linquist et al. 2011). In turn, social factors
were posited as configurations of constraints and opportunities unrelated to biological
impulse—consistent with notions of social structure as sui generis. Thus, entry into and
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 exit from deviance trajectories in adolescence could be explained by their joint (and
autonomous) channeling effects. Such early influences could then entrain a person in a
negative life pathway.
Recent studies suggest a more complex process. Early androgen exposure indeed
produces permanent changes to brain structures and behaviors (Berenbaum et al. 2011).
Effects on mood, risk taking, and gender-specific dispositions in adolescence are well
established. However, the extent and mechanisms of interplay with socialization are
underexplored (Hines 2011). More importantly, in later life, there is a second way sex
steroids may affect choices and behaviors (Becker et al. 2008; Berenbaum et al. 2011).
Throughout adulthood, circulating androgens produce ongoing alterations to neural
circuitry and social action. Evolutionary explanations are generally rooted in the
Bchallenge hypothesis,^ which proposes that circulating sex hormones—particularly
testosterone—may catalyze an ongoing trade-off between mating and parenting effort.
In other words, rather than stable relationships and parental care, they may be linked to
short-term and promiscuous mating strategies. Behaviors associated with such an
orientation include a range of antisocial activities, all of which can be viewed as putting
shorter-term goals before longer-term ones—as also aggression, dominance, and status
striving (Archer 2006). Thus, multiple studies link elevated testosterone to more current
or lifetime partners (Archer 2006; Van Anders et al. 2007); more casual and sensation-
seeking sex (Dabbs Jr. and Morris 1990); higher generalized aggression (Carré and
Olmstead 2015); an antisocial personality, alcoholism and drug use (Dabbs Jr. 1990); as
well as proneness to reckless driving, frequent change of sex partners, and failure to plan
ahead (Aromaki et al. 1999). Studies increasingly find similar patterns for androgens
other than testosterone, including both DHEA and DHT (dihydrotestosterone)—sug-
gesting a generalizability of connections across specific hormones (Archer 2006).
To the extent they index hormonal causation, these influences may also produce
avoidance of social constraints, a mechanism missing in current Bsocial control^
models. Unlike adolescents, adults make choices about life paths—and the social
inhibitions and opportunities entailed. Rather than being fully exogenous, then, prox-
imal life ecology—such as the structure of one’s social ties—may partly be a product of
hormonally-influenced decisions. Moreover, as noted, studies also indicate an inverse
effect—i.e., Bsocial modulation^ of hormones. Per evolutionary logic, continuously
high androgen levels and their associated behaviors are suboptimal, since they elevate
males’ survival costs (from increased male-male aggression) as well as reproductive
ones (through less involvement in offspring, which are thus less likely to survive and
pass on paternal genes). In monogamous species, such costs are controlled by main-
taining male androgens at lower baseline levels, and making these hormones responsive
to environmental cues (Wingfield et al. 1990). Thus, for instance, testosterone rises
when male-male competition (especially over potential mates) or interaction with
sexually desirable females is imminent. Human mating systems have been described
as involving mild polygamy, together with high paternal care, such that men’s andro-
gens show substantial ecological responsiveness (Archer 2006). Those with more
constrained exposure to arousal-inducing social signals, therefore, may also have lower
androgens. Exposure to a stable and high-quality partnership, and restricted sexual
opportunities, may prospectively lower androgens (Archer 2006; Gettler and Oka
2016). Conversely, social dominance and wielding power may raise them (Van
Anders et al. 2015). In other words, while linkages of circulating androgens with
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 behaviors and proximal ecologies seem clear, causal direction at a given stage of the life
course does not. Overall, findings suggest a dynamic interplay between the two, which
are best conceptualized as mutually determining. Stable spells in the life course, then,
may in part represent (potentially temporary) equilibria in this ongoing biosocial
cascade.
As noted, religion is a major social institution through which counter-normative
actions and predispositions are controlled (Ellison et al., 1999; Wilcox, 2006). In the
United States, religious ties have a substantial impact on beliefs about Bmoral^ issues
such as pornography (Sherkat and Ellison 1997), abortion (Cook et al. 1992), and
homosexuality (Leege and Kellstedt 1993), as well as on crime and delinquency (Kelly
et al. 2015; Stark 1996). Influences on sexual values and actions are particularly strong
and consistent across studies (Regnerus 2007). (Such social control can, of course, vary
across denominations and congregations. More liberal religious communities, for
instance, may well not impose normative proscriptions). Whether due to hormonal
causation or social modulation, then, ties to this social institution may arguably be
lower among those with elevated circulating androgens. Yet, no longitudinal
population-based analyses have examined these linkages. Cross sectional analysis of
NSHAP Wave 1 data, however, does indicate that older conservative Christian men—
who have markedly lower promiscuity and higher relationship quality—also have
lower salivary testosterone and DHEA (Das and Nairn 2014). Another cross-
sectional study, based on nonprobability samples of U.S. and Malaysian college
students, also examined associations of religiosity with a proxy for perinatal (not
circulating) androgen exposure—relative length of the second and fourth fingers
(Ellis et al. 2016). No negative linkages were found.
To fill these gaps, it was conjectured that if men’s androgens are indeed linked to
more counter-normative behaviors, they would also be negatively associated with their
religious ties—whether because men with more such dispositions avoid religious
connections, or because a lack of such ties and consequent behaviors elevate their
androgens.
Method
Data
Data were from the first two waves of the U.S. National Social Life, Health, and Aging
Project (NSHAP), fielded respectively in 2005–2006 and 2010–2011. NSHAP is a
national area probability sample of community dwelling older adults with an
oversampling of African-Americans and Hispanics, designed specifically to query
bio-social patterns in late life. The first wave of NSHAP comprised 3005 participants
born between 1920 and 1947 (aged 57 to 85 at the time of interview), with a response
rate of 75.5%. In the second wave (which had an overall response rate of 76.9%), 2261
of these individuals (including 1083 men) were reinterviewed. The minimum analytic
sample for the current study was comprised of 1071 of these men. In addition to survey
nonresponse, data losses were due to technical difficulties with salivary assays from
which androgens were derived (Gavrilova and Lindau 2009; Kozloski et al. 2014). As
described below, IPA weights were used to adjust for across-wave attrition.
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 Procedure
An in-person questionnaire was administered in either English or Spanish by a field
interviewer in the participant’s home. Most interviewers were experienced personnel
given further training by NORC at the University of Chicago, and remained with the
project throughout the survey period. In addition to self reports, data included
assessments of physical and sensory function, height and weight, as well as
salivary, blood, and vaginal mucosal samples—all collected at the time of
interview by non-medically trained interviewers. Participant consent was obtain-
ed prior to interview. Institutional Review Boards at the Division of the Social
Sciences and NORC at the University of Chicago approved data collection
procedures (O’Muircheartaigh et al. 2014).
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for all variables used in the analyses. For all
self-reports, question wording was identical across waves.
Measures: Religious Connections
Two indicators of ties to religion were included. First, religious attendance was
proxied through an ordinal self-report. The exact question wording was,
BThinking about the past 12 months, about how often have you attended
religious services?^ Responses ranged from 0 (never) to 6 (several times a
week). Next, a dichotomous measure for clergy in network was created from
respondents’ social network data (Cornwell et al. 2008; Ferraro and Kim 2014).
Respondents were asked to enumerate individuals with whom they discussed
important matters—a standard name generator in network studies. This
Bnetwork roster^ allowed up to five people to be named, but respondents were
also asked to indicate if they had more than five such social Balters.^ They
were then probed to identify their relationship with each nominated alter. The variable
was scored 1 if at least one of these was a religious figure such as a rabbi, priest, minister,
or other clergy, and 0 otherwise.
Measures: Salivary Androgens
Testosterone and DHEA were derived from saliva samples taken during the biomeasure
collection portion of the in-home interview (Gavrilova and Lindau 2009; Kozloski et al.
2014). In contrast to blood (serum or plasma), saliva samples contain only the
metabolically active form of circulating androgens, Bfree^ to enter cells of multiple
physiological subsystems. Participants were encouraged not to eat during the interview,
even though eating and dental care are reported to have no effect on the replicability of
steroid levels in saliva (Gröschl et al. 2001). Following previously validated protocols
(Granger et al. 2007), passive drool was used to collect whole unstimulated saliva,
which was then frozen until assay. Salivary enzyme immunoassays were conducted
using commercially available kits. Wave 1 assays were by Salimetrics Laboratories
(State College, PA). In Wave 2, specimens were sent to Dresden LabService GmbH
(Dresden, Germany) for assays using kits identical to those from Wave 1. Due to
extreme right skew, testosterone and DHEA values—originally in pg/mL—were log
transformed for analysis.
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 Measures: Control Variables
Studies suggest population heterogeneity in hormone levels by social location
(ethnicity, class), medication use, health conditions, body composition—as well
as across multiple temporal spans (Van Anders et al. 2014). As explained
below, at least some of these factors may also influence religiosity, and hence
confound associations. Analyses thus adjusted for multiple time varying as well
as time invariant covariates.
First, whether as cohort (generational variations) or as life course stage (more piety
among older people), age can influence religious ties. Corresponding declines in andro-
gens is also reported—although the extent to which this is due to the aging process per se,
as opposed to chronic illness, medication use, or other related factors, remains

 controversial (Kozloski et al. 2014). Accordingly, a participant’s age (in years) was
entered linearly as a continuous variable. This variable was conceptualized as time
invariant (such that only the Wave 1 indicator was included) since it was perfectly
correlated with time. Ethnicity (especially black-white) differentials have similarly been
reported for religious ties as well as for androgens (Nyante et al. 2012). Hence, this factor
was indexed through a (time invariant) set of dummy variables for Black, Hispanic, and
Other, with non-Hispanic White as the reference. Time-varying covariates (measured at
each wave) included, first, a standardized summary index for a participant’s socioeco-
nomic status (SES)—comprised of a participant’s self reported household wealth, house-
hold income, educational attainment, perceived household income relative to acquain-
tances and to American families in general. Cronbach’s alpha at Wave 1 was 0.75 and at
Wave 2 was 0.76. As with age and ethnicity, studies report linkages of this factor with both
religiosity (Schieman 2010) and androgens (Hall et al. 2008). Next, a dichotomous
measure indicated wave-specific consumption of any sex hormone supplements—includ-
ed to net out any pharmacological influences on endogenous androgens. NSHAP collect-
ed a complete log of currently used medications during the in-home interview, by direct
observation using a computer-based log. The Multum® drug database, based on the
hierarchical classifications of the American Hospital Formulary Service, was used for
coding drug names (Qato et al. 2009). Diurnal variation in younger men’s androgens is
well established, although those older may experience a flatter decrease over the day (Van
Anders et al. 2014). Thus, a continuous control was included for saliva collection time (in
hourly units, on a 24-h scale). While studies also indicate seasonal variations, appropriate
indicators were lacking in NSHAP. Next, given the known associations of androgens with
visceral obesity, analyses also adjusted for waist size (in inches) (Kozloski et al. 2014). In
turn, disengagement from religious and other social ties may be induced by health
problems—especially frailty. Accordingly, two physical health controls were includ-
ed—starting with one’s total number of diagnosed conditions. Participants were asked
about any lifetime diagnosis of a range of medical conditions, of which nine—heart
attack, arthritis, ulcers, asthma, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and enlarged
prostate—were combined into a single score based on the Charlson comorbidity index
(Williams et al. 2009). Finally, poor functional health was indexed by a continuous
additive score for impaired Activities of Daily Living (Katz 1983).
Statistical Analyses
Four models were run, respectively examining linkages of testosterone and DHEAwith
religious attendance and with having a clergy member in one’s personal network.
Analyses were conducted using an ARCL approach (Curran 2000). Thus, cross-
lagged paths were specified to estimate reciprocal influences for all time varying
factors—the four substantively important variables, as well as all time varying covar-
iates. In addition, for each such variable, autoregressive paths examined dependency of
Wave 2 on Wave 1 values. Finally, all Wave 2 measures were regressed on time
invariant covariates. Figure 1 illustrates the posited linkages.
A major analytic issue was selective attrition—i.e., non-reinterview of the Wave 1
participant, whether through mortality or nonresponse, due to factors also influencing
covariates. To take this selection process into account, pooled logistic regression was
used to fit a predictive model for attrition across waves. Covariates included a
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 participant’s demographic and health attributes (age, education, gender, race, self-rated
physical and mental health, and number of health conditions diagnosed over the
lifetime). Based on predicted probabilities from this model, stabilized inverse-
probability-of-attrition (IPA) weights were created (Weuve et al. 2012). Thus, partici-
pants with characteristics associated with a lower probability of continuation were
assigned larger weights, Bcompensating^ for their underrepresentation in the second
wave. Finally, all analyses were weighted by the product of these IPA weights with
Wave 1 population weights that adjusted for the intentional oversampling of Blacks and
Hispanics and incorporated a non-response adjustment based on age and urbanicity
(O’Muircheartaigh et al. 2014). Standard errors were adjusted for sample stratification
(sampling strata independently) and clustering (sampling individuals within each of
100 primary sampling units). Estimation was through a robust weighted least squares
estimator using a diagonal weight matrix.
Results
Tables 2 and 3 show results from cross-lagged analyses. Given the range of estimates,
the focus below is on those conceptually important for pattern inference. Since each
model had a mix of dependent variable types, unstandardized coefficients and standard
errors are presented—for testosterone (OLS), DHEA (OLS), religious attendance
(ordered probit) and clergy in network (probit) respectively. Since probit odds ratios
(ORs) vary by values of independent variables, to facilitate interpretation, ORs from
corresponding logistic and ordinal logit models are also provided. Autoregressive
effects remained substantively identical across models; hence, each is stated once.
Table 2, Model 1: Testosterone and Religious Attendance
Both autoregressive effects in this model were significant—that of Wave 1 on
Wave 2 religious attendance (Coeff. = 0.66, p < 0.01, ordinal logit OR = 3.38),
and that of testosterone across waves (Coeff. = 0.34, p < 0.01). Consistent with
hormonal causation of religious avoidance, the cross-lagged effect of Wave 1
testosterone on Wave 2 religious attendance also reached significance (Coeff. =
−0.28, p < 0.01, ordinal logit OR = 0.69). Contrary to social modulation argu-
ments, however, the same was not true of the cross-lagged effect of Wave 1
religious attendance on Wave 2 testosterone.

 Table 2, Model 2: DHEA and Religious Attendance
As with testosterone, men’s autoregressive effects were significant for DHEA
(Coeff. = 0.11, p < 0.05). Also as in Model 1, Wave 1 DHEA had a cross-
lagged effect on Wave 2 religious attendance (Coeff. = −0.10, p < 0.05, ordinal
logit OR = 0.84). The inverse effect, of Wave 1 religious attendance on Wave 2
DHEA, was not significant.

Findings for ties to clergy were similar to those for religious attendance. The
autoregressive effect for this form of religious affiliation was strong (Coeff. = 1.62,
p < 0.01, logit OR = 21.02), as was the negative cross-lagged effect of Wave 1 testos-
terone on Wave 2 clergy connections (Coeff. = −0.31, p < 0.05, logit OR = 0.51). The
inverse linkage, however, failed to reach significance.

Finally, a series of robustness checks was run, specifying different covariances
between synchronous measures, up to saturation. Results remained substantively iden-
tical across specifications.
Discussion and Conclusion
To recall, it was argued that if men’s higher androgens catalyze prolific short-term and
non-monogamous partnering, impulsivity, and antisocial behaviors, they should be
negatively linked to religious ties—a major social mechanism through which activities
violating social norms are controlled (the Bhormonal causation^ model). Conversely,
since casual direction in androgen-behavior linkages is ambiguous, it may be religious
connections that lower androgen levels (the Bsocial modulation^ conjecture).

Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 Results were consistent with the first speculation. Higher levels of both testosterone
and DHEA at Wave 1 did indeed predict less religious embeddedness at follow up—
whether measured through attendance at services (Table 2) or network ties to clergy
(Table 3). The replication of this finding across all four models served as a rough
sensitivity check, lending confidence to the hormonal causation inference. Moreover,
these associations were robust to a range of time invariant and time varying con-
founders, including demographics, hormone supplements, and physical health. In
contrast, results were uniformly contrary to social modulation arguments. Overall, then,
findings add to the growing evidence that religiosity may have physiological and not
simply psychosocial roots (Bradshaw and Ellison 2009; Stark 2002). More generally,
findings suggest the personal networks and affiliations social scientists conceptualize as
autonomous determinants of life paths may themselves have biological antecedents.
Without systematic exploration of these linkages, life course theory remains incomplete
and potentially inaccurate.
As noted, the literature also connects a lack of religious ties to social deviance of
various forms, a heavily politicized theme (Regnerus 2007). Results above suggest
many of these associations may well be confounded by underlying hormonal levels—a
possibility that urgently needs exploration. Finally, autoregressive effects also indicated
substantial stability in religious connections across the five-year inter-wave period,
suggesting these are at least partly enduring traits rather than transient responses to life
situations. That androgens had a net effect even net of these individual thresholds or
Bset points^ suggests religious affiliation may have both stochastic and stable compo-
nents—with at least the former open to influence by hormones (Schnittker 2008).
There were several limitations. First, due to a lack of good NSHAP indicators,
subjective religious beliefs could not be included. Next, although cross-lagged analysis
is widely used to explore direction of association in longitudinal data, experimental
evidence would lend confidence to the causal role of hormones in the avoidance of
religious ties. Participants were aged 62 to 90 at Wave 2, ages at which not simply
androgen levels but also their linkages with social behaviors may be very different than
among younger populations. Generalizability may be accordingly limited. However,
hormone-religiosity patterns in late life remain understudied—despite having major
implications for healthy aging. For several reasons, analysis was also restricted to men.
In both the human and animal literatures, androgen-sociality linkages are far more
firmly established among males than females (Archer 2006). Recent human studies also
suggest considerable gender variation in such connections (Van Anders et al. 2015).
These differences may apply not simply to the relative strength of associations, but also
to the specific behaviors or ecological factors tied to androgens among women or men.
Evolved functions, social roles, and/or sociocultural experiences related to femininity
and masculinity are all speculated to play a role. Ongoing work is thus examining
potential implications across multiple dimensions of women’s sociality. Next, models
adjusted only for a small range of clearly exogenous factors. Variables like partnership
status, negative behaviors and mental health were not controlled precisely because they
were conceptualized as mediators of androgen-religion linkages, such that their inclu-
sion would have amounted to overadjustment and inappropriate attenuation of esti-
mates. However, potential omitted-variable bias remains a concern. Stronger ties to
family, for instance, could induce stronger religious connections through a spouse’s or
kin’s role in one’s prosocial choices, and simultaneously lower androgen levels.
Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology
 Samples with more waves of biomeasure data will permit inclusion of such controls
without risking either endogeneity or post-treatment bias (Pearl 2009). Next, linkages
may well vary across (be moderated by) categories of indicators that were controlled
(such as ethnicity). As noted, the same is true of religious denominations or congrega-
tions. These patterns could not be examined in the current study due to sample-size
limitations, and difficulties with including interaction terms in cross lagged
analysis. Similarly, while frequency of religious attendance was indexed by a
single interval variable, it is acknowledged that linkages with testosterone and
DHEA may differ qualitatively for those at different levels of this measure.
Next, in the absence of direct indicators, behavioral outcomes had to be crudely
proxied through self-reports—leading to potential bias from systematic patterns
in reporting. IPA weights were designed to adjust for between-wave attrition
(noninterview). However, they could not take into account measure-specific
missingness patterns. Given the newness of the topic, values were not imputed.
Similarly, the five-year lag between waves, while well suited to detecting stable
linkages, may have blinded the analyses to important temporal inflections in
effects as well as intervening processes. Finally, given only two waves of data,
psychobehavioral mediation of hormone-religion links, implicit in the concep-
tual model, could not be examined. Only baseline connections could be
established. More research is therefore needed on precisely why androgens
negatively predict religious connections.
Literature based on the challenge hypothesis has produced a first generation
of studies tying androgens, particularly testosterone, to behavioral and psycho-
logical indicators of a sexualized and Bdeviant^ life trajectory. But these traits
may in turn trigger a Bsecondary^ set of social choices and behaviors with
strong potential influences on healthy aging. Thus, more research is needed on
the role of hormones in structuring late-life trajectories, whether through deci-
sions and attitudes that induce negative health transitions and other Bturning
points^ (Crosnoe and Elder Jr. 2002), or the reduction of social resources that
could otherwise buffer against ill health (Krause 2008). The proposal here is
not to reduce such patterns solely to baseline hormonal differences. In adult-
hood, as the social modulation literature indicates, these levels may themselves
be products of mating and other behaviors. Rather, findings suggest a need for
conceptual models that can accommodate the dynamic interplay of psychosocial
and neuroendocrine factors in shaping the life cycle. More generally, as argued,
religion influences a range of cultural and political patterns at the population
level. Results above indicate the latter may also have hormonal roots, which are
yet to be explored.
