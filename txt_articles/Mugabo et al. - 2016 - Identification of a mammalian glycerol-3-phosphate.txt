Obesity, and the associated disturbed glycerolipid/fatty acid (GL/FA)
cycle, contribute to insulin resistance, islet β-cell failure, and type 2
diabetes. Flux through the GL/FA cycle is regulated by the availabil-
ity of glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) and fatty acyl-CoA. We describe
here a mammalian Gro3P phosphatase (G3PP), which was not known
to exist in mammalian cells, that can directly hydrolyze Gro3P to
glycerol. We identified that mammalian phosphoglycolate phospha-
tase, with an uncertain function, acts in fact as a G3PP. We found
that G3PP, by controlling Gro3P levels, regulates glycolysis and glu-
cose oxidation, cellular redox and ATP production, gluconeogenesis,
glycerolipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation in pancreatic islet
β-cells and hepatocytes, and that glucose stimulated insulin secretion
and the response to metabolic stress, e.g., glucolipotoxicity, in β-cells.
In vivo overexpression of G3PP in rat liver lowers body weight gain
and hepatic glucose production from glycerol and elevates plasma
HDL levels. G3PP is expressed at various levels in different tissues,
and its expression varies according to the nutritional state in some
tissues. As Gro3P lies at the crossroads of glucose, lipid, and energy
metabolism, control of its availability by G3PP adds a key level of
metabolic regulation in mammalian cells, and G3PP offers a potential
target for type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disorders.

T
he glycerolipid/fatty acid (GL/FA) cycle, which is central to
energy homeostasis, balances glucose and lipid metabolism
(1, 2), and generates metabolic signals (3, 4). This cycle is
deregulated in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Under conditions of
fuel surfeit with excessive glucose and free fatty acid (FFA)
supply, a substantial portion of glucose is used in mammalian
cells via formation of glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) and its in-
corporation into GL via GL/FA cycle (4, 5). The cycle consists of
lipogenesis and lipolysis segments and generates intermediates
for the synthesis of various types of complex lipids, but also
signals that control many biological processes, including insulin
secretion and action (3, 6, 7). The proper operation of this cycle
possibly protects β-cells and other cell types from glucolipotox-
icity and metabolic stress (4, 8, 9).
Lipogenesis, i.e., the successive esterification of glycolysis-derived
Gro3P with fatty acyl-CoA (FA-CoA), produces triglyceride (TG),
which can be stored as lipid droplets (10). Lipolysis of TG is
initiated by adipose TG lipase to generate diacylglycerol (DAG),
which is hydrolyzed by hormone sensitive lipase to give rise to
monoacylglycerol (MAG). MAG hydrolysis by classical MAG li-
pase or by α/β-hydrolase domain-6 (ABHD6) to glycerol and FFA
completes the lipolytic segment of the GL/FA cycle (2, 3).
Presently glycerol release from mammalian cells is thought to
occur exclusively from the lipolytic segment of the GL/FA cycle,
and glycerol production is considered to reflect lipolysis flux. We
proposed earlier that, at high glucose concentrations, the release
of glycerol by β-cells, which do not express glycerokinase that
transforms glycerol to Gro3P (4), is a mechanism of “glucolipo-
detoxification,” and that this process is dependent on the lipolysis
segment of GL/FA cycle (3, 4). Indeed, mammalian cells are not
known to harbor a Gro3P phosphatase (G3PP) (11), which could
directly generate glycerol from Gro3P. In an earlier study on
mass isotopomer distribution analysis of glucose labeling from
[13C]glycerol in the liver, Gro3P hydrolysis activity was speculated
but was not directly demonstrated (12). Thus, the fate of Gro3P in
mammalian cells is thought to be its conversion to dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (DHAP) or lysophosphatidate, the first intermediate of
the lipogenic arm of the cycle. However, many microbes (13–15)
and plants (16) harbor a G3PP. We now describe that a previously
known phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) (17) with an uncertain
function in mammalian cells acts as a specific G3PP and plays a
pivotal role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and
signaling, as well as in the response to metabolic stress.
Significance
Glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) lies at the crossroads of glucose,
lipid, and energy metabolism in mammalian cells and is thought
to participate in glycolysis or in gluconeogenesis, lipid synthesis,
and Gro3P electron transfer shuttle to mitochondria. We now
report a previously unidentified pathway of Gro3P metabolism
in mammalian cells with the identification of Gro3P phospha-
tase (G3PP) that can directly hydrolyze Gro3P to glycerol. We
observed that G3PP expression level controls glycolysis, lipogen-
esis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, cellular redox, and mitochon-
drial energy metabolism in β-cells and hepatocytes, as well as
glucose-induced insulin secretion and the response to metabolic
stress in β-cells, and in gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. G3PP is a
previously unknown player in metabolic regulation and signaling
and offers a potential target for cardiometabolic disorders.

 Results and Discussion
Dichotomy in Orlistat Effect on Glycerol and FFA Release in β-Cells.
The discovery of a mammalian G3PP started from the fortuitous
observation of a dichotomy of inhibitory effects of the panlipase
and lipolysis inhibitor orlistat on glycerol and FFA release at
various glucose concentrations from β-cells. Thus, orlistat
inhibited lipolysis at high glucose concentrations in INS832/13
β-cells and in rat islets as evidenced by the reduction in FFA
release; however, the increased release of glycerol in the pres-
ence of elevated glucose concentration was not inhibited (Fig. 1
A and B and Fig. S1 A and B), indicating that not all glucose-
derived glycerol arises from lipolysis. In rat islet cells, at medium
concentration of glucose (10 mM), orlistat showed moderate
inhibition of glycerol release, indicating that, at this glucose
concentration, a small amount of glycerol does arise from li-
polysis. Thus, in β-cells, there must exist an alternate mechanism
for the production of glycerol besides lipolysis. The direct hy-
drolysis of glucose-derived Gro3P by a hypothetical G3PP is a
plausible source of glycerol.
Structural Similarity Between PGP and Bacterial G3PP. A BLAST
analysis of various known G3PP enzymes against mammalian
sequences led to the identification of PGP (17), whose function in
mammalian cells is uncertain and which belongs to the class of
haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-type hydrolases. Recently PGP
was suggested to possess protein tyrosine phosphatase activity
and was called “aspartate-based, ubiquitous, Mg2+-dependent
phosphatase” (AUM) (18). Although the catalytic efficiency of
AUM/PGP toward the generic protein tyrosine phosphatase
substrate p-nitrophenolphosphate was ∼1,000-fold higher than
the activity of the well-established HAD-type protein tyrosine
phosphatase Eya3, its activity was ∼1,000-fold less than that of
classical tyrosine phosphatases like PTP1B, TCPTP, or SHP1,
raising the possibility that PGP/AUM may also dephosphorylate
other low molecular weight substrates/metabolites in addition to
those reported previously (18). An amino acid sequence com-
parison and structural overlay showed high similarity of the
murine PGP/AUM cap with the cap domain of the recently de-
scribed mycobacterial G3PP, Rv1692 (13), in residue orientation
and composition, and suggested that PGP is indeed a bona fide
G3PP (Fig. 1 C and D and Fig. S1C). PGP belongs to the subtype
of cap-domain containing HAD-phosphatases. This domain
features a specificity loop with evolutionarily highly conserved
residues that are required for proper substrate coordination in
the active site of the hydrolase (19, 20). The sequence alignment
of Rv1692 and mPGP revealed conservation of a number of
those amino acid residues that were recently identified to be
important for proper substrate positioning in murine PGP/AUM
(18). There is near-perfect alignment of the cap domains of PGP
and Rv1692 and of the critical leucine residue at positions 204 in
mPGP (18) and 155 in Rv1692, as revealed by structural overlay
(Fig. 1D). A zoom in the substrate binding pocket shows that the
critical and evolutionarily conserved cap domain residues in-
volved in substrate coordination are identical between PGP and
the mycobacterial G3PP, Rv1692 (Fig. S1C).
PGP Acts as a Specific G3PP. Purified recombinant murine PGP,
expressed as described before (18), showed activity with Gro3P,
with a Km of 1.29 mM and kcat of 0.1 s−1 (Fig. 1E). At saturating
substrate concentration, mPGP showed specific activity of ∼100
nmol/min/mg protein with Gro3P, whereas its activity toward other
related substrates such as DHAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate,
3-phosphoglycerate, creatine phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate,
and ribulose-5-phosphate was much lower (Fig. 1F). Activity
with inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and lysophosphatidic acid
was seen only with very high nonphysiological concentrations
of these compounds. The overexpressed human PGP in 293T
cell extracts showed similar Km (∼1.4 mM) for Gro3P as the
purified murine PGP and a Vmax of ∼150 nmol/min/mg protein
(Fig. 1G). Human PGP in whole-cell extracts showed similar
affinity for 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG; ∼1.5 mM) but higher
Vmax (∼500 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating that this enzyme
has higher capacity to hydrolyze 2-PG (Fig. 1G). Under the
same incubation conditions, activity with glucose-6-phosphate
was negligible (Fig. 1G). In INS832/13 rat β-cells, there was a
significant amount of native PGP/G3PP enzyme in terms of Vmax,
which was 47 nmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 1H). High glucose con-
centration stimulated glycerol release in INS832/13 β-cells was re-
duced by RNAi knockdown of native PGP (Fig. 1 I and J and Fig.
S1D), greatly elevated by overexpression of human PGP (Fig. 1 K
and L), and the decrease caused by RNAi knockdown was reversed
by overexpression of hPGP in the same cells (Fig. S1E). Overall, the
data demonstrate that PGP acts as a G3PP in vitro and in intact cells.
G3PP Activity Controls Insulin Secretion and Glucolipotoxicity in
Pancreatic β-Cells. As Gro3P is one of the starting substrates for
the GL/FA cycle that produces lipid signals for glucose-stimu-
lated insulin secretion (GSIS), alteration of Gro3P levels by
G3PP should influence insulin secretion (21). All three different
G3PP-siRNAs reduced G3PP expression effectively (Fig. S1D),
and we selected G3PP-siRNA-1 and control siRNA-1 for rest of
the study. In accordance with this prediction, RNAi knockdown
of native rat G3PP in INS832/13 β-cells elevated GSIS (Fig. 2A),
whereas overexpression of hG3PP reduced GSIS (Fig. 2B)
without affecting basal secretion. Similar results were obtained in
isolated rat islets infected with lentiviral shRNA-G3PP for RNAi
knockdown or adenoviral hG3PP for overexpression (Fig. 2 C
and D). The role of G3PP activity in regulating GSIS was con-
firmed by the observation that overexpression of hG3PP in
INS832/13 cells curtailed the increased GSIS caused by RNAi
knockdown of endogenous G3PP (Fig. S1F).
Chronic elevated glucose exposure of β-cells without or with high
concentrations of exogenous FFA cause glucotoxicity and glucoli-
potoxicity, respectively, as indicated by caspase-3 activity, an index
of apoptosis (22). The mechanism involves enhanced glucose me-
tabolism and esterification of FFA (23), resulting in mitochondrial
dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Reducing G3PP expression in
INS832/13 β-cells, which is likely to elevate the formation of glyc-
erolipid intermediates, caused enhanced glucotoxicity (Fig. 2E),
whereas overexpression of hG3PP led to decreased glucotoxicity
(Fig. 2F). Glucolipotoxicity, which was enhanced by G3PP knock-
down, was curtailed by hG3PP overexpression that also reversed
the toxic effect of G3PP knockdown under glucolipotoxic condition
(Fig. 2G). Thus, changes in G3PP activity in the β-cell modulate
insulin secretion and the response to metabolic stress.
Tissue Distribution and Nutritional Regulation of G3PP. Expression
of G3PP at the mRNA (Fig. S2 A, C, and E) and protein (Fig. S2
B, D, and F) levels is apparently ubiquitous, as it was detected in
all tissues examined; it was found to be particularly high in testis,
followed by heart, skeletal muscle, and islet tissue. Liver, kidney,
intestine, and visceral white adipose tissue showed low expres-
sion, probably because these tissues are engaged in gluconeo-
genesis and/or lipogenesis, both of which require Gro3P supply.
The high expression of G3PP in heart and skeletal muscle pos-
sibly ensures no toxic accumulation of lipids in these fat-burning
tissues (24). The role of this enzyme in testis is not clear.
G3PP expression is regulated by nutritional status. Thus, G3PP
mRNA and protein is inversely changed in white adipose vs.
brown adipose tissue (BAT) under fed and fasted states (Fig. S2 A
and B) and under high-fat diet (HFD) vs. normal diet conditions
(Fig. S2 C and D). These changes may reflect the adaptation for
regulation of nutrient metabolism in adipose tissues. Thus, ele-
vated G3PP in white adipose tissue in fasted state ensures supply
of glycerol into circulation rather than glycerol reincorporation

 into glycerolipids (25) for the purposes of gluconeogenesis in liver
and kidney, whereas the decreased G3PP expression in BAT en-
sures trapping of incoming FFA and glucose into glycerolipids for
future use, as well as for fuel use for thermogenesis during fasting.
Conversely, the decreased expression of G3PP in white adipose
tissue in HFD condition should help in the storage of fat, whereas,
in BAT, such storage is not needed and the elevated G3PP levels
ensure effective burning of fatty acids in BAT mitochondria.
Hence, nutritional control of G3PP exemplifies the importance of
this enzyme in fuel and energy metabolism as its expression is
differentially regulated in different tissues.
G3PP Expression Level Influences Glucose, Lipid, and Energy Metabolism
in β-Cells. Because Gro3P is a central metabolic intermediate
that lies at the crossroads of glucose and lipid metabolism, we
examined whether G3PP also plays a critical role in metabolic
regulation (Fig. 2H). As expected, RNAi knockdown of G3PP
in INS832/13 cells increased the synthesis of 1,2(2,3)-DAG,
1,3-DAG, TG, total phospholipids, lysophosphatidylinositol,

 lysophosphatidate, and lysophosphatidylcholine (Fig. 3A and Fig.
S3A), whereas overexpression led to their decreased synthesis (Fig.
3B and Fig. S3B). Considering that many of these lipids have sig-
naling roles in different cells (3), G3PP is likely to regulate these
signaling pathways. In INS832/13 cells, altered activity of G3PP
had no effect on fatty acid oxidation at low or high glucose con-
centration (Fig. 3C). FFA release from these cells, which is mostly
dependent on lipolysis, was elevated when G3PP was overex-
pressed, indicating that a reduction in Gro3P levels following
G3PP overexpression lowers the reesterification of FFA, leading to
their elevated release from the cells (Fig. 3D). In rat islets, glucose-
stimulated glycerol release was lowered by G3PP knockdown and
increased by G3PP overexpression (Fig. 3E), similar to that noticed
with INS832/13 cells (Fig. 1 J and L).
As Gro3P directly transfers electrons to mitochondria via the
action of mitochondrial Gro3P dehydrogenase, changes in Gro3P
levels during glucose oxidation are expected to influence respira-
tion. Thus, in rat islet cells, reducing G3PP expression led to el-
evated O2 consumption and ATP production (Fig. 3F), whereas
hG3PP overexpression caused opposite changes (Fig. 3G), without
affecting H+ leak in both cases. Similar results were obtained by
using INS832/13 cells (Fig. S3 C and D). Altered G3PP protein
levels were confirmed in rat islet cells after shRNA knockdown
and hG3PP overexpression (Fig. 3 H and I). The increased ATP
levels in β-cells by G3PP knockdown relate to the increased GSIS
seen under these conditions (21). Thus, altered expression of
G3PP in β-cells has a significant impact on glucose, lipid, and
mitochondrial metabolism, and consequently on the response of
these cells for metabolic signal transduction and GSIS.
G3PP Controls Glycolysis, Gluconeogenesis, and Lipid Metabolism in
Hepatocytes. Liver is the major site of gluconeogenesis starting
from amino acids or adipose lipolysis-derived glycerol, and both
pathways involve the formation of Gro3P (Fig. 2H). Thus, in
primary rat hepatocytes, shRNA knockdown of G3PP (Fig. S4A)
led to a great increase in gluconeogenesis from glycerol and from
pyruvate plus lactate (Fig. 4A), whereas overexpression of hG3PP
in these cells (Fig. S4B) completely curtailed gluconeogenesis (Fig. 4F).
Fatty acid oxidation in liver is dependent on the availability of
fatty acyl-CoA substrate, which is controlled by the extent of
esterification by glycerol-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (26). Fatty
acid oxidation was directly related to G3PP expression levels in
rat hepatocytes, and, at high glucose levels, which suppress
β-oxidation, elevated G3PP expression led to enhanced fatty acid
oxidation (Fig. 4 B and G). This is different from the results with
INS832/13 cells and probably reflects the highly lipogenic nature
of liver tissue compared with β-cells. Thus, FFA entering cells
must be esterified before being oxidized following lipolysis of
endogenous lipid stores (27). In hepatocytes as well, glycerol
release at high glucose levels was reduced by G3PP knockdown
and elevated by its overexpression (Fig. 4 C and H).
Knockdown of G3PP in hepatocytes enhanced lactate production
and release, an index of glycolytic flux, as expected, because of
decreased diversion of glucose carbons in the form of glycerol via
G3PP (Fig. 4 D and E). Conversely, overexpression of hG3PP had
the reverse effects, reducing glycolytic flux (Fig. 4 I and J). The
overall increase in glycolytic flux compared with noninfected cells is
a result of viral infection, which is known to accelerate glycolysis (28,
29). Similar to the changes in INS832/13 cells, lipogenesis was af-
fected by altered G3PP expression in rat hepatocytes (Fig. 4 K and
L and Fig. S4 C and D). Formation of cholesterol esters was
markedly decreased by the overexpression of G3PP in liver cells
(Fig. S4D), and this may be a result of reduced availability of fatty
acyl groups because of their enhanced flux through mitochondrial
β-oxidation.
Regulation of Cellular Redox and Energy Production by G3PP. Me-
tabolite measurements using LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectroscopy) in rat hepatocytes revealed a significant
decrease in Gro3P and DHAP following hG3PP overexpression,
whereas G3PP knockdown led to a marked increase in Gro3P at
25 mM glucose (Fig. 5 A and B). We calculated the intracellular
metabolite concentrations assuming average intracellular water
volume to be 2.54 μL/mg protein (30). Intracellular Gro3P con-
centrations in control hepatocytes were 2 mM and 4.5 mM at 5 mM
and 25 mM glucose, respectively, and the corresponding DHAP
concentrations were 0.03 mM and 0.095 mM, respectively. Thus, the
intracellular Gro3P concentration is sufficient for the G3PP to use
this substrate effectively, as it is in the range of its Km value. The
ratio of Gro3P/DHAP increased greatly only when G3PP was
knocked down at 25 mM glucose (Fig. 5C). Lactate levels decreased
and pyruvate levels increased after G3PP overexpression, and
the opposite changes were noted after G3PP knockdown (Fig. 5 D
and E). This is in line with the enzymatic measurements of
Fig. 4.

 lactate (Fig. 4 D, E, I, and J). Interestingly, the ratio of lactate to
pyruvate, which reflects the cytosolic redox, was decreased by
G3PP overexpression and increased by G3PP knockdown (Fig. 5F),
indicating that G3PP regulates cellular redox. Thus, G3PP levels
were reciprocally related to cellular total NADH levels (Fig. 5G).
We also noticed a significant decline in total NAD+ levels by G3PP
overexpression (Fig. 5H), which may be related to lowered pro-
duction of ATP (Fig. 5K), which is needed for the synthesis of
NAD+. Such reduced formation of ATP during respiration was
also observed in rat islet cells (Fig. 3G). Changes in cellular redox
ratio (i.e., NADH/NAD+) were more evident upon G3PP knock-
down than after G3PP overexpression (Fig. 5I), probably because
of reduced total NAD+ levels. These results suggest that G3PP, by
promoting Gro3P to glycerol conversion, actually regulates NADH/
NAD+ ratio in the cell and thus ATP production. Thus, over-
expression of G3PP causes a shift in glucose carbon flux toward
glycerol formation, leading to a decrease in DHAP and also in
NADH (used for DHAP-to-Gro3P conversion; see Fig. 2H), which
results in reduced ATP formation and also reduced lactate pro-
duction, an index of glycolysis, in hepatocytes. The reverse is true
when G3PP is knocked down, leading to elevated ATP production.
Thus, G3PP appears to directly regulate cellular redox and energy
production.
Gro3P but Not 2-Phosphoglycolate Is the Physiologically Relevant
Substrate for G3PP/PGP. Significantly, 2-PG levels were found to
be very low (<0.04 nmol/mg protein or <0.02 mM), approxi-
mately 250-fold lower than Gro3P levels and also ∼75-fold lower
than the Km for PGP/G3PP, in hepatocytes, and the cellular
content of G3PP/PGP had no major effect on 2-PG levels (Fig. 5J).
However, Gro3P cellular concentration calculated from our results
on hepatocytes ranges from 2 mM to 4.5 mM at low and high
glucose concentrations. Similarly, in INS832/13 cells, Gro3P con-
centration was calculated to be ∼1.5 mM at 10 mM glucose con-
centration (31). These cellular concentrations of Gro3P are quite
favorable for G3PP/PGP to use this substrate effectively. Thus, our
results indicated that 2-PG is not a physiologically relevant sub-
strate for this enzyme, at least in hepatocytes, even though this
enzyme can efficiently hydrolyze 2-PG when available at very high
concentrations in a cell extract. It is important to keep in mind that
2-PG is formed in cells during repair of DNA strands when they
are broken, for example, in the presence of chemical agents like
bleomycin or radiation (32), and its levels in normal tissues and
cells are quite low. It has been reported earlier that 2-PG levels in
liver tissue are approximately 19–20 μM (33) and that, in many
other tissues and blood, this metabolite is present in micromolar
concentrations only. Therefore, the normal physiological function
of this enzyme is very likely to be in the control of Gro3P levels via
its hydrolysis.
In Vivo Overexpression of G3PP Reduces Hepatic Glucose Production
and Plasma TGs in Rats. To further understand the metabolic reg-
ulatory role of G3PP, we injected adenoviral vector coding for
hG3PP (Adv-hG3PP) or GFP (Adv-GFP; control) to rats. One week
after injection, expression of G3PP in liver was greatly elevated (Fig.
6 A and B), whereas it was not altered in other tissues (Fig. S4G).
One day after injection, Adv-hG3PP–injected rats showed ∼10%
reduction in body weight (BW), which was maintained for the next
6 d compared with Adv-GFP–injected rats (Fig. 6 C and D). Adv-
G3PP rats also showed a modest reduction in cumulative food

 intake (Fig. 6E). After one week, plasma glycerol levels were
markedly elevated (Fig. 6F), indicating that the overexpressed
G3PP in liver is able to generate glycerol in vivo, which is re-
leased into blood. In agreement with the observation in isolated
hepatocytes and INS832/13 cells, in vivo liver overexpression of
G3PP led to reduced plasma TG levels (Fig. 6G), which is likely
a result of reduced hepatic TG synthesis. Circulating LDL and
HDL were modestly affected, with HDL showing a significant
increase (Fig. S4 E and F) and LDL showing a decreasing trend.
Hepatic glucose production from glycerol during a glycerol load
test was reduced in Adv-G3PP–injected rats (Fig. 6H), showing
that liver gluconeogenesis from glycerol was affected, as was the
case with isolated rat hepatocytes.
Conclusion
The possibility of Gro3P hydrolysis in mammalian cells (34) and
fish (11, 35) was previously considered, but no clear evidence
could be obtained. In a recent work, it has been suggested that,
in liver, there is a NADH/NAD+ ratio-dependent direct forma-
tion of glycerol from Gro3P, generated by high carbohydrate
intake, particularly under conditions of mitochondrial aspartate-
glutamate carrier isoform-2 (i.e., citrin) deficiency; however, no
enzyme for this conversion was suggested (36).
Recently, it has been proposed that the action of the antidi-
abetic agent metformin entails, at least in part, mitochondrial
Gro3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH) inhibition, resulting in increased
hepatic cytosolic redox that lowers hepatic gluconeogenesis (37)
(Fig. 2H). In the present work, the net anticipated result of en-
hanced G3PP activity and reduced Gro3P levels is also decreased
flux through mitochondrial G3PDH because there is less substrate
for this enzyme. However, G3PP activation will result in decreased
cytosolic NADH rather than increased, as metformin does. Thus,
because of the irreversible nature of G3PP reaction, its overactivity
pulls glycolytic carbon flux toward glycerol formation. As a result,
cytosolic NADH, which is formed during glycolysis, is consumed to
reduce dihydroxyacetone-phosphate to Gro3P by cytosolic Gro3P
dehydrogenase. Hence, metformin and elevated G3PP activity
inhibit gluconeogenesis, but via different mechanisms: metformin
by increasing the cytosolic redox and G3PP by removing Gro3P
and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, the substrates of gluconeogen-
esis (Fig. 2H).
In sum, we have identified a metabolic enzyme in mammalian
cells that can directly transform Gro3P to glycerol. The identi-
fication of a previously unrecognized G3PP in mammalian cells
is an important addition to our understanding of metabolic
regulation and signaling at large. We have shown that G3PP
expression level controls several metabolic pathways and bi-
ological processes (Fig. 2H) in a tumoral β-cell line and in normal
rat islet cells as well as in hepatocytes. These include, depending
on the cell type, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, phos-
pholipid synthesis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial
energy metabolism, cellular redox, and ATP production. In ad-
dition, G3PP regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion and the
response to metabolic stress in the β-cell. Thus, G3PP is an at-
tractive target for metabolic syndrome-related disorders. It is an-
ticipated that enhanced activity of G3PP to be beneficial under
conditions of type 2 diabetes and obesity, as it protects β-cells from
fuel surfeit toxicity and from exhaustion caused by overstimulation
by high glucose concentrations and reduces hepatic glucose pro-
duction and the lipogenic burden.

 Materials and Methods
Animals. All procedures were approved by the institutional committee for the
protection of animals (Comité Instituitionnel de Protection des Animaux du
Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal). Five-week-old male C57BL/
6N mice and Wistar rats (85–250 g) were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle
with free access to water and standard diet (15% fat by energy). Mice were
fed with chow or HFD (60% calories from fat) for 8 wk. G3PP expression was
evaluated in chow-fed, HFD-fed, and overnight-fasted mice.
Islet and Hepatocyte Isolation. Pancreatic islets were isolated from rats and
mice (38). Isolated islets were cultured overnight at 37 °C in complete RPMI
1640 medium. Hepatocytes were isolated from rats by in situ collagenase
perfusion and were seeded in DMEM complete medium.
Insulin Secretion. Insulin secretion in INS832/13 cells (39) and isolated islet cells
was measured in static incubations (38). Details are given in SI Materials
and Methods.
Overexpression and RNAi Knockdown of G3PP. pCMV-based plasmids expressing
human G3PP and GFP were used. After transfection using Lipofectamine, INS832/13
cells were cultured for 48 h in 96-well, 12-well, or 6-well plates. siRNAs against
G3PP and two scrambled siRNAs were introduced into INS832/13 cells by RNAiMAX
(40). Transfected cells were used for Western blotting and measurements of
insulin secretion, caspase activity, glycerol and FFA release, O2 consumption,
and fatty acid oxidation and esterification.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from INS832/13 cells,
islet cells, and rodent tissues, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg
of total RNA. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed, and the
products were quantified by using the FastStart DNA Master PLUS SYBR
green kit (Roche Diagnostics). Expression levels were normalized for the 18S
or cyclophilin mRNA transcript.
FFAs and Glycerol Release. For FFA determinations, rat islet cells were pre-
incubated for 1 h in Krebs Ringer buffer-Hepes (KRBH) containing 2 mM
glutamine and 4 mM glucose and then for 2 h at 4 mM, 10 mM, 16 mM, and
25 mM glucose. The low and high glucose concentrations were 2 mM and
10 mM for INS832/13 cells with 2 mM glutamine present. Incubations were done
without and with the panlipase inhibitor orlistat. FFA released into the medium
was extracted by a modified Dole-Meinertz procedure and quantified by re-
verse-phase HPLC (40). Glycerol release was determined by a radiometric
glycerol assay using [γ-32P]ATP and glycerokinase.
Plasma Chemistry. TGs and glycerol were measured by using a colorimetric
assay kit (Sigma), and LDL and HDL by using a kit (L-Type LDL-C; Wako).
Fatty Acid Esterification and Oxidation. Fatty acid esterification and oxidation
in the transfected INS832/13 cells and infected hepatocytes were measured at
low and high glucose levels as indicated in figure legends.
Glucotoxicity and Glucolipotoxicity. The effect of overexpression or knock-
down of G3PP in INS832/13 cells on caspase-3 activity was assessed at 5 mM or
20 mM glucose with or without 0.3 mM palmitate.
Oxygen Consumption and Mitochondrial Function. Respiration measurements
in vitro were made in a XF24 respirometer (Seahorse Bioscience) using trans-
fected INS832/13 cells and isolated rat islets after infection with adeno- or
lentivirus constructs. After basal respiration measurement for 20 min, glucose
levels were elevated to 10 mM (INS cells) or 16 mM (islets). After incubations for
20 min or 1 h (INS and islet cells, respectively), oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide-
4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and antimycin/rotenone were
added by three successive injections to assess uncoupled respiration, maximal
respiration, and nonmitochondrial respiration, respectively.
Gluconeogenesis and Glycolysis in Hepatocytes. For gluconeogenesis de-
termination, after infection with adeno- or lentiviral constructs, hepatocytes
were starved in DMEM without glucose for 2 h, followed by incubation in
glucose-free DMEM (pH 7.4) without phenol red, supplemented with 10 mM
glycerol or 20 mM sodium lactate plus 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 15 mM Hepes for 2 h. After incubation, the medium was
processed for glucose measurement. Glycolysis was assessed by lactate con-
tent and lactate release measurement, as lactate is considered a reliable
index of steady-state glycolysis in isolated hepatocytes in culture (41).
Adenovirus and Lentivirus Infection of Islet Cells and Hepatocytes. Islet cells
and hepatocytes were infected with recombinant adenovirus (multiplicity of
infection of 100) expressing GFP alone (control) or human G3PP (Vector
Biolabs), both under CMV promoter control, to overexpress these proteins.
To knock down endogenous G3PP, we used rat G3PP-shRNA lentivirus
(multiplicity of infection of 5), with a GFP-shRNA lentivirus as control (abm).
Experiments were performed 48 h after infection.
G3PP-Adenovirus Administration to Rats. Male rats (85–100 g) were housed in
individual cages and given free access to standard diet. Rats received a single
injection by tail vein of adenovirus (5.5 × 1010 viral particles per milliliter per
100 g BW) carrying the genes of human G3PP (Adv-hG3PP) or GFP (Adv-GFP)
as control. Rats were given FK506 (0.2 mg/kg BW) on the day before and on
the day of the virus administration to minimize the immune response. Food
consumption and BW were monitored daily for 7 d following virus injection.
Then, food was withdrawn for 12 h from the rats and a glycerol load test
was performed. Rats were killed and blood and different tissues were col-
lected for analyses.
Oral Glycerol Load Test. Rats injected with Adv-G3PP or Adv-GFP were fed a chow
diet for 1 wk and, on the seventh day, food was withdrawn for 12 h. Then, 87%
(wt/vol) glycerol (5 mg/g BW) was administered orally. Blood was collected from
the tail vein before and at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 50 min, and 60 min
after glycerol load, and blood glucose was measured by using a glucometer.
PGP/G3PP Protein Expression and Activity in Vitro. Purified recombinant mu-
rine PGP/G3PP (18) was assayed by using EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit
(Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). The reaction mix in a volume of 100 μL,
containing 50 mM triethanolamine·HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5),
and indicated concentrations of Gro3P, was preincubated for 10 min at room
temperature. The reaction at 37 °C was started by the addition of 1 μg pu-
rified PGP/G3PP, and phosphatase activity was then monitored by measuring
absorbance at 360 nm in a microplate reader (Spectramax Plus 384; Molec-
ular Devices) and corrected for background absorbance. Human PGP/G3PP in
extracts of overexpressing 293T cells (10 μg cell extract protein) or control
INS832/13 cells (30 μg cell extract protein) was assayed by using a Phosphate
Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision). The reaction mix (final volume, 200 μL)
containing 50 mM triethanolamine·HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5),
indicated concentrations of Gro3P, 2-PG, and glucose-6-phosphate was
preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, and the reaction was started
by the addition of G3PP overexpressed or control extracts and continued for
10 min. Phosphatase activity was monitored by measuring the absorbance at
650 nm on a microplate reader (Greiner Bio-one). To derive KM and Kcat
values, the data were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten
equation by using GraphPad Prism.
Targeted Metabolomics in Rat Hepatocytes. After infection with adeno- or
lentiviral constructs, primary hepatocytes were starved without glucose in
DMEM for 2 h, followed by incubation in glucose-free DMEM (pH 7.4) without
phenol red, supplemented with 5 mM or 25 mM glucose for 2 h. After in-
cubation, medium was removed and metabolism rapidly quenched by
transferring culture plates in liquid nitrogen. Metabolites were extracted as
described previously (31) with the following modifications. Cells were scraped
on ice and collected in 675 μL ice-cold extraction buffer [80% (vol/vol)
methanol, 13.7 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9.0, with 10 μM (13C10,15N5)-
adenosine-5′-monophosphate lithium salt as internal standard], transferred
into polypropylene (PP) tubes, and sonicated in a cup-horn sonicator at
150 W for 2 min (cycles of 10 s on, 10 s off) in an ethanol/ice bath. Cell ex-
tracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 25,830 × g, and supernatants
were collected in ice-cold 2-mL PP tubes, to which 250 μL water was added.
Polar metabolites were extracted with 1,080 μL of chloroform:heptane
(3:1 vol/vol) by 2 × 10 s vortex followed by 10-min incubation on ice and 15-
min centrifugation at 4 °C, 12,500 × g. From the upper phase, 600 μL was
collected without carrying out any interface material and transferred into new
cold 2-mL PP tubes. These tubes were centrifuged again, and 400 μL super-
natant were collected into cold 1.5-mL PP tubes. Samples were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and dried in two steps—first, in a SpeedVac Concentrator for ∼2 h
(maximal vacuum, no heat; Savant) at 4 °C to remove methanol; and second, by
lyophilization for 90 min (Labconco FreeZone) —and then stored at −80 °C
until used. Samples were reconstituted in 14 μL of Milli-Q water, and injections
of 3 μL were performed in duplicate on an electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS
system composed of an Agilent 1200 SL device (for LC) and a triple-quadrupole
mass spectrometer (4000Q TRAP MS/MS; Sciex). Samples were separated by
gradient elution of 12 min on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.1 × 75-mm, 2.7-μm
column (Agilent Technologies) using mobile phase consisting of an aqueous

solvent B [95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in water, 0.1% formic acid], at a flow rate
of 0.75 mL/min and column oven temperature of 40 °C. The MS was operated
in negative electrospray ionization mode using a turbo ion spray source.
Transitions used were described previously (31), with additional selected ion
monitoring at mass/charge ratios of 154.75/78.79, for 2-PG and glycolate.
Quantification was performed as described before (31).
Statistical Analysis. Values are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical signifi-
cance was calculated with one-way or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or
Dunnett post hoc testing for multiple comparisons or the Student t test as
indicated. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.
