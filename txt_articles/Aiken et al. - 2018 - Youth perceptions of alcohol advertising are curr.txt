A 
significant body of work indicates 
that exposure to alcohol advertising 
is associated with increased positive 
beliefs about alcohol, intentions to drink, 
likelihood of underage drinking, and 
increased consumption by young people.1-10 
Increasing identification with advertising 
produces changes in consumers’ attitudes 
and behaviours.11,12 Alcohol advertisements 
with greater youth appeal appear to have 
more of an influence on young peoples’ 
drinking. The desirability of characters in 
alcohol advertising predicts identification 
with these characters, which in turn predicts 
positive alcohol expectancies, frequency 
and quantity of alcohol use.2,13,14 More 
active engagement with alcohol marketing 
by young people has been associated with 
consuming larger quantities of alcohol.15
While many high-income countries have 
some regulation of alcohol advertising, 
these systems tend to be developed and 
managed by industry, and participation 
by advertisers is often voluntary.16-19 For 
example, the placement and broadcasting of 
alcohol advertising in Australia20-23 is primarily 
industry controlled, with some minor input 
from government. Furthermore, the actual 
content of advertising is entirely governed 
by a voluntary, industry-managed code of 
conduct, the Alcohol Beverages Advertising 
Code (ABAC).17 These quasi-regulatory codes 
are common among high-income countries 
and appear to be frequently breached.16,24-31 
In Australia, although the majority of alcohol 
advertisers participate in the voluntary 
compliance scheme,17 the decisions made by 
the independent adjudication panel do not 
have to be enforced, there are no penalties for 
non-compliance17,18 and the decisions have 
been contested by those who interpret the 
Australian voluntary code differently.25,28,29,32
Commentators have questioned the 
effectiveness of these advertising 
codes.16,23,30,33 Australian and US studies based 
on public health expert opinion show that 
alcohol advertisements breaching advertising 
codes are published frequently in media 
consumed by young people,34-36 with similar 
findings reported from the perspective of lay 
people (the ‘reasonable person test’).26,27,31,37-39  
Furthermore, significant proportions of 
Australian adolescents and young adults 
also perceive alcohol advertisements as 
being aimed at their age group and perceive 
messages inconsistent with the regulatory 
code, such as that the beverage would 
enhance mood or social success.31,37-39
The technical framework of alcohol 
advertising codes is meant to operationalise 
the spirit of the codes and, in doing so, to 
protect children and adolescents from the 
influence of alcohol advertising. However, 
it is clear from these previous studies that 
advertisements that breach the codes may

Abstract 
Objectives: We investigated young people’s exposure to alcohol advertising, their intentions 
to consume and purchase alcohol products following the viewing of advertisements, and 
whether they perceived the actors in the advertisements as being under the age of 25 years.
Methods: Face-to-face interviews were completed with 351 risky drinking 16–19-year-old 
Australians, with a sub-sample (n=68) responding to a range of alcohol advertisements in an 
in-depth interview. 
Results: Participants were exposed to alcohol advertisements from an average of seven specific 
contexts in the past 12 months, with younger adolescents more likely to recall TV and outdoor 
billboards (n=351). Positive perception of advertisements was associated with increased 
intention to use and to purchase advertised products (n=68). A liqueur advertisement actor 
was perceived by 94% as being under 25 years-old, and almost 30% thought the advertisement 
was marketed at people younger than 18 years of age.
Conclusions: Young people’s perceptions of alcohol advertising are not necessarily in line 
with expert/industry assessment; products are sometimes marketed in a way that is highly 
appealing to young people. Greater appeal was associated with increased intention to 
consume and to purchase products. 
Implications for public health: These results indicate deficiencies in the effectiveness of 
current advertising codes in regard to protecting the health and wellbeing of adolescents.

be published, despite pre-vetting processes. 
Alcohol advertising codes have been 
criticised as inadequate, narrow in scope and 
ambiguous in meaning.16,18,30 The ambiguity 
leaves room for advertisers to push the 
boundaries, resulting in the publication of 
advertisements that may technically comply 
with the operationalised codes, but are not 
always consistent with the spirit of the codes. 
Internationally, systems of regulation 
generally include that advertising should 
not have strong or evident appeal to 
children or adolescents (<18 or <21 years 
of age, depending on jurisdiction), should 
not encourage excessive consumption or 
associate alcohol with mood enhancement or 
the achievement of success of any kind.16,17,40 
The Australian advertising code requires 
actors to be at least 25 years of age and to be 
clearly depicted as adults (>18 years),17 which 
is similar to other codes internationally.16 
The current study investigated the extent to 
which a selection of alcohol advertisements 
had evident appeal to adolescent and 
young adult Australian alcohol users, and 
whether this was associated with intentions 
to consume and purchase the advertised 
products. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study to assess how young people 
themselves perceive the age of the actors in 
published advertisements. 
Methods
Recruitment
A convenience sample of 351 participants 
were recruited via social media, snowballing, 
posters at universities/technical colleges 
and youth services as a part of a larger 
2013 study on drinking among young 
Australians.41 Participants completed a 
face-to-face quantitative interview (referred 
to hereafter as quantitative interview) and 
were reimbursed $40, and 68 participants 
also completed a further qualitative and 
quantitative in-depth interview (referred to 
hereafter as the in-depth interview) and were 
reimbursed an additional $30. 
Sample
The legal age to purchase alcohol in Australia 
is 18 years; our sample included heavy-
drinking young adults (18–19 years old) and 
adolescents (16–17 years old) to assess any 
differences in exposure and perceptions 
of those of legal purchasing age and those 
below. 
Inclusion criteria were developed to capture 
a heavy drinking 16–19-year-old population, 
based on population survey data,42,43 defining 
heavy drinking as drinking at least seven 
standard drinks in a single sitting [or 11 
standard drinks for 18–19-year-old males], at 
least twice a month. The in-depth qualitative 
participants were consecutively selected from 
the larger group based on the consumption 
of 11+ standard drinks on their last drinking 
occasion, with quotas to ensure a balance of 
gender, age and occupation. Comparison of 
the sample with heavy-drinking sub-samples 
in school and population datasets,42,43 which 
used representative sampling techniques, 
indicated that the age and gender matched 
samples were broadly similar in terms of rates 
of consumption. 
Of the 351 participants, 51% were male; 
20% were aged 16 years; 27% were aged 
17 years; 27% were aged 18 years; and 26% 
were 19 years of age. The majority were 
studying (34% school, 22% technical college/
trade apprentice, 24% university); 5% were 
employed full-time; 25% were employed part-
time or casually; and 8% were unemployed. 
Participants were from four Australian sites: 
Sydney, New South Wales (29%); Melbourne, 
Victoria (25%); Perth, Western Australia (27%); 
and Bunbury, Western Australia (19%). This 
study received ethics approval from all data 
collection sites.
Measures
The quantitative interview questions included 
demographics, perception of the age of 
characters in alcohol advertising generally, 
and exposure to alcohol advertising across 
13 possible placements including television, 
radio, licensed venues (e.g. nightclubs or 
pubs), outdoor billboards/posters, cinema, 
print publications, public transport, large 
events/festivals, clothing, mobile phone 
applications, social networking sites, YouTube 
and other Internet sites. The in-depth 
interview included questions informed by 
Chen et al.44 about six alcohol advertisements 
(described in Table 1). Advertisements were 
selected from current online and print media 
(all still images), with three chosen that were 
anticipated to be appealing to young people 
(apple cider, liqueur and beer #1) and three 
that were not expected to be appealing 
(wine, beer #2, whisky), based on alcohol 
type and brand.45 For each advertisement, 
participants were asked: 
• How much did this ad appeal to you? (Not 
at all, Not much, A little bit, Quite a bit, Very 
much)
• How much did the ad make you want to try 
the product? (1-5 scale, as above)
• How likely would you be to purchase this 
product? (1-5 scale, as above)
• What age do you think the main character 
in this ad is? (Open-ended responses)
• Who do you think this product is marketed 
towards (e.g. a particular age range, 
gender, subculture, etc.)? (Open-ended 
responses)
• Do you think there are any perceived 
benefits to buying or drinking this 
product? (Open-ended responses)
Analyses
Chi-squared analyses were used to determine 
whether the items about exposure to 
advertising and the perceived age of actors 
varied by participant age, and whether items 
about advertisement appeal, intentions to 
try and to purchase the advertised products 
differed by participant age or gender. The

in-depth interview sub-sample’s open-ended 
estimates of advertisement character age and 
intended target audience age were grouped 
into categories (<18 years, 18–24 years, 25+ 
years) for similar chi-square tests. Their open-
ended responses regarding the marketing of 
advertised products and perceived benefits 
associated with the products were analysed 
using an inductive, bottom up approach. 
Quantitative analyses were conducted 
using STATA/SE software, version 11.2 (Stata 
Corporation, 2012).
Results
Advertising exposure 
There was high recall of context specific 
alcohol advertising in the past 12 months, 
with participants reporting exposure 
from an average of 7.4 contexts (standard 
deviation=2.5) of the 13 response options: 
89% reported seeing alcohol advertising 
on television; 82% on outdoor billboards or 
posters; 80% at large events; 76% in print 
publications; 60% on social networking sites 
and other internet sites; 58% on clothing; 50% 
on YouTube; 44% on radio; and 37% on public 
transport (n=351). Participants aged 18–19 
years were more likely to report exposure to 
alcohol advertising in licenced venues (76% 
vs. 39%; χ2(1, N=351)=49.10, p<0.01) and on 
social networking sites (65% vs. 54%; χ2 
(1, N=351)=4.39, p=0.04). Those aged 16–17 
years were more likely to report exposure 
to alcohol advertising on television (94% vs. 
86%; χ2(1, N=351)=6.45, p=0.01) and outdoor 
billboards/posters (87% vs. 77%; χ2 
(1, N=351)=5.31, p=0.02). 
Perceived age of actors in alcohol 
advertising
More than half (55%) of the 351 participants 
perceived that the actors in alcohol 
advertisements ‘always’ or ‘usually’ appeared 
to be under 25 years of age. A further 21% 
thought that they ‘sometimes’ appeared to be 
under 25 years old. There were no significant 
differences by participant age or gender. 
Perceptions of alcohol advertisements
The remaining results report on the in-depth 
interview explorations of the six alcohol 
advertisements (n=68). 
Appeal of alcohol advertisements
The apple cider and liqueur advertisements 
were rated most often as ‘very’ or ‘quite’ 
appealing (60% and 44%, respectively), see 
Table 2. Although there were no significant 
differences in appeal by participant age, it 
is of note that there were non-significant 
differences in rating of appeal between 
16–17-year-olds and 18–19-year-olds for the 
apple cider (48% vs. 68%), the whisky (24% 
vs. 10%) and beer #2 advertisements (35% 
vs. 26%). Males were significantly more likely 
to find the beer advertisements appealing 
compared to females.
Intentions to use and to purchase 
advertised products
Compared to the other advertised products, 
higher proportions wanted to try the apple 
cider and the liqueur ‘quite a lot’ or ‘very much’ 
based on the respective advertisements 
(Table 2). Younger teenagers were 
significantly more likely to want to try the 
whisky compared with the older teenagers. 
Females were significantly more likely to 
want to try the liqueur compared to males, 
and males were more likely to want to try the 
whisky (in particular, younger males, of whom 
38% reported wanting to try compared with 
6% of 18–19-year-old males (χ2(1, N=68)=4.93, 
p=0.03).
When asked how likely they would be 
to purchase the products based on the 
advertisements, participants again more 
frequently reported wanting to purchase 
(‘quite a lot’ or ‘very much’) the apple cider 
(41%) and liqueur (35%), see Table 2. The 
16–17-year-olds showed a similar pattern of 
responses to the older teenagers. Males were 
more likely to want to purchase the beers and 
females the liqueur.
Table 3 shows the associations between 
wanting to try a product and whether the 
young people found the advertisement for 
that product appealing (all ages combined 
due to small cell sizes). Those who rated 
the advertisements as appealing were 
significantly more likely to report that they 
wanted to try the product (Table 3). Similarly, 
those who found an advertisement appealing 
were significantly more likely to report 
wanting to purchase the product, compared 
with those who did not find it appealing, with 
the exception of the wine advertisement. 
Perceived age of actors in the alcohol 
advertisements 
The actor in the liqueur advertisement was 
perceived as being under 25 years of age 
by 94% of the sample (97% of 16–17-year-
olds), with the perceived age ranging from 
16–27 years. Almost one-quarter rated the 
actors in the apple cider advertisement as 
appearing under 25 years of age (range 18–40 
years). Fifteen per cent rated the actor in the 
advertisement for beer #1 as appearing to be 
under 25 years of age (range 20–45 years). 
There were no significant differences by 
participant age. The whisky, wine and beer #2 
advertisements contained no actors, so were 
not included in this analysis.

Youth perceptions of alcohol advertising
Perceptions of target markets and benefits 
associated with consumption of products
The advertisements with actors perceived 
to be relatively young were also perceived 
to be targeted at young people. Almost 30% 
thought that the liqueur advertisement 
was marketed at people less than 18 years 
of age, 40% thought that the apple cider 
advertisement was targeted at those under 
25 years and 8% at those under 18 years of 
age. Almost one-quarter thought that the first 
beer advertisement was marketed at those 
under 25 years of age. Very few participants 
thought that the whisky, the second beer or 
the wine advertisements were marketed at 
those less than 25 years of age. There were no 
significant differences by participant age.
Qualitative responses to advertisements
The qualitative responses to the 
advertisements give insight into why 
certain advertisements may have appealed 
more than others. For example, the 
liqueur advertisement was associated 
with attractiveness, partying, and being 
fashionable: “If you are a girl, it will make 
you look hot like her. If you are a man, you 
can buy these drinks for girls who look like 
her” (Female, 19); “You look fun; you are up 
for a good night” (Male, 17); “It’ll taste good, 
it looks pretty and it’s cool, yeah” (Female, 
18). The apple cider advertisement was seen 
as being funny and was associated with 
relaxation, fun and being young: “It’s like 
a funny ad with animals … it just appeals 
more to kids” (Male, 16); “It is going to give 
you a good time if you drink it” (Female, 18); 
“You’d be happier [if you drank it]” (Male, 16). 
The advertisement for beer #1 was seen as 
humorous and appealing particularly to men: 
“You would be like the funny guy” (Female, 
18); “It just looks humorous and like fun more 
than anything” (Female, 16); “Yeah, I think it’s 
saying it makes you more manly sort of thing, 
or tough” (Male, 17). 
The other advertisements were often 
associated with characteristics or benefits not 
usually associated with teenage drinkers. For 
example, the whisky was often seen as being 
expensive and for older people: “You look 
classy [if you drink it]” (Male, 18); “[It’s] a bit 
more upper class, more mature” (Male, 18). The 
wine was often seen as being for more mature 
and sophisticated people: “You might be more 
cultured if you drink wine” (Male, 19); “I’d say 
middle age … 30 to 50. People who are more 
settled down and drink to enjoy it” (Female, 
18). The advertisement for beer #2 tended to 
be seen as appealing to men “You’ll look like a 
man drinking one” (Male, 18); “Blokes. Just like 
manly men, like hard core Aussie guys who 
work in the mines” (Male, 19). 
Discussion
This study draws directly on the views of 
young people, rather than relying on the 
views of experts or researchers, to understand 
the ways in which alcohol advertisements 
are perceived. The majority of the 351 
participants reported regular exposure to 
alcohol advertising, particularly on television 
and outdoor billboards and at festivals/
events (all locations that are potentially 
accessible to children and adolescents). The 
similar rates of exposure for the adolescents 
(16–17 years) and adults (18–19 years) 
demonstrates that the current – mainly 
industry-managed – regulation system in 
Australia does little to prevent exposure 
of alcohol advertising to adolescents. The 
current study also demonstrates that the 
perceptions of young people regarding 
alcohol advertising do not necessarily match 
industry assessments of regulatory codes. 
The published advertisements presented in 
this study had all passed review by the ABAC, 
yet the responses from the young people in 
the in-depth interview sub-sample (n=68) 
demonstrated that, from the perspective of 
young people, some of the advertisements 
contravened the guidelines set down in the 
ABAC. Some of the presented advertisements 
directly appealed to both adolescents and 
young adults and were seen as containing 
actors who were perceived as quite young. 
The appeal of the advertisements was 
associated with intentions to consume and 
to purchase advertised products, which is of 
concern. The qualitative responses support 
the previous research indicating the young 
people regularly perceive messages that 
alcohol enhances mood and/or social success. 
The perceptions of these young people are 
in line with previous research using public 
health expert and researcher assessment of 
advertisements, indicating that the voluntary 
industry-managed codes are frequently 
breached.16,24-31
Most of the advertisements shown appealed 
to at least some of the adolescents, and two 
stood out as being particularly appealing. 
Consistent with young people’s drink 
preferences,45 more than half of 16–17-year-
old participants indicated that the apple 
cider advertisement was strongly appealing 
and 45% found the liqueur advertisement 
similarly appealing. These advertisements 
may have passed compliance checks against 
the Australian industry code, which states 
that they ‘must not have strong or evident 
appeal to minors’;7(p2) however, from the 
perspective of young people, they do have 
evident appeal. Of course, advertising 
aims to be attractive and appealing to 
potential consumers and, while the alcohol 
industry might argue that advertisements 
do not intentionally target adolescents, 
the marketing messages are nonetheless 
reaching adolescents. 
Alcohol advertising codes tend to prohibit 
the use of actors or characters who are under 
25 years of age,16,17,40 which attempts to 
control the perceived age of characters in 
advertising. As one might reasonably expect, 
there is a connection between the use of 
likeable, youthful characters and the appeal 
of an advertisement to young people.2,13,14,44

The apple cider and liqueur advertisements 
contained actors who were more often 
perceived as being younger than 25 years 
of age by the adolescents in this study. 
Furthermore, participants of all ages often 
rated these two advertisements as being 
marketed toward under those aged under 25 
years, with almost one-third perceiving the 
liqueur advertisement as specifically targeting 
adolescents. Of course, these advertisements 
are not unusual in their use of young actors; 
the majority of the 351 participants indicated 
that actors in alcohol advertising ‘usually’ or 
‘always’ appeared to be under 25 years of age. 
This result is consistent with UK research that 
found 29% of advertisements studied had 
strong appeal to people aged under 18 and 
13% featured actors who appeared under 
25 years of age.27 While the actors in alcohol 
advertising may actually be older than 25 
years of age, advertising is regularly perceived 
as presenting younger adults (<25 years). 
The notion that these advertisements do not 
appeal to those under 18 years of age cannot 
be easily sustained. While the advertisements 
shown in this study may be consistent 
with the technical framework of the code, 
some do directly appeal to adolescents, 
and sometimes used actors perceived as 
<25 years, possibly increasing this appeal. 
This is of concern considering the evidence 
showing positive perceptions of an alcohol 
advertisement are associated with intentions 
to consume the alcoholic product,38 and that 
advertising exposure and appeal are linked 
to increased alcohol consumption.2,5,9,13,15,46 
The current study, together with previous 
research, demonstrates that the current 
regulations are not necessarily achieving 
the intent of the codes – to ensure that 
alcohol is marketed in a ‘responsible manner’
. 
The code claims that the signatories are 
committed to ensuring alcohol advertising 
content “complies with the Code’s spirit and 
intent”
.17(p1) While the code does not define 
‘responsible’
, surely the ‘spirit and intent’ of 
the code should include protecting the health 
and wellbeing of children and adolescents?
The current study had several advantages: 
the in-depth interview participants reviewed 
a variety of published advertisements 
for different alcohol products; whereas, 
some previous studies have either shown 
only advertisements for a particular 
product37,39 or only advertisements that 
were considered to be in breach of the 
code by the researchers.38,39 This allowed 
investigation into whether particular 
approved advertisements/products are 
appealing to young people and whether 
those advertisements that meet the industry 
standards are perceived as such by young 
people. This study asked young people 
themselves to rate the advertisements and 
potential breaches of code as opposed to 
researchers, or code panel members. This was 
done to gain insight into the probable impact 
that alcohol advertising may have on the 
group that actually consumes the advertising 
content and products. 
 While the sub-sample was modest, all 
participants viewed all advertisements, which 
gave sufficient sample sizes for comparison 
of the different advertisements, rather 
than presenting combined data as some 
previous studies have done.27,38 However, 
the study may have lacked the power to 
detect differences when the sub-sample was 
broken down by age or gender. Differences 
observed in the proportions of 16–17-year-
olds and 18–19-year-olds who found the 
advertisements appealing and indicated 
intentions to consume, or to purchase alcohol 
products, were not significant. However, 
the important point is that substantial 
proportions of the 16–17-year-olds are 
finding alcohol advertisements appealing, 
want to consume and to purchase these 
products, and perceive the advertisements 
as being marketed at those younger than 25 
years of age. 
A second limitation is that the sample is not 
representative of the general population of 
16–19-year-olds; this sample was purposively 
selected from the heaviest alcohol users 
for this age group. However, it is important 
to understand influences on this high-risk 
drinking group, particularly in light of recent 
indications that the heaviest drinkers in 
Australia are increasing their consumption, 
whereas more moderate drinkers tend to be 
reducing their consumption.42,47 The results 
here are consistent with previous research 
from more general populations.26,27,31,37-39 
Finally, the current study is cross-sectional, so 
it is not possible to establish causal direction. 
It is possible that young people find particular 
advertisements more appealing because 
they already have experience with that type 
of alcohol, or that young people who are 
more likely to consume alcohol are also more 
likely to find advertising appealing. However, 
the association between advertising appeal 
and intentions to use has been previously 
observed, and there is now longitudinal 
data demonstrating the impact of 
advertising exposure and appeal on alcohol 
consumption.2,15,38 
In summary, while much of the previous 
research has been undertaken using 
only experts or researchers to assess 
advertisements, the current research 
adds to the growing body of evidence 
representing the probable response by 
lay people. This study shows that alcohol 
products are sometimes marketed in a 
way that directly appeals to adolescents, 
and this fact needs to be understood in 
considering the effectiveness of advertising 
codes in protecting the health of young 
people. While we cannot comment on the 
intended messages of these advertisements, 
it is clear that what is being perceived by 
these young people is not consistent with 
the ‘responsible’ marketing spirit of alcohol 
advertising codes. The results of this study 
provide further impetus for a thorough 
review and revision of alcohol advertising 
codes and processes of adjudication, as 
has been recommended by experts and 
government bodies internationally.16,23,25,30 
Current industry-regulated systems are 
not adequately protecting children and 
adolescents from exposure to or the influence 
of alcohol marketing. Advertisements 
strongly appealing to children or adolescents 
should be considered in breach of advertising 
codes, regardless of whether they also appeal 
to adults.
