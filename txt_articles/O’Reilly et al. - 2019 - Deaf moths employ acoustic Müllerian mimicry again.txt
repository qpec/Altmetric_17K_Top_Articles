Deaf moths employ acoustic 
Müllerian mimicry against bats 
using wingbeat-powered tymbals

Emitting ultrasound upon hearing an attacking bat is an effective defence strategy used by several moth 
taxa. Here we reveal how Yponomeuta moths acquire sophisticated acoustic protection despite being 
deaf themselves and hence unable to respond to bat attacks. Instead, flying Yponomeuta produce bursts 
of ultrasonic clicks perpetually; a striated patch in their hind wing clicks as the beating wing rotates and 
bends. this wing structure is strikingly similar to the thorax tymbals with which arctiine moths produce 
their anti-bat sounds. And indeed, Yponomeuta sounds closely mimic such arctiine signals, revealing 
convergence in form and function. Because both moth taxa contain noxious compounds, we conclude 
they are mutual Müllerian acoustic mimics. Yponomeuta’s perpetual clicking would however also attract 
bat predators. In response, their click amplitude is reduced and affords acoustic protection just as far as 
required, matching the distance over which bat biosonar would pick up Yponomeuta echoes anyway – 
advanced acoustic defences for a deaf moth.
Bats and moths have been involved in a 65-million-year evolutionary arms race since the advent of biosonar 
in Chiroptera1. As a result, moths have evolved a plethora of defences against their chiropteran adversaries. In 
addition to hearing structures tuned to the echolocation frequencies of sympatric bats2,3 providing an early warn-
ing system and allowing time for evasive manoeuvres, sound production as a defence against bats has evolved 
independently in at least three moth families4–6. Many bat species detect and localise prey by the sounds they 
generate7,8, so sound production is only adaptive when it creates protection with the sounds startling attacking 
bats, warning them of a (chemical) defence or jamming their biosonar9–11. These sounds’ acoustic properties such 
as duty cycle and number of clicks may be used to classify them by function1,4.
In addition to the anti-bat sounds of some moth species, others produce sound as a courtship song12 or for 
territory defence13. Several moth taxa produce sound by stridulation5,14–16, however, the majority do so with tym-
bals17: thin areas of cuticle, almost exclusively on the body, backed by an air cavity, which are buckled by a dedi-
cated muscle. It is this buckling that produces sounds, generally ultrasonic clicks18. Alternative sound producing 
structures in moths are modified genital structures5,14,19, percussive ‘castanets’20,21, and tymbals placed in the 
tegula22 or forewing23.
Yponomeuta Latreille, [1796] (Lepidoptera; Yponomeutidae) is a genus of likely over 100 species (Agassiz, D. 
Personal Communication, Mar 2018) of small (‘microlepidoptera’) to medium sized, mostly nocturnal moths24,25, 
characterised by the presence of a translucent patch devoid of scales at the hindwing base between Cu1b and Cu2 
veins (Fig. 1)26. Such a patch is also known from related genera of the subfamily Yponomeutinae, Teinoptila, 
Ptiloteina, Trisophista, Eumonopyta27,28. Agassiz27 found that these translucent patches contain a row of ridges 
adjacent to the Cu2 vein (Fig. 1B), and proposed sound production as their function by stridulation, naming the 
structure itself a stridularium. Very little is known about the evolutionary (acoustic) arms race between bats and 
the ‘microlepidoptera’
, let alone Yponomeuta specifically29,30, though one observation exists of Yponomeuta evon-
ymella and Y. padella producing ultrasound during flight in the field31.
In this study we investigate the acoustic ecology of some Yponomeutinae and address the following questions: 
firstly, is the translucent patch a sound producing structure, and if so, what are the acoustic properties of the 
sounds it produces? Secondly, if the translucent patch is a sound producing structure, how does it function? And 
finally, what is the adaptive value of any sound produced by these moths, in particular with respect to the acoustic 
arms race with bats as auditory specialist predators?

Results
Yponomeuta produce ultrasonic clicks in flight using their translucent patches. 
We recorded 
Yponomeuta evonymella and Y. cagnagella in free and tethered flight. All tested individuals (15 tethered and two 
free flying Y. evonymella and nine tethered Y. cagnagella) produced two bursts of a similar number of broadband 
ultrasonic clicks for every wingbeat cycle (Fig. 2). One burst was produced at the beginning of the upstroke (lower 
burst) and the other at its end (upper burst), with the clicks emitted in a more rapid succession during the for-
mer. The number of clicks per burst appears to be similar to the number of striations on the translucent patch. In 
 
Y. evonymella the mean number of clicks per burst was 12.6 ± 1.7 (mean ± SD, n = 14) and the number of stri-
ations was 11 + (Fig. 1B). Note however that these recordings are a superposition of the click bursts created by 
the two hindwings, as proven by almost identical sounds recorded with microphones on either side of the moth.
We removed both tymbals (area 260 ×
 800 µm; see Fig. 1) in 12 tethered Y. evonymella, recorded their flight 
sounds pre- and post-ablation, and determined the number of clicks produced per 100 ms (about three wingbeat 
cycles) as this is the duration used in the literature for calculating parameters such as maximum duty cycle4. 
Post-ablation, seven individuals produced no clicks, the eighth individual produced one click, and the remain-
ing four produced fewer clicks with lower amplitudes. Microscopic examination showed that in these four

individuals ablation of the translucent patch had been incomplete, so these were excluded from further analysis. 
A paired-samples t-test revealed a highly significant difference (n = 8, t(7) = 20.3, p < 0.001) between the two 
treatments.
Yponomeuta do not respond to ultrasound. 
Twenty Y. evonymella and four Y. cagnagella were used in 
hearing experiments. While in flight, no individual of either species reacted to the playback of an ultrasonic pulse 
known to elicit reactions of moths possessing ultrasonic hearing32. There was no flight cessation, or even alter-
ation in flight direction. The 20 Y. evonymella individuals were exposed to the stimulus while resting as a group 
within a flight cage, as were the four Y. cagnagella, in a separate cage. None of these resting individuals showed any 
response, such as twitching, movement cessation, or flight initiation to ultrasound playback. Ten Y. evonymella 
were also left in a flight cage and their responses to each other observed. As with the playbacks, no individuals 
showed any change in resting behaviour in response to take-off or flight, and therefore sound production, of any 
other moth.
sound production does not involve stridulation but wing motion. 
High-speed infrared videos of 
Y. evonymella and Y. cagnagella in tethered flight revealed that there was no contact of any body part (potentially 
serving as scraper) with the translucent patch during sound production or any other phase of the wingbeat cycle. 
So Yponomeuta do not produce sound by stridulation. Instead, clicks exclusively and always occur while the 
hindwing rotates (pronates or supinates) along its base-to-tip axis during the upper and lower turning phases of 
a wing stroke (Fig. 2 and see Supplementary Video S1). More detailed analysis showed that during supination at 
the beginning of the upstroke the posterior anal and jugal areas of the hindwing fold downwards relative to its 
anterior remigium, along what is likely the claval furrow.
This folding progresses from the tip to the base of the wing including the translucent patch, and its folding 
coincides with the production of the lower click burst (see Supplementary Video S2). During pronation at the top 
of the upstroke the upper click burst is produced, but no equally obvious folding of the hindwing occurs.
Duration, spectrum, source level, directionality, detection distance and duty cycle of clicks. 
 
Ten clicks recorded laterally (90°) from each of 14 Y. evonymella and nine Y. cagnagella were analysed for dura-
tion, temporal, amplitude and spectral parameters (Table 1). To measure horizontal emission directionality eight 
individuals (only six for 45°) were recorded from 0°, 45°, 90°, and 180° and five clicks analysed each (n = 150).
In terms of the horizontal directionality of Y. evonymella clicks, pairwise comparisons following a nested 
ANOVA (n = 264, F(1,3) = 7145.475, p < 0.001) showed that the sounds recorded laterally were significantly 
louder than those recorded at the three other angles (0° and 90°, Z = 6.6, p < 0.001, 45° and 90°, Z = 5.8, p < 0.001, 
and 180° and 90°, Z = −
9.0, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). There were no differences between the other three orientations (0° 
and 45°, Z = 0.3, p = 1.0, 0° and 180°, Z = −
2.3, p = 0.13, 45° and 180°, Z = −
2.4, p = 0.11) (Fig. 3). Mean calcu-
lated distances over which bats can detect these clicks were 6.0 ± 0.4 m (n = 8, 40) at 0°, 6.5 ± 0.4 m (n = 6, 30) at 
45°, 7.9 ± 0.7 m at 90°, and 5.6 ± 0.4 m at 180° (n = 8, 40) (Fig. 4B).
echo detection distances of Yponomeuta by bat biosonar. 
Echoes of five Y. evonymella were meas-
ured to determine over what distances they would be detectable to the biosonar of insectivorous bats. Spectral 
target strength (the signal amplitude reflected back to the receiver compared to the incident amplitude at each 
frequency) ranged between −
35 and −
43 dB at all frequencies between 20 and 160 kHz (Fig. 4A). Total target 
strength was highest when the moth was at 90° to the bat corresponding to a mean echo detection distance of 
7.1 ± 1.1 m (n = 5) for frequencies between 20–30 kHz, and at its lowest when it was 177° to the bat with a mean 
echo detection distance of 4.3 ± 0.8 m (n = 5) at these frequencies (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
the translucent hindwing patches of Yponomeuta likely act as buckling tymbals. 
Several lines 
of evidence corroborate the translucent patch as a buckling tymbal. First, translucent patch structure is strikingly 
convergent to the ultrasound emitting tymbals found on the thorax of many arctiine moths18,33. In both, similarly 
sized thin areas of cuticle, with air on either side, consist of a larger smooth area (window) with a series of parallel 
striations of increasing length (band of microtymbals) running alongside it (Fig. 1). In arctiines, an inward mus-
cular pull buckles the microtymbals in sequence and creates a burst of individual clicks. When the muscle relaxes, 
elastic forces buckle the microtymbals back in the reverse order creating a similar second burst of clicks18,34. 
The peak frequency of individual clicks increases during one burst and then decreases in the other, which is in 
agreement with the reverse order of buckling in and out (Fig. S4). Almost identically, Yponomeuta sounds also 
consist of two alternating click bursts with concurrent increases and decreases in individual click peak frequen-
cies (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Audio S3, Fig. S4). Additionally, the mean number of clicks per burst (Table 1) is just 
above the number of striations (Fig. 1). Note though that the tymbals in the two hindwings operate in parallel, 
thereby theoretically creating twice as many clicks per burst than there are striations. Our recordings show that 
the moth body does not cast an effective sound shadow such that the clicks from both hindwings reach to either 
side. We propose that the observed mean number of clicks per burst is only about half the theoretical maximum 
for both wings combined because many clicks will coincide between sides, some neighbouring striations might

buckle together, and some clicks may be too faint to be detected amongst other louder clicks. In summary, we 
conclude that the striations act as microtymbals, and that they are convergent in structure and mechanism to the 
sound production by microtymbals of arctiines. It can even be speculated that the tymbal deformations leading 
to microtymbal buckling might be similar.
The actuation mechanisms creating these tymbal deformations are however fundamentally different. In arc-
tiines, direct muscle actuation deforms the tymbal, while in Yponomeuta, flight muscles at the base of the wing 
are the actuators, and the tymbal is deformed by the rotation and aeroelastic folding of the hindwing along the 
claval furrow (directly adjacent to the microtymbals of the translucent patch) during the wingbeat cycle. Because 
the actuation of the translucent patch is due to aerodynamic forces and the aeroelastic properties of the wing, we 
are terming it the ‘aeroelastic tymbal’
. The evidence supports that the claval furrow is integral to the actuation of 
tymbal buckling, the exact biomechanical buckling mechanism is still unclear though.
Yponomeuta acoustically mimic arctiine anti-bat warning sounds. 
Both species of Yponomeuta 
produced two bursts of ultrasonic clicks similar to those of the Arctiinae, with peak frequencies within both 
the hearing range of bats and the range of frequencies produced by arctiines, including sympatric species Arctia 
caja and Phragmatobia fuliginosa (16.6 to 109.5 kHz; Fig. 2A)4,35,36. The sounds even show similar increases and 
decreases in frequency associated with the two bursts (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Audio S3, Fig. S4). In conjunction 
with the lack of hearing, and therefore the lack of acoustic intraspecific communication, this suggests an anti-bat 
function. However, the remarkable acoustic difference to arctiines is that Yponomeuta sounds are produced con-
stantly during flight. All other Lepidoptera produce sound only at specific times, for example during courtship, 
territory defence, or in response to the perceived presence of bats1,21,37. Perpetually casting its protective sound 
signal is inevitable for a deaf moth unable to detect and react to approaching bats.
Yponomeuta sounds appear to be directed at bats, but to what effect? The constant nature of Yponomeuta 
sound production eliminates the possibility of startle being the main mechanism of defence, as bats would habit-
uate to these sounds and even use them as cues to find prey38. Arctiine anti-bat sounds used for aposematism/
mimicry differ characteristically from those for sonar jamming in their maximum duty cycle (the percentage of 
time a signal is ‘on’) and the number of clicks per modulation cycle (the number of clicks per two bursts i.e. per 
buckling in and out of a tymbal)4. Whilst Y. evonymella and Y. cagnagella produce more clicks per modulation 
cycle than typical aposematic signalling arctiines, their duty cycles of 1.9 and 3.4% respectively place them exactly 
within the aposematic range. These low duty cycle anti-bat sounds are unable to jam biosonar, as a duty cycle 
of 20% or more is essential1,4. We hence conclude that Yponomeuta are acoustically mimicking the aposematic 
anti-bat sounds of tiger moths. The efficiency of these sounds as a defence should however be quantified through 
behavioural tests with bats.
Yponomeuta employ acoustic Müllerian mimicry. 
The toxicity or unpalatability of an organism indi-
cates whether their mimicking warning signals are truly aposematic (Müllerian mimicry) or impostors (Batesian 
mimicry). Yponomeuta larvae tend to be monophagous or at least limited to only a few species of food plant, 
something often associated with Lepidoptera that sequester specific toxins39. Principally, their hosts tend to be 
from Celastraceae, Rosaceae, Salicaceae and Crassulaceae40. Celastraceae and Crassulaceae contain butenolides41, 
secondary metabolites the derivatives of which are reported to have cytotoxic activity42, and Salicaceae contain 
salicin, a secondary metabolite known to act as a deterrent to insects and mammals40,43,44. Yponomeuta cagnagella 
larvae feed on Euonymus europaeus (European spindle tree; Celastraceae) which contains two butenolides, sipho-
nodin and to a lesser extent isosiphonodin41. Isosiphonodin is found in Y. cagnagella and is either synthesised or 
sequestered by the insect41. Interestingly, isosiphonodin is also found in adults of Yponomeuta species that do 
not feed on butenolide-containing plants41, providing evidence that at least these species synthesise butenolides. 
Presence of Isosiphonodin in several species of Yponomeuta suggests that the compound is important in the ecol-
ogy of these insects. Additionally, Prunus padus (Bird cherry, Rosaceae), the food plant of Y. evonymella, contains 
glucosides that can release hydrogen cyanide upon digestion, which has led to cattle poisoning45.
Unpalatability to predators is an obvious proposal for a function of containing butenolides and other noxious 
compounds. In fact, birds became drowsy when force-fed Yponomeuta adults40. However, as Menken et al.40 
observed, neither larvae nor adults of Yponomeuta are obviously visually aposematic. We show that they use 
acoustic aposematism instead. These moths produce sounds with properties extremely similar to the aposematic 
signals of larger moths (particularly arctiines), and are mostly nocturnal and therefore at low risk of predation 
by birds, explaining the lack of visual aposematism. Similarly, highly nocturnal Arctiinae tend to be acoustically 
aposematic but visually cryptic46. So these butenolides, and probably other compounds such as glucosides and 
salicin, are likely a defence against bats. We believe that Yponomeuta sounds are warning bats of the presence of 
distasteful and potentially toxic compounds in these moths. Thus, at least the species of Yponomeuta containing 
such compounds are aposematic signallers and therefore Müllerian not Batesian mimics of arctiines.
Yponomeuta sounds do not increase their conspicuousness to hunting bats. 
The continuous 
nature of Yponomeuta sound production might render them more vulnerable to bats because they will be able 
to eavesdrop on and be attracted to the warning sounds. So reduced click amplitude might be adaptive, and 
Yponomeuta evonymella clicks are indeed on average around 22 dB fainter than those of arctiines4. On the other 
hand, too low an amplitude and bats might detect the warnings too late to avoid fatal interactions. Therefore, 
the most adaptive warning click would be perceivable over the exact distance that a bat would detect the insect’s 
echoes anyway, and this is what we found for all orientations we tested (mean differences of 0.7, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.3 m 
for 0°, 45°, 90°, and 180° respectively; see Fig. 4B). Yponomeuta’s zone of acoustic protection has evolved to be just 
large enough to cover their zone of detectability by echolocation.

In conclusion, the aeroelastic tymbal of Yponomeuta is a completely novel sound-producing structure in 
Lepidoptera. Whilst wing-based sound production exists within the order13,23,47, all are evolutionarily independ-
ent of the aeroelastic tymbal and none are used to produce anti-bat ultrasound. This tymbal is a striking example 
of both structural and acoustic convergent evolution in the bat-moth evolutionary arms race, as well as being 
remarkable as a passive acoustic defence mechanism that bypasses the need for predator detection. The use of 
acoustic Müllerian mimicry by a deaf moth in the bat-moth evolutionary arms race shows again how little we 
know of the complex acoustic war raging in the night skies.
Materials and Methods
specimens. 
Live specimens of two British Yponomeuta species (Yponomeutidae, Lepidoptera), Y. evonymella 
and Y. cagnagella were used during the investigation. All specimens were wild caught as larvae and reared to 
pupation by donors. Pupae were kept in the laboratory until eclosion within 297 ×
 159 ×
 102 mm plastic rearing 
boxes (WorldwideButterflies, Lulworth, United Kingdom) at 21 °C. Due to initially having much higher numbers 
of the former than the latter, ablation and directionality experiments were performed using Y. evonymella only 
while sound production was documented and analysed in both species. As numbers of available individuals were 
limited, all individuals were flown until they became exhausted and would no longer fly.
tethering. 
Moths were tethered for most high-speed video recordings as well as all ablation experiments. 
Due to their small size, standard methods of tethering such as adhesives failed, so we inserted a size 000 insect pin 
dorsally into the mesothorax/prothorax of the moth until it just protruded ventrally. The pinhead was attached 
to a piece of dowel (5 mm in diameter) which itself was clamped so the moth was suspended in the centre of the 
flight arena. Although this is obviously an invasive tethering method, tethered specimens continued to fly for pro-
longed periods of time. Both audio and video recordings showed no obvious difference in the sounds produced 
by moths or their behaviour between tethered and free flight, so we continued with this as our tethering method.
sound playback. 
Twenty Y. evonymella, and four Y. cagnagella were free flown in a semi-anechoic chamber 
with and without exposure to an ultrasonic stimulus. Two human observers documented the behaviour of each 
individual under both conditions. A reaction was defined as any typical anti-bat escape manoeuvre including 
sudden cessation of flight or change in flight direction. Each moth was flown twice and one observer chose the 
order of stimulus exposure for each individual, while the other observer was kept blind to the stimulus condition. 
A Dazer II Ultrasonic Dog Deterrent (Dazer International, London, UK) was used as the stimulus, between one 
and two metres from the subject. The Dazer II produces a 25 kHz tone at 118.1 dB SPL (at 0.1 m). All 24 individ-
uals (separated by species) were also ensonified at rest within a 24 ×

 BugDorm-1 Insect Rearing Cage 
(Megaview Science Co., Ltd., Taichung City, Taiwan), at a distance of around 1 m from the centre of the cage.
Audio recordings. 
All recordings were made using a Type 4954 ¼″
 free-field microphone (grid on) with a 
Type 2669-L preamplifier, connected to a Type 2690 NEXUS conditioning amplifier (all Brüel & Kjær Sound and 
Vibration Measurements A/S, Nærum, Denmark), run through National Instruments NI-USB-6251 BNC sound 
card (National Instruments, Austin, Texas, United States).
For audio and high-speed video recordings insects were released or tethered within a 24 ×

BugDorm-1 Insect Rearing Cage (Megaview Science Co., Ltd., Taichung City, Taiwan) lined on the base, back 
and one wall with ultrasound absorbing foam (Studiofoam 4″
 Pyramids, Auralex Acoustics Inc., Indianapolis, 
IN) to reduce echoes and reverberation. The recording microphone was positioned through a small circular hole 
cut into the mesh on the unlined side of the cage. The front panel (facing the camera) and the right-hand panel of 
the BugDorm-1 were removed for synchronous audio and video recordings in order to facilitate the activation of 
the synchronisation click.
The software used to make the recordings was AviSoft Ni-Daq Recorder (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, 
Germany). All audio recordings were 16 bit, recorded at a sampling rate of 300 kHz, with the microphone between 
7 and 13.5 cm from the moth for tethered flight.
High-speed video recordings. 
Video recordings were made in the same set-up as above with the camera 
(Photron FASTCAM SA1.1, Phtoron, Tokyo, Japan) lens (Nikon Micro-NIKKOR 105 mm prime lens, Nikon, 
Tokyo, Japan) positioned through a sleeve opening of the BugDorm-1 and pointing perpendicular to the micro-
phone axis. Video recordings were made at 3000 fps with a resolution of 1024 ×
 1024 pixels and the subject was 
illuminated using infrared (IR, 850 nm) lighting from four LED light sources.
Video and audio recordings were synchronised with the use of a pair of pliers. The pliers were kept in frame 
and when closed they produced an extremely short broadband click which allowed for very accurate synchronisa-
tion of frame (video) and sample (audio) number. Synchronisation frames and samples were those that contained 
the collision of the jaws of the pliers and the beginning of the click respectively.
Ablation. 
Twelve Y. evonymella were tethered, flown, and recorded with their hindwings intact. The moths 
were positioned in the flight set-up and left, holding a small piece of foam to simulate being sat on a surface for 
15–30 minutes or until they initiated flight themselves. If they had not initiated flight by then, it was elicited by 
removing the piece of foam they were holding, which reliably triggered flight.
Under a 50x magnification dissection microscope (Leica EZ5 Stereo Microscope, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, 
Germany) the translucent patches in both hindwings were then removed using microdissection scissors from the 
wing joint to the point where scales began to appear. All ablated individuals were alive after that treatment and 
continued to fly on a tether with no noticeable difference in their flight pattern and readiness. Their sounds were 
then recorded again using the same procedure.

sound emission Directionality. 
The directionality of the click amplitude of eight, tethered Y. evonymella 
was quantified by recording the sounds using the same setup with the microphone facing the moth from four 
orientations with respect to the longitudinal axis of the moths from distances between 11.5 and 13.3 cm. Moth 
sounds were recorded from anterior (microphone at 0° facing the moth), posterior (microphone at 180°, behind 
the moth), lateral (at 90° from the right side of the moth) and anterio-lateral (microphone at 45° to the moth’s 
right side) directions. For each individual at each orientation the loudest click was isolated from the upper click 
burst for five consecutive wingbeats. Full bursts of clicks could not be detected from anterio-lateral recordings 
from two individuals and so the number of clicks at this orientation was 30 from six individuals as opposed to 40 
from eight for the other orientations.
Acoustic analysis. 
All sound recordings were analysed using Avisoft SASLab Pro (version 5.2.07, Avisoft 
Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany). For each individual, click bursts from ten consecutive wingbeats were analysed, 
either counting all clicks or further analysing the loudest click from each upper click burst. Click number was 
determined by totalling the number of clicks discernible in waveform and spectrogram for each of the two click 
bursts. Individual click duration was measured manually from the waveform. Click amplitude was calculated 
as peak-to-peak sound pressure values using the waveform of individual clicks, and was then converted to dB 
peSPL using a calibrated 40 kHz signal generator (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) and using the following 
formula:

For spectral analysis, individual clicks were isolated from the waveform including a linear ramp of 0.05 ms of 
noise on either side. Silence was then added (zero padding) on either side before analysis. Peak frequency was 
determined from a power spectrum (Hamming window size 1024). High and low frequency values are the fre-
quencies ± 15 dB below the amplitude of the peak frequency.
Calculation of detection distance of Yponomeuta sounds. 
Click detection distances were calculated 
for 14 Yponomeuta evonymella individuals. For each individual the loudest click from the upper burst of ten 
consecutive wingbeats was analysed. The peak frequencies and source level (dB peSPL) of each click were used to 
calculate the distance at which these sounds could be detected by bats, using a hearing threshold of 10 dB SPL. The 
following formula, an adaptation of the sonar equation48, was used to calculate these distances.

Yponomeuta evonymella directional click detection distance was calculated in the same manner, but using five 
consecutive wingbeats per angle (0°, 45°, 90°, and 180°) from eight individuals.
Moth echo detection distances. 
Echo strength of whole insect specimens was measured as spectral target 
strength (the fraction of the impinging sound energy returned from the target). Live specimens were killed by 
freezing and set with their wings in an upwards direction with the leading edge of the forewing perpendicular to 
the longitudinal axis of the body. The target specimen was positioned on a vertical tower (27.8 cm high, 2.5 ×
 5 cm 
wide) of ultrasound absorbing foam (Basotect W, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) placed on a turntable (LT360, 
LinearX Systems Inc., Battle Ground, WA). A sonar measurement head mounted on a lever arm faced the target 
from a lateral distance of 31 cm. The sonar measurement head consisted of a ¼″
 ultrasound microphone (type 
26AB without protective grid), pre-amplifier (type 2669 L, both GRAS Sound & Vibration A/S, Holte, Denmark), 
microphone power supply (type 5935-L, Brüel & Kjær, Nærum, Denmark) and a custom-made ferro-electret foil 
loudspeaker (33 ×
 14 mm, Emfit Ltd., Vaajakoski, Finland) powered by a PZD350 M/S high-voltage amplifier 
(TREK Inc., Lockport, NY). The centres of the microphone and speaker were separated by 15 mm, roughly repli-
cating the distance between the mouth and ears of a bat. The turntable, speaker, and microphone were connected 
to a soundcard (NI-DAQ BNC-2110) controlled using custom-programmes (LabVIEW v.16.0; both National 
Instruments, Austin, TX). For detailed methods see49,50. Five individual Yponomeuta evonymella were analysed 
using this technique. Each moth was scanned from 0–180° in 0.5° steps in the horizontal plane. A frequency mod-
ulated sweep from 15 to 250 kHz was used to ensonify the moth and for each position four echoes were recorded 
and averaged.
Detection distances of moth echoes were calculated analogous to click detection distances, but for two-way 
spherical transmission losses and with FDA for bat call frequencies with the highest detection range in the UK, 
i.e. at 20–30 kHz:

statistics. 
All statistical tests were performed using R studio (R version 3.1.2.). A two-tailed paired samples 
t-test was performed to compare the number of clicks produced before and after ablation of the aeroelastic tym-
bals. A two-tailed nested ANOVA run as a mixed effects model, with moth individual as the random effect, was 
used to test for differences between the amplitudes of Yponomeuta sounds recorded at different angles. Moth 
individual was nested within the angle at which it was recorded. This was followed by a Tukey post-hoc test with 
Bonferroni correction.
