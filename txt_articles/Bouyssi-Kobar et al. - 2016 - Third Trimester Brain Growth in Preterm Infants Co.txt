BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Compared with term infants, preterm infants have impaired 
brain development at term-equivalent age, even in the absence of structural brain 
injury. However, details regarding the onset and progression of impaired preterm brain 
development over the third trimester are unknown. Our primary objective was to compare 
third-trimester brain volumes and brain growth trajectories in ex utero preterm infants 
without structural brain injury and in healthy in utero fetuses. As a secondary objective, 
we examined risk factors associated with brain volumes in preterm infants over the third-
trimester postconception.
METHODS: Preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) and weighing 
<1500 g with no evidence of structural brain injury on conventional MRI and healthy 
pregnant women were prospectively recruited. Anatomic T2-weighted brain images of 
preterm infants and healthy fetuses were parcellated into the following regions: cerebrum, 
cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity.
RESULTS: We studied 205 participants (75 preterm infants and 130 healthy control fetuses) 
between 27 and 39 weeks’ GA. Third-trimester brain volumes were reduced and brain 
growth trajectories were slower in the ex utero preterm group compared with the in utero 
healthy fetuses in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity. Clinical 
risk factors associated with reduced brain volumes included dexamethasone treatment, 
the presence of extra-axial blood on brain MRI, confirmed sepsis, and duration of oxygen 
support.
CONCLUSIONS: These preterm infants exhibited impaired third-trimester global and regional 
brain growth in the absence of cerebral/cerebellar parenchymal injury detected by using 
conventional MRI.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Third-trimester 
brain development is characterized by critical and 
energy-dependent biological processes needed to 
support optimal brain growth. Available evidence 
points to disturbed brain development in ex-preterm 
infants at term and beyond compared with their term-
born peers.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Third-trimester brain 
growth is disturbed in preterm infants compared with 
healthy in utero fetuses in the absence of structural 
brain injury. Neonatal intensive care likely infl
 uences 
third-trimester brain development in preterm infants.

Despite marked improvements in 
neonatal intensive care, life-long 
neurodevelopmental disabilities 
remain highly prevalent in survivors 
of prematurity. 
1 Brain injury is a 
common complication of preterm 
birth and is diagnosed by using 
conventional neuroimaging 
techniques in about one-third 
of preterm infants. 
2 However, 
the presence of structural brain 
injury alone does not account 
for the frequency and scope of 
neurodevelopmental impairments 
in surviving preterm infants. 
3 Brain 
development can be altered even 
without evidence of destructive 
prematurity-related brain injury. 
4 
Multiple risk factors have also 
been implicated with aberrant 
preterm brain maturation, including 
infection, medication administration, 
and respiratory complications.5 
However, the timing, progression, 
and functional impact of delayed 
brain maturation in the absence of 
structural brain injury remain poorly 
understood.
A growing body of evidence has 
shown that brain development is 
impaired in preterm infants by 
term-equivalent age (TEA) even 
in the absence of structural brain 
injury: compared with healthy term 
newborns, preterm infants at TEA 
exhibit decreased cerebral and 
cerebellar volume, altered cortical 
surface area, 
 
6 
 
– 
9 and microstructural 
organization, 
10 as well as impaired 
functional connectivity. 
11, 
 
12 To 
date, most inferences about third-
trimester brain development in 
preterm infants have been based 
on comparative quantitative MRI 
measures versus those of term 
healthy newborns at a single time 
point at the end of the third trimester 
(ie, TEA). However, these cross-
sectional studies at the end of the 
third trimester were not designed 
to identify the onset and evolution 
of impaired brain development in 
the premature infant. Few studies 
have investigated the third-trimester 
brain maturation in the absence of 
brain injury after early exposure 
to extrauterine life. 
13 
 
– 
17 Moreover, 
another substantial obstacle to 
progress has been the scarcity 
of in utero normative fetal MRI 
studies from which to establish and 
compare departures from normal 
third-trimester ex utero brain 
development.
Recently, we and others have 
successfully applied advanced 
quantitative MRI techniques to 
study in utero brain development in 
healthy fetuses. 
18 
 
 
–22 These studies 
have provided major insights into 
the rate and progression of normal 
second- and third-trimester global, 
regional, and tissue-specific brain 
development in utero. However, 
no study to date has prospectively 
compared in utero brain volume 
in healthy fetuses versus that of ex 
utero preterm infants. The aim of 
the present study was to compare 
third-trimester global and regional 
brain volumes and brain growth 
trajectories in very preterm infants 
with no parenchymal brain injury 
versus healthy in utero fetuses by 
using 3-dimensional volumetric 
MRI measures. As a secondary 
objective, we sought to examine the 
relationship between clinical risk 
factors and brain volumes in preterm 
infants.
METHODS
Participants
We studied preterm infants and 
in utero healthy control fetuses 
recruited prospectively from 
longitudinal observational studies 
performed at 2 medical centers: 
Children’s Boston Hospital (Boston, 
MA) and Children’s National Health 
System (Washington, DC). The design 
of the study was cross-sectional, and 
it included only a single observation 
for each participant.
Preterm Cohort
Very preterm infants born before 32 
weeks’ gestational age (GA) weighing 
<1500 g were prospectively enrolled. 
We specifically excluded any preterm 
infants with known or suspected 
chromosomal anomalies, congenital 
malformations, central nervous 
system infection, and metabolic 
disorders. Also excluded were 
preterm infants with any evidence of 
parenchymal cerebral or cerebellar 
injury (ie, white matter injury, grade 
III–IV intraventricular hemorrhage 
[IVH], cerebellar hemorrhage) 
according to conventional MRI.
Fetal Cohort
Healthy pregnant women with 
normal fetal ultrasounds were 
recruited as normal control subjects 
in a prospective study comparing 
brain development in fetuses with 
congenital heart disease. 
23 
– 
25 We 
excluded multiple pregnancies, 
chromosomal abnormalities, and 
congenital infection.
The studies were approved by 
the 2 institutional review boards, 
and written informed consent was 
obtained from each participant.
MRI Acquisition
Preterm Cohort
Preterm newborns were scanned 
under natural sleep by using either 
a 1.5-T MRI scanner Signa Excite, 
a 1.5-T Discovery MR450 scanner, 
or a 3-T Discovery MR750 (all: GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, MI). Preterm 
infants requiring temperature 
monitoring underwent scanning 
by using a Nomag MRI-compatible 
incubator (LMT Medical Systems 
GmbH, Luebeck, Germany).
Fetal Cohort
Fetal MRI studies were performed at 
1.5 T either on an Achieva scanner 
(Philips Medical System, Best, 
Netherlands) or on a Discovery 
MR450 scanner (GE Healthcare).

For both cohorts, comparable sagittal, 
axial, and coronal T2-weighted images 
were collected by using single-shot 
fast spin echo sequences (2-mm slice 
thickness, 0-mm gap). An experienced 
pediatric neuroradiologist at each 
site reviewed all the MRI studies and 
noted the presence or absence of 
extra-axial blood.
Volumetric Analyses
After visual quality inspection of 
the anatomic images acquired, 
images without motion artifacts 
were selected and corrected for 
intensity nonhomogeneity. 
26 For 
both cohorts, we reconstructed 
3-dimensional images of the brain 
from the 2-dimensional images 
acquired 
27 and used a parcellation 
pipeline 
18 to delineate the brain 
regions of interest. The cerebrum, 
cerebellum, and brainstem were then 
manually corrected when necessary 
by using ITK-SNAP software. 
28 Figure 
1 provides an example of the brain 
parcellation performed in preterm 
infants and in utero fetuses. Volumes 
were computed by multiplying the 
number of voxels included in each 
brain region by the volume of each 
voxel and are expressed in cubic 
centimeters (milliliters). Total brain 
volume (TBV) was defined as the sum 
of cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem 
volumes; the intracranial cavity 
volume (ICV) was the sum of TBV and 
cerebrospinal fluid.
Prenatal and Postnatal Clinical Data 
Collection
Prenatal information, mode of 
delivery, birth weight, GA at birth, 
Apgar score, and sex were collected 
for both cohorts. Additional clinical 
risk factors abstracted in the preterm 
cohort included length of mechanical 
ventilation and oxygen support, need 
for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 
ligation, sepsis (ie, confirmed sepsis 
by positive blood culture), postnatal 
dexamethasone treatment, and the 
presence of extra-axial blood on 
conventional MRI.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were 
summarized by using median, range, 
means, and SDs for continuous 
variables and proportions for 
categorical factors. Linear regression 
models were developed by using 
Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX) to evaluate the relationship 
between global and regional 
measurements of brain volume 
according to GA at MRI in healthy 
fetuses and preterm newborns. 
During model development, we 
evaluated the need for cross-product 
terms to allow for differing growth 
trajectories in the 2 groups and for 
higher order effects to introduce 
curvilinearity if necessary to improve 
model fit.
Within the preterm cohort, linear 
regression analysis was first 
used to evaluate the relationship 
between the presence/level of each 
clinical risk factor individually (ie, 
chorioamnionitis, cesarean delivery, 
PDA ligation, sepsis, dexamethasone 
treatment, number of days ventilated 
/on oxygen support, presence of 
extra-axial blood) and brain volume 
controlling for GA at birth, day of life 
at MRI, and sex. We chose to control 
for GA at birth rather than birth 
weight in the models because the 2 
factors were highly correlated (r = 
0.74) and because GA was judged 
less likely to interfere with risk 
factor identification. Results were 
expressed as regression (slope) 
coefficients with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). We then performed 
a multiple regression analysis that 
evaluated the combined main and 
interactive effects of each of the 
clinical risk factors associated with 
differences in global or regional 
brain volumes. Only those 2- and 
3-way interactions that achieved 
at least a borderline level of 
statistical significance (P < .12) 
were retained in final models; the 
decision on which of the alternative 
models to use to represent the 
combined impact of risk factors 
on brain growth was aided by the 
use of Akaike information criterion 
statistics.

analyses hypothesis-generating and 
thus did not correct for multiple 
comparisons, and we were more 
lenient in choosing terms to include 
in the model to avoid missing 
the identification of potentially 
important risk factors.
RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics of the 
Cohort
A total of 205 subjects were studied: 
75 very preterm infants (birth GA: 
22–32 weeks) with a mean corrected 
GA at MRI of 34 ± 2.5 weeks (range: 
27–39 weeks) and 130 healthy 
fetuses with a mean GA at MRI of 32 
± 3.3 weeks (range: 27–39 weeks). 
All MRI scans in the preterm and 
fetal cohorts were structurally 
normal (ie, had no parenchymal brain 
injury/malformations). The clinical 
characteristics of the cohort are 
summarized in  
Table 1.
Comparisons of Brain Volumes by 
Site
 
Table 2 summarizes the brain 
volumes of the preterm and fetal 
cohorts by site; the ratio of preterm 
infants to fetuses was similar at each 
site. Notably, the few significant 
differences that were present in the 
preterm and fetal cohorts at a young 
age (<33 weeks’ GA) disappeared 
after controlling for GA at MRI.
Comparisons Between Fetal and 
Preterm Brain Volumes
Controlling for GA at MRI and sex, 
brain volumes were lower in preterm 
infants compared with in utero 
fetuses for all the brain regions 
examined (P < .05) ( 
Fig 2). Third-
trimester brain growth trajectories 
by GA at MRI were slower in the ex 
utero preterm cohort compared with 
the fetal cohort for the cerebrum 
(P = .001), the cerebellum (P = .05), 
the brainstem (P = .06), TBV 
(P = .002), and ICV (P = .03).
Preterm Infants: Clinical Risk 
Factors and Impaired Brain Volume
The clinical risk factors were similar 
in the 2 preterm cohorts except 
for length of ventilation ( 
Table 
3). The statistically significant 
relationships between individual 
clinical risk factors and regional 
brain volume when controlling 
for GA at birth, day of life at MRI, 
and sex are summarized in  
Table 
4. Dexamethasone treatment, the 
presence of extra-axial blood, sepsis, 
and length of oxygen support were 
associated with reduced brain 
volumes. We then included the 
aforementioned risk factors in a 
multiple regression model analysis 
( 
Table 5). The 3-way interaction 
effect among dexamethasone 
treatment, extra-axial blood, and 
length of oxygen support explained 
>75% of the reduction in cerebral/
cerebellar volumes, TBV, and ICV. 
In addition, sepsis was significantly 
associated with reductions in 
cerebral volume, TBV, and ICV.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, our study reports 
for the first time decreased third-
trimester global and regional brain 
growth in very preterm infants 
without evidence of cerebral or 
cerebellar parenchymal injury 
compared with healthy in utero 
control fetuses. Using volumetric 
MRI, we found differences in brain 
growth trajectories between preterm 
infants who experience their “third 
trimester” of development ex utero 
and in utero healthy fetuses. Our 
findings suggest that even in the 
absence of structural brain injury, 
the developmental trajectory of the 
preterm brain is altered over the 
third trimester. Evidence of clinical

risk factors associated with reduced 
brain volumes in preterm infants 
included individual and synergistic 
effects of dexamethasone treatment, 
the presence of extra-axial blood, 
the length of oxygen support, and 
confirmed sepsis.
Previous studies suggest that brain 
volumes in preterm survivors 
are altered by TEA compared 
with healthy term newborns and 
are characterized by decreased 
parenchymal volumes. 
9, 
 
31 
 
– 
35 
Alterations in brain volumes at 
TEA in the preterm infants have 
also been correlated with worse 
neurocognitive outcomes. 
36 
– 
38 
Moreover, prematurely born children 
and adults exhibit altered regional 
volumetric brain growth compared 
with their term-born peers39, 
 
40 
suggesting long-lasting consequences 
of early-life disturbances in brain 
growth. 
41 However, to date, 
few studies have investigated 
third-trimester volumetric brain 
development in preterm infants 
and healthy in utero fetuses. Only 
1 recent study (by Lefèvre et al 
42) 
used a retrospective cross-sectional 
design to compare 27 preterm 
infants (birth GA: 25–35 weeks) and 
14 fetuses; the investigators found 
that brain volumes were similar, 
whereas cortical folding trajectories 
were altered in preterm infants 
compared with healthy control 
fetuses. Our data showed reductions 
in brain volumes across the third 
trimester of ex utero life in preterm 
infants compared with the in utero 
healthy control fetuses. Our larger 
sample size (N = 205) suggest that 
we were better-powered to detect 
subtle but important differences in 
regional brain growth. The present 
results extend earlier findings of 
altered brain growth in preterm 
infants by TEA 
9, 
32 and demonstrate a 
progressive fall-off/dysmaturation of 
the brain after preterm birth over the 
third trimester.
The third trimester of gestation is 
a critical period of prolific brain

development. Multiple biological 
processes are actively taking place, 
including the beginning of myelination, 
neuronal organization, spinogenesis, 
and synaptogenesis. 
43 It is well 
established that there is a fourfold 
increase in brain size during the third 
trimester of gestation 
18 accompanied 
by a dramatic increase in brain surface 
area with the formation of tertiary sulci 
and gyri. 
44 This well-orchestrated and 
precisely timed development of the 
neural circuitry may be vulnerable to 
insults associated with preterm birth. 
Longitudinal studies have explored 
the relationship between clinical risk 
factors and neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in preterm born infants, 
including postnatal infections, 
 
45– 
47 
medications, 
 
48, 
 
49 and 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
50 At 
TEA, several clinical risk factors have 
been associated with decreased brain 
volume, including white matter brain 
injury, 
31, 
 
34, 
 
35 respiratory illness, 
 
31, 
 
34 
small birth weight for GA, 
34, 
 
35 
increasing prematurity, 
 
9 and low-
grade IVH. 
9, 
 
51 Our study extends these 
observations and shows that among 
the clinical risk factors examined, 
postnatal dexamethasone treatment, 
the presence of extra-axial blood, 
respiratory illness, and sepsis were 
inversely associated with brain growth 
in preterm infants during the third 
trimester.
We report an association between 
dexamethasone treatment and 
impaired cerebral, cerebellar, and 
brainstem growth during the third 
trimester. Our findings are in keeping 
with previously published research 
suggesting a detrimental effect of 
dexamethasone treatment on preterm 
brain volumes at TEA 
52, 
 
53 and during 
adolescence. 
54 Animal models 
have shown that dexamethasone 
administration during the critical 
developmental period is associated 
with abnormal apoptosis and 
alterations in synaptic function. 
55, 
56 
Respiratory distress in the preterm 
infants results in alterations in cerebral 
hemodynamics that can also lead to 
impaired brain development. 
57 In our 
study, indicators of respiratory illness 
such as the length of oxygen support 
were inversely associated with third-
trimester brain volumes in preterm 
infants, consistent with previous 
findings reported at TEA. 
9, 
 
31, 
 
34
Prenatal, intrapartum, and/
or postnatal infections result in 
inflammatory substances that have 
been linked to both brain injury and 
altered brain development in the 
preterm population. 
58, 
 
59 In this study, 
we also report an association between 
confirmed sepsis and stunted cerebral 
growth. This specific finding contrasts 
with 2 other studies, which found no 
relationship between brain volumes

and sepsis in preterm infants at TEA. 
9, 
 
31 
The severity, time, and occurrence 
of sepsis might play a role in the 
varied findings. Longitudinal data 
sets will allow elucidating whether 
there is a catch-up in brain growth 
by TEA in preterm infants with 
confirmed sepsis. A large, longitudinal 
population-based study has shown 
a negative independent effect of 
sepsis on neurodevelopmental 
impairments at 2 years of age.46 
Conversely, we found no relationship 
between chorioamnionitis and 
third-trimester brain volume, which 
is in agreement with previous 
studies. 
35, 
 
60 Chorioamnionitis has 
been associated with an increased 
risk for developing brain injury, 
 
61, 
 
62 
and it has been especially correlated 
with severe IVH.63, 
 
64 The direct 
influence of chorioamnionitis on 
neurodevelopmental outcome is 
unclear, and it is likely mediated 
by the increased risk of postnatal 
morbidities associated with prenatal 
infection, including brain injury and 
neonatal sepsis. 
61, 
 
65 
–67
The presence of extra-axial blood 
in our preterm cohort was linked to 
decreased brain volumes. Low-grade 
IVH has previously been related to 
decreased brain volumes in near-term 
and preterm infants at TEA. 
9, 
 
51 
Potential mechanisms include free 
radical injury mediated by extra-
axial blood and IVH, which adversely 
affects the proliferating cells and 
leads to subsequent downstream 
events in cerebral and cerebellar 
development. 
68 
–70 Additional studies 
are needed to quantify the effects of 
blood on the developing preterm brain.
Surprisingly, the need for surgical 
PDA ligation was not associated 
with impaired brain volumes over 
the third trimester in the ex utero 
preterm infants in our study. This 
finding conflicts with previous 
literature in which PDA ligation 
was associated with reduced brain 
volumes at term age, 
 
8, 
 
9 but it is in 
line with a recently published study. 
Lemmers et al 
71 postulated that 
the duration of reduced cerebral 
oxygenation associated with PDA is 
likely the main factor responsible for 
brain growth impairment associated 
with PDA ligation rather than the 
need for surgery itself. Ongoing 
research is warranted to address this 
intriguing question.
Our study provides new insights into 
the role of prematurity-related clinical 
risk factors on brain maturation 
during the third trimester in ex utero 
preterm infants with no evidence of 
parenchymal brain injury. Ongoing 
prospective studies are urgently 
needed to better ascertain what 
aspects of neonatal intensive care may 
be harmful versus protective for the 
developing preterm brain. 
72
Our study has several limitations. 
First, the design of the study was 
cross-sectional; thus, the brain 
growth trajectories examined are 
population based (ie, the trajectories 
are computed from a cohort with a 
single observation rather than from 
individuals with longitudinal MRI 
data). Serial MRI scans would allow for 
better delineation of third-trimester 
longitudinal brain growth in normal in 
utero versus ex utero environments, 
and study of this topic is currently 
underway. Second, we combined 
participants from 2 regionally distinct 
cohorts, introducing differences in the 
MRI scanners used and variability in 
clinical care. However, all participants 
were scanned with comparable 
T2-weighted anatomic sequences, 
and we found no significant difference 
after controlling for GA at MRI in 
brain volumes in both fetal and 
preterm cohorts performed at the 2 
sites. Furthermore, the clinical risk 
factors were similar in the 2 preterm 
cohorts. The third limitation relates 
to our sample size that restricted 
the number of clinical risk factors 
we could investigate. We decided to 
include in our multivariate analysis 
only the clinical risk factors that were 
correlated with brain volumes on our 
univariate analysis. Other statistical 
approaches could lead to different 
models; consequently, our results are 
only hypothesis-generating and need 
to be evaluated and confirmed by other 
studies. Moreover, our findings are not 
brain tissue specific. A segmentation 
pipeline applied to this data set could 
provide additional information about 
different tissue types (ie, cortical 
gray versus white matter) that may 
be preferentially affected by preterm 
birth. Finally, although we specifically 
excluded preterm infants with 
evidence of structural brain injury on 
conventional MRI, it is possible that 
smaller brain lesions below the current 
resolution of clinical MRI field strength 
were missed. 
73 Specifically, we cannot 
exclude the presence of white matter 
microscopic necrosis, which can only 
be resolved by using a higher MRI field 
strength (eg, 12 T). 
74
CONCLUSIONS
Our data strongly support the notion 
that preterm delivery is associated 
with disturbances in third-trimester 
global and regional brain growth 
even in the absence of parenchymal 
brain injury. Clinical risk factors 
associated with preterm birth 
and impaired brain development 
include the use of steroids, greater 
respiratory illness, sepsis, and the 
presence of extra-axial hemorrhage. 
Ongoing studies are needed to 
clarify the effects of altered third-
trimester regional brain growth on 
neurodevelopmental outcome.
