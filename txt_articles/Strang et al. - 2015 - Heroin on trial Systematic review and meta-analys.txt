 The prescribing of diamorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) as part
of treatment for heroin addiction initially appears counter-
intuitive. Addiction is increasingly recognised as a chronic
relapsing disorder1 for which effective treatments exist.2 However,
public responses to addiction tend to polarise around addiction
as ‘badness’ or addiction as ‘illness’, and counter-intuitive
treatments often generate strongly felt passions associated with
these differing frames of reference. When debate gets heated, it
is particularly important for science to contribute cool-headed
analysis.

of randomised trials of diamorphine-prescribing
as treatment for refractory heroin addiction{

Background
Supervised injectable heroin (SIH) treatment has emerged
over the past 15 years as an intensive treatment for
entrenched heroin users who have not responded to
standard treatments such as oral methadone maintenance
treatment (MMT) or residential rehabilitation.
Aims
To synthesise published findings for treatment with SIH for
refractory heroin-dependence through systematic review and
meta-analysis, and to examine the political and scientific
response to these findings.
Method
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of SIH treatment were
identified through database searching, and random effects
pooled efficacy was estimated for SIH treatment.
Methodological quality was assessed according to criteria set
out by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Results
Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Across the
trials, SIH treatment improved treatment outcome, i.e.
greater reduction in the use of illicit ‘street’ heroin in patients
receiving SIH treatment compared with control groups (most
often receiving MMT).
Conclusions
SIH is found to be an effective way of treating heroin
dependence refractory to standard treatment. SIH may be
less safe than MMT and therefore requires more clinical
attention to manage greater safety issues. This intensive
intervention is for a patient population previously considered
unresponsive to treatment. Inclusion of this low-volume,
high-intensity treatment can now improve the impact of
comprehensive healthcare provision.

{See editorial, pp. 3–4, this issue.
 Fifteen years ago, Bammer et al3 considered this issue at which
time there was only one randomised trial (from the UK during the
1970s) investigating heroin-prescribing in an unsupervised clinical
situation4 and one small randomised trial from Switzerland of a
new approach of fully supervised self-administration of the
prescribed heroin.5 This latter approach of entirely supervised
administration of every injected dose has become standard clinical
practice in a new generation of well-designed and executed trials –
a further five randomised clinical trials internationally over the
past 15 years (see below).
Diamorphine has been prescribed at different times in
treatment of heroin addiction for more than a century, in
countries that originally included the USA6 and has continued
throughout the century, to a variable extent, in the UK,7 but it
was not until the work of Uchtenhagen and his colleagues in
Switzerland in the 1990s that the approach of supervised injectable
heroin (SIH) treatment was properly established.8–10
Two features characterise the new approach. First, SIH treat-
ment is not a first-line treatment, but an option for patients
who have not responded to standard treatments such as oral
methadone
maintenance
treatment
(MMT)
or
residential
rehabilitation. Second, all injectable doses (typically 150–250 mg
diamorphine per injection) are taken under direct medical or
nursing supervision, thereby ensuring compliance, monitoring,
safety
and
prevention
of
possible
diversion
of
prescribed
diamorphine to the illicit market; this requires the clinics to be
open several sessions per day, every day of the year. This model
of treatment involves screening and appropriate patient selection,
structured induction and monitoring, and a high level of support
and interaction with staff – thus significantly different from the
‘public health’ approach of open-access supervised injecting
rooms.11 In contrast, SIH treatment is a high-cost, low-volume
specialist intervention.
The Cochrane Collaboration has conducted a systematic
review of all heroin-prescribing trials.12 While the Cochrane
review compared ‘SIH treatment plus methadone v. oral MMT’,
based on trials of SIH treatment, a considerable portion of the
reported comparisons have drawn on the findings from a wider
group of heroin prescribing randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
including ‘heroin provision of various modality and route of
administration’, i.e. supervised and unsupervised prescribing
practices and prescribing of both injectable and inhalable heroin.
The aims of this paper are: (i) to undertake a systematic review
and meta-analysis of a defined narrow group of randomised trials
of SIH prescribing and (ii) to examine the political and scientific
response to the published findings.
Method
Search strategy
The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines
(www.prisma-statement.org). The search strategy targeted studies
that reported on the effect of SIH treatment in a range of outcome
domains among individuals with heroin-dependence unresponsive
to standard treatments. Computer-based internet databases used
for this search included MEDLINE (PubMed database), Web of
Science and Scopus. There were no language or publication year
restrictions. The combinations of keywords used in the database
search included ‘addiction’, ‘assisted’, ‘supervised’, ‘dependence’,
‘diacetylmorphine’,
‘diamorphine’,
‘heroin’,
‘maintenance’,
‘prescription’ and ‘treatment’. The initial data searches and
screening
of
irrelevant
abstracts
were
conducted
by
T.G.
Subsequent data checking and searches were overseen by N.M.
and J.S. Lead clinicians and/or researchers who have been at the
forefront of testing and trialling SIH trials co-authored this paper.
Inclusion criteria and selection of studies
The methodology was designed to collect evidence in a sequential
and logical manner. The review has a clear focus on evidence of
SIH treatment efficacy as well as allowing a broad scope for
learning about the scientific and political response to the
published findings. Only studies that had the key search terms
in the abstract and also had opiate use, retention in treatment,
mortality and side-effects as outcome variables were considered.
Thus, methodological papers were excluded. Papers were also
excluded if they were assessing the pre-existing unsupervised
heroin treatment provision, which focused on policy aspects,
which were only reporting profile of trial participants or which
were separately reporting on measures of cost-effectiveness,
community perspectives and patient satisfaction or longer-term
(beyond the trial follow-up period) effects.
Data extraction
Information extracted from each study included the location of
the study, author names, year of publication, sample size, groups
studied, time to follow-up, outcome measures and effect-size
estimates.
Statistical analysis
Mantel–Haenszel
random
effects
pooled
risk
ratios
and
corresponding 95% CI for SIH treatment patients v. comparison
groups were calculated using Review Manager 5.2 for Windows
7 with fuller (compared with the latest Cochrane review of
2011) outcome data. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed
through the I 2 statistic. Lastly, funnel plots were used to assess
potential publication bias for the meta-analyses.
Results
A total of 2599 records were identified using the search terms
(Fig. 1).
All papers were in English language. Table 1 summarises the
six trials included in the review.
In addition to the six main papers from the individual trials, a
broader set of papers is available, reporting other data such as
secondary SIH treatment outcomes, observational longer-term
outcomes, health economic data, family perspectives, community
perspectives and patient satisfaction. Alongside the results of a
meta-analysis of the effects of SIH treatment, this broader set of
papers is outlined, although not integrated in our formal analysis
for the reasons listed in Table 2.
Six randomised trials in six countries over 15 years:
synthesis of findings
In this section, we present the trials in historical sequence. The
early heroin trial from the 1970s4 was not included since this
was not based on the new approach of supervised injecting. The
series of SIH treatment trials commences with the 1998 Perneger
trial in Switzerland, the crucible of the new supervised injecting
clinic approach. All of the new randomised trials summarised in
this article have taken as their study participants chronic
heroin-dependent individuals who have repeatedly failed in
orthodox treatment (either currently still failing in treatment as
evidenced by continued regular heroin injecting, or alternatively
currently no longer engaged in treatment), apart from a
subsample of the German study, and they have included
randomised comparison with the standard treatment of oral
MMT. Generally, the results were consistent and each trial has
6
Strang et al
 Heroin on trial
progressively strengthened the evidence-base for this new treatment
approach.
(a) Switzerland, 1998
This small study (n = 51) was important as the first randomised
trial of this new supervised treatment approach.5 Participants were
studied over a 6-month period of injected diamorphine or oral
MMT. The two groups had equivalent retention, but the
diamorphine-prescribed
group
had
significantly
greater
reductions in illicit heroin use and in crime after 6 months of
treatment. Continued illicit heroin use was self-reported by only
22% of the heroin-prescribed group v. 67% of the control group.
This early trial contributed to establishing the feasibility of the
randomised trial study design, the potential acceptability of the
supervised
injectable
clinic
modality,
the
high
doses
of
diamorphine maintenance that could safely be administered, as
well as the good short-term outcome at 6 months.
(b) The Netherlands, 2003
The two Dutch multi-site randomised trials13 constituted a
significant step-change in the evidence-base, bringing sufficient
sample size (n = 594) and study rigour to reach more robust
conclusions. One of the trials studied the efficacy and safety of
injectable diacetylmorphine (n = 174), the other the efficacy and
safety of inhalable diacetylmorphine (n = 375) and will not be
considered further in this article. Retention rate for MMT at 12
months was higher (85%) than for SIH (72%), but a much larger
proportion of the heroin- prescribed group were ‘responders’ on
the pre-determined composite scale of response (57% v. 32%).
In addition, the Dutch trials showed that SIH was cost-effective
for this target population.44 The study method and the results
from the Dutch trial guided the construction of the later trials
reported in this article.
(c) Spain, 2006
This
small
(n = 62)
randomised
trial
was
undertaken
in
Andalucia14 and found equivalent retention, and significantly
greater reduction in self-reported illicit heroin use in the
diamorphine group at their selected 9-month follow-up point.
Despite the small sample size and the continued reliance on
self-report, these findings provided further evidence of benefit
to previous studies and also contributed the perspectives of the
families of the heroin addicts in SIH treatment.40
(d) Germany, 2007
This multi-site trial15 is the largest conducted to date (n = 1015),
and found slightly higher retention in the heroin compared with
the methadone group. It found greater proportions of the
heroin-prescribed group reporting reduced heroin use and being
‘responders’ on the multidimensional outcome measure. An
advance in this trial was the attention to ensuring good dosage
for participants randomised to oral MMT (thus addressing
concern that the apparent advantage of heroin-prescribing may
be an artefact of suboptimal treatment in the control group). This
trial also incorporated various other study elements (two different
recruitment strands; and two styles of counselling therapy –
neither of which was associated with meaningful differences in
outcome). This trial was the first to include objective laboratory
test results for illicit heroin, but these were not available across
all participants, were only incorporated into the composite score
and were not reported separately.
(e) Canada, 2009
The Canadian NAOMI (North American Opiate Medication
Initiative) trial (n= 226), a two-site randomised trial,16 was the first
of the randomised trials to be conducted outside Europe and was
carried out in severely affected participants not currently in
treatment
but
with
multiple
previous
treatment
attempts.
Significantly higher rates of retention (in SIH or other treatment)
and clinical response scores occurred in those randomised to
diamorphine. This trial also included a small subsidiary arm
(n = 25) that was an exploratory double-masked evaluation of
injectable
hydromorphone
and
which
included
objective
laboratory urinanalysis, and the results showed broadly equivalent
benefits.47
(f) England, 2010
The
UK
three-site
RIOTT
(Randomised
Injectable
Opioid
Treatment Trial)17 was important as the first trial to be conducted
with laboratory illicit opioid test results as the pre-declared
primary outcome measure. This three-way randomised trial
compared two forms of supervised injectable maintenance (SIH
and supervised injectable methadone maintenance) against an
optimised version of oral MMT. Although the sample size was
modest (n = 127 across the three groups), the investigators had
the benefit of the previous trials to guide calculations of sample
size and power, as well as improved laboratory analytical methods
involving assay for papaverine and other components of illicit
heroin.48 Good retention was achieved in all groups. At months
4–6, the heroin-treated group was significantly more likely to
provide urine specimens negative for markers of illicit heroin than
the optimised MMT group. This trial also reported on the speed
of onset of the benefit observed in the heroin-treated group (as
had the Dutch trial), and again benefits were evident within
2 months of treatment.

Effects of SIH treatment
Opiate use outcome data
Across the trials, different opiate use reduction (or abstinence)
outcome measures were used, which prevents exploration of the
pooled results in relation to this outcome. Nonetheless, there
was a positive effect of SIH on illicit heroin use reported by each
individual study.5,13–17
Retention in treatment outcome data
Utilising available data from four studies,5,15,16,17 our meta-analysis
identified a significant advantage of SIH over oral MMT treatment
in retention in treatment: overall RR = 1.37 (95% CI 1.03–1.83),
heterogeneity (P50.00001), I 2 = 91% (Fig. 2). The Dutch13 and
the Spanish14 studies were excluded from the analysis of retention
because of the specific construction of the two study conditions,
i.e. as per trial designs, the participants in the MMT groups had
an automatic right to be offered SIH at the end of the randomised
trial period. The possibility of exclusion of the RIOTT for the
same reason was considered; however, this was not required as
there was no automatic right to be offered injectable maintenance
at the end of the 6-month randomised trial period, even though
there was, in practice, a sympathetic consideration of this request
if it was made.
Mortality outcome data
The six trials collectively identified 16 events of death (SIH: n = 6;
oral MMT: n = 10) resulting in a numerical advantage of SIH

Side-effects data
Taking all side-effects together (serious adverse events probably or
definitely related to study medication), the five trials (the Swiss
study did not report side-effects data) showed a significant higher
risk of side-effects in the SIH compared with the oral MMT
treatment groups: RR = 4.99 (95% CI 1.66–14.99), heterogeneity
(P = 0.25), I 2 = 26% (Fig. 4).
Publication bias
Figure 5 presents the funnel plots to assess potential publication
bias for the meta-analyses. We have restricted this to a visual
inspection of the plots in line with recommendations not to
perform statistical tests of asymmetry where there are a small
number of trials.49 The first two funnel plots (Fig. 5a and 5b)
relate to the outcomes of retention (as reported earlier and in
Fig. 2) and of mortality (as reported earlier and in Fig. 3), and
they indicate that the studies had, respectively, very small and
small standard errors and RR estimates spanning from below 1
to approximately 2. However, with the outcome of side-effects,
the funnel plot in Fig. 5c indicates that the studies included much
more variable standard error estimates, with RR above 10, which
may reflect small sample size or other limitations.
National and international impact on clinical practice
and policy
At the international level, the 1961 and 1971 UN conventions50,51
contain no explicit regulations concerning the prescribing of
diamorphine (heroin) in the context of substitution treatment
provision, leaving it to the competence of national governments
to regulate in this area. National legislation differs greatly between
countries. With the exception of the UK, the development of
regulation by means of law and guidelines around heroin
prescribing for opioid treatment is a very recent matter.
(a) Countries in which diamorphine exists as a medicinal product
(i) Full approval of diamorphine as a medicinal product
(UK).
The medical use of heroin is, and always has been,
recognised in the UK as a legitimate medicine which a doctor
may prescribe for the relief of pain and suffering, as well as for
the treatment of opioid dependence.52,53 However, since the late
1960s, the authority to prescribe diamorphine for addiction
treatment has been restricted to doctors with a special licence

 Heroin on trial
(essentially being addiction specialists), while all medical practi-
tioners continue to have the authority to prescribe diamorphine
for other conditions (e.g. severe pain relief, acute management
of coronary infarction).
(ii) Approval of diamorphine as a medicinal product for the
specific indication of treatment-refractory heroin dependence
(Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark).
In
Switzerland, Germany and The Netherlands, heroin has been given
approved medication status as a legitimate (albeit reserved for
severe cases) opioid substitution treatment. In 2001, injectable
heroin was registered in Switzerland as a medication for
maintenance treatment in opioid dependence, followed by its
inclusion on the list of provisions to be fully paid by health
insurance in 2002; and, finally, a legal basis was obtained through
revision of the narcotic law in 2008.54 A similar process has been
followed and completed over the last decade in The Netherlands13
and in Germany.55 In Denmark in 2008, amendment to the
Controlled Substances Act was adopted, which allowed the
provision of supervised heroin-prescribing and its integration into
the existing therapeutic network as an additional treatment for
long-term heroin addicts.56
(b) Countries which have approved diamorphine for research trials
There are also other countries where, in recent years, approval has
been given for diamorphine to be prescribed within the context of
a randomised trial (e.g. Canada and Spain) – for example, through
approval by the Office of Controlled Substances of Health Canada
and a Section 56 exemption from Canada’s Narcotics Control
Act57 and, in Spain, through Royal Decrees 75/199058 and 5/
1996.59 Approval was granted in 2007 for a similar trial in Belgium
that was recently finalised (no report available yet).
(c) Countries in which diamorphine is totally prohibited and hence
not available as a medicinal product nor as a research medication
Finally, there are all other countries in the rest of the world where
either (i) such treatment appears never to have been seriously
proposed or (ii) heroin-prescribing trials have been proposed
but have then either been blocked or approval has not been
granted (Australia, USA and France).
Discussion
Main findings
A total of six randomised trials from six countries have been
included in this review. Based on the evidence that has been
accumulated through these clinical trials, heroin-prescribing, as
a part of highly regulated regimen, is a feasible and effective
treatment for a particularly difficult-to-treat group of heroin-
dependent patients. Diamorphine hydrochloride (pharmaceutical
heroin) is now registered as a medicinal product for this
indication in five European countries (Switzerland, The Netherlands,
Germany, UK and Denmark). New research is now testing whether
further improvements could be achieved with combination of SIH
and incentive reinforcement (termed contingency management,
CM) or other specific rehabilitation strategies. Following the
conduct of this series of rigorous randomised trials, several
countries have altered research restrictions and there has also been
new regulatory approval and politically supported changes in
narcotics laws of these countries, so that this potentially effective
treatment is now becoming available for at least some of the
patients whose addiction was previously considered untreatable
(and still is, in most countries). An additional option has been
added to the clinical algorithm, which can improve personalisa-
tion of individually relevant treatment provision, to the benefit
of individuals as well as society at large.
Comparison with Cochrane
It is appropriate to compare and contrast the conclusions from the
above analyses with the conclusions from earlier and more recent
Cochrane Reviews.12,60 The original 2005 Cochrane Review60
examined studies published up to 2002 (and with only two of
the studies included in our analysis above) and concluded that,
even though there were some results in favour of heroin treatment,
‘no definitive conclusions about the overall effectiveness of heroin
prescription (was) possible’
. By the time of the later Cochrane
Review in 2011, all six of the above-randomised trials were
included in the new Cochrane analysis,12 and the Cochrane group
concluded that, on the basis of the expanded current evidence,
‘heroin prescription should be indicated to people who (are)
currently or have previously failed maintenance treatment, and
it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up
is ensured’
, while also noting that adverse events were consistently
more frequent in the heroin groups.
However, a major difference exists in the approach taken by
our analyses v. the main approach taken by the Cochrane Review:
the Cochrane group have included all trials of heroin prescribing,
regardless of whether the administration was supervised or for
take-home administration (although with additional analyses later
included along the lines of the above analyses), whereas we have
regarded the SIH approach as a distinct treatment necessitating
its own specific scrutiny and analysis. We consider this distinction
important because we wish to avoid any possible contamination of
analyses, which could result from inclusion of findings from
earlier trials in which supplies of heroin were given to addicts
on a take-home basis. We thus consider it more appropriate to
analyse solely the trials of the new clinical approach of SIH, and
this is the basis of our analyses above. The overall conclusions
are similar, but a clearer and stronger signal emerges from the
more specific narrower approach we have taken.
Obstacles to fuller impact
The introduction of effective interventions, even when demonstrably
effective, can sometimes, at first, be viewed as controversial. SIH
treatment is often viewed thus. A number of concerns have been
raised and we address these in turn.
(a) Concerns about the adequacy of the scientific evidence
This was previously a major obstacle, but has now largely been
addressed by the series of trials described above. All of the trials
have broadly shown similar benefits and in the same direction –
with regard to ‘street’ heroin and other drug use as well as in
secondary outcome domains such as physical, mental health and
social functioning where these have been studied (Spain,38
Germany22,28,29,30,36,41 and Canada34,35). Also, the latest 2011
Cochrane review12 reaches a more positive conclusion on SIH
than the original 2005 Cochrane review.60 However, scientific
questions still remain. The new empirical evidence from random-
ised trials on heroin treatment has mostly focused on short-term
outcome, with the randomisation phase of treatment being a
maximum of 12 months. Nevertheless, longer-term data are
also available from eight extended follow-up studies in four
countries (Switzerland,8,45,56 The Netherlands,26 Spain33 and
Germany21,25,42) with a consistent finding of additional sustained
benefit across a range of different outcome categories. We also
need to learn more about the process and influences on remission
11
 Strang et al
of illicit drug use and elimination of related problems, and, more
importantly, enhanced quality of life and social functioning of
these patients.
(b) Concerns about security, public safety, and potential for diversion
and abuse
Much concern has been expressed over security, public safety and
potential for diversion of prescribed heroin. Three of the
randomised trials have evaluated the impact of newly established
injectable clinics on crime in trial localities: The Netherlands,27
Canada31 and the UK.32 Findings to date suggest no negative
effects of the new supervised injecting clinics on public safety,
and actual reports of growing local public support.
(c) Concern about rebound damage to other treatments
such as oral MMT and rehabilitation
Concern that prescribed diamorphine would preferentially attract
heroin users and would undermine other treatments has not been
borne out. Most of the six trials actually experienced difficulty in
recruiting participants, either failing to reach target recruit-
ment14,16,17 or needing to extend the planned recruitment
time.15,17 It appears that for many marginalised heroin users,
the attraction of prescribed diamorphine is rarely sufficient to
promote engagement in highly structured treatment. Recent
documented
experience20,24,27,40,41,61,62
suggests
that
many
patients attending the new injecting clinics aim at sobriety in
the longer term or return to healthier stability in existing MMT
programmes. However, this still needs to be studied further. A
suitable response to the needs and aspirations of this patient
group will involve investment of collective effort to developing
recovery-oriented heroin maintenance – an approach that will
combine heroin pharmacotherapy and a sustained menu of
recovery support services to assist patients and families in
achieving long-term addiction recovery.
(d) Financial costs
In a context of ever-increasing health costs and competing health
priorities, heroin prescribing might be difficult for governments to
embrace.
Findings
of
international
research19,23,37,44
have
consistently demonstrated a considerable economic benefit of
SIH because of the reduction in the costs of criminal procedures,
imprisonment and healthcare. Different models of possible service
provision of heroin treatment may identify variants of SIH
treatment which are more affordable, and this was being explored
in England63,64 up until 2015 when the central funding for this
new treatment was not renewed
(e) Hijack by campaigning groups
The encouraging findings from the randomised trials has been
picked up by groups campaigning for major changes in the law
and the trials have been described as if they were trials of
legalisation (which they were not). These misrepresentations are
not only misleading but also risk damaging the robustness of
the conclusions and the integrity of the clinical procedures.
This difficulty is not unique to the heroin trials, and it similarly
interferes with objective discussion of harm reduction policies
and
practices;65–67
however,
careful
attention
to
accurate
secondary reporting of the findings of the heroin trials is
important so that they are properly understood and the potential
for advancement properly identified.
(f) Diamorphophobia
A critical concern relates to public and political anxiety about the
acceptability of the idea of heroin being a medicinal product.
While
diamorphine
has
existed
as
a
pharmaceutically
manufactured medicinal product in the UK for more than a
century, the situation is very different in most other countries
where
heroin
is
usually
regarded
as
always
an
illicitly
manufactured
drug
of
abuse
and
addiction.
This
has
contributed to an inability to establish clinical research trials
(e.g. Australia68) and to the refusal to provide continuity of
diamorphine treatment for individuals beyond the end of
trial treatment (e.g. Spain). It is possible that the Canadian
identification of similar benefits with injectable hydromorphone19
may point to an avenue which might circumvent more severe
expressions of such diamorphophobia.
(g) Safety
Several of the trials have reported instances of sudden-onset
respiratory depression in people receiving injectable diamorphine,
at a rate of about 1 in every 6000 injections,16,17 hence well below
the hazard from injecting street heroin but nevertheless producing
clinically critical events. These have all been safely managed with
resuscitation measures, but, as noted in the 2011 Cochrane review,
this necessitates specific attention and emphasises the importance
of supervision of injection by appropriately trained staff.43
This repeated finding warrants fuller study, and future research
will
clarify
whether
it
relates
to
the
medicinal
product
(diamorphine/heroin) itself or to some other aspect of drug-
taking behaviour or drug treatment provision. Some such work
is ongoing.
Next steps
A trial of SIH treatment has been conducted (2011–2013) in
Belgium and future versions of the analysis will be likely to include
data from this trial also, once the findings from this further trial
have been peer-reviewed and published.
Limitations
The key limitation of this review is that the analysis synthesised
the interpretation of the primary data in each paper rather than
considering the primary data directly. Future research could
compare SIH treatment outcomes across these trials for a number
of outcomes by analysing individual patient data generated by the
different research groups.
