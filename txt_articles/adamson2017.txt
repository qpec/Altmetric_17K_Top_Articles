IMPORTANCE Timely receipt of treatment for cancer is an important aspect of health care
quality. It is unknown how delays of surgery for melanoma vary by insurance type.
OBJECTIVE To analyze factors associated with delays between diagnosis and surgery for
melanoma in patients with Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of patients who received a
diagnosis of melanoma between 2004 and 2011 in North Carolina using data from the North
Carolina Cancer Registry linked to administrative claims from Medicare, Medicaid, and private
insurance. Inclusion criteria were incident patients with a diagnosis of melanoma stage 0 to III
and with continuous insurance enrollment from at least 1 month prior to the month of
diagnosis to 12 months after diagnosis of melanoma.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Surgical delay, defined as definitive surgical excision
occurring more than 6 weeks after melanoma diagnosis. Generalized linear models with log
link, Poisson distributions, and robust standard errors were used to estimate adjusted risk
ratios (RRs) to model risk of delay in definitive surgery.
RESULTS A total of 7629 patients were included (4210 [55%] female; mean [SD] age, 64 [15]
years), 48% (n = 3631) Medicare, 48% (n = 3667) privately insured, and 4% (n = 331)
Medicaid patients. Privately insured patients were least likely to experience a delay in
definitive surgery, followed by Medicare and Medicaid patients (519 [14%], 609 [17%], and
79 [24%], respectively; P < .001). After demographic adjustment, the risk of surgical delay
was significantly increased in patients with Medicaid compared with private insurance (RR,
1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.70). Delays were more likely in nonwhite patients (RR, 1.38; 95% CI,
1.02-1.87). Surgical delays were less likely if the physician performing the surgery (RR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.72-0.93) or the diagnosing clinician (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.93) was a
dermatologist as compared with a nondermatologist.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Surgical treatment delays were common but were less
prevalent in patients diagnosed or surgically treated by a dermatologist. Medicaid patients
experienced the most surgical delays. A reduction in delays in melanoma surgery could be
achieved through better access to specialty care and cross-disciplinary coordination.

elanoma is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer,
and its incidence continues to increase in the United
States.1 It accounts for a minority of skin cancers di-
agnosed but is responsible for the majority of associated
deaths.2 The primary treatment for melanoma is surgical ex-
cision, which is often curative. However, depending on depth
of invasion and stage of disease, surgical excision may also in-
clude sentinel node biopsy and systemic and/or radiation
therapy. Whereas dermatologists are principally involved in
diagnosing and treating most melanomas, physicians of nu-
merous specialties including primary care, general or plastic
surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology are often
involved in both diagnosis and treatment. This makes the can-
cer care continuum unique and potentially treacherous for pa-
tients with melanoma given the multiple possible paths that
can be taken between diagnosis and treatment.
Given this complex network of independent and poten-
tially unconnected clinicians, timely and appropriate treat-
ment may be delayed or not received at all. Delays in cancer
treatment can result in increased morbidity and mortality.3-6
In melanoma, a recent study found that approximately 1 in 5
Medicare beneficiaries experienced a delay of longer than 1.5
monthsuntiltimeofsurgery,thesuggestedupperlimitforstan-
dard of care.7,8 Delays were less frequent when patients re-
ceived their initial biopsy or surgical treatment from a
dermatologist.7
Whereas delays in surgical treatment for melanoma have
been studied in Medicare beneficiaries, to our knowledge, no
studies have focused on younger patients (<65 years), who
make up 52% of melanoma diagnoses.9 Health insurance type
has been shown to affect quality of care delivered to patients
with many cancer types; however, it is unknown whether in-
surance type affects treatment delays in patients with a diag-
nosis of melanoma.10-12
Using a unique data set, which links North Carolina can-
cer registry data with insurance claims, we examined the dif-
ference in melanoma surgical delays for patients enrolled in
Medicare,Medicaid,andprivatelyinsuredhealthplansinNorth
Carolina.13 Specifically, we sought to determine whether in-
surancepayer,patient-level,clinician-level,ortumor-levelfac-
tors were associated with delays in surgery. Given the evi-
dencethatdelaysarelessfrequentforpatientseitherdiagnosed
or treated by dermatologists, we wanted to examine factors as-
sociated with receipt of diagnosis or surgical treatment for
melanoma by a dermatologist.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
The University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board
approved the present study. Informed consent was waived due
to the retrospective nature of the study. The data used in this
study were from the University of North Carolina Integrated
Cancer Information and Surveillance System, a data resource
that links cancer data from the North Carolina Central Cancer
RegistrytoadministrativeandclaimsdatafromMedicare,Med-
icaid, and private health insurance plans from across the state.
This data source has been well described for cancer-related
population-based studies.14-18 The cancer registry was used to
identify all melanoma cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2011 and
subsequently linked to claims data. We restricted the sample
to patients between the ages of 20 and 100 years. For study
inclusion, patients had a first or only diagnosis of stage 0 to 3
melanoma. To ensure that we could observe all relevant ini-
tial treatment, patients were required to be continuously en-
rolled in their insurance plan from at least 1 month before di-
agnosis to 12 months after diagnosis. Patients whose diagnosis
was made by means of death certificate or autopsy were ex-
cluded, and identified from the cancer registry. We also ex-
cluded patients enrolled simultaneously in all 3 health insur-
ance types (private insurance, Medicare fee for service, and
Medicaid). Finally, patients were required to have a skin bi-
opsy, defined as either an excision, skin biopsy, or shave re-
moval code, occurring within 30 days before to 7 days after
melanoma diagnosis.
Outcome Variables and Covariates
The primary outcome was surgical delay, defined as defini-
tive surgical excision occurring more than 6 weeks after mela-
noma diagnosis. To assess the potential impact of dermatolo-
gists on the process of care, our secondary outcomes were
predictors of receipt of diagnosis or surgical excision by a der-
matologist. For 2564 (33.6%) of patients, melanoma was di-
agnosed by means of an excision (excisional biopsy) or shave
removal and not a standard skin biopsy. Similar codes can be
used for either an excisional biopsy (diagnosis) or surgical ex-
cision (treatment), making differentiating outcomes challeng-
ing. Thus, to separate definitive surgical excision treatment
from excisional biopsy, we defined definitive surgical treat-
ment as surgical excision (including Mohs excision) within the
window of 7 to 365 days after the date of diagnosis (the eTable
in the Supplement provides the list of codes). We assessed pa-
tient-level and clinician-level characteristics associated with
diagnosis and surgical excision by dermatologists and non-
dermatologists. Age, race/ethnicity, American Joint Commit-
tee on Cancer (AJCC) stage of disease, and tumor site as re-
ported from the cancer registry were included. We did not
includepatientswithAJCCstageIVdiseasebecauseofthehigh
likelihood that delays in this population could have been due
to inoperable tumors. Insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid,
private) was derived from claims. Specialty information was
Key Points
Question Are patients with Medicaid more likely than patients
with Medicare or private insurance to experience delays in surgery
for melanoma?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 7629 patients
who received a diagnosis of melanoma between 2004 and 2011 in
North Carolina, Medicaid patients were significantly more likely to
experience delays in surgery compared with privately insured
patients.
Meaning Medicaid patients are at greater risk of surgical delays
for melanoma.

 derived from the clinician information on the professional and
outpatient claims. Nondermatology clinicians included gen-
eral surgeons, plastic surgeons, and general or family practi-
tioners. Rural vs urban residence was defined from Rural-
Urban Commuting Area codes.19 North Carolina National
Cancer Institute center indicator was derived using zip code
information on the claims. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
was calculated, and those in the cohort with missing data on
this index were reassigned to a value of 0. Given the exclu-
sion criteria, patients in this cohort did not have a diagnosis
of cancer listed as one of their comorbid conditions in the CCI.
Statistical Analysis
Generalized linear models with log links, Poisson distribu-
tions, and robust standard errors were used to estimate ad-
justed risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for diag-
nosis by dermatologist, surgery by dermatologist, and delayed
surgical treatment. For the models, the referent groups were
as follows: younger than 50 years old at diagnosis, female sex,
white race, private insurance, nonrural zip code, diagnosis in
2004, CCI of 0, tumor location on the trunk, and AJCC stage
of 0. Analysis was performed using SAS statistical software,
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). All statistical tests were 2 tailed
with α = .05.
Results
Descriptive Analysis of Cohort
A total of 26 220 unique cases of melanoma were identified
within the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry from 2004
through 2011. After cohort exclusions were applied, there were
7629 cases of melanoma in the analytic sample (Table 1). The
mean (SD) age of the cohort was 64 (15) years, with 98%
(n = 7484)non-Hispanicwhitepatients.Roughlythesamepro-
portions of patients were covered by Medicare (3631 [48%]) or
private insurance (3667 [48%]), while the rest were covered
by Medicaid (331 [4%]). The most common anatomic tumor lo-
cation was the head and neck (2191 [29%]), followed by trunk
(2167 [28%]), upper extremities (1997 [26%]), and lower ex-
tremities (1227 [16%]). The most commonly diagnosed tumor
stages were AJCC stage 0 (ie, melanoma in situ) (3375 [44%])
and stage I (2874 [38%]) melanomas.
Unadjusted Predictors of Delay
Of the patients with a melanoma diagnosis, 16% (n = 1207)
had a delay in surgery of longer than 6 weeks. Privately
insured patients experienced surgical delays the least fre-
quently compared with Medicare and Medicaid patients
(519 [14%], 609 [17%], and 79 [24%], respectively). Older
age (P = .03) and nonwhite race (33 [24%] vs 1174 [16%];
P = .02) were associated with a delay of longer than 6
weeks, as was having a rural zip code (471 [17%] vs 736
[15%]; P = .004). Anatomic location (P < .001) and increased
AJCC stage (P < .001) were also associated with delays in
surgery beyond 6 weeks. Patients diagnosed by a derma-
tologist experienced a delay 16% of the time (n = 982) vs
15% (n = 225) for nondermatologists. Patients surgically
treated by a dermatologist experienced a delay 14% of the
time (n = 608) vs 19% (n = 599) for nondermatologists
(Table 1).
Adjusted Risk Predictors of Diagnosis by a Dermatologist
Dermatologists diagnosed 80% (n = 6121) of the melanomas
in the cohort. Patients older than 60 years were more likely
to receive their diagnosis from a dermatologist than nonder-
matologists. Privately insured patients were more likely to
receive their diagnosis from a dermatologist than Medicare
(RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97) or Medicaid patients (RR, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.65-0.79) (Table 2). Nonwhite patients were less
likely to receive their diagnosis from a dermatologist than
white patients (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94). Patients
located in rural zip codes were less likely to receive their
diagnosis from a dermatologist than patients with an urban
zip code (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93). The proportion of
melanomas diagnosed by dermatologist was lower at higher
AJCC stages. However, dermatologists, compared with non-
dermatologists, diagnosed a higher proportion of melano-
mas at each stage. Patients with a CCI of 1 or more had a
decreased likelihood of being diagnosed by a dermatologist
as compared with patients without documented comorbid-
ity (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97).
Adjusted Risk Predictors of Definitive Surgery
by a Dermatologist
Dermatologists performed the surgical excision in 59%
(n = 4487) of patients (Table 1). There was no difference be-
tween white and nonwhite patients in the frequency of sur-
gical excision performed by a dermatologist vs a nonderma-
tologist. Medicaid patients were less likely than privately
insured patients to have their definitive surgery performed by
a dermatologist (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92) (Table 3). Der-
matologists were less likely to perform surgical excisions on
the upper extremities (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99), lower ex-
tremities(RR,0.89;95%CI,0.84-0.94),andheadandneck(RR,
0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-1.00) compared with lesions on the trunk.
Withincreasingstage,thelikelihoodofreceivingsurgicaltreat-
ment from a dermatologist declined. Charlson comorbidity in-
dex was not associated with likelihood of surgical treatment
byadermatologist.Patientsdiagnosedbyadermatologistwere
more likely to be treated by a dermatologist (RR, 2.40; 95% CI,
2.19-2.62).
Adjusted Risk Predictors of Surgical Delay
Afteradjustmentfordemographicandclinicianfactors,therisk
of surgical treatment delays beyond 6 weeks was signifi-
cantly increased in patients with Medicaid insurance com-
pared with private insurance (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.70)
(Table 4). Other independent predictors of a 6-week or longer
surgical delay included nonwhite race (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-
1.87), lower extremity melanoma (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42)
or head and neck melanoma (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.29-1.71) com-
pared with melanoma on the trunk, and AJCC stage (RR, 1.41;
95% CI, 1.16-1.70 for stage II vs 0 and RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-
1.75 for stage III vs 0). Diagnosis by a dermatologist (RR, 0.81;

lay. Treatment at a National Cancer Institute center was not as-
sociated with a reduced risk of delay at 6 weeks.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to
examine surgical treatment delays in patients with mela-
noma stratified by insurance type. We found that patients with
Medicaidexperiencedmoredelaysintreatmentcomparedwith
privately insured and Medicare patients. Whereas the treat-
ment delay disparity for Medicaid patients is troubling, it is
equally concerning that 17% of Medicare patients and 14% of
privately insured patients experienced delays in surgical care
for melanoma. This highlights a potential practice gap in mela-
noma care. Although our study was not designed to uncover
thecausesoftreatmentdelays,ithighlightsanimportanthealth
care quality disparity. Surgical delays can result in increased
morbidity and mortality, making this an important area of fo-
cusforhealthcarequalityimprovement.3-6Thereisalargebody
of evidence showing disparities in cancer care based on insur-
ance type, including increased wait times, treatment delays,
and increased mortality.12,20-22 This is of particular concern for
Medicaid patients with melanoma, who are more likely to pre-
sent with advanced disease and are less likely to receive
treatment.12
A previous study found that 22.3% of Medicare patients
had a surgical delay of more than 6 weeks; in our study, the
figure was 17% for Medicare patients.7 A notable difference
between our study and that by Lott et al7 is that we were
able to identify the definitive date of melanoma diagnosis.
Perhaps more importantly, we found that 33.6% of melano-
mas were likely diagnosed using shave removal or exci-
sional codes. These codes were not included in the previous
study. This could result in misclassification and potential
bias due to misattribution of biopsy codes, not associated
with the incident melanoma. Although dermatologists also
performed shave removals and excisional biopsies, nonder-
matologists were significantly more likely to use these
codes in our cohort. This likely explains the smaller delay
effect size observed with delays in treatment in our cohort.
By including these codes, we improved attribution between
diagnoses and treatment procedures and reduced potential
misclassification and potential bias regarding risk of delay
by specialty.
As with previous studies, our results show worse mela-
noma-related care for patients who were poor, older, non-
white,orhadlate-stagedisease.23-25Remarkably,wefoundthat
regardless of insurance type, significant surgical delays exist.
These delays may represent an important practice gap in mela-
noma process of care from which 1 of 2 conclusions can be
drawn.Eitherthesuggested6-weekperiodbetweenbiopsyand
excision is a flawed measure of quality, or the health care sys-
tem is systematically failing to deliver high-quality care to a
substantial proportion of patients with melanoma in general.8
It must be noted that whereas the diagnosis of melanoma at
earlier stages can decrease melanoma-related mortality, it is
uncertain whether a delay to surgical excision of 6 weeks has
significant biological implications for patients.26-29 Unfortu-
nately, there is a paucity of population-based studies analyz-
ing the morbidity of delay of surgery for melanoma. As a re-

 sult, no clear guidelines exist to direct clinicians about a safe
interval between biopsy and excision for melanoma.
Limitations
Ourstudyhasseveralimportantlimitations.Thepopulationin-
cludespatientsexclusivelyfromNorthCarolina,whichmaynot
be generalizable to the rest of the United States. Given that we
only included patients who were continuously enrolled from 1
month prior to the month of diagnosis through 12 months after
diagnosis, we are missing those Medicaid patients who fre-
quently cycle on and off insurance coverage. However, exclud-
ing these patients may have biased delays toward the null be-
causeMedicaidpatientstendtohavemoreaccessissuesinhealth
care than Medicare or privately insured patients.30,31 Another
limitation is that we could not identify whether surgical inter-
ventions after melanoma diagnosis were associated with other
conditions not related to melanoma (eg, keratinocyte carcino-
mas). This misattribution would have biased results, leading to
underestimation of surgical delays. Some melanomas, particu-
larlymelanomainsitu,couldhavebeentreatedwithtopicalim-
munotherapy with imiquimod, followed by surgical excision.
Thesepatientswouldhavebeenclassifiedasexperiencingtreat-
ment delay, but this would have been a planned, clinically ap-
propriate delay in care. We were unable to capture all of the po-
tential causes for delays; therefore, there may be some
unmeasured or unknown confounders, which could influence
the results. Also, variance resulting from the clustering of pa-
tients within clinics is not accounted for in our model and thus
our standard errors may be narrower than reality.
Understanding the causes for delay will be important to
find ways to correct this practice gap. Dermatologists diag-
nose a majority of melanomas and are, therefore, the gate-
keepers to the melanoma care process. We found that pa-
tients diagnosed or surgically treated by a dermatologist had
a decreased likelihood of surgical delay. Increasing access to
dermatologistscouldperhapshelpeliminatethistreatmentdis-
parity. However, timely access to dermatologists varies by in-
surance type and many dermatologists do not accept pa-
tients with Medicaid.32,33 Enhanced communication among
specialists involved in melanoma care could help reduce sur-
gical delays. Research should focus on finding the appropri-
ate window between biopsy and excision of melanoma. While
timing is one aspect of receiving quality care, so is receiving
the correct type of care. Future research should also include
examining whether patients with melanoma, regardless of in-
surance type, are receiving appropriate evidence-based can-
cer care.
Conclusions
For patients with melanoma, surgical treatment delays were
common. Patients with Medicaid had the highest likelihood
ofdelays;however,significantproportionsofMedicareandpri-
vately insured individuals also experienced delayed care. Pa-
tients diagnosed or surgically treated by a dermatologist had
a lower likelihood of surgical delays. Delays in melanoma care
could be reduced through better access to specialty care and
cross-disciplinary partnerships to ensure that patients can
safely navigate the treatment episode. Understanding why
Medicaidpatientsreceivelesstimelycareformelanomashould
be given further scrutiny.
