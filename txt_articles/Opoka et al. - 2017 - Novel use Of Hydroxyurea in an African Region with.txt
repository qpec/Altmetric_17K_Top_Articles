Key Points
• Compared with placebo,
hydroxyurea did not increase
the incidence or severity of
malaria events in Ugandan
children with SCA.
• Hydroxyurea provided
significant clinical and
laboratory benefits,
suggesting it will be safe and
effective across sub-Saharan
Africa.
Hydroxyurea treatment is recommended for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living
in high-resource malaria-free regions, but its safety and efficacy in malaria-endemic
sub-Saharan Africa,wherethegreatestsickle-cellburdenexists,remainunknown.Invitro
studies suggest hydroxyurea could increase malaria severity, and hydroxyurea-
associated neutropenia could worsen infections. NOHARM (Novel use Of Hydroxyurea
in an African Region with Malaria) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
trial conducted in malaria-endemic Uganda, comparing hydroxyurea to placebo at
2062.5 mg/kgperdayfor12 months. Theprimary outcomewas incidenceof clinicalmalaria.
Secondary outcomes included SCA-related adverse events (AEs), clinical and laboratory
effects, and hematological toxicities. Children received either hydroxyurea (N 5 104) or
placebo (N 5 103). Malaria incidence did not differ between children on hydroxyurea (0.05
episodes per child per year; 95% confidence interval [0.02, 0.13]) vs placebo (0.07
episodes per child per year [0.03, 0.16]); the hydroxyurea/placebo malaria incidence rate
ratio was 0.7 ([0.2, 2.7]; P 5 .61). Time to infection also did not differ significantly between
treatment arms. A composite SCA-related clinical outcome (vaso-occlusive painful crisis,
dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, or blood transfusion) was less frequent with hydroxyurea (45%) than placebo
(69%; P 5 .001). Children receiving hydroxyurea had significantly increased hemoglobin concentration and fetal hemoglobin, with
decreasedleukocytesandreticulocytes.SeriousAEs,sepsisepisodes,anddose-limitingtoxicitiesweresimilarbetweentreatmentarms.
Three deaths occurred (2 hydroxyurea, 1 placebo, and none from malaria). Hydroxyurea treatment appears safe for children with SCA
living in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa, without increased severe malaria, infections, or AEs. Hydroxyurea provides SCA-related
laboratory and clinical efficacy, but optimal dosing and monitoring regimens for Africa remain undefined. This trial was registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01976416. (Blood. 2017;130(24):2585-2593)
Introduction
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a life-threatening hematological disorder
and among the world’s most prevalent hereditary diseases, with more
than300 000affectedbabiesborneachyear.1Thevastmajorityofthese
births occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 50% to 90% of
children with SCA will die by age 5 years, often without an established
diagnosis.2 The heterozygous sickle gene mutation confers a strong
survival advantage against malaria,3 which explains why the allele fre-
quency is highest in malaria-endemic regions of Africa.1
Hydroxyurea has proven laboratory and clinical efficacy for both
children and adults with SCA.4-7 Its mechanisms of action are multiple
and incompletely understood, but fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction in
erythroid cells is critical for the inhibition of intracellular sickling.
Treatmentalsohassalutaryeffectsonbloodcelladhesion,morphology,
and rheology.8 Further, hydroxyurea is a safe drug for SCA, with low
incidence of treatment-related toxicity and no serious long-term effects
observed to date. Hydroxyurea is currently approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for adults with severe symptoms and by the
European MedicinesAgency for affected adults and children above age
2years.Basedonalargeandcompellingbodyofevidenceaccumulated
over the past 30 years, evidence-based guidelines published by the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of
Health strongly recommend wider usage, including offering treatment
to infants as young as 9 months of age.9
The benefits of hydroxyurea treatment of children with SCA would
be greatest in countries within sub-Saharan Africa, if hydroxyurea were
found to be safe and have its predicted efficacy in these high-burden
areas. However, the effects of hydroxyurea on the presentation and
clinical course of malaria must also be considered. Hydroxyurea

 may directly affect several factors related to the pathogenesis of severe
malaria, with potentially deleterious consequences. Some in vitro and
animal studies suggest that hydroxyurea increases endothelial in-
tracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression,10 which could
enhance parasite adhesion to endothelium,11 and also increases tumor
necrosisfactora levels,12both ofwhichare associatedwithincreased
malaria severity and death.13 Other studies have challenged these
findings,14,15 but definitive human data are lacking. If hydroxyurea in-
duces effects that shift the clinical course in SCA from uncomplicated to
severe malaria, this could increase mortality despite benefits for the
underlying SCA.16 In addition, in low-resource settings, hydroxyurea
may cause neutropenia that could lead to increased severity of the many
bacterial infections commonly observed in African children with SCA.17
In contrast to these adverse effects, it is possible that hydroxyurea
could have beneficial effects against malaria because HbF, which is
increased by hydroxyurea, inhibits Plasmodium falciparum growth in
vitro.18 Hydroxyurea treatment also generates nitric oxide,19 which
protects against severe malaria in animals20,21 and humans.22 With these
contrasting potential mechanisms, the risks and benefits of hydroxy-
urea in a malaria endemic setting remain unknown, and many critical
questions remain regarding the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
hydroxyurea for children with SCA living in malaria-endemic
settings within sub-Saharan Africa.
For these reasons, we conducted a prospective randomized
double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, the Novel use Of
Hydroxyurea in an African Region with Malaria (NOHARM), in
young Ugandan children with SCA, to determine the safety and
efficacy of hydroxyurea in a malaria-endemic region. NOHARM is
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01976416.
Methods
Study design
A detailed description of the study site, design, and procedures was pre-
viously published.23 Briefly, NOHARM was a randomized double-blinded
placebo-controlled clinical trial. Because of concerns about the risks of severe
malaria and infection with hydroxyurea treatment, the consensus among local
experts and the local institutional review board supported a placebo-controlled
trial,despitetheexpectedSCA-relatedtreatmentbenefitsinchildrenwithSCA.It
was agreed, however, that study participants should be given the opportunity to
receive subsequent open-label hydroxyurea, if no danger signal was observed
from the blinded study treatment. NOHARM was conducted at Mulago Hospital
Sickle Cell Clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Kampala has seasonal malaria
transmission, with high outpatient and inpatient burdens. Protocol approval
was obtained from the institutional review boards of the Makerere University
SchoolofMedicine,IndianaUniversity,UniversityofMinnesota,andCincinnati
Children’s Hospital, as well as the Uganda National Drug Authority and Uganda
National Council for Science and Technology.
Study participants
Children receiving care at Mulago Hospital Sickle Cell Clinic were eligible if
they were 1.00 to 3.99 years of age and living within 50 km of the clinic. Study
inclusion criteria included confirmed SCA, weight $5.0 kg, and willingness to
comply with study procedures. Children with severe malnutrition or known
chronic medical conditions, current hydroxyurea treatment, or blood transfusion
in the previous 30 days were excluded. Parents of the study participants gave
written informed consent.
Randomization and masking
Children meeting inclusion criteria completed enrollment and after screening,
were randomized 1:1 to hydroxyurea or placebo by the Data Coordinating
Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital as described.23 Study allocations were
randomly assigned by the statistician, using computer-generated sequences in
block files of 8 participants. Study treatments were supplied with A or B labels,
and the clinical coordinating center staff, study pharmacists, families and
caregivers, and all but 2 members of the Data Coordinating Center were masked
to treatment allocation.
Medications
Study treatment (Addmedica, Paris, France) included oral hydroxyurea
(Siklos) as 1000-mg scored tablets and 100-mg dispersible tablets, or
placebo tablets of identical size and appearance. Treatment was
administered once daily at 20 6 2.5 mg/kg for 12 months, with dose
adjustments in both arms for weight gain and hematological toxicities.23

 Procedures
All participants received standard care for SCA including folic acid, penicillin
prophylaxis, and pneumococcal vaccination. For malaria prophylaxis, chil-
dren received insecticide-treated mosquito nets and monthly sulphadoxine-
pyrimethamine.Studyparticipantswereseenfortherandomizationvisit(month0)
and for scheduled visits at 2 weeks posttreatment initiation, monthly from
months 1 to 4, and at months 6, 8, 10, and 12 for a total of 10 scheduled visits
with monitoring for clinical malaria and toxicities. Caregivers were instructed
to return to clinic or hospital whenever the child was unwell; all febrile
children received malaria testing. After completing the blinded treatment
phase, participants could receive open-label hydroxyurea, as per local Ethics
Committee recommendations.
Measurements
Complete blood counts with leukocyte differential and absolute reticulocyte
count (ARC) were measured at each visit (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan)
plus blood chemistries using a Cobas 6000 analyzer Model C501 (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). HbF was quantified by capillary electrophoresis
(Minicap; Sebia, Paris, France). Malaria was assessed by peripheral blood smear
using Giemsa staining: each slide was read by 2 certified microscopists, with a
third reading to resolve any discrepancies.
Clinical definitions
All children with measured fever (axillary temperature $37.5°C) in the clinic or
fever by history were tested for malaria by microscopy. Children with measured
fever or a history of fever and detectable Plasmodium species infection of any

area. Malaria was treated with parenteral artesunate followed by oral artemether-
lumefantrine, if the child was hospitalized, or oral artemether-lumefantrine, if
the child was not hospitalized. The diagnosis of sickle-related clinical events
followed published definitions,24 with modifications such as pneumonia based
on clinical rather than radiograph findings. Clinical sepsis was defined as
presentation with fever and an unwell appearance, for which IV antibiotics were
given. Full definitions for clinical adverse events (AEs) are provided in Table 1.
Study outcomes
The primary study outcome was incidence of clinical malaria. Secondary
outcomes included the following: (1) a composite of 1 or more SCA-related AEs
(pain, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, or transfusion); (2)
clinical AEs; and (3) dose-limiting toxicities.

 (lowest incidence estimate) and children with severe malaria (highest incidence
estimate) (C.C.J., unpublished data). With these rates of malaria incidence, and
variance to mean ratio 1.7, we estimated that 100 children per treatment arm
wouldprovide90%power(a 50.05)todetectbetween59%and34%difference
in incidence between treatment arms, respectively. Study data were entered into
OnCore and analyzed using R (Vienna, Austria; version 3.2.4). The primary
analysis included all randomized participants per intention to treat, with P , .05
considered significant. Interim analysis for safety was performed after 100
children completed blinded study treatment. The difference in malaria incidence
rate between the hydroxyurea and placebo groups was analyzed using negative
binomial regression. For secondary outcomes, P , .01 was considered sig-
nificant. Continuous measures are described as mean (standard deviation [SD]),
and treatment arms were compared using the 2-sample Welch’s t test, or when
within the same individuals using a paired Welch’s t test. Categorical measures
are described using percent or frequency and compared using the Pearson x2 test
with Yates correction or Fisher’s exact test. Malaria episodes are reported as
mean per child (95% confidence interval [CI]). Time to malaria infection is
described by Kaplan-Meier curves. Groups were compared for cumulative
incidence(ie,timetoinfection)usingGray’smethod,withall-causedeathtreated
as a competing event.25
Results
A total of 213 children were enrolled between 24 September 2014
and 2 October 2015; among these, 208 were randomized to either
hydroxyurea or placebo (Figure 1). One child was later deemed
ineligiblebecauseofanelevatedbaselineALT,sothatchild’sdatawere
removed from the analyzed data set. The treatment arms had similar
baseline demographic, laboratory, and clinical measures (Table 2).
No child had symptomatic or asymptomatic Plasmodium species para-
sitemia at enrollment.
Malaria occurred at a low rate throughout the study, perhaps
reflecting excellent adherence to malaria prophylaxis. Over the 1-year
study period, malaria testing was done for 235 episodes of measured
fever or history of fever in study participants, with only 12 fever
episodes because of malaria. Malaria incidence did not differ between
children prescribed hydroxyurea (0.05 episodes per childper year, 95%
CI [0.02, 0.13]) vs placebo (0.07 episodes per child per year [0.03,
0.16]); the hydroxyurea/placebo malaria incidence rate ratio was
0.7([0.2,2.7],P5.61).Timetoinfectionalsodidnotdiffersignificantly
between hydroxyurea and placebo (Figure 2). All 12 malaria episodes
were because of P. falciparum; 1 child had coinfection with
P. malariae. Three children on hydroxyurea had a total of 5 malaria
episodes,comparedwith7 children on placebo witha totalof7 malaria
episodes (Table 3). The median parasite density was 26 410 parasites
per mL (minimum, 1064; maximum, 193 705). Six of the 12 episodes
of malaria were severe, requiring hospitalization (2 with hemoglobin
concentration ,5 g/dL, 1 with impaired consciousness, 1 with hemo-
globin concentration ,5 g/dL and impaired consciousness, and 2
unable to take oral medication). All 10 study participants with malaria
recovered. In the 12 confirmed cases of malaria, there were 4 episodes
with concomitant clinical AE: vaso-occlusive pain crisis (N 5 3)
and acute chest syndrome/pneumonia (N 5 1). In addition, there were
2 episodes of malaria with concomitant SAE: splenic sequestration
(N 5 1) and bacteremia (N 5 1).
A per protocol composite clinical outcome included 1 or more
SCA-related clinical events (vaso-occlusive painful crisis, dactylitis,

 acute chest syndrome/pneumonia, splenic sequestration, or blood
transfusion). The proportion of children with this outcome was sig-
nificantly lower in the hydroxyurea arm than the placebo arm (45% vs
69%; Table 3, P 5 .001). For individual clinical events, vaso-occlusive
pain and hospitalizations were significantly less frequent with hy-
droxyurea than placebo (Table 3; Figure 3). This difference in
hospitalization rate was largely driven by differences in vaso-occlusive
crises, which accounted for 42% of all hospitalizations. The number
neededtotreattoprevent1hospitalizationwas6.4,whereasthenumber
needed to treat to prevent a SCA-related event was 2.5. No strokes
occurred in either treatment arm during the 1-year treatment period.
Clinical sepsis was more frequent with placebo (12.6%) than hy-
droxyurea (5.8%), but this difference was not statistically significant
(P 5 .14). Blood cultures were positive in only 2 episodes, both for
Staphylococcus aureus, 1 in each treatment arm.
SAEs, defined as death, an acute life-threatening event, or hos-
pitalization for .7 days, occurred equally with 6 in each treatment arm
(Table 3). During the blinded treatment phase, 3 children died (2
hydroxyurea, 1 placebo) and 5 others withdrew from the study. Causes
of death were presumed sepsis (1 hydroxyurea, 1 placebo) and sudden
death,causeunknown(hydroxyurea).In2oftheSAEslistedinTable3,
2 participants had malaria concomitant with bacteremia or splenic
sequestration, as noted previously.
The 2 treatment arms had similar counts of laboratory AEs except
anemia (Table 3). Specifically, low hemoglobin (,6.0 g/dL) occurred
more frequently in children receiving placebo than hydroxyurea,
whereas the frequencies of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and re-
ticulocytopenia did not differ significantly between treatment arms.
Similarly, the frequency of protocol-defined dose-limiting hematolog-
ical toxicities did not differ between treatment arms (Table 3).
Neutropenia was notably rare, occurring only once in only 2 participants
over the entire study.
Children
receiving
hydroxyurea
had
significant
treatment-
associated increases in hemoglobin concentration, MCV, and HbF
compared with those receiving placebo (Table 4). Substantial increases
in HbF were observed for both children below and above the median
enrollment age, despite starting with different baseline HbF levels.
Conversely,childrenonhydroxyureahadsignificantdecreasesinWBC
count, ANC, ARC, and platelets compared with children receiving
placebo (Table 4). The treatment arms did not differ in changes in ALT
or creatinine. Medication adherence, assessed by careful questioning at
each clinic visit, was deemed excellent in both treatment arms.
Discussion
In this prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial
of young children with SCA living in Uganda, hydroxyurea therapy
was both safe and efficacious. The 2 treatment arms did not differ in the
incidence, severity, or other outcomes from malaria infection; in the
incidenceofclinicalsepsisorbacteremia;orinthenumberoflaboratory
AEs or dose-limiting toxicities, including neutropenia. In contrast, the
previously described laboratory and clinical benefits of hydroxyurea
therapy were clearly observed in this young population. The increases
in hemoglobin concentration and HbF levels, along with decreases in
neutrophils and reticulocytes, were similar to values observed in US-
based trials,4-7,26 and the rates of important clinical SCA-related events
suchasvaso-occlusivepainfulcrisisandhospitalizationsweresimilarly
reduced. Taken together, these data suggestthat hydroxyurea shouldbe
strongly considered as an important therapeutic option for young
children with SCA living in malaria endemic areas.

Africa. The study design captured all possible malaria events, with

From 
 blood smear testing for all episodes of current and recent fever. The
incidence of malaria in our cohort was low, suggesting effective
protection by insecticide-treated bed nets and monthly oral malaria
prophylaxis with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine provided to all study
participants, or possibly a decreased risk of clinical malaria in children
with SCA. Some form of malaria prophylaxis for children with SCA
is a standard recommendation in most African countries,27 and
insecticide-treated bed net use for children ,5 years of age in malaria
endemic areas of Africa has increased dramatically over the past
decade, to an average of .60% coverage,28 so the preventive measures
used in this study are similar to those in many other malaria endemic
areas where children with SCA live. However, adherence to these
recommendations is highly variable, so our study findings may not
apply to children withSCA not on malaria prophylaxis and/or not using
insecticide-treated bed nets. Because malaria incidence was low in our
study, the range of relative differences in malaria incidence between
hydroxyureaandplaceboisbroad(95%CIforincidencerateratio0.2to
2.7), but the absolute differences in episodes is small (95% CI, 2-13
episodes per 100 children per year with hydroxyurea vs 3-16 episodes
per 100 children per year with placebo). Hydroxyurea did not worsen
malaria severity, because hospitalizations for malaria did not differ
between treatment arms, and no child died of malaria. Because of the
low malaria incidence, this study does not provide definitive guidance
regardingthesafetyofhydroxyureainallmalariaendemicareas,butthe
lack of increased risks of malaria incidence, severity, and outcome is
reassuring. The incidence of malaria in these children with SCA further
suggests that absolute differences in malaria risk with hydroxyurea will
be very small. However, risks of hydroxyurea may differ in areas of
higher malaria transmission, and genetic or environmental factors in
other areas could affect risk of hydroxyurea toxicity or malaria-
hydroxyurea interactions. In light of the present study data showing
efficacy of hydroxyurea against pain crises and hospitalizations, with
no evidence of increased malaria or infection risk in this area of low
malaria transmission, it may be difficult to justify additional placebo-
controlled trials in areas of higher malaria transmission. If additional
placebo-controlled studies are not conducted, future studies of open-
label hydroxyurea in other malaria endemic regions should carefully
document the rates and complications of malaria during hydroxyurea
treatment.These data will helpdetermine the long-termsafety profile of
hydroxyurea for children living in malaria-endemic regions.
All 5 of the study children hospitalized with severe malaria (1 child
was hospitalized twice) survived, in contrast to an earlier study from

From 
 Kenya in which 4 of 5 children with SCA hospitalized for severe
malaria died (80% mortality).16 The presence of malaria parasites on
peripheral blood smear also did not increase the risk of death during
hospitalization, contrasting with a Tanzanian study of children with
SCA, which reported increased mortality in hospitalized children with
parasitemia.29In contrast,anotherstudyfromKenya reported no deaths
among 38 children with SCA and severe malarial anemia, the most
common form of severe malaria affecting these children.30Similarly,in
a recent study in Kampala conducted by our group, none of 22 children
with SCA who developed severe malarial anemia died.31 Together,
these study findings cast doubt on the contention that severe malaria
causes high rates of mortality in children with SCA. In the first 2 studies
cited, which described increased mortality from malaria in children
with SCA, malaria prophylaxis was either not given routinely16 or
consisted of chloroquine.29 The sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine prophy-
laxisgivenin thepresentstudyis likely more effective than chloroquine
prophylaxis. In addition, the 2 studies were conducted during a period
ofmuchlowerbednetcoverage,andasignificantproportionofchildren
in these earlier study cohorts received chloroquine or sulfadoxine-
pyrimethamine for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, instead of the
more effective current standard of care, artemisinin-combination ther-
apy. Together, these factors may have played a role in the higher
mortality seen with malaria in these prior cohorts.
Increased infection in children with drug-induced neutropenia was
an additional concern regarding hydroxyurea treatment in an area
where invasive bacterial infection is common in children. However,
neutropenia was rare in NOHARM and did not differ on hydroxyurea
vs placebo treatment, and episodes of pneumonia, clinically defined
sepsis, and bacteremia did not differ between hydroxyurea or placebo
treatment arms. These data confirm findings observed in the United
States5 and should help allay safety concerns about hydroxyurea and
infection risk related to neutropenia in low-resource settings.

From 
 Hydroxyurea was also associated with significantly fewer SCA-
related clinical events, specifically vaso-occlusive crises, dactyli-
tis, and hospitalizations. Other laboratory outcomes of long-term
clinical importance for children with SCA, including increases
in hemoglobin concentration and HbF, as well as decreases in
leukocyte, neutrophil, and reticulocyte counts, were all more fa-
vorable in children receiving hydroxyurea than placebo, further
supporting the drug’s efficacy in this study population. Despite the
differences in nutritional status from US-based populations, as
evidenced by the low baseline Z scores, the hydroxyurea re-
sponses were remarkably similar to published results in the BABY
HUG trial for both clinical and laboratory effects.5 The poten-
tial benefits of hydroxyurea treatment on growth in NOHARM
are also important to assess but have not yet undergone formal
analysis.
After the double-blinded treatment phase, the entire NOHARM
cohort was offered open-label hydroxyurea as per the study
design, and all but 1 family opted for treatment. Future analysis
can thus compare the effects of early initiation and the longer-
term effects of treatment. Because hydroxyurea escalated to
maximum tolerated dose is standard in the United States,7,25
additional studies should assess how SCA-related AEs and he-
matological responses compare for children receiving fixed-dose
treatment vs dose escalation regimens. Outcomes were excellent
in the present study with a safe and relatively easily administered
fixed dose (20 mg/kg), so it will be important to investigate
how treatment benefits and risks differ with different dosing
schemes of hydroxyurea for children with SCA living in malaria-
endemic areas. Children in African countries often have limited
access to health care facilities, and those facilities typically have
limited laboratory testing capability. Less frequent laboratory
monitoring would allow wider implementation of hydroxyurea
treatment.
Additional studies that include longer duration of hydroxyurea
in malaria-endemic areas will help determine optimal drug dosing,
the range of AEs, and malaria incidence in areas with higher malaria
transmission. Until then, the present study documents that with
adequate monitoring, mosquito nets, and malaria prophylaxis,
fixed-dose hydroxyurea treatment of children with SCA in malaria-
endemic areas is safe with no increased incidence of malaria, sepsis,
bacteremia, or SAEs. In combination with the observed clinical
efficacy (fewer painful events and hospitalizations), the NOHARM
study findings support the wider use of hydroxyurea for children
with SCA living in malaria-endemic regions across sub-Saharan
Africa.
