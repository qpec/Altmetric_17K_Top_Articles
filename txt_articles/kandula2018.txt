IMPORTANCE In light of the excellent long-term survival of childhood cancer patients, it is
imperative to screen for factors affecting health, function, and quality of life in long-term
survivors.
OBJECTIVE To comprehensively assess chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in
childhood cancer survivors to define disease burden and functional effect and to inform
screening recommendations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional observational study, cancer
survivors who were treated with chemotherapy for extracranial malignancy before age 17
years were recruited consecutively between April 2015 and December 2016 from a single
tertiary hospital-based comprehensive cancer survivorship clinic and compared with healthy
age-matched controls. Investigators were blinded to the type of chemotherapy. A total of
169 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 48 (28.4%) were unable to be contacted or
declined participation.
EXPOSURES Chemotherapy agents known to be toxic to peripheral nerves.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The clinical peripheral neurological assessment using the
Total Neuropathy Score was compared between recipients of different neurotoxic
chemotherapy agents and control participants and was correlated with neurophysiological,
functional, and patient-reported outcome measures.
RESULTS Of the 121 childhood cancer survivors included in this study, 65 (53.7%) were male,
and the cohort underwent neurotoxicity assessments at a median (range) age of 16 (7-47)
years, a median (range) 8.5 (1.5-29) years after treatment completion. Vinca alkaloids and
platinum compounds were the main neurotoxic agents. Clinical abnormalities consistent with
peripheral neuropathy were common, seen in 54 of 107 participants (50.5%) treated with
neurotoxic chemotherapy (mean Total Neuropathy Score increase, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.4-2.9;
P < .001), and were associated with lower limb predominant sensory axonal neuropathy
(mean amplitude reduction, 5.8 μV; 95% CI, 2.8-8.8; P < .001). Functional deficits were seen
in manual dexterity, distal sensation, and balance. Patient-reported outcomes demonstrating
reduction in global quality of life and physical functioning were associated with the Total
Neuropathy Score. Cisplatin produced long-term neurotoxicity more frequently than vinca
alkaloids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinical abnormalities attributable to peripheral neuropathy
were common in childhood cancer survivors and persisted long term, with concurrent deficits
in patient-reported outcomes. Both the type of neurotoxic agent and a targeted clinical
neurological assessment are important considerations when screening survivors for
long-term neuropathy. Further development of peripheral neuropathy–specific pediatric
assessment tools will aid research into neuroprotective and rehabilitative strategies.

 T
he changing landscape of childhood cancer treatment
over the last 6 decades has seen the improvement of
childhood and adolescent cancer survival rates to 80%
or greater for many cancer types.1,2 A child who survives 5 or
more years after cancer diagnosis has a life span comparable
with other persons of their age.3 In view of this excellent long-
termsurvival,itisimportanttocharacterizethelong-termmor-
bidityfromcancertreatmentinthecontextofasignificantbur-
den of long-term health conditions in childhood cancer
survivors (CCS).4-6
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is
a potentially long-lasting adverse effect of commonly used
chemotherapy agents in pediatric practice, principally
vincristine and other vinca alkaloids, cisplatin, and
carboplatin.7 To our knowledge, long-term outcomes of
peripheral neuropathy from these agents in children remain
to be fully delineated. Neuromuscular impairment and
restricted participation in daily activities are observed in
CCS,8-10 and persistent deficits in fundamental motor skills
are demonstrable in children following completion of cancer
treatment.11 Multiple factors, such as obesity, poor bone
health, and psychosocial health, may be part of a complex
interaction that limits physical activity, which in turn per-
petuates and maintains long-term health conditions.4,5,12,13
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy may be a key
factor contributing to reduced physical performance, and
defining its effect is an important consideration in the design
of any interventional programs. While other studies have
demonstrated physical limitations in CCS,8,9,14,15 this study
aims to extend these findings by providing a comprehensive
multimodality evaluation of CIPN in long-term survivors
of extracranial childhood cancer across multiple cancer
types to define the disease burden and its functional effect
as well as to inform recommendations for screening in this
population.
Methods
Childhood cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy for
extracranial malignancy before the age of 17 years at the Kids
Cancer Centre, Sydney Children’
s Hospital, Sydney, Austra-
lia, were recruited consecutively between April 2015 and
December 2016 from the long-term follow-up clinic. Patients
with other causes of peripheral neuropathy, such as diabe-
tes, history of critical illness neuropathy, known inherited
neuropathic conditions, or other neurodevelopmental disor-
ders, were excluded. The study was approved by the Sydney
Children’
s Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee. Written informed consent was obtained from each
participant or their parent/guardian in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Acomprehensiveneurotoxicityassessmentwascarriedout
with each participant. For participants younger than 17 years,
this included the pediatric-modified Total Neuropathy Score
(TNS) for clinical measures, the Movement Assessment Bat-
tery for Children (MABC) for functional measures, nerve con-
duction studies for neurophysiological measures, and the Pe-
diatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales (PedsQL)
andthePediatricOutcomesDataCollectionInstrument(PODCI)
for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. For partici-
pants 17 years or older, this included the TNS clinical version
for clinical measures, Von Frey monofilaments, grating orien-
tation task, and grooved peg board task for functional mea-
sures, nerve conduction studies for neurophysiological mea-
sures, and the European Organisation for Research and
TreatmentofCancer(EORTC)quality-of-lifequestionnaireand
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy question-
naire (CIPN20) for PRO measures (eMethods and eTable 1 in
the Supplement). Investigators were blinded to the type of
chemotherapy.
Statistical analyses were conducted in consultation with
abiostatisticianusingSPSSStatisticsversion23(IBM)andPrism
version 7 (GraphPad). Comparisons used 2-tailed t tests and
Mann-Whitney U tests for nonparametric subgroup analyses,
χ2 tests for nominal data, 1-way analysis of variance for mul-
tiple groups, and Pearson or Spearman (small or ordinal data
sets) correlations. Results are stated as means with standard
deviations, and a P value less than .05 was considered signifi-
cant. Bonferroni-corrected P values were used for correla-
tions with multiple PROs.
Results were compared with healthy age-matched con-
trols (age range, 6-56 years) or established population refer-
ence ranges for pediatric functional and PRO measures
(eMethods and eTable 2 in the Supplement). In addition to
group-level comparisons, individual item variance for each
participant’
s performance was calculated using the follow-
ing formula: (control mean time − participant time) / control
standard deviation. The 1-sample t test was used to compare
the group variances with 0. The participant group mean was
compared with the population mean and expressed as mean
standard deviations above or below the population mean.
Hierarchical linear regression models of neurophysiological
and PRO measures with stepwise inclusion of predictive
variables that may assist in screening CCS, including demo-
graphic, malignancy, and treatment variables, as well as
concurrent clinical, neurophysiological, and functional
outcomes were constructed to determine effect size (R2
increase) of each variable.
Key Points
Question What is the disease burden and functional effect of
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in childhood cancer
survivors?
Findings In this cross-sectional study including 121 childhood
cancer survivors, long-term deficits in clinical, electrophysiological,
and functional measures of peripheral neuropathy were common,
and concurrent deficits in patient-reported outcome measures
suggest a significant effect. Cisplatin has a greater neurotoxicity
profile than vinca alkaloids.
Meaning Both the type of neurotoxic agent used and a targeted
clinical neurological assessment are important considerations
when screening childhood cancer survivors for long-term
neuropathy.

 Results
A total of 169 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 48
(28.4%) were unable to be contacted or declined participa-
tionbecauseofcompetingappointmentsornotwantingtopar-
ticipate in research. Neurotoxicity assessments were con-
ducted in 121 CCS, of whom 65 (53.7%) were male, at a median
(range) age of 16 (7.0-47.0) years, including 107 (88.4%) who
received neurotoxic chemotherapy agents and 14 (11.6%) who
receivedaprotocolwithnoneurotoxicagents.Exposuretoche-
motherapy occurred a median (range) age of 4 (0-17.5) years,
and the participants were tested a median (range) 8.5 (1.5-
29.0)yearsaftercompletionoftheirtreatment(Table1).Demo-
graphic characteristics are described for the entire cohort of
121 participants, but comparisons for all CIPN parameters were
carried out between individual subgroups (ie, CCS who re-
ceived neurotoxic chemotherapy vs controls or CCS who did
not receive neurotoxic chemotherapy vs controls).
Radiotherapy exposure was seen in 50 of 107 CCS (46.7%)
who received neurotoxic chemotherapy; 12 (11.2%) had cra-
nial or craniospinal irradiation, 25 (23.4%) had extracranial in-
volved-field irradiation, 12 (11.2%) had total body irradiation,
and 1 (0.9%) had both cranial and total body irradiation. Ad-
ditionally, 21 CCS (19.6%) who received neurotoxic chemo-
therapy also received a bone marrow transplant. Twenty CCS
(18.7%) had a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) in the over-
weight category (>25), and 4 (3.7%) were in the obese cat-
egory (>30).
Vinca alkaloids were the most commonly used neuro-
toxic chemotherapy agent and were used in 86 of 121 CCS
(71.1%), of whom 81 (66.9%) received vincristine as the sole
neurotoxic agent and 5 (4.1%) received multiple vinca alka-
loids. Platinum agents were prescribed to 20 CCS (16.5%),
including 7 (5.8%) who received cisplatin, 7 (5.8%) who
received carboplatin, and 6 (5.0%) who received cisplatin
and carboplatin; 7 (5.8%) were prescribed platinum agents as
the only neurotoxic therapy and 13 (10.7%) were prescribed
platinum agents in combination with vinca alkaloids. Tha-
lidomide was the sole neurotoxic agent in 1 participant
(0.8%). Numbers of patients, age, and sex distributions for
the CCS and controls in the adult and pediatric age groups
for each of the CIPN parameters are presented in eTable 2 in
the Supplement.
Clinical Findings
Participants treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy demon-
strated a significant increase in signs and symptoms of neu-
ropathy as assessed via the TNS (mean [SD; range] score: CCS,
2.9 [3.2; 0-14]; controls, 0.8 [1.0; 0-4]; P < .001) (Table 2). Total
Neuropathy Score abnormalities were present in 53 of 100 CCS
(53.0%)treatedwithneurotoxicchemotherapyand5of36con-
trols (14%). More prominent abnormalities of the peripheral
clinical neurological assessment (TNS > 3) were more preva-
lent in CCS treated with a cisplatin-containing protocol (10 of
12 [83%]) compared with CCS treated with vinca alkaloids (23
of 80 [29%]), CCS treated with carboplatin without cisplatin
(2 of 7 [29%]), CCS who did not receive any neurotoxic agents
(2 of 13 [15%]), or controls (1 of 36 [3%]) (P = .001).
Neurophysiological Findings
The lower limb sural sensory amplitudes were smaller in CCS
exposed to neurotoxic chemotherapy compared with age-
matched controls (mean reduction, 5.8 μV; 95% CI, 2.8 to 8.8;
P < .001) suggesting a reduced number of functioning axons
(Table 2). In comparison, no significant reduction was seen in
the sural amplitude in CCS not exposed to neurotoxic chemo-
therapy (mean reduction, 0.4 μV; 95% CI, −6.7 to 5.9; P = .90).
A sural amplitude below the mean (SD) control recording
of 23.3 (7.8) μV was observed in 65 of 85 CCS (76%) treated with
neurotoxic agents (Figure 1). Compared with population ref-
erencevalues,asuralamplitudebelowtheage-appropriateref-

 erence ranges was noted in 20 CCS (24%) treated with neuro-
toxic chemotherapy (12 of 66 [18%] with vinca alkaloids and
7of18[39%]withplatinumagents).16-18Atotalof14of85(16%)
had an abnormal sural amplitude as well as an abnormal TNS,
fulfilling criteria for peripheral neuropathy.19 No significant
difference was observed in the sural sensory conduction ve-
locity (0.9 m/s; 95% CI, −1.3 to 3.1; P = .40).
In contrast, there were no significant differences in mo-
toramplitudesbetweenCCStreatedwithneurotoxicagentsand
controls, including amplitudes from the tibial nerve to abduc-
tor hallucis (−0.4 mV; 95% CI, −2.0 to 1.2; P = .60) and the pe-
roneal nerve to extensor digitorum brevis (−1.0 mV; 95% CI,
−2.1 to 0.2; P = .09). Comparable values were also obtained for
the upper limb median (SD) sensory amplitudes for CCS (60.2
[28.0] μV) and controls (61.6 [21.9] μV) (P = .80). Individu-
ally,comparedwithpopulationreferenceranges,abnormalval-
ues were seen in 1 of 85 CCS (1%) for tibial motor amplitude,
3 of 44 (7%) for peroneal motor amplitude, and 4 of 103 (3.9%)
for median sensory amplitude. All but 1 CCS with abnormali-
ties in other nerves also had an abnormal sural amplitude.
Functional Assessment Findings
In child and adolescent participants, there was no significant
difference between CCS treated with neurotoxic agents and
population references in the mean (SD) combined score per-
centiles of manual dexterity (43.2 [28.6]), aiming and catch-
ing (56.4 [30.1]), or balance (46.2 [31.8]) using the MABC. How-
ever, 2 of 3 individual manual dexterity tasks and 1 of 3 balance
tasks demonstrated impairment in CCS (Table 2; Figure 2).
In adult participants, impaired performance was seen in
the neurotoxic group compared with controls in distal sen-
sory and motor tasks using Von Frey monofilaments testing
light touch sensation (increased threshold, 0.1 mN; 95% CI,
0.03 to 0.2; P = .01), the grating orientation task testing cuta-
neous spatial resolution (increased threshold, 0.7 mm; 95% CI,
0.1 to 1.2; P = .003), and the grooved peg board testing manual
dexterity (increased time to completion, 5.9 seconds; 95% CI,
1.6 to 10.1; P = .008) (Table 2; Figure 2). This translates to a dif-
ference of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 SDs, respectively, compared with
controls.Additionalmatchingforsexforthegroovedpegboard,

main (−0.4 SD; 95% CI, −0.8 to −0.1; P = .008). In compari-
son, child/adolescent self-report demonstrated impairment in

Inadultparticipantsintheneurotoxicgroup,greatersymp-

were evident in all domains of the EORTC quality-of-life ques-
tionnaire (reduced physical functioning, 5.0 points; 95% CI,

ment). The 14 participants not exposed to chemotherapy
(8 child and adolescent participants and 6 adult participants)
were not different from controls in any of the domains.
Correlations
The clinical findings (TNS) were associated with the neuro-
physiological findings as well as the PRO measures for child
and adolescent CCS (lower limb sural amplitude: Pearson cor-
relation coefficient [r] = −0.33; P = .002; parent-reported Ped-

tive correlation between the parent-reported and self-

sport and physical function (r = 0.66; P < .001) domains.
Adult and pediatric functional outcomes did not corre-
late with TNS, neurophysiological, or PRO measures. Impor-
tantly, no correlation was seen between vincristine dose and
TNS or neurophysiological measures.
Risk Factors and Predictors

as well as neurophysiological outcomes, making it a valuable

 variate analysis, radiotherapy (any location), sural ampli-
tude, and TNS were the most probable significant predictors
of PROs. Multivariate hierarchical linear regression demon-
strated that the TNS was able to predict 25.6% of variability
in parent-reported PedsQL scores (R2 = 0.38; β coeffi-
cient = −0.54; P < .001) and 22.6% in self-reported PedsQL
scores(R2 = 0.24;βcoefficient = −0.52;P = .001),28.6%inpar-
ent-reported PODCI sport and physical function domain
(R2 = 0.40; β coefficient = −0.57; P < .001), and 46.5% in
the EORTC CIPN20 questionnaire (R2 = 0.47; β coeffi-
cient = 0.77; P < .001). The TNS was also the only significant
predictor of neurophysiological (sural amplitude) outcomes,
predicting 10% of the variability (R2 = 0.09; β coeffi-
cient = −0.32; P = .004) (Table 3). Importantly, age at diagno-
sis, time since completion of treatment, body mass index, type
of malignancy, type of chemotherapy, and bone marrow
transplantation were not predictive of neurophysiological or
patient-reported deficits.
Discussion
Comprehensive, multimodal assessment of long-term survi-
vors of extracranial childhood malignancy identified coher-
entabnormalitiesattributabletoCIPNacrossobjectiveandsub-
jective measures. This study included participants who
received multiple forms of treatment for a wide range of can-
cer types, increasing the generalizability of the findings. Clini-
cal abnormalities are common and evident early in CCS and
are accompanied by an overall reduction in the number of

sory axonal neuropathy. Abnormalities are more prevalent fol-
lowing exposure to cisplatin, suggesting a greater neurotox-
icityprofile.Clinicalabnormalitieswerecorrelatedwithdeficits
in PROs and QOL, suggesting that these changes are clinically
relevant and important to monitor in CCS. There may be mul-
tiple risk factors that predispose CCS to the development of
CIPN, including the type of neurotoxic agent and a genetic pre-
disposition,andfurtherdelineationoftheseriskfactorsiscriti-
cal to neuroprotective strategies.7,20 Recent evidence of ben-
efit from targeted exercise intervention in pediatric inherited
neuropathy provides the rationale for further similar thera-
peutic research in patients with CIPN.21
Thewidespreadreductioninsuralamplitudefollowingex-
posure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, with 23.5% of CCS be-
low population reference ranges, suggests an irreversible re-
duction in the number of functioning axons. This reduction
is not evident in the CCS subgroup not exposed to neurotoxic
chemotherapy. In contrast to the predominantly motor acute
vincristine neuropathy reported in children,22,23 our study
identifiedapredominantlysensorylong-termneuropathywith
both vinca alkaloids and platinum agents, similar to findings
in adults.24 This may be due to lack of protection from the
blood-nerve barrier in the sensory dorsal root ganglia25 as well
as an underappreciation of acute sensory manifestations dur-
ing chemotherapy treatment in the pediatric population. Ad-
ditionally, long-term negative sensory symptoms, such as
numbness, may not be recognized if present from an early age.

 Electrophysiological assessments by Jain et al26 within 3 years
and by Ramchandren et al15 within 7 years after completion
of treatment report a predominantly motor neuropathy. Both
studies lacked a control group and used exceptionally broad
referencerangesforthesuralamplitude,27whichmayhavepre-
cluded the recognition of a sensory neuropathy. A larger study
by Tay et al28 reported a mixed motor and sensory neuropa-
thy 4 years after completion of vincristine treatment in 68.3%
of patients. The predominantly sensory neuropathy that we
observed in a smaller proportion of vincristine-treated par-
ticipantsatalongermedianfollow-upof8.5yearssuggeststhat
neural recovery from acute vincristine injury occurs over sev-
eral years and that motor nerves may recover better than sen-
sory nerves. The concurrent presence of sensory neuropathy
in all but 1 patient with abnormal motor studies in our cohort
reinforces the long-term susceptibility of sensory nerves, with
additional motor nerve involvement in some cases.

Platinum agents have been shown to be toxic to the cell bodies
in the dorsal root ganglia, causing anterograde neuronal loss
rather than the retrograde axonopathy described with vinca al-
kaloids,whichmaybemoreamenabletorecovery.36,37Whilecar-
boplatinisgenerallyconsideredlessneurotoxicthancisplatin,38
some of the CCS receiving carboplatin had comparable neuro-
toxicity with those receiving cisplatin. However, its neurotox-
icityinisolationisdifficulttoascertainbecauseofthesmallnum-
ber of patients in this cohort receiving carboplatin alone.
The reduction in the number of residual axons in this co-
hort suggests a smaller axonal reserve following exposure to
neurotoxic chemotherapy. The natural history of aging in-
volves a reduction in axonal responses over the life span,17,39
which, in the context of a reduced axonal reserve, may confer
a greater susceptibility to reduced function at an earlier age.
Childhoodcancersurvivorsarealsoatanincreasedriskofmeta-
bolic syndrome and diabetes.13,40,41 Diabetes is one of the lead-
ing causes of peripheral neuropathy worldwide, and it is being
increasingly recognized that impaired glucose tolerance, pre-
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity can also manifest
peripheral neuropathy.42-44 Consequently, CCS may be at a
greaterriskofdiabeticandprediabeticneuropathy,andthisun-
derscorestheneedforvigilanceinthispopulationaswellasthe
importance of screening for early signs of peripheral neuropa-
thy.Chemotherapy-inducedperipheralneuropathy–relatedim-
pediments in physical function may also result in a reduced in-
clination for regular exercise, adding a further metabolic and
cardiovascular risk factor.
From a functional perspective, reduced manual dexterity
and distal sensation were seen in children and adults on objec-
tive testing. Behavioral sciences literature suggests the use of
0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 SDs to demonstrate meaningful clinical dif-
ferences of small, moderate, and large effect size, respectively.
This would suggest that the 0.4 to 0.8 SD deficits observed in
thegenerichealth-relatedQOLandspecificneuropathyparent-
reported and patient-reported outcomes may have clinical
relevance.45-48 However, the clinical significance of the 0.3 to
0.4SDdifferencesseeninthepediatricfunctionaltasksand0.4
to 0.6 SD differences in the adult functional tasks are more dif-
ficulttointerpret.Theserelativelymodestdifferencesmightre-
flect the large inbuilt reserve in pediatric nerves, and the im-
plicationsofareductioninthisaxonalreservemayonlybecome
evident with a longer period of observation as the current co-
hort gets older and potentially accumulates more neurological
deficits, as observed in other CCS.49,50
The stepwise acquisition of new skills during develop-
ment in children might mean that more significant deficits
wouldpresentwithmotororsensorydisability,whereasmilder
deficits may only present with a failure to achieve their pre-
morbid potential rather than loss of skills. This change in de-
velopmental trajectory can be difficult to appreciate. As such,
the PRO measures demonstrate global reduction in QOL and
more specific impairment in physical function on the PODCI
and EORTC questionnaires, suggesting that these deficits on
formal testing may be relevant. Other studies have also re-
porteddeficitsinstrengthandmobility,8,9,14balance,51andpos-
tural control52 as well as poorer QOL outcomes53 in CCS. How-
ever, the present study links CIPN-specific measures with
long-term QOL, providing an important and comprehensive
assessment of the association of long-term neuropathy with
patient function. Importantly, we have demonstrated the TNS
as a significant predictor of adult and pediatric PROs. While
deficits evident in functional measures and PROs may be mul-
tifactorial, the TNS was specifically designed to capture pe-
ripheral neurotoxicity, has been validated against multiple
neuropathy measures,54-56 and is correlated with objective
neurophysiological measures in CCS, enabling greater confi-
denceinattributingabnormalitiestoperipheralneuropathy.The
TNS is based solely on clinical assessment and has less inter-
individual variability than neurophysiological testing, mak-

Conclusions
Long-term deficits in clinical, electrophysiological, and
functional measures of peripheral neuropathy were common
in our young cohort of CCS with concurrent deficits in PRO
measures. Multimodal testing with inclusion of objective
neurophysiological measures and subjective PRO measures
is important to be able to attribute abnormalities to CIPN and
determine their clinical relevance. Both the type of neuro-
toxic agent used and a targeted clinical neurological assess-
ment are important considerations when screening CCS for
long-term neuropathy. The effect of CIPN may be greater in
the presence of other comorbidities, such as diabetes, and
also as CCS get older. Development of standardized, CIPN-
specific pediatric assessment tools, further research into the
acute development and progression of neuropathy, and
delineation of genetic and nongenetic predisposing factors
are essential for the development of neuroprotective inter-
ventional, and rehabilitative strategies to optimize the long-
term QOL for CCS.
