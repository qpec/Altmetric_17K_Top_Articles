Abstract
The development of immunologic interventions that can target the viral reservoir in HIV-1-
infected individuals is a major goal of the HIV-1 cure field1,2. However, little evidence exists that 
the viral reservoir can be sufficiently targeted to improve virologic control following 
discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here we show that Ad26/MVA3,4 therapeutic 
vaccination with toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) stimulation improves virologic control and delays 
viral rebound following ART discontinuation in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys that initiated ART 
during acute infection. Ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccination resulted in a dramatic increase in the 
magnitude and breadth of SIV-specific cellular immune responses in virologically suppressed, 
SIV-infected monkeys. TLR7 agonist administration led to innate immune stimulation and cellular

 immune activation. The combination of Ad26/MVA vaccination and TLR7 stimulation resulted in 
decreased levels of viral DNA in lymph nodes and peripheral blood, as well as improved virologic 
control and delayed viral rebound following ART discontinuation. Cellular immune breadth 
correlated inversely with setpoint viral loads and correlated directly with time to viral rebound. 
These data demonstrate the potential of therapeutic vaccination with innate immune stimulation as 
a strategy aimed at an HIV-1 functional cure.
The critical barrier to HIV-1 cure is the viral reservoir in latently infected CD4+ T 
lymphocytes5–8, which leads to viral rebound in the vast majority of HIV-1-infected 
individuals following discontinuation of ART9,10. Enhancing antiviral immune responses, 
potentially together with activation of the viral reservoir, might be able to eliminate these 
cells1,2,11. However, it is currently unknown whether immunologic interventions can impact 
the viral reservoir in vivo. In particular, it is unclear if a therapeutic vaccine will be able to 
induce cellular immune responses with sufficient potency and breadth to control viral 
rebound following ART discontinuation12. We therefore evaluated a strategy consisting of 
Ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccination3,4 and TLR7 agonist GS-986 administration in ART 
suppressed, SIV-infected rhesus monkeys.
We infected 36 Indian origin rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with SIVmac2514,13 by a 
single intrarectal exposure and initiated daily subcutaneous administration of a pre-
formulated ART cocktail (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, dolutegravir)14 on 
day 7 of acute infection. Animals had median plasma SIV RNA levels of 7.10 log copies/ml 
(range 6.04–7.88 log copies/ml) on the day of ART initiation (Fig. 1a). SIV RNA levels 
were controlled in the majority of animals by day 56 and in all animals by day 224 (Fig. 1a). 
SIV RNA levels were comparable among the different groups, and the animals that took 
longer to control virus had higher starting plasma viral loads on day 7 (P=0.04; data not 
shown).
Following 24 weeks of suppressive ART, groups of monkeys received the following 
interventions: (1) Ad26/MVA vaccines alone, (2) Ad26/MVA vaccines + TLR7 agonist 
GS-986, (3) TLR7 agonist GS-986 alone, or (4) sham (N=9 animals/group). In Groups 1–2, 
animals were vaccinated by the intramuscular route with 3×1010 viral particles (vp) Ad26 
vectors4,15 expressing SIVsmE543 Gag/Pol/Env at weeks 24 and 36, and were boosted with 
108 plaque-forming units (pfu) MVA vectors4 expressing SIVsmE543 Gag/Pol/Env at weeks 
48 and 60. In Groups 2–3, animals received 10 administrations of 0.3 mg/kg GS-986 (Gilead 
Sciences, Foster City, CA) by oral gavage every 2 weeks from weeks 50–70. In the 
combination intervention group, animals initiated GS-986 at peak immunity 2 weeks after 
the first MVA boost immunization. TLR7 triggering is known to activate dendritic cells and 
lymphocytes and to lead to innate immune activation, including secretion of cytokines and 
chemokines16,17. We observed nonspecific activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as 
measured by CD69 expression 1–2 days following each GS-986 administration (Extended 
Data Figs. 1–2) as well as increased plasma levels of IFN-α (Extended Data Fig. 3), thus 
confirming the immunostimulatory activity of GS-986. Other proinflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines were also induced by GS-986, including IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-23, CXCL9 
(MIG), CXCL11 (I-TAC), CCL4 (MIP-1β), and CCL11 (Eotaxin) (data not shown).

 We next evaluated the immunogenicity of the Ad26/MVA vaccine. The groups that received 
the vaccine demonstrated a robust >100-fold increase in the magnitude of Gag/Pol/Env-
specific cellular immune responses as compared with pre-vaccination responses by IFN-γ 
ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1b). Cellular immune responses increased substantially at week 28 
after Ad26 priming and further increased at week 50 after MVA boosting against both 
vaccine-matched SIVsmE543 peptides and virus-matched SIVmac239 peptides. We also 
observed induction of robust Gag/Pol/Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses as 
measured by multiparameter intracellular cytokine staining assays (Extended Data Figs. 4–
5). These responses were higher magnitude than those elicited with this same vaccine in 
SIV-uninfected rhesus monkeys4.
Ad26/MVA vaccination also expanded cellular immune breadth by at least 9.2-fold, as 
measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using subpools of 10 peptides spanning Gag, Pol, and 
Env (Fig. 1c; Extended Data Fig. 6). Total breadth was defined as the number of Gag+Pol
+Env positive subpools. We were unable to fine map individual epitopes due to insufficient 
availability of cells given the number of positive subpools. Prior to vaccination at week 24, 
we observed an average of 1.9 positive subpools/animal (1.0 Gag, 0.4 Pol, 0.6 Env). 
Following Ad26 priming, cellular immune breadth markedly expanded to an average of 10.1 
positive subpools/animal (4.4 Gag, 3.0 Pol, 3.1 Env). Following MVA boosting, cellular 
immune breadth further expanded to an average of 17.5 positive subpools/animal (5.4 Gag, 
5.9 Pol, 6.2 Env) (Fig. 1c), which likely represents an underestimate of breadth, since some 
positive subpools may have contained more than one epitope. Several animals developed 
Gag/Pol/Env-specific T cells that targeted >50 epitopes. The expanded cellular immune 
breadth involved induction of a large number of new epitopes and did not simply reflect 
expansion of previously established responses, since the vast majority of the epitopes 
following vaccination were not observed prior to vaccination in conventional IFN-γ 
ELISPOT assays as well as in assays using PBMC stimulated in vitro with these peptides for 
enhanced sensitivity (data not shown). We speculate that early initiation of ART induced 
preserved CD4+ T cell help (Extended Data Fig. 5), which likely contributed to vaccine 
immunogenicity. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that cellular immune 
breadth correlated inversely with pre-ART day 7 SIV RNA (Extended Data Fig. 7), which 
may be a surrogate marker for immunologic damage. In contrast with robust cellular 
immune responses, only modest humoral immune responses were observed following 
vaccination, including binding antibody responses by ELISA as well as functional antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and NK cell activation (data not 
shown).
We next assessed viral DNA in lymph nodes and PBMC using an RT-PCR assay14 with a 
sensitivity of 3 DNA copies/106 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a–b). In sham controls, viral DNA 
declined slightly between weeks 20 and 48, presumably reflecting the impact of suppressive 
ART, but no further decline was observed at week 70. In contrast, the two groups that 
received the Ad26/MVA vaccine demonstrated marked reductions of viral DNA to 
undetectable levels in the majority of animals by week 70 in both lymph nodes (Fig. 2a) and 
PBMC (Fig. 2b), suggesting that vaccination led to substantial reductions in SIV-infected 
CD4+ T cells in these tissue compartments. It is possible that a larger fraction of proviruses 
might be transcriptionally active following early ART initiation as compared with ART

 initiation during chronic infection, although this remains to be determined8. Viral outgrowth 
assays using 20 million PBMC were negative in all animals including controls at week 70 
(data not shown), presumably as a result of early initiation of ART.
To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the interventions, we discontinued ART at week 72. 
Viral rebound was observed in all animals (Fig. 3a). All sham controls rebounded by day 
10–14 following ART discontinuation in a stereotypical fashion and exhibited median 
setpoint plasma SIV RNA levels of 4.89 log copies/ml (range 4.27–5.57 log copies/ml) on 
day 168 following ART discontinuation. The monkeys that received GS-986 alone did not 
demonstrate any discernable delay or control of viral rebound, indicating that TLR7 
stimulation alone exerted no detectable antiviral effect in this study. Animals that received 
the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone exhibited a 0.66 log reduction of median setpoint plasma SIV 
RNA levels to 4.23 log copies/ml (range 2.70–4.91 log copies/ml) (P=0.002, Wilcoxon rank-
sum test) but only a marginal delay of viral rebound (P=0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) as 
compared with controls (Fig. 3b–c). In contrast, monkeys that received both the Ad26/MVA 
vaccine and GS-986 showed a striking 1.74 log reduction of median setpoint plasma SIV 
RNA levels to 3.15 log copies/ml (range <2.30–4.09 log copies/ml) (P<0.0001) and a 2.5-
fold delay of viral rebound from a median of 10 to 25 days as compared with controls 
(P=0.003) (Fig. 3b–c). Moreover, 33% (3 of 9) of the monkeys in the combination 
intervention group showed effective virologic control to undetectable setpoint viral loads 
(<2.30 log copies/ml) following ART discontinuation. These data demonstrate that the 
combination of Ad26/MVA vaccination and TLR7 stimulation improved virologic control 
and delayed viral rebound following ART discontinuation.
We next evaluated the immunologic and virologic correlates of virologic control. Cellular 
immune breadth immediately prior to ART discontinuation (Fig. 4a) as well as at peak 
immunity (Extended Data Fig. 8) correlated inversely with setpoint viral loads following 
ART discontinuation, particularly the breadth of Gag, Env, and total responses (P<0.0001, 
Spearman rank-correlation tests). Gag, Env, and total cellular immune breadth also 
correlated directly with the time to viral rebound (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9; P=0.0001 
to P=0.001). Consistent with the correlates analyses, mathematical modeling of viral 
dynamics further suggested that the combination of changes in the reservoir exit rate and the 
early viral growth rate accounted for the differences in the time to viral rebound, whereas the 
virus-specific immune proliferation rate was likely responsible for virologic control 
(Extended Data Fig. 10).
Viral DNA in lymph nodes and PBMC correlated poorly with virologic control following 
ART discontinuation and time to viral rebound (P=0.03, data not shown), presumably 
because all animals with undetectable viral DNA still rebounded. These findings suggest that 
these viral DNA assays are not sufficiently sensitive to predict functional cure, consistent 
with recent clinical observations18,19. Moreover, there was no correlation between day 7 pre-
ART SIV RNA or time to initial virologic suppression on ART and virologic control 
following ART discontinuation (P=NS).
In this study, we demonstrate that Ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccination robustly augmented 
cellular immune magnitude and breadth in ART-suppressed, SIV-infected rhesus monkeys

 and that the TLR7 agonist GS-986 led to innate immune stimulation and cellular activation. 
The combination of Ad26/MVA vaccination and GS-986 resulted in a significant 1.74 log 
reduction in median setpoint viral loads and a 2.5-fold delay in the time to viral rebound 
following ART discontinuation as compared with sham controls. Moreover, 3 of 9 animals 
in this group demonstrated virologic control to undetectable levels in the absence of ART. 
These three animals were characterized by high cellular immune magnitude and breadth and 
negative viral DNA prior to ART discontinuation. Taken together, these data demonstrate the 
proof-of-concept that the combination of therapeutic vaccination and innate immune 
stimulation can impact viral rebound following ART discontinuation.
The Ad26/MVA vaccine induced remarkably potent IFN-γ ELISPOT responses in the ART-
suppressed, SIV-infected monkeys in the present study, consistent with a previous 
prophylactic vaccine study in uninfected monkeys4. We speculate that preserved CD4+ T 
cell help, primed by short-term viral replication following SIV infection prior to ART 
initiation on day 7, likely enhanced vaccine immunogenicity. The Ad26/MVA vaccine also 
expanded cellular immune breadth by nearly 10-fold, including induction of responses to a 
large number of epitopes that were not detectable following SIV infection. This may be 
critical for a therapeutic vaccine, because the viral reservoir typically contains viruses with T 
cell epitope escape mutations12. We did not detect evidence for viral “blipping” on day 1 or 
day 2 following TLR7 agonist administration (J. Whitney, unpublished data), which may 
reflect the early initiation of ART on day 7 of infection and thus the limited size of the viral 
reservoirs in this study14. We were therefore unable to determine whether the beneficial 
effect of the TLR7 agonist reflected its potential role as a vaccine adjuvant, a latency 
reversing agent, or both. Future studies should be performed in SIV-infected monkeys that 
initiate ART during chronic infection, which would be more representative of the majority of 
HIV-1-infected individuals. Moreover, future studies could explore longer periods of ART 
suppression, potentially to reduce residual viral replication, although the majority of animals 
appear to have a stable reservoir after 24–72 weeks of ART14. The capacity of immunologic 
interventions to target follicular helper CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes should also be 
explored20.
Previous studies of poxvirus-, adenovirus-, and DNA-based therapeutic vaccines have 
typically shown only a modest impact on viral rebound following ART discontinuation in 
both rhesus monkeys21 and humans22,23. The present study extends these prior observations 
by combining therapeutic vaccination with innate immune stimulation. Of note, the 
combination of Ad26/MVA vaccination and TLR7 stimulation proved more potent than 
either component alone. This finding is consistent with a prior in vitro study that showed 
that robust CD8+ T cells may be able to facilitate elimination of the viral reservoir following 
reactivation11. The present study also demonstrates that the breadth of Gag/Pol/Env-specific 
T cell responses correlated inversely with setpoint viral loads following ART 
discontinuation, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of the 
vaccine involved expansion of cellular immune breadth and immunologic control of virus 
rebounding from the reservoir.
In summary, our data suggest the potential of combining therapeutic vaccination with innate 
immune stimulation as an HIV-1 cure strategy. Our findings show that these interventions

 can improve virologic control and delay viral rebound following ART discontinuation in 
SIV-infected rhesus monkeys that initiated ART during acute infection. Additional 
preclinical and clinical studies with Ad26/MVA vaccination and TLR7 stimulation should be 
performed to explore this strategy in greater detail.
Methods
Animals
32 outbred Indian-origin, young adult male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) 
were genotyped and selected as negative for the protective MHC class I alleles Mamu-A*01, 
Mamu-B*08, and Mamu-B*17. Animals expressing susceptible and resistant TRIM5α 
alleles were distributed amongst the groups. Animals were otherwise randomly allocated to 
groups. All monkeys were housed at Bioqual, Rockville, MD. Animals were infected with 
500 TCID50 of our SIVmac251 challenge stock4,13,24 by the intrarectal route. Monkeys were 
bled up to two times per week for viral load determinations. Immunologic and virologic 
assays were performed blinded. All animal studies were approved by the appropriate 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
ART regimen
The preformulated antiretroviral therapy (ART) cocktail contained 5.1 mg/mL tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 40 mg/mL emtricitabine (FTC), and 2.5 mg/mL dolutegravir 
(DTG) in a solvent containing 15% (v/v) kleptose adjusted to pH 4.2. This ART cocktail was 
administered once daily at 1 mL/kg body weight via the subcutaneous route.
Ad26/MVA vaccination and TLR7 agonist GS-986 administration
In Groups 1–2, monkeys were primed by the intramuscular route with 3×1010 viral particles 
(vp) Ad26 vectors4,15 expressing SIVsmE543 Gag/Pol/Env at weeks 24 and 36, and were 
boosted with 108 plaque-forming units (pfu) MVA vectors4 expressing SIVsmE543 
Gag/Pol/Env at weeks 48 and 60. In Groups 2–3, animals received 10 administrations of 0.3 
mg/kg GS-986 (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA) by oral gavage every 2 weeks from weeks 
50–70.
Cellular immune assays
SIV-specific cellular immune responses were assessed by IFN-γ ELISPOT assays and 
multiparameter ICS assays essentially as described4. Estimates of cellular immune breadth 
involved IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using subpools of 10 peptides across the Gag, Pol, and Env 
proteins. 12-color ICS assays were performed with the Aqua green-fluorescent reactive dye 
(Invitrogen, L23101) and predetermined titers of mAbs (Becton-Dickinson) against CD3 
(SP34; Alexa Fluor 700), CD4 (OKT4; BV711, Biolegend), CD8 (SK1; allophycocyanin-
cyanine 7 [APC-Cy7]), CD28 (L293; BV610), CD95 (DX2; allophycocyanin [APC]), CD69 
(TP1.55.3; phycoerythrin-Texas red [energy-coupled dye; ECD]; Beckman Coulter), gamma 
interferon (IFN-γ) (B27; phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 [PE-Cy7]), Ki67 (B56; fluorescein 
isothiocyanate [FITC]), CCR5 (3A9; phycoerythrin [PE]), CCR7(3D12; Pacific Blue), and 
PD-1(EH21.1; peridinin chlorophyll-A-cyanine 5.5 [PerCP-Cy5.5]). IFN-γ backgrounds 
were consistently <0.01% in PBMC.

 Viral RNA assays
Viral RNA was isolated from cell-free plasma using a viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and 
was quantitated essentially as described14.
Viral DNA assays
Levels of proviral DNA were quantitated as previously described14. Total cellular DNA was 
isolated from 5×106 cells using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). The absolute 
quantification of viral DNA in each sample was determined by qPCR using primers specific 
to a conserved region SIVmac239. All samples were directly compared to a linear virus 
standard and the simultaneous amplification of a fragment of human GAPDH gene. PCR 
assays were performed with 100–200 ng sample DNA.
Statistical analyses
Analysis of virologic and immunologic data was performed using GraphPad Prism v6.03 
(GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Comparisons of groups was performed using 2-sided 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests without Bonferroni adjustments. Correlations were assessed by 2-
sided Spearman rank-correlation tests without Bonferroni adjustments.
Viral dynamics modeling
We employed viral dynamics modeling to better characterize the kinetics of viral rebound 
and to gain insight into the mechanism behind the improved control of rebound in certain 
groups of treated animals. We were particularly interested in whether the effect of the 
vaccine and TLR7 agonist on rebound could be explained by a reduction in the latent 
reservoir size, or an antiviral immune response, or both.
Most existing viral dynamics models for HIV-1/SIV or other infections are not able to 
explain the diversity of kinetics seen in different animals in this study – such as rebound to a 
high setpoint, rebound to a high peak and lower setpoint, and rebound to a medium or high 
peak followed by control to undetectable levels – with mechanisms that are realistic for 
HIV-1/SIV. Specifically, for HIV-1 and SIV infection, exhaustion of target cells cannot alone 
explain the decline from peak viremia, which instead requires an immune response that can 
dramatically reduce the viral load set-point without significant changes in the death rate of 
virus-producing infected cells25. Inspired by other modeling work26–29, we developed a new 
model that was able to explain all these observations.
The model we used is described by a system of ordinary differential equations that track 
changes in the levels of uninfected (T) and infected (I) target cells, free virus (V), and 
precursor (P) and effector (E) immune responses over time (Extended Data Figure 10):

 All variables are expressed as concentrations per mL of plasma. Parameter λ is the rate of 
production of susceptible uninfected cells (cells/mL/day), β is the viral infectivity 
((copies/mL)−1 day−1), dI is the death rate of infected cells (day−1), dT is the death rate of 
death of uninfected cells (day−1), a is the rate at which latent cells reactivate to become 
productively infected (cells/day), k is the viral burst size (virions/cell/)(day−1) and c is the 
viral clearance rate (day−1). Our model of the immune response is general enough to 
describe either humoral or cellular effects. Precursor immune cells (naïve + memory) are 
produced at a baseline rate m (cells/mL/day), proliferate at an antigen-dependent rate, and 
die at a rate dP (day−1). The maximum proliferate rate is p (day−1) and half-maximal 
proliferation occurs at viral load NP (copies/mL). A fraction f of all proliferating cells 
differentiate into effectors, which die at a rate dE (day−1). Effectors reduce the rate at which 
actively infected cells are produced (either by inactivating free virus or killing early-stage 
infected cells29,30), with half-maximal inhibition occurring at a concentration NE (cell/mL).
During ART, β = 0, and virus and cells reach steady states at values T0 = λ/dT, I0 = (a/dI), 
V0 = (a/dI)(k/c), P0 ≈ (m/dP), and E0 ≈ 0 (since V0 ≪ NP) which we take as the initial 
conditions at the time of ART interruption.
Since we only have longitudinal observations of viral load, we cannot uniquely identify all 
the parameters of this model. We conducted extensive analytic and numeric investigation of 
the model to determine which parameters were most important for the dynamics and which 
could be estimated from the available data. Based on this knowledge and our previous 
work14, we fixed the parameter dI = 0.4 (day−1)14, dT = 0.05 (day−1), dP = 0.001 (day−1), dE 
= 1 (day−1), f = 0.9. Since only the ratio m/NE can be identified from the viral load data, we 
fixed NE =104. The ratio (k/c) was fixed to 2,000 virus/cell based on a burst size of k = 
5×104 (virions/cell)(day−1) and c = 23 day−1 for SIV32–34. The other parameters (λ, β, a, m, 
p, NP) were fit. We also fit results to a simpler model with no antigen-dependent immune 
response (P, E = 0) to ensure that the fits were improved by adding in the extra terms. We 
modeled the effect of antiretroviral drug decay by including a 3-day washout period during 
which virus could not productively reproduce. Varying this period between 0 and 6 days did 
not change conclusions from the model.
Models were fit to each animal individually using a Bayesian framework. Briefly, a joint 
posterior distribution was estimated for the fitted parameters using a likelihood function for

 the viral load at each time point and very weakly-informative priors on the fitted parameters 
(see below). We parameterized the model using log-transformed parameters to account for 
the possibility of large parameter variations between monkeys. The likelihood assumes that 
the observed viral load is log-normally distributed around the true viral load, and that 
measurements include an error with variance σ2 (which we fixed at 0.1 based on previous 
work). The estimated posterior distribution was sampled using the Metropolis-Hastings 
algorithm implemented in R using the package MHadaptive35 and the differential equations 
were numerically integrated using deSolve36. After a burn-in of 104 iterations, 105 updates 
were run and 1 in 10 samples were collected. The resulting fits were visually inspected to 
make sure they were consistent with the observed viral load. We specified the prior for each 
parameter independently according to:
with the means for each parameter log10(λ) = 1.3, log10(β) = −6, log10(a) = −4.5, log10(m) = 
0, log10(p) = −4, and log10(NP) = 4.
Beyond the individual parameters, we also calculated a composite parameter describing the 
exponential growth rate of the virus immediately following rebound, r, as
We also calculated the time of rebound (τr) as the time at which viral load was expected to 
be exactly equal to the detection limit of vd = 200c/ml, by numerically integrating the 
differential equations until V(t) = vd.
In Extended Data Figure 10, we show results of the fits. Values shown represent the median 
and 95% credible intervals of the posterior of the mean of the group. The posterior mean 
was constructed by repeatedly sampling one value from the posterior of each animal in the 
group, and then taking the mean. P values reported for an increase in the posterior mean 
represent the probability that a random sample from the posterior mean in one group is 
smaller than a sample from the posterior mean in the other.

load reaches the detection threshold of 200 copies/ml for each treatment group. Monkeys 
treated with both the vaccine and TLR7 agonist exhibited slower viral growth rates and 
stronger immune responses than all other groups (P < 0.01 for each comparison). These 
monkeys and monkeys treated with only the vaccine exhibited a lower reservoir exit rate 
than untreated monkeys (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
