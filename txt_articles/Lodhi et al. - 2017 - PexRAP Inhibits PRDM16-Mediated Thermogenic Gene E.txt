In Brief
Lodhi et al. find that the peroxisomal lipid
synthetic enzyme PexRAP is also a

SUMMARY
How the nuclear receptor PPARg regulates the
development of two functionally distinct types of ad-
ipose tissue, brown and white fat, as well as the
browning of white fat, remains unclear. Our previous
studies suggest that PexRAP, a peroxisomal lipid
synthetic enzyme, regulates PPARg signaling and
white adipogenesis. Here, we show that PexRAP is
an inhibitor of brown adipocyte gene expression.
PexRAP inactivation promoted adipocyte brown-
ing, increased energy expenditure, and decreased
adiposity. Identification of PexRAP-interacting pro-
teins
suggests
that
PexRAP
function
extends
beyond its role as a lipid synthetic enzyme. Notably,
PexRAP interacts with importin-b1, a nuclear import
factor, and knockdown of PexRAP in adipocytes
reduced the levels of nuclear phospholipids. PexRAP
also interacts with PPARg, as well as PRDM16, a crit-
ical transcriptional regulator of thermogenesis, and
disrupts the PRDM16-PPARg complex, providing a
potential mechanism for PexRAP-mediated inhibi-
tion of adipocyte browning. These results identify
PexRAP as an important regulator of adipose tissue
remodeling.
INTRODUCTION
The continued global rise in obesity and its associated insulin
resistance and diabetes calls for alternative treatment ap-
proaches.
Targeting adipose
tissue function to decrease
adiposity and improve insulin sensitivity represents such an
approach. Adipose tissue is a complex organ that regulates
whole-body energy balance (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014).
Two major types of adipose tissue are found in mammals: white
fat and brown fat. White adipose tissue (WAT) primarily stores
fat, which can be mobilized in times of need, whereas brown ad-
ipose tissue (BAT) transforms the chemical energy in food into
heat through uncoupled respiration. In addition to classical
brown adipocytes, clusters of brown adipocyte-like beige cells
appear in subcutaneous WAT in response to prolonged cold
exposure or beta adrenergic signaling (Wang and Seale, 2016).
Brown and beige adipocytes are characterized by their expres-
sion of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), a long-chain fatty acid/H+
symporter (Fedorenko et al., 2012) that mediates thermogenesis
by allowing protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane, bypassing ATP synthase. By promoting thermogenesis,
this uncoupling of oxidation from ATP production increases en-
ergy expenditure. Thus, exploiting the thermogenic capacity of
brown and beige adipocytes represents a potential strategy for
treating obesity and diabetes.
Thermogenic gene expression in both types of UCP1-positive
adipocytes is regulated by PRDM16, a large zinc finger-contain-
ing transcription factor (Cohen et al., 2014; Harms et al., 2014;
Seale et al., 2007). Overexpression of PRDM16 in adipocyte
precursors or in mice promotes brown gene expression (Seale
et al., 2008). Conversely, adipose-specific deletion of PRDM16
inhibits browning of subcutaneous WAT and promotes obesity
and insulin resistance (Cohen et al., 2014). PRDM16 does not
appear to be required for embryonic development of the clas-
sical BAT but is necessary to repress white fat-selective genes
within BAT and to maintain brown adipocyte function in adult
mice (Harms et al., 2014; Ohno et al., 2013). PRDM16 regulates
thermogenic gene expression by interacting with and modu-
lating the activity of other transcription factors, including
C/EBPb, PGC1a, PPARa, and PPARg (Kajimura et al., 2009;
Seale et al., 2008).
The ligand-activated nuclear receptor PPARg is a critical tran-
scriptional regulator of both white and BAT development (Ahma-
dian et al., 2013). Ligand binding induces a conformational
change in PPARg, promoting dissociation of transcriptional re-
pressors and recruitment of co-activators, resulting in activation
of target gene expression. Because PPARg can regulate devel-
opment of the two functionally distinct types of adipose tissue,
as well as browning of WAT, it is likely that PPARg is activated
by multiple endogenous partial agonists that in turn recruit
different transcriptional co-activators controlling unique subsets
of genes.
Our previous efforts to understand the role of adipose tissue
lipogenesis in PPARg signaling led to the identification of
PexRAP (peroxisomal reductase activating PPARg), a peroxi-
somal membrane protein that synthesizes ether-linked phos-
pholipids, potential partial agonists for PPARg (Lodhi et al.,
2012). Here, we demonstrate that PexRAP is a multifunctional

 protein that appears to act as a molecular switch to repress
adipocyte browning.
RESULTS
PexRAP Expression Profile
We previously identified PexRAP as a protein involved in adipo-
genesis that is enriched in cellular fractions containing peroxi-
somal markers such as PMP70 and catalase (Lodhi et al.,
2012). To determine the relative distribution of PexRAP in
different adipose tissue depots, we isolated inguinal and gonadal
WAT (iWAT and gWAT, respectively) as well as BAT from wild-
type C57 mice fed chow diet (Figure 1). Western blot analysis
indicated that the PexRAP protein was expressed in WAT de-
pots, but its levels in BAT were low (Figure 1A). PexRAP protein
levels were also decreased in iWAT of mice subjected to cold
exposure for 1 week (Figure S1A). These data suggest that
PexRAP might be a negative regulator of thermogenic gene
expression and is maintained at low levels during BAT develop-
ment or cold-induced browning of WAT.
Generation of PexRAP Knockout Mice
To determine its role in adiposity and metabolism, PexRAP (en-
coded by Dhrs7b) was knocked out in mice (Figure S1) using a
targeting vector obtained from the EUCOMM repository (Figures
S1B and S1C). Mice homozygous for the ‘‘knockout-first’’ allele
manifested embryonic lethality, with only a small number of an-
imals surviving into adulthood. Heterozygotes were viable and
fertile and had no overt phenotype. Mass spectrometric anal-

 homogenate indicated a preferential decrease in phosphatidyl-
choline species with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of
the glycerol backbone in the knockout mice (Figure S1D).
Ether-linked phospholipids, including plasmalogens, were pre-
sent in low abundance in this fraction of the adipose tissue.
The single plasmalogen species (p16:0/20:4-GPC) detected
with an m/z ratio of 766.6 was decreased in the knockout
(Figure S1D).
PexRAP Knockout Mice Have Increased Browning of
Subcutaneous WAT
The surviving homozygous knockout mice were visibly smaller in
size. Body weight measured in 1-month-old male knockout mice
was approximately one-third less than in WT mice (Figure S1E).
Gene expression analysis of gWAT and iWAT showed depot-
specific effects of the knockout (Figure S1F). In gWAT, PexRAP
knockout resulted in decreased expression of PPARg and its
target genes. In iWAT, PexRAP inactivation resulted in a striking
increase in UCP1. PGC1a, Cidea, and PPARa messages were
also increased, but PPARg expression was minimally affected
in iWAT (Figure S1F). Histologic analysis confirmed increased
UCP1 expression in iWAT (Figure S1G). Together, these results
suggest that PexRAP inactivation results in browning of subcu-
taneous WAT.
To study the effect on adipose tissue remodeling in detail, we
converted the knockout-first allele into a conditional allele and
crossed the floxed animals with Rosa-CreER mice to generate
tamoxifen-inducible global PexRAP knockout (PexRAP-iKO) an-
imals. We recently reported that PexRAP expression was
decreased in multiple tissues of tamoxifen-treated PexRAP-
iKO mice, including liver, bone marrow, and WAT, but not in
the brain. Adult PexRAP-iKO mice treated with tamoxifen survive
but have leukopenia because of the nearly complete loss of neu-
trophils (Lodhi et al., 2015).
Body composition analysis by EchoMRI indicated that
PexRAP-iKO had significantly reduced adiposity when sub-
jected to high fat feeding (Figure 1B). The decreased adiposity
was observed despite hyperphagia (Figure S2A). Indirect calo-
rimetry indicated that the knockout mice have elevated energy
expenditure (Figure 1C). Histologic analysis showed that
white adipocytes were smaller in PexRAP-iKO mice, and
brown adipocytes had marked depletion of lipid droplets (Fig-
ure 1D). Morphometric analysis of the gonadal adipose depot
confirmed that adipocyte size and number were significantly
decreased in PexRAP-iKO mice compared with control ani-
mals (Figures S2B and S2C). Immunohistologic analysis using
an anti-UCP1 antibody indicated robust browning of iWAT
following tamoxifen-inducible knockout of PexRAP (Figure 1E).
Together, these data suggest that knockout of PexRAP in pre-
cursor cells reprograms adipose tissue development and
function.
To determine if the increased browning observed with PexRAP
deficiency was due to effects intrinsic to adipose tissue, we
generated adipose-specific PexRAP knockout (PexRAP-AKO)
mice (Figures 1F and 1G) by crossing the floxed mice with adipo-
nectin-Cre transgenic mice (Eguchi et al., 2011). PexRAP-AKO
inactivation had no effect on body weight or body composition
in mice fed chow diet or a high fat diet (not shown), perhaps sug-
gesting that the protein is more important during an earlier stage
of fat development and less so in mature adipose tissue. Adipose
PexRAP deficiency also did not alter thermogenic gene expres-
sion at room temperature (not shown). However, when subjected
to cold exposure for 3 days, PexRAP-AKO mice manifested a
7-fold increase in UCP1 expression in iWAT. Other markers of
brown adipocytes, including Cidea and PPARa, were also signif-
icantly increased (Figure 1F). Western blot analysis confirmed
the increased UCP1 and decreased PexRAP expression in
knockout mice (Figure 1G).
Cell-Autonomous Effect of PexRAP Inactivation on
Thermogenic Gene Expression
To determine if the effect of PexRAP inactivation on thermogenic
gene expression was cell autonomous, we collected the stromal
vascular fraction from iWAT of PexRAP-iKO and control mice
and treated the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) to knock
out PexRAP. Following differentiation of these cells using a pro-
brown adipogenesis cocktail (Fisher et al., 2012), thermogenic
genes, such as UCP1, PGC1a, and PRDM16, significantly
increased, whereas other adipocyte genes, such as adiponectin
and white adipocyte-enriched genes, such as Lyz2 and Gsta3
(Siersbæk et al., 2012), were unchanged (Figure 1H). Knock-
down of PexRAP in HIB1b brown preadipocytes (Figure S2D)
or in PPARg-overexpressing immortalized mouse embryonic fi-
broblasts (PPARg-MEFs) (Figure 1I) using lentiviral short hairpin
RNA (shRNA), a separate approach, also strikingly increased
thermogenic gene expression. Basal and uncoupled rates of
respiration were significantly increased with PexRAP knock-
down in PPARg-MEFs (Figure 1J), suggesting that the increase
in thermogenic gene expression is physiologically relevant.
Together, these data suggest that PexRAP is a cell autonomous
regulator of UCP1 gene expression.
Identification of PexRAP-Interacting Proteins in
Adipocytes Using Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino
Acids of Cells in Culture
To understand the molecular mechanism of PexRAP function in
adipocytes, we used SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino
acids of cells in culture), a mass spectrometry-based proteomics
approach (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2008), to identify PexRAP-in-
teracting proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, using the strategy de-
picted in Figure 2A. A complete list of interacting proteins iden-
tified by this approach is presented in Table S1. Analysis of
protein-protein interactions using the STRING database (version
10.0) revealed that many of the potential PexRAP-interacting
proteins interact with one another (Figure 2B), suggesting that
some of these were probably pulled down as components of
multi-protein complexes and are not necessarily direct binding
partners of PexRAP. The interacting proteins were broadly cate-
gorized into several functional groups, including lipid and
glucose metabolism, protein translation and targeting, and pro-
tein degradation (Figure 2C). The identification of proteins such
as PMP70 (Abcd3), HSD17b4 (peroxisomal D-bifunctional pro-
tein), and AGPAT9 as PexRAP-binding proteins reinforced our
notion that PexRAP is a peroxisomal protein involved in lipid
metabolism. The pathway of PexRAP-mediated phospholipid
synthesis starts in peroxisomes and is completed in the ER.
2768
Cell Reports 20, 2766–2774, September 19, 2017
 PexRAP catalyzes the final peroxisomal step, generating lyso-
phosphatidic acid (LPA) or its ether lipid equivalent, 1-O-alkyl
glycerol 3-phosphate (AGP) (Dean and Lodhi, 2017). The identity
of proteins that catalyze the subsequent steps is unclear.
AGPAT9 is an ER-localized acylglycerolphosphate acyltransfer-
ase that might catalyze the next step in the PexRAP pathway.
We confirmed the interaction of PexRAP with AGPAT9 using
GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Figures
2D and 2E).
Nuclear Localization of PexRAP
Although these interactions might be predicted, we also found
unexpected potential binding proteins. For example, the interac-
tion with importin-b1 (Kpnb1), a karyopherin that binds to a non-
classical nuclear localization sequence (NLS), was surprising
and suggested that PexRAP may also be localized in the
nucleus. Sequence analysis revealed a non-classical NLS in
PexRAP similar to the importinb-interacting NLS found in para-
thyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (Cingolani et al., 2002)

 (Figure 3). To determine if this sequence is required for interac-
tion with importin-b, we generated a DNLS mutant of PexRAP.
Although GST-tagged wild-type PexRAP interacted with impor-
tin-b, internal deletion of the NLS completely abolished the inter-
action (Figures 3A and 3B). Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1
adipocytes indicated that PexRAP is present in the nucleus in
addition to its expected enrichment in peroxisome and mem-
brane fractions (Figure 3C). Immunofluorescence analysis using
an anti-PexRAP/DHRS7b antibody in differentiated PPARg-
MEFs revealed punctate cytosolic staining typically observed
for peroxisomal proteins as well as nuclear staining (Figure 3D).
To determine the role of PexRAP in nuclear phospholipid synthe-
sis, we knocked down its expression in fully differentiated
PPARg-MEFs. Mass spectrometric analysis of lipids extracted
from the nuclear fraction indicated that phosphatidylcholine
(PC) levels were significantly reduced with PexRAP knockdown
(Figures 3E and 3F). Interestingly, alkyl ether-linked PCs were
abundantly present in the nucleus and reduced following
PexRAP knockdown. Together, these data suggest that in addi-
tion to its localization in peroxisomes, PexRAP is present in the
nucleus and may be involved in nuclear phospholipid synthesis.
PexRAP Interacts with PRDM16 and PPARg and Inhibits
Their Interaction with Each Other
Another surprise was the identification of PRDM16 as a potential
PexRAP-binding protein (Figure 4). Because PRDM16 is ex-
pressed at very low levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Seale et al.,
2007), this is likely a specific interaction. We confirmed the inter-
action by western blot analysis of tagged PRDM16 pulled down
with GST-PexRAP (Figure 4A). Using various GST-tagged frag-
ments of PRDM16, we mapped a region encompassing residues
680–880 as the site of interaction with PexRAP (Figure 4B). Inter-
estingly, this is also the region of PRDM16 through which it inter-
acts with CtBP1 to repress white adipocyte genes (Kajimura
et al., 2008).
PRDM16 regulates thermogenesis by interacting with and co-
activating PPARg and PPARa (Kajimura et al., 2009). Because
PexRAP deficiency increases thermogenic gene expression,
we hypothesized that PexRAP sequesters PRDM16 away from
these nuclear receptors. While testing this possibility, we discov-
ered that PexRAP itself directly interacts with the ligand-binding
domains of PPARg and PPARa, the interaction being stronger
with PPARg than PPARa (Figure 4C). Given these interactions,
it is possible that PexRAP may be a transcriptional cofactor of
PPARs.
Transcriptional cofactors frequently contain a leucine-rich
stretch of amino acids called the LxxLL motif (Bulynko and
O’Malley, 2011; Plevin et al., 2005). This motif is involved in inter-
action with the activation function-2 (AF-2) region of ligand-bind-
ing domain in nuclear receptors (Plevin et al., 2005). Sequence
analysis of PexRAP revealed an LxxLL motif (38LFRLL42 in the
mouse sequence) near the N terminus. Internal deletion of these

 five residues in PexRAP abolished the interaction with PPARg
(Figure 4D), strongly suggesting a physiologically relevant
PexRAP/PPARg interaction.
To determine if PexRAP affects the interaction of PRDM16
with PPARg, we ectopically expressed tagged PexRAP or
PRDM16 alone or together and conducted pull-down assays us-
ing GST or GST-PPARg. When either protein was expressed
alone, it interacted with PPARg. However, when PexRAP and
PRDM16 were co-expressed, PexRAP inhibited the ability of
PRDM16 to interact with PPARg (Figure 4E).

Activity
To determine whether PexRAP affects PRDM16-mediated

 ZFP516, a transcriptional activator of UCP1, was shown to drive
the expression of a similar UCP1-GFP reporter in 293FT cells
(Dempersmier et al., 2015). As shown in Figure 4F, overexpres-
sion of PRDM16 also strikingly promoted the expression of the
UCP1-GFP in 293T cells. However, co-expression of PexRAP
with PRDM16 markedly decreased the expression of the re-
porter, suggesting that PexRAP inhibits PRDM16-mediated
thermogenic gene expression (Figure 4F). Western blot analysis
of the overexpressed proteins is shown in Figure 4G.
To determine if PexRAP directly regulates recruitment of
PRDM16 to brown adipocyte genes, we generated BAT SV cells
that stably express FLAG-PRDM16 (Figure S3A) and performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using an anti-
FLAG antibody followed by qPCR. Whereas knockdown of
PexRAP in these cells significantly increased recruitment of
PRDM16 to Ppargc1a and Ucp1 (Figure 4H), lentivirus-mediated
overexpression of PexRAP markedly decreased binding of
PRDM16 to Ppargc1a and modestly but significantly decreased
binding to Ucp1 (Figure 4I). Western blot analysis of PexRAP
knockdown or overexpression in these cells is shown in Figures
S3B and S3C.
Next, we determined whether PexRAP overexpression affects
thermogenic gene expression in BAT SV cells isolated from wild-
type mice. Although overexpression of PexRAP in these cells
following adipogenesis did not affect gene expression (Fig-
ure S3D), its overexpression prior to differentiation impaired adi-
pogenesis and reduced thermogenic gene expression (Figures
4J and 4K). This is consistent with the possibility that PexRAP
is likely involved in an earlier step of BAT development. The inhi-
bition of brown adipogenesis with PexRAP overexpression sug-
gests that the protein might have other functions independent of
directly inhibiting PRDM16 function, perhaps modulating PPARg
activation.
DISCUSSION
Because beige fat might counteract obesity, adipose tissue re-
modeling has drawn considerable interest. Several factors have
been identified that promote brown adipogenic programs,
including PRDM16 and Ebf2 (Cohen et al., 2014; Harms et al.,
2014; Rajakumari et al., 2013). Similarly, other factors have
also been identified that inhibit brown and beige adipogenesis,
including Rb/p107, MRTFA, TLE3, and Zfp423 (De Sousa
et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2015; Shao
et al., 2016; Villanueva et al., 2013). Previously, we identified
PexRAP as a peroxisomal lipid synthetic enzyme that regulates
adipogenesis (Lodhi et al., 2012). Here, we present evidence
suggesting that PexRAP is a dual-function regulator of adipose
tissue remodeling that inhibits thermogenic gene expression.
Although PexRAP is abundantly present in WAT, PexRAP pro-
tein levels are very low in mature BAT. Inactivation of PexRAP
in mice results in robust browning of subcutaneous white fat.
Identification of PexRAP interacting proteins and characteriza-
tion of its subcellular localization suggest that in addition to its
role as a peroxisomal lipid synthetic enzyme, PexRAP is found
in the nucleus, where it affects transcriptional regulation of adi-
pose tissue browning. Together, these studies suggest that
PexRAP might be part of a previously unrecognized peroxi-
some-to-nucleus regulatory circuit that controls adipose tissue
remodeling.
PexRAP possesses a cryptic non-classical NLS through which
it interacts with importin-b1. It is unclear whether PexRAP trans-
locates from peroxisomes to the nucleus in response to a phys-
iological stimulus or if there is a constitutively localized pool of
PexRAP in the nucleus. There is precedent for transmembrane
protein translocation to the nucleus in response to stimuli. For
example, AEG-1 (astrocyte elevated gene-1), an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-localized transmembrane protein, translocates
to the nucleus in response to TNF-a treatment and functions
as a transcriptional co-activator of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
(Sarkar et al., 2008).
Our results suggest that nuclear localized PexRAP interacts
with PRDM16 as well as PPARg and prevents their interaction
with each other, which could be the mechanism underlying the
inhibitory role of PexRAP in adipocyte browning. However, it is
possible that PexRAP interferes with PRDM16 function through
various mechanisms. Although knockdown of PexRAP strikingly
affects thermogenic gene expression, its overexpression in adi-
pocytes has a relatively mild effect on brown fat genes. This pre-
sumably suggests that a cofactor might be required or other
aspects of PexRAP function, including its lipid synthetic activity,
might be involved in regulating gene expression.
TLE3, a white-selective transcriptional regulator, has been
shown to inhibit brown adipocyte-selective gene expression by
disrupting the interaction between PRDM16 and PPARg (Villa-
nueva et al., 2013). Moreover, the transcriptional regulator
ZFP423 was recently shown to be important for maintaining
white adipocyte identity by inhibiting thermogenic gene expres-
sion mediated by the brown-selective transcription factor
Ebf2 (Shao et al., 2016). The need for seemingly redundant mech-
anisms for regulating adipose tissue remodeling remains un-
explained. Perhaps these transcriptional regulators assume
stage-specific roles during discrete steps in adipose tissue
development. For example, Zfp423 is thought to function primar-
ilyat the level ofthe mature white adipocyte to inhibit thermogenic
gene expression (Shao et al., 2016). Our studies suggest that
PexRAP is likely more important during an earlier step of fat
development. Notably, although ZFP423 can directly bind to
DNA and regulate transcription, TLE3 and PexRAP lack DNA-
binding domains and regulate transcription through their ability
to interact with other transcription factors. TLE3 and PexRAP
both interact with PPARg, but PexRAP is unique in also possess-
ing lipid synthetic activity that generates ether-linked phospho-
lipids, potential partial agonists of PPARg (Lodhi et al., 2012).
Although PPARg could be activated by several different lipid
ligands with variable effects on transcriptional activity, it is likely
that the endogenous agonists of PPARg in general are partial ag-
onists that promote recruitment of distinct transcriptional cofac-
tors controlling unique subsets of genes. This could be the
mechanism allowing PPARg to regulate the development of
two functionally distinct types of adipose tissue, as well as the
browning of WAT. In addition to the peroxisome-derived phos-
pholipids that we identified, LPA and AGP, both products of
PexRAP (Lodhi et al., 2012), have been reported to activate
PPARg (Stapleton et al., 2011; Tsukahara et al., 2006). The nu-
clear localization of PexRAP and its association with PPARg
2772
Cell Reports 20, 2766–2774, September 19, 2017
 suggest that PexRAP might generate these lipid agonists locally,
thus increasing efficacy and availability to PPARg. Our results
presented here and those of others (Albi and Viola Magni,
2004) suggest that ether lipids, including plasmalogens, are
abundantly present in the nucleus.
PexRAP possesses transcriptional regulatory activity that ex-
tends beyond its established role as a peroxisomal lipid synthetic
enzyme, suggesting a multifaceted role for the protein in adipose
tissue remodeling. Pharmacological inhibition of PexRAP func-
tion in adipose tissue may be an appropriate strategy for treating
obesity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
PexRAP (DHRS7B) knockout-first mice (C57BL/6J genetic background) were
generatedusinga targetingvectorobtainedfromtheEUCOMMrepository.Gen-
eration of PexRAP-iKO mice has been previously described (Lodhi et al., 2015).
To induce knockout, 10- to 12-week-old control (PexRAPlox/lox without Cre) and
PexRAP-iKO (PexRAPlox/lox/Rosa-CreER) mice were treated daily with tamox-
ifen (50 mg/g body weight) for 5 consecutive days. To generate PexRAP-AKO
animals, mice with a floxed PexRAP locus (PexRAPlox/lox) were crossed with
transgenic mice expressing Cre under the control of the adiponectin promoter
(Eguchi et al., 2011). PexRAPlox/lox mice without Cre were used as a control for
PexRAP-AKO mice. Genotyping was performed using previously described
primer sets (Lodhi et al., 2015), and diets included PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 con-
trol chow and Harlan Teklad TD 88137 high-fat diet. Both male and female mice
were used for experiments, as indicated in the figure legends. All protocols were
approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using PureLink RNA kit (Invitrogen) and reverse-tran-
scribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Bio-
systems). qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus
instrument using PowerUP SYBR Green reagent (Applied Biosystems). Pre-
validated primers spanning exon-exon boundaries were used for amplifica-
tions. Assays were performed in duplicate and results were normalized to
ribosomal protein L32 mRNA levels.
Pull-Down Assays
GST-pull-down assays were performed as previously described (Lodhi et al.,
2012). Briefly, cells were lysed using a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 4 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton
X-100, 10 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors (P8340; Sigma-Aldrich). Cell ly-
sates were mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing no Triton
X-100, then 5 mg of GST alone beads or GST fusion protein beads and rocked
at 4C for 2 hr. Samples were spun down at 2,500 3 g for 1 min and washed five
times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 before being resuspended
in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Measurement of Oxygen Consumption Rate in Adipocytes
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in PPARg-MEFs was measured using XF24
Extracellular Flux Analyzer with a FluxPak provided by Seahorse Bioscience.
The cells were seeded and grown to confluence on XF24 cell culture micro-
plates, followed by infection with lentiviral-encoded scrambled or PexRAP
shRNA, as previously described (Lodhi et al., 2012). Media containing lentiviral
shRNA were diluted 1:2 with fresh media prior to infection of cells. Eight days
after the infection, the cells were exposed to browning cocktail to induce
brown adipocyte differentiation for 6 days, as previously described (Fisher
et al., 2012). OCR was measured at 3 min intervals at baseline and after the
addition of oligomycin (3 mM final concentration).
UCP1-GFP Reporter Assay
To construct the UCP1-GFP reporter plasmid, a �5.5 kb UCP1 promoter
was amplified by PCR using liver genomic DNA from a wild-type C57 mouse
and cloned into the pCMV6-AC-GFP plasmid in place of the CMV promoter.
HEK293T cells were grown on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips and trans-
fected with either UCP1-GFP alone, UCP1-GFP and HA-PRDM16, or UCP1-
GFP,
HA-PRDM16,
and
Myc-PexRAP.
Three
days
after
transfection,
coverslips were mounted and imaged with a Leica DMI4000B fluorescence
microscope.
Statistics
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparisons between two groups
were performed using two-tailed Student’s t test. One-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s posttest was used for comparison of more than two groups. P values <
0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.
