In Brief
Acquisition of social preference for
siblings versus non-siblings is dynamic,
but the developmental regulatory
mechanisms have been unclear. Dulcis
et al. found that sustained exposure to
olfactory cues converts non-kin aversion
to attraction via neurotransmitter
switching coordinated by microRNAs.

SUMMARY
Changes in social preference of amphibian larvae
result from sustained exposure to kinship odorants.
To understand the molecular and cellular mecha-
nisms of this neuroplasticity, we investigated the
effects of olfactory system activation on neurotrans-
mitter (NT) expression in accessory olfactory bulb
(AOB) interneurons during development. We show
that protracted exposure to kin or non-kin odor-
ants changes the number of dopamine (DA)- or
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-expressing neu-
rons, with corresponding changes in attraction/aver-
sion behavior. Changing the relative number of dopa-
minergic and GABAergic AOB interneurons or locally
introducing DA or GABA receptor antagonists alters
kinship preference. We then isolate AOB microRNAs
(miRs) differentially regulated across these condi-
tions. Inhibition of miR-375 and miR-200b reveals
that they target Pax6 and Bcl11b to regulate the
dopaminergic and GABAergic phenotypes. The re-
sults illuminate the role of NT switching governing
experience-dependent social preference.
INTRODUCTION
Many animals use olfactory-mediated sibling and non-sibling
recognition via kinship odorants to distinguish between siblings
and non-siblings. 4-day-old (stage 44) X. laevis larvae display
attraction and aversion behavior to water-borne kin and non-
kin odorants, respectively (Waldman and Adler, 1979). Kin and
non-kin refer to odorants while sibling and non-sibling refer to
raising conditions. The olfactory basis of kinship recognition
was demonstrated by showing that larvae with external nares
blocked by a gelatinous paste did not discriminate behaviorally
between siblings and non-siblings (Waldman, 1985).
This social preference of Xenopus tadpoles can be altered by
their exposure to kinship-signaling molecules from non-siblings
versus siblings during embryonic development (Waldman,
1981) and at later stages (Yamazaki et al., 1988) as well as by
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotype differences
(Villinger and Waldman, 2008). Self- and non-self-recognition,
which lie at the core of social behavior, are mediated by activa-
tion of vomeronasal organ (VNO) neurons in mice and frogs (Ben-
Shaul et al., 2010; Chamero et al., 2012; Hagino-Yamagishi et al.,
2004). These olfactory neurons express receptors that are acti-
vated by peptides cleaved from major urinary proteins (MUPs)
or MHC proteins (Kaur et al., 2014; Manning et al., 1992; Sturm
et al., 2013). The larval frog olfactory system has been the object
of extensive studies (Jungblut et al., 2012; Manzini and Schild,
2010; Sansone et al., 2014). VNO receptor cells project to the
accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). These findings suggest that
sibling recognition may result from activation of VNO neurons
by kinship-signaling odorants, generating activity patterns that
lead to circuit plasticity.
Electrical activity and calcium signaling have significant roles
in directing several aspects of neuronal differentiation, including
neurotransmitter (NT) respecification. Sustained changes in
electrical activity by experimental manipulations or by natural
sensory stimuli cause the expression of NTs in CNS neurons
that otherwise produce different ones, both during development
and in the mature nervous system (Borodinsky et al., 2004; Dul-
cis et al., 2013; Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008; Gu and Spitzer, 1995;
Gutie
´ rrez et al., 2003). Transmitter respecification during devel-
opment occurs in reserve pool neurons characterized by
distinct patterns of calcium signaling that combine with tran-
scription factors to create responsiveness to activity manipula-
tions (Demarque and Spitzer, 2010; Dulcis and Spitzer, 2012;
Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014; Marek et al., 2010; Vela
´ zquez-
Ulloa et al., 2011).
Here we examine the mechanisms underlying plasticity of so-
cial preference in the developing accessory olfactory system of
Xenopus larvae and the behaviors that ensue. We discover social
experience-dependent changes in dopamine (DA) and gamma
aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in granule and periglomer-
ular interneurons of the AOB affecting kinship recognition and
preference. These findings may shed light on the olfactory
imprinting of fish (Gerlach et al., 2008; Harden et al., 2006;
Hino et al., 2009; Johnstone et al., 2011) and neonatal attach-
ment in mammals (Janus, 1993; Kendrick et al., 1997a; Porter
and Etscorn, 1974), potentially including humans.

 The
molecular
players
coordinating
the
transcriptional
changes at the core of this experience-dependent NT plasticity
are largely unexplored. MicroRNAs (miRs) are strong candidates
because they mediate post-transcriptional regulation of expres-
sion of multiple genes (Bartel, 2004; Izaurralde, 2015). miRs have
crucial roles at many steps in neurogenesis and brain develop-
ment (Li and Jin, 2010; Yoo et al., 2009), including neuronal
fate determination (Chang et al., 2004; de Chevigny et al.,
2012; Kim et al., 2007). miRs execute and refine these complex
developmental transitions by targeting the mRNAs encoding key
regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and repressors
(Visvanathan et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2013). miRs also help brain
adaptation to environmental perturbations through activity-
dependent forms of plasticity (Krol et al., 2010; McNeill and
Van Vactor, 2012). Testing the hypothesis that miRs are involved
in kinship-induced DA and GABA plasticity observed in the AOB,
we show that miR-200b and miR-375 control Pax6 and Bcl11b
expression and produce NT plasticity that determines kinship
recognition behavior.
RESULTS
Kinship Odorants Drive an Activity-Dependent DA/
GABA Switch in AOB Neurons
Amphibian embryos are laid in clutches, and larvae are normally
exposed to kinship odorants after hatching. To investigate
whether exposure to these odorants affects NT expression in
the AOB, we raised Xenopus larvae with several hundred siblings
until they hatched (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967; stage 39) at
2 days after fertilization. Larvae were then single housed (Fig-
ure S1A) and exposed for 2 days (stage 39 to 44) to kin or non-
kin odorants or to no odorants (Figure 1A). Brains were fixed,
sectioned, and analyzed immunohistochemically (IHC) for the
presence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker for DA expres-
sion) and GABA in AOB neurons (Figure 1B). Genetic programs
had likely set the baseline NT identity (Spitzer, 2017). We found
that the numbers of dopaminergic and GABAergic periglomeru-
lar and granule neurons (Figure S1B, arrows and arrowheads)
depend on exposure to water-borne kin odorants, non-kin odor-
ants, or the absence of odorants (Figures 1B and 1C; Fig-
ure S1C). There was no effect on the total number (mean ± SD)
of AOB granule (297 ± 5 non-sibling; 338 ± 26 orphan; 308 ±
27 sibling) and periglomerular (198 ± 30 non-sibling; 191 ± 9
orphan; 197 ± 12 sibling) neurons (Figure 1C) and total cells
labeled with the nuclear marker DRAQ5 (Figure 2A). Exposure
to kin odorants led to the largest numbers of interneurons
expressing only TH and the smallest numbers of interneurons
expressing GABA in both granule and periglomerular cells.
Exposure to non-kin odorants, in contrast, led to the smallest
numbers of neurons expressing only TH and the largest num-
bers of neurons expressing only GABA. The orphan condition
generated the highest number of TH/GABA co-expressing neu-
rons. This result suggests that co-expression is the default NT
expression in the absence of odorants, potentially generated in
response to remaining spontaneous activity.
To test the activity dependence of kinship-induced NT plas-
ticity, we first quantified AOB interneurons expressing cFos
along with TH and/or GABA in response to kin or non-kin odor-
ants. Only a subset of AOB interneurons was cFos+ in response
to odorants. In non-sibling conditions, cFos was expressed in
many GABA-only cells and GABA/TH co-expressing cells but
not detected in TH-only cells. In sibling conditions, cFos was ex-
pressed in a small number of GABA-only cells, in a large number
of GABA/TH co-expressing cells, and in a significant number of
TH-only cells (Figure 1D).
We then implanted drug-loaded agarose beads unilaterally in
the AOB at the time of single housing to deliver tetrodotoxin
(TTX) to block action potentials or a calcium chelator (BAPTA-
AM) to selectively suppress calcium-mediated activity during
non-kin or kin exposure. Bead delivery of TTX and BAPTA
suppresses sodium channel-dependent action potentials and
calcium-mediated activity in Xenopus larvae (Borodinsky et al.,
2004; Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008). Because BAPTA-AM and
calcein-AM are similar in molecular weight, fluorescent calcein-
AM-loaded beads were used to estimate the extent of drug diffu-
sion from the site of implantation (Figure S2C). Layers of cells
that were 70 mm from the bead had a level of fluorescence (F1)
equal to background (F0) after 24 hr, suggesting that drug appli-
cation was local. Both TTX and BAPTA reduced the number of
GABA neurons and increased the number of TH neurons
compared to sham in the non-sibling condition. In the sibling
condition, TTX increased the number of both GABA neurons
and TH neurons compared to sham (Figure 1E). These results
imply that neurons that appear to be respecifying their NT
possess activity necessary for responsiveness to sensory circuit
activation (Vela
´ zquez-Ulloa et al., 2011). Exposure to non-kin
odorants (Figure 1E, left) caused the expected large number of
GABA+ and small number of TH-only neurons in the AOB contra-
lateral to the bead-implanted side (compare sham with Fig-
ure 1C), confirming local application of the drugs.
Kinship Odorants Do Not Change Cell Number and
Instead Alter the DA/GABA Phenotype by Acting on a
Pax6+ Reserve Pool
The constant number of AOB cells quantified with the nuclear
marker DRAQ5 across conditions (Figure 2A) suggests that NT
switching is not paralleled by changes in the number of neurons.
Experiments testing the presence of cell proliferation (Figures 2B
and 2C) revealed that 3 ± 2 GABA+ neurons/AOB section incor-
porated BrdU following non-kin odorant exposure for 24 hr
(stages 39–42). In contrast, non-kin exposure led to 30 ± 12
newly GABA+ neurons/section (the difference between the
non-sibling and sibling red GABA+ bars in Figure 2C). Thus,
the GABAergic phenotype is expressed in neurons that under-
went their last DNA synthesis before the last 24 hr of non-kin
exposure, and the increased number of GABA neurons is not
due to cellular proliferation. To test whether cell differentiation
is affected more generally during NT respecification, we co-
labeled AOB TH+ and GABA+ interneurons with doublecortin
(DCX), a marker expressed by neuronal precursor cells and
immature neurons. Following non-kin-induced GABA respecifi-
cation (Figure S3A), only 6 ± 4 GABA+ cells/AOB section were
DCX+ at stage 42 in contrast with 30 ± 12 newly GABA+ neu-
rons/section (the difference between the non-sibling and sibling
red GABA+ bars in Figure S3B). These GABA+DCX+ neurons
were not periglomerular (green arrows) or granule GABA+

 neurons (yellow arrows) of the AOB (Figure S3A) but were
located dorsally and ventrally to developed glomeruli (Figures
S3A and S3B, blue arrows). They are likely to be future interneu-
rons serving developing glomeruli that will become active after
stage 49 when class II olfactory receptors recognizing air-borne
odorants are expressed (Mezler et al., 1999). The lack of DCX

 expression in AOB TH+ and GABA+ neurons provides further ev-
idence that this experience-dependent NT respecification is not
occurring in newborn neurons.
Since neurons expressing a newly specified NT are not re-
cruited from undifferentiated neurons, we immunostained the
AOB for transcription factors Pax6 and Lim1,2, which are asso-
ciated with dopaminergic differentiation (Hack et al., 2005), to
identify the switching reserve pool of neurons (Figure 2D; Figures
S1D, S1E, S3C, and S3D). Pax6 expression begins in mouse
AOB progenitor cells and is maintained in mature TH+ neurons,

 while it is downregulated in cells that differentiate as GABAergic
granule neurons (Hack et al., 2005). GABA+ cells were rarely
Lim1,2+ (Figure S3D), and its role was not considered further.
To test the hypothesis that Pax6+ neurons represent the reserve
pool able to respecify NT following exposure to different kinship
odorants, we first determined whether Pax6 expression changes
in response to different kinship odorant exposure during devel-
opment. We found that the number of Pax6+ neurons varies
across the three kinship-raising conditions (Figure 2D). Pax6 is
expressed in all TH+ cells across conditions; however, it is also
expressed in 8% of GABA-only cells in the non-sibling condition,
35% of GABA-only cells in the orphan condition, and 50% of
GABA-only cells in the sibling condition. These results indicate
that the reserve pool of Pax6+ cells is dynamic.
To test whether Pax6 expression is necessary for recruitment
to the dopaminergic phenotype during kinship odorant expo-
sure, we electroporated fluorescein-tagged oligo morpholinos
selectively targeting Pax6 transcripts (Rungger-Br€
andle et al.,
2010) into the two-cell stage embryo. This electroporation down-
regulates Pax6 expression during induction of NT respecification
in sibling conditions. A dose-response analysis identified the
minimal concentration of Pax6 morpholino (10 ng/embryo)
required to achieve a marginal eye disruption phenotype (Fig-
ure 2E). Knocking down 83% of Pax6 expression blocked 90%
of the kin-induced increase in TH-expression. Pax6+ neurons
are unlikely to be immature precursors waiting to acquire a NT
identity since quantification of the Pax6+ pool double stained
for TH and GABA showed that all Pax6+ cells already express
either TH or GABA. Additionally, Pax6+ neurons do not express
DCX in both kin and non-kin conditions (data not shown). How-
ever, we cannot exclude that early Pax6 morpholino treatment
may have affected NT switching by a different mechanism other
than a purely kin odorant effect.
Because neurogenesis is absent, the sibling condition is
likely to recruit a number of GABAergic neurons expressing
the Pax6 transcription factor (Figure S1E, arrows) to become
dopaminergic neurons expressing Pax6 but no longer ex-
pressing GABA. Consistent with the association of Pax6
expression with dopaminergic differentiation, the Pax6 mor-
pholino reduced the number of TH+ cells. This result suggests
that neurons switch transmitters in response to kin odorants,
losing expression of one (GABA) and gaining expression of
another (DA).
Transmitter Switching Is Partially Reversible and
Specific to AOB Neurons
To test the reversibility of transmitter switching, we first exposed
larvae to non-kin odorants for 24 hr (from stage 39 to stage 42)
and then exposed these larvae to either kin or non-kin odorants
for another 24 hr (stage 42 to stage 44). Granule and periglomer-
ular interneurons were identified by their positions in the AOB.
The induction of GABA expression observed after 1 day of expo-
sure to non-kin odorants was not fully reversed by a second day
of exposure to kin odorants. However, this second day exposure
induced a significant increase in the number of TH+ cells co-
expressing GABA (Figure 2F; Figure S4A). These results indicate
partial reversibility that may become greater with longer periods
of reversed odorant exposure.
In contrast to NT switching in the AOB granule and periglomer-
ular neurons, there was no change in the number of neuropep-
tide-Y+ (NPY+) neurons located adjacent to AOB GABAergic
neurons (Figure S4B) or in the number of TH+ neurons of another
dopaminergic
nucleus,
the
suprachiasmatic
nucleus
(Fig-
ure S4C), between sibling and non-sibling raising conditions.
To
investigate
other
neuronal
components
of
the
AOB
circuit, we immunostained the vesicular glutamate transporter
(VGLUT1,2) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). This
identified the glutamatergic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)
that provide VNO sensory input to the AOB and the NOS+
mitral cells that are the principal AOB output. We observed a
conserved glutamatergic ORN projection pattern and glomerular
neuropil and detected no changes in the number of NOS+ mitral
cells across conditions (Figures S4D and S4E).
Neurotransmitter Switching Is Paralleled by Changes in
Social Preference
We next tested kin recognition behavior in groups of 50 free-
swimming larvae using a novel larval distribution assay (Fig-
ure 3A). We found that different numbers of TH-only and
GABA-only neurons are correlated with the way in which AOB
circuitry processes kin/non-kin odorants and generates an
attractive or aversive response to these odorants. Shortly after
odorant-conditioned saline is placed in one of the inserts at
each end of the test tank, larvae initiate active swimming that
lasts 5–10 min (sampling phase). Each larva can sample the
entire length of the container in as little as 5 s (Figure 3A,
dashed line). Sibling-raised larvae cluster at one end of the
container by swimming either toward the kin odorant-releasing
insert (Figure 3B) or away from the non-kin odorant-diffusing
insert until they stop swimming after about 10 min (kinship
recognition
phase).
Swimming
gradually
resumes
as
the
odorant gradient in the solution between the two inserts dissi-
pates, and larvae then distribute equally across the two sides
of the tank (rebound phase). Since the differences in larval dis-
tribution are most significant after 10 min and 15 min from
insert loading, these data points were averaged. A percent
larval distribution ratio (LDR) was calculated by dividing the
average number of larvae distributed on the side containing
the kinship odorant by the total number of larvae for each
experiment and condition. The initial LDR value before odorant
introduction was always 50%.
Larvae raised in the sibling condition, which is typical in na-
ture, display attraction to kin odorants (60% LDR) and aversion
to non-kin odorants (37% LDR) (Figures S5A and S5B; Movie S1
illustrates behavior during 20 s of free swimming). Changes in
the numbers of granule and periglomerular interneurons ex-
pressing TH and/or GABA obtained by raising larvae in the
non-sibling and orphan conditions are correlated with altered
kinship recognition behavior. Larvae raised in the non-sibling
condition, with an AOB configuration of a high number of
GABA-only neurons and reduced number of TH-only neurons,
broaden their social preference. These larvae now display an
attractive response to non-kin odorants (65% LDR) in addition
to kin odorants (Figure 3C; Figures S5C and S5D). Retention
of attraction to kin odorants suggests that this is innate or
learned during the first 2 days of development and is preserved
Neuron 95, 1319–1333, September 13, 2017
1323
 after experience-dependent learning of attraction to non-kin
odorants. Larvae raised in the orphan condition, with an AOB
configuration characterized by the highest TH/GABA co-
expression, display a general reduction of social preference.
These larvae exhibit aversion to non-kin odorants (37% LDR)
as well as to kin odorants (34% LDR; Figure 3C; Figures S5E
and S5F). Loss of the attraction response to kin odorants dis-
played by orphan larvae suggests that the lack of kinship cue
experience during development from stage 39 to stage 44
puts the AOB in a default state that overrides the innate or
learned attraction response to kin odorants. We also measured
the LDR of sibling-, non-sibling-, and orphan-raised larvae in
response to powdered pellets of Xenopus food (Zeigler), a mix
containing 12 different amino acids. This is a non-social cue
and was consistently attractive during changes in social prefer-
ence across raising conditions, demonstrating specificity of the
effects of social cue-induced AOB processing of social prefer-
ence (Figure 3C; Figures S5G and S5H).
Newly Dopaminergic Neurons Appear Sufficient to Drive
Sibling Recognition
We then investigated the role of newly dopaminergic neurons
in altered kinship recognition behavior, since kin and non-kin
odorants may change other features of olfactory circuitry in
addition to TH and GABA expression in granule and periglomer-
ular neurons. To detect a causal connection between neurons
with newly respecified NTs and altered kinship recognition
behavior, we first ablated pre-existing dopaminergic neurons
in the AOB by local exposure to the dopaminergic neurotoxin
MPTP (Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008) delivered via agarose bead im-
plantation (Figures 4A and 4B; Figure S6B). Dose/response
quantification of MPTP efficacy showed that 800 mM MPTP ab-
lates 100% of TH+ interneurons while sparing TH neurons in the
AOB as well as TH+ neurons of the neighboring ventral main
olfactory bulb (Figure 4C; Figure S6B, arrows). This treatment
prevented attraction to kin odorants (50% LDR; Figure 4D), sug-
gesting that dopaminergic neurons in the AOB are necessary for
normal processing of kinship odorants to elicit attraction to sib-
lings. We next exposed MPTP-treated larvae to kin odorants for
24 hr to induce DA respecification of spared GABA+TH�
reserve pool neurons in the presence of the MPTP blocker dep-
renyl (Tatton and Greenwood, 1991) (Figure 4A). This treatment
led to 88% restoration of attraction to kin odorants (70% LDR;
Figure 4D). The functional rescue suggests that newly specified
DA-expressing neurons are sufficient to fulfill the dopaminergic
requirement mediating kinship recognition behavior toward
siblings.
Selective Blockade of AOB DA or GABA Receptors
Suppresses Attraction or Aversion Behaviors
Because we found that the numbers of GABA- and TH-express-
ing neurons in the AOB are experience dependent (Figures 1B
and 1C), we investigated how GABA and DA contribute to AOB
processing of attraction versus aversion behaviors in response
to kin and non-kin odorants. To achieve local receptor blockade
in the AOB of larvae raised in the sibling condition, we implanted
agarose beads impregnated with NT receptor antagonists. Given
the involvement of D2 receptors in frog olfactory processing
(Davison et al., 2004), we blocked D2 receptors with sulpiride
and found that this abolished attraction (50% LDR) to kin odor-
ants without affecting aversion (30% LDR) to non-kin signals
(Figure 4E). In contrast, blockade of GABAAB receptors by

 in the sibling condition. The profiles of GABA-only, TH-only, and
GABA/TH neurons in the AOBs of non-sibling and orphan larvae
are different from the DA and GABA AOB profiles of sibling
larvae, suggesting that each raising condition generates a
distinct circuit configuration. Thus, NT switching affecting the
locations of synaptic release of GABA and DA within the AOB
may lead to the atypical recognition behaviors observed in
non-sibling and orphan larvae.
Small RNA Profiling Identifies miRs Differentially
Regulated by Kinship Exposure
miRs have frequently emerged as regulators of coordinated
multicomponent signaling pathways. To test the involvement of
miRs in regulating transmitter switching, we sequenced small
RNAs from AOB tissue harvested from animals exposed to sib-
ling and non-sibling conditions and obtained close to 400 miRs
in each case. To select miR candidates that could mediate NT re-
specification, we applied three criteria. First, we focused on me-
dium-to-highly expressed miRs (1%–20% of the total reads) that
more likely mediate significant regulation of gene expression
(Mullokandov et al., 2012). Second, we chose miRs that had

the largest fold changes between sibling
and non-sibling conditions. Third, we
identified miRs predicted to regulate
genes in the DA or GABA pathways. We
included regulatory genes (transcription
factors and genes determining neuronal
NT identity) and genes involved in NT
metabolism (synthetic enzymes, trans-
porters, degradative enzymes, and re-
ceptors) (Table S1). Bioinformatics tools
were used to identify predicted miR
responsive elements
(MREs) in each
transcript; excluding the miRs that were
not predicted to target the transcripts
reduced the number for qPCR validation.
This strategy produced a list of 18 miR
candidates potentially involved in NT
switching between dopaminergic and
GABAergic phenotypes in sibling and non-sibling conditions
(Figures 5A and 5B; Figure S7C).
miR-375/miR-200b Regulate DA/GABA Phenotype
Switching in the AOB
To validate the top miR candidates, we performed qPCR from
three independent clutches of larvae raised in the presence of
kin or non-kin odorants. This analysis revealed significantly
elevated expression of miR-148a, miR-375, miR-200b, miR-
429, miR-214, miR-101, and miR-499 in non-sibling versus sib-
ling conditions (Figure 5C; miR-200b and miR-429 are similar
in sequence, and their seeds are identical). We performed a sec-
ondary analysis among these kinship-dependent miRs to identify
those directly targeting two genes known to be determinants of
the dopaminergic and GABAergic phenotypes in the olfactory
bulb: Pax6 (Hack et al., 2005) and Bcl11b (Enomoto et al.,
2011). The expected interactions of these miR candidates with
Pax6 or Bcl11b mRNAs were suggested by the presence of their
highly conserved MREs on the target genes (Figures 6A and 6B).
Interestingly, both miR-375 and miR-200b are predicted to
target MREs on Pax6 mRNA; miR-200b, miR-214, miR-101,

 and miR-499 are predicted to recognize MREs on Bcl11b mRNA
(Figures S7A and S7B). MiR-148a targeted neither Pax6 nor
Bcl11b transcripts and was not analyzed further.
To specifically inhibit each miR individually in vivo, we de-
signed (Exiqon) locked nucleic acid (LNA) miR antagonists and
delivered them locally in the AOB. The levels of the mRNA for
Pax6 and Bcl11b were then determined by qPCR to evaluate
their potential roles as regulators of NT respecification. MiR-
375 and miR-200b emerged as the most promising candidates
(Figures 6C–6E; Figures S7D–S7H). Consistent with previous
findings (de Chevigny et al., 2012), the inhibitor for miR-375
(a.375) increased Pax6 levels (Figures 6C and 6D) but had no ef-
fect on Bcl11b levels (Figure 6E). MiR-200b, however, appeared
to play a double role as a coherent regulator targeting both Pax6
and Bcl11b transcripts (Figures 6C–6E). While the miR-200b
MREs on Bcl11b are well conserved, the MREs on Pax6 are
nearly exclusive to Xenopus, suggesting species-specific regu-
lation (Figures S6A and S6B). These data indicate that increased
miR-375 and miR-200b levels in non-sibling conditions could
contribute both to the reduction of TH-only neurons by sup-
pressing expression of the stimulatory Pax6 transcription factor
and to the increase in GABA-only neurons by suppressing pro-
duction of the inhibitory Bcl11b transcription factor.
To determine whether miR-375 and miR-200b regulate mRNA
levels of Pax6 and Bcl11b by direct interaction with their tran-
scripts, we utilized LNA target-site blockers (TSBs, Exiqon).
A TSB selectively protects the MRE on a specific mRNA by stop-
ping a given miR from binding and repressing its expression,
leaving all other mRNA targets unaffected (Lippi et al., 2016) (Fig-
ures 6A and 6B, third oligonucleotide pair). Local delivery to the
AOB of the TSB protecting the miR-375 MRE on Pax6 (Pax6-
375-TSB) increased Pax6 mRNA levels comparable to those
achieved with a.375 (Figures 6F and 6G). Similarly, the TSB
protecting the miR-200b MRE on Bcl11b (Bcl11b-200b-TSB)
upregulated Bcl11b transcripts (Figure 6H). No effect on Pax6
levels in the AOB was observed with TSBs protecting the two
miR-200b sites on Pax6 (Pax6-200b-TSB) (Figures 6F and 6G),
suggesting that regulation of Pax6 by miR-200b is through a
non-canonical MRE or indirect.
To ascertain whether changes in the levels of miR-375 and/or
miR-200b transcripts were sufficient to drive changes in the
number of dopaminergic and/or GABAergic neurons in vivo,
we performed TH/GABA immunostaining on AOBs from antago-
nist- or TSB-treated larvae raised in the non-sibling condition
(Figure 7). Larvae received a.375 or a.200b either by electropo-
ration at an early stage (Figure S6A) or by infusion of in vivo ready
LNAs/TSBs at a later stage. Electroporation of a.375 blocked the
typical reduction of the dopaminergic phenotype induced
by non-kin exposure (Figure 7A). In contrast, electroporation of
a control antagonist (a.Ctrl) not targeting any miR under the
same conditions did not block the reduction. The ability of
miR-375 to repress the dopaminergic phenotype was confirmed
when the AOB was infused with an in vivo ready Pax6-375-TSB
(Figures 7B and 7E). This experiment demonstrates that miR-375
exerts its inhibitory function by direct interaction with the Pax6
target transcript. Notably, the Pax6-375-TSB had no effect on
the number of GABAergic neurons (Figure 7E).
When we infused in vivo ready a.200b into the AOB of larvae
raised in non-sibling conditions to selectively block miR-200b
function, we observed two distinct effects: a reduction in the
number of GABAergic neurons with a simultaneous increase in
the number of dopaminergic neurons (arrows, Figures 7C and
7F). The ability of miR-200b to reduce the GABAergic phenotype
was confirmed by infusing the AOB with an in vivo ready Bcl11b-
200b-TSB (Figures 7D and 7G). This test demonstrates that
miR-200b exerts its function on the GABA phenotype by direct
interaction with the Bcl11b target transcript. The infusion of
Bcl11b-200b-TSB did not, however, replicate the effect of
a.200b on the dopaminergic neurons. Since a.200b increases
both Pax6 and Bcl11b transcript levels, these data suggest an
important role for miR-200b as a regulator of the genetic switch
between DA and GABA (Ebert and Sharp, 2012).
DISCUSSION
Here we identify cellular mechanisms of activity-dependent neu-
roplasticity that drive activity-dependent acquisition of social
preference. We show that prolonged exposure of sibling larvae
to kin odorants drives changes in NT expression from GABA to
DA in Xenopus AOB neurons recruited from a GABA+PAX6+
pool, accompanied by behavioral preference for kin odorants.
In contrast, sustained exposure of sibling larvae to non-kin odor-
ants induces a DA-to-GABA shift in AOB neurons and a parallel
aversion-to-attraction shift in social preference toward the same

 non-kin odorants. These findings are reminiscent of the mecha-
nism described for acquired imprinting that occurs in early
neonatal life in sheep (Kendrick et al., 1997b), resulting in an in-
crease in the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory tone in granule cell
synapses onto mitral cells. Orphan-raised larvae have a large
number of neurons co-expressing DA and GABA and avoid
both kin and non-kin odorants. The number of AOB interneurons
expressing only DA and only GABA changes in response to
developmental exposure to kinship odorants in the absence
of neurogenesis. NT respecification has been shown to occur
through activation of the visual pathway both in the developing
amphibian nervous system (Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008) and in
the adult rat brain (Dulcis et al., 2013). NT plasticity in the mouse
AOB and the main olfactory bulb (Cave et al., 2010) indicates that
this form of transmitter reconfiguration can be elicited by activa-
tion of other sensory modalities. Induction of NT switching has
been described in adult mice (Aumann et al., 2013; Kesby
et al., 2017) and may occur in humans (Aumann et al., 2016).
NT switching in a given circuit has powerful consequences for
circuit function, since neuromodulation of a single target neuron
can dramatically alter the performance of an entire network (Gu-
tierrez and Marder, 2014). Selective blockade of DA or GABA

 transmission in the AOB indicated the specific roles of these two
transmitters in kinship recognition displayed by larvae raised in
sibling conditions, as described for zebrafish (Scerbina et al.,
2012; Souza et al., 2011). Ablation of endogenously dopami-
nergic neurons in sibling-raised larvae followed by kin odorant
induction of newly dopaminergic neurons recruited from the
reserve pool affirmed their contribution to attraction to kin. How-
ever, experience-dependent
NT respecification leading to
increased DA and GABA co-expression (orphan condition) led
to aversion to both kin and non-kin odorants. Respecification
to an increased number of GABA-only neurons (non-sibling con-
dition) led to attraction to both non-kin and kin odorants. We
conclude that the different configuration of NT expression and
release in the AOB, and not the class of NTs alone, determines
the control of aversion versus attraction behaviors toward
kinship cues. Reversal of social preference in frogs and zebrafish
with sexual maturation (Gerlach and Lysiak, 2006) suggests that
experience-dependent DA/GABA transmitter switching in the
AOB induced by atypical kinship exposure during development
may also be activated in adults.
Cellular changes in NT expression are achieved by genetic
regulation mediated by miRs. RNA profiling of the AOB detected
miRs that are regulated across kinship conditions and identified
miR-375 and miR-200b as key regulators mediating DA and
GABA switching (Figure 8). We find that miR-375 inhibits Pax6
through a previously described MRE (Bhinge et al., 2016; de
Chevigny et al., 2012). Although the role of Pax6 as a determinant
of the dopaminergic phenotype in the olfactory bulb is well es-
tablished (Brill et al., 2008; Hack et al., 2005; Kohwi et al.,
2005; Ninkovic et al., 2010), its regulation by miRs as a develop-
mental switch appeared only recently. miRs regulate transcrip-
tion factor levels during development to modulate many aspects
of neuronal identity (Amin et al., 2015; Bhinge et al., 2016; Chen
et al., 2011; de Chevigny et al., 2012; Thiebes et al., 2015).
Because kinship odorants also modulate GABA expression in
AOB interneurons, we investigated the functional role of miRs

Mechanisms
Involved in Neurotransmitter Respecifica-

Kinship raising conditions provide olfactory cues
that determine behavioral attraction or aversion
toward siblings and non-siblings. These cues can
also affect social preference. Sustained kin (sibling

opment

that are upregulated in non-sibling condi-
tions and are predicted to recognize
a conserved MRE on transcription factor
Bcl11b transcripts. We show that miR-
200b, controlling olfactory neurogenesis
in mice (Choi et al., 2008) and eye devel-
opment in X. laevis (Gessert et al., 2010),
directly regulates Bcl11b expression levels. Bcl11b inhibits
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling (Tang et al.,
2011), potentially providing a link between miR-200b-mediated
Bcl11b regulation and GABA expression since BDNF stimulates
the GABA phenotype of developing spinal neurons (Guemez-
Gamboa et al., 2014). Accordingly, we suggest that non-kin
odorants detected by ORN receptors increase neural activity in
odor-specific pathways, inducing c-Fos expression and driving
the activity-dependent increase of miR-200b in VNO interneu-
rons that inhibits translation of its target Bcl11b. A reduction of
Bcl11b expression may increase BDNF and upregulate GABA
in AOB interneurons.
MiR-200b has a pivotal role in reciprocal regulation of DA/
GABA phenotype switching. Infusion of a.200b to selectively
block miR-200b function in the AOB elicited both a reduction
in the number of GABAergic neurons and a coordinated increase
in the number of dopaminergic neurons. Since a.200b increases
both Pax6 and Bcl11b mRNA levels, it appears to regulate a ge-
netic switch for DA and GABA, sharpening the transition to GABA
phenotype by inhibiting both the activator, Pax6, and the
repressor, Bcl11b. Future work will determine the molecular ba-
sis of NT switching induced by kin odorants. miR-dependent co-
ordination of gene expression regulates behavior in a variety of
settings (Gascon et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2013) that can depend
on social context (Shi et al., 2013).
How are odor responses linked to miR expression? There are
two classes of odor response. The first, in response to a brief
exposure to an odor, is behavioral. The second, in response to
a sustained exposure to an odor, is metabolic, changing the
behavioral response when the larvae are later briefly exposed
to a particular odor. Different miRs lead to expression of different
NTs, which in turn activate circuits, causing different behaviors.
We speculate that the ecological functions of attraction to sib-
lings and avoidance of non-siblings are to promote the survival
of the respective gene pools in the face of predation. Sibling
acquisition of attraction to non-siblings, which constitutes a

 form of adoption, may promote survival of the species. Whether
or not there are other longer-term benefits to these behaviors re-
mains to be determined.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Establishment of Unrelated Xenopus Lines
To ensure that we used two groups of Xenopus laevis embryos that shared no relation to each other, we performed the following
crosses: Colony1 \ 3 Colony1 _, yielding ‘‘population 1’’ and Colony2 \ 3 Colony2 _, yielding ‘‘population 2.’’ Colony1 frogs
were purchased from Nasko; Colony2 frogs were bought from Xenopus Express. These two groups of animals were kept separate
throughout the experiments. Ovulation was induced by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (Merck). Female frogs were
primed 12 hr prior to collection and fertilization of eggs. Embryos were allowed to develop for 2 days (to stage 39) in closely packed
clusters and then exposed to odorants. The correct developmental stage was determined according to developmental tables
(Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967; http://www.xenbase.org/anatomy/alldev.do); following odorant exposure, stage 44 was confirmed
by quantification of the total number of DRAQ5+ cells per AOB performed in histological sections.
METHOD DETAILS
Collection of Kinship Odorants
Two days post-fertilization, when the majority of the embryos had hatched, odorants were collected by first washing the embryos
with 10% MMR (composition: NaCl (100 mM), KCl (2 mM), MgSO4 (1 mM), HEPES (5 mM), EDTA (0.1 mM) and CaCl2 (2 mM) in Fisher
water). Concentrated odorant solution was then generated by 125 embryos placed in bottles containing 50 mL 10% MMR for 2 days.
Exposure of Embryos to Odorants
Fifty stage 39 embryos were individually placed in 200 ml of solution conditioned by sibling or non-sibling embryos (Figure S1A). To
minimize the accumulation of self-generated kin cues, the solution of individual wells containing single-housed larvae was replaced
every 12 hr with fresh, concentrated odorant solution conditioned by the same class of odorants until the larvae had developed to
stage 44 (2 days later) and were ready for immunocytochemical examination or behavioral testing.
For reversibility experiments, larvae were first exposed to non-kin odorants for 24 hr (from stage 39 to stage 42), then exposed to
either kin or non-kin odorants for another 24 hr (stage 42 to stage 44) followed by processing for immunocytochemistry for TH
and GABA.
Local Delivery of Pharmacological Agents
Spatial and temporal control of delivery of pharmacological agents from 80 mm agarose beads loaded with solutions of these agents
has proved highly effective (Borodinsky et al., 2004; Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008). Beads were washed in 2 mM calcium saline for 2–4 hr
at 22�C and loaded for 1 hr in a bi-directional rotator (Barnstead International) with a Marc’s Modified Ringers (MMR) solution con-
taining 10 mM calcein-AM (Invitrogen), 10 mM BAPTA-AM (Invitrogen), 10 mM TTX (Sigma), 10 nM sulpiride (Sigma) for D2 DA receptor
blockade, 500 mM gabazine/phaclofen (Tocris) for GABAA,B receptor blockade, or 800 mM MPTP (Sigma) for DA neuron ablation.
Deprenyl (100 mM, Sigma) was used as MPTP-blocker during kin-induced respecification. Stage 39 larvae were anesthetized with
0.05% tricaine (Pentair) before the lateral margin of the AOB was incised and the bead was inserted (Figures S2A and S2B), then
allowed to develop for 24-48 hr before behavioral testing and fixation.

 Immunocytochemistry
Larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.025% glutaraldehyde in PBS at pH 7.4 for 1–2 h at 4�C, rinsed twice in Dulbecco’s
calcium–magnesium-free PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (Tissue-Tek)
for cryostat sections. 10 mm sections were taken following an anterior to posterior progression through the forebrain. One or 2 night
incubation at 4�C with primary antibodies to TH (Imgenex), GABA (Millipore), Doublecortin (Abcam), Pax6 (Covance); BrdU (AbD
Serotec); VGLUT 1,2 (Synaptic Systems), nNOS (Millipore), and c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was followed by incubation
with fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies for 1 hr 30 min at 20–22�C. Immunoreactivity of stained sections was examined on a
SP5 Leica confocal system; z-stacks were acquired to confirm colocalization and to generate through-series projections. TH, the
rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis, was used as a marker for DA and confirmed by DA immunostaining.
BrdU Staining
To understand whether AOB neurons recruited for transmitter respecification represent newly born cells or pre-existing neurons,
cells proliferating during kin/non-kin conditioning were identified by BrdU (Sigma) labeling. Stage 39 larvae were exposed to BrdU
by immersion in 4 mg/ml in 10% MMR for 24 hr. Specimens (stage 42 and 45) were fixed and sucrose-cryoprotected. 10 mm cryostat
sections were treated for 20 min in 2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl; Fisher Scientific) for antigen retrieval and then washed and incubated
with rat anti-BrdU antibody (AbD Serotec) overnight.
Morpholino Knockdown
Morpholino oligomers (Gene Tools) were used to knock down Pax6 expression. The Pax6 morpholino sequence (50 GCTGTGAC
TGTTCTGCATGTCGAG 30) and concentration (15 ng/embryo) have been shown to be effective in Xenopus embryos (Rungger-
Br€
andle et al., 2010). The manufacturer’s unspecific standard oligo (50 CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA 30) was used as control.
The morpholino was fluorescein-labeled to follow its distribution during embryonic development. Effective protein knockdown was
quantified by Pax6 immunolocalization.
Larval Distribution Behavioral Assay
A glass tank 9.0 3 21.3 3 3 cm was washed with deionized water and placed on top of a white light source that provided uniform
illumination for photography. The tank was leveled and filled with 100 mL of 10% MMR. Two Millipore Millicell culture plate inserts
that had been soaked in 10% MMR for an hr were placed on opposite ends of this container, 1.5 cm from the edge. An opaque, white
paper barrier was placed around the container to eliminate external visual cues that might distract larvae and affect their swimming.
Fifty stage 44 larvae were washed twice in 10% MMR and transferred to the container as a single group, allowed to distribute equally
to the two sides of the dish and photographed from above the container to mark the time zero distribution. Liquid was removed from
the inserts, one was refilled with 10% MMR and the other at the opposite end was refilled with odorant; the end at which the odorants
were placed was switched for each experiment. To assay the behavioral response to food, powdered pellets of Xenopus diet (Zeigler)
were crushed and dissolved in 10% MMR to obtain a mix containing 12 different amino acids (Arginine, Lysine, Methionine, Cysteine,
Tryptophan, Histidine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Threonine, Valine). Tests were carried out in the morning when
swimming is most robust; photographs were taken every 5 min for 30 min to record changes in the distribution of larvae in the
container (Movie S1). The numbers of larvae on each side were photographed, scored and plotted as a function of time (Figures
3A and 3B; Figure S5). A percent larval distribution ratio (LDR) was calculated by dividing the average number of larvae distributed
on the side containing the kinship odorant (mean of 15 min and 20 min data points) by the total number of larvae for each experiment
and condition.
MicroRNA Analysis
The AOBs of 15 larvae (stage 44) raised in sibling or non-sibling conditions were frozen, cryosectioned at 50 mm and neuronal tissue
was harvested with scalpels under the scope for selective AOB isolation. Total RNA was extracted from tissue with the ‘‘Recover All
Total Nucleic Acid’’ isolation kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and degraded samples excluded from
RNA sequencing. Library preparation and RNA sequencing (HiSeq, Illumina) were performed at the UCSD Biogem core following
manufacturer’s recommendations. To identify miRs potentially involved in NT respecification we compiled a list of proteins (including
transcription factors and proteins involved in NT metabolism (Table S1) involved in the production and release of DA and GABA,
searching databases available at iHOP, BioGRID, and KEGG Pathway websites. We then used Targetscan (Lewis et al., 2005) to
identify predicted miR Responsive elements (MRE) in their 30-UTRs and cross-referenced this list with the miRs altered by sibling
versus non-sibling conditions. Top candidates targeted key genes that were differentially expressed in the three conditions.
Semiquantitative PCR
qPCR was used to measure levels of both miRs and their mRNA targets. Total RNA was extracted as described above. Levels of miRs
were assessed using TaqMan microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturer’s recommendations. For reverse tran-
scription, sequence-specific primers were added for each miR being tested and for the housekeeping gene U6. The assays used
(assay number in brackets) were: miR-92b (007028_mat); miR-125a (007071_mat); miR-183 (000484); miR-148a (000470); miR-
30d (000420); miR-30c (000419); miR-205a (000509); miR-375 (007201_mat); miR-200b (006005); miR-429 (001077); miR-129

 (000590); miR-203 (004590_mat); miR-214 (000517); miR-218 (000521); miR-30e (002223); miR-101 (000438); miR-1b (008022); miR-
499 (005772);
Levels of miR-target mRNAs were assessed with Universal Probe Library (UPL) Taqman Assays (Roche), following manufacturer’s
recommendations. Reverse transcription was performed as previously described (Lippi et al., 2011). Each qPCR experiment used
3-6 clutches of larvae per condition. Primers for each assay were designed using the Roche online tool (Assay Design Center).
The list of the primers used includes their respective UPL probe:
Pax6a. Forward: catctggcaccacctctaca; Reverse: ggttcactgccgggtactt; Probe: 95.
Pax6b. Forward: tgggcaacaatctacctatgc; Reverse: ggttcactgccgggtactt; Probe: 95.
Bcl11b. Forward: cgcttaaaccccatgacaa; Reverse: ttctcttagccttcgggaaa; Probe: 67.
GAPDH. Forward: agggaatcctgggatacacac; Reverse: attccagcatcagcatcaaa; Probe: 25
Real-Time PCR analysis was conducted on a Light Cycler 480 system (Roche), and data were processed and analyzed using the
comparative DCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
MiR Antagonists and TSBs
Fluorescein-tagged LNA antagonists (Exiqon) were designed to inhibit miR candidates:
miR-375 (a.375: 50/56-FAM/ACGCGAGCCGAACGAACAAA/30);
miR-200b (a.200b: 50/56-FAM/ATTACCAGGCAGTATT/30);
miR-214 (a.214: 50/56-FAM/CTGTCTGTGCCTGCTG/30);
miR-148a (a.148a: 50/56-FAM/AAGTTCTGTAGTGCAC/30);
miR-101 (a.101: 50/56-FAM/TCAGCTATCACAGTACT/30);
miR-499 (a.499: 50/56-FAM/ATCACTGCAAGTCTTA/30);
control LNA antagonist (a.Ctrl: 50/56-FAM/GTGTAACACGTCTATACGCCCA/30).
Fluorescein-tagged LNA TSBs (Exiqon) were designed to protect mRNA targets from miR regulation:
Pax6-375-TSB (50/56-FAM/TTTGTTCCAACTGATA/30);
Pax6-200b-TSB (50/56-FAM/AAATACTGCTGAACAT/30);
Bcl11b-200b-TSB1 (50/56-FAM/TGAATACTGTAAACG/30);
Bcl11b-200b-TSB2 (50/56-FAM/TACAAATACTGGTCCA/30);
Electroporation of miR LNA Antagonists
Antagonists were electroporated (50 nM) at stage 21-23 (Figure S6A). Successful electroporations exhibited fluorescence
localization limited to the AOB at stage 31. Embryos were allowed to develop until stage 39, exposed for 48 hr to non-kin odorants
and processed for TH immunocytochemistry at stage 44.
Infusions of In Vivo Ready Antagonists and TSBs
Injection needles were prepared from glass capillaries (1 mm OD x 0.5 mm ID; FHC) using a Brown-Flaming electrode puller and
loaded with 2 mL of 10 mM 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-tagged antagonists or TSB aliquots using Eppendorf microloader tips.
Electrode tips were then manually broken under a dissecting microscope using forceps to achieve a size that ejected 5 nL with a
200-250 msec pulse at 30-60 psi. 20-30 stage 39 larvae were transferred to a mesh-lined Petri dish containing 0.05% tricaine in
10% MMR. Larvae were injected unilaterally (one pulse per side) in the AOB just dorsally to the olfactory pit. LNA-injected larvae
were transferred to a Petri dish with fresh 10% MMR saline for recovery. Development was monitored until stage 42 when larvae
were fixed and sectioned for immunoprocessing.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data acquisition and quantification were performed blind. Data analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel and Statistical analysis
with GraphPad Prism 7. Statistical details (definition of test, exact value of N, means ± standard deviations, p values) are listed in each
Figure Legend.
All datasets were tested for normal distribution and equal variances. Departure from normality was assessed with D’Agostino-
Pearson omnibus normality test. The variance was calculated with F-test. Grubbs’ test was used to exclude outliers from normally
distributed datasets.
Two-groups comparison: Unpaired Student’s t test was used for all experiments with normal distribution and equal variances.
Welch’s t test was used when the variances were not equal. Mann-Whitney U test was used for datasets that were not normally
distributed.

 Three- or more groups comparison: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test,
was used for experiments with normal distribution. Kruskal-Wallis’ test followed by a Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used for
datasets that were not normally distributed.
For all tests, p < 0.05 was used as threshold for significant difference. For all tests P values are two-tailed.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
For alignment and statistical analysis, RNA sequencing data were first analyzed with Bowtie (version 0.12.8) and mapped reads were
aligned with their mature miR (miRNA) sequences using using miRDeep2 with miRBase version-19 (Friedl€
ander et al., 2008; Kozo-
mara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011). miR read counts were quantile normalized using preprocesscore library (Bioconductor 3.1, R 3.2) to
determine relative fold changes of miRs between experiments; miR read counts were normalized within each sample (standard score
from normal distribution). Due to the limited coverage of the Xenopus laevis genome we aligned the small RNA sequencing reads to all
known miR databases (miRBase 20), giving priority to closely related species (e.g., Xenopus tropicalis). Redundant miRs (for example
hsa-miR-1 and mmu-miR-1) were manually excluded based on sequence similarity. Sequence and processed data are available at
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=gdcrgkkelrchfmv&acc=GSE78854 through GEO: GSE78854.
