Adult Liver Transplant
Introduction
In 2014, 6729 liver transplants were performed in adults.
These included 6449 organs from deceased donors and 280
from living donors (Figure LI 4.1). As of December 31,
2014, 14,632 candidates were registered on the waiting list,
including 12,204 in active status (Figure LI 1.1). Waitlist
mortality remained a concern; in 2014, 1821 patients died
whilewaitingforatransplantandanother1290wereremoved
from the list due to being too sick to undergo transplant
(Table LI 1.2).
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tended to dominate the
indications for liver transplant in 2014 (Figure LI 4.2). As
of June 30, 2014, nearly 72,000 adults were living with a
functioning liver graft (Figure LI 5.5).
Waiting List
A total of 10,648 patients were added to the liver transplant
waiting list in 2014 (Table LI 1.2), an increase of 144
compared with 2013 (n = 10,504). Conversely, the number
of candidates waiting on December 31, 2014, was 14,632,
404 fewer than the year before (n = 15,036). The trend
was similar for active candidates; the number of new active
candidates increased modestly (by 138), and the number
waiting at the end of the year decreased (by 221). Clearly,
more registrants were removed from the list in 2014 (n
= 11,023) than in 2013 (n = 10,598).
The increase in
the number of candidates removed from the waiting list
is attributable to more transplants being performed (a net
increase of 257) and to more candidates dying or being
removed from the list due to being too sick (a net increase
of 112).
It is concerning that the number of patients dying or being
removed from the list due to being too sick has continued to
increase for the past several years. This trend is replicated in
mortality rates, which increased each year since 2009, from
11.1 per 100 waitlist years in 2009 to 12.3 per 100 waitlist
years in 2014 (Figure LI 1.7). This increase reflects higher
proportions of waitlist registrants at higher medical urgency
status (i.e., model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] > 30),
and lower proportions of candidates at a lower risk of death
(MELD < 15) (Figure LI 1.2).
Following implementation of the Share 35 policy in June
2013, the median waiting time for patients with MELD ě 35
decreased from 18 days in 2012 to 9 days in 2014 (Figure
LI 1.6). Similarly, mortality among candidates listed with
MELD ě 35 decreased from 366 per 100 waitlist years in
2012 to 315 per 100 waitlist years in 2014 (Figure LI 1.7).
Disparity in organ availability remains a problem. Among
candidates listed in 2009, the difference between donation
service areas (DSAs) was nearly 3-fold in the proportions
undergoing liver transplant within 5 years, with the highest
(92.5%) and lowest (31.4%) proportions among DSAs with
10 or more waitlisted patients (Figure LI 1.4).
Donation/Transplant
In 2014, a total of 6729 adult liver transplants were
performed, including 6449 deceased donor transplants and
280 (4.2%) living donor transplants (Figure LI 4.1). These
represent 4% (n = 246) and 11% (n = 28) increases,
respectively, compared with the year before. The increase
in deceased donors may be partly attributable to a reduction
in the rate of organs recovered for transplant but not
transplanted. The proportion of organs recovered but not
transplanted decreased from a peak of 11.4% in 2007 to 9.6%
in 2014 (Figure LI 2.3). This reduction occurred broadly,
including donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors
and HCV-positive donors.
HCV remained the most common single diagnosis in
liver transplant recipients, followed by malignancy, although
many patients with HCC may also have HCV infection
(Figure LI 4.2). Access to liver transplant for candidates
with HCC remains controversial, as it has been shown
that candidates receiving exception MELD points experience
higher transplant rates but have a lower mortality risk than
candidates without HCC. This discrepancy decreased over
time (Figure LI 1.3); however, transplant rates for candidates
with HCC were over twice the rates for candidates without
HCC.
In 2014, 26.1% of liver transplant recipients had MELD
scores of 35 or higher, and another 14.3% had scores of 30 to
34. The majority of patients (56.2%) had MELD scores of
less than 30 (Table LI 4.1). Reflecting the increasing severity
of liver disease in many liver transplant recipients, 35.7%
of transplant recipients had been hospitalized, including
70
OPTN/SRTR Annual Data Report 2014
 .
15.7% in the intensive care unit (ICU). This trend was also
reflected in the proportions of simultaneous liver and kidney
transplants, which accounted for 8.7% of liver transplants, an
increase from 4.9% in 2004.
Geographic disparity in the median MELD score at the
time of transplant continued in 2014, reflecting variability in
organavailability. TheDSAwith the lowest medianMELD at
allocation (18) was in region 3 and the DSA with the highest
median MELD (38) in region 5 (Figure LI 4.4).
Outcomes
Despite a progressive escalation in the severity of liver disease
in transplant recipients, graft survival continued to improve
(Figure LI 5.1). Survival after living donor (Figure LI 5.2)
and DCD transplant (Figure LI 5.3) also remained favorable.
The incidence of acute rejection continued to decline (Figure
LI 5.6); this might be related to increasing use of induction
agents, although many other factors affect the occurrence of
acute rejection.
SRTR data were linked with IMS Health pharmacy claims
data to determine which medications were most commonly
prescribed. Calcineurin inhibitors were nearly universally
used, with tacrolimus used by the majority of recipients.
The proportion of recipients receiving mycophenolate
and steroids after 1 year posttransplant remained high
(Figure LI 4.3). In addition to these immunosuppressive
medications, the most commonly prescribed medications
for liver transplant recipients were antimicrobial agents,
antihypertensives, and narcotic analgesics (Table LI 4.2).
Many liver transplant recipients enjoyed long-term graft
survival. Forpatientswhounderwentlivertransplantin2009,
the 5-year overall graft survival rate was 70.2% (Figure LI
5.3). Survival was poorest for recipients aged 65 years or
older, those with HCV infection or malignancy, those who
received DCD livers, and those who underwent retransplant.
It is widely anticipated that the new antiviral agents for
HCV made available within the last 2 years will improve
graft survival, but this remains to be demonstrated. As of
June 30, 2014, 71,699 liver transplant recipients were alive
with a functioning graft, with many more pediatric recipients
reaching adulthood each year (Figure LI 5.5).
Pediatric Transplant
Waiting List
In 2014, the number of new active candidates added to the
pediatric liver transplant waiting list was 655, down from a
peak of 826 in 2005. Very few candidates were added as
inactive (Figure LI 6.1). The number of prevalent candidates
(on the list on December 31 of the given year) continued to
decline, to 401 active and 173 inactive candidates. The age
distribution of waitlist candidates has remained remarkably
similar over the past decade. In 2014, 20.0% of candidates
were aged younger than 1 year, 32.3% were aged 1 to 5 years,
14.6% were aged 6 to 10 years, and 33.0% were aged 11
to 17 years (Figure LI 6.2). White candidates represented
the largest racial/ethnic group on the waiting list in 2014
(53.5%) followed by Hispanic (22.3%), black (15.6%), and
Asian candidates (5.7%).
Most (63.0%) candidates had
been waiting for less than 1 year, 12.2% for 1 to less than
2 years, 8.2% for 2 to less than 4 years, and 16.6% for 4
or more years.
A shift occurred over the past decade to
fewer patients listed as inactive (14.1% in 2014 vs. 22.4%
in 2003), fewer candidates with MELD/pediatric end-stage
liver disease (PELD) scores below 15 (18.2% in 2014 vs.
39.4% in 2003), and more candidates listed as status 1A/1B
(22.2% in 2014 vs. 9.2% in 2003).
Comparing pediatric waitlist candidates from 2004 to
2014 shows little change in age, sex, or race. Acute liver
failure was the primary diagnosis in 6.4% of candidates in
2004 and in 3.8% in 2014. The proportion of candidates
awaiting retransplant decreased from 14.6% in 2004 to
9.1% in 2014.
Waiting time shifted such that 43.9% of
candidates waited for less than 1 year in 2014 compared
with 29.3% in 2004.
Candidates listed for multi-organ
transplants including liver increased over time. Liver-kidney
transplant candidates accounted for only 1.4% of pediatric
liver transplant candidates in 2004 and increased to 3.1% in
2014. Liver-intestine transplant candidates increased from
1.1% in 2004 to 10.1% in 2014 (Table LI 6.1).
Among
candidates removed from the waiting list in 2014, 71.8%
received a deceased donor liver, 7.7% received a living donor
liver, 4.9% died, 10.1% were removed from the list because
their condition improved, and 2.5% were considered too
sick to undergo transplant (Table LI 6.2). Approximately

69% of candidates newly listed in 2011 underwent deceased
donortransplantwithin3years, 7.7%underwentlivingdonor
transplant, 3.9% died, 13.7% were removed from the list,
and 5.6% were still waiting (Figure LI 6.3). In 2014, the
rate of deceased donor transplant among active pediatric
candidates decreased to 125.6 per 100 active waitlist years
(Figure LI 6.4).
Rates were highest for candidates aged
younger than 1 year (263.3 per 100 active waitlist years) and
lowest for candidates aged 11 years or older (98.4 per 100
active waitlist years). Transplant rates for candidates aged
1 to 5 years decreased from a peak of 223.6 per 100 active
waitlist years in 2009 to 118.7 in 2014. Regarding medical
urgency status, transplant rates were highest (228.7 per 100
active waitlist years) for candidates with MELD/PELD 35
or higher, compared with 23.2 for those with MELD/PELD
less than 15. The transplant rate decreased for status 1A/1B
candidates to 860.7 per 100 active waitlist years from 1255.4
in 2013. Pretransplant mortality decreased for all age groups,
to 5.9 deaths per 100 waitlist years in 2013-2014 (Figure
LI 6.5). The pretransplant mortality rate was highest for
candidates aged younger than 1 year, at 12.4 deaths per 100
waitlistyears in2013-2014, butthis hassteadily declinedover
the past decade from a peak of 40.95 in 2005-2006 (Figure LI
6.5).
Transplant
The number of deceased donor pediatric liver transplants
peaked at 542 in 2008 and was 478 in 2014 (Figure LI 6.6).
The number of pediatric living donor liver transplants was
51 in 2014; most were from donors closely related to the
recipients. Therecipientswiththelargestpercentageofliving
donors were aged younger than 6 years (Figure LI 6.7). Over
the past decade of pediatric liver transplant, recipient age, sex,
and racial distributions have changed little (Table LI 6.3).
Cholestatic disease remained the leading cause of liver failure
(44.9%). In 2012-2014, 8.8% of liver transplant recipients
had undergone previous transplant, a decrease from 13.3% a
decade earlier. Insurance coverage appears to be changing;
the percentage of recipients with private insurance decreased
from 52.3% to 41.7%, and Medicaid coverage increased from
36.7% to 45.6%. In 2012-2014, 36.1% of recipients waited
less than 31 days for transplant, and 14.7% waited 31 to
60 days, similar to 2002-2004. Most (60%) pediatric liver
transplant recipients were not hospitalized before transplant
and fewer were in the ICU, 29.4% in 2002-2004 vs. 21.9%
in 2012-2014.
Regarding medical urgency status, 35.5%
of recipients underwent transplant as status 1A/1B and
17.6% had MELD/PELD scores of 35 or higher. The most
common MELD/PELD score at the time of transplant was
15 to 29 (24.2%).
Types of liver transplant procedures
in pediatric recipients changed little over the past decade;
64.4% of patients received a whole liver in 2012-2014, 19.8%
received a partial liver, and 15.9% received a split liver.
The proportion of living donors declined from 11.4% in
2002-2004 to 9.1% in 2012-2014. Just over half of recipients
had previous abdominal surgery. ABO-incompatible liver
transplant occurred in 3.0% of recipients in 2012-2014, up
from 1.8% in the earlier era.
Immunosuppression and Outcomes
In 2014,
18.3% of pediatric liver recipients received
interleukin-2 receptor antagonists for induction therapy,
13.5% received a T-cell depleting agent, and 68.7% received
no induction (Figure LI 6.8). The most commonly used
initial
immunosuppression
agents
included
tacrolimus
(94.8%), steroids (82.1%), and mycophenolate mofetil
(39.7%). Use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
at the time of transplant was minimal (1.4%), but increased
to 8.2% at 1 year posttransplant. At 1 year posttransplant,
55.3% of recipients were still receiving steroids.
Graft
survival continued to improve over the past decade among
recipients of deceased donor and living donor livers. Graft
failure occurred in 11.8% at 6 months and 12.6% at 1 year
among deceased donor liver transplants performed in 2013,
16.2% at 3 years for transplants performed in 2011, 20.6%
at 5 years for transplants performed in 2009, and 31.5%
at 10 years for transplants performed in 2004 (Figure LI
6.9). Graft failure occurred in 7.1% at 6 months and 7.1%
at 1 year posttransplant among living donor transplants
performed in 2013, 14.6% at 3 year for transplants performed
in 2009-2010, 14.3% at 5 years for transplants performed in
2007-2008, and 20.8% at 10 years for transplants performed
2003-2004 (Figure LI 6.10). By age, 5-year graft survival
was 73.9% for recipients aged younger than 1 year, 76.9%
for ages 1 to 5 years, 83.5% ages 6 to 10 years, and 76.7%
for ages 11 to 17 years (Figure LI 6.11). Recipients who
72
OPTN/SRTR Annual Data Report 2014
 .
underwent transplant with a MELD/PELD less than 20
had 5-year graft survival of 83.2% compared with 74.7%
for recipients who underwent transplant as status 1A/1B or
with a MELD/PELD greater than 20. Five-year graft survival
was 78.2% for recipients of a first liver transplant, compared
with 66.1% for retransplant recipients.
The incidence of
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was 4.4% at 5
years posttransplant for recipients who were negative for
Epstein-Barr virus and 3.2% for those who were positive
(Figure LI 6.12).
The incidence of acute rejection was
remarkably similar for all age groups and lowest for recipients
agedyoungerthan1year(FigureLI6.13). Ofdeceaseddonor
transplant recipients in 2008-2012, 12.0% died within 5 years
of transplant and the leading cause of death was infection at
1 year and 5 years posttransplant (Figure LI 6.14).

Candidates concurrently listed at more than one center are
counted once, from the time of earliest listing to the time of
latest removal. Candidates who are listed, undergo transplant,
and are relisted are counted more than once. Candidates are
not considered to be on the list on the day they are removed;
counts on January 1 may differ from counts on December 31
of the prior year. Candidates listed for multi-organ transplants
are included.

Mortality rates are computed as the number of deaths per 100 patient-years of waiting in the given year.
Individual listings are counted separately. Rates with less than 10 patient-years of exposure are not shown.
Age is determined at the later of listing date or January 1 of the given year. Rates by medical urgency status
are computed in a time-dependent manner.
