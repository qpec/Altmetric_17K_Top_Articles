Introduction: Although there is widespread acceptance of a relationship between stress and 
acne, not many studies have been performed to assess this relationship. The objective of this 
study was to determine the relationship between stress and acne severity.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 144 6th year female medical students 
22 to 24 years in age attending the medical faculty at King Abdulaziz University. This study 
used the global acne grading system (GAGS) to assess acne severity in relation to stress using 
the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The questionnaire also included some confounding factors 
involved in acne severity.
Results: The results indicated an increase in stress severity strongly correlated with an increase 
in acne severity, which was statistically significant (p<0.01). Subjects with higher stress scores, 
determined using the PSS, had higher acne severity when examined and graded using the GAGS.
Conclusion: On the basis of this study, it is concluded that stress positively correlates with 
acne severity.
Keywords: acne, acne vulgaris, acne severity, acne grade, stress, stress scale 
Introduction
Acne vulgaris is a common cutaneous inflammatory disorder affecting more than 85% 
of adolescents worldwide.1,2 Its pathogenesis is multifactorial. One of these factors is 
stress, which influences several dermatological disorders.3,4 Seventy four percent of 
178 patients and relatives in a questionnaire survey reported that they believed that 
anxiety is an exacerbating factor of acne.5 An interventional study found that patients 
had an improvement in their acne compared to controls when receiving biofeedback 
training, relaxation training, and stress reduction techniques.6
Although there is widespread acceptance of a relationship between stress and acne 
flares, not many studies have been conducted to assess this relationship. This study uses 
the global acne grading system (GAGS) to assess acne severity in relation to stress by 
using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). 
Methods
A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was distributed among 144 6th year female 
medical students (aged 22–24 years) at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. The Eth-
ics Committee at King Abulaziz University Hospital and the Research Committee at 
the University of Jeddah Faculty of Medicine approved the study. PSS was used to 
measure the degree to which the respondents’ external situation is perceived as being

stressful with higher scores indicating higher levels of per-
ceived stress. This 14-item self-questionnaire is reliable and 
has been widely used in stress research.7,8 The questionnaire 
also included some confounding factors in acne severity, such 
as, menstruation, heat and humidity, sweating, use of makeup 
and cosmetic products, oily hair products, use of topical 
steroids, and squeezing pimples. Also, the similar age and 
sex of the study group eliminates confounding by age or sex.
After providing verbal consent, the 6th year female medi-
cal students received the PSS to complete during teaching 
sessions conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. 
The two ethics committees approved the verbal consents. 
There were no exclusion criteria. All participants completed 
the questionnaire. Upon completion of the questionnaire, an 
intern who was trained earlier by the consultant dermatologist 
examined the students for the presence of acne lesions. The 
trained intern then graded the acne severity and was blinded 
to the study outcome.
Clinical classification of acne severity was done using 
the GAGS. The type of acne lesions present (comedones, 
papules, pustules, and nodules) and their location were noted. 
The severity of acne was then calculated.9
statistical methods
Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sci-
ences (SPSS), Version 13 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Regression analysis of stress severity and acne severity was 
carried out by the method of least squares. The analysis of 
covariance was also used to test whether certain factors have 
an effect on the relationship between stress as a dependent 
variable and acne as a covariate among female medical stu-
dents. In addition, chi-squared test and correlation analysis 
were performed. p values of <0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant. 
Results
Using the GAGS, it was found that 3 students (2.1%) had 
no acne, 104 students (72.2%) had mild acne, 33 students 
(22.9%) had moderate acne, and 4 students (2.8%) had 
severe acne.
An increase in stress severity was strongly correlated with 
an increase in acne severity, which was statistically significant 
(r=0.23; p<0.01). Subjects with higher stress scores, deter-
mined using the PSS, had higher acne severity when exam-
ined, and acne severity was graded using the GAGS. Figure

association between stress and acne
1 shows that stress severity increased with increasing acne 
grade. Of the eight acne aggravators included in the question-
naire, excessive heat and humidity was the only statistically 
significant aggravating factor (p<0.05%) as shown in Table 1.
Discussion
Acne has a high worldwide prevalence rate of 85%.1,2 
Although there is widespread acceptance of the relationship 
between stress and acne flares, not many studies have been 
conducted to assess this relationship. There is already wide 
perception that stress aggravates acne. In a study performed in 
Australia among final year medical students at the University 
of Melbourne, 67% of students identified stress as an exac-
erbating factor.10 Also, a multicenter epidemiological study 
from patients who visited 17 Korean hospitals was conducted. 
It found that the main triggering factor was psychological 
stress and was reported by 82% of patients.11
In our study, students with higher stress scores of perceived 
stress determined by using PSS had a higher acne grade, 
which was found using GAGS. This positive correlation was 
statistically significant (p<0.01). Our results go along with 
two studies done previously which explored this correlation. 
First, a university study of 22 patients showed that increased 
acne severity was significantly associated with increased stress 
levels (r=0.61, p<0.01).12 In the second study in which 94 
students in Singapore were enrolled in a prospective cohort 
study, there was a statistically significant correlation between 
stress levels and severity of acne (r=0.23, p=0.029).13
Many factors have been implicated as aggravators of 
acne including blood hormone changes and premenstrua-
tion,14 excessive heat and humidity,11,15–17 sweating,1,16,17 use 
of makeup and cosmetic products,11,18,19 and the use of oily 
hair products.1,20 Also, the use of topical corticosteroids21–23 
and squeezing pimples24 have been known to increase acne 
lesions. Excessive heat and humidity was the only significant 
aggravating factor in our study. It is postulated that heat and 
humidity make it more favorable for Propionibacterium 
acnes to colonize the ductal hyperplasia.17
There are a number of proposed mechanisms of why stress 
aggravates acne. In adult women with acne, chronic stress 
increases the secretion of adrenal androgens and results in 
sebaceous hyperplasia.25 Activation of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is the main adaptive response to 
systemic stress. In response to emotional stress, the HPA axis 
activates increased levels of cortisol release. Corticotropin-
releasing hormone (CRH) is the most proximal element of 
the HPA axis. CRH acts as a central coordinator for neuroen-
docrine and behavioral responses to stress.26 CRH stimulates 
sebaceous gland lipid production and steroidogenesis, which 
contributes to acne.27,28 Studies have also shown an increase of 
CRH expression in the sebaceous glands of acne-involved skin, 
compared to a low expression in normal skin.26,29 This upregu-
lation of CRH expression in acne-involved skin may influence 
the inflammatory processes that lead to stress-induced acne 
lesions. CRH also induces cytokines IL-6 and IL-11 produc-
tion in keratinocytes, contributing to inflammation, which is 
regarded as a key component in the pathogenesis of acne.30
Peripheral nerves release the neuropeptide substance P 
or vasointestinal peptide in response to stress. Substance P 
stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of sebaceous 
glands and upregulates lipid synthesis in sebaceous cells.31,32 
Also, psychological stress could delay wound healing up to 
40%, which could affect the repair of acne lesions.33,34
Conclusion
Stress triggers or worsens acne by multiple mechanisms. Not 
many studies have assessed the relationship between stress 
and acne flares. On the basis of this study, it is concluded that 
stress positively correlates with acne severity. Therapeutic 
approaches can be adjusted according to stress levels and 
behavioral intervention could be an option in some cases.
