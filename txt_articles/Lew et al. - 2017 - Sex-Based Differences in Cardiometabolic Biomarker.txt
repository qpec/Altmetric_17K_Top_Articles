ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Few data are available comparing cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) biomarker profiles between women and men in the general 
population. We analyzed sex-based differences in multiple biomarkers 
reflecting distinct pathophysiological pathways, accounting for differences 
between women and men in CVD risk factors, body composition, and 
cardiac morphology.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data 
from the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic population-based study. 
Associations between sex and 30 distinct biomarkers representative 
of 6 pathophysiological categories were evaluated using multivariable 
linear regression adjusting for age, race, traditional CVD risk 
factors, kidney function, insulin resistance, MRI and dual-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry measures of body composition and fat distribution, and 
left ventricular mass.
RESULTS: After excluding participants with CVD, the study population 
included 3439 individuals, mean age 43 years, 56% women, and 52% 
black. Significant sex-based differences were seen in multiple categories of 
biomarkers, including lipids, adipokines, and biomarkers of inflammation, 
endothelial dysfunction, myocyte injury and stress, and kidney function. In 
fully adjusted models, women had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein particle concentration, leptin, 
d-dimer, homoarginine, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and 
lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, lipoprotein-
associated phospholipase A2 mass and activity, monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1, soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecule, symmetrical 
dimethylarginine, asymmetrical dimethylarginine, high-sensitivity troponin T, 
and cystatin C. 
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker profiles differ significantly between women 
and men in the general population. Sex differences were most apparent 
for biomarkers of adiposity, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory cell 
recruitment, and cardiac stress and injury. Future studies are needed to 
characterize whether pathophysiological processes delineated by these 
biomarkers contribute to sex-based differences in the development and 
complications of CVD.

A
lthough cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the domi-
nant cause of mortality in both women and men, 
manifestations of CVD differ between sexes.1 
Women have a lower incidence and later presentation of 
acute coronary syndromes, with fewer lipid-rich athero-
mata and a lower incidence of plaque rupture.2 Women 
with heart failure present at an older age and are more 
likely to have a nonischemic etiology and preserved left 
ventricular function.3 It is interesting to note that despite 
their relative protection from coronary artery disease 
and adverse cardiac remodeling, women are equally 
vulnerable to peripheral artery disease compared with 
men.4 Although there is a lower incidence of atrial fibrilla-
tion among women than among men, women with atrial 
fibrillation have higher mortality and stroke risk than age-
matched men.5,6
Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these 
sex-based differences in CVD remain incompletely un-
derstood. Women and men seem to respond differently 
to cardiovascular stressors; conditions such as diabetes 
mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking may play a larger 
role in the pathogenesis of CVD in women.2,7–10 Women 
are more prone to microvascular dysfunction, whereas 
men are more prone to macrovascular disease.11 The 
premenopausal state is protective in women, suggest-
ing that sex hormones, and the relative balance between 
estrogens and androgens, play at least some role in 
modulating sex-based differences in CVD.1 Circulat-
ing biomarkers may provide additional insight into the 
mechanisms underlying sex-based differences in CVD. 
Sex differences are known to exist in multiple circulat-
ing biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk.12–14 
For example, in comparison with men presenting with 
acute coronary syndrome, women with acute coronary 
syndrome have lower troponin levels and higher levels 
of natriuretic peptides and high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein.12,13 In studies from general population cohorts, 
women tend to have higher levels of adipokines and in-
flammatory biomarkers than men.14,15
Few previous studies investigating sex-based differ-
ences in CVD biomarkers have been performed in gen-
eral population cohorts free from CVD, and the scope 
of these studies has been limited to small numbers of 
biomarkers. Also, prior studies have not adequately ac-
counted for important differences in body composition 
and cardiac morphology that may confound comparisons 
of biomarkers between sexes. Therefore, we compared 
levels of a large panel of biomarkers representative of 
different pathophysiological pathways contributing to 
CVD between women and men, incorporating extensive 
phenotyping to account for sex-based differences in 
body composition and cardiac morphology.
METHODS
Study Population
The DHS (Dallas Heart Study) is a multiethnic probability-based 
population cohort study of Dallas County adults, with inten-
tional oversampling of self-identified blacks.16 Phase 1 of the 
DHS was conducted between 2000 and 2002 and included 3 
separate visits: visit 1, an initial home visit (n=6101) for col-
lection of demographic data, medical history, blood pressure, 
and anthropometric data; visit 2 (a subset of visit 1), a second 
home visit (n=3557) for collection of fasting blood and urine 
samples; and visit 3 (a subset of visit 2), a final visit to the 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (n=2971) 
for completion of detailed imaging studies. The current study 
represents a cross-sectional analysis of individuals from DHS 
who participated in visit 2 (the blood and urine collection visit). 
Participants with CVD at baseline, defined as a self-reported 
history of myocardial infarction, revascularization, heart failure, 
or stroke, were excluded (n=118), resulting in a final study 
population of 3439 individuals. Data from DHS phase 2, con-
ducted from 2007 to 2009, are not included in this study. The 
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and all 
participants provided written informed consent.
Variable Definitions
Demographic data including age, sex, and race were obtained 
by participant self-report. Hypercholesterolemia was defined 
as fasting calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is one of the largest and most comprehensive 
comparisons of biomarker profiles between men 
and women from the population, and it provides 
insight into potential mechanisms contributing to 
sex differences in the pathogenesis of cardiovascu-
lar disease.
• Women had higher circulating levels of adipokines 
and d-dimer, and lower levels of biomarkers reflect-
ing endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory cell 
recruitment. Body composition and menopausal sta-
tus had important influences on the observed sex-
based differences in multiple biomarkers.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Sex is an important determinant of the circulating 
levels of multiple different biomarkers, including 
several biomarkers currently in wide clinical use, 
suggesting that sex-based cut points should be con-
sidered for several biomarkers.
• Differences in biomarker profiles between men and 
women highlight potentially important sex-based dif-
ferences in the pathophysiological mechanisms con-
tributing to cardiovascular disease.
• Future studies should explore targeted approaches 
to cardiovascular disease prevention that account 
for sex-based differences in disease pathogenesis.

≥160 mg/dL, nonfasting direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
≥160 mg/dL, total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, or use of statin 
medication.17 Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glu-
cose ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting glucose >200, or self-reported 
diabetes mellitus with concomitant use of antihyperglycemic 
medication.18 Blood pressure was measured a total of 5 times 
during each visit, with the average of the last 3 readings rep-
resenting the blood pressure for that visit.19 Hypertension was 
defined as average systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm 
Hg, 
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm 
Hg, or use of antihyper-
tensive medications.18,19 Homeostasis Model Assessment 
of Insulin Resistance Index was calculated as fasting insulin 
(mU/L)×fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.20 The estimated glo-
merular filtration rate was calculated using the abbreviated 
Modification of Diet and Renal Disease calculation, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (mL·min–1·1.73 m–2)=186×(Scr in mg/
dL)×1.154×(age in years)–0.203×0.742 (if female)×1.21 (if 
black), where Scr is serum creatinine concentration.
Measures of Body Composition
Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg)/height (meters).18 
 
Based on the Tikuisis equation, body surface area (cm2) was 
calculated as 128.1×weight (kg)0.44×height (cm)0.60 for men and 
147.4×weight (kg)0.47×height (cm)0.55 for women.21 Dual-energy 
x-ray aborptiometry in array mode and Oasis software (Delphi 
W scanner, Hologic Inc) was used to quantify total fat mass and 
lean mass (fat-free mass) in kilograms, with separate calcula-
tions for 3 body compartments (head, trunk, and upper and 
lower extremities) as described previously.19,22 Lower body fat 
consisted of the total fat mass below 2 oblique lines set cross-
ing the femoral necks, intersecting below the pubic symphysis 
and included gluteal-femoral fat.22 Visceral and subcutane-
ous fat mass (kg) were quantified by 1.5T MRI (Intera, Philips 
Medical Systems), using a single axial slice through the L2-L3 
intervertebral level, based on an accurate method of fat mass 
prediction described previously.23
Cardiac Imaging
Left ventricular (LV) measurements were performed using 1.5T 
cardiac MRI (Phillips Medical Systems) in short axis, breath 
hold, electrocardiographic-gated cine, as described previ-
ously.24 The summation of manually traced endocardial and 
epicardial borders of slices extending from the apex to the LV 
base was used to calculate LV cavity volume, wall thickness, 
and mass.19,24
Measurement of Circulating Biomarkers
Venous blood was collected in standard blood collection tubes 
containing citrate EDTA and samples were maintained at 4°C 
for 4 hours, centrifuged (1430g for 15 minutes) at 4°C, and 
plasma removed from these samples was frozen at –70°C until 
assays were performed. Only fasting blood samples were used 
for the present study.
Thirty circulating biomarkers, representative of 6 different 
pathophysiological categories (lipids, adipokines, and markers 
of inflammation, endothelial injury, myocyte injury and stress, 
and kidney function) were included in the analyses. These 
biomarkers were selected a priori on the basis of biological 
plausibility, clinical relevance, and the availability of accurate 
assay methods. Details of assay methods and characteristics 
are included in online-only Data Supplement Table I.
Menopausal Status
Menopausal status was defined using age, self-reported and 
measured variables including history of menopause, history of 
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, 
last menstrual period, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels 
(in a subset of 696 women).25 On the basis of these defini-
tions, there were 662 premenopausal women, 928 postmeno-
pausal women, and 327 considered as unclear and therefore 
excluded from the analyses associating menopausal status 
with biomarkers (online-only Data Supplement Figure I).
Statistical Analysis
All biomarkers are reported as continuous variables as medi-
ans (interquartile range), with the exception of high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin-T (hs-cTnT), which is reported as a categori-
cal variable as the proportion ≥ the limit of blank of the assay 
(≥3 ng/L).26 Linear regression analyses were performed to 
assess associations of sex with log-transformed biomarker 
concentrations. A series of sequential multivariable linear 
regression models were applied, as follows: model 1 (n=3431) 
adjusting for age and race; model 2 (n=2846) adjusting for 
age, race, traditional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hyper-
tension, current smoking, statin use), Homeostasis Model 
Assessment of Insulin Resistance Index, and estimated glo-
merular filtration rate; model 3 (n=2500) adjusting for model 
2 variables plus additional adjustment for body composition 
(lean mass, fat mass, body surface area, visceral fat, subcu-
taneous abdominal fat, lower body fat); model 4 (n=2499) 
adjusting for model 3 variables plus additional adjustment for 
LV mass. Each biomarker was entered individually in each 
model. β-Coefficients for sex are reported for each biomarker 
in each model, with positive values signifying higher relative 
levels in women and negative values representing lower rela-
tive levels in women. The magnitude of the association of the 
biomarker with sex can be inferred from the absolute value 
of the β-coefficient.
We performed 2 exploratory analyses to investigate (1) 
the association of menopausal status with biomarker levels in 
women, and (2) the influence of menopausal status on the com-
parisons of biomarker levels between women and men. First, 
we performed an analysis limited to women only, comparing 
biomarker levels between pre- and postmenopausal women, 
using linear regression with serial adjustments performed 
according to the same 4 models as above. In these models, 
positive β-coefficients signify higher biomarker levels associ-
ated with postmenopausal status, and the magnitude of asso-
ciation with menopausal status is reflected by the absolute 
value of the β-coefficient. In the second analysis, we separated 
women into premenopausal and postmenopausal groups, and 
within each group matched each woman to a man of the same 
age. We then compared biomarker levels in premenopausal 
women versus age-matched men and separately compared 
postmenopausal women versus older age-matched men, 
excluding women with unclear menopausal status and post-
menopausal women <40 years of age. We report only the fully 
adjusted β-coefficients (model 4), with positive β-coefficients

representing higher biomarker levels in women than in men 
within the specific subgroup.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc). For all statistical tests, 2-sided P values 
were adjusted for multiple testing using the False Discovery 
Rate method, and P values <0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the study population are 
shown in Table 1. Sex-based differences in the 30 bio-
markers are shown in Table 2, with the results grouped 
according to 6 distinct biomarker categories: lipids, adi-
pokines, inflammatory biomarkers, endothelial markers, 
biomarkers of myocyte injury and stress, and biomark-
ers of kidney dysfunction.
Lipids
In unadjusted models, women had significantly higher 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) particle concentration (HDL-p), and 
lipoprotein(a), and lower levels of LDL particle concentra-
tion (LDL-p) and triglycerides (P<0.0001 for each). No 
significant difference was seen for total cholesterol, cho-
lesterol efflux capacity, or LDL-C in unadjusted models. 
The differences in lipoprotein(a), LDL-p, and triglycerides 
were no longer significant after adjustment for body 
composition (model 3). After full adjustment, women had 
higher levels of HDL-C and HDL-p and lower levels of 
LDL-C (P≤0.02 for each).
Adipokines
Leptin and adiponectin were both significantly higher in 
women than in men in unadjusted analyses (P<0.0001 
for each). Leptin remained significantly higher in women 
after full multivariable adjustment (P<0.0001). However, 
the relationship between adiponectin and sex was re-
versed after adjusting for body composition (model 3), 
with lower levels in women after adjustment (P=0.04).
Inflammatory Biomarkers
Women had higher unadjusted levels of d-dimer, high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein, and osteoprotegerin than 
men (all P<0.0001) and lower levels of interleukin-18 
and lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (LP-PLA2) mass and 
activity (all P<0.0001). There were no significant sex 
differences seen for soluble receptor for advanced 
glycation end products, soluble tumor necrosis factor 
receptor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in 
unadjusted models. The sex differences seen for high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteoprotegerin, and inter-
leukin-18  were completely attenuated after accounting 
for body composition (model 3). After full adjustment,

d-dimer remained higher in women and LP-PLA2 mass 
and activity remained lower in women (P<0.0001 for 
each). Although monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 did 
not demonstrate a sex difference in unadjusted analy-
ses, levels were lower in women after adjustment for 
body composition (P=0.03).
Endothelial Biomarkers
In unadjusted models, soluble endothelial cell-selective 
adhesion molecule (sESAM), symmetrical dimethylar-
ginine (SDMA), and homoarginine levels were lower in 
women (P=0.02, P<0.0001, and P<0.0001, respective-
ly), with no significant difference seen for asymmetrical 
dimethylarginine (ADMA), soluble intercellular adhesion 
molecule, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule. In 
fully adjusted models, sESAM and SDMA remained lower 
in women (P<0.0001 for both). Lower adjusted levels 
of ADMA in women became evident only after account-
ing for body composition (P=0.0002), a difference that 
persisted after full multivariable adjustment (P=0.0006). 
Homoarginine demonstrated a reversal of association 
after accounting for body composition, such that levels 
were significantly higher in women after adjustment for 
body composition and after full adjustment (P<0.001 
for both). Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule and 
soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule demonstrated 
no relationship with sex in fully adjusted models.

Biomarkers of Myocyte Injury and Stress
In unadjusted analysis, women had higher levels of N-
terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; 
P<0.0001), lower levels of soluble suppression of tu-
morigenicity 2 (sST2; P<0.01), and a lower probability 
of hs-cTnT ≥3 ng/L (P<0.0001). After full multivariable 
adjustment, women had significantly higher NT-proBNP 
(P<0.0001) and a lower probability of hs-cTnT ≥3 ng/mL 
(P<0.0001). The sex difference initially seen for sST2 
was completely attenuated after accounting for body 
composition (model 3). There was no sex difference in 
growth differentiation factor-15.
Kidney Biomarkers
Women had lower cystatin C in both unadjusted 
(P<0.0001) and fully adjusted (P<0.0001) models.
Analyses Accounting for Menopausal Status
A subset of biomarkers exhibited independent asso-
ciations with menopausal status after full multivariable 
adjustment (Table 3). Multiple lipid biomarkers, includ-
ing HDL-C, HDL-p, LDL-C, LDL-p, triglycerides, and 
total cholesterol were higher among postmenopausal 
than among premenopausal women (P<0.05 for each). 
ADMA was also positively associated with postmeno-
pausal status in the fully adjusted model (P<0.05). The 
biomarkers that were lower in postmenopausal women 
included d-dimer, soluble vascular cell adhesion mole-
cule, and NT-proBNP (P<0.05 for each). In a sensitivity 
analysis in which postmenopausal women <40 years 
of age (n=19) were included with the postmenopausal 
group, results were similar for all markers, with the 
exception of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule, 
which was no longer significantly different between the 
2 groups after including the postmenopausal women 
<40 years of age.
In our analyses comparing premenopausal women 
with age-matched men and postmenopausal women 
with age-matched men, we observed that several of the 
sex differences in biomarkers in the overall cohort were 
specific to either the premenopausal or postmenopausal 
timeframes (online-only Data Supplement Table II). Mark-
ers with sex associations specific to premenopausal 
women included LDL-C, monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein-1, and ADMA, which were each lower in premeno-
pausal women than in age-matched men, and d-dimer 
and NT-proBNP, which were higher in premenopausal 
women (P≤0.01 for each). Sex differences in several 
other markers were specific to the postmenopausal 
group. HDL-C, HDL-p, and homoarginine displayed high-
er levels in postmenopausal women than in age-matched 
men (P<0.01 for each), with no differences seen in the 
comparisons of premenopausal women with younger 
men. sST2 and growth differentiation factor-15 were 
lower only in postmenopausal women in comparison with 
age-matched men (P<0.05 for each), with no differences 
seen in either the premenopausal group or the overall 
comparisons. Other markers displayed consistent as-
sociations with sex in both menopausal status groups, 
including leptin, LP-PLA2 mass and activity, sESAM, 
SDMA, hs-cTnT, and cystatin C (online-only Data Supple-
ment Table II).
DISCUSSION
In a probability-based general population cohort free from 
known CVD, we observed multiple sex-specific differenc-
es in circulating cardiac biomarkers that reflect biologi-
cal pathways known to be important in CVD. Moreover, 
we observed important effects of menopausal status, 
both on biomarker levels in women and in the compari-
sons between women and men. In broad terms, women 
had higher levels of certain markers associated with 
adiposity and lower levels of markers associated with 
endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory cell recruitment, 
and vascular inflammation. Sex-based differences in car-
diovascular biomarkers have undergone limited study to

date, and to our knowledge this study represents the 
first large-scale comparison of circulating biomarkers 
associated with cardiometabolic risk between women 
and men without known CVD in a well-characterized, 
population-based cohort.
Biomarkers Independently Associated With Sex
Certain biomarkers revealed strong associations with 
sex independent of confounding factors, highlighting 
potential intrinsic differences in circulating biomarkers 
between women and men. Among the lipid biomark-
ers, the strongest associations with sex were seen with 
HDL-C and HDL-p, which were both higher in women. It 
is interesting to note that cholesterol efflux capacity, a 
functional property of HDL and marker of reverse cho-
lesterol transport,27 did not share this association with 
female sex. Significant differences in adipokine levels 
were seen between women and men, but only leptin re-
mained independently associated with female sex after 
accounting for differences in fat mass and distribution. 
Increased levels of leptin, which may indicate leptin re-
sistance, have been associated with multiple adverse 
cardiac and metabolic parameters.28,29 Leptin levels are 
higher in women than in men across all body mass in-
dex levels.30 Although larger subcutaneous fat mass was 
thought to underpin these differences,30,31 in our study, 
leptin remained higher in women even after accounting 
for differences in fat mass and distribution.
We observed no consistent pattern of association 
with sex within the category of inflammatory biomark-
ers. Rather, divergent associations with sex were seen 
for individual inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting sex-
based differences in specific rather than global inflam-
matory pathways. Among the inflammatory markers, 
d-dimer was the only one positively associated with 
female sex under all modeling conditions. d-Dimer is a 
product of fibrin degradation and a marker of system-
ic inflammation and thrombotic activity, and has been 
reported to be robustly associated with future venous 
thromboembolism in the general population.32 In con-
trast, women had lower levels of LP-PLA2 mass and ac-
tivity. LP-PLA2 is an enzyme secreted by inflammatory 
cells that circulates bound to LDL-C and other lipopro-
teins and may contribute to vascular inflammation and 
plaque instability through the generation of inflamma-
tory lipid products.33 LP-PLA2 has been shown to be 
lower in women than in men33 and higher LP-PLA2 mass 
and activity have been associated with increased risk 
of primary cardiovascular events34 and coronary heart 
disease with no significant interaction between LP-PLA2 
activity and sex with regard to coronary heart disease.34 
Therapies targeting the LP-PLA2 pathway have been the 
focus of extensive recent investigation.35
Women had lower levels of certain markers of en-
dothelial dysfunction, including sESAM and SDMA, and 
higher levels of homoarginine, a marker associated with 
a protective endothelial phenotype.36 Endothelial cell se-
lective adhesion molecule is a unique cell adhesion mole-
cule with expression limited to vascular endothelium and 
activated platelets.18 Although studies on sex difference 
in sESAM are currently lacking, sESAM has been associ-
ated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis such 
as coronary artery calcium and aortic wall thickness, as 
well as vascular stiffness.18 It is thought to participate 
in atherosclerosis by its role in leukocyte recruitment 
into areas of damaged endothelium.18 SDMA and ADMA 
are endogenous methylated byproducts of protein turn-
over shown to interfere with nitric oxide synthesis. In 
this study, SDMA and ADMA were lower in women af-
ter full adjustment. Homoarginine, in contrast, is a nitric 
oxide precursor, which increases nitric oxide availability 
and enhances endothelial function.36 Prior studies have 
demonstrated lower baseline levels of homoarginine in 
women than in men37 and inverse associations between 
homoarginine and markers of atherosclerosis, major ad-
verse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality.36,38
Our findings confirm multiple previous studies show-
ing that women have higher levels of natriuretic pep-
tides and lower levels of cardiac troponins.25,39 Natri-
uretic peptides, which are released under conditions of 
cardiomyocyte stretch, serve a counterregulatory func-
tion by promoting natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, 
and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and 
sympathetic nervous systems. They may also promote 
fat distribution away from visceral to more favorable 
subcutaneous depots.40 It is important to note that we 
found that NT-proBNP levels remained higher in women 
even after accounting for differences between sexes in 
body composition and LV mass. Cardiac troponins are 
specific markers of cardiac injury that are associated 
with LV hypertrophy and increased death and heart 
failure events in population-based cohorts.41 Consis-
tent with prior studies, we found strong associations 
between female sex and lower hs-cTnT levels. It is inter-
esting to note that the lower levels of hs-cTnT were not 
explained by smaller heart size in women, because ad-
justment for LV mass did not attenuate the differences 
in hs-cTnT.
Cystatin C is secreted from all nucleated cells, cir-
culates in bodily fluids, is freely filtered across the glo-
merular membrane, and serves as a marker of kidney 
function independent of age, sex, and muscle mass.42 
Higher levels of cystatin C have been associated with 
increased cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and 
increased LV mass, concentricity, and wall thickness.42 
We found that cystatin C was significantly lower in 
women independent of cardiovascular risk factors, 
kidney function, body composition, and LV mass. How-
ever, the exact role that cystatin C plays in the devel-
opment of CVD remains unclear and warrants further 
investigation.

Effect of Body Composition and Fat Distribution 
on Sex-Based Differences in Biomarkers
Accounting for age, race, traditional risk factors, and 
LV mass, in general, did not have a major impact on 
the association of sex with biomarker levels. Among the 
covariables considered in our modeling strategy, mea-
sures of body composition and fat distribution had the 
largest impact on the β-coefficients for sex. Multiple 
biomarkers demonstrated attenuation or even complete 
reversal of sex associations after adjusting for these 
measures, suggesting that body composition may be 
a critical factor influencing different pathophysiologi-
cal manifestations of CVD in women and men. Cardio-
metabolic consequences of adiposity differ depending 
on distribution within various body compartments.22,31 
Although visceral abdominal fat has been associated 
with different biomarkers of insulin resistance, dyslipid-
emia, and subclinical atherosclerosis, subcutaneous fat 
has demonstrated no association with atherosclerosis 
and inconsistent associations with dysmetabolic pheno-
types.22,43 Women have less visceral fat and more lower 
body fat than men, and also appear to have an exag-
gerated inflammatory response to increased adiposity 
in comparison with men.15 An important strength of our 
study is the ability to account for these differences in 
body composition, fat distribution, and adipokine levels 
between women and men.
Several markers were associated with significantly 
higher or lower levels in women at baseline, but this 
relationship was attenuated with adjustment for body 
composition. The lipid marker lipoprotein(a) and inflam-
matory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 
osteoprotegerin were initially higher in women, but be-
came insignificant when accounting for body composi-
tion. Associations of other biomarkers that were initially 
lower in women, including LDL-p and triglycerides, and 
the inflammatory markers interleukin-18 and sST2, 
were completely attenuated after accounting for body 
composition. The vascular inflammatory marker mono-
cyte chemoattractant protein-1 and the methylarginine 
ADMA displayed significant inverse associations with 
female sex only after adjusting for body composition. 
Last, 2 biomarkers, homoarginine and adiponectin, dis-
played reversal of sex association after adjusting for 
body composition. Our findings with adiponectin sug-
gest that, in contrast with leptin (where sex differences 
persisted after multivariable adjustment), higher adipo-
nectin levels seen in women are entirely attributable to 
a more favorable body composition profile.
Effect of Menopausal Status on Biomarker Levels 
in Women
With menopause, women experience a fall in circulating 
estrogens with relative increase in androgen-to-estrogen 
ratio, redistribution of fat from lower body to abdomi-
nal compartments, shift toward more atherogenic lipid 
profiles, and increase in coronary disease and its risk 
factors.44 Although women are relatively protected 
from CVD in comparison with men in premenopausal 
years, this gap narrows as women cross through meno-
pause.7,44 Given the significant influence of menopause, 
it is important to consider sex differences in biomarkers 
in the context of life cycle changes in women.
In our study, menopause was associated with up-
ward shifts in most lipid parameters. Moreover, higher 
levels of HDL in women than in men were restricted to 
postmenopausal women, whereas lower LDL-C in women 
than in men was restricted to the premenopausal group. 
d-Dimer was associated with premenopausal status and 
the significantly higher levels seen in women than in men 
were unique to premenopausal women, which may reflect 
a higher relative risk of thromboembolism in younger 
women than in men.45,46 We also noted some differenc-
es in endothelial biomarkers when accounting for meno-
pausal status. For example, ADMA levels were higher in 
postmenopausal than premenopausal women, a finding 
that appeared to attenuate sex-based differences in this 
biomarker among older women. This finding highlights an 
increase in factors associated with endothelial dysfunction 
as women transition through menopause. Consistent with 
prior observations, we found that postmenopausal women 
have lower NT-proBNP levels than premenopausal women 
after full adjustment.47 Moreover, the robust sex-based dif-
ferences seen with NT-proBNP were entirely restricted to 
the premenopause group comparison. We have previously 
reported that androgens are inversely associated with NT-
proBNP levels,25 a finding that likely contributes to both the 
sex-based differences observed in premenopausal women 
versus younger men, and the change in natriuretic peptide 
levels in women after menopause. Loss of the natriuretic 
peptide advantage may be an important contributor to the 
narrowing of differences in CVD rates between women and 
men after women transition through menopause. It is inter-
esting to note that although sST2 and growth differentia-
tion factor-15 did not demonstrate significant sex associa-
tions in the overall cohort, we observed significantly lower 
levels in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal women 
in comparison with age-matched men.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the large sample size 
and sex and ethnic diversity of the DHS population, and 
the large numbers of biomarkers evaluated. The exclu-
sion of participants with known CVD allows for greater 
generalizability to the otherwise healthy population and 
eliminates preexisting CVD as a confounding variable for 
elevated biomarkers. Last, the extensive phenotyping of 
the study population, including detailed anthropometric 
and cardiac imaging measurements, allows for better

understanding of the role of body composition and heart 
size on sex differences in biomarkers.
A number of important limitations merit comment. 
First, the cross-sectional design of this study precludes 
assessment of the potential influence of sex-based dif-
ferences in biomarkers on cardiac or metabolic phe-
noytpe expression or clinical outcomes. In addition, 
sex hormone measurements in the DHS were limited to 
a subset of women, so we were unable to determine 
the influence of androgens and estrogens on sex differ-
ences in biomarkers. We acknowledge the exploratory 
nature of our study, and the potential for spurious find-
ings attributable to the large numbers of statistical tests 
performed. However, the majority of the P values were 
highly significant even after accounting for multiple test-
ing. Last, we acknowledge that the findings are descrip-
tive and can only be considered hypothesis generating 
regarding mechanisms of CVD.
CONCLUSIONS
Sex-specific differences were observed in multiple bio-
markers reflecting pathways of cardiovascular risk. 
Women tend to exhibit higher circulating levels of adi-
pokines and d-dimer and lower levels of biomarkers 
reflecting endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory cell 
recruitment. Body composition and menopausal status 
had important influences on the observed sex-based dif-
ferences in several biomarkers, highlighting the impor-
tance of these factors when interpreting differences in 
biomarkers and CVD between men and women.
