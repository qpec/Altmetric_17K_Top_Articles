 Normalization of Plus Size and the Danger of Unseen
Overweight and Obesity in England
Raya Muttarak

Objective: This study aimed to investigate trends and sociodemographic factors underlying weight mis-
perception in adults with overweight and obesity in England.
Methods: This study used descriptive and logistic regression analyses based on a pooled nationally rep-
resentative cross-sectional survey, Health Survey for England, for the years 1997, 1998, 2002, 2014, and
2015 of individuals with BMI � 25 (n 5 23,459). The main outcomes were (1) weight misperception and (2)
weight-loss attempts as well as the associations with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
and health status.
Results: The proportion of individuals with overweight and obesity misperceiving their weight status
increased over time between 1997 and 2015 (37% to 40% in men; 17% to 19% in women). There were
socioeconomic disparities in the misperception of weight status, with lower-educated individuals from
poorer-income households and members of minority ethnic groups being more likely to underestimate
their weight. Those underestimating their overweight and obesity status were 85% less likely to try to
lose weight compared with people who accurately identified their weight status.
Conclusions: The upward trend in underassessment of overweight and obesity status in England is pos-
sibly a result of the normalization of overweight and obesity. Obesity prevention programs need to con-
sider differential sociodemographic characteristics associated with underassessment of weight status.

Introduction
The year 2018 started with a fresh launch of new plus-size women’s
wear from Marks & Spencer, one of the leading fashion retailers in
the United Kingdom (1). The new fashion range is elegantly called
“Curve,” a more flattering term than “plus,” aiming to minimize the
negative image of plus-size fashion. By introducing a new design
and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully
selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily con-
tributes to promoting body positivity. While this type of body-
positive
movement
helps
reduce
stigmatization
of
larger-sized
bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being over-
weight and its health consequences.
Seeing the huge potential of the fuller-sized fashion market, plus-size
retailers may have indeed contributed to the normalization of stigma
associated with overweight and obesity. Not only have clothes for
larger-sized bodies been repackaged to flatter curvy women (2), chang-
ing the labeling of clothes sizes can distort consumers’ perceptions of
size (3). In the United Kingdom and United States, “vanity sizing,” or
size inflation whereby clothing manufacturers label the clothes with
sizes smaller than the actual cut, is widely practiced. Although purchas-
ing clothes with smaller size labels helps promote a positive self-related
mental imagery and self-esteem (4), vanity sizing can potentially lead
to the misperception of weight status and consequently undermine
action to reduce weight (5).
Furthermore, according to the visual normalization theory, as larger
body weights have become more common, overweight and obesity
have become normalized, leading to underestimation of weight sta-
tus (6). Indeed, both epidemiological data and experimental studies
have shown that exposure to obesity not only increases the accept-
ability of heavier body weights but also influences body shape pref-
erences (7,8). While it remains debatable whether the correct per-
ception of one’s own weight has a beneficial effect on health (9),
awareness of overweight status is a prerequisite for weight-loss
attempts (10). With more than one in four adults aged 15 and older

 classified as having clinical obesity in the United Kingdom (11),
underassessment of overweight can pose a serious global burden to
health and health expenditure (12,13).
To this end, this study aims to explore the trends in perceived
weight status among the English adult population with overweight
or obesity. The study also investigates demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors associated with self-perception of weight status, par-
ticularly weight underassessment and attempts to lose weight.
Methods
Data and participants
Using a multistage stratified sampling design, the Health Survey for
England is a nationally representative annual survey designed to pro-
vide regular information on the health of people in England. Data
collection
involves
both
face-to-face
interviews
and
a
self-
completion questionnaire. Apart from information on health and
health-related behaviors, information on socioeconomic factors,
physical measurements, and biological samples is also collected.
This allows for an estimation of the prevalence of risk factors and
behaviors associated with specified health conditions.
BMI is calculated based on weight and height information recorded
by trained nurses (kilograms divided by meters squared). These BMI
data are considered to be the major source of health statistics to
inform policies on obesity in the United Kingdom (14). The weight
status categories associated with BMI ranges are defined based on
the following World Health Organization guidelines: (1) BMI < 18.5
is classified as underweight, (2) BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal
weight, (3) BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 is overweight, and (4) BMI � 30.0
is obesity.
In order to assess trends in self-perception of weight status, the anal-
ysis was based on pooled data from 5 years (1997, 1998, 2002,
2014, 2015) of the Health Survey for England, which contained a
question on weight perception. The pooled data had a sample size of
77,424. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were
younger than 16 years of age (n 5 26,493) or were missing BMI
measures
(n 5 5,043),
information
on
their
weight
perception
(n 5 3,859), information on whether they were trying to change
weight (n 5 128), or information on ethnicity (n 5 9). This study
focuses on participants with BMI � 25, thus bringing the final ana-
lytic sample size to 23,459.
Measures
The primary outcome of interest was underassessment of overweight
and obesity status. This variable was constructed based on BMI
measures and the question on self-perception of one’s own weight.
Respondents were asked, “Given your age and height, would you
say that you are. . .” and were provided with the following four
options: (1) about the right weight, (2) too heavy, (3) too light, and
(4) not sure. Underassessment of overweight and obesity status was
a binary variable coded 1 when individuals with BMI > 25 described
themselves as too light or about the right weight, and they were
coded 0 otherwise.
The secondary outcome was whether the participants were trying to
lose weight. This variable was based on the survey question that
asks whether the respondent is currently trying to lose weight, trying
to gain weight, or not trying to change weight. Those who answered
that they were currently trying to lose weight were coded 1, and
they were coded 0 otherwise.
Statistical analyses
Stata software version 13.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas)
was used for statistical analysis. Multivariate logistic regression
analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between years
of survey, BMI status, and the outcome variables. All models were
adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, household income, and
self-rated health.
Results
A normalization of overweight and obesity has become widespread
in England. Among individuals with overweight or obesity, a sub-
stantial proportion, 38.5% of men and 17.2% of women, perceived
their weight as about the right weight. Figure 1 suggests that the
number of individuals with overweight underassessing their weight
increased over time, from 48.4% to 57.9% in men and 24.5% to
30.6% in women between 1997 and 2015. Similarly, among individ-
uals classified as having obesity, the proportion of men misperceiv-
ing their weight as about the right weight in 2015 doubled that of
1997 (6.6% vs. 12.0%).
Table 1 presents characteristics of the participants by weight under-
assessment and attempts to lose weight. Approximately 40% of the
participants were aged 16 to 44 years, the majority were white par-
ticipants, and about one-sixth reported having a degree qualification.
Among the sample with BMI > 25, about two-thirds were classified
as having overweight and one-third with obesity. The majority
(72.6%) reported their general health as good or very good.
Generally, men were more likely than women to underestimate their
overweight or obesity status (38.8% vs. 16.8%) and consequently

 were less likely to try to lose weight (48.1% vs. 71.1%). The pro-
portion underestimating their weight status was higher among over-
weight individuals compared with those with obesity (40.8% vs.
8.4%). Correspondingly, only about half of overweight individuals
were trying to lose weight compared with over two-thirds of those
with obesity. Table 1 also shows disparities in underassessment of
weight status and attempts to lose weight by demographic and socio-
economic characteristics.
Table 2 presents adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs based on
multivariate logistic regression estimates for underassessment of
weight status and attempts to lose weight. The odds of misperception
of weight status significantly declined with the level of education and
income. The odds of underestimating overweight and obesity among
individuals with no qualification was 1.8 times higher (95% CI: 1.63-
2.10) than those with degree qualifications. Likewise, individuals in
the bottom-income quintile were 1.3 times (95% CI: 1.15-1.49) more
likely to misperceive their weight compared with those in the top-
income quintile. Members of minority ethnic groups also had higher
odds of underestimating their weight compared with the white popula-
tion (black OR 3.75, 95% CI: 2.98-4.72; Asian OR 2.61, 95% CI:
2.17-3.14; other ethnic group OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.30-2.27).
Underassessment of weight status was negatively associated with
attempts to lose weight, with 85% reduction in the odds of trying to
lose weight (OR 0.16, 95% CI: 0.14-0.17). Attempts to lose weight
among individuals with overweight and obesity were also associated
with socioeconomic characteristics, with individuals with no degree
qualification and in lower-income quintiles being less likely to try to
lose weight. Compared with the white population, members of minor-
ity groups were more likely to try to lose weight (black OR 1.49, 95%
CI: 1.19-1.87; Asian OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.97-2.93).
Discussion
Despite being highlighted by Johnson et al. (15) in the BMJ a decade
ago, the problem of weight status misperception persists in the United
Kingdom. The persistence of the failure of individuals with over-
weight in weight recognition represents unsuccessful interventions of
health professionals in tackling overweight and obesity (15). A close
examination of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics asso-
ciated with underestimation of weight status reveals social inequalities
in weight misperception patterns. Among individuals with overweight
or obesity, men and individuals with lower levels of education and
income are more likely to underestimate their weight status and con-
comitantly less likely to try to lose weight. Members of minority eth-
nic groups are also more likely to underassess their weight status than
the white population but do not necessarily have a lower chance of try-
ing to lose weight. This type of exercise of identifying vulnerable sub-
groups of populations prone to misperceiving their weight status can
help in designing obesity prevention strategies targeting specific needs
of different groups.
The causes of socioeconomic inequalities in obesity, however, are
fairly complex. Not only does access to health care services matter,
but socioeconomic determinants related to living and working condi-
tions and health literacy also substantially influence health and
health behaviors (16). Likewise, the higher prevalence of overweight
and obesity among individuals with lower levels of education and
income may contribute to visual normalization, that is, more habit-
ual visual exposure to people with excess weight than their counter-
parts with higher socioeconomic status have (6). To achieve effec-
tive public health intervention programs, it is therefore vital to
prioritize inequities in overweight- and obesity-related risks.O
