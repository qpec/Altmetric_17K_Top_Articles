Abstract
Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges facing human health and wellbeing and
to promoting the uptake of research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better use of the
vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the
uptake of that evidence into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of synthesising and
interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer
support.
The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and
evaluate a ‘Knowledge System’ that automatically extracts, synthesises and interprets findings from BCI evaluation
reports to generate new insights about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention effectiveness and
(ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get
answers to variants of the question ‘What works, compared with what, how well, with what exposure, with what
behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and why?’.
Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and their reports linking effect sizes for given target
behaviours with intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated by exposure, populations
and settings; b) develop and train an automated feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this
ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports
to predict effect sizes for particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and settings; d) build user
and machine interfaces for interrogating and updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of
performance and utility.
Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise, interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour
change interventions that is up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the usefulness,
and support the implementation of, that evidence.

 Background
Many global threats to human health and wellbeing can
only be solved by people, organisations and governments
changing their behaviour. This includes behaviours dir-
ectly relevant to health but also behaviours of policy-
makers and providers responsible for promoting health
and delivering healthcare. To that end, we need to use evi-
dence being gathered about behaviour change more effect-
ively than at present. A great deal more evidence is
produced and published than it is possible for researchers
to be able to use effectively with conventional methods.
The current waste in research is being increasingly
recognised and addressed: for example, the Lancet series
“Research: increasing value, reducing waste” [1] and the
subsequent REWARD (REduce research Waste And
Reward Diligence) campaign [2]. The waste occurs in
biomedical and behavioural sciences and is apparent at
every stage of the research process, including poor
reporting of research so that evidence cannot be synthe-
sised and implemented effectively and efficiently. The
potential for implementation science to improve health
promotion and delivery will remain compromised unless
the problem of this waste is tackled.
The quantity, complexity and variability of reporting of
behaviour change intervention (BCI)g evaluations (see
Table 1 for glossary of definitions for terms identified with
the superscript g) severely limit the accessibility and value
of this evidence for those who need it (Optimising the
value of the evidence generated in Implementation Sci-
ence: the use of ontologies to address the challenges, In-
vited submission forthcoming). The Human Behaviour-
Change Project (HBCP) will develop and evaluate a BCI
Knowledge Systemg: an automated system delivering com-
prehensive, high quality, timely and accessible syntheses
and interpretations of evidence.
The challenges of a rapidly expanding, complex evidence
base
BCIsg are policies, activities, services or products designed
to induce or support people to act differently from how
they would have acted otherwise. They involve attempting
to change either characteristics of members of the target
population (in terms of their knowledge, skills, beliefs,
feelings or habits), or their social or physical environment,
or both. In the large majority of cases, the goal is to
achieve change that is sustained over an extended period
of time (e.g., reducing excessive alcohol consumption or
smoking prevalence in the general population, or fostering
new prescribing patterns among clinicians). Research find-
ings have the potential to provide invaluable knowledge to
help with developing or selecting BCIs but this evidence
needs to be synthesised and interpreted. We need a cumu-
lative, contemporaneous and accessible knowledge baseg
of behaviour change findings to continue to build the sci-
ence of human behaviour change.
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide a means
of gathering and synthesising this evidence but the
scientific literature on behaviour change is vast and
accumulating exponentially. Considering the person-
hours required for any given review, there are neither
the human nor financial resources to achieve this manu-
ally at the scale required. Insufficient human resources
to undertake evidence reviews and syntheses also means
that these are often out of date by the time of comple-
tion [3]. The median time for primary study results to
be incorporated into a systematic review has been found
to range from 2.5 to 6.5 years [4] and only a minority of
reviews are updated within 2 years of publication [5]. A
further limitation of the current method is that there is
often insufficient power in the evidence gathered to en-
able moderator analyses, especially for under-researched
populations and geographical areas.
In addition, the diversity in the literature presents con-
siderable challenges when it comes to making general-
isations in terms of intervention effectiveness. Target
behavioursg vary widely in their characteristics, from
cessation of unwanted behaviours such as tobacco smok-
ing to increases in desired ones such as implementing
evidence-based practice. The types of interventions eval-
uated are also subject to wide variation from policies
such as raising excise duty on unhealthy products to
digital mobile applications for promoting medication ad-
herence. Populationsg also vary, with some studies in-
volving what are intended to be general population
samples and others based on participants with special
characteristics, such as mental health problems. Settingsg
vary across dimensions from physical locality to culture.
With such diversity in the evidence base, there is a need
for a coherent conceptual framework to allow evidence
from different studies to be integrated and compared.
Addressing heterogeneity in the research literature is
made more challenging by inconsistent and incomplete
reporting of interventions and study methods and find-
ings. The situation has been improved by the publication
of a number of guidelines [6], but intervention evaluations
still vary widely in quality and format, and are reported
inconsistently and incompletely using terminology with
limited standardisation [7].
Methods of evidence synthesis such as meta-analysis
and meta-regression have substantially improved the
ability to draw generalisable conclusions from interven-
tion evaluations, but they are mostly limited to making
inferences about simple effects for interventions that
have been evaluated, or first-order interactions with
moderator variables. More advanced statistical tech-
niques are beginning to be developed [8], and will need
to be built on. There is a need to be able to draw

 inferences that take account of complex interactions
between intervention characteristics, populations and
settings. Moreover, even with the numbers of studies
retrievable by current methods, the populations and
settings to which one may wish to generalise are so
varied that making inferences from studies to real-
world applications is problematic.
Important challenges facing evidence synthesis and
interpretation, and approaches to addressing those chal-
lenges are shown in Table 2.

is to build a Knowledge System that accesses the grow-
ing number of BCI evaluation reportsg, automatically an-
notates these reports to identify key featuresg, and
synthesises and interprets the findings to answer variants
of the big question: ‘What works, compared with what,
how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for
how long), for whom, in what settings and why?’. The
project includes the development of a user interfaceg to

A multi-disciplinary team, spanning behavioural, com-
puter and information scientists and system architects, sup-
ported by substantial engagement from scientists and users,
will develop and evaluate the first iteration of the HBCP es-
tablishing proof of principle, with an initial focus on smok-
ing cessation. This domain was selected due to its large and
relatively well-defined evidence base and outcome measures
that are relatively robust and important for public health.
Organising and classifying research, and generating
inferences: The role of ontologies
The process of knowledge accumulation requires a com-
mon conceptual framework within which information
can be represented. Data structures that organise know-
ledge in a structure that specifies entitiesg and their rela-
tionships are called ‘ontologies’g [10, 11].
In information science an ‘ontology’ is defined as a
data structure consisting of a set of 1) unique identifiers
representing types of ‘entity’g (primarily objectsg, attribu-
tesg, processesg, or collections of these), 2) labels and
definitions corresponding to these identifiers, and 3)
specified relationships between the entities. The labels
and definitions of entities and relationships in a given
ontologyg make up a ‘controlled vocabulary’ which pro-
vides a basis for the interoperability of databases using
the ontology [10, 11].
Ontologies have transformed a number of areas of
science. Most notably the Gene Ontology has unified the
field of biology which previously was highly fragmented
[12].
Ontology
development
requires
considerable
expertise and to that end the OBO Foundry [13] was
established to provide a resource for ontology developers
and a set of guiding principles from which to work.
As yet, no widely-used ontology has been developed
for behavioural science, although ones have been devel-
oped for public health [14] and mental entities such as
emotions [15], mental disorders and mental functioning
[16]. An ontology for understanding human behaviour
change needs to represent both causal relationships (e.g.,
that a given type of intervention affects a given behav-
iour in a specified context) as well as semantic relation-
ships (e.g., that a given type of intervention is a subclass
of a broader type of intervention) [10, 11].
The HBCP will develop a BCI ontology (BCIOg) that
will define important entities described in BCI evalu-
ation reports. Fig. 1 shows upper-level entities that need
to be captured in the BCIO and some of their relation-
ships. The labels for these may change in the course of
development of the BCIO but this provides an indication
of what information needs to be captured. Note that
Fig. 1 is not the formal ontology but is shown to illus-
trate key parts that need to be included.
The BCIO includes entities that are important in
answering questions about BCI effectiveness as follows:
� BCI evaluation report is a written description of a
BCI study, which provides information about one or
more BCI evaluations (see below), including the
intervention(s) being evaluated, study methods and
findings. It will typically involve a published paper
but may include information from more than one
paper, for example if important features of the
methods are described in a protocol paper.
� BCI study is an empirical data-gathering activity
consisting of one or more BCI evaluations.
� BCI evaluation is a comparison between two or
more BCI scenariosg.
� Methodg defined as the set of attributes of BCI
evaluation methods. These include study design (e.g.,
controlled trial), measures, sample identification and
recruitment, sample size, and ‘quality’
� Effectg defined as the result of a comparison
between outcomes of each pair of intervention and
comparator scenarios. It is specified in terms of an
effect descriptor (e.g., odds ratio, risk difference),
effect size and confidence intervals.
� Risk of bias featuresg are features of the BCI
evaluation report and method that may have an

 impact on the observed effect of a BCI evaluation.
These include study design, blinding, method of
randomisation etc.
� BCI scenariog is a scenario (a sequence or
development of events) consisting of a BCI, its target
behaviours, and factors that influence the outcome
of the BCI in relation to the target behaviour
(Fig. 2). A BCI scenario may be hypothetical (if it
is one that is being considered for modelling
purposes), planned (if it is one that is or has been
intended), or realised (if it has been enacted, for
example in a BCI evaluation). When annotating
BCI evaluation reports (see below) the aim is to
capture the realised BCI scenarios based on
information from the reports. When querying the
knowledge base (see below) the aim will be to
present features of a planned or hypothetical BCI
scenario with a view to obtaining a prediction of
the likely outcome.
� Outcome (behaviour)g defined as the type(s) of
behaviour that the BCI seeks to change (e.g.,
tobacco smoking) together with a collection of
attributes (e.g., duration, frequency or incidence)
that together make specific types of outcome
measure (e.g., self-report of not smoking for
6 months supported by a salivary cotinine
concentration of less than 15 ng/ml measured
at the final follow up point) [17].
� Interventiong defined as a set of types of policies,
activities, services or products that are intended
to result in a specified outcome in relation to the
target behaviour. The intervention is specified in
terms of summary descriptors (e.g., ‘brief
opportunistic advice from a GP on smoking’)
together with detailed descriptions of ‘content’g
such as the techniques used (e.g., pharmacological
support, verbal persuasion about capability etc.),
and ‘delivery’g (e.g., 5 min, single session, verbal,
face-to-face, during a routine consultation, by GP,
trained with UK National Centre for Smoking
Cessation Very Brief Advice online course). The
term ‘intervention’ is also used to refer to any
comparator in a BCI evaluation (e.g., usual care).
� Contextg defined as factors (consisting of
characteristics of the population and setting) not
directly connected with the intervention that may
influence the intervention’s effect.

Fig. 2 Upper-level entities in BCI scenarios, and their
causal connections
Michie et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:121 
Page 6 of 12
 � Exposureg defined as factors relating to the
interaction between the intervention and the target
population (the extent and nature of the target
population’s access to and engagement with the
intervention) that may influence the intervention’s
effect. Consists of reachg (e.g., the proportion of the
target population that has access to, or is exposed
to, the intervention) and engagementg (e.g., the
extent and nature of the target population’s
interaction with intervention components).
� Mechanism of actiong defined as the type(s) of
process by which interventions influence the target
behaviour (e.g., through increasing strength and
frequency of feelings of concern about the risks of
an unhealthy behaviour; providing a physical or
social cue to action).
� Outcome (behaviour) valueg defined as the value
attaching to the target behaviour for a given BCI
scenario (e.g., the outcome would be 15% of the
population where the target behaviour was six
months of continuous abstinence from smoking).
The entities in the BCI scenario interact in specific
ways, as showed by the arrows in Fig. 2. The content
and delivery of an intervention influences the target
behaviour through one or more mechanisms of action.
The context moderates the influence of 1) the interven-
tion on the mechanism of action and 2) the mechanism
of action on the behaviour. Exposure moderates the in-
fluence of the intervention on the mechanism of action
and is itself influenced by the intervention and context.
Thus if a GP prescribes nicotine replacement therapy
(intervention) to smokers interested in stopping (popula-
tion), as part of a routine consultation in a GP surgery
in the UK (context), and 60% of smokers obtain the
medication and start the treatment, and 50% take it as
prescribed (exposure), this may reduce cigarette cravings
(mechanism of action) and so lead to at least 6 months
of abstinence (outcome behaviour) in 15% (outcome
value) of cases [18].
If one were to conduct a study to assess the effect of
GPs
prescribing
nicotine
replacement
therapy,
this
scenario would be compared with a BCI scenario such
as GP advice without the offer of a prescription. The com-
parison would have a number of features relating to study
design (e.g., RCT), sample recruitment and selection, sam-
ple size, baseline and outcome measures etc. The compari-
son of outcomes between the two scenarios would
constitute the ‘effect’ of the prescription intervention rela-
tive to advice without a prescription, expressed in terms of
an odds ratio or risk ratio with a corresponding confidence
interval. The observed effect would therefore be a function
of the features of the intervention and comparator BCI
scenarios together with the study methods (Fig. 1).
The role of computer science in the HBCP
Artificial intelligence (AIg) and machine learning (MLg)
applications have been developed to generate and inter-
rogate large, accumulating knowledge bases using onto-
logical approaches. In the HBCP, building computer
programs to extract and process knowledge from text
documents at a level that is usable by experts in the do-
main, requires several elements that can generally be
equated with intelligence, such as advanced reading abil-
ity and significant domain understanding. In this respect,
a computer program performing this task can be
thought of as artificially intelligent.
Building computer programs to perform tasks such as
recognising patterns in text is usually achieved by apply-
ing a technique called statistical learning, where a com-
puter program uses example patterns and examples
from a training set to construct a statistical model of
how a task should be performed. This model can then
be generalised to process new, unseen data thereby per-
forming the desired task with high confidence. The tech-
nique is statistical because the computer program uses
weightings learned from statistical properties of the
training examples - for example - frequencies with
which important words appear in text.
Other approaches to artificial intelligence, such as logic-
based reasoning have been successful in domains such as
robotics and sensor-based systems. Here axioms or rules
describe the behaviour of the world allowing a computer
program to decide how to respond to inputs. Since the
HBCP is concerned with learning patterns from text it is ex-
pected that statistical learning, rather than other approaches
such as logic-based learning, will be most appropriate.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been
used successfully, for example, in banking customer ser-
vice [19], and in areas of medicine [20–22]. IBM’s
‘Watson Oncology’ uses AI and ML to extract informa-
tion from research publications to help clinicians iden-
tify appropriate treatment options. Algorithmsg are used
for entity recognition, information extraction, semantic
query expansion in information retrieval, pattern detec-
tion, sentiment analysis, and reasoning [23–26].
In the HBCP, computer scientists will develop auto-
mated processes to annotate BCI evaluation reports in
terms of key features defined according to the BCIO.
These will populate a databaseg structured according to
the BCIO. Automated annotationg will require develop-
ing and training ‘natural language processing’ (NLPg)
algorithms and other systems for extracting features from
tables and graphs. ML together with reasoning algor-
ithmsg will then be used to synthesise and interpret the
findings to answer questions and make predictions about
what would be expected in as yet unstudied scenariosg.
Evidence from studies of human-computer interactiong
(HCI) will inform the development of the user interface
Michie et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:121 
Page 7 of 12
 through which people will use the system. Different
groups of users will have different requirements and con-
cerns, which will be addressed in the way that information
is presented, and the functionalities available for interact-
ing with it. Understanding user interaction in this project
is particularly important, given the ‘black box’ nature of
the knowledge base that people will be querying. Address-
ing concerns relating to the Knowledge System’s trust-
worthiness, and how the reliability of its predictions can
be evidenced, are likely to be particularly important.
Aim and research questions
The aim is to develop and evaluate the first generation
of a BCI Knowledge System consisting of: the first
version of the BCIO; a continually growing database of
annotated BCI evaluation reports and inferences drawn
from these; algorithms used to create the annotations
and draw inferences; and an interface that will allow
human users and other computer systems to query and
update the database of annotations and inferences. Fig. 3
shows the main components of the BCI Knowledge
System that is proposed and how they interact.
The main research questions fall into two categories: (1)
those relating to creation of the BCI Knowledge System
(the BCIO, the database of annotated BCI evaluation
reports, the automated feature extraction algorithms used
to annotate these reports, the ML and reasoning algo-
rithms used to synthesise the evidence and draw infer-
ences, stored inferences, and the interface), and (2) those
relating to evaluation of the BCI Knowledge System.
1. Creating the BCI knowledge system
i. What are the key features that need to be captured
from BCI evaluation reports and models of
behaviour change to build the BCIO? In particular,
how should we represent: i) the content and delivery
of interventions and comparators; ii) exposure to
interventions and comparators in terms of reach
(whether the intervention/comparator reached the
sample studied) and how far and in what ways the
targeted population engaged with the intervention
and comparator; iii) targeted behaviours in terms of
type of behaviour, duration and specific outcome

Methods
Overview
Six sets of activities will be undertaken, much of the
work being conducted in parallel: 1) forming and
engaging with stakeholder groups; 2) developing the
BCIO; 3) annotating BCI evaluations according to the
BCIO using manual and automated processes and build-
ing the BCI databaseg; 4) developing and applying ML
and reasoning algorithms to draw inferences in response
to queries; 5) developing an interface for users and other
applications to query the system and provide feedback
that can be used to update the BCI Knowledge System
as a whole; and 6) evaluating the BCI Knowledge System
and its components.
Details of the methodological approach being taken to
BCI Ontology development, manual annotation of BCI
evaluation reports and the development of automated
annotation algorithms, machine learning and reasoning
algorithms are presented in Additional file 1. Methods of
working will be made accessible in Open Science Frame-
work [27] as they are updated. Outputs and processes of
the HBCP will be made available to potential collaborators
who are interested in applying these or conducting com-
plementary projects. We will engage a wide variety of
stakeholders in a number of groups to enable engagement
across countries, cultures, academic disciplines and behav-
ioural domains. A summary of engagement methods are
outlined in Additional file 2.
Development of the HBCP interface
An interface will be developed to facilitate querying and
updating the knowledge base, and the BCI Knowledge
System as a whole. It will consist of a machine interface
and a user interface.
The machine interface will provide the primary means
by which BCI reports are added to the database. It will
provide a facility by which programs that search and
screen reports can feed those that are relevant into the
database, ready for annotation. It will also include an ap-
plication programming interface (API) to allow for other
programs to formulate queries and receive responses in
machine readable form. The aim is to make the BCI
Knowledge System as interoperable as possible with
other software that is being, and will be, developed.
The user interface will be a website that will build on
the wide range of external perspectives that have fed into
the BCIO development and ML components of this
work and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders.
It will handle three types of scenario:
1. Users will be able to query the system and obtain
results in multiple forms (e.g., lists of individual
studies, synthesised data, and inferences from the
BCI database). The interface will come in several
forms that are tailored for particular groups of users.
2. HBCP stakeholders will be able to interact with the
BCIO, the BCI database, and the individual BCI
reports in a flexible way. For example they will be
able to propose scenarios specified using a purpose-
built syntax and conduct sensitivity analyses in
which particular studies are included or excluded.
They will need elevated privileges for some tasks
(e.g., direct editing of annotated research reports).
3. Members of the HBCP research team will be able to
use the interface to evaluate, develop and refine the
BCIO and ML and reasoning algorithms.
Users of the interface will be able to generate queries
about BCI scenarios. They will enter fixed or constrained
parameters (e.g., the behavioural outcome, the mode of
delivery, the target population, the setting, or a range of
effect sizes) and interrogate the BCI knowledge base for
predicted values of BCIO entities that are left open.
Examples of queries are shown in Table 3.
Because users will vary in their levels of expertise in
the topic of the query, the user interface will provide a
facility to guide them through the generation of the
query so that they arrive at the most useful results. For
example, users may start the query at too general a level
of abstraction for the Knowledge System to be able to
generate meaningful results, or they may not be aware
of the importance of particular moderators or interven-
tion components when generating the query. The user
interface should be able to draw attention to these issues
and prompt users to generate queries that get the most
out of the data available.
Users will also be able to use the interface to generate
a curated and annotated bibliography of research re-
ports relevant to their query. This may be particularly
useful for systematic reviewers who may want to take
advantage of the precision with which the system will
Michie et al. Implementation Science  (2017) 12:121

 permit searches to be carried out, but may want to
undertake data extraction and synthesis by hand or
using a different program.
Evaluation of the BCI knowledge system
The HBCP involves evaluation of BCI Knowledge Sys-
tem as a whole as well as its parts. There will be an
ongoing
process
of
evaluation
and
development
throughout the project, but at a certain point it will
be necessary to assess to what extent the project has
met its objectives, and to provide information to
guide future decisions. In accordance with the HBCP
research questions, the HBCP will undertake the fol-
lowing assessment:
i. The adequacy, applicability, and validity of the
BCIO. BC experts blind to the specific content of
the BCIO will annotate intervention reports to
identify all information they consider to be essential.
The HBCP team will compare these annotations
with the BCIO annotations to identify omissions or
incompletely included information and discuss the
results with the BC experts.
ii. Inter-rater reliability of the manual annotation
process. The manual annotation will form the basis
for training the automated annotator and so it is
important that it be as accurate as possible. In the
absence of an objective gold standard against which
to assess accuracy, assessing inter-rater reliability will
provide an index of likely accuracy. This can be
achieved using methods similar to those already in
place for identifying behaviour change techniques
and modes of delivery [28, 29]. This involves calcu-
lating reliability statistics for sets of annotations.
iii. Accuracy of the automated annotator. Predictive
accuracy of the automated annotator (i.e., its ability
to match the study classifications of the manual
annotations) will be assessed throughout the project
through accuracy, precision and recall metrics,
taking account of the hierarchical structure of the
ontology and the inevitable dependency between
classifications (e.g., a given outcome classification is
highly likely to co-occur with a given intervention).
iv. Accuracy of predictions from the ML and reasoning
algorithms. We will establish manually, by
collaborating with behavioural change experts, a set
of established effects and associated facts and will
test the ML and reasoning algorithms against it by
measuring the percentage of predictions that are in
agreement.
v. Comparison of BCI Knowledge System with existing
methods of evidence synthesis. We will create
automated systematic reviews using the BCI
Ontology to select relevant studies in conjunction
with user input; use the automated data extraction
and study evaluation tools to conduct syntheses and
compare the results of this computer-assisted work
with published systematic reviews, evaluating the

practitioners, local government officers and national
policymakers) and assess the extent to which the
system is able to generate knowledge that addresses
specific decisions.
vii.New insights about behaviour change that are
generated by the system. We will assess the extent to

Discussion
The HBCP is an ambitious project aimed at developing
and evaluating the first generation of a BCI Knowledge
System. This will consist of a BCI Ontology, a set of
processes and resources for manually annotating BCI
evaluation reports according to this ontology to popu-
late a BCI database, an automated annotator to achieve
the annotation at scale with an acceptable level of
accuracy for further populating the BCI database, a set
of ML and reasoning algorithms to draw inferences
from the BCI database, and an interface to allow users
and other computer programs and to query and input
to the knowledge base.
The first generation of the BCI Knowledge System will
focus on synthesising and interpreting evidence from
smoking cessation intervention evaluations in Cochrane
reviews. The ontology will draw on established ontol-
ogies in related domains and be part of the OBO Foun-
dry to maximise interoperability with other ontologies.
An international network of stakeholders will be estab-
lished to bring key experts and users into the develop-
ment, evaluation and dissemination process. The BCI
Knowledge System and its parts will undergo ongoing
evaluation to inform its development and summative
evaluation towards the end of the project to assess how
far the project objectives have been met. It is hoped that
the HBCP will represent the start of a new phase in be-
havioural and implementation science in which much
more efficient use is made of the burgeoning research
literature both for theory development and practical
applications.
