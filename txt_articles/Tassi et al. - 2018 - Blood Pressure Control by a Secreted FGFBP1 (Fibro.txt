he family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) encom-
passes 18 FGF receptor ligands and 7 distinct receptor 
proteins with a wide expression range. They have distinct 
roles in embryonic development, in adult organ homeosta-
sis and vascular adaptation, and in a wide range of diseases.1 
Genome-wide association studies in hypertensive populations 
have shown a potential role of molecules in the FGF path-
way.2 Polymorphisms in the FGF5 locus were associated with 
blood pressure regulation and hypertension in large popula-
tions of European3,4 and Japanese ancestry.5 Variations in the 
FGF1 locus correlated with familial hypertension and with the 
upregulation of FGF1 expression in kidneys.6,7 Also, genomic 
analysis revealed that a polymorphism in the FGFBP1 locus 
(FGFBP1 [FGF-binding protein 1]) was associated with famil-
ial hypertension, and hypertensive subjects showed increased 
expression of BP1 mRNA and protein in renal tissues.8 Studies 
in hypertensive rats corroborated a contribution of the FGFBP1 
genomic locus to glomerular damage and to hypertension.9 
Still, we lack information about mechanisms by which BP1 
may control blood pressure and how it fits into the known para-
digms of blood pressure control.10
Secreted FGF-binding proteins (BPs) shuttle paracrine-act-
ing FGFs from their extracellular matrix storage sites to their 
receptors and, thus, enhance their signaling.11,12 BP1 (origi-
nally named HBp1713 and FGF-BP) is the best characterized 
of the 3 known members of the family14 and interacts via its 
C terminus15 with FGF1, 2, 7, 10, and 22 in a reversible, non-
covalent manner.13,16–18 Depletion of endogenous BP1 reduced 
FGF2 release and blunted tumor growth and angiogenesis of 
human cancer cells19 and resulted in distinct developmental 
defects during chick embryogenesis.20 On the contrary, BP1 
is upregulated in angioproliferative Kaposi sarcoma,21 contrib-
utes to an angiogenic phenotype of cultured endothelial cells,22 
and controls angiogenesis and wound healing in adult mice.23,24
Here, we evaluate how the upregulation of BP1 may cause 
hypertension. For this, we used a transgenic mouse model with 
conditional BP1 gene expression under tetracycline control.23 
We found that induction of BP1 expression results in sustained 
Abstract—Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) participate in organ development and tissue maintenance, as well as the control 
of vascular function. The paracrine-acting FGFs are stored in the extracellular matrix, and their release is controlled by a 
secreted FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP, FGFBP1, and BP1) that modulates FGF receptor signaling. A genetic polymorphism 
in the human FGFBP1 gene was associated with higher gene expression and an increased risk of familial hypertension. 
Here, we report on the effects of inducible BP1 expression in a transgenic mouse model. Induction of BP1 expression in 
adult animals leads to a sustained rise in mean arterial pressure by >30 mm Hg. The hypertensive effect of BP1 expression 
is prevented by candesartan, an angiotensin II (AngII) receptor antagonist, or by tempol, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen 
species. In vivo, BP1 expression sensitizes peripheral resistance vessels to AngII constriction by 20-fold but does not 
alter adrenergic vasoconstriction. FGF receptor kinase inhibition reverses the sensitization to AngII. Also, constriction of 
isolated renal afferent arterioles by AngII is enhanced after BP1 expression and blocked by FGF receptor kinase inhibition. 
Furthermore, AngII-mediated constriction of renal afferent arterioles is abolished in FGF2−/− mice but can be restored by 
add-back of FGF2 plus BP1 proteins. In contrast to AngII, adrenergic constriction is not affected in the FGF2−/− model. 
Proteomics and gene expression analysis of kidney tissues after BP1 induction show that MAPK (mitogen-activated protein 
kinase) signaling via MKK4 (MAPK kinase 4), p38, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) integrates the crosstalk of the FGF 
receptor and AngII pathways and thus impact vascular tone and blood pressure.  (Hypertension. 2018;71:160-167. DOI:

Results
Conditional Expression of BP1 In Vivo
We had found that BP1 transgene expression results in embry-
onic lethality because of vascular leakage.25 Thus, we estab-
lished a conditional transgenic mouse model where BP1 
transgene expression is repressed by tetracycline (OFF) and 
induced by switching animals to a regular diet (ON),23 thus 
avoiding the negative impact of embryonic gene expression. 
In vivo regulation of conditional BP1 mRNA and protein 
expression in kidneys of transgenic animals was confirmed by 
quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription–polymerase chain 
reaction) and staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
kidneys from BP1 OFF and ON transgenic animals (Figure 1A 
and 1B). Inducible BP1 mRNA and protein expression was also 
confirmed in heart and lung tissues by quantitative RT-PCR and 
by Western blot analysis that showed the BP1 protein migrat-
ing at the predicted mass of 34 kDa after induction of expres-
sion (Figure S1 in the online-only Data Supplement). Overall, 
we found that BP1 mRNA was inducible by 3- to 5-fold.
BP1 Expression and Blood Pressure Control
To test the effect of conditional expression of BP1, mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP) was monitored by telemetry in conscious 
transgenic mice. Under control conditions (BP1 OFF), there is 
a circadian rhythm of MAP that varied by 20 mm Hg between 
periods of activity (night time) and rest (day time). A sinus 
wave function described the day/night variation of the data 
(Figure 2A). 
Analysis of a 10-day period before and after induc-
tion of the BP1 transgene in the same animals showed a rise 
of MAP during the activity phase by >30 mm Hg (Figure 2C) 
and an almost doubling of the MAP changes between activity 
and rest periods (Figure 2A). This overall increase in MAP 
coincided with a significant decrease in the heart rate and a 
dampened amplitude of circadian regulation (Figure 2B). The 
increase of blood pressure occurred within 2 days of a switch 
to the tetracycline-free, regular diet in parallel with the induc-
tion of the BP1 transgene (Figure 2C). Switching nontrans-
genic littermates from tetracycline-containing diet to regular 
diet did not change MAP (Figure 2C, circles versus triangles).
Role of AngII and ROS
The increase in MAP and decrease in heart rate after induction 
of BP1 expression (Figure 2A and 2B) are reminiscent of an 
angiotensin-like vasopressor effect that can depend on ROS 
signaling.26 To assess whether endogenous AngII receptor 
signaling and ROS contribute to BP1-mediated hypertension, 
mice were treated with the receptor antagonist Candesartan or 
the redox-cycling antioxidant nitroxide tempol.27 Candesartan 
reduced basal MAP (Figure 2D, gray bar) and prevented the 
increase of MAP after BP1 induction (Figure 2D, gray versus 
black bars). Tempol also reduced basal MAP (Figure 2E gray 
bars) and prevented the increase in MAP after BP1 induction 
(Figure 2E gray versus black bars).
Induction of BP1, FGF Pathway Activation, 
and Vessel Contractility
To evaluate whether conditional BP1 expression sensitizes 
resistance vessels in vivo, cremaster arterioles were exposed in 
anesthetized mice and superfused locally with vasoconstrictor 
or vasodilator ligands. Representative intravital microscopic 
images of an arteriole at baseline, with AngII (constriction) 
or acetylcholine (dilation) superfusion is shown in Figure 3A. 
There was a 20-fold sensitization of the AngII vasoconstrictor 
response after the induction of BP1 gene expression (EC50=230 
nmol/L versus 12 nmol/L; Figure 3B; P<0.0001 BP1 OFF ver-
sus ON). This sensitization was prevented by pretreatment of 
animals with the FGFR kinase inhibitor PD17307423 (Figure 3B, 
filled black versus red circles). Control animals (BP1 OFF) 
showed only a small and insignificant effect after the FGFR 
kinase inhibitor (Figure 3B, open black versus red circles).
We inquired whether BP1 expression also could sensitize 
the cremaster arterioles to other vasoconstrictive stimuli. We 
had found previously that adrenergic receptor activation in 
resistance arterioles, unlike AngII, does not induce ROS gen-
eration and induces vasoconstriction that is not enhanced by 
oxidative stress.28 Thus, we selected phenylephrine as a ligand 
that activates α1-adrenergic receptors. The extent of vasocon-
striction by phenylephrine was similar to AngII (Figure 3B 
versus 3C; BP1 OFF). But, unlike AngII, BP1 expression did 
not sensitize vessels to phenylephrine (Figure 3C). Neither the 
EC50 (2 µmol/L) nor the maximal effect of phenylephrine were 
different between the BP1 ON and OFF groups (Figure 3C).

Thus, conditional expression of BP1 sensitizes arterioles 
to AngII in vivo. This sensitization is dependent on FGFR 
signaling.
BP1 Impacts Contractility of Renal Afferent 
Arterioles
Isolated vessels provide an approach for the analysis of vas-
cular function that is not affected by systemic cardiovascular 
regulation in the intact animal. BP1 upregulation related to 
human hypertension was found in the kidneys that are key 
organs in systemic blood pressure regulation. Thus, we evalu-
ated the impact of BP1 expression in isolated renal afferent arte-
rioles that are the major renal resistance vessels.29 Figure 4A 
shows the experimental set-up with a glomerulus and an affer-
ent arteriole mounted onto a perfusion pipette. Addition of 
AngII to this preparation leads to a concentration-dependent

constriction. Afferent arterioles isolated from mice after con-
ditional BP1 transgene expression showed a significantly 
enhanced effect of AngII (Figure 4B, open versus closed cir-
cles). Pretreatment of the vessels with the FGFR kinase inhib-
itor PD173074 inhibited the effect of AngII (Figure 4B, blue 
symbol) to a level similar to the response in arterioles from 
FGF2−/− mice (red, open symbols). Thus, the AngII contractile 
effect depends on FGFR signaling in isolated vessels and in 
arterioles in vivo (see above; Figure 3B).
Contribution of FGF2 to the Effect of BP1
Kidneys contain among the highest concentrations of FGF2 
protein that is immobilized in the extracellular matrix30 and 
can be released by BP1 as outlined in the introduction. To 
assess a contribution by FGF2, we investigated the efficacy of 
AngII and the crosstalk with BP1 in renal afferent arterioles 
from FGF2−/− mice. FGF2−/− mice had shown a reduced vascu-
lar tone and lower blood pressure.31,32 We confirmed by tele-
metric measurements that MAP in FGF2−/− mice is reduced 
significantly by 15 mm Hg relative to wild-type mice (Figure 
S2A, open versus closed bar). Also, we found that the effect 
of exogenously administered AngII on MAP was reduced 
(Figure S2A).
Consistent with the blood pressure effect, AngII failed to 
induce a contraction in renal afferent arterioles isolated from 
the FGF2−/− mice (Figure 4B and 4C, open red symbols). The 
blockade of AngII effects in vessels from wild-type mice by an 
FGFR kinase inhibitor (Figure 4B, red open versus blue sym-
bols) corroborates the crucial role of FGF signaling for AngII 
efficacy. It is noteworthy that vessels from FGF2−/− mice still 
contracted in response to other ligands: The effect of norepi-
nephrine was indistinguishable between FGF2−/− and wild-type 
controls (Figure 4D, black versus red symbols), indicating a 
selective cross talk between AngII and FGF signaling. Renal 
AT1R (AngII receptor 1) mRNA was not changed on induction 
of BP1 expression or in FGF2−/− mice (Figure S3).
Because FGF2 and BP1 are extracellularly acting proteins, 
we added recombinant proteins to renal afferent arterioles 
from FGF2−/− mice to assess whether this would rescue AngII 
vasoconstriction. Although FGF2 alone did not impact the 
AngII response most likely because of its capture by the extra-
cellular matrix, the combination of FGF2 and BP1 restored a 
full contractile response of AngII (Figure 4C).
Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis
An unbiased gene expression analysis by cDNA array was 
undertaken in kidneys before and 2 days after induction of 
BP1, that is, after the initial rise in blood pressure (Figure 2C). 
Upstream regulators were identified using the Ingenuity plat-
form and gene set enrichment analysis to detect expression 
patterns associated with signaling pathways.
The upstream regulator analysis (Figure 5A; complete 
list in Table S1) showed positive z scores >+1 and P values 
<10−10 for the gene sets controlled by the transcriptional regu-
lators tumor suppressor P53 (TP53), NRF2 (nuclear factor 
erythroid-derived 2-like 2 [NFE2L2]), and CREB1 (cAMP 
responsive element–binding protein 1). TP53 modulates cel-
lular stress response genes,33 NRF2 regulates antioxidant 
genes, and ChIPseq has shown an overlap of the target genes 
of NRF2 and of CREB1.34 This analysis corroborates the 
contribution of ROS signaling after BP1 induction that was 
shown to contribute to the effect in functional studies with 
the antioxidant tempol27 (Figure 2E). FGF2 was also identified 
as one of the upstream regulators. The loss of the AngII con-

contractility by an FGFR kinase inhibitor (Figures 3B and 4B) 
support a regulatory role of FGF2.
Negative z scores <−1 in the upstream regulator analysis 
were related to drugs that can inhibit effects of BP1 expres-
sion, that is, AT1R (losartan), MKK (U0126; PD98059), and 
PI3K (LY294002). Also, microRNA-16 was indicated as a 
significant (P<10–6) upstream regulator with a negative z score 
<−2. MicroRNA-16 controls endothelial cell response to 
growth factors in vivo and, thus, provides a negative feedback 
loop for growth factor signaling.35
The gene set enrichment analysis showed significantly 
impacted hallmark pathways that are exemplified in Figure 5B 
(complete list in Table S2). P53 was identified as a hallmark 
pathway that matches with the identification of P53 as an 
upstream regulator. The hypoxia hallmark pathway can be 
integrated with the NRF2 upstream regulator and TNF-α path-
way signaling via NFkB matches with NFkB as an upstream 
regulator. Thus, evaluation of gene expression with different 
platforms provides complementary insights into the regulation 
of tissue homeostasis after BP1 induction.
Signal Transduction Proteins
We hypothesized that an analysis of changes in protein phos-
phorylation and formation of signaling complexes could provide 
additional insight into altered pathways in BP1 ON versus OFF 
mice. Thus, kidney proteins were extracted with mild detergent to

maintain protein/protein interactions and protein complexes cap-
tured with an immobilized antiphosphotyrosine (pY) monoclonal 
antibody. As established previously, changes in signal complexes 
can, thus, be revealed if one of the protein partners in the com-
plexes is tyrosine phosphorylated (pY).36 Two-dimensional gel 
electrophoresis was used to separate the pY-containing protein 
complexes. Imaging analysis of Coomassie-stained gels quanti-
tated distinct spots that were identified by mass spectrometry.36
Four proteins that integrate into the known signaling 
pathway were covered by at least 8 distinct peptides (Figure 
S4; Figure 6). Two of these pY-complexed proteins identi-
fied were increased by ≈4-fold after BP1 induction and are 
known downstream effectors of the Rho family of small 
G-proteins37 that regulate a multitude of cellular functions, 
PAK2 (p21 CDC42/RAC1-activated kinase 2)38 and CIT/
STK21 (citron or RHO-interacting, serine/threonine kinase 
21).39 In earlier studies, Sundaresan et al40 have reported that 
Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins such as RAC1 func-
tion as cellular regulators of ROS, an effect that was mimicked 
by exogenously added growth factors. A third protein, MKK4 
(=MAP2K4) was found 3.6-fold upregulated in a pY complex 
after BP1 expression. MKK4 integrates mitogenic and stress 
signaling and targets the MAP kinases JNK and p38. A fourth 
protein, PTPN12 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor 
type 12) was found reduced by 2.8-fold after BP1 induction. 
In general, PTPs are thought to function as negative feedback 
controls of tyrosine kinase activities that can be inactivated by 
ROS signaling.41 PTPN12 has been linked to altered oxidative 
stress and its loss to enhanced oncogenic signaling.42
Validation of Signaling Proteins
For an independent validation of the nodes of signaling uncov-
ered in the above studies, we analyzed kidney tissues by immu-
nohistochemical staining. Staining of parallel tissue sections 
for phosphoproteins in the MAP kinase pathway downstream 
of the FGF receptor1 showed an increase in phospho-MKK4, 
phospho-p38, and phospho-JNK after BP1 expression 
(Figure 5C). For p38, the induction of phosphorylation was 
confirmed by Western blotting of protein extracts (Figure 5D). 
No differences in phospho-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase) staining of kidneys were seen (not shown).
FGF and AngII Pathway Crosstalk in Cultured 
Human Cells
Cultured kidney cells (HEK293) were used to expand the above 
findings in an animal model to human cells. Combinations of 
increasing concentrations of FGF2 and AngII were studied for 
their induction of phosphorylation of MKK4 and the MAP 
kinases ERK, JNK, and p38. An increase in phospho-MKK4, 
phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38 was found in the costimula-
tion with FGF2 and AngII (Figure S5). In contrast, costimu-
lation with FGF and AngII did not induce phospho-ERK. A 
parallel analysis in human endothelial and smooth muscle 
cells (Figure S6) corroborates this analysis. After costimula-
tion with FGF2 and AngII, phospho-p38 was induced in con-
trast to phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK.
Discussion
Activation of GPCRs (G-protein–coupled receptors) and 
receptor tyrosine kinases such as the FGFR initiate converg-
ing signaling cascades in cells to elicit a phenotypic response. 
Earlier studies in rat aortic smooth muscle cells showed an 
increase of AngII-stimulated Ca2+ release after treatment with 
FGF2 and a blockade of the increase after inhibition of the 
MAP kinase pathway, suggesting a crosstalk that could be 
relevant for the initiation of hypertension.43 Also, FGF2 was 
found to be essential for mediating AngII-induced cardiomy-
opathy that used the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways.44 
Moreover, endogenous FGF2 has been implicated in pulmo-
nary hypertension45 and cardiac hypertrophy,46 conditions 
associated with increased vascular resistance.
Some mechanistic insight into the cross talk between path-
ways that control vascular tone and angiogenic signals emerged 
from inhibitors of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-
driven tumor angiogenesis used to treat cancers. VEGF path-
way activity is restricted to endothelial cells, and the major side 
effect of systemic therapy with VEGF pathway inhibitors is 
hypertension caused by the reduction of constitutive endothe-
lial NO synthase.47 FGFs also act on endothelial cells, and their 
effects overlap with VEGF. Indeed, intravascular administra-
tion of exogenous FGF1 or FGF2 lowers the blood pressure in 
experimental animals and can correct hypertension by preferen-
tial targeting of endothelial signaling attributable to this route of 
FGF administration.48,49 Because endogenous FGFs also act on 
vascular smooth muscle cells, the balance with their endothelial 
activity explains the apparent paradox that FGF2-deficient mice 
are hypotensive31,32 (Figure S2) despite the hypotensive effect 
of intravenously administered FGF2. It is conceivable that the

lower MAP observed after induction of BP1 in tempol-treated 
animals (Figure 2E, gray versus black bar) is also because of 
a shift to the vasodilatory FGF signaling under inhibition of 
ROS by tempol. Interestingly, AngII also shows distinct activ-
ity on blood pressure that depends on the cell type stimulated. 
Typically, AngII will cause vasoconstriction and a rise in blood 
pressure (Figure 3; Figure S2). However, AngII reduced blood 
pressure in animals that only expressed endothelial AngII 
receptors because of the vasodilatory effects of the endothelial 
stimulus.50
Here, we show that the predominant effect of FGF path-
way activation by the induction of BP1 expression is to 
increase blood pressure by sensitizing resistance vessels to 
AngII (Figures 3 and 4). This sensitization to AngII vaso-
constriction was reversed by an FGFR kinase inhibitor, sup-
porting the notion that increased BP1 expression activates the 
FGF pathway and thus increases vessel sensitivity for AngII. 
The increased baseline sensitivity of resistance vessels was 
reflected in increased blood pressure that is dependent on 
AngII receptor signaling as evidenced by the inhibitory effects 
of the receptor antagonist Candesartan (Figure 2D). We do not 
know whether other antihypertensives may also be effective.
When evaluating the GPCR/FGFR cross talk further, we 
found a qualitative difference between 
AngII and α-adrenoceptor 
sensitization of arteriolar contractility after FGF pathway acti-
vation (Figure 3B versus 3C and Figure 4C versus 4D). We pro-
pose that this difference is because of the distinct downstream 
effectors of these GPCRs. Previous studies showed that chronic 
AngII infusion increased vascular superoxide that enhanced the 
pressor response26 and increased arteriole constriction by AngII 
but not by norepinephrine.51 Thus, distinct intracellular effec-
tors can modulate the crosstalk of FGFR and AngII.
Perspectives
The modulation of FGF signaling by BP1 can regulate vascu-
lar sensitivity to endogenous AngII and hence control steady-
state blood pressure. Together with the finding of genomic 
polymorphisms of the human FGFBP1 gene resulting in 
increased expression of BP1 in tissues, our studies establish 
BP1 as a potential driver gene of hypertension.

What Is New?
• We report on a secreted fibroblast growth factor–binding protein that 
enhances fibroblast growth factor signaling, modulates angiotensin II 
vasoconstriction, and blood pressure.
What Is Relevant?
• Genomic polymorphisms of genes in the fibroblast growth factor path-
way have been found associated with an increased risk of hypertension.
Summary
We show the cross talk between fibroblast growth factor and an-
giotensin II pathway signaling in regulating blood pressure.
