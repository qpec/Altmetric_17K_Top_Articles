Background. Feelings of loneliness are common among young adults, and are hypothesized to impair the quality of
sleep. In the present study, we tested associations between loneliness and sleep quality in a nationally representative
sample of young adults. Further, based on the hypothesis that sleep problems in lonely individuals are driven by
increased vigilance for threat, we tested whether past exposure to violence exacerbated this association.
Method. Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a birth cohort of 2232 twins
born in England and Wales in 1994 and 1995. We measured loneliness using items from the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and
sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. We controlled for covariates including social isolation, psycho-
pathology, employment status and being a parent of an infant. We examined twin differences to control for unmeasured
genetic and family environment factors.
Results. Feelings of loneliness were associated with worse overall sleep quality. Loneliness was associated specifically
with subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction. These associations were robust to controls for covariates. Among
monozygotic twins, within-twin pair differences in loneliness were significantly associated with within-pair differences
in sleep quality, indicating an association independent of unmeasured familial influences. The association between lone-
liness and sleep quality was exacerbated among individuals exposed to violence victimization in adolescence or maltreat-
ment in childhood.
Conclusions. Loneliness is robustly associated with poorer sleep quality in young people, underscoring the importance
of early interventions to mitigate the long-term outcomes of loneliness. Special care should be directed towards indivi-
duals who have experienced victimization.

Introduction
Loneliness is defined as a distressing feeling that is
experienced when social connections are perceived to
be inadequate (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). An evolution-
ary account of loneliness proposes that for members of
a social species, being embedded within a group pro-
vides safety, and the perception of being socially cut
off gives rise to feelings of vulnerability (Cacioppo
et al. 2006a). This triggers changes in cognition and
behaviour that serve to guard the individual against
potential threats (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009). One
hypothesis implied by this model is that feelings of
loneliness are associated with impaired sleep quality:
as sleep is a state in which it is impossible to remain
vigilant, the unsafe feeling of loneliness is at odds
with restful sleep. Research has shown that lonely
individuals report poorer subjective sleep quality and
experience more fragmented sleep, as measured via
actigraphy, while their total duration of sleep is
unaffected (Cacioppo et al. 2002; Pressman et al. 2005;
Hawkley et al. 2010a; Kurina et al. 2011). Thus, while
lonely individuals do not appear to sleep more or
less than non-lonely individuals, their sleep may be
less restful, consistent with the hypothesis that raised
vigilance for threat intrudes on the sleep state.
In the present study, we investigated associations
between loneliness and sleep quality in a nationally

 representative cohort of young adults. This age group
is of particular interest for two reasons. First, loneliness
is especially prevalent at this stage of life, concomitant
with shifts in young adults’ social needs and environ-
ments (Office for National Statistics, 2014; Qualter et al.
2015). Second, a significant proportion of individuals
experience loneliness persistently over time (Newall
et al. 2013), and chronic social disconnection predicts
poor health outcomes in a dose–response manner
(Caspi et al. 2006; Danese et al. 2009). Therefore, indivi-
duals who become lonely early in life may be particu-
larly at risk for ill health in the future. Prior studies
which have found associations between loneliness
and sleep in this age group have used opportunity
samples of university undergraduates (Cacioppo et al.
2002; Pressman et al. 2005); however, it is important
to ascertain whether the profile of sleep impairments
generalizes across the full range of socio-economic
and
occupational
circumstances
in
the
young
population.
Research has shown that the associations between
loneliness and sleep problems are not accounted for
by plausible confounders such as depression, body
mass index or health-related behaviours (Cacioppo
et al. 2002; Hawkley et al. 2010a; Kurina et al. 2011).
However, sleep impairments are included among the
diagnostic criteria for a number of mental health disor-
ders, including generalized anxiety and post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(American
Psychiatric
Association,
2013), underscoring the need to control comprehen-
sively for symptoms of psychopathology in order to
test the independence of the association between lone-
liness
and
sleep.
Other
sources
of
confounding
are more difficult to control for, including genetic
influences. There is evidence for substantial heritability
of both loneliness (Goossens et al. 2015; Matthews et al.
2016) and sleep quality (Barclay et al. 2010), and their
association may be partly explained by shared genetic
aetiologies. Furthermore, unmeasured factors in the
family environment, such as parental influences or
life events, may also contribute jointly to the experi-
ences of loneliness and sleep quality. One approach
by which these confounds can be controlled is by com-
paring individuals from the same family, using a
design such as monozygotic (MZ) twin differences
(Vitaro et al. 2009). As members of an MZ twin pair
share identical genomes and grow up in the same fam-
ily home, any differences within pairs is attributable to
experiences unique to individuals. Measuring MZ twin
differences on two traits allows their association to be
tested while holding family-wide influences constant.
Not all lonely individuals necessarily experience
sleep problems, and it is possible that other factors
play a role in exacerbating their susceptibility to
sleep impairments. Given that one of the posited
reasons for the restless sleep of lonely individuals is
a perception of threat in the environment, past expos-
ure to actual threats may intensify this perception
and further compromise the restfulness of sleep.
Exposure to violence victimization is one plausible
candidate. Imaging studies have shown that childhood
maltreatment is associated with increased amygdala
activation in response to threatening social stimuli,
suggesting heightened vigilance for threat (McCrory
et al. 2011). This lends itself to the possibility that per-
ceptions of threats triggered by loneliness may be par-
ticularly pronounced among individuals with a history
of violence victimization, magnifying the disruption of
sleep. Using longitudinal data, we tested for an exacer-
bating influence of violence victimization on the rela-
tionship between loneliness and sleep. Specifically,
we
examined
recent
victimization
experiences
in
adolescence, and tested whether the effect could be
extended earlier in life with childhood maltreatment.
Method
Participants
Participants were members of the Environmental Risk
(E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, which tracks the
development of a birth cohort of 2232 British children.
The sample was drawn from a larger birth register of
twins born in England and Wales in 1994–1995
(Trouton et al. 2002). Full details about the sample
have been reported elsewhere (Moffitt & E-Risk
Study Team, 2002). Briefly, the E-Risk sample was con-
structed in 1999–2000, when 1116 families (93% of
those eligible) with same-sex 5-year-old twins partici-
pated in home-visit assessments. This sample com-
prised 56% MZ and 44% dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs;
sex was evenly distributed within zygosity (49% male).
Families were recruited to represent the UK popula-
tion with newborns in the 1990s, to ensure adequate
numbers of children in disadvantaged homes and to
avoid an excess of twins born to well-educated
women using assisted reproduction. The study sample
represents the full range of socio-economic conditions in
Great Britain, as reflected in the families’ distribution on
a neighbourhood-level socio-economic index [ACORN
(A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods), devel-
oped by CACI Inc. for commercial use] (Odgers et al.
2012a, b). Specifically, E-Risk families’ ACORN distribu-
tion matches that of households nationwide: 25.6% of
E-Riskfamilieslivein‘wealthyachiever’neighbourhoods
compared with 25.3% nationwide; 5.3% v. 11.6% live in
‘urban prosperity’ neighbourhoods; 29.6% v. 26.9% live
in ‘comfortably off’ neighbourhoods; 13.4% v. 13.9% live
in ‘moderate means’ neighbourhoods, and 26.1% v.
20.7% live in ‘hard-pressed’ neighbourhoods. E-Risk

Follow-up home visits were conducted when the
children were aged 7 years (98% participation), 10
years (96% participation), 12 years (96% participation),
and, most recently in 2012–2014, at 18 years (93% par-
ticipation). There were 2066 participants who took part
in the E-Risk assessments at age 18 years, and the pro-
portions of MZ (55%) and male same-sex (47%) twins
were almost identical to those found in the original
sample at age 5 years. The average age of the twins
at the time of the assessment was 18.4 years (S.D. =
0.36); all interviews were conducted after their 18th
birthday. There were no differences between those
who did and did not take part at age 18 years in
terms of socio-economic status assessed when the
cohort was initially defined (χ2 = 0.86, p = 0.65), intelli-
gence quotient scores at age 5 years (t = 0.98, p = 0.33),
and emotional or behavioural problems at age 5 years
(t = 0.40, p = 0.69 and t = 0.41, p = 0.68, respectively).
Home visits at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 years included assess-
ments with participants as well as their mother (or
primary caretaker); the home visit at age 18 years
included interviews only with the participants. Each
twin was assessed by a different interviewer.
The Joint South London and Maudsley and the
Institute of Psychiatry Research Ethics Committee
approved each phase of the study. Parents gave informed
consent and twins gave assent between 5 and 12 years
and then informed consent at age 18 years.
Measures
Loneliness
We measured current feelings of loneliness at age 18
years using four items from the UCLA Loneliness
Scale, version 3 (Russell, 1996): ‘How often do you
feel that you lack companionship?’, ‘How often do
you feel left out?’, ‘How often do you feel isolated
from others?’ and ‘How often do you feel alone?’.
These items were rated ‘hardly ever’ (0), ‘some of the
time’ (1) or ‘often’ (2). The items were administered
as part of a self-completed computer-based question-
naire. We summed the responses to produce a total
loneliness score (Cronbach α = 0.83).
We also assessed loneliness using interviewers’
reports. After the home visits, the study interviewers
(n = 14) completed an inventory of questions about
their overall impressions of the participants’ personal-
ity and behaviour, based on their observations during
the structured interview. Interviewers were trained
to familiarize themselves with the questions in order
to know what to observe, and took comprehensive
notes on which to base their responses. The questions
were completed immediately after the home visit in
order to maximize recall. The interviewers had not
met the participants prior to the visit. We used three
of the items to construct a measure of interviewer-rated
loneliness: ‘seems lonely’, ‘feels that no one cares for
them’ and ‘has trouble making friends’. Items were
coded ‘no’ (0), ‘a little/somewhat’ (1) and ‘yes’ (2). As
the self-report loneliness measure was administered
via computer, interviewers were blind to participants’
responses. We summed the three items to create a
total scale (Cronbach α = 0.70). The correlation between
the self-report and interviewer ratings of loneliness
was 0.46.
Sleep quality
We measured sleep quality at age 18 years using the
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al.
1989). The PSQI consists of 18 self-report items relating
to individuals’ sleep patterns and different forms of
sleep impairment in the past month. These questions
are used to derive scores for seven different compo-
nents of sleep (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency,
sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep distur-
bances, use of sleep medication and daytime dysfunc-
tion), each scored from 0 to 3. These were summed
to produce a global score ranging from 0 to 21,
with higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality. The
mean global PSQI score in the present sample was
5.39 (S.D. = 3.18).
Covariates
To test the independence of the association between
loneliness and sleep quality at age 18 years, we con-
trolled for social isolation, based on the hypothesis
that the subjective experience of loneliness would be
associated with sleep quality over and above indivi-
duals’ actual degree of social connection. We further
controlled for symptoms of depression, anxiety, alco-
hol abuse and dependence, attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). We also controlled for individuals
who were not in employment, education or training
(NEET) or who were a parent of an infant, two circum-
stances which could lead to changes in social activities
and sleeping schedules. Full details of covariates are
presented in Table 1.
Violence victimization
We assessed violence victimization between the ages of
12 and 18 years using the Juvenile Victimization
Questionnaire (JVQ; Finkelhor et al. 2011). The JVQ
contains questions covering seven forms of victimiza-
tion: crime, peer/sibling, Internet, sexual, family, mal-
treatment and neglect. We asked participants to

 answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each item, and when an instance
of victimization was reported, further notes were taken
about the details of the incident. Information from the
JVQ was used to compile victimization ‘dossiers’ of
each participant, which were coded for severity by
four raters (Fisher et al. 2015). Overall severity of vio-
lence victimization was grouped into three categories:
no exposure (47.6%), some exposure (28.1%) and
severe exposure (24.3%).
We assessed exposure to maltreatment in childhood
when participants were aged 5, 7, 10 and 12 years, via
interviews with participants’ mothers. At age 5 years,
assessments were based on the standardized clinical
protocol
from
the
MultiSite
Child
Development
Project (Dodge et al. 1990; Lansford et al. 2002). At
ages 7, 10 and 12 years this interview was modified
to expand its coverage of contexts for child harm.
Interviews were designed to enhance mothers’ comfort
with reporting valid child maltreatment information,
while also meeting researchers’ responsibilities for
referral under the UK Children Act. We asked mothers
whether either of their twins had been intentionally
harmed (physically or sexually) by an adult or had
contact with welfare agencies. Information on mal-
treatment collected over the years of data collection
was compiled into a profile for each participant.
These profiles were reviewed by two clinical psycholo-
gists and coded no harm (78.9%), probable harm
(15.4%) and definite harm (5.7%).
Data analysis
We used linear regressions to examine the associations
between loneliness and overall sleep quality. To test for
a specific profile of sleep complaints associated with
loneliness, we conducted ordinal logistic regressions
using each of the seven components of the PSQI. We
verified the robustness of these associations first by
controlling individually for each covariate (social isola-
tion, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, ADHD, PTSD,
NEET and being a parent of an infant), and finally
by
entering
all
covariates
simultaneously
in
the
model. As both loneliness and sleep quality were mea-
sured via self-report, we conducted a sensitivity ana-
lysis by testing the association between interviewer
ratings of participants’ loneliness and self-reported
sleep quality.
We controlled further for genetic and shared family
factors using twin differences. MZ twin differences are
attributable only to experiences unique to individuals,
as the influence of genes and experiences within the
family are held constant. Thus, if associations between
loneliness
and
sleep
quality
are
environmentally
mediated, MZ twins who are lonelier than their
co-twins would also have more sleep difficulties. To
test this, we regressed the within-twin pair differences
for sleep quality on the within-twin pair differences for
loneliness. We conducted this analysis first on the
whole sample, which controlled completely for the
shared environment. We then repeated the analysis
using MZ twins (n = 560 pairs), to control for both gen-
etic and family environmental confounds.
We tested for an exacerbating effect of violence vic-
timization on the association between loneliness and
sleep quality using linear regression. In each analysis,
we regressed sleep quality on loneliness, victimization
and an interaction term (loneliness × victimization).
We carried out this analysis first using adolescent

 victimization (age 12–18 years) as the moderator and,
second, using childhood maltreatment (birth to age
12 years). As a further step, we repeated these analyses
while controlling separately for covariates.
All analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp,
2015). Participants in this study were pairs of same-sex
twins, and therefore each family contained data for
two individuals, resulting in non-independent obser-
vations. To correct for this, we used tests based on
the Huber–White or sandwich variance (Williams,
2000), which adjusts the estimated standard errors to
account for the dependence in the data.
Results
Associations between loneliness and sleep quality
Individuals who were lonelier reported worse overall
sleep quality [β = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.24–0.33;
Table
2].
Social
isolation,
depression,
anxiety, alcohol use, ADHD, PTSD, NEET and being
a parent of an infant were all associated with sleep
quality over and above loneliness. However, none of
these individual covariates explained the association
between loneliness and sleep quality. When all covari-
ates were entered simultaneously, this association
reduced but remained significant (β = 0.07, 95% CI
0.02–0.12).
Sensitivity analyses indicated that interviewer-rated
loneliness
was
significantly
associated
with
self-
reported sleep quality, with a similar effect size to
that of self-reported loneliness (β = 0.23, 95% CI 0.17–
0.28). This association remained significant when con-
trolling for each covariate. Entering social isolation
into the model led to greater attenuation of the regres-
sion coefficient for interviewer-rated loneliness (43%)
compared with that of self-reported loneliness (21%).
Nonetheless, social isolation failed to fully account
for the association.
Loneliness was significantly associated with each of
the seven components of the PSQI (Table 3). However,
after controlling for all covariates, loneliness remained
independently
associated
specifically
with
poorer
subjective sleep quality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.10, 95%
CI 1.03–1.16] and greater daytime dysfunction (OR =
1.24, 95% CI 1.17–1.31).
Environmental association between loneliness and
sleep quality
In the full sample (MZ and DZ twins), within-twin
pair differences in loneliness were associated with
within-pair differences in sleep quality (β = 0.20, 95%
CI 0.14–0.27), indicating that the association between
these
experiences
is
independent
of
unmeasured
influences from the family environment. Among MZ

 twins, within-pair differences in loneliness remained
significantly associated with within-pair differences
in sleep quality (β = 0.15, 95% CI 0.06–0.24). As
shown in Fig. 1, among a subset of MZ pairs who
were discordant for loneliness, the lonelier twins
experienced poorer sleep quality than their non-lonely
co-twins (Cohen’s d = 0.20). This indicates an environ-
mentally
mediated
association
between
loneliness
and sleep which is independent of unmeasured genetic
and family factors.
Exacerbating effects of violence victimization on the
association between loneliness and sleep quality
Individuals exposed to victimization during adoles-
cence experienced both greater loneliness (β = 0.18,
95% CI 0.13–0.23) and worse sleep quality (β = 0.24,
95%
CI
0.19–0.28)
in
early
adulthood.
Violence
victimization moderated the association between lone-
liness and sleep quality, such that this association was
stronger among those exposed to more severe victim-
ization (interaction term: β = 0.06, 95% CI 0.02–0.10;
Fig. 2). When controlling separately for depression
and PTSD, the interaction term became non-significant,
suggesting that symptoms of psychopathology may be
a pathway through which adolescent victimization
moderates the association between loneliness and
sleep quality.
When looking at the effect of victimization in child-
hood, individuals who experienced definite harm were
lonelier (β = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02–0.12) and had poorer
sleep quality (β = 0.10, 95% CI 0.05–0.16) in early
adulthood. Childhood maltreatment showed a similar
moderating effect to that of adolescent victimization;
the association between loneliness and sleep was exa-
cerbated among those exposed to maltreatment (inter-
action term: β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.01–0.09; Fig. 2). This
effect was not explained by controls for covariates.
Sex differences
Loneliness did not differ by sex. Females had on aver-
age poorer sleep quality than males (mean = 5.69 v.
5.07, respectively; p < 0.001). No sex differences were
detected in the associations between loneliness and
sleep quality.
Discussion
In line with previous studies (Cacioppo et al. 2002;
Hawkley et al. 2010a; Kurina et al. 2011), we showed
a modest but robust association between loneliness
and poorer sleep quality in a nationally representative

 cohort of young adults. We furthered this evidence by
showing that the association was not explained by lone-
liness and sleep quality having common genetic origins
or by confounding influences from the environments
shared by twins. Further, the strength of this association
in young adulthood was moderated by exposure to vio-
lence during childhood and adolescence. In the case of
more recent exposure in adolescence, symptoms of
depression or PTSD may be pathways through which
victimization exerts this exacerbating effect.
Although the associations between loneliness and
sleep quality were small, they emerged from a thor-
ough and stringent test for an independent association,
controlling for many other factors which may explain
their co-occurrence. In particular, the MZ twin differ-
ences method is a robust test which controls compre-
hensively for unobserved sources of variation within
families and other environments shared by siblings.
Furthermore,
loneliness
is
often
accompanied
by
depressive symptoms (Cacioppo et al. 2006b; Matthews
et al. 2016), which in turn have their own negative effects
on sleep. Of all the covariates investigated, depression
was the most strongly associated with sleep problems;
a finding that is not unexpected given that changes in
sleep are included among the diagnostic criteria for
major depression (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). However, the association between loneliness
and sleep problems was independent of the contribution
of depression.
Impoverished social connections increase the risk of
numerous negative health outcomes, including ele-
vated blood pressure (Hawkley et al. 2010b), impaired
immune functioning (Pressman et al. 2005), obesity
(Lauder et al. 2006) and mortality (Holt-Lunstad et al.
2015). Deficiencies in the quantity and quality of
sleep are predictive of similar health problems (Irwin,
2002; Gangwisch et al. 2006; Patel & Hu, 2008;
Cappucio et al. 2010). Markers of long-term health out-
comes are unlikely to be detectable at the young age of
the present cohort. Nonetheless, our findings indicate
that a relationship between loneliness and reduced
sleep quality is already present in young adulthood.
Longitudinal research is necessary to test whether the
foreshortened lifespan observed in chronically lonely
individuals is explained, in part, by the effects of dimin-
ished sleep quality. Furthermore, whileyoung adulthood
is an important period for the formation of social relation-
ships,lonelinesscould also have roots inearlyattachment
problems; therefore, a further goal for future research
should be to investigate the potential role of attachment
styles in explaining or modifying the relationship
between loneliness and sleep.
We identified a subgroup of lonely individuals
exposed to violence victimization who were particu-
larly vulnerable to experiencing poorer sleep quality.
Loneliness is associated with changes in cognition
that include raised vigilance for threats in the environ-
ment (Cacioppo et al. 2006a; Cacioppo & Hawkley,
2009). Past exposure to actual threats such as victimiza-
tion may establish a pre-existing vulnerability for lone-
liness to act upon, by reinforcing perceptions of others’
intent to harm. To the extent that vigilance for threats
undermines the restfulness of sleep, this may account
for the exacerbating effect of violence victimization
that we detected. It should be noted, however, that
there could be other psychological processes that medi-
ate the relationship between loneliness and sleep pro-
blems, such as rumination. Further investigation is
warranted
to
investigate
the
range
of
pathways
through which loneliness may intrude on sleep.
Some physiological processes may also explain
the association between loneliness and sleep quality.

 A first possible candidate is the stress response.
Loneliness is associated with changes in circulating
cortisol, indicating elevated hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis activation (Pressman et al. 2005; Doane
& Adam, 2010). Physiological arousal resulting from
this process may play a role in the disrupted sleep of
lonely individuals. Second, when looking at individual
items, lonely individuals reported two out of 10
specific sources of sleep disturbance: feeling too cold,
and having bad dreams. Whilst this finding should
be interpreted with caution, it suggests potential ave-
nues of further investigation. For instance, experimen-
tal research has found an association between social
exclusion and reductions in perceived ambient tem-
perature (Zhong & Leonardelli, 2008). Further, dream
disturbances are associated with greater stress and
anxiety (Levin & Nielsen, 2007), and may represent a
further manifestation of emotional distress in lonely
individuals.
Our study has some limitations. Loneliness and
sleep quality were measured cross-sectionally, and
no conclusions can be drawn about the directionality
of the associations. Daytime dysfunction may, for
example, contribute to stability or increases in loneli-
ness by hindering social interactions. However, prior
longitudinal findings indicate that loneliness more
strongly predicts subsequent sleep quality, rather
than vice-versa (Hawkley et al. 2010a). Second, by vir-
tue of the twin design, all participants had at least one
sibling, which should reduce loneliness on average.
Twins are same-age siblings who may feel closer
than typical siblings. If this is true, then rates of loneli-
ness and effects of loneliness may be underestimated in
our sample.
A third limitation is that both loneliness and sleep
quality were measured via self-report. However, fur-
ther analyses showed that the associations between
loneliness and sleep quality were replicated when
interviewers’ ratings were substituted for self-reported
loneliness. Interestingly, controlling for social isolation
led to greater attenuation of the association between
loneliness and sleep quality when loneliness was mea-
sured via interviewer report. Apotential explanationfor
thisisthat independent observers are morelikelytoconfl-
ate social isolation and loneliness in others, in which case
using self-reports is a strength, rather than a weakness,
when assessing loneliness. It remains possible, however,
that self-reports of sleep quality may be vulnerable to
reporting bias. Polysomnography and actigraphy meas-
ure aspects of sleep more objectively but are less practical
to implement in large cohort studies involving compre-
hensive interview assessments. Nonetheless, the PSQI is
a well-validated and widely used instrument, and is cor-
relatedwithothermeasurementapproachessuchassleep
diaries (Buysse et al. 1989; Backhaus et al. 2002). Different
methods each provide unique information about sleep,
and there is value in using a variety of approaches to
build a thorough profile of sleep impairments (Gregory
& Sadeh, 2016). Our findings complement those of stud-
ies using objective measures (Cacioppo et al. 2002; Kurina
et al. 2011), showing that lonely individuals experience
more fragmented sleep.
Conclusions
Diminished sleep quality is one of the many ways in
which loneliness gets ‘under the skin’, and our
findings underscore the importance of early interven-
tion to reduce loneliness in young people, which may
be the starting point for a cascade of physical health
problems in later life. Studies of interventions to reduce
loneliness suggest that resolving negative social cogni-
tions that can damage social interactions is an expedi-
ent strategy (Masi et al. 2011; Cacioppo et al. 2015).
Further, our findings suggest that interventions should
consider not only individuals’ current social circum-
stances, but also influences of past experiences includ-
ing violence victimization, which may constitute a
pre-existing vulnerability that exacerbates the effects
of loneliness. Future research should explore in more
detail loneliness’s relationship with victimization and
other forms of trauma.
