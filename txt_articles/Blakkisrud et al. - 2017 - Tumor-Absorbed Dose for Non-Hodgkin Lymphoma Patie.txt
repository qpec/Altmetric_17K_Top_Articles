177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan is a novel antibody radionuclide con-
jugate currently tested in a phase 1/2a first-in-human dosage esca-
lation trial for patients with relapsed CD371 indolent non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. The aim of this work was to develop dosimetric methods
and calculate tumor-absorbed radiation doses for patients treated
with 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. Methods: Patients were treated
at escalating injected activities (10, 15 and 20 MBq/kg) of 177Lu-
lilotomab satetraxetan and with different predosing, with or without
40 mg of unlabeled lilotomab. Eight patients were included for the
tumor dosimetry study. Tumor radioactivity concentrations were cal-
culated from SPECT acquisitions at multiple time points, and
tumor masses were delineated from corresponding CT scans.
Tumor-absorbed doses were then calculated using the OLINDA sphere
model. To perform voxel dosimetry, the SPECT/CT data and an in-
house–developed MATLAB program were combined to investigate
the dose rate homogeneity. Results: Twenty-six tumors in 8 pa-
tients were ascribed a mean tumor-absorbed dose. Absorbed
doses ranged from 75 to 794 cGy, with a median of 264 cGy across
different dosage levels and different predosing. A significant corre-
lation between the dosage level and tumor-absorbed dose was
found. Twenty-one tumors were included for voxel dosimetry and
parameters describing dose–volume coverage calculated. The inves-
tigation of intratumor voxel doses indicates that mean tumor dose is
correlated to these parameters. Conclusion: Tumor-absorbed doses
for patients treated with 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan are compara-
ble to doses reported for other radioimmunotherapy compounds.
Although the intertumor variability was considerable, a correlation
between tumor dose and patient dosage level was found. Our re-
sults indicate that mean dose may be used as the sole dosimetric
parameter on the lesion level.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of
malignant hematologic disorders. In the United States, NHL is the
fifth most common cancer, with 71,850 estimated new cases in
2015 (1). Most NHLs derive from B-lymphocytes and express
B-cell antigens such as CD19, CD20, and CD37. Relapses are
common after conventional treatments for NHL, such as external-
beam radiation therapy or immunochemotherapy (2). Radioimmu-
notherapy, or antibody radionuclide conjugate (ARC) therapy, is a
treatment that uses targeting antibodies linked to a radionuclide.
Two ARCs are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration: 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar) and 90Y-ibritumomab-
tiuxetan (Zevalin) (3). Both agents consist of a monoclonal antibody
specific for the CD20 antigen, with a b-emitting radionuclide
attached. Considering that these 2 ARCs are used after patients
have been treated with several rounds of rituximab, which also
targets CD20, a conjugate that targets a different antigen would be
desirable. 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin [Nordic Nano-
vector ASA], previously referred to as 177Lu-DOTA-HH1) is a
novel ARC, in which the lilotomab antibody binds to CD37 anti-
gens expressed on malignant B cells (4,5). 177Lu is a b-emitter
with a mean b-energy of 0.133 MeV (mean and max b-range in
water, 0.25 and 1.9 mm, respectively) that also emits photons with
g-energies of 113 (6%) and 208 keV (11%), permitting g-camera
and SPECT/CT imaging as a means of dosimetry (6).
Insight into absorbed dose to tumors is of high importance to
assess treatment efficiency. In external-beam radiation therapy,
dose planning to optimize tumor dose and dose to organs at risk is
considered essential. Over the last years, there has been increased
focus on dosimetry also for internal emitters. Although the Com-
mittee on MIRD pamphlets suggest guidelines for normal tissue and
tumor dosimetry, there is still a lack of consensus on how and when
to perform dose calculations and how to evaluate doses for most
radionuclide therapies. 131I-tositumomab SPECT-based tumor do-
simetry was initially done by daily planar imaging supported by a
single SPECT acquisition (7,8). Later, more comprehensive dosi-
metric models were developed (9), including methods to analyze
intratumor dose inhomogeneity. SPECT/CT images from multiple
time points were used to obtain a predictive relationship between
progression-free survival and mean tumor dose (10,11).
To not only evaluate the mean dose for a tumor, but also iden-
tify parts of the tumor receiving too-low doses, dose–volume

 histograms (DVHs) are routinely used in external-beam radiation
therapy. Voxel-based dosimetry assigning each voxel an absorbed
dose is the foundation for creating DVHs. To do this accurately
requires tracking of the radioactivity in each voxel over time,
which, for tumors subjected to deformation, can be a challenging
task. A dose–rate–volume histogram will instead depict the dose
rates in a tumor at an instant moment.
The aim of the current work was to develop dosimetric proce-
dures and establish tumor-absorbed doses for patients in the phase
1 study of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan, both on a mean tumor and
on a tumor voxel level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment
Eight patients with relapsed indolent NHL treated in the phase 1
LYMRIT-37-01 trial were included for tumor dosimetry. This study
was approved by the regional ethical committee, and all patients had
signed an informed consent form. The participants received a single
injection of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. To deplete normal B cells,
2 infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2) were given at 4 and 3 wk before
administration of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. In addition, 2 different
predosing regimes were tested; patients in arm 1 were predosed with
40 mg of unlabeled antibody (lilotomab) 4 h before injection, and
patients in arm 2 were not. 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan was admin-
istered at a fixed amount of activity per body weight (dosage level),
ranging from 10 to 20 MBq/kg (Table 1). Body surface area (BSA)
was calculated using the Dubois and Dubois method (12).
Image Acquisition and Reconstruction
All patients were imaged using a dual-head Symbia T16 SPECT/CT
scanner (Siemens), equipped with a 0.952-cm (0.375-in)-thick NaI
crystal and a medium-energy collimator. Patients in arm 1 underwent
2 SPECT/CT scans at 96 and 168 h after 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan.
Patients in arm 2 underwent 3 SPECT/CT scans at after 24, 96, and
168 h. Figure 1 shows SPECT/CT images for 1 of the patients. Energy
windows were centered at the 113- and 208-keV photon peaks with
20% window width. Two lower scatter windows with a 20% width
were used. Scans were obtained with 2 · 32 projections, each of 45-s
frame length in a noncircular orbit in step-and-shoot mode. Attenuation
and scatter corrections were performed using the vendor’s software
(Siemens Medical Esoft). An ordered-subset expectation maximiza-
tion reconstruction was used, having 4 iterations and 16 subsets and a
gaussian filtration of 4 mm. The matrix size was 128 · 128, with a
pixel size of 4.8 mm. Collimator compensation was not used. CT
scans were acquired with 30 mAs and 130-keV tube voltage. The
matrix size was 512 · 512, with 3-mm slice thickness.
Scanner Calibration and Phantom Measurements
SPECT/CT data were analyzed using the software program PMOD
(version 3.6; PMOD Industries). A calibration factor was found using
an anthropomorphic Torso Model ECT/TOR/P water-filled phantom
(Data Spectrum Corp.) containing an insertion with 106.3 MBq of
177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in 1.2 L of water. Resolution was mea-
sured by a capillary tube. A series of phantom measurements with
spheric insertions (2, 4, 8, 16, and 113 mL) was also performed. Initial
activity concentration in the spheres was 0.69 MBq/mL, with subse-
quent activity concentrations being 0.37, 0.13, and 0.03 MBq/mL.
Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn with 10- and 20-mm margins
around the sphere walls. In addition, manually defined VOIs were
drawn to include all counts seemingly originating from the spheres.
Lesion Delineation
Twenty-six tumors were included. Lesions were included on the
basis of the following criteria: visual identification of lesion on CT and
activity on SPECTas well as a minimum volume of 1.5 mL. Delineation
was primarily performed on the scan performed at 96 h. Two individual
VOIs were defined for each tumor, both drawn manually in a slice-by-slice

 manner by an experienced nuclear medicine specialist. An anatomic VOI,
VOICT, was drawn tangent to the tumor edge. A functional VOI,
VOISPECT, was drawn on the SPECT image with a manually defined
margin. These 2 VOIs were then transferred to the 168- and 24-h datasets.
Dose Calculation
The counts in VOISPECT were converted to activity. A time–activity
curve was calculated from 2 time points (3 in arm 2 for comparison) by
assuming a monoexponential clearance with an effective half-life teff.

is a dose factor
of 8.56 1025 Gykg/MBqh calculated from the OLINDA/EXM uni-
form density sphere model for a sphere of 10 g (13). The error of S for
the tumor volumes in this work is about 1%. To compare doses across
dosage levels, D was normalized by administered activity.
Voxel Dosimetry
The voxel dosimetry was performed by the local deposition method
(14). Tumors larger than 4 mL were included for voxel dosimetry, 21
tumors in total. SPECT data and the anatomic VOI were exported
from PMOD and analyzed using in-house–developed software written
in MATLAB (version 2015a; The MathWorks Inc.). The SPECT ac-
tivity data were multiplied with a dose conversion constant, based on
the assumption of 0.133 MeV of energy absorbed per disintegration.
The dose rate maps were further analyzed by constructing cumulative
dose–rate–volume histograms (cDRVHs).
Statistics
A Mann–Whitney U test was performed to investigate whether
tumor doses for arm 1 and arm 2 differed. A null-hypothesis of equal
populations with a rejection level of 0.05 was set. The relationship
between mean absorbed dose and the following parameters was in-
vestigated for tumors belonging to patients in arm 1: activity per body
weight (dosage level), total administered activity, activity per BSA,

 and tumor mass. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient with a
significance level of P less than 0.05 was used. The relationship be-
tween mean dose and dose rate covering the 10%, 50%, and 90% of
the tumor volume (D10%, D50%, and D90%, respectively) for both arms
1 and 2 was investigated using the Spearman rank test. All statistical
calculations were conducted using MATLAB version 2015a.
RESULTS
Phantom Studies and Margin-Based Quantification Method
The calibration factor was 15.9 Bq/counts, and the full width
at half maximum was 19.2 mm. The results of the phantom
acquisitions are found in Supplemental Table 1 (supplemental
materials are available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org). A 10-mm
margin generally led to an underestimation of activity and 20 mm
to an overestimation. The latter was due to contribution from the
surrounding spheres. Mean errors for manually defined margins,
the quantification method used for the patient tumors, ranged
from 23.5 to 21.3%.
Mean Tumor-Absorbed Doses
Twenty-six tumors from 8 patients were included for dosimetry
(Table 2). Interpatient variations were observed, with tumor-absorbed
doses ranging from 75 to 794 cGy across different dosage levels.
For patients included in arm 1, the mean overall tumor-absorbed
dose was 2.1 mGy/MBq (range, 0.5–5.3 mGy/MBq). The patients
in arm 2 received a mean overall tumor-absorbed dose of 2.5 mGy/
MBq (range, 0.9–5.1 mGy/MBq). There was no statistically signif-
icant difference between doses in arms 1 and 2 (P 5 0.60), in-
dicating that the 40-mg predosing did not change the tumor uptake of
177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan. For patients in the 10 MBq/kg group,
15 MBq/kg group, and 20 MBq/kg group in arm 1, the median dose
was 120, 302, and 327 cGy, respectively. For patients in the 15 MBq/kg
group in arm 2, the median dose was 259 cGy.
The tumor-absorbed dose increased significantly with the
administered activity divided by body weight (dosage level) in
arm 1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the tumor-absorbed dose did not
increase with total injected activity (Fig. 2B). Figure 2C shows
tumor-absorbed dose plotted against administered activity divided
by BSA. The tumor mass varied, with an average of 10.0 g (Table 2).
There was no statistically significant relationship between tumor-
absorbed dose and tumor mass (Fig. 3).
The largest intrapatient variation in arm 1 in absolute dose
values was found in patient 7, displaying tumor-absorbed doses
ranging from 320 to 794 cGy. Patient 13 displayed the largest
variation in arm 2. For all patients in arm 1, the intrapatient dose
ratio (the ratio between the highest and lowest tumor dose in the
patient) was larger than 2:1. For 3 of 6 patients, the same ratio was
larger than 2.5:1.
Dose–Rate–Volume Histograms
Figure 4 illustrates a dose rate map and the accompanying
cDRVH for tumor 5b. The cDRVHs for all tumors included are
shown in Figure 5. The cDRVHs differ somewhat in shape. For
example, tumor 5c shows a long plateau and a steep fall down to
zero, indicating a fairly homogeneous dose. In contrast, tumor 5a
has a more gradual decrease, indicating a larger spread in dose
rates in different parts of the tumor.
Table 3 quantifies the shape of cDRVH. The D10%, D50%, and D90%
are shown. A strong correlation was found between mean-absorbed
dose and the dose rate thresholds D10% (r 5 0.77 P , 0.0001), D50%
(r 5 0.82 P , 0.0001), and D90% (r 5 0.58 P 5 0.006).
DISCUSSION
Knowledge about tumor-absorbed dose is fundamental for the
evaluation of new ARC treatments. Here, we have calculated both
mean tumor dose and dose rate on the voxel level for a first-in-
human study of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan.
The median dose across the patient population was 264 cGy.
Even though lymphomas are radiation sensitive, this can be

 considered a relatively low radiation dose compared with doses
in external-beam radiation therapy (15). However, for other
ARCs absorbed doses of the same order of magnitude as the doses
found here have been reported. For 131I-tositumomab, the tumor
doses have ranged from 102 to 711 cGy (16). In a study that
correlated tumor-absorbed dose and progression-free survival for
131I-tositumomab treatment, a significant difference in progression-
free survival was observed when a dose threshold of 200 cGy was
used (11). This 200-cGy threshold is slightly below the estimated
median dose delivered to patients in our study. Tumor dose esti-
mates for 90Y-ibritumomab-tiuxetan were found in the range of
580–6,700 cGy in 1 study (17). There is more uncertainty around
these data, because the dosimetry was based on planar imaging of a
substitute ligand with the radionuclide 111In. However, the concept
of absorbed dose by itself is not suitable for comparing external and
internal radiation therapy or even internal emitters loaded with
different radionuclides. The differences in both physical and bi-
ologic parameters make direct evaluation of both tumor and
normal tissue–absorbed doses for 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan
somewhat challenging. Still, our results indicate that red marrow–
absorbed doses can be kept below 200 cGy with the above-mentioned
tumor-absorbed doses (18).
Correlation of tumor-absorbed dose and patient dosage level
demonstrated a significant increase in tumor dose for increasing
dosage level (Fig. 2A). This increase indicates that the chosen
dosage regime ensures higher tumor dose for increasing levels
of activity per body weight, regardless of patient shape. We also
investigated whether other dosage regimes could demonstrate bet-
ter prediction of tumor dose. Dosage with a fixed activity is known
from treatment of, for example, thyroid cancer (19) and dosage
determined by BSA adjusted activity from a study of 177Lu-DOTA-
rituximab (20). However, our results indicate that these 2 other
theoretic regimes would not deliver higher tumor-absorbed doses
if the patient dosage was increased. Although the current dosage
method (activity/body weight) seems the best suited, a rather low
r value of 0.56 for the tumor dose and patient dosage level corre-
lation may suggest that there are more optimal means for deliver-
ing this treatment.
Intrapatient variability in absorbed tumor dose was observed,
most striking in patient 13. This patient had both the minimum and
the maximum tumor-absorbed dose in the 15 MBq/kg groups
considering both arm 1 and 2. Interestingly, these 2 tumors had
almost identical size and were both located in the axillary area
contralaterally (Fig. 1). A possible explanation for the intrapatient
variability could be differences in expression of the target antigen
CD37. Another explanation may be differ-
ent vascularization, but the lack of correla-
tion between tumor dose and mass in our
study contradicts this hypothesis (Fig. 3).
In this study, quantification of radioac-
tivity uptake has been investigated using
spheres imitating lesions and larger margin-
based VOIs to allow for spill-out effects of
the imaging system and patient motion
during the long acquisitions. The results
indicate a well-functioning quantification
routine and are similar to previous results
for 177Lu (21). Quantification can alter-
natively be performed by the use of recovery
coefficients. This scheme is often chosen for
quantification of 131I because the energy of
this nuclide is higher (22) but has also been
found suited for 177Lu peptide receptor ra-
dionuclide therapy (23). Because we have
much lower activity concentration and vir-
tually no background activity, the large
VOI method was here preferred to allow
some blurring due to patient motion. Mono-
exponential activity clearance is an approxi-
mation that has been used under similar
conditions (24–26). The limited number
of data points for the tumors belonging to

 patients in arm 1 can introduce uncertainty for the time–activity
curves. Patients in arm 2 were scanned 3 times, potentially im-
proving this factor. Although the calculated dose using 2 or 3 time
points for these patients was found having a mean error of 5.5% (n 5 7,
maximum error 16%, data not shown), fit-related parameters prob-
ably introduce the larger uncertainty of this study. The mean tu-
mor dose calculation takes into account the contribution from
radiation inside the tumor, neglecting cross fire from surrounding
tissue. Use of the OLINDA-unit-sphere model for tumors has been
compared with a full Monte Carlo simulation for 131I (16). An
excellent agreement for self-dose, and good agreement when cross
fire was included, was then found. Because 177Lu has both shorter
path lengths of the electrons and considerably less cross fire, an
even better agreement is assumed.
To accurately determine DVHs, activity of the individual
voxels must be tracked between multiple time points, in analog
to the time–activity curve used in the mean tumor-absorbed dose
model. Temporal tracking has been investigated by radial deforma-
tions of tumors (10). Our dose rate maps only depict the doses at day
4, and although not providing the complete dosimetric picture, they
are neither prone to mismatched registration of maps from different
time points. Another method for voxel dosimetry has been based on
calculation of the voxel dose rates at a single time point and as-
sumption of the same activity washout for each voxel as for the
whole tumor (27). Combining the cDRVHs (Fig. 5) and the effective
half-lives (Table 2) here provides analog information. The shape of
the cDVHs would remain exactly the same as the cDRVHs and
all statistical correlations between mean dose and Dxx% identical.
Our analysis of the dose rate maps suggests that inter- and
intratumor variability exist on the voxel level. Although mean
absorbed dose values can be useful, knowledge of how this dose is
distributed must be considered before meaningful interpretations
can be made. This is especially important for response evaluation;
a high mean dose can be found whereas parts of the tumor still
receive zero absorbed dose. Here, a strong monotonic relationship
has been found between the dose rates covering 50% and 10% of
the volume and the mean absorbed doses (Table 3). If the mean
dose value is predictive of the other dose–volume parameters,
these comprehensive voxel analyses are perhaps redundant.
CONCLUSION
Dosimetric methods following the MIRD formalism for internal
emitters have been developed on 2 levels, for whole tumors
considering the mean absorbed dose and on a voxel-level using
cDRVHs. The methods correlate with each other, indicating that
one of them could be rendered redundant. Tumor-absorbed doses
increase with dosage level for patients treated with 177Lu-lilotomab
satetraxetan and are comparable to other ARCs.
