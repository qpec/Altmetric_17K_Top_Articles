Abstract
Purpose Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be associated with chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) undetected by
routine diagnostic tests. Antimicrobial therapy might confer benefit for these patients.
Materials and methods Over 10 years, we treated patients with chronic LUTS. Pyuria was adopted as the principal biomarker of
infection. Urinary leucocyte counts were recorded from microscopy of fresh midstream urine (MSU) samples. Antibiotics were
prescribed and the prescription adjusted to achieve a measurable clinical response and a reduction in pyuria.
Results We treated 624 women [mean age = 53.4 years; standard deviation (SD) = 18] with chronic LUTS and pyuria. Mean
duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 6.5 years. Only 16% of MSU cultures submitted were positive (≥105 cfu ml-1).
Mean treatment length was 383 days [SD = 347; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 337–428]. Treatment was associated with a
reduction in total LUTS (F = 98; p = 0.0001), 24-h frequency (F = 75; p = 0.0001), urinary urgency (F = 90; p = 0.0001), lower
urinary tract pain (F = 108; p = 0.0001), voiding symptoms (F = 10; p = 0.002), and pyuria (F = 15.4; p = 0.0001). Full-dose first-
generation antibiotics for UTI, such as cefalexin, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim, were combined with methenamine hippurate.
We recorded 475 adverse events (AEs) during 273,762 treatment days. There was only one serious adverse event (SAE). We
observed no increase in the proportion of resistant bacterial isolates.
Conclusion This large case series demonstrates that patients with chronic LUTS and pyuria experience symptom regression and a
reduction in urinary tract inflammation associated with antimicrobial therapy. Disease regression was achieved with a low
frequency of AEs. These results provide preliminary data to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Introduction
There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI),
undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in
the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [1, 2].
This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a
key step in every guideline concerned with the management of
LUTS [3]. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with
noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that
patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite neg-
ative tests. The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in
culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published litera-
ture points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbi-
ological analysis, in which thresholds between 103 cfu ml−1 and
106 cfu ml−1 of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are
employed to diagnose UTI [4, 5]. Dipstick urinalysis performs
equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias [6,
7]. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into
account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic var-
iability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution
due to high fluid intake before the test.
Pyuria, detected by microscopy of a fresh midstream urine
(MSU) specimen, is the most sensitive surrogate marker of UTI
[6]. It circumvents the problems associated with quantitative

 bacterial culture, and its value in the diagnosis of UTI is
recognised by international practice guidelines [8]. Whilst ≥10
wbc μl−1 is employed almost universally to diagnose UTI, con-
temporary data cast doubt on this threshold in patients with
LUTS [6, 9]. In the symptomatic patient, controlled studies
have demonstrated that lower pyuria counts of 1–9 wbc μl−1
are associated with an increase in independent inflammatory
and microbiological markers of UTI [6, 10]. Thus, lower levels
of pyuria may also indicate infection and immune activation.
The diagnostic picture has become even more complex with
the recent discovery that UTI can legitimately involve
polymicrobial infection; mixed growth cultures do not necessar-
ily reflect contamination [5, 11]. What’s more, advances in en-
hanced culture and genomics technology have revealed that even
the normal bladder is not sterile and that a bona fide, possibly
protective, urinary microbiota can be described [5, 11]. Uncertain
diagnosis is not the only area that complicates UTI management.
The treatment of acute cystitis also has its limitations. A
Cochrane review reported symptomatic and microbiological fail-
ure rates of 37 and 28% 4–10 weeks after treatment [12].
Amongst healthy young women with their first UTI, the risk of
recurrence within 6 months is 24%. If they have a history of one
or more UTIs, the risk of recurrence rises to 70% in that same
year [13]. In a Canadian surveillance study, 14% of 30,851 res-
idents with UTI experienced more than one episode during the 2-
year study period, and 2% had six or more episodes [14].
Taken together, these findings are of real concern, and whilst
guidance on the diagnosis and management of UTI is increas-
ingly prescriptive, one size does not necessarily fit all. We
hypothesise that chronic LUTS may result from urinary infection
falling below the routine culture threshold and that antibiotic
treatment could confer benefit. Indeed, Stamm et al. published
an RCT reporting success from a 10-day regimen of doxycycline
for culture-negative patients with acute frequency and dysuria
who had microscopic pyuria (using ≥8 wbc ul−1 as their thresh-
old) [15]. Further studies are needed to support these findings.
In 2004, we started to use antibiotics to treat patients with
chronic LUTS who demonstrated microscopic pyuria, despite
negative dipstick testing and negative MSU cultures employing
a 105 cfu ml−1 threshold. Using sensitive microbiological
methods, we have since generated data demonstrating wide-
spread bacterial infection in these patients [1]. Other groups have
also reported similar findings [4]. Our clinical approach sought to
manage patients towards symptom resolution and clearance of
pyuria by combining antibiotic treatment with careful outpatient
monitoring. This paper describes the evolution of our clinical
practice as a result of these observations.
Methods
These data represent a large case series of women treated in a
single tertiary centre from 2004 to 2014. All women with
chronic LUTS and pyuria ≥1 wbc μl−1 who agreed to antibi-
otic therapy provided symptom and urinalysis data. This
group included patients with existing diagnoses of overactive
bladder (OAB), bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis
(BPS/IC), voiding symptoms, and recurrent UTI (rUTI).
Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was a common nondomi-
nant symptom but was not a therapeutic target for antibiotic
treatment. All patients presenting underwent a standardised
clinical assessment. Demographic data, medical comorbidities
and concurrent medication were recorded, together with de-
tails of previous treatments, in our electronic patient database.
LUTS was characterised using a 39-question inventory devel-
oped and validated at this centre [16] (Table 1); urinary urgen-
cy and lower urinary tract pain subscales were validated as
independent measures [17, 18]. Microscopic pyuria was enu-
merated from a freshly collected clean-catch MSU specimen,
which was submitted for routine culture employing a ≥ 105 cfu
ml−1 diagnostic threshold. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was
conducted on all bacterial isolates.
Antibiotic therapy was not contingent on positive dip-
stick urinalysis or routine MSU cultures. As previously
described, these tests are insufficiently sensitive to ex-
clude UTI and were not used to arbitrate treatment deci-
sions. Results of MSU culture were used to monitor bac-
terial resistance rates only. Written information was pro-
vided explaining the justification for treatment, expected
clinical outcomes and potential adverse effects. Patients
understood that they were being treated outside of stan-
dard guidelines. The clinical lead for the unit took sole
responsibility for all off-label prescribing.
The assessments conducted at presentation were repeated
at every follow-up visit. Duration of follow-up was variable,
as treatment response dictated the number of review visits. All
data, up to the point of patient discharge, was included in the
analysis. The Patient Global Impression of Improvement
(PGI-I) scale was used to measure treatment response [19,
20]. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at every patient
interaction and graded using the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE), version 4.3. Clinical
management evolved during the study period. Treatment was
initiated with first-line antibiotics used for UTI, including
nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim and cefalexin. Patients were
reviewed for response at 14 days, or earlier if AEs were en-
countered. Treatment modifications were tailored to efficacy
and tolerance [21]. The urinary antiseptic agent methenamine
hippurate was used as an adjunct, and some patients required
combination antibiotic therapy. Wherever possible, we tried to
forge our observations into useful amendments of these
personalised regimens.
An effective, tolerated treatment was continued until symp-
toms were ameliorated and the inflammatory response in urine
had resolved. Treatment was then discontinued. If the symp-
toms recurred, treatment was reinstated. This cycle was
1036

 repeated until there was no symptomatic deterioration after
antibiotic withdrawal for 12 weeks. At this point, patients
were asked to initiate short-course, self-start antibiotic treat-
ment at the first sign of any recurrence of symptoms which
was identical to the self-start regimens recommended for
rUTI. Symptom-based antimicrobial treatment, introduced
early in the infection cycle, was advocated to prevent chronic
symptom recurrence [22].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 22
(IBM, NY, New York, USA). Changes in outcome variables
were analysed using a mixed-models, linear regression analy-
sis within a repeated measures design. The time interval from
first attendance at each clinic visit varied between patients,
and intervals could vary for individual patients. To address
this, the effect of the number of days from first attendance
was controlled in all models involving multiple attendances.
Time from first visit was entered as a covariate, accounting for
patient-specific random effects. Data were indexed by patient
and visit number using a main effects model and random
intercept. Ordinal regression was used to analyse PGI-I re-
sponses recorded on the last visit only. Comparison of non-
parametric data used the Kruskall–Wallis or Mann–Whitney
U tests.
Ethical approval
Validated symptom and biomarker data were collected in ac-
cordance with a protocol approved by the East Central
London Regional Ethics Committee (REC1) (Ref: 11/
H0721/7).
Results
Patients
A total of 1996 women presented to the clinical service be-
tween 2004 and 2014: 433 attended just once for urodynamic
studies or urinalysis, and these patients were neither treated in
the centre nor followed up. A further 444 women were treated
for OAB and did not demonstrate pyuria or presented with
SUI as their only symptom. These women were not treated
with antibiotics. After these exclusions, 624 women [mean
age = 53.4 years; standard deviation (SD) = 18] who demon-
strated pyuria ≥1 wbc μl−1 at presentation were included in the
analysis.
Patients described longstanding LUTS prior to their referral
to this service (mean duration = 6.5 years; SD = 6.3). Many
women had an established diagnosis of OAB or BPS/IC from
elsewhere. Urinary urgency symptoms were described by
73% of women, whilst voiding symptoms and lower urinary
tract pain affected 71% and 65%, respectively; 43% of women
described SUI. Patient demographics and symptoms are
summarised in Table 2.

 Dipstick and urine culture
We performed 1988 dipstick analyses: 558 (28%) demonstrat-
ed trace or greater leucocyte esterase; 138 (7%) were nitrite
positive. However, 1433 (72%) of these samples showed py-
uria on direct microscopy. Of the 2209 MSU cultures per-
formed during observation, only 362 (16%) were positive
using the threshold of ≥105 cfu ml−1, although microscopic
pyuria was recorded in 1741 (79%) of these samples.
Antibiotic use
Our prescribing practice evolved over the course of the obser-
vation period as we scrutinised our treatment–response data.
This led to treatment regimens being simplified and refined as
data were collected. In 2014, when data collection ceased,
80% of patients were being treated with 12 antibacterial reg-
imens. Six of these consisted of methenamine hippurate com-
bined with one antibiotic, most commonly a first-generation
antimicrobial such as cefalexin, nitrofurantoin or trimetho-
prim. Full-dose treatment was administered. We identified a
cluster of patients with marked urethral pain and low-level
pyuria whose symptoms preferentially responded to
macrolide or tetracycline, perhaps suggestive of a fastidious
microorganism.
Treatment duration and efficacy
We tested the need for ongoing treatment empirically by stop-
ping antimicrobial therapy. Treatment cessation was permitted
once any reduction in LUTS had reached a steady state and
pyuria had cleared. If symptoms recurred, the occurrence was
documented and treatment reinstated. Thus, we stopped treat-
ment 858 times and restarted 633 (74%) times on recurrence.
Amongst patients with pain symptoms, relapses were associ-
ated with significantly higher pain scores (mean = 4.2; 95%
CI = 3.6–4.9) compared with their symptoms at the beginning
of treatment (mean = 2.7; 95% CI = 2.2–3.2) (p = 0.001).
Two hundred and twenty-five women completed treatment
and were discharged. The median number of patient visits was
five (mean = 6.6; SD = 5), with 40% of women discharged
after four visits and 80% within ten. Mean treatment length
was 383 days, with a significant variation in duration
(SD = 347; 95% CI = 337–428). Some patients required
long-term therapy, as attempts to withdraw treatment were
associated with relapse. Others were treated successfully but
requested long-term monitoring due to anxieties about disease
recurrence.
Figure 1 shows a plot of 24-h urinary frequency, total
LUTS and pyuria at time points (A) baseline, (B) three sub-
sequent review visits, (C) optimum state on treatment and (D)
discharge. There was a significant reduction in 24-h urinary
frequency (F = 75; p = 0.0001), total LUTS (F = 98;
p = 0.0001) and log10 pyuria (F = 15.4; p = 0.0001).
Incontinence episodes did not change significantly (F = 1.8;
p = .18). Optimum treatment-associated effects amongst pa-
tients who were not discharged are represented by data at time
point (C).
Separate analyses demonstrating the change in individual
symptom subscales associated with treatment are presented in
Fig. 2. Antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant
reduction in urinary urgency (F = 90; p = 0.0001), lower
urinary tract pain (F = 108; p = 0.0001) and voiding symptoms
(F = 10; p = 0.002). Symptoms of SUI were unchanged during
treatment (F = 1.4; p = 0.24) (Table 3).
The PGI-I responses demonstrated a significant improve-
ment over the treatment period (χ2 = 2272; df = 5; p = 0.001);
84% of women rated their condition as much better (20%) or
very much better (64%). These data demonstrate that long-
term antibiotic treatment is associated with resolution of
chronic LUTS and pyuria, which is an independent surrogate
marker of infection. These findings were accompanied by
PGI-I responses indicating that most patients perceived these
symptomatic improvements to be clinically meaningful.
Plots of pyuria and symptoms in individual patients for
each visit showed a typical response pattern in 73% of cases,

 termed a damped oscillation (Fig. 3). This features a series of
oscillations of decreasing amplitude; 10% of patients demon-
strated the converse, and this was associated with symptom-
atic deterioration. Ten per cent showed a rapid, uninterrupted
fall to baseline (critically damped oscillation) and 7% were
unclassifiable.
Baseline variables of age, duration of symptoms, urinary
frequency/incontinence and pyuria did not predict treatment
outcome. Higher pain scores at presentation were predictive of
greater maximal symptom palliation associated with antibiotic
therapy (b = 0.57, p = 0.029). Higher scores for urinary ur-
gency (b = 1.1, p = 0.001) and voiding symptoms (b = 1.0,

 p = 0.005) predicted less favourable responses, although the
magnitude of these effects was small.
Adverse events
Two hundred and sixty-six patients reported 475 AEs during
273,762 treatment days. Except one, all AEs were classified as
mild or moderate (CTC AE grades 1–2). A change in antibi-
otic was instituted in all cases. AEs are listed by system in
Table 4 with the CTC AE grading definitions.
To our knowledge, the only SAE (CTC-AE grade 3) was an
eosinophilic pneumonitis associated with the use of
nitrofurantoin. A patient with severe LUTS, only ameliorated
by nitrofurantoin, was exposed intermittently to the drug over
8 years, with numerous attempts at cessation and use of alter-
natives. She developed a sudden eosinophilic pneumonitis
with some fibrosis. Six cases of Clostridium-difficile-toxin-
positive diarrhoea and one case of diarrhoea expressing
C.difficile antigen was seen during treatment. All were treated
as outpatients. Seven patients with a history of C. difficile
diarrhoea were managed without recurrence. No other AEs
were recorded.
Antibiotic resistance
We analysed data from all 362 positive MSU cultures. The
median number of antibiotics to which the isolate was resis-
tant remained at one over all visits [interquartile range (IQR)
0–2 for visits one and two, and 0–3 for the third and subse-
quent visits). These differences were not significant (Kruskal–
Wallis χ2 = 2.5; df = 3; p = 0.47). These data demonstrate that
long-term antibiotic use, as practiced using our methods, does

Discussion
Our clinical experience over a decade with a large cohort of
patients demonstrates the promise that antibiotic therapy may
hold for treating symptoms previously ascribed to a noninfec-
tious aetiology. In the process, it strengthens the hypothesis
that UTI might be implicated in the generation of chronic
LUTS. In 2008, it was estimated that nearly 45% of the
world’s population were affected by LUTS, and this is expect-
ed to increase as our population ages. Urinary urgency incon-
tinence affects 15–22% of people in the USA [23], with a
staggering estimated cost of US$76 billion annually. If even
a fraction of these patients have a treatable bacterial aetiology,
their care might be transformed.
The principal limitation of this work is that it represents an
evolution of clinical practice rather than an intervention study.
This has generated a treatment protocol that now requires
testing in a randomised trial. Definitive conclusions regarding
efficacy need to be corroborated in future work, although the
treatment appears to be safe. Assuming any treatment effect is
real, these data raise the question of whether the reduction in
LUTS associated with antimicrobial therapy is clinically
significant.
Our PGI-I data point strongly to the overall reduction in
LUTS, conferring a meaningful improvement for patients.
Furthermore, relief of urinary urgency exceeded the minimal
clinically important difference (MCID) described for the ur-
gency subscale of our LUTS questionnaire [24]. Whilst no
MCID has been defined for the lower urinary tract pain sub-
scale of the instrument, the mean number of pain symptoms
fell from 3.2 to 0.4, which is likely to be clinically significant.
Whether the reduction in voiding symptoms amongst patients
was of clinical importance is difficult to determine. The reduc-
tion in 24-h urinary frequency associated with treatment was
significantly greater than that conferred by antimuscarinic
medication in patients with OAB [5]. Twenty-four-hour uri-
nary incontinence episodes did not change significantly, but
baseline incontinence frequency was too low to expect a de-
tectable change associated with treatment.
Outcome data were not generated within a study, and
no formal control group is available for comparison.
Nonetheless, SUI symptoms amongst patients exposed to
treatment targeting other LUTS did not change. Given our
understanding of the pathophysiology of SUI, we would
not expect antibiotic treatment to influence these symp-
toms. These data provide a positive control group. In ad-
dition, our centre has collected urinary biomarker data
from control individuals in prospective research studies
with 12-month follow-up [25, 26]. Thirty-six women
(mean age = 45.5 years; SD = 11.4) were included as
controls in these studies, providing monthly MSU sam-
ples for analysis. Median pyuria expression during
follow-up was zero. Statistical comparison of these con-
trol data with patient data presented here demonstrates
higher levels of pyuria expression amongst patients than
controls across all time points (F = 39; p = 0.0001).
Demographic variables and disease chronicity did not pre-
dict outcome in association with antibiotic therapy, and many
of the baseline symptom scores did not demonstrate any pre-
dictive properties. Greater urinary urgency and frequency
were predictors of less favourable outcomes, although param-
eter estimates suggest that their utility in clinical practice
would be questionable. Higher pain scores at baseline did
predict a greater reduction in overall symptoms associated
with treatment. If this is a genuine finding, it may hint that
pain, a central feature of the inflammatory response, is a mark-
er of infective, treatable pathology in these patients.

 We tried to minimise treatment duration, but symptom re-
lapse associated with a return of pyuria often necessitated
further treatment cycles. As our treatment strategy evolved,
we focused on first-generation, narrow-spectrum antibiotics
at maximum dose, combined with methenamine hippurate,
guided by changes in symptoms and urine microscopy.
Methenamine has a general bactericidal effect in the urinary
tract, suppressing bacterial growth without selecting for resis-
tant microbes. These choices are likely to generate less bacte-
rial resistance than using conventional antibiotics alone. Our
resistance data would seem to support this approach.
Symptom control usually required the maximum toler-
ated dose of an antibiotic and, in some patients, more than
one drug. This reality is not surprising given what we now
know about host/pathogen interactions in rUTI.
Polymicrobial infections are not unusual [5]. Given that
genomic and other more modern approaches began to re-
veal bacterial diversity in this patient population [2], an-
tibiotics targeting fastidious organisms were also intro-
duced. In addition, several common uropathogens, includ-
ing Enterococcus faecalis [27], Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae
and Salmonella enterica, are known to invade urothelial
cells and form intracellular bacterial communities [28].
Such reservoirs may be resistant to antibiotics present in
the lumen, as many such drugs are not cell-permeant. This
means that any sequestered bacteria are free to emerge
later to reinitiate infection. The deeper layers of the blad-
der mucosa may harbour bacterial reservoirs, and cell
turnover is slow. Uropathogens can also form biofilms
that elaborate a polymeric capsule, conferring intrinsic
antibiotic resistance. Most bacteria within these biofilms
divide little, thereby failing to express a therapeutic target
for most antimicrobial drugs [29]. These insights might
account for the protracted treatment periods required to
achieve disease regression. Recurrent relapse, experienced
by some patients in association with antimicrobial with-
drawal, might be explained by similar mechanisms. The
failure of some patients to tolerate antimicrobial with-
drawal represents a significant clinical challenge that
needs to be addressed in future work.
It is worth noting that intracellular reservoirs and biofilms
clinging to shed urothelial cells are unlikely to be recovered
during routine MSU culture. This test samples very small
volumes of urine supernatant (typically 1–10 µl), whereas
infected cells settle quickly to the bottom of sample tubes.
Our laboratory and others [1, 11] have found that enhanced
collection methods involving collecting sediment via centri-
fugation provide the necessary sensitivity.
The damped oscillations in pyuria demonstrated by most
patients under treatment in this study suggest that antibiotic
inhibition in the lower urinary tract is partial. Damped oscil-
lations are seen in systems in which the retarding force, in this
case antimicrobial therapy, is smaller than the force it opposes
[30]. The damped oscillator and long treatment periods need-
ed support the use of maximum antibiotic doses. These oscil-
lations also argue against our results being explained by sim-
ple regression to the mean.
In summary, the evolved treatment strategy is as follows:
UTI diagnosis [7] rests on symptoms, signs and microscopic
pyuria. Without the latter, we do not initiate antibiotic treat-
ment. We combine methenamine hippurate with a first-gener-
ation, narrow-spectrum antibiotic against urinary infection to
find a tolerated regime that mediates a symptomatic response
and a reduction in pyuria. If urethral pain and dysuria are
prominent, macrolides and tetracyclines are favoured. We
continue treatment until symptom control is optimal and py-
uria has cleared before trialling treatment withdrawal. More
than one cycle is frequently required to achieve lasting symp-
tom resolution.
We provide all patients who have completed their treatment
with a short course of first-generation antibiotic used for uri-
nary infection that can be self-initiated at the very first hint of
symptom resurgence. Patients are advised to take 3–7 days of
antimicrobial treatment, dependening on how quickly the new
symptoms settle, and this approach is advocated to prevent
chronic symptoms reasserting themselves after an acute infec-
tion. In the medium term, this approach seems to be effective,
although we have yet to collect data on the long-term success
of this strategy.
Given these data, an RCT is the next logical step. We be-
lieve that the correct design should be a comparative trial of
the management protocol evolved here against treatment stip-
ulated by current guidelines. We hope that these data will help
in the design of future studies.
