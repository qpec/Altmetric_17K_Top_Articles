Introduction: Black men are diagnosed with prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate of white men
and are underrepresented in prostate cancer research, including validation studies of new clinical
tools (e.g., genomic testing). Because healthcare system mistrust has contributed to these disparities
for centuries, black men may be less inclined to pursue novel testing, and identification of facilita-
tors to their participation in prostate cancer research studies remains warranted.
Methods: A community-engaged approach involving a partnership with a community organiza-
tion was used to conduct seven focus groups in Minnesota, Alabama, and California to explore
black men’s attitudes toward prostate cancer research participation and genomic testing for pros-
tate cancer. Data were collected and analyzed from April 2015 to April 2017.
Results: Identified genomic testing barriers included a lack of terminology understanding, health-
care system mistrust, reluctance to seek medical care, and unfavorable attitudes toward research.
Facilitators included family history, value of prevention, and the desire for health education. Lack of
prostate cancer knowledge, prostate-specific antigen testing confusion, healthcare system distrust,
and misuse of personal health information were barriers to research study participation. Some black
men were motivated to participate in research if it was seen as constructive and transparent.
Conclusions: Disparities for black men can both motivate and disincentivize participation
depending upon a positive or negative view of research. Confusion over prostate cancer clinical
care has fueled some mistrust among black men affecting both clinical care and research participa-
tion. With increased education, health literacy, and assurances of research integrity and transpar-
ency, black men may be more willing to participate in prostate cancer testing and research.

 INTRODUCTION
P
rostate cancer (PCa) remains the third leading
cause of cancer death in American men.1 Black
men are diagnosed with and die from PCa at
nearly twice the rate of white men.1 PCa is most com-
monly diagnosed through the prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) blood test, which discriminates poorly between
clinically significant and insignificant disease. Current
clinical tools have limited ability to provide the risk
assessment needed for men to make informed treatment
decisions. Recently available genomic tests (e.g., Onco-
type DX, Prolaris, Decipher), run on prostate cancer
tissue,2�4 can help decide appropriateness for active sur-
veillance or timing of salvage therapies. Although black
men
may
benefit
from
personalized
approaches
enhanced by genomic testing, little is known about their
willingness to accept such testing.
Despite the increased disease burden borne by blacks,
they remain underrepresented in PCa clinical trials.5,6
For example, less than 50% of U.S. PCa RCTs performed
between 1991 and 2015 reported black male enrollment.6
Black men have previously reported higher levels of dis-
trust of clinical research and healthcare systems because
of the impact of past clinical research abuses (e.g., the
Tuskegee Syphilis Study).7 Thus, “new” tests/treatments
that may improve risk stratification and target therapies
could be met with resistance, possibly increasing PCa
outcomes disparities among blacks.8 The twofold pur-
pose of this study is to explore barriers and facilitators
of: (1) genomic testing for PCa in black men, and (2)
black men’s participation in PCa research to provide a
framework to design future PCa outcomes disparity
research.
METHODS
Study Population
Black community members/stakeholders were recruited in Min-
neapolis, Minnesota; Birmingham, Alabama; and Sacramento and
Oakland, California, to participate in focus groups (FGs). Partici-
pants were recruited by a variety of methods at different sites,
including through clinical practices, meetings of the 100 Black
Men of America, and word of mouth through a community
agency. Eligible participants were adults, aged >18 years, who
self-identified as black or expressed interest in PCa among black
men. Women were included due to their influence over family
members’ (i.e., spouse’s) health; non-blacks were included to allow
non-black spouses of black men to participate.
Seven 90-minute FGs were held (two each in Minneapolis, Bir-
mingham, and Oakland; one in Sacramento) with 2�15 partici-
pants, each facilitated by one team member (a black male with a
PhD). Four FGs (n=39) focused on barriers to and facilitators of
PCa genomic testing in black men. Three FGs (n=17) explored
attitudes toward black men’s participation in PCa research. Partic-
ipants were incentivized with refreshments and a $20 gift card.
The IRBs of the University of Minnesota, University of Alabama
at Birmingham, and University of California, Davis, approved this
study.
Measures
Before each FG, participants completed a brief anonymous demo-
graphic questionnaire. A semi-structured interview guide was
developed to achieve the study purpose. Two sets of FG questions
addressed both uptake of genomic testing and attitudes toward
PCa research.
Statistical Analysis
All FGs were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed between April
2015 and April 2017. De-identified data were analyzed using
NVivo, version 11. Investigators used the social constructivist
approach to Grounded Theory to identify study themes.9 Two
investigators independently read and annotated the transcripts to
identify thematic structures among the data. Double coding of
two FGs aided in codebook development, revealing major themes
that were used to annotate the remaining five transcripts.
Research team conferencing on the emerging analysis provided
further validation of the design’s rigor. Researchers resolved dis-
crepancies by consensus. The sample’s demographic information
was summarized using Stata, version 14.
RESULTS
Fifty-six unique participants met inclusion criteria. Par-
ticipants’ mean age was 55 years and 18 (38%) reported
previously having PCa (Table 1).
Barriers to Genomic Testing
Most participants stated they had heard of genetic test-
ing, but most were unfamiliar with genomic testing.
When asked to provide words or definitions describing
the terms genetics and genomics, numerous participants
stated the environment affects one’s genomic makeup;
others questioned whether genomics was related to race
and ethnicity, and genomics was of more concern than
genetics. One participant stated the words “genomic
testing” reminded him of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study
(Table 2-A).
Participants were more familiar with the term genet-
ics, stating that it described how an individual might
inherit certain traits or conditions. Participants com-
monly used the terms genomic and genetic interchange-
ably, suggesting a belief that undergoing genomic testing
may reveal heritable traits. At the end of this discussion
topic, participants were given the following definitions:
(1) genetic testing refers to testing of genetic material
that can be passed on to future generations, and (2)
genomic testing refers to testing genetic material that
will not be passed on to future generations.
Participants described mixed experiences with health-
care providers. For some, this mistrust generalized to the
healthcare system, including the medical profession. For

 others, the potential for providers to gain financially by
writing prescriptions or ordering tests undermined the
provider�patient relationship (Table 2-B). Other partic-
ipants expressed concerns about hidden agendas work-
ing
against
blacks,
possibly
reflecting
broader
experiences of racism and historic abuse. This mistrust
extended to how findings or test results might be used
and by whom. One participant was concerned this infor-
mation could influence blacks’ ability to obtain health
insurance or access care and was a disincentive for test-
ing (Table 2-C).
Some participants identified lack of health insur-
ance as a reason blacks do not undergo genetic or
genomic testing. Other participants described black
men as reluctant to seek health care until they have
symptoms, as going to the doctor was seen as weak
or admitting to pain or discomfort would appear
unmanly (Table 2-D).
A variety of attitudes were reported pertaining to par-
ticipant willingness to undergo genetic or genomic test-
ing in a research setting. One participant, for example,
believed black men have no interest in research because
participation does not affect them immediately or
directly. Another stated that cancer research is unsuc-
cessful because people continue to die of cancer, suggest-
ing treatments are inadequate and unsafe (Table 2-E).
Other participants, however, expressed more supportive
attitudes about cancer research, emphasizing its positive
implications, such as determining causation and finding
cures. Others perceived blacks as having a greater genetic

 predisposition to diseases and therefore valued research
as important for the black community.
Facilitators of Genomic Testing
Despite their unfamiliarity with genetic and genomic
testing, participants said they would recommend family
members undergo testing if doing so would detect PCa.
Participants also described the important role of family
history as a facilitator of engagement in genomic testing
for PCa. Those who had had PCa themselves or knew of
it in their family valued the idea of testing (Table 2-F).
Despite mistrust of medical testing and practice, many
participants stated that they valued the opportunity to
receive preventive care for themselves and their families
and to learn of inherited conditions among offspring.
Others stated that early detection could save lives and
expressed support for testing both for themselves and
their families (Table 2-G). Participants stated that posi-
tive relationships with providers were helpful for making
decisions about testing, and having more black providers
would help to encourage greater medical care engage-
ment (Table 2-H).
An additional theme across FGs was a desire for edu-
cation about PCa and genomic testing. Many partici-
pants expressed a strong desire for community-wide,
multigenerational education about the value of preven-
tive health care. Participants believed education starting
early in life would help reduce PCa fear and be more
useful than promoting testing (Table 2-I). Others noted
that the education they received following a PCa diagno-
sis helped them deal with their own disease and was use-
ful to share with others (Table 2-J).
Prostate Cancer Research Participation Barriers
Healthcare system mistrust was the most common rea-
son given for lack of PCa research participation. Partici-
pants in all geographic regions expressed this sentiment.
Participants expressed concern over historic abuses of
black men in research, namely, the Tuskegee experi-
ments. Participants also expressed feelings of fear and

Participant quotes
A. Lack of understanding of
the terminology
“. . .I’m trying to think of all the testing that they did on African American black men . . . when they
gave them syphilis. . .What was the purpose? What was the outcome to be? . . . Genomics could
be something . . . Is it private? Is it something that’s industrial that . . . we all could be able to look
up and check out? (Sacramento male participant)
B. Healthcare system mistrust
“ . . . It seems like people are just trying to get our money...Run all sorts of tests so they can get paid.
This stuff is expensive.” (Alabama male participant)
C. Healthcare system mistrust
“My concern would be to have it used in a way that would deny you something. . . . I think that’s
something that hangs over people’s heads. If I’m predisposed to have cancer, would that cost me
a medical coverage?” (Oakland male participant)
D. Reluctance to seek
medical care
“There was a time when it was thought if you went to the doctor you would have been a sissy. You’re
supposed to man up, take a little pain . . . .That’s why I don’t know that much about certain
generations of my family because no one ever said anything.” (Sacramento male participant)
E. Unfavorable attitudes
toward research
“For 100 years they have been trying to get a cure for cancer....The new forms of cancer are more
aggressive so you have more people dying even with all this research. . . . So, what is the problem?
If you are doing all this research why is it such an elusive enemy?” (Alabama male participant)
F. Family history
“Because my family has a history of it from my grandfather on down, soon as I found out, I called
everybody in my family. I said I want all the guys tested.” (Sacramento male participant)
G. Value of prevention
“ . . . I’ve learned that early detection saves lives. If there is something that is capable of killing me
and I have got the capability of doing something about it, then I have got to check and do it.”
(Alabama male participant)
H. Value of prevention
“ . . . I think black people . . . need to be able to see the person themselves because then they can see
themselves in that person. So, to me, that’s how you can get them more interested, not only in
medicine, but interested in going to seek out help.” (Minneapolis male participant)
I. Desire for health education
“Because it’s such a personal topic, and it’s very scary, the closer you get to 50 and beyond . . . .I
would like to educate . . . people in my family or people that I have influence over at a younger
age, like 30, so that they can get used to . . . some of the language and the fact that . . . education
is going to allow you . . . that time to get rid of some of that fear.” (Sacramento male participant)
J. Desire for health education
“For me being diagnosed with PCa was a turning event . . . and I think the more education I had
earlier on the more I was able to cope with it better and therefore I was able to communicate about
my PCa on a more intelligent level. I think education is really the key to getting you in the door at the
doctor’s office to talk about what the risk factors are, how to control it, how to manage it and how
to cope with it. Even though you have had it and every year I get my prostate test.” (Minneapolis
male participant)

 distrust extending from research to general mistrust of
the medical system (Table 3-A).
Many participants expressed a distrust of health-
care providers, whom they saw as unknowledgeable
or nontransparent (Table 3-B) because of confusion
stemming from recent changes in PCa screening
guidelines. Other participants stated that the relation-
ship with their provider could help build trust, but
that having a black doctor was insufficient. Partici-
pants indicated that mistrust goes beyond an individ-
ual
physician
to
the
healthcare
system
at
large
(Table 3-C).
Some participants expressed fear of participation in
research as fear of being treated “. . . like a guinea
pig,” whereas others expressed deeper mistrust, sug-
gesting researchers held sinister motives for wanting
to involve black men in research (Table 3-D). In
addition
to
personal-harm
concerns,
participants
expressed apprehension about the use of gathered
personal information that might be hacked or used
by third parties, such as insurance companies, to later
deny the participants insurance or services.
Prostate Cancer Research Participation Facilitators
Some participants said PCa research participation could
be positive when conducted transparently, with a clear
agenda, and with nothing “sneaky” being done to sub-
jects (Table 3-E). Participants also voiced how receiving
their personal results from a research study would help
dispel suspicions of deception (Table 3-F).
Participants also described PCa disparities as a moti-
vation for participation in PCa research. Recognition of
the higher mortality rates for blacks than whites and a
desire to identify the causes of these disparities were par-
ticularly important motivators (Table 3-G).
Participants identified prevention and screening/early
detection as the most important priorities for future PCa
research. Participants were very interested in the effects
of diet, lifestyle, and environmental toxins on PCa
Table 3. Participant Quotes From Focus Groups on PCa Research
Theme
Participant quotes
A. Healthcare system
mistrust
“That is a tricky subject because of the Tuskegee study. There is a lot of history that doesn’t favor. It
makes you extremely cautious to participate in studies.” (Alabama male participant)
“Tuskegee has crippled this community in many ways. Young folks don’t know about that, but many
people my age know about the study. That creates some fear.” (Minnesota male participant)
“You know the thing that I, that happened. . .they gave all these guys syphilis. That has been a black
mark on the medical society and the relationship with African Americans, especially men, and it has
not changed in terms of being able to be trustworthy for doctors.” (Sacramento male participant)
B. Patient-provider
relationship
“They’re telling me you don’t need it, you don’t need a PSA. So now they are automatically telling
me you’re going to die. If I don’t get a PSA and find out that I got prostate cancer, what are they
telling me? That there is no other way to detect it, but I don’t need it? So now you know why black
people don’t want to go to the doctor.” (Minneapolis male participant)
C. Patient-provider
relationship
“I think that in the black community, there’s a couple things going on. But one of them is that, you
know, we have a justifiable mistrust for the healthcare system, and I think that, even with a lot of
education, there still is a mistrust about going into the doctors and seeing this white doctor. You know,
and I think that, even if we have a black doctor, we still look at these institutions as white institutions.”
(Oakland male participant)
D. Fear
“I just find that, just honestly in my heart, I just believe that the issue of cancer is, is one that probably
was settled back in the 40s, and it just has not been uh revealed to the public uh as we’re you know
designed for whatever they wanna do, and I just think there’s been so much manipulation of
information, that uh we just, we just really don’t know who is lying and who is not. And uh, I mean
after a hundred years, I mean this is the only disease that we’re no closer to curing than it was when
we started.” (Alabama male participant)
E. Transparent process
“I do not have any problem with that. If it is true constructive research done by doctors with integrity
then I don’t have a problem with it. Without research then we are not going to find out about it. We
need to have some testing.” (Alabama male participant)
F. Transparent process
“I would like the results. I would also want to know if it helped. I am not hostile towards researchers,
but I am hostile towards deception. I will always be hostile towards deception. If we aren’t going to
discuss it openly and truthfully then there is no point in the discussion.” (Alabama male participant)
G. Additional facilitators
and research priorities
“You all should be interested because it’s killing us. It’s killing us faster than everybody else. And they
don’t know why. You know, that’s my whole thing. Because I would love to know why, but they said,
they just don’t know why.” (Minneapolis male participant)
H. Additional facilitators
and research priorities
“Absolutely we should participate because it’s too prevalent. And it’s treatable if it gets caught early
enough. The consequences of not doing that are too severe.” (Sacramento male participant)

 development. Continuing research on PCa screening was
discussed frequently (Table 3-H).
DISCUSSION
Compared with their white counterparts, black men are
approximately twice as likely to be diagnosed with, and
die from, PCa. Novel precision medicine approaches,
including genomic testing, offer the potential to
improve patient PCa outcomes, including appropriate
selection of men for observation, timing of salvage
radiation therapy,10 and prediction of drug response.11
Yet recruitment to government initiatives, such as the
“All of Us” precision medicine research program,
remains a challenge despite efforts to partner with
black faith-based groups to increase minority partici-
pation.12,13 There is concern that lack of black partici-
pation
in
such
research
may
exacerbate
health
disparities. Accordingly, this qualitative study probed
attitudes
toward
PCa
genomic
testing
and
PCa
research in a geographically diverse sample of black
men and community stakeholders. These findings may
be applicable beyond PCa to black men’s participation
in medical research generally.
The current study’s findings expand on previous stud-
ies demonstrating lower consent rates for genetic-varia-
tion research among blacks compared with other ethnic
groups14 by examining minority-male perceptions of
genomic testing. Past research15,16 has addressed the
effectiveness of genomic testing with little attempt to dis-
sect behavioral predictors of testing uptake among eth-
nic subpopulations. Although research on the issue is
scant, this study’s findings mirror reported notions that
hesitancy about genomic testing participation may stem
from lack of knowledge rather than from the procedure
itself.17,18 Study participants used the terms genomics
and genetics interchangeably and expressed concern
about how others may use such genetic information
(heritable traits). Participants did not appreciate the ben-
efits of the results of genomic tests (i.e., not revealing
information about heritable traits), raising the question
whether misunderstanding of the terms (i.e., genomic
versus genetic testing and which test reveals information
about heritable traits) could influence acceptance of
such testing. Considering the extant-literature emphasis
on patient education to improve health literacy19,20 and
the interest expressed by this study’s participants in
becoming
better
educated
about
genomic
testing,
improvement of patient-centered education is essential.
Decision aids have been shown to effectively provide
concise education about complex medical issues, includ-
ing PSA testing,21,22 and could possibly be applied to
genomic testing.
Blacks are generally reluctant to participate in medical
research, including PCa-centered studies, despite the dis-
proportionate burden of PCa borne by black men.5,23�27
Durant et al.28 found 21% of black men distrusted clinical
research, compared with 7% of whites. Published reasons
for lack of participation include significant levels of
healthcare-system mistrust because of: (1) general experi-
ences with racism/discrimination, (2) previous treatment
within the healthcare system, and (3) previous research
abuses within the black community.7,29�31 The current
study suggests that healthcare system mistrust continues
to be a reason many black men do not seek care and have
negative feelings toward research. Although the “Tuske-
gee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male” ended
46 years ago, its history continues to haunt the minds of
many black men and influence their healthcare decisions.
Consequently, a clear need exists to address historic
healthcare-system mistrust in all generations of black
men. Because roughly six in ten PCas are diagnosed in
men aged 65 years or older,32 these older men may be
particularly subject to this “Tuskegee effect,” posing a
unique problem for PCa-related treatment and research
involving black men. Hoffman and colleagues33 however,
recently reported on a community outreach approach
with potential for bridging the trust gap and increasing
community-wide health literacy among blacks.
Although current study participants echoed some pre-
viously menitoned barriers to PCa research participa-
tion, dichotomous feelings were identified, fueled by a
concern for PCa disparities among black men. Partici-
pants who deeply mistrusted research saw PCa dispar-
ities among black men as a rationale for their mistrust,
believing research was a possible contributor. However,
individuals with a neutral or favorable view of research
perceived disparities as motivators to participate. It may
be important to acknowledge both sets of concerns,
emphasizing different motivating factors to maximize
black men’s research participation.
Previous researchers identified several facilitators of
blacks’ clinical research participation, including provid-
ing safety assurances and reporting results to partici-
pants.29,34 Similarly, this study’s participants expressed a
desire to receive their personal results from research test-
ing. Although individual results from research studies
are generally not provided, affording this information to
black men may demonstrate transparency and improve
trust, thus facilitating future participation. Provision of
such results would need to be accompanied by a careful
explanation, emphasizing their limitations.
One important study finding was community-mem-
ber insight for future PCa research priorities. Partici-
pants expressed a desire for PCa research pertaining to
prevention and early detection, which stemmed in part
S108
Rogers et al / Am J Prev Med 2018;55(5S1):S103�S111
www.ajpmonline.org
 from confusion over recent changes in PSA screening
recommendations. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine
PSA screening for all men of average risk.35 This ran
counter to many public outreach campaigns to increase
screening, especially among high-risk populations, such
as black men. Although the USPSTF statement made no
specific recommendations for high-risk men, screening
rates fell for all men,36�38 leaving many black men con-
fused and feeling abandoned by doctors regarding PCa.
The USPSTF recently released an updated resolution no
longer discouraging PSA screening but advocating
shared decision making on the topic.39 This change in
stance may have further contributed to patients’ confu-
sion, as expressed by current study participants.
Study participants also expressed interest in environ-
mental risk factors for developing PCa, including dietary
habits. This is an active area of research, including stud-
ies of the effects of charred-meat consumption on PCa
carcinogenesis.40,41 Previous studies suggest that blacks
consume more charred meat than whites, which may
contribute
to
PCa
development
in
these
men.41
Although family history, age, and race/ethnicity are
established PCa risk factors, future studies should fur-
ther examine the role of environment—including diet—
on PCa development among black men.
For many study participants, feelings about PCa clini-
cal care and PCa research overlapped. Thus, further gen-
eral education about PCa may also facilitate willingness
to participate in research. Previous studies have demon-
strated both individual- and community-based strategies
to accomplish this.42 Future studies should employ edu-
cational interventions to promote PCa research.
Limitations
Despite this study’s contributions, its limitations must be
considered. The sample size precludes drawing definitive
conclusions, but does allow hypothesis generation.
Although the convenience-sampling technique may limit
the generalizability of study findings, the geographic
diversity of the data collection sites is a unique strength
that lays a foundation for future analyses of regional dif-
ferences or between those with or without a PCa diagno-
sis. Another limitation of this sample was its biased
educational level: more than half had at least some col-
lege experience, possibly a result of the study team’s
recruitment strategies. Participants nevertheless desired
more education about PCa, a sentiment likely to be
amplified in less-educated groups who may have even
less baseline knowledge. This issue could be explored in
future studies. Lastly, some men may have been
restrained in their comments because of the presence
of women. However, because only a few women
participated, and the PCa topics discussed were deemed
less sensitive than PCa treatment effects, the authors feel
the impact of the presence of women was likely mini-
mal.
CONCLUSIONS
The disproportionate burden of PCa on black men gives
this population a vested interest in PCa research and the
development of new clinical tools. Yet black men’s will-
ingness to accept novel genomic tools for PCa or partici-
pate in PCa research studies is limited by attitudes
toward the healthcare system and medical research in
general. This includes limited health literacy and lack of
trust because of the lingering effects of historical clinical
research abuses targeting black men, as well as concerns
within the black community about potential loss of pri-
vacy and uncertainty about how data will be used. These
barriers may be overcome by understanding and
acknowledging this mistrust, increasing PCa health liter-
acy, and assuring transparency in the research process.
