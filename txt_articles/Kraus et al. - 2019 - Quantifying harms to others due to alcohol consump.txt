Abstract
Background: The consumption of alcohol increases the risk of drinkers harming others. The extent of alcohol’s morbidity
and mortality harms to others in Germany in 2014 was estimated for (1) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASD) among newborns, (2) road traffic fatalities, and (3) interpersonal violence-related deaths.
Methods: The incidences of FAS and FASD were estimated by means of a meta-analytical approach, combining data on
alcohol use during pregnancy and the risk relationship between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and FAS/FASD. In
order to estimate alcohol-attributable road traffic fatalities and interpersonal violence due to the drinking of others, an
attributable fraction methodology was applied to cause-of-death statistics for road traffic and interpersonal violence-related
deaths.
Results: For 2014, the incidences of FAS and FASD were estimated at 41 children per 10,000 live births (95% CI 24; 63) and
177 children per 10,000 live births (95% CI 135; 320), or 2930 (95% CI 1720; 4500) and 12,650 (95% CI 9650; 23,310) children,
respectively. Furthermore, alcohol was estimated to be responsible for 1214 (95% CI 1141; 1287) third-party road traffic
fatalities and 55 (95% CI 46; 64) deaths from interpersonal violence, representing 45.1% of all third-party road traffic fatalities
and 14.9% of all interpersonal violence deaths.
Conclusion: These study’s estimates indicate there is a substantial degree of health harm to third parties caused by alcohol
in Germany. While more research on harms to others caused by alcohol is needed to provide comprehensive
estimates, the results indicate a need for effective prevention.

Background
Alcohol is a leading risk factor for the burden of disease and
injury as well as for premature mortality globally, and in par-
ticular in Western Europe and Germany [1]. However,
current alcohol-attributable harm estimates include mainly
health harms to the individuals who consume alcohol despite
the harm from alcohol consumption extending to people
other than the drinker. For instance, traffic collisions caused
by drinking drivers may involve and injure passengers, other
drivers, or pedestrians, irrespective of whether or not these
individuals had consumed alcohol. Sober people walking
home at night may be harassed and injured by drunken pe-
destrians or may be attacked while attempting to separate in-
toxicated young people who are fighting. Children may
suffer problems caused by a drinking father or mother, and
continued heavy drinking during pregnancy may severely
harm the health of the newborn. In a seminal contribution
to this field of research, Nutt and colleagues [2] concluded
that if both harm to the user and harm to others were
accounted for, alcohol was the most harmful psychoactive
substance in the UK in 2010, followed by heroin and crack
cocaine. Furthermore, of all the substances compared, alco-
hol was the greatest contributor to harms to others.
In general, health records based on the International Clas-
sification of Diseases (ICD) focus on the characteristics of

 the individual affected by the disease conditions. Particularly
in the context of injuries, which in many instances involve
an interaction with others, the diagnostic codes pay attention
to the circumstances, for instance, whether the injury oc-
curred as the result of a car crash or fire; however, the diag-
nostic codes usually neglect the involvement of other people
and their characteristics. Additionally, in surveys regarding
alcohol-related problems, only the interviewee’s own drink-
ing and its consequences are commonly recorded, although
positive answers to questions concerning whether the re-
spondent’s drinking has caused family, marital, or workplace
problems clearly indicate that other parties often have been
affected by the respondent’s drinking [3].
Earlier attempts to estimate harms to others than the
drinker (for an overview see [4]) focussed on the social conse-
quences, i.e. the “social victims of others’ drinking” [5], by ask-
ing questions about the extent of harm resulting from other
peoples’ drinking, such as whether “someone who was drink-
ing acted obnoxious or very unpleasant to you” or “someone
neglected you because of their drinking”, and more serious
problems such as “physical assault, sexual assault, accidents,
and vandalization of property”. Similar survey approaches have
been used in recent years with different and extended ques-
tionnaires, for example, in Canada [6], the USA [7], Norway
[8], and in an international comparative study in Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden [9].
In a comprehensive attempt, Laslett and colleagues [10]
estimated more serious harms to others by using not only
self-reported survey data but also registered data on road
crash fatalities and hospitalizations, child abuse, and injur-
ies sustained from interpersonal violence. These harms
were derived using the population-attributable fraction
methodology [11, 12], i.e. by estimating the proportions of
these incidents which would disappear without any alco-
hol use [13]; for methodological details, see [14]. Using a
similar approach, Rehm and colleagues [15] estimated
alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality caused by
harms to others for transport injuries, violence, and low
birth weight in the Member States of the European Union
[16]. Most recently, systematic reviews and meta-analyses
were used to estimate the national, regional, and global
prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) [17] and fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) [18] worldwide.
By estimating morbidity and/or mortality of health
harms to the newborn resulting from the mother’s
drinking, and traffic and interpersonal violence fatalities
to others than the drinker, we concentrate on the most
severe consequences of harm to others [13]. Alcohol ex-
posure in pregnancy is potentially associated with a
broad range of physical defects; cognitive, behavioural,
emotional and adaptive functioning deficits; and con-
genital anomalies in the newborn. Defects caused by
intrauterine alcohol exposure are subsumed under the
term FASD [19, 20], including symptoms of full-blown
FAS which is considered the most severe and visible
form of FASD [21]. Typical characteristics of FAS are fa-
cial anomalies and growth abnormalities. These features
are clear-cut in childhood but less prominent during
adolescence and adulthood. Damage to the brain due to
alcohol exposure is mostly irreversible and associated
with multiple co-morbidities and social consequences,
such as dropping out of school, drug and alcohol misuse,
abnormal sexual behaviour, and delinquency [22, 23].
Alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for both road
traffic accidents and various kinds of aggression. Traffic
accidents are among the leading causes of death and in-
jury worldwide, causing an estimated 1.25 million deaths
and more than 50 million injuries each year [24]. The
risk of motor vehicle accidents is reported to increase
progressively with increasing alcohol consumption [25].
Alcohol causes high levels of impairment in psycho-
motor performance [26] and impairs hazard perception
[27],
reaction
time,
attention,
concentration,
and
hand-eye coordination [28, 29]. Acute intoxication also
leads to a state of weakened attentional capacity and
limited information processing ability, resulting in im-
mediate reaction and confrontation, in some humans in
the form of aggressive behaviour, rather than a reasoned
response to everyday situations [30, 31].
Causality between alcohol use and road traffic collisions and
fatalities, and between alcohol use and violence have long been
established [32–34]. For both outcomes, there is an epidemio-
logical and experimental research supporting the relationships,
the latter with surrogate endpoints. Causality does not imply
that all people drinking above a certain level will cause traffic
collisions or become aggressive. It does mean, however, that
alcohol is one factor in a combination of necessary antecedent
conditions leading to the outcomes: in other words, in the ab-
sence of alcohol within these specific antecedent conditions,
the outcome would not happen [35].
In sum, the present study aims to estimate some of the
most severe harms that alcohol use may cause to people
in Germany other than the drinker, namely FAS, FASD,
road traffic fatalities caused by drunk drivers, and deaths
resulting from alcohol-attributable interpersonal violence.
Methods
Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders
The estimations of FAS and FASD were based on the
method proposed by Popova et al. [17] and Lange et al. [18].
This methodology estimates FAS and FASD indirectly using
recent German prevalence data of alcohol use during preg-
nancy, as representative data on these diseases were not
available for Germany. The incidences of FAS and FASD in
countries with one or no empirical studies, including
Germany, were thus predicted using data on the prevalence
of alcohol use during pregnancy and estimations of the
Kraus et al. BMC Medicine           (2019) 17:59

 quotient for the average number of pregnant women who
consumed alcohol per one case of FAS (1 in 13) or FASD (1
in 67) for countries with available data. The incidences of
FAS or FASD were then predicted by applying this quotient
to the country-specific prevalence of alcohol use during
pregnancy. The Monte Carlo method was applied to derive
the confidence intervals (CI) for the point estimates (for de-
tails on the methods, see [17, 18]).
Data: prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy
Data on the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy
were obtained from the German Health Update Study
(GEDA) [36] for the survey years 2009 (n = 21,262), 2010
(n = 22,050), and 2012 (n = 19,294). These data were
pooled and weighted to represent the distribution of the
general population on December 31, 2011. At the time
of their interview, n = 374 women reported being preg-
nant, and of those women, 27.6% (95% CI 22.5%; 33.3%)
reported having consumed alcohol during their preg-
nancy (calculations by C. Lange, data not published).
Third-party road traffic fatalities
The estimations of the number of third-party road traffic
and
interpersonal
violence
fatalities
were
based
on
cause-of-death
statistics
and
determined
using
the
alcohol-attributable fraction methodology. The estimation of
third-party traffic fatalities used the same methodology as
the 2018 WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health
[37]. The AAF for motor vehicle accidents affecting people
other than the driver (non-drivers (nd)) was estimated using
Formula 1 based on the proportion of driver deaths attribut-
able to alcohol consumption. The proportion of driver
deaths attributable to alcohol was estimated based on driver
deaths (D) as well as the AAFs for motor vehicle accidents
affecting the drivers (d) by sex (indexed by p) and age
(indexed
by
i).
This
method
assumes
that
alcohol-attributable accidents affecting third parties and in-
volving an intoxicated driver can be estimated based on the
proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths among drivers. This
method does not account for non-intoxicated drivers killed
or injured by intoxicated drivers. The relative risks under-
lying traffic injuries were obtained from Corrao et al. [38].

Interpersonal violence fatalities
The estimation of interpersonal violence fatalities due to
alcohol was based on the method proposed by Cherpitel
et al. [39]. Cherpitel and colleagues analysed the data
from emergency department studies in 14 countries on
the prevalence of patients’ self-reports of drinking within
6 h prior to a violence-related injury event, patients’ be-
liefs that the events would not have happened if they
had not been drinking at the time, and patients’ percep-
tions that the perpetrators had been drinking. The AAFs
were calculated based on the patients’ perceptions that
their own drinking was causally related to the event and
on their perceptions that the perpetrators had been
drinking. The estimated AAF for others’ drinking was
conservatively estimated at 14.9% only taking into ac-
count situations, where the respondents were sure of the
causal attribution to drinking of others [39]. Standard er-
rors and 95% CIs were calculated on the basis of the
sample sizes and prevalence rates of the 14 countries
resulting in a 95% CI from 12.5 to 17.4%. The underlying
variability as measured in interquartile range between
countries in the attributions in relevant items was 7.7%
for the situation where the others were drinking but not
oneself (median, 12.2%; 25 percentile, 8.0%; 75 percent-
ile, 15.7%) and 29.5% for the situation with both self and
others drinking (median, 24.9%; 25 percentile, 15.4%; 75
percentile, 44.9%).
Data: road traffic and interpersonal violence fatalities
Data for 2014 on deaths due to road traffic and interper-
sonal
violence
fatalities
were
obtained
from
the
cause-of-death statistics of the Federal Statistical Offices
[40]. These statistics are based on diagnoses. Only those
ICD version 10 codes which specifically address victims
or third parties were selected. Codes for neglect and
maltreatment (e.g. children or persons in need for care)
were included as we consider it an interpersonal vio-
lence if a person dies due to these circumstances. The
role of alcohol in neglect and maltreatment may differ
from that in interpersonal violence, but due to the lack
of evidence we assumed the same AAF as in other forms
of assault. Table 1 summarizes the ICD-10 codes that
were used in the present analysis.
Results
Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders
Based on the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy
of 27.6%, the incidence of FAS in Germany was esti-
mated at 0.41% (95% CI 0.24%; 0.63%) or 41 children
with FAS per 10,000 live births. FASD was estimated at
1.77% (95% CI 1.35%; 3.26%) or 177 children with FASD
per 10,000 live births per year. For the year 2014, when
there were 714,927 live births in Germany, these esti-
mates of FAS and FASD translate into 2930 (95% CI
1720; 4500) and 12,650 (95% CI 9650; 23,310) children
born with FAS and FASD, respectively.

 Alcohol-attributable third-party road traffic fatalities
Table 2 provides the absolute numbers of third-party
road traffic fatalities and the number of these deaths at-
tributable to alcohol, by age group and gender. Overall,
1214 (95% CI 1141; 1287) of 2675 third-party road traf-
fic accident deaths were estimated to be attributable to
alcohol, representing 45.1% of the total mortality of
third-party individuals due to road traffic fatalities in
2014.
Alcohol-attributable interpersonal violence fatalities
Absolute numbers of interpersonal violence fatalities
and the estimated number of these deaths which were
alcohol-attributable are depicted by age group and gen-
der in Table 3. In 2014, 368 people died from injuries
sustained as a result of interpersonal violence, and 55
(95% CI 46; 64) of these deaths were estimated to be
alcohol-attributable (26 for men, 29 for women).
Discussion
FAS and FASD in Germany were estimated at 0.41%
(95% CI 0.24%; 0.63%) or 41 children and 1.77% (95% CI
1.35%; 3.26%) or 177 children per 10,000 live births per
year, or 2900 (95% CI 1720; 4500) and 12,600 (95% CI
9650; 23,310) children, respectively. Based on the data
for 2014, the numbers of alcohol-attributable third-party
road traffic and interpersonal violence fatalities were es-
timated at 1214 (95% CI 1141 to 1287) and 55 (95% CI
46 to 64), respectively.
Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum
disorders
Three points deserve to be mentioned concerning our
estimations of alcohol-attributable FAS and FASD. First,
FAS and FASD are not the only potential consequences
of alcohol use during pregnancy. Other potential conse-
quences include stillbirth [41], miscarriage [42], preterm
birth [43], intrauterine growth restriction [44], and low
birth weight [45]. Thus, FAS and FASD are only a por-
tion of the damage which may be caused by alcohol use
during pregnancy, albeit an important part.
Second, there are major methodological challenges in
assessing the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy
and the incidence of FAS and FASD [17, 18, 46]: (1) al-
cohol
use
during
pregnancy
is
obtained
through
self-reports and is subject to reporting and recall bias,
(2) validation—as is often done—of the diagnostic cri-
teria for FAS/FASD in children already diagnosed with
FAS/FASD uses no independent reference and leads to
incorporation bias, and (3) the studies published so far
do not rely on the same diagnostic guidelines or case
definitions.

 Third, while we used the best available methodology
to estimate the prevalence of FAS/FASD in lack of a
large representative study in Germany, it has to be ac-
knowledged that using alcohol use as a predictor may
lead to measurement bias, as the true underlying behav-
iour is likely binge drinking.
Only few studies exist which estimate the prevalence
of FAS or FASD directly. For instance, studies in Italy
estimated the prevalence of FAS at 37 to 74 per 10,000
children and for FASD at 203 to 405 per 10,000 children
in 2004 [47]. For the years 2005–2007, estimates yielded
a range of 65 to 101 per 10,000 children for FAS and
334 to 626 per 10,000 children for FASD [48]. A recent
study on FASD in the USA reported higher rates, with
conservative prevalence estimates ranging from 113
(95% CI 78 to 158) to 500 (95% CI 399 to 617) per
10,000 children and weighted estimates ranging from
311 (95% CI 161 to 540) to 985 (95% CI 575 to 1395)
per 10,000 children [49]. The lack of original studies in
Germany led Spohr and Steinhausen [50] to estimate the
incidences of FAS and FASD based on international
comparisons and analogies from studies conducted be-
tween 1970 and 2000 (FAS, 5 to 20 children per 10,000
live births [51, 52]; FASD, 40 to 60 children per 10,000
live births [51]). Hence, based on rather outdated esti-
mates, the annual number of children in Germany with
FAS was estimated at 600 to 1200 newborns and for the
whole spectrum of FASD at 3000 to 4000 newborns per
year. Based on the most recent data on the prevalence of
alcohol use during pregnancy and the meta-analyses on
the incidences of FAS and FASD conducted by Popova
et al. [17] and Lange et al. [18], the present estimates for
the incidences of FAS and FASD for Germany are sub-
stantially higher than earlier estimates (see also the dis-
cussion in Lancet Public Health [53–55]). A large-scale
empirical study with active case ascertainment for
Germany is necessary to determine incidences and prev-
alences and to determine which estimates are valid.
Third-party road traffic fatalities
The present estimate of 1214 third-party road traffic fa-
talities, representing 45.1% of all such fatalities, is ap-
proximately 8 times higher than the estimate obtained
when road traffic accident statistics, a breath alcohol
level cut-off of 0.25 mg/L, and an alcohol per litre of
blood (BAC) cut-off of 0.5 g/L for the perpetrator are
used [56]. Road traffic accident statistics are very likely
subject to underreporting due to deficits in the reporting
of all cases, but particularly due to incorrect or missing
information on the alcohol concentration of the person
causing the accident. Since May 1, 1998, driving with a
breath alcohol level above 0.25 mg/L or a BAC of above
0.5 g/L is classified as an administrative offence under §
24a of the Road Transport Law. However, drivers in-
volved in road traffic fatalities who have an alcohol con-
centration below the above-stated limits but with a
breath alcohol level of at least 0.15 mg/L or a BAC of at
least 0.3 g/L are considered to have committed an
alcohol-related offence [40]. Despite the legal basis for
reporting alcohol involvement in road traffic accidents,
the Federal Statistical Office has acknowledged that
there is substantial underreporting of alcohol involve-
ment in road traffic accident statistics as alcohol involve-
ment is not routinely tested in all road traffic accidents.
The attributable fraction estimations for road traffic
fatalities used in the present approach are limited by sev-
eral factors related to the relative risks (RRs) which were
used for these estimations. Firstly, the RRs were obtained
from a meta-analysis where the underlying studies in-
volved different countries, states, and cities [38] and
where drinking contexts and the probability of injury
after consuming alcohol may differ [57]. Secondly, the
underlying RRs are based on the average daily alcohol
consumption and thus do not take into consideration
the frequency of binge drinking or the amount of alco-
hol consumed per binge drinking occasion which also
may affect the RR estimations [58]. Finally, the number

 of third parties involved in road traffic fatalities may be
underreported, potentially resulting in an underestima-
tion of the number of alcohol-attributable third-party
road traffic fatalities. Despite these limitations, the
alcohol-attributable fraction methodology based on ICD
codes reported in the cause-of-deaths statistics is consid-
erably more reliable than the road traffic accident statis-
tics and an appropriate cut-off.
Interpersonal violence fatalities
Similarly to road traffic accident statistics, alternative
statistics on alcohol-attributable interpersonal violence
injuries and fatalities are available in Germany. The
existing crime statistics, however, are subject to incom-
plete documentation of violent acts and are missing in-
formation

individuals. In 2014, the German Crime Statistics (Kri-
minalitätsstatistik) reported 250,000 suspects of violent
acts where alcohol was involved. In 40,000 of 135,000
resolved violent acts, alcohol involvement could be veri-
fied [59]. In addition, BAC cut-offs for calculating
alcohol-attributable proportions of violence to be used
similarly to road traffic injuries and fatalities (see above)
are not available. The potential causal pathways for alco-
hol leading to violence are multiple, and the likelihood
of violence at a given level of drinking varies not only
between cultures but is strongly influenced by context-
ual, situational, and personal factors [60].
Most importantly, while violence against women is
particularly widespread [61], these incidents are highly
underreported as they predominantly happen in intimate
relationships [62, 63]. In 2014, the European Union
Agency for Fundamental Rights published data on the
prevalence and health effects of violence against women
in Europe. According to this survey, one in ten women
experienced some form of sexual violence since she was
15 years old (Germany 12%), some 22% experienced
physical or sexual violence by a partner (Germany 22%),
and psychological violence was reported by 43% of the
interviewed women (Germany 50% [64].
In response to the widespread domestic and sexual
violence against women, the WHO recently published
evidence-based guidelines for responding to the issue in
healthcare, training of healthcare providers, and health
policy [65]. These recommendations, if successfully put
into practice, may not only support those women most
in need of help but may also improve the identification
and monitoring of violence against women.
Conclusions
The current study demonstrated the feasibility of esti-
mating health harms to others using standard method-
ology from comparative risk assessments; however, while
the study demonstrated general feasibility, there is still
need for improvement. As indicated, active case ascer-
tainment studies on the incidence and prevalence of
each of FAS and FASD that overcome the methodo-
logical problems outlined above need to be conducted.
Second, the existing guidelines for diagnosing FAS need
to be put into practice by offering continuous training to
paediatric and healthcare personnel. Road traffic acci-
dent statistics which include the involvement of alcohol
have been available for Germany since 1995. These sta-
tistics may be used for the estimation of harms to others
inflicted by intoxicated drivers if a suitable BAC cut-off
is used for attributing the accident to alcohol. However,
substantially lower estimates of alcohol-attributable road
traffic fatalities compared to the AAF approach suggest
that measures are needed to improve the recording of al-
cohol’s involvement and to reduce the underreporting of
incidents. Similarly, the use of official crime statistics
reporting
alcohol’s
involvement
in
interpersonal
violence-related deaths is not recommended as there is
presently no evidence for suitable cut-offs at which one
may assume that an aggressive incident could have been
avoided had alcohol not been involved.
The present findings of harms to others related to al-
cohol use during pregnancy, drunk driving, and interper-
sonal violence using the best available data reveal that
alcohol may not only cause harm to the drinker but may
also harm a substantial number of third parties. While
the estimates across the three harm domains are not dir-
ectly comparable, the results suggest that considering
the short life expectancy among children with FAS/
FASD alcohol use in pregnancy followed by road traffic
fatalities account for significantly more harm to others
than alcohol-related violence. The harmful effects of al-
cohol on others need to be recognized as a public health
problem in the same way as are the harmful effects on
the drinker or the costs to society [4]. Strategies to pre-
vent harmful alcohol consumption are based on the
growing literature on cost-effective measures to prevent
alcohol-attributable harms [66–68]. Reductions in the
overall rate of drinking are assumed to reduce heavy
drinking and consequently alcohol-related harms. Al-
though the evidence for this assumption is strong, mea-
sures such as pricing policies or limiting the marketing
of alcoholic beverages are unpopular. However, targeted
measures addressing particular populations at risk, such
as women of childbearing age or road users, may help to
reduce harms to others as well as harms to the drinker.
For instance, screening and brief interventions in pri-
mary healthcare settings have been proven effective [69,
70] as well as cost-effective in reducing hazardous and
harmful alcohol use [71]. Screening for alcohol use in all
women of childbearing age in combination with precon-
ception health promotion should become a routine in all
primary healthcare settings.

 Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also shown
that enforced legislative measures, including roadside
breath testing and checkpoints as well as individually di-
rected interventions to at-risk drinkers, are effective in
reducing drink driving [67]. Finally, targeted interven-
tions, such as training of bar service personnel [72] or
teaching psychological harm reduction strategies [73],
may help to reduce alcohol-related aggression. Although
the mechanisms of alcohol causing aggression are not
yet understood, there is evidence that alcohol facilitates
aggression in individuals with the psychological predis-
position by reducing the inhibiting forces and that alco-
hol indirectly contributes to aggression by causing
cognitive, emotional, and psychological changes which
reduce self-awareness and lead to a biased risk assess-
ment [74] (for an overview, see [32]). Thus, interven-
tions need to target persons with aggressive dispositions
and teach them social interaction and interpretation
skills
so
that
they
can
remain
non-violent
when
drinking.
