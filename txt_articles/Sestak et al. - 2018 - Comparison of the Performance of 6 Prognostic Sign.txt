IMPORTANCE Multiple molecular signatures are available for managing estrogen receptor
(ER)–positive breast cancer but with little direct comparative information to guide the
patient’
s choice.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a within-patient comparison of the prognostic value of 6 multigene
signatures in women with early ER-positive breast cancer who received endocrine therapy for
5 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective biomarker analysis included 774
postmenopausal women with ER-positive ERBB2 (formerly HER2)–negative breast cancer.
This analysis was performed as a preplanned secondary study of data from the Anastrozole or
Tamoxifen Alone or Combined randomized clinical trial comparing 5-year treatment with
anastrozole vs tamoxifen with 10-year follow-up data. The signatures included the Oncotype
Dx recurrence score, PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR), Breast Cancer Index
(BCI), EndoPredict (EPclin), Clinical Treatment Score, and 4-marker immunohistochemical
score. Data were collected from January 2009, through April 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary objective was to compare the prognostic value
of these signatures in addition to the Clinical Treatment Score (nodal status, tumor size,
grade, age, and endocrine treatment) for distant recurrence for 0 to 10 years and 5 to 10
years after diagnosis. Likelihood ratio (LR) statistics were used with the χ2 test and C indexes
to assess the prognostic value of each signature.
RESULTS In this study of 774 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, ERBB2-negative
disease (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.1] years), 591 (mean [SD] age, 63.4 [7.9] years) had
node-negative disease. The signatures providing the most prognostic information were the
ROR (hazard ratio [HR], 2.56; 95% CI, 1.96-3.35), followed by the BCI (HR, 2.46; 95% CI,
1.88-3.23) and EPclin (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.71-2.68). Each provided significantly more
information than the Clinical Treatment Score (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.58-2.50), the recurrence
score (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.40-2.03), and the 4-marker immunohistochemical score (HR, 1.95;
95% CI, 1.55-2.45). Substantially less information was provided by all 6 molecular tests for the
183 patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes, but the BCI (ΔLR χ2 = 9.2) and EPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 7.4)
provided more additional prognostic information than the other signatures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For women with node-negative disease, the ROR, BCI, and
EPclin were significantly more prognostic for overall and late distant recurrence. For women
with 1 to 3 positive nodes, limited independent information was available from any test.
These data might help oncologists and patients to choose the most appropriate test when
considering chemotherapy use and/or extended endocrine therapy.

 A
lmost all women with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive
primary breast cancer are offered adjuvant endocrine
therapy, and a highly relevant clinical question is who
remains at high risk for distant recurrence despite completion
ofprimaryadjuvanttherapy.Multigeneexpressionprofileshave
significantly increased our ability to estimate distant recur-
rence in ER-positive breast cancer after surgery and endocrine
treatment.1 These signatures are used in combination with dif-
ferent clinical characteristics to aid the selection of patients for
whom chemotherapy may be appropriate based on prognosis.
Several of these signatures are commercially available, includ-
ing the Oncotype Dx recurrence score (RS) (Genomic Health),
PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence (ROR) (NanoString),
Breast Cancer Index (BCI) (bioTheranostics), EndoPredict
(EPclin)(MyriadGenetics),andMammaPrintNetherlandKanker
Institute 70-gene signature (Agendia BV), are endorsed by sev-
eral guidelines2-5 and are routinely used by clinicians.
TheTranslationalStudyofAnastrozoleorTamoxifenAlone
or Combined (TransATAC) cohort was previously used to de-
velop 2 prognostic algorithms, the Clinical Treatment Score
(CTS), which includes clinicopathologic information, and the
4-marker immunohistochemical score (IHC4), which com-
bines prognostic information of 4 widely used IHC markers.6
The following 4 gene expression–based signatures were also
evaluated in the TransATAC cohort: the RS,6 ROR,7 BCI,8 and
EPclin.9 The RS and BCI include only molecular information
in their signatures, whereas the ROR (tumor size) and EPclin
(tumor size and number of positive nodes) integrate clinical
information. All these signatures significantly estimated the
risk of distant recurrence, particularly in women with node-
negative disease, but with a varying amount of prognostic in-
formation for late distant recurrence (5-10 years). An impor-
tant area of research remains to accurately estimate the risk
of late distant recurrence in women with ER-positive disease,
because more than 50% of recurrences occur after 5 years of
endocrinetreatment.Geneexpression–basedsignaturesshould
showanimprovementinprognosticationwhencomparedwith
standard clinical measures.8,10,11
To our knowledge, no direct and comprehensive compari-
son of multigene signatures has been performed in the same
patient population with long-term follow-up data. We com-
pared the prognostic performance of 6 signatures for distant
recurrence in the 10-year period after diagnosis to assess the
potential value of adding chemotherapy vs endocrine therapy
alone and for late distant recurrence in years 5 to 10 to inves-
tigate the potential value of extended adjuvant endocrine
therapy. Furthermore, the comparison was performed sepa-
rately for women with node-negative disease and those with
1 to 3 positive nodes because the most significant prognostic
clinical indicator for early-stage breast cancer is the presence
or absence of lymph node involvement.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
In this preplanned comparative analysis, tumor blocks from
the TransATAC study were used from patients with hormone
receptor–positiveearly-stagebreastcancertreatedwith5years
of tamoxifen or anastrozole in the ATAC randomized clinical
trial.12 Microdissection of the tumors and RNA extraction were
performed by Genomic Health, Inc, and residual RNA was pro-
vided to collaborators for RNA expression profiling. Data were
collectedfromJanuary2009,throughApril2015.Womenwere
excluded from the analysis if they received chemotherapy, did
not have ER-positive disease, received the combination treat-
ment (ie, anastrozole plus tamoxifen), or had 4 or more posi-
tive lymph nodes. This study was approved by the South-
EastLondonResearchEthicsCommittee.Allpatientsprovided
written informed consent for their tissue to be used in trans-
lational research.
Procedures
TheCTSandIHC4weredevelopedintheTransATACstudyand
havebeendescribedindetailpreviously.6Inbrief,theCTScon-
tains information on nodal status, grade, tumor size, age, and
treatment (tamoxifen vs anastrozole). The IHC4 combines 4
commonly used IHC markers, including ER, progesterone re-
ceptor, Ki67, and ERBB2 (formerly known as HER2 [RefSeq NM
_001005862.2]). The commercial signatures are based on RNA
expression profiling and were performed according to speci-
ficationsby4ofus(R.K.,S.F.,C.S.,andF.L.B.)whowereblinded
to clinical outcome data. The RS13 is a 21-gene signature that
was developed for patients with ER-positive, node-negative
breast cancer. The RS risk groups were determined for pa-
tients with node-negative cancer as previously described,13
using predefined cutoffs of less than 18, 18 to 31, and greater
than31todeterminelow-,intermediate-,andhigh-riskgroups,
respectively. The RS-pathology-clinical (RSPC) score was cal-
culated using the website tool for patients with node-
negative breast cancer.14 The BCI15,16 combines the 2-gene
HOXB13:IL17BR ratio with the molecular grade index consist-
ing of 5 proliferation genes in a linear model and was devel-
oped in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive, lymph
node–negative breast cancer.8 Cutoff points for the BCI were
determined in a population with node-negative disease (low
risk <5.0825; high risk >6.5025).17 The ROR7 incorporates 46
genes and was developed in premenopausal and postmeno-
pausal women treated without any adjuvant systemic therapy
Key Points
Question What is the comparative performance of prognostic
multigene signatures for estimation and risk stratification of
overall and late distant recurrence in estrogen receptor–positive
ERBB2-negative breast cancer?
Findings In this biomarker analysis of data from a randomized
clinical trial, a combination of multigene expression tests with
clinical information was associated with improved prognostic
value for distant recurrences and risk stratification specifically in
women with node-positive disease. Differences in the prognostic
value for late distant recurrence were observed.
Meaning The combination of clinical and molecular information
may enhance the prognostic value for distant recurrence and risk
stratification in estrogen receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast
cancer, particularly for women with node-positive disease.

 and includes information on tumor size. The TransATAC co-
hort was used to determine the cutoff points of the ROR for
risk stratification in patients with node-negative and node-
positive disease separately. They correspond approximately to
a point estimate of as much as a 10% distant recurrence rate
forlowriskandmorethana20%rateforhighriskafter10years
of follow-up.18 The EPclin was developed in premenopausal
and postmenopausal tamoxifen-treated patients with ER-
positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. It incorporates the ex-
pression of 12 genes plus information on tumor size and nodal
status.19 A predefined cutoff point (3.3, based on methods de-
scribed by Filipits et al19) was used for risk stratification, which
corresponds to a 10% distant recurrence risk at 10 years.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was the time to distant recurrence. Dis-
tant recurrence was defined as metastatic disease, excluding
contralateral disease, and locoregional and ipsilateral recur-
rences. Death before distant recurrence was treated as a cen-
soring event. We defined the following 2 primary analysis
populations:patientswithER-positive,ERBB2-negative,node-
negative breast cancer, and patients with ER-positive, ERBB2-
negative breast cancer with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes. The
primary objective was the comparison of prognostic signa-
tures in patients with node-negative and node-positive dis-
ease separately for overall (0-10 years) and late (5-10 years) fol-
low-up periods.
We assessed overall distant recurrence in the first 10 years
after diagnosis (n = 774) and late distant recurrence within the
subset of patients who remained free of distant recurrence for
the first 5 years after diagnosis (n = 689). Partial likelihood ra-
tio (LR) tests based on Cox proportional hazards regression
models were used to test the prognostic information of all sig-
natures. The amount of prognostic information provided by
each signature alone was assessed by C indexes. Further-
more, partial LR χ2 values with a 2-sided 5% significance level
(LR χ2 = 3.84) are also presented. The improvement in dis-
tant recurrence prognostication of each signature compared
with clinical and pathologic variables (CTS) was quantified by
the increase in the LR χ2 value (ΔLR χ2; 2-sided 5% signifi-
cance level). Predefined cutoffs were used to determine risk
stratification for the 4 commercially available signatures.
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the mean risk of
distantrecurrenceafter10yearsoffollow-upinpredefinedrisk
groups. To compare the prognostic performance of all signa-
tures, continuous scores were normalized to have unit vari-
ance, and the hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs were
estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models.
All statistical analyses were 2-sided, and a P value of less than
.05 was regarded as significant. All analyses were performed
with Stata software (version 13.1; StataCorp).
Results
A total of 774 postmenopausal women with ER-positive,
ERBB2-negative disease for whom all signatures were avail-
able were included in this analysis (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.1]
years) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Five hundred ninety-
one women had node-negative disease, with a mean (SD) age
of 63.4 (7.9) years and a mean (SD) tumor size of 17.6 (8.5) mm.
A total of 58 distant recurrences (9.8%) were recorded for this
population, with approximately half of distant recurrences
(n = 34) occurring in the late follow-up period (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). In contrast, women with 1 to 3 positive nodes
(n = 183) were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [8.3]
years)andhadsignificantlylargertumors(mean[SD]size,24.2
[12.2] mm) than those with negative nodes (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Forty distant recurrences were recorded dur-
ing 10 years of follow-up, with 21 of them occurring 5 years af-
ter the diagnosis. Results of the prognostic performance of all
6signaturesfortheoverallpopulation(withnode-negativeand
node-positive disease combined) and C indexes are shown in
eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Recurrence During Years 0 to 10
Population With Node-Negative Disease
All 6 signatures provided a statistically significant prognostic
value for distant recurrence during years 0 to 10; all HRs and
C indexes are shown in Table 1. The ROR (HR, 2.56; 95% CI,
1.96-3.35), BCI (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.88-3.23), and EPclin (HR,
2.14; 95% CI, 1.71-2.68) proved to be statistically more prog-
nostic than the other signatures in this patient population. The
CTS (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.58-2.50) and IHC4 (HR, 1.95; 95% CI,
1.55-2.45) provided similar amounts of prognostic informa-
tion in this period (Table 1 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
All signatures provided independent prognostic information
beyond the CTS for women with node-negative disease; in par-

veloped a distant recurrence (10-year distant recurrence risk,
6.6%; 95% CI, 4.5%-9.7%) (Figure 1 and Table 2). Only 61 pa-
tients (10.3%) were categorized into the high-risk group by the
RS,andtheyhada10-yeardistantrecurrenceriskof27.2%(95%
CI, 17.3%-41.2%). The EPclin, BCI, and ROR identified larger
proportions of women as having a high risk with 10-year dis-
tant recurrence risks of 22.1% (95% CI, 16.2%-29.8%), 27.3%
(95% CI, 18.7%-38.8%), and 32.4% (95% CI, 23.4%-43.8%), re-
spectively (Figure 1 and Table 2). For 507 women, informa-
tion for the RSPC score was also available, and the incorpora-
tion of clinical variables into the RS substantially improved the
prognostic performance for distant recurrence compared with
the molecular RS alone.
Population With 1 to 3 Positive Nodes
The CTS (HR, 1.63; 95 CI, 1.20-2.21), BCI (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-
2.29), ROR (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.15), and EPclin (HR, 1.69;
95% CI, 1.29-2.22) provided significant prognostic informa-
tion in this patient population (Table 1). The prognostic per-
formance of all signatures, although significant, was weaker
than for node-negative disease, as evidenced by the smaller
HRs and C indexes in this patient group. The IHC4 did not pro-
vide prognostic value for distant recurrence. Apart from the
IHC4, all signatures provided independent prognostic infor-
mation, with the BCI (ΔLR χ2 = 9.2) and EPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 7.4)
showing the largest improvements beyond the CTS (eFigure
2 in the Supplement).
Risk group stratification is shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The ROR identified a small group of women (n = 15) as low risk,
of whom none developed a distant recurrence at 10 years
(Figure 1 and Table 2). The EPclin categorized 43 women
(23.5%) into the low-risk group, with a 5.6% (95% CI, 1.4%-
20.9%) risk of distant recurrence at 10 years. Both signatures
identified most women as high risk with a mean 10-year dis-
tant recurrence risk of more than 30%. In contrast, a high pro-
portionofwomenwerecategorizedintothelow-riskgroupwith

29.5%) (Figure 1 and Table 2).
Recurrence During Years 5 to 10
Population With Node-Negative Disease
To assess the prognostic power of each signature for late dis-
tant recurrence, 535 women who were alive and without dis-
tant recurrence after 5 years of follow-up were included. The
HRs and C indexes are shown in Table 3. The ROR (HR, 2.77;
95% CI, 1.93-3.96), BCI (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.61-3.30), and
EPclin (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.62-2.97) provided significant prog-
nostic value for late distant recurrence (Table 3 and eFigure 3
in the Supplement) and substantially more than the CTS alone
(HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.43-2.65). The IHC4 and RS did not pro-
vide significant prognostic value for late distant recurrence
whenaddedtoCTS(eFigure3intheSupplement).TheBCI(ΔLR
χ2 = 11.2), EPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 10.3), and, in particular, ROR (ΔLR
χ2 = 18.4) provided significant independent prognostic infor-
mation for late distant recurrence beyond the CTS (eFigure 3
in the Supplement). The RSPC score provided twice as much
prognostic information for late distant recurrence compared
with the RS alone in the univariate analysis but no prognostic
value for late distant recurrence additional to CTS.
All 4 signatures categorized most of the women into the
low-risk group, who had a low mean distant recurrence risk
in years 5 to 10 of less than 5% (Figure 2 and Table 2). The
EPclincategorized142patients(26.5%)intothehigh-riskgroup,
which had the lowest 10-year distant recurrence risk of 14.6%
(95% CI, 9.6%-22.0%). In contrast, the ROR identified 78
women (14.6%) as high risk, and they had the highest 10-year
risk of distant recurrence of any test (23.2%; 95% CI, 14.9%-
35.2%) (Figure 2 and Table 2).
Population With 1 to 3 Positive Nodes
We included 154 women who were alive without distant re-
currence within the first 5 years of follow-up (Table 3 and eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement). The EPclin provided the most prog-
nostic value for late distant recurrence (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.27-
2.76), followed by the ROR (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.08-2.51) and
BCI (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.04-2.47) (Table 3). The IHC4 and RS
did not provide prognostic information for late distant recur-
rence univariately or in addition to the CTS (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). The EPclin (ΔLR χ2 = 6.1) and BCI (ΔLR χ2 = 4.6)
added significant but limited independent prognostic infor-
mation to the CTS (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Good risk stratification in this patient group was ob-
served for the BCI, ROR, and EPclin (Figure 2 and Table 2). The
ROR categorized 15 women (9.7%) into the low-risk group, of
whom none developed a late distant recurrence. The EPclin
identified a larger proportion of women as low risk (40
[26.0%]), of whom only 1 developed a distant recurrence by
year 10. No clear risk stratification was observed for the RS
(Figure 2 and Table 2).
Discussion
Multigene signatures have become increasingly important for
the prognostic evaluation of ER-positive, ERBB2-negative
breast cancer.6,20,21 Herein we compared the prognostic value
of 6 signatures for distant recurrence in the TransATAC co-
hort. During years 0 to 10, all signatures provided significant
prognostic information for women with node-negative dis-
easeinadditiontoclinicalvariables.Forwomenwith1to3posi-
tive nodes, the independent prognostic strength of the inves-
tigated signatures was weaker. Although fewer patients had
node-positive than node-negative disease, the number of dis-
tant recurrences was similar and thus provided similar power.
For late distant recurrence, the BCI, ROR, and EPclin pro-
vided independent prognostic information for women with
node-negative disease and those with 1 to 3 positive nodes.
Wepreviouslypublishedtheresultsoftheindividualevalu-
ations of the 4 commercial signatures and showed that all pro-
vide significant and similar prognostic information during the

difference in prognostic performance between signatures dur-
ing 10 years of follow-up may have been largely attributable to
theirdifferentialabilitytoestimatedistantrecurrencefrom5to
10 years. Thus, the BCI,8,22 ROR,23 and EPclin9,10 may have mo-

prognostic value for distant recurrence in patients with node-
negative disease than did the molecular RS alone.
In the adjuvant setting, the need for chemotherapy or ex-
tended endocrine therapy (for late recurrence) is an impor-

Data are stratified by signature and nodal status. Gene signatures include the
Oncotype Dx recurrence score (Genomic Health), PAM50-based Prosigna risk of
recurrence score (NanoString), Breast Cancer Index (bioTheranostics), and
EPclin (EndoPredict clinical score [Myriad Genetics]). Cutoffs for risk of
recurrence score were trained separately in patients with node-negative and
node-positive disease in the Translational Study of Anastrozole or Tamoxifen

 fied a sizeable group of women with 1 to 3 positive nodes who
had a very low risk of distant recurrence at 10 years (mean risk,
<6%), suggesting that chemotherapy would be of very lim-
ited benefit in these women.
None of the signatures were specifically developed to es-
timate late distant recurrences. However, the BCI, ROR, and
EPclin demonstrated accurate prognostic value for these late
events in our analysis. Wolmark and colleagues24 reported that
the RS was significantly prognostic for late distant recurrence
but only in patients with high ESR1 levels. However, we did
not observe an association between high ESR1 levels and late
distantrecurrencewiththeRSinourdataset.Afewstudies25-28
have investigated a series of extended endocrine therapy with
aromataseinhibitorstoaddressthequestionoftheideallength
ofextendedtreatment.TheMA17.Rtrial25showedthat10years
of letrozole therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of
disease-free survival compared with placebo. In the National
SurgicalAdjuvantBreastandBowelProject(NSABP-B42),26ex-
tended adjuvant aromatase inhibition after sequential endo-
crine therapy (DATA),28 and Investigation on the Duration of
Extended Adjuvant Letrozole (IDEAL)27 trials, no significant
improvement in disease-free or overall survival with ex-
tended endocrine therapy was observed. These data raise the
question of whether patients need to be specifically selected
for extended endocrine therapy (ie, based on high risk for late
distant recurrence or high likelihood of benefit from ex-
tended therapy).
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the mature clinical data with
clinical outcome and long-term follow-up, well-character-
ized tissue samples, and data on 6 prognostic signatures for
breast cancer. For all RNA analyses, the same extraction meth-
ods for RNA were used. For all commercial signatures, stan-
dardized quantitative methods and analyses were used, and
all collaborators were blinded to clinical outcomes. Limita-
tions include that our results are only applicable for chemo-
therapy-free and postmenopausal women. An unintended se-
lection bias might have occurred because sample analyses
might have only been possible where sufficient amounts of
RNA were available, but all assays yielded reportable results.
The IHC4, CTS, and in part the RSPC score were trained in the
TransATAC cohort, and thus their performance may have been
overestimatedinthisanalysis.TheriskgroupcutoffsoftheROR
were defined in the TransATAC cohort for women with node-
negative and node-positive disease separately, therefore op-
timizing the cutoffs to identify a low-risk group with less than
10% risk and a high-risk group with greater than 20% risk. Fi-
nally, our current analysis was not able to assess the ability of
these signatures to predict the benefit from chemotherapy or
extended endocrine therapy.
Conclusions
Theprognosticsignaturesevaluatedprovidedsignificantinfor-
mation to help determine appropriate candidates consisting of
patients with ER-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer, for
whom chemotherapy and extended endocrine therapy might
not be indicated. In patients with node-negative disease, all
multigene signatures provided significant and clinically mean-
ingfulprognosticinformationbeyondclinicalfactors.Thecom-
bination of clinical and molecular information enhanced prog-
nosticperformance,particularlyforwomenwithnode-positive
disease. All signatures performed similarly during the first 5
years of follow-up, but we found differences during years 5 to
10, when these tests may be valuable for decision making with
regard to extended endocrine treatment.
