Sexual dimorphism exists in energy balance, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Here we show that the female mice have more pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the
arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus than males, and female POMC neurons display higher
neural activities, compared to male counterparts. Strikingly, deletion of the transcription
factor, TAp63, in POMC neurons confers “male-like” diet-induced obesity (DIO) in female
mice associated with decreased POMC neural activities; but the same deletion does not
affect male mice. Our results indicate that TAp63 in female POMC neurons contributes to
the enhanced POMC neuron functions and resistance to obesity in females. Thus, TAp63 in
POMC neurons is one key molecular driver for the sexual dimorphism in energy homeostasis.

exual dimorphism exists in various physiological processes,
including feeding behavior and energy homeostasis1,2. For
example, total daily energy intake in male rats is higher than
that in females, even when corrected by their larger lean body
mass and metabolic rate3. In addition, high-fat diet (HFD)
feeding leads to larger body weight gain in male rats/mice than in
female counterparts4–8. While sex hormones (e.g., estrogens and
testosterone) and the sex chromosome complement have been
implicated as major contributors for these sex-related differ-
ences9–11, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
sexual dimorphism in body weight balance remains to be fully
revealed.
Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus
of hypothalamus (ARH) play essential roles in the regulation of
feeding and body weight balance, as genetic ablation of POMC
neurons in the ARH leads to hyperphagia and obesity in
mice12,13. On the other hand, selective activation of ARH POMC
neurons results in decreased food intake and body weight loss13,
indicating that the neural activities of ARH POMC neurons are
important for the regulation of energy homeostasis. In addition,
transcription of the POMC gene itself is physiologically relevant
for body weight control. One of the POMC gene products, α-
melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)14, acts upon brain
melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors15–18 to suppress the food intake
and body weight gain. Further, massive obesity is observed in
mice with POMC gene deficiency19. Consistently, humans car-
rying loss-of-function mutations in the POMC gene develop
obesity20–22. These findings indicate that normal POMC gene
expression is fundamentally required to maintain normal body
weight.
We observed that female mice have more POMC neurons in
the ARH than males, and female POMC neurons display higher
neural activities, compared to male counterparts. We generated
mice with POMC-specific deletion or overexpression of TAp63, a
transcriptionally active variant of p63 (a transcription factor).
Systemic characterization of these mutant mouse models revealed
that TAp63 contributes to sexual dimorphism in POMC neuron
functions and regulates energy homeostasis in a sex-specific
manner.
Results
Sexual dimorphism in POMC neurons. To explore the cellular
basis for sexual dimorphism in energy balance, we first examined
the neural activities of several neural populations that are known
to play key roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis. These
include
ARH
neurons
co-expressing
agouti-related
peptide
(AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY)23–25, steroidogenic factor-1
(SF1) neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH)
26, single-minded 1 (SIM1) neurons in the medial amygdala
(MeA)27, and SIM1 neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (PVH)28. We did not observe any sex-specific
difference in resting membrane potential or firing rate of AgRP/
NPY neurons, VMH SF1 neurons, or MeA SIM1 neurons (Sup-
plementary Figure 1A-1C, 1E-1G). While male and female PVH
SIM1 neurons showed similar resting membrane potential
(Supplementary Figure 1D), the firing rate of female PVH SIM1
neurons was significantly lower than that of the male counter-
parts (Supplementary Figure 1H). However, since the majority of
PVH SIM1 neurons are anorexigenic neurons that suppress food
intake29, the decreased firing activity of female PVH SIM1 neu-
rons should not account for the relative low body weight in
female mice.
We then compared the neural activities of TOMATO-labeled
mature ARH POMC neurons (Fig. 1a) in male vs. female POMC-
CreERT2/Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice. Interestingly, we observed
that the firing rate in female POMC neurons was significantly
higher, compared to male POMC neurons (Fig. 1b, c). In
addition, the resting membrane potential in female POMC
neurons was significantly depolarized, compared to that in male
POMC neurons (Fig. 1b, d). In other words, female POMC
neurons displayed significantly enhanced excitability, compared
to male POMC neurons.
It has been reported that female mice express higher POMC
mRNAs and protein products in the hypothalamus than male
mice30. Consistently, here we detected significantly higher POMC
mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of female mice than age-
matched males (Fig. 1e). In addition, more β-endorphin (one
POMC protein product)-positive neurons were observed in
female ARH than in males (Fig. 1f,g). Increased number of
POMC neurons (as revealed by β-endorphin immunostaining)
may reflect higher POMC expression levels in each cell that
exceed the detecting threshold by immunostaining; however,
these results may also reflect the different POMC neuron
numbers in female vs. male mice. Indeed, using POMC-
CreERT2/Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice, in which all POMC neurons
are labeled by TOMATO after tamoxifen induction (11 weeks),
regardless of the expression levels of POMC gene, we found
significantly more POMC neurons in the ARH of female mice
than in male mice (Fig. 1h,i).
TAp63 contributes to sex differences in body weight. TAp63, a
transcriptionally active variant of the transcription factor p6331,
was recently identified as a novel defensive molecule against
obesity, because mice with global deletion of TAp63 are more
susceptible to diet-induced obesity32. We found five potential
TAp63-binding sites on the promoter of the POMC gene, using
Genomatix Region Miner release 3.2 (http://www.genomatix.de
/index.html;
Fig.
2a).
We
then
performed
chromatin-
immunoprecipitation assay to show that TAp63 binds to site 3
on the POMC promoter in mouse hypothalamus (Fig. 2b). We
then cloned the wild-type POMC promoter (WT), and made
deletions in the sites 2, 3, or 4 (D2, D3 or D4 respectively),
driving a luciferase reporter. We showed, in an immortalized
mouse hypothalamic cell line (N46 cells), that overexpression of
TAp63α (one C-terminal variant of TAp63) significantly stimu-
lated the WT POMC-luciferase activity, and these stimulatory
effects of TAp63α were not affected when sites 2 and 4 were
deleted, but were substantially blunted when site 3 was deleted
(Fig. 2c). Similar patterns were observed when the other two
TAp63 C-terminal variants, namely TAp63β and TAp63γ, were
overexpressed in cells (Supplementary Figure 2A-2B). Together,
our data confirms that hypothalamic TAp63 directly binds to the
POMC promoter, and overexpression of TAp63 is sufficient to
activate POMC gene expression.
To examine the physiological functions of TAp63 in POMC
neurons, we crossed TAp63fl/fl mice33 with tamoxifen-inducible
POMC-CreERT2 mice34 to generate pomc-TAp63 KO (TAp63fl/fl/
POMC-CreERT2) mice. In the TAp63fl/fl allele, two loxP sites flank
exon 2 of the p63 gene, which is critical for TAp63 expression,
while expression of another p63 gene variant (ΔNp63) starts from
exon 3 and is therefore not affected (Fig. 3a, also see ref. 33).
Tamoxifen induction (at 11 weeks of age) led to the recombina-
tion of the TAp63fl/fl allele, specifically in adult POMC neurons in
the ARH (Fig. 3b). Consistently, we used the RiboTag approach
to confirm that TAp63 mRNAs in ARH POMC neurons were
significantly reduced in both male and female pomc-TAp63 KO
mice, compared to control mice, while the level of ΔNp63 was not
altered (Supplementary Figure 3A-3B). Notably, we did not
observe recombination of the TAp63fl/fl allele in the nucleus of
solitary tract (NTS) (Fig. 3b), where scarce POMC neurons are

 also located35,36, presumably due to the weak tamoxifen-induced
Cre activity in this population. The TAp63fl/fl allele was also
recombined in the pituitary, which contains ACTH cells (Fig. 3b).
However, there were no significant differences in pituitary levels
of TAp63, ΔNp63, FSH β subunit, LH β subunit, or POMC
(ACTH) between female control and pomc-TAp63 KO mice
(Supplementary Figure 3C-3G); no difference in circulating
ACTH was observed (Supplementary Figure 3H). Importantly,
the levels of corticosterone were not altered in the pomc-TAp63
KO mice, compared to control mice, either at the basal condition
or in response to the restraint stress (Supplementary Figure 3I).
Thus, we suggest that the deletion of TAp63 in pituitary ACTH
cells, if any, should not affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad
and
the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
axes.
Further,
we
examined the effects of tamoxifen injections on estrous cycles
in female mice; while tamoxifen transiently disrupted the estrous
cyclicity, it recovered in about 3 weeks after tamoxifen induction
(Supplementary Figure 4). Thus, most of our studies were carried
out at least 4 weeks after tamoxifen induction.
We monitored the body weight balance in male pomc-TAp63
KO mice and their littermate controls (TAp63fl/fl). Male pomc-
TAp63 KO mice showed comparable body weight as their male
controls, when fed on a regular chow diet (from weaning till
30 weeks of age; Fig. 3c). HFD feeding (from 30 weeks till
43 weeks of age) accelerated body weight gain in both pomc-
TAp63 KO mice and control males, but no difference was
observed between the two genotypes (Fig. 3c). No differences
were observed in fat mass and lean mass, except that a modest
increase in lean mass was observed in chow-fed pomc-TAp63 KO
mice at 15 weeks of age (Fig. 3d, e). Thus, deletion of TAp63 in
POMC neurons had none to minor effect on body weight balance
and adiposity in male mice.
We also monitored the body weight gain in female pomc-
TAp63 KO mice and their littermate controls. Similar to male
mutants, pomc-TAp63 KO female mice showed comparable body
weight, fat mass, and lean mass as their control females, when fed
on the regular chow (Fig. 3f–h). Interestingly, when challenged
with HFD feeding, pomc-TAp63 KO female mice gained
significantly more body weight, compared to controls; at the
end of 13-week of HFD feeding, pomc-TAp63 KO mice were 13
grams heavier than control mice (>30% of the control body
weight; Fig. 3f). The body weight gain in female pomc-TAp63 KO
mice was primarily due to a two-fold increase in fat mass, and to
a less extent an increase in lean mass (Fig. 3g, h).
Given the sex-specific phenotypes observed in HFD-fed pomc-
TAp63 KO mice, we analyzed the HFD-induced body weight gain
and body fat gain in male vs. female mice with or without TAp63
deletion. Consistent with the notion that wild-type female rodents
are more resistant to HFD-induced obesity, compared to their
male counterparts4–8,27, we found that HFD-induced body weight
gain and fat gain in female control mice were significantly lower
than those in male control mice (Fig. 3i, j). Strikingly, pomc-
TAp63 KO female mice gained as much body weight and fat as
male mice (Fig. 3i, j). In other words, the sex differences in HFD-
induced obesity were largely diminished by selective deletion of
TAp63 in POMC neurons.
We then analyzed the food intake in chow or HFD-fed mice.
We found that male mutants and their controls showed
comparable food intake, regardless they were fed on chow or
HFD (Fig. 3k S5A). Food intake in chow-fed pomc-TAp63 KO
female mice were also similar to their chow-fed female controls
(Supplementary Figure 5B). Importantly, HFD-fed pomc-TAp63
KO female mice showed increased food intake (Fig. 3l), although
these changes only became significant toward the later phase of
HFD
feeding,
which
made
it
difficult
to
interpret
their
contributions to obesity. We then performed detailed analyses
on energy balance in female pomc-TAp63 KO mice and their
control littermates with comparable body weight, lean mass, and
fat mass (Supplementary Figure 6A-6C). These mice were
acclimated into the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring
System (CLAMS) and subjected to a 3-day chow 3-day HFD
feeding protocol. While there was no significant changes in 24-h
or dark cycle food intake (either chow or HFD) between the two
genotypes, female pomc-TAp63 KO mice showed significantly
increased light-cycle food intake (Fig. 2m), which has been
associated with increased body weight gain37,38. On the other
hand, we did not observe any significant changes in energy
expenditure or ambulation between the two groups during these
short chow or HFD-feeding periods (Fig. 2n, o).
Estrogen-induced anorexigenic effects in female mice. The
female-specific metabolic deficits observed in pomc-TAp63 KO
mice suggested a potential interaction between the ovarian hor-
mones and TAp63 functions in the regulation of energy balance.
To test this, we subjected the female pomc-TAp63 KO mice and
their control littermates to either ovariectomy (OVX+V) or OVX
plus estrogen supplement (17β-estradiol, 0.5 µg per day lasting
90 days; OVX+E), followed by 11-day chow feeding and then 16-
day HFD feeding. During the initial chow-feeding period, we did
not observe significant differences in the body weight among all
groups (Fig. 4a). During the following HFD feeding period, OVX
+E treatment induced significant reductions in body weight and
food intake, compared to OVX+V treatment, in both control and
pomc-TAp63 KO mice (Fig. 4b, c). No significant differences
were observed in body weight and HFD intake between OVX+E-

 treated controls and pomc-TAp63 KO mice (Fig. 4b, c). Thus, the
lack of TAp63 in POMC neurons did not affect the anorexigenic
effects of estrogens in female mice. Interestingly, we noted that
OVX+V-treated pomc-TAp63 KO mice showed significantly less
body weight gain and HFD intake, compared to OVX+V-treated
control mice (Fig. 4b, c). Collectively, deletion of TAp63 from
POMC neurons blunted the OVX-induced body weight gain in
female mice, a phenotype associated with decreased food intake.
Overexpression of TAp63 prevents DIO in male mice. To
further investigate the function of TAp63 in POMC neurons, we
tested the effects of TAp63 overexpression only in POMC neu-
rons. To this end, we constructed an AAV vector, namely AAV-
EF1-FLEX-TAp63-2A-GFP, which encodes loxP-flanked TAp63
cDNA in an opposite orientation that overexpresses TAp63 and
GFP only in Cre-positive cells (Fig. 5a). We stereotaxically
injected this virus in the two sides (bilaterally) of ARH in POMC-
Cre mice, resulting in TAp63 overexpression only in POMC
neurons (referred as pomc-TAp63 OE; Fig. 5b).
When challenged with HFD feeding, male pomc-TAp63 OE
mice showed significantly less body weight gain than controls
(Fig. 5c), mainly reflected by reduced fat mass gain (Fig. 5d). Food
intake of male pomc-TAp63 OE mice were significantly reduced,
compared to controls (Fig. 5e). Interestingly, in male mice with
only one side of the ARH hit by the virus (Supplementary
Figure 7A), we observed partial and nonsignificant reductions in
body weight, fat mass, and food intake (Fig. 5c–e). These data
indicate that enhanced TAp63 expression in POMC neurons can
partially prevent the development of DIO in male mice. In HFD-
fed female mice, overexpression of TAp63 in POMC neurons did
not appear to significantly change body weight, fat mass, and food
intake (Fig. 5f–h). However, it is worth noting that we started
HFD feeding 3 days after the virus injections. Thus, potential
effects of overexpression in female mice may have been
confounded by the short “incubation period” after the virus
injections, together with the limited sample size in certain groups
and big variations among individual animals. Further, TAp63
overexpression in POMC neurons did not significantly alter the
body weight and the fat mass in chow-fed male or female mice,
although a significant decrease in lean mass was observed in
female mice with TAp63 overexpression (Supplementary Fig-
ure 7B-7E).
Effects of TAp63 on POMC firing activities. In order to reveal
the mechanisms by which TAp63 regulates POMC neurons, we
analyzed the effects of TAp63 deletion on POMC neural activities
in HFD-fed male and female mice. While the firing rate and
resting membrane potential of POMC neurons were not sig-
nificantly different between the male control and the male mutant
mice, TAp63 deletion led to a significant reduction in firing rate
and resting membrane potential in female POMC neurons
(Fig. 6a, b). Importantly, the sex differences in firing rate and
resting membrane potential of male vs. female POMC neuron
were diminished by TAp63 deletion (Fig. 6a, b). Thus, these data
indicate that TAp63 deletion diminished the sex differences in the
excitability of POMC neurons.
We also compared the post-synaptic currents in male vs.
female POMC neurons. No significant difference in glutamate-
mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic current (mEPSC)
was observed (Supplementary Figure 8). Interestingly, we found
that the amplitude of GABA-mediated miniature inhibitory post-
synaptic current (mIPSC) was significantly lower in female

 POMC neurons than in male POMC neurons, while the mIPSC
frequency was comparable between the sexes (Fig. 6c–e). More
importantly, female POMC neurons lacking TAp63, displayed
increased mIPSC amplitude to the level of male POMC neurons
(Fig. 6c, d). Together, these data suggest that TAp63 in female
POMC neurons suppresses their responsiveness to the inhibitory
GABAergic inputs, a potential mechanism that contributes to
enhanced excitability.
We have previously shown that ERα signals can trigger rapid
activations in a portion of POMC neurons, which in turns
produces anorexigenic effects in female mice39,40. Here we
examined the effects of a selective ERα agonist, propyl pyrazole
triol (PPT)41, on neural activities of POMC neurons from either
control or pomc-TAp63 KO mice. While 10 out of 19 (53%)
POMC neurons from control female mice were activated by PPT
(>20% increase in firing rate), only 4 out of 20 (20%) POMC
neurons from pomc-TAp63 KO female mice were activated by
PPT (P < 0.05 in χ2-test, Fig. 6f). A similar trend was also
observed when PPT-induced depolarization (>2 mV) was com-
pared in control vs. pomc-TAp63 KO mice (P = 0.09 in χ2-test,
Fig. 6g). Thus, these results indicate that TAp63 deletion reduced
the percentage of POMC neurons that respond to the ERα
agonist.

signals,

siological recordings in ERα-positive POMC neurons (double
labeled by ZsGreen and TOMATO, Fig. 6h). We found that PTT
activated all these ERα-positive POMC neurons, but the deletion
of TAp63 significantly attenuated the PPT-induced depolariza-
tion and increases in firing rate (Fig. 6j, k). These results indicate
that TAp63 deletion impaired the responsiveness of ERα-positive
POMC neurons to the ERα agonist.
Discussion
One major finding of the current study is that female POMC
neurons have higher neural activities, compared to male POMC
neurons, while such sexual dimorphism was not observed in most
of the other neural populations we tested (e.g., AgRP/NPY neu-
rons, SF1 neurons, and SIM1 neurons). Given the well-established
anorexigenic nature of POMC neurons, these enhanced POMC
neuron firing in female brains may contribute to the relatively
lower body weight in female animals, compared to male coun-
terparts. Interestingly, deletion of TAp63 in POMC neurons
increased the susceptibility to DIO in female mice associated with
decreased POMC neural activities; but the same deletion did not
affect male mice. Although we could not fully exclude the pos-
sibility that TAp63 was not fully deleted from male POMC
neurons, our results suggest that TAp63 in POMC neurons is one
critical molecule that underlies, at least partly, sexual dimorphism
in energy balance.
The mechanisms by which TAp63 in POMC neurons regulates
energy balance, clearly involves its effects on POMC firing
activities. We showed that TAp63 deletion resulted in decreased
firing rate only in female POMC neurons, but not in male POMC
neurons. The decreased POMC firing activities likely contribute
to the increased food intake and increased susceptibility to DIO
in these mutant mice. More importantly, while female POMC
neurons had increased firing rates associated with decreased
mISPC amplitude, compared to their male counterparts, this
sexual dimorphism in POMC firing activities and mIPSC
amplitude was abolished by TAp63 deletion. Thus, we suggest
that TAp63 in female POMC neurons is required to suppress the
responsiveness to GABAergic inputs and to maintain high firing
rate of these neurons, which therefore distinguishes them from
male POMC neurons. Although firing activities recorded from
ex vivo brain slices may not fully reconstruct the impacts of
physiological environments of the male vs. female animals on
POMC neurons, our results supported the notion that TAp63 has
cell-autonomous effects on POMC neuron activities in a sexually
dimorphic fashion.
It is quite surprising that we detected increased body weight
only during HFD feeding, but not during chow feeding. The lack
of body weight gain in chow-fed pomc-TAp63 KO females sug-
gest that redundant mechanisms may exist at the physiological
condition to compensate for the impaired POMC neuron func-
tions in these mutant mice. Similarly, loss of SIRT1 in POMC
neurons, while resulting in robust body weight gain in HFD-fed
female mice, causes no body weight gain in chow-fed females43.
In addition, deletion of LKB1 in POMC neurons results in about
50% reduction in αMSH levels in female mice, but fails to affect
the body weight balance44. Further, simultaneous deletion of the
insulin receptor and the leptin receptor in POMC neurons leads
to profound decreases in POMC gene expression, but does not
affect the body weight in chow-fed mice45. These observations
raise the possibility that impaired POMC neuron functions in
chow-fed mice could be compensated by redundant mechanisms,
and therefore fail to produce detectable body weight phenotypes.
On the other hand, impaired POMC neuron functions combined
with HFD feeding may be sufficient to cause energy imbalance,
and thus result in detectable body weight gain. It is also worth
noting that TAp63 has been shown to prevent skin aging by
regulating cellular senescence and genomic stability33. Thus, the
profound body weight gain during HFD feeding (starting from
30 weeks of age) may also be attributed, at least partly, to a
combined impact of TAp63 deletion and aging.
The female sex hormone, estrogen, has been long believed to
largely contribute to the sexual dimorphism in energy balance9.
Indeed, we previously showed that ERα expressed by POMC
neurons suppresses the food intake only in female mice, but not
in male mice39. Thus, an important question is whether and how
TAp63 interacts with estrogenic actions in POMC neurons. Our
results suggest that the functional interactions between TAp63
and estrogen is complex. On one hand, certain functions of
TAp63 and estrogen are independent of each other. For example,
TAp63 deletion enhanced GABA-induced mIPSC in female
POMC neurons. In addition, TAp63 can directly bind to the
POMC promoter and stimulate its transcription. Notably, POMC
expression in female hypothalamus is not affected by the estrous
cycles46 or by ERα deletion39. Thus, both these functions of
TAp63 do not appear to involve estrogenic actions. In parallel,
TAp63 deletion in POMC neurons does not recapitulate some
phenotypes seen in mice lacking ERα in POMC neurons,
including changes in energy expenditure39. Thus, at least a por-
tion of ERα actions in POMC neurons are unrelated to TAp63
functions.
On the other hand, TAp63 may be required for some estro-
genic actions in POMC neurons. For example, the ERα-evoked
neural activities in a portion of POMC neurons were reduced by
TAp63 deletion. Notably, TAp63 deletion failed to significantly
affect the effects of exogenous estrogen to reduce body weight and
food intake in OVX females. Similar phenotypes were observed in
female mice lacking ERα in POMC neurons, which develop
hyperphagia39, but respond to exogenous estrogen with com-
parable reductions in body weight as their controls40. We spec-
ulate that this may be due to the compensations in other
estrogen-responsive neurons, including those in the ventromedial
hypothalamic nucleus39,47,48 and the medial amygdala27, which
also mediate estrogenic actions to suppress the body weight.

 Interestingly, we found that female pomc-TAp63 KO mice were
less sensitive to OVX-induced body weight gain, suggesting that
TAp63 in POMC neurons is, at least partly, required for effects of
endogenous ovarian hormones (estrogens and/or progesterone).
These possibilities warrant future investigations.
In summary, we show that female POMC neurons display
higher neural activities, compared to male counterparts. We
further identified the transcription factor, TAp63, as one key
molecule that underlies this sexually dimorphic feature of POMC
neurons. Our results indicate that TAp63 regulates POMC neu-
ron functions via both ERα-dependent and ERα-independent
mechanisms. Importantly, TAp63, in POMC neurons, is required
to prevent diet-induced obesity only in female mice, but not in
male mice. Thus, these results provide important mechanistic
insights onto the cellular and molecular basis for the sex differ-
ences in body weight control, and may facilitate the development
of novel therapeutic interventions for obesity and associated
metabolic disorders.
Methods
Mice. We crossed C57Bl6j mice (purchased from the mouse facility of Baylor
College of Medicine) with NPY-GFP mice49 to generate NPY-GFP mice, which
were used for electrophysiological recordings in AgRP/NPY neurons in the ARH.
Further, SF1-Cre transgenic mice26 were bred with Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice to
generate SF1-Cre/Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice. These mice were used for electro-
physiological recordings in SF1 neurons in the VMH. In addition, SIM1-Cre
transgenic mice28 were crossed with Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice to generate SIM1-
Cre/Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice. These mice were used for electrophysiological
recordings in SIM1 neurons in the PVH and the MeA.
In addition, tamoxifen-inducible POMC-CreERT2 transgenic allele34 was
crossed with TAp63fl/fl mice33 to generate TAp63fl/fl/POMC-CreERT2 (referred as
pomc-TAp63 KO) and TAp63fl/fl (referred as controls) littermates. In parallel, we
also crossed the Rosa26-tdTOMATO and/or ERα-ZsGreen mouse alleles with
POMC-CreERT2 mice or pomc-TAp63 KO to generate mice with POMC neurons
labeled by TOMATO and/or ERα neurons labeled by ZsGreen; these mice were
used for electrophysiological recordings. Similarly, we crossed the Rosa26-RiboTag
mouse allele50 with POMC-CreERT2 mice or pomc-TAp63 KO to generate mice
with POMC neurons expressing RiboTag; these mice were used for RiboTag studies
described below. All these mice received tamoxifen treatment at 11 weeks of age
(0.2 g kg-1, i.p.), which induced Cre-recombinase activity in pomc-TAp63 KO mice.
Electrophysiology and RiboTag experiments were performed at least 4 weeks after
tamoxifen induction.
We made a Cre-dependent vector, AAV8-EF1-FLEX-TAp63-2A-GFP, to encode
loxP-flanked TAp63-2A-GFP cDNA in the opposite orientation. This vector will
overexpress TAp63 and GFP only in Cre-positive cells. POMC-Cre transgenic
mice51 were crossed with C57BL/6N mice to produce POMC-Cre transgenic mice
and WT littermates, and some POMC-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with
Rosa26-tdTOMATO mice to generate Rosa26-tdTOMATO/POMC-Cre mice with
POMC neurons labeled with TOMATO. All these mice (12 weeks of age) were
anesthetized by isoflurane and received stereotaxic injections of AAV-FLEX-
TAp63-2A-GFP virus into the ARH region (0.2 μl per side, 1.42 × 1012 GC ml-1),
and TAp63 and GFP were only overexpressed in Cre-positive cells in the POMC-
Cre mice (referred as pomc-TAp63 OE), but not in WT mice (referred as controls).
The stereotaxic coordinates for the ARH were having anteroposteriority of −0.17
cm and laterality of 0.02 cm, relative to bregma, and the dorsoventrality of −0.59
cm, relative to the skull. After recovery from the surgery, these mice were fed either
with chow or HFD, and the body weight and the food intake were measured every
2 days. At the end of the study, all the mice were perfused with 10% formalin. The
brain sections were cut at 25 μm (1:5 series), and the sections were incubated in
primary chicken anti-GFP antibody (1:5000; catalog GFP-1020, Aves Labs Inc.)
overnight, followed by the goat–anti-chicken AlexaFluor 488 (1:250; catalog
A11039, Invitrogen) for 1.5 h. Only mice with accurate targeting of the ARH (both
sides) were included in the overexpression group for data analyses; some mice with
only one side of the ARH targeted were included in a separate group for data
analyses; mice without ARH targeted were excluded.
All mouse strains were backcrossed onto the C57BL/6N background for more
than 12 generations.
Care of all animals and procedures was approved by Baylor College of Medicine
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Mice were housed in a
temperature-controlled environment in groups of two to four at 22–24 °C, using a
12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. The mice were fed either standard chow diet
(Cat#2916, Harlan Teklad) or HFD (60% fat, D12492, Research Diets), and water
was provided ad libitum.
Histology. Male and female Rosa26-tdTOMATO/POMC-CreERT2 mice received
tamoxifen treatment at 11 weeks of age (0.2 g kg−1, i.p.). At 16 weeks of age, these
mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane, and quickly perfused with 10%
formalin. The brain sections were cut at 25 μm and collected into five consecutive
series. One series of the sections were subjected to direct visualization of TOMATO
signals under a fluorescence microscope. Another series were subjected to β-
endorphin immunohistochemical staining. Briefly, the brain sections were blocked
(3% Goat–anti-rabbit serum for 1 h), incubated with rabbit anti-β-endorphin
antibody (1:10,000; #H-022-33, Phoenix Peptide) on shaker at room temperature
for 24 h and followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000;
Vector) for 2 h. Sections were then incubated in the avidin-biotin complex (1:500,
ABC; Vector Elite Kit) and incubated in 0.04% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.01%
hydrogen peroxide. After dehydration through graded ethanol, the slides were then
immersed in xylene and cover slipped. Images were analyzed using a bright-field
microscope.
The numbers of TOMATO-positive or β-endorphin-positive neurons in the
ARH were counted by blinded investigators in all brain sections containing the
ARH (1/5 of the whole brain), and the total number was used to reflect the data
value for that mouse. Several mice were included in each group for statistical
analyses.
Validation of TAp63fl/fl recombination in POMC cells. Control and pomc-
TAp63 KO mice (after tamoxifen inductions) were anesthetized with inhaled
isoflurane and killed. Various tissues, as detailed in the figures, were collected.
Genomic DNAs were extracted using the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit
(#XNATS; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), followed by PCR amplification of the
floxed or recombined alleles. Primer sequences were listed in Supplemental Table.
RiboTag approach (described below) was also used to confirm the reduction of
TAp63 mRNAs in POMC neurons.
Body weight, body composition and food intake. Male and female pomc-TAp63
KO and control littermates were weaned on chow. The body weight was monitored
weekly till the end of the study. Body composition was determined using quanti-
tative magnetic resonance (QMR) at the time, as indicated in the figures. Mice were
singly housed in order to measure the food intake in home cages.
OVX+V and OVX+E. To examine whether TAp63 mediates the effect of estrogen
on body weight control and glucose homeostasis, 12-week-old female pomc-TAp63
KO mice and control mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane. As previously
described39,52, bilateral ovariectomized (OVX) was performed followed by s.c.
implantations of pellets containing 17β-estradiol (0.5 µg per day lasting for 90 days,
OVX+E) or empty pellets (OVX+V). These pellets were purchased from Inno-
vative Research of America. Mice were fed on regular chow for the first 11 days
after the surgery and then fed on HFD for the following 16 days. Daily body weight
and food intake were monitored from the 3rd day after the surgery.
Hormone measurements. For the measurements of resting corticosterone, mice
were rapidly decapitated at 9:00 am and the trunk blood was collected; to measure
stress levels of corticosterone, mice were restrained for 60 min with a plastic
restraint cone, and blood was collected from the tail vein. Plasma was obtained by
centrifugation and assayed using a corticosterone EIA kit (900-097, Assay Designs,
Ann Arbor, MI). Aliquots of plasma were also sent to Vanderbilt University
Medical Center Hormone and Analytical Services Core to measure ACTH levels.
Quantitative PCR in pituitary. After deep anesthesia, mice were decapitated, and
the pituitaries were quickly collected and stored at –80 °C. Total RNAs were
extracted using Ribozol (AMERESCO). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed,
as described previously39. Primer sequences were listed in Supplementary Table 1.
CHIP-PCR. Hypothalamic samples from fed C56Bl6 mice were used to assess
TAp63 binding at the POMC promoter. Anti-TAp63 antibody (618901, Biolegend)
or IgG was used for immunoprecipitation. p63 binding sites were scanned within
4000 bp upstream of the 5′-UTR and intron 1, using Genomatix Region Miner
release 3.2 (http://www.genomatix.de/index.html). All primers used for ChIP-PCR
are listed in Supplemental Table. SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosys-
tems) were used for quantitative real-time PCR.
Luciferase assay. A fragment of the mouse POMC promoter (-2229 to+589,
relative to the transcription start site) was generated by PCR and was inserted into
the PGL-3 basic vector (Promega), upstream of the luciferase reporter gene that
express firefly. p53/p63 binding sites 2, 3, and 4 were deleted using QuikChange II
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) from the WT promoter luciferase reporter,
referred as D2, D3, and D4 POMC promoter. All the POMC promoter luciferase
reporters (WT, D2, D3, and D4) were co-transfected with the pRL-TK plasmids
that express Renilla together with pcDNA3.1-TAp63β or pcDNA 3.1 vector as
control to the neuronal cell line N46 (purchased from Cellutions) using Lipo-
fectamine 2000 (GIBCO BRL), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed using dual-
luciferase reagents (Promega). The promoter activity was measured by firefly
luciferase levels and normalized to the constitutively expressed Renilla.

 RiboTag IP. Experiments involving female mice were performed at unknown
estrous stage. Hypothalamic punches containing the entire ARH region (6-8 mg)
were homogenized in 350 ul buffer, as described previously50. After centrifugation,
1 ul anti-HA antibody (MMS-101P, Covance) was added to 300 ul of the cleared
lysate and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Remaining lysate was saved as input sample.
After incubation, 50 ul of protein A/G agrose beads (Santa Cruz) was added and
incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates (IPs) were washed
in high salt buffer and the RNA from inputs and IPs were extracted using Qiagen
RNeasy Micro Plus kit (Qiagen), as described in the original protocol50. We sent
aliquots of the RNA samples to Baylor Genomic and RNA Profiling (GARP) Core
for quality control. Briefly, RNA samples were subjected to the Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 to generate electropherograms. The two peaks of the 18S and 28S ribosomal
RNAs were used to calculate the RNA integrity number (RIN) as a proxy for RNA
quality. RIN higher than 8 indicates good quality. For IP sample, we used
RT–qPCR to quantify transcripts of interest (e.g., TAp63 and ΔNp63, etc.) and the
house-keeping gene (β-actin). We normalized the level of each transcript to the
house-keeper level in the same IP sample to obtain a ratio, which was used to
reflect the relative level of the transcript in that sample.
Electrophysiology. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then
decapitated at 9:00 am, and the entire brain was removed and immediately sub-
merged in ice-cold sucrose-based cutting solution. Using a Microm HM 650 V
vibratome (Thermo Scientific), the brains were cut into coronal slices (without
trimming at other dimension) at the thickness of 250 µm each. Usually, 3–4
consecutive brain slices per mouse, ranging from Bregma −2.54 to −1.46 mm,
contained the ARH and adjacent nuclei (the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus,
the dorsal medial hypothalamus, and the lateral hypothalamus) were used for
recordings. The slices were recovered for 1 h at 34 °C and then maintained at room
temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, adjusted to pH 7.3) containing
(in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 11.1 glucose, and
21.4 NaHCO3 saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 before recording53.
Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and allowed to equilibrate for
at least 10 min before recording. The slices were superfused at 34 °C in oxygenated
aCSF at a flow rate of 1.8-2 ml min−1. POMC neurons (or ERα-expressing POMC
neurons) in the ARH were visualized using epifluorescence and IR-DIC imaging on
an upright microscope (Eclipse FN-1, Nikon) equipped with a moveable stage
(MP-285, Sutter Instrument). Patch pipettes with resistances of 3-5 MΩ were filled
with intracellular solution (adjusted to pH 7.3) containing (in mM) 128 K
gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 3 Mg-ATP53.
Recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instrument),
sampled using Digidata 1440 A, and analyzed offline with pClamp 10.3 software
(Axon Instrument). Series resistance was monitored during the recording, and the
values were generally <10 MΩ and were not compensated. The liquid junction
potential was+12.5 mV and was corrected after the experiment. Data were
excluded if the series resistance increased dramatically during the experiment or
without overshoot for action potential. Currents were amplified, filtered at 1 kHz,
and digitized at 20 kHz. The whole-cell patch current clamp was engaged to test
neural firing rate at the baseline and after puff of 100 nM PPT, as we did
before40,54. The values for firing rate were averaged within 2 min bin at the baseline
or after PPT treatment53. Some recordings were done using perforated patch.
Briefly, the patch pipette solution for gramicidin perforated patch recording
contained (in mM): KCl 150 and HEPES 10, pH 7.2 adjusted with Tris-OH. The
gramicidin was first dissolved in DMSO in a stock solution of 60 mg mL−1 and
then diluted to a final concentration of 30 µg mL−1. The gramicidin-free pipette
solution was backfiled into the pipette first and the gramicidin-containing pipette
solution was then added into the pipette.55 After 10–15 min of cell-attached
formation, series resistance (Rs) decreased and stabilized at around 10 to 50 MΩ.
The resting membrane was then recorded in the current clamp model. Action
potential (AP) firing rate and resting membrane potential were measured using the
clamp fit 10.3 software (Axon Instrument). For the miniature excitatory post-
synaptic current (mEPSC) recordings, the internal recording solution contained:
125 mM CsCH3SO3; 10 mM CsCl; 5 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10
mM HEPES, 5 mM (Mg)ATP, and 0.3 mM (Na)GTP (pH 7.3 with NaOH). mEPSC
in AgRP neurons was measured in the voltage clamp mode with a holding potential
of −60 mV in the presence of 1 μM TTX and 50 μM bicuculline. The miniature
inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC) in POMC neurons was measured in the
voltage clamp mode with a holding potential of −60 mV in the presence of 1 μM
TTX and DAP-5 (30 μM; an NMDA receptor antagonist)56 and CNQX (30 μM; an
NMDA receptor antagonist)57. Frequency and peak amplitude were measured
using the Mini Analysis program (Synaptosoft, Inc.).
Statistics. The minimal sample size was predetermined by the nature of experi-
ments. For most of physiological readouts (body weight, food intake, etc.), at least 6
mice per group were included. For gene expression, 3–5 mice were included in each
group. For electrophysiological studies, 20–40 neurons in each genotype or con-
dition were included. The data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism to evaluate normal distribution and var-
iations within and among groups. Methods of statistical analyses were chosen
based on the design of each experiment and are indicated in figure legends. P < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
Study approval. Care of all animals and procedures were conformed to the Guide
for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the US National Institutes of Health
and were approved by the Animal Subjects Committee of Baylor College of
Medicine.
