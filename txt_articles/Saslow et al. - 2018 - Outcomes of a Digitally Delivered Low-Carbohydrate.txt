Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus has serious health consequences, including blindness, amputation, stroke, and dementia,
and its annual global costs are more than US $800 billion. Although typically considered a progressive, nonreversible disease,
some researchers and clinicians now argue that type 2 diabetes may be effectively treated with a carbohydrate-reduced diet.
Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes of the digitally delivered Low-Carb Program, a nutritionally
focused, 10-session educational intervention for glycemic control and weight loss for adults with type 2 diabetes. The program
reinforces carbohydrate restriction using behavioral techniques including goal setting, peer support, and behavioral self-monitoring.
Methods: The study used a quasi-experimental research design comprised of an open-label, single-arm, pre-post intervention
using a sample of convenience. From adults with type 2 diabetes who had joined the program and had a complete baseline dataset,
we randomly selected participants to be followed for 1 year (N=1000; mean age 56.1, SD 15.7 years; 59.30% (593/1000) women;
mean glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.8%, SD 2.1%; mean body weight 89.6 kg, SD 23.1 kg; taking mean 1.2, SD 1.01
diabetes medications).
Results: Of the 1000 study participants, 708 (70.80%) individuals reported outcomes at 12 months, 672 (67.20%) completed
at least 40% of the lessons, and 528 (52.80%) completed all lessons of the program. Of the 743 participants with a starting HbA1c
at or above the type 2 diabetes threshold of 6.5%, 195 (26.2%) reduced their HbA1c to below the threshold while taking no
glucose-lowering medications or just metformin. Of the participants who were taking at least one hypoglycemic medication at
baseline, 40.4% (289/714) reduced one or more of these medications. Almost half (46.40%, 464/1000) of all participants lost at
least 5% of their body weight. Overall, glycemic control and weight loss improved, especially for participants who completed all
10 modules of the program. For example, participants with elevated baseline HbA1c (≥7.5%) who engaged with all 10 weekly
modules reduced their HbA1c from 9.2% to 7.1% (P<.001) and lost an average of 6.9% of their body weight (P<.001).
Conclusions: Especially for participants who fully engage, an online program that teaches a carbohydrate-reduced diet to adults
with type 2 diabetes can be effective for glycemic control, weight loss, and reducing hypoglycemic medications.

 Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is prevalent, costly, and a potentially
progressive disease with serious health consequences including
blindness, amputation, stroke, dementia, and premature death
[1]. Globally, one in 11 people, or 422 million adults, have
diabetes (with most of those cases being type 2 diabetes) [2]. It
is the most expensive disease in the United States [3], and its
annual global costs are more than US $800 billion [4]. In
community settings, type 2 diabetes is rarely reversed. For
example, a study that followed more than 100,000 patients with
type 2 diabetes over 7 years found that less than 1% of patients
experienced complete remission [5].
Although typically considered a progressive, nonreversible
disease, some researchers and clinicians now argue that type 2
diabetes may be effectively treated with a carbohydrate-reduced
diet, which could improve type 2 diabetes management and
potentially even lead to remission [6]. Indeed, previous research
with carbohydrate-reduced diets for type 2 diabetes do show
improved outcomes (eg, glycemic control, weight loss, and
reductions in the use of hypoglycemic medications) for both
very low-carbohydrate diets (approximately 20% or fewer of
total dietary calories derived from carbohydrates) [7-9] or lower
carbohydrate diets (approximately 40% or fewer of total dietary
calories derived from carbohydrates) [10,11].
Although dietary interventions have historically been in-person,
online programs can be just as effective for some participants,
as suggested by research that has examined diet and lifestyle
interventions in adults with prediabetes [12]. Therefore, it is
perhaps not surprising that the beneficial results of
carbohydrate-reduced diets for people with type 2 diabetes
(glycemic control, weight loss, and reductions in the use of
hypoglycemic medications) have been replicated using online
programs [13,14]. Notably, both previous trials of a very
low-carbohydrate diet online for adults with type 2 diabetes
included the use of a coach. However, previous research on
weight loss (including some people with type 2 diabetes), have
shown some success with a completely automated online weight
loss program, with approximately 50% of participants losing at
least 5% of their body weight by 6 months [15,16].
In this naturalistic pilot study, our objective was to evaluate the
1-year outcomes of the Low-Carb Program, a digitally delivered,
nutrition-focused, structured lifestyle intervention with 10
weekly sessions for glycemic control, hypoglycemic medication
use, and weight loss for adults with type 2 diabetes. We
hypothesized that this program would lead to improvements
compared to baseline: better glycemic control (as measured by
glycated hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c), weight loss, and reductions
in hypoglycemic medication use. Our goal was to explore
whether the program might be an effective option for increasing
access to diabetes management solutions and help halt the
prevalent, costly, and dangerous type 2 diabetes epidemic.
Methods
Research Design
We used a quasi-experimental research design comprised of a
single-arm pre-post intervention. Participants were not paid for
their participation, but because the program was free, they took
part in the program at no cost. The University of Michigan
Institutional Review Board (IRB) ruled that analyses of these
previously collected and de-identified data were not subject to
IRB regulation.
Participants
We recruited participants to this trial in three phases. The first
phase recruited a sample of convenience following the launch
of the Low-Carb Program (November 14, 2015-November 14,
2016), whereby 105,950 adults with type 2 diabetes between
the ages of 18 and 99 years signed up to participate in the
program. Participants could live anywhere in the world. To have
a broad applicability to a nonclinical trial setting, the only de
facto exclusion criterion was the inability to understand English.
Second, upon sign-up, the program prompted individuals to
complete an initial baseline survey; 19,646 of 105,950 (18.54%)
did so. Of those, 7809 people had complete baseline datasets
including weight, a recent HbA1c result (taken within 4 months),
and medication use. Third, we used GraphPad Random
Generator Software to randomly select a subset of 1000
participants to be followed for 12 months, thus enabling us to
select participants for no other reason than that they were
randomly selected by the software. Therefore, we did not include
all the 7809 patients to follow over a year, but instead followed
a random subsample of 1000 (see Figure 1).
The Low-Carb Program
The Low-Carb Program is a completely automated, structured
10-week health intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes.
Participants are given access to nutrition-focused modules, with
a new module available each week over the course of 10 weeks.
The modules are designed to help participants gradually reduce
their total carbohydrate intake to less than 130 grams per day
to meet their self-selected goals. The program encourages
participants to make behavior changes based on “action points”
or behavior change goals at the end of each module. These goals
are supported with resources that are available to download,
including information sheets, recipes, and suggested food
substitution ideas. The Low-Carb Program online platform also
includes digital tools for submitting self-monitoring data on a
number of different variables including blood glucose levels,
blood pressure, mood, sleep, food intake, and body weight.
Weekly automated feedback is provided to users based on their
use of the program through email notifications, and participants
are notified when the next week’s module has been opened.
Lessons are taught through videos, written content, or podcasts
of varying lengths (approximately 3 to 12 minutes long).

 Figure 1. Study participant flowchart for the study.
The first 2 weeks of the program contain an explanation of the
physiology of type 2 diabetes and the role of diet, including a
description of how a low-carbohydrate diet can help manage
postprandial blood glucose levels and weight. The subsequent
week’s modules explore strategies to reduce dietary sources of
sugar, in particular, high-starch foods, such as bread, pasta, and
rice. Participants are encouraged to make portion control and
carbohydrate restriction decisions based on visual plate
representations. In place of carbohydrate-rich foods, an increased
intake of green vegetables, low-glycemic index fruits (eg,
blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries) and fats (eg, from
olive oil, butter, eggs, nuts, and full-fat dairy) are advocated.
The program stresses the importance of regular contact with the
participants’ health care providers for adjustments in
medications in weeks 1, 2, and 10. After the 10 weeks of
modules have been opened, participants continue to have access
to the education content as well as the ability to continue to
track their health (glycemic control, weight) and access support
from the discussion board. See Table 1 for a list of the weekly
topics.
Much of the content of the Low-Carb Program is based on an
in-person, nurse- and physician-led, low-carbohydrate training
program conducted in a primary health care setting [17]. For
example, the dietary recommendations reflect an understanding
of the glycemic index, a relative ranking of carbohydrates in
foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels. A meal
of pure glucose (the index food) has a score of 100, boiled
potatoes are scored at 96, cornflakes at 93, and brown bread at
74, all of which are higher than table sugar at 63 [18]. This kind
of information helps participants understand that both sugary
and starchy foods increase blood glucose, and it also explains
why the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
advises physicians to “encourage high-fiber, low-glycemic index
sources of carbohydrate in the diet” for type 2 diabetes [19].
Based on this, the program suggests a reduction in all sugary
foods and replacing starchy foods, such as potato or rice, with
green leafy vegetables, healthy fats, and some protein.

The content and strategies used in the program build off prior
research and theory. For example, evidence suggests that goal
setting can act as an effective behavior change strategy used to
improve adherence to lifestyle intervention programs in obesity
management programs [20]. Therefore, the program encourages
participants to select a goal at the beginning of the program (eg,
to lose weight, reduce medication dependency, or make healthier
choices for their whole family). Participants are also prompted
to consider how their health would benefit from attaining their
goal. Throughout the program, participants are periodically
prompted to consider how close they are to attaining their goal.
The program further reinforces behavior change through
integrated tracking whereby program users are encouraged to
track their health data including mood, food intake, blood
glucose levels, weight, sleep, and HbA1c. According to the
Control Theory of behavior change, monitoring goal
progress—that is, evaluating one’s ongoing performance relative
to the standard—and responding accordingly is critical to goal
attainment [21]. Recent findings suggest that program
interventions that elevate the frequency of progress monitoring
are likely to induce behavior change [22].
In addition, prior studies demonstrate that peer support may
improve blood glucose control [23,24], peer-based support may
be as effective for weight loss as coach-based support [25], and
that online discussion boards can be supportive for weight loss
[26]. Therefore, the program encourages social support by
matching new participants of the program to a “buddy,” a
previous graduate of the program, based on similar
demographics including age, gender, and their self-selected
goal. Participants are encouraged to interact with that buddy
and peers on the program’s moderated online discussion board.
Measures
At baseline, an online survey asked participants to report on
their type of diabetes, year of diagnosis, their most recent HbA1c
test result and date, current medications (medication name, dose,
and regimen), age, gender, socioeconomic status (based on
household income), and presence of comorbid chronic illnesses.
At 12 months, participants were again asked to report on their
current HbA1c, weight, and medications.
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were performed using the SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). We examined the difference in
characteristics from baseline to 12-month follow-up using paired
t tests. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c and body
weight (kg, percent of initial body weight). The secondary
outcome was change in need for diabetes medication. We
stratified our cohort into three groups according to baseline
glycemic control as defined by baseline HbA1c: (1) elevated
baseline HbA1c greater than or equal to 7.5%, (2) slightly
elevated baseline HbA1c 6.5% to 7.4%, or (3) normal baseline
HbA1c less than 6.5%. Outcomes were also analyzed within
strata based on participant’s Low-Carb Program completion (ie,
completers: engaged with all 10 of the Low-Carb Program
weekly modules; n=528), partial completers (engaged with 4-9
modules; n=144), or noncompleters (engaged with ≤3 modules;
n=328).
Some of our results took into account the entire sample,
regardless of follow-up information or lesson completion. For
participants who did not report their outcomes at 12 months,
we followed the highly conservative approach of assuming that
they did not improve at all (last observation carried forward),
by imputing their baseline values as their outcome values. For
example, participants who did not comply with reporting a
12-month outcome were treated as having no change in the
outcome variable, and thus were not counted as having any
HbA1c or weight improvement.

 Results
Participant Characteristics at Baseline
At baseline, mean HbA1c was 7.8% (SD 2.1%), mean weight
was 89.6 kg (SD 23.1), and mean age was 56.1 years (SD 15.7)
years. More than half of participants were female (59.3%,
593/1000), 90.4% (904/1000) were white, all were from the
United Kingdom, and more than one-third had comorbid
hypertension (39.7%, 397/1000) or hypercholesterolemia
(35.0%, 350/1000). At baseline, participants were taking a mean
of 1.21 (SD 1.01) hypoglycemic medications. See Table 2 for
details.
Retention
Of the 1000 baseline participants, 708 (70.80%) reported
outcomes at 12 months, 528 (52.80%) completed all lessons,
and 672 (67.20%) completed at least 40% of the lessons. For
the remaining 292 people lost to follow-up, the last recorded
data point was carried forward. Of 447 people with elevated
HbA1c (≥7.5%) at baseline, 247 (55.3%) reported outcomes at
12 months and 191 (42.7%) completed all lessons. Of 296 people
with slightly elevated HbA1c (6.5%-7.5%) at baseline, 238
(80.4%) had outcomes at 12 months and 182 (61.4%) completed
all lessons. Of 257 people with a normal baseline HbA1c level
(HbA1c <6.5%) who began the study, 223 (86.8%) had outcomes
at 12 months and 155 (60.3%) completed all lessons (see Figure
1 for the participant flowchart of the study).

 Changes in Glycemic Control
Considering all participants pooled across baseline HbA1c, those
who completed the Low-Carb Program showed a statistically
significant change in HbA1c of –1.17% (SD 1.43; t527=18.724,
P<.001). Partial completers showed a statistically significant
change in HbA1c of –0.6% (SD 1.69; t143=4.276, P<.001) and
noncompleters showed a nonsignificant HbA1c change of only
–0.16% (SD 1.13; t328=2.54, P=.01). Results stratified by
baseline HbA1c are presented in Table 3, and results for just
Low-Carb Program completers are presented in Figure 2.
Body Weight
Considering all baseline HbA1c groups combined, Low-Carb
Program completers (n=528) showed a significant reduction in
weight, with a mean body weight change of –7.45 kg (SD 12.63)
or –7.0% (SD 12.81%; t527=13.551, P<.001). Partial completers
(n=144) showed a reduction in weight, with a mean body weight
change of –2.13 kg (SD 16.40) or –1.1% (SD 25.42%); however,
this weight change was not statistically significant (t143=1.563,
P=.12). Noncompleters (n=328) did not have a statistically
significant change in weight, with mean change of –0.35 kg
(SD 10.13) or 0.7% (SD 13.41%; t327=0.625, P=.53). Results,
stratified by baseline HbA1c, are presented in Table 4, and results
for just Low-Carb Program completers are presented in Figure
3.
Hypoglycemic Medications
The majority of participants (714/1000, 71.40%) were prescribed
at least one hypoglycemic medication at baseline. At 1 year, of
those originally prescribed medications, 289/714 (40.4%)
individuals were able to stop one or more hypoglycemic
medications. Of the 743 participants who started with an HbA1c,
equal to or above the type 2 diabetes threshold of 6.5%, 195
(26.2%) reduced their HbA1c to below the threshold while taking
no glucose-lowering medications or just metformin.
For participants who completed the program, the proportion
prescribed hypoglycemic medications changed significantly
between baseline and follow-up for metformin (χ2
24=146.5,
P<.05) and other hypoglycemic medications (all hypoglycemic
medications other than metformin and insulin: χ2
24=73.8, P<.05).
However, there was no significant change in being prescribed
insulin (χ2
24=34.1, P=.08; see Figure 4).

 Discussion
The Low-Carb Program is a digitally delivered, peer-supported,
nutrition-focused, structured 10-week health intervention aimed
at improving glycemic control, reducing hypoglycemic
medication use, and promoting weight loss among adults with
type 2 diabetes. This was not a randomized controlled trial, so
we cannot compare the 12-month results to a control or
standard-of-care group; therefore, the results of our trial should
be interpreted cautiously because the study used convenience
sampling, open-label, single-arm design, pre-post self-reported
outcomes, and 71% of participants reported outcomes at 12
months. Even so, when adults with type 2 diabetes participate
in the Low-Carb Program, and especially when they finish all
10 modules of the program, they report significantly reduced
HbA1c, weight loss, and reduced medications. The percentage
of individuals with an HbA1c level less than 6.5% (indicating
good diabetes control) increased from 25.70% (257/1000) to
50.30% (503/1000). Furthermore, 46.00% (464/1000) of
participants lost at least 5% of their body weight. Also, of
participants who were taking at least one hypoglycemic diabetes
medication at baseline, 289/714 (40.5%) reduced one or more
of these medications.
The percentage of individuals with an HbA1c level of less than
6.5% increased from 25.70% (257/1000) to 50.30% (503/1000).
This degree of control, when achieved through pharmacotherapy,
is often accompanied by weight gain and risk for hypoglycemic
events [27]. Indeed, as the now famous Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study reported,
intensive hypoglycemic medical therapy “increased mortality
and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events”
[28].
As in other studies using a carbohydrate-restricted dietary
approach, including Dr Unwin’s in-person program on which
the Low-Carb Program was partially modeled [14,17,29], we
achieved HbA1c reduction with weight loss and decreased
hypoglycemic medication use. This approach is given further
credence by a recent meta-analysis, which concluded that
carbohydrate-reduced interventions improve glucose control,
in addition to other positive health effects such as improved
triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [30].
Our study has several limitations. Although we encouraged
participants to eat a carbohydrate-restricted diet, we did not
measure their dietary intake. We also measured health outcomes
(weight, glycemic control, and medication changes) using
self-report, rather than measuring them directly or through
medical records. However, previous research has found that
these self-reported health outcomes can be quite close to actual
values [31,32]. Another limitation was our rate of delivering
the entire intervention, as only 528 (52.8%) completed all
modules. However, a high rate (70.8%) reported 12-month
outcomes. On the other hand, given that this program was
entirely automated and had a wide reach, a large number of
individuals were able to complete the program.
For participants who fully engage, an automated online program
teaching a carbohydrate-reduced diet to adults with type 2
diabetes may facilitate glycemic control, weight loss, and
reduced need for hypoglycemic medication. Although our design
does not support causal conclusions, the program may be a
useful adjunct for lifestyle self-management for adults with type
2 diabetes.
