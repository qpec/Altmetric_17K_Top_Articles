ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To compare clinical outcomes between short term 
(up to 6 months) and long term (12 months) dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after placement of a drug 
eluting stent in patients with and without diabetes.
Design
Individual participant data meta-analysis. Cox 
proportional regression models stratified by trial 
were used to assess the impact of diabetes on 
outcomes.
Data sOurCe
Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases and 
proceedings of international meetings searched for 
randomised controlled trials comparing durations of 
DAPT after placement of a drug eluting stent. Individual 
patient data pooled from six DAPT trials.
Primary OutCOme
Primary study outcome was one year risk of major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as cardiac 
death, myocardial infarction, or definite/probable 
stent thrombosis. All analyses were conducted by 
intention to treat.
results
Six trials including 11 473 randomised patients were 
pooled. Of these patients, 3681 (32.1%) had diabetes 
and 7708 (67.2%) did not (mean age 63.7 (SD 9.9) and 
62.8 (SD 10.1), respectively), and in 84 (0.7%) the 
information was missing. Diabetes was an 
independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio 2.30, 
95% confidence interval 1.01 to 5.27; P=0.048 At one 
year follow-up, long term DAPT was not associated with 
a decreased risk of MACE compared with short term 
DAPT in patients with (1.05, 0.62 to 1.76; P=0.86) or 
without (0.97, 0.67 to 1.39; P=0.85) diabetes (P=0.33 
for interaction). The risk of myocardial infarction did 
not differ between the two DAPT regimens (0.95, 0.58 
to 1.54; P=0.82; for those with diabetes and 1.15, 0.68 
to 1.94; P=0.60; for those without diabetes (P=0.84 
for interaction). There was a lower risk of definite/
probable stent thrombosis with long term DAPT among 
patients with (0.26, 0.09 to 0.80; P=0.02) than 
without (1.42, 0.68 to 2.98; P=0.35) diabetes, with 
positive interaction testing (P=0.04 for interaction), 
although the landmark analysis showed a trend 
towards benefit in both groups. Long term DAPT was 
associated with higher rates of major or minor 
bleeding, irrespective of diabetes (P=0.37 for 
interaction).
COnClusiOns
Although the presence of diabetes emerged as an 
independent predictor of MACE after implantation of 
a drug eluting stent, compared with short term DAPT, 
long term DAPT did not reduce the risk of MACE but 
increased the risk of bleeding among patients with 
stents with and without diabetes.
Introduction
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) represents the evi-
dence based standard of care among patients undergo-
ing percutaneous coronary intervention. Treatment 
aims to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis after 
implantation of a coronary stent and prevent coronary 
atherothrombotic events at sites outside the stented 
segment. The optimal duration of DAPT after stent 
implantation in general, and particularly after implan-
tation of a drug eluting stent, however, remains a mat-
ter of  
controversy.1-7  Currently, a minimum duration of 
six months has been advocated in professional 
 
guideline documents and adopted worldwide for 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the standard of care among patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention, but its optimal duration is debated, 
particularly after implantation of a drug eluting stent
Some trials have shown that short term (up to 6 months) DAPT is not inferior to 12 
months of treatment
As diabetes is a well known risk factor for cardiovascular disease as well as for 
disease progression and ischaemic complications after percutaneous coronary 
intervention, patients might benefit from prolonged DAPT
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
After percutaneous coronary intervention with implantation of a drug eluting stent, 
patients with diabetes, including those receiving treatment with insulin, were 
confirmed to be at higher risk of ischaemic events compared with patients without 
diabetes, though long term compared with short term DAPT did not reduce 
ischaemic or composite endpoints and slightly increased the risk of bleeding in 
patients with and without diabetes
Short term DAPT after implantation of a drug eluting stent is as effective as long 
term DAPT in patients with or without diabetes and might reduce risks and costs of 
prolonged treatment

management of patients receiving drug eluting stents, 
irrespective of type.8-10
Diabetes mellitus is a widely recognised risk factor 
for atherosclerosis, disease progression, and restenosis 
after percutaneous coronary intervention.11-14  Although 
new generation drug eluting stents have also been 
shown to provide improved safety and efficacy com-
pared with balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents, and 
early generation drug eluting stents among patients 
with diabetes, such patients, particularly when they 
need treatment with insulin, have a high ischaemic 
risk.15-18  Increased platelet and thrombin reactivity and 
decreased response to therapeutic agents including 
aspirin and clopidogrel have been described in patients 
with diabetes.19 
20
Whether diabetes should be taken into consideration 
in the selection of the most appropriate duration of 
DAPT remains unclear. Recently, it was proposed that 
the presence of diabetes can identify patients who ben-
efit from prolonged DAPT because of the increased 
related ischaemic risk.4 
6 
21  Yet the evidence appraising 
the role of diabetes in the choice of the optimal duration 
is limited.22
We assessed the impact of diabetes status on out-
comes after implantation of drug eluting stents in 
patients treated with short term (≤6 months) or long 
term (12 months) DAPT. We conducted a patient level 
pooled analysis of randomised trials comparing clinical 
outcomes between short term and long term treatment 
after implantation of a drug eluting stent and stratified 
outcomes according to diabetes status.
Methods
study design
The present study was an individual participant data 
(IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials 
designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of long 
versus short term DAPT in patients with or without 
medically treated diabetes. The present meta-analysis 
was performed according to the PRISMA-IPD state-
ments.23
In November 2015, we searched Medline, Embase, 
Cochrane controlled trials register databases, and main 
international websites and meetings for randomised 
controlled trials directly comparing short term (3-6 
months) and long term (≥12 months) DAPT among 
patients 
undergoing 
percutaneous 
coronary 
 
intervention with drug eluting stents. We excluded tri-
als that looked at DAPT for 12 months compared with 
more than 12 months. The following keywords were 
used: “randomized clinical trial”, “drug-eluting stent”, 
“dual  
antiplatelet therapy”, “clopidogrel”, “aspirin”, 
“thienopyridines” (see appendix for supplementary 
methods). No language or publication date restrictions 
were imposed. The most recent data for a given study 
were abstracted. The internal validity of randomised 
controlled trials was assessed by evaluating conceal-
ment of allocation, blind adjudication of events, and 
inclusion of all randomised patients in the analysis. The 
quality of trials included in the meta-analysis was 
appraised with Cochrane methods (selection bias, per-
formance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting 
bias, and other bias).
Three investigators (GG, MV, and TP) independently 
did the systematic search and critically identified stud-
ies to ensure satisfaction of the collected studies.
Among qualifying trials, those for which we obtained 
patient level data from the principal investigators were 
finally included in the present meta-analysis and com-
bined in a single pooled database. In addition to the 
four previously included randomised controlled tri-
als,24-28  we included the SECURITY29  and the ITALIC30 
 
trials (fig 1 ; tables A-D in appendix). The intention to 
treat population was used for these analyses, including 
all patients according to randomised treatment arm 
regardless of actual treatment. Data beyond one year 
were censored to preserve analysis homogeneity. Fur-
thermore, we excluded a quarter of patients randomised 
to bare metal stents from the PRODIGY population to 
restrict the analysis to patients receiving a drug eluting 
stent.25 31 Characteristics of the included studies are 
described in tables A-D in the appendix.
Definitions end endpoints
Our primary endpoint was the one year rate of major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE), including the compos-
ite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or definite/
probable stent thrombosis, as previously described.24 
Secondary endpoints included the one year rate of 
major and minor bleeding, all cause death, cardiac 
death, stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis 
(definite, probable, and definite/probable), and target 
vessel revascularisation, and combinations of these 
endpoints.

We incorporated the endpoint definitions as applied 
in each trial. Stent thrombosis was defined according to 
criteria from the academic research consortium.32  Four 
of the included trials defined bleeding according to 
TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) criteria.33 
 
One trials used the modified REPLACE-2/GUSTO 
 
criteria,26  while another trial used the BARC (bleeding 
academic research consortium) criteria.34 In each trial a 
blinded clinical event committee adjudicated events 
(table B in appendix). Table C in the appendix reports 
endpoint definitions in each included trial.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
the design and implementation of the study. There are 
no plans to involve patients in dissemination.
statistical analysis
We report categorical variables as count and percent-
ages and compared them with a conditional regression 
analysis stratified by trial. Continuous variables are 
reported as means and standard deviation and were 
compared with a two way analysis of variance stratified 
by trial. We carried out an individual patient data 
meta-analysis with a one stage approach.
Results are reported as hazard ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals. We used a mixed effects Cox regression 
model that took into account the variation between tri-
als in baseline hazard and hazard ratios to derive an 
overall hazard ratio across trials (see supplementary 
methods in appendix).35 36 We used Cox regression for 
formal interaction testing to evaluate consistency of 
treatment effect between the groups with and without 
diabetes. Cumulative survival curves were constructed 
with the Kaplan-Meier model.
From the pooled patient level database, we also 
investigated all endpoints in the subgroup of patients 
with diabetes who were receiving treatment with insu-
lin. We also examined the risk of MACE with long term 
versus short term DAPT in prespecified subgroups: by 
clinical presentation (acute coronary syndrome or sta-
ble), age (<65 or ≥65), sex, and presence of multivessel 
disease.
As a sensitivity analysis, we compared long term ver-
sus short term DAPT for MACE, myocardial infarction, 
definite/probable stent thrombosis, and major or minor 
bleeding after censoring clinical events occurring 
before the landmark time point (landmark analyses at 
time of DAPT discontinuation) and excluding patients 
who prematurely discontinued DAPT (defined by stop-
ping at least one month before the period scheduled by 
randomisation, unless caused by an adverse event such 
as bleeding).
We performed a further sensitivity analysis including 
the two randomised controlled trials for which we did 
not have patient level data.37 38  In this case, we com-
pared ≤6 month versus 12 month DAPT in patients with 
and without diabetes for net clinical adverse events 
(NACE; defined as the composite of all cause death, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding) 
because the published data ffom these two randomised 
controlled trials only reported hazard ratios for this 
endpoint in patients with or without diabetes. We used 
a two stage approach for this analysis. We calculated 
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals from the 
individual patient data available from the six ran-
domised controlled trials and used the hazard ratios 
and risk ratios published in the subgroup analyses for 
the ISAR-SAFE and I-LOVE-IT 2 trials, respectively (see 
table E in appendix).37 
38 We then combined all the esti-
mates of effectiveness using standard meta-analysis 
methods.
We assessed heterogeneity with τ2 statistic, with val-
ues <0.04, 0.04-0.36, and >0.36 representing mild, mod-
erate, and severe heterogeneity, respectively.39
Values of P<0.05 were considered significant for all 
analyses. We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College 
Station, TX), R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria), and Reviewer Manager version 5.2 
(RevMan; Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen).
Results
Figure 1  shows the study population (the study flow 
diagram is shown in fig A in the appendix). Six trials 
were included in the final analysis, comprising PROD-
IGY,25  OPTIMIZE,26  EXCELLENT,27  RESET,28  SECU-
RITY,29  and ITALIC30  (tables A-C in appendix). Among 
these randomised controlled trials, two studies com-
pared 3 month with 12 month DAPT (RESET and OPTI-
MIZE), two studies compared 6 month with 12 month 
DAPT (EXCELLENT and SECURITY), and two studies 
compared 6 month with 24 month DAPT (PRODIGY and 
ITALIC) (fig 1). The risk of bias was generally low, 
although the treatment was open label in all trials, and 
SECURITY and ITALIC were stopped early because of 
recruitment problems (table D in appendix). When we 
checked the individual patient data, we did not identify 
any relevant issues undermining the data integrity.
Patient population
Among the 11 473 randomised patients identified, 3681 
(32.1%) had diabetes (mean age 63.7, SD 9.9), 7708 
(67
.2%) did not have diabetes (mean age 62.8, SD 11.0), 
and the information was missing in 84 (0.7%) (fig 1). 
Among patients with diabetes, 677 patients (mean age 
62.8, SD 10.1) were treated with insulin (18.4% of those 
with diabetes; 5.9% of the overall population). The 
numbers randomised to long term versus short term 
DAPT were, respectively, 1853 and 1828 in the group 
with diabetes, 340 and 337 in the group with diabetes 
treated with insulin, and 3848 and 3860 in the group 
without diabetes.
baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
long term and short term DAPT arms within the groups 
with and without diabetes (table 1). There were, how-
ever, distinct differences in almost every variable 
between patients with and without diabetes (table F in 
appendix). Patients with diabetes were older, 
more likely to be women, and had higher rates of

cardiovascular disease (hypertension, hypercholestero-
laemia, previous myocardial infarction, previous percu-
taneous coronary intervention, previous coronary 
artery bypass grafting, previous stroke, and renal dys-
function) than those without diabetes (table F in appen-
dix). Stable angina was more often the clinical 
presentation in both those with and without diabetes. 
Patients with diabetes had more extensive coronary 
artery disease, as evidenced by the higher number of 
diseased vessels, treated vessels and lesions, bifurca-
tion treatment, stents implanted, and longer total stent 
length but smaller stent diameter implanted (table F in 
appendix).
impact of diabetes on the primary endpoint
Diabetes (P=0.046), number of diseased vessels 
(P=0.004), and total stent length per patient (P=0.002) 
were independent predictors of MACE. Compared with 
patients without diabetes, those with diabetes had sig-
nificantly higher rates of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio 
2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 5.27; P=0.048) (fig 2).
long term v short term DaPt for primary endpoint 
according to diabetes status
The rates of MACE at one year were similar among 
patients treated with long term versus short term DAPT 
in each subgroup (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% confidence

, 0.67 to 1.39, P=0.85, τ2=0.06, for those with-
out diabetes; interaction P=0.33) (fig 3 , table 2).
Within the group of patients with diabetes, there 
were no significant differences in MACE between long 
term and short term DAPT at one year among prespeci-
fied subgroups (sex, age ≥65, acute coronary syndrome, 
multivessel disease) as well as in patients without dia-
betes (table 3 ). Even in subgroups there was no signifi-
cant interaction between diabetes and DAPT regimen 
(table 3).
bleeding events
There were no significant differences in terms of bleed-
ing in patients with or without diabetes (adjusted haz-
ard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 2.02; 
P=0.43) (fig 2; table G in appendix). Conversely, 12 
month DAPT was associated with a significantly higher 
rate of major or minor bleeding compared with short 
term DAPT in patients with diabetes (1.89, 1.10 to 3.27; 
P=0.02; τ2=0.02) and a non-significant increase in those 
without diabetes (1.43, 0.96 to 2.11; P=0.08; τ2=0.01; 
interaction P=0.37) (fig 3 , table 2). Major bleeding 
events were consistently increased with long term DAPT 
in both populations, though significantly only in 
patients without diabetes (1.72, 0.72 to 4.10, P=0.22, 
τ2=0.00, for those with diabetes; 2.56, 1.08 to 6.07, 
P=0.03, τ2=0.43, in those without diabetes; interaction 
P=0.69; table 2).
Other clinical outcomes
The risk of myocardial infarction was significantly 
increased among patients with diabetes compared with 
those without diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 3.66, 95% 
confidence interval 1.25 to 10.69; P=0.018), and it was 
the major determinant of the overall increase of MACE 
(table G in appendix). There were, however, no signifi-
cant differences in the risk of myocardial infarction 
between long term versus short term DAPT (0.95, 0.58 to 
1.54, P=0.82, τ2=0.03, for those diabetes; 1.15, 0.68 to 
1.94, P=0.60, τ2=0.19, for those without diabetes; inter-
action P=0.84; table 2).
The risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis was 
numerically but not significantly increased among 
patients with diabetes compared with those without 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 
0.31 to 11.38; P=0.49; table G in appendix). There was a 
reduction in the risk of definite/probable stent throm-
bosis with long term compared with short term DAPT 
among patients with diabetes but with severe heteroge-
neity (0.26, 0.09 to 0.80; P=0.02; τ2=0.47), whereas no 
such effect was observed in patients without diabetes 
(1.42, 0.68 to 2.98; P=0.35; τ2=0.00), with positive inter-
action testing (interaction P=0.04; table 2).
Table 2 (and table G in appendix) reports all other 
endpoints. No significant differences emerged between 
patients treated with long term versus short term DAPT 
in patients with and without diabetes.
sensitivity analyses
Consistent with the main analysis, rates of MACE were 
similar with long term or short term DAPT in both 
patients with and without diabetes in a landmark anal-
ysis in which we censored events encountered before 
DAPT discontinuation and excluding patients who 
stopped DAPT early (table H in appendix). This analysis 
confirmed the absence of differences observed in terms 
of myocardial infarction and the trend towards an 
increased risk of bleeding with DAPT for 12 months. In 
contrast with the main analysis, the rates of definite/
probable stent thrombosis showed a trend towards 
reduced event rates in both patients with and without 
diabetes treated with DAPT for 12 months compared 
with short term treatment.
The overall results suggesting similar outcomes with 
short term and long term DAPT, irrespective of diabetes 
status, were further confirmed when we carried out the 
meta-analysis including published results from the 
ISAR-SAFE38  and I-LOVE-IT 237 trials. The composite of 
all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major 
bleeding was similar between short term and long term 
DAPT in both patients with diabetes (5074 patients; 
hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.23; 
P=0.56; I2=12%; fig 4) and without diabetes (12 141 
patients; 0.99, 0.78 to 1.25; P=0.69; I2=15%; fig 4), with-
out significant heterogeneity between these subgroups 
(P=0.69; I2=0%; fig 4).

discussion
This patient level analysis of six randomised trials 
assessed clinical outcomes of long term versus short 
term DAPT in patients with or without diabetes. It 
showed that patients with diabetes, including those 
treated with insulin, had a higher baseline risk profile 
and showed an increased risk of MACE but not of 
 
bleeding, even after adjustment. Compared with short 
term DAPT, long term DAPT was associated with similar 
rates of MACE in patients with and without diabetes, 
although stent thrombosis was reduced. The risk of 
MACE did not differ across the prespecified subgroups 
of patients (by acute coronary syndrome, sex, multives-
sel disease, and age ≥65). Short term DAPT was associ-
ated with reduced risks of bleeding, irrespective of 
diabetes status.
To date, nine randomised controlled trials have 
looked at 3 or 6 months compared with 12 or more 
months of DAPT after implantation of a drug eluting 
stent.25-30 
37 
38 
40 To our knowledge, this is the first com-
prehensive study to explore the comparison of clinical 
outcomes of short term (≤6 months) with long term (12 
months) DAPT after drug eluting stent implantation 
according to diabetes status. The strength of our analy-
sis is represented by the inclusion of individual patient 
level data from a large patient population from six mul-
ticentre multinational randomised trials. Individual 
patient level meta-analysis overcomes important limita-
tions of study level meta-analysis and improves internal 
validity and allows for time to event, subgroup, and 
covariable adjusted analyses.
Drug eluting stents and DaPt
Compared with bare metal stents, drug eluting stents 
have consistently reduced the risk of restenosis and 
repeat revascularisation at the expense of safety con-
cerns because of an increase in late and very late stent 
thrombosis.41 
42  In particular, first generation drug elut-
ing stents were associated with a four to fivefold higher 
risk of late and very late stent thrombosis compared 
with bare metal stents, leading to the concept of “the 
longer the better” regarding duration of DAPT in 
patients with drug eluting stents. Of note, new genera-
tion stents have been shown to be safer in terms of stent 
thrombosis than both early generation stents and bare 
metal stents.43-45  Prolonged DAPT, however, is associ-
ated with increased risks of bleeding and death, as well 
as healthcare costs.3 
46 Therefore, the optimal duration 
is of paramount clinical relevance, although still a mat-
ter of debate.

Diabetes mellitus and DaPt
Diabetes mellitus is a key risk factor for atherosclerosis, 
disease progression, and restenosis during follow-up, 
particularly if patients are insulin dependent, even 
after coronary revascularisation.11 12 15-18  Notably, the 
detrimental metabolic state that accompanies diabetes 
is responsible for abnormalities in endothelial and 
platelet function that can contribute to accelerated ath-
erosclerosis and increase the risk of adverse cardiovas-
cular events.19 
20  A large body of evidence has described 
the role of increased platelet activity and adhesion in 
the progression of vascular complications observed in 
patients with diabetes, characterised by a high inci-
dence of cardiovascular events and lower antithrom-
botic efficacy of treatment with aspirin and 
clopidogrel.19 
20 Indeed, patients with diabetes mellitus 
might have a smaller than expected response to aspirin 
(because of accelerated renewal of platelets and alter-
ation of thromboxane pathway) and clopidogrel (the 
lower response to the drug in those with diabetes is 
mainly caused by abnormalities in the active metabolite 
pharmacokinetic profile, with only a minor contribu-
tion of platelet dysfunction related to the P2Y12 signal-
ling pathway). Therefore, the clinical translation of 
these findings could lead to the concept that prolonged 
DAPT in patients with diabetes might be the rational 
approach, although it has not been clearly demon-
strated.
A recent large observational study has suggested that 
extending the duration of clopidogrel treatment beyond 
12 months could decrease rates of very late death or 
myocardial infarction only in patients with diabetes 
who had been treated with a first generation drug elut-
ing stent compared with either patients without diabe-
tes or those who had other stent types, although the 
latter group had an overall event rate higher than 
patients with a drug eluting stent.21  This study, how-
ever, like other retrospective studies, has relevant lim-
itations, and appropriate adjustment is unlikely to 
eliminate selection bias.22 Randomised studies compar-
ing different DAPT regimens have provided results of 
subgroup analyses. Interestingly, some contrasting evi-
dence emerged from these analyses on the role of diabe-
tes, although dedicated studies on the impact of 
diabetes, including in patients treated with insulin, 
have not been published to date.
In the EXCELLENT trial, there was a significant inter-
action between diabetes status and duration of DAPT 
(interaction P<0.001) for the primary endpoint (com-
posite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or isch-
aemia driven target vessel revascularisation at 12 
months), with patients with diabetes having a signifi-
cant benefit with DAPT for 12 months compared with 6 
months, whereas patients without diabetes had a sig-
nificantly lower event rate with short term DAPT.27  Also 
the DAPT trial showed a significant interaction between 
diabetes and treatment arm (interaction P=0.01), 
although patients with diabetes did not benefit from 
prolonged DAPT (30 months) compared with patients 
without diabetes who experienced a lower risk of 
MACCE (major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovas-

myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis).46  The 
recent dedicated subanalysis of the DAPT trial showed 
that prolonged DAPT reduced the risk of myocardial 
infarction, but this benefit was attenuated in patients 
with diabetes compared with those without diabetes.47 
 
Similarly, in the DES-LATE, patients with diabetes 
showed a trend towards benefit from interrupting DAPT 
at 12 months, although the P value for interaction was 
borderline (P=0.07).48  Conversely, other trials, includ-

54 trial also confirmed the absence of potential signifi-
cant heterogeneity related to diabetes status.50  Indeed, 
consistent with the findings in patients without diabe-
tes, those with diabetes had long term benefits in terms 
of ischaemia and cardiovascular death but increased 
risk of bleeding with ticagrelor compared with placebo 
in addition to a background treatment with aspirin.50
Perspectives for clinical practice
Our study shows that compared with short term DAPT, 
long term DAPT does not provide benefits in terms of 
ischaemic protection but rather increases the risk of 
bleeding, irrespective of diabetes status. Although 
patients with diabetes are at increased risk for isch-
aemic events, and prolonged DAPT is often advised in 
these patients, our analysis indicates that prolonged 
treatment is not associated with improved outcomes 
among patients with stents with and without diabetes, 
even when we restricted the analysis to the subgroup of 
patients with diabetes treated with insulin (see supple-
mentary results in appendix). Although we observed a 
lower risk of definite/probable stent thrombosis with 
DAPT for 12 months in patients with diabetes, this find-
ing should be interpreted in the context of high 
 
heterogeneity between trials, hampering definitive con-
clusions; moreover the absence of consistent benefit in 
terms of composite endpoints of ischaemic events (add-
ing stent thrombosis to myocardial infarction or death 
(cardiac or all cause)) as well as at the landmark analy-
ses (in which we excluded events occurring in the first 
three to six months when both randomised treatments 
were, by study design, identical) was reassuring on the 
clinical implications of this small excess of stent throm-
bosis in such patients. On the contrary, the relevance of 
our overall findings should be interpreted in light of the 
baseline characteristics of the included patients, partic-
ularly concerning the risk of bleeding. Indeed, com-
pared with studies dedicated to patients with high risk 
(such as LEADERS-FREE with 18.6% of all bleeding and 
7
.3% of major bleeding (BARC type 3 or 5) at one year51), 
our study population can be considered at low risk 
given that the overall rate of major or minor bleeding 
events was about 1.5% at one year, of which major 
bleeding was 0.6% compared with 0.4%, 0.4%, 2.6%, 
0.7%, 0.9%, and 0.3% in RESET, EXCELLENT, PRODIGY, 
OPTIMIZE, SECURITY, and ITALIC trials, respectively. 
Furthermore, a recent meta-regression analysis of DAPT 
trials underlined the concept that in the contemporary 
era of drug eluting stents, bleeding has a stronger 
impact on mortality than stent thrombosis.5 In line with 
this, the absence of benefit at the expense of an 
increased risk of bleeding in patients with diabetes 
treated with long term compared with short term DAPT 
is relevant and underlines the opportunity to shorten 
DAPT in this subset of patients.
limitations
Our study shares limitations of other meta-analyses, 
although the analysis of patient level data mitigates 
some of them. As the six randomised controlled trials 
we included were not specifically designed to investi-
gate outcomes in the subgroup of patients with diabe-
tes, our study has intrinsic limitations of subgroup 
analyses and should be considered as hypothesis gen-
erating. The pooling of data, however, allowed us to 
obtain a large number of patients with diabetes 
(n=3681) as well as insulin treated diabetes (n=677) to 
be compared with patients without diabetes. Even 
though we collected individual data from randomised 
controlled trials, the post hoc nature of this analysis 
introduces biases. Furthermore, it remains unclear if 
our findings could be applicable to all patients with dia-
betes irrespective of its type (type 1 or 2) as this informa-
tion was not available.
The results described cannot be extended to all types 
of drug eluting stent because zotarolimus and everoli-
mus eluting stents were more commonly implanted. 
Similarly, as all patients received clopidogrel, our find-
ings could have differed if novel anti-platelet agents 
such as prasugrel or ticagrelor had been used. Defini-
tions of some clinical endpoints differed slightly across 
trials, potentially introducing effect modifiers. 
Although the meta-analysis of eight randomised con-
trolled trials confirmed the findings of short versus 
long term DAPT, this was conducted without patient 
level data from two randomised controlled trials, and 
net clinical adverse events was the only endpoint that 
we were able to analyse from the published data in the 
subgroups for diabetes status. Finally, most of the trials 
randomised patients at the time of the percutaneous 
coronary intervention or a month later, before the three 
to six months planned discontinuation of DAPT. Differ-
ences in events occurring within three to six months of 
DAPT are chance effects, but the sensitivity analysis 
that excluded those events confirmed the findings of 
the main analysis.
Conclusions
Although the presence of diabetes emerged as an inde-
pendent predictor of MACE, long term compared with 
short term DAPT did not reduce the risk of MACE but 
increased the risk of bleeding among patients with and 
without diabetes. This study might have relevant impli-
cations for clinicians and patients and could modify 
current daily clinical practice. A shorter DAPT regimen 
was found to be effective and safe in patients with and 
without diabetes. Diabetes per se should not be a driver 
for prolonging DAPT over the mandatory period after 
implantation of a drug eluting stent because of 
increased risks compared with potential benefits of this 
strategy. Future studies should be specifically designed 
and powered to deal with patients with diabetes and 
should explore the optimal duration of DAPT according 
to the type of diabetes and its medical management.
