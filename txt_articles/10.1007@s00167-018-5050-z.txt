Abstract
Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore the immediate effects of heavy isometric plantar flexor exercise on sensory 
output (pain during a functional task and mechanical pain sensitivity) and motor output (plantar flexor torque) in individuals 
with Achilles tendinopathy.
Methods Sixteen subjects with Achilles tendinopathy participated in the study, mean (SD) age 48.6 (8.9) years and Vic-
torian institute assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score 61.3 (23.0). Sensory testing assessing pain during a functional task, 
mechanical pain sensitivity and motor output, and plantar flexor peak torque was completed prior to the intervention. All 
subjects completed a 45-s heavy isometric plantar flexor contraction and were then re-tested using the same sensory and 
motor tests. Motor output was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry at speeds previously identified as of interest in subjects 
with Achilles tendinopathy.
Results Only 9 of the 16 subjects experienced pain during a functional task, self-reported pain was 4.2 (1.9) numerical 
rating scale (NRS) pre-intervention and 4.9 (3.2) NRS postintervention (n.s.). Mechanical pressure sensitivity was 446.5 
(± 248.5) g/mm2 pre-intervention and 411.8 (± 211.8) g/mm2 post-intervention (n.s.). Mean concentric plantar flexor torque 
at 90 and 225°/s was 47.1 (14.5) and 33.6 (11.6) Nm, respectively, pre-intervention and 53.0 (18.5) and 33.4 (6.6) Nm 
post-intervention (p = 0.039 and n.s.). Eccentric torque at 90°/s was 98.5 (34.2) Nm preintervention versus 106.0 (41.4) Nm 
post-intervention (n.s.).
Conclusion In this exploratory study, patients with Achilles tendinopathy had a varied sensory and motor output response 
to heavy isometric contractions. Using the recommended approach of heavy 45-s isometric contractions did not offer a 
meaningful acute benefit for sensory or motor output for subjects with Achilles tendinopathy. Based on this study, heavy 
45-s isometric contractions cannot be recommended for immediate pain relief or improved motor output for patients with 
Achilles tendinopathy.

Introduction
Successful treatment of Achilles and patella tendinopathy 
has for the last three decades focussed on eccentric resist-
ance training [1, 3, 15, 44]. Recent evidence has chal-
lenged the need for pure eccentric contractions and current 
recommendation is that heavy slow resistance exercise is 
of equal value and may even improve patient satisfaction 
[6, 26]. Evidence from systematic reviews supports these 
treatment options for both Achilles and patellar tendinopa-
thy [31, 43]. From 2015 to 2016, preliminary evidence 
from studies on patellar tendinopathy suggests an immedi-
ate improvement in pain after heavy isometric contractions 
and an improvement in motor output [40, 41]. Rio et al. 
used heavy isometric holds at 70% of maximal voluntary 
contraction (MVC) in athletes with patellar tendinopa-
thy and reported an immediate reduction in pain during a 
single-leg decline squat. Subject’s pain reduced from 7/10 
to 0/10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) and this pain 
reduction lasted for at least 45 min. Pain reductions of this 
magnitude and longevity have obvious benefits in clinical 
practice where individuals may then be able to participate 
in activities previously limited due to pain. The reported 
increases in motor output may also expedite a return to 
normal activities, the mechanism by which this may occur 
is thought to be a reduction in cortical inhibition [40].
In the most recent edition of Brukner and Khan’s 
“Clinical sports medicine: Injuries” there is a section 
highlighting isometric exercises as “stage 1” rehabilita-
tion for patients with Achilles tendon pain [10]. In this 
evidence-based sports medicine textbook, it is suggested 
that progression to stage 2 (isotonic exercises) should not 
be started until individuals are competent at isometrics 
and can sustain 45-s contractions steadily with an external 
load. In addition, it is also suggested that isometric plantar 
flexor exercises may increase motor output via a reduction 
of cortical motor inhibition [10, 39, 40, 48]. Research has 
yet to test whether isometric contractions have the ability 
to reduce pain and increase motor output immediately in 
patients with Achilles tendinopathy. It is important that 
new interventions are tested to ensure efficacy and effec-
tiveness prior to clinical implementation.
The purpose of this study was to explore the immediate 
effects of heavy isometric plantar flexor exercise on sensory 
output (pain during a functional task and mechanical pain 
sensitivity) and motor output (plantar flexor torque) in indi-
viduals with Achilles tendinopathy.
The hypothesis was that heavy isometric contractions of 
the plantar flexors will result in significant reductions in sub-
ject’s pain whilst increasing motor output.
Materials and methods
This is a prospective cohort study where outcome assess-
ments were performed at baseline and repeated immediately 
after the intervention. No comparator was used, and the study 
was considered exploratory, being the first to investigate the 
preliminary efficacy of this approach on self-reported pain, 
mechanical pressure pain thresholds and motor output when 
applied to the Achilles tendon. The reporting of the present 
study follows the STROBE and [49] TIDieR guidelines [20] 
supplemented with mechano-biological exercise descriptors 
suggested by Toigo & Boutellier [47].
Recruitment used a snowball sampling method and 
involved contacting local running clubs to identify individu-
als suffering from “Achilles tendon” pain [7]. Interested indi-
viduals were invited into the university to undergo a clinical 
examination to determine if they were eligible.
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of unilateral mid-
portion Achilles tendinopathy based on previously identi-
fied criteria, see Table 1, with symptoms for greater than 3 
months, minimum age of 18 with no upper age limit and an 
ability to give informed consent.
Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria was set to exclude Plantaris-induced 
Achilles tendinopathy, Paratendonitis, Fascia Crura tears, 
Longitudinal tears/splits or partial ruptures as these sub-
categories of Achilles tendinopathy are thought to be 
provoked by loading-based rehabilitation [32, 51]. The

assessment of these criteria was undertaken during a clin-
ical examination and ultrasound tissue characterization 
(UTC) (UTC imaging, The Netherlands) scan, at present 
there is debate around the diagnosis of these sub-catego-
ries but the consensus is that tears present with a sudden 
onset of pain [24, 33, 51]. Therefore, subjects with sudden 
onset of pain were excluded. Plantaris-induced tendinopa-
thy was diagnosed based on medial-sided-only Achilles 
tendon pain and UTC imaging confirming medial-located 
tendon changes in the absence of changes in other areas 
of the tendon. The UTC scan was completed and analysed 
by the same experienced user (S O’N) using previously 
identified protocols [16, 33]. Subjects with mild severity 
indicated by a Victorian institute of sports assessment: 
Achilles (VISA-A) score above 90 points were excluded 
[22].
Subjects were also excluded if they had received or were 
currently undergoing treatment for their tendinopathy or had 
other lower limb musculoskeletal, vascular or neurologi-
cal disorders. The exclusion of subjects who had or were 
already receiving therapy was to ensure selection bias was 
not introduced by including subjects experiencing failure or 
benefit of previous loading-based exercise therapy and to 
limit expectation bias in subjects.
Measures of sensory and motor output
Sensory output
Self-reported pain during a functional task Pain during an 
aggravating activity was considered the primary outcome 
based on the work by Rio et al. [40]. Assessment of load-
based tendon pain was based on routine clinical tests, pro-
gressing through greater loads. Reliability of this particular 
measurement strategy was not performed but these tests 
form part of the VISA-A which has been shown to be relia-
ble [22, 42]. All subjects initially completed 10 bilateral heel 
raises, if these were pain free they completed 10 unilateral 
heel raises, if these were pain free then 10 unilateral hops 
were completed, if subjects experienced pain at any time the 
test was stopped and subjects were asked to score their pain 
using an 11-point NRS with 0 being no pain and 10 being 
maximal imaginable pain [18]. All tests were completed on 
a flat surface and all subjects were required to move into 
end-range plantar flexion during the heel raises. If all tests 
were pain free, the subject was deemed to score 0. If sub-
jects completed all three tests without pain, further attempts 
to induce functional activity-related pain were not pursued, 
for ethical reasons. Pain score and the task and number of 
repetitions subjects completed were recorded, the same task 
was used post-intervention to determine whether their pain 
during a functional task had improved.
Mechanical pressure pain thresholds Mechanical pressure 
pain threshold was quantified using an electronic Von Frey’s 
device (Electronic Von Frey Anesthesiometer, IITC, USA), 
this tool has been shown to have good reliability, Lin coef-
ficient above 0.81 and is accurate to 1 g [46] The site of 
each subject’s pain was marked during the clinical examina-
tion based on the site of most tenderness on palpation. This 
area was where all mechanical pressure sensitivity readings 
were taken. The average of three readings was used for each 
measurement.
Motor output
Isokinetic dynamometry (Humac Norm, CSMI solutions, 
USA) utilised previously identified speeds and test posi-
tions [3, 4, 35]. The testing used an extended knee position 
(Fig. 1) rather than a flexed knee position as this position 
has greater test–re-test reliability, with the intra-class cor-
relation coefficient (ICC) between 0.70 and 0.87 [5]. Three 
test speeds were used in two different contraction modes. 
Concentric torque was measured in 90°/s and 225°/s and 
eccentric torque was measured at 90°/s [5].
The intervention
The intervention was based on previous work by Rio et al. 
[40, 41] and recommendations for Achilles tendinopathy 
[10] The intervention utilised five 45-s isometric plantar 
flexor contractions at 70% MVC—separated by 2-min rests 
in accordance with the protocol used for patellar tendi-
nopathy [10, 40, 41]. To determine subject’s 70% MVC all 
subjects had their MVC (isometric) measured using a Fysi-
ometer (Fysiometer ApS, Denmark) [19]. The Fysiometer

software utilises a sampling rate of 100hz which is filtered 
through a fourth-order Butterworth filter, the software has 
an accuracy of 0.1 kg on the whole measurement range from 
0 to 300 kg. The test–re-test ICC is 0.79, based on a study 
of 20 subjects completed at the university. Isometric force 
data were only used as a method to determine the interven-
tion threshold. Mean (SD) isometric force output during the 
pre-intervention was 101.9 kg (± 23.6), this equated to 127.7 
(± 29.4) percent of body weight (%BW). Isometric data were 
not measured post-intervention as it has not previously been 
shown to be relevant. The Fysiometer has previously been 
identified as a valid and reliable tool for quantifying maxi-
mal isometric plantar flexor muscle strength [19]. Each 
subject was carefully positioned with their heel over the 
nearside edge of the Wii platform and their metatarsals on 
the inside edge of the unit (Fig. 2). All subjects were seated 
on a plinth with the ankle positioned at 10° of plantar flex-
ion and the knee and hip at 90° flexion, a goniometer was 
used to verify these positions. The flexed knee position was 
utilised for the isometric intervention in this study as our 
previous work has identified that the Soleus muscle may be 
more involved in the motor deficits associated with Achilles 
tendinopathy and the area of the Achilles most commonly 
affected by tendinopathy appears to relate to fascicles linked 
to Soleus [13, 17, 45]. The subject’s own running trainers 
were worn for all testing to reduce any discomfort caused 
by the Wii platform. Subjects underwent a ramped series 
of plantar flexor contractions to establish their MVC, this 
consisted of three gradual contractions for familiarisation 
prior to three MVCs, with the peak force being recorded. 
Standardised verbal encouragement was offered to all sub-
jects during the MVC test. The peak MVC from this test 
was used to determine 70% MVC for the intervention. Real-
time visual feedback of contraction force was provided by 
the Fysiometer software, with force along the vertical axis 
and time along the horizontal axis, the subject’s contrac-
tion levels were represented as a bold trace between the two 
axes. The computer cursor was moved along the horizontal 
axis to help subjects visualise their 70% MVC target. Verbal 
encouragement was given when necessary, this allowed the 
subjects to modify their force output in real time ensuring 
they maintained a contradiction at 70% MVC for the dura-
tion of the test intervention.
The intervention was completed on the Fysiometer using 
the test position as described for the strength test. The 10 
degrees of plantar flexion was chosen as a manageable posi-
tion for all subjects as piloting of the test had revealed that 
some subjects cannot maintain a coordinated contraction in 
full plantar flexion without excessive muscle fasciculation. 
Excessive muscle fasciculation is not considered beneficial 
for tendinopathy and may re-enforce faulty motor patterning 
or be responsible for greater tendon loading [10, 36, 39]. 
The information given to all the subjects was standardised 
in an attempt to reduce any expectation bias, each subject 
had the same verbal statement given to them regarding the 
study “We are going to test a new exercise for Achilles ten-
don pain, an Australian group have shown this to be excel-
lent for knee tendons (patellar tendon pain) and we want 
to see if it helps Achilles tendon pain”. This statement was 
given by the same experienced physiotherapist and attempts 
were made to ensure the intonation, gramma and inflection 
were standardised across all subjects in an attempt to reduce 
the effect of non-specific treatment effects. No attempt was 
made to blind the subjects to the study hypothesis as it was 
made clear to them that the study was assessing whether 
isometric exercises affected their tendon pain and/or altered 
their motor output.
Ethical approval was granted by the University of Leices-
ter (UK) ethics board and consent was obtained from all 
participants before enrollment in the study, approval ID 
3989-so59-medical education.
Statistical analysis
A sample size estimation was completed based upon the 
NRS data from Rio et al. [40], which reported a reduc-
tion of 7 points after heavy isometric contractions; we,

therefore, anticipated a similar response in this study. The 
power was set as 80% with a two-tailed significance of 
5%; the calculation revealed a sample size of four sub-
jects would be required. A sample size calculation was 
also completed for isokinetic strength measures using 
previously published minimal detectable change (MDC) 
values, this estimate used the same power and significance 
levels [5]. The number of subjects varied between 6 and 
10 depending on which element of isokinetic strength 
was assessed—concentric or eccentric, respectively. To 
account for any subject failing parts of the testing, we 
aimed to include approximately 15 subjects.
Statistical analysis was completed to compare means 
at baseline to post-intervention. Data were found to be 
normally distributed using visual inspection of histograms 
and Shapiro–Wilks test. A paired t test was used as the 
data were normally distributed. The analyses aimed to 
explore if the intervention reduced pain sensitivity (pain 
during functional activity and mechanical pressure pain 
threshold) and altered motor output. Analyses were made 
using the available data (no imputations were made for 
missing data points); this was displayed graphically using 
the raw data.
Results
A total of 20 individuals responded to the study invita-
tion, 19 attended for examination and one was unable to 
arrange a suitable appointment. All subjects were exam-
ined; two subjects were excluded as they did not have a 
diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. A further subject was 
excluded as their Achilles tendinopathy was considered 
to be related to Plantaris involvement. The decisions to 
exclude subjects were made prior to collecting data. In 
total, 16 individuals (5 female) met the inclusion criteria. 
Demographic data regarding subjects can be viewed in 
Table 2.
Sensory output
Self-reported pain during a functional task
Only 9 of the 16 participants reported pain during either 
heel raises (bilateral or unilateral) or hopping on the day of 
examination. The mean change in self-reported pain dur-
ing a functional task is shown in Table 3 and the individual 
responses for all subjects are shown in Fig. 3a, these changes 
were not significant. Since some subjects did not experience 
pain during functional testing it was deemed appropriate to 
assess for differences in baseline variables to determine if 
there was an explanation for this difference. No between-
group differences where identified for any variable when 
comparing those with self-reported pain on functional test-
ing and those without except VISA-A score where it was 
observed those with pain during functional testing had a 
lower (worse) score [54.3 (± 15.8)] compared with those 
without pain on functional testing [70.3 (± 9.3)].

Discussion
The most important finding of the present study is the lack of 
pain relief with heavy 45-s isometric plantar flexor contrac-
tions and the identification of a variable response with some 
subjects having minor benefit and others significantly worsen-
ing. It is important to acknowledge this is the first study exam-
ining the immediate effects of heavy 45-s isometric plantar 
flexor contractions on sensory and motor output in individu-
als with Achilles tendinopathy. The results demonstrate that 
subjects who experienced pain during the functional tests did 
not experience a statistically significant change in pain as a 
result of the intervention at a group level. The graphical repre-
sentation (Fig. 3A) highlights the individual responses to the 
intervention with those with higher NRS scores experiencing 
an increase in pain. Individuals with the highest NRS scores 
appeared to be worsened whilst those below the mean had 
some benefit. Subject’s with lower NRS scores (< 4) expe-
rienced reductions in pain, but only of 1 point. A reduction 
of 2 points has previously been identified as being the mini-
mally important clinical difference, questioning whether the 
observed change can be considered clinically important [18]. 
The functional tests were not painful for all subjects, with only 
nine individuals being symptomatic with the tests.
The mean mechanical pressure pain thresholds did not 
alter significantly, but individual variations were observable 
with changes occurring in both directions. The reliability 
of pressure pain threshold has been shown to be “good” in 
patella tendinopathy [52] but has not been examined for 
Achilles tendinopathy. To our knowledge, there is no previ-
ous identification of the minimum clinically important dif-
ference (MCID) for mechanical pressure sensitivity for the 
Achilles tendon. MCID is the minimal amount by which a 
measurement needs to change to be considered clinically 
meaningful for a patient. The lack of predetermined MCID 
makes it difficult to consider whether some individuals 
may have experienced a meaningful change in mechanical 
pressure sensitivity. Mean motor output did not change for 
plantar flexor concentric 225°/s or eccentric 90°/s torque; 
however, there was a statistical change in concentric 90°/s 
torque. Despite mean concentric plantar flexor torque at 
90°/s increasing by a statistically significant value, this value 
did not exceed the MDC of the measure (12.7 Nm) and is, 
therefore, unlikely to represent an actual measurable change 
[5]. Visual inspection of Fig. 3c shows that only two subjects 
improved above the MDC, suggesting these individuals had 
meaningful changes to motor output. Rio et al. previously 
reported increased motor output post-isometric loading, our 
results contrast with theirs as the changes in motor output 
were not statistically significant except for the concentric 
90°/s measurement and this did not exceed the MDC and, 
therefore, does not represent an actual change in force. This 
lack of a response may be because cortical excitation is pre-
sent in Achilles tendinopathy [8] as opposed to the cortical 
inhibition observed in patella tendinopathy [40]. The find-
ings of this study suggest that isometric exercises do not 
acutely alter either self-reported pain during a functional 
task, mechanical pressure pain thresholds or motor output 
to a statistically or clinically relevant extent.
The different results observed for patellar and Achilles 
tendinopathy [5, 40] may be due to the different tendons 
under examination or the uncertainty and lack of statistical 
robustness from preliminary studies including very few sub-
jects. However, our findings are similar to those of Coombes 
et al. [12] who examined the effects of two different levels of 
isometric exercise for lateral epicondylalgia. Their findings 
suggested that the response to isometric exercise is highly 
individual as can be observed in our study. This highlights 
that caution should be applied in suggesting widespread 
clinical implementation and usage of isometric treatment 
of tendinopathy in general, and in Achilles tendinopathy 
particularly, when we already have treatments with level 1 
evidence of long-term effectiveness [25, 27, 31, 43, 50].
Only a subgroup of our subjects (9/16) experienced pain 
during their functional examination, this is not uncommon 
as subjects with Achilles tendinopathy have often reduced 
their aggravating activities prior to examination. It is also 
possible that our testing program, with the maximum tendon 
load being unilateral hops, was not sufficient to trigger pain 
in these subjects. However, it was considered unethical to 
induce tendon pain using greater loads, i.e. 5-km run.
Methodological considerations and limitations
Despite the chosen test position negatively affecting gastroc-
nemius force production [5, 9, 14, 23], subjects were able to 
generate mean isometric forces of 127.7% BW (± 29.4). This 
level of force production is important as current proponents 
of heavy isometric interventions for tendinopathy suggest 
heavy loads are crucial for analgesia [10, 39]. Higher loads 
would not have been achieved using extended knee posi-
tions for the intervention as our previous work on runners 
with and without Achilles tendinopathy found peak torque 
occurred in flexed knee positions rather than the expected 
knee extended positions. That is evidenced in this study 
when a comparison of the concentric and eccentric torque 
values is made with the isometric data, this shows greater 
forces occurred during the isometric test (flexed knee) ver-
sus the isokinetic test (extended knee). It would be possible 
to use different ankle positions but this would limit force 
production further and, therefore, tendon load and motor 
cortex drive as the muscle unit would be moved away from

mid-range, a position where most muscles generate peak 
force. Increased dorsiflexion would cause some degree of 
compression of the Achilles insertion and possibly produce 
pain limiting subject’s ability to maintain a 70%MVC in this 
position. Due to these elements, test positions of 5–10° plan-
tar flexion are probably most useful. Our study clearly high-
lights that despite heavy isometric loads through the Achilles 
tendon, subject’s experienced limited analgesic responses.
The findings of this study are limited to mid-portion 
Achilles tendinopathy and the intervention protocol tested. 
Different muscle activation thresholds (%MVC), and test 
positions (knee and ankle) may produce different effects; 
however, it would be unclear why this may be the case. The 
current suggestion for isometrics is they should be very heavy 
and in positions where the tendon has little compression, both 
aspects being adhered to in the protocol used. However, it 
is also possible that different tendons respond in different 
ways, particularly the Achilles and patella, where tendi-
nopathy causes different tissue changes: the patella becomes 
stiffer whilst the Achilles becomes less stiff, this may affect 
the response to isometric loading [11]. It may be the differ-
ent sub-categories of Achilles tendinopathy excluded from 
this study would also respond differently to the intervention. 
However, the group of participants included in this study rep-
resents the typical patient with Achilles tendinopathy seen in 
sports medicine/physiotherapy departments [2, 3, 6, 29, 30].
Other than the differences in the tendon under examination 
there are large differences in the ages of the populations within 
the studies. The study on lateral epicondylalgia by Coombes 
et al. [12] included subjects with a mean age of 52.0 years 
while the studies by Rio et al. [40, 41] on patella tendinopathy 
included subjects with a mean age of 26.9 and 22.5 years. The 
current study included subjects with a mean age of 48.6 years. 
Whilst the ages differ across the studies they reflect the typi-
cal age groups afflicted by the different tendinopathies. It is 
conceivable that age or other variables we are as yet unaware 
of may explain the observed differences in outcome. However, 
since the present study utilised typically afflicted patients (age, 
presentation and disability) it is possible to conclude that iso-
metric loads seem to offer little promise for immediate analge-
sia in the typical Achilles tendinopathy patient.
Conclusion
In this exploratory study, patients with Achilles tendinop-
athy had a varied sensory and motor output response to 
heavy 45-s isometric contractions. Using the recommended 
approach of heavy isometric contractions did not offer a 
meaningful acute benefit for sensory or motor output in the 
majority of the included subjects with Achilles tendinopathy. 
Based on data from the present study, heavy 45-s isometric 
contractions cannot be recommended for immediate pain 
relief or improved motor output as first-stage rehabilitation 
for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
