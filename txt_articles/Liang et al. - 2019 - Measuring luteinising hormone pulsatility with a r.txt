Normal reproductive functioning is critically dependent on pulsatile secretion of luteinising
hormone (LH). Assessment of LH pulsatility is important for the clinical diagnosis of
reproductive disorders, but current methods are hampered by frequent blood sampling
coupled to expensive serial immunochemical analysis. Here, we report the development and
application of a Robotic APTamer-enabled Electrochemical Reader (RAPTER) electrochemical
analysis system to determine LH pulsatility. Through selective evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment (SELEX), we identify DNA aptamers that bind specifically to LH and
not to related hormones. The aptamers are integrated into electrochemical aptamer-based
(E-AB) sensors on a robotic platform. E-AB enables rapid, sensitive and repeatable deter-
mination of LH concentration profiles. Bayesian Spectrum Analysis is applied to determine LH
pulsatility in three distinct patient cohorts. This technology has the potential to transform the
clinical care of patients with reproductive disorders and could be developed to allow real-time
in vivo hormone monitoring.

ormal reproductive function is governed by a highly
orchestrated pattern of hormonal feedback across the
hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. The pulsa-
tile release of luteinising hormone (LH) is a critical element for
downstream regulation of sex steroid hormone synthesis and the
production of mature oocytes1. Altered patterns of LH pulse
secretion have been linked to hypothalamic dysfunction, resulting
in numerous reproductive disorders, including polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS)2, hypothalamic amenorrhoea3 and delayed or
precocious puberty4.
It is not currently feasible in routine clinical practice to mea-
sure LH pulsatility to determine altered secretion patterns because
to do so is extremely resource intensive. Peripheral blood sam-
pling is necessary every 10 min for at least 8 h, and serial analysis
by immunochemical assay is expensive5,6. Most of the data
measuring LH pulsatility are therefore in animals, including
rodents, sheep and monkey7–9 or in some human studies from
specialist clinical research groups10,11. There are three major
issues currently preventing widespread clinical LH concentration
profile measurement and its pulsatility analysis: (1) LH con-
centration profile’s resolution is restricted by the sampling pro-
tocol and immunochemical assay—there is no method capable of
real-time monitoring of LH pulsatility. (2) Measurement of LH
concentration profile is restricted by cost when serial clinical
chemiluminescent immunoassays are used (~£20 per sample,
50 samples required for one patient). (3) LH pulsatility analysis is
challenging as it typically requires advanced algorithms that can
appropriately and efficiently account for the inherent biological
variation, pulse-by-pulse variability and physiological factors
impacting on hormone secretion and calculation, including
elimination12. There is a clear unmet medical need for better
translational technologies that could enable routine clinical LH
pulsatility analysis for patients with reproductive disorders.
Better technologies for hormone sensing, that could in the
future be adapted for continuous sensing as an individual under-
goes their normal daily routine, would revolutionise the clinical
care of patients with reproductive disorders. Glucose monitoring
has transformed diabetes care13, and similarly, intrinsic chemical
reactivities of lactate14 and neurotransmitters15–17 such as dopa-
mine, serotonin, glutamate and acetylcholine using specific
enzymes for detection have had significant impact. However, such
detection approaches are not generalisable for larger peptides,
hormones and proteins such as LH, as they all depend on specific
enzymes recognising particular small-molecule metabolites18.
Antibodies have been the mainstay for quantification of larger
molecules in molecular diagnostics for decades, yet have serious
challenges for repeated sensing operations (not easy to be regen-
erated), and so are not suitable for continuous sensing applications
necessary for hormone monitoring. The emerging technology of
electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensing could potentially
offer a generalisable approach for LH pulsatility measurement.
E-AB sensors take advantage of the intrinsic properties of
nucleic acid aptamers to specifically bind to a molecular target
and undergo a reversible conformational change. The con-
formational change can be measured through the electrochemical
signal response, governed by distance between an electrochemical
reporter covalently linked to the aptamer and a gold sensor
surface. Binding events can be indicated by a change in the
electrochemical signal either in a current or an impedance for-
mat19. E-AB sensors are also relatively straightforward to proto-
type from development to a device20. Continuous sensing of drug
pharmacokinetics using an E-AB sensor has been demonstrated
in living animals21,22, although not yet in humans. The coupling
of easily modified aptamers together with rapid prototyping
technologies enables E-AB sensors to be developed for different
applications. E-AB sensors neither require washing, separations,
chromatographic steps, nor expensive equipment, so are excellent
choices as an approach for continuous, low-cost sensing that in
future could be adaptable for in vivo sensing of numerous
hormones.
To this end, we develop an LH-specific aptamer and engi-
neered it for specific electrochemical sensing in a robotic plat-
form. Using this robotic platform, we analyse patient samples
from three different patient cohorts with distinct LH pulsatility
profiles to determine LH concentration and then used Bayesian
spectrum analysis (BSA) to analyse LH pulsatility23,24. This
approach demonstrates promise for enabling more widespread
LH pulsatility analysis in clinical practice, and lays a foundation
for future in vivo E-AB-based hormone monitoring. This tech-
nology could be applied using a similar approach to the in vivo
continuous measurement of other hormones that would revolu-
tionise the diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocrine
disorders.
Results
The aptamer-enabled electrochemical robotic platform. In
order to address the challenges of clinical LH monitoring, we
designed an aptamer-enabled electrochemical robotic platform
based on the integration of multiple technologies. The platform
consists of a potentiostat, a laptop interface, an open-source
programmable robotic platform and a customised 96-well plate
electrochemical sensing system embedded with an LH aptamer
sensor (Fig. 1a). We designed a 96-well-plate assay system that
allows the automation of continuous testing of patient samples
under the open-source robotic platform with a rapid measure-
ment interval time of 50 s for each sample. The key component of
this assay system is the wire electrode functionalised with an LH
aptamer labelled with an electrochemical reporter. The quantifi-
cation of the LH level is achieved by analysing the electron
transfer kinetic changes upon binding of LH via a three- micro-
wire electrode system held with a 3D-printed part (Fig. 1a). Only
50 µl of sample is required for the measurement, and LH con-
centration profile can be generated from the signal response of
the potentiostat. The pulse interval information can then be
extracted using a BSA method to enable identification of LH
pulsatility. Three individual patients LH concentration profiles
are shown in Fig. 1c (red, menopausal woman—high LH levels
with pulsatility; blue, healthy female—normal LH pulsatility; grey,
female patient with hypothalamic amenorrhoea (HA) patient—
reduced LH levels and pulsatility). The BSA method identified
their pulse interval ranges.
Developing a high-affinity LH-specific aptamer. The LH apta-
mer was generated via a nitrocellulose-membrane-based SELEX
method (Fig. 2a). In order to obtain a highly specific LH aptamer,
we applied counter selection against follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), a glycoprotein sharing a structural similarity with LH.
Both LH and FSH share the same ɑ-chain and hence it is
necessary to evolve an aptamer that can differentiate between the
two through interactions with the β-chain or at the interface
between the two subunits. The gel electrophoresis image after
each round of selection was used to monitor the selection process.
Twenty rounds of selection were performed before sequencing.
We obtained eight major sequences. B10, B11 and B35 only
showed one base variation between them. Enzyme-linked oligo-
nucleotide assay (ELONA) was used to screen the DNA aptamers
for their affinity in binding to LH (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
concentration–response curve obtained by ELONA of the best
LH-binder aptamer B23 is shown in Fig. 2b. No significant FSH
interaction was observed. The apparent equilibrium dissociation
constant (KD) was estimated to be 321 nM. Further cross-reaction

 studies were conducted to investigate the specificity of B23
aptamer against multiple proteins using ELONA and electro-
phoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 2c). No significant
nonspecific interactions were observed in either assay. A clear
concentration–response relation was observed in the EMSA gel.
We also performed DNA–protein interaction study using surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) to investigate the binding kinetics of
LH and B23 aptamer. SPR response data from a titration study
were fitted to a 1:1 binding model (Supplementary Fig. 2). The
estimated Koff was 1.2 × 10−3 s−1. It is a relatively fast off-rate
(slow off-rates are normally < 10−5 s−1). This feature benefits a
continuous sensing-format design by allowing fast regeneration.
A circular dichroism (CD) study of B23 investigated the con-
formational change dynamics upon binding of LH. Figure 2d
shows the CD spectra before and after adding 1 μM LH in buffer.
The negative peak at 240 nm becomes more negative and the
positive peak at 280 nm increases after binding, providing evi-
dence of a structure-switching conformational change of the
aptamer upon LH binding. This feature is important as in the
electrochemical biosensor design, conformational change is nee-
ded to generate the signal change on target binding.
A wire electrode system for LH sensing. We applied the
Methylene Blue (MB)-modified B23 aptamer onto a wire-based
three-electrode system. This system consists of wires (diameters
ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm) with different materials (working: Au,
reference: Ag/AgCl, counter: Pt). All of the electrodes were
wrapped by PVC insulation tape with 5 mm left at the detection
end and the soldering end, and epoxy was used to seal the con-
nection parts to avoid water leakage. All of the electrodes were
assembled into a 3D-printed holder that fits a single well of a 96-
well plate whilst avoiding electrical shorting, allowing enough
space for tip positioning (Fig. 3a). Target binding induces a
conformational change in the LH aptamer that alters the rate of
electron transfer between the MB and the electrode. This change
is expected to produce a readily measurable variation in current at
the MB reduction peak when the sensor is interrogated using
square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The relative change in the
current therefore provides a direct measurement of LH con-
centration. The cleaning for the electrode was achieved by repeat
cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning in 0.5 M H2SO4 to remove
impurity layers (Fig. 3b). Since the relative change of this current
is highly dependent on SWV frequency, we interrogated the

Fig. 1 Overview of the Robotic APTamer-enabled electrochemical reader (RAPTER). a RAPTER design. RAPTER consists of a potentiostat, laptop interface,
open-source liquid-handling robot and the 96-well-plate sensing platform. The quantification of the LH level is achieved by analysing the electron transfer
kinetic changes (interrogated via square-wave voltammetry (SWV)) upon binding of LH under a three microwire electrode system held within a 3D-printed
holder. b A series of samples can be loaded onto the 96-well platform, and the measurement process can be automated by the programmable liquid-
handling robot. Serum samples collected from frequent blood sampling analysed by the immunochemical test (antibody test) were used as a comparison
with test RAPTER performance in measuring LH concentration in human clinical samples. c The time-course data (LH concentrations at 10-min intervals over
8 h) can be further analysed by BSA to identify pulse intervals (and their likelihood) and to classify patients. Source data are provided as a Source Data file

 sensor at multiple SWV frequencies. We observed a signal off
response in the majority of frequencies we tested (from 10 to
500 Hz), and a signal on response below 10 Hz (Fig. 3c). As it
requires more than 50 s for the potentiostat to perform SWV scan
of frequencies below 10 Hz, we decided to use 100 Hz in the signal
off range as the optimal frequency for LH measurement. The
detailed electrochemical characterisation of the electron transfer
rate can be found in the Supplementary materials (Supplementary
Fig. 3). We investigated the sensor’s performance for LH detec-
tion using the SWV parameters optimised for maximising the
gain. The signal change upon adding spiked LH in PBS buffer was
fitted to a Langmuir isotherm and a KD of 259 nM was obtained.
The sensor achieved a limit of detection (LOD) in PBS buffer of
10.9 nM, with a dynamic range of 5–500 nM. Furthermore, a high
concentration of FSH (1 μM) did not affect the sensor (Fig. 3d, e).
Robustness of RAPTER in undiluted clinical serum samples.
We further engineered the wire system to a robotic platform for
the assay automation. Electrodes were assembled into a custom-
designed 3D-printed electrode holder to avoid electrical shorting
and contact with the pipette tips while performing the mea-
surement and wash steps (Fig. 1b). The liquid-handling robot

 pre-programmed

to

individual
experimental
requirements. Simple Python commands control automation of
the assay steps (Fig. 1b, right). We investigated the signal
response and sensor regeneration performance of RAPTER using
serum samples from patients diagnosed with hypothalamic
amenorrhoea (who have no LH/suppressed LH secretion). We
performed both CV and SWV on the undiluted serum samples.
In the cyclic voltammogram shown in Fig. 4a, we observed a
potential shift from −0.24 to −0.28 V, and the H2O oxidation
became weaker (the negative tail of the blue curve became shorter
in the red curve). This indicates adsorption of proteins in the
serum onto the electrode surface. However, in the square-wave
voltammogram presented in Fig. 4b, there was no obvious signal
reduction, but a significant peak shift corresponding to the CV
study from −0.24 to −0.28 V. This indicates that nonspecific
absorption does not change the aptamer structure. Regeneration
performance was also evaluated by applying the maximum con-
centration (500 nM) of added LH to a serum sample from a
patient with hypothalamic amenorrhoea (these patients have very
low LH levels). The signal can be regenerated to more than 93%
at concentrations under 500 nM. However, when we applied the
LH concentration at saturation levels (5000 nM), we failed to
recover the sensor (Fig. 4c). The concentration–response curve
and LOD were also investigated using an added LH clinical
sample. As can be seen in Fig. 4d, a KD of 358 nM was obtained,
with a similar LOD (10.7 nM) and dynamic range (1–500 nM)
achieved with added LH in PBS buffer. This is within the LH
range in human blood sample excluding the LH-surge period (we
converted our result in nM into IU/L according to 96/602 stan-
dard reference, 1 IU/L equals ~5.6 nM). We also performed a
pilot study to ensure RAPTER performance in six human samples
with known different LH values (ranging from 3.7 to 29.9 IU/L).
The results detected by RAPTER are comparable with the results
determined by immunochemical assay (Fig. 4e).
Comparison of RAPTER and clinical immunochemical assay.
Having shown that RAPTER can reliably operate with clinical,
undiluted patient samples, a larger-scale evaluation was per-
formed using 441 serum samples from three patient cohorts
known to have different LH concentrations and pulsatility pro-
files as a proof-of-concept experiment (each participant had
49 samples, measured every 10 min during an 8-h study). The
three patient cohorts were young fertile females with normal
menstrual cycles (normal LH pulsatility and LH range 2–8 IU/L),
menopausal women (disordered LH pulsatility with high LH
levels range 15–70 IU/L), and women with hypothalamic ame-
norrhoea (suppressed or absent LH pulsatility with very low LH
levels range 0–2 IU/L). Sampling was performed every 10 min for
8 h to collect a sufficient amount of blood for both RAPTER and

 immunochemical assay. The same patient samples were analysed
using both the current gold standard clinical method for mea-
surement of LH and FSH (immunochemical assay) and RAPTER
for comparison. The RAPTER assay was performed using the
setup illustrated in Fig. 5a. Two 96-well plates were used for each
patient (49 samples). RAPTER runs the measurement pro-
gramme with a set waiting time to synchronise the SWV mea-
surement initiated by the potentiostat’s software interface.
All obtained LH concentrations for both RAPTER and clinical
immunochemical assay can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 4. To
compare the methods, we performed a Bland–Altman analysis
and plotted the linear regression. The RAPTER assay shows a
good overall correlation with the clinical immunochemical assay
(R2 = 0.94) (Fig. 5c). We also demonstrated the high specificity of
RAPTER for LH measurement in these clinical samples as in the
menopause cohort, all patients show higher FSH values compared
with LH (measured by the immunochemical assay) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5). We then inferred, using BSA, the effective LH pulse
interval from both datasets (immunochemical assay and RAPTER
assay).

and Fig. 5g–i shows the corresponding results of the BSA analysis
in the form of posterior probability distribution of the LH pulse

based on the time interval ranges. Menopause patients had higher
amplitude pulses.
Discussion
We have presented a method for LH concentration measurement
that is automated, reusable and low cost, and in future could be
adapted for continuous sensing. As a proof-of-concept, we
determined LH concentration in clinical patient samples with
variable reproductive function, including menopausal women
with high LH values, normal fertile women with normal levels of
LH and women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea who had sup-
pressed levels of LH. Our results demonstrate that RAPTER not
only has comparable performance to the current gold standard
clinical immunochemical system but also can compete with lower
cost, lower reagent use and simpler setup (no extra reagents
needed for each concentration point measurement). Furthermore,
the RAPTER was able to detect the change in pulsatile LH
secretion as reflected by the appropriate measurement of variable
levels of LH within a patient’s 8-h clinical study and with sub-
sequent confirmation by BSA analysis. A similar distribution was
achieved irrespective of whether clinical assay or RAPTER LH
concentrations were used for analysis. This offers strong evidence
for this platform’s potential clinical utility in pulsatile hormone
measurement. Also, the platform is highly adaptable for multi-
plexing or implanting for continuous monitoring. Multiple
single-wire electrodes would be highly adaptable for multiplex
hormone measurements in a single sample. A wire electrode may
also be integrated with an automated blood collection system for
hormone pulsatility measurement in real time25,26. Furthermore,
E-AB in vivo continous sensing for small molecules has already
been achieved in awake and ambulatory animals27, which also
shows potential for our system after further refinement of the
sensing performance in whole blood.
E-AB continuous sensors have been reported to have a signal
drift issue when performing the test in whole-blood samples27.

 drift-free electrochemical interrogation30. However, these meth-
ods are highly dependent on each aptamer’s intrinsic properties.
Therefore, a suitable pulse analysis method is critical. BSA is well
suited to analysing pulsatile hormonal dynamics, since it allows
for automated drift model selection without the need to pre-
process the data23,24.
There is currently no aptamer-based LH sensing technology.
Clinical assay platforms such as Roche’s Cobas™, Siemens Cen-
taur™ and Abbott’s Architect™ provide antibody-based automated
hormone assay options6. Lateral flow test strips using gold
nanoparticle-labelled antibody and signal enhancers for single LH
point measurements in urine for ovulation detection are also
available31. The LH aptamer described herein offers a valuable
sensing reagent for LH detection. The biophysical and bio-
chemical characterisation of the LH aptamer demonstrates three
beneficial features: (1) high binding affinity for LH and no sig-
nificant off-target binding to the related molecules; (2) a binding-
dependent conformational change; (3) a relatively fast off-rate.
The RAPTER utilises these features of the aptamer to perform LH
pulsatility measurement. Clinical results were consistent with the
specificity of the LH aptamer for LH over FSH, as the system still
worked well in menopause samples where FSH levels are sig-
nificantly higher than LH levels.
Taken together, the RAPTER system provides an efficient
approach for LH pulsatility determination by reliably calculating
varying LH concentrations within an 8-h patient study that may

 be both adaptable to other hormones and for a fully continuous
sensing system. Future work will focus on the applicability and
generalisability of this approach for continuous hormone sensing
that would revolutionise the diagnosis and treatment of patients
with endocrine disorders.
Methods
Nitrocellulose membrane-based SELEX. LH-specific aptamer was generated via a
nitrocellulose-membrane-based SELEX method. The SELEX was started by incu-
bation of recombinant hLH (Serna, USA) with a 75-nt long ssDNA library flanked
with two primer regions. The nitrocellulose membrane was used to capture the
ssDNA-LH-bound complex, and the selected ssDNA was eluted by heating the
membrane in water at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluted sequences were amplified using a
Pfx DNA polymerase amplification kit with a 3′-biotinylated primer. The double-
stranded DNA PCR product was applied to streptavidin magnetic beads for the
separation of non-biotinylated single-stranded DNAs from their complementary
biotinylated strand. The beads were pre-washed three times by the 1× binding and
wash (B&W) buffer recommended in the product protocol. After the pre-wash
step, 95 μL of PCR product and 2 μL of 2× B&W buffer was then added to the
beads and mixed for 30 min at room temperature on a rotating platform. The
mixture was then applied to a magnet and the supernatant was removed. The
selected single-stranded DNA sequences were separated from their complementary
strands (with a biotin-modified 5′ end) by incubating with 50 μL of 0.1 M NaOH
and eluting after 5 min. In total, 150 μL of binding buffer was then added and the
DNA concentration was measured with a Nanodrop-2000. Counter-selection
rounds against FSH were carried out after the 5th, 10th and 15th round of the
selection. In these selection rounds, FSH was used instead of LH for the incubation
and only the filtrate from the nitrocellulose-membrane filtration step was collected
for the remaining steps. The last round of the selection Round 20, was chosen for
cloning and sequence analysis. The Round 20 pool was amplified with unmodified
primers and purified using the PCR clean-up system (Qiagen). The product was
cloned into a PCR Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli
DH 5-alpha competent cells via heat shock. Forty colonies of each pool were picked
and purified using the mini-prep kit (Qiagen). In total, 40 samples were prepared
and sequenced (Techdragon). All the sequence data collected were aligned using
Vector NTI Advanced 11.1 (Invitrogen) and the secondary structure was predicted
by MFold with the solution set according to the selection buffer.
Biochemical and biophysical characterisation of the aptamer. ELONA was
performed for four different selection rounds (Round 3, Round 7, Round 15 and
Round 20). In total, 160 ng of LH and FSH in 100 μL of selection buffer were
separately coated on each well of the 96-well plates overnight at 4 ℃ separately.
After blocking with PBS Tween-20 (PBST) buffer with 1% BSA for 1 h at room
temperature, the wells were washed three times with the selection buffer. A bio-
tinylated complementary strand for the 5′-end primer region was annealed to the
Round 3, Round 7, Round 15 and Round 20 pools. These biotinylated pools with
different concentrations (1 μM, 500 nM and 50 nM) were added to the LH-coated
wells/FSH-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following three
washes, streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to each
well. The plate was incubated for 30 min and washed with 0.1% BSA PBST buffer.
In total, 50 μL of TMB was then added to the wells and incubated for 30 min. By
adding 10 μL of 1 M H2SO4, the reaction was quenched and the binding complexes
were quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm in a microplate reader. The
further characterisation of the six aptamer candidates was performed using a
similar ELONA setup but with different ranges of aptamer concentration for the
titration. The last selection pool Round 20 was tested for its binding affinity to LH
using an EMSA. The sample pool was prepared by magnetic bead-based ssDNA
generation after the amplification of the Round 20 library. In total, 0.2 μM Round
20 ssDNA pool was then incubated with increasing concentrations of LH and FSH
from 0.85 to 6.8 μM in a total volume of 10 μL at room temperature. After 1 h of
incubation, the samples were resolved by double-layer non-denaturing poly-
acrylamide gels (6% polyacrylamide for stacking and 12% polyacrylamide for
resolving) containing 1× TBE buffer. The gel was stained with SybrGold for 30 min
and imaged on the GelDocTM XR + system (Bio-Rad). The further characterisation
of the B23 aptamer candidate was performed using a similar EMSA protocol, but
with a different range of aptamer concentrations for the titration. In total, 1 µM of
B23 was immobilised onto a plain gold chip in an overnight incubation at room
temperature. After the immobilisation, 1 mL of 2 mM MSA was used to block the
unoccupied binding sites on the gold surface. The plain gold chip was then placed
into a flow cell of the Reichert's SPR platform. The SPR measurement was fine-
tuned by adjusting the time settings and flow rates of injection, dissociation,
waiting and regeneration. The final settings were: 40 min of injection, 40 min of
dissociation following another 40 min of injection of the regeneration solution,
40 min of dissociation and 40 min of equilibrating at a flow rate of 2 µL/min.
Different regeneration solutions were tested in order to obtain a better regeneration
efficiency: 10 mM glycine at pH 2, 10 mM glycine at pH 10 and 50 mM NaOH. The
same concentration of the analyte was injected six times and the relevant responses
were analysed. Circular dichroism spectra of 5 µM solutions of six aptamer can-
didates were measured with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. In the
conformational change study, the CD spectra were obtained between 220 and
320 nm. The data gathered were the average of four scans at a scanning rate of
100 nm/min. The scan of the buffer recorded at room temperature was subtracted
from the average scans for each DNA sequence. Data were processed in Excel and
Origin for plotting.
Wire LH aptamer sensor fabrication. To fabricate the sensor, 6 cm of gold, silver
and platinum wires in 1-mm diameter were first polished with P240 sandpaper
gently and cleaned with absolute ethanol and ddH2O. PVC insulation tape was
used to wrap the wire electrodes for insulation. Overall, 5 mm of the metal was left
exposed at both ends, and epoxy was used to seal the edges of the tape and the wire
to avoid water leakage. The top end was soldered to a connector cable for the
connection of the potentiostat. The silver wire was immersed in bleach overnight to
form a silver chloride film. No special treatment was applied for the platinum
electrode. The gold working wire electrode was further electrochemically cleaned
by applying repeat scanning CV from −0.3 to 1.5 V in 0.5 M sulphuric acid until
typical clean gold cyclic voltammograms were observed. Electrochemical rough-
ening was also performed to increase the electrochemical active surface area32: A
two-step chronoamperometry was applied to the cleaned gold wire electrode by
alternating the potential between 0 and 2 V, back and forth for around 10,000
pulses in 0.5 M sulphuric acid. The cleaned, roughened gold working wire electrode
was immersed into a reduced MB-modified B23 LH aptamer solution in PBS for
2 h under sealed, moist and room-temperature conditions. Subsequently, the sensor
was immersed overnight in 10 mM 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) in PBS to coat
the remaining gold surface. The modified gold working electrode was assembled
with the platinum counter electrode and silver/silver chloride reference electrode to
the 3D-printed electrode holder and stored in buffer condition before use.
Electrochemical measurement. All the electrochemical measurements were per-
formed using an Emstat blue potentiostat in an electrochemical cell customised for
96-well-plate sensing with the wire LH aptamer sensor. For the SWV measure-
ments, the sensors were interrogated from 0.0 to −0.5 V (Ag/AgCl reference
electrode) with 25-mV amplitude, 4-mV steps and suitable frequency setting
(ranging from 1 to 500 Hz). For the CV measurements, the sensors were inter-
rogated from 0.0 to −0.5 V (Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at 0.1 V/s. The CV scan
rate study was performed under a scanning potential ranging from −0.5 to 0 V.
Seven scan rates were used: 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.04 and 0.03 V/s. The LOD
was calculated from three times standard deviation of the blank sample (PBS or HA
serum without LH)/slope of the calibration line.
Automation. The Opentron robotic platform was calibrated before each usage. The
principle is to allow the robot to remember the preset position at each slot (such as
96-well plates, tip box, trash etc.) by moving the liquid-handling arm to the preset
position manually. The automated measurement cycle was programmed as the
following: (1) move the sample from sample well to the detection well , (2) wait for
the measurement , (3) remove the sample from the detection well , (4) move the
wash buffer from wash buffer well to the detection well , (5) pipette up and down to
wash the sensor (three times) and (6) move to the next sample. The SWV mea-
surement was initiated at the Emstat interface (PSTrace) with a set time delay to
synchronise with the robot. All the square-wave voltammograms obtained were
normalised in PSTrace using the moving average baseline function and the peak
value of each sample recorded. The peak values were processed and analysed via
Excel, Origin and MedCal.
Clinical samples. Samples for data shown in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and
5 were collected during 8-h research studies conducted in the clinical research
facility at Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust, UK in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice guidelines. Ethical approval was obtained prior, and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent before inclusion (Menopause study 15/LO/1481,
ethical approval granted by Research Ethics Committee: London-West London and
Gene Therapy Advisory Committee); healthy women with normal fertility 12/LO/
0507, ethical approval granted by Research Ethics Committee: West London and
women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea 13/LO/1807 and 12/LO/0507, ethical
approval granted by Research Ethics Committee: London-West London and Gene
Therapy Advisory Committee. Participants attended the clinical research facility
and a peripheral cannula was inserted into a vein in their arm, which could then be
used to repeatedly sample blood (every 10 min for 8 h = 49 samples/participant).
The samples included had been taken from either the vehicle or baseline visit. Each
blood sample (3 ml) taken for gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) and sex steroids
(oestradiol and progesterone) was left to clot for at least 30 min, and then spun at
503 rcf for 10 min. The serum supernatant was then removed and immediately
stored at −20 °C for subsequent analysis using a commercially available, automated
chemiluminescent immunoassay method (Architect LH 2P40; Abbott Diagnostics,
Maidenhead, UK). Laboratory analysis information was as follows: reference range:
LH 4–14 IU/L, FSH 1.5–8 IU/L; intra-assay coefficient of variation: LH 4.1%, FSH
4.1%; inter-assay coefficient of variation LH 2.7%, FSH 3.0%; analytical sensitivity:
LH 0.5 IU/L, FSH 0.05 IU/L. Architect LH Reagent Kit (2P40-25) Antibody details:

 dilution procedures: if required the automatic system performed a 1:4 dilution of
the sample. Samples for data shown in Fig. 4 were archival serum from women
undergoing fertility treatment (n = 1, six time points) and from women with
hypothalamic amenorrhoea (n = 3) from the Hormone Laboratory, University
Gynaecology Unit, Tsan Yuk Hospital, Hong Kong. Ethical approval for use and
collection of these samples was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (reference
UW 15-652). These samples had been stored at −20 °C. The initial LH immu-
noassay had been performed by Architect LH Reagent Kit (2P40-25) on the
automated chemiluminescent platform (Abbott Diagnostics, Illinois, USA).
BSA. A probability density distribution for inter-pulse intervals was obtained from
both clinical assay and RAPTER assay datasets using BSA. We assume that the data-
generating process d(t), can be written as the sum of an underlying oscillatory signal
with frequency ω, s(t,ω); a background drift function, g(t) and a noise term, e(t):
dðtÞ ¼ sðt; ωÞ þ gðtÞ þ eðtÞ:
BSA calculates the posterior probability density distribution of ω, for a given
model using Bayes’ rule:
PðωjD; MÞ ¼ PðlDjω; MÞPðωjMÞ
PðDjMÞ
;
where P(D|ω,M) is the probability of observing the data given model M, P(ω|M) is
the prior distribution over frequencies (assumed uniform) and P(D|M) is the
evidence for model M. Furthermore, Bayesian model selection can be employed to
choose the simplest, most constrained, model among models with different
background functions. Analysis was performed using the BaSAR package in R33,
with sines and cosines as model functions, Legendre polynomials as background
functions, and assuming time- independent Gaussian noise.
