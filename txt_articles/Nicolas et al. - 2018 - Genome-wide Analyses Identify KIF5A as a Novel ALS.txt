SUMMARY 
To identify novel genes associated with ALS, we undertook two lines of investigation. We carried out a 
genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we 
performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. 
Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated 
with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are 
causative for two neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-
Tooth Type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal 
cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss of function mutations displayed an extended 
survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum 
resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of 
ALS.

INTRODUCTION 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, OMIM #105400) is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically 
characterized by rapidly progressive muscle weakness and death due to respiratory failure, typically 
within two to four years of symptom onset (van Es et al., 2017). Although ALS is perceived as being 
rare, approximately 6,000 Americans die annually from the condition (Hirtz et al., 2007). Furthermore, 
the number of ALS cases across the globe will increase to nearly 400,000 in 2040, predominantly due to 
aging of the population (Arthur et al., 2016). This increase is anticipated to place an enormous 
socioeconomic burden on global healthcare systems, in particular because the annual healthcare cost per 
patient with ALS is among the highest for any neurological disease (Gladman and Zinman, 2015).  
 
Approximately 10% of ALS display a family history (FALS) whereas the remaining 90% of ALS cases 
are sporadic (SALS) in nature. Driven in large part by advances in genotyping and sequencing 
technology, the genetic etiology of two-thirds of familial cases and about 10% of sporadic ALS cases is 
now known (Chia et al., 2018; Renton et al., 2014). Mutations in SOD1 were the first identified cause of 
ALS (Rosen et al., 1993) contributing to ~20% of FALS and ~2% of SALS. More recently, pathogenic 
hexanucleotide repeat expansions located within the first intron of the C9orf72 gene on chromosome 
9p21 were identified as the most common cause of both FALS (~40%) and SALS (~7%) (DeJesus-
Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011). Interestingly, this repeat expansion contributes to ~10% of 
all FTD cases thus genetically explaining much of the overlap between these clinical syndromes 
(Majounie et al., 2012). As a result of these major discoveries, there are several ongoing efforts towards 
directed silencing of these mutant genes which could result in a therapeutic treatment for up to 10% of 
all ALS cases and for a similar portion of FTD cases.   
 
  
4 
In addition to the insights provided by each novel ALS gene, the collective knowledge gained from 
genetic factors provides a more comprehensive understanding of the interacting pathways underlying 
motor neuron degeneration. For example, the identification of ALS genes has revealed at least three 
pathways believed to contribute to the development of ALS: (1) RNA metabolism (based on the 
observation of mutations in C9orf72, TDP-43, FUS, HNRNPA1, and MATR3); (2) protein homeostasis 
(UBQLN2, VCP, OPTN, VAPB); (3) cytoskeletal dynamics (PFN1, TUBA4A, DCTN1) (Chia et al., 
2018; Robberecht and Eykens, 2015; Taylor et al., 2016). Understanding the mechanisms leading to 
disease pathogenesis again provides targets for therapeutic intervention that may be applicable to all 
forms of ALS.  
 
Due to the decreased accessibility of multiple affected family members with unknown genetic etiology, 
there has been an increased focus on the identification of ALS associated genes with moderate to low 
impact. Despite their lower effect, such genes continue to provide valuable insight into ALS 
pathogenesis. For example, the product of the risk factor TBK1 is known to interact with the product of 
ALS associated gene OPTN, further solidifying the role of autophagy and protein homeostasis in disease 
development (Cirulli et al., 2015; Freischmidt et al., 2015; Maruyama et al., 2010; Morton et al., 2008). 
Similarly, the risk factor NEK1, identified through a rare variant burden analysis of index FALS (i.e., 
one affected sample per family), is a known binding partner of C21orf2, an ALS risk factor found 
through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Cirulli et al., 2015; Kenna et al., 2016; 
Malovannaya et al., 2011; van Rheenen et al., 2016). The interaction of these two proteins is required for 
efficient DNA damage repair (Fang et al., 2015), a pathway which is becoming increasingly implicated 
as a contributing factor in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases (Coppedè and Migliore, 2015; 
Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2016; Madabhushi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013).

RESULTS 
Genome-wide Association Studies Identify KIF5A as a Novel ALS Associated Gene 
 
To identify new susceptibility loci operating in ALS, we undertook a large-scale GWAS involving 
12,663 patients diagnosed with ALS and 53,439 control subjects (Table S1, S2). Our data were then 
incorporated into a meta-analysis with a recently published GWAS involving 12,577 ALS cases and 
23,475 control subjects (van Rheenen et al., 2016). After imputation and quality-control measures (see 
Methods, Figure S1 for the workflow and Figure S2 for the multidimensional scaling plot), 10,031,630 
genotyped and imputed variants from 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 control samples were available for 
association analysis (Figure 1A). Quantile-quantile plots did not show evidence of significant 
population stratification (�1000 = 1.001, Figure S3). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) achieving 
genome-wide significance (P < 5.0x10-8) are listed in Table 1, Table S3 and suggestive loci with SNPs 
associated at P < 5.0×10−7 are listed in Table S4.  
 
Our analysis revealed five previously identified loci that achieved genome-wide significance (loci 
including TNIP1, C9orf72, TBK1, UNC13A, C21orf2) (Benyamin et al., 2017; Laaksovirta et al., 2010; 
Shatunov et al., 2010; van Es et al., 2009; van Rheenen et al., 2016). In addition, we observed a strong 
association signal for five SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 12q14.1 that reached 
genome-wide statistical significance (Table 1, Figure 1B) spanning a region of several hundred 
kilobases. Of the five SNPs, two of them resided in close proximity to each other within a large 
intergenic region and two in proximity to short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 
(SDR9C7), a gene expressed primarily in skin. However, one SNP (rs113247976) results in a 
p.Pro986Leu coding change within the kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene (P = 6.4x10-10 , OR = 
1.38, 95% CI = 1.24-1.53). The case:control allele frequencies for the combined discovery cohort were 
  
6 
2.07%:1.55% and genotype counts were 5 : 529 : 12,043 to 7 : 786 : 22,682 (homozygotes alternative 
allele : heterozygotes : homozygous reference allele, Figure 2). Calculations based on our cohort size as 
well as the OR and allele frequency of rs113247976 result in a ~99.5% power to detect this as an ALS 
associated SNP. 
 
Rare Variant Burden Analysis Identifies KIF5A as an ALS gene  
In an independent line of investigation, we attempted to identify novel ALS genes through exome-wide 
rare variant burden analysis (RVB). In brief, RVB compares the frequency of variants within each gene 
below a user defined frequency threshold in a case-control cohort. As the last two ALS associated genes 
identified by this methodology (TBK1, NEK1) displayed an increased frequency of loss of function 
(LOF) variants, we focused our initial analysis on such variants (consisting of nonsense and predicted 
splice-altering) (Cirulli et al., 2015; Freischmidt et al., 2015; Kenna et al., 2016).  
 
Towards this end, we performed RVB testing for association of LOF variants in a cohort of 1,138 index 
FALS cases and 19,494 controls, after applying quality control filters (Experimental Methods, Figure 
S4, Table S5, S6). Genes displaying P < 5.0x10-4 are shown in Table 2. The previously identified ALS 
genes, TBK1 (P = 5.58x10-7, OR = 15.11, 95% CI = 5.81-38.69) and NEK1 (P = 1.68x10-6, OR = 6.64, 
95% CI = 3.32-12.51), yielded strong associations with ALS reaching exome-wide significance (Figure 
3). In addition, we observed a single novel gene reaching exome-wide significance, KIF5A (P = 
5.55x10-7; OR = 32.07, 95% CI = 9.05-135.27). Within this gene, we observed 6 LOF variants in our 
1,138 cases (0.53%) compared to 3 such variants in our comparison cohort of 19,494 controls (0.015%, 
Table 2). There was no evidence of genomic inflation (�=0.93, Figure S5), sequencing center or other 
sub-cohort bias (Figure S6), or call rate bias (Figure S7) in our analysis. Of the index FALS cases 
  
7 
carrying KIF5A LOF mutations, we obtained DNA from two siblings of the proband carrying a c.2993-
3C>T, exon 27 - 5' splice junction variant, and from a sibling of a different proband carrying a 
c.3020+2T>A, exon 27 - 3' splice junction variant. These variants segregated with disease within each of 
these families. Sanger sequencing was performed for 8 of the 9 LOF containing samples and was 
validated in every case.  
 
Interestingly, when we investigated the location of the six ALS associated variants present in KIF5A, all 
occurred within a 34 bp stretch of DNA and were predicted to effect splicing of exon 27 that encodes 
amino acids 998-1007 (Table 3, Figure 4A). Five of the six variants were located on sequential base 
pairs on the 3’ end of the exon, whereas one was located 5’ end of the exon. We used the application 
ASSEDA (Automated Splice Site and Exon Definition Analyses) to predict any mutant mRNA splice 
isoforms resulting from these variants (Tompson et al., 2007). This algorithm was chosen as it is known 
to have high performance in splice prediction (Caminsky et al., 2014). ASSEDA predicted a complete 
skipping of exon 27 for all variants, yielding a transcript with a frameshift at coding amino acid 998, the 
deletion of the normal C-terminal 34 amino acids of the cargo-binding domain, and the extension of an 
aberrant 39 amino acids to the C-terminus (Table 3, Figure 4B, 4C). The presence of transcripts with 
skipped exon 27 was demonstrated by performing RT-PCR in two patients carrying exon 27 - 3' splice 
junction variants (c.3020+2T>A and c.3020+1G>A) using RNA from lymphoblasts and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells, respectively. This splice form was not detected in four control lines (Figure 
4D). Material for RT-PCR was not available for any other patient carrying a KIF5A LOF variant. 
 
Our initial RVB was restricted to single nucleotide variants due to the limited sensitivity and 
comparatively high false positive rates associated with identifying small insertions and deletions (indels) 
  
8 
within exome sequencing data (Fang et al., 2014). Based on our discovery of increased LOF variants 
within KIF5A, we re-evaluated this region for the presence of indels. Our analysis revealed two 
(0.026%) indels within our cohort of 1,138 FALS cases, compared to zero (0%) indels among 19,494 
control samples. Both of these indels (p.Asp996fs, p.Asn999fs) resulted in a frameshift of the KIF5A 
protein coding sequence, and were located close to the splice junction variants that we previously 
observed to cause skipping of exon 27 resulting in a frameshift at amino acid 998 (Table 3). Sanger 
sequencing confirmed the presence of both indels. Combining the results of the single nucleotide and 
indel variant analysis yielded a highly significant P of 3.8x10-9 (OR = 41.16, 95% CI = 12.61-167.57). 
We failed to detect any signals of RVB association for rare missense variants across KIF5A or within 
any sub-domain of the gene (Table S8). 
 
Replication Analysis of rs113247976 and LOF Variants in KIF5A 
Given the strong signal of the missense variant identified by our GWAS (p.Pro986Leu, rs113247976) 
and its close proximity to the LOF variants identified by our RVB analysis (amino acids 996-999), we 
attempted to replicate its association with ALS by analyzing additional cohorts. To accomplish this, we 
evaluated this variant in a cohort of 4,159 ALS cases and 18,650 controls that were non-overlapping 
with our GWAS discovery analysis (Methods, Figure S8). This included non-overlapping samples from 
our RVB analysis (673 FALS, 17,696 controls). Analysis of the cohort revealed an allele frequency of 
1.78% in cases and 1.32% in controls (rs113247976, P = 3.82x10-4, OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.17-1.70), 
thereby replicating the association of the original GWAS. A meta-analysis of the GWAS and replication 
cohort (n = 24,965 cases, 78,454 controls) yielded a highly significant P of 7.09x10-13 (OR = 1.39, 95% 
CI = 1.33-1.45, Figure 2). These results support the association of KIF5A p.Pro986Leu with ALS. 
However, at this point we cannot definitely state that the missense variant is the primary risk factor, as 
  
9 
we cannot rule out other variants in linkage disequilibrium.  
 
We next performed mutational screening of KIF5A in an additional cohort of 9,046 ALS cases that had 
not been included in our original RVB analysis. This revealed three additional carriers of C-terminal 
variants. One sporadic patient harbored an exon 26 frameshift mutation (p.Asn997fs) and a second 
sporadic patient harbored an exon 27 splice altering mutation (c.2993-1G>A, Table 3). The third patient 
carried a p.Arg1007Lys (c.3020G>A) mutation and had a familial history of ALS. This mutation was 
also observed in a FALS patients from our RVB analysis, however, a comparison of 240,715 common 
variant sites between the two patients failed to reveal a familial relationship (Experimental Methods). 
Additionally, one patient was observed to carry a predicted splice altering variant proximal to exon 3 
(c.291+5G>A). However, this variant was not supported as creating an aberrant transcript by ASSEDA. 
The cohort used for this analysis was comprised mainly frequency of sporadic ALS cases. LOF variants 
were not observed in a follow up panel of 1,955 controls. Comparison of the LOF variants in sporadic 
patients (2/9,046 cases, 0.022%) with either the 1,955 replication controls or all controls analyzed in this 
study (21,449 controls) both yielded insignificant P values (0.868 and 0.423, respectively). Interestingly, 
the frequency of LOF variants in sporadic cases is lower than that observed in our original FALS cohort 
(0.703%), suggesting that KIF5A LOF variants display a high penetrance. Furthermore, the rate of LOF 
variants reported in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database is lower than we observed in 
the control samples used in our discovery cohort (0.007% versus 0.015%). 
 
ALS-Associated Mutations in KIF5A are Distinct from SPG10/CMT2 Mutations 
Missense mutations within KIF5A are a known cause of hereditary spastic paraparesis (spastic 
paraplegia type 10, autosomal dominant; OMIM #604187) and of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 2 
  
10 
(CMT2) (Crimella et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2002). Although 
SPG10 and CMT2 share clinical features with ALS, a careful examination of the clinical records of the 
ALS cases with LOF mutations in KIF5A ruled out misdiagnosis. Furthermore, we detected no variants 
previously associated with SPG10 or CMT2 in our FALS cohort (Liu et al., 2014).  
 
To further elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships, we evaluated the location of mutations within 
KIF5A. Interestingly, mutations contributing to SPG10 and to CMT2 are almost exclusively to be 
missense changes and are located in the N-terminal motor domain (amino acids 9-327) of KIF5A 
(Figure 5). In contrast, the mutations identified as contributing to ALS are found predominantly in the 
C-terminal cargo binding region of KIF5A (amino acids 907-1032) with the highly penetrant FALS 
mutations showing LOF. These results indicate that the functional domain mutated in KIF5A dictates 
the clinical phenotype, resulting in distinct yet overlapping neurodegenerative diseases.  
 
Patients with KIF5A LOF Mutations Display Younger Age at Onset and Longer Survival 
To establish the existence of any commonalities between patients with LOF mutations in the C-terminal 
region of KIF5A, we evaluated their clinical phenotype. Cases with LOF mutations exhibited a median 
age of onset at 46.5 years (n = 19, Table S7). This is lower than the age of onset reported for ALS in 
epidemiological studies (65.2 years, interquartile range 56.0 – 72.2) (ALSGEN Consortium et al., 2013). 
Interestingly, we also observed an increased disease duration (survival) in patients harboring these LOF 
mutations. The median survival time of ALS patients is 20 – 36 months (ALSGEN Consortium et al., 
2013). In contrast, cases with LOF mutations exhibited a median survival of nearly 10 years (117 
months, n = 17, Table S7). ALS patients with symptom onset before 40 years of age have been shown 
to have longer survival, often exceeding 10 years (Chio et al., 2009). In contrast, patients with 
  
11 
uncomplicated types of hereditary spastic paraparesis and CMT2 display a normal life expectancy 
(Patzkó and Shy, 2011).  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
We previously identified KIF5A as a candidate gene for ALS in our prior study that lacked the power to 
draw a definitive conclusion (Kenna et al., 2016). KIF5A was also a candidate ALS gene in a previous 
GWAS, though it similarly failed to reach genome-wide significance (McLaughlin et al., 2017; van 
Rheenen et al., 2016) as well as a single gene study selected based on the a priori knowledge of its role 
in HSP/CMT2 and cytoskeletal function (Brenner et al., 2018). Here, we have confirmed KIF5A as an 
ALS-associated gene with genome-wide significance through two independent approaches. By 
performing a GWAS involving ~80,000 samples, in addition to replicating five previously published 
loci, as well as the previously reported locus SCFD1 using a linear mixed model analysis (data not 
shown), we identified a missense variant within the KIF5A gene that reached genome-wide significance 
for association with ALS risk. It should be stated though that, as with all GWAS, we cannot rule out that 
other variants in linkage disequilibrium represent the primary risk factor. In an independent line of 
investigation, we applied RVB analysis to exome sequencing of ~21,000 samples and identified an 
exome-wide significant association between FALS risk and rare KIF5A LOF variants. Analyses of 
KIF5A in independent replication cohorts confirmed our initial finding for both the p.Pro986Leu variant 
and revealed three additional carriers of LOF variants in 9,046 ALS cases. Taken together our results 
indicate that the p.Pro986Leu KIF5A variant may represent a relatively common, but low penetrance 
risk allele for ALS, while LOF variants constitute rare, but high penetrance risk factors.

Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in intracellular transport of organelles within 
eukaryotic cells. In mammals, there are three heavy chain isoforms of KIF5: KIF5A, KIF5B and KIF5C 
(Miki et al., 2001). The three proteins homo- and heterodimerize through their coiled-coiled stalk 
domain, and create a complex with two kinesin light chains via binding to the tail domain (Hirokawa et 
al., 1989). All three KIF5 genes are expressed in neurons (Kanai et al., 2000) and function to transport 
many cargos by binding to distinct adaptor proteins.  
 
The central role of kinesins in axonal transport leads us to speculate that mutations in KIF5A cause 
disease by disrupting axonal transport. Indeed, defects in axonal transport are a common observation in 
ALS patients and are already known to directly contribute to motor neuron degeneration pathogenesis 
(Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006; Hirokawa et al., 2010; Millecamps and Julien, 2013). KIF5 
mediates the transport of granules containing both RNA and RNA binding proteins within neuronal 
dendrites and axons (Kanai et al., 2004). Among these cargos are the ALS-associated proteins FUS and 
hnRNPA1  
(Guo et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2009; Vance et al., 2009). Similarly, KIF5 
mediates the transport of VAPB through the adaptor protein protrudin (Matsuzaki et al., 2011), and 
mutations in the VAPB gene have been identified in ALS and late-onset spinal muscular atrophy 
(Nishimura et al., 2005; 2004). KIF5 is responsible for the axonal transport of neurofilaments (Wang 
and Brown, 2010) and KIF5A knockout mice display abnormal transport of neurofilaments (Xia et al., 
2003). Abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments are a pathological hallmark of ALS and rare mutations 
in neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) are associated with ALS (Al-Chalabi et al., 1999). 
 
KIF5 also contributes to the transport of mitochondria (Kanai et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 1998) and 
  
13 
motor neurons derived from KIF5A-/- mice display transport deficits and reduced survival (Karle et al., 
2012). Impaired transport and dysfunction of mitochondria represent another common hallmark 
observed in ALS patients (Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006; Guo et al., 2017; Palomo and 
Manfredi, 2015; Smith et al., 2017). KIF5 also contributes to the transport of AMPA-type (Heisler et al., 
2014; Setou et al., 2002) and GABAA receptors (Nakajima et al., 2012). In keeping with reported ALS 
genes such as NEK1 (Thiel et al., 2011) and PFN1 (Wu et al., 2012), modulation of KIF5A expression 
has been shown to influence the formation of neurite like membrane protrusions (Matsuzaki et al., 
2011). Given its critical interactions with the cytoskeleton, the identification of KIF5A mutations further 
extends the list of cytoskeletal related proteins implicated in ALS pathogenesis, such as PFN1, 
TUBA4A, NEFH and peripherin (Al-Chalabi et al., 1999; Gros-Louis, 2004; Smith et al., 2014; Wu et 
al., 2012). 
 
An important question raised by the current study is why variation within the C-terminal cargo binding 
domain is associated with ALS, while missense variations of the N-terminal motor domain are 
associated with hereditary spastic paraparesis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth, type 2. Missense mutations 
within this latter domain have been shown to affect microtubule binding and/or ATP hydrolysis, 
resulting in a defective KIF5A-mediated anterograde transport of cargo along dendrites and axons. This, 
in turn, leads to the axonal retrograde degeneration observed both in hereditary spastic paraparesis and 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth, type 2, two length-dependent axonopathies (Ebbing et al., 2008). In contrast, the 
primary cellular lesion in ALS is believed to occur within motor neuron cell bodies, where cytoplasmic 
protein aggregates are consistently observed, and to propagate anterograde along neurites. We anticipate 
that LOF variants within the C-terminal domain of KIF5A will disrupt binding with specific cargo 
proteins. This is supported by a study in zebrafish in which truncation of the C-terminal resulted in a 
  
14 
dramatic disruption of axonal localization of mitochondria (Campbell et al., 2014).  One possible 
mechanism is that disruption of binding to cargo may possibly lead to their accumulation and seed 
aggregation within the cell body resulting in a deficiency at neurite terminals. Deficiency in KIF5A 
expression and cargo binding has been associated with accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilaments 
and amyloid precursor protein within neuronal cell bodies, and subsequent neurodegeneration, in 
patients with multiple sclerosis (Hares et al., 2016). While differences in KIF5A kinetics and KIF5A 
interactions constitute one possibility to explain the phenotypic heterogeneity, it is also possible C-
terminal and N-terminal variants act through a common mechanism, but that a difference in the relative 
extent of loss or gain of function toxicities leads to milder (i.e. hereditary spastic paraplegia, Charcot-
Marie-Tooth, type 2) or more severe (i.e. ALS) phenotypes.

MAIN FIGURE TITLES AND LEGENDS 
 
Figure 1. Identification of association between KIF5A locus and ALS risk through GWAS. (A) 
Manhattan plot showing P values from the discovery set GWAS. Analysis of a combined set of 20,806 
cases and 59,804 controls is shown. The dashed red line denotes the threshold for genome-wide 
significance after multiple test correction (P < 5.0x10-8). Five previously reported ALS associated loci 
are labeled in grey and one novel loci, containing the KIF5A gene, is labeled in black. (B) Regional 
association plot of the KIF5A locus. Recombination rates are from HapMap phase 2 European ancestry 
samples. The R2 pattern is based on the rs113247976 SNP using 85 European ancestry samples (CEU) 
from the November 2010 release of the 1000 Genomes Project dataset. R2 of the p.Pro986Leu 
(rs113247976) with additional SNPs achieving genome-wide significance was 0.544 (rs117027576), 
0.544 (rs118082508), 0.741 (rs116900480), and 0.347 (rs142321490). 
 
Figure 2. Discovery and replication for the association of the KIF5A p.Pro986Leu (rs113247976) 
variant with ALS. Analysis of the p.Pro986Leu (rs113247976) variant within each of the described 
cohorts is shown. Allelic association for all subcohorts were analyzed by logistic regression followed by 
a fixed-effects meta-analysis. The Forest plot (right) displays the distribution of OR estimates across 
study cohorts with the vertical dotted line denoting the OR estimated under the meta-analysis. 
 
Figure 3. Identification of association between KIF5A and ALS risk through rare variant burden 
analysis of exome sequencing. Manhattan plot showing gene-level P values from an exome-wide rare 
variant burden analysis. Analyses of 1,138 index FALS cases versus 19,494 controls were restricted to 
rare LOF variants (splice altering/nonsense, MAF < 0.001). A minimum of 3 LOF gene variants were 
  
29 
required for analysis. The dashed red line denotes the threshold for exome-wide significance after 
correction for 11,472 genes (4.36x10-6). Previously reported (grey) and novel (black) genes exhibiting a 
significant excess of rare LOF variants in patients are shown. 
 
Figure 4. ALS associated loss of function variants of KIF5A disrupt C-terminal sequence by 
inducing skipping of exon 27. (A) Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within KIF5A identified in ALS 
patients are clustered at the 5’ and 3’ splice junctions of exon 27. The consensus splice sequence is 
shown. (B) ALS associated SNVs are predicted to induce skipping of exon 27 and result in an aberrant 
mRNA transcript. (C) The skipping of exon 27 of KIF5A yields an out-of-frame and extended disrupted 
C-terminal peptide sequence. The amino acids in red signify the divergence from the normal protein. (D) 
RT-PCR was performed using RNA derived from ALS patients with the indicated LOF variant or 
without (controls) using primers to either amplify both wild-type (155 bp) and mutant (127 bp) splice 
forms or specifically the mutant splice form (80 bp, right panel). The arrow represents the position of the 
mutant specific product. The tick marks represent 200 bp (upper) and 100 bp (lower) markers. 
 
Figure 5. KIF5A ALS mutations show distinct localization from missense mutations previously 
associated with SPG10 and CMT2. Causative mutations for SPG10 and CMT2 described within the 
literature (Crimella et al., 2011; Jennings et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2002) and ALS 
associated mutations identified within this study are shown. As illustrated, mutations causative for 
SPG10/CMT2 are predominantly missense changes located in the N-terminal motor domain. In contrast, 
ALS mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal motor domain and are LOF.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 
Study cohorts 
GWAS cohort I. We undertook a GWAS of patients diagnosed with ALS (case cohort) and 
neurologically normal control individuals (control cohort). DNA was extracted from either whole blood 
or frozen brain tissue samples using standard procedures. All 12,663  patients included in the case cohort 
had been diagnosed with ALS according to the El Escorial criteria (Brooks, 1994) by a neurologist 
specializing in ALS, had onset of symptoms after age 18 years, and were of non-Hispanic white 
race/ethnicity. Both patients with familial ALS and patients with sporadic ALS were included in the 
analysis.  
 
For the control cohort, we used genotype data obtained from (a) the database of Genotypes and 
Phenotypes (dbGaP) web repository (n = 44,017 US samples); (b) the HYPERGENES Project (n = 887 
Italian samples) (Salvi et al., 2012); and (c) the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (n = 5,663 
British samples). An additional 2,112 US and Italian control samples were genotyped in the Laboratory 
of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging. The control cohort was matched to the case cohort for 
race and ethnicity, but not for age or sex. A detailed description of the cohorts is available in Table S1, 
S2.  
 
  
 
34 
Written consent was obtained from all individuals enrolled in this study, and the study was approved by 
the institutional review board approval of the National Institute on Aging (protocol number 03-AG-
N329).  
 
GWAS cohort II. Summary statistics from a recently published GWAS based on logistic regression 
analysis involving 12,577 cases and 23,475 controls were downloaded from the Project MinE Variant 
Browser. Additional details of the cohorts used in this study are available in van Rheenen et al (van 
Rheenen et al., 2016). 
 
FALS discovery cohort. A total of 1,463 FALS patients were included in the initial cohort (pre-QC). 
Patients were recruited at specialist clinics in Australia (n = 92), Belgium (n = 13), Canada (n = 34), 
Germany (n = 228), Ireland (n = 18), Israel (n = 26), Italy (n = 230), Netherlands (n = 50), Spain (n = 
60), Turkey (n = 72), UK (n = 223), and USA (n = 417). All samples were exome sequenced except 
those from the Netherlands which were whole genome sequenced. Familial history was considered 
positive for ALS if the proband had at least one affected relative within three degrees of relatedness.  
 
Control discovery cohort. Read level sequencing data were obtained from dbGAP and the European 
Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) and are listed in Table S5. 
 
ALS WXS/WGS replication cohort. Replication analyses included sequencing data for a further 9,046 
ALS cases and 1,955 non-ALS controls that were not also represented in the FALS discovery set. These 
samples included 2,742 cases subjected to WXS by the ALS Sequencing Consortium, as described 
previously (Cirulli et al., 2015); 719 cases subjected to WXS by the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, 
  
 
35 
National Institute on Aging; 307 cases and 296 controls subjected to WGS by the Laboratory of 
Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging; 155 cases subjected to WGS by the CReATe Consortium; 
1,017 cases subjected to WGS by the NYGC ALS Consortium, Genomic Translation for ALS Care 
(GTAC) Consortium and Answer ALS Foundation; and 4,100 cases and 1,659 controls subjected to 
WGS by the Project MinE Sequencing Consortium.  
 
All samples included in the case cohort had been diagnosed with ALS according to the El Escorial 
criteria (Brooks, 1994) by a neurologist specializing in ALS.  We received approval for this study from 
the institutional review boards of the participating centers, and written informed consent was obtained 
from all patients (consent for research). 
 
METHOD DETAILS 
Data generation and pre-processing 
Generation of SNP array callset. The case cohort (n = 12,663 samples) and part of the control cohort (n 
= 2,112) were genotyped in the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, using 
HumanOmniExpress BeadChips (version 1.0, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the 
manufacturer's protocol. These SNP genotyping arrays assay 716,503 SNPs across the genome. 
Individual-level genotypes for these samples are available on the dbGaP web portal (accession number 
phs000101.v4.p1). The remainder of the control cohort had been previously genotyped on HumanOmni 
BeadChips (Illumina) as part of other GWAS efforts (see Table S2). Analyses were confined to the 
595,692 autosomal SNPs that were common across the SNP genotyping arrays. 
 
  
 
36 
Generation of FALS case-control callset for exome-wide RVB discovery analysis. Exome sequencing of 
cases was performed as previously described (Kenna et al., 2016). Control exome sequences were 
generated as described under the relevant dbGAP and EGA project accessions. Sequence reads were 
aligned to human reference GRCh37 using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) and processed according 
to recommended Genome Analysis Toolkit’s (GATK) best practices 
(https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/). Joint variant detection and genotyping of all 
samples were performed using the GATK HaplotypeCaller. Variant quality control was performed using 
the GATK variant quality score recalibration method with default filters. A minimum variant quality by 
depth (QD) score of 2 was also imposed and all genotypes associated with genotype quality (GQ)< 20 
were reset to missing. Variants were also excluded in the event of case or control call rates <70% (post 
genotype QC). Identified variants can be viewed through our web based ALS Variant Server (see link 
below). 
 
Generation of ALS case-control callset for KIF5A replication analysis. Data for the KIF5A locus was 
extracted from all independently generated sequencing datasets and remapped to GRCh37. Variant 
calling was performed using the GATK haplotype caller as described above. In addition to the KIF5A 
locus, data was also extracted for a panel of 240,715 common variant sites and used to perform a single 
unified sample QC as described below.  
 
Functional annotation of variants identified by WXS/WGS  
Variant calls were assigned predicted functional consequences using snpEFF (Single Nucleotide 
Polymorphism Effect)(Cingolani et al., 2012), dbNSFP (A Database of Human Non-synonymous SNVs 
and Their Functional Predictions and Annotations)(Liu et al., 2013) and dbscSNV (database of splice 
  
 
37 
site consequences of Single Nucleotide Variants)(Jian et al., 2014), which is incorporated into dbNSFP. 
Variants were classified as "loss of function" (LOF) where the sequence change was predicted to encode 
a premature stop codon, a frameshift causing insertion-deletion or a splice site disrupting SNV. Variants 
were classified as potentially splice altering if assigned an "ada" or "rf" score >0.7 by dbscSNV. Splice 
variants of potential interest were further assessed for putative effects on exon skipping using a 
secondary algorithm - automated splice site and exon definition server (ASSEDA)(Tompson et al., 
2007). 
 
RT-PCR Analysis  
Total RNA was prepared from lymphoblast lines using Trizol reagent. Reverse transcription using 
Applied Biosystems RNA to cDNA kit (# 4368814) was performed with 0.5 ug with RNAse inhibitor in 
a 20 ul reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was carried out using New England 
Biolabs One Taq Hot Start DNA Polymerase (# M0481S), 2 ul RT reaction (representing 50 ng input 
RNA) and forward and reverse primer (0.15 uM each) in a 20 ul reaction volume. Amplification 
conditions were as follows: 94°C for 30 seconds, {94°C for 20 seconds, 58°C for 20 seconds, 68°C for 1 
minute} x 35 cycles, followed by an extension stage of 68°C for 5 minutes and a 4°C hold. 
Amplification of both normal and mutant splice forms used primers F1 
(CAGTGGAGCCACATCTTCTG) and R1 (TCTCTTGGTGGAGAGGGAAA). Primers used for the 
specific amplification of the mutant splice form were F2 (CCAACATGGACAATGGAGTGA), which 
spans exons 26 and 28, and R1.  
 
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Statistical analyses  
  
 
38 
Analysis of SNP array genotypes. Standard quality-control procedures were applied to our genotype data 
using PLINK software package (version 1.9)(Chang et al., 2015), and a summary of the workflow is 
shown in Figure S1. We excluded samples that demonstrated: call rates of less than 97.5%; non-
European ancestry; abnormal F inbreeding coefficient; mismatch between phenotypic and genotypic 
gender; or, cryptic relatedness defined as identity-by-descent proportion of inheritance (pi_hat from 
PLINK) greater than 0.125. Samples in common between our study and van Rheenen's study were 
identified using the checksum program id_geno_checksum and were removed from our analyses. We 
excluded palindromic SNPs, as well as SNPs with: call rates less than 95% in the US and Italian cohorts 
or less than 99% in the UK, French and Belgium cohorts; minor allele frequency less than 0.05 in the 
control cohorts; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P less than 10-7 in the US and Italian control cohorts and 
less than 10-5 in the UK, French and Belgium cohorts; missingness by case-control status P less than 10-
5; or SNPs associated between the UK and French control cohorts with P less than 5.0x10-8. After 
quality control, 8,229 case and 36,329 control samples were included in the analysis, and 436,746 SNPs 
were available for imputation in the USA and Italy cohorts, and 420,131 SNPs were available in the UK, 
French and Belgium cohorts.  
 
Estimation of the haplotypes was performed with SHAPEIT (version 2.r790)(Delaneau et al., 2013). 
Imputation was performed for individual batches based on ethnicity using the 1000 Genomes Project 
dataset (phase 3, version 5a, release 2013-05-02, 1000genomes.org) as reference and using Minimac3 
software (version 1.0.11)(Das et al., 2016) with default settings. After imputation, principal components 
were calculated using PLINK software after removing known hypervariable regions and the 1 MB 
surrounding the C9orf72 region. After analysis of the Scree plots, 2 to 4 principal components were 
  
 
39 
retained per cohort as covariates in the association analyses to compensate for any residual population 
stratification.  
 
Logistic regression was performed per batch using mach2dat software (version 1.0.24)(Marchini and 
Howie, 2010) incorporating 2 to 4 principal components, age and gender as covariates, with dosage of 
imputed SNPs selected based on a Minimac3 R2 value of imputation accuracy greater than 0.3. SNPs 
with an absolute beta coefficient value above 5 or with a minor allele frequency less than 0.01 were 
excluded from meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was then performed combining the association results of the 
13 batches of our individual-level studies with van Rheenen's study summary statistics using METAL 
software (version 2011-03-25)(Willer et al., 2010) under an inverse-weighted, fixed effect model. A 
threshold P of 5.0×10-8 was set for genome-wide significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple 
testing in the GWAS (Pe'er et al., 2008). 
 
The programming code used to analyze these data is freely available on GitHub (see link below), and 
GWAS summary statistics results for all tested SNPs are available from (link to be supplied at 
publication). 
 
Analysis of WXS/WGS genotypes. For both the discovery and replication phases, samples were excluded 
from the study in the event of failing to meet standard genotype call rate, heterozygosity, duplication, 
relatedness or population stratification filters as summarized in Table S6. Each of these filters was 
performed using a set of autosomal markers meeting all of the following criteria: call rate > 0.95, minor 
allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01, P > 0.001 for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage 
disequilibrium pruning (R2 < 0.5, window size = 50, step = 5). Filtering of autosomal markers, sample 
  
 
40 
call rate assessments and sample heterozygosity assessments were performed using PLINK software. 
Study duplicates and sample relatedness within the WXS/WGS cohorts was identified using KING 
software (Manichaikul et al., 2010). Study duplicates between WXS/WGS cohorts and GWAS datasets 
were identified using the checksum program id_geno_checksum. LASER was used to generate PCA 
coordinates for samples from the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP). Samples from the FALS 
discovery cohort were then mapped to this reference co-ordinate space. The discovery cohort was 
restricted to cases and controls occurring within 3 standard deviations of the mean for European HGDP 
samples along principal components 1-4. 
 
RVB analyses were performed by penalized logistic regression of case-control status with respect to 
number of minor alleles observed per sample per gene with and MAF <0.001. Analyses were only 
performed where the dataset contained more than 3 variant allele occurrences. Replication analyses of 
rs113247976 were performed using the same logistic regression protocol as used for RVB analyses. All 
analyses were conditioned on the first 4 eigenvectors generated by principal components analysis of 
common variant profiles. Genomic inflation factors were calculated using genome-wide association 
analysis for quantitative, binary and time-till-event traits using GenABEL software. Candidate 
associations were tested for signs of call-rate or subcohort biases as outlined in Figures S6, S7. Meta-
analysis of rs113247976 association results between sequencing and GWAS was performed using 
METAL. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.2.0). 
 
Control-control analyses. To identify genes potentially subject to confounding biases in FALS RVB 
analyses and to assess the potential impact of batch effects with non-ALS-related data, population or 
phenotypic stratifiers, the control sample cohort was divided into 28 pseudo case-control groups based 
  
 
41 
on the sequencing center or associated dbGaP / EGA project (Table S5). Genes shown in gray achieve 
for possible confounder association. Loci achieving a minimu P < 1 × 10–3 were deemed as displaying 
possible association with non-ALS related batch effects.
