Abstract
Self-rated health (SRH) accounts comprehensively for many health domains. The aim of
this paper was to investigate time trends and associations between age-comparative self-
rated health and some known determinants in a general population aged 24–34 years. Pop-
ulation-based cross-sectional surveys were performed in 1990, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and
2014 in Northern Sweden. Out of 3500 invited persons, 1811 responded. Comparative SRH
was measured on a three-grade ordinal scale by the question: “How would you assess your
general health condition compared to persons of your own age?” with the alternatives “bet-
ter/worse/similar”. Over the period 1990 to 2014, the percentage of women rating compara-
tive SRH as “worse” increased steadily, from 8.5% in 1990 reaching 20% in 2014 (p for
trend 0.007). Among men, this pattern was almost the opposite, with increasing proportions
rating “better” (p for trend <0.000). Time trends for physical activity in leisure time; length of
education; Body Mass Index; anxiety; depressive emotions and satisfaction with economy
showed a similar pattern for men and women. Factors that might contribute to the develop-
ment of time trends for comparative SRH are discussed.
Introduction
Self-rated health (SRH) is a widespread method of assessing health in populations and is an
independent predictor of future morbidity, such as myocardial infarction, risk of diabetes,
depression, rheumatic disease and sick leave; medical care utilisation; and mortality [1 2 3].
Two principal variants of SRH questions are often used: the general “How would you rate your
health at present time?” and the comparative “How would you rate your health in comparison
to others of the same age?” [4]. These are answered on a five- or three-level categorical scale.
General and comparative SRH have similar associations with outcomes in cohort studies
and with determinants in cross-sectional studies, but reflect different aspects of health and are
not equivalent [4 5]. The comparative question contains in itself a reference for evaluations
(compared to others) and steers the comparison to real persons and might thus be considered
semantically clearer [6].

 Gender issues are important in public health research. Gender is defined by the World
Health Organization: “Sex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define
men and women. Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and
attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women” [7]. Sweden is
regarded as a country with a high level of gender equality in international comparison, and
gender equality is an undisputable societal norm [8]. Still gender continues to play a consider-
able part in how work, wealth, power, and time use are distributed in the Swedish society [9].
Women in Sweden are gainfully employed to the same degree as men [9]. The Swedish labour
market is however, gender-segregated; a large number of women work in the public sector, in
caring and service professions, while men dominate in the private sector and work in areas
such as construction and transportation [9]. Women earn less than men, despite being higher
educated [9]. Women spend almost twice as much time as men performing household chores,
and to a large extent shoulder the main responsibility for their families, including invisible
tasks such as planning for everyday life to run smoothly, in addition to the caring of children
and ailing or sick relatives [9 10]. Furthermore, women continue to be exposed to sexual,
physical and psychological violence from their partners and former partners to a much higher
degree than men [11].
International comparisons on self-reported items of health in several countries have been
made based on WHO world health survey data [12 13]. Gendered differences in health could
be seen in pooled data from all countries with women reporting worse health than men. Social
determinants, mainly employment and education accounted for much of the differences
although some of the differences were unexplained and presumably due to factors not in the
model.
The situation in Sweden shows the same overall picture, women rating worse health than
men, women having higher rates of sick listing particularly long term sick listing [14 15].
Johansson et al. investigated time trends of SRH from 1980 to 2005 in Sweden and found
that SRH became poorer or was unchanged in those aged 16–47 but got better among person
aged 48 or older [16]. Time trend for the period 1997–2006 indicated a highly prevalent,
mental ill-health among the young in Stockholm County, a region representative of urban-
ized Western societies [17]. Swedish women in general and young women in particular
report higher rates of anxiety and depression than men, both associated with poor SRH [9
14]. Concern has been raised over the increasing levels of anxiety and depressive emotions
among young adults [17 18]. As we previously had done some work on comparative self-
rated health and had access to a database from the Northern Sweden Monica study with time
trends among young adults for comparative SRH and factors known to be associated with
SRH we set out to investigate the issue. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies
using comparative self-rated health as an outcome variable among young adults in the Swed-
ish setting. Several factors are associated with SRH. Among these we chose to investigate
time trends of physical activity in leisure time; educational level; Body Mass Index (BMI);
depressive feelings; anxiety; and satisfaction with economy. The rationale for this lies in the
age group investigated where diseases on a population level play a minor role but habits
reflected in BMI, physical activity, psychosocial factors, educational level, satisfaction with
economy, feelings of depression and anxiety are factors that presumably play a greater role
in SRH. These determinants have also been described in the Northern Sweden Monica study
on a population basis for the ages 25–74 [14].
The aim of this article was to investigate time trends of comparative SRH over the period
1990 to 2014 in men and women aged 25–34 years. A secondary aim was to describe time
trends of some determinants.

 Research questions
• Has comparative SRH of men and women aged 25 to 34 changed over the period 1990 to
2014 and if so, in what way?
• Have physical activity in leisure time, educational level, Body Mass Index, depressive feelings,
anxiety and satisfaction with economy changed in the age group during the same period?
• Do associations between comparative SRH and physical activity in leisure time, educational
level, Body Mass Index, depressive feelings, anxiety and satisfaction with economy show the
same pattern for men and women?
Material and methods
The Northern Sweden MONICA study
The Northern Sweden MONICA study is a cross-sectional sequential study primarily focused
on trends and determinants for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the two northernmost
counties in Sweden. Data were collected as independent, randomly selected population-based
cross-sectional samples on six different occasions from 1990 to 2014 [19]. At the time of the
2014 survey, the number of participants cumulative for all years exceeded 12,000 individuals.
All respondents between 25 and 34 years of age (944 women and 867 men) in the MONICA
population between 1990 and 2014 formed the study group of this article. Both postal ques-
tionnaires and questionnaires filled in at visits at local health centres were used.
Comparative self-rated health
Comparative SRH was measured by the question: “How would you rate your health compared
to others the same age: better, the same or worse?”
Determinants
Physical activity in leisure time was assessed with a six-grade categorical scale where respon-
dents rated the intensity and frequency of physical activities the last year ranging from “hardly
ever” to “intense, several times per week”. Answers one and two were classified as low physical
activity in leisure time, three and four as intermediate and five and six as high physical activity.
Length of education was assessed with a 7- or 10-grade categorical scale based on current and
previous Swedish school systems. Nine years of schooling or less was considered as short edu-
cation, 10–12 years of schooling as intermediate education and post-secondary education as
long education. BMI was calculated from measurements of height and weight performed by
trained personnel at local health centres as part of the MONICA study concept. Participants
were also asked if in the last month they “often have felt uneasy, depressed or that the future
seems hopeless” and “have felt nervousness, anxiety or unrest”, with response alternatives
“yes” or “no”. Personal economy was assessed by asking “How satisfied are you with your cur-
rent situation regarding economy?” and providing a 7-grade Likert scale ranging from “very
bad” to “excellent, could not be better”. Answers 1–2 were grouped as discontent with personal
economy, 3–5 as intermediate and 6–7 as content with personal economy. The determinants
of anxiety, depressive feelings and personal economy were introduced in 1999. In the 2014
survey, the items regarding anxiety, depression, personal economy and physical activity were
omitted or rephrased, making these variables impossible to compare. We described data for
determinants from 1990 to 2014 and we used data from 1999 to 2009 for calculations of associ-
ations between determinants and comparative self-rated health.

 Data analyses
Data analyses and statistical calculations were performed using SPSS version 22. We used the
χ2 test to assess whether variations over time in the distribution of categorical variables were
statistically significant. We used Linear-by-Linear Associations to test for trends on a table
with df = 1. Associations between determinants and comparative SRH were assessed in a logis-
tic ordinal regression model. The model uses an ordinal scale of outcomes instead of only two
possible outcomes as in logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio (OR) can be interpreted as
a change in odds when moving to the next category in an independent category/factor (for
instance from intermediate to short educational length). The reference value for the determi-
nants is set as the anticipated most favourable situation. Initially, we performed a univariate
regression to determine crude ORs for all proposed determinants and subsequently a multivar-
iable regression. Analyses were done separately for men and women.
The Northern Sweden MONICA Study has been approved by the regional ethical commit-
tee of Umeå, Sweden
Results
The distribution of comparative self-rated health for men and women is presented in Fig 1.
For men there was an increase of “worse” health, from 8.5% to 10.6% (p for trend 0.385), Men
rating “better” rose from 8.5% to 18.3% (p for trend <0.000). For women, there was an
increase in the proportions rating their health as “worse”, from 8.5% in 1990 to 20.0% in 2014
(p for trend 0.007). However when comparing the overall trends of health no statistical signifi-
cant difference between men and women could be ascertained. Among women, the proportion
rating “better” gradually increased from 4.5% in 1990 to 18.4% in 2009 and then fell to 6.4% in
2014 (p for trend 0.006).
Fig 2 shows absolute numbers and proportion of respondents in each category of compara-
tive SRH and participation rates 1990 to 2014 and time trends for determinants from 1990 to
2014. There has been a downward trend of the participation rate for the survey since 1990; in
2014 the rate for the first time was below 50% in the selected age group.
Time trends for determinants in men and women showed that high physical activity in lei-
sure time rose over time (p for trend men 0.011; women <0.000); as did BMI over 30 (p for
trend men 0 08; women 0.005); nervousness, anxiety or unrest (p for trend men 0.001; women
<0.000) and discontent with personal economy (p for trend men 0.001; women 0.002). For
depression, the trend with increasing percentages answering “yes” was similar in both men
and women but did not reach statistical significance.
The results of the ordinal logistic regression analysis are presented in Fig 3, showing associ-
ations between determinants and comparative SRH as odds ratios. In the multivariable analy-
sis, adjusted for all variables, low and intermediate physical activity, BMI>30 and emotions
of depression, unease or hopelessness retained their statistically significant associations with
comparative SRH. The associations between variables and comparative SRH were similar for
men and women.
Discussion
Principal findings
Over the period 1990 to 2014, the percentage of women rating comparative SRH as “worse”
steadily increased, while the percentage rating “better” rose until 2009 and then fell in the 2014
survey, almost to the level of 1990. Among men, this pattern was almost the opposite, with
increasing proportions rating “better”. There are thus different health trends for men and

 women but we could not ascertain a statistical significant difference in overall health ratings
for men and women. Among both women and men time trends showed an increase in fre-
quency of BMI >30; feelings of nervousness, anxiety or unrest and discontent with economy.
Associations between SRH and determinants were similar for men and women in the period
1999 to 2009.
Findings in relation to the literature
The trends of deteriorating SRH described in this study are in accordance with previous
research in Australia [20]. Caution is however recommended by researchers in interpreting
time trends in general self-rated health among young persons as four national surveys in the
US showed striking discrepancies in time trends [21]. The Public Health Agency of Sweden
uses the five-step general SRH question. Time trends from 1980 in Sweden show bad general
health for men and women hovering between 0.9 and 4.4% without apparent time trend and
only small differences between men and women [22]. The difference in time trends between
these figures and ours could be due to our use of comparative SRH as it reflects the situation
for a larger proportion of the population, around 10–20%, whereas only a few per cent report

 quite poor or poor health. Comparative SRH includes both a statement of health and a com-
parison and thus reflects other aspects of a subjective health evaluation. According to the status
syndrome theory it can be argued that this comparison to others is important.[23]. Following
the same theory, gender inequities and gendered norms are judged important to both the
health and survival gap between women and men [24 8].
Our study shows deteriorating comparative SRH in young women despite Sweden being a
strong welfare state. The rates of unemployed young adults compared to other countries are
low. Large shares of young adults have post-secondary education and a high level of physical
activity. This should make SRH better. Levels of nervousness, anxiety or unrest as well as dis-
content with personal economy have increased and this might worsen SRH. The changes over
time in overall health could hardly be explained by increased prevalence of manifest disease in
the young women in northern Sweden. Social changes not covered in our database have taken
place in Sweden over the studied time periods. During the increased urbanisation in the last
decades more women than men have moved to larger towns, often to study, which might affect

 the demographics of the sparsely populated area and SRH in those who stay. Similar to many
other countries, downsizing and frequent reorganisations are performed in the public sector,
such as health, elderly and social care [25 26] Such changes are related to burnout and stress of
conscience in caregivers [26] and might be linked to the increased long-term sick-listing due
to mental ill health among, particularly, young women (20–29 years) since 2010 [15]. The lack
of equality in the private sphere usually becomes evident when a couple gets children, which
usually happens in the studied ages [8]. Men and women perceive and report gender equality
differently [8]. Women’s experience of gender inequality both at work and at home, create
tiredness, tension and worry, as well as feelings of personal failure [10]. Women in Sweden
also seem to worry more than men about other large collective questions, such as the climate
threat [27]. To our understanding the differences in perceived equality must not be trivialized
or disregarded.

 Our previous work with SRH has taught us the importance of “subjectivity”. In ratings of
SRH, differences do occur even between persons who seemingly share the same situation
when it comes to sex education, income, social capital, wealth, medical health, functional level
etcetera. Yet there can be a discrepancy in SRH. Difference in SRH is associated to hard medi-
cal outcomes such as disease and death [28 2] Causative biological factors are connected to
the subjectivity of SRH [29]. Such links have been found in cytokines and physiological regula-
tion (allostatic) of the human body [30 31]. The concept of allostatic load gives, by measuring
psychophysiological stressors, a quantifiable measure of the pressure put on regulatory systems
in the body striving to uphold equilibrium or homeostasis. The concept encompasses the con-
cept of embodiment, how sociocultural and environmental influences translate to the human
body) [32]. Researchers conclude: “It is becoming increasingly clear how subtle yet longstand-
ing challenges impact on the human physiology and predispose to disease. . .likewise, it is
acknowledged that it is subjective experience, not objectively quantifiable events, that becomes
biologically inscribed.” [32].
It is thus necessary to also include not so “easily measured factors” trying to understand dif-
ferences in SRH between men and women. Young adults in general and young women in par-
ticular suffer from expectations of being successful in school or work, being socially active and
caring about one’s appearance [33]. A shift in the basis of a person’s value from intrinsic per-
sonal qualities and relations to external qualities and achievements such as success in school
or at work, consumption patterns or activities in the leisure time is taking place today [34].
Self-esteem based on achievement is a risk for deteriorating health [34]. Furthermore, in
upholding gender equality two norm systems conflict, the discourse of gender equality and the
traditional family norm system [8]. The tension between these two systems puts a heavy bur-
den on women trying to encompass both norm systems simultaneously.
Why men increasingly report better health is not readily explained. One possible explana-
tion might be found in the development of more diversified norms for how to behave as a
man, how to express oneself and what is expected by men thus putting less pressure on men
and more lenient gendered norms. It has been argued that this gender convergence also might
lead to health convergence for both men and women when it comes to well defined health out-
comes [8 35]. In Sweden, men are leading the trend to less frequent smoking and the trend for
parental leave is rising, although very slowly for men [36 37]. The use of internet might also
give access to a wider array of male norms compared to being confined to models available in
local social life e.g. small towns, rural areas or in isolated social groups.
Regarding both women and men, attention has been drawn to the situation of broken pros-
pects and difficulties for young people in establishing themselves in adult life, such as achieving
a job and finding housing [38]. Experiences of overwhelming stress while entering work life
could be devastating.
Young persons have to orient among all these factors and forces, norms and expectations,
stressors and conflicts. Making meaning of ones’ existence is a never ending human endeavour
and entering adulthood forces this process of orientation and meaning making upon people.
The process of existential meaning making is of great importance for health [39]. The term
existential meaning making encapsulates what resources, strategies, and ideas/notions, indi-
viduals use to face the challenges of life, and to create meaning in one’s life. Attempts have
been made to define the concept operationally, among others by the World Health Organiza-
tion [39 40].
We propose that the issue of meaning making and subjectivity are included and expanded
on, in a gender sensitive way, in efforts trying to understand the different health trends for
men and women described by our data. The way to grasp these matters, we believe, is by

 qualitative research, systematically approaching and understanding stress, health and the effect
of social constructs.
Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study is the time-trend perspective from 1990 to 2014 and the popu-
lation-based methodology of the Northern Sweden MONICA Study. The decreasing participa-
tion rate is a limitation. A comparison of participants and non-participants conducted in 2009
for the Northern Sweden MONICA Study found that non-participants were younger, more
likely to be smokers or to have diabetes and less likely to have a university education [41].
Non-participation is a matter of concern in research [42]. The effects of the dropout, however,
are not entirely clear. We have not found arguments in the literature to claim that the dropouts
are better off than participants, rather the contrary. [43 44]. This might mean that the trends
towards larger proportions of “worse” health ratings in this material are underestimated.
Another limitation is the fact that not all determinants could be followed for the entire ana-
lysed time period.
The questions on anxiety and depressive emotions were not used to indicate psychiatric
disease but are self-reported emotions. The questions are not formally validated but used on
their face value. The questions have, however, been used for many years by the Public Health
Agency of Sweden.
The generalisability of our findings can be discussed. Time trends of comparative SRH
among young adults should be followed in other settings. This might give further information
on the appropriateness of using comparative SRH to follow time trends of health.
Conclusion
Time-trends of comparative self rated health 1990–2014 in the Northern Sweden MONICA
Study show an increase of women rating their health as worse whereas men increased the pro-
portion rating better. Physical activity in leisure time, educational level, BMI, depressive feel-
ings, anxiety and dissatisfaction with economy have also increased during the period. Time
trends for these variables show the same pattern for men and women. Our findings point to
that gender aspects of SRH need to be further explored.
