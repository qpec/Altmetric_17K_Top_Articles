Summary
Background Removal of adenomas reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality; however, the benefit of 
surveillance colonoscopy on colorectal cancer risk remains unclear. We examined heterogeneity in colorectal cancer 
incidence in intermediate-risk patients and the effect of surveillance on colorectal cancer incidence.
Methods We did this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study using routine lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and 
pathology data from patients who, after baseline colonoscopy and polypectomy, were diagnosed with intermediate-
risk adenomas mostly (>99%) between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2010, at 17 hospitals in the UK. These patients are 
currently offered surveillance colonoscopy at intervals of 3 years. Patients were followed up through to Dec 31, 2014.
We assessed the effect of surveillance on colorectal cancer incidence using Cox regression with adjustment for patient, 
procedural, and polyp characteristics. We defined lower-risk and higher-risk subgroups on the basis of polyp and 
procedural characteristics identified as colorectal cancer risk factors. We estimated colorectal cancer incidence and 
standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) using as standard the general population of England in 2007. This trial is 
registered, number ISRCTN15213649.
Findings 253 798 patients who underwent colonic endoscopy were identified, of whom 11 944 with intermediate-risk 
adenomas were included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 7·9 years (IQR 5·6–11·1), 210 colorectal cancers 
were diagnosed. 5019 (42%) patients did not attend surveillance and 6925 (58%) attended one or more surveillance 
visits. Compared to no surveillance, one or two surveillance visits were associated with a significant reduction in 
colorectal cancer incidence rate (adjusted hazard ratio 0·57, 95% CI 0·40–0·80 for one visit; 0·51, 0·31–0·84 for 
two visits). Without surveillance, colorectal cancer incidence in patients with a suboptimal quality colonoscopy, 
proximal polyps, or a high-grade or large adenoma (≥20 mm) at baseline (8865 [74%] patients) was significantly 
higher than in the general population (SIR 1·30, 95% CI 1·06–1·57). By contrast, in patients without these features, 
colorectal cancer incidence was lower than that of the general population (SIR 0·51, 95% CI 0·29–0·84).
Interpretation Colonoscopy surveillance benefits most patients with intermediate-risk adenomas. However, some 
patients are already at low risk after baseline colonoscopy and the value of surveillance for them is unclear.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer morbidity 
and death in developed countries.1 Endoscopic removal 
of adenomas, precursors of most colorectal cancers, 
reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.2–5 
Patients perceived to be at increased risk after adenoma 
removal are recommended surveillance colonoscopy.6–10
National guidelines for adenoma surveillance stratify 
patients into risk groups based mainly on the detection of 
advanced neoplasia (adenomas ≥10 mm or with advanced 
pathology, or cancer) in those attending follow-up 
colonoscopy as a surrogate for long-term colorectal cancer 
incidence. The risk of advanced neoplasia at follow-up 
colonoscopy depends on the number, size, and histology of 
baseline adenomas,11–14 as well as the quality of the baseline 
examination.15,16 UK, European Union (EU), and US 
guidelines define a low-risk group for which no 
surveillance, or surveillance at intervals of 5–10 years, is 
recommended, an intermediate-risk or higher-risk group 
for which surveillance every 3 years is recommended, and 
a high-risk group for which an additional clearing 
colonoscopy within either 12 months (UK and EU) or 
within 3 years (USA) is recommended before continuation 
with surveillance every 3 years.6–10 The recommendation 
for 3-yearly surveillance is based on the results of a 
randomised trial that showed that the cumulative advanced 
neoplasia detection rate was similar between patients who 
had one or two surveillance colonoscopies within 3 years.17 
Although UK and US criteria for 3-yearly surveillance 
differ slightly (UK criteria are one-to-two adenomas 
≥10 mm or three-to-four adenomas <10 mm, whereas US 
criteria are 3–10 adenomas or any adenomas ≥10 mm, with 
villous architecture or high-grade dysplasia), advanced 
neoplasia detection rates at follow-up colonoscopy are 
similar, at 10% in the UK versus 11% in the USA.18 The UK 
guideline recommends stopping 3-yearly surveillance after

two consecutive negative colonoscopies (appendix p 1), 
whereas in the USA, there are no recommended criteria 
for stopping other than older age.
The main aim of adenoma surveillance is to reduce 
the incidence of colorectal cancer, but very few studies 
have used long-term colorectal cancer incidence after 
adenoma removal to define risk groups and need for 
surveillance12,19,20 and none have looked at predictive 
factors for long-term colorectal cancer incidence in 
patients who are currently offered surveillance. About 
20% of colonoscopies in the UK and 25% in the USA 
are for adenoma surveillance,21,22 which puts huge 
pressure on endoscopy resources. Any evidence that 
could help to minimise unnecessary colon 
oscopies 
while ensuring that colonoscopy surveillance is directed 
at patients at highest risk would be of timely importance. 
In this study, we estimated colorectal cancer incidence 
after baseline colonoscopy in patients who are 
recommended 3-yearly surveillance, and assessed the 
effect of surveillance on colorectal cancer incidence. 
We hypothesised that a subgroup of patients exists in 
whom surveillance colonoscopy could be stopped 
earlier, or for whom surveillance is not necessary, on the 
basis of their colorectal cancer incidence.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study using 
information from 17 UK hospitals with electronic records 
of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and pathology data 
recorded for at least 6 years before the start of the study 
in 2006 (appendix p 2). The size of the catchment 
population for the 17 hospitals was estimated to be more 
than 6·5 million people.23,24
Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if 
they had a baseline colonoscopy and newly diagnosed 
intermediate-risk adenomas according to UK guidelines, 
defined as one-to-two large (≥10 mm) adenomas, or three-
to-four small adenomas (appendix p 1). We excluded 
patients with a history of bowel resection, colorectal 
cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, a family history of 
colorectal cancer, or any endoscopies without a date.
We searched gastrointestinal endoscopy databases to 
identify patients who underwent colonic examination 
before Dec 31, 2010, then we searched pathology databases 
for reports of colorectal lesions, using Systematised 
Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes (versions 2 
and 3), Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) 
codes, keywords, or multiple search terms. Endoscopy 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the start of the study in 2006, we searched MEDLINE 
via PubMed for available evidence, although we did not 
complete a systematic review. The existing guidelines for 
colonoscopic surveillance after adenoma detection were 
developed in 2002. High-risk, intermediate-risk, and low-risk 
groups were identified, and an appropriate surveillance 
strategy was developed for each. This guideline was accepted 
by the British Society of Gastroenterology and the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A 3 year surveillance 
interval was indicated for those at intermediate risk on the 
basis of evidence from a randomised trial that compared 
different surveillance intervals for the detection of advanced 
adenomas at follow-up. In 2012, a study in France 
investigated colorectal cancer risk in patients diagnosed with 
adenomas in the 1990s. The results of the study showed a 
clear benefit from surveillance in patients with one or more 
advanced adenomas, whereas in those with only 
non-advanced adenomas, the benefit was less marked. 
Nevertheless, the investigators concluded that 
gastroenterologists should encourage patients to comply 
with long-term surveillance. The study did not account for 
the confounding effects of colonoscopy quality on 
subsequent colorectal cancer risk. Evidence suggests that the 
quality of colonoscopy has improved and that the number of 
missed or incompletely removed lesions has decreased since 
the publication of a UK national colonoscopy audit in 2001, 
leading to implementation of national training standards and 
quality assessments. No study has yet assessed the effect of 
surveillance on long-term colorectal cancer risk among 
patients offered 3-yearly surveillance, who represent most 
patients offered surveillance.
Added value of this study
Our study assessed colorectal cancer risk in patients considered 
to be at intermediate risk. Across 8 years of follow-up, our data 
identified risk factors for colorectal cancer at baseline 
colonoscopy that permitted further stratification of these 
patients into lower-risk and higher-risk subgroups. Patients 
with an incomplete colonoscopy, poor bowel preparation, 
proximal polyps, or a high-grade or large adenoma (≥20 mm) 
at baseline were at increased risk, and the first surveillance 
colonoscopy significantly reduced colorectal cancer risk. 
By contrast, in patients without these baseline colonoscopy 
findings, future risk of colorectal cancer was already lower than 
that in the general population before any surveillance.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results show that most patients who are currently offered 
3-yearly surveillance colonoscopy benefit substantially from 
attending at least one surveillance visit. However, about a third 
of these patients are at low risk compared with the general 
population and are unlikely to benefit substantially from 
colonoscopy surveillance. About 20% of colonoscopies in the 
UK and 25% in the US are done for adenoma surveillance, which 
puts a huge pressure on endoscopy resources. Evidence from 
this study will be important in informing future adenoma 
surveillance guidelines and will help to minimise the costs and 
risks associated with unnecessary colonoscopies.

and pathology reports were linked and pseudonymised 
before being entered into an Oracle (11g Enterprise 
Edition) database. We coded patient, procedural, and 
polyp data using data entry constraints, standard operating 
procedures, and regular data audits to check coding 
consistency. Further details on hospital data collection and 
standard operating procedures are available in the 
appendices of our National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report.25
We divided endoscopic examinations into visits (ie, one 
or more examinations made in close succession to 
complete a full examination of the colon and remove 
detected lesions). If there was evidence that a lesion 
had been incompletely removed, and a surveillance 
examination was scheduled soon after, we included that 
examination in the baseline visit. We used a hierarchy of 
rules to assign a summary value for the size, histology, and 
location of lesions seen at multiple examinations.25 
Completeness of colonoscopy, and quality of bowel 
preparation26 were defined by the most complete 
examination and the best bowel preparation during the 
baseline visit. Baseline colonoscopy was defined as 
suboptimal if the most complete examination was 
incomplete or of unknown completeness or if the best 
bowel preparation was poor. Bowel preparation quality and 
completeness of colonoscopy, as assessed by the endos-
copist, were obtained from endoscopy reports when not 
included as a separate field in the endoscopy database.
Patient, procedural, and polyp characteristics at baseline 
assessed as a-priori risk factors and confounders included 
age at first adenoma detection, sex, completeness of 
colonoscopy, quality of bowel preparation (graded as 
excellent, good, adequate or satisfactory, and poor),26 year 
of entry (year first adenoma detected), and adenoma 
number (total number recorded at baseline), size (largest 
at baseline), histology and grade of dysplasia (worst at 
baseline), and polyp location. We defined polyps as 
proximal if they were proximal to the descending colon. 
Data on lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol 
consumption, were not available.
We ascertained the presence of colorectal cancers from 
hospital pathology reports and from National Health 
Service (NHS) Digital, the NHS Central Register (NHSCR), 
and National Services Scotland (NSS). Mortality data were 
provided by NHS Digital, NHSCR, and NSS.
Ethics approval was granted by the Royal Free Research 
Ethics Committee (reference 06/Q0501/45). Approval 
for use of patient information without consent was 
granted by the Patient Information Advisory Group 
under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 
(PIAG 1–05[e]/2006). The study protocol is available 
online. 
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was incident adenocarcinoma of 
the colorectum. This outcome excluded in-situ cancer. 
We assumed that cancers later diagnosed in lesions 
identified at baseline had been incompletely resected if 
baseline examinations showed that they were left intact 
or partly removed, were in the same or adjacent segment 
of the colon, and had similar histology; such cancers 
were excluded from the analysis.
Our sample size calculations stipulated that estimates 
of the colorectal cancer incidence rate have a coefficient of 
variation of about 30% (ie, the standard error of the 
estimate would be 30% of the actual estimate). Assuming 
conservatively a rate of two colorectal cancers per 
1000 
person-years,20,27,28 
an 
approximate 
Poisson 
distribution of incidence, and a simple univariate 
estimate of the rate, then nine colorectal cancer events 
and 4500 person-years in any given subgroup would give 
a coefficient of variation of 33%. Assuming a smallest 
subgroup of interest of 15% of the cohort, we required at 
least 30 000 person-years (4500 divided by 0·15) and 
60 colorectal cancers, or a total cohort of 6000 patients 
with at least 5 years of follow-up. Because inclusion of 
covariates might increase standard errors, we aimed to 
include at least 10 000 patients.
We censored time-to-event data at first colorectal cancer 
diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2014, for

patients matched to national data sources or date of last 
recorded procedure for unmatched patients. Patients who 
could not be traced through national sources and who did 
not attend surveillance were excluded from the analysis. 
Time at risk started from the last examination at baseline, 
and exposure to successive surveillance visits started at 
the last procedure in each visit. Some analyses divided 
each patient’s follow-up time into three distinct periods; 
without surveillance (from start of time at risk, censored 
at any first surveillance); after first surveillance (from 
first surveillance, censored at any second surveillance); 
and after second surveillance (from second surveillance to 
final date of censoring).
We compared baseline characteristics in patients with 
and without surveillance visits using χ² tests. We created 
an unknown category for variables with missing data. 
We did not use multiple imputation or inverse probability 
weighting to deal with missing data.
We used one minus the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the 
survival function to show time to cancer diagnosis and to 
estimate the cumulative incidence of cancer with 
95% CIs at 3, 5, and 10 years; we used the log-rank test to 
compare subgroups. We examined the effects of 
surveillance 
and 
patient, 
procedural, 
and 
polyp 
characteristics at baseline on long-term colorectal cancer 
incidence using Cox proportional hazards models.
We used univariable models to estimate unadjusted 
hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs. We identified indepen-
dent predictors of colorectal cancer incidence in a 
multivariable model, using backward stepwise selection 
with a p value less than 0·05 in the likelihood ratio test as 
the criterion for retention of variables. The number of 
surveillance visits was included as a time-varying 
covariate and was constrained to be included in the 
multivariable model.
Using baseline polyp and procedural risk factors 
identified from the multivariable model, we stratified the 
intermediate-risk cohort into lower-risk and higher-risk 
subgroups. We did not include age as a factor in defining 
the higher-risk subgroup in our study because risks of 
adverse events increase with age coincidental with 
general decline in health, and older age is associated with 
worse colonoscopy quality.29,30 We calculated expected 
numbers of colorectal cancers by multiplying the 
observed sex and 5-year age-group-specific person-years 
by the corresponding incidence in the general population 
of England in 2007
.31 We report the ratio of observed to 
expected cases as a standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 
and 95% CIs assumed an exact Poisson distribution.
We did all analyses with Stata/IC 13.1. This study is 
registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN15213649.

between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2010. We excluded 
223 539 patients: 174 978 with no adenomas, 45 717 with 
colorectal cancer or other conditions associated with 
increased colorectal cancer risk, 2752 with no colonoscopy, 
and 92 with missing procedure dates. Of the remaining 
30 259 patients with a histologically confirmed adenoma 
at 
baseline, 
11 995 
(40%) 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
intermediate-risk adenomas, of whom 51 could not be 
traced in national data sources and had no surveillance, 
leaving 11 944 patients for analysis (figure 1).
The median age of 11 944 intermediate-risk patients 
was 66·7 years (IQR 58·4–74·0) and 6625 (55%) were 
men (table 1). The baseline visit included the first 
endoscopy at which an adenoma was observed and in 
most cases consisted of just one (6826 [57%] patients) or 
two (3788 [32%]) procedures; 19 072 (99·5%) of 
19 164 baseline procedures were endoscopies and 
92 (0·5%) were surgeries. 
Compared with the 5019 (42%) patients who did not 
attend surveillance, the 6925 (58%) who attended one or 
more surveillance visits were younger, a greater proportion 
were male, and a greater proportion had a large adenoma 
(≥20 mm), an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, an 
earlier date of diagnosis, and missing data. Although the 
p value for adenoma histology was significant there was 
no clear trend of increasing villousness between the 
groups. A lower proportion of patients who attended at 
least one surveillance visit had an incomplete colonoscopy 
or poor bowel preparation than did patients who did not 
attend any visits (table 1). The median time from baseline 
to first attended surveillance visit was 2·9 years 
(IQR 1·3–3·4).
During 101 034 person-years of follow-up (median 
7·9 years, IQR 5·6–11·1), 3781 (32%) patients died 
and 210 colorectal cancers were diagnosed, giving an

(95% CI 182–238; table 2). Of the 5019 patients who did 
not attend surveillance, 2326 (46%) died and 121 (2%) 
were diagnosed with cancer, whereas of the 6925 patients 
who attended one or more surveillance visits, 1455 (21%) 
died and 89 (1%) were diagnosed with cancer. After 
adjustment for baseline risk factors, compared with 
no surveillance, one or two surveillance visits were 
associated with a significant reduction in colorectal cancer 
incidence rate (HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·40–0·80 for one visit; 
0·51, 0·31–0·84 for two visits); a similar reduction in 
incidence rate was seen with three or more surveillance 
examinations (HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·29–0·99; table 2).
Baseline characteristics independently associated with 
increased colorectal cancer incidence included older age, 
adenomas of 20 mm or larger, adenomas with high-grade 
dysplasia, polyps in the proximal colon, a colonoscopy 
that was incomplete or of unknown completeness, and 
poor quality bowel preparation (table 2). Adenoma 
histology was only significantly associated with colorectal 
cancer incidence if the unknown histology category was 
included in the model. Sex, number of adenomas, and 
year of entry were not independently associated with 
colorectal cancer incidence (table 2). Other baseline 
variables not included in the multivariable model are 
listed in the appendix (p 3).
On the basis of the polyp and procedural characteristics 
identified as colorectal cancer risk factors (but not older 
age), we divided the cohort into lower-risk (3079 [26%] 
patients) and higher-risk (8865 [74%]) subgroups. 
The higher-risk subgroup consisted of patients who, at 
baseline, had a large adenoma (≥20 mm), high-grade 
dysplasia, proximal polyps, or a suboptimal colonoscopy. 
The lower-risk subgroup consisted of patients without 
any of these findings. Colorectal cancer incidence was 
247 cancers per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 214–285) in 
the higher-risk subgroup versus 93 cancers per 100 000 
person-years (95% CI 63–139) in the lower-risk subgroup 
(table 3).
Patients in the higher-risk subgroup were older, had 
entered the study earlier, and had significantly more 
surveillance visits than those in the lower-risk subgroup 
(appendix p 4). However, median follow-up times were 
similar (8·0 years [IQR 5·5–11·3] in the higher-risk 
subgroup vs 7·8 years [5·7–10·6] in the lower-risk 
subgroup). Among higher-risk patients, number of 
surveillance visits was inversely associated with colorectal 
cancer incidence; by contrast, in the lower-risk subgroup, 
the number of surveillance visits was not associated with 
colorectal cancer incidence; however, statistical power 
was limited because of the low number of cancers (n=24 
in total; table 3). In higher-risk patients with a suboptimal 
quality examination only, surveillance was not associated 
with colorectal cancer incidence; however, in those 
patients with high-risk polyps only, or in those with both 
risk factors, surveillance was associated with lower 
cancer incidence (table 3).

The final multivariable model included number of surveillance visits, age, adenoma size, adenoma dysplasia, proximal polyps, completeness of colonoscopy, and bowel preparation quality; for these variables the 
multivariable HR reported was that from the final multivariable model and the p value was that for inclusion of the variable in the model from the likelihood ratio test. The multivariable HR and associated p value 
reported for sex, adenoma histology, and year of entry (variables not included in the final multivariable model), were for if the variable was added as an additional variable to the final multivariable model. Adenoma 
histology was not included in the final multivariable model because it was selected for inclusion only if the unknown category was included. HR=hazard ratio. *Number of surveillance visits was included in the models 
as a time-varying covariate; if a patient had any surveillance visits, they contributed person-years to more than one category of number of surveillance visits. †No multivariable hazard ratio and p value was reported 
for number of adenomas because of multicollinearity with largest adenoma size (largest size <10 mm perfectly predicts ≥3 adenomas).

Without surveillance, colorectal cancer incidence at 10 
years was 2·7% (95% CI 2·1–3·4; 114 cancers) in the 
cohort 
overall; 
incidence 
was 
3·3% 
(2·6–4·2; 
101 cancers) in the higher-risk subgroup and 1·1% 
(0·5–2·3; 13 cancers) in the lower-risk subgroup 
(table 4). Colorectal cancer incidence in the whole cohort 
was not significantly different from that of the general 
population (SIR 1·09, 95% CI 0·91–1·30); however, 
colorectal cancer incidence was significantly higher in 
the higher-risk subgroup (SIR 1·30, 1·06–1·57) and 
significantly lower in the lower-risk subgroup (SIR 0·51, 
0·29–0·84) than in the general population (table 4; 
figure 2A and B).
After a single surveillance visit, colorectal cancer 
incidence at 10 years was 2·3% (95% CI 1·6–3·3; 
47 cancers) in the cohort overall, 2·8% (1·9–4·1; 
42 cancers) in the higher-risk subgroup, and 0·7% 
(0·2–1·7; five cancers) in the lower-risk subgroup (table 4). 
Compared with the general population, the SIR for 
colorectal cancer was 0·80 (95% CI 0·59–1·05) in the 
overall cohort, 0·42 (95% CI 0·16–0·92) in the lower-risk 
subgroup, and 0·90 (95% CI 0·66–1·21) in the higher-risk 
subgroup (table 4; figure 2C and D). Following a second 
surveillance visit, colorectal cancer incidence at 10 years 
was 2·0% (1·4–3·1; 29 cancers) overall and 2·2% (1·5–3·4; 
26 cancers) in the higher-risk subgroup; the lower-risk

p values are for the log-rank test comparing incidence in the higher-risk versus the lower-risk subgroup. *One minus the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer. †Expected 
colorectal cancers were calculated by multiplying the sex and 5-year age-group-specific incidence rates in the general population of England in 2007 by the age-and-sex specific numbers of observed person-years. ‡The higher-risk subgroup included

[20mm or larger] adenoma), or both; the lower-risk subgroup included patients without any of these risk factors.

subgroup analyses were underpowered because only three 
colorectal cancers had been diagnosed by 10 years (table 4).
Discussion
In this retrospective, multicentre, cohort study, colon-
oscopy surveillance was associated with a substantially 
reduced incidence of colorectal cancer in these 
intermediate-risk patients, who are currently offered 
surveillance colonoscopy at 3-year intervals. The first 
surveillance visit seemed to confer the most benefit and 
was associated with a significantly reduced colorectal 
cancer incidence rate compared with no surveillance; 
this incidence reduction was maintained in patients 
who attended subsequent visits. In the UK, about 
20% of colonoscopies are done for the purpose of 
surveillance.21 In our dataset 80% of patients undergoing 
adenoma surveillance were at intermediate risk 
(figure 1).21
We identified a subgroup of patients at higher risk of 
colorectal cancer, which included roughly three-quarters 
of this intermediate-risk cohort. This subgroup consisted 
of patients who had a suboptimal quality colonoscopy 
(incomplete, of unknown completeness, or poor bowel 
preparation), a large adenoma (≥20 mm), an adenoma 
with high-grade dysplasia, or proximal polyps detected at 
baseline; surveillance was highly effective in this 
subgroup and was associated with a significant reduction 
in the incidence of colorectal cancer. By contrast, in 
patients without these baseline findings, the benefit of 
surveillance was unclear because only a few cancers were 
subsequently diagnosed.
Patients with intermediate-risk adenoma are offered 
surveillance at 3-year intervals because they are perceived 
to be at increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with 
the general population. This perception is based on high 
detection rates of advanced neoplasia in those who attend 
surveillance11–14 and on follow-up of patients diagnosed in 
the 1980s and 1990s;12,19,20 colorectal cancer risk has not 
previously been quantified by use of data in an era of 
higher quality colonoscopies. We found that colorectal 
cancer incidence in the absence of surveillance was 
similar to that expected in the general population,

suggesting that intensive surveillance might not be 
appropriate for all intermediate-risk patients. However, 
in the higher-risk subgroup, colorectal cancer incidence 
without surveillance was significantly higher than that of 
the general population; therefore, individuals in this 
subgroup might benefit from at least one surveillance 
visit. By contrast, in the lower-risk subgroup, the 
colorectal cancer incidence was already lower than that of 
the general population after baseline colonoscopy, with a 
10-year cumulative incidence of only 1·1%. This low 
baseline incidence raises uncertainty as to whether any 
surveillance is warranted for these individuals.
Some of the independent risk factors for colorectal 
cancer that we identified within this intermediate-risk 
group have been described as risk factors for detection of 
advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy, including 
larger adenoma size, older patient age, and having only a 
suboptimal quality baseline colonoscopy.11–16 A less well 
documented risk factor was the presence of polyps in the 
proximal colon, which in our study was associated with an 
increased incidence of colorectal cancer. This finding 
corroborates data from two previous studies reporting that 
patients with proximal polyps had an 80% increased risk of 
advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy.14,32 This 
evidence suggests that proximal polyps could be regarded 
as a colorectal cancer risk factor in future iterations of 
surveillance guidelines. Data on lifestyle risk factors were 
not available. However, results from a large pooled analysis 
of 9167 men and women showed that body-mass index, 
smoking, and family history, which are often important 
epidemiological risk factors, are not major predictors of 
metachronous advanced neoplasia at surveillance after 
adjustment for the baseline adenoma characteristics.14
Our results emphasise the importance of achieving 
a complete colonoscopy with good quality bowel 
preparation. Having a suboptimal quality baseline 
examination was associated with a doubling in colorectal 
cancer incidence irrespective of polyp characteristics. In 
the UK, colonoscopies are done by gastroenterologists, 
surgeons, and specialist nurses. Since the national 
colonoscopy audit in 2001,33 there has been heightened 
awareness of colonoscopy standards and implementation 
of national quality assessments and training pro-
grammes,21,34,35 resulting in substantial improvements in 
endoscopy quality and leading to nearly 30% fewer 
cancers arising from missed or incompletely removed 
lesions within 3 years of colonoscopy in 2007 than in 
2001.36
Patient factors, such as older age, female sex, having 
prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, and obesity might also 
affect the quality of a bowel preparation or colonoscopy.37–42 
In the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme 
(BCSP), examinations to complete an investigation of the 
colon and remove detected lesions are regarded as part of 
the initial work-up, with surveillance only considered 
when baseline examinations have been completed; this 
would be a good policy to adopt for patients diagnosed 
with adenomas outside of the BCSP. For individuals in 
whom colonoscopy is problematic, the clinician should 
establish on a case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate 
to recommend colonoscopy surveillance.
In our study, 42% of patients did not attend surveillance. 
More non-attenders than attenders were female, aged 
75 years or older, or had an incomplete colonoscopy or poor 
bowel preparation. Other factors that we were unable to 
assess but which are likely to affect attendance for 
surveillance include the health status of the patient, 
administrative problems in scheduling an appointment 
3 years in advance, and patient choice, especially if they had 
either a bad experience with the index colonoscopy or the 
reasons for surveillance were not well explained.
The main strengths of this study are the generation of 
a high-quality detailed dataset by use of a large nationwide 
sample of routinely collected clinical endoscopy and 
pathology data on colonoscopies for consecutive patients 
with adenomas across 17 UK hospitals, which serve a 
combined population of more than 6·5 million people.23 
Follow-up for cancer and death was complete for almost 
all patients and, apart from data on bowel preparation 
quality, very few data were missing. Finally, we studied 
incidence in a large number of patients with intermediate-
risk adenomas, about 84% of whom had their baseline 
colonoscopy after the implementation of national quality 
improvement programmes beginning in 2000.
The main limitation of this study is that it is an 
observational study and therefore we cannot assume a 
causal association between surveillance and colorectal 
cancer incidence. However, we saw a large significant 
effect of surveillance both before and after adjustment for 
several potential confounding factors. Standardised data 
cleaning further minimised the risk of bias arising from 
measurement error or misclassification, although some 
misclassification is inevitable within routinely collected 
data. However, this misclassification is likely to have been 
non-differential and would have been more likely to have 
caused an underestimation of effects. Missing values 
were more common in patients attending surveillance 
than in those who did not. This difference was only 
substantial for the bowel preparation and colonoscopy 
completeness variables, suggesting that when a future 
surveillance visit was planned, there was less of a 
tendency to record the quality of the initial examination. 
A further limitation is that conclusions were based on a 
median of 7·9 years of follow-up and longer-term follow-
up is needed to substantiate our findings, especially in 
the lower-risk subgroup without surveillance. Finally, 
although follow-up examinations were assumed to be for 
surveillance, some might have been for symptomatic 
purposes.
We conclude from our results that patients diagnosed 
with intermediate-risk adenomas are at only a small 
increased risk of developing colorectal cancer after their 
baseline colonoscopy and polypectomy compared with 
the general population, especially if they have had a good

quality baseline colonoscopy; therefore, it is unclear 
whether all of these intermediate-risk patients need 
the currently recommended 3-yearly surveillance by 
colonoscopy. Among patients in the lower-risk subgroup, 
surveillance might not be warranted at all if baseline 
colonoscopy is complete, with good visibility of the bowel 
mucosa and all lesions completely excised. Patients with 
a suboptimal quality examination at baseline should have 
a good quality colonoscopy before their surveillance 
strategy is determined. In patients for whom a good 
quality colonoscopy is not possible, an alternative form of 
surveillance should be sought if appropriate. Patients 
with large adenomas (≥20 mm), high-grade dysplasia, or 
proximal polyps are likely to benefit significantly from at 
least one surveillance examination. Future studies should 
examine whether alternative strategies to surveillance 
colonoscopy might suffice for some patients. Additionally, 
future research should aim to define the subgroup of 
intermediate-risk patients for whom the risk of colorectal 
cancer after first surveillance is so low that they can stop 
surveillance altogether.
