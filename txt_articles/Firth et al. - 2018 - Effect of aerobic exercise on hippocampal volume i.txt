Abstract  
Hippocampal volume increase in response to aerobic exercise has been consistently 
observed in animal models. However, the evidence from human studies is equivocal. We 
undertook a systematic review to identify all controlled trials examining the effect of aerobic 
exercise on the hippocampal volumes in humans, and applied meta-analytic techniques to 
determine if aerobic exercise resulted in volumetric increases. We also sought to establish 
how volume changes differed in relation to unilateral measures of left/right hippocampal 
volume, and across the lifespan. A systematic search identified 4398 articles, of which 14 
were eligible for inclusion in the primary analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis showed 
no significant effect of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal volume across the 737 
participants. However, aerobic exercise had significant positive effects on left hippocampal 
volume in comparison to control conditions. Post-hoc analyses indicated effects were driven 
through exercise preventing the volumetric decreases which occur over time. These results 
provide meta-analytic evidence for exercise-induced volumetric retention in the left 
hippocampus. Aerobic exercise interventions may be useful for preventing age-related 
hippocampal deterioration and maintaining neuronal health.

1. Introduction 
The hippocampus is one of the major brain sites of neuroplasticity, and has been 
identified as a brain region sensitive to the effects of physical activity, and in 
particular aerobic exercise interventions (Cotman et al., 2007). The impact of aerobic 
exercise on hippocampal size and function has been extensively studied in rodents 
(Van Praag et al., 2005).  These animal studies have shown that voluntary exercise is 
associated with hippocampal neurogenesis (Van Praag, 2008) and prevents age-
related decline in cell-proliferation in this brain structure. Changes in hippocampal 
structure may be mediated by trophic factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 
(IGF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Ferris et al., 2007; Vaynman et 
al., 2004). Angiogenesis may also contribute, with evidence that dentate gyrus 
cerebral blood volume (CBV) is increased after exercise in rodents (Swain et al., 
2003; Van Praag et al., 2005). In addition, dentate gyrus CBV was significantly 
associated with increased oxygen uptake (V02) following aerobic exercise in healthy 
human volunteers (r= .66, p < 0.05,) (Pereira et al., 2007). Such changes have also 
been linked to cognitive benefits in both animal and human studies (Adlard et al., 
2005; Kimhy et al., 2015). 
Whilst there is clear evidence in animal studies that exercise training is associated 
with increased hippocampal neurogenesis, the evidence from human studies is 
equivocal. Along with a recent meta-analysis showing that physical activity is 
correlated with greater white matter volume (Sexton et al., 2016), there are also 
several studies reporting cross-sectional relationships between physical activity

levels and hippocampal volumes (Erickson et al., 2010). However, determining 
causality from such correlational analyses is not possible. 
Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported exercise-induced increases 
in hippocampal volumes.  For instance, Pajonk et al. (2010a) and Erickson et al. 
(2011a) demonstrated that exercise increased hippocampal volumes among people 
with schizophrenia and older adults respectively.  A previous review of exercise-
induced changes in brain regions implicated in the default mode network also 
presented some preliminary evidence that exercise increased right hippocampal 
volume (Li et al., 2016). However, these findings were limited to four studies, with a 
combined total of 132 participants receiving exercise interventions. Since this 
review, a number of large controlled studies have been published (e.g. Jonasson et 
al., 2016; Maas et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015; Rosano et al., 2016; Malchow et al., 
Thomas et al., 2016) – but again with equivocal findings.  
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of 
aerobic exercise interventions on hippocampal volumes in human subjects. We 
included controlled studies conducted in human subjects, regardless of age or 
clinical status. We also conducted a range of subgroup analyses to explore effects of 
exercise in unilateral measures of left/right hippocampal volume, and establish 
effects on the hippocampus in clinical and non-clinical populations. Additionally, we 
employed meta-regression techniques to examine how exercise effects differed with 
age.

2. Methods 
2.1. Search Procedure 
This systematic review was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database 
(#CRD42014009686) and was conducted in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines 
(Stroup et al., 2000) and in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard (Moher et al., 2009). Two 
independent authors (SR, JF) searched Medline, PsycARTICLES, AMED, Embase and 
CINAHL from database inception to August 14th 2017 for controlled intervention 
studies. Key words used were “exercise” AND “hippocampus” OR “hippocampal 
volume” in the title, abstract or index term fields. Manual searches were also 
conducted using the reference lists from recovered articles. After the removal of 
duplicates, both reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of all potentially eligible 
articles. Both authors applied the eligibility criteria, and a list of full text articles was 
developed through consensus. The two reviewers then considered the full texts of 
these articles and the final list of included articles was reached through consensus. A 
third reviewer (BS) was available for mediation throughout this process, however 
this was not required due to consistent agreement between reviewers.  
2.2. Participants 
Inclusion in this review was restricted to studies of adults aged at least 18 years. 
Studies were included regardless of clinical diagnosis at the time of assessment. All 
populations were used in main analysis, with subgroup analyses used to explore how 
the effects of exercise on hippocampal volume differ with respect to clinical status.

2.3. Interventions 
Exercise interventions were defined as physical activity that is planned, structured, 
repetitive and purposive in the sense that improvement or maintenance of physical 
fitness or health as an objective (Caspersen et al. 1985). We restricted this review to 
aerobic exercise interventions only and excluded other physical activity interventions 
such as resistance training, as these alternative methods of exercise have different 
neurological actions to aerobic training (Cassilhas et al., 2012).   
2.4. Control conditions 
Studies were considered eligible if they examined the effects of a structured, aerobic 
exercise intervention on hippocampal volumes in comparison to an inactive control 
condition, or a time-and-attention matched comparator of minimal activity (such as 
stretching or balance training), of a similar duration. Studies which compared two 
forms of aerobic exercise, without a non-aerobic exercise comparator, were unable 
to be included. 
2.5. Outcome measures 
The primary outcome measure was absolute hippocampal volume assessed via 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and estimated using either manual 
tracing or automated methods. We included both bilateral and unilateral (i.e. left 
and right) measures of the hippocampus.  The method of assessment was recorded. 
When more than three studies were identified recruiting participants with similar 
diagnoses (e.g. mental disorders), subgroup analyses were conducted.

2.6. Exclusion criteria 
We excluded studies with: (a) insufficient data for extraction of primary outcome 
data; (b) restriction to children and/or adolescents, (c) animal studies and (d) non-
exercise interventions. In the case of multiple publications from the same study, only 
the most relevant paper or article was included. There were no language or time 
restrictions placed upon identified articles. 
2.7. Quality assessment 
The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane’s Collaboration risk 
of bias tool (Higgins, 2011). This tool was applied to rank each study for ‘Low’, ‘High’ 
or ‘Unclear’ risk of bias for six aspects of trial design that could introduce different 
sources of bias (sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of 
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, other 
sources).  
2.9. Statistical Analyses 
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
software (Version 2). Intervention effect sizes (differences between intervention and 
control groups) for the primary outcome measure (hippocampal volume) at post-
treatment, were calculated using Hedges’ g statistic, along with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) around the estimated effect-size. Intervention effect sizes were also 
calculated to determine effects of exercise on hippocampal volume in (i) studies 
using automated vs. manual segmentation methods, and (ii) unilateral measures of 
left and right hippocampal volume. No study reported a pre and post-test

correlation, therefore we assumed a conservative correlation of 0.7 for the primary 
outcome. Effect sizes were categorized as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or large (0.8 or 
greater (Cohen, 1988). Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic: 
I2 of more than 75% is considered to indicate considerable heterogeneity, I2 of 50%–
75% is considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity, and an I2 of less than 40% is 
considered to indicate limited heterogeneity. Publication bias was tested using the 
Egger’s regression method and Begg & Mazumdar test, with a p-value <0.05 
suggesting the presence of bias (Begg and Mazumdar, 1994; Egger et al., 1997). 
Where significant bias was detected, a Duval and Tweedie (2000) trim-and-fill 
analysis was applied. In addition, a funnel plot was created, in which the study-
specific effect estimates are displayed in relation to the standard error in order to 
assess the potential presence of publication bias. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
to examine the effects of exercise on bilateral and unilateral hippocampal volume 
for any population studied by >2 trials. Furthermore, meta-regression analyses were 
used to explore the relationship between mean sample age (years) and intervention 
effect size.

3.1. Search results and flow of trials through the review 
A total of 4398 records were identified, reduced to 2260 after duplicates were 
removed. After screening and the application of the eligibility criteria, 14 eligible 
studies were identified and included in the primary meta-analysis (hippocampal 
volume). Figure 1 presents the flow of studies through the review.

3.2. Characteristics of Included Trials 
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of included trials, including participant 
characteristics, summary of the intervention, and control group protocol. Fourteen 
trials were included, with eligible outcome data from 737 participants. Participants 
mean age in the included trials ranged from ranged from 24 to 76 years (median = 66 
years). Four studies recruited participants with a DSM diagnosis of schizophrenia or 
other psychotic disorders (Lin et al., 2015; Malchow et al., 2016; Pajonk et al., 2010a; 
Scheewe et al., 2013a), six recruited healthy older adults (Burzynska et al., 2017; 
Erickson et al., 2011a; Kleemeyer et al., 2016; Maass et al., 2015; Niemann et al., 
2014b; Rosano et al., 2016), whilst individual studies examined the effects of 
exercise of hippocampal volumes in people with depression (Krogh et al., 2014a), 
mild cognitive impairment (Brinke et al., 2014), probable Alzheimer’s disease (Morris 
et al., 2017), and healthy young-middle aged adults (Thomas et al., 2016). Study 
participants were recruited from the general community (Burzynska et al., 2017; 
Erickson et al., 2011a; Jonasson et al., 2016; Kleemeyer et al., 2016; Krogh et al.,

2014b; Maass et al., 2015; Niemann et al., 2014b; Rosano et al., 2016; Thomas et al.,

treatment or referred from clinical settings (Lin et al., 2015; Malchow et al., 2015; 
Morris et al., 2017; Pajonk et al., 2010a; Scheewe et al., 2013b).  
Risk of bias assessments found that studies varied in their quality and only three 
studies met the Cochrane standard for Low Risk of bias on all criteria (Burzynska et 
al., 2017; Krogh et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015). The results of bias assessments for each 
study are displayed in Supplement 1.  
3.3. Interventions 
Four of the studies utilised a stationary cycling intervention (Thomas et al., 2016, 
Krogh et al., 2016; Pajonk et al., 2010; Malchow et al., 2015), five studies 
investigated walking-based interventions (Burzynska et al., 2017; Niemann et al., 
2014; Erickson et al., 2011; Brinke et al., 2015; Rosano et al., 2016), four combined 
multiple modalities of aerobic exercise (Lin et al., 2015; Jonasson et al., 2016; Morris 
et al., 2017; Scheewe et al., 2013;), and one used treadmill running (Maas et al., 
2015). The length of the interventions ranged from three to 24 months with a range 
of 2-5 sessions per week (see Table 1). All studies used supervised exercise sessions.

350 controls) showed a non-significant effect of exercise on total hippocampal 
volume (Hedges g = 0.120, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.26, p=0.082, Figure 2). There was some 
no evidence of heterogeneity (Q=14.05, p=0.371, I2=7.45%) and indication of 
publication bias (Kendall tau=0.451, p=0.014, Eggers regression =0.771, p=0.13). The 
trim-and-fill analysis identified one outlier studies introducing publication bias, 
further reducing the non-significant effect (Adjusted g=0.104, 95% CI=-0.05 to 0.26). 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed that null effects of exercise on hippocampal volume 
were found from studies using automated segmentation (N=7, n=407, g=0.167, 95% 
C.I.= -0.01 to 0.34, p=0.06) and manual segmentation (N=6, n=254, g=0.118, 95% 
C.I.= -0.13 to 36, p=0.34), with no significant differences between these two 
methods (Q=0.113, p=0.74).  
Figure 2 here 
Meta-analyses were also performed for the nine studies (total n=501) that reported 
changes in left and right hippocampal volumes separately (Figure 3). This showed no 
significant effect of exercise on right hippocampal volumes (g=0.164, 95% CI= -0.01 
to 0.34, p=0.065). However, aerobic exercise had significant positive effects on left 
hippocampal volume in comparison to control conditions (g=0.265, 95% CI= 0.09 to 
0.44, p=0.003) and there was no indication of heterogeneity (I2=0%) or publication 
bias influencing these results (Kendall tau=0.19, p=0.23, Eggers regression=0.23, 
p=0.40). In order to explore if the positive effects of exercise were due to increasing 
hippocampal volume, rather than attenuating volume loss in comparison to control 
conditions) post-hoc analyses were performed to pool the mean changes in left 
hippocampal volume reported in the exercise conditions. Raw change data was

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
available for 8 studies (total n=256) no significant increase in left hippocampal 
volume following the exercise interventions (g=0.049, 95% C.I.= -0.06 to 0.16, 
p=0.384), thus indicating the positive effects observed in the primary analysis are 
due to exercise attenuating age-related neurodegeneration (rather than exercise 
significantly increasing hippocampal volume).  
Figure 3 here 
3.5. The effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in healthy older adults 
Data was pooled from six studies to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on 
hippocampal volume in healthy older adults (n=390). Aerobic exercise did not 
significantly increase total hippocampal volume compared to control conditions (g= 
0.146, 95% CI: -0.011 to 0.303, p=0.07). Five studies (total n=332) reported effects of 
exercise on left/right hippocampus separately. There was a statistically significant 
positive effect of exercise in left hippocampal volume in healthy older adults 
(g=0.355, 95% CI= 0.14 to 0.57, p=0.001), with no indication of heterogeneity or 
publication bias influencing these results. There was also a significant effect of 
exercise on right hippocampal volume in healthy older adults (g=0.237, 95% CI=-0.02 
to 0.45, p=0.032), again with no indication of heterogeneity or publication bias. Post-
hoc analyses examining raw volumetric changes in exercise conditions alone found 
that exercise in older adults did not significantly increase volume in the left (N=4, 
n=168, g=0.04, p=0.70) or right hippocampus (g=0.034, p=0.71), again indicating that 
positive effects observed from exercise are due to slowing down or preventing the 
volume loss occurring over time among the older adults in control conditions.

3.6. The effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in patients with 
psychotic disorders  
Four studies examined the effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in 
people with schizophrenia or first episode psychosis (n=107). Aerobic exercise did 
not significantly increase total hippocampal volume compared to control conditions 
(g= 0.149, 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.60, p=0.53, Table 2). Among the two studies which 
reported effects on left/right hippocampus separately, there was no evidence of 
effects in either region (both p>0.1). There was also no evidence of heterogeneity or 
publication bias influencing these results.  
3.7. The effect of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volume in other populations 
Data in other populations was insufficient for pooled meta-analyses, and so results 
from individual trials are summarised below. Individual trials which examined effects 
of aerobic exercise in patients with depression (Krogh et al., 2014), mild cognitive 
impairment (Brinke et al., 2014) and probable Alzheimer’s disease (Morris et al., 
2017) all found no significant effects on total or left/right hippocampal volumes. One 
study examining the effects of exercise in young-to-middle-aged adults found no 
change in total hippocampal volume but did find a significant increase in anterior 
hippocampal volume following 6 weeks of aerobic exercise (Thomas et al., 2016).  
3.8. Effects of exercise in relation to participant age 
Meta-regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between 
mean sample age and effects of exercise on hippocampal volume. No statistically

significant associations of effects of exercise with sample age were found for total, 
right or left hippocampal volume (all p>0.05).  
4. Discussion  
This meta-analysis examined the effects of exercise on hippocampal volumes in 
clinical and non-clinical populations. Fourteen controlled trials comparing aerobic 
exercise with various control conditions were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 
737 participants.  Random effects meta-analyses found that aerobic exercise had no 
effect on total hippocampal volumes (Figure 2), with no statistical heterogeneity 
between studies. This finding is consistent with that of a previous review which also 
found no effect of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal volume (Li et al., 2016), 
although in an analysis that included fewer studies of a smaller number of 
participants (Five studies, 184 participants).  
The current meta-analysis revealed a significant effect of aerobic exercise on left 
hippocampal volumes (g=0.265, 95% CI= 0.1 to 0.44, p=0.003). Interestingly, Li et al., 
(2016) reported significant effects of exercise in the right hippocampus, but no 
statistically significant changes in the left hippocampus. The current analyses 
included more than twice as many controlled trials, comprising a total of nine studies 
(including five newer studies which were not available for inclusion in the earlier 
review).  Moreover, the earlier meta-analysis examined post-intervention 
differences in hippocampal volume and therefore could not account for baseline 
volumes of the hippocampus or the mean change from pre to post test.  Given that 
some of the controlled trials were not randomized and included relatively small 
numbers of participants, relying solely on posttest changes does not take into 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
account group differences at baseline, which may have impacted the findings. 
Furthermore, there was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias influencing 
our results. Nonetheless, the findings should be interpreted with some caution due 
to the fact that all but two studies had potentially moderate/high risk of bias.  
The same observation of exercise having significantly positive effects on left 
hippocampal volume was also observed for the subgroup of studies conducted in 
healthy older adults (g=0.36, p=0.001). The demonstrated potential for exercise to 
positively affect hippocampal volume in healthy older adults has important 
implications, since neuronal mass decreases with increasing age in this area in 
almost all people during healthy ageing (Raz et al., 2005), and is associated with 
cognitive decline (Mosconi et al., 2008). In the ageing population, the potential 
benefits of any intervention which attenuates cognitive decline would have a 
substantial positive impact on public health. Indeed, our post-hoc analyses indicated 
that the positive effects of exercise on hippocampal volume were observed as a 
result of exercise promoting retention of hippocampal volume (while volume loss 
occurred in control conditions), rather than actually increasing neuronal mass per-
say. However, given the limited number of studies in this analysis, caution is required 
when interpreting this result.  
No significant effects from exercise were observed in people with schizophrenia, 
although only two studies could be included in the subgroup analysis examining left 
hippocampal volume change from exercise in this population (total n=69). Similarly, 
we did not find any significant effects from exercise on left, right or total 
hippocampal volume in people with depression (Krogh et al., 2014), mild cognitive

impairment (Brinke et al., 2014) or probable Alzheimer’s disease (Morris et al., 
2017). However, meta-analyses were not possible for these samples, given there was 
only data from single studies for each patient group. Considering also that all of 
these studies had small sample sizes, it is equally likely that the non-significant 
effects observed in these clinical populations are due to underpowered studies. 
Thus, the possible benefits of exercise for hippocampal volume in schizophrenia, 
depression or cognitive impairment cannot yet be ruled out on the basis of our null 
findings.  
The neurochemical mechanisms through which exercise promotes retention of 
hippocampal volume in aging humans has not been fully established. However, a 
comprehensive narrative review examining the neurological effects of exercise 
across the lifespan (Voss et al., 2011) found evidence from animal models supporting 
the theory that aerobic exercise acts by preventing the usual decrease in 
neurogenesis associated with aging, thus resulting in greater retention of neural 
matter – particularly in the hippocampus. Whereas angiogenesis (i.e. increase in 
brain vasculature) may also be induced by aerobic exercise, this is not observed in 
animal models using older rodents, and increases in cognitive performance occur 
independently of vascular changes (Van Praag et al., 2005). Voss et al., (2011), 
concluded that the primary candidate for stimulating neurogenesis in relation to 
exercise is BDNF.  The findings of the current review are consistent with this 
suggestion, as BDNF is found in high concentrations within the hippocampus (Murer 
et al., 2001) and recent meta-analytic evidence has demonstrated this is upregulated 
by regular exercise in humans (Szuhany et al., 2015).

Another factor that may contribute to the more consistent effects of exercise on 
hippocampal volumes observed among older adults is the likelihood that there may 
have been greater consistency of non-intervention specific physical activity among 
older adults. As one of the most plastic regions of brain, the hippocampus is more 
likely to reflect the impact of a wide range of non-specific behavioral effects that are 
more difficult to constrain in human subjects than in laboratory animals. This would 
in turn reduce the capacity to determine exercise-specific hippocampal volume 
changes in human subjects. 
The effects of exercise on hippocampal volume in humans have also been linked 
with improvements cardiorespiratory fitness. Cross-sectional studies have previously 
reported a link between fitness and brain volumes (Erickson et al., 2014), and several 
of the RCTs also observed a positive association of volumetric changes in the 
hippocampus with exercise-induced fitness improvement (Erickson et al., 2011b; 
Kleemeyer et al., 2016; Pajonk et al., 2010b). Again, the mechanistic link between 
these two variables is unclear. Nonetheless, these findings hold important 
implications from an implementation perspective, as while it may be difficult to 
develop exercise programs specifically for improving brain volume, focusing on 
fitness improvement appears to be one method for designing exercise interventions 
to confer neurobiological benefits. Indeed, previous research has shown that 
increases in cardiorespiratory fitness are also positively associated with the 
improvements in cognitive performance which occur from exercise, in both clinical 
and non-clinical populations (Firth et al., 2016; Hötting and Röder, 2013). 
Considering this alongside the broader benefits for metabolic risk (Kodama et al.,

2009), physical capacities (Lord et al., 2003), and mental health (such as reducing 
depression) (Schuch et al., 2016; Sui et al., 2009), prescribing aerobic exercise with 
an emphasis on cardiorespiratory fitness enhancement appears to be a suitable 
intervention for promoting healthy aging, in order to maintain both physical and 
neurological functioning into old age.  
There are limitations to this review, which are largely reflected by limitations in the 
primary studies.  One limitation of this review that we examined changes only in 
hippocampal volume, without analyzing other brain regions. Although the 
hippocampus has long been recognized as a particularly sensitive region for 
detecting exercise-induced alterations in both animal and human studies (Hillman et 
al., 2008; Molteni et al., 2002), other areas are also important to examine for future 
research (see Table 1). For instance, Malchow et al. (2015) showed that aerobic 
exercise significantly increased brain volume in various areas of the temporal gyri in 
people with schizophrenia, independently of hippocampal volume change.  
Additionally, there is growing evidence that exercise may alter structure and 
connectivity in white matter regions (Riggs et al., 2017; Voss et al., 2013) and the 
basal ganglia - changes which are further related to the cognitive and functional 
improvements which occur from aerobic exercise (Niemann et al., 2014a).  
Additionally, although we found an overall effect of aerobic exercise on left 
hippocampal volume, the intensity, frequency and length of exercise programs 
differed considerably across the studies, and was not reported in sufficient detail to 
perform comparative subgroup meta-analyses; thus making it difficult to determine 
which intervention factors are most important for influencing hippocampal volume.

Perhaps most importantly, the exercise interventions were all relatively short 
(mostly <12 months) and longer, adequately powered RCTs are required to consider 
if exercise can influence hippocampal volume over the longer term.  Future research 
which compares different exercise modalities, along with varying the frequency and 
intensity of aerobic training, could provide new insights into optimal program design.  
However, it is important that a ‘fair’ comparator is given when comparing exercise to 
a control condition, since active controls in other studies have demonstrated 
considerable improvements in primary outcomes (Stubbs et al., 2016).   
Furthermore, the neurobiological benefits of non-traditional approaches towards 
aerobic fitness improvement should also be established. For instance, ‘high intensity 
interval training’ (HITT) has recently been shown to produce similar cardiovascular 
benefits to long-duration endurance training in short periods of times (Wisløff et al., 
2009), although the effects on brain health have yet to be established.  
One further consideration is that evidence is currently lacking with regards to a 
direct link between exercise-induced increases in brain volume and actual cognitive 
benefits in terms of task performance. Assuming that greater brain volume is directly 
associated with better neural functioning and thus cognitive task performance is 
reductive, and does not follow from the available evidence (Eyler et al., 2011). 
Indeed, one of the studies in this review even found a negative relationship; with 
exercise-induced increases in the left hippocampus significantly associated with 
worse cognitive performance after a 6-month intervention (Ten Brinke et al., 2015). 
Thus, although exercise significantly increased some areas of hippocampal volume 
and cognition in humans, it cannot be concluded that structural increases are

causative or necessary for performance increases (Hillman et al., 2008).  This is also 
true for white matter regional increases, as although cardiorespiratory fitness is 
linked to both improved white matter integrity and cognitive performance, there is 
no independent link between these variables (Voss et al., 2013). 
In conclusion, this meta-analysis found no effects of exercise on total hippocampal 
volume, but did find that exercise interventions retained left hippocampal volume 
significantly more than control conditions. As these positive effects were also 
observed among the subgroup of studies of healthy older adults, the findings hold 
promising implications for using exercise to attenuate age-related neurological 
decline. Currently, the overall quality of the evidence is compromised by the fact 
that 10 of the 12 studies included some risk of bias, therefore more high-quality 
RCTs are now required. In additional to RCTs, a prospective meta-analysis examining 
how changes in physical activity and fitness predict hippocampal 
retention/deterioration across the lifespan would provide novel insights into longer-
term neural effects of exercise, while also reducing the impact of methodological 
heterogeneity often found across exercise RCTs. Further research is also required to 
determine effects in younger people (Riggs et al., 2017), and establish the 
neurobiological mechanisms through which exercise exerts these effects, in order to 
design optimal exercise programs for producing neurocognitive enhancements. 
However, the functional relevance of structural improvements has also yet to be 
ascertained. Nonetheless, the link between cardiorespiratory fitness with both 
structural and performance increases indicates this as a suitable target for aerobic 
training programs to improve brain health.
