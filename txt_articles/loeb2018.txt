Background: Homeopathic vaccines are licensed in many countries but scientific data to support their use
are sparse. The goal of this study was to compare the antibody response of homeopathic and conventional
vaccines and placebo in young adults. We hypothesized that there would be no significant difference
between homeopathic vaccines and placebo, while there would be a significant increase in antibodies
in those received conventional vaccines.
Methods: A randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial was conducted where 150 university students
who had received childhood vaccinations were assigned to diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, mumps,
measles homeopathic vaccine, placebo, or conventional diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (Tdap) and mumps,
measles, rubella (MMR) vaccines. The primary outcome was a � two-fold increase in antibodies from
baseline following vaccination as measured by ELISA. Participants, investigators, study coordinator, data
blood drawers, laboratory technician, and data analyst were blinded.
Results: None of the participants in either the homeopathic vaccine or the placebo group showed a � -
two-fold response to any of the antigens. In contrast, of those vaccinated with Tdap, 68% (33/48) had a � -
two-fold response to diphtheria, 83% (40/48) to pertussis toxoid, 88% (42/48) to tetanus, and 35% (17/48)
of those vaccinated with MMR had a response to measles or mumps antigens (p < 0.001 for each compar-
ison of conventional vaccine to homeopathic vaccine or to placebo). There was a significant increase in
geometric mean titres of antibody from baseline for conventional vaccine antigens (p < 0.001 for each),
but none for the response to homeopathic antigens or placebo.
Conclusions: Homeopathic vaccines do not evoke antibody responses and produce a response that is sim-
ilar to placebo. In contrast, conventional vaccines provide a robust antibody response in the majority of
those vaccinated.

1. Introduction
Use of homeopathic products in many countries is common. In
the U.S, survey data suggest that about 5 million U.S. adults and 1
million children use a homeopathic product annually [1,2].
Homeopathic vaccines are licensed in many countries, including
Canada [3]. The principle underlying these products is the ‘‘Princi-
ple of Similars”, which specifies that illness can be cured by a pro-
duct known to produce the same symptoms [4]. Although it has
been argued that these vaccines, also referred to as ‘‘nosodes”,
may be so dilute so as to contain little or none of the original sub-
stance, these vaccines are administered on the basis that they are
sufficient to provide immunity [5]. Recently, the concept that dilu-
tion of homeopathic vaccines may function through extreme sensi-
tivity of cellular signaling has even been proposed [6].

 Anti-vaccine groups are raising concern about the efficacy and
safety of childhood and adult vaccinations [7–10]. Information on
websites, blogs, and found in pharmacies as well as health food
and homeopathy stores questions the need for conventional vacci-
nation. The effects of such messaging, as attested to by outbreaks
of measles in Quebec and California in non-vaccinated populations,
could lead to a reduced uptake of vaccination [11–16]. This not
only increases risk to unvaccinated children and adults, but at
the population level can interfere with high levels of vaccination,
such as for measles, needed to achieve community protection
[17]. Although the majority of parents vaccinate their children,
some parents are increasingly questioning the need for vaccination
[11–13]. Alternatives to conventional vaccination, such as homeo-
pathic vaccines, may seem like a reasonable choice to some,
although the extent to which they are currently being used is
uncertain [5]). Data to support the use of homeopathic nosodes
as vaccines are sparse. Research has included animal studies sug-
gesting better survival with tularemia and malaria homeopathic
vaccines [18–20], a cohort study reporting benefit from a lep-
tospirosis homeopathic vaccine [21], a systematic review of influ-
enza homeopathic vaccines showing no significant benefit, but
not ruling it out [22]. A recent study reported a benefit of homeo-
pathic products compared to placebo in reducing influenza and
acute respiratory infections [23]. However, the disease endpoints
were defined solely by symptoms. A systematic review of trials
of homeopathic products for the treatment of medical conditions
found that the quality of most trials was low [24]. While inclusion
of all evidence suggested that homeopathic products might be pro-
tective compared to placebo, this result was not supported by anal-
yses that included only those trials of sufficient quality to provide
reliable evidence.
We are unaware of published reports documenting the human
immune response to homeopathic vaccines. A lack of a protective
immune response in comparison to placebo, with comparison to
conventional vaccines, would cast doubt on the benefit of homeo-
pathic vaccines, including previously conducted trials [19–23]. This
could help inform the public when deciding about homeopathic
vaccines and could help inform regulatory bodies, including those
in Canada where homeopathic vaccines are licensed and provided
with a drug information number [3]. A robust immune response on
the other hand would lead to further evaluation. The goal of this
study was to compare the antibody response when vaccinating
young adults with homeopathic vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis,
tetanus, mumps, and measles to placebo and to conventional vac-
cines. We hypothesized that there would be no significant differ-
ence between homeopathic vaccines and placebo, while there
would be a significant increase in antibodies in those who received
conventional vaccines.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
A randomized controlled trial where students between the ages
of 18 and 24 years who had received childhood vaccinations were
randomized, in a blinded manner, to either (1) diphtheria, pertus-
sis, tetanus, mumps, and measles nosodes, (2) placebo, (3) conven-
tional diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (Tdap), mumps, and measles
(MMR) vaccines.
2.2. Participants
We enrolled post-secondary students aged between 18 and
24 years at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, who received
primary childhood vaccinations and who were available for the
three-week follow up visit. Participants were excluded if they have
had a serious allergic reaction to a previous vaccination, or if they
had any allergies to one or more of the components of the vaccines
to be used. They were excluded if they had received a live vaccine
in the previous 4 weeks, immunosuppressive doses of steroids or
anti-cancer drugs in the previous 3 months, if they were pregnant
or could become pregnant during the next month following enroll-
ment, if they had a moderate to severe acute illness at the time of
the study, if they had cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other seri-
ous immune health condition, a history of encephalopathy within
7 days of receiving DTP/DTap (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) in
the past, a history of Guillaume Barre Syndrome, or if they had
received a blood transfusion, blood products, or immune globulin
within the past year. They were excluded if they had previously
received homeopathic vaccines or an adult booster dose of diph-
theria, pertussis, tetanus, mumps, measles (Tdap or MMR vaccine).
The study was approved by the research ethics board at Hamil-
ton Health Sciences., Hamilton, Canada. All participants gave writ-
ten informed consent. As part of the protocol, participants
randomized to homeopathic vaccines or placebo were eligible for
and offered booster vaccines after the trial was completed and
unblinded.
2.3. Study vaccines
2.3.1. Homeopathic vaccine group
Participants randomized to this group received oral doses of
diphtheria
(Diphtherinum),
pertussis
(Pertussinum),
tetanus
(Tetanotoxicum), measles (Morbilinum) and mumps (Ourlianum)
nosodes. The homeopathic vaccines were licensed by Health
Canada and had homeopathic drug identification numbers. These
consisted of doses on days 1, 2, and 3. Dilutions were 30 CH on
day 1, 200 CH on day 2, and 1000 CH on day 3. They also received
two sterile saline injections (0.5 ml each, one intramuscular and
one subcutaneous) to mimic conventional vaccines (Tdap and
MMR).
2.3.2. Control group
Participants randomized to this group received sugar pellet pills
on days 1, 2, and 3 as well as two sterile saline injections (0.5 ml
each, one intramuscular and one subcutaneous).
2.3.3. Conventional vaccine group
Participants randomized to the conventional vaccine group
received one intramuscular dose of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acel-
lular pertussis) (Adacel �) and one subcutaneous dose of MMR
(measles, mumps, rubella) (Priorix �). They also received sugar pel-
let pills on days 1, 2, and 3. In Ontario, all adults aged �18 years are
eligible for publicly funded dose of Tdap, irrespective of receiving a
prior dose in adolescence [25]. A second MMR dose is recom-
mended for students in post-secondary educational settings who
only received one dose.
2.4. Blinding and allocation
A statistician assigned participants at random to one of three
study groups, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Random permutations were gener-
ated using a random number generator in blocks of 3. The statisti-
cian kept a copy of allocation status and forwarded the codes to an
intermediary clinical trials research organization who arranged
ordering of the homeopathic and conventional vaccines. Allocation
concealment was central through a hospital pharmacy.
The identity of the study vaccines was known only by the trial
statistician, the intermediary clinical trials research organization,
and the vaccine study nurse. Participants, investigators, study
coordinator, laboratory technician, and data analyst were blinded

ventional vaccines in university students. Vaccine (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.08.082
 until the data analysis was completed and a draft manuscript writ-
ten. For participants receiving the oral homeopathic vaccines, ster-
ile saline injections were provided to mimic the two conventional
vaccines. Participants in the control group received sugar pellet
pills mimicking the homeopathic vaccines and two sterile saline
injections to mimic the conventional vaccines. Participants allo-
cated to conventional vaccine also received sugar pellet pills to
mimic the homeopathic vaccines. All injections were drawn up in
a different room than where they were administered to maintain
blinding.
2.5. Follow up and outcomes
The primary outcome was antibody levels for diphtheria, per-
tussis, tetanus, mumps, and measles measured using commercially
available ELISA kits. Participants had blood drawn, received the
vaccine the same day, and were followed three weeks for a follow
up blood draw. Although we had originally planned to assess T cell
immune response, we decided against this because of resource
limitations.
A response (i.e. anamnestic, since the participants were previ-
ously vaccinated) to a vaccine was defined as a � two-fold increase
in antibodies from baseline as measured by ELISA for diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, measles, and mumps [26,27]. If the pre-
vaccination concentration was below the standard control scale,
we conservatively assigned the lowest value on the standard curve
as the baseline value.
IgG antibody response was measured using EUROIMMUNE’s
anti-diphtheria
toxoid,
anti-bordetella
pertussis
toxin,
anti-
tetanus toxoid, anti-measles virus, and anti-mumps virus ELISA
assays according to the manufacturer’s package inserts. Sera were
diluted 1:100 using the assay-provided sample buffer; some sam-
ples were further diluted 1:4 or 1:8 to bring into range of the stan-
dard curve as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample antibody
values were calculated based on the standard curve of each indi-
vidual assay and results are reported in international units per
milliliter (diphtheria, bordetella pertussis, tetanus, and measles),
or relative units per milliliter (mumps).
2.6. Adverse reactions
We assessed for immediate hypersensitivity allergic reactions
by having the vaccination nurse monitor all study participants
for 15 min following immunization. Additionally, each participant
received a symptom list to be checked daily for five days following
vaccination. Reactogenic events at the injection site (soreness at
the site of injection, redness >2 cm, swelling >2 cm, and limitation
of movement) were recorded. Participants were asked about any
adverse events again during the follow up visit.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The primary outcome was a � two-fold increase in antibodies
from baseline at 3 weeks post-vaccination. We assumed conserva-
tively that up to 5% of those in the placebo group might show a � -
two-fold
increase
in
antibody
titres
compared
to
baseline.
Assuming a response of 40% in the homeopathic vaccine and con-
ventional groups and a 5% response rate in the placebo group for
any one of the five antigens being tested (diphtheria, pertussis,
tetanus, mumps, and measles) or combination of measles and
mumps antibody response (given anticipated lower rates of boos-
ter response for these antigens) and using a 5% non-inferiority
margin, 35 participants per group would have provided >90%
power
to
detect
superiority
and
>80%
power
to
claim
non-inferiority. We decided to combine measles and mumps as a
change to the protocol prior to antibody testing for the primary
outcome measure because high pre-existing antibody levels could
have led to a ceiling effect. Over the course of the study and prior to
testing antibodies, we also decided to increase our sample size to
50 participants per group given uncertainty about our predicted
estimates of response.
We used chi-square tests to assess proportions of participants
having a response to vaccine. For continuous measures to compare
the change in titers in log scale, we used paired t-tests. We derived
geometric mean titres (GMTs) from the log values. P values and
95% Confidence intervals (CIs) were two-sided. Differences with
P < .05 for 2-tailed tests were considered significant change in
response from baseline. Statistical analyses were conducted using
R statistical software.
3. Results
3.1. Participants
A total of 150 participants were enrolled in the study from
September 14, 2016 to October 2, 2017 (Fig. 1). There were 94
females and 56 males, their average age was 20.1 years (range from
18 to 24). Fifty were assigned to the homeopathic vaccine group
(30 females; mean age 19.9 years (SD 1.6), 51 to the placebo group
(32 females; mean age 20.3 years (SD 1.6), and 49 to the conven-
tional vaccine group (32 females, mean age 20.2 year (SD 2.0)
(Table 1). Fourteen (9.3%) participants reported a medical condi-
tion: asthma (5 from homeopathic group, 3 from placebo, and 2
from conventional), Gilbert Syndrome (1 in the homeopathic
group), scoliosis (1 in homeopathic group), and polycystic ovarian
syndrome (1 in placebo group).
Of the 150 participants that were randomized, one participant
in the conventional group and two in the placebo group did not
complete the study (one in each group did not follow up, one in
the placebo group notified us after randomization that they had
already received Tdap booster and therefore was ineligible), 98%
completed the study with both baseline and post-vaccination mea-
surements (Fig. 1). At baseline, 130/147 or 88% of participants had
protective levels (�0.1 IU/ml) of antibodies against diphtheria,
143/147 (97%) against tetanus (�0.1 IU/ml), 77/147 (52%) against
measles, and 97/147 (66%) against mumps (the seroprotective cut-
off for protection against pertussis is unknown).
3.2. Outcomes
The results of the antibody-fold response are shown in Table 1.
None of the participants in either the homeopathic vaccine or the
placebo group showed a � two-fold response to any of the anti-
gens; the absolute difference between the two groups for any of
the five vaccine antigen comparisons was 0% (�8.01% to 8.66%,
p = 1.00). In contrast, of those vaccinated with Tdap, 68% (33/48)
had a � two-fold response to diphtheria, 83% (40/48) to pertussis
toxoid, 88% (42/48) to tetanus, and 35% (17/48) of those vaccinated
with MMR had a response to measles or mumps antigens
(P < 0.001 for each antigen comparison to homeopathic vaccine
or placebo).
Geometric mean titres (GMT) are shown in Table 2. Post vacci-
nation GMT were not significantly different from baseline in both
the homeopathic and the placebo groups for diphtheria, pertussis,
tetanus, measles, and mumps, respectively. In contrast, in the con-
ventional vaccine group there were significant increases in GMTs
for all of the five antigens studied (P < 0.001 for each difference).
The changes in GMT with 95%CI are shown in Fig. 2.

 3.3. Adverse events
There were significantly more local side effects (redness, sore
arm, and limited arm movement) and muscle aches in the conven-
tional group compared to homeopathic vaccines and placebo
(Table 3).
4. Discussion
The major finding in this study was that none of the participants
in the homeopathic vaccine or placebo group had a � two-fold
antibody response above baseline. In contrast, the response to
conventional vaccines was as expected, with the majority of
317 students assessed for eligibility

 participants showing a � two-fold antibody response. Geometric
mean titres were not significantly different from baseline in both
the homeopathic and the placebo groups. In contrast, there were
significant increase in GMTs for each of the five antigens studied.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on
antibody response to homeopathic vaccines. Our results show that
these vaccines do not produce an antibody response to any of the
antigens that were tested—tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles,
and mumps. The use of homeopathic vaccines to provide a booster
effect, such as this trial demonstrates, is similar to placebo. The
lack of such an antibody response suggests that similar results
would be seen in a study priming children with homeopathic vac-
cines. Although homeopathic vaccines appear to be also used as
therapeutic agents for symptomatic illness rather than for prophy-
laxis by homeopathic practitioners [28], the lack of an antibody
response supports doubt about any benefit.
The booster response to the conventional vaccines in university
students in our study, ranging from 69% to 88% for tetanus, diph-
theria, and pertussis, was similar to previous Tdap and MMR vac-
cine booster studies in adults [29,30]. We had anticipated lower
booster responses for measles and mumps, particularly since many
of the participants would have previously received two doses of
MMR. Recent studies have demonstrated that a third dose of
MMR vaccine may not provide a large response but still may offer
protection [31,32]. Our findings also confirm that for tetanus and

 diphtheria, the vast majority of students who received childhood
vaccinations had protective levels at baseline (97% and 88% respec-
tively). However, given that about half of participants did not have
protective antibodies to measles and over one-third did not have
protective antibodies against mumps, this study highlights the
importance of a booster vaccine in this age group.
The findings of this study suggest that regulators in Canada and
other countries should stop providing drug identification numbers
for the homeopathic vaccines that we studied. Although we cannot
directly generalize our results to vaccines that we did not test,
we would anticipate a similar lack of response in other homeo-
pathic vaccines. We perceive that although our findings may not
influence those with strong beliefs in homeopathy, they may help
those who are undecided about vaccinating themselves or their
children with conventional vaccines and using homeopathic vacci-
nes instead.
The strength of this study is that it was a placebo-controlled
trial in an adequately powered population where the results are
clear. One limitation is that this was a single site study. Another
is that the study did not test clinical efficacy. However, with the
antigens that we were testing, it would have been virtually impos-
sible to conduct such a study and would not have been ethical to
do so.
In conclusion, homeopathic vaccines do not produce antibody
responses and therefore lead to a response that is similar to pla-
cebo. In contrast, conventional vaccines provide a robust antibody
response in the majority of those vaccinated.
Funding
This research did not receive any specific grant from funding
agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. Inter-
nal funding by McMaster University supported the study. Dr. Loeb
is funded by a CIHR Foundation Grant (grant 85 20006014). Vacci-
nes were purchased from the manufacturers of homeopathic vacci-
nes licensed for use in Canada and manufacturers of conventional
vaccines, and these manufacturers played no role in the design of
the study, in data analysis, or in the preparation of the manuscript.
Conflicts of interest
Dr. Loeb has received funding from CIHR, NIH, WHO, as well as
industry funding for influenza and pneumococcal vaccine research
(Sanofi Pasteur, Seqirus, Pfizer) as well as honorarium for advising
or speaking from these companies. Dr. Russell has received funding
from CIHR (influenza, pertussis vaccines), the Alberta ministry of
health (influenza, pertussis, shingles, chicken pox, HPV vaccine
work), CDC (influenza) and Merck frosst Canada (for chicken pox
vaccine). Dr. Russell has done previous clinical trial studies involv-
ing MMRV and pertussis vaccines.
