Abstract
Background: Health interventions fall along a spectrum from simple to more complex. There is wide interest in
methods for reviewing ‘complex interventions’, but few transparent approaches for assessing intervention
complexity in systematic reviews. Such assessments may assist review authors in, for example, systematically
describing interventions and developing logic models. This paper describes the development and application of
the intervention Complexity Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (iCAT_SR), a new tool to assess and categorise
levels of intervention complexity in systematic reviews.
Methods: We developed the iCAT_SR by adapting and extending an existing complexity assessment tool for
randomized trials. We undertook this adaptation using a consensus approach in which possible complexity
dimensions were circulated for feedback to a panel of methodologists with expertise in complex interventions and
systematic reviews. Based on these inputs, we developed a draft version of the tool. We then invited a second
round of feedback from the panel and a wider group of systematic reviewers. This informed further refinement of
the tool.
Results: The tool comprises ten dimensions: (1) the number of active components in the intervention; (2) the
number of behaviours of recipients to which the intervention is directed; (3) the range and number of
organizational levels targeted by the intervention; (4) the degree of tailoring intended or flexibility permitted across
sites or individuals in applying or implementing the intervention; (5) the level of skill required by those delivering
the intervention; (6) the level of skill required by those receiving the intervention; (7) the degree of interaction
between intervention components; (8) the degree to which the effects of the intervention are context dependent;
(9) the degree to which the effects of the interventions are changed by recipient or provider factors; (10) and the
nature of the causal pathway between intervention and outcome. Dimensions 1–6 are considered ‘core’
dimensions. Dimensions 7–10 are optional and may not be useful for all interventions.
Conclusions: The iCAT_SR tool facilitates more in-depth, systematic assessment of the complexity of interventions
in systematic reviews and can assist in undertaking reviews and interpreting review findings. Further testing of the
tool is now needed.

 Background
‘Complex interventions’ in health have been debated
widely for several years. Key points of discussion include
how to define such interventions, how to evaluate their
effects and how to synthesise these effects within
systematic reviews [1–5]. Some common features of
complex interventions in health identified some years
ago by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and
widely quoted [6] include: having a number of compo-
nents that may act both dependently and independently;
having “active ingredients” that are not easy to define;
being interventions that may be delivered at the individ-
ual,
organisational
or
population
level;
and
being
targeted towards patients directly or indirectly through
health professionals or health systems.
There are many other definitions of complex interven-
tions, often highlighting multiple, interacting compo-
nents and non-linear causal pathways, and emphasising
variability in content, context and mode of delivery, as
well as the unpredictability of their effects [2, 7, 8].
Other approaches have sought to differentiate complex,
complicated and simple interventions [9, 10]. For ex-
ample, it has been suggested that interventions with
many component parts that may require a high level of
skill in delivery but have little variation in application or
outcome are ‘complicated’ rather than ‘complex’
, and that
interventions with few components that can be delivered
in a formulaic manner with predictable outcomes are
‘simple’. Complex interventions or systems, in contrast,
have
features
of
non-linearity,
context
dependency,
adaptability and interdependence of intervention ele-
ments [11]. Further work has focused on ways to graph-
ically depict complex interventions, including how they
are delivered [12, 13]. While useful, these approaches are
not focused on understanding intervention complexity
in the context of systematic reviews. Furthermore, inter-
vention complexity has many dimensions, and interven-
tions may show more complexity on some of these
dimensions than on others. It is therefore difficult and
probably not useful to create a simple definition of what
we might view as a complex intervention. Instead, the
tool described in this paper outlines the key dimensions
of intervention complexity and describes how these
might be assessed. Using the tool, interventions can be
described as having degrees of complexity in relation to
these dimensions.
In other strands of methodological work, we have
proposed a new conceptual approach to categorising and
describing intervention complexity [14]. This approach
distinguishes between the description and analysis of: a)
intervention complexity (i.e. situations in which we ex-
pect the effects of an intervention to be modified by
variant properties or characteristics of the intervention
itself); b) complexity in implementation (i.e. situations in
which we expect the effects of an intervention to be
modified by variant characteristics of implementation
processes); c) complexity in context (i.e. situations in
which we expect the effects of an intervention to be
modified by variant properties or characteristics of the
settings
or
contexts
in
which
an
intervention
is
implemented); and d) complexity in relation to partici-
pants’ characteristics (i.e. situations in which we expect
the effects of an intervention to be modified by variant
characteristics of participants receiving an intervention).
This approach has informed the development of the tool
described in this paper.
Being able to describe and replicate interventions that
are seen as lying towards the more complex end of the
simple-complex continuum is important because of the
wide use of such interventions in health and social care
and because of the growing interest in understanding
both their effectiveness and how these effects come
about [15]. Systematic review methods are frequently
used to quantify these effects. However, to be useful to
those deciding whether and how to implement interven-
tions, such reviews also require precise descriptions of
the interventions [16] and an understanding of why an
intervention should be considered complex. Describing
and assessing these interventions is challenging though
because they may have many interacting components
and because they need to be described and assessed in
relation to how they are implemented, the context in
which they are implemented and those delivering and
receiving the intervention [15]. Clark [9] argues that
research into complex health interventions still focuses
on easily described components of interventions and
risks overlooking the key issue of which components are
most strongly associated with the effects of the interven-
tion. In other words, ways of describing complex
interventions need to help us ultimately in understand-
ing their mechanisms of action and effects – how and
why they work in a given context.
The MRC guidance for developing and evaluating
complex interventions, updated in 2008 [6, 17], has been
influential in taking forward this field but conducting
systematic reviews that fully address the complexity of
interventions remains challenging [3, 14, 18]. In particu-
lar, systematic reviews need to be able to describe com-
plexity
accurately
and
consistently
across
included
primary studies in order to facilitate the grouping of
studies for analysis, investigate causes of heterogeneity,
and explore the relationship between intervention com-
plexity and fidelity of implementation [19, 20]. The new
approach
to
categorising
intervention
complexity
described above [14] may help authors understand the
contextual considerations contributing to intervention
mechanisms and effects [3, 21]. In addition, an approach
has been developed for identifying key intervention

 content and implementation processes [22]. However,
currently there is no widely accepted and used tool or
typology
for
assessing
and
categorizing
levels
of
intervention complexity.
This paper describes the development of the interven-
tion
Complexity
Assessment
Tool
for
Systematic
Reviews (iCAT_SR). The tool aims to provide an overall
picture of the complexity of an intervention that can be
depicted visually, for example in a chart, or contribute to
developing or refining a logic model. In addition, the
tool
may
contribute
to
understanding
intervention
heterogeneity
and
informing
decisions
about
the
implementation of effective interventions.
Aim
To describe the development and application of the
iCAT_SR tool to assess and categorise levels of interven-
tion complexity in systematic reviews.
Methods
We developed the iCAT in two stages: in the first stage,
we developed an initial version of the tool to assess
intervention complexity in randomised trials [7]. The
steps we undertook in developing this tool are detailed
in Additional file 1. The output of this stage comprised a
guidance document describing six dimensions of com-
plexity (Additional file 2) and a template for rating each
dimension using a system with three levels. We consid-
ered and excluded a further ten dimensions, mainly
because they were already covered by an included
dimension, were thought too difficult to assess object-
ively or pre-trial, or did not to relate directly to the
complexity of an intervention (Additional file 3).
In the second stage, we adapted and further developed
the existing iCAT tool so that it could be used to
describe
and
assess
intervention
complexity
in
systematic reviews. We undertook the following steps:
� Consensus approach: We circulated the iCAT
dimensions identified as being relevant to describing
the complexity of interventions in single, primary
evaluation studies [7] (Additional file 2) for feedback
and comment to an expert panel of methodologists
working in the areas of complex interventions and
systematic reviews. Through a series of group and
individual telephone calls, we obtained feedback on
whether the iCAT tool could be adapted for
application in systematic reviews of complex
interventions; and how best to integrate the tool
into the review process. A total of 18 people
participated in the discussions and/or provided
feedback on the tool. We then collated and
circulated all comments for confirmation of
feedback and also invited additional comments.
� Drafting of first version of the iCAT_SR: Based on
the feedback received, we revised the iCAT for
single studies to include four additional dimensions
seen to be useful in the context of systematic
reviews. These were: (1) the degree of interaction
between intervention components; (2) the degree to
which the effects of the intervention are dependent
on the context or setting in which it is implemented;
(3) the degree to which the effects of the
intervention are changed by recipient or provider
factors; and (4) the nature of the causal pathway
between the intervention and the outcome it is
intended to effect.
� Second round of feedback on the draft iCAT_SR: We
circulated a draft version of the tool, incorporating
the agreed amendments, among the expert panel as
well as to a wider group of systematic reviewers
with an expressed interest in complex interventions.
We approached the latter through a ‘complex
intervention’ e-mail list. We then invited all those
who had contributed to join a meeting at the 2012
Cochrane Colloquium (which around 50 people
attended), where the development work was
presented and the tool demonstrated through
application to two empirical examples. Group
discussion following the presentation resulted in
additional feedback which informed further
refinement of the tool.
Results
Dimensions of the iCAT_SR version 1
The revised tool comprises six ‘core’ and four ‘optional’
dimensions for assessing intervention complexity. The
core dimensions, which include those in the original
iCAT tool, and the optional dimensions, seen to be use-
ful in the context of systematic reviews specifically, are
described briefly below and in more detail in Tables 1
and 2. A detailed description of the tool and guidance
on how to apply it can be found in Additional file 4.
Core dimensions:
1. Active components included in the intervention, in
relation to the comparison: An intervention
component is defined as a discrete, active element of
the intervention that could be implemented
independently of other elements. Components vary
in number and could be delivered independently of
each other or be grouped together in organised
bundles or looser packages of care.
2. Behaviour or actions of intervention recipients or
participants to which the intervention is directed:
Behaviours or actions include taking a medication,
changing a particular practice, improving knowledge
or undergoing a surgical procedure; they may also

Page 3 of 13
 include not undertaking a behaviour, such as not
smoking. Behaviours or actions are targeted by the
active components of the intervention.
3. Organisational levels and categories targeted by the
intervention: Level refers to whether the intervention
was directed at individuals (consumers,
professionals, policy makers); groups or teams of
individuals (staff of clinics, patient support groups,
surgical teams etc.); or systems (communities, health
systems, organisations (such as hospitals), policy

Intervention directed at two or more categories of
individuals within the individual level (e.g. primary care
professionals and primary care patients).
Single category
Intervention directed only at single category of
individuals within the individual level (e.g. professionals
or patients or policy makers).
4. The degree of tailoring intended or
flexibility permitted across sites or individuals
in applying or implementing the intervention
Highly tailored/flexible
High degree of variation in implementation from site to
site permitted and/or intervention designed to tailor to
individuals or specific implementation settings.
Moderately tailored/flexible
Some variation in implementation from site to site
permitted (i.e. some components of the intervention
are tailored/flexible while others are not).
Inflexible
Intervention implementation highly standardised with
minimal variation from site to site.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/
included in the review
5. The level of skill required by those delivering
the intervention in order to meet the
intervention objectives
High level skills
Extensive specialised skills required, i.e. new skills in
addition to expected existing skills AND/OR the
extension of existing skills to a highly specialised area
AND/OR skills requiring extensive additional training.
Intermediate level skills
Some specialised skills required, i.e. a small extension to
the expected existing skills of professionals, decision
makers or consumers.
Basic skills
No specialised skills required.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/included

 networks). Categories are groups, such as nurses or
patients, within those levels.
4. The degree of tailoring intended or flexibility
permitted across sites or individuals in applying or
implementing the intervention: Tailoring implies that
the intervention is intended to be modified for
specific individuals, settings or circumstances,
whereas flexibility implies leeway for modification if
desired. Interventions may be modifiable in both
content (e.g. variation in the components received
by sites or individuals) and form (variation in the
ways in which the components are delivered across
sites or individuals).
5. The level of skill required by those delivering the
intervention in order to meet the intervention
objectives: Skill is defined as the ability to do
something, such as deliver a health promotion
message appropriately or provide supportive

7. The degree of interaction between
intervention components, including the
independence/interdependence of
intervention components
High level interaction
There is substantial interaction or inter-dependency between
intervention components or actions i.e. the delivery of one
intervention component impacts on the delivery of another,
resulting in a synergistic effect.
Moderate interaction
There is some degree of interaction but no evidence of
synergistic effects or dysynergistic effects.
Independent
The intervention has only one component or action, or the
components act independently.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/included in
the review.
Unclear or unable to assess
8. The degree to which the effects of
the intervention are dependent on
the context or setting in which it is
implemented
Highly context dependent
The effects of the intervention are likely to be strongly
dependent on the implementation setting.
Moderately context dependent
The effects of the intervention are likely to be transferrable
across a limited range of settings only (e.g. only within a
specific country or health system).
Independent of context
The effects of the intervention do not appear to be strongly
dependent on the implementation setting, i.e. it is anticipated
that the effects of the intervention will be similar across a wide
range of contexts or settings.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/included in
the review.
Unclear or unable to assess
9. The degree to which the effects of
the intervention are changed by recipient
or provider factors
Highly dependent on individual-level
factors
The effects of the intervention are modified by both recipient and
provider factors.
Moderately dependent on
individual-level factors
The effects of the intervention are modified by one of recipient or
provider factors.
Largely independent of individual-
level factors
The effects of the intervention are not modified substantially
by recipient or provider factors.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/included
in the review.
Unclear or unable to assess
10. The nature of the causal pathway
between the intervention and the
outcome it is intended to effect
Pathway variable, long
The causal pathway includes three or more steps between
intervention and outcome or occurs over a long time period;
is not linear, or is variable; and/or more than one causal
pathway has been proposed.
Pathway linear, long
The causal pathway is linear but there are three or more
steps between intervention and outcome.
Pathway linear, short
The causal pathway is clear, short (only one or two steps),
direct, linear.
Variesa
Varies across interventions to be considered for/included in
the review.
Unclear or unable to assess
aIf this category is selected, review authors should consider whether the interventions included in the review are as similar as originally thought and whether this
has implications for the review’s inclusion criteria

 supervision to health workers, arising from training,
practice or experience. Different levels of skills may
be required to deliver different interventions.
6. The level of skill required for the targeted behaviour
when entering the included studies by those
receiving the intervention (consumers, professionals,
planners) in order to meet the intervention objectives:
Those receiving an intervention, such as an
educational programme, may need skills, based on
training, experience or practice, to interpret the
information provided and then to apply it in their
setting. For example, consumers may need a certain
level of internet and heath literacy to access and use
health information. Again, different levels of skills
may be required for different interventions.
Optional dimensions:
7. The degree of interaction between intervention
components, including the independence/
interdependence of intervention components: The
effectiveness of an intervention may depend on the
combination of components delivered and/or the
sequence of delivery. There may be synergistic
(“added value”) or dysynergistic effects from
delivering intervention components in a particular
combination, and one component delivered alone
could be effective, ineffective or even harmful
(Table 3).
8. The degree to which the effects of the intervention are
dependent on the context or setting in which it is
implemented: The effects of an intervention may be
dependent on the societal, political, economic,
health system or environmental context in which
the intervention is delivered. For example, an
intervention may not have the same effects in
primary care clinics and tertiary level hospitals, or in
a health system in which care is free at the point of
contact compared to one in which that is not the
case.
9. The degree to which the effects of the intervention
are changed by recipient or provider factors: The
effects of an intervention may be dependent on the
recipient’s readiness for behaviour change or the
proficiency of the person delivering the intervention.
10.The nature of the causal pathway between the
intervention and the outcome it is intended to effect:
This refers to pathways that involve human actions
(such as behaviours) or actions within organisations
or systems rather than biological pathways. The
causal pathway for an intervention may be clear,
direct, short and linear or it may be longer, more
variable, or there may be more than one causal
pathway [23–25].
Grading the complexity of interventions using iCAT_SR
For each iCAT_SR dimension an intervention can be
graded on one of three levels, ranging from more simple
to more complex (Tables 1 and 2). For some compo-
nents, it is also possible to select ‘varies’ where that
particular component varies across interventions to be
considered for the review or ‘unclear or unable to assess’
when the information needed to make an assessment is
not available. Review authors should provide support for
their judgements regarding these assessments so as to
improve transparency and help readers understand the
judgements made (Additional file 4). Information for the
support for judgement may be drawn from multiple
sources: published study reports; ancillary papers on the
studies, including qualitative process evaluations; and
information obtained from study authors. Where a re-
view of effectiveness has a linked qualitative evidence
synthesis that explores how the intervention works and
factors affecting its implementation, this additional in-
formation may be very helpful in making assessments
for the complexity dimensions. This is shown in the
example in Table 4 which draws on data from both a
Cochrane review of effectiveness [26] and a Cochrane
qualitative evidence synthesis [25].
At the development and protocol stages of a review,
review authors may not have sufficient information to
make definitive judgements regarding a dimension. In
these cases, we recommend that the review team make a
provisional judgement or develop a hypothesis and then
note these hypotheses in their support for judgement.
Information emerging at the analysis stage, such as the
Table 3 Interactions and interdependencies within complex
interventions (adapted from [40, 41])
Complex interventions can include components that interact
synergistically or dysynergistically, as follows:
• Synergistic: Intervention components interact in ways that the total
effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of the
components.
• Dysynergistic: Intervention components act in ways that the total
effect is less than the sum of the individual effects of the components.
Where intervention components do not interact in these ways, one
would expect the effect of the intervention to be the sum of the
individual effects of all of the components.
Complex interventions can also include components that are
interdependent. Where such interdependencies exist, they can be
described as:
• Contemporaneous: The effect of one intervention component depends
on another intervention component being present at the same time.
On their own, each component may be less effective, ineffective, or
harmful.
• Temporal: The effect of one intervention component depends on
another component being present beforehand. On their own, each
component may be less effective, ineffective, or harmful.
Where intervention components do not show interdependency, one
would expect these components to be effective regardless of the
presence or absence of other components.

1. Active components included in
the intervention, in relation to
the comparison
‘Any intervention delivered by LHWs [lay health
workers] and intended to improve maternal or
child health (MCH) or the
management of infectious diseases.’ ([26] p7)
One component
The active component is the delivery by a LHW of a
health intervention. Although the nature of the
intervention delivered and the extent to which LHWs
worked with other providers varied considerably across
trials included in the review, all interventions were
delivered by LHWs.
2. Behaviour or actions of intervention
recipients or participants to which
the intervention is directed
‘Any intervention delivered by LHWs and intended
to improve maternal or child health (MCH) or the
management of infectious diseases…[]…a MCH or
infectious diseases
intervention was defined as follows.
• Child health: any interventions aimed at improving
the health of children aged less than five years.
• Maternal health: any interventions aimed at improving
reproductive health, ensuring safe motherhood, or
directed at women in their role as carers for children
aged less than five years.
• Infectious diseases: any interventions aimed at
preventing, diagnosing, or treating communicable
diseases…’ ([26] p7-8)
Varied
Included interventions varied from having a single target
(e.g., initiation of breastfeeding) to having multiple
targets (e.g., community-based interventions directed at
hygiene practices, nutrition practices and child caring
behaviours among recipients, and intended to reduce
neonatal mortality).
3. Organisational levels and categories
targeted by the intervention
‘There were no restrictions on the types of patients
or recipients for whom data were extracted.’ ([26] p7)
Single category
The interventions delivered by LHWs were directed at
individual patients or community members, or groups of
patients or community members, within communities or
primary care.
4. The degree of tailoring intended or
flexibility permitted across sites or
individuals in applying or
implementing the intervention
‘Any intervention delivered by LHWs and intended
to improve maternal or child health (MCH) or the
management of infectious diseases.’ ([26] p7)
Varied from inflexible
to highly flexible
Because the review included any intervention delivered
by LHWs and intended to improve MCH or the
management of infectious diseases, the range of
included interventions was very wide. Some
interventions were implemented in a highly
standardised way (e.g., structured telephone support for
pregnant women from high risk groups [42]) while
others allowed variation from site to side or individual
tailoring (e.g., provision of health and parenting
education to inner city mothers [43]).
5. The level of skill required by those
delivering the intervention in order
to meet the intervention objectives
‘Any lay health worker (paid or voluntary) …[]…
For the purposes of this review, we defined the
term lay health worker as any health worker who:
• performed functions related to healthcare delivery,
• was trained in some way in the context of the
intervention, but
• had received no formal professional or paraprofessional
certificate or tertiary education degree.’ ([26] p7)
Mostly varied from
basic to intermediate
level skills
In the studies included in the review, all of the
participating LHWs would have received some level of
training. In some studies, LHWs received additional
training to extend their skills so that they could deliver a
specific task or tasks.
6. The level of skill required for the
targeted behaviour when entering the
‘There were no restrictions on the types of patients
or recipients for whom data were extracted.’ ([26] p7)
Basic skills
No specialised skills were required of the patients/
consumers participating in the trials.

7. The degree of interaction between
intervention components, including
the independence/interdependence of
intervention components
The degree of interaction between intervention components
was not specified in the review inclusion criteria, described
explicitly in the data extraction or analysed as part of the review.
The intervention was considered to have only one component for
the purpose of the review.
Unclear or unable to assess
Not described or analysed in the review. Likely to vary
across the included studies.
8. The degree to which the effects of
the intervention are dependent on the
context or setting in which it is
implemented
‘A substantial proportion of the included studies…were
conducted in LMICs [low and middle income countries] or were
directed at low income groups in high income countries. Based
on the premise that low income groups across different countries
share similar constraints in accessing health care, it may be
concluded that these interventions could potentially be
extrapolated to other settings, be effective in reaching low
income groups, and contribute to reducing health inequalities.
However, the degree to which the findings from studies in high
income settings can be generalised to low income settings
remains unclear and requires further empirical research.’ ([26] p49)
‘While we explored whether there were differences between
high, middle and low income countries in the barriers and
facilitators we identified, the differences we did find were perhaps
surprisingly few…[]… Some differences between settings did
emerge, however.’ ([25] p39)
Moderately to highly
context dependent
The effectiveness review did not address this question
but identified it as important to consider in future work.
The qualitative evidence synthesis noted that
descriptions of study context were limited. The broad
categories of high, middle and low income country did
not appear to be key in terms of context dependency,
but the synthesis identified a wide range of other ways
in which the effects of LHW programmes may be
dependent on implementation context or setting.
9. The degree to which the effects of the
intervention are changed by recipient or
provider factors
Not considered in detail in the reviews.
Moderately to highly
dependent on individual-level
factors
Many LHW interventions are intended to change the
behaviour or recipients (e.g. to increase breastfeeding or
promote adherence to a treatment). We would therefore
expect these interventions to be dependent on

between the intervention and the
outcome it is intended to effect
‘…the findings of the qualitative review were organised into
chains of events that we proposed could lead to the outcomes
measured in the review of effectiveness…’ ([25] p35).
Pathway variable,
long
More than one causal pathway was identified and each
pathway included three or more steps between
intervention and outcome.

 results of subgroup analyses, may allow judgements to be
made with greater confidence. The iCAT_SR assessment can
then be amended. This is discussed in more detail below.
Using the iCAT_SR in systematic reviews of effectiveness
Use of the iCAT_SR in the context of systematic reviews
of effectiveness is intended to facilitate a more system-
atic and thorough understanding of intervention com-
plexity, including in relation to both the content of an
intervention and its mode of delivery. Table 5 shows
how the tool may be useful at different stages in the
process of conducting a systematic review, including in
protocol development, analysis and in interpreting and
presenting the review findings. For instance, the tool
could be used to compare the complexity characteristics
of the included studies with those specified using
iCAT_SR at the protocol stage. This may help to identify
areas in which the intervention description needs to be
improved for the next review update. Examples of how
iCAT_SR can be applied within systematic reviews are
provided in Tables 4 and 5 and Additional file 5. The ex-
ample in Table 4 focuses on a health systems interven-
tion [25, 26] while that in Additional file 5 focuses on a
public health intervention directed to consumers and
communities [27, 28].
At the development and protocol stages of a review,
the iCAT_SR can prompt review authors to identify the
dimensions of complexity that are associated with a par-
ticular intervention. This may improve review authors’
understanding of how to conceptualise and define the
intervention they are considering. This, in turn, may im-
prove their description of the intervention in the review
protocol (which could follow the format used in Table 4
and Additional file 5) and the identification of eligible
studies. As noted above, review authors may select ‘var-
ies’ where a particular iCAT_SR component varies
across the group of interventions to be considered for a
review. This grading should prompt review authors to
consider whether it is appropriate for these interventions
to be grouped together in a single review and also,
where relevant, whether these interventions would be
better considered as separate intervention-comparison
combinations within a review. Where a review includes
more than one intervention-comparison combination, it
is may be appropriate to undertake separate iCAT_SR
assessments for each combination.
At the development stage of a review, applying the
iCAT_SR may also help identify possible explanatory
factors for differences in results across studies and
subgroups, and these can then be specified for a priori
subgroup analyses. For instance, the iCAT_SR example
in Table 4 notes, based on findings from a linked quali-
tative evidence synthesis, that the effects of some lay
health worker interventions may be modified by the
Table 5 Using the iCAT_SR in systematic reviews of the effectiveness of interventions
Stage in the review processa
Utility of the iCAT_SR
Formulating the PICO review question and
developing criteria for including studies
Prompts review authors to identify the key components of the intervention/s and how these interact;
the actions to which these components are directed; the organisational levels targeted; the anticipated
causal pathway/s or logic model etc. Overall, this may help review authors to conceptualise the
intervention and define the scope of the review.
Searching for studies
By prompting to review authors to identify the key components of intervention/s and the recipients and
organisational levels targeted, the tool may aid in identifying appropriate search terms. This may help in
identifying eligible studies where, for example, the interventions of interest are broadly similar in terms of
their component parts but have widely varying names in the literature.
Selecting studies for inclusion
Makes explicit the key components of the intervention/s and the recipients and organisational levels
targeted, and therefore helps to ensure that study inclusion decisions are easier and more consistent
across the review author team.
Extracting data
Facilitates the organisation and standardisation of data relating to intervention description and
intervention complexity. The dimensions of the tool can inform development of the data extraction form
for the review.
Analysing data and undertaking
meta-analyses
Enables classification or grouping of interventions for analysis based on their components and/or
participants and levels targeted. The tool may also inform analyses and interpretation by helping to
generate a priori hypotheses about explanatory factors that could potentially explain differences in results
both across studies and across subgroups within studies. These explanatory factors can then be used to
explore heterogeneity in subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.
Presenting results and developing ‘Summary
of findings’ tablesb
Enables classification or grouping of interventions based on their components and/or participants and
levels targeted, and thus facilitates clear and logical presentation of the review findings. The tool may
also identify important research gaps, for example where the causal pathway of an intervention is not
clear or where there are important questions regarding interactions between intervention components.
Interpreting results and drawing conclusions Aids refining a logic model or causal pathway for the intervention/s that was developed at the protocol
stage.

 degree of social support that lay health workers receive.
This might therefore be an important explanatory factor
to include in subgroup analyses in a systematic review of
the effects of lay health worker interventions.
We recognise that limited knowledge of how an inter-
vention works may reduce review authors’ ability to
complete the assessment for each complexity dimension
at the protocol stage, and that these assessments are a
reflexive process involving judgements. We recommend
that review authors complete the assessments as far as
possible, based on existing knowledge, including from
sources such as linked qualitative evidence syntheses, or
logical argument and then consider during the analysis
stage of the review whether any changes are needed. For
example, the findings of a systematic review of interven-
tion effectiveness or of a linked qualitative evidence syn-
thesis may suggest that an intervention-effects causal
pathway hypothesized at the protocol stage was incor-
rect or incomplete. Applying the iCAT_SR might also
influence decisions on when to incorporate qualitative
evidence to explain gaps in knowledge.
The iCAT_SR is designed to be applied in reviews of a
single intervention or of a group of very similar inter-
ventions. Some reviews, however, consider any interven-
tion aimed at achieving a particular outcome. For
example, any intervention that aims to improve adher-
ence to tuberculosis treatment (which might include
mobile phone messaging, nurse visits or written patient
information) or any intervention that aims to improve
trust between health care providers and health care
recipients (which might include training interventions
for health care providers and patient education). For
these types of review, it will be necessary to group
together similar interventions (e.g., all mobile phone
messaging
interventions
for
tuberculosis
treatment
adherence or all interventions that involve training for
health
care
providers)
and
to
carry
out
separate
iCAT_SR assessments for each of the included interven-
tion groups. It should also be noted that iCAT_SR is not
a tool to assess risk of bias or how well an evaluaton
study or systematic review has been conducted.
Discussion
The iCAT_SR version 1 can guide the conduct of sys-
tematic reviews of effectiveness by providing review au-
thors with a technique to ‘disaggregate systematically’
[18] and describe key aspects of an intervention. It will
allow review authors and others to characterize complex
interventions in a uniform framework – a possibility that
has been largely lacking to date. The iCAT_SR will also
improve understanding of the relationship
between
intervention components and make more explicit con-
siderations of context and of implementation factors.
The tool may also be helpful in planning subgroup
analyses to explore effect modification by key differences
in intervention complexity – for example, participants
exposed to different combinations of intervention com-
ponents or to interventions targeting different organisa-
tional levels. iCAT_SR assessments may also be useful in
planning meta-regression to explore the relative import-
ance of different dimensions of intervention complexity
in explaining intervention effects, and in conceptualising
network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of
different intervention configurations [29]. All of this
may contribute to explaining more clearly which inter-
vention components work and how. Furthermore, by im-
proving
the
quality
of
intervention
description
in
systematic reviews, it may also facilitate judgements
about applicability of the findings in populations or sub-
groups [30].
The development of this tool needs to be situated in
the evolving science of systematic reviews that proposes
the synthesis of multiple sources of data to explain the
causal relationship between an intervention and its
effects [18, 31]. Other approaches to assessing the com-
plexity of interventions tend to be specific to a clinical
or health area [32, 33], and more work is needed to
explore how these approaches might be used together
with the iCAT_SR. In addition, for behaviour change
interventions we need to explore how the iCAT_SR can
be used in conjunction with behaviour change interven-
tion frameworks [34] and a taxonomy of behaviour
change techniques [35–37]. We also acknowledge that
this attempt to assess the degree of complexity of inter-
ventions somewhat artificially both splits complexity into
a range of dimensions and divides complexity on each
dimension into three levels. In practice, all interventions
sit on a spectrum from less to more complex for each of
the dimensions specified making it difficult to meaning-
fully talk about a ‘complex intervention’ or an overall
degree, or level of, intervention complexity. Nonetheless
we see the iCAT_SR as a constructive step in developing
a better understanding of the phenomenon of interven-
tion complexity.
The next stage of development will be to further test
the iCAT_SR, and the guidance on how to apply it, in
selected systematic reviews and also to assess reliability
between raters and identify sources of disagreement. We
have received offers from a number of review author
teams who would like to trial the current version as part
of a review of a health intervention, and hope that these
pilots will explore both the usability or feasibility of the
tool and its usefulness in exploring the nature of the
causal pathways for an intervention and assessing the
applicability of review findings. The usefulness and us-
ability of the tool for users of systematic reviews also
needs to be explored. An iCAT_SR assessment may as-
sist users of reviews in a number of ways: by facilitating
Lewin et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 
Page 10 of 13
 clearer description of the intervention that is the focus of
the review; by making more explicit aspects of the inter-
vention that may be important for replication in other set-
tings, including the (hypothesized) active components, the
behaviours or actions to which the intervention is directed
and the level of skill required by those delivering the inter-
vention (dimensions 1, 2 and 5); and by highlighting gaps
in knowledge about an intervention, for example regard-
ing the nature of the causal pathway between the
intervention and the outcome it is intended to effect
(dimension 10) [30]. To aid use of the iCAT_SR, results of
assessments could be depicted visually, for example in a
chart or pictograph [38], and creating visual presentations
will be an important part of future development of the
tool. Further work is also needed to evaluate the useful-
ness to review users of iCAT_SR assessments and
different methods of presenting these.
The development of the iCAT_SR has been under-
taken by experienced review authors; we also therefore
need to assess whether it can be operationalised success-
fully in the hands of relatively inexperienced review
authors as well as the additional workload involved. It is
likely that review authors will require some training to
use the tool as intended, and there will be a learning
curve before the value of the tool becomes apparent. Be-
cause judgements are involved in applying iCAT_SR, we
recommend that review authors meet at the outset and
discuss with some examples how they plan to make their
judgements. This should promote agreement within a
review team, and make clearer what their judgements
mean in the context of a particular review. In addition,
we are not advocating that the tool should be used in all
reviews of interventions that are viewed as more com-
plex. Rather, the iCAT_SR should be considered in
reviews where understanding the complexity of the
intervention, and understanding the impacts of this
complexity on intervention effects, are important parts
of the review question.
The iCAT_SR is not without limitations, the most im-
portant of which is likely to be the limited description of
intervention components, implementation context and
implementation fidelity in primary studies included in a
review. Poor reporting is a well acknowledged problem
[15, 39] and developing ‘complexity’ extensions to the
CONSORT and PRISMA criteria [14] and reporting
templates [15] may help to address this through driving
up
reporting
standards.
An
additional
use
of
the
iCAT_SR will be in identifying gaps in reporting and in
providing a clear picture of issues to probe when
contacting the authors of primary studies.
Conclusions
The development of the iCAT_SR tool facilitates more
in-depth, systematic assessment of the complexity of
interventions in systematic reviews of intervention ef-
fects and may also contribute to understanding how a
complex intervention works. In addition, the tool may
have a number of ‘spin off’ effects including improving
understanding of the range of different versions of an
intervention in the literature; improving intervention
description in primary studies; and making it easier for
users of reviews to assess the applicability of the inter-
vention to their setting. The iCAT_SR also moves the
field away from ‘simplistic’ definitions of what we might
view as a complex intervention and suggests that inter-
ventions are better described as having degrees of
complexity in relation to the iCAT_SR dimensions.
We have added to the title of the tool the suffix
‘version 1’ as we anticipate that reviewers who use the
tool will comment and suggest additional modifications.
We encourage publication of worked examples of the
application of iCAT_SR to different types of interven-
tions (for instance, interventions targeting different
governance or financial arrangements for health and
social care) from different areas of health and social care
(for example, clinical medicine, health systems and pub-
lic health). We also welcome feedback on the tool and
the accompanying guidance (Additional file 4) and plan
to review and update these at regular intervals, based on
user experience.
