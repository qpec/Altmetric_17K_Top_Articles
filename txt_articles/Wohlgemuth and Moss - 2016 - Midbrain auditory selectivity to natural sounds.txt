This study investigated auditory stimulus selectivity in the midbrain
superior colliculus (SC) of the echolocating bat, an animal that relies
on hearing to guide its orienting behaviors. Multichannel, single-
unit recordings were taken across laminae of the midbrain SC of the
awake, passively listening big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus. Species-
specific frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation sound sequences with
dynamic spectrotemporal features served as acoustic stimuli along
with artificial sound sequences matched in bandwidth, amplitude,
and duration but differing in spectrotemporal structure. Neurons in
dorsal sensory regions of the bat SC responded selectively to elements
within the FM sound sequences, whereas neurons in ventral sensori-
motor regions showed broad response profiles to natural and artificial
stimuli. Moreover, a generalized linear model (GLM) constructed on
responses in the dorsal SC to artificial linear FM stimuli failed to predict
responses to natural sounds and vice versa, but the GLM produced
accurate response predictions in ventral SC neurons. This result sug-
gests that auditory selectivity in the dorsal extent of the bat SC arises
through nonlinear mechanisms, which extract species-specific sen-
sory information. Importantly, auditory selectivity appeared only
in responses to stimuli containing the natural statistics of acoustic
signals used by the bat for spatial orientation—sonar vocalizations—
offering support for the hypothesis that sensory selectivity enables
rapid species-specific orienting behaviors. The results of this study are
the first, to our knowledge, to show auditory spectrotemporal selec-
tivity to natural stimuli in SC neurons and serve to inform a more
general understanding of mechanisms guiding sensory selectivity
for natural, goal-directed orienting behaviors.

G
oal-directed orientation depends on selective sensory pro-
cessing to guide appropriate movements, such as saccades,
head turns, or reaching to grasp a target (1). Previous work
suggests that the midbrain superior colliculus [SC; SC of mam-
mals or optic tectum (OT) of other vertebrates] plays a central
role in integrating multimodal sensory information for planning
and executing goal-directed orienting behaviors (2). Although
there is strong evidence that the SC encodes stimulus location to
guide orienting movements (3), other work suggests that the SC
also mediates target selection and attention: SC recordings reveal
shared neural control over attended locations in space and pre-
motor commands to shift gaze to these locations (4–6). Moreover,
neurons in the OT of the barn owl respond categorically to mul-
timodal sensory stimuli as “salient” and “other” (7, 8), a categori-
zation that assists in target selection. These findings implicate the
SC in both stimulus selection and orientation. Our understanding
of the role of the SC in the selection of natural stimuli is, however,
incomplete, and to bridge this gap, we investigated auditory selec-
tivity in the SC of the echolocating bat, an animal that shows robust
stimulus selection to guide its adaptive orienting behaviors (9).
Auditory selection and attention to sonar targets have been
inferred at the behavioral level in echolocating bats from their
adaptive control of the signals used to probe the environment
(9). However, neural mechanisms of auditory stimulus selection
in bats have not been investigated. Earlier neurophysiological
studies of auditory processing in the bat SC used simplified
acoustic stimuli that only approximated natural echolocation
signals (10, 11). Although past research revealed important
properties of bat SC neurons, recent studies in other animals
suggest that responses to simplified acoustic stimuli may not re-
liably predict responses to natural sounds (12, 13). Additionally, in
the bat auditory cortex, the temporal dynamics of sounds have
been shown to affect auditory response profiles (14, 15), further
substantiating the importance of biologically inspired stimuli to
assess and understand brain activity in light of its evolved function.
It is for this reason that the bat serves as a valuable model for
understanding the dynamics of stimulus selection in the SC. The
sensory stimuli presented to the bat can recreate natural listening
experiences under very controlled experimentation. By manipu-
lating biologically relevant signals with fine control, basic princi-
ples of natural stimulus selection in the SC can be uncovered.
Here, we report on auditory responses of SC neurons in the
echolocating big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to natural and ar-
tificial acoustic stimuli, with the goal of understanding the pro-
cesses that contribute to auditory stimulus selection. Considering
the importance of auditory computation to the bat (16), we hy-
pothesize that the spectrotemporal properties of natural acoustic
stimuli evoke greater response selectivity than artificial sounds
matched in bandwidth, duration, and amplitude.
Results
Audio recordings of echolocation call sequences taken from big
brown bats tracking a moving target served as natural acoustic
stimuli for neurophysiological experiments (Fig. 1A). Auditory re-
sponses of SC neurons to natural call sequences were compared with
artificial sound sequences containing linear frequency-modulated
(FM) and white noise elements matched in amplitude, duration, and
bandwidth (Figs. 1 B and C). Data were collected from five bats,
resulting in 56 single-unit recordings and 127 multiunit recordings.
All analyses presented below were performed on the single-unit
responses to sounds broadcast through the loudspeaker direction
Significance
Nervous systems have evolved to enable processing of complex
stimuli that animals encounter in their natural environments, and
yet, neurophysiological research has largely investigated re-
sponses to simple artificial stimuli. In an attempt to bridge this
gap, we characterized response selectivity to natural stimuli in
the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of the echolocating bat, an
animal that probes the environment with sonar vocalizations.
Using the bat’s dynamic echolocation signals as auditory stimuli,
we discovered that SC neurons in the dorsal sensory layers
exhibited selectivity that was not predicted by responses to
artificial sounds. Our research reveals how response properties
of SC auditory neurons may lead to stimulus selection and
further shows the importance of biologically relevant stimuli to
understand brain function.

 evoking a maximum response (Fig. 1C). Auditory unit responses
to the brief stimulus elements were phasic (Fig. S1) and found
across all recording depths (from 300 to 1,050 μm), showing that
auditory activity can be elicited from neurons across the func-
tional subdivisions in the bat SC.
Shown in Fig. 2 A–C are example responses to each stimulus
category (natural, linear sweep, and white noise in Fig. 2 A–C,
respectively) for a single neuron. SC neurons generally had very
low levels of spontaneous activity and were typically active only
in response to acoustic stimulation. Auditory activity evoked by
each of three stimulus sets included a large onset response to the
first element followed by time-locked responses to individual
elements in the stimulus sequence. Response latencies varied
significantly across the stimulus categories. The shortest latency
responses were elicited by white noise stimuli followed by natural
stimuli, with the longest latencies to linear sweep stimuli (Fig. S2)
(Wilcoxon sign rank test; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons).
SC neurons also showed differences in auditory response se-
lectivity across stimulus categories. Response selectivity was
higher for spectrotemporally structured stimuli than for the
white noise stimuli. For example, the neuron shown in Fig. 2 D–F
responds to fewer individual sound elements in the natural and
linear sweep stimuli than the white noise stimulus, respectively.
Moreover, the patterns of responses (i.e., which sound elements
elicited a response) were also different between the three stim-
ulus categories. Across all recording sites, neural responses to
the natural stimulus showed the highest stimulus selectivity
(Fig. 2D, blue line) (mean selectivity index = 0.817) followed by
responses to the linear sweep stimulus (Fig. 2E, red line) (mean
selectivity index = 0.807) and responses to the white noise stim-
ulus (Fig. 2F, green line) (mean selectivity index = 0.713). For all
sites, the mean response selectivity of the natural stimulus was
significantly greater than response selectivity to the white noise
stimuli [Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test; P = 0.03], but no other
pairwise comparisons yielded significant differences. Interestingly,
we found that auditory selectivity differed across recording depths.
At more dorsal locations, auditory selectivity was found to be
higher in response to the natural stimuli than the linear sweep
or white noise stimuli (Fig. S3, dorsal) (permutation test; P <
0.001). In ventral SC, however, auditory response selectivity was
comparable across stimuli (Fig. S3, ventral) (permutation test;
P > 0.05). A more detailed analysis of the differences in selectivity
throughout the layers of the SC is presented below.
Changes in auditory selectivity for each stimulus set category
from dorsal to ventral SC are revealed by arranging neural re-
sponses in order of increasing recording depth. Normalized ac-
tivity heat plots for all auditory responses to a set of the natural
(Fig. 3A), linear sweep (Fig. 3B), and white noise stimuli (Fig. 3C)
show a gradual decrease in selectivity with recording depth. Data
from the same neuron are displayed along the same row in each
panel of the activity heat plots for the three stimulus sets; red
indicates a large evoked response, and blue indicates no re-
sponse (Fig. 3). Responses to the natural stimulus (Fig. 3A) show
a pronounced decrease in response selectivity as a function of
increasing recording depth: fewer individual sonar pulses of the
natural stimulus evoke responses in dorsal layers compared with
neurons in ventral layers. SC responses to the linear sweep
stimulus also exhibit a decrease in auditory response selectivity
with increasing recording depths (Fig. 3B), but responses to the
white noise stimulus set show little selectivity, with robust re-
sponses at both dorsal and ventral recording sites (Fig. 3C).

 The black and gray arrows in Fig. 3 mark data recorded at dorsal
and ventral locations, respectively, which are shown in greater
detail in Fig. S4.
A quantification of the effect of recording depth on auditory
response selectivity is presented in Fig. 4. Response selectivity
was defined as the inverse proportion of the sound elements in a
stimulus evoking a response greater than the half-maximum re-
sponse. Using this metric, there is a significant correlation between
recording depth and response selectivity to the natural stimuli
(Fig. 4A) (r = −0.49; r2 = 0.24; P < 0.0001). A similar trend is
found for the responses to the linear sweep stimuli (Fig. 4B) (r =
−0.36; r2 = 0.13; P = 0.006), but selectivity in the responses to the
white noise stimulus did not change with the depth of recording
(Fig. 4C) (r = 0.13; P = 0.35). The white noise stimulus was an
effective stimulus for evoking auditory responses throughout the
bat SC, and as a result, responses to a larger number of sound
elements in each white noise stimulus set were found across all
layers, with little change in selectivity at different recording depths.
Given that auditory response similarity across stimulus cate-
gories varies with recording depth, we investigated whether neural
selectivity to the underlying spectral features of the stimuli was
driving the differences in responses. For this analysis, we deter-
mined the extent to which an SC neuron’s response profile to the
spectral features of the linear sweep stimulus set could be used to
predict its response to the natural, multiharmonic, hyperbolic FM
stimulus set. The white noise stimulus set was excluded from this
analysis because of its lack of a well-defined spectrotemporal
structure. Predictions for responses to the natural stimulus set
were calculated using a generalized linear model (GLM) based on
responses to the linear sweep stimulus set. The predictors for the
GLM were five individual spectrotemporal features of each sound
element as outlined in Methods (sonar pulse amplitude, duration,
amplitude slope, spectral peak, and end frequency of the sweep),
and the observed responses were the average auditory responses
elicited by the linear sweep stimulus at each site. Shown in Fig. 5 A
and B are the data from one neuron located at a dorsal location in
the SC (384 μm from the SC surface). In Fig. 5A, Middle, the
average responses of this neuron to the natural (blue) and linear
sweep (red) stimuli are shown. Fig. 5A, Bottom displays the
predicted response (black) to the natural stimulus as well as the
observed natural stimulus response (blue). The predicted and
observed responses are compared in Fig. 5B, and for this neuron,
there is no significant relationship between the predicted and
observed responses to the natural stimulus (r = −0.29; P = 0.12).
Fig. 5 C and D illustrates the results of a GLM analysis for a
neuron recorded at a more ventral location in the SC (850 μm
from the SC surface). The responses to the natural and linear
sweep stimuli (Fig. 5C, Middle, blue and red lines, respectively)
are more similar than those of the neuron shown in Fig. 5A; as a
result, the GLM prediction of natural stimulus responses based
on the linear sweep stimulus responses is better for this neuron.
The efficacy of the GLM prediction can be seen qualitatively in
the similarity of the predicted and observed responses in Fig. 5C,
Bottom and quantitatively in Fig. 5D. Fig. 5D plots the predicted
response against the observed response to the natural stimulus.
The correlation coefficient for this comparison is highly significant
(r = 0.77; P < 0.0001), showing that responses of this ventral SC
neuron to the natural stimulus could be reliably predicted from
responses to the linear sweep stimulus.
To more thoroughly examine how the depth of recording in
SC influences the predictions of stimulus responses based on
spectrotemporal features, a GLM was calculated for each neu-
ron (as described above), and the stimulus response predictions
were analyzed with respect to the depth of the recording location.
Fig. 5E compares the recording depth of each neuron and how
well the linear sweep stimulus responses predict natural stimulus
responses by measuring changes in correlation coefficients
(r values). For these data, there is a significant correlation be-
tween recording depth and the accuracy of the GLM prediction
(r = 0.71; P < 0.0001). Moreover, the neurons for which the
linear sweep-based GLM model was a reliable predictor of natural
stimulus responses were clustered in the deeper recording sites

 (Fig. 5E, red data points indicate significant r values) (P < 0.0009
with Bonferroni correction). We were, however, concerned that
the results of the GLM predictions may be dependent on the
stimulus responses used to construct the GLM. To examine this
possibility, we constructed GLMs based on the responses to the
natural stimulus to predict responses to the linear sweep stimulus
(i.e., reversing the direction of the GLM). The results for natural
stimulus-based GLMs were consistent with those for GLMs con-
structed from linear sweep responses (Fig. 5F): the natural stim-
ulus responses failed to predict linear sweep responses in dorsal
SC, whereas in ventral SC, the natural stimulus responses were
good predictors of linear sweep responses. Lastly, to rule out the
effects of auditory response selectivity on GLM predictions, we
compared response selectivity with GLM model accuracy (Fig. S5)
and found no significant relationship.
Discussion
The midbrain SC has long been implicated in sensory grasp—for
behaviors such as saccadic eye movements, pinnae movements,
head movements, and body movements—pointing the primary
sensory apparatus toward a salient stimulus (17–20). Sensory
grasp not only requires stimulus localization but also, stimulus
selection. Prior studies have examined the activity of SC/OT
neurons related to visual stimulus selection (5, 8, 21, 22), but
questions remain on how SC neurons differentially respond to
acoustic stimuli to enable target selection for auditory grasp. The
echolocating bat’s active acoustic sensing system is particularly
well-suited to investigate auditory response selectivity, because
the very signals that the animal uses to track and intercept sonar
targets can serve as acoustic stimuli in neural recordings to rec-
reate natural listening experiences. The research findings reported
here contribute to a broader understanding of SC function by
showing auditory response selectivity of neurons in dorsal SC of
the echolocating bat, an animal that relies on discriminating echo
returns from its sonar vocalizations to orient and capture an au-
ditory object in 3D space.
SC auditory selectivity was observed in this study to stimuli con-
taining the natural spectrotemporal features of acoustic signals used
by the bat for spatial orientation (i.e., sonar vocalizations), and this
selectivity may serve to guide rapid species-specific orienting be-
haviors. Here, our data show clear differences in auditory response
selectivity of dorsal SC neurons to the natural multiharmonic FM,
linear FM sweep, and white noise stimulus sets matched in duration,
bandwidth, and amplitude but differing in spectrotemporal structure.
Previous research has shown that activity of SC neurons can be
modulated by the acoustic properties of sounds [e.g., binaural
and monaural stimuli (23), apparent motion (24), and temporal
separation between simulated sonar pulse and echo (10)]. SC
neurons in these studies were selective to changes in the patterning
of acoustic stimuli in either space or time. This study provides the
first detailed examination, to our knowledge, of spectrotemporal
acoustic selectivity of neurons across SC laminae, and this auditory
selectivity is likely to underlie neural processes contributing to
stimulus selection for orientation.
Possible sources of SC auditory selectivity are intrinsic and/or
afferent inhibitory circuitry (25–27). In this study, neurons in
dorsal SC showed greatest selectivity to FM stimuli, and previous
research suggests that inhibitory interactions may underlie the
sharpening of auditory responses to FM sweeps (28–30). Ana-
tomically, prior work has shown that dorsal SC contains more
lateral inhibitory connections than ventral SC (31). Furthermore,
research on the visual subdivisions of the SC identified lateral
inhibition that contributes to sensory selectivity (32), and addi-
tionally modeling studies have also suggested that intrinsic in-
hibitory mechanisms underlie stimulus selection in the SC (33).
Additionally, projections from superficial layers to deeper layers
are highly convergent (34), and such convergence results in the
integration of activity over a large pool of differentially tuned
sensory neurons, broadening the tuning of more ventral SC neu-
rons. We hypothesize that the decreased response selectivity of
deeper-layer SC neurons is a result of the merging of activity across
superficial sensory neurons tuned to different spectrotemporal
components of echo sound sources. In a manner similar to that in
this study, deeper-layer SC neurons in the monkey were also found
to be responsive to multiple features of a stimulus and even stim-
ulation across multiple sensory modalities (35).
In terms of extrinsic connections, descending projections to
the SC from auditory cortex and ascending projections from
inferior colliculus have been shown to shape FM sweep selec-
tivity (36, 37). Additionally, microstimulation of the forebrain in
barn owls increases spatial selectivity in the OT (38), identifying
another source of stimulus selectivity in midbrain neurons. In
other work on the barn owl, temporally inactivating the nucleus
isthmi pars magnocellularis, an inhibitory structure projecting to
the OT, eliminated competitive stimulus interactions in the OT
(39). Analogous inhibitory inputs to the SC, such as those orig-
inating in the substantia nigra (40, 41), may also contribute to the
stimulus selectivity observed in this study. Lastly, cortical pro-
jections to the intermediate and deep layers of the SC are from
multisensory areas of the cortex (42), suggesting that cortical

 afferents convey a combination of signals to ventral SC and leading
to larger response profiles. Selectivity to FM sweeps may, there-
fore, be imparted to SC neurons through projections from the in-
ferior colliculus, auditory cortex, and other brain regions as well as
generated intrinsically through lateral inhibitory connections.
Response selectivity arises through networks within sensory
systems. In birds, for example, discrimination and identification
of conspecific song require auditory processing to extract relevant
acoustic features for social interactions (43). Previous research in
the avian brain has identified multiple areas with neurons specif-
ically tuned to the spectrotemporal features of bird song (43).
Neural recordings from auditory areas of the avian brain reveal
that tuning is dependent on the acoustic stimulus, with responses
to artificial, simplified stimuli only approximating responses to the
natural, acoustically complex song (44). In one study examining
differences in auditory responses to complex, natural sounds and
responses to simpler, artificially generated sounds, it was reported
that auditory neurons exhibit extraclassical receptive fields arising
through nonlinear tuning properties (13). We have also found
nonlinear tuning properties in neurons found in the dorsal SC, and
similar mechanisms are likely to operate in shaping auditory re-
sponses of SC neurons in this study. Our results motivate future
research that assays SC function with stimulus parameters that are
behaviorally relevant to the study animal to illuminate the natural
processing of sensory stimuli for the purpose of selection.
Here, we report on auditory response selectivity in the bat SC,
which holds relevance for this animal’s natural behavior, namely
the processing of echo returns to guide goal-directed orienting
movements. We show that neurons in dorsal layers exhibit prop-
erties that support the selective processing of natural sensory sig-
nals, an important component of parsing and analyzing incoming
sensory information (45) to enable rapid species-specific orienting
behaviors (1). A lack of auditory selectivity in ventral locations of
the bat SC may reflect the integration of auditory information to
activate goal-directed orienting behaviors. These findings have
implications for a broader understanding of the functional role of
the midbrain in stimulus selection for sensory “grasp” across ani-

Methods
Big brown bats, E. fuscus, collected in the state of Maryland under a permit
issued by the Department of Natural Resources served as subjects in behavioral
and neurophysiological studies. The University of Maryland’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approved all of the procedures used for
this study.
Behavioral studies yielded acoustic data for neurophysiological experi-
ments. Three big brown bats were trained to rest on a platform and track a
tethered insect, whose motion was controlled by a pulley system (Fig. 1A).
The bat was rewarded at the end of each trial with the insect that it had
tracked. Recordings were made of the bat’s sonar vocalizations during insect
approach with a Brüel and Kjær 1/8-in Calibrated Microphone and sampled
at a rate of 500 kHz (National Instruments M-Series A/D Board; NI-DAQ)
(example recording is shown in Fig. 1B, Top).
Five example recordings of echolocation call sequences taken from three
bats were used to create a set of natural acoustic stimuli for neurophysiological
experiments. In all recordings, the bats adaptively adjusted the time–frequency
features of their vocalizations in response to prey location (46, 47). These re-
cordings were then used as auditory stimuli and are referred to as the natural
stimulus set.
We constructed a set of artificial stimuli with modifications to the spec-
trotemporal characteristics of the bats’ sonar vocalizations (Fig. 1B). The first
manipulation was a substitution of a single harmonic, linear FM down sweep
for each multiharmonic, hyperbolic natural sonar vocalization. This stimulus
is referred to as the linear sweep stimulus. The frequency range of the indi-
vidual sound elements in the linear sweep stimulus was fixed at 20–100 kHz,
matching the mean power of sonar pulses produced by bats tracking insects.
Each sonar pulse in the natural stimulus was substituted with the artificially
constructed linear FM sweep, maintaining the same time–amplitude profile as
the original recording. The second manipulation to the natural stimulus was a
substitution of band-pass white noise for each recorded sonar pulse referred
to as the white noise stimulus. The frequency band of the white noise stimulus
was the same as the linear sweep stimulus (20–100 kHz) and also matched the
time–amplitude profile of the natural stimulus. The linear sweep and white
noise stimuli were designed to create acoustic stimuli with matching duration,
bandwidth, amplitude, and repetition rate of the natural stimuli but differing
in spectrotemporal parameters. Stimulus sets were based on five recorded
echolocation sequences, yielding five natural, five linear sweep, and five white
noise sequences (15 stimuli in total), each with individual variations in the
timing and amplitude of signals. The stimuli were presented to the bat
through an array of 14 custom-made electrostatic speakers (Fig. 1C). The
peak amplitude of each stimulus set was 85-dB sound pressure level (SPL),
but because of the amplitude changes in the natural stimulus, the amplitude
of the signal elements within each set ranged from 78 to 85-dB SPL.
Extracellular recordings were taken from auditory neurons in the SC of five
awake, passively listening bats. On the day of the experiment, the bat was
placed in a custom holder, its head was fixed in position with a head post, and
a craniotomy was performed over the SC. In the bat, the SC sits on the dorsal
surface of the brain beneath two layers of skull. On the day of the head post
surgery, the first layer of skull is removed. On the day of the experiment, a
craniotomy is made with a small burr attached to a dental drill in the second
layer of skull. Making the craniotomy in this fashion is very fast and precludes
the need for anesthesia; therefore, no postanesthesia effects on neural re-
sponses were of concern during the day of the experiment. The recording
device was a silicon probe from Neuronexus that had a 4 × 4 arrangement of
recording sites (total size of 300-μm wide and 375-μm deep, 100 μm between
shanks, and 125-μm spacing between recording sites on each shank). The
order of the stimuli as well as the speaker broadcast position were ran-
domized to avoid any possible effects of repeatedly presenting a stimulus
from the same location. Auditory sites studied with at least 20 presentations
of each stimulus category were analyzed.
The recorded extracellular potentials were analyzed using MATLAB 2012b.
We first determined if the recordings were extracellular potentials of single
neurons or multiple neurons. The single units were sorted by performing a
principal components analysis on the spike waveforms (as described in ref.
48). The principal components analysis-based clustering resulted in single
units that matched with qualitative assessments of spike waveforms and
estimates of single-unit isolation based on spike refractory periods.
Auditory responses from the speaker location eliciting the largest response
(number of spikes) were used for subsequent analysis (SI Methods and Fig. S6).
The first analysis examined auditory response selectivity across three stimulus
categories: natural, linear sweep, and white noise stimuli. Neural responses
were analyzed in a 50-ms window starting at the onset of each sound element
in a stimulus. When the interval between successive sound elements was less
than 50 ms, spikes were counted only within the interval between the indi-
vidual sound elements. The spike count in each response window was then
converted into a spike rate value. For this study, we defined selectivity as the
inverse proportion of the full stimulus response greater than or equal to the
half-maximum response. As an example of this analysis, if a stimulus contained
30 individual sound elements, we determined which of those individual sound
elements elicited the highest spike rate and then, calculated how many of
the other 29 sound elements in a sequence elicited a response greater than or
equal to one-half of the maximum response. If, for instance, 10 sound ele-
ments (these sound elements do not need to be consecutive in time for this
analysis) in a 30 element stimulus sequence produce a response greater than
or equal to one-half of the maximum response, the selectivity index would be
1.0–0.33 or 0.66. Other criteria were tested, such as examining responses greater
than or equal to 25% or 33% of the maximum response, and these criteria
generated similar results. The half-maximum response was ultimately chosen,
because this threshold has been used in previous works to evaluate auditory
tuning of SC neurons (49, 50). We also examined whether the speaker broadcast
location affected response selectivity across the stimuli (Fig. S6) and found little
to no effect.
In an effort to determine how well responses to one stimulus category
predicted responses to a different stimulus category, a GLM built on linear
sweep responses was used to calculate predicted natural stimulus responses.
For each neuron recorded, the predictors (X) for the GLM were five of the
spectral features outlined in SI Methods: the amplitude, duration, amplitude
slope, spectral peak, and end frequency of the sweep. An iterative process
was used to determine which of 10 total spectrotemporal features to include
in constructing the GLM. All combinations between 2 and 10 features were
tested to determine how well the GLM calculated from the linear sweep
responses predicted the observed natural stimulus responses. The different
feature combinations were tested by performing a cross-correlation between

 the predicted responses and the observed responses. The observed response
input to the GLM was the mean spike count for each sound element in the
linear sweep stimulus, excluding responses to the first sound element.
Responses to the very first sound element in each stimulus set were often
onset responses that did not depend on the stimulus components. The pre-
dicted responses generated by the GLM were then compared with the ob-
served responses by computing a correlation coefficient (r). Lastly, to examine
whether the results of GLM fitting were dependent on the stimulus parame-
ters used to construct the GLM, a GLM model based on natural stimulus
responses was used to predict responses to the linear sweep stimulus.
This analysis was done in a similar fashion to that described above for linear
sweep stimulus response predicting natural stimulus responses using a GLM.
