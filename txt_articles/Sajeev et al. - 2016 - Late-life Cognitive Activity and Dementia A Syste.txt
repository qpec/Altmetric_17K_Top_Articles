Abstract
Background—Engaging in late-life cognitive activity is often proposed as a strategy to delay or 
prevent Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. However, it is unclear to what extent the 
available evidence supports a causal effect of cognitive activity in dementia prevention.
Methods—We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE through June 2014 to identify 
peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies of cognitive activity and incidence of AD or all-cause 
dementia. Eligible articles analyzed data from cohort or nested case-control studies, explicitly 
defined cognitive activity, evaluated participants for AD or all-cause dementia using clearly 
defined criteria, and provided effect estimates adjusted for at least age and sex. We describe 
methodologic issues and biases relevant to interpretation of these studies, and quantify the degree 
of bias due to confounding and reverse causation required to nullify typically observed 
associations.
Results—We reviewed 12 studies involving 13,939 participants and 1,663 dementia cases, of 
which 565 were specifically evaluated as AD. Most studies found associations between late-life 
cognitive activity and lower AD and/or all-cause dementia incidence. Differences in cognitive 
activity operationalization across studies precluded meta-analysis of effect estimates. Our bias

 analysis indicated that the observed inverse associations are probably robust to unmeasured 
confounding, and likely only partially explained by reverse causation.
Conclusion—Our systematic review and bias analyses provide support for the hypothesis that 
late-life cognitive activity offers some reduction in AD and all-cause dementia risk. However, 
more data are needed to confirm this relationship and on the optimal type, duration, intensity, and 
timing of that activity.
Introduction
An estimated 47 million people worldwide have dementia in 2015, and this number is 
projected to triple by 2050.1 Thus, the search for modifiable preventive factors is becoming 
increasingly urgent. One such potentially modifiable factor is cognitive activity, which is 
thought to contribute to building and maintaining brain structure and function,2,3 sometimes 
viewed as analogous to the contribution of physical exercise to cardiopulmonary and 
neuromuscular structure and function.
A variety of websites and publications encourage older adults to be mentally active (“use it 
or lose it!”) to protect brain health. Although epidemiologic studies often show reduced risk 
of dementia with late-life cognitive activity, concerns about residual confounding and 
reverse causation cast doubt on these findings. Several characteristics and behaviors linked 
with greater late-life cognitive activity, such as greater formal education, higher 
socioeconomic status (SES), and better general health, also appear to be associated with 
reduced dementia risk, suggesting that residual or unmeasured confounding may influence 
study findings4 Furthermore, falloff in cognitive activity in late life may be a consequence of 
cognitive losses prior to dementia onset, raising the possibility that reverse causation also 
contributes to the observed inverse associations.
To investigate these issues, we conducted a systematic review of epidemiologic studies of 
cognitive activity and incidence of Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD) and other dementias, 
characterized and quantified the potential bias from confounding and reverse causation, and 
identified additional methodologic issues relevant to the interpretation of these studies.
Methods
Systematic search strategy
We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE through June 2014 to identify 
relevant studies. To build our search strategy, we first obtained lists of index terms relevant 
to cognitive activity, AD, and dementia, and nested case-control and cohort studies using the 
PubMed Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database and the EMBASE EMTREE 
thesaurus. We also identified common synonyms for cognitive activity from primary and 
review articles and incorporated these terms into our search strategy (eTables 1 and 2).
Selection of studies
To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, be cohort 
or nested case-control studies in well-defined cohorts, have a clearly described

 operationalization of cognitive activity, evaluate cognitive activity prospectively in relation 
to dementia, evaluate all participants (or a systematically drawn sample) for AD or dementia 
using established diagnostic criteria, provide effect estimates with confidence intervals or 
standard errors for the association between cognitive activity and AD or dementia, and 
adjust for at least age and sex. This review was conducted in part for the database of AD 
epidemiology findings AlzRisk (www.alzrisk.org), which uses these pre-specified criteria 
and complies with current standards for systematic review and meta-analyses of 
observational studies.5,6
Data extraction
For each eligible study, we extracted the following: publication year; study cohort; study 
design; number of participants; baseline age distribution; follow-up time; method of 
ascertainment and operationalization of cognitive activity; number of AD and dementia 
cases; effect estimates, with confidence intervals or standard errors; and model covariates. 
Due to the heterogeneity of the exposure definitions used, we did not compute meta-analysis 
summary estimates.
Bias analysis method
Unmeasured confounding is likely present in all observational studies; more important is the 
degree to which such confounding biases estimated effects. We conducted a bias analysis7 to 
evaluate how reported hazard ratios (HR) for the effect on AD of ‘high’ versus ‘low’ levels 
of cognitive activity—obtained from one representative study8—would change under 
different assumptions about the magnitude of unmeasured confounding. As incipient 
dementia may be a shared cause of reduced cognitive activity and clinical dementia, we used 
this same approach to quantify how the observed association between cognitive activity and 
AD would be influenced by reverse causation.
We used a formal quantitative approach applicable to the case of a binary exposure, a 
hypothetical unmeasured binary confounder U, and a rare time-to-event outcome.7 It can be 
shown that the degree of confounding by U is a function of (1) the HR reflecting the 
association of U with AD, HRU-AD, conditional on exposure and measured covariates; (2) 
the prevalence of U in the high-activity group, p1, conditional on measured covariates; and 
(3) the prevalence of U in the low-activity group, p0, conditional on measured covariates. To 
quantify how confounding by U would change an observed estimate reflecting the effect of 
cognitive activity on AD (HRCA-AD), we calculated a bias-corrected estimate (HRCA-AD|U), 
the estimated effect of cognitive activity on AD that would have been obtained with 
adjustment for the hypothetical confounder U (in addition to the measured covariates). This 
bias-corrected estimate is a function of the observed estimate of the effect of cognitive 
activity on AD, and the three parameters defining the degree of confounding and is given by 
HRCA-AD|U = HRCA-AD /{[1 + (HRU-AD – 1)p1]/[1 + (HRU-AD – 1)p0]}. This approach 
entails an additional simplifying assumption of no interaction between the effects of U and 
cognitive activity on the hazard ratio scale. The impact of unmeasured confounding by U 
can be assessed in two ways. The first approach compares the observed estimate with the 
bias-corrected estimate under different specifications of U, and asks “given HRCA-AD, and 
specifying HRU-AD, p0 and p1, what would HRCA-AD|U be?” The second approach calculates

 how much confounding would be required for the observed association to be eliminated 
entirely, and asks “given HRCA-AD, what values of HRU-AD, p0 and p1 would make 
HRCA-AD|U become 1?”
To use this approach, we needed an effect estimate from a study that reported cognitive 
activity as a categorical exposure in relation to the time-to-event outcome of AD, and in 
which AD occurred relatively rarely (in general, this approach provides correct HR estimates 
when the disease occurs in up to 10% of both exposure groups in the study population). 
Among the cohort studies in our review, these conditions were most adequately met in 
Akbaraly et al.8, in which approximately 2% of the study population developed AD over a 4-
year follow-up period. (AD incidence was in the range of 10–15% over the follow-up 
periods of the other studies, which would lead to only minor violations of the rare disease 
assumption.) Notably, Akbarly et al. was similar to the other studies with respect to the types 
of cognitive activities assessed (eTable 3), the operationalization of cognitive activity as an 
exposure and the estimated magnitude of the association between cognitive activity and 
dementia (Table 1).
Akbaraly et al. compared AD risks corresponding to what the authors defined as “high” 
versus “low” (reference) engagement in both “stimulating” (HRCA-AD = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.21, 
0.71]) and “passive” (HRCA-AD = 0.68 [0.41, 1.13]) activity. We estimated how much 
confounding would be needed to increase these point estimates to 1. To be more 
conservative in our bias assessment, we also performed similar calculations for the upper 
confidence limit of the HR for stimulating activity. We did not perform this calculation for 
the upper confidence limit for the passive activity HR as it already exceeded 1.
Application to unmeasured confounding—For our bias analysis, we posited the 
presence of a binary confounder U to represent an unmeasured risk factor with either a small 
(HRU-AD = 1.5), moderate (HRU-AD = 2) or large harmful effect on AD (HRU-AD = 3). 
These three values encompass a range of effect estimates (risk, odds or hazard ratios) 
reported in studies of individual or multiple cardiovascular risk factors in relation to AD 
incidence.9,10 Depression,9 low education9 and lifecourse socioeconomic position11,12 are 
other potential confounders of the cognitive activity-AD association with effect estimates in 
this range. The studies we reviewed adjusted for confounding by these variables to varying 
degrees, so the specific unmeasured confounders represented by U, and the degree of 
residual confounding will differ across individual studies. We used these values of HRU-AD, 
and allowed p0 and p1 to vary between 0 and 1 in the formula above, to calculate how the 
HRCA-AD estimates from Akbaraly et al. would change under different amounts of 
confounding.
Application to reverse causation—The magnitude of bias due to reverse causation will 
depend on the degree to which individuals with mild cognitive impairment (or potential 
incipient dementia more broadly, including subjective cognitive concerns13, engage in less 
cognitive activity (p1 – p0), and on the magnitude of their increased risk of developing 
clinical dementia (HRU-AD). Such individuals are not excluded at baseline in most studies of 
the effect of cognitive activity on AD, and may account for a substantial portion of the study 
population; in three cohorts reviewed here, individuals with mild cognitive impairment made

 up 19%, 26%, and 39% of all non-demented individuals.8,14,15 Indications of incipient 
dementia in cognitively normal individuals are strongly associated with eventual AD or 
dementia diagnosis, with hazard or odds ratio estimates ranging from 2.8 to 6.7.13,14,16–18 
On the basis of these reports, we used an HR of 4.5 for the effect of incipient dementia on 
AD (HRU-AD = 4.5), and again calculated how reverse causation would change the 
HRCA-AD estimates from Akbaraly et al.
Results
Literature search results
Using our search strategy, we identified 926 citations. After removing 238 duplicate 
citations, and reviewing article titles and abstracts against our inclusion criteria, we 
identified 56 citations for full-text review. Of these, we excluded articles not in English. 
Twelve of the remaining English-language article met criteria for inclusion in our review 
(Figure).
Study design details
The 12 studies we reviewed included a total of 13,939 participants from 11 cohorts8,15,19–28 
(Table 1; eTable 4). Two studies analyzed the same participants from the Kungsholmen 
cohort; we included both, as they examined different aspects of cognitive activity.23,26 Of 
these 12 studies, 10 were prospective cohort studies including a total of 13,431 
participants8,15,21–28 and two were nested case-control studies19,20 The prospective studies 
assessed cognitive activity at a baseline visit late in life. Almost all studies inquired only 
about current or habitual participation in leisure activities; one additionally inquired about 
activity at ages 6, 12, 18 and 40.15 The two nested case-control studies assessed cognitive 
activity earlier in life; one inquired about current mid-life activity (at mean age 45)19, while 
the other asked at age 57 about activity before age 4020.
In the 10 prospective cohort studies, follow-up for dementia began immediately after the 
baseline visit. Six studies reported mean follow-up time (range, 2.5–6.1 years). In the two 
nested case-control studies with mid-life measures of cognitive activity, dementia follow-up 
began approximately 20 years after assessment of cognitive activity. All but one of our 
reviewed studies adjusted for education. Four studies additionally adjusted for SES, or a 
marker of SES such as occupation or income.
Dementia assessment
Most studies used multi-stage assessments for dementia, consisting of initial cognitive 
screening followed by more detailed clinical examinations under a standard protocol. Two 
studies conducted full annual examinations on all participants15,28. Dementia and AD were 
diagnosed by standard clinical and research criteria29–32. Diagnoses were available for AD 
alone in 3 studies15,27,28, for both AD and all-cause dementia in three studies8,20,25, and for 
all-cause dementia alone in six studies.19,21–24,26

 Definition, dimensions, and operationalization of cognitive activity
In all studies, popular leisure activities considered to require information seeking and 
processing were characterized as “cognitive.” Most studies assessed participation in a 
relatively narrow range of leisure activities, such as reading books, newspapers, or 
magazines; doing crosswords or playing cards; and watching television and listening to the 
radio. However, a few studies also inquired about activities such as participation in group 
discussions and attending cultural and social events (eTable 3).
The ways that studies operationalized cognitive activity varied widely. One study 
categorized activity based on frequency of participation across all cognitive activities, and 
did not distinguish different frequencies of participation in the specific activities assessed.26 
Most commonly, investigators started with reported frequency of participation in each 
activity, assigned a score corresponding to each frequency, and then combined scores across 
all activities into a composite score.8,15,21,25,27,28 Three studies used the total number of 
reported cognitive activities19,22,24; one study used time devoted to cognitive activities22; 
and one used a cognitive factor index score derived from an exploratory factor analysis of a 
mixture of leisure items20. A few studies also assessed the intensity of cognitive activity and 
further sub-classified activities as stimulating or passive (e.g., reading versus watching 
television), but these terms were not used consistently across studies.8,19,23
Summary of review findings
The 12 reviewed studies included a total of 1,663 dementia cases of which 565 were 
specifically AD. Most studies found inverse associations of late-life cognitive activity with 
AD and/or all-cause dementia (Table 1). In the six studies that operationalized cognitive 
activity using composite measures of participation frequency, greater participation was 
generally associated with lower incidence of AD and all-cause dementia.8,15,21,25,27,28 
Similarly, in three studies that examined the number of cognitive activities, higher activity 
count corresponded to lower dementia incidence19,22,24. In one study, time spent on 
cognitively engaging hobbies was also related to a lower dementia rate22. Among 
investigations of the intensity of cognitive activity, two found lower dementia incidence with 
engagement in stimulating but not passive activity8,23, whereas another found the opposite19.
Bias analysis results
Bias due to confounding—Table 2 shows how an observed HRCA-AD of 0.39 would 
change under our bias model if adjustment were also made for a strong unmeasured 
confounder, U (HRU-AD = 3), calculated under different scenarios for the prevalence of U 
among the active and inactive groups. If U were more prevalent among the cognitively 
active, the observed HRCA-AD of 0.39 would actually underestimate the true protective effect 
(HRCA-AD|U < 0.39). Under the more likely scenario that a harmful U is more prevalent 
among the cognitively inactive, the observed HRCA-AD of 0.39 would overestimate the 
protective effect (HRCA-AD|U > 0.39). In these instances, the estimated protective effect 
would diminish with adjustment for U, but it would be eliminated entirely or reversed only if 
there were extreme imbalances in the prevalence of U between activity groups. One such 
scenario would require the prevalence of U to be 81% in the low-activity group when its 
prevalence was 1% in the high-activity group. Prevalences of U in the low-activity group

 greater than 81% would make HRCA-AD exceed 1 in U-adjusted analyses, reversing the 
observed inverse association. Increasing the observed upper 95% confidence limit for this 
estimate from 0.71 to 1 would require smaller but still quite substantial prevalence 
differences; for U prevalences in the high-activity group of 1%, 10%, 25% and 50%, the 
corresponding prevalences required in the low-activity group would be 22%, 35%, 56% and 
91% respectively (eTable 5). If U were only moderately (HRU-AD = 2) or weakly (HRU-AD = 
1.5) associated with AD, an observed HRCA-AD of 0.39 would be weakened under U-
adjustment but would not be not nullified or reversed under any combination of U 
prevalences in the high- and low-activity groups.
Similarly, eTable 6 shows how an observed HRCA-AD of 0.68 would change under this bias 
model if adjustment were made for a strong confounder U (HRU-AD = 3). When the 
prevalence of U in the high-activity group is 1%, a prevalence of U in the low-activity group 
of 25% would be required to eliminate an observed association of this magnitude. For U 
prevalences in the high-activity group of 10%, 25% and 50%, the corresponding prevalences 
required in the low-activity group to eliminate the observed association would be 39%, 61%, 
and 98% respectively. If U were more weakly associated with AD (e.g., HRU-AD = 2 or 
HRU-AD = 1.5), larger prevalence differences than these would be required to eliminate an 
observed HRCA-AD of 0.68 entirely.
Bias due to reverse causation—Table 2 and eTable 6 also show how estimated 
HRCA-AD of 0.39 and 0.68 could reflect the presence of incipient dementia as specified 
(HRU-AD = 4.5), under a range of incipient dementia prevalences in the active and inactive 
groups specified in our bias model. If the incipient dementia prevalence was only 1% in the 
active group, then a prevalence of 48% in the inactive group would be required for an 
observed HRCA-AD of 0.39 to increase to 1 upon adjustment for incipient dementia. An 
incipient dementia prevalence of 10% in the high-activity group would require an incipient 
dementia prevalence of 71% in the low-activity group for an HRCA-AD of 0.39 to increase to 
1 (Table 2).
Under our bias model, smaller prevalence differences are required to increase an HRCA-AD 
of 0.68 to 1 (eTable 6). Calculating similarly, for incipient dementia prevalences in the high-
activity group of 1%, 10%, 25% or 50%, the corresponding prevalences required in the low-
activity group to eliminate the observed association, upon adjustment, would be 15%, 28%, 
50% and 87% respectively. Similar prevalence differences would be required to nullify a HR 
of 0.71, the upper 95% confidence bound of the HRCA-AD point estimate of 0.39 (eTable 5).
Discussion
These epidemiologic studies generally reported associations of greater participation in late-
life cognitive activities with lower risk of both AD and all-cause dementia. We consider the 
implications of our bias analysis on the extent to which these findings might result from 
confounding or reverse causation, and issues relevant to the definition, ascertainment and 
operationalization of cognitive activity that might also have led to biased results.

 Bias due to confounding and reverse causation
Confounding by shared causes of cognitive activity and dementia—
Characteristics associated with higher cognitive activity such as formal education and higher 
SES have also been consistently associated with reduced dementia risk.33,34 Almost all 
studies adjusted their estimates for formal education, and a few additionally adjusted for 
occupational history8, or income and indicators of early-life SES15, with generally 
unchanged results. However, some concern about residual confounding remains warranted, 
given the strong associations between different dimensions of SES and dementia risk34,35, 
and because education and SES are often measured and modeled inadequately.4 Given the 
correlation between higher SES and lower cardiovascular risk, adjustment for cardiovascular 
risk factors may also help reduce residual confounding by SES. Another potential source of 
confounding is longstanding intellectual ability, which is likely correlated with cognitive 
activity,36 education, and a variety of dementia risk factors; in one study, adjustment for 
intelligence quotient at age 11 mostly eliminated the positive associations between late-life 
cognitive activity and late-life cognitive performance.36 Additionally, as some of the 
cognitive activities frequently assessed in these studies also involve social engagement or the 
ability to travel (e.g., attending group activities, visiting the cinema/theatre), failure to adjust 
for general health status (or a proxy such as physical or social activity), which is also related 
to dementia37, may lead to an overestimated influence of cognitive activity on dementia risk.
However, under the bias model used in our analyses, the bias from residual confounding by 
these variables is unlikely to be large enough to completely explain inverse associations of 
the magnitude observed in the reviewed studies. Our calculations indicate that to eliminate 
protective HRs of 0.68 and 0.39, a strong harmful confounder, U, would need to be at 
minimum 24 and 80 percentage points more prevalent, respectively, among inactive 
individuals. Such large prevalence differences are indicative of very strong associations 
between U and cognitive activity; a 24-percentage point greater prevalence of U among 
inactive individuals would correspond to, at minimum, a U-cognitive activity OR of 2.66 
(when p1 = 0.38 and p0 = 0.62). Imbalances between activity groups of this size are also 
larger than those reported for important confounders in other studies. In Akbaraly et al., the 
largest imbalance across activity groups reported for any measured confounder was 17 
percentage points for low education, and imbalances of just 2, 5, and 6 percentage points 
were reported for diabetes, hypertension, and vascular disease, respectively.8 In a different 
study of cognitive function in which the size of similar confounder-cognitive activity 
relationships was reported, the prevalence imbalances were similarly modest.38 Additionally, 
our bias analysis suggests that even the bias-corrected upper confidence limit for this 
estimate would remain under 1. Arguably, correcting the upper confidence interval from a 
single study may be overly conservative; a hypothetical pooled estimate based on several 
studies would have a smaller upper confidence limit than the one used in this calculation.
Given the interrelationships between SES markers such as income and occupational 
attainment, as well as the association of these variables with cardiovascular risk factors and 
health status, confounding by collective effects of multiple unadjusted or incompletely-
adjusted SES-related variables may be of concern. While our simple analyses cannot 
quantify such complex biases we would expect that adjustment for education, which was

 done in almost all studies, would capture much of the confounding attributable to SES or 
related variables. In addition, correlations among these imperfectly adjusted variables might 
further decrease the expected bias.
Reverse causation—Individuals in the prolonged preclinical stages of dementia might be 
more likely to eschew participation in cognitive activities than their healthy 
counterparts15,39, resulting in an inverse association between activity and dementia risk. In 
most reviewed studies, analyses excluding individuals judged more likely to be in the 
prodromal stages of dementia (e.g., those with a mild cognitive impairment diagnosis, or 
poorer screening test performance, or dementia diagnosis early in the follow-up period) 
returned largely unchanged results. However, such exclusions may be insufficient, 
considering that average follow-up time in the late-life cognitive activity studies was 
between 2 and 7 years, whereas detectable cognitive decline begins as early as 5–8 years 
prior to dementia diagnosis40–42, and even more subtle impairments, perhaps noticeable only 
to affected individuals themselves, occur still earlier.43,44 If some of those with incident 
dementia in these studies were impaired enough at baseline to affect their cognitive activity, 
it is likely that the observed relationship at least partially reflects reverse causation.
We also analyzed how robust the observed associations might be to such reverse causation 
observing that associations of incipient dementia with both late-life activity and AD 
diagnosis would need to be large to completely explain findings of the magnitude observed. 
The magnitude of the effect of incipient dementia will differ between studies based on their 
average duration. We used an HR (4.5) from the middle of the range of reported estimated 
effects of indications of incipient dementia on risk for clinical dementia.13,14,16–18 Smaller 
HRs for the effect of incipient dementia yield results similar to those described for 
confounding, and would be unlikely to entirely explain the observed associations. However, 
under our bias model, with larger HRs for the effect of incipient dementia, smaller 
prevalence differences would be sufficient to fully explain an HRCA-AD of 0.68, attenuate an 
HRCA-AD of 0.39 and increase its upper confidence bound from 0.71 to 1. Overall, 
contingent on the validity of our model, it is plausible that reverse causation could bias these 
findings; the degree of bias could be substantial if the disparity in incipient dementia 
prevalence between high- and low-activity groups is large.
However, quantifying the degree to which incipient dementia is more prevalent among low- 
rather than high-activity individuals is difficult. In Akbaraly et al., cognitive impairment at 
baseline, defined as scoring less than 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, was more 
common among those with low (7.8%) rather than high (1.9%) levels of stimulating 
activity.8 Data on how late-life cognitive activity changes with declining cognition are 
sparse. In Wilson et al., baseline mild cognitive impairment was associated with lower 
cognitive activity at baseline, although not with decline in activity over a three-year follow-
up.15 The same investigators also showed that whereas cognitive activity predicted global 
cognitive function over the following year, global cognitive function did not predict 
subsequent degree of cognitive activity. However, performance in two specific cognitive 
domains, working memory and perceptual speed, was associated with decline in cognitive 
activity over the following year.45 To better understand the influence of reverse causation,

 longitudinal data on the extent and timing of cognitive activity changes will have to be 
evaluated in parallel with changes in cognition in longer prospective follow-up studies.
While the calculations reported here provide some measure of the potential degree of bias 
for a typical effect estimate, analyses using study-specific parameters will be better able to 
assess the degree of bias in individual studies. Nonetheless, our bias analyses can be 
informative in interpreting other studies in which the conditions required for use of this 
approach are met. These conditions are unlikely to be severely violated in the cohort studies 
reviewed here, where AD incidence over the relatively short study follow-up periods 
remains quite low. Additionally, the formula we used to calculate a bias-corrected HR 
applies analogously to odds ratios when the assumptions specified are met.7,47 Overall, 
under the specifications of our bias analysis and conditional on the validity of its 
assumptions, we found that the observed inverse associations are likely robust to 
unmeasured confounding, and likely only partially explained by reverse causation.
Methodologic considerations in measurement of cognitive activity
Type and context—Although cognitive activity scales are being developed,48 further 
investigation into valid measurement of the construct is warranted. In an effort to isolate the 
effect of purely cognitive activities,48 most studies focussed on leisure activities that are 
primarily or exclusively cognitive. Some of the more frequently assessed leisure activities 
(e.g., reading, attending theatre) are more likely to be favored by individuals of higher SES 
or educational attainment. Failure to assess other leisure or non-leisure activities requiring 
cognitive processing (e.g. home repair, gambling) would result in underestimating overall 
late-life cognitive activity for many individuals, and could bias estimates of its effect on 
dementia risk depending on the assessed activities’ associations with higher SES/education.
Self-reporting—Valid measurement of cognitive activity is particularly challenging in 
populations that may have cognitive deficits. All reviewed studies used self-reported data, 
but validation against other sources (e.g., diary records, electronic devices) was rare even 
though individuals with memory loss would be expected to self-report less accurately.49,50 If 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive concerns systematically 
under-report cognitive activity, lower participation would be spuriously linked with greater 
dementia risk. Alternatively, if participation frequency is overstated because of failure to 
accurately recognize or recall declines from lifetime activity levels, this would attenuate any 
protective association.
Timing and ‘dose’—A critical question from a prevention perspective is whether the 
inverse association between late-life cognitive activity and dementia can be attributed 
specifically to greater late-life cognitive activity, which would suggest that even cognitively 
‘sedentary’ individuals might benefit from increasing their cognitive activity late in life. Two 
studies in the same cohort concluded that the effect of cognitive activity depends on late-life 
activity because even after adjusting for activity earlier in life, late-life activity was strongly 
associated with lower AD incidence.15,46 Similarly, more detailed investigation of the ‘dose’ 
of cognitive activity associated with lower AD risk will be required to inform prevention 
guidelines. Questions about timing and dose of activity are germane to possible benefits of

 intervening throughout the lifecourse, such as recommending engagement in specific types 
of activities in midlife and possibly even policies and practices that shape childhood 
intellectual development.
Cognitive training versus cognitive activity—These epidemiologic findings, coupled 
with the hypothesized neuroprotective effects of cognitive activity, have inspired interest in 
cognitive training as a means to enhance late-life cognitive function. The largest trial to date, 
the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study, 
compared three group-based behavioral interventions in 2,786 cognitively normal, 
independently living adults (mean age 74). The interventions individually targeted memory, 
reasoning, and processing speed, and were compared with a no-contact regime.51 Post-
training improvements were maintained for at least 5 years in all three arms.52–54 
Additionally, self-reported difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living was 
lower in the training arms than among controls from year 2 onwards. However, the training 
interventions had no effects on performance-based measures of neurocognitive function at 
any of the follow-up points,53 and a secondary analysis including 189 incident dementia 
cases found no difference between trained and untrained groups in the rate of dementia 
occurrence over 5 years of follow-up.55 Expanding training to simultaneously target multiple 
cognitive domains, lengthening intervention time, and targeting an older-old population, 
have been suggested as modifications that may yield treatment effects on dementia 
incidence, but such strategies remain untested.
Although evidence from randomized trials so far does not support the efficacy of specific 
cognitive training interventions in preventing dementia, this does not rule out potential 
benefits of cognitively active lifestyles. The short-term influence of prescribed training 
interventions may differ from the cumulative stimulation attained via habitual performance 
of personally selected cognitive leisure activities. Interventions in line with a way of life that 
more fully incorporates cognitive activity as practiced in observational studies are difficult to 
define and operationalize in randomized trials. Evidence for any salutary effects of this 
broader notion of “engagement” (social, cognitive and otherwise) on late-life cognition may 
be better assessed by trials of more holistic interventions.56
Conclusion
Our systematic review and bias analyses suggest that late-life cognitive activity may offer 
some reduction in risk of AD and all-cause dementia. Our bias analyses appraised these 
epidemiologic findings with respect to two critical potential sources of bias—confounding 
and reverse causation—by quantifying the potential degree of these biases for a typical 
effect estimate. Under the parameters specified in our bias analysis, the observed inverse 
associations are unlikely to be explained entirely by unmeasured confounding, but reverse 
causation remains a more plausible but still little understood source of bias. Although a 
number of limitations in the measurement of cognitive activity might have led to bias, they 
do not appear sufficient to account for the observed findings. It remains possible, however, 
that confounding, reverse causation and measurement limitations could combine to 
substantially bias estimates. As with any bias analysis, our conclusions are conditional on 
the validity of our bias model.

 Over time, better characterization of the type, duration, intensity, and timing of activity57,58 
associated with late-life cognitive benefit will be required to develop more specific 
recommendations applicable over the lifecourse. Observational studies like those reviewed 
here can shed light on benefits associated with the performance of habitual, self-selected 
cognitive activities. Interventions under development extend this work by targeting cognitive 
activity and other modifiable dementia risk factors simultaneously.56,59 This type of multi-
modal approach was used in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive 
Impairment and Disability, in which the intervention group received diet, exercise and 
vascular risk monitoring regimens in addition to cognitive training.59 Another interventional 
program, Experience Corps, aims to increase older adults’ cognitive, physical and social 
activity by giving them meaningful volunteer roles in public elementary schools. 56 
Evidence from these different types of approaches will be critical to help us better 
understand the relationship of cognitive activity with late-life cognition.

Note: U is a hypothetical unmeasured binary confounder of the effect of cognitive activity on AD. HRU-AD reflects the magnitude of the association between U and AD. When HRU-AD = 3, the bias-
corrected AD HR will be exactly 1 when p1 = 1% and p0 =81%,.When HRU-AD = 4.5, the bias-corrected AD HR will be exactly 1 when p1 = 1% and p0 =48%,, and when p1 = 10% and p0 =71%.
