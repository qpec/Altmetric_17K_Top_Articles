Enhancing natriuretic peptide signaling in adipose
tissue, but not in muscle, protects against diet-induced
obesity and insulin resistance

In addition to controlling blood pressure, cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) can stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes and
promote the “browning” of white adipose tissue. NPs may also increase the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. To
unravel the contribution of NP-stimulated metabolism in adipose tissue compared to that in muscle in vivo, we gen-
erated mice with tissue-specific deletion of the NP clearance receptor, NPRC, in adipose tissue (NprcAKO) or in skeletal
muscle (NprcMKO). We showed that, similar to Nprc null mice, NprcAKO mice, but not NprcMKO mice, were resistant to
obesity induced by a high-fat diet. NprcAKO mice exhibited increased energy expenditure, improved insulin sensitivity,
and increased glucose uptake into brown fat. These mice were also protected from diet-induced hepatic steatosis and
visceral fat inflammation. These findings support the conclusion that NPRC in adipose tissue is a critical regulator of
energy metabolism and suggest that inhibiting this receptor may be an important avenue to explore for combating
metabolic disease.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity, a result of calorie intake exceeding energy expenditure, is fre-
quently associated with tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. It is
a major risk factor for many metabolic disorders, including type 2 dia-
betes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, and several types of cancer (1–3).
The link between obesity and T2D depends largely on the activity and
function of adipose tissue (4). In mammals, there are two major types of
adipose tissue with distinct physiological roles. White adipose tissue
(WAT) stores excess nutrients in the form of triglycerides, and brown
adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates heat through an uncoupling protein
1 (UCP1)–dependent mechanism. The “rediscovery” of functional
BAT in healthy adult humans (5) and the identification of UCP1-
positive brown-like (beige) adipocytes in white adipose suggests that
UCP1 is a potential target for increasing energy expenditure to control
body weight (6–9).
The cardiac-derived natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial NP (ANP),
and the relatedB-type NP (BNP) are key factorsthat controlblood pres-
sure by acting on the kidney (10). The physiological actions of ANP and
BNP are mediated by binding to NP receptor A (NPRA), which acti-
vates its guanylyl cyclase domain to produce cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-
monophosphate (cGMP), leading to activation of cGMP-dependent
protein kinases [protein kinase G (PKG)] (11, 12). The other receptor for
these cardiac NPs, NP receptor C (NPRC), functions to clear the NPs
from circulation through receptor-mediated internalization (13). Thus,
the ability of the NPs to elicit a biologicalresponse depends on the relative
ratio of the functionalreceptorNPRAto the“clearance receptor”NPRC.
NPreceptorsarepresentinadiposetissue(14).ANPstimulateslipolysis
in cultured human adipocytes, with potency similar to the b-adrenergic
agonist isoproterenol (15). We have shown that NPs can also induce
the adipose “browning” program through the same NPRA-cGMP-
PKG signaling cascade (16). We have previously shown that ANP treat-
ment of cultured human adipocytes increases mitochondrial biogenesis,
UCP1 abundance, and uncoupled respiration (16). Clinical studies in
humans report that NPs can increase energy expenditure and fat oxida-
tionindependentoftheb-adrenergicaxis(17).Comparedwithleanindi-
viduals, obese subjects have increased NPRC abundance in adipose
tissues, resulting in a decreased NPRA/NPRC ratio and blunted cellular
responses (18–20). This increase in NPRC in adipose tissue also has been
posited to contribute to the lower circulating BNP concentration ob-
served in obese subjects, possibly due to increased peptide uptake (21).
The ability of NPs to stimulate lipolysis is reported to be primate-
specific and not to occur in rodent adipose tissues (22). This species
difference is likely due to the fact that NPRC abundance in the rodent
is 100-fold higher (22, 23). In line with this hypothesis, primary adipo-
cytes from Nprc null mice (Nprc−/−) show a lipolytic response to ANP
(16). In addition, Nprc−/− mice have markedly reduced body weight and
fat mass as well as higher amounts of UCP1 in their white adipose de-
pots. We therefore proposed that NPRC plays a critical role in modulat-
ing the metabolic effect of NPs, particularly in the adipose tissue (16).
However, because studies in rodents and humans suggest that NPs may
be involved in skeletal muscle metabolism (24–27) and whole-body
Nprc−/− mice also exhibit a skeletal overgrowth phenotype (23, 28), it
is unclear whether adipose tissue is the major site by which NPs increase
energy expenditure. Here, we showed that deletion of Nprc in adipose
tissue (NprcAKO), but not in skeletal muscle (NprcMKO), protected
against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. NprcAKO mice ex-
hibited increased energy expenditure, reduced inflammation, and a re-
distributionoflipidstoragefromlivertovisceralfat.Thesefindingssuggest
that the adipose tissue is the major site of NP-mediated metabolic effects
in mice lacking NPRC under high-fat diet (HFD)–feeding conditions.
RESULTS
HFD-fed Nprc−/− mice were leaner and exhibited improved
glucose tolerance
NPRC was greatly increased at the mRNA and protein levels in the adi-
pose tissue of Nprc fl/fl mice after 12 weeks on an HFD (Fig. 1, A to C),
suggesting that the resulting increase in NPRC may attenuate the ability

Downloaded from 
 of NPs to stimulate lipolysis and thermogenesis. Nprc−/− mice on the
HFD gained less weight than wild-type mice, which was primarily
due to decreased fat mass (Fig. 2, A to E), without changes in food intake
(Fig. 2F). In addition to smaller depots of WAT, Nprc−/− mice also ac-
cumulated less lipid in both the interscapular brown fat (BAT) and the
liver (Fig. 2G) and had more UCP1 in the BAT (Fig. 2H). Nprc−/− mice
also showed better glucose and insulin tolerance (Fig. 2, I and J). Con-
sistent with a previous report (23), concentrations of circulating NPs
were not altered in Nprc−/− mice (fig. S1A). Together, these results suggest
that Nprc−/− mice are metabolically healthier than the wild-type mice.
Several studies suggest a role of NPs in regulating skeletal muscle
metabolism (24–27). In wild-type mice, the expression of Nprc and
Npra in skeletal muscle was lower than in adipose tissues, but the ratio
of Npra to Nprc was comparable (fig. S2, A and B). To investigate the
contribution of adipose tissue and muscle to
the leaner phenotype of HFD-fed Nprc−/−
mice, we next generated tissue-specific Nprc
knockout mice. Skeletal muscle–specific
knockout mice (NprcMKO) were generated
by crossing floxed Nprc mice (Nprc fl/fl)
with myogenin-Cre mice (29). NprcMKO
mice were born in the expected Mendelian
and sex ratios. Circulating NP concentra-
tions and blood pressure were comparable
between the two genotypes (fig. S1, B
and D). Nprc expression was efficiently
reduced in the skeletal muscle tissues
examined, with no changes in expression
of Npra, as indicated by quantitative real-
time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR) (fig. S2, C and D). However, we found
that compared to Nprc fl/fl mice, HFD-fed
NprcMKO mice had comparable body weight
and composition (Fig. 3, A to D), energy
expenditure (Fig. 3E and fig. S3, A and B),
food consumption (Fig. 3F), physical activ-
ity (Fig. 3G), and glucose and insulin toler-
ance (Fig. 3, H and I). Therefore, contrary
to expectation, these results suggest that
skeletal muscle did not contribute to the
metabolic improvements seen in HFD-fed
Nprc−/− mice.
HFD-fed NprcAKO mice gained less
body weight and exhibited higher
energy expenditure and improved
glucose tolerance
Adipocyte-specific Nprc knockout mice
(NprcAKO) were generated by crossing the
floxed Nprc mice with adiponectin-Cre
mice (30). Nprc AKO mice were born in
the expected Mendelian and sex ratios.
Their circulating NP concentrations and
blood pressure were comparable to lit-
termate Nprc fl/fl mice (fig. S1, C and D).
NPRC mRNA and protein were absent
from the WAT and BAT of the NprcAKO
mice, but not in the liver, kidney, or heart,
whereas there was no change in Npra and
NPRA in any of the tissues examined (fig. S2, E to G). When fed a HFD,
NprcAKO mice gained less weight than Nprc fl/fl mice (Fig. 4, A and B).
Total fat mass was reduced in NprcAKO mice (Fig. 4C), whereas lean
mass was not different between genotypes (Fig. 4D).
Indirect calorimetry analysis showed that oxygen consumption, car-
bon dioxide production, and energy expenditure increased in HFD-fed
NprcAKO mice (Fig. 4E and fig. S3, C and D) without alterations in food
intake or physical activity (Fig. 4, F and G). After 12 weeks on an HFD,
NprcAKO mice had a significantly lower fasting plasma insulin con-
centration compared with Nprc fl/fl mice (Fig. 4H). GTT revealed that
NprcAKO mice had lower blood glucose concentrations with a signifi-
cantly reduced AUC (Fig. 4I). Similarly, ITT showed that the NprcAKO
mice had improved insulin sensitivity, although the decrease in AUC
was not statistically significant (Fig. 4J).

 HFD-fed Nprc AKO mice showed increased glucose uptake and
thermogenesis-related gene expression in the BAT
We next examined insulin action in conscious, unrestrained mice by
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. NprcAKO mice had a higher glu-
cose infusion rate than Nprc fl/fl mice (Fig. 5A), indicating enhanced
insulin sensitivity. In line with this finding, there was a statistically in-
significant increase in the rate of endogenous glucose disappearance
(Rd) in NprcAKO mice (Fig. 5B), suggesting increased glucose disposal.
In both genotypes, glucose appearance rate (Ra) was comparably sup-
pressed by the insulin clamp, illustrating that hepatic insulin action was
not different between genotypes (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, there was a sig-
nificantly higherrate of glucose uptake (Rg) into BATthan Nprc fl/fl mice
but not into other tissues examined (Fig. 5D).
Because the most substantial difference
in glucose uptake in the clamp studies be-
tween the genotypes was observed in the
BAT, we examined whether this difference
was associated with higher thermogenic ac-
tivity in the BAT of NprcAKO mice. Com-
pared to Nprc fl/fl control mice, UCP1 was
more abundant in the BAT of Nprc AKO
mice (Fig. 5, E and F). Consistent with this
finding, the transcription of a battery of key
thermogenic genes (for example,Pgc1a and
Cidea), mitochondrial genes (for example,
Cpt1b, Cycs, and Cox7a1), and fatty acid
oxidation genes (for example, Acox1 and
Cidec) was also higher in the BAT from
NprcAKO mice compared to Nprc fl/fl mice (Fig.
5G).In addition, the transcription of several
genes encoding BAT-derived adipokines,
including Fgf21, Nrg4, and Bmp8b, also
increased in the BAT of NprcAKO mice (Fig.
5G). Although the absence of NPRC in
iWAT and gWAT might be expected to fa-
vor increased expression of thermogenesis-
related genes in those tissues (16), the two
genotypes did not show differences for
the expression of any of these genes except
for Cidec (fig. S4, A and B). We also saw no
histological evidence of “beige” or UCP1-
positive cells (fig. S4C). Thus, contrary to
expectation, deletion of Nprc promoted ther-
mogenesis in the BAT but not in iWAT or
gWAT for Nprc AKO mice, at least in the
setting of diet-induced obesity.
Nprc deficiency in adipocytes results
in a healthy redistribution of lipid
storage and prevents inflammation in
adipose tissue
Upon dissection, gross examination of tis-
sues showed that despite an overall reduced
body fat (Fig. 4C), the mass of the iWAT fat
pad was not different between genotypes
(Fig. 6A). However, Nprc AKO mice had
increased gWAT mass, whereas liver
weight was significantly reduced (Fig. 6A).
The size of the adipocytes in the iWAT de-
pots from NprcAKO mice was smaller than those from Nprc fl/fl mice (fig.
S5, A and B). The BAT of NprcAKO mice did not change in overall mass
but had a slightly darker complexion and smaller lipid droplets com-
pared with that of Nprc fl/fl mice (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, the livers
of NprcAKO mice were essentially devoid of steatosis (Fig. 6, A and B),
which was associated with reduced expression of lipogenic and fatty
acid uptake genes (such as Lpl, Acca, and Srebf1) (Fig. 6C). In the gWAT
depot of Nprc fl/fl mice, there was a high density of crown-like structures
(Fig. 6B), indicative of inflammatory macrophage infiltration into the ad-
ipose tissue that is associated with insulin resistance (31). In contrast, few
crown-like structures were detected in Nprc AKO gWAT. Immuno-
histochemical staining for the macrophage-specific marker F4/80 con-
firmed the robust presence of macrophages in the gWAT from Nprc fl/fl

 mice but not in that from NprcAKO mice (Fig. 6D). qRT-PCR analysis
further confirmed that F4/80 expression was significantly reduced in
gWAT of NprcAKO mice (Fig. 6E), whereas genes related to proinflamma-
toryM1macrophage activation (such as Cd68, Tnfa, and Il-1b) were not
significantly different (Fig. 6E). The expression of genes encoding anti-
inflammatory M2 macrophage markers (such as Arg1 and Il-10) increased
inNprcAKOmiceinanonstatisticallysignificantmanner.Althoughcrown-
like structures were not detected in iWAT of either genotype, there was
nevertheless a significant reduction in F4/80 (Fig. 6F). In NprcAKO mice,
there was also a significant increase in Il-10 expression (Fig. 6F), which
encodes an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory cytokine (32). Adipose in-
flammation is closely associated with fibrosis (33). Compared to Nprc fl/fl
mice, fibrosis was reduced in the gWAT of NprcAKO mice, as indicated by
Picro-sirius staining (Fig. 6G). Similarly, in line with the amelioration of
hepaticsteatosis,focalliverfibrosiswasalsore-
duced in NprcAKO mice (Fig. 6H). Moreover,
adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing hormone
that promotes macrophage polarization
toward an anti-inflammation phenotype
(34, 35), significantly increased in gWAT at
the mRNA level (Fig. 6E) and in the plasma
(Fig. 6I) of NprcAKO mice.
Nprc AKO mice on an HFD gained less
body weight and showed improved insulin
sensitivity, despite a larger gWAT depot than
in the Nprc fl/fl control mice. Basal insulin
signaling was increased in gWAT of the
Nprc AKO mice, as evidenced by increased
AKT phosphorylation and glucose trans-
porter type 4 (GLUT4) protein (Fig. 7A). In
addition, the abundance of acyl–coenzyme
A carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase
(FASN), markers of de novo lipogenesis, was
also higher in the gWAT of Nprc AKO mice.
The abundance of key transcriptional regu-
latorsofadipogenesis,peroxisomeproliferator–
activated receptor a (PPARa), and CCAAT/
enhancer binding protein (C/EBPa), were
also higher in gWAT tissue samples from
NprcAKO mice (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, the
abundance of adiponectin also increased
at the protein level in gWAT of Nprc AKO
mice (Fig. 7A). Active adipogenesis and lipo-
genesis in the gWAT depot of NprcAKO mice
are consistent with the increased mass of
this depot.
The amount of NPRA did not change,
but PKG activity, as indicated by the phos-
phorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phos-
phoprotein (VASP), was greater in the gWAT
of NprcAKO mice (Fig. 7A). Consistent with
increased PKG activity, there was an increase
in phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase
(HSL) and total adipose triglyceride lipase
(ATGL), suggesting that in the NprcAKO
gWAT tissue there was also a higher degree
of lipolysis in addition to increased lipo-
genesis and triglyceride deposition. In the
iWAT of the NprcAKO mice, basal insulin
signalingactivity increased(Fig. 7B). However, therewasstillanincrease
in phosphorylated VASP and phosphorylated HSL, suggesting higher
PKG signaling and lipolysis. In the BAT of the NprcAKO mice, there were
no apparent changes in markers of insulin signaling, de novo lipo-
genesis, or adipogenesis but a moderate increase in phosphorylated
VASP and phosphorylated HSL (Fig. 7C).
The increased PKG activity in NprcAKO adipose tissues was fur-
ther confirmed in vitro using primary adipocytes differentiated from
the stromal vascular fraction of the iWAT depots from the two geno-
types. Cells from both genotypes differentiated into adipocytes to a
similar extent (fig. S6A). When stimulated by a cocktail containing
ANP and BNP, Nprc-deficient adipocytes showed greater PKG activity,
as indicated by phosphorylation of VASP, and higher lipolytic activity
(fig. S6, B to D), indicating that Nprc-deficient adipocytes were more

 responsive to NP stimulation. We used human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293 cells that stably express NPRA [also known as HEK293-
GCA cells (36)] to further test, in a controlled way, the role of NPRC
in the ANP dose-response curve. The presence of NPRC resulted in a
shift of the cGMP dose-response curve to the right, compared to
HEK293-GCA cells without NPRC (fig. S6, E and F). Together, these
data indicated that NPRC deletion from ad-
ipose tissue increased the potency of ANP,
thereby increasing PKG signaling and
leading to an improvement in the metabolic
phenotypes.
DISCUSSION
The link between obesity and the cardiac
NPs originates with reports by Sarzani et al.
showing that receptors for ANP and BNP
are present in adipose tissue (14) and that
obese human subjects often have substan-
tially higher amounts of the NP clearance
receptor NPRC in adipose tissue and lower
circulating NPs (18, 37). An increase in
NPRC relative to the signaling receptor
NPRA renders the tissue less responsive to
NPs (fig. S6, E and F). The high amount of
NPRC in the adipose tissue of obese subjects
gave rise to the notion that adipose tissue
might be a “sink” for circulating NPs, which
could contribute to the hypertension that is
often associated with obesity (18, 38). It is
noteworthy also that lower plasma NP con-
centrations in obese human subjects could
also be the result of reduced secretion of
NPs because obesity is also associated with
lower concentrations of N-terminal pro-
BNP, a precursor fragment that is not
cleared by NPRC (39).
ANP stimulates lipolysis in cultured hu-
man adipocytes through increases in cGMP
and PKG activity, in a manner parallel to
b-adrenergic receptors (bARs) and cyclic
adenosine 5′-monophosphate/protein kinase
A [reviewed in (40)]. NPRA activation also
leads to uncoupled respiration in brown adi-
pocytes and increases browning of WAT,
again in a parallel pathway to the bARs
(41). Because a growing body of evidence
places the NP system at the center of “cardio-
metabolic” disease (42), including the
adipocyte response to early pathological
stress on the heart (43), we studied their
tissue-specific effects by manipulating
NPRC abundance.
Mice with naturally occurring mutations
that disrupt the expression of the Nprc gene
are longer due to delayed bone ossification
and have very little body fat, giving rise to their
original names of “longjohn” and “strigosus”
(28). We have shown that the WAT and BAT
of Nprc−/− mice have smaller lipid droplets and an increased ability to
respond to NPs for lipolysis (16). Here, we showed that Nprc−/− mice
were also protected from HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
This metabolic benefit was retained in Nprc AKO mice but not in
NprcMKO mice. These findings indicated that the role of NPRC in reg-
ulating NP-mediated metabolism during HFD-feeding conditions

 largely depended on the adipose tissue but not on the skeletal muscle.
This finding is consistent with previous findings that the improvement
of insulin sensitivity in obese and diabetic subjects is associated with an
increased NPRA/NPRC ratio in adipose tissue but not in skeletal muscle
(19). Because NPs promote oxidative metabolism in human skeletal
muscle (17, 27), the role of NPRC in skeletal muscle metabolism in
the NprcMKO mice may need to be investigated under other physiolog-
ical settings, such as exercise performance or in response to direct NP
infusions, as has been done in humans (25).
We showed here that targeted Nprc deficiency in adipose tissue
increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production without
altering food intake and physical activity. Notably, UCP1 and other mito-
chondrial proteins increased in the BAT of NprcAKO mice, suggesting
higher thermogenic activity. These findings are consistent with a previous
study, wherein transgenic overexpression of either BNP or PKG decreases
body weight and increases the expression of genes involved in thermogen-
esis in the BAT of mice consuming either a chow diet or an HFD (26). An
importantobservationfromourfindingsthatneedstobefurtherstudiedis
that the expression of Fgf21, Nrg4, and Bmp8b, which encode BAT-
enriched adipokines, increased in the BAT of NprcAKO mice. FGF21 (fi-
broblast growth factor 21) regulates energy expenditure, glucose ho-
meostasis, and insulin sensitivity, potentially through the action of
adiponectin (44, 45). Neuregulin 4 (NRG4) is a brown fat–enriched se-
creted factor that preserves metabolic homeostasis through attenuation
of hepatic lipogenesis (46). Bone morphogenetic protein 8B (BMP8B) in-
creases BAT thermogenesis through both central and peripheral actions
(47). It is possible that one of the effects of NP signaling in the BAT is
the synthesis and release of these “batokines.” Consequently, the increased
production of these batokines in NprcAKO mice may also contribute to the
overall improved metabolic profile of these mice in an endocrine and/or
paracrine manner. The reduced liver fibrosis that we observed in NprcAKO
mice is reminiscent of previous findings that continuous ANP intravenous
infusion or transgenic BNP overexpression prevents liver fibrosis (48, 49).
Because our NprcAKO mice did not show differences in NPRC or NPRA
abundance in the livers compared with Nprc fl/fl mice (fig. S2, E to G), we
favortheinterpretationthattheabsenceofsteatosiswastheprimaryreason
for reduced fibrosis. Moreover, whether NRG4 is responsible for the re-
duced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis of NprcAKO mice is still to be explored.
Here, we found no indications of “beiging” in the WAT of either
Nprc−/− or NprcAKO mice when fed an HFD. This finding may be due
to additional unidentified factors induced by HFD feeding that could
weaken the adipose browning program driven by NP. In addition to in-
creasedthermogenesisin the BAT,the gWATmassof HFD-fed NprcAKO
mice unexpectedly increased, as did de novo lipogenesis and adipogen-
esis. PKG promotes brown adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial
biogenesis (50). Whether the cGMP pathway is involved in adipogen-
esis in WAT depots deserves further exploration (51). Moreover, the
gWATofHFD-fedNprcAKOmicewasmetabolicallyhealthier.Thisfind-
ing is reminiscent of a previous study showing that the capacity to ex-
pand adipose tissue can be associated with greater insulin sensitivity (52).

 Adipose tissue inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance (53).
Along with improved insulin sensitivity, we found that in NprcAKO
mice, the gWAT did not contain macrophage infiltration, as seen in
the gWAT of NprcAKO mice. It is not clear whether the loss of NPRC
from adipocytes is responsible for the reduced inflammation, which, in
turn, improved insulin sensitivity or vice versa. PKG activity was
increased, potentially through NP/NPRA signaling, in the visceral fat of
NprcAKO mice, and adiponectin in both plasma and gWAT increased ac-
cordingly. Although the effects on adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and inflam-
mation together might be responsible for the improved insulin sensitivity
in NprcAKO mice, the mechanistic connection between the enhanced NP
signaling and improved insulin sensitivity is yet to be investigated.
In conclusion, our results highlight a key role of cardiac NPs and
their signaling in adipose tissue to regulate systemic energy expenditure
and glucose homeostasis. Adipose-specific deletion of Nprc protects
against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance by activating ther-
mogenesis and glucose uptake in the BAT, increasing lipolysis in sub-
cutaneous iWAT, and alleviating inflammation while promoting tissue
expansion in visceral gWAT. These various mechanisms of metabolic
adaptation suggest the versatile functionsofNPsignalinginthecontrolof
energymetabolism in different adipose depots. These studiesdemonstrate
thatattenuationofNPRCactivity in adipose tissue has the potential to be
a therapeutic mechanism for controlling metabolic disease.

Biotechnology), UCP1 (ab23841, Abcam), and GAPDH (sc25788, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and CYTOC (sc13156, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Secondary antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (A3687)
and mouse IgG (A3562), both conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, were
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animal experiments
Nprc−/− mice (backcrossed to C57BL/6J for at least eight times) were a
gift fromN. MaedaandO.Smithies (Departmentof Pathology andLab-
oratory Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel
Hill, NC, with the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center). Mice with
a floxed Nprc allele were generated for this study by the Knockout
Mouse Project at the University of California, Davis. Myogenin-Cre
mice were a gift from E. Olson of University of Texas (UT) Southwestern
Medical Center and bred to generate mice with skeletal muscle–specific
disruption of the Nprc gene. Adiponectin-Cre mice (JAX-010803) were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred to generate mice with
adipose-specific disruption of the Nprc gene. Tail DNA genotyping and
qRT-PCR of lysate from different tissues were used to confirm the spe-
cific deletion of Nprc in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues. Mice were
kept under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle at constant temperature
(23°C) with unlimited access to food and water. A 60% HFD (D12492,
Research Diets) was provided starting at 7 weeks of age and maintained
for 12 weeks, during which time body weight and body composition
were monitored. After the 12-week feeding period, mice were eutha-
nized, and tissues were carefully dissected, weighed, and either imme-
diately frozen in liquid nitrogen or processed for histology. All animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mitteofSanfordBurnhamPrebysMedicalDiscoveryInstituteinaccord-
ance with the eighth edition of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Primary adipocyte cell culture, oil red O staining, and
glycerol release
Primary adipocytes were prepared from iWAT and differentiated, as pre-
viously described (54). For oil red O staining, differentiated adipocytes
were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, stained with 0.5% oil red
O for 1 hour at room temperature, and then washed with water. Glycerol
release was evaluated with the free glycerol reagent from Sigma-Aldrich
(F6428) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Indirect calorimetry
After 5 weeks (NprcAKO) or 6 weeks (NprcMKO) on HFD, mice were
housed and monitored seperately in open-circuit Oxymax chambers
(Columbus Instruments) with free access to HFD and drinking water
for 72 hours. Oxygen comsumption, carbon dioxide production, and
physical activity were monitored at 15- to 20-min intervals. Food and
water intake was also recorded. Data from the first 24 hours were dis-
carded because the mice adapted to the new housing.
GTT and ITT and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps
During the last week of HFD, mice were fasted for 5 hours, glucose
(1 g/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, and blood glucose concentra-
tions were measured through tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min
with Bayer CONTOUR blood glucose monitoring system. For the ITT,
insulin (0.8 U/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and blood glu-
cose concentrations were measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. The
AUC was calculated from the baseline and divided by the period of
time. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed as previ-
ously described (55).
Plasma insulin, adiponectin, and measurement of
ANP and BNP
Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture after a 5-hour fast
using heparin anticoagulation tube. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit was used to detect plasma concentrations of insulin (Mercodia),
adiponectin (AdipoGen), and ANP and BNP (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals)
according to the respective manufacturer’s instructions.
Tissue histology and microscopy
Adipose tissues and liver were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated, embedded in paraffin,
and cut into 5-mm sections. Sections were stained with H&E and
examined under bright-field microscopy with a Nikon 80i. Adipocyte
sizes were quantified using ImageJ software with the “Adipocyte”
application tool. The UCP1 and F4/80 staining was performed on the
Leica BOND RX automated system. Sections were deparaffinized, re-
hydrated, heated for antigen retrieval, and then incubated with UCP1
antibody (1:400 dilution; ab10983, Abcam) at room temperature for
2 hours and F4/80 antibody (1:50 dilution; HM1066, Hycult Biotech)
for 1 hour. After washing in the Leica BOND wash buffer, slides were
incubated with Rat Probe, followed by incubation with Rat-on-Mouse

Polymer Refine Detection kit (DS9800, Leica Biosystems) for UCP1
staining and the Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection kit (DS9390, Leica
Biosystems) for F4/80 staining. Slides were counterstained with hema-
toxylin, and coverslip was added. UCP1 staining was quantified by analyz-
ing five randomly selected fields from two sections of individual mice
with a positive pixel count application tool (Aperio, Leica Biosystems).
Picro-sirius staining was performed on paraffin sections of gWAT and
livers using a Picrosirius Red Stain kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (24901, Polysciences).
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and
purifiedbyRNAMinicolumns(Qiagen).Reversetranscription(Applied
Biology) and SYBR green qRT-PCR (Life Technologies) were per-
formed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Target primer se-
quences are presented in table S1. qRT-PCR results were analyzed by
DDCt method, normalized to the internal control gene 36B4, and ex-
pressed as mean ± SEM.
Protein extraction and Western blotting
Protein was extracted from tissues, as previously described (56). For
Western blotting analysis, 40 mg of protein, unless otherwise indicated,
was resolved by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated overnight
at 4°C with specific primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies con-
jugated with alkaline phosphatase were used for specific protein detection.
Mitochondrial DNA isolation and quantitative PCR
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was extracted from the skeletal muscle,
as previously described (57). mtDNA and nuclear DNA were deter-
mined by evaluating the abundance of the DNA encoding NADH de-
hydrogenase subunit 1 and lipoprotein lipase by DDCt methods, as
previously described (57).
cGMP dose-response assay
HEK293 cells that were stably transfected with the green fluorescent
protein–tagged NPR1 plasmid (also known as HEK293-GCA cells)
were a gift from J. Burnett (36). HEK293-GCA cells were transfected
with NPRC–YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) or YFP plasmids by poly-
ethylenimine when reaching 80 to 90% confluency and replated into
gelatin-coated six-well plates for treatments. Three days after transfec-
tion, cells were placed into serum-free media for 16 hours. The non-
selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
(IBMX; 0.5 mM) and the phosphodiesterase 9 (cGMP-specific and
IBMX-insensitive phosphodiesterase) inhibitor BAY73-6691 (50 nM)
were added to the cells for 1 hour before stimulation with 0 to 3000 nM
ANP. cGMP production was stopped after 15 min of ANP treatment by
placing cells on ice and washing with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed into
300 ml of PBS by four cycles of freeze-thaw-vortex method. The concen-
trations of cGMP were measured with a homemade competitive en-
zyme immunoassay kit. Briefly, protein G–coated plates (15133, Pierce)
were washed with wash buffer (PBS + 1% Tween 20), coated with 100 ml
per well of antibody against cGMP (1:1000; ab836, Abcam) in 0.05 M
carbonate bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for 2 hours, and blocked with
blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 hour at room
temperature (RT). Fifty microliters of cell lysates per well were incu-
bated with 50 ml of cGMP–horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:10,000;
M01058, GenScript) and diluted in blocking buffer for 2 hours at RT.
Plates were washed with washing buffer and incubated with 100 ml
per well of TMB reagent (BioFX Laboratories) for 15 min at RT. The
reaction was stopped by adding 100 ml per well of 0.25 M H2SO4. Optical
density at 450 nm was read, and the data were plotted as linear B/B0%
versus log cGMP concentration using a four-parameter logistic fit.
In vivo pressure hemodynamics
In vivo pressure hemodynamics was performed as described (58).
Briefly, male mice (3 to 4 months old) were injected with etomidate
(10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and then placed in an induction chamber
filled with 3.5% isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen. Sedated mice were
then intubated with a 20-gauge catheter sleeve, placed atop a heated
surgical board, and connected to a small animal ventilator (model
SAR-830/P; CWE Inc.). Respiration was set to 14- to 18-cm H2O at a
rate between 140 and 160 breaths per minute, and isoflurane levels were
adjusted using a vaporizer to attain a surgical plane of anesthesia (2 to
3%). A small area of skin in the neck region was removed, the sublingual
salivary glands were gently separated, and a section (15 to 20 mm) of the
right common carotid was isolated caudally from the bifurcation of the
internal and external carotid. To aid in vessel cutdown and pressure
catheter insertion, a 4-0 suture was tied at the bifurcation, a small vas-
cular clamp was placed as far caudally as possible, and a second 4-0 su-
ture was placed between the two. The vessel was then cut down, and a
1.4-F pressure catheter was inserted (model SPR-671, Millar Instru-
ments) and advanced to near the aortic valve. Pressure traces were
recorded using LabChart 8.0 (ADInstruments) software, and isoflurane
was reduced to 1.5%. A rectal probe was then inserted to monitor core
body temperature, which was held at 37 ± 1°C. After 10 min, which
allowed the animal ample time to recuperate from surgery, consecutive
pressure tracings from at least 30 to 60 s worth of stable recordings were
analyzed using the built-in tools of the LabChart software.
Statistical analysis
All data are means ± SEM. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t tests or two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc tests with
Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons tests was used to ex-
amine differences between groups, as appropriate. Glucose infusion rate
was analyzed by one-tailed Student’s t test. Statistical significance was
defined as P < 0.05.
