The 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland, emitted ∼11 Tg of SO2 into the troposphere over 
6 months, and caused one of the most intense and widespread volcanogenic air pollution events in 
centuries. This study provides a number of source terms for characterisation of plumes in large fissure 
eruptions, in Iceland and elsewhere. We characterised the chemistry of aerosol particle matter (PM) and 
gas in the Holuhraun plume, and its evolution as the plume dispersed, both via measurements and 
modelling. The plume was sampled at the eruptive vent, and in two populated areas in Iceland. The 
plume caused repeated air pollution events, exceeding hourly air quality standards (350 μg/m3) for SO2
on 88 occasions in Reykjahlíð town (100 km distance), and 34 occasions in Reykjavík capital area (250 km 
distance). Average daily concentration of volcanogenic PM sulphate exceeded 5 μg/m3 on 30 days in 
Reykjavík capital area, which is the maximum concentration measured during non-eruptive background 
interval. There are currently no established air quality standards for sulphate. Combining the results from 
direct sampling and dispersion modelling, we identified two types of plume impacting the downwind 
populated areas. The first type was characterised by high concentrations of both SO2 and S-bearing PM, 
with a high Sgas/SPM mass ratio (SO2(g)/SO2−
4
(PM) > 10). The second type had a low Sgas/SPM ratio (<10). 
We suggest that this second type was a mature plume where sulphur had undergone significant gas-
to-aerosol conversion in the atmosphere. Both types of plume were rich in fine aerosol (predominantly 
PM1 and PM2.5), sulphate (on average ∼90% of the PM mass) and various trace species, including heavy 
metals. The fine size of the volcanic PM mass (75–80% in PM2.5), and the high environmental lability 
of its chemical components have potential adverse implications for environmental and health impacts. 
However, only the dispersion of volcanic SO2 was forecast in public warnings and operationally monitored 
during the eruption. We make a recommendation that sulphur gas-to-aerosol conversion processes, and 
a sufficiently large model domain to contain the transport of a tropospheric plume on the timescale of 
days be utilized for public health and environmental impact forecasting in future eruptions in Iceland 
and elsewhere in the world.

release of gases and aerosol into the troposphere and lower strato-
sphere. This can impact air quality, terrestrial and aquatic envi-
ronments, climate and health (Robock, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2011;
Thordarson and Self, 2003; Witham et al., 2015). Icelandic large 
fissure eruptions were included in the UK National Risk Register 
in 2012 as one of the highest priority risks, due to the significant 
societal consequences caused by the Laki eruption 1783–1784 CE 
(15 km3 lava, estimated 120 Tg SO2, Thordarson and Self, 2003) 
across the northern hemisphere. During the Laki eruption, a thick 
sulphate aerosol veil and fluoride contamination of pasture and 
drinking water for livestock, led to the loss of ∼20% of Iceland’
s 
population through famine (Thordarson and Self, 2003). It has been 
suggested that mortality in the UK and mainland Europe also in-
creased (Schmidt et al., 2011; Witham and Oppenheimer, 2004). 
Large fissure eruptions are often assumed to be the closest ana-
logues for large igneous province volcanism during the human era 
(e.g., Self et al., 2014) and so understanding them is further impor-
tant in order to gain deeper insights into these massive environ-
mental perturbations that punctuate Earth history. The Holuhraun 
eruption in Iceland in 2014–2015 (Fig. 1) is the largest such event 
since Laki and presents us with a rare opportunity to study vol-
canism of this style and scale using modern scientific techniques.
Tropospheric plumes from eruptions with low-level explosiv-
ity are complex mixtures of magmatic gases, entrained back-
ground air and aerosol particulate matter (PM), and usually low 
quantities of silicate ash. Volcanic plumes are known to contain 
nearly all naturally occurring elements (e.g., Allard et al., 2000;
Symonds et al., 1992) ranging from the common metals (Na, K, Ca, 
Mg) to trace species (e.g., Pb, Mo, As, Se, Hg and Br). The interac-
tions of this range of elements with ecosystems are highly variable 
and deposition of plumes can be either adverse or beneficial for 
terrestrial and aquatic environments (e.g. Cronin and Sharp, 2002;
Jones and Gislason, 2008).
Volcanic gases and PM may also present a health hazard 
through air pollution. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels in particu-
lar often exceed official air quality standards for this gas in 
the ambient air (Gíslason et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2015;
Tam et al., 2016). A large proportion of volcanic PM is in the PM2.5
fraction (sub-2.5 μm diameter), which has become a key metric 
in air pollution guidelines. Short and long term exposure to PM2.5
in the ambient air is estimated to cause over 3 million prema-
ture deaths globally per year (Lim et al., 2012), and it remains the 
single largest environmental health risk in Europe (Holgate, 2017). 
Detailed information on SO2 and PM size-resolved mass flux, and 
gas and PM composition, is therefore necessary for reliable assess-
ments of the effect of volcanic emissions on the environment and 
health.
The Holuhraun eruption occurred in the central highlands of 
Iceland (Fig. 1), on the ice-free part of Bárðarbunga volcanic sys-
tem and lasted 6 months from 31 August 2014 to 28 February 
2015. The estimates of its total SO2 emission range between 11 Tg 
(Gíslason et al., 2015) and 19 Tg (Gauthier et al., 2016), 1.5–2 times 
more than the total anthropogenic SO2 emissions from the Eu-
ropean Economic Area in 2011 (European Environmental Agency, 
2017). Daily SO2 gas fluxes averaged 60 kt/day (Gíslason et al., 
2015), a rate of outgassing rarely observed during sustained erup-
tions. It dwarfed most other long-term volcanic SO2 emitters, such 
as Kilauea volcano in Hawaii (2–8 kt/d, Elias and Sutton, 2012) 
and Mt Etna, Italy (3.5 kt/d between 2005 and 2008, Salerno et 
al., 2009). It was one of the largest global tropospheric volcanic 
emissions since Laki, rivalled only by emission from Miyakejima 
2000–2003 (∼18 Mt SO2, Kazahaya et al., 2004). This caused fre-
quent and persistent deterioration of air quality in Iceland with 
regard to SO2 (Gíslason et al., 2015), and an impact on the chem-
istry of snow and rain precipitation around Iceland (Galeczka et 
al., 2016; Gíslason et al., 2015; Stefánsson et al., 2017). Long-
range periodic impacts on air quality were reported in the UK, 
Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands and Austria (Gíslason et al., 2015;
Schmidt et al., 2015; Twigg et al., 2016).
Our study quantifies the impact of Holuhraun on populated ar-
eas in Iceland. Specifically we trace the evolution of the plume 
chemistry from the eruption site to 2 key areas of population: 
Reykjahlíð, which is the nearest municipality to Holuhraun at 
100 km distance, and Reykjavík capital area, which hosts ∼60% 
of Iceland’
s population, 250 km distance (Fig. 1). We present a 
novel dataset of gas and size-resolved aerosol chemistry, including 
a time series of constituents relevant for air quality assessment, 
i.e., SO2, PM2.5 and sulphate aerosol, and analysis of trace species 
including heavy metals. The findings of this study are relevant 
for multiple other countries impacted by volcanic emissions, ei-
ther through prolonged eruptions, for example that of Kilauea in 
Hawaii, or through persistent quiescent degassing, such as from 
Masaya in Nicaragua.

snow cover on the ground and −10 ◦C. The eruptive activity was 
exclusively effusive at the time, with lava issuing from the main 
vent Baugur and flowing towards N–NE (Fig. 1b). Due to the low 
wind speed (≤5 m/s) and high thermal flux of the eruption the 
plume grounded only periodically. We collected direct samples of 
the plume using filter packs (section 2.2) and cascade impactors 
(section 2.3), both on the ground in a dilute plume and in the 
highly concentrated airborne plume with the assistance of an Ice-
land coast guard helicopter (Table 1). We collected a repeat sam-
ple from a helicopter two months after the eruption finished to 
eliminate the possibility that the helicopter could be a source of 
detectable contamination.
2.1.2. Reykjahlíð town (100 km downwind)
Reykjahlíð is a rural town with ∼300 inhabitants, located in-
land in north Iceland. It is the closest municipality to Holuhraun. 
Continuous automated monitoring of SO2 gas concentrations was 
operated by the Environment Agency of Iceland (EAI) both before 
and during the eruption (section 2.5). We obtained additional mea-
surements during a field campaign 20–24 January 2015. Reykjahlíð 
was selected as the downwind location for the field campaign 
based on the plume-dispersion forecast issued by the Icelandic 
Meteorological Office (IMO). The plume was present at this loca-
tion for most of the field campaign, as shown by the forecast and 
later supported by our data. Direct sampling of gas and aerosol 
(sections 2.2 and 2.3) and an optical particle counter (sections 2.4) 
were set up outside a local school, within ∼100 m from the auto-
mated SO2 monitoring station.
2.1.3. Reykjavík capital area (250 km downwind)
Reykjavík capital area is located in south-west Iceland and has 
∼200,000 inhabitants, which is 60% of Iceland’
s total population. It 
is a coastal city where non-volcanic air pollution is sourced mostly 
from anthropogenic activities (including one aluminium smelter) 
and sea-spray. Continuous automated monitoring of SO2 and PM2.5
was done both before and during the eruption at Hvaleyrarholt 
EAI station (section 2.5). Sulphate was analysed on filter samples 
collected daily at the same station (section 2.6).
2.2. Filter packs
Filter packs were used to collect simultaneous samples of gas 
and PM. We followed the technique described by (Allen et al., 
2000). The filter packs comprised one PM filter followed by 2–4 
base-treated gas filters in an all-Teflon three-stage cartridge. The 
PM filter (Millipore, 47 mm, AAWP, pore size 0.8 μm) collects all 
particle size bins in bulk. The filters for gas sampling were What-
man 41 mm ashless circles impregnated with 5% K2CO3 and 1% 
glycerol in distilled deionized (DI) water, following the prepara-
tion technique described in Martin et al. (2010) and Pfeffer et al.
(2013). This base treatment captures acidic gases (e.g., SO2, HF and 
HCl) on the filters. Blank filters were transported into the field and 
transferred to the sample bags in the same way as the sampling 
filters. This ensured that there was no unaccounted contamination 
due to transport and handling of the filters in the field. Airflow 
through the filter pack was generated using external pumps. Af-
ter sampling, the filter pack was closed by a plastic lid to prevent 
particle loss and contamination. Once indoors, filters were then 
transferred into individual polypropylene bags (2 layers).
A three-stage sequential leaching scheme was employed to as-
sess the solubility of metals in the PM, following the procedure 
used in Mather et al. (2012). In summary: (i) The first stage 
extracted the environmentally labile fraction by using ultraclean 
water for the leaching. (ii) The second stage leached moderately 
environmentally-labile material by adding a weak acid, hydroxy-
lamine hydrochloride in 25% acetic acid to the residues from step 1. 
(iii) The third stage extracted the environmental immobile fraction 
of the PM (bound to silicates) by using HF. Following extraction, all 
samples were analysed for metals using an ICP-MS. Anions (Cl−, F−
and SO2−
4 ) were analysed in the extracts from the first extraction 
stage only (water-soluble fraction) using ion chromatography (IC). 
The base-treated gas filters were analysed using IC only. All analy-
sis was performed at the British Geological Survey laboratories in 
Keyworth, UK.
2.3. Aerosol cascade impactors
Cascade impactors allow size-segregated sampling of PM and 
have been used in multiple studies of volcanic aerosol (e.g., 
Ilyinskaya et al., 2012, 2010; Martin et al., 2011, 2010). A cascade

impactor consists of a series of stages with nozzles of decreasing 
diameter. An external pump attached to the impactor outlet creates 
an airflow through the stages. Beneath each stage is an impaction 
plate (where a filter is mounted) upon which the air jet impinges 
and where a fraction of the suspended aerosol particles is col-
lected. Larger particles are deposited at the early separation stages 
whereas fine particles are not deposited until they have passed 
through correspondingly narrower nozzles in which the gas flows 
at higher velocities (e.g., Marple et al., 1991). The cut-off particle 
diameter for each impactor stage is conventionally reported as D50
which is the diameter of particles retained with 50% efficiency on 
each stage.
Here we used two types of cascade impactors (Table 1):
1) Micro Orifice Uniform Deposition Impactor (nano-MOUDI, 
model 125NR, MSP corporation), operating at 10 l/min. It resolves 
13 size bins between 18 and 0.01 μm cut-off diameter. PM larger 
than 18 μm is collected on the inlet stage, and PM < 0.01 μm 
on the after-stage. Filters used were PTFE, 47 mm, 0.2 μm pore 
size. The last impaction stage (0.018–0.01 μm) was missing and 
not used during this campaign. This does not affect the PM cut-off 
sizes on the preceding stages.
2) MOUDI (model 130, MPS corporation), operating at 30 l/min. 
It resolves 8 size bins between 18 and 0.18 μm cut-off diame-
ter. PM larger than 18 μm is collected on the inlet stage, and PM 
<0.18 μm on the after-stage. PTFE filters of 47 mm diameter and 
1.0 μm pore size (Whatman 7590-004) were used for the main 
stages and a similar 37 mm filter (Whatman 7590-003) on the 
after-stage.
The filters (including procedural blanks) were handled and 
analysed using the same procedures as in section 2.2.
2.4. Optical particle counter
A GRIMM optical particle counter (model 1.107) was used in 
Reykjahlíð. The GRIMM data provides size segregated data for PM 
mass concentration and 8 particle size bins are resolved in the 
range 0.5 to >15 μm. Particle diameter data are automatically con-
verted to particle volume using mean particle diameter between 
the thresholds of the 31 different channels, assuming spherical 
particles. Volume data are converted to a mass distribution using 
an instrument-specific density factor of 2.8 using standard pro-
tocols developed by GRIMM (Grimm and Eatough, 2009). Factory 
settings were used in this analysis.
2.5. Continuous SO2 and PM monitoring
Gaseous SO2 concentration is routinely monitored around Ice-
land by the EAI air quality stations. Automated SO2 stations both in 
Reykjahlíð and Reykjavík were in operation before the onset of the 
eruption. The SO2 measurements are done by an analyser equipped 
with a pulsed fluorescence spectroscopy meter, recording 10- and 
60-min average concentration. All of the analysers are calibrated at 
6-month intervals. The detection limit is 2 μg m−3 and the uncer-
tainty is 5%.
PM10 and PM2.5 is automatically monitored at 14 stations in 
Iceland. Five of these are in the Reykjavík capital area. There is no 
permanent automated monitoring of PM at Reykjahlíð.
For Reykjavík, we analysed SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 data from 
Hvaleyrarholt station, which is also the only station to monitor 
sulphate through direct sampling (section 2.6). Non-volcanic back-
ground values of SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were calculated based on 
the period from 2 January 2012 to 30 August 2014, an interval 
with no volcanic eruptions. New Year’
s Eve (29 December to 1 Jan-
uary each year) was excluded from all calculations due to notice-
able firework/bonfire pollution with PM2.5 reaching a maximum of 
140 μg/m3 in 2012.
For Reykjahlíð, we analysed SO2 data from the automated sta-
tion. Non-volcanic SO2 background was calculated based on the 
period from 2 January 2014 to 30 August 2014. Non-volcanic PM10
background was calculated from daily filter samples (24 h-average) 
collected in the same municipality between 2000 and 2005 (EAI 
data). We used only samples collected in the month of January 
as the PM mass concentrations fluctuate during the year, with 
highest concentrations during the summer months (May–August 
PM10 7.3 ± 9.3 μg/m3) and lowest during winter time (November–
February PM10 4.1 ± 3.7 μg/m3) when snow cover minimizes re-
suspension of rock dust, and agricultural and other anthropogenic 
activities (e.g. tourism traffic) are reduced. 1 January was excluded 
from the background concentrations due to New Year’
s Eve pollu-
tion of up to 25 μg/m3 PM10. Background PM2.5 is not known but 
is assumed to be lower than Reykjavík (4.1 μg/m3) as this is a rural 
inland area.
2.6. Sulphate monitoring (Reykjavík only)
Aerosol samples were collected using Digitel DHA-80 filter sam-
pler located at Hvaleyrarholt station. The filters used (fibre glass 
and quartz) were not treated to collect gaseous phases. The fil-
ters were changed once every 24 h. After sampling, the filters 
were washed with DI water and peroxide solution and analysed for 
sulphate ion concentration using ion chromatography. The sample 
extraction and analysis were done at the Innovation Centre of Ice-
land. Non-volcanic sulphate background was calculated based on 
the period from 2 January 2014 to 30 August 2014.
3. Results
The chemical composition of the bulk plume (gas and aerosol 
phases) at the three sampling sites is summarised in Fig. 2. Full 
analytical results are in the supplementary material (Table SM and 
Fig. SM1).
3.1. Plume gas phase
The maximum gas concentrations were detected in the near-
vent airborne plume, with 15-min average value of 43,000 μg/m3
SO2, 530 μg/m3 HCl and 210 μg/m3 HF. The average concentra-
tions in the grounding plume 4–20 km from the vent were 3,100 
± 2,900 μg/m3 SO2, 19 ± 2.3 μg/m3 HCl and 11 ± 9.5 μg/m3 HF.
In Reykjahlíð (100 km downwind) the hourly-mean and maxi-
mum concentrations of SO2 gas (26 
± 120 μg/m3, and 1700 μg/m3, 
respectively) during the eruption significantly exceed the pre-
eruption background levels (0.41 ± 0.24 μg/m3, and 2.4 μg/m3, 
respectively), Fig. 3 and Table 2. During 20–24 January 2015, the 
gas composition in the grounding plume was 370 ± 710 μg/m3
SO2, 4.5 ± 4.8 μg/m3 HCl and 1.5 ± 1.8 μg/m3 HF.
Reykjavík data (Fig. 3, 250 km downwind) were analysed as 
a function of the prevalent wind direction, as there is a notice-
able direction-dependent difference in the background concen-
trations of gas and PM (Table 2). Background SO2 was higher 
during westerly winds compared to easterly winds (1.8 ± 1.4 vs 
1.2 ± 0.8 μg/m3, respectively). The most likely sources of these 
pollutants from the west of the sampling location are the open 
sea (sea-spray) and an aluminium smelter. However, during the 
eruption, the increase in average SO2 is greater for the intervals 
of easterly winds than westerly winds, as the eruption site was 
located to the east of Reykjavík. The average and maximum con-
centrations of SO2 during the eruption (3.2 ± 0.8 and 15 μg/m3, 
respectively) significantly exceed the background levels. We con-
sidered the plume to be present in Reykjavík when total sulphur 
in the atmosphere (Stotal = Sgas + SPM) during a 24 h interval ex-
ceeded the maximum Stotal measured before the eruption onset

(30 μg/m3). Based on this analysis the volcanic plume was present 
in Reykjavík for 38 out of the 181 days of eruption. On those days, 
the average SO2 concentrations were 72 ± 140 μg/m3 (Table 2).
3.2. Plume aerosol phase
The near-vent airborne plume had extremely high mass con-
centrations of PM, with a 15 min average of 25,000 μg/m3. The 
sample collected in the near-vent airborne plume was not size-
resolved, but the size-resolved plume sample collected in the near-
vent grounding plume showed that PM2.5 accounted for 75–83% of 
the total PM. PM2.5 mass in the grounding plume at the eruption 
site was 60 μg/m3 (1 sample, concentration averaged 5 h).
The grounding downwind plume in Reykjahlíð town had an av-
erage PM2.5 concentration of 13 ± 9.5 μg/m3 (70-h average value, 
Fig. 3). In Reykjavík capital area, the average daily PM2.5 concentra-
tion throughout the whole eruption was 5.0 
±4.2 μg/m3, compared 
to 4.1 ± 3.6 before the eruption (Fig. 3). There was no significant 
difference between the daily and hourly averages of PM2.5 concen-
tration. The effect of the wind direction on the concentration of 
PM2.5 was much less significant than on SO2 (Table 2). The average 
sulphate concentration in Reykjavík during the eruption was twice 
as high as the pre-eruptive levels (3.0 ± 2.9 and 1.5 ± 1.1 μg/m3, 
respectively), with some wind field-dependent variations. During 
the 38 days when the plume was present in Reykjavík, SO2−
4
ac-
counted for 90% of the PM2.5 mass on average, with the average 
SO2−
4
concentration of 6.3 ± 3.7 μg/m3 (Table 2).
When interpreting the composition of highly dilute plumes 
sampled at more than a few km from source, such as at Reyk-
jahlíð town, we have to account for a degree of mixing between 
the volcanic emissions and background air. In order to assess the 
extent of background air dilution of the Holuhraun plume at differ-
ent sampling locations, we compare the sulphur to chlorine (S/Cl) 
molar ratio in volcanic PM with that of non-volcanic background 
PM, see supplementary material Fig. SM2. The PM collected near 
the emission source is concluded to have a predominantly vol-
canic chemical signature based on its S/Cl molar ratio (0.1–200, vs 
0.05 in the background). The PM sampled in a more dilute plume 
100 km downwind (Reykjahlíð) shows a higher degree of mixing 
with background PM (S/Cl 0.06–0.85), as is expected.
Different size fractions of the sampled PM appear to have dif-
ferent sources, volcanic and non-volcanic. The near-vent PM is of 
volcanic origin in all of the resolved size fractions (0.1 to >18 μm 
diameter), as shown by source appointment analysis described in 
Fig. SM2. The sample collected 100 km from eruption site (in 
Reykjahlíð) shows that PM < 1.8 μm has a predominantly vol-
canic composition, while PM 1.8–5.6 μm is mostly non-volcanic, 
although some degree of plume contribution cannot be excluded. 
PM ≥ 10 μm diameter shows a high degree of mixing between the 
two sources. This suggest that there is important surface controlled 
growth of the SO2−
4
particles at relatively low supersaturation dur-
ing long-range (≥100 km) transport (Fig. SM2). Fig. 4 summarises 
the size-resolved chemistry of the aerosol phase, and its attributed

4. Discussion
4.1. Plume composition
The gas phase mass ratios measured at the eruption site, 
HCl/SO2 (0.026 ± 0.05) and HF/SO2 (0.013 ± 0.02), are in good 
agreement with values (0.024 ± 0.07 and 0.011 ± 0.03, respec-
tively) measured by Stefánsson et al. (2017), who also sampled 
the near-vent plume using filter packs. The standard deviation 
of gas concentrations between individual samples was generally 
high (Fig. 2), showing that the grounding plume varied signifi-
cantly in its gas phase concentration over short time scales. It 
is possible that the sampled gas was sourced partially from the 
degassing lava flows which generally has higher halogen/sulphur 
ratios (Thordarson et al., 1996), in addition to the gas from the 
main vent.
On average, the concentrations of the gas species decreased 
by ∼1–2 orders of magnitude between the airborne plume and 
the grounding plume near the eruption site. The gas concentra-
tions decreased by ∼1 order of magnitude between sampling in 
the grounding plume near the eruption site and in Reykjahlíð at 
100 km distance (Fig. 2).
By sampling the Holuhraun plume at varying distances from 
the eruptive vent we are able to show how sulphur in the vol-
canic plume fractionates between gas and aerosol phases over 
time. The concentration of the volcanogenic plume components 
decreases with time due to more extensive mixing and dilution by 
background air as the plume ages. The decrease in total S concen-
tration (Stotal = Sgas + SPM) in the plume and the ensuing change 
in SPM/Sgas ratio is used here as a proxy for an increasing plume 
age. Fig. 5 shows that SPM/Sgas ratio is markedly higher when the 
plume is more dilute (i.e. older), with a strong negative correlation 
of ρ = −0.81. This is consistent with sulphur undergoing gas-to-
particle conversion in the Holuhraun plume, reaching a SPM/Sgas
ratio of 0.62 in a sample taken at 100 km distance from the vent 
in Reykjahlíð 23–24 January 2015 (range of values 0.006–0.62), 
and up to 0.38 in Reykjavík at 250 km distance (range of values 
0.016–0.38).
The relative abundance of sulphur and chlorine differs signifi-
cantly between the gas and aerosol phases in the plume sampled 
shortly after its emission (Fig. 2). On average, the concentration 
of gaseous SO2 exceeds HCl by a factor of 40. However, in the 
aerosol phase sulphur is less abundant than chlorine. It is known 
that SPM/ClPM is controlled not just by the magmatic gas composi-
tion but also by the atmospheric conditions. Our previous work 
(Ilyinskaya et al., 2012) showed that on emission chloride con-
denses into the aerosol phase much more readily when the am-
bient temperature is low (<0 ◦C), while near-vent sulphate forma-
tion is unaffected, thereby lowering the SPM/ClPM. This is appli-
cable to the Holuhraun eruption as air temperatures were −5 ◦C 
to −10 ◦C at the time of sampling. Some mixing with background 
aerosol, which has a lower SPM/ClPM ratio (0.05, Bruland, 1983) 
compared to the volcanic aerosol (0.37 ± 0.30, this study), is also 
occurring, as shown in the supplementary material (Fig. SM2).

Fig. 4. a) Size-resolved distribution of chemical species (elements and ions) sampled 
in a near-vent plume (∼5 km from source), and in a dilute downwind plume in 
Reykjahlíð (∼100 km from source). The downwind aerosol contains particles from 
two distinct sources, volcanic and background, with different sources dominating 
different size bins. The figure also shows definitions of aerosol sizes used in air 
pollution and health impact literature, PM1 (diameter <1.0 μm), PM2.5 (<2.5 μm) 
and PM10 (<10 μm). b) Comparison of PM size distributions in the volcanic plume 
and non-volcanic background air, based on measurements in Reykjahlíð. The y-axis 
shows the total mass in each size bin sampled during a continuous measurement 
21–24 January 2015.
Fig. 5. Relationship between the plume concentration (Stotal = Sgas + SPM) and 
the SPM/Sgas ratio. The plume concentration is a proxy for plume age. The data 
points are from the eruption site (6 samples), Reykjahlíð (4 samples), and Reyk-
javik (35 samples from days when the plume was present, and had SPM/Sgas > 0).
There are also differences in the size distribution of volcanic 
and background aerosol (Fig. 4b), as identified by the high time-
resolution measurements from Reykjahlíð 21–24 January 2015. The 
plume was interpreted to be present during time intervals where 
PMtotal mass exceeded 10 μg/m3. This is justified for this relatively 
short sampling interval during the time of year when non-volcanic 
aerosol is very low in this inland part of Iceland (background 
aerosol data presented in section 2.5), although this may not hold 
true for coastal areas which receive increased aerosol of marine 
origin during winter months (Gislason et al., 1996). Fig. 4 shows 
that the size distributions of PM mass concentration during plume 
presence is markedly different from the background. Within the 
plume the particles in the smallest aerosol size bins (∼0.5–3.2 μm 
diameter) are greatly enhanced compared to background. Further-
more, a coarse mode (>7.5 μm diameter) is present in the plume 
and not in the background aerosol.
This shows that the finest and the coarsest PM size fractions 
(<1.8 and ≥10 μm diameter) are predominantly volcanic. This is 
in good agreement with measurements of volcanic plumes from 
non-explosive activity elsewhere, in particular in locations charac-
terised by sub-zero temperatures such as Erebus volcano in Antarc-
tica (Ilyinskaya et al., 2010) and Fimmvörðuháls fissure eruption in 
Iceland (Ilyinskaya et al., 2012), where the dominant aerosol mode 
in a plume within a few minutes of emission is ∼0.2 μm in diame-
ter. Plumes of similar age that are emitted into a warmer and more 
humid atmosphere have a dominant aerosol mode of ∼0.5–1.0 μm 
diameter, e.g. at Masaya in Nicaragua (Martin et al., 2011), Kilu-
aea in Hawaii (Mather et al., 2012), and various volcanoes in Italy 
(Martin et al., 2008; Mather et al., 2004).
Exposure standards are not established for most trace chemi-
cals in airborne aerosol, although several trace species (V, Cr, Mn, 
Ni, As, Cd, Pb) have been tentatively linked to negative health im-
pacts e.g. Chen and Lippmann (2009). Daily-mean concentrations 
for these trace species determined from samples collected in Reyk-
jahlíð town over 4 consecutive days are shown in Fig. 6b. The 
species generally show little variation in concentration during the 
sampling period.
We assessed the environmental lability of the different species 
in the aerosol phase by a sequential leaching method. Fig. 6 shows 
the solubility of aerosol trace species. The figure also shows the 
enrichment factors (Mg-based EF, depicted by white circles on 
Fig. 6a) calculated based on the relative abundance of each el-
ement in the plume and in the magma, see e.g., Mather et al.
(2012). Elements with EF>10 are considered as volatile. The ma-
jority of the measured trace species were soluble in water or weak 
acid. The exception were the lanthanides, which were all poorly 
soluble, and also showed a generally low volatility. These results 
imply a high environmental mobility of trace metals deposited 
as aerosol from the Holuhraun plume, with near-immediate dis-
solution. Poorly soluble compounds, such as the lanthanides, also 
dissolve but over a longer timescale (Oelkers and Gislason, 2001).
4.2. Impact on air quality
Time series of major volcanogenic air pollutants, SO2 gas, PM2.5
and sulphate (SO2−
4 ) aerosol were collected in two populated ar-
eas, Reykjahlíð town and Reykjavík capital area. PM10 data are also 
available but we will focus our analysis on PM2.5 which is the 
dominant size bin for volcanic aerosol as discussed in section 4.1. 
PM2.5 is also a highly relevant factor impacting on human health, 
morbidity and mortality (Holgate, 2017).
4.2.1. Reykjavík capital area
During the course of the eruption, the European Commission 
(EC) air quality standards (EC Environment, 2016) for SO2 expo-
sure were exceeded 34 times for hourly limits (350 μg/m3 hourly 
average) and 7 times for daily limits (125 μg/m3 24 h average), 
which also surpasses the number of permitted daily exceedances 
per year (max. 3 days). In the pre-eruption interval 2012–2014, 
SO2 limits were never exceeded (Table 2).
Volcanogenic PM2.5 mass concentrations in Reykjavík did not 
exceed the 24 hour-mean standard (25 μg/m3) set by the World 
Health Organisation (WHO). The peak in PM2.5 on 15 February 
2015 (Fig. 7) is considered to be of a non-volcanic origin because

mature plume (23–24 Jan. 2015).

it is not associated with an increase in sulphate and occurred af-
ter the eruption intensity had critically waned. The origin of this 
peak has not as yet been explained. It does not appear to be linked 
to a particular meteorological event (IMO, personal communica-
tion, February 2017). Potential explanations include nearby road 
or building works. The average hourly PM2.5 concentration dur-
ing the eruption (4.8–4.9 μg/m3) was elevated above pre-eruption 
background levels by 20% (Table 3). This is low compared to the 
percentage increase in SO2 and sulphate aerosol (with increasing 
variation depending on wind direction, but approximately 2800% 
and 170%, respectively). However, if we consider only the days 
when the plume was present in Reykjavík (n = 38, see section 3.1
for definition) the average hourly value of PM2.5 is 7.5 μg/m3, 
which is 47% higher than the pre-eruption background.
The maximum hourly PM2.5 concentration during the eruption 
period (91 μg/m3) was detected on one of the ‘
plume-present’
 days

(16 October 2014). But this PM2.5 peak was lower than several 
peak concentrations during the non-eruptive period 2012–2014 
(max 160 μg/m3 per hour, Table 2).
However, emissions from the eruption caused a significant 
change in the chemical composition of the aerosol, with a large 
increase in sulphate mass, both in hourly-mean (∼170%) and peak 
concentrations (∼300%), Table 2. Unlike SO2, air quality standards 
for sulphate are not available, and any definitions of sulphate 
‘
pollution events’
 are somewhat arbitrary. In this discussion we 
set the limit at 5 μg/m3, based on the suggestion of Lioy and 
Waldman (1989) in a review of anthropogenic pollution in ma-
jor cities 1930s–1980s. Longo et al. (2005) used the same refer-
ence for identifying volcanic pollution zones around Kilauea vol-
cano in Hawaii. Compared to the background aerosol in Reyk-
javík, 5 μg/m3 is significantly higher than the background mean 
(1.5 μg/m3, Table 2). During the 38 days when the plume was 
present in Reykjavík, SO2−
4
accounted for 90% of the PM2.5 mass 
on average; and 30 out of the 38 days experienced SO2−
4
con-
centrations ≥5 μg/m3 (compared to a total of 8 days during the 
pre-eruption period 2012–2014). The maximum SO2−
4
daily aver-
age concentration (15 μg/m3) was detected on 20 September 2014.
On multiple occasions throughout the eruption, PM2.5 and sul-
phate mass concentration increased in Reykjavík without a corre-
sponding increase in SO2 mass concentration. For instance, there 
were at least 23 days when SO2−
4
exceeded 5 μg/m3 but SO2 stayed 
within the EC standards (<125 μg/m3). One of the best examples is 
20 September 2014 (Fig. 7a). Based on the results from dispersion 
modelling presented in Schmidt et al. (2015), we show here (Fig. 8) 
that these events were caused by an arrival in Reykjavík capital 
area of a plume with a low Sgas/SPM, where sulphur has near-
complete gas-to-aerosol conversion. A plume with a low Sgas/SPM
ratio is considered mature with respect to sulphur chemistry. On 
occasions, the ‘
same’
 plume inundated the same area twice, first 
as a primitive high Sgas/SPM plume and then several days later as 
a mature, low Sgas/SPM, plume.
Importantly, the mature, low Sgas/SPM plume was not fore-
cast as part of volcanic pollution monitoring during Holuhraun. 
Daily forecasts of the plume dispersion issued by the IMO ac-
counted only for SO2 concentrations in a primitive high Sgas/SPM
plume. For example, the forecast for 20 September 2014 predicted 
good air quality (‘
no plume’
) in Reykjavík (http

show that PM2.5 exceeded the recommended levels, and sulphate 
was �5 μg/m3 (Figs. 7a and 8b). Furthermore, results from dis-
persion modelling by (Schmidt et al., 2015) show an example of 
a ‘
near-miss’
 event (Fig. 8c), where a mature plume with concen-
trations of sulphate of 50–100 μg/m3, narrowly passed the densely 
populated south-east coast of Iceland. Based on these findings, we 
recommend that mature plumes are included in air pollution fore-
casting during future eruptions.
4.2.2. Reykjahlíð town
The peak SO2 concentrations and the frequency of air quality 
exceedance (hourly and daily means) were higher in Reykjahlíð 
(88 hours/10 days) than Reykjavík (34 hours/7 days, Table 3), as 
Reykjahlíð was located much closer to the eruption site.
The PM2.5 and sulphate time series are not as long-term in 
Reykjahlíð compared to Reykjavík. The data are nevertheless very 
important as they are a high resolution record of how the plume 
was fluctuating in intensity and composition at that location. The 
average and maximum hourly concentrations of both PM2.5 and 
sulphate were 13 ± 9.5 and 11 ± 10 μg/m3, respectively, which we 
consider to be significantly elevated above background (4 μg/m3
and 1.5 μg/m3, respectively, in Reykjavík but likely to be lower in 
Reykjahlíð as discussed in section 2.5). Daily-mean sulphate con-
centrations exceeded 5 μg/m3 on 3 out of the 4 days of sampling 
(Fig. 7b).
In Reykjahlíð we made the same observation as in Reykjavík 
that the peaks in SO2 and PM2.5 were not always synchronous. The 
Reykjahlíð time line (Fig. 7b) shows two types of events: 1) SO2
and PM2.5 peak simultaneously at ∼5AM on 22 January 2015; 
and 2) PM2.5 increases without a corresponding peak in SO2 from 
∼11AM on 23 January 2015. The source of the increase in PM2.5
on 23 January is interpreted to be volcanic because sulphate is also 
elevated during the same time interval. This shows that there were 
episodes of a mature, low Sgas/SPM plume arriving in Reykjahlíð in 
the same way as was described in section 4.2.1 for Reykjavík capi-
tal area.
The concentrations of trace metals, including species that have 
been linked to negative health impacts, were similar when sam-
pled in a primitive, high Sgas/SPM plume and a mature, low 
Sgas/SPM plume in Reykjahlíð (Fig. 6b). This suggests that mature 
Holuhraun plumes did not lose significant amounts of the metal-
bearing aerosol, and were as potentially polluting as a more prim-
itive plume with respect to these trace metals.
4.2.3. Implications for health impacts
Evidence suggests that the spread of tropospheric volcanogenic 
air pollutants during the Holuhraun eruption was reportedly the 
most extensive since the Laki eruption 1783–1784 CE. Holuhraun 
caused deterioration of air quality in populated areas >1000 km 
from source in Europe (Gíslason et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2015;
Twigg et al., 2016). For comparison of impact intensity, SO2 con-
centrations during an intense degassing period in 2008–2009 of 
Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, never exceed the guidelines in the popu-
lated area of Kona in 80 km distance from the emission source. 
SO2 guidelines have only been reported to have been exceeded 
within ∼30 km radius (Hawaii State Department of Health, Clean 
Air Branch, 2010).
While most studies on the relationship between volcanogenic 
pollution and health agree that the impacts are generally nega-
tive (e.g., Baxter et al., 1982, 1990; Longo et al., 2008; Tam et 
al., 2016), there is no good consensus on the exact cause, or the 
mechanisms involved. The published air quality exposure limits 
for pure SO2 are designed based on laboratory studies in volun-
teers with non-severe asthma (US EPA National Center for Envi-
ronmental Assessment, R.T.P.N., 2008). This has shown that asthma 
sufferers are particularly sensitive to low levels of SO2, with symp-
toms including the rapid onset of constriction of the airways as 
is seen in asthma attacks. Air quality limits are set to protect this 
most vulnerable group. The evidence is weak on the long-term ef-
fects of repeated exposure to episodes of SO2 pollution over time, 
such as occurs during prolonged eruptions. EC air quality stan-
dards are also not available for HCl or HF gas for periods over 
8 h.
The health impacts of sulphate aerosol exposure in air pollu-
tion are much less understood. A major WHO review (WHO, 2013)
concluded that there was no new toxicological evidence to sup-
port a causal role for inorganic sulphate in the health effects of 
PM2.5, in accord with the comprehensive review on the subject 
by Schlesinger and Cassee (2003). However, epidemiological stud-
ies continue to report associations between sulphates and adverse 
impacts on human health. Postulated explanations include the pos-
sibility that sulphate is simply a marker for the causal agents in 
PM2.5; or that toxic species may be formed in its chemical re-
actions with trace metals and the transition metals released in 
combustion processes. Sulphate has been reported to increase the 
solubility of iron in particles (Oakes et al., 2012), while metals may 
catalyse the production of sulphuric acid which in turn might re-
act to produce toxicologically active soluble metal salts. The exact 
toxic mechanisms by which metals act are unknown, but free rad-

Fig. 8. Dispersion model of hourly-mean sulphur dioxide (SO2, left) and sulphate aerosol (SO42−, right) surface mass concentrations (μg/m3) for selected days in September 
2014, based on Schmidt et al. (2015) (full animation 31 Aug. 2014–28 Sept. 2014 in supplementary material SM3). Panels (a) and (b) show a mature low Sgas/SPM plume 
reaching the Reykjavik capital area on 14 and 20 September 2014 (right), whereas SO2 mass concentrations are very low in the same location on those days (left) Panel (c) 
shows a ‘
near-miss’
 situation with a highly sulphate-rich mature plume narrowly passing the densely populated southeast coast of Iceland on 8 September 2014.
ical generation has been proposed by many e.g., Kelly and Fussell
(2015). Lippmann (2014) has also argued that sulphate represents 
the end stage of a chain of reactions in the aerosol that produces 
toxicologically active species, and that the hydrogen ion (acidity) 
is a key factor (he also stresses the potential importance of cop-
per, nickel and vanadium, but the causal evidence for these and 
for other metals remains limited).
Volcanic plumes, as shown in this work and previous studies, 
are complex mixtures of gases and PM, some of which may be 
bio-reactive at low concentrations and add to the toxicity of the 
plume. The health impact of these, when combined in the ambient 
air, might be greater than expected from their individual proper-
ties, but this has not been studied – the possibility of gases and 
fine particles synergistically enhancing the toxicity of SO2 in vol-
canic plumes cannot be ruled out.
The dispersion of a primitive plume with high Sgas/SPM ratio 
was operationally forecast during Holuhraun eruption. Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the public heeded the forecasts and lim-
ited the time spent outdoors when the plume was forecast to be 
present (EAI and Icelandic Directorate of Health, pers comm, Jan-

uary 2015). However, our results show, that on at least 18 days 
during the eruption the low Sgas/SPM, mature plume was present in 
Reykjavík, while the forecast showed ‘
no plume’
. There is evidence 
to suggest that those days were noticed by local residents as hav-
ing bad air quality. For example, on 20 September 2014 when sul-
phate concentrations in Reykjavik reached 15 μg/m3, but SO2 was 
below exposure guidelines it was noted locally that: “This day was 
very remarkable, eyes and throat were burning but SO2...reached only
80 μg/m3. Later during the eruption when SO2 exceeded 1000 μg/m3
[in the same location] eyes were not burning as much as on September 
20” (EAI, pers comm, August 2016).
Studies on the health impacts of the Holuhraun emissions 
should incorporate in their exposure assessments of at risk pop-
ulations our findings on the variable concentrations of the SO2
and sulphate aerosol, e.g., comparing the health impacts of plumes 
with a high Sgas/SPM ratio (‘
primitive plume’
) and the low Sgas/SPM
ratio (‘
mature plume’
).
5. Conclusions
Holuhraun was the largest (1.6 km3) and longest (6 months) 
volcanic eruption in Europe since the Laki eruption in late 18th 
century. The gas-and-aerosol rich plume of Holuhraun reached 
populated areas of Iceland up to at least 250 km distance. Our 
measurements showed that both the airborne plume, and the 
plume sampled at ground level contained enhanced concentrations 
of major (e.g. SO2, sulphate), and trace species (e.g. heavy metals), 
which on many occasions, were elevated above background levels 
by several orders of magnitude. The majority of these species were 
soluble in water or weak acid, implying high environmental mobil-
ity. We conclude that Holuhraun eruption caused a change in the 
average chemical composition of the atmospheric aerosol that was 
detectable at least as far as the downwind location of the Reykjavík 
capital area (250 km), in particular during the first two months of 
the eruption. The volcanic aerosol size was predominantly in the 
fine (PM2.5) size fraction with a significant portion in the ultrafine 
fraction (PM1).
There were two types of volcanic plume detected in the pop-
ulated areas that impacted air quality in different ways. The first 
type, a ‘
primitive’
, plume had high concentrations of both SO2 and 
sulphate, with a high Sgas/SPM ratio. The second type, a ‘
mature’
 
plume had a low Sgas/SPM ratio, where sulphur had undergone 
significant gas-to-aerosol conversion. In the Reykjavík capital area 
(250 km downwind), there were at least 23 days when SO2−
4
ex-
ceeded 5 μg/m3, a concentration which previous studies have con-
sidered to constitute a pollution event (Lioy and Waldman, 1989;
Longo et al., 2008) but SO2 stayed within the EC air quality stan-
dards (<125 μg/m3). This was caused by an arrival of a mature 
plume. Dispersion modelling of the volcanogenic pollutants shows 
that there were also near-miss events where a highly sulphate-
rich mature plume narrowly passed the populated areas of Iceland 
without impacting upon air quality.
Both plume types had similar concentrations of trace metals 
(as measured in Reykjahlíð town 100 km downwind), including 
species that have been linked to negative health effects of air pol-
lution from anthropogenic sources. The conclusion is that both 
primitive and mature plumes have the potential to be a source 
of environmental and air pollution, and in future major eruptions 
in Iceland both types warrant further investigation as undertaken 
in this study.
An innovation in Holuhraun eruption was real-time plume 
modelling in Iceland which enabled the path of the primitive 
plume to be forecast in advance, and warnings issued to the pop-
ulation. We recommend that in any future large fissure eruptions 
consideration be given to extending the forecasting of air pollution 
events to include the low Sgas/SPM, mature plumes, and careful as-
sessment given to their possible wider dispersion.
As well as guiding in terms of future hazard and human health 
impact mitigation, this new understanding of the constituents 
of and chemical processing within the plumes from a large fis-
sure eruptions has relevance in terms scaling up to Laki-scale 
events and the episodes of prolonged fissure activity (large igneous 
province volcanism) that punctuate the geological record.
