Summary
Background Olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has previously shown efficacy in a phase 2 
study when given in capsule formulation to all-comer patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer. We aimed to confirm these findings in patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation using a 
tablet formulation of olaparib.
Methods This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated olaparib 
tablet maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation who 
had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0–1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. 
Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or matching placebo tablets 
using an interactive voice and web response system. Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum 
chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-free interval (6–12 months vs ≥12 months) and treatment 
assignment was masked for patients, those giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers. The primary 
endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing 
study. The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses included patients who 
received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874353, and 
is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients.
Findings Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to 
receive olaparib (n=196) or placebo (n=99). One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not 
receive study treatment. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib 
(19·1 months [95% CI 16·3–25·7]) than with placebo (5·5 months [5·2–5·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·30 [95% CI 0·22–0·41], 
p<0·0001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity were anaemia (38 [19%] of 195 patients in the 
olaparib group vs two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group), fatigue or asthenia (eight [4%] vs two [2%]), and 
neutropenia (ten [5%] vs four [4%]). Serious adverse events were experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group 
and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group. The most common in the olaparib group were anaemia (seven [4%] 
patients), abdominal pain (three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] patients). The most common in 
the placebo group were constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction (two [2%] patients). One (1%) patient 
in the olaparib group had a treatment-related adverse event (acute myeloid leukaemia) with an outcome of death.
Interpretation Olaparib tablet maintenance treatment provided a significant progression-free survival improvement 
with no detrimental effect on quality of life in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a 
BRCA1/2 mutation. Apart from anaemia, toxicities with olaparib were low grade and manageable.

Introduction
Patients with advanced ovarian cancer often respond well 
to 
first-line 
chemotherapy, 
with 
the 
subsequent 
chemotherapy-free interval before disease progression 
usually ranging from 4 to 12 months.1–3 After disease 
recurrence, however, this chemotherapy-free interval 
becomes progressively shorter with the successive 
treatments given at each subsequent relapse. A substantial 
unmet need exists for well tolerated therapies that can 
improve long-term disease control in patients with 
recurrent ovarian cancer.
Olaparib is the first-in-class oral poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The inhibition of PARP is 
a potential synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for

treatment of cancers characterised by specific DNA 
repair defects, such as tumour cells that harbour a 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation and are rendered 
deficient in homologous recombination repair.4,5 In 
homologous recombination-deficient tumours, PARP 
inhibition eliminates an alternative DNA repair pathway 
essential for maintaining viability, leading to tumour 
cell death. The estimated prevalence of a BRCA1/2 
mutation in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer is 20–25%, and might be higher 
in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian 
cancer.6–9 Olaparib (capsule formulation) is currently 
approved in the European Union and other countries as 
maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-
sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a germline or 
somatic BRCA1/2 mutation, and in the USA as 
monotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients with 
a germline BRCA1/2 mutation.10,11
Previous studies have indicated the effectiveness of 
olaparib in the setting of platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-
grade serous ovarian cancer. Study 19 (NCT00753545) was a 
randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of olaparib capsules 
given as maintenance monotherapy to 265 patients, which 
showed a significant improvement in progression-free 
survival compared with placebo in the total study population 
(hazard ratio [HR] 0·35, 95% CI 0·25–0·49; p<0·001).12 
A preplanned retrospective analysis of patients in Study 19 
by BRCA status suggested that those with a BRCA1/2 
mutation derived the greatest progression-free survival 
benefit from olaparib treatment (HR 0·18, 95% CI 
0·10–0·31; p<0·0001).2,12 Study 19 also showed the long-
term benefit and tolerability profile of olaparib in the 
maintenance setting.13
Our trial was designed to prospectively confirm the 
findings seen in Study 19 in a similar disease setting: it 
is an international, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 
trial to evaluate olaparib maintenance treatment in 
patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian 
cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutati 
on. We used a tablet 
formulation of olaparib that offers patients a reduced 
daily pill burden compared with capsules. An adaptive-
design phase 1 trial of olaparib bioavailability (Study 24; 
NCT00777582)14 has previously established that olaparib 
exposure with a 300 mg twice-daily tablet dose was 
similar to, or higher than, exposure in patients receiving 
olaparib 400 mg twice-daily capsule. These findings14 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and the databases of the American Society 
of Clinical Oncology, European Cancer Organisation, European 
Society of Gynaecological Oncology, European Society for 
Medical Oncology, and Society of Gynaecological Oncology for 
articles and conference abstracts published between Jan 1, 2016, 
and Jan 1, 2017, including the search terms “poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitor” or “PARP inhibitor” and “ovarian cancer”, 
using no language restrictions. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) inhibitors in late clinical development are olaparib, 
niraparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, and veliparib. In a previous 
phase 2 trial (Study 19), patients with platinum-sensitive, 
relapsed ovarian cancer treated with the oral PARP inhibitor 
olaparib as maintenance monotherapy (capsule formulation) 
had significantly longer progression-free survival than those 
treated with placebo, with the greatest progression-free survival 
benefit recorded in patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, we report here the first phase 3 data for the 
new tablet formulation of olaparib as monotherapy, rather 
than the capsule formulation, in patients with ovarian cancer. 
Efficacy data from this SOLO2 trial show a significant 
improvement in median progression-free survival with 
maintenance olaparib compared with placebo, by investigator 
assessment and blinded independent central review, which 
substantially exceeded the progression-free survival benefit 
recorded with olaparib in Study 19. We also recorded a 
significant improvement in time to second progression, and a 
significant and clinically meaningful improvement in times to 
first or second subsequent therapy or death with olaparib 
versus placebo. The new tablet formulation of olaparib 
reduced the pill burden from 16 capsules to four tablets per 
day while maintaining similar or higher exposure, providing 
patients with a simpler, more convenient treatment regimen. 
Maintenance treatment with the olaparib tablet formulation 
was well tolerated, with no new safety signals and 
manageable toxicities. Additionally, we found no significant 
difference in patients’ quality of life with olaparib compared 
with placebo.
Implications of all of the available evidence
The sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival by blinded 
independent central review showed the greatest median 
improvement in progression-free survival observed so far for 
a PARP inhibitor in this clinical setting, and resulted in a 
lower hazard ratio in favour of olaparib than that of the 
investigator-assessed primary endpoint. Both assessments of 
progression-free survival showed a progression-free survival 
benefit with olaparib that substantially exceeded that seen in a 
phase 2 investigation in patients with platinum-sensitive, 
relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation. The SOLO2 
data support use of the olaparib tablet formulation, which was 
shown to have a similar safety profile to that previously seen 
with the approved capsule formulation of olaparib. The reduced 
pill burden might contribute to improved patient compliance. 
Given the few treatment options available for patients with 
platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, the data for 
olaparib as maintenance therapy in SOLO2 are notable: patients 
showed a delay in disease progression while experiencing no 
change in their quality of life. Additional clinical studies using 
the olaparib tablet formulation are ongoing.

Methods
Study design and participants
This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (SOLO2/ENGOT-Ov21) 
was done by the European Network for Gynaecological 
Oncological Trial groups (ENGOT) across 123 sites in 
16 countries (appendix pp 2–5). Eligible patients were 
aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status at baseline 
of 0–1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, 
including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. 
Eligible patients had received at least two previous lines of 
platinum-based chemotherapy and were in objective 
response (either complete response or partial response 
according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1 or CA-125 levels) to 
their most recent regimen. Patients were also required to 
have platinum-sensitive disease (disease progression 
occurring at least 6 months after the last dose of platinum 
therapy was given) following their penultimate line of 
chemotherapy before enrolment.
Patients were required to have a predicted deleterious, 
or suspected deleterious, BRCA1/2 mutation based on 
either blood or tumour testing, and all patients had to 
consent to provide two blood samples for confirmatory 
germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing using the Myriad 
Genetics BRCA test (Myriad BRACAnalysis; Myriad 
Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Patients with a 
known BRCA1/2 mutation before randomisation could 
enter the trial on the basis of this information; patients 
with unknown BRCA1/2 mutation status were screened 
before randomisation. Patients were required to have 
normal organ and bone marrow function measured 
within 28 days of randomisation. Patients were 
ineligible if they had received previous treatment with a 
PARP inhibitor, had received any systemic chemo-
therapy or radiotherapy (unless palliative) within 
3 weeks prior to study treatment, or had drainage of 
their ascites during the final two cycles of their last 
chemotherapy regimen before enrolment. Patients with 
symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or another 
malignancy within the past 5 years were also ineligible 
(see appendix p 7 for exceptions), as were patients with 
myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia, 
immunocompromised patients, and those with active 
hepatitis B or C infection. Full eligibility criteria are 
provided in the appendix (pp 6–8). All patients provided 
written, informed consent. This study was done in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines.15 The latest protocol is 
available in the appendix.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible patients were randomised (2:1) to receive olaparib 
tablet maintenance monotherapy or matching placebo. 
The randomisation scheme was produced by a computer 
software program that generates random numbers (Global 
Randomisation System) and was loaded into an interactive 
voice and web response system database. Investigators (or 
nominated assistants) contacted the interactive voice and 
web response system centralised randomisation centre for 
allocation of randomised therapy. Randomisation was 
completed within 8 weeks of the patients’ last dose of 
chemotherapy, and was stratified by response to previous 
chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-
free interval (6–12 months vs ≥12 months). Treatment 
masking was achieved using individual treatment codes 
assigned by the interactive voice and web response system. 
Treatment assignment was masked for patients, those 
giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers. 
Olaparib and placebo tablets were manufactured by 
AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, UK), looked identical, and 
were presented in the same packaging. Unmasking was 
only permitted in medical emergencies where appropriate 
management of the patient required knowledge of the 
treatment randomisation. 
Procedures 
Patients received either oral olaparib maintenance 
monotherapy (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or 
matching placebo (tablets twice daily) until disease 
progression or until the investigator deemed that a patient 
was no longer benefiting from treatment. If required, 
toxicities could be managed by treatment interruptions 
and dose reductions. Repeat dose interruptions were 
allowed, as needed, for a maximum of 14 days on each 
occasion of National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; 
version 4.0) grade 3–4 toxicity that was considered to be 
treatment-related by the investigator, until complete 
recovery or the toxicity reverted to grade 1 or less. If 
toxicities reoccurred following re-challenge with study 
treatment, and if further dose interruptions were 
considered inadequate for the management of toxicity, 
then a patient could be considered for dose reduction (to 
250 mg twice daily and then, if needed, to 200 mg twice 
daily) or for permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 
After discontinuation of study treatment, the investigator 
was responsible for selecting a patient’s subsequent 
treatment.
Patients were assessed using CT or MRI scans every 
12 weeks until week 72, and then every 24 weeks there-
after until objective disease progression; we also sent 
these scans to a clinical research organisation for blinded 
independent central review. After disease progression, 
patients were followed every 12 weeks for second 
progression and survival. Patient-reported health-related 
quality of life was assessed with the Trial Outcome Index 
(TOI) score, derived from the Functional Assessment of

Cancer Therapy–Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) questionnaire; 
patient-reported health state utility was assessed with 
the EuroQoL five-dimensions five-level questionnaire. 
Questionnaires were collected every 12 weeks for either 
24 months or until the data cutoff for the primary analysis 
(whichever occurred first). Safety was monitored by 
recording adverse events, measuring haematology, 
clinical chemistry, and vital signs, and doing physical 
examinations. Adverse events were graded according to 
NCI CTCAE version 4.0. Safety assessments comprised 
measurements of haematology and clinical chemistry (on 
days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, then every 4 weeks from the next visit 
[visit 7] until week 72, then every 12 weeks thereafter) and 
measurements of vital signs and physical examinations 
(on day 1, then every 4 weeks until week 72, then every 
12 weeks thereafter).
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was investigator assessment of 
progression-free survival, defined as the time from 
randomisation until objective radiological disease pro-
gression or death using modified RECIST version 1.1. 
A sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival was 
done by blinded independent central review. Secondary 
endpoints were time to first subsequent therapy or death; 
time to second subsequent therapy or death; time to 
study treatment discontinuation or death; time to second 
progression (determined by RECIST, serum CA-125 
levels, or symptomatic progression); time to earliest 
progression (by RECIST or CA-125 levels) or death; 
investigator assessment of overall survival; safety and 
tolerability; and health-related quality of life (change 
from baseline in TOI score of FACT-O). Secondary 
endpoints also included efficacy of olaparib according to 
BRCA1/2 gene variants and exposure to olaparib in 
patients in the olaparib group, which will be reported 
elsewhere. We used preplanned subgroup analyses for 
progression-free survival to evaluate the consistency of 
the treatment effect across several prognostic factors 
including previous administration of bevacizumab and 
presence of a Myriad Genetics-confirmed BRCA1/2 
mutation as part of the trial.
Statistical analysis 
We aimed to analyse a higher number of events than 
required for a powered superiority analysis for both 
progression-free survival and time to second progression; 
therefore, the power to show superiority for both endpoints 
was greater than 90%. In total, 192 events of progression or 
death (~65% maturity) were required to provide sufficient 
precision of the estimated HR. We tested progression-free 
survival at a two-sided significance level of 5% and analysed 
it with a log-rank test, using the randomisation stratification 
factors. The sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival 
by blinded in 
dependent central review used the same 
methods and model as for the primary analysis of 
progression-free survival. We analysed time to second 
progression and overall survival at the time of primary 
analysis of progression-free survival, using the same 
methods. At this initial analysis, we would declare statistical 
significance for time to second progression if one-sided 
p<0·0125 and for overall survival if one-sided p<0·0001. We 
used SAS version 9.1.3 for all analyses.
We analysed efficacy data and patient-reported outcomes 
in the intention-to-treat population, which included all 
randomised patients (full analysis set). We analysed safety 
in all patients from the intention-to-treat population who 
received at least one dose of study treatment (safety 
analysis set). Patients were required to have both an 
evaluable score at baseline and at least one evaluable 
follow-up form to be assessable for health-related quality 
of life. We defined an evaluable form as one having at least 
one subscale that could be measured, or a form that was 
not completed because the patient was deemed too heavily 
affected by symptoms of disease. Patients who did not 
fulfil these requirements were deemed as not assessable 
for health-related quality of life.
The statistical analysis plan is available in the 
appendix. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
number NCT01874353 and is closed to new participants. 
Patients are in follow-up for overall survival and the 
trial remains ongoing.

Results
Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, 602 patients 
were assessed for eligibility, of whom 295 were enrolled 
(figure 1). At data cutoff (Sept 19, 2016), 294 (>99%) of 
295 randomised patients had received study treatment 
(one patient was randomised incorrectly to the olaparib 
group and did not receive study treatment), and 83 (43%) 
of 195 patients were receiving ongoing treatment with 
olaparib compared with 13 (13%) of 99 patients 
remaining on placebo. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics seemed to be well balanced between the 
two groups (table 1). 33 (17%) of 196 patients in the 
olaparib group and 20 (20%) of 99 patients in the 
placebo group had received treatment with bevacizumab 
before their final platinum regimen prior to random-
isation in this study. 153 (78%) patients in the olaparib 
group and 83 (84%) patients in the placebo group had a 
BRCA1/2 mutation previously determined by local 
testing and could be enrolled on the basis of this 
information. All patients received a confirmatory BRCA 
test as part of the trial, which confirmed a germline 
BRCA1/2 mutation in 190 (97%) patients in the olaparib 
group and 96 (97%) in the placebo group (table 1). The 
Myriad Genetics BRCA test did not determine a 
BRCA1/2 mutation either to be deleterious or suspected 
deleterious in nine cases (six in the olaparib group and 
three in the placebo group): four of these nine patients 
had variants of unknown signifi 
cance, two patients were 
BRCA1/2 wildtype according to the Myriad Genetics 
BRCA test, and three had a missing confirmatory 
Myriad Genetics BRCA test (because the BRCA1/2 
mutation status of all nine patients had previously been 
determined by local testing before randomisation, they 
were still eligible for inclusion). No patients had a 
confirmed somatic BRCA1/2 mutation. Details of 
treatment duration and dose intensity are provided in 
the appendix (p 9).
We did the efficacy analysis after 187 investigator-
assessed events of disease progression or death 
(63% maturity: 107 [55%] of 196 in the olaparib group vs 
80 [81%] of 99 in the placebo group). The actual number 
of progression-free survival events was five (2·6%) 
fewer than the number detailed in the statistical plan 
(~192 events). The median follow-up for progression-
free survival was 22·1 months (IQR 21·9–27·4) in the 
olaparib group and 22·2 months (8·3–27·5) for placebo. 
Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival 
was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in 
the placebo group (19·1 months [95% CI 16·3–25·7] 
with olaparib vs 5·5 months [5·2–5·8] with placebo; 
HR 0·30 [95% CI 0·22–0·41], p<0·0001; figure 2A). 
According to the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator, 
12-month progression-free survival was 65% (95% CI 
57·8–71·4) in the olaparib group versus 21% (13·3–29·6) 
in the placebo group; 24-month progression-free 
survival was 43% (35·5–50·4) versus 15% (8·6–23·2).

free survival was significantly longer in patients 
receiving olaparib than in those given placebo 
(30·2 months [95% CI 19·8 to not calculable] vs 
5·5 months [4·8–5·6]; figure 2B). A sensitivity analysis 
that adjusted conservatively for informative censoring 
was done to determine the potential effect of informative 
censoring on the results by blinded independent central 
review (appendix p 9).
A prespecified subgroup analysis of progression-free 
survival in 53 patients who had received bevacizumab 
therapy before their final platinum regimen prior to 
randomisation also showed that median progression-free 
survival was longer with olaparib than with placebo 
(17·0 months [95% CI 10·8 to not calculable] with 
olaparib vs 5·1 months [2·9–5·4] with placebo; HR [in 
favour of olaparib] 0·14, 95% CI 0·07–0·28; p<0·0001).

deleterious, BRCA1/2 mutation as part of this trial 
(190 patients in the olaparib group and 96 in the placebo 
group). Again, median progression-free survival was 
significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the 
placebo group (19·3 months [95% CI 16·5–27·3] with 
olaparib vs 5·5 months [5·0–5·8] with placebo; HR [in 
favour of olaparib] 0·33, 95% CI 0·24–0·44; p<0·0001).
The findings for several secondary endpoints also 
showed significantly improved outcomes with olaparib 
compared with placebo. Median time to first subsequent 
therapy (171 events in 295 patients: 92 [47%] in the olaparib 
group vs 79 [80%] in the placebo group; 58% maturity) was 
27·9 months (95% CI 22·6 to not calculable) in the 
olaparib group versus 7·1 months (6·3–8·3) for placebo 
(figure 3A). Median time to second progression 
(119 events: 70 [36%] in the olaparib group vs 49 [50%] in 
the placebo group; 40% maturity) was not reached (95% CI 
24·1 to not calculable) in the olaparib group versus 
18·4 months (15·4–22·8) in the placebo group (figure 3B). 
Median time to second subsequent therapy (128 events: 
68 [35%] vs 60 [61%]; 43% maturity) was not reached 
(95% CIs not calculable) compared with 18·2 months 
(15·0–20·5) in the placebo group (figure 3C). The 
immature overall survival data (72 events: 45 [23%] vs 
27 [27%]; 24% maturity) showed no difference between the 
groups (HR 0·80 [95% CI 0·50–1·31], p=0·43; medians 
not reached in either group [95% CIs not calculable]). 
Results for time to earliest progression or death and time 
to study discontinuation or death are shown in the 
appendix (p 9).
Patient-reported outcomes showed no appreciable 
difference in quality of life for patients receiving olaparib 
compared with those receiving placebo. The primary 
analysis measure, mean change from baseline in TOI of 
the FACT-O (assessed in 185 [94%] of 196 patients in the 
olaparib group and 94 [95%] of 99 in the placebo group), 
was similar in both groups over the first 12 months 
(adjusted mean −2·90 points [95% CI −4·13 to −1·67] vs 
−2·87 points [−4·64 to −1·10]; estimated difference 
−0·03 points [–2·19 to 2·13]; p=0·98). Non-compliance 
with the FACT-O questionnaire resulted in the exclusion 
of 11 (6%) of 196 patients in the olaparib group and 
five (5%) of 99 patients in the placebo group from the 
analysis. Additional quality-of-life data will be published 
separately.
The most common adverse events of CTCAE grade 1–2 
in both groups were nausea, fatigue or asthenia, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, and diarrhoea (table 2). However, the 
overall incidence of grade 3–5 adverse events was low in 
both groups. The most common adverse event of grade 3 
or worse severity in the olaparib group was anaemia 
(table 2). 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group had a 
blood transfusion compared with one (1%) in the placebo 
group. The incidence of neutropenia and thrombo-
cytopenia of grade 3 or worse severity did not differ 
between the groups (table 2). Serious adverse events were 
experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group 
and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group. The most 
common serious adverse events in the olaparib group 
were anaemia (seven [4%] patients), abdominal pain 
(three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] 
patients). The most common in the placebo group were 
constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction 
(two [2%] patients).
Overall, 72 (24%) patients died during the study— 
45 (23%) of 196 in the olaparib group and 27 (27%) of 
99 in the placebo group. One (1%) patient in the olaparib 
group had a treatment-related adverse event (acute 
myeloid leukaemia) with an outcome of death (grade 5). 
No other deaths were considered to be related to study 
treatment by the investigator. The incidence in the safety

syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia 
during the study and long-term follow-up was four (2%) 
patients in the olaparib group (two [1%] acute myeloid 
leukaemia, one [1%] myelodysplastic syndrome, and 
one [1%] chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia) and 
four (4%) patients in the placebo group (one [1%] acute 
myeloid leukaemia and three [3%] myelodysplastic 
syndrome). Overall, the incidence of all secondary 
malignancies during the study and long-term follow-up 
was six (3%) patients in the olaparib group and five (5%) 
patients in the placebo group (appendix p 10).
The frequency of adverse events leading to dose 
interruptions was higher in the olaparib group than in 
the placebo group (table 3). Similarly, dose reductions 
following adverse events were more common in the 
olaparib group than in the placebo group (table 3). 
A greater proportion of patients in the olaparib group 
discontinued study treatment because of toxicity than in 
the placebo group (table 3). Anaemia (six [3%] patients) 
and neutropenia (two [1%] patients) were the most 
common adverse events leading to discontinuation in the 
olaparib group. Adverse events that led to discontinuation 
in the placebo group were invasive ductal breast 
carcinoma (one [1%] patient) and thrombocytopenia 
(one [1%] patient). Full details of adverse events leading 
to dose modifications, interruptions, and discontinuations 
are shown in the appendix (pp 13–17). 
Discussion
In this double-blind, randomised, phase 3 study, olaparib 
maintenance treatment (given as a tablet formulation) 
in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian 
cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation led to a significant 
improve 
ment in progression-free survival compared 
with placebo, as evaluated both by the primary endpoint 
of investigator assessment and by blinded independent 
central review. In addition, analysis of the primary 
analysis measure for patient-reported outcomes, TOI of 
the FACT-O, did not show any appreciable detrimental 
effect on patients’ quality of life for maintenance 
treatment with olaparib compared with placebo. The 
improvement in progression-free survival seen using 
the olaparib tablet formulation in this disease setting is 
compelling because patients were able to maintain a 
good quality of life while experiencing a delay in disease 
progression and, therefore, a delay until the symptoms 
associated with subsequent chemotherapy treatments.
The improvement in progression-free survival we 
recorded for patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation is 
comparable to that reported with other PARP inhibitors in 
phase 2 and phase 3 trials in similar clinical settings; 
however, indirect comparisons cannot be considered 
definitive, particularly because of differences between the 
patient populations.16–18 The subgroup analysis for 
progression-free survival in patients who had received 
treatment with bevacizumab prior to their final platinum 
regimen before randomisation in SOLO2 showed that 
bevacizumab did not alter the treatment effect for those 
receiving olaparib. The sensitivity analysis of progression-
free survival by blinded independent central review, which 
was done to account for any potential bias from 
the investigator assessment, was consistent with the 
investigator-assessed primary endpoint. The HR in the 
sensitivity analysis was numerically slightly higher (0·25 vs 
0·30). The increased median progression-free survival 
derived from the blinded independent central review 
analysis was possibly driven by informative censoring, 
whereby some patients who had progressed according to 
investigator assessment had not yet been shown to 
progress by blinded independent central review because 
scans were done every 12 weeks only, before submission 
for blinded independent central review assessment. 
Our sensitivity analysis that adjusted con 
servatively for 
informative censoring resulted in a median progression-
free survival by blinded independent central review that 
was similar to the investigator assessment (appendix p 7). 
The primary progression-free survival analysis was done at 
a slightly lower maturity than that outlined in the statistical 
plan because, once we had determined the data cutoff for 
progression-free survival, the event rate slowed, leading to 
five fewer events than predicted.
Our study also showed a significant improvement in 
time to first subsequent therapy, time to second 
progression, and time to second subsequent therapy in 
favour of olaparib. The timing of first subsequent therapy 
typically marks a substantial treatment shift for patients 
with recurrent ovarian cancer, from an oral PARP 
inhibitor to intravenous chemotherapy, whereas the 
analysis of time to second subsequent therapy suggests 
that patients reach their second subsequent treatment 
without the potential occurrence of chemotherapy 
resistance countering the benefit they originally received 
on olaparib maintenance treatment. Of the secondary 
endpoints presented here, time to first and second 
subsequent therapy might therefore be especially clinically 
meaningful.19,20 Furthermore, the analysis of time to 
second subsequent therapy included more events than did 
analysis of time to second progression or death (128 vs 119) 
because, at the time of data cutoff, some patients who had 
received a second subsequent therapy were not yet classed 
as having investigator-assessed disease progression 
following their first subsequent therapy. The overall data 
were immature at the time of this analysis.

Maintenance monotherapy with olaparib had previously 
been evaluated in Study 19, which showed a significant 
treatment benefit in both the overall study population 
(patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer) 
and the subpopulation of patients harbouring a BRCA1/2 
mutation.2 Our SOLO2 data support the treatment benefit 
observed in Study 19 for patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation, 
using a two-tablet twice-daily dosing schedule of olaparib. 
Patients with germline or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations 
were eligible for the SOLO2 trial. An exploratory analysis 
comparing clinical outcomes for patients with somatic 
BRCA1/2 mutations and germline BRCA1/2 mutations in 
Study 19 showed a consistent efficacy benefit with olaparib 
treatment for both groups.21 An analysis of the treatment 
benefit observed for patients with a somatic BRCA1/2 
mutation versus those with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation 
in SOLO2 would therefore have provided an interesting 
opportunity for study; however, all patients who were 
enrolled and randomised in our trial harboured a germline 
BRCA1/2 mutation. In line with other phase 3 PARP 
inhibitor data, the overall data in our study are immature 
and it is not yet known whether the progression-free 
survival improvement observed for patients receiving 
olaparib translates to a direct survival benefit. A preplanned 
analysis of overall survival at approximately 60% maturity 
(~177 overall survival events) will provide further 
information; these data will be reported in due course. 
Nine (3%) patients in the overall study population, who 
were randomised on the basis of a locally identified 
BRCA1/2 mutation, did not go on to have their BRCA1/2 
mutation confirmed as deleterious, or suspected 
deleterious, by the Myriad Genetics BRCA test as part of 
the trial. An analysis of progression-free survival that 
excluded these nine patients showed an HR in favour of 
olaparib that was highly consistent with the investigator-
assessed primary endpoint. These data indicate that the 
progression-free survival improvement reported for 
patients receiving olaparib in our trial was not changed 
by the inclusion of patients who did not have Myriad 
confirmation of their BRCA1/2 mutation.
Overall, the safety profile of the olaparib tablet was 
similar to that observed with the approved capsule 
formulation of olaparib.12 The rate of anaemia of grade 3 
or worse severity was higher in SOLO2 (olaparib: 38 [19%] 
of 195 patients; placebo: two [2%] of 99 patients [2%]) than 
in Study 19 (olaparib: seven [5%] of 136 patients; placebo: 
one [1%] of 128 patients).12 These data could be explained 
by the observation that patients in SOLO2 had a longer 
exposure to olaparib than did patients in Study 19; the 
median duration of exposure in SOLO2 was 19·4 months 
(approximately 588·7 days) in the olaparib group versus 
5·6 months (approximately 170·1 days) in the placebo 
group, whereas median exposure in Study 19 was 
206·5 days in the olaparib group and 141·0 days in the 
placebo group.12 The incidence of olaparib discontinuation 
due to adverse events showed that toxicity related to the 
300 mg twice-daily maintenance olaparib tablet dose was 
manageable in most of these patients with dose 
modifications. Use of this approach in SOLO2 reduces 
the pill burden from 16 capsules to four tablets per day, 
providing a more convenient regimen for patients.14 
Several of the most common adverse events observed in 
patients receiving olaparib in SOLO2—namely, fatigue, 
nausea, anaemia, and vomiting—are considered to be 
class effects associated with PARP inhibitors.16–18 The rates 
of neutropenia of grade 3 or worse were similar between 
the olaparib and placebo groups in SOLO2. Notably, some 
common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity, 
such as thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, and liver 
enzyme elevation (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase increased), which have been reported 
by more than 10% of PARP inhibitor-treated patients in 
other trials,16–18 were reported in no more than 1% of 
olaparib-treated patients in our trial. The rates of 
tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, and insomnia were 
not increased in the olaparib group versus placebo. Taken 
together, these data highlight that olaparib does not show 
a significant interaction with liver or cardiovascular 
function, and does not have an appreciable direct negative 
effect on psychological function. Long-term follow-up 
data showed that the incidence of secondary malignancies, 
including acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, was 
also similar between both treatment groups in SOLO2.
To our knowledge, SOLO2/ENGOT Ov-21 provides 
the first phase 3 data for olaparib tablets as maintenance 
treatment in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, 
serous ovarian cancer. Our results confirm that 
olaparib can achieve a significant prolongation of 
progression-free survival in this patient population 
with no appreciable detrimental effect observed for 
patients’ quality of life. The favourable safety profile in 
SOLO2 enabled most patients receiving olaparib to 
maintain full dosing throughout their maintenance 
treatment.
