support behaviours on child physical
activity, healthy eating, and screen time: a
cross-sectional study
Evelyn Pyper1*, Daniel Harrington1,2 and Heather Manson1,2,3
Abstract
Background: In Canada, 31.5 % of children are overweight or obese, putting them at an increased risk of chronic co-
morbidities and premature mortality. Physical activity, healthy eating, and screen time are important behavioural
determinants of childhood overweight and obesity that are influenced by the family environment, and particularly
parents’ support behaviours. However, there is currently a limited understanding of which types of these support
behaviours have the greatest positive impact on healthy child behaviours. This study aims to determine the relative
contribution of different types of parental support behaviours for predicting the likelihood that children meet
established guidelines for daily physical activity, daily fruit and vegetable consumption, and recreational screen time.
Methods: A Computer Assisted Telephone Interview survey was used to collect data from a random sample
of parents or guardians with at least one child under the age of 18 in Ontario (n = 3,206). Three multivariable
logistic regression models were built to predict whether or not parents reported their child was meeting
guidelines. Independent variables included parent and child age and gender, multiple indicators of parental
support behaviours, and socio-demographic characteristics. Parental support behaviours were categorized post-
hoc as motivational, instrumental, regulatory, and conditional based on an adapted framework.
Results: Controlling for all other factors in the model, several parental support behaviours were found to be
significant predictors of children meeting established health guidelines. For example, conditional support
behaviours including taking the child to places where they can be active (OR: 2.06; 95 % CI: 1.32-3.21), and
eating meals as a family away from the TV (95 % CI: 1.15-2.41) were significant positive predictors of children
meeting physical activity and fruit and vegetable guidelines, respectively.
Conclusions: Health promotion efforts aimed at improving particular parent support behaviours could be
effective levers for mitigating the burden of excess body weight in childhood. As such, the influence of
support behaviours should be fully considered in any comprehensive approach to prevention and reduction
of childhood overweight and obesity.

 Background
Addressing obesity and overweight in children and youth
(under age 18) is a key public health priority in many in-
dustrialized countries. In Canada, over a period of
twenty-five years (1978–79 to 2004), rates of obesity in
children more than doubled, while rates of overweight
increased by approximately 29 % [1, 2]. The most recent
estimates derived from direct anthropometric measure-
ments (i.e., Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated from
weight and height) indicate that 31.5 % of Canadian chil-
dren and youth are now overweight or obese according
to World Health Organization (WHO) cut-offs [3]. This
estimate is similar to those in other countries in the
western world [4, 5]. These rates indicate a significant
public health issue given that overweight and obese
individuals are at an increased risk of chronic conditions
in adulthood (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type II dia-
betes, cancer), and ultimately an increased risk prema-
ture mortality [6].
At the physiological level, the accumulation of fat on
the body is caused by an energy imbalance whereby cal-
oric intake from diet exceeds the calories expended
through human metabolism and physical movement. As
such, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and healthy
eating are important behavioural determinants of over-
weight and obesity [7–9]. Given their importance, each
of these behaviours has its own set of national guidelines
in Canada, each of which has been developed to reflect
the changing needs of children as they age (Table 1).
The relationships between these behaviours and body
weight cannot be assumed to be linear, and rather, re-
sult from complex interactions between individuals
and the physical, social, political and economic envi-
ronments in which they live (e.g., school, workplace,
home, neighbourhood) [10]. For children and youth,
mediating variables in the relationship between health
behaviours and body weight extend to the influence
of parents through means such as parental modelling,
parental support behaviours, and the family environ-
ment [11]. A successful response to child and youth
overweight and obesity must consider these under-
lying complexities [12].
Parental support for child health behaviours
Children’s health behaviours are highly influenced by
their parents, with whom children are in close proxim-
ity for the early part of their lives [13]. For example,
parental support behaviours have been found to correl-
ate closely with the physical activity, eating behaviour,
and body weight of preschool and school-aged children
[14, 15]. Behaviours of children under 12 years of age
are under less volitional control than older children,
and thus, parents play a major role in promoting or
inhibiting opportunities for healthy active living [16].
Although adolescents may increasingly assert autonomy
over their behaviours [17], a strong relationship remains
between parental social support and adolescent physical
activity [18]. These findings align with results indicating
that children’s health behaviours are shaped by their par-
ents throughout their formative years, and even as they
enter and proceed through adolescence [18–24].
Parents have been described as gate-keepers of chil-
dren’s health-related behaviours, through their provision
of social support for physical activity [25] and healthy
eating [26]. In acknowledgement of the considerable
variation in how social support is operationalized in the
literature, Beets and colleagues [16] propose the follow-
ing physical activity-specific definition:

 “Social support represents the functional
characteristics associated with the interactions
between a parent and his or her children in the
context of intentionally participating in, prompting,
discussing, and/or providing activity-related oppor-
tunities.” (p. 624).
This definition of social support as an umbrella term
is used as a frame for the purposes of this paper as it
can be applied to parental support for three specific
child health behaviours: physical activity, healthy eating,
and screen time.
Physical activity
Physical activity may be promoted or inhibited by the
behaviours of parents and the family environment
[27]. There is evidence to suggest that targeting par-
ental support behaviours directly, as opposed to other
constructs (e.g., attitudes) can be effective strategies
for improving children’s physical activity [28]. That is,
many parents are already convinced of the importance
of physical activity for their children, and when atti-
tudes towards health behaviours are ceilinged, there is
little room for improvement [29].
In order to target parental support behaviours ef-
fectively, the relative contributions of specific parental
support behaviours to child health must be better
understood. There are a number of parent behaviours
that have been found to be associated with increasing
child physical activity [20, 21, 30]. Parents’ own phys-
ical activity levels as observed by their children—often
referred to as parental modelling—have been shown
to be positively associated with children’s physical ac-
tivity levels [19, 30–32]. Others have proposed that
parent activity is insufficient to increase children’s
physical activity. Trost and colleagues [33] as well as
others [34] have suggested that children’s physical ac-
tivity may instead be more strongly determined by
parents’ support behaviours across a variety of strat-
egies. Positive reinforcement (e.g., encouragement) has
been found to be significantly related to child and
adolescent
physical
activity,
perhaps
by
increasing
children’s
feelings
of
competency
and
behavioural
intentions [35]. Providing transportation and equip-
ment, as well as enrolling children in opportunities
for physical activity, represent instrumental parental
support behaviours associated with increased physical
activity in children [36]. Finally, evaluations of inter-
ventions have shown that parent involvement in chil-
dren’s physical activities (e.g., shared participation)
improves intervention success; yet, evidence based on
interventions exclusively targeting families are limited
and inconclusive [37].
Healthy eating
Children’s eating patterns are also influenced by a variety
of family and social factors, with parents’ behaviours
playing a direct role [38]. Eating patterns may refer to
various mealtime characteristics (e.g. where the meal is
eaten and who the meal is eaten with) or indicators of
diet quality including meeting food-based guidelines or
recommendations [38]. Independent of the healthy eat-
ing metric (e.g., fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption,
dietary fat intake, consumption of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages), it is important to consider the influence of a
range of parental support behaviours. Lopez et al. [39]
demonstrated that greater parental support for healthy
eating in children, aged 5 to 8 years old, is associated
with less consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,
where parental support was represented by a composite
score based on: (1) encouraging the child to eat FV; (2)
providing fruit or vegetables to the child; (3) eating FV
with the child; (4) encouraging the child not to drink
sugary beverages; and, (5) talking with the child about
correct food portion sizes. Despite these findings, the
relative influence of specific types of parental support
behaviours cannot be elucidated when variables are col-
lapsed into one summary score (e.g., a composite index).
When parental support behaviours are examined separ-
ately, parental encouragement to eat healthy foods has
been shown to have a significant positive influence chil-
dren’s dietary behaviours [15, 40].
Instrumental support (e.g., purchasing a child a new
fruit to try) has been associated with FV availability and
accessibility, which can influence children’s eating envir-
onment, and thereby shape children’s eating patterns [26].
Where children eat their meals is also relevant, as eating
out at restaurants is associated with higher intake of diet-
ary fat and energy compared to eating at home [38]. Eat-
ing out at fast-food restaurants at least weekly is also
associated with greater consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages in children aged 5 to 8 years old [39]. Moreover,
children’s eating patterns can be influenced by the social
context of meals, specifically whether their family eats to-
gether. Children who have dinner together with family
members tend to eat more healthy foods and nutrients
[38]. Similarly, children who share family meals three or
more times per week are more likely to be in a normal
weight range and have healthier dietary patterns than
those who share fewer than three family meals together
[41]. Alternatively, when TV-viewing is a normal part of
the family eating experience, children tend to consume
more pizza, snack foods, and sodas, and fewer FV than
those who do not watch TV during meals [39, 42].
Screen time
The past decade has seen an influx of screen-based seden-
tary pursuits above and beyond TV-watching, including
Pyper et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:568 
Page 3 of 15
 cell phones, tablets, and video games [43]. There is now a
greater understanding of the harmful nature of sedentary
behaviour, and consequently, current recommendations
call for individuals to not only move more, but also sit less
[43]. TV viewing and other types of screen time act as
proxy measures for sedentary behaviour, which is charac-
terized by little physical movement and low energy ex-
penditure [8, 44]. Saunders and colleagues [45] found that
short bouts of sedentary behaviour (e.g., those lasting
1–4 minutes) and breaks in sedentary time are associ-
ated with reduced cardiometabolic risk in children,
aged 8 to 11 years old, independent of total sedentary
time and physical activity. Further, they suggest that
TV viewing and leisure time computer and video
gaming
presented
risks
independent
of
objectively
measured sedentary time [45]. In other words, time
spent sitting is bad for health, but time spent sitting
in front of a screen is worse. While both peer and
family relationships influence children’s health behav-
iours, previous work suggests that family relationships
may be more important for decreasing screen-based
sedentary behaviours such as TV/video viewing and
computer/video game playing in 10- to 14-year-old
girls [22].
Consideration of specific parental factors reveals
that parent TV viewing is associated with child TV
viewing across all ages when controlling for media ac-
cess variables, parent co-viewing, time restrictions,
parental characteristics, and demographic/household
characteristics. Specifically, every hour of parent TV
viewing resulted in an additional 23 min of child TV
viewing [46]. In addition to modelling, observational
learning is likely to occur via co-viewing, whereby
parents watch TV with their children [47]. Socioeco-
logical theory proposes that TV screen time may be
an integral part of family life [48], and thus, co-
viewing may be a key component of a family’s shared
time. Nonetheless, parental co-viewing is associated
with increased TV time among young children and
adolescents [23, 46, 49]. A possible explanation is that
co-viewing does not give children another model of
how to spend their leisure time, inadvertently ingrain-
ing screen time habits [23, 50].
Presence of rules has been associated with a lower
probability of excessive spending time on screen-based
activities by 11- and 15-year-old children; however,
rule-setting to restrict the content of TV programs or
computers showed no association [23]. The extent of
parents’ screen time rule-setting has been shown to
vary depending on the age of the children, parental age,
and parental race [51, 52]. Moreover, it is important to
consider screen time messages children receive from
parents’ verbal communication and how these might
differ from parents’ own actions [53].
Towards an integrated classification of parental support
behaviours
Despite often being studied in isolation, it is evident that
child physical activity, healthy eating, and screen time
are inter-related. For example, screen time has an inde-
pendent contribution to overweight and obesity, but
may also contribute through other behavioural mecha-
nisms by: decreasing time spent engaging in physical ac-
tivity [54]; increasing snacking while viewing [55]; and
interrupting sleep duration [56, 57]. Likewise, each of
these can be influenced by parental support behaviours,
and there are clearly similarities in the types of supports
used by parents across child health behaviours.
A consensus on how to classify parental support be-
haviours is currently lacking in the healthy eating and
screen time literature. Even in the physical activity litera-
ture, where operationalizations of social support behav-
iours have received some focus, there is great variation
in how behaviours are classified [16, 58]. In this vein, a
limitation of many studies is the combination of parental
support behaviours into a composite measure; thus, the
specific effects of different parental supports cannot be
investigated [16, 59].
In recognition of the inconsistencies in parental sup-
port behavior classifications [58], Beets et al. [16] iden-
tify categories of social support for youth physical
activity-related behaviours. Motivational, instrumental,
and conditional parental support are clearly defined by
the Beets et al. [16] framework that provides a founda-
tion for the classification scheme used for this study
(Table 2). To account for behaviours that involve enfor-
cing rules or setting limits, which we consider a unique
parental support behaviour, we have adapted this frame-
work to include a regulatory category in the classifica-
tion scheme.
Knowing what promotes child health is futile if we do
not know how to best support these health behaviours.

 Establishing a classification scheme of four defined types
of parental support behaviours allows for inquiries of the
impact of these both between and within different types
of health behaviours. Related findings would be useful
for the development of health promotion activities
across a variety of settings, including communications
strategies and messages directed at parental support
behaviours.
Objectives
The purpose of this study is to determine the relative
contribution of different types of parental support be-
haviours for predicting whether children are meeting
recommendations for physical activity, screen time, and
healthy eating. Specific objectives are: (1) to classify
types of parental support behaviours using the classifica-
tion scheme identified in Table 2; (2) to determine if the
different types of parental support behaviours predict
child health behaviours; and, (3) to assess these relation-
ships within and between different child health behav-
iours. This study aims to fill the existing gap in
knowledge within the literature regarding the relative in-
fluence of specific types of parental support behaviours
on child health behaviours; and to provide evidence to
inform the development of population-level interven-
tions, and other initiatives to address child health behav-
iours by modifying parental support behaviours.
Methods
Data
This study uses data collected from a Computer Assisted
Telephone Interview (CATI) survey with parents/guard-
ians in Ontario who felt comfortable answering ques-
tions about the child in the household with the next
birthday. A random sample of publically available phone
numbers
was
drawn,
including both
landlines
and
cellular phones. Data were collected from parents or
guardians with at least one child under the age of 18 (n
= 3,206). Due to the length of the survey, parents were
asked to answer at least two of the four health behaviour
modules (physical activity, healthy eating, recreational
screen time, and sleep). These were randomly selected at
the time of the interview. Participants were also invited
to complete additional, optional modules at the end of
the survey.
Of the total number of respondents, 2,237 answered
the
physical
activity
module,
2,288
answered
the
healthy eating module, 2,248 answered the screen
time module, and 2,227 answered the sleep module.
All respondents answered questions about community
perceptions, and demographics. The survey achieved a
response rate of 7 %1 and a cooperation rate of 12 %2
based on American Association for Public Opinion
Research standard definitions [60].
Dependent variables were derived as follows: For phys-
ical activity, parents were given a definition of moderate
to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and were asked to
report the average minutes of MVPA their child got each
day in the past week. For the indicator of healthy eating,
parents were asked to report how many FV servings
their child eats on a typical day. Children under the age
of two were excluded from the analysis, because there
are no behavioural data for children under the age of
one, and there is no FV guideline for children under
two. Finally, parents were asked to how long their child
spends, on a typical day, using the following items (not
including time spent doing homework, or time spent in
front of a screen at school): television and/or DVD
player; computer or laptop; tablet or iPad®; and video
game console. Total number of screen time minutes
were calculated by adding these four items. Children
under the age of one were excluded from the analysis, as
no behavioural data are available for this group. Sleep
was not included in this study because of the lack of
established national guidelines related to sleep hygiene.
Average daily MVPA, average daily FV servings, and
average daily screen time during leisure time were com-
pared to established behavioural guidelines for age and
gender (Table 1). This process resulted in the construc-
tion of binary dependent variables (i.e., meets guideline
versus does not meet guideline) for each of the three
child health behaviours.
Key independent variables for this study are the differ-
ent types of parental support behaviours related to each
child health behaviour. Parents were asked to indicate
whether they strongly agree, agree, neither agree or dis-
agree, disagree, or strongly disagree with each of the
statements found in Table 3, which have been organized
according to the adapted framework presented in Table 2.
To create binary independent variables, the responses
strongly agree and agree were collapsed into a single
item, as were the remaining responses. Child age was re-
coded from a continuous variable to a categorical vari-
able with the following age groups: 0 to 4 years old, 5 to
8 years old, 9 to 12 years old, and 13 to 17 years old. A
binary variable was created for marital status, comprised
of living with partner (living common-law, married) and
not living with partner (widowed, separated, divorced,
single). Time since immigration was re-coded to become
0 to 9 years (0–4 years ago, 5–9 years ago), 10+ years
(10–20 years ago, more than 20 years ago), and Canad-
ian-born. The variable measuring parents’ highest level
of education completed was re-coded as follows: below
secondary school (never attended school, less than sec-
ondary school graduation), secondary school diploma,
and post-secondary school (apprenticeship or trades cer-
tificate or diploma; college, CEGEP or other non-
university certificate or diploma; university certificate or
Pyper et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:568 
Page 5 of 15
 diploma below bachelor level; bachelor’s degree; univer-
sity certificate, diploma or degree above bachelor level).
Employment status was also re-coded into the follow-
ing categories: employed (full-time, part-time, self-
employed), unemployed, and other (Ontario Disability
Support Program, retired, student, homemaker, work-
ing without pay, other). Total household income cat-
egories were re-coded from increments of $10,000 to
increments of $20,000. It should be noted that those
who refused to report their income were treated as
their own category (did not respond). Finally, the vari-
able measuring number of children in the household
was re-coded into 1, 2 to 3, and 4 or more categories.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted with SAS Version 9.3. De-
scriptive statistics were calculated to describe the sample
by demographic characteristics, parental support behav-
iours, and child health behaviours. Bivariate analyses
were used to determine the relationships between all in-
dependent variables (including the different types of par-
ental
support
behaviours)
and
dependent
variables
(whether children reach the guidelines) for each of the
health behaviours. Specifically, independent samples t-
tests were conducted for continuous variables and chi-
square tests were conducted for categorical variables.
Independent variables included: child age and gender,
parent age, gender, marital status, time since immigra-
tion, education, employment status, total household in-
come, and number of children in the household.
To determine the relative importance of parent sup-
port behaviours in predicting whether children meet
health guidelines, multivariable logistic regressions were
used. Models were built starting with parent and child
age and gender; followed by the inclusion of parental
support
behaviours;
followed
by
socio-demographic
characteristics (marital status, time since immigration,
highest
level
of
education
completed,
employment
status, total household income, and number of children
in household). Based on indications of its influence on
child health behaviours [19], a parent–child gender
interaction term was tested. These were found to be
non-significant predictors for all three child health out-
comes, and were therefore excluded from the models.
Similarly, a variable measuring child physical or mental
condition that may limit activities, as well as household-
level food insecurity were not significant predictors of
meeting physical activity, or FV guidelines, respectively.
Thus, these variables were also excluded from final lo-
gistic regression models due to lack of significance. Gen-
eralized

did
not
indicate
multicollinearity in any of the regression models. Differ-
ences between estimates were tested for statistical sig-
nificance at p < 0.05.
Results
Sample
Male (n = 1620, 50.6 %) and female children (n = 1585,
49.5 %) were represented with a relatively even distribu-
tion of ages ranging from 0 to 17 (mean = 8.83, sd = 5.23,
median = 9). Conversely, parents were predominantly
female (71.0 %) with ages ranging from 19 to 73 (mean
= 41.92, sd = 8.10, median = 42). Demographic character-
istics and other variables describing the study sample
can be found in Table 4.
Physical activity
Guidelines
The proportion of parents that reported their child
was reaching the Canadian Society for Exercise Physi-
ology (CSEP) physical activity guidelines differed by
the following child age groups: 1 to 4 years old
(53.8 %, n = 253), 5 to 8 years old (72.9 %, n = 339), 9
to 12 years old (68.1 %, n = 312), and 13 to 17 years
old (59.8 %, n = 400). Of these four age groups, only
the 13- to 17-year-olds showed significant differences

 between the proportion of females (52.5 %) and males
(67.5 %) meeting the guidelines (p = < .0001). Children
under the age of one were excluded from the analysis,
because there were no behavioural data collected for
children in this group.
Parental support behaviours
The proportion of parents engaging in support behav-
iours for physical activity ranged from 80.5 % (taking
part in physical activity with child), to 97.2 % (encour-
aging child to be active outdoors with friends and family)
(Table 5).
Model
As indicated in Table 6, the following parental support
behaviours contributed significantly to the predictions of
child physical activity: parents who take their child to
places where they can be active were more than twice as
likely to have their child meeting physical activity guide-
lines (OR: 2.06; 95 % CI: 1.32-3.21); parents who encour-
age their child to be active outdoors with friends and
family were 1.94 times more likely (95 % CI: 1.04-3.61);
and parents who take part in physical activity with their
child were 1.35 times more likely (95 % CI: 1.03-1.76).
These associations remained significant in the model
after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics. Looking at the association of predicted
probabilities and observed responses, the c-statistic, or
area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve is 0.65, indicating a reasonably good model fit.
Healthy eating
Guidelines
The proportion parents that reported their child was
reaching Canada’s Food Guide recommendations for FV
consumption decreased as child age increased in the
following age groups: 2 to 4 years old (50.3 %, n = 187),
5 to 8 years old (37.0 %, n = 183), 9 to 12 years old
(16.2 %, n = 78), and 13 to 17 years old (8.2 %, n = 57).
Within each age group, the proportion of children meet-
ing FV guidelines did not differ significantly by child
gender.
Parental support behaviours
The proportion of parents engaging in support behav-
iours for healthy eating ranged from 34.3 % (eating
meals prepared or purchased at fast-food restaurants
with child), to 98.5 % (encouraging child to eat breakfast)
(Table 5).
Model
As shown in Table 7, the following parental support be-
haviours contributed significantly to the predictions of
child FV consumption: parents who reported eating
meals as a family away from the TV were 1.67 times
more likely to report their child is meeting FV guidelines
(95 % CI: 1.15-2.41); and parents who reported serving
raw FV for snacks between meals were almost five times
more likely (95 % CI: 2.67-9.12). These associations
remained significant in the model after adjusting for
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Looking
at the association of predicted probabilities and observed
responses, the c-statistic, or area under the ROC curve
is 0.79, indicating a reasonably good model fit.
Screen time
Guidelines
The proportion of parents reporting that their child
reaches the CSEP screen time guidelines differed by
the following child age groups: 1 to 4 years old
(15.3 %, n = 68), 5 to 8 years old (54.5 %, n = 249), 9
to 12 years old (37.7 %, n = 163), and 13 to 17 years

 old (29.7 %, n = 187). Significant gender differences
were seen for the proportion of 9- to 12-year-old fe-
males (43.3 %) and males (32.3 %) meeting screen
time guidelines (p = 0.018). The proportion of 13- to
17-year olds meeting these guidelines was also signifi-
cantly
different
for
females
(39.4
%)
and
males
(18.2 %) (p = < .0001).
As previously described, the total number of child
screen time minutes were calculated by adding the time
spent in front of a television and/or DVD player, com-
puter or laptop, tablet or iPad®, and video game console
(as reported by parents). To better understand the ob-
served gender difference, screen time minutes for male
and female children were looked at for each type of
screen. As shown in Table 8, the largest gender differ-
ence is seen for average time spent playing video games
in a day, for which males had approximately 28 min
more than females.
Parental support behaviours
Of the parents surveyed, 78.5 % reported enforcing rules
about their child’s screen time, 79.9 % reported watching
TV together as a family, and 86.2 % reported encour-
aging their child to limit their screen time during leisure
time (Table 5).
Model
The following parental support behaviours contributed
significantly to the predictions of child screen time be-
haviour: parents who enforce rules about their child’s
screen time were 2.03 times more likely to have their
child meeting screen time guidelines (95 % CI: 1.49-
2.77); while families who watch TV together were 33.1 %
less likely (95 % CI: 0.51-0.88) (Table 9). These associa-
tions remained significant in the model after adjusting
for demographic characteristics.
The presence of every additional TV screen in the
household decreased the likelihood of a child meeting
screen time guidelines by 23.1 % (95 % CI: 0.70-0.85).
Similarly, the presence of every additional screen (other
than TV screens) in the household decreased the likeli-
hood of a child meeting screen time guidelines by 6.3 %
(95 % CI: 0.89-0.98). Looking at the association of pre-
dicted probabilities and observed responses, the c-

Discussion
Overall, our results revealed that different types of par-
ental support behaviours differentially predict whether
children are meeting recommendations for physical ac-
tivity, healthy eating, and screen time, as measured by
parent report. All models were adjusted for the demo-
graphic
and
socioeconomic
variables
identified
in
Table 4; however, the focus of this discussion is on the
role of parental support behaviours.
Physical activity
Three parental support behaviours contributed signifi-
cantly to predictions of child physical activity. First, par-
ents who reported taking their child places where they
can be active were more likely to have children meeting
physical activity guidelines. This parental behaviour falls
under the instrumental category of support, defined as
the
provision
of
aid
and/or
tangible
services
[16]
(Table 2). Transportation, in addition to other instru-
mental support behaviours (e.g., provision of equip-
ment), has previously been shown to be associated with
increased physical activity in children [36]. Since oppor-
tunities for physical activity often involve venues away

 from one’s household, children may be dependent on
parents for transportation to and from activities.
Parents who reported encouraging their child to be
active outdoors with friends and family also emerged
as a significant predictor of children meeting physical
activity guidelines. Encouragement is a motivational
support behaviour characterized by the provision of
verbal or nonverbal prompts to engage in the behav-
iour, as well as validation of one’s involvement [16].
As proposed by Pugliese and Tinsley [35], parents’
motivational support may increase children’s compe-
tency and behavioural intentions, which, in turn, lead
to increases in physical activity. The significance of
this particular type of support over other motivational
behaviours may be due to being active outdoors, with
friends and family, or both.
Children who spend more time outdoors have been
shown to be more active and have a lower prevalence
of overweight than children spending less time out-
doors [61]. In the same study, time spent outdoors
positively predicted boys’ physical activity and in-
versely predicted the prevalence of overweight among
older children 3 years later. Given the well-established
decline in activity in adolescence, this finding high-
lights encouragement of outdoor activity as a promis-
ing support behaviour [61, 62].
The dynamic and rough landscapes for play that
characterize natural environments are central to challen-
ging children’s motor activity [63]. On top of these phys-
ical benefits, exercising in natural environments has
been shown to be associated with greater positive en-
gagement and decreased tension compared with exercis-
ing indoors [42]. Despite such strong support from the
literature, children’s engagement in outdoor physical ac-
tivity is impeded by a number of factors. A study by
Clements [64] found that mothers identified their child’s
TV viewing and computer game-playing as the top rea-
son for a lack of outdoor play. Another barrier empha-
sized in the 2015 ParticipACTION Report Card on
Physical Activity for Children and Youth is “the protec-
tion paradox” ([65], p. 7); whereby parents are increas-
ingly overprotecting their children to keep them safe
from external harms (e.g., crime, injury). We draw atten-
tion to the fact that 97 % of parents reported encour-
aging their child to be active outdoors with friends and
family, which may be less indicative of the reality of chil-
dren’s daily lives, and more reflective of parents’ recogni-
tion of the importance of outdoor play.
Third, our study found children were more likely to
meet physical activity guidelines if parents reported tak-
ing part in physical activity with them. This involvement

 child has been classified as conditional support [16]. The
Youth Physical Activity Promotion Model proposed by
Welk [66] acknowledges that engaging in active family
activities may act to directly reinforce a child’s physical
activity behaviour. This model suggests that parents also
influence child behaviour indirectly through predispos-
ing factors, including socialization and role modelling. It
is possible that parent–child co-activity in early child-
hood strengthens child self-efficacy and fosters positive
attitudes towards physical activity. These early predispo-
sitions, when enabled by a supportive environment and
reinforced by social influences, collectively increase the
likelihood that a child will be active on a regular basis
[66]. With regard to interpreting the significance of
shared physical activity, the field of neuroscience has
presented strong evidence that social interaction has a
powerful impact on neurogenesis. As Ratey and Hager-
man [67] explain: “Exercise cues up the building blocks
of learning, and social interaction cements them in
place” (p. 262). Of all the parental support behaviours
for physical activity explored in our study, participation
with the child was reported least often (80.5 %). Our
findings suggest that parent–child co-activity is a sup-
port behaviour warranting intervention aimed at increas-
ing the proportion of children reaching physical activity
guidelines. Future studies should consider evaluating
changes in parent–child co-activity over time, and how
this support behaviour relates to child physical activity.
Healthy eating
Two parental support behaviours contributed signifi-
cantly to predictions of child FV consumption in our
model. First, parents who reported eating meals as a
family away from the TV were more likely to have re-
ported that their child was meeting FV guidelines. The
implications of this conditional support behaviour can
be interpreted through two lenses, by considering the
evidence for “eating meals as a family” distinctly from
evidence for “eating meals away from the TV.” Eating to-
gether as a family shapes the social context of meals,
and children and adolescents who share family meals
tend to eat more healthy foods and nutrients [38] and be
in a normal weight range [41]. Key factors that ap-
pear
to
influence
whether
participation
in
family
meals leads to a more healthful diet include: (1)
healthy food availability at meals, (2) rules around
meals, (3) health-related attitudes and concerns of
family members, and (4) cultural factors, including
the type of food cooked in the home [68].
Alternatively, eating meals in front of the TV can influ-
ence both what and how much children are consuming.
Children from families in which television viewing is a
normal part of meal routines may have diets that include
fewer FV and more pizzas, snack foods, and sodas than
the dietary patterns of children from families in which
television viewing and eating are separate activities [42].
Screen-viewing may act as an environmental cue leading
children to eat mindlessly—a behaviour which involves
ignoring internal cues of satiety which signal when to
stop eating [69]. A stimulus–response paradigm has also
been used to demonstrate the influence of TV on
diet; the longer a person is exposed to advertising,
the more likely that person is to purchase and con-
sume the advertised foods [42]. Regardless of whether
this always holds true, eating family meals away from
the TV appears to be an important factor that influ-
ences children’s dietary patterns.
Second, parents who reported serving raw FV for
snacks between meals were almost five times more likely
to have children meeting FV guidelines. This form of in-
strumental support contributes to the child’s eating en-
vironment by increasing FV availability and accessibility
[26]. While these two concepts are highly connected, it
is important to acknowledge that FV can be available
(e.g., sitting in the fridge), but not accessible to children
(e.g., not cleaned, peeled, chopped, etc.) [70]. Serving
raw FV as a snack implies that the food is made available
and accessible, and when it is easier to obtain FV, our re-
sults indicate that children are more likely to eat them.
Other factors that should be considered in future studies
include child food preferences, parental feeding styles,
and the influence of the food environments outside of
the home (e.g., schools).
Screen time
In our logistic regression model, two parental support
behaviours contributed significantly to predictions of
child screen time behaviour. Parents who enforced rules
about their child’s screen time were more likely to report
that their child was meeting screen time guidelines. En-
forcing rules and setting limits characterize the regula-
tory category of parental support. Our finding aligns
with previous research demonstrating that setting rules
to restrict child screen time has been associated with a
lower probability of spending excessive time on screen-
based activities [23]. To better understand the import-
ance of rule-setting, future studies could consider: the
types of rules parents are setting, how parents are intro-
ducing these rules, and if these rules are being consist-
ently enforced.
Children were less likely to meet screen time guide-
lines if their parent reported that their family watches
TV together. Co-viewing—a conditional support beha-
viour—may shape child behaviour through observational
learning [47]. Watching TV as a family is a low-cost,
home-based activity that can provide a reliable and posi-
tive setting for fostering family relationships [71]. None-
theless, when the harms of sedentary behaviour are
Pyper et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:568 
Page 12 of 15
 considered, habitual family co-viewing becomes prob-
lematic. Our finding is consistent with the screen time
literature showing an association between parental co-
viewing and increased TV time among young children
and adolescents [23, 46, 49]. Family-based interventions
should focus on replacing regular TV co-viewing with
other shared family time activities which are more con-
ducive to child health.
Finally, the number of TV screens in the household
appeared to act as a barrier for meeting screen time guide-
lines, with every additional TV screen amplifying this rela-
tionship. Studies of the family environment—measuring
the presence of a TV in the bedroom, or the number of
additional TVs in the home—have also demonstrated an
association between household TV access and TV viewing
time [72, 73]. Similarly, the number of screens (other
than TV screens) in the household was a negative
predictor of children meeting screen time guidelines. The
dose–response
relationship
consistently
seen
between
screen access and screen time highlights the need for
simple messages encouraging parents to limit the number
of screens in the family environment.
Limitations
Limitations of the current study include that all informa-
tion was obtained from survey data, and therefore, mea-
sures of both parental support and child health were
parent-reported. The former may contribute to self-
report bias because of social desirability related to being
a supportive parent. Self-report bias may also result from
the latter, owing to the challenge of observing and accur-
ately recalling all child health behaviours throughout the
day. Accordingly, these parent-reported results may not
necessarily represent actual rates in Ontario. For ex-
ample, the results are much higher than the most recent
Canadian estimates based on objective measures of child
physical activity indicating that 9.3 % of children aged
5–17 are meeting guidelines [74]. Nevertheless, the aim
of this study was not to establish prevalence, but rather
to identify the types of parental support behaviours that
were significantly correlated with these outcomes. Future
research using objectively measured child health out-
comes may better elucidate the nuances of the relation-
ships reported here. This study also had a limitation
relating to the parent-reported measure of child screen
time. Although the survey contained a question on time
spent using a cell phone in a typical day, there was con-
cern about the validity of this survey item. As a result,
cell phone time was not included the study, and thus,
the amount of screen time reported is likely a conserva-
tive estimate. Another limitation of the analyses pre-
sented here is that the survey questions were not
designed in accordance with the classification scheme
for types of parental support behaviours used in this
study (Table 2). Rather, the classification scheme was de-
veloped post hoc to organize the data. As such, when
the parental support behaviours were classified by type
of support (Table 3), a number of categories contained
zero or few support behaviours. Future studies should
consider including a range of items for each category of
parental support to further test the relationships re-
ported here.
Conclusion
The results of the current study contribute to bridging a
gap in knowledge about which types of parental support
behaviours are most important for predicting child
health behaviours. The framework of social support for
youth physical activity developed by Beets et al. [16] pro-
vided a foundation of clearly defined parental support
behaviours, from which this study’s classification scheme
was adapted. Specifically, the regulatory category was
added to account for behaviours that involve enforcing
rules or setting limits. Given the inconsistent operatio-
nalizations of parental support behaviours in the litera-
ture, the adapted framework appears to be particularly
useful for classifying different types of behaviours as they
relate to child health behaviours including physical activ-
ity, healthy eating, and screen time. The importance of
this adaptation is in the acknowledgment of the inter-
dependence of different child health domains, and the
identification of an instrument for future studies to the-
oretically frame social support, including parental sup-
port for child health as such. The classification scheme
also allows for consideration of the effectiveness of dif-
ferent types of parental support behaviours between and
within different child health domains. Its use is condu-
cive to achieving greater consistency in the measure-
ment, reporting, and understanding of how parents can
best support their child’s health. However, at this time it
would be premature to privilege any one parental sup-
port behaviour over others until a more complete ana-
lysis can be undertaken, as discussed above. What is
clear from this research is that parental support behav-
iours are important determinants of child physical activ-
ity, healthy eating, and screen time. Thus, these support
behaviours should be fully considered in any compre-
hensive approach to prevention and reduction of child-
hood overweight and obesity.
