Health disparities in low-income communities may be linked to residential exposures to chemicals infiltrating
from the outdoors and characteristics of and sources in the home. Indoor sources comprise those introduced by
the occupant as well as releases from building materials. To examine the impact of renovation on indoor pol-
lutants levels and to classify chemicals by predominant indoor sources, we collected indoor air and surface wipes
from newly renovated “green” low-income housing units in Boston before and after occupancy. We targeted
nearly 100 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including
phthalates, flame retardants, fragrance chemicals, pesticides, antimicrobials, petroleum chemicals, chlorinated
solvents, and formaldehyde, as well as particulate matter. All homes had indoor air concentrations that exceeded
available risk-based screening levels for at least one chemical. We categorized chemicals as primarily influenced
by the occupant or as having building-related sources. While building-related chemicals observed in this study
may be specific to the particular housing development, occupant-related findings might be generalizable to
similar communities. Among 58 detected chemicals, we distinguished 25 as primarily occupant-related, in-
cluding
fragrance
chemicals
6-acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetralin
(AHTN)
and
1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-
4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyran (HHCB). The pre- to post-occupancy patterns of the re-
maining chemicals suggested important contributions from building materials for some, including dibutyl
phthalate and xylene, whereas others, such as diethyl phthalate and formaldehyde, appeared to have both
building and occupant sources. Chemical classification by source informs multi-level exposure reduction stra-
tegies in low-income housing.

 1. Introduction
Potential health impacts of chemical exposures in homes are of
particular concern in low-income communities, where there is dis-
proportionate exposure to pollutants from industry and traffic-related
sources (Miranda et al., 2011), and where behaviors (e.g. smoking) and
housing characteristics (e.g. smaller home size) linked with socio-
economic status (SES) are also associated with exposure to a greater
number and magnitude of indoor pollutants (Adamkiewicz et al., 2011).
Since residential exposures can dominate total exposures for many
chemicals of health concern, including semivolatile organic compounds
(SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Rudel and Perovich,
2009; Shin et al., 2014; Dodson et al., 2007a), identifying major sources
and opportunities to reduce exposure is a priority. SVOCs and VOCs
have been linked to a range of health effects including hormone dis-
ruption (Rudel and Perovich, 2009), cancer (NTP, 2014; Rudel et al.,
2007), neurotoxicity (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014), and respiratory
health (Hulin et al., 2012). In addition, there is a higher prevalence of
health conditions that are sensitive to the environment, such as asthma,
among low SES communities (Akinbami et al., 2016), increasing sus-
ceptibility to some of these indoor chemical exposures in low-income
homes.
Residential design practices aimed at reducing environmental im-
pacts—“green” building—present one opportunity to significantly
change chemical levels in homes. For example, lower emissions from
the materials used in green buildings could reduce some indoor ex-
posures. In recent years, green design has been widely implemented in
housing construction and renovation, and several studies have found
improvements in health after residents in low-income communities
moved into newly constructed (Colton et al., 2014; Jacobs et al., 2015)
or renovated green buildings (Breysse et al., 2014; Breysse et al., 2015;
Colton et al., 2015). This apparent health benefit may reflect im-
provements in indoor air quality, as evidenced by reduced levels of
particulate matter (PM2.5) (Frey et al., 2015), black carbon (Coombs
et al., 2016), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and allergens (Jacobs et al., 2014)
following implementation of green renovations.
However other elements of green design, such as tightening the
building envelope to reduce energy loss, could have varying impacts on
indoor exposures: lower air exchange could reduce infiltration of out-
door pollutants but could also increase exposure to chemicals origi-
nating indoors. Indoor sources encompass not only the building struc-
ture and materials but also occupant products and activities, including
cooking activities (Baxter et al., 2007), use of personal care and
cleaning products (Dodson et al., 2012a), smoking (Arku et al., 2015;
Kraev et al., 2009), and actions that influence air exchange. Despite the
potential for occupants' behavior to influence indoor air quality, there is
a lack of data to guide the design of interventions based primarily on
occupant education. Air quality measurements in homes are generally
obtained when occupants are present, limiting the ability to distinguish
which sources – occupant, building, and/or outdoor – are most im-
portant for a particular chemical or class of chemicals.
We thus designed our study to characterize occupant contributions
to indoor air quality in a community of recently renovated Boston low-
income housing units by sampling these units pre- and post-occupancy.
To our knowledge, our innovative design is the first to allow evaluation
of the occupant contribution to indoor air quality in green-renovated
homes by measuring PM2.5 and a large suite of VOCs and SVOCs both
before and after occupancy. We targeted chemicals that we expected to
be present in the indoor environment and have potentially significant
occupant sources, based on our previous research (Dodson et al., 2012a;
Rudel et al., 2003; Rudel et al., 2010). This study is also part of a larger
investigation of how green renovation affects indoor pollution levels
and asthma symptoms in public housing (Coombs et al., 2016; Ponder-
Brookins et al., 2014). Except for limited and conflicting data on levels
of formaldehyde (Colton et al., 2014; Frey et al., 2015; Coombs et al.,
2016; Xiong et al., 2015), there have been few measurements of the
effect of green construction on levels of VOCs (Jacobs et al., 2015; Noris
et al., 2013), and no investigation of SVOCs. Our goal was thus to ex-
pand knowledge about the impacts of green renovation on the indoor
environment and to inform development of more comprehensive in-
terventions to improve indoor environmental quality, especially in low-
income communities.
2. Methods
2.1. Study site
In 2011, the Boston Housing Authority began redeveloping several
properties according to “green” standards with support from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. At one federally subsidized
housing development in Boston's South End, 13% of residential units
were renovated. Improvements focused mainly on energy efficiency,
including high efficiency windows, additional insulation, energy star
appliances, low energy lighting, and low VOC paints, but also aimed to
modernize the units by installing new flooring, baseboards and cabi-
nets. The buildings were awarded a U.S. Green Building Council
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Homes
certification and Homes Energy Rating System (HERS) tier II energy
rating of 65, meaning these units were designed to be 35% more effi-
cient than a reference home.
Of the 30 unique units sampled, all but three were single-story, two-
or three-bedroom units with average sizes of 700 ft2 (6 units) and
850 ft2 (21 units) respectively, in three- or four-story multi-family walk-
up buildings (Table 1). We also sampled from three four-bedroom
townhouse units, which averaged 1200 ft2 in size. All units were heated
with baseboard radiators controlled by the residents, and some had
window air conditioners. There was no mechanical ventilation in these
units.
The study population comprised mostly younger (18–39 years old)
Hispanic females (Table 1). Twenty (74%) classified themselves as
Hispanic or Latino and, of the 16 born outside of the United States, most
(81%) were from the Dominican Republic. The majority of the parti-
cipants (67%) were the only adult living in the unit, and there were at
least three children living in most (82%) of the units. Most participants
(89%) were new to the housing development.
2.2. Sample collection
We collected indoor air and surface wipes from 10 newly renovated
units before occupancy (June to July 2013) and from 27 units one to
nine months after occupants moved in (July 2013 to January 2014)
(Fig. 1). We selected pre-occupancy units from the 13% renovated units
in the development, which received certificate of occupancies in April
2013, mostly based on availability for sampling, as renovations had to
be completed and the unit unoccupied for at least one week. For post-
occupancy sampling, we recruited seven participants living in units we
had sampled pre-occupancy, as well as an additional 20 participants
through door knocking at the other newly renovated units. We in-
tentionally sampled fewer pre-occupancy than post-occupancy units;
we hypothesized that variability of chemical concentrations in pre-oc-
cupancy units would be low, given that all units were renovated to the
same specifications, so that we would not need as many samples to
characterize the concentration distributions. Study protocols were re-
viewed by the Office of Human Research Administration at the Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
We targeted nearly 100 SVOCs and VOCs as well as PM2.5.
Specifically, we analyzed for 35 SVOCs in indoor air and 46 on floor
wipes,
including
phthalates,
flame
retardants,
pesticides,
anti-
microbials, and fragrances, with 23 SVOCs targeted both in air and on
wipes, 12 SVOCs in air only, and 23 on wipes only. Formaldehyde,
chlorinated solvents, BTEX chemicals, and nicotine were among the 26
VOCS analyzed in indoor air.

 All air samples were collected over a seven day period. Detailed
sampling and analytical methods are provided in Supplemental
Information (SI). Briefly, we collected SVOCs from main living area
indoor air using URG personal pesticide sampling cartridges (University
Research Glassware; Chapel Hill, NC) as previously described (Rudel
et al., 2003; Rudel et al., 2010; Rudel et al., 2001) and analyzed via gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) at Battelle Memorial In-
stitute, and surface wipes from the kitchen floor using the protocol
established in the American Healthy Home Survey (Stout et al., 2009),
with analysis via GC/MS at Southwest Research Institute. We passively
collected VOCs from indoor air using commercially-available activated
carbon badges. Badges were purchased from and analyzed by Assay
Technology (Boardman, OH) using gas chromatography with flame
ionization detector (GC/FID). We used separate passive samplers to
capture formaldehyde, which were purchased from and analyzed by
Assay Technology with high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using a UV detector. We used a passive diffusion monitor to
target vapor-phase nicotine. Nicotine badges were analyzed via GC/MS
at University of California, Berkeley using previously established
methods (Hammond and Leaderer, 1987). We collected PM2.5 using a
Harvard Personal Exposure Monitor at a target flow rate of 1.8 L/min.
We weighed filters before and after sampling using a Mettler MTS mi-
crobalance (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH).
We estimated air exchange rate (AER) in each unit using per-
fluorocarbon tracer gases (Dietz et al., 1986). Perfluoromethyl cyclo-
hexane gas (PMCH) was released continuously from sources with
known release rates that were placed near exterior walls. The PMCH gas
was then sampled via diffusion on capillary absorption tubes placed in
the center of the living space. Capillary absorption tubes were analyzed
at Harvard by GC. We calculated AER by assuming a well-mixed in-
terior, which is reasonable over seven days in small mostly single-level
housing units.
We also conducted a visual home inspection pre- and post-occu-
pancy, and administered a survey to the new residents post-occupancy.
The survey focused on satisfaction with the unit, thermal comfort,
mold/moisture, pests, appliance and product use, and self-reported
health.
2.3. Quality assurance and control
We employed several quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)
measures to evaluate the reliability of the data. We pooled QA/QC data
from this study with that from two of our other studies in low-income
housing. All studies used the same sampling procedures and we batched
the samples together for chemical analysis. Across all studies, duplicate
samples were collected to assess overall measurement precision for
SVOCs (n = 15 pairs), VOCs (n = 3 pairs) and PM2.5 (n = 2 pairs) in
air, SVOCs on surface wipes (n = 9 pairs), and PMCH for estimation of
air exchange (n = 47 pairs). To evaluate potential contamination from
the lab and from the sample matrices, at least one solvent blank and one
matrix blank were included with each lab batch, except for nicotine
analyses, which did not include a solvent blank. We also analyzed field
blanks (n = 14 SVOC air samples; n = 3 VOC air badges; n = 5 SVOC
wipes; n = 6 PMCH) to evaluate contamination that could have oc-
curred during sampling and transport. Recovery of at least one lab
control spike per batch was used to assess accuracy of the multi-residue
analytic method for each targeted SVOC, while recoveries of surrogate
compounds (n = 4 for SVOCS in air; n = 3 for SVOCs on wipes) helped
to characterize extraction efficiency for each sample.
Based on QA/QC results, we focused our analysis on indoor air. This
is because duplicate precision, measured as Relative Percent Difference
(RPD), was much better for chemicals measured in air (mean
RPD < 30% for all but one chemical) compared to chemicals mea-
sured on wipes (mean RPD > 30% for all but three chemicals, ranging
from 38% for BDE 100 up to 137% for carbaryl). Additional QA/QC
information and results are presented in SI.
2.4. Data analysis
We evaluated the impact of occupancy on indoor pollutant levels
using two main approaches. First, we compared detection frequencies
and visualized concentrations and source rates (mass of chemical
emitted per hour) by occupancy status. Source rates were calculated by
multiplying the measured concentration (ng or μg/m3) by the volume of
the unit (m3) and estimated air exchange (h−1) (see SI for calculation of
AER). Second, we used linear mixed effects models, with housing unit
as a random effect, to identify significant differences in pre- to post-
occupancy levels and source rates. We ran separate models with each
chemical concentration as the outcome, with concentrations log-trans-
formed because of the skewness of the data. Except where indicated, we
assigned a value of method reporting limit (MRL)/2 to results reported
by the lab as nondetect. We pursued the mixed effects modeling ap-
proach in order to explore the influence of potentially confounding
seasonal factors (see Fig. 1) by modeling log-transformed source rate as

 the outcome variable and by considering models restricted to non-
heating months only (June–September). Because substitution methods
are known to introduce bias (Helsel, 2006), we also conducted sensi-
tivity analyses using methods for mixed effects censored regression
proposed by Vaida and Liu (2009) (R package: lmec). We chose not to
rely on the censored regression method as our primary modeling ap-
proach as it is not well tested with environmental data and to our
knowledge cannot currently handle completely uncensored data.
We used the approaches described above to categorize 45 chemicals
measured in indoor air as showing evidence of either (a) a predominant
occupant source or (b) some contribution from a building-related
source. We classified chemicals as having a predominant occupant
source if they were only ever detected post-occupancy, if most (at least
five) of the seven paired samples showed increases with occupancy, or
if a chemical was detected in only one home pre-occupancy but > 10%
of homes post-occupancy. On the other hand, chemicals detected in at
least 60% of homes pre-occupancy, chemicals for which at least half of
the pairs showed decreases or remained constant with occupancy sug-
gested at least some building-related source(s). A few chemicals that we
would have classified as having a predominant occupant source based
on air concentrations were re-categorized as have some contribution
from the building because the surface wipes indicated higher con-
centrations pre- compared to post-occupancy. We did not categorize 10
chemicals that were never detected above the MRL at either time point
and 3 chemicals that were detected infrequently (< 10% of homes) pre-
and post-occupancy and did not show any clear pattern among those
few detects. In support of our main analysis, we also characterized and
compared variability pre- and post-occupancy. With uncensored log-
normal data, we could quantify a change in variability with a statistical
measure like the coefficient of variation. However, because of the de-
gree of left censoring – a high frequency of < MRL values – in our data,
usual statistical tests of variability are not appropriate. Instead, we
characterized spread in the upper half of the distribution by calculating
the ratio of the 95th to 50th percentiles of source rate. The character-
ization of spread complements regression modeling by highlighting
chemicals that may not have changed “on average,” but that had no-
tably higher values in a few homes, suggesting important sources of
chemicals – products or activities – in those homes.

 Regression modeling and calculation of the 95th/50th percentile
ratios were only done for chemicals with at least 60% detects above the
MRL for at least one time point (pre- or post-occupancy). We focused
our analysis on measured air concentrations because our wipe mea-
surements showed inadequate precision, which may reflect the spatial
variability of settled dust and surface residues (i.e. measurements may
be sensitive to the particular area wiped). Wipes may also represent the
surface material itself rather than typical house dust exposures.
Nevertheless, we considered wipe mass loadings when available,
especially for chemicals that were not targeted in air.
To provide context to our measurements, we compared our mea-
sured air concentrations to available risk-based screening values for
indoor air developed under U.S. EPA's Superfund program (U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). We compared concentrations
to both the carcinogenic (target risk of 1 in 106) and noncarcinogenic
(hazard index of 1) levels, noting the exceedances based on the lower
value. Screening levels were available for 16 target chemicals, mostly
VOCs.
Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R
v3.2.4, an open-source statistical software environment.
3. Results and discussion
As is typical, VOCs, if detected, were at higher concentrations (μg/
m3 range) than SVOCs (ng/m3 range) (Table 2). We found 29 of 35
(83%) targeted SVOCs in air, 26 of 46 (57%) targeted SVOCs on wipes,
and 18 of 26 (69%) targeted VOCs in air at levels above the MRL. As
expected, we detected more chemicals post-occupancy (29 SVOCs and
18 VOCs in air; 26 SVOCs on wipes) than pre-occupancy (20 SVOCs and
11 VOCs in air; 18 SVOCs on wipes).
AERs were higher post- compared to pre-occupancy as expected
given that all pre-occupancy sampling took place in the summer months
with the windows closed and without air conditioning. Variation in the
pre-occupancy AERs may be related to variation in temperature (see
Fig. 1). After substituting the MRL for two unrealistically low PMCH
post-occupancy measurements (see SI, Section 2), median AER re-
mained higher post-occupancy (1.1 h−1) compared to pre-occupancy
(0.80 h−1), although not statistically significant (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon
rank sum test). When we separated post-occupancy samples by heating
season (before and after September 30, 2013), AER estimates were
significantly higher in non-heating season post-occupancy units com-
pared to heating season post-occupancy units (1.5 vs 0.57 h−1), con-
sistent with previous estimates in low-income housing (Zota et al.,
2005). Seasonal variation in AER could be related to occupants opening
windows or installing window air conditioner units during the non-
heating season. Variation in indoor temperature relative to outdoor
temperature with season could also be a factor. The AERs in this study
are on par with previous estimates in Boston green housing units, which
are lower than in typical non-green housing units (Colton et al., 2014).
3.1. Source characterization
Our unique study design allowed us to distinguish chemicals pre-
dominantly introduced by the occupant from those influenced by
building sources. After controlling for the influence of emissions from
building materials – that is, establishing approximate baseline levels of
chemicals before occupants were present – our analysis identified 25
targeted chemicals for which occupants were the predominant source of
concentrations in indoor air (Fig. 2). These chemicals showed obvious
and often statistically significant increases in concentrations post-
compared to pre-occupancy. On the other hand, many of the remaining
chemicals were present before occupants moved in, and levels were
either similar or lower post- compared to pre-occupancy (Fig. 3A and
B); we classified these as having at least some contribution from
building-related sources.
Several factors, illustrated in Fig. 1, may have affected our
characterization of sources for each chemical. AER, which can influence
chemical concentrations (Liu et al., 2015; Su et al., 2013), varied not
just with occupancy but with season; because our post-occupancy
measurements spanned across seasons – summer through winter – an
observed increase in levels could thus be explained by the lower AER
for samples collected during the heating season. On the other hand,
levels of chemicals that appeared to decrease or remain constant with
occupancy may have been driven down by decreasing temperature
post-occupancy, which affects chemical emission rates for some che-
micals (Xiong et al., 2013), or significant sorption onto surfaces in-
cluding furniture and the occupants themselves (i.e. skin, clothing)
(Weschler et al., 2015; Weschler and Nazaroff, 2008).
3.1.1. Occupant as predominant source
Our study demonstrates that residential exposure to a number of
chemicals with known or suspected health effects, including anti-mi-
crobial and flame retardant chemicals, plastics chemicals, and fra-
grances, appear to be predominately related to occupant behavior and
product use in the home (Fig. 2). Flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl)
phosphate (TCEP), for example, was detected more frequently in post-
occupancy air samples and is classified as a carcinogen under Cali-
fornia's Proposition 65 program (CA OEHHA, 2017a).
Several chemicals never detected in air above the MRL pre-occu-
pancy were present in at least one home after occupants moved in.
These included anti-microbial triclosan; flame retardant BDE 47; nico-
tine; four chemicals classified by the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) as possible human carcinogens (flame retardants 2,3-
dibromo-1-propanol (23DB1P) (IARC, 2017a) and 2,2-bisbromomethyl-
1,3-propanediol (22BBM13P) (IARC, 2017a) and solvents methylene
chloride (IARC, 2014) and perchloroethylene (PCE) (IARC, 2017b); and
IARC probable carcinogen chloroform (IARC, 2017c). To our knowl-
edge, these are the first measurements of triclosan, 23DB1P, and
22BBM13P in air in US homes. Triclosan has been used in consumer
products such as toothpaste, antibacterial soaps, and children's toys
(Halden, 2014), however in 2016 the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) banned its use in over-the-counter soaps and body washes (FDA,
2016). In a recent systematic review, Johnson et al. concluded that
triclosan is ‘possibly toxic’ to reproductive and developmental health,
based on animal evidence for thyroid effects (Johnson et al., 2016).
BDE 47 has also been linked to thyroid hormone levels during preg-
nancy (Chevrier et al., 2010; Stapleton et al., 2011) and to neurode-
velopmental effects (Herbstman et al., 2007). A major congener of the
PentaBDE flame retardant mixture, BDE 47 was once widely used in
upholstered furniture before its phase-out in 2005 (Dodson et al.,
2012b). The post-occupancy BDE 47 levels in this study are similar to
previous measurements in California homes (Rudel et al., 2010) and
somewhat lower than those measured in California child care centers
and home-based child care facilities (Bradman et al., 2014). 23DB1P
and 22BBM13P were detected in just one home post-occupancy (at 0.58
and 0.74 ng/m3, respectively), but the potential health effects of these
chemicals are concerning. Brominated ‘tris’, the parent compound of
23DB1P, was banned from children's pajamas in the late 1970s due to
mutagenicity concerns yet continues to be used in furniture, in acrylic
carpets and sheets, and materials such as resins and paints (NTP, 2017).
22BBM13P is used in molded plastics and rigid polyurethane foam
(NTP, 2017).
As expected, several targeted fragrance chemicals and chemicals
used in beauty products appeared to be strongly associated with oc-
cupancy. Fragranced products have been linked to health effects in-
cluding exacerbation of asthma symptoms (Steinemann, 2009) and 6-
acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetralin (AHTN), musk xylene and musk
ketone have been shown to be weakly estrogenic in vitro (Bitsch et al.,
2002). In this housing development, musk ketone was only detected
after occupants moved in. We found AHTN and 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-
4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyran
(HHCB)

HHCB air concentration (9.7 to 130 ng/m3). Both AHTN (commercial
name Tonalide) and HHCB (commercial name Galaxolide) are synthetic
fragrances that have previously been found in a range of consumer
products, including detergents and personal care products such as
perfume (Dodson et al., 2012a). We are not aware of other measure-
ments of fragrance chemicals in air in US homes. The presence of these
chemicals pre-occupancy may reflect infiltration of fragranced products
used in other units or in hallways, or use by construction workers or
building staff previously working in the unit. Musk xylene was detected
least often and at the lowest levels among the four targeted fragrance
chemicals (Table 2), consistent with findings from our consumer pro-
duct testing (Dodson et al., 2012a). Other beauty product chemicals
with evidence for significant occupant sources included ethyl alcohol
(ethanol), which is also found in cleaning and pest control products
(Goldsmith et al., 2014); acetone and ethyl and butyl acetate, com-
monly found in nail products and paints (Goldsmith et al., 2014); and
methyl paraben, a preservative used in many personal care products
including makeup, shampoo, and lotions (Dodson et al., 2012a). Levels
of these chemicals showed statistically significant increases of > 200%
at the modeled GM from pre- to post-occupancy (Table S2). Given that
some of these chemicals – ethanol, acetone, and ethyl and butyl acetate
– are especially volatile, we also modeled changes in source rate, as
described in Section 2.4, before and after occupancy. Findings from
source rate models were consistent with concentration-based models.
Plasticizers such as phthalates and adipates are used in a wide range
of products including building materials (e.g. vinyl flooring); in this
housing complex, levels of two plasticizers, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA), increased significantly
with occupancy (Table S2). Both are used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC;
vinyl) and could have been present in furniture, toys, and clothing
brought in by occupants (Dionisio et al., 2015). DEHP, an anti-an-
drogen, affects reproductive development primarily in boys, and has
also been linked to asthma (Gray et al., 2000; Bornehag et al., 2004;
ECHA, 2012). The median post-occupancy air concentration in our
study (77 ng/m3) was in the range of concentrations measured in
homes in Albany, NY (Tran and Kannan, 2015) and in Northern Man-
hattan and the South Bronx (Just et al., 2015). The toxicity of DEHA has
been less well studied; however, it has been associated with re-
productive toxicity (Dalgaard et al., 2003; Miyata et al., 2006). To our
knowledge, DEHA has not been measured recently (i.e. within the past
5 years) in US homes, however the median concentration in air after
occupants moved in was comparable to our previous measurements in
homes on Cape Cod (Rudel et al., 2003) and lower than the median
level we found in homes in Richmond and Bolinas, California (Rudel
et al., 2010).
Of the 14 pesticides targeted only on surface wipes and not in air
samples, we found piperonyl butoxide (PiPBO), shown to enhance al-
lergic airway inflammation in rodents (Nishino et al., 2013); diazinon,
associated with neurodevelopmental effects in prenatally exposed ani-
mals (Eskenazi et al., 1999); and lindane, a California Proposition 65
(CA OEHHA, 2017b) and IARC carcinogen (IARC, 2015), in post-oc-
cupancy but not pre-occupancy samples. Of note, diazinon was tenta-
tively detected pre-occupancy – meaning that the lab was not confident
in the identification of the compound – in the same unit where it was
detected with more certainty post-occupancy. The maximum level of
PiPBO detected (0.64 μg/ft2) was approximately an order of magnitude
lower than the mean loading on wipes collected in the American
Healthy Housing Survey (AHHS; 4.18 μg/ft2) (Stout et al., 2009). On
the other hand, we detected diazinon in one sample at a mass loading of
0.046 μg/ft2, approximately 2× the mean reported in the AHHS
(0.0278 μg/ft2) (Stout et al., 2009) and slightly higher than the median
found in another study of Boston low income housing (0.037 μg/ft2)
(Julien et al., 2008). Mass loadings of DEET, a common broad spectrum
insect repellant, showed a significant increase of 200% (95% CI 44%,
540%) at the modeled GM.

 3.1.2. Building as contributing source
The presence of several chemicals pre-occupancy, whose levels de-
creased or remained constant after occupants moved in, provided evi-
dence of at least some building-related sources for several flame re-
tardants, plastics chemicals, and VOCs (Fig. 3A and B). However, the
number and complexity of changes that occurred with occupancy, as
illustrated in Fig. 1, precluded identification of ‘predominant’ building
sources with the same level of confidence as for chemicals with pre-
dominant occupant-related sources.
Given their use profiles, we were not surprised to find that four
target VOCs – cyclohexanone, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes – and
plastics chemical butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) appeared to have
building-related sources in this development. Cyclohexanone, used in
excess of 2 billion lbs/year in the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2016), is found in a
range of products including adhesives, paints and lacquers (Dionisio
et al., 2015; EPA, U.S., 2016). This chemical showed the greatest per-
cent decrease in modeled GM from pre- to post-occupancy (−69%;
95% CI: −85%, −35%), a finding that was consistent across models
exploring the potential influence of air exchange and season (Table S2).
Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, all common solvents used in
paints, decreased post-occupancy, with significant decreases for xylene
and ethylbenzene. Toluene and ethylbenzene are both listed by Cali-
fornia's Proposition 65 as a developmental toxicant (CA OEHHA,
2017c) and carcinogen (CA OEHHA, 2017d), respectively. The max-
imum levels of these chemicals detected in our study were lower than
those measured in a green high-rise building in New York (Xiong et al.,
2015), but higher than median air concentrations in California child
care centers (Hoang et al., 2016). Of note, the renovation specifications
Fig. 3. Chemicals for which concentrations decreased post-occupancy or showed a mix of increases and decreases likely have a source unrelated to the occupant. Panel A shows chemicals
whose levels in indoor air appear to be primarily influenced by building materials. Panel B shows chemicals that appear to have mixed building and occupant sources. Regression models
are shown for chemicals detected in at least 60% of samples. Paired samples (n = 7) indicated by light gray lines. See Table 2 for full chemical names and Supplemental information for
CAS numbers.

 for this housing complex included use of low-VOC paints. BBP, a Cali-
fornia Proposition 65 reproductive toxicant (CA OEHHA, 2017e) known
for its use in vinyl flooring, adhesives and glues, showed a significant
34% decline in modeled GM air concentration, but exploration of sea-
sonal factors and wipe data complicated the interpretation somewhat.
Air concentrations of BBP have been shown to vary significantly with
temperature in a test house, with higher concentrations measured at
higher temperatures (Bi et al., 2015). Given our sampling scheme (see
Fig. 1), we restricted our regression models to samples collected in the
summer to examine whether levels in some post-occupancy samples
collected at cooler temperatures (i.e. during the heating season) were
driving our findings. Indeed, the estimated decrease in BBP levels in
this model was attenuated and no longer significant (Table S2). Fur-
thermore, mass loadings of BBP on wipes actually increased significantly
post-occupancy (650%; 95% CI: 180%, 1900%). Post-occupancy BBP
mass loadings (GM: 6.4 μg/ft2) were lower than reported in the AAHS
(GM: 10.2 μg/ft2) (Hagan et al., 2014). Potential explanations include
(1) both the building and the occupants were important sources of BBP,
but air concentrations decreased overall because of substantial sorption
by additional surfaces (such as people and furniture) post-occupancy or
(2) building materials – such as paint – were the primary source of BBP,
and the levels increased on wipes as the chemical migrated onto floor
surfaces over time.
Two chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants, tris (1-chloro-
2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris (1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate
(TDCIPP), have known uses in furniture (Cooper et al., 2016; Stapleton
et al., 2012), but the lower GM concentrations in air post-occupancy
suggest a building source, such as insulation added during renovation of
this development. TDCIPP is a California Proposition 65 carcinogen (CA
OEHHA, 2017f) and has been associated with hormonal effects in men
(Meeker and Stapleton, 2010), whereas TCIPP is structurally similar to
California Proposition 65 carcinogen TCEP (CA OEHHA, 2017a). The
GM TCIPP air concentration decreased significantly from 26 to 17 ng/
m3 post-occupancy and the GM TDCIPP air concentration decreased by
nearly half, although not significantly, from 10 to 5.5 ng/m3. Both post-
occupancy GMs were slightly higher than previously reported in the
respirable (< 4 μm) fraction of 10 personal air samples (Schreder et al.,
2016). The surface wipe model results for TCIPP were consistent with
air, while TDCIPP was detected less frequently on wipes pre-occupancy
(pre: 40% > MRL; post: 74% > MRL) and the GM mass loading sig-
nificantly increased. The discrepancy between air and surface wipes for
TDCIPP may be a result of equilibrium dynamics – TDCIPP may be
released into the air and over time settles onto surfaces.
Interestingly, our data suggested that for several chemicals with
known uses in personal care and cleaning products, building-related
sources made a strong contribution to air concentrations in this de-
velopment. The GM concentrations of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), used
in personal care products such as nail polish and perfumes (Dodson
et al., 2012a), nonylphenol, used in cleaning products (Dodson et al.,
2012a), and benzophenone (BP), a UV filter, decreased in air after oc-
cupants moved in, with statistically significant reductions of 44%
(760 ng/m3 to 430 ng/m3) for DBP and 25% (420 ng/m3 to 320 ng/m3)
for BP (Table S2). Animal (Gray et al., 2006) and human (Pan et al.,
2006) evidence suggests that DBP, which could have been present in
adhesives or paint in these units, may be a reproductive toxicant. The
median DBP post-occupancy air concentration was greater than the
median in homes in Albany, NY (Tran and Kannan, 2015) but some-
what lower than measures in California child care centers (Gaspar et al.,
2014). DBP also showed the same puzzling pattern as phthalate BBP,
wherein the mass loadings increased non-significantly on post-occu-
pancy surface wipes. Again, this could be a reflection of the dynamics –
changing temperature, passage of time, absorption onto skin and fur-
niture – discussed above. Post-occupancy DBP mass loadings (GM:
2.5 μg/ft2) were almost half of AAHS mass loadings (GM: 4.7 μg/ft2)
(Hagan et al., 2014). Benzophenone, which to our knowledge has not
been previously measured in US homes, has been detected in emissions
from low- or no-VOC paints (Schieweck and Bock, 2015), and could also
be used in plastics and/or surface coatings and adhesives (NTP, 2006).
Benzophenone-3 (BP-3), another UV filter used in personal care pro-
ducts (Dodson et al., 2012a), also appeared to have building-related
sources, though the contribution of the building to overall levels of this
chemical may not have been quite as strong as for BP; levels of BP-3
were relatively similar comparing pre- to post-occupancy, and some
pairs increased (see Fig. 3B). Still, BP-3's detection in 100% of units pre-
occupancy suggests that workers may have used products – such as
sunscreen – containing this chemical, which impacted the space and
lingered, or it may have some as yet not well recognized uses in
building materials.
Additional chemicals that did not follow the patterns we expected
included PM2.5 and formaldehyde (Fig. 3B). Specifically, we expected
that PM2.5 – as well as benzene – would be influenced largely by in-
filtration of ambient air (e.g. from motor vehicles) while formaldehyde
would arise primarily from building-related sources that would deplete
over the course of sampling. However measured PM2.5 increased in one
pre- to post-occupancy pair, and measured indoor levels (median
11 μg/m3) were slightly higher than the annual average ambient con-
centration (7.6 μg/m3) recorded at an air quality monitoring site in
nearby Roxbury, MA. Comparing our measured indoor PM2.5 con-
centrations, which are integrated over 7 days, to the average of one to
three 24-hour integrated ambient PM2.5 concentrations collected every
three days at an air quality monitoring site over the same time period,
indoor concentrations appear generally higher than outdoor con-
centrations (see Fig. S4). Activities such as cooking and smoking in the
home (EPA, U, 2016) may have influenced indoor levels of PM2.5 above
and beyond ambient contributions; indeed, the home with one of the
highest PM2.5 concentrations also had the highest benzene and nicotine
concentrations. Overall, the pattern for benzene was more in keeping
with our expectations, with levels remaining relatively stable from pre-
to post-occupancy and comparable (median ~ 0.7 μg/m3) to the re-
ported annual mean ambient concentration in Roxbury, MA (Strum and
Scheffe, 2016). The range of formaldehyde concentrations, on the other
hand, were more consistent pre- and post-occupancy than we would
have predicted, suggesting that its presence as an additive in personal
care products (ATSDR, 2008) may have kept indoor air levels steady
even as emissions from building materials decreased. The median post-
occupancy formaldehyde concentration in our study (11 ng/m3) was on
par with findings from another study of green-renovated public housing
in Boston (Colton et al., 2014), but somewhat lower than in green-re-
novated low-income/subsidized housing in California (Noris et al.,
2013), Ohio (Coombs et al., 2016), and Phoenix (Frey et al., 2015).
Most of the remaining target chemicals appeared to have ‘mixed’
building and occupant sources (Fig. 3B), characterized either by (1)
notably higher levels in just one or a few post-occupancy units or (2) a
pattern wherein levels increased in air with occupancy but decreased on
wipes. Among chemicals in the first group, we expected diethyl
phthalate (DEP), a lower molecular weight phthalate used in personal
care products, including fragranced products, to be strongly influenced
by occupancy. However, measured GM air concentrations of DEP in-
creased only slightly with occupancy (pre: 270 μg/m3; post: 300 μg/
m3), while the maximum concentration increased substantially from
530 μg/m3 pre-occupancy to 1800 μg/m3 post-occupancy (Table 2).
Investigation of survey data showed that the unit with the highest
source rate for DEP – as well as DBP and BBP – reported frequent use of
several fragranced products, including daily air freshener and perfume
use. Our previous finding of a positive correlation between DEP and
several fragrance chemicals in consumer products (Dodson et al.,
2012a), in addition to reports of higher MEP, a urinary biomarker of
DEP, in perfume users compared to non-users (Braun et al., 2014;
Parlett et al., 2013), support the hypothesis that DEP is a common
carrier for fragrances. Our analysis of the 95th/50th percentile ratio
(Fig. S5) supports our interpretation of substantial skew in the post-
occupancy distribution of DEP, and measurements in air in homes in
R.E. Dodson et al.
Environment International xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
10
 Albany, NY (Tran and Kannan, 2015) and in California child care
centers (Gaspar et al., 2014) showed similar skewness. Methyl metha-
crylate (MMA), used in nail products (Goldsmith et al., 2014) as well as
in adhesives, paints and coatings, and flame retardant 1,3-dichloro-2-
propanol (13DC2P), a flame retardant breakdown product (NTP, 2005),
were also measured at notably higher levels in one or a few post-oc-
cupancy units. We are not aware of previous measurements of either of
these chemicals in residential indoor air. The occupant in the unit with
the highest MMA concentration in air (5× higher than in other units)
reported using nail polish a few times a week, while the occupant in the
unit with the highest source rate for 13DC2P reported having many new
pieces of upholstered furniture, including a couch, upholstered chairs,
and upholstered dining chairs. However, levels of other flame re-
tardants were not as elevated in this unit.
Mixed-source chemicals in the second group (levels increased in air
with occupancy but decreased on wipes) included plastics chemical
diisononyl phthalate (DINP), a higher molecular weight phthalate, and
flame retardants tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and triphenyl
phosphate (TPHP). One possible explanation for the increase in air
concentrations and decrease in mass loadings for these chemicals is that
they were all present in the floor or floor finish and that the mass
loading decreased on surface wipes over time with cleaning and ev-
eryday wear. Indeed, the surface wipe mass loadings of DINP were 2 to
3 orders of magnitude higher than other phthalates we targeted and
200× higher at the median than in the AHHS (Hagan et al., 2014). The
increase in DINP air concentrations post-occupancy may also reflect
occupants bringing in vinyl products such as shower curtains. Increases
in air concentrations of TBOEP and TPHP may be a result of their use in
products and furnishings brought in by the occupant. TBOEP is used in
plastics (van der Veen and de Boer, 2012) and TPHP, for which the
increase was statistically significant (Table S2), is used in both foam
furniture (Stapleton et al., 2009) and nail polish (Mendelsohn et al.,
2016).
3.2. Implications for health
Of the 16 targeted chemicals with U.S. EPA risk-based screening
levels for indoor air (Table S4), measured concentrations of 6 chemicals
exceeded these risk-based levels during post-occupancy. Forty-four
targeted VOCs and SVOCs did not have available screening levels. All
units had formaldehyde indoor air concentrations that exceeded the
carcinogenic screening level of 0.22 μg/m3. At least 69% of units had
indoor air concentrations of benzene that exceeded the carcinogenic
target risk level of 0.36 μg/m3. The likely source is benzene from ga-
soline and vehicle pollution entering from outdoors. The post-occu-
pancy concentrations of ethylbenzene in four homes slightly exceeded
screening levels for residential air. The MRL for chloroform (4.7 μg/m3)
is higher than the target risk level of 0.12 μg/m3; therefore, the one unit
with detectable levels of chloroform post-occupancy exceeded the
screening level. One unit had ethyl acetate and perchloroethylene levels
above available screening levels.
A few of the chemicals we detected were banned or are associated
with banned activities. Specifically, we detected pesticide propoxur, a
California Proposition 65 carcinogen (CA OEHHA, 2017g) that has not
been approved for residential use since 2007 (U.S. EPA, 2007), on pre-
occupancy kitchen floor wipes in these units, which were renovated in
2013. Another pesticide, diazinon, banned from home use in 2004
because of neurodevelopmental effects in children (Eskenazi et al.,
1999), was found on kitchen floor wipes in one unit pre- and post-oc-
cupancy (pre-occupancy detect was tentative, see Fig. S6). The ob-
served post-occupancy increase in air concentrations of flame retardant
BDE 47, phased out of use in upholstered furniture in 2005 (Dodson
et al., 2012b), highlights a potential issue of legacy pollutants in older
and possibly second-hand furniture owned by lower income residents.
We also detected nicotine in 44% of post-occupancy samples despite a
smoking ban in Boston public housing. This is consistent with our other
findings that show measurable levels of airborne nicotine following the
ban (MacNaughton et al., 2016).
We detected several chemicals associated with allergy and asthma;
for example, formaldehyde (McGwin et al., 2010), particulate matter
(Khreis et al., 2017), fragrances (Steinemann, 2009), triclosan (Savage
et al., 2014), pesticides diazinon (Eskenazi et al., 1999) and PiPBo
(Nishino et al., 2013), and phthalates (Bornehag et al., 2004). These
findings are especially relevant in our study community. For example,
our recent survey-based study of families living in Boston public
housing showed that 21% of adults self-reported as having asthma
(Colton et al., 2015).
3.3. Implications for building design and use
Our results also have implications for how new or renovated re-
sidential buildings are designed. For example, strategies to reduce
chemicals exposures in the home should broaden the scope beyond the
current focus on VOCs. Our data suggest that architects and contractors
need to consider phthalates, flame retardants, and phenolic compounds
such as benzophenone and nonylphenol in material specifications.
Active consumer campaigns such as those for flame retardants in up-
holstered furniture could enhance their impact by considering building
materials, such as insulation, as well, given that our data indicate these
chemicals are introduced even before furnishings are present. We also
found propoxur and naphthalene on floor wipes prior to occupancy,
suggesting that these chemicals are either used during renovation or
tracked in. Further development of safer, low-cost alternatives that
meet the same performance standards is urgently needed so that they
can be implemented in affordable housing units under construction or
planned for construction.
With regard to building use, our data indicate that occupant edu-
cation campaigns have the potential to reduce predominant exposure
sources in the home for several chemicals. For example, purchasing
personal care and cleaning products without synthetic fragrance will
reduce exposures to chemicals linked with asthma, respiratory symp-
toms and hormone disruption (Dodson et al., 2012a). Based on the
skewness of the concentration distributions of some chemicals–such as
DEP–it is apparent that some occupants have fairly unique product use
behaviors that contribute substantially to their exposures. Further in-
vestigation of those chemicals with higher concentrations in a few units
provides an opportunity for source identification and targeted inter-
vention. However the onus to reduce exposures should not rest solely
on the occupant as there may not always be affordable alternatives.
Instead, stronger policies and regulations upstream of the consumer are
needed to ensure that consumers are not purchasing products con-
taining chemicals with known health effects or that have not been
thoroughly tested for safety.
3.4. Limitations
This study, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind to measure SVOC
and VOC concentrations before and after occupancy in newly renovated
low-income housing. It provides a first look at the impact of the occu-
pant relative to the impact of the building materials on indoor ex-
posures. Because our study took place in one renovated housing de-
velopment, our study is ideal for evaluating occupant-related effects;
however, this limits the generalizability of findings related to the
building-related chemicals since our categorization likely reflects spe-
cific materials used in this development's renovation. We also collected
pre- and post-measurements in different seasons because of delayed
recruiting, making the seasonal effects, including temperature and AER,
hard to disentangle.
We collected a smaller number of pre-occupancy samples because
we hypothesized a priori that the variability in chemical levels would
be low. While variability appeared to increase with occupancy as we
expected, it was larger than expected pre-occupancy given the
R.E. Dodson et al.
Environment International xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
11
 similarity of the units located in one housing development. It is possible
that the pre-occupancy levels reflect chemical sources that are not di-
rectly building material-related. For example, chemicals – including
personal care product chemicals such as fragrances – could have been
introduced by building staff accessing the units after the renovations
were complete. Except for the three townhouses, all of these units were
located in multi-unit buildings and pre-occupancy levels may also re-
flect air infiltration from other units (Dodson et al., 2007b). Contribu-
tions from other units are likely only relevant for measured air con-
centrations and not wipe levels.
Our unique study design included a limited set of samples from
paired pre- and post-occupancy units (n = 7). While our study re-
presents some of the first examples of paired pre-and post-occupancy
measurements, the small sample size may limit the stability of our
model estimates. One or a few data points could have an exaggerated
influence on the results, so the model estimates and p-values should be
treated with caution.
In identifying occupants' contribution to indoor air quality, we as-
sumed that measured concentrations related to off-gassing from
building material sources would decrease over time as a result of de-
gradation and ventilation out of the unit. Further, we assumed that by
the time of our post-occupancy sampling, chemical levels were at
steady state, and levels would not increase due to further off-gassing.
However, it is possible that the levels had not reached steady state and
that even if the units had been left undisturbed – that is, if no residents
had moved in – we still would have observed an increase in levels until
they reached steady state.
4. Conclusion
Reduction of exposures to chemicals in homes requires multi-fa-
ceted approaches that acknowledge the various factors driving their use
and resulting exposures in the home. These approaches must consider
both design and behavior and must involve designers, occupants, and
building management. For example, reducing use of fragranced pro-
ducts in the home will help to reduce levels of DEP, but this chemical
may also be present in other products such as insecticides and building
materials, including paints and adhesives. Integrated Pest Management
(IPM), an approach shown to control pests without relying on the
routine application of pesticides in multi-family housing, embraces this
type of multi-level approach (Brenner et al., 2003; Scammell et al.,
2011). Subsidized housing may be particularly suited for these multi-
faceted approaches since building and property management is cen-
tralized and can effectively engage with and educate tenants about best
practices for proper maintenance and mitigation of in-unit pollutant
exposures.
