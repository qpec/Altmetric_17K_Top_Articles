Abstract
17
Allergenic pollen is produced by the flowers of a number of trees, grasses and weeds found throughout the UK. Expo-
18
sure to such pollen grains can exacerbate pollen-related asthma and allergenic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay
19
fever). Maps showing the location of these allergenic taxa have many applications: they can be used to provide advice
20
on risk assessments; combined with health data to inform research on health impacts such as respiratory hospital ad-
21
missions; combined with weather data to improve pollen forecasting systems; or as inputs to pollen emission models.
22
In this study we present 1 km resolution maps of 12 taxa of trees, grass and weeds found in the UK. We have selected
23
the main species recorded by the UK pollen network. The taxa mapped in this study were: Alnus (alder), Fraxinus
24
(ash), Betula (birch), Corylus (hazel), Quercus (oak), Pinus (pine) and Salix (willow), Poaceae (grass), Artemisia
25
(mugwort), Plantago (plantain), Rumex (dock, sorrels) and Urtica (nettle). We also focus on one high population cen-
26
tre and present maps showing local level detail around the city of London. Our results show the different geographical
27
distributions of the 12 taxa of trees, weeds and grass, which can be used to study plants in the UK associated with
28
allergy and allergic asthma. These maps have been produced in order to study environmental exposure and human
29
health, although there are many possible applications. This novel method not only provides maps of many different
30
plant types, but also at high resolution across regions of the UK, and uniquely present 12 key plant taxa using a con-
31
sistent methodology. To consider the impact on human health due to exposure of the pollen grains, it is important to
32
consider the timing of pollen release, and its dispersal, as well as the effect on air quality, which is also discussed here.

 1. Introduction
35
Allergenic pollen is produced by a number of trees, grasses and weeds found throughout the United Kingdom
36
(UK). Exposure to such pollen grains can result in exacerbation of pollen-related asthma and allergenic conditions
37
such as allergic rhinitis (pollenosis or hay fever)(Greiner et al., 2012). With the total effect of future environmental
38
changes on pollen production and spread being highly uncertain (Osborne and Eggen, 2014), there is a need for
39
detailed and robust pollen-related health impact information. Highly detailed maps of locations of allergenic plants
40
in the UK, as presented here, are an important part of this as they provide the spatial detail required for impact
41
assessments. Such maps will be highly useful for the next generation co-exposure modelling system currently under
42
development for the UK area. This system is based on an extension of WRF-Chem model (e.g. Grell et al. (2011)) and
43
is designed for handling both chemical air pollutants (e.g. Werner et al. (2016, 2017)) and bioaerosols (e.g. pollen and
44
spores) at the species level (Skjøth et al., 2015a) where both chemical air pollutants and bioaerosols directly interact
45
with and feedbacks to atmospheric physics.
46
The UK has one of the highest prevalence of doctor diagnosed asthma affecting around 10% of the adult population
47
(Netuveli et al., 2005). Approximately 80% of people with asthma also have a pollen allergy (Asthma UK, 2017). The
48
NHS Choice website states that over 10 million people have hay fever in England (NHS Choices, 2017). Physician-
49
based diagnosis of allergic rhinitis 13.2% (95% CI 11.6-14.9) in the UK in 2001 (Bauchau and Durham, 2004).
50
Detailed maps of allergenic pollen producing taxa, in combination with pollen forecasts and calendars, can help
51
sufferers to manage their condition by reducing their exposure. Asthma and allergic rhinitis signifi
cantly reduce
52
quality of life and have a large economic impact (Bousquet et al., 2001). As such, it is a signifi
cant environmental
53
health issue.
54
Our method is novel as it not only provides maps of many different plant types, but also at high resolution across
55
regions of the UK. These maps fi
ll a need for detailed vegetation mapping of allergenic plant species across a whole
56
country, to improve understanding of relationships between allergenic pollen exposure and human health outcomes.
57
With an initial assessment of data availability and expertise on plant types and land cover, the method presented here
58
could be duplicated for other locations around the world.
59
In this paper we present detailed maps of location of different taxa monitored by the UK pollen network that
60
are associated with allergy and allergic asthma. These have been made to study environmental exposure and human
61
health, although these new vegetation maps have many possible applications as outlined in the following section.
62
1.1. Purpose of this work and wider context
63
Vegetation maps have many applications worldwide: they can be used to provide advice on risk assessments,
64
e.g. on invasive species (for example Csornai et al. (2011)); combined with health data to inform research on health
65
impacts such as respiratory hospital admissions caused by exposure of environmental aeroallergens (Newson et al.,
66
2014; Bousquet et al., 2007); combined with weather data to improve pollen forecasting systems (e.g. Zink et al.
67
(2012)); or as inputs to dedicated pollen emission models (Zink et al., 2013).
68

 Vegetation maps have many applications worldwide: they can be used to provide advice on risk assessments;
69
combined with health data to inform research on health impacts such as respiratory hospital admissions;
70
The vegetation maps presented here have been developed to study human exposure to allergenic pollen, and the
71
effect on human health. They can be combined with hospital admissions data for asthma to study the impact of
72
different allergenic taxa in the UK. By producing detailed maps of the location of allergenic pollen producing plants
73
for the UK it may be possible to identify the taxa that increase risk of higher hospital admissions for asthma in that
74
particular region. This level of detail could help with the accurate measurement of health impacts as well as monitoring
75
for climate impacts through changes in vegetation distribution, and changes to pollen allergenicity.
76
Vegetation mapping of plants with allergenic pollen may also help affected individuals with self-management of
77
their allergy or asthma. Once linked with health effects, another application of these maps will be to provide advice
78
for vegetation management practices. These practices can include the choice of tree species, sex of tree for planting,
79
and grass cutting regimes to limit exposure to the most allergenic pollen.
80
Detailed maps of the location of pollen producing plants are also key to a future pollen forecasting system. Maps
81
can be coupled with key weather variables such as wind direction and speed, precipitation, humidity and temperature,
82
and both phenological and dispersion models, to predict the emission timing, amount (Skjøth et al., 2012) and disper-
83
sion of pollen grains, to provide more spatially and temporally resolved pollen forecasts for the UK, compared to the
84
existing regression based approaches for trees (Adams-Groom et al., 2002), grasses (e.g. Smith and Emberlin (2005,
85
2006)) and weeds.
86
1.2. Health impacts of allergenic pollen
87
Exposure to allergenic pollen from certain trees, grasses and weeds is associated with a range of health effects, in-
88
cluding allergic rhinitis (hay fever), exacerbation of asthma in susceptible individuals, and atopic dermatitis (eczema)
89
(Cecchi, 2012). These pollen grains are produced in the flowers of angiosperm plants (e.g. most deciduous trees,
90
weeds and grasses), and in the pollen cones of gymnosperm plants (e.g. conifer trees), and the timing of their re-
91
lease varies depending on the species and environmental conditions. Susceptible individuals can be sensitive to pollen
92
from one or more different type of trees, grasses or weeds. Estimates of the levels of allergies towards environmental
93
aeroallergens (pollen, spores and cat/dog/house dust mites) among patients range typically from up to 30%-50% in
94
Europe (Newson et al., 2014), where the largest fractions of sensitisations towards specifi
c pollen typically are against
95
grasses and trees of the Betulaceae family with clinically relevant sensitisation rates for grasses exceeding 50% for
96
both UK and Denmark (e.g. Burbach et al. (2009)).
97
1.3. Background to allergenic vegetation mapping
98
Here we outline methods used in the literature to produce spatial maps detailing the location of vegetation that
99
emits allergenic pollen, often referred to as pollen source maps, or inventories (Skjøth et al., 2012). ‘Bottom up’
100
and ‘top down’ approaches to creating pollen source location maps are outlined in Skjøth et al. (2012). ‘Bottom up’
101
3
 techniques start with the location and amount of the pollutant — they combine land cover maps with regional scale
102
statistics, for example as used in Skjøth et al. (2008). Availability of these regional scale statistics is what limits
103
this approach, for example statistical information on the regional abundance of weeds and certain taxa is largely not
104
available. Many sources exist which refer to the presence or absence of a particular plant type or species, but not
105
their abundance, and these rarely cover a whole area, for example the size of the UK. ‘Top down’ inventories start
106
with a measured quantity and work backwards using models to calculate the distribution. They use station based
107
pollen monitoring observations along with land cover maps, for example Skjøth et al. (2012) which uses data from
108
the European Aeroallergen Network (EAN). Geographic and temporal coverage of monitoring stations are however
109
limiting factors of ‘top down’ methodologies. Existing pollen mapping includes tree source maps at 50 km × 50 km
110
resolution (Skjøth et al., 2008) and Ambrosia (ragweed) source inventories for different European locations (Skjøth
111
et al., 2010; Thibaudon et al., 2014; Karrer et al., 2015). Statistical mapping of trees over Europe at 1 km × 1 km
112
resolution is presented in Brus et al. (2011). Skjøth et al. (2015b) used back-trajectories of pollen observations to
113
create footprint areas of Alnus (alder) and Betula (birch) in Worcester. Remote sensing can also be used such as
114
Skjøth et al. (2013) who created a grass pollen inventory in Aarhus (Denmark) using GIS and remote sensing.
115
The quality of the mapping is dependent on resolution and taxa specifi
city of available input datasets. High
116
resolution inputs can provide a challenge for handling large volumes of data, and lower resolution inputs may be
117
easier to obtain, but can miss important spatial detail.
118
In this paper we present a novel set of maps of key plants associated with allergy and allergic asthma in the UK.
119
They are provided at higher resolution coverage than currently available elsewhere in the literature, use a state-of-the-
120
art tree dataset (Bluesky, National Tree Map, 2015) for highly accurate tree locations, and uniquely present 12 key
121
plant taxa (monitored by the UK pollen network), using a consistent methodology.
122
2. Materials and methods
123
2.1. Selection of allergenic vegetation
124
Tree and weed taxa and grasses were selected which were monitored by the UK pollen network (run by the Met
125
Office (Met Office, 2017b)), where the majority are considered medium to highly allergenic, and for which datasets
126
could be produced covering Great Britain. As these include either species i.e. Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore) or
127
genera i.e. Alnus (alder), for clarity in the following text we will refer to all as ‘taxa’.
128
A summary of the availability of tree taxa information present in the Forestry Commission’s National Forest
129
Inventory (Forestry Commission, Great Britain, 2011), and the Trees in Towns II report (Britt and Johnston, 2008) —
130
both of which were used in this study is given in Table 1. The seven tree taxa which had data availability that were
131
selected to be studied in this paper, are indicated in bold font in Table 1. Note that the seven selected tree taxa include
132
those which were reported to be most allergenic by the review by de Weger et al. (2012) — Corylus (hazel), Alnus
133
4
 (alder), Betula (birch) and Quercus (oak) — excluding Platanus (plane) and those allergenic but not prevalent in the
134
UK, Olea (olive) and Cupressaceae (cypress).
135
All grasses, Poaceae, were considered together as the current UK pollen monitoring observations are unable to
136
delineate between the various species, also very little is known about which species of grass are most allergenic in
137
the UK. Note that, in Europe, grass pollen is the most important pollen allergen due to both its large distribution in
138
Europe (Skjøth et al., 2012) and its record high sensitisation rates among patients (Burbach et al., 2009).
139
The fi
nal group of taxa looked at fall into the category of ‘weeds’. The National Pollen and Aerobiological
140
Research Unit (University of Worcester) identify fi
ve plants in this category, all of which are monitored in the UK
141
as part of the pollen network: Rumex (dock, sorrels), Artemisia (mugwort), Urtica (nettle), Plantago (plantain) and
142
Brassica napus (oil seed rape). Oil seed rape is planted in the UK for agriculture, and due to a lack of detailed mapping
143
information on the spatial abundance of it in the UK, we omitted this plant from this study.
144
Summarising, the 12 selected taxa from the UK pollen network mapped in this study were as follows. Trees:
145
Alnus (alder), Fraxinus (ash), Betula (birch), Corylus (hazel), Quercus (oak), Pinus (pine) and Salix (willow). Grass:
146
Poaceae (bulk grass, not species specifi
c). Weeds: Artemisia (mugwort), Plantago (plantain), Rumex (dock, sorrels)
147
and Urtica (nettle).
148
2.2. Grass mapping methodology
149
The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Land Cover Map 2007 (hereafter LCM 2007) is a 25 m resolution
150
raster map of Great Britain which shows land cover using 23 different classifi
cations (Morton et al., 2011). This was
151
used to create the grass map in this study. Land cover classes where grasses are predominantly found were selected.
152
The six grassland classes used are shown in Table 2. Note that some other categories — namely, Arable, Urban and
153
Suburban (classes 3, 22 and 23 respectively) are likely to contain some grass, but due to a lack of detailed spatial
154
information these areas have not been included. These were not selected for this study. See Centre for Ecology &
155
Hydrology, UK (2011) for full description of the land cover classes and their habitats. Raster masks of the selected
156
categories were made and applied using a script written in the programming language Python (Python Software
157
Foundation, 2017). This resulted in a 25 m raster map showing only grassland areas. The grass map was then
158
regridded to 1 km resolution and converted to percentage cover, using the spatial analyst toolbox in software ArcGIS
159
Desktop version 10 (ESRI, 2017).
160
2.3. Weed mapping methodology
161
Statistical information on the regional abundance of allergenic weeds is not consistently available accross the UK.
162
Hence, we have developed a method based on that used by Skjøth et al. (2010); Kaye and Burgess (2013); Thibaudon
163
et al. (2014) and Karrer et al. (2015) which uses land cover map classes and input of expert plant knowledge to fi
lter
164
for habitat selection. Here we used expert elicitation to determine the suitability of a habitat (land cover class) for each

weed. The type of expert elicitation used was ‘behavioural aggregation’ — group decision making — where experts
166
pooled knowledge (O’Hagan et al., 2006) to reach a consensus.
167
Three experts with documented specialist knowledge on the selected weeds were chosen and each provided their
168
individual independent assessment of ‘habitat suitability’ and percentage cover of the weeds in each land class cat-
169
egory of the LCM 2007 dataset. For each taxon, each expert scored each land class 0,1 or 2 — 0 indicated that
170
the habitat was not suitable for this taxon, 1 that the habitat was mildly suitable, and 2 that it was a largely suitable
171
habitat. Using this ‘habitat suitability’ indicator as a guide, the experts then individually and independently assigned
172
an estimate of ‘fractional cover’ for that taxon in that habitat. For example, for a habitat suitability of ‘2’ (largely
173
suitable habitat) of Plantago in land class ‘urban’, each expert estimated a typical area coverage in that land area of
174
Plantago. Following a similar approach to the ‘Delphi method’ (O’Hagan et al., 2006), each expert fi
rst provided
175
their own independent assessment. This was then supplied to all the other experts in the group, and the experts were
176
given the chance to update their assessment. The experts were also asked to make any relevant notes regarding land
177
classes and these taxa, in order to capture any key aspects to take into account with the mapping. After having the
178
independent assessments from each expert, the experts then collaboratively reached a fi
nal value for the percentage
179
cover estimates (‘behavioural aggregation’). The experts collectively discussed each weed taxon and came to a joint
180
agreement on value for each percentage cover in each of the land classes. Values of percentage cover for typical 25 m
181
× 25 m grid box of each land class ranged between: mugwort 0-0.1%; plantain 0-5.0%; Rumex 0-2.0%; nettle 0-1.0%.
182
A 25 m percentage cover map was created for each of the four weeds, by using ‘reclassify’ tool in ArcGIS to apply
183
taxa coverage to different land classifi
cations. The 25 m map was then aggregated to 1 km using the same technique
184
used for grass, as described above.
185
Note that there are differing numbers of taxon in each genus and that each of these will vary in terms of their
186
relative abundance by land class. This will not overly affect the outcomes as most of the species are either rare
187
or not present in the UK. For example, there are 57 species of Artemisia in the north temperate regions (Grewling
188
et al., 2012), but only A. vulgaris (mugwort), A. campestris (fi
eld wormwood) and A. absinthium (wormwood) are
189
7
 widespread throughout Europe. The online Atlas of the British and Irish flora lists 10 different Artemisia species, but
190
only wormwood and mugwort have widespread records. A consequence is that the vast majority of pollen related to a
191
specifi
c genera will originate from a few common species.
192
2.4. Tree mapping methodology
193
A high resolution tree map was used to build a base map of all tree locations. Scaling factors were created which
194
accounted for the proportion of broadleaf and conifer trees at different locations. Finally, regional taxa fractions were
195
applied. The fi
nal taxa maps were created by combining all of these data. This combination can be described in the
196
following way to calculate the number of trees of a given taxon in a grid box:
197
Ttaxon = αtaxon × β × Tall ,
(1)
where Tall is the total number of all trees in a grid box, αtaxon is the fraction of that taxon found in that grid box
198
(a function of region/urban area), and β is the scaling factor for broadleaf/conifer abundance in a given land type (a
199
function of region and also different for broadleaf/conifer taxa).
200
The method used to assign each of these terms is described in detail below.
201
2.4.1. Base map, Tall
202
The Bluesky International, National Tree Map (Bluesky, National Tree Map (2015), hereafter NTM) is a dataset
203
built from high resolution aerial photography and remote sensing, and contains the location, height and canopy/crown
204
extents for every single tree which is over 3 m in height. NTM does not contain any species-level or taxon information
205
for the trees. It covers England and Wales in extent. The dataset is provided as a vector GIS dataset, with height and
206
area attributes for each tree. The number of trees (count) in 25 m × 25 m grid cells was calculated from the NTM
207
dataset using a Python script, with the grid aligned to that of the Forestry Commission dataset. This map formed a
208
‘base map’ which showed the locations of all trees (over 3 m), to which taxon fractions would be applied. This base
209
map provides the value of Tall in Eq. 1, the total number of all trees in a given grid box.
210
2.4.2. Taxon fractions, αtaxon
211
Regional measures of taxa totals in Great Britain are presented by the Forestry Commission for broadleaved trees
212
(Brewer, 2013) and coniferous trees (Forestry Commission, Great Britain, 2012). To calculate taxa fractions in forests
213
for the broadleaved taxa, data from Number of trees by principal broadleaved species for National Forest Inventory
214
regions Brewer (2013, Table A.7) were used to calculate the proportion of each taxon as a fraction of total number of
215
‘all broadleaves’. A measure of the number of trees per taxon per region was not available for coniferous taxa, and
216
so taxon fractions for pine were instead calculated using the timber volume measure. Data from Standing coniferous
217
timber volume by principal species for National Forest Inventory regions Forestry Commission, Great Britain (2012,
218
Table 9) were used to calculate the proportion of pine as fraction of total volume of ‘all conifers’ in forests. In urban

N.B. Corylus (hazel) was not included in Figure 2.18, and so a taxa fraction for hazel was obtained from Britt and Johnston (2008,

areas, tree taxa fractions were calculated using Trees in Towns II report Britt and Johnston (2008, Figure 2.18), a
220
large study of urban trees carried out in towns with populations over 3000. The distribution of taxa in towns differed
221
sufficiently from the forest data that we used these taxa fractions in urban areas. Note that Corylus (hazel) was not
222
included in this Figure 2.18, and so a fraction for hazel was obtained from Britt and Johnston (2008, Table 2.8), other
223
fractions calculated from Figure 2.18. The remaining areas — those which were neither forest, nor towns — were
224
grouped as the ‘elsewhere’ category, and in these areas the Forestry Commission taxa fractions, as calculated for
225
forests were used. We considered Countryside Survey data (Maskell et al., 2013) which contained some data on some
226
of the key allergenic taxa in non-forested countryside areas. However, it did not have sufficient information for us to

calculate taxa fractions1. Table 3 presents a summary of the sources of taxa fraction data for broadleaf and conifer
228
trees in different land types (forests, urban, elsewhere). Also shown is spatial variation (fi
nal column) of these taxa
229
data — which is regional for all but the urban data.
230
The values of taxon fraction described above provide the value of αtaxon in Eq. 1, the fraction of a given taxon in
231
a grid box.
232
2.4.3. Scaling factor, β
233
A ‘scaling factor’ was necessary to account for the fact that many of the taxa fractions were available as a pro-
234
portion of either all broadleaves or all coniferous taxa, and not as a proportion of total number of trees. Differing
235
1Although the Countryside Survey had estimates of areas covered by the above taxa, and upper and lower confi
dence limits on those, it does not
provide, as the Trees in Towns did, either an ‘everything else’ category for trees beyond the ‘principal species’, nor does it give the total amount of
coverage of all trees, so it is not possible to calculate accurate taxa fractions.

 proportions of broadleaf and conifer trees are found in different land types and forest types, and so these classifi
-
236
cations were used to scale the tree map in different areas, depending on whether the tree type being mapped was
237
classed as broadleaved (alder, ash, birch, hazel, oak and willow) or coniferous (pine). The scaling for broadleaved or
238
coniferous trees in different land types is outlined below.
239
Forest boundaries from Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory (NFI) map (25 m × 25 m resolution;
240
Forestry Commission, Great Britain (2011)) were used to defi
ne forested areas. Four NFI interpreted forest types
241
were used: broadleaf; mixed mainly broadleaf; mixed mainly conifer; conifer. Table 4 shows the NFI interpreted
242
forest types, the range of broadleaf and conifer trees expected in each (as defi
ned by Forestry Commission, Great
243
Britain (2011)) and the scale factors, β used for each, for broadleaf and conifer trees.
244
LCM 2007 ‘urban’ and ‘suburban’ classes were used to defi
ne urban areas. They were selected to be continuous
245
areas ≥50 ha in size, with populations ≥3000 (selected using Office of National Statistics (Office of National Statistics,
246
2017) population dataset), not defi
ned as forest in the NFI forestry dataset, and not a thin motorway or airport type
247
infrastructure. Because the Trees In Towns II report used for taxa data included urban parks (for example Regent Park,
248
London) these were included in the urban category here, by including any areas which were completely surrounded
249
by urban/suburban land classes. In Trees In Towns II, each taxa is given as a proportion of all trees, and so no scaling
250
factor is needed (i.e. a multiplicative scaling factor of value 1 was used), as shown in Table 4.
251
The remaining areas — those which were neither forest, nor towns — were grouped as the ‘elsewhere’ category. A
252
calculation of broadleaf and conifer proportions was carried out, using data from Forestry Commission, Great Britain
253
(2011, Table 3). Values of total area (ha) of broadleaf and conifer trees were used and a relative proportion of each
254
calculated from this. Because of the regional differences seen in the forestry data, the highest resolution data available
255
were used for this — in this case England and Wales (rather than GB as a whole). The result was 71% broadleaf and
256
29% conifer in England, and 48% broadleaf and 52% conifer in Wales. These values were used as the scaling factor,
257
β for ‘elsewhere’ areas, as shown in the last two rows of Table 4.
258
2.4.4. Combining to create final maps
259
For each of the individual tree taxa, the base map, scaling factor and taxa fractions were combined as illustrated
260
in Figure 1. Note that our tree maps cover England and Wales only because of the data availability of Bluesky NTM.
261
This fi
gure demonstrates the spatial variation in each of the values of the components of Eq. 1 — with the scale factor
262
being a function of land type (i.e. type of forest, and variation in ‘elsewhere’ category in England and Wales) and
263
the proportions of broadleaf/conifers expected there, and the taxa fraction being a function of region and urban areas.
264
The base tree map has a lot of spatial structure, and is in units of number of trees per grid box, the same units as the
265
resulting taxon map. These maps were then regridded to 1 km × 1 km resolution, for comparison with other data and
266
be more manageable in size.

Table 4: National Forest Inventory interpreted forest types and range of areas covered by broadleaf and conifer trees in these
categories (‘broadleaf cover’, ‘conifer cover’). Note that forest type ‘mixed (b)’ denotes a forest with mixture of broadleaf and
conifer trees, but with majority broadleaf. Similarly ‘mixed (c)’ contains mixed trees, mainly conifer. Also shown is the scale
factor β assigned to each forest/land type, and value of this scale factor for broadleaf and conifer trees (fi
nal two columns). The
taxa fraction in urban areas is calculated as a proportion of all trees, and so no scaling factor is needed (i.e. a multiplicative
scaling factor of value 1 was used). Land types ‘elsewhere (E)’ and ‘elsewhere (W)’ denote whether the ‘elsewhere’ (non-forest,
non-urban) area was in England or in Wales respectively, as differing broadleaf/conifer proportions were used.
2.5. Alternative datasets and areas
268
In this study we used datasets which are specifi
c to the UK, or parts of it. In order to apply our methodology to
269
different geographical areas, one must identify suitable input datasets. We recommend that one assesses the relevant
270
merits of land use datasets (land classifi
cations) in the desired area of study. Things to consider when selecting a land
271
use dataset would be accuracy, age, resolution and coverage of the dataset, as well as any specifi
c merits / caveats
272
of each dataset which might relate to the specifi
c type of vegetation being studied. Some examples of large land
273
use datasets are Corine (Corine, 2017, 100 m resolution, covering most of Europe;), ESA Landcover map (ESA,
274
2017, 300 m resolution, global coverage), IGBP (2017), and land cover data from satellite observations such as SPOT
275
VEGETATION (Spot Vegetation, 2017) and MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (2017). Similarly, one must assess
276
the availability and quality of forestry or tree information, and also that of taxon information provided at a regional
277
(or higher) level. One such dataset which is available over Europe is the European Forest Inventory (EFI) dataset
278
(Schelhaas et al., 2006) which has taxa level maps at 1 km resolution. In this study we considered the EFI but found
279
the EFI total tree map (all taxa) differed signifi
cantly from the Bluesky International NTM dataset on tree location,
280
which we believed to be a more accurate indication of tree location due to its methodology. For this reason we used
281
just the NTM dataset in further analysis. Thus caution would be urged if using EFI in place of a higher resolution and
282
11

more accurate tree dataset (e.g. up-to-date aerial or satellite based dataset with a common methodology across the
283
dataset), as it will affect the quality of the resulting maps.
284
We note that without access to such a high resolution dataset such as the Bluesky International NTM dataset on
285
tree location, this will have an impact on the quality of the resulting maps. One must consider changing the resolution
286
of the fi
nal maps with respect to the quality of the input maps, and not provide higher resolution maps than the data
287
reasonably allow. This judgement must be made by those familiar with land cover and vegetation datasets and their
288
strengths and weaknesses, and considering what the fi
nal maps will be used for.
289
For this reason we have not produced tree taxon maps in Scotland where the Bluesky International NTM maps were
290
not available. This decision was made because we wanted to use a consistent methodology and produce consistent
291
output such that the provided taxon maps could be used for human health studies.
292
3. Results
293
Here we present 1 km gridded maps of the 12 selected taxa.
294
3.1. Grass map
295
Figure 2 shows the resulting Poaceae (grass) location map (percentage coverage), gridded at 1 km resolution, for
296
Great Britain. The colourbar shows equal sized quantiles. An overall pattern of higher percentage cover of grass in the
297
northern and western regions of Great Britain, and lower overall cover to the south east can be seen. High mountainous
298
regions in Scotland show lower levels of grass cover than their surrounding lower lying areas. The eastern central area
299
of England has the lowest percentage grass coverage, while Wales and north west England, and western Scotland have
300
the highest density of grass coverage. Note that these maps show the vegetation location of grass, and not of the pollen
301
concentration, we discuss how different factors affect the spread of pollen grains in Section 4.

 3.2. Weed maps
303
Figure 3 shows the location maps (percentage coverage) for the four selected weed taxa, gridded at 1 km resolution,
304
for Great Britain with quantile based colourbars, allowing a comparison of the relative locations of each taxon across
305
Great Britain. Note that the total quantities are different for each weed taxon. The same fi
gure without quantile-based
306
colourbars are shown in the Supplementary materials, Figure A.8. Dock (Rumex, includes dock and sorrels) is fairly
307
evenly distributed across Great Britain, with no overall north/south or east/west trend. It is not abundant in urban areas,
308
or in high altitudes, and these areas can be seen in white and grey on the map. Nettle distribution display a generally
309
lower values of percentage cover than dock, and shows a north/west - south/east trend, with higher abundance in
310
southern and eastern Great Britain, largely a result of lower cover at higher altitude. Unlike dock, nettle has its highest
311
coverage in urban areas. Plantain is relatively evenly distributed across the whole of Great Britain, with highest areas
312
of coverage in urban areas. Mugwort has much lower general levels of coverage, reaching a maximum of only 0.1%.
313
Mugwort has a similar distribution to nettle, being found mostly in the south and eastern areas of Great Britain, and
314
in urban areas.
315
3.3. Tree maps
316
Tree taxon plots for the 7 tree taxa are shown in Figures 4 and 5. Units are in number of trees per 1 km × 1 km grid
317
square. These fi
gures have quantile based colourbars, allowing a comparison of the relative locations of each taxon in
318
England and Wales. Note that the total quantities are different for each tree taxon. The same fi
gures without quantile-
319
based colourbars are shown in the Supplementary materials Figures A.9 and A.10. Of the broadleaf trees, alder and
320
willow have the lowest number of trees, followed by oak and ash. Birch and hazel both have higher abundance in
321
terms of number of trees. Pine is the only conifer tree mapped in this study, and has much higher number of trees
322
than the broadleaves mapped here. In England, pine is the main conifer taxon found, and it is very abundant. The
323
pine map shows a different pattern of distribution to that of the broadleaves, notably a lack of pine in greater London
324
is seen, and less pine trees in Wales and western England. The highest concentrations of hazel are found in the south
325
east of England, and lowest values in the eastern area of England. Birch also has peaks in the south east of England.
326
The distributions of oak and ash are very similar to each other; while both the alder and willow maps show a peak in
327
western areas of England and Wales, as well as the south east of England. The results here are not directly comparable
328
with those in Skjøth et al. (2008), because our maps are much higher resolution, and include all trees — not only those
329
in forests.
330
3.4. Focus on high population centre
331
Maps showing the allergenic plant locations across areas of high population are valuable because the large number
332
of people living in these cities means that many are exposed to pollen from these plants. Figure 6 shows the percentage
333
cover of the four weed taxa, and grass, across greater London. Figure 7 presents the percentage cover of the 7
334
allergenic trees in this same area.

 The weed location maps in London show that dock is not nearly as abundant in the central area, while the other
336
weeds are more highly concentrated in the city. The grass map shows that there is less grass in central London, with
337
mixed values in the surrounding area. The tree maps show more variation between taxa. Notably pine stands out as
338
there is very little pine found in London, and while much higher values are seen in the surrounding area. Willow and
339
alder, are similar again, with fairly even levels of number of these taxa across the area. In the pine, hazel, birch and
340
oak maps, a peak can be seen south of the river just west of the centre of the map. This is a large green space in the
341
city (Richmond Park), containing many trees, and it shows up in these maps as an area with higher density of these
342
taxa.
343
4. Discussion
344
These maps of key allergenic tree, grass and weed taxa detail where these plants are located in the UK. They show
345
the different geographical distributions of the 12 taxa of trees, weeds and grass, and can be used to study plants in the
346
UK that are associated with allergy and allergic asthma. These have been made to study environmental exposure and
347
human health, although these new vegetation maps have many possible applications. Because the taxa mapped here
348
are all monitored by the UK pollen network, this would also allow further studies to compare to observational pollen
349
count data.
350
This novel method not only provides maps of many different plant types, but also at high resolution across England
351
and Wales, and Great Britain, and uniquely presents 12 key plant taxa using a consistent methodology.
352
We note that certain taxa are considered more important aeroallergens than others mapped in this study. We
353
highlight that the review by de Weger et al. (2012) found the following of our selected taxa highly allergenic: Corylus
354
(hazel), Alnus (alder), Betula (birch), Platanus (plane) and Quercus (oak), Poaceae (bulk grass, not species specifi
c),
355
Artemisia (mugwort). Of the remaining taxa that we have mapped, we note that Pinus (pine) is not considered to
356
be allergenic. Neither is Urtica (nettle), although it has pollen which cannot be distinguished microscopically from
357
Parietaria judaica (de Weger et al., 2012) which is a potential aeroallergen and is frequently recorded in southern
358
Britain. Thus care would need to be taken if comparing these maps to observational pollen counts that Parietaria
359
judaica pollen grains were not being misclassifi
ed as Urtica (nettle). Plantago (plantain) is thought to be only a
360
minor cause of hay fever in Europe and has some cross-reactivity with grass pollen (de Weger et al., 2012). Similarly,
361
Rumex (dock, sorrels) is not considered to be important aeroallergen. Salix (willow) is both wind pollinated and insect
362
pollinated, it has minimal importance as an aeroallergen, with the airborne pollen loads often low.
363
We also note that some sites in the pollen network does also keep a watch out for other pollen taxa / species
364
including Ambrosia (ragweed), due to it being very highly allergenic (Dahl et al., 1999). However, it is not a native
365
plant nor currently commonly found in the UK, although it is highly invasive and there is a risk it may spread to the
366
UK in future with changes to the climate and land use (Ziska et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013; Hamaoui-Laguel et al.,
367
2015; Pashley et al., 2015). As with other pollen, ragweed pollen has been shown to be transported long distances in

 the wind, and so areas with high concentrations of ragweed pollen in the air are more extensive than those where most
369
ragweed plants are located (Prank et al., 2013; Grewling et al., 2016; de Weger et al., 2016).
370
These maps fi
ll a need for spatially detailed vegetation mapping of allergenic plants across a country, the fi
rst
371
maps of their kind in the UK. Moreover, the method presented here could be duplicated for other locations around the
372
world, with an initial assessment of data availability and expertise on plant types and land cover.
373
4.1. Uncertainty and comparisons with other results
374
Validation of inventories is generally not possible as they must include all data before they can be considered
375
inventories. Common practice is therefore to discuss the main elements of uncertainty and compare the inventory
376
results with relevant data including previous inventories (e.g. Skjøth et al. (2008) **Simpson1999, Oderbolz et al,
377
2013**). We have followed the same procedure by including these aspects in the following two main subsections:
378
4.1.1. Uncertainty with respect to the input data
379
The Land Cover Map 2007 dataset, and the National Forestry Inventory (NFI) dataset are both widely used envi-
380
ronmental datasets, appearing in many other peer reviewed studies. Nevertheless they contain some limitations that
381
will affect some of the species. The LCM2007 data set is a remote sensing product with 20-30 m resolutions used as
382
input from several satellites such as Landsat and SPOT. A consequence is smaller units will not be mapped. This is
383
however of minor importance for most of the weeds as we have applied an ecosystem approach combined with expert
384
estimates to estimate the abundance of all weeds. However it will have an some impact on Artemisia as this species is
385
often found along roads and rivers (e.g. **Essl et al, 2009**). This weed will therefore have a larger uncertainty than
386
the others. LCM will also have an impact on the mapping of grass areas in urban areas as grass ecosystems often are
387
associated with road sides (Skjøth et al., 2013), that cannot be mapped using the LCM2007. Furthermore, it is known
388
that grasses are also found in croplands under rotation (e.g. timothy and rye grass) that were not included in this
389
study. These areas are found most abundantly in the eastern parts of England, where the mapping suggest to contain
390
low amounts of grass areas. The Trees in Towns II dataset was used for urban taxa fractions and is the result of a
391
very thorough study of urban trees across many towns and cities. However the information was only available as one
392
nation-wide statistical data set and public data for London suggests, that not all tree species are uniformly distributed
393
within the towns. However a UK study comparing the UK towns Torbay, Wrexham, Glasgow and Edinburgh (**Rum-
394
ble et al, 2015**) suggests that tree species distribution within the towns are relatively similar, most likely caused by
395
a similar planting practice and land use type and, to a smaller degree, climate. This indicates that urban data in this
396
study is relatively robust, while in-town variations as seen over London are more uncertain. Finally, the Bluesky NTM
397
datasets high resolution (individual tree level resolution) and mapping methodology means that we have confi
dence
398
in the gridded tree count we created from it. Bluesky quote that “Independent verifi
cation shows that NTM identifi
es
399
at least 95% of tree canopy”. This suggests that the loss of tree information is below 5% nationally as well as within
400
each 1km grid cell. This accuracy is much higher than other more coarse data satellite based landcover products (e.g.
401
21
 LCM2007, Corine Land Cover (CLC2000) or Globcover), that have shown to vary with with up to 50% in tree cover
402
and sometimes contain a direct misplacement of the tree resources (Skjøth et al., 2015b), CLC2000, which is much
403
lower. Hazel is in this respect a special case. Hazel is often found as as a bush or shrub in urban gardens and as an
404
important part in hedgerows. Neither of these sources can be expected to be mapped by the Bluesky data set due to
405
the 3 m limitation. Despite this limitation, then the application of the Bluesky data set has added a unique accuracy
406
to the tree resource, the urban areas in particular as the urban tree resource has never been mapped before within an
407
entire country.
408
4.1.2. Uncertainty with respect to species information and inventory method
409
The regional-level species information is what is likely to cause the largest uncertainties in our maps, here divided
410
into 13 different regions. These large geographical regions are not uniform in their distribution of species, but the
411
information is provided at this coarse scale, and as such this limits the quality of the species-level information within
412
these regions. Although the high-resolution tree database does mean that the locations of trees within these regions
413
is highly accurate, the exact distribution of the species on a fi
ne scale is less certain. Previous inventories of tree
414
species information over the UK included up to 65 regions (Skjøth et al., 2008) showing that distribution of important
415
species like birch is highly uneven in the UK with hotspots found in a few regions in South England (Surrey), central
416
England (west Midlands) and North England (e.g Cumbria), respectively. A consequence is that some regions in our
417
inventory will then have a lower quantity of birches than reality, while other regions will have a large quantity than
418
reality. However comparing with the maps in Skjøth et al. (2008) this seems to be mainly an issue for birch causing
419
additional uncertainties with more than a factor of two, while oak, and alders have a much more uniform distribution,
420
thereby not being affected by this uncertainty. Outside the main forests oak and ash trees are known to completely
421
dominate the small woodlands. A consequence as that our mapping will underestimate the abundance of these two
422
species in forest sparse regions such as the eastern parts of England, while the more forest dense regions will not be
423
affected. With respect to total numbers within all of UK it has previously been estimated that this error is only going
424
to have a minor importance for oak (Skjøth et al., 2015b), while the impact on ash remains to be investigated. The
425
use of national specialist in assessing weed abundance has with success been used for ragweed throughout Europe
426
(Thibaudon et al., 2014; Karrer et al., 2015). Here this approach has been expanded to cover several specialists, each
427
with their independent assessment. The main uncertainty in this element is likely to be the number of specialists,
428
where a larger number of specialists could provide a more detailed picture. This is also related to the input data, as
429
abundance of some species are related to land use (e.g. nettle and Artemisia) such as fertilization. The LCM2007 does
430
not include land use but only land cover. Including land use could therefore improve the information for weeds and at
431
the same time potentially also improve the information on grasses.
432
The maps over London for alder, ash, birch, hazel, oak, pine and willow (Figure 7) appear to be almost 100%
433
spatially correlated. This is related to the fact that the two main data sets for the urban mapping are the urban tree
434
statistics (where there is only one set of nation-wide numbers) and GPS coordinates for trees that do not distinguish
435
22
 between broadleaves/conifers or or individual tree species. A comparison with the public road trees data set of
436
London that contain 716406 tree locations provides following information (alder=10325, ash=40870, birch=34839,
437
hazel=5597, oak=36853, pine=6399, willow=9102, other=572421), which provides a different overall distribution
438
than Figure 7 (e.g. oak being more abundant than birch). This suggests that the urban maps for individual cities or
439
towns should be treated with caution while the overall national distribution according to **Rumble et al (2015)**
440
must be assumed to be alright. Improvements in this area could be obtained with nation-wide high resolution satellite
441
products that can distinguish between broadleaved and conifers and with town specifi
c tree species information. Some
442
of the allergenic species found in this inventory (e.g. hazel and mugwort) have never been mapped before. Comparison
443
with previous studies is therefore not possible. However a comparison of the mapping of oak, alder, birch and ash
444
with studies by Skjøth et al. (2015b) and Maskell et al. (2013) suggest that the patterns found throughout UK in this
445
study is similar to previous studies. This suggest that hazel, despite the limitations on not mapping hedgerows and
446
shrubs, will have similar quality as the other trees, thereby being unique not only for UK but the fi
rst of its kind in
447
Europe.
448
4.2. Relevance to public health
449
The maps presented here do not provide a forecast of pollen in the air at any one time, or human exposure, but
450
do provide the most likely locations of grass, tree and weed taxa that release allergenic pollen in Great Britain. The
451
allergenic taxa maps could provide information to local authorities and healthcare practitioners. They could be a useful
452
risk assessment tool to inform treatment or self-management of patients with long-term health conditions caused by
453
pollen allergy.
454
Hay fever and pollen-related asthma are only invoked by airborne pollen from allergenic plant taxa. To consider
455
the impact on human health due to exposure of the pollen grains, one must consider the timing of the pollen release,
456
and its dispersal. Along with the potential impact of climate change, air quality, changing allergenicity of pollen,
457
and possible mitigation options and their impact on public health, we discuss these important considerations in the
458
following sections.
459
4.2.1. Timing of release of pollen grains
460
A summary of the timing of peak pollen emissions (month of peak emissions) and emission strength categorised
461
by peak pollen count (number of grains per day) are given in Table 5. Results were calculated as averages of the day
462
of the year of peak emissions (presented by month) and peak pollen count (presented as categories) for each of the
463
species/taxa and across 9 sites in the UK pollen sampling network for the period 2006-2015. The categories for peak
464
pollen count (in units of number of grains per day) are as follows: Low = 0-10; Low-Med = 10-50; Med = 50-100;
465
Med-High = 100-300; High = 300-500. The sites span a wide spatial distribution (from south to north - Plymouth, Isle
466
of Wight, London Islington, Cardiff, Worcester, Cambridge, Leicester, Belfast and Invergowrie). As there were many
467
missing data, the years and sites used for these calculations are listed for each species/taxa. Note that for Corylus

Table 5: A summary of the timing of peak pollen emissions for each of the species/taxa and across 9 sites in the UK pollen sampling
network for the period 2006-2015. Month of peak emissions gives the timing of peak pollen emissions; while emission strength
is categorised∗ by peak pollen count (number of grains per day). As there were many missing data, the years and sites used for
these calculations are listed for each species/taxa. The sites span a wide spatial distribution (from south to north - PlymouthP, Isle
of WightIoW, London IslingtonLI, CardiffCf, WorcesterW, CambridgeCb, LeicesterL, BelfastB, InvergowrieIg). ∗Based on peak
daily pollen count (in units of number of grains per day): Low = 0-10, Low-Med = 10-50, Med = 50-100, Med-High = 100-300,
High = 300-500.
24
 avellana and Alnus only the Worcester data were used as this was the only site with data available before March,
469
when pollen emissions for these species are likely in many locations. Note that sensitivity tests on a range of different
470
time periods have been made and the same general trends were evident.
471
Pollen grains contain the male reproductive cells of seed plants, and the timing of their development and release
472
varies depending on the taxon and environmental conditions, particularly meteorology (Emberlin et al., 2007). The
473
production of pollen is dependent not only on the current meteorological conditions (including day length, temper-
474
ature, precipitation, and wind speed/direction), but also on the conditions and water availability experienced in the
475
year prior during which pollen is formed (Emberlin et al., 2007). Land management is also critical, for example if
476
fi
elds are cut or grazed by animals then the potential to release pollen is signifi
cantly affected. Any changes in these
477
conditions affect the phenology of the tree and thus the timing of the onset of pollen release, the total volume of pollen
478
produced, and the length of the flowering season (Dahl et al., 2012). Typically in the UK, the pollen season for tree
479
taxa ranges from January to April for early flowering taxa such as alder and hazel, to mid-March to end of July for the
480
later taxa, including oak and pine. Grass flowering occurs generally between May and early-September, coincident
481
with many taxa of weeds with allergenic pollen, see Worcester University (2017). Depending on the taxon, pollen
482
grains are dispersed by wind, animals or water.
483
4.2.2. Dispersion of pollen grains
484
Dispersion of pollen grains once they are released from a plant is dependent on many factors, predominantly
485
meteorological. Land management is also important, for example hay cutting can shed substantial amounts of pollen
486
in an acute manner. Pollen can be transported large distances from its source (Sofi
ev et al., 2012), with the main
487
factors in their dispersion being wind speed and direction, as well as precipitation (which brings down the pollen to
488
the ground). The distance that a pollen grain travels depends on the taxon of plant, as each of the pollen grains are
489
different sizes and shapes and so have different aerodynamic properties; and also on the release height of the grain
490
(for example tree pollen are released higher from the ground and are more likely to be transported long-range). Pollen
491
may travel some distance, and the concentration of pollen (particles per m3) is not just a localised phenomenon; it
492
varies on a fairly broad geographical scale. Pollen grain counts have been found to correlate across distances of 20 km
493
(Erbas et al., 2007) and 41 km (Pashley et al., 2009), with the potential for pollen to travel much further (Skjøth et al.,
494
2007), indeed across the globe (Sofi
ev et al., 2012).
495
4.2.3. Effect of climate change
496
The local effect of climate change on pollen production, release timing, transport and deposition is highly complex,
497
and its impact on pollen allergies is very uncertain (Osborne and Eggen, 2014). There is some evidence that climate
498
change may result in earlier seasonal appearance of respiratory symptoms and longer duration of exposure to pollen
499
(Fitter and Fitter, 2002; Vardoulakis and Heaviside, 2012). Across the Northern Hemisphere, early onset of spring
500
has been measured, with some tree taxa releasing pollen earlier (Emberlin et al., 1997; Frei, 1998; Emberlin et al.,
501
25
 2002; Beggs, 2004) and cases of lengthened pollen season (Ziska et al., 2011). Further warming of global temperature
502
and increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration may lead to great pollen release through increased plant productivity,
503
unless the plants are limited by other factors such as water stress. Failure to frost means that the pollen season may be
504
prolonged (Gezon et al., 2016). Climate change may also affect the allergenicity of pollen for some taxa (Cecchi et al.,
505
2010). Furthermore, the effect of climate change on the frequency or severity of thunderstorms, and thus the health
506
impact of thunderstorm asthma (Elliot et al., 2013) (where it is thought pollen plays a role) under a future climate is
507
very uncertain.
508
4.2.4. Interaction with air quality
509
People who live in urban areas have been shown to be more affected by pollen allergies (asthma and allergic
510
rhinitis) than those who live in rural areas (Ehrenstein et al., 2000; Riedler et al., 2001; D’Amato et al., 2007). Ur-
511
ban environments, with high levels of vehicle emissions have been shown to coincide with increased pollen-induced
512
respiratory allergies. While it has been known for some time that exposure to air pollution prior to pollen exposure
513
can exacerbate symptoms and lower the threshold of pollen required to trigger symptoms in allergy sufferers (Molfi
no
514
et al., 1991; Emberlin, 1998), further research is required to characterise the interaction between chemical air pol-
515
lutants and pollen. For example, to fully understand and quantify the effect of exposure to both allergenic pollen
516
and pollutants, the effect on both the allergenicity (such as increased allergenicity of pollen which had been exposed
517
to NO2 found by (Cuinica et al., 2013)) and volume of pollen grains released under increased air pollution must be
518
determined. The health impacts of all these factors, in high co-exposure areas need to be considered. Co-exposure of
519
pollen and air pollutants (namely NO2, SO2 and particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10 and ozone) is currently an active
520
area of research (M¨
ucke et al. (2014); Ørby et al. (2015)); allergens from birch pollen have been found bound to
521
particulate matter, PM10 which means the pollen allergen can travel into the low respiratory tract (Suring et al., 2016).
522
Vardoulakis et al. (2015) discuss how a range of health risks from indoor pollutants, including pollen, might change
523
under a changing climate. When considering the public health relevance of these taxa maps, it is important to note the
524
interaction between pollen and air quality, as well as the spatial variability of air pollution (e.g. see Defra / Met Office
525
air quality maps (Met Office, 2017a; Defra, 2017)).
526
4.2.5. Changing allergenicity
527
The allergen content of pollen has also been shown to vary throughout the season and across regions. Buters
528
et al. (2015) found that grass pollen allergen release (potency) varied signifi
cantly, and that differences were found per
529
location in Europe, and time in the pollen season. They concluded that although pollen count is a proxy for exposure,
530
it is not a measure of the actual allergens in the air.
531
4.2.6. Mitigation and adaptation
532
To mitigate the health effects of pollen from allergenic trees in urban areas, adaptation measures have been sug-
533
gested. Policies to oversee planting of allergenic taxa in urban areas, e.g. Platanus (London plane), and the use of
534
26
 an allergenicity scale in the US (Seitz and Francisco Escobedo, 2009) to select suitable taxa for urban planting have
535
been proposed. Cecchi et al. (2010); D’Amato (2011) recommend planting non-allergenic trees such as Palmaceae
536
(palm) and Ulmaceae (elm), avoiding Cupressaceae (cyprus), Betulaceae (birch) and Oleaceae (olive). Cryptomeria
537
japonica (Sugi, or Japanese cedars) were planted extensively in Japan, Asia and North America after the second world
538
war. These highly allergenic trees have had a large health effect on populations (Okuda, 2003; Yamada et al., 2014).
539
Furthermore, the current practice of the planting of solely male trees in urban areas in order to reduce street litter from
540
seeds and fruit increases the total pollen load, and so consideration of reduction of pollen exposure through female
541
tree planting could potentially mitigate effects. The services and disservices that a particular tree taxon and canopy
542
design may provide must be considered by local decision makers (Salmond et al., 2016).
543
Other vegetation management schemes such as grass cutting regimes where grass is cut before it flowers could be
544
used in areas where these maps show that there is a high coverage of grass close to high population centres. It should
545
be noted, however, that if plants are routinely managed to maintain vegetative phases of growth and restrict flowering
546
there will be consequent negative impacts on biodiversity.
547
5. Conclusions
548
In this paper we present a methodology to produce location maps of selected trees, grass and weeds, to study
549
plant taxa in the UK that are associated with allergy and allergic asthma. The taxa and species used in this study are
550
all monitored as part of the UK pollen monitoring network. These have been made in order to study environmental
551
exposure and human health, although these new vegetation maps have many possible applications.
552
The novel method used in this study uniquely maps 12 key plant taxa using a consistent, reproducible methodology,
553
covering more plant types, and higher spatial resolution across England and Wales, and Great Britain, than currently
554
available elsewhere.
555
To create these maps, several different observational and modelled datasets were combined. These include land
556
use datasets and tree taxa databases including those from the Forestry Commission and the National Tree Map from
557
Bluesky International. A framework was designed to combine these datasets allowing integration of existing UK land
558
use and vegetation datasets with the taxa data. We presented 1 km resolution maps of 12 taxa of trees, grass and weeds
559
found in the UK, and plots showing local level detail around the city of London.
560
The next step of this work is to combine these taxa maps with health data including emergency hospital admissions
561
for asthma to study the impact of different taxa in the UK. The maps could also be combined with population data in a
562
risk assessment framework. This will provide valuable information on which taxa in the UK have the most signifi
cant
563
health impact for asthma. Furthermore, in the future these maps could also form part of a UK pollen forecast model,
564
to provide detailed taxon-specifi
c, localised information to the public.
