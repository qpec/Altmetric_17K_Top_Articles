Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of plaques and tangles. Only certain brain
regions are vulnerable to progressive neurodegeneration. It is therefore important to study the contri-
bution of key brain structures to AD pathology. Here, we investigated the consequences of amyloid
accumulation specifically in dentate gyrus (DG). This was obtained with viral transduction of human
amyloid precursor protein harboring 3 pathogenic mutations (hAPP-SLA, Swedish, London, and Austrian)
in DG. Adult wild-type C57Bl/6J mice exhibited long-term expression of hAPP-SLA, synthesis and
deposition of oligomeric amyloid beta (Ab), and associated memory impairment. We then investigated
the role of a7 or b2 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by transducing hAPP-SLA into C57Bl/
6J mice knock-out (KO) for a7 or b2 subunits. b2 KO mice did not exhibit memory loss induced by hAPP-
SLA expression, whereas aged mice lacking the a7 subunit displayed a hAPP-SLA independent cognitive
deficit. The present data reveal a role for b2 containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the memory
deficits associated with DG specific amyloid beta expression.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disease, characterized by the spread of hallmark lesions, which are
amyloid extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tau
tangles. Although AD has widespread effects throughout the brain,
only a few neural systems are specifically involved and show
consistent pathologic changes (Braak and Braak, 1991). Notably, the
cholinergic pathway and neurons located in the basal forebrain are
highly subject to degeneration in AD (Auld et al., 2002; Whitehouse
et al., 1982). These basal forebrain neurons provide the primary
cholinergic innervation to the neocortex, hippocampus, and other
limbic regions (Woolf and Butcher, 2011). Moreover, AD has also
been consistently associated with a considerable loss of high-affinity
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that contain the b2 sub-
unit (Gotti et al., 2006). This loss occurs particularly in temporal
cortex and hippocampus. Decreased protein levels of a7 nAChRs
were also reported in AD brains (Nordberg, 2001). Because nAChRs
are implicated in cognitive processing, such as working memory and
attention, they have been proposed to contribute to the cognitive
decline observed in normal and pathologic aging. Notably, amyloid
pathology could be the link between cholinergic neuron degenera-
tion and cognitive deficit in AD (Okada et al., 2013).
Numerous transgenic mouse models used to study AD express
ubiquitously and constitutively familial ADeassociated mutations
(Epis et al., 2010; LaFerla and Green, 2012). Other models such as
doxycycline inducible systems allow a temporal control of amyloid
precursor protein (APP) expression (Jankowsky et al., 2005). How-
ever, all these lines develop amyloid aggregation in the whole brain.
This is in many cases linked to rapid and severe biochemical and
pathologic changes and does not allow to investigate the implication
of a discrete brain region in AD. Therefore, we sought to develop a
novel mouse model to induce amyloid deposition, in a specific region
of the brain, in adult animals. This approach allows us to accurately
investigate the contribution of specific brain areas to AD pathology.
The model was obtained with the use of a lentiviral vector for in vivo
transduction of a mutated form of the human APP harboring 3
pathogenic mutations: Swedish, London and Austrian (hAPP-SLA).
These mutations were selected because of their ability to increase
amyloid beta (Ab) synthesis (Goate et al., 1991; Kumar-Singh et al.,
2000; Mullan et al.,1992). We targeted the transduction of hAPP-SLA
in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus for its key role in
memory formation (Morris, 2006; Squire et al., 2007) and its crucial
implication in AD pathology (Ohm, 2007). Wild-type (WT) mice

 transfected with hAPP-SLA developed AD-like pathologic features
such as memory loss and Ab deposition that was restricted to the
targeted area. We then used this methodology to characterize the
role of nAChRs in memory dysfunction caused by amyloid pathology.
Both a7 and b2 nAChR subunits are widely expressed in the hippo-
campus (Jones and Yakel, 1997), which receives cholinergic afferents
from the basal forebrain (Woolf and Butcher, 2011). Because an
interaction between a7 and b2 nAChR subunits and Ab has been
reported, we focused our study on these nAChR subunits (Liu et al.,
2009, 2012; Nordberg et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2000b, reviewed in,
2000a; Lombardo and Maskos, 2015). The hAPP-SLA was transduced
into mice harboring null mutations for a7 (a7 knock-out [KO] mice)
or b2 (b2 KO mice) subunits to investigate their respective contri-
bution to AD phenotypes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Lentiviral construction
The lentiviral vector used in this study derived from the third
generation systems (Dull et al., 1998). Their principal characteristics
are a self-inactivating deletion in the U3 region of the 30LTR, a
chimeric 50LTR, and a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional
regulatory element sequence (Dull et al., 1998; Zufferey et al.,1999).
LV pTripPGK-hAPP-SLA-FLAG-IRES-eGFP (hAPP-SLA): the hAPP
complementary DNA (cDNA) harboring the Swedish mutation
(KM670/671NL) was recovered from a pcDNA 3.1 plasmid. The cDNA
sequence was modified with directed mutagenesis PCR (Agilent
Technologies, Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to add London (V717I)
and Austrian (T714I) mutations (for primers used see Table 1). The
same procedure was used to delete the stop codon at APP 30 to add an
FLAG tag. The obtained construct was inserted into a pGEM-T vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), resulting in the hAPP-SLA-FLAG-pGEM-
T plasmid. The hAPP-SLA-FLAG cassette was recovered from pGEM-T
vector with XmaI and NheI restriction enzymes and inserted in an LV
pTripPGK vector digested with the same enzymes, downstream of the
PGK promoter and upstream of the internal ribosome entry site-
enhanced green fluorescent protein (IRES-eGFP) sequence. The
resulting lentiviral vector was a pTripPGK-hAPP-SLA-FLAG-IRES-eGFP.
The lentivirus obtained coexpresses hAPP-SLA and eGFP, the latter
being used as reporter gene for the analysis of lentiviral infection
diffusion in the selected area.
2.2. Viral production and titration
The vector plasmid, packaging plasmid (CMVD 8.9), and envelope
plasmid (CMV-VSVg) were cotransfected in HEK293T cells with
Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hours of
expression, viral particles were collected from cell medium, treated
with DNaseI (1:5000; 0.2 mm/mL) and MgCl2 2M (1 mL/mL), filtered
with 0.45-mm pore filters (Merk Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany),
concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and stored at �80 �C until use.
The titers were determined by quantifying the p24 capsid protein
using an HIV-p24 antigen immunoassay (Gentaur Molecular Prod-
ucts, Kampenhout, Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Before stereotaxic injections, viral stocks were diluted to
the concentration of 100 ng/mL of p24 protein with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and a volume of 2 mL was injected.
2.3. Animals
Experiments were performed with male WT mice (C57Bl/6J line)
and a7 KO or b2 KO mice. The mutant lines were generated as
previously described (Orr-Urtreger et al., 1997; Picciotto et al., 1995)
and are both maintained on a 100% pure C57Bl/6J background. Mice
were bred at Charles River Laboratories in isolators under a 12 hour
light-dark cycle. All mice were transported to our facilities at
10 weeks of age, housed under a 12 hour light-dark cycle with ad
libitum access to food and water.
2.4. Stereotaxic injections
12-week-old mice were anesthetized with 1.5% ketamine
(Merial, Lyon, France) plus 0.05% xylazine (Bayer Healthcare, Lille,
France), in PBS. A stereotaxic frame adapted for mice was used.
Lentiviruses (2 mL at 100 ng/mL) were injected bilaterally (flow rate
0.2 mL/min). The following coordinates for the DG were used, ac-
cording to the Paxinos and Franklin Atlas (Paxinos and Franklin,
2004): A/P: �1.8, M/L: �1.2, and D/V: �1.9.
2.5. Total RNA extraction and messenger RNA (mRNA) amplification
Mice were deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine/
xylazine. Intracardial perfusion with PBS was performed, and
hippocampi were dissected and collected. The tissue was homog-
enized with a pestle in Trizol (Life Technologies, Ambion, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). Consecutive steps of centrifugation were performed with
chloroform (SigmaeAldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) and isopropanol
(SigmaeAldrich). Finally, the samples were centrifuged, the pellet
recovered, resuspended in sterile water, and stored at �80 �C until
use. Reverse transcription was performed with the commercial kit
Superscript Vilo cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used for
amplification are listed in Table 1. Primers were designed against
the hAPP sequence to avoid any amplification of murine APP.
For behavioral experiments, 2 groups of mice were injected at
12 weeks of age. One group was injected with the hAPP-SLA
lentivirus (APP-WT; APP-a7, and APP-b2 groups), and the control
group was injected with a lentivirus expressing only GFP (GFP-WT;
GFP-a7, and GFP-b2 groups).
2.6. Novel place recognition (NPR)
Recognition memory was evaluated in a “novel place recognition”
procedure as a simple behavioral assay of memory that primarily
relies on rodent’s propensity to explore novelty in the absence of
external rules of reinforcement. C57Bl/6J mice exhibit a spontaneous
tendency to explore novelty in free-exploratory paradigms. We
evaluated the ability of recognizing a previously presented envi-
ronment versus a novel one, by measuring the difference in the
exploration time of the familiar and novel environments. The boxes
used were composed of 2 equal compartments (16 � 16 cm)

 connected by a central zone (16 � 5 cm). Boxes were made of gray
Plexiglass and were closed at the time of the experiments to be
isolated from visual cues in the testing room. Light intensity in the
boxes was approximately 15e20 lux. The 2 compartments showed 2
distinct spatial configurations (1 rectangular or 2 triangular object(s)
at 1 or 2 of the angles) and 2 distinct floor textures (grooves or
peaks). The apparatus was equipped with infrared frame detectors to
record the activity of the animals in each compartment. Mice were
left 3 minutes in the central zone before being confined for 20 mi-
nutes in 1 of the 2 compartments (“familiar”). The mice were then
placed back into their home cage for 15 minutes. During the
following test phase, the animal was allowed to explore the whole
box (central zone, familiar, and new compartment) for 15 minutes.
The time spent in the familiar compartment and the time spent in
the novel compartment were quantified. Before starting the exper-
iments, we previously verified, in separate groups of animals, that (1)
C57Bl/6J mice show a robust preference for the novel compartment
when tested with no delay between the confinement and the test
phases, (2) C57Bl6/J mice are able to discriminate both environ-
ments, and (3) the absence of spontaneous preference for one of the
compartments (data not shown). Mice were tested 7 months post
injection (p.i.). Data were analyzed with a paired 2-tailed Student’s t-
test. Results are presented as mean � standard error of the mean
(SEM; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001).
2.7. Novel object recognition (NOR)
Recognition memory was also evaluated with a novel object
recognition task using a rectangular open field (50 � 25 cm) made of
transparent Plexiglass. Before starting the experiment, we verified
that mice did not display a preference among the different objects
used. Mice were subjected to a 10 minute-training session in which
they were allowed to explore 2 copies of the same object (A or B).
Mice were placed back in their home cage for a retention interval of
15 minutes then tested in a session of 10 minutes with 2 objects, 1
familiar and 1 novel (A or B). Light intensity in the room was
approximately 50 lux. Each session was recorded, and the time spent
exploring the objects was evaluated manually by an operator blinded
to experimental group. Exploration of an object was defined as the
animal’s nose being directed toward the object within a certain
radius around it. The use of object A or B as familiar or novel object
was randomized among mice to avoid any bias. The objects used
were a glass cylinder (height: 19 cm, diameter: 4 cm) and a plastic
cube (height: 7.2 cm, length 6.4 cm, and width: 2.4 cm). The distance
between objects was 30 cm. Mice that climbed the objects or dis-
played very low object exploration (less than 5 seconds) were
excluded from the study. Mice were tested 15 months p.i. Data were
plotted as total exploration time and recognition percentage (Time-
Novel/[TimeNovel þ TimeFamiliar] � 100) and analyzed with an unpaired
(for recognition percentage) or paired (for total time) 2-tailed Stu-
dent’s t-test. Results are presented as mean � SEM. Locomotor
behavior during the habituation phase was quantified with the
software EthoVision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wagenin-
gen, Netherlands). Data were plotted as total distance traveled (cm)
and analyzed with an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test. Results are
presented as mean � SEM (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001).
2.8. Light-dark box (LDB)
Anxiety was evaluated with the LDB paradigm using a rectan-
gular cage (22 � 16 cm) made of Plexiglass, divided in 2 sections of
equal size, the lit compartment with white walls and the dark with
black walls. An illumination of 500 lux was applied to the lit side
whereas the dark side was protected from light (about 2e4 lux in
the dark compartment). Mice were placed in the dark compartment
and allowed to freely explore the box for 5 minutes. The cage was
placed on an infrared board, and movies were taken with an
infrared camera. Transitions from 1 section to the other of the box
and total time spent in each compartment were quantified with the
software EthoVision XT (Noldus Information Technology, Wage-
ningen, Netherlands). Mice were tested 12 months p.i. Data were
analyzed with an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t-test for both per-
centage spent in lit compartment (TimeLit/[TimeLit þ TimeDark] �
100) and number of transitions. Results are plotted as mean � SEM
(*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001).
For all behavioral tests, all apparatus were washed with water
between individual sessions.
2.9. Immunostaining
Mice were deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine/
xylazine before intracardiac perfusion with ice cold PBS first, fol-
lowed by PFA (paraformaldehyde) (SigmaeAldrich) 4% in PBS. The
brains were collected and postfixed overnight in PFA 4%. Coronal
brain slices of 50-mm thickness were obtained using a vibratome
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Slices were incubated in
10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour, then
washed in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies: anti-GFP
rabbit 1:2000 (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) or anti-GFP mouse
1:2000 (Millipore), variable domain of heavy chain antibodies (VHH)
V31-1 kindly provided by Pierre Lafaye (Lafaye et al., 2009), anti-
GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) 1:200 (Abcam) and anti-Iba1
(ionized
calcium
binding
adaptor molecule 1) rabbit
1:1000
(Abcam). We used an anti-His antibody (SigmaeAldrich) to amplify
the VHH signal. For the staining with the 7H3D6 antibody (kindly
provided by Sathish Kumar and Jochen Walter), an antigen retrieval
protocol was performed before incubation with the 7H3D6 antibody
(Kumar et al., 2013). Slices were boiled in 0.01-M citrate buffer pH 6
for 15 minutes at 90 �C, then incubated in 5% skimmed milk þ 10%
horse serum in PBS for 1 hour. The rat monoclonal primary antibody
7H3D6 was used at a dilution of 1:500. The fluorophore-conjugated
secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse and
Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit, (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove,
PA, USA) at a dilution of 1:500 and Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rat (Life
Technologies, Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:100. After DAPI (40,6-
Diamidino-2-phenylindole, SigmaeAldrich) incubation, the slices
were mounted on slides and fixed with ProLong Gold Antifade Re-
agent (Life Technologies, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sec-
tions were imaged with a Zeiss Apotome (at 25� or 60�) and with a
Leica SP5 confocal microscope (at 63�). All images were analyzed
and stitched with Fiji software (Schindelin et al., 2012). Quantifica-
tion of GFP fluorescence intensity was performed with Icy software
(de Chaumont et al., 2012) (n ¼ 20; 10 GFP-WT and 10 APP-WT).
Three slices from each mouse on the anterior-posterior axis were
analyzed (from Bregma: �1.5 for the first slice, �1.9 for the second,
and �3 for the last). Fluorescence intensity was normalized on re-
gion of interest (ROI) area and is plotted as mean � SEM. Fluorescent
intensity per ROI area was used as index of number of cells trans-
duced in the targeted area.
Statistical analysis was performed using Excel and GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (Graph Pad Software).

 mutation (V717I) (Goate et al., 1991), and the Austrian mutation
(T714I) (Kumar-Singh et al., 2000) (Fig. 1A). We stereotactically
delivered hAPP-SLA into the DG of 12-week-old WT mice to induce
Ab synthesis only in this area. The viral transduction was verified
1 month p.i. by amplification of mRNA molecules encoding for
hAPP-SLA and GFP. The APP sequence was amplified in the APP-WT
group and not in GFP-WT group (Fig.1B), whereas the GFP sequence
was amplified in both groups (data not shown). We then evaluated

 the extension of the viral transduction in the targeted area using
GFP protein staining as a marker. The GFP staining (green) showed a
widespread diffusion in the DG (Fig. 1D), with little spreading in the
surrounding regions of CA1 (Fig. 1D, arrow head) and CA3 (Fig. 1D,
arrow). We then quantified GFP fluorescence intensity per ROI area
in DG granular cell layer, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers (Fig. 1D,
white lines represent ROIs). The quantification confirmed that the
majority of the transduced cells were located in the DG (fluores-
cence intensity 3-fold higher compared with CA1 and CA3; Fig. 1C).
The viral infection was therefore restricted to this area. In addition,
we obtained a stable expression of hAPP-SLA and GFP that lasted up
to 15 months p.i., as shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8.
3.2. In vivo hAPP-SLA expression induces a memory deficit
Behavioral tasks were carried out to assess recognition memory
performance of mice expressing hAPP-SLA specifically in the DG. At
7 months p.i. mice were tested in the NPR paradigm. The analysis of
total time of exploration for the novel and familiar compartments
during the test phase revealed a significant preference for the novel
Fig. 2. hAPP-SLA expression induced memory deficit in WT mice. (AeB) NPR task: GFP-WT (A) spent significantly more time in the novel compartment, whereas APP-WT (B) spent
an equal amount of time in the familiar and in the novel compartment, indicating a memory deficit (p values: GFP-WT ¼ 0,0003; APP-WT ¼ 0,37). (CeE) Memory was also evaluated
with the NOR task: GFP-WT spent more time exploring the novel object during the trial phase of the test (C; p ¼ 0.0002), APP-WT (2D) as well displayed higher exploration of the
novel object (p ¼ 0.047). Recognition percentage index, comparison between GFP-WT and APP-WT (E). GFP-WT mice displayed significantly higher recognition index compared to
APP-WT (p ¼ 0.0032), demonstrating the presence of a memory recognition deficit in the latter. (F) The quantification of the distance traveled in the habituation phase of NOR
showed that the APP-WT group was hyperactive compared with GFP-WT (p ¼ 0.0027). (GeH) The anxiety level was evaluated with the LDB task. This test showed no difference
between the 2 groups in both the percentage of time spent in lit compartment (G; p ¼ 0.7) or in the transitions between compartments (H; p ¼ 0.2). Data were analyzed with
Student’s t-test and plotted as mean � standard error of the mean (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; and *** p < 0.001). Number of mice used in each group is represented in the corresponding
graph. Abbreviations: APP, amyloid precursor protein; hAPP-SLA, human APP with Swedish, London, and Austrian mutations; LDB, light-dark box; NOR, novel object recognition;

 compartment for GFP-WT (p ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 2A), whereas APP-WT
did not show any preference for novel or familiar compartment
(p ¼ 0.3; Fig. 2B). We then performed the NOR task at 15 months p.i.
The analysis of total time of exploration during the test session
showed that both GFP-WT and APP-WT spent significantly more
time exploring the novel object (p ¼ 0.0002 and p ¼ 0.047,
respectively; Fig. 2C and D, respectively). However, the analysis of
the recognition percentage for the same set of data showed that
GFP-WT spent significantly more time exploring the novel object
compared with APP-WT (p ¼ 0.0032; Fig. 2E), suggesting the
presence of a memory deficit in the APP-WT group. The locomotor
behavior during the NOR habituation phase was measured by the
total distance traveled: APP-WT showed higher locomotor activity
compared with GFP-WT (p ¼ 0.0027; Fig. 2F). We finally measured
anxiety levels using the LDB paradigm. No differences were
observed between both groups for the index of time spent in the lit
compartment (p ¼ 0.7) as well as for the number of transitions (p ¼
0.2; Fig. 2GeH). Hence, the transduction of hAPP-SLA in DG induces
recognition memory deficits as supported by NPR and NOR tasks.
We performed GFAP and Iba1 staining on WT-APP, WT-GFP, and WT
noninjected mice to investigate whether or not the behavioral
deficit we observed could be driven by neuroinflammation. We did
not detect any glia or microglia activation in WT-APP (Fig. 3C and F)
compared with WT-GFP (Fig. 3B and E), meaning that the neuro-
inflammation does not play a role in the memory deficit we
observed. In addition, viral transduction did not induce any neu-
roinflammation, as shown in WT noninjected mice (Fig. 3A and D).

impairment observed in APP-WT, we delivered hAPP-SLA into the
DG of KO mice for b2 or a7 subunits. In the NPR task (7 months p.i.),
the GFP-b2 spent significantly more time exploring the novel
compartment (p ¼ 0.003; Fig. 4A), as well as APP-b2 (p ¼ 0.017;
Fig. 4B). Similarly, in the NOR task (15 months p.i.), both the GFP-b2
and the APP-b2 displayed higher exploration of the novel object
(p < 0.0001 and p ¼ 0.0001, respectively; Fig. 4C and D), with no
differences between the 2 groups in the recognition index (p ¼ 0.7;
Fig. 4E), meaning that b2 mice injected with hAPP-SLA did not
exhibit the recognition memory deficit observed in APP-WT. The
analysis of the locomotion during the NOR habituation phase
showed no differences between GFP-b2 and APP-b2 (p ¼ 0.2;
Fig. 4F). The LDB test showed no differences in anxiety levels
measured as total time spent in the lit compartment (p ¼ 0.52) and
number of transitions (p ¼ 0.17) between the APP-b2 and the GFP-
b2 (Fig. 4GeH). The hAPP-SLA transduction in DG did not induce a
memory deficit in b2 KO, meaning that the Ab/b2-nAChR interac-
tion is required to drive the memory deficit in this model.
3.4. nAChR a7 KO mice display memory impairment independently
of hAPP expression
The involvement of the a7 nAChR subunit in AD pathology had
been investigated in previous studies that obtained conflicting
results (Dziewczapolski et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2010,
reviewed in). At 7 months p.i., both GFP-a7 (p ¼ 0.9; Fig. 5A) and
APP-a7 groups (p ¼ 0.3; Fig. 5B) displayed a memory deficit in the
NPR task. Indeed, in our experimental conditions, there was no
difference in the exploration of the novel or familiar compart-
ment for GFP-a7 and APP-a7. We then tested age-matched non-
injected mice to determine whether the memory deficit was
related to the viral transduction in this strain. Noninjected mice
spent the same amount of time exploring novel and familiar
compartments during the test session (p ¼ 0.6; Fig. 5C),
Fig. 3. Immunofluorescence performed with anti-GFAP (A, B, and C) and anti-Iba1 antibodies (D, E, and F). No evident glia or microglia activation was detected comparing WT-GFP
(B and E) and WT-APP (C and F). Moreover no inflammatory response activation was detected in WT noninjected age-matched mice (A and D). Scale bars, 20 mm. Abbreviations:

 confirming the presence of a constitutive recognition memory
deficit in age-matched a7 KO mice. In the NOR task (15 months
p.i.) as well, both GFP-a7 and APP-a7 displayed a cognitive
impairment (Fig. 5DeE). The analysis of the total exploration time
during the NOR task showed that GFP-a7 spent similar time
exploring the familiar and the novel objects (p ¼ 0.76; Fig. 5D),
whereas APP-a7 spent significantly more time exploring the
novel object compared with the familiar one (p ¼ 0.01; Fig. 5E).
Yet, the analysis of the recognition index showed no difference
between GFP-a7 and APP-a7 (Fig. 5F). We found no difference in
locomotor activity between the 2 groups (p ¼ 0.29; Fig. 5G). The
LDB test revealed no difference between GFP-a7 and APP-a7 in
the percentage of time spent in the lit compartment (p ¼ 0.6;
Fig. 5H), whereas the test showed higher number of transitions in
APP-a7 compared with GFP-a7 (p ¼ 0.01; Fig. 5I). Because the a7
KO had a memory deficit independent of hAPP-SLA expression,
we could not draw any conclusion on the role of a7 in the
memory deficit observed. However, we identify a possible role of
the a7 subunit in the normal aging process that should be further
investigated.
Fig. 4. Deletion of the b2 nAChR subunit prevents the memory deficit. (AeB) NPR performed on b2 KOs. The GFP-b2 (A) spent more time in the exploration of the novel
compartment, as well as the APP-b2 (B), showing that b2 deletion prevents the memory loss (p values: GFP-b2 ¼ 0.003; APP-b2 ¼ 0.017). (CeF) NOR test confirmed the result
obtained with the novel place recognition task. Neither GFP-b2 (C; p < 0.0001) nor APP-b2 (D; p ¼ 0.0001) displayed a memory deficit. The analysis of recognition percentage index
for GFP-b2 and APP-b2 (E; p ¼ 0.71) confirmed the absence of a cognitive deficit in mice expressing hAPP-SLA. (F) Locomotion analysis showed no significant difference between the
groups (p ¼ 0.2). (GeH) The LDB task showed that anxiety was not affected. The percentage of time spent in the lit compartment (G; p ¼ 0.52) and the transitions between
compartments (H; p ¼ 0.17) were analyzed and did not show any difference between GFP-b2 and APP-b2. Data were analyzed with Student’s t-test and plotted as mean � standard
error of the mean (* p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; and *** p < 0.001). Number of mice used in each group is represented in the corresponding graph. Abbreviations: APP, amyloid precursor

 3.5. The expression of hAPP-SLA drives synthesis and intracellular
accumulation of Ab
Several studies showed that in AD animal models, the appear-
ance of the cognitive deficits precedes plaque deposition (Casas
et al., 2004; Gouras et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2013; Wirths et al.,
2004). We investigated whether the transduction of hAPP-SLA
was able to drive Ab accumulation in our model. The presence of
oligomeric Ab in APP-WT was confirmed with the antibody VHH
31-1, specific for oligomeric forms of Ab (Lafaye et al., 2009). Ab was
mainly found in the polymorphic layer of the DG (Fig. 6, arrows).
Oligomeric Ab was due to hAPP-SLA expression because Ab oligo-
mers were not observed in CA1, where there was no viral trans-
duction (Fig. 6). Ab intracellular accumulation in DG polymorphic
layer was also confirmed with the rat monoclonal 7H3D6 antibody,
also specific for oligomeric Ab (Kumar et al., 2013) (Fig. 7, arrow).
The antigen retrieval protocol required for this staining resulted in
higher background noise and lower GFP signal. The signal in
granular cell layer of WT-GFP and WT-APP was considered as
background (Fig. 7, arrow head).
We then investigated the presence of Ab aggregates in the
hippocampus of APP-b2 and APP-a7. In APP-b2, a positive staining
for Ab oligomers using the VHH 31-1 antibody was found (Fig. 8,
arrows). We observed intracellular Ab staining in the polymorphic
layer of the DG that was absent in GFP-b2 (Fig. 8). Immunofluo-
rescence performed with VHH 31-1 on brain slices of APP-a7 mice
also showed intracellular Ab oligomers in the polymorphic layer
(Fig. 8, arrows), whereas GFP-a7 mice did not show any Ab
oligomers.
4. Discussion
We have developed a novel mouse model based on the lentiviral
delivery of a hAPP-SLA expressing vector to investigate the impli-
cation of substructures of the hippocampus in amyloid pathology.
The AD rodent models commonly used are transgenic organisms
that constitutively express high levels of mutated hAPP in the
whole brain, and throughout prenatal and postnatal development.
However, in some models, the use of the Thy1 promoter allows a
postdevelopmental expression of APP (e.g., Oakley et al., 2006;
Fig. 6. Ab (red) and GFP (green) immunofluorescence in APP-WT. Ab immunofluorescence was performed with a VHH specific antibody for the oligomeric form (VHH V31-1). Ab
oligomers were mainly found in the polymorphic layer of DG (white arrow), in close proximity of transduced cells (green). Very low colocalization between GFP and Ab was
observed (arrow head). Ab oligomers are mainly intracellular. No Ab staining was found in the CA1 of APP-WT, or in GFP-WT (see Fig. 7, lower panel), although some background in
the red channel is present (s.p: stratum pyramidale, s.r: stratum radiatum). Blue: DAPI. Scale bars, 20 mm. Ab, amyloid beta; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DG, dentate gyrus;

 Oddo et al., 2003), whereas a better temporal regulation of APP
expression is obtained with a TeTOn model (Jankowsky et al., 2005),
in which APP is located downstream of a tetracycline-responsive
promoter. However, none of these models allow the accurate
expression of APP in a specific brain structure. Thus, the main
advantage of our model is to produce Ab in the adult brain and in
specific targeted area.
The lentiviral transfer vector we generated expresses the
sequence of human APP harboring 3 pathogenic mutations, the
Swedish double mutation (KM670/671NL) (Mullan et al., 1992),
the London mutation (V717I) (Goate et al., 1991), and the Austrian
mutation (T714I) (Kumar-Singh et al., 2000). These 3 mutations
were chosen for their close proximity to the secretase cleavage sites
(b-secretase for the Swedish and g-secretase for London and Aus-
trian) and were reported to increase Ab synthesis (Goate et al.,
1991; Kumar-Singh et al., 2000; Mullan et al., 1992). The technol-
ogy of lentiviral transduction was already used to generate models
to study hAPP processing in vitro (Shaughnessy et al., 2005). In vivo
models based on adeno-associated virus (AVV) vectors had also
previously been generated (Gong et al., 2006; Jaworski et al., 2009;
Lawlor et al., 2007; Nishimura et al., 1998). In the present work, we
chose a lentiviral vector because its cloning capacity is bigger
compared to AAV. This allowed the insertion of the IRES-GFP
sequence for an easy and rapid analysis of viral transduction

 efficiency and diffusion in the targeted area. We were able to infect
specific subregions of the hippocampus, like the CA1 and CA3 py-
ramidal cell regions (data not shown), and the DG (Fig. 1D).
Because memory is one of the first human cognitive functions
affected in AD patients (Hildebrandt et al., 2013), we decided to
target the hippocampus, and in particular the DG, which is a key
region for memory formation (Morris, 2006; Squire et al., 2007). In
addition, amyloid deposition in the hippocampus of AD patients
was previously established (Braak and Braak, 1991). We quantified
fluorescence intensity outside the targeted area and found 3-fold
lower fluorescence intensity in CA1 and CA3 areas compared to
DG, meaning that most transduced cells are located in the selected
area. There is probably a diffusion of the vector solution from the
needle to CA1 at the moment of the injection (Fig. 1D, arrow head),
whereas the fluorescence in CA3 most probably originates from the
projection of the DG through the mossy fiber pathway (Fig. 1D,
arrow). We can conclude that the DG was efficiently targeted.
Moreover, a single injection led to good diffusion within the hip-
pocampus (Fig. 1D) and was able to induce a recognition memory
deficit together with the accumulation of intracellular oligomeric
Ab, whereas no sign of inflammation was detected (Fig. 3). These
features are all associated with early-stage AD pathology (Kumar
et al., 2013). For Ab staining, we used a VHH derived from alpaca
antibodies (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993) specific for oligomeric
Ab. VHH specifically recognizes low-molecular-weight species of Ab
(monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and 12-mers, but not the
fibril form), mostly intraneuronal (Lafaye et al., 2009). In APP-WT,
Ab deposition was further demonstrated by the use of the rat
monoclonal 7H3D6 antibody (Kumar et al., 2013), specific for
monomeric and oligomeric Ab (Fig. 7).
Little colocalization between GFP positive neurons and Ab was
found (Fig. 6, arrow head). We hypothesize that once Ab is secreted
from the hAPP-SLAeexpressing cell (GFP positives cells), it is then
recaptured by the surroundings cells. However, Ab synthesis was
strictly confined to the lentivirus injection site because in CA1,
where there was no hAPP-SLA expression, Ab oligomers were ab-
sent (Fig. 6), as in GFP-injected mice (Fig. 7, lower panel, and Fig. 8).
Thus, we have generated a novel model displaying memory deficit
and Ab oligomerization in which it is possible to study changes
induced by Ab deposition in a restricted brain area.
The major advantage of our methodology is that it is applicable
to every animal model and strain. We decided to use it to study the
implication of nAChRs in AD-like pathology. In this work, we
investigated the role of a7 and b2 nAChR subunits. Although a7 had
been shown to physically interact with Ab (Wang et al., 2000a,b),
only a functional link in vitro between b2 and Ab was reported, as
Ab was shown to inhibit b2*-nAChR currents (Lamb et al., 2005;
Pandya and Yakel, 2011). Our data strongly suggest that the lack
of the b2 subunit prevents Ab-induced memory loss because b2 KO
animals are protected from the recognition memory impairment
induced by APP-SLA expression in control mice. To date, this is
the first in vivo demonstration of a role for the b2 subunit in
Ab-induced toxicity.
Previous studies extensively reported degeneration of the
cholinergic system in AD, particularly the basal forebrain cholin-
ergic cells that innervate the neocortex and hippocampus. Their
degeneration in AD is associated with reduced levels of pre and
postsynaptic cholinergic markers in the cortex, hippocampus, and
amygdala.
Electrophysiological and binding studies demonstrated that
nAChRs are expressed in discrete parts of the hippocampus.
Notably, in the DG, both a7 and b2 subunits are expressed in the
molecular layer, in particular, in GABAergic interneurons (Frazier
et al., 2003; Gahring and Rogers, 2008; Son and Winzer-Serhan,
2008), and a7 nAChRs were reported to induce LTP in DG
(Matsuyama et al., 2000). No nicotinic responses have been iden-
tified in dentate granule cells (Jones and Yakel, 1997), but hippo-
campal neurogenesis is altered in b2 KO mice (Harrist et al., 2004).
Liu et al (Liu et al., 2009) recently postulated the existence of an
a7b2 nAChR heteromer in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, that
is also expressed in CA1 interneurons. This novel nAChR subtype is
characterized by a high sensitivity to Ab inhibition (Liu et al., 2012),
and this interaction could be responsible for the memory deficit
observed in AD. It has been reported that both b2 and a7 subunits
are important for working memory. Local infusion of a7 nAChR and
a4b2 nAChR antagonist (MLA and DHbE, respectively) in ventral
hippocampus induces working memory impairments (Felix and
Levin, 1997; Levin et al., 2002). Thus, nAChRs are key regulatory
elements of hippocampal circuit activity (Frazier et al., 2003; Orr-
Urtreger et al., 1997). We hypothesize that nAChR-Ab interaction
could alter the electrophysiological activity of interneurons in DG.
Ab inhibition of nAChRs could interfere with their regulatory
function, leading to neuronal hyperactivity in the hippocampus and
subsequent memory impairment. In our model, the absence of the
b2 subunit (b2 KO) could be protective for the neurons by pre-
venting a toxic nAChR-Ab interaction.
b2 KO mice have previously been characterized. This line
showed
lack
of
nicotine-induced
striatal
dopamine
release,
decreased locomotor activity after habituation (Picciotto et al.,1998,
1995), and altered exploratory behavior (Avale et al., 2008; Besson
et al., 2007; Bourgeois et al., 2012; Maskos et al., 2005). In addition,
b2 KO showed increased neurodegeneration during aging (Picciotto
et al., 2000; Zoli et al., 1999). Contradictory results exist about
memory impairment in b2 KO mice Wiklund et al. (2009) did not
identify any impairment. On the other hand, some authors found
spatial learning deficits (Levin et al., 2009). However, this may be
more related to attention deficits (Guillem et al., 2011).
Previous in vivo work attempted to dissect the role of a7 nAChRs
in AD (Dziewczapolski et al., 2009; Hernandez et al., 2010). In both
studies, AD mouse models were crossed with a7 nAChR null-
mutants. However, these studies came to opposite conclusions,
improvement, and worsening, respectively, of AD-associated phe-
notypes, such as memory and synaptic deficits. In our experimental
conditions, APP-a7 displayed an inherent memory deficit that was
independent of injection, making it impossible to conclude con-
cerning the effect of Ab accumulation in this line. The a7 KO line had
previously been characterized by Paylor et al. (Paylor et al., 1998). A
large panel of behaviors like motor and sensory responses, loco-
motor activity in the open field, motor coordination, and spatial
memory were investigated. These authors found no difference be-
tween a7 KO and WT mice. More recent studies showed an atten-
tion deficit in the 5-choice serial reaction time task, but no memory
impairment, in a7 KO mice (Hoyle et al., 2006; Young et al., 2011,
2007, 2004). However, we observed a memory deficit in old a7
KO mice (18 months at the end of the experiments). It is possible
that the aging process exacerbates memory impairment in a7 KO.
Indeed, it was shown that hippocampal LTP is impaired in old a7 KO
and that this alteration was directly linked to aging (Ma et al., 2014).
The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is known to atten-
uate the inflammatory response and the progression of inflamma-
tory diseases (Shi et al., 2009; Tracey, 2009). Initial studies
suggested that the cholinergic system modulates inflammation via
the a7 nAChR. However, a recent study demonstrated the role of
a4b2 nAChR in the activation of intestinal macrophages (van der
Zanden et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2003; ). Despite the fact that we
excluded the activation of an immune response in APP-WT (Fig. 3),
we cannot completely exclude an alteration in inflammatory
response in a7 KO and b2 KO mice. This could play a role in the
toxicity induced by Ab oligomers and delay the onset of the
behavioral deficit in KOs. The exact mechanism through which

 Ab-nAChR interaction leads to memory deficit needs to be further
investigated.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a novel model to study the
neural and behavioral consequences induced by localized Ab
accumulation in adult mice that can be applied to every line and
species, avoiding crossbreeding of transgenic lines. In addition, this
method could be very useful to investigate region-specific vulner-
ability in AD linked to Ab deposition. Moreover, this can be a
powerful tool to investigate the “prion” hypothesis of AD (Frost and
Diamond, 2010), according to which there is a progressive spread of
Ab in the course of AD across several cerebral pathways. Indeed, the
model we developed allows to follow the accumulation of amyloid
deposition from 1 targeted brain structure to connected areas. To
date, this is the first mouse model based on a lentiviral vector that
was shown to induce a cognitive deficit in relationship to AD-
related histopathological changes.
