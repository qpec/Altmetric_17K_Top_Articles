HER family members are interdependent and functionally
compensatory. Simultaneously targeting EGFR/HER2/HER3
by antibody combinations has demonstrated superior treat-
ment efficacy over targeting one HER receptor. However,
antibody combinations have their limitations, with high immu-
nogenicity and high cost. In this study, we have developed a
three-in-one nucleic acid aptamer-small interfering RNA
(siRNA) chimera, which targets EGFR/HER2/HER3 in one
molecule. This inhibitory molecule was constructed such that
a single EGFR siRNA is positioned between the HER2 and
HER3 aptamers to create a HER2 aptamer-EGFR siRNA-
HER3 aptamer chimera (H2EH3). EGFR siRNA was delivered
into HER2-expressing cells by HER2/HER3 aptamer-induced
internalization. HER2/HER3 aptamers act as antagonist
molecules for blocking HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways
and also as tumor-targeting agents for siRNA delivery.
H2EH3 enables down-modulation of the expression of all three
receptors, thereby triggering cell apoptosis. In breast cancer
xenograft models, H2EH3 is able to bind to breast tumors
with high specificity and significantly inhibits tumor growth
via either systemic or intratumoral administration. Owing
to low immunogenicity, ease of production, and high thermo-
stability, H2EH3 is a promising therapeutic to supplement
current single HER inhibitors and may act as a treatment for
HER2+ breast cancer with intrinsic or acquired resistance to
current drugs.
INTRODUCTION
20%–30% of breast cancer is characterized by HER2 overexpression
that correlates with poor prognosis, high aggressiveness, and
extensive drug resistance.1 Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized
antibody, is the first-line treatment for patients with HER2+ breast
cancer. However, the majority of patients eventually develop
resistance. Resistance to HER2-targeted therapies is associated with
increased levels of other HER family receptors.2 The HER family
consists of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (HER1),
HER2, HER3, and HER4.3 It is well-known that the HER family is
interdependent and displays functional redundancy in that the
blockade of one HER receptor can often be compensated by another
HER family member.4 EGFR, HER2, and HER3 contribute to the
initiation and progression of many cancers and are well-recognized
therapeutic targets. Ligand binding to HER receptors results in the
formation of homo- and hetero-dimers. EGFR is one of the most
studied HER family receptors and a key oncogenic driver in many
epithelial cancers.5 Accumulating evidence shows that HER3 is a
key node in many cancers and involved in the resistance against
EGFR- and HER2-targeted therapies through activation of a compen-
satory PI3K-AKT survival pathway.6,7 Resistance to trastuzumab in
breast cancer cell lines is associated with upregulation of EGFR and
HER3.2,8 A HER2/HER3 heterodimer has been identified to function
like an oncogene to support the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing
tumor cells.7 The cross-talk and compensatory functionalities of HER
family receptors provide strong rationales for co-targeting EGFR,
HER2, and HER3 in HER-dependent cancer treatment. In line with
the notion of combing treatment, bi-specific antibodies and pan-HER
antibodies have been developed and show more efficacy than single
receptor-targeting antibodies. Bispecific MM11 antibody targeting
both HER2 and HER3 is able to suppress the proliferation of
HER2-expressing tumor cells.9 Pan-HER with a six antibody mixture
targeting EGFR, HER2, and HER3 has been developed and has dis-
played superior potency compared to agents targeting single receptors
in preclinical studies.10
Because HER3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, TKIs (tyrosine-kinase
inhibitors) will be not effective in inhibiting HER3. Antibody combi-
nations are the current strategies to inhibit the HER family signaling
network.11,12 However, most of these antibodies have a high cost in
production and high immunogenicity. To address immunogenicity

 and the high cost of these antibodies, in our studies, we have
engineered a nucleic-acid-based multiple function molecule with a
small interfering RNA (siRNA) and two RNA aptamers. The new
siRNA-aptamer chimera is able to target EGFR/HER2/HER3 simul-
taneously, with low toxicity. Recently, an aptamer-siRNA chimera,
employing only RNA molecules, has become attractive for cell-
type-specific gene silencing. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) or RNA and selected through the in vitro enrichment
process.13 Like antibodies, aptamers can bind to a target with high
affinity and specificity. Due to small and oligonucleotide properties,
aptamers offer many advantages over antibodies, including non-
immunogenicity, high tissue penetration, thermostability, low cost,
and ease of synthesis and modification.14,15 Current cell-type-specific
RNA aptamers have been used for targeting delivery of siRNA and
drugs.16,17
HER3 aptamer has been identified and is able to specifically bind to
the extracellular domains of HER3.18 HER3 aptamer inhibits
HRG-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2.19 With a similar
generation approach, HER2 aptamer has been identified and synthe-
sized. HER2 aptamer shows high specificity to HER2+ cancer cell lines
but not HER2� cancer cell lines.20 In this study, we aim to target
HER2/HER3/EGFR in one molecule using two aptamers and a
siRNA. A new chimera was developed by fusing an EGFR siRNA
between HER2 aptamer and HER3 aptamer. This structure will
simultaneously block HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways and
induce EGFR silencing in HER2-expressing cells. With a three-in-
one structure, the new chimera will simplify the processes and cost
in manufacturing and preclinical and clinical testing and be less
complicated for patient administration. The new three-in-one design
will provide a new therapeutic paradigm to address the HER network
and overcome resistance to the therapies designed to target a single
HER family protein. Furthermore, this novel design is nontoxic,
simple, and cost effective compared with antibodies and small mole-
cule inhibitors.
RESULTS
HER2 Aptamer-EGFR siRNA-HER3 Aptamer (H2EH3) Chimera
Was Constructed and Characterized
The 30 terminus of HER3 aptamer (79 bases)18 was fused with the
anti-sense strand of EGFR siRNA, and the 30-terminus of HER2 ap-
tamer (34 bases)20 was fused with the sense strand of EGFR siRNA.
The dissociation constant (KD) value of HER2 aptamer is 3.49 nM,
and the KD value of HER3 aptamer is 45 nM. Between an aptamer
and a siRNA, 2–4 unpaired “A’s” are inserted to offer spatial flexibility
to each aptamer (Figure 1A). Through in vitro transcription, 20-fluoro
pyrimidines were incorporated into two RNA chains to enhance
serum stability. Two transcripts with 19-base complementing se-
quences (sense strand and anti-sense strand of EGFR siRNA) were
annealed together by heating for 3 min at 95�C, followed by slowly
cooling to room temperature within 1 hr. As shown in Figure 1A,
the new chimera, with one HER2 aptamer (molecular weight
[MW] 11.2 kDa), one EGFR siRNA, and one HER3 aptamer
(MW 25.4 kDa), was annealed into one molecule with a molecular
weight of 55.4 kDa, which is larger than each single aptamer and
larger than the renal glomerulus cutoff mass (30–50 kDa), but smaller
than an antibody (about 150 kDa). Thus, H2EH3 is expected to have a
longer circulation time than a single aptamer alone. We have put the
30 end of the anti-sense strand of EGFR siRNA with a 2-nt overhang,
which will promote siRNA-RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)
formation.21
Furthermore, we identified if H2EH3 possesses the activities of
HER2 aptamer, EGFR siRNA, and HER3 aptamer. First, we evalu-
ated the binding affinity of H2EH3 compared with HER2 aptamer
and HER3 aptamer individually. In Figure 1E, H2EH3 showed a
strong binding affinity comparable with HER2 aptamer and HER3
aptamer. To detect the EGFR-silencing activity of H2EH3, H2EH3
was transfected to BT474 cells using lipofectamine to evaluate
EGFR knockdown. As shown in Figure 1D, H2EH3 kept a similar
silencing effect as EGFR siRNA. In addition, H2EH3 has been incu-
bated with a dicer for 12 hr. The digestion pattern is shown in
Figure S1. The result showed that H2EH3 was digested with the
dicer and released an RNA fragment with the same size as EGFR
siRNA. This suggests that H2EH3 can be processed with RNA inter-
ference machinery.
H2EH3 Displayed Significant Cytotoxicity on HER2+HER3+ Cells
Next, we evaluated if H2EH3 shows cytotoxicity on breast cancer
cell lines. We first probed the abundance of HER2, HER3, and
EGFR in a panel of breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines,
including BT474, BT20, ES2, OVCAR8, SKBR3, Hs587T, MDA-
MB-231, and MCF7 by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1B,
BT474 and SKBR3 cells express the highest levels of HER2 among
all detected cell lines. ES2 and MDA-MB-231 cells are negative to
HER2, whereas BT20, OVCAR8, and Hs587T cell lines just show
slightly detectable HER2. BT474 and SKBR3 cells also express
high levels of HER3. OVCAR8 and MCF7 show a high abundance
of HER3, although with a trace amount of HER2. EGFR was
expressed on all detected cell lines. MCF7 has a much lower expres-
sion of EGFR than other cell lines, whereas BT20 and MDA-
MB-231, two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, show the
highest EGFR than other cell lines. BT474 and SKBR3 cells have
a medium level of EGFR expression.
Next, we detected the growth inhibitory effect of H2EH3 on these cell
lines using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of H2EH3 or controls, including
HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer, EGFR siRNA, mixture of HER2
aptamer, HER3 aptamer, and EGFR siRNA, non-targeting control
aptamer MG (specific to Malachite Green), or mutant H2EH3. As
shown in Figure 1C, the viability of BT474 and SKBR3 cells exposed
to H2EH3 for 72 hr was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent
manner. BT474 and SKBR3 cells only remain about 5%–10% viable
upon treatment with 2 mM H2EH3. Upon treatment with 2 mM
simply mixed HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer, and EGFR siRNA,
the viability remains 30% for BT474 and 50% for SKBR3. The results
suggest that three-in-one H2EH3 is superior to the simply mixed

 three individual components. HER3 aptamer and HER2 aptamer
all show dose-dependent cytotoxicity for BT474 and SKBR3 cells.
The efficacy of HER3 aptamer is more potent than that of HER2 ap-
tamer. Upon treatment with 2 mM aptamers, the viability of BT474 is
48% with HER3 aptamer and 60% with HER2 aptamer; similarly, the
viability of SKBR3 is 65% with HER3 aptamer and 75% with HER2
aptamer. EGFR siRNA only and Malachite green (MG) did not
show cytotoxicity to SKBR3 and BT474. Mutant H2EH3 (muH2EH3)
was constructed, which contained the same nucleic acid components
as H2EH3 and the same EGFR siRNA as H2EH3 but is missing the
original 3D conformations of HER2 and HER3 aptamers. muH2EH3
did not show cytotoxicity to any detected cell lines. MCF7 and BT20
cell lines do not have any response to H2EH3 treatment (Figure 1C).
The viability of MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cell lines shows only a
10%–20% decrease upon 2 mM H2EH3 treatments (Figure 1C, lower
panel). Although MCF7 cells have high HER3 expression but no
HER2 expression, HER3 aptamer and H2EH3 do not show inhibitory
effects on MCF7 growth. Furthermore, we detected if MCF7 cell sur-
vival is dependent on HER3. We have silenced HRR3 in MCF7 cells
and probed cell viability. As shown in Figure S2, cell viability only has
a 7% decrease, which indicates the HER family is not the major sur-
vival pathway for MCF7 proliferation. BT20, MDA-231, and Hs578T
are both HER2� and HER3�; thus, it is not surprising that their cell
viabilities do not decrease significantly upon H2EH3 treatment. These
results suggest that H2EH3 has a strong cell-type-specific targeting
capability.
H2EH3 Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in HER2+HER3+
Cell Lines
The decrease in cell viability may be attributed to reduced cell prolif-
eration and/or increased cell death. To identify these effects, we first
explored whether H2EH3 has interfered with cell cycle progression.
BT474 and SKBR3 cells were treated with H2EH3 at different concen-
trations for 24 and 48 hr. As shown in Figure 2A, BT474 cells showed
G2/M arrest in 24 hr and showed an increased subG1 population.
from 0.27% of untreated cells to 2.83% of cells treated with 2 mM
H2EH3. This suggests that the apoptosis of BT474 cells occurred after
48-hr treatment. SKBR3 cells showed slight G2/M arrest in 24 hr and
significantly increased the subG1 population in 24 and 48 hr, indi-
cating that SKBR3 cells underwent apoptosis within 24 hr.
To further assess induction of apoptosis by H2EH3, SKBR3 cells and
BT474 cells were treated with H2EH3 for 72 hr and stained with an-
nexin V/PI (propidium iodide) for flow cytometry analyses. As shown
in Figure 2B, for BT474 cells, early apoptosis (annexin V+/PI�)
increased from untreated 4.43% to 11.37%, 23%, and 20.91% treated
with H2EH3 at 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, and 2.0 mM, respectively; late stage
(annexin V+/PI+) increased from untreated 1.23% to 1.87%, 3.76%,
and 5.06% treated with H2EH3 at 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, and 2.0 mM,
respectively. muH2EH3 at the 0.5–2.0 mM range has <6% early
apoptosis and <5% late apoptosis. In SKBR3 cells, the most significant
change occurred on the late apoptosis stage. Late apoptosis of SKBR3
cells increased from untreated 1.27% to 9.82%, 10.02%, and 18.86%
when treated with H2EH3 at 0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM, respectively.
muH2EH3 at the 0.5–2.0 mM range has <7% late apoptosis. These re-
sults from the analyses of cell cycle progression and apoptosis suggest
that H2EH3 induces cell death through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
on HER2+HER3+ cell lines.
H2EH3 Reduced the Protein Expression Levels of EGFR, HER2,
and HER3 and Upregulated Cleaved Caspase-3 and p21
Because EGFR siRNA was inserted between HER2 and HER3 ap-
tamers, we expect to see EGFR gene knockdown. We hypothesize
that H2EH3 binding to cell receptors of HER2 and HER3 will cross
link two receptors and result in ligand-receptor complex internali-
zation. The internalized H2EH3 may lead to EGFR silencing.
First, we validated the internalization of H2EH3, which is the
prerequisite of siRNA silencing. BT474 cells were treated with
Cy5-H2EH3 and control Cy5-muH2EH3 aptamer. Confocal micro-
scopy with z stack was performed to visualize the subcellular
locations of H2EH3. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and en-
dosome/lysosomes were revealed by Lysotracker (green). As shown
in Figure 3A, after 12-hr incubation, H2EH3 has entered the cells
and presented in the cytoplasm, and some H2EH2 has escaped
from endosomes/lysosomes by showing red fluorescence, whereas
some H2EH3 entrapped in endosomes showed a yellow signal.
The result showed that HER2/HER3 dimerization can lead chimera
internalization.
After confirmation of H2EH3 internalization, we detected if EGFR
siRNA has triggered gene silencing. EGFR expression was evaluated
with western blot. As shown in Figure 3B, after treatment with
H2EH3 for 72 hr, EGFR expression levels in both BT474 and
SKBR3 cells were indeed significantly reduced at a dose-dependent
manner but not treated with muH2EH3 or scrambled siRNA
control.
Furthermore, we assessed if H2EH3 can reduce protein levels of
HER2 and HER3. SKBR3 and BT474 cells were treated with the
varying concentrations of H2EH3 for 72 hr, and HER2 and HER3
levels were quantified by western blot. As shown in Figure 3B,
H2EH3 treatment resulted in a pronounced reduction of protein
levels of HER2 and HER3 in SKBR3 and BT474 cells but not
treatments with muH2EH3 or scrambled siRNA control. This

 indicates H2EH3 has led ligand-induced HER2 and HER3 receptor
internalization and degradation, which results in the reduction of
protein levels of HER2 and HER3. From previous studies, targeting
a single HER family member often results in increased levels of other
HER receptors, which will compensate the activity of the inhibited
HER member and counteract the treatment efficacy.22,23 In contrast,
H2EH3 is able to significantly reduce the expression of all three recep-
tors, thereby effectively blocking the compensatory network of HER
members.
Next, we assessed whether H2EH3 has an impact on downstream
apoptotic signaling. Upon treatment with H2EH3, BT474 and
SKBR3 cells were probed for the expression of p21 and cleaved
Caspase-3 by western blot. Cleaved Caspase-3 is regarded as a
signature marker of apoptosis, and p21 upregulation is closely
related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3B,
p21 and cleaved Caspase-3 in SKBR3 and BT474 cells were indeed
significantly upregulated by H2EH3 at a dose-dependent manner.
The results indicate that H2EH3 induces cell growth inhibition
by activating the signaling pathways associated with cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis.
H2EH3 Possesses a High Binding Specificity to HER2 and HER3
Receptors and High Tumor-Targeting Capability In Vivo
To investigate whether H2EH3 indeed binds to HER2 and HER3
receptors, we used siRNAs to silence each receptor to assess binding
specificity. We transfected HER2 and/or HER3 siRNAs via lipofect-
amine to BT474 cells, and then detected a binding pattern after recep-
tor knockdown. We first identified HER2 and/or HER3 knockdown
with western blot (Figure 4A). After treatment with 100 nM HER2
siRNA and/or HER3 siRNA, the protein levels of HER2 and HER3
are significantly reduced. Then, HER2- and/or HER3-silenced
BT474 cells were compared with untreated BT474 on H2EH3 bind-
ing. BT474 cells (untreated or HER2/HER3 silenced) were first fixed
with 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS and then incubated with Cy5-labeled
H2EH3 or controls. As shown in Figure 4B, untreated BT474 cells
have a strong fluorescence peak and high fluorescence intensity
(red line). Upon knockdown of HER2 or HER3, the fluorescence
peak of single positive HER3+ cells (purple line) or HER2+ cells (black
line) has shifted to the left (lower intensity areas), which suggests
reduced binding following HER2 or HER3 knockdown. Upon knock-
down of both HER2 and HER3, most cells underwent dying. When
we analyzed the remaining cells, the fluorescence intensity of double

centrations of H2EH3 for 72 hr, and cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin-V-propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry.

 negative HER2-HER3-BT474 cells (blue line) shows the significant
decrease compared with normal BT474. These results indicate that
H2EH3 indeed possesses specificity toward HER2 and HER3
receptors.
To explore tumor-targeting capability and bio-distribution in vivo,
BT474 tumor-bearing mice were tail-vein injected with Cy5-H2EH3
or non-targeting control muH2EH3. As shown in Figure 4C, after a
half-hour injection, in the reference bright-field images (Figure 4C,
right), which show the locations of tumors, the tumors in H2EH3-
treated mice with high fluorescence intensity could be clearly delin-
eated from the surrounding background tissues with the Xenogen
IVIS100 imaging system, but not the tumors in non-targeting control
treated mice. The fluorescence signals can be detectable for 6 hr.
After whole body imaging, organs were removed and ex vivo imaging
was performed. As shown in Figure 4D, Cy5 fluorescence in

 H2EH3-treated tumors was detectable, but not in control muH2EH3-
treated tumors. It is not surprising that strong fluorescence is shown in
the intestines and stomach because those locations are the places for
clearance of chimeras from bodies. Noteworthy, Cy5 fluorescence sig-
nals are not detectable in organs, including the brain, spleen, liver,
heart, lung, kidney, muscle, and pancreas. These results suggest that
H2EH3 can bind to tumors in vivo, with high specificity.
H2EH3 Treatment Led to Decreased Tumor Growth in Breast
Cancer Xenografts
To investigate whether the in vitro anti-proliferative effect of H2EH3
could translate into in vivo efficacy, we tested H2EH3 in breast cancer
subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts. In the start test, BT474 cells

were subcutaneously injected into 5- to 6-week-
old female athymic nu/nu mice at the left flank.
Upon the tumor reaching 100 mm3, mice were
treated with PBS, mixture (HER2 aptamer,
HER3 aptamer, and EGFR siRNA) (8 nmol of
each component), or H2EH3 (8 nmol) by
intra-tumor injection every other day for
5 weeks. As shown in Figures 5A–5C, H2EH3
treatment showed pronounced tumor growth
inhibition and is superior to the mixture of
HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer, and EGFR
siRNA. Tumors in H2EH3-treated mice have a
6- to 7-fold reduction in size compared with
PBS-treated controls and about a 1.5-fold reduc-
tion compared with those treated with the
mixture of HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer,
and EGFR siRNA. Next, mammary orthotopic
xenografts were set up by injection of BT474
cells in mammary fat pads. Tumor (50 mm3)
bearing mice were intravenously (via tail vein) treated with H2EH3
(8 nmol), mixture (HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer, and EGFR
siRNA), or PBS every 3 days for 4 weeks. As shown in Figures 5E
and 5F, H2EH3 treatment has achieved a 7- to 8-fold reduction in tu-
mor sizes compared with the PBS control group, and a 3- to 4-fold
reduction compared with those treated with the mixture of three
components. Due to the limitation in available injection times
through the tail vein, in this experiment, 4-week administration
was taken. These results show H2EH3 is able to effectively inhibit
HER2-expressing breast cancer growth through both intratumoral
and intravenous (i.v.) injection. As a tumor control, MDA-MB-231
cells (HER2� and HER3�) were used to set up mammary orthotopic
xenografts. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with H2EH3 and

 controls through i.v. injection. As shown in Figure S7, there is no sig-
nificant treatment efficacy in the groups treated with H2EH3 or the
mixture of three components compared with the PBS control group.
The results proved the targeting capability of H2EH3 in vivo.
H2EH3 Enabled Downregulation of HER2, HER3, and HER3 and
Triggered Apoptosis In Vivo
To determine the target specificity of our H2EH3, immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) assay was performed to validate gene knockdown
and apoptosis in vivo. Tumor tissues from subcutaneous and ortho-
topic xenografts were collected and examined for the expression of
HER2, HER3, EGFR, p21, and cleaved Caspase-3. As shown in Fig-
ure 6A, H2EH3 treatment has led to reduced protein levels of
EGFR, HER2, and HER3 and increased cleaved Caspase-3 and p21
in subcutaneous tumors through intratumoral injection (Figure 6A).
Similarly, the reduced expression of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 and the
increase of cleaved Caspase-3 and p21 are visualized in orthotopic
tumors through intravenous injection of H2EH3 (Figure 6B). We
also proved EGFR knockdown in tumor tissues by western blot, as
shown in Figure S6. These findings are consistent with the in vitro
results in Figure 3B. The histology and western blot results suggest
that H2EH3 enables intervention of EGFR/HER2/HER3 concomi-
tantly and induces tumor cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vivo,
which is translated into significant suppression of tumor growth in
mouse xenograft models.
H2EH3 Did Not Show Detectable Toxicity
During treatment, the body weights of mice were measured. There
was no significant difference in body weights between the PBS- and
H2EH3-treated groups (Figures 5D and 5H). Furthermore, we
examined the histopathology of major organs from mice that have
experienced systemic drug administration by i.v. injection. As shown
in Figure 7A, H&E staining revealed that there were no pathological
changes observed in these organs of H2EH3-treated mice. Addition-
ally, we have detected the possible innate immune response of H2EH3
by mixed lymphocyte reaction assay. It was reported that RNA syn-
thesis by transcription may induce interferon-a (IFN-a) upregula-
tion.24 We treated human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
with H2EH3 for 48 hr. IFN-a and pro-inflammatory cytokine inter-
leukin-6 (IL-6) were measured with ELISA. As shown in Figure 7B,
there was no detectable IFN-a at a concentration of up to 4 mM
H2EH3. IL-6 levels in PBMCs treated with 1–4 mM H2EH3 did not
show a statistical difference compared with untreated control (Fig-
ure 7B). Taken together, these results suggest that nucleic-acid-based
H2EH3 has no discernible toxicity to the host and may not trigger an
innate immune response.
DISCUSSION
HER2-targeted antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab,
have revolutionized the treatment of HER+ breast cancer. However,
66%–88% of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer shows resistance to a

 single regimen of trastuzumab treatment.25 Combinations of trastu-
zumab with either paclitaxel or docetaxel have been used and provide
improved treatment efficacy, but 15% of patients also develop resis-
tance to these combination therapies.26 Moreover, these combina-
tions are associated with significant cardiotoxicity and anaphylaxis.27
There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop improved combination
therapeutics for HER2+ breast cancer patients.
Several laboratories have shown de novo expression of either EGFR
and/or HER3 in trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cell
lines, and these lines characteristically acquire sensitivity to either
EGFR- or HER-targeted agents (e.g., gefitinib or cetuximab).2
Based on these observations, here we have developed an inhibitor
that can simultaneously block EGFR, HER2, and HER3 signaling.
Because HER4 expression has been associated with increased ER
expression28 and low cell proliferation rates29 and has generally
been correlated with a favorable outcome in breast cancer pa-
tients,30,31 this HER family member was excluded as a target in
these studies.
In our studies, to target heterodimer HER2/HER3, we propose that
one multifunctional molecule will provide more spatial advantages
to disable a heterodimer located in close proximity than two individ-
ual targeting molecules. Therefore, we fused HER2 aptamer and
HER3 aptamer together with a double-stranded EGFR siRNA, which
acts as a linker as well as an additional therapeutic component. 2–4
unpaired bases were put between each aptamer and EGFR siRNA
to warrant aptamer flexibility for target binding. In our previous
studies,32 we have proven that 2–4 unpaired bases are essential to
maintain conjugated aptamer functionalities. HER2 and HER3 ap-
tamers will direct EGFR siRNA to internalize to the HER2- and
HER3-expressing cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. We
expect that double targeting on HER2 and HER3 will increase cargo
delivery to breast cancer cells compared to targeting one receptor, and
future studies are being designed to test this hypothesis in vivo. Our
results showed that H2EH3 can significantly silence EGFR in vitro
and in vivo. Therefore, when using H2EH3, both aptamers as well
as the siRNA all have potent anti-tumor activities. Each aptamer
has dual functions: as a receptor antagonist to block ligand binding

 and as a cell-type-specific siRNA delivery agent. Our studies demon-
strate that H2EH3 is able to significantly reduce the protein levels of
HER2 and HER3. Comparatively, Pan-HER antibodies can reduce
total protein levels of HER2 and HER3,12 and HER3 antibody
(KTN3379) is also able to reduce total HER3 protein.33 This indicates
aptamer, like antibody, possesses the capability to induce ligand-
receptor endocytosis, followed by degradation.
Our studies in vitro (Figure 1C) and in vivo (Figures 5A and 5E)
demonstrated that the mixture of HER2 aptamer, HER3 aptamer,
and EGFR siRNA has treatment efficacy but less than that of
H2EH3. This is because HER2 aptamer and HER3 aptamer have
played blocking functionalities. EGFR siRNA in the mixture cannot
play silencing activity because free EGFR siRNA cannot enter cyto-
plasm without any delivery aid. In addition, a single HER2 aptamer
is very small (11.2 kDa), which falls in the size of renal depletion
(30–50 kDa). Shorter circulation time will result in the lower efficacy
of unconjugated HER2 aptamer than the conjugated one. Due to a
lack of EGFR siRNA activity and shorter circulation time of single
aptamers, simply mixed three components have less efficacy than
three-in-one H2EH3. As shown in Figures 1C, 5A, and 5E, H2EH3
has shown consistently better efficacy than the mixture of HER2
aptamer, HER3 aptamer, and EGFR siRNA.
Three-in-one chimera will significant increase overall drug size
compared with each aptamer alone, suggesting that H2EH3 may
have a longer circulation life time than each aptamer alone. In previ-

ous studies, polyethylene glycol (PEG; 20–40
kDa) has been added into chimeras for prolong-
ing circulation life time in vivo.34,35 In our design,
conjugating two aptamers not only is amenable
to reduce steric hindrance for ease of blocking
hetero-dimerized two receptors, but can also
increase structure size for longer circulation as
compared with two single aptamers, and studies
are ongoing to test this hypothesis.
Such
a
nucleic-acid-based
aptamer-siRNA
chimera is a unique class of targeting therapeu-
tics that has potential for clinical translation.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) aptamer has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a thera-
peutic for macular degradation.36 There are many aptamer-
mediated therapeutics under development for the treatment of
conventional undruggable diseases, in which aptamers act as antag-
onist drugs37 or delivery vehicles for small chemical drugs, proteins,
siRNA, or even nanoparticles.38,39 RNA-based aptamer-siRNA
chimera can be generated by in vitro transcription and solid-phase
chemical synthesis. Compared with antibodies, aptamer-siRNA chi-
meras provide ease of large-scale production, low immunogenicity,
ease of modification, high thermostability, and a small size, whereas
antibodies are cell-based products, associated with high immunoge-
nicity, are sensitive to temperature, and have a high cost in
manufacturing. Unmodified RNAs are sensitive to nucleases, which
have higher degradation rates for pyrimidine residues. 20-amino-
pyrimidines and 20-fluoro-pyridines have been successfully incor-
porated
into
aptamers
and
FDA-approved
oligonucleotide
drugs40,41 to resist nuclease-induced degradation. We have proven
that 20-fluoro-modified aptamer-siRNA chimera can have over
24 hr of half-life in 50% serum-containing buffer.32,42 It has been
demonstrated that 2-fluoro modification of aptamer is safe and
well-tolerated and also has increased binding affinity to the
targets.43
Due to the accessibility of breast cancer, we tested the treatment
efficacy of H2EH3 by intratumoral injection. For preparing to treat
metastatic breast cancer, we tested the treatment efficacy of

 H2EH3 by intravenous injection. Through both administration
routes, we have seen the potent inhibition of tumor growth.
From the biodistribution study, through tail-vein injection of
H2EH3, we did not find the nonspecific accumulation of H2EH3
in other major organs (brain, heart, lung, kidney, muscle,
pancreas, spleen, and liver), except the intestine and stomach.
Because we found non-targeting control aptamer also accumulated
in the intestine and stomach, we may not say H2EH3 has an off-
target effect by binding to other organs. Although HER2 and
HER3 have been widely expressed in many organs, it is possible
that there is a big difference of HER2/HER3 in the quantity at
normal organs versus at breast tumors, thus creating a therapeutic
window.
The new RNA therapeutic with low immunogenicity and low toxicity
will provide a potent addition to HER-targeting therapeutics for
HER2-expressing breast cancer. Our results show the new chimera
can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HER2-expressing cells
and significantly inhibits tumor growth in breast cancer xenografts.
We envision that H2EH3 may be extended to treat other tumors
that are dependent on the HER family for proliferation, such as
lung and head and neck cancers.44,45

Cytotoxicity Assay
Cellular cytotoxicity was quantified by measuring WST-8 formazan
using CCK-8 (Dojindo, Japan). Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate
at a density of 5 � 103 in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hr at 37�C.
Cell lines were incubated with the varying concentrations of
H2EH3 or controls for 72 hr without transfection reagents (e.g., lip-
ofectamine). CCK-8 solution (10 mL) was added to each well and
incubated at 37�C for 4 hr. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using
a microplate reader.
Western Blot
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (M-PER Mammalian Protein Extrac-
tion Reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 1x Protease Inhib-
itor Cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysates were centrifuged at
12,000 � g for 10 min at 4�C. The supernatant was collected and
the protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). An equal amount of proteins was
mixed with 4x Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% b-mercaptoe-
thanol and heated at 95�C for 10 min. Denatured samples was
separated on 8%–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat milk overnight at 4�C and then incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4�C, followed by incubation with horse-
radish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hr at
room temperature. After ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce)
was added onto the membrane, the signals were captured by the expo-
sure to X-ray film.
Dicer Assay
H2EH3 (4 mg) was digested using human recombinant dicer enzyme
(2 U) at 37�C for 12 hr following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Genlantis, San Diego, CA). Reaction was quenched by adding dicer
stop solution. The digestion pattern was analyzed on 3.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Cell Cycle Analysis
SKBR3 and BT474 cells were treated with the different concentrations
of H2EH3 for 24 and 48 hr. Collected cells were fixed in cold 70%
ethanol. After a fix for 30 min at 4�C, ethanol-fixed cells were centri-
fuged and washed once with PBS. The cells were treated with RNase A
and stained with PI for 30 min at 37�C. Cellular DNA contents were
measured by exciting PI at 488 nm and measuring the emission at
580 nm using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer.
Detection of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry
SKBR3 and BT474 cells were treated with the different concentrations
of H2EH3 for 72 hr. The cells were harvested and washed in cold PBS.
Cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin-V-PI solution for
1 hr at room temperature. Cells (1 � 104/sample) were acquired by
BD FACSCalibur and analyzed using BD FACStation software.
Knockdown of HER2 and/or HER3
BT474 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 5 � 105 cells/
well for 24 hr. HER2 siRNA and/or HER3 siRNA or control siRNA
were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells
were harvested 72 hr post-transfection, and western blot was per-
formed to confirm gene knockdown. HER2- and/or HER3-silenced
cells were subjected to aptamer-binding assay by BD flow cytometry.
Bio-distribution Assay
To evaluate the bio-distribution properties of H2EH3, tumor-bearing
mice (n = 3 per group) were intravenously administered Cy5-labeled
H2EH3 (20 nmol, 200 mL) or an equal mole amount of Cy5-labeled
muH2EH3. The whole-body images were obtained at 0.5 and 6 hr
using the Xenogen IVIS100 imaging system by setting the wavelength
at an excitation of 640 nm and emission at 710 nm. After 6-hr injec-
tion of Cy5-labeled chimeras, mice were euthanized with CO2
following whole-body imaging and organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen,

 kidney, muscle, brain, stomach, and intestine) were removed. The
ex vivo imaging of Cy5 signal was performed using Xenogen IVIS100.
In Vivo Xenograft Treatment Study
4- to 5-week-old female athymic nu/nu mice were injected with
tumor cells (BT474 or MDA-MB-231) (2 � 106) mixed with Matrigel
(v/v 1:1) (Corning, NY) subcutaneously at the left flank or orthotopi-
cally at the mammary fat pads. Following the establishment of tumors
(100 mm3), mice were randomly divided into three groups in subcu-
taneous xenografts, H2EH3 (8 nmol, 200 mL), a mixture of HER2
aptamer, EGFR siRNA, and HER3 aptamer (each 8 nmol, total of
200 mL), or PBS (200 mL) was intra-tumorally injected every other
day for 5 weeks. In the orthotopic xenografts, upon the tumor reach-
ing 50 mm3, mice were administrated with H2EH3 (8 nmol, 200 mL)
or PBS every 3 days through tail-vein intravenous injection for
4 weeks. Tumor sizes and body weights were measured twice a
week. The animals were euthanized 2 days after the last treatment.
The tumors and organs (liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, muscle,
blood, and intestine) were removed and fixed in 10% formalin buffer.
The sections of tissues were analyzed by IHC.
Histology Assay
Tumors and organs (spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, heart, liver, and
muscle) were collected from xenografts and fixed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde. Sections (6 mm) were cut and mounted on the slides
and deparaffinized in xylene and ethyl alcohol. For IHC assay, sec-
tions were incubated in 3% normal goat serum for 2 hr and incubated
with primary antibodies: caspase-3 (1:200), HER2 (1:800), HER3
(1:250), p21 (1:50), and EGFR (1:50). After washing, the sections
were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200) (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hr. Following washing, the sections were
incubated with VECTASTAIN ABC reagents for 30 min. The images
were captured with a Nuance fluorescence microscope with a bright
field imaging system.
ELISA Assay
Normal human PBMCs were separated with Ficoll-Plaque Plus
(STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were seeded into 24-well plates
at 2 � 106/well for 24 hr in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum. H2EH3, with varying concentrations, was added into
cells, and cells were incubated for 48 hr in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37�C. The cell culture supernatant was detected with human IFN-a
and IL-6 ELISA kits following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism software was used to perform all statistical analyses.
The data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t test. The differ-
ences of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
