Sperm are highly differentiated and the activities that reprogram them for embryonic
development during fertilization have historically been considered unique to the oocyte.
We here challenge this view and demonstrate that mouse embryos in the mitotic cell cycle
can also directly reprogram sperm for full-term development. Developmentally incompetent
haploid embryos (parthenogenotes) injected with sperm developed to produce healthy
offspring at up to 24% of control rates, depending when in the embryonic cell cycle injection
took place. This implies that most of the first embryonic cell cycle can be bypassed in sperm
genome reprogramming for full development. Remodelling of histones and genomic
50-methylcytosine and 50-hydroxymethylcytosine following embryo injection were distinct
from remodelling in fertilization and the resulting 2-cell embryos consistently possessed
abnormal transcriptomes. These studies demonstrate plasticity in the reprogramming of
terminally differentiated sperm nuclei and suggest that different epigenetic pathways or
kinetics can establish totipotency.

ertilization integrates multiple cell-autonomous processes to
transform a sperm and an oocyte (egg) into a totipotent
embryo.
In
mammals,
the
fertilizing
sperm
triggers
embryogenesis by inducing a calcium-dependent phospho-relay
to remove the unique cytostatic factor, Emi2, resulting in
metaphase II (mII) exit and completion of meiosis1,2. Sperm
membranes, mitochondria and perinuclear matrix components
are dismantled and the unique non-histone major sperm
nucleoprotein, protamine, is replaced by maternal histones3–5.
Both parental chromatin sets undergo signature patterns of global
modification2,4. Paternal and, to some extent, maternal genomes
undergo active 50-methylcytosine (5mC) depletion4,6–8 accompa-
nied by Tet3-catalysed production of 50-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC). In the mouse, meiotic completion is followed by the
formation of visible pronuclei (membranated compartments that
uniquely separate each parental genome) B4.5 h after sperm
entry; DNA synthesis and transcription respectively initiate after
B8 and B10 h (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b)2,5.
Reprogramming during fertilization represents an extreme
cellular potency change, from the assured death of sperm and
oocyte to the emergence of the embryonic totipotent state able to
engender an entire organism. Sperm are terminally differentiated,
post-meiotic germ cells that are exhaustively remodelled during
fertilization4,5 and nothing suggests that sperm are capable of
being reprogrammed to totipotency by any other cell than
oocytes, which are specialized for the role9. Sperm injected well
after mII exit have so far failed to support development10–14.
Although
embryonic
stem
(ES)
cell
nuclei
participate
in
development when injected into pro-metaphase 1-cell15 or
interphase
2-cell16
embryos,
they
are
pluripotent,
contain
diploid
nucleosomal
chromatin
and
are
efficient
nuclear
transfer donors relative to somatic cells17. Since ES cells transit
through a quasi-2-cell embryonic state during culture18, early
embryonic reprogramming of their nuclei may be minimal. By
contrast, sperm possess structurally unique toroidal chromatin
whose principal nucleoprotein is protamine3. We therefore
investigated
whether
embryos
also
possess
the
ability
to
reprogram differentiated cell nuclei exemplified by the inert,
protaminic chromatin of sperm, to instate totipotency.
We now report that haploid parthenogenetic embryos injected
with sperm undergo distinctive chromatin remodelling, including
altered protamine-histone exchange kinetics, different 5hmC and
histone modification dynamics, parental chromatin remodelling
asynchrony
and
abnormal
gene
expression
compared
to
normal fertilization. Nevertheless, this distinctive remodelling
can result in full-term development. Our work suggests that
sperm reprogramming sufficient to support full and healthy
development can occur not only when mII oocytes are fertilized,
but in mitotic embryos well after meiotic exit, via anomalous
epigenetic pathways or kinetics.
Results
Development in vitro of parthenogenotes injected with sperm.
We assessed the ability of parthenogenotes to reprogram sperm at
different stages of the first cell cycle. We selected haploid
parthenogenotes as our starting point so that the introduction
of a sperm would potentially restore diploidy and rescue devel-
opment. Parthenogenotes also allow us to eliminate potential
contributions of paternal contributions earlier in fertilization and
have previously been used to probe mitotic reprogramming of
sperm10–14. Parthenogenetic haploid (ph) embryos generated
by exposing mII oocytes to strontium chloride (SrCl2) were
examined 7, 10 or 13 h after treatment started (ph-7, -10 and -13)
(Fig.
1a;
Supplementary
Fig.
1a–c).
SrCl2
induced
rapid
Geminin degradation typical of that seen in somatic cell G1
(Supplementary
Fig.
1d)
but
differing
from
pluripotent
cells in which Geminin escapes degradation19. Geminin and
Cdt1 accumulated in the pronuclei of ph embryos, dispersing
cytoplasmically after pronucleus (pn) membrane breakdown
(pnMBD; Supplementary Fig. 1e). Following sperm injection
(ICSI) of ph-7 embryos (phICSI-7), paternal chromatin remained
compact with little morphological change for Z5 h until the
onset of maternal pnMBD (12–13 h after the start of SrCl2
treatment; Supplementary Fig. 2). By contrast, following ICSI of
ph-13 parthenogenotes (phICSI-13) soon after pnMBD, sperm
began decondensing within 1 h (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 2e),
although spindle assembly on paternal chromatin was incomplete
prior to the first mitotic cell division (Supplementary Fig. 2g,
asterisk). The timing of cell division in phICSI-13 was similar to
that of ph-13 controls (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Cell division produced 2-cell embryos with four classes of
nuclear
configuration
whose
proportions
differed
between
phICSI-7 and -13 (Fig. 1b); one class comprised 2-cell embryos
with one biparental and one uniparental (maternal) blastomere
(2 þ 1). Altogether, 34.1–37.2% of phICSI embryos (nZ104)
developed to the blastocyst stage, compared with 72.9% (n ¼ 85)
for mock-injected haploid controls and 94% (n ¼ 84) in ICSI
(Supplementary Table 1 and ’ph’ in Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Developmental failure in phICSI-13 largely occurred prior to the
morula stage (29.5% of embryos) and during blastocyst formation
(33.3%), but most (455%) phICSI-7 and -10 embryos arrested
during blastocyst formation (Supplementary Table 1). Sperm-
derived
pCAG-mtdTomato,
Nanog-GFP
and
pOct4-mCherry
transgenes were expressed in embryonic day 5 (E5.0) phICSI-13
blastocysts (Fig. 1c,d; Supplementary Fig. 4a–e), suggesting that
reprogramming had enabled paternal genome activity. Ratios of
Oct4- and Cdx2-expressing cells were normal in phICSI-13
blastocysts (Supplementary Figs 3b and 4f).
Full development of phICSI embryos. When 2-cell phICSI
embryos were transferred to surrogate mothers, offspring of both
sexes were born with overall efficiencies (that is, without
eliminating aneuploid nuclear classes; Fig. 1b) of 1.0% for
phICSI-7 (n ¼ 465 embryos transferred), 1.8% for phICSI-10
(n ¼ 384)
and
8.1%
for
phICSI-13
(n ¼ 259;
Fig.
2a,
Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Birth and
placental weights in phICSI were in the control range, without
evidence of fetal overgrowth, lifespan attenuation or other
cloning-associated anomalies (Fig. 2b,c; Supplementary Fig. 5c);
the first phICSI-13 survivors, a female (Phicsia) and male
(Phicsim) were healthy and fertile (Fig. 2a), dying of natural
causes after 1.5 and 2.5 years respectively. Sperm from the inbred
strain, CBA/Ca, supported phICSI development (Supplementary
Fig. 5d,e) and phICSI with spontaneously arising parthenogenotes
(after pnMBD and approximately equivalent to ph-13) from
Plcz-ires-Venus
(PiV)
transgenic
females20

(Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 5f–h; Supplementary Table 1),
demonstrating
sperm
reprogramming
after
autonomous
parthenogenesis. These experiments show that mitotic embryos
can support full-term development in phICSI and suggest that
development was more efficient the closer sperm injection was to
mitotic M-phase21.
To track lineage contributions of uniparental and biparental
blastomeres in phICSI, we injected sperm carrying a ubiquitously
expressed Cre transgene into floxed membrane tdTomato (mtdT)
parthenogenotes (Supplementary Fig. 6)22. In the resulting

Most
cells in
phICSI-
mTmGCre fetuses were mGFP-positive but with detectable
mtdT DNA at E11.5. Offspring expressed mGFP with no
detectable mtdT DNA (Supplementary Fig. 6c–g), indicating
that only biparental cells persisted at term.
To address whether uniparental lineages were necessary to
complement defects early in development, we ablated the
uniparental 2-cell blastomere of phICSI-13 (2 þ 1) embryos
(phICSI-13-1bla; Fig. 2a). 10.4% of phICSI-13-1bla embryos
(24.0% of controls; 10.4 versus 43.4%) developed to term, with a
similar
rate
for
CBA/Ca
sperm
(Supplementary
Table
1;
Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). Thus, phICSI engendered totipotency,
producing
biparental
blastomeres
that
supported
full
development at readily detectable rates.
Full development by spermatid injection into parthenogenotes.
We next evaluated whether parthenogenotes were able to
reprogram nucleosomal chromatin. Round spermatids were
considered good candidates because naive pluripotent ES cells
have been
obtained
from
blastocysts
produced
by
round
spermatid
injection
(ROSI)
into
ph
2-cell
embryos14.
Accordingly, we performed ROSI into ph embryos (phROSI)
within 30 min of pnMBD (phROSI-pnMBD-0 h) or 1 or 2 h
post-pnMBD (Fig. 3a). Ubiquitously expressed transgenic mtdT
was used to mark the paternal (spermatid) participation in
development. Although development in phICSI declined the
greater the time between pnMBD and sperm injection (nZ73),
the
highest
developmental
rate
for
phROSI
was
when
round spermatid nuclei were injected 2.0–2.5 h post-pnMBD
(phROSI-pnMBD-2 h; 34.1%; n ¼ 123), with 26.8% mtdT-positive
blastocysts (Fig. 3b,c; Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). These results
show
that
embryos
develop
in
vitro
following
phROSI,
with paternal genome participation, and that optimal paternal
chromatin reprogramming windows are different for nucleosomal
round spermatids (phROSI)23 and protaminic sperm (phICSI).
To
examine
developmental
potential
following
phROSI,
phROSI-pnMBD-2 h 2-cell embryos were transferred to surrogate
mothers (Fig. 3d,e). Live pups were produced at a rate of 2.6% per
transferred embryo (n ¼ 213), with 31.7% of transferred control
ROSI embryos (n ¼ 50) producing live offspring. ROSI and
phROSI average body masses were similar at term (1.38±0.05 g

 (n ¼ 16) versus 1.49±0.09 g (n ¼ 6), ROSI versus phROSI) but
phROSI placentas were larger (0.14±0.01 g (n ¼ 16) versus
0.17±0.02 g (n ¼ 6), P ¼ 0.028; Fig. 3d), possibly due to the
larger average litter sizes in ROSI (3.2 versus 1.2). Both ROSI and
phROSI offspring could develop into fertile adulthood (Fig. 3e).
These results indicate that the mitotic machinery of 1-cell stage
embryos can directly remodel round spermatid nucleosomal
chromatin leading to the production of healthy offspring.
Developmental and epigenetic reprogramming in phICSI. In
phICSI, sperm reprogramming bypasses early embryonic events
(for example, meiotic exit, DNA synthesis and pn formation) and
is no longer synchronised with maternal chromatin remodelling.
We took developmental and epigenetic approaches to investigate
whether this might account for depressed rates of phICSI-13
development compared with those of ICSI controls.
As a control for developmental stage skipping in early
embryogenesis, including the possible dysregulation of DNA
synthesis,
we
transferred
male
pn
(containing
the
mtdT
transgene) of ICSI-derived embryos into ph 2-cell blastomeres.
We
based
transfer
timing
on
early
embryo
(pro)nuclear
membrane breakdown and division kinetics (Supplementary
Fig. 8a–c), and on BrdU incorporation as an indicator of S-phase
DNA synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e). Times of correspond-
ing (pro)nuclear membrane breakdown and cell division events
were respectively similar in ph and ICSI-derived embryos
(Supplementary Fig. 8a–c). BrdU incorporation in the nuclei of
81.8% (n ¼ 11) of 2-cell ph embryos had already initiated 1–2 h
after 1- to 2-cell cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 8d,e). From these
data, we ascribed zygotes at 4 h and new 2-cell embryos
(o30 min post division) to an early, G1-phase group (pnT-G1)
and zygotes at 10 h and later 2-cell embryos (28 h after ICSI or
SrCl2 treatment) to a late, G2-phase group (pnT-G2; Fig. 4a).
When pn were transferred 4 h post-ICSI (with mtdT sperm)
into haploid blastomeres o30 min after the first mitotic division
(pnT-G1), 79.8±4.8% (n ¼ 38) of the embryos developed to the
expanded blastocyst stage and 73.7±9.0% were mtdT-positive
(Fig. 4b,c; Supplementary Table 1). DNA synthesis was detected
in all pnT-G1 embryos after pn transfer (n ¼ 7; Fig. 4d). Transfer
of late-stage pn (10 h after mtdT ICSI) to 2-cell ph blastomeres
28 h after SrCl2 exposure (pnT-G2, n ¼ 46), produced 58.5±4.8%
blastocysts, of which 92.6±7.2% were mtdT-positive (Fig. 4a–c).
When 2-cell embryos from the pnT-G1 group were transferred to
surrogate mothers, two (3.6±0.1%, n ¼ 56) developed to term,
although both died perinatally15 and there were no offspring in
the pnT-G2 group (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Table 1). Control
pronuclear (pnTz-G1 and -G2) and cytoplast transfer (CyT-G1
and -G2) (Fig. 4a) resulted rates of term (31.9–46.3%, 35rnr39;
Fig. 4e) that were comparable to those of ICSI-1bla embryos
(Supplementary Table 1).
These results are consistent with multiple steps being required
for sperm chromatin to attain high developmental potential
during the change from meiotic-to-mitotic cell cycles. Some of

 these steps are omitted in phICSI and pronuclear transfer
and may reduce reprogramming, although we cannot exclude
a technical contribution including lack of precise cell cycle
synchrony between donor pronuclei and recipients in the
pnT series.
We next characterized genome reprogramming in phICSI by
comparing chromatin dynamics in phICSI and control ICSI
embryos at the same times after sperm injection. Most protamine
was lost from transgenic protamine-mCherry (Prm2-mCherry)
sperm within 2 h of ICSI (n ¼ 18) or phICSI-13 (8rnr14), but
not phICSI-7 (7rnr9; Fig. 5a). Parental chromatin sets
possessed 2- to 5-fold reductions of histone H1 levels 2.5 h after
sperm injection in phICSI-13 (Fig. 5b,c; Supplementary Fig. 2d,e).
Sperm dimensions remained unchanged in phICSI-7 for 5 h
(Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 2d) indicating decondensation
failure.
The
paternal:maternal
nuclear
volume
ratio
in
phICSI-13 embryos (0.8±0.1) was 66.7% of that in zygotes
(1.2±0.1, nZ10, Po0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 9a), suggesting
that anomalous nuclear remodelling occurred in phICSI-13
and allowing us to identify the paternal nucleus. Deposition of
cRNA-encoded histone H3.3 onto paternal chromatin was slower
in phICSI-13 than it was in control ICSI and had not been
completed by the end of M-phase (Supplementary Fig. 10a).
Taken with data from phICSI-7 (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 2d),
this corroborates a higher efficiency of sperm chromatin
remodelling during M-phase than other cell cycle stages21.
We next applied immunofluorescence microscopy7,8,24–27 to
ask if epigenetic modifications also differed between phICSI and
ICSI at given times after sperm injection. Global levels of
H4K12ac in phICSI-13 were similar to controls 2 and 6 h after
sperm injection (18rnr24; Fig. 6a,b). Although all phICSI-13
maternal H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels were initially low, by
6 h they were similar to ICSI (9rnr22; Fig. 6a,b). However,
levels of H3K9me2 in phICSI-13 maternal chromatin were
invariably persistently lower than controls (o85% levels at 2 h,
o40% at 6 h; 20rnr24; Fig. 6a–c). These experiments compare
given times after sperm injection and may not account for cell
cycle or other potential disparities, but they indicate that the
epigenetic trajectories taken for chromatin ICSI and phICSI
exhibit similarities (for example, H4K12ac levels), differences that
recovered (for example, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels) and
sustained disparities (for example, H3K9me2 levels).
Since DNA modification is linked to histone remodelling and is
a characteristic of zygotic reprogramming28, we investigated its
behaviour in phICSI. Paternal 5hmC levels were higher (4100%)
than maternal 5hmC levels in ICSI controls7 but in all (n ¼ 13) of
2 þ 1-class phICSI-13 embryos the paternal:maternal ratio was
markedly lower, at 55% (P ¼ 0.0055; Supplementary Fig. 9b,c).
This pattern was always (n ¼ 10) conserved when sperm were
injected into zygotes (zygotic ICSI, zICSI) and in phICSI-13 1 þ 1
embryos
(Supplementary
Figs
9d,e
and
11a,b).
The
low
paternal:maternal 5hmC ratio always (n ¼ 15) persisted 14 h
post division (48%; Po0.001; Fig. 7a,b) and to at least the second
M-phase in all (n ¼ 18) embryos (Supplementary Fig. 11c).

 parthenogenotes (assay details are described in the Methods). In
contrast to negative controls (beads lacking DNA), DNA-beads
injected into mII oocytes stained with a DNA dye and after 6 h
acquired H4K12ac and microtubules (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c).
Deposition of cRNA-encoded histone H3.3 occurred at similar
rates
onto
paternal
chromatin
in
ICSI
and
DNA-beads
(Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). These findings, corroborated below,
suggest that the DNA-beads assay provided a faithful proxy for
epigenetic modification in 1-cell embryos. We therefore further
characterized 5hmC dynamics with latex beads conjugated to
5mC-containing DNA (5mC-beads; Fig. 7c,d; Supplementary
Fig. 12b,c). Beads injected into mII oocytes were labelled by
anti-5mC antibody after 7 h, but 5hmC was undetected (Fig. 7d;
Supplementary Fig. 12d). 5hmC was also undetected after B7 h
on 5mC-beads injected into ph-13 parthenogenotes (ph-20
( þ 7 h) in Fig. 7e). However, when oocytes injected with
5mC-beads were activated with SrCl2, 5hmC became detectable
after 6–7 h (ph-6 in Fig. 7e and 7 h in Supplementary Fig. 12e)
and remained after 20–30 h (ph-20 ( þ 20 h) in Fig. 7e and 30 h in
Supplementary Fig. 12e). 5hmC was not detectable when the
beads were conjugated to unmethylated DNA (Fig. 7e). This
suggests that early embryonic regulation of 5hmC is 5mC- and
cell-cycle-dependent, consistent with differences between ICSI
and phICSI-13 (Fig. 7a,b; Supplementary Fig. 9b,c).
Given
that
the dynamics
of
5hmC were
abnormal
in
phICSI-13, we determined whether the kinetics of 5mC were
also
disrupted.
Control
embryos
(n ¼ 12)
contained
low
paternal:maternal genomic 5mC 6 h after ICSI as previously
noted4,6,7, but phICSI-13 embryos at the same time after sperm
injection all (n ¼ 12) possessed a higher ratio, reflecting lower
relative maternal 5mC levels (Fig. 7g,h; for parental ratios in ICSI
versus phICSI, P ¼ 2.22e � 05). These findings argue that early
embryonic 5mC and 5hmC regulation is coupled and that some
embryos are tolerant of phICSI-associated dysregulation of the
signature DNA modification dynamics of fertilization that
precede normal development.

 The early transcriptome in phICSI is abnormal. To evaluate
whether altered epigenetic regulation in phICSI affected gene
expression33, we performed comparative microarray analyses of
phICSI-13 2-cell biparental blastomeres and ICSI controls
(Supplementary Table 1) in which major embryonic gene
activation has normally occurred34,35.
Consistent with our previous findings36, sibling cells from ICSI
2-cell embryos exhibited very similar gene expression profiles:
only 4 out of the 128 possible combinations respecting the
experimental 2-cell pairing exhibited a single gene with a false
discovery rate- (FDR-) adjusted P-value o0.05 and only one
combination resulted in a maximum of two significant genes.
Unadjusted P-values were consistently uniformly distributed
(Fig. 8a). By contrast, gene expression between phICSI-13
and ICSI 2-cell blastomeres was clearly distinct (Fig. 8b).
Transcriptome
differences
(FDR-adjusted
Po0.05)
between
ICSI and phICSI-13 blastomeres were evident for 73 genes
(Fig. 8b,c). Gene Ontology (GO) annotation retrieved from the
DAVID database showed that gene expression differed between
phICSI and ICSI regarding ion homeostasis, cell proliferation and
development (Fig. 8d). None of these associations were significant
as judged by Fisher’s Exact Test on the 5% level (lowest, P ¼ 0.206
for cation homeostasis). Analogous pathway analysis using
DAVID gave significant enrichment for N-glycan biosynthesis,
monosaccharide
metabolism,
toll-like
receptor
pathways
(all apparently up-regulated in phICSI-13) and IL-3 signalling
pathways (apparently down-regulated in phICSI-13; lowest
P ¼ 0.108, for IL-3). Notwithstanding transcriptomic disparities
between control and phICSI-13 two-cell embryos, 61.6% of
phICSI-13-1bla
embryos
reached
the
morula
stage
before
developmental failure (Supplementary Table 1), prompting us
to examine the regulation of pluripotency factor genes around the
time of morula arrest. Transcript levels were reduced for Oct4
(B40%, P ¼ 0.0469) and Cdx2 (B50%, P ¼ 0.0034) at the morula
stage (Fig. 8e). This coincides with lower transgenic Oct4
promoter-driven mCherry expression (Supplementary Fig. 4e),
although the balance of Oct4/Cdx2 protein expression had
normalized with respect to controls in phICSI-13 embryos
reaching the blastocyst stage (48 h later)(Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Thus, dysregulation of pluripotency factor expression may
contribute to developmental arrest in phICSI embryos during
preimplantation lineage specification.
Discussion
These studies demonstrate that mitotic embryos are able to
remodel sperm chromatin completely, leading to the direct
production of healthy animals. Full sperm reprogramming is
therefore not unique to oocytes, showing that sperm chromatin
reprogramming machinery is present at different development
stages and in other cell types. phICSI has the potential to
reveal not only stage-dependent features such as high zygotic
5hmC production, but key features of reprogramming during
the gamete-to-embryo transition in natural fertilization. All
randomly-sampled
phICSI
embryos
exhibited
anomalous
reprogramming, but since full-term development in phICSI-13-
1bla occurred at 24% of ICSI control rates (10.4% versus 43.4%,
Supplementary Table 1), development was not the result of a
subgroup that evaded epigenetic analyses. We challenged this
assertion by generating binomial distributions of probabilities
that phICSI embryos with two normal modifications gave rise to
different numbers of offspring (Supplementary Fig. 13). The
production of 9 or more phICSI embryos with modifications
characteristic of ICSI out of a total of 24 that developed to
term can be excluded on the 5%-significance level, since
P(9 | 20, r)r0.0465 (worst case) for all r (Supplementary
Fig. 13). The probability that not a single embryo is phICSI
modification derived is only P(24 | 20, r)r9.84e � 17. Although
this analysis assumed only two epigenetic differences, we detected
five modifications that consistently differed between stage-
matched ICSI and phICSI-13 embryos. These data strongly
suggest that different chromatin remodelling dynamics support
the emergence of totipotency following phICSI.
Given that sperm reprogramming naturally accompanies exit
from the second meiotic metaphase, it is reasonable to suppose
that our success in phICSI-13 was partly because recipient
parthenogenotes were at, or soon entered, metaphase of the first
mitotic M-phase after sperm injection22. This is consistent with
the lower rates of term development we observed in phICSI-7 and
-10, where sperm were injected during the meiotic-to-mitotic
transition
well
before
M-phase
(Supplementary
Table
1).
This constitutes evidence that a cell cycle window for sperm
reprogramming closes after fertilization and reopens during entry
into the first mitotic M-phase.

 An additional possibility is that sperm reprogramming factors
accumulate
in
pronuclei
during
interphase37.
Pronuclear
sequestration of remodelling factors is also thought to occur in
somatic cell nuclear transfer, but the mitotic cytoplasm later
regains
remodelling
activity15,38.
Injected
sperm
heads
in
phICSI-7 and -10 exhibited limited nucleoprotein exchange
until pn membrane breakdown (Supplementary Fig. 2) and poor
subsequent
development
may
have
been
due
to
paternal
chromatin damage before M-phase (Supplementary Table 1).
When we employed pn transfer experiments to ask whether
embryonic stage skipping exerted an effect on development, pups
were produced only in pre-S-phase transfer experiments (the
pnT-G1 group) but they did not survive fostering (Fig. 4a–c;
Supplementary Table 1). We cannot exclude technical effects such
as genomic DNA damage and cell cycle discordance between
donor pn and recipient blastomeres, but it is also possible that key
reprogramming events of the first mitotic cell cycle were omitted
in both pnT-G1 and pnT-G2 and that these events are part of the
physiological mechanism of the gamete-to-embryo transition
following natural fertilization.
From the unique properties of sperm chromatin3 it might be
inferred that remodelling activity in oocytes is unique, but in
phICSI, remodelling is performed by mitotic embryos. This
implies that nucleoplasmin-like activity responsible for removing
protamines is also mitotic5. Mouse putative nucleoplasmins
Npm1, Npm2 and Npm3 are expressed in oocytes; after
fertilization, Npm2 is present in both parental pronuclei and
remains in the nuclei of early cleavage embryos39. Pronuclear
sequestration, embryonic persistence and evidence that Npm2
possesses somatic cell reprogramming activity40 collectively
suggest that one or more nucleoplasmins mediate chromatin
remodelling in phICSI.
In fertilization, sperm decondensation is followed by maternal
histone deposition3. Deposition of the oocyte core histone
variant, H3.3 requires the chaperone, Hira41 and since Hira is
present in mitosis27 it may operate in mitotic sperm chromatin
remodelling. Chromatin remodelling in fertilization and mitotic
cells may share other features including rapid and dynamic
regulation of nuclear proteins, H3 family dynamics and the
contribution of factors enriched in mII oocytes41–44. The success
of phROSI shows that mitotic parthenogenotes can directly
reprogram non-protaminic chromatin from differentiated cells;
the method might also be combined with products of paternal
meiosis generated in vitro45.
High developmental rates in phICSI are remarkable given that
the injected sperm bypasses all events as they occur during
the first 13 h of natural fertilization (Supplementary Fig. 1a),
including calcium mobilization, cytokinesis, disassembly of
membrane, mitochondria and perinuclear structures, chromatin
decondensation, reassembly and modification leading to pn

 formation, S-phase and preparation for the first embryonic
transcription2,5. However, an essential reprogramming role for
calcium mobilization is unlikely; it is dispensable for full
development and is probably more important for sustained
Emi2 degradation1,46. Fertilizing sperm desconstruction inside
the oocyte is mediated by the proteasome, which is ubiquitously
expressed and present in early mammalian embryos47,48. This is
consistent with evident dismantling of sperm in phICSI-13,
although we did not examine sperm dismantling in detail in
phICSI-7 and -10; the prediction is that although sperm
chromatin remained condensed in phICSI-7 and -10 (Fig. 5a),
some components disperse. The oocyte microvillar projections
thought to remove the sperm perinuclear matrix following
fertilization are rich in microfilaments49. Since microfilaments
persist well into the late 1-cell stage50, analogous interactions
could remove the perinuclear matrix in successful phICSI.

 Chromatin remodelling following fertilization involves pro-
nounced changes in 5hmC levels8 which were markedly different
in phICSI (Fig. 7a,b). Hydroxymethylation of paternal chromatin
or of 5mC DNA-beads (5mC-beads) injected around the first
M-phase was low compared to ICSI controls (Fig. 7b). Under the
conditions of the DNA-beads assay, the appearance of 5hmC
required pre-existing 5mC. Given that rates of phICSI-13 term
development (Supplementary Table 1) were similar to those of
functionally Tet3 null embryos7, it is possible that 5hmC
dysregulation
accounts
for
some
developmental
failure
in
phICSI but it is unlikely to account for all of it. First, if 5hmC
anomalies alone accounted for impaired phICSI development,
other aspects of reprogramming in phICSI would either be the
same as those of ICSI, which they are not, or the 5hmC
differences in phICSI would have to have been indirectly
responsible for all of the epigenetic differences we observed.
Secondly, lack of functional maternal Tet3 does not affect rates of
preimplantation development7, but preimplantation development
in phICSI-13 was poor (Supplementary Table 1). Thirdly, during
manuscript preparation, it was reported that haploinsufficiency is
the major reason for the perinatal abnormality in Tet3 mutant
mice,
with
no
fundamental
developmental
function
of
Tet3-mediated 5hmC production in male pronuclei51. Fourthly,
5mC-dependent DNA hydroxymethylation is evident in ph-7
parthenogenotes (Fig. 7e; Supplementary Fig. 12b,c), suggesting
that phICSI and embryos lacking functional Tet3 are not
equivalent. Finally, zygotic Dppa3/Pgc7/Stella binds H3K9me2
to prevent Tet3-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5hmC, at least in
imprinted genes27, but in phICSI, the dynamics of 5hmC and
H3K9me2 were disrupted.
The ability of mitotic embryos to reprogram sperm in phICSI
blurs functional distinctions between somatic, embryonic and
gametic cell lineages. This finding could benefit mammalian
embryology when parthenogenotes are available but oocytes are
not52 and it is perhaps poignant that we generated phICSI
offspring with both chemically (Sr2 þ-) and spontaneously (Plcx-)
activated
parthenogenotes.
Moreover,
our
work
calls
into
question the argument that parthenogenotes do not have the
potential for full-term development and are accordingly a more
acceptable source of human ES cells53,54. The implication that the
totipotent state may be arrived at via different epigenetic kinetics
or pathways hints that for other cell types different routes might
also exist to a given new cellular potency destination.
Methods
Collection and culture of oocytes. Animal procedures complied with the Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. Wild-type mouse (Mus musculus) strains were
bred from C57BL/6 or DBA/2 stocks in-house or otherwise supplied by Charles
River (L’Arbresle, France). Mixed C57BL/6 and B6D2F1 background hybrid lines
containing the transgenes pOct4-mCherry, pPrm2-Prm2-mCherry, pCAG-Plcz-ires-
Venus20, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo(mT/mG)22, pPGK-Cre or
pNanog-eGFP55 were generated in-house or were kind gifts. Oocytes were collected
from 8- to 12-week-old females that had been super-ovulated by standard serial
intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG)
followed 48 h later by 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)56. Oviductal
metaphase II (mII) oocytes were collected in M2 medium (EMD Millipore, UK)57
B15 h post-hCG injection and cumulus cells dispersed by hyaluronidase
treatment56. After repeated washing in M2, denuded oocytes were incubated in
kalium simplex optimized medium (KSOM; Millipore)58 under mineral oil in
humidified 5% CO2 (v/v air) at 37 �C, until required. Where appropriate (for
example, for diagnosis of fertilization by second polar body extrusion), mII oocytes
with a degenerate first polar body were selected; by 16 h post-hCG, 71.0±2.0%
(n ¼ 2,294) of first polar bodies had degenerated. Activation of B6D2F1 or mT/mG
oocytes to produce parthenogenetic haploid embryos was in Ca2 þ-free CZB
medium supplemented with 10 mM SrCl2, for 2.5 h in humidified 5% CO2 (v/v air)
at 37 �C (refs 59,60). SrCl2 treatment was initiated 16–17.5 h post-hCG; times are
given after the start of SrCl2 treatment. For phICSI and controls, embryos were
chosen that possessed a second polar body and a single pn at 5–7 h. For phICSI,
SrCl2-activated haploid parthenogenotes were injected with sperm at the times
indicated after commencement of SrCl2 treatment. Spontaneously arising
parthenogenotes containing a single pn were selected from pCAG-Plcz-ires-Venus
females20 following brief culture in vitro. For maternal genome labelling with
5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU), haploid B6D2F1 parthenogenotes were cultured
in KSOM containing 5 mM BrdU (Sigma) for 5 h, starting 4 h after SrCl2 treatment
was initiated. S-phase was determined by culturing 2-cell ph embryos for 1 h at the
appropriate times in KSOM containing 100 mM BrdU.
Sperm preparation and microinjection. For sperm preparation, cauda epididy-
midal sperm from 8- to 12-week-old males were triturated for 45 s in nuclear
isolation medium (NIM; 125 mM KCl, 2.6 mM NaCl, 7.8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM
KH2PO4, 3.0 mM EDTA; pH-7.0) containing 1.0% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)
dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) at room temperature
(25 �C)56,58,59. Sperm were washed twice in NIM and pelleted (1,890 g) at ambient
temperature; head-tail detachment was enhanced by trituration during pellet
resuspension. Finally, sperm were resuspended in ice-cold NIM (B0.5 ml per
epididymis) and stored at 4 �C for up to 3 h until required. B50 ml of each
suspension was typically mixed with 20 ml of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, average
MrE360 000; Sigma-Aldrich) solution (15% (w/v)) and sperm injected (ICSI) into
oocytes in droplet of M2 within B60 min, essentially as described56. Injected
oocytes were transferred to KSOM under mineral oil equilibrated in humidified 5%
CO2 (v/v air) at 37 �C. For phICSI, SrCl2-activated haploid parthenogenotes were
injected with sperm at the times indicated after commencement of SrCl2 treatment.
For phICSI-13, this was 13 h after the initiation of SrCl2 treatment of B6D2F1
oocytes, just after pnMBD. Where parthenogenotes were from pCAG-Plcz-ires-
Venus, sperm were injected soon after pnMBD. In some experiments
(Supplementary Fig. 9d,e), zygotes produced by mating were injected with a
sperm immediately after pnMBD, referred to as zygotic ICSI, zICSI.
Ablation of single 2-cell embryo blastomeres. One of the two blastomeres in
2-cell embryos was destroyed by suction of nuclear material into a piezo-actuated
pipette (inner diameter, 7–8 mm). In the case of phICSI-13, embryos of the 2 þ 1
nuclear type (Fig. 1b) were selected and the blastomere with a single (maternal)
nucleus was destroyed.
Pronuclear transfer and cytoplast transfer. For paternal pn and zygotic
cytoplast transfer60,61, the zona pellucida of donor and recipient embryos was cut
in M2 medium with a fine microneedle. Donor zygotes produced by ICSI (B6D2F1
oocytes and B6D2F1 or mtdT sperm) were held for 10–15 min in KSOM
containing cytochalasin B (5 mg ml � 1) and nocodazole (1 mg ml � 1) just before
manipulation in M2 medium similarly supplemented with cytochalasin B
(5 mg ml � 1) and nocodazole (1 mg ml � 1). Part of the zygote containing the male
pn was aspirated into a micropipette (outer diameter, 15 mm) and introduced with
inactivated sendai virus (HVJ) envelope (GenomeONE-CF, Ishikawa Sangyo
Kaisya, Japan) diluted 10x from a stock solution, into the space between the
blastomere and zona pellucida of a 2-cell parthenogenetic haploid BDF1 embryo.
Male pronuclear transfer into male pn-enucleated zygotes and zygotic cytoplast
transfer into 2-cell blastomeres of biparental ICSI embryos were performed as
controls.
ROSI and phROSI. ROSI was performed by injecting B6D2F1 mII oocytes with
round spermatid nuclei (from 8 to 10-week-old B6D2F1 or mtdT) in M2 medium,
followed by activation with 10 mM SrCl2 in calcium-free CZB-G medium for
2.5 h (ref. 13). phROSI was performed by applying the ROSI procedure to
parthenogenetic haploid embryos entering the first mitosis as nucleus recipients.
Generation of recombinant fusion constructs. Recombinant constructs were
used for the expression of cRNA and/or transgenes encoding fusion proteins.
To generate the backbone vector, pCI-neo-mKO2-FLAG, an mKO2 SmaI/EcoRV
fragment was generated by PCR from the Kusabira Orange-encoding plasmid,
pmKO2-SI (Medical & Biological Laboratories, UK) and cloned into the
mammalian expression vector, pCI-neo (Promega, UK). Into this construct,
we inserted an EcoRV/NotI fragment derived from p3XFLAG-CMV-14
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK) to generate an mKO2-FLAG3 fusion. H3.3 was cloned into
pCI-Neo-mKO2-FLAG as an XbaI/SalGI fragment from cDNA generated by mII
oocyte RT-PCR. The Prm2 gene was cloned following PCR amplification of tail tip
genomic DNA as an XhoI/EcoRI fragment that includes B1 kb upstream of
the Prm2 start codon, and inserted into pCI-neo-mCherry1. Expression of
mVenus-hGeminin and mCherry-hCdt1 (the kind gifts of the RIKEN Brain
Science Institute, Wako, Japan) was after they had been cloned as PCR-amplified
EcoRI/XbaI fragments into pCI-neo. To generate the transgene construct in which
the Oct4A promoter drives mCherry expression, a fragment including the Oct4A
start codon and B5 kb of upstream promoter sequences62 was generated by
PCR and cloned with an mCherry reporter fragment into the NotI site of vector
pGEM-T (Promega).
Embryo transfer. E1.5 (2-cell) embryos (the day following activation) were
transferred to the oviductal ampullae of pseudo-pregnant CD-1 females at day 0.5

 (that is, plugged females that had been mated with vasectomized males the previous
night). Pups were delivered by natural birth and where appropriate, fetuses, pups
and placentae collected by Caesarian section at the desired time point. Pups and
placentas collected by caesarian section at term (E19.5) were weighed immediately.
Newborn pups were fostered by CD-1 females.
Genotyping. Mouse tissue samples were digested at 55 �C for 3 h in 25–100 ml of a
lysis buffer containing 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and with 2 mg ml � 1
proteinase K (Sigma). 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of each sample was used for
genotyping by PCR in a 10 ml reaction volume. PCR primer sequences are given in
Supplementary Table 2. Primers for microsatellite analysis were selected from the
Mouse Microsatellite Data Base of Japan63.
Preparation and injection of cRNA. 5’-capped and polyadenylated cRNA was
synthesized from linearized plasmid template DNA in a T7 mScript Standard
mRNA Production System (Cellscript, USA) according to the recommendations of
the manufacturer46,64. cRNAs were dissolved in nuclease-free water, quantified on
a Nanophotometer and stored in aliquots at � 80 �C until required. cRNA
solutions were diluted as appropriate with sterile water and injected (typically at
concentrations of 0.01 to 1 mg ml � 1) within 1 h of thawing via a piezo-actuated
micropipette into mII oocytes or embryos in M2 medium. Following cRNA
injection, oocytes or embryos were cultured for at least 3 h prior to subsequent
manipulation.
Immunocytochemistry. 50-Methylcytosine (5mC), hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) and BrdU were detected in embryonic DNA following fixation in 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde and treatment with 2 M HCl for 30 min. Fixed embryos were
processed as soon as possible but were stored where necessary at 4 �C. For
primary antibody labelling, samples were incubated overnight at 4 �C with
mouse anti-5mC antibody (1:200 (v/v); EMD Millipore, UK), for 1.5 h at 37 �C
with rabbit anti-5hmC antibody (1:200; Active Motif, USA) or for 1.5 h with rat
anti-BrdU antibody (1:100; Abcam, UK). Additional primary antibodies recognized
Oct4 (1:100; Santa Cruz, USA), Cdx2 (1:100; BioGenex Laboratories, USA),
H3K4me3 (1:250; Abcam, UK), H3K9me2 (1:50; Abcam), H3K27me3 (1:50;
Abcam) and H4K12ac (1:250; Abcam). Primary antibody incubation was followed
by a 1 h incubation at 37 �C with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:250; Life
Technologies, UK) conjugated to Alexa 350, Alexa 488 and/or Alexa 594. DNA was
stained by incubating samples at 37 �C for 20 min in propidium iodide (1:200;
Sigma, USA) or Hoechst 33342 (1:1,000; Sigma).
Fluorescence imaging. Images of live oocytes or embryos following cRNA
injection were captured on an Olympus IX71 stand equipped with an Andro Zyla
sCMOS camera and OptoLED illumination system (Cairn Research, UK) and
processed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, LLC, USA). Excitation at
587 nm in combination with an ET-mCherry filter system was used for mCherry
fluorescence detection and at 484 nm with an ET-EYFP filter system to detect
Venus epifluorescence. Fluorescence of fixed samples was visualized on an Eclipse
E600 (Nikon, Japan) microscope equipped with a Radiance 2100 laser scanning
confocal system (BioRad, USA)46. Images were processed with ImageJ
(imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, USA) analysis software.
Quantitative analyses subtracted background from subject area fluorescence
intensities, which can produce negative results in beads experiments in which
background levels from latex are lower than those of oocytes. Mouse fetus
fluorescence stereomicrographs (Supplementary Fig. 6c) were captured by a Leica
MZ16 FA fluorescence stereomicroscope, with LAS AF 4.0 imaging software
(Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany).
Nuclear volume estimation. Nuclear volumes were estimated in zygotes and 2 þ 1
type phICSI-13 2-cell embryos respectively 9 h post-ICSI or 30 h after initial SrCl2
exposure. These times correspond to approximately the same period after the
paternal genome has completed its first S-phase respectively in ICSI and phICSI.
Maternal nuclei were distinguished by comparatively low zygotic 5hmC or by BrdU
labelling in phICSI. Propidium iodide staining was determined in z-stacked
confocal images using ImageJ.
Blastocyst cell counting. Blastocyst cell counting46 was performed by fixing
blastocysts in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and incubating them at 4 �C overnight in
rabbit anti-Oct4 antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz) or for 1 h at 37 �C in mouse
anti-Cdx2 antibody (1:100; BioGenex, USA), followed by 1 h at 37 �C in Alexa
488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) or Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG (Invitrogen) respectively. Cells stained with Alexa 488 were scored as
Oct4-positive (pluriblasts) and those with Alexa 594, as Cdx2-positive
(trophoblasts).
DNA-conjugated latex microbeads. We adapted a method using streptavidin
latex microbeads (Dynabeads; Invitrogen, MA, USA) conjugated to biotinylated
DNA, so that we could perform high-resolution physiological analysis of chromatin
and spindle function in living oocytes and embryos, as previously performed for
spindles30,31, chromatin29–31 and mouse oocytes32. DNA fragments (2,605 bp)
were amplified using LA Taq DNA polymerase (TAKARA BIO, Japan) from
plasmid pCI-Neo (Promega Corp., WI, USA) using the primer pair (5’-3’): sense,
CTGGCGTAATAGCGAAGAGG; antisense, ATAATACCGCGCCACATAGC.
The sense primer was pre-labelled with biotin at its 5’ end (Invitrogen). Following
agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments were gel-purified using Wizard SV Gel
and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega Corp., WI, USA). For methyl-DNA bead
conjugation (Fig. 7c–e), a portion of the DNA amplimer was methylated using the
CpG methyltransferase, M.SssI (New England BioLabs, MA, USA) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Methylation reaction products were
purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) and the
reaction efficiency was assessed by gel electrophoresis following challenge with the
methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, HpaII (New England BioLabs).
Streptavidin-coupled beads (2.8 mm diameter) were decorated with DNA using
Dynabeads kilobaseBINDER Kit (Life Technologies, USA) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, magnetic latex microbeads from
4 ml of suspension were mixed on a rotator for 3 h at room temperature (25 �C)
with 3 mg of biotinylated DNA fragment in binding buffer in 40 ml of binding
reaction. The beads were harvested magnetically, washed, resuspended in nuclease-
free water and stored in aliquots at -20 �C until required. Immediately prior to
injection, beads were mixed with 3% (w/v) PVP (average Mr, 360,000) in M2
medium. Microinjection was performed as for ICSI56, coinjecting 5–7 beads per
oocyte or embryo instead of sperm heads.
To validate the method in our system, we injected DNA-beads into mII oocytes
and evaluated microtubule formation and histone accumulation by DNA staining
and immunofluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c). In all
experiments, we showed that DNA-beads injected into mII oocytes were stained
with Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide, in a DNA-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. 12a). Beads in mII oocytes stained with an antibody against
acetylated H4K12ac in a DNA-dependent manner that was independent of
DNA methylation (nZ10; Supplementary Fig. 12b). As previously reported32,
DNA-beads induced microtubule nucleation regardless of 5mC status (nZ11),
whereas beads lacking DNA failed to do so (n ¼ 11) (Supplementary Fig. 12c). The
kinetics of cRNA-encoded histone H3.3 deposition were similar for DNA-beads
and ICSI controls (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Statistical analysis. Experiments were performed on Z2 days. The number of
samples (n) per experiment reflects power calculation and oocyte and embryo
survival after manipulation. All samples were randomly collected; that is, we did
not knowingly select different classes of healthy oocytes or embryos except where
stated, and no data are selectively excluded. Data analysis was performed with or
without blinding. Statistical differences between pairs of data sets were analysed by
a two-tailed unpaired t-test. One-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey–Kramer
post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons. The log-rank test was used to
compare mouse longevity plots created by the Kaplan–Meier method. Values of
Po0.05 were considered statistically significant. For model-assessment of possible
ICSI-phenotype contribution to developed embryos, we assumed that two
embryonic phenotypes I and II were characterized by respectively an elevation or
diminution of certain modifications (for example, 5mC and 5hmC). The estimated
probability for development to term is qI ¼ 0.103 for phenotype-I (according to
24/232 for phICSI-derived embryos) and qII ¼ 0.451 for phenotype-II (according
to 107/237 for ICSI-derived embryos) (Supplementary Table 1). A nominal
phenotype-I population may contain an unknown phenotype-II fraction, r.
Subsequently, the model combines (1) the probability for observing phenotype-I
associated histone states in k out of k experiments in the mixed population, and
(2) the cumulative probability for the event that at least n ¼ 1,2,... out of N ¼ 232
individuals developing to term derive from phenotype-II.
Ad (1) The probability of observing k histone-unmodified cases (phenotype-I)
in k experiments is binomial p(k|k, 1-r) distributed.
Ad (2) The probability of observing m phenotype-II and (N—m) phenotype-I
cases in N experiments is binomial p(m|N, r). The probability that respectively n
and (N—n) cases develop to term is the product of binomial p(n|m, qII) and
p(N—n|N—m, qI). Marginalization with respect to m

 embryos out of a total of 24 can be excluded on the 5% significance level, that is,
P(9)r0.0465, while the probability that all embryos derive from phenotype-II is
P(24)r9.84e � 17. For k ¼ 9 (5mC), the same is true for 14 or more embryos, that
is, P(14)r0.0493, and for all embryos P(24)r1.05e � 16. Regarding both
evidences for k ¼ 9 and k ¼ 20 as independent and multiplying both binomials
results in significance starting from n ¼ 7, that is, P(7)r0.0465, and
P(24)r9.32e � 17. The simplifying assumption of only two phenotypes limits the
model applicability to either only one phenotype-determining modification or
(equivalently) multiple but 100%-correlated modifications. Allowing for two
independent modifications A and B, would require a more involved four-
phenotype-model. However, our data suggest high correlation of A and B.
Single-cell whole transcriptome amplification. ICSI and phICSI 2-cell embryos
were produced by injecting B6D2F1 sperm respectively into B6D2F1 oocytes or
parthenogenotes. For phICSI-13, blastomeres were separated from 2 þ 1 embryos
(Fig. 1e). In all cases, a random sample of the embryos was cultured to
confirm preimplantation developmental viability (Supplementary Table 1). For
transcriptome amplification, embryos were exposed to acid Tyrode’s solution
(pH2.5; Sigma) to dissolve the zona pellucida and allowed to recover for 1 h in
KSOM in humidified 5% CO2 (v/v air) at 37 �C. Embryos were then gently
triturated in Ca2 þ-free, Mg2 þ-free M2 medium to separate the blastomeres and
the extant polar body if there was one. ICSI blastomeres were collected 27 h
post-ICSI and the binuclear blastomeres of phICSI 2 þ 1 embryos 27 h after the
initiation of SrCl2 exposure. One blastomere per tube was collected in a minimal
volume into 5.4 ml of lysis buffer (Active Motif) containing 10 ng of tRNA (Roche),
1 mg of protease (Active Motif), and 1 ml of 37.5 mM biotinylated oligo-dT peptide
nucleic acids (PNAs; Active Motif) and flash-frozen in liquid N2 until extraction,
reverse transcription and global amplification of blastomere mRNA36,65.
Proteolytic digestion was performed by incubating samples for 10 min at 45 �C,
followed by inactivation of protease at 75 �C for 1 min, and annealing of PNA to
poly(A) tails of mRNAs, at 22 �C for 15 min. PNA-mRNA complexes were
precipitated in magnetic force field using streptavidin-conjugated metal beads.
While precipitating, bead pellets were washed with 10 ml of wash buffer 1 (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.25% [v/v] Igepal), 20 ml of wash buffer 2
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 75 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.5% [v/v] Tween-20), and again with
20 ml of wash buffer 1 (supernatant was removed after each washing step). Solid
phase reverse transcription was performed for 45 min under rotation at 44 �C, in a
20 ml reaction containing 0.5 mM of each dNTP (GE Healthcare), 200 U of
SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.25% (v/v) Igepal, 5 mM DTT,
30 mM of C15GTCTAGAN8 primer, 15 mM of C15GTCTAGACTTGAGT24VN
primer (Metabion), and 1 � first strand buffer (Invitrogen). Primers were annealed
at room temperature for 10 min, before addition of the enzyme. Following reverse
transcription, beads were precipitated in magnetic racks and washed in 20 ml of
wash buffer 3 (50 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM DTT, 0.25% (v/v) Igepal) and resuspended
in 10 ml of buffer for tailing (4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM dGTP, 10 mM
KH2PO4). Reaction mixtures were overlaid with 40 ml of mineral oil, and the cDNA
single strands released from beads by heating to 95 �C for 5 min followed by
incubation on ice for 3 min. Addition of dGTPs on 50 termini of single stranded
cDNAs was performed by adding 10 U of terminal dNTP transferase (TdT;
USB-Affymetrix) and incubating the mixture for 60 min at 37 �C. After inactivation
of TdT at 70 �C for 5 min, we added 35 ml of whole transcriptome amplification
(WTA) reaction mix 1 (4 ml of buffer I (Expand Long Template, Roche) and 3%
(v/v) deionized formamide). Hotstart PCR was performed by incubating the
sample at 78 �C and adding 5.5 ml of WTA reaction mix 2 (3.2 mM each dNTP,
12 mM TCAGAATTCATGC15 primer, and 7.5 U of PolMix (Expand Long
Template, Roche)). WTA consisted of 40 cycles in an MJ Research PCR cycler:
20 cycles of 15 s at 94 �C, 30 s at 65 �C, and 2 min at 68 �C followed by 20 cycles
with an increase of elongation step of 10 s per cycle, followed by a final cycle with
7 min of elongation.
For quality control36,65, 0.5 ml of each WTA product was used as a template for
end-point PCR to amplify each of the three transcripts: b2-microglobulin, b-actin
and GAPDH. The primers used were: b-actin forward, CAGCTTCTTTGCAGC
TCCTT); b-actin reverse, CTCGTCACCCACATAGGAGTC; b2-microglobulin
forward, TGGTGCTTGTCTCACTGACC; b2-microglobulin reverse, CCGTTCT
TCAGCATTTGGAT; GAPDH forward, GAAGGGCATCTTGGGCTAC; GAPDH
reverse, GCCTCTCTTGCTCAGTGTCC. PCR reactions consisted of 1 � PCR
buffer (PAN-Biotech GmbH, Germany), 0.4 mM each primer (Eurofins), 5 mg BSA
(Roche), 0.5 U Taq polymerase (PAN-Biotech), and 0.1 mM each dNTP
(GE Healthcare). PCR products were visualized on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were positive for all three transcripts
were used for microarray analysis36,65.
Sample labelling and microarray hybridization. Labelling of primary whole
transcriptome amplified (WTA) product was by PCR with Cy5-labelled primers.
Reaction mix contained 5 ml of buffer I (Expand Long Template, Roche), 3% (v/v)
deionized formamide, 0.35 mM each dNTP, 2.5 mM 5’-U*CAGAAU*TCAU*CCC*
CCCC*CCCC*CCCC*-3’ primer (*denotes nucleotides conjugated with Cy5
fluorophore; Metabion), 7.5 U of PolMix (Expand Long Template, Roche) and 1 ml
of primary WTA product in a final volume of 49 ml. PCR parameters were: one
cycle with 1 min at 95 �C, 11 cycles with 15 s at 95 �C, 1 min at 60 �C, and 3 min
30 s at 65 �C, 3 cycles where the elongation time was increased 10 s per cycle, and
finally one cycle with an elongation time of 7 min. Labelled products were purified
using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the vendor.
Purified Cy5-labelled DNA was denatured by incubation for 5 min at 95 �C
followed by incubation on ice. Hybridization solution was prepared by mixing 42 ml
of denatured Cy5-labelled DNA, 55 ml of 2x HiRPM hybridization buffer (Agilent),
11 ml of 10 � GE Blocking agent (Agilent), 4 ml of 25% (v/v) Tween-20, and 4 ml of
25% (v/v) Igepal. Four 100 ml samples of hybridization mix were overlaid on 4
hybridization fields of Agilent Whole Mouse Genome (4x44K) Oligo Microarray
with SurePrint (G4122F) microarray slides and incubated for 17 h at 65 �C under
constant rotation. After hybridization, slides were washed in Agilent Wash buffer 1
for 1 min on a shaker, in darkness, and incubation continued in Agilent Wash
buffer 2 pre-warmed to 37 �C. Slides were dried by washing for 30 s in acetonitrile
and scanned on a GenePix 4400 A scanner (Molecular Devices). Numerical
readouts of fluorescence intensities (GPR files) were generated using GenePixPro 7
(Molecular Devices).
Bioinformatics. The quality of whole transcriptome amplification was assessed by
control PCR. Gene expression data were quality assessed by inspection of chip raw
images and gene expression frequency distributions. All experiments were of
sufficiently high quality for further bioinformatic analysis (16 and 8 expression
profiles for ICSI and phICSI, respectively). Raw gene expression data were
background corrected (limma R-package, normexp method)66,67, log2-transformed
and normalized by quantile normalization. Technically replicated probes (identical
Agilent IDs) were replaced by their median per sample. Gene ranking was
performed according to moderated t-statistics (limma R-package). For graphical
display and functional annotation probes targeting the same gene were
disambiguated by retaining only the probe with the lowest P-value. The normalized
heatmap (Fig. 8c) employed Euclidean distance and complete linkage for
agglomerative clustering. Enrichment for biological process annotation associated
with genes most differentially expressed between ICSI and phICSI was obtained by
querying the DAVID database68 for GO BP/5, GO BP/FAT and KEGG, Reactome,
BBID, BioCarta, and Panther pathway annotation using the R-package
RDAVIDWebService69 for submitting stepwise prolonged gene-lists starting from
the top 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and so on. top-ranking genes up to a length of 550
corresponding to an FDR-adjusted P-value of 0.15. If identical annotation terms
were returned for different lists only the one with the lowest EASE P-value was
retained. For assessing randomness of gene ranking in the ICSI_1 versus ICSI_2
comparison, all 6,435 possible 8 þ 8 array combinations were enumerated and
P-values calculated (limma R-package). The resulting curves were kernel smoothed
in two-dimensional and graphically displayed as density. From the 128 possible
combinations respecting the experimental 2-cell pairing, the one with the highest
number of FDR-adjusted P-values o0.05 (corresponding to the largest difference
between ICSI_1 and ICSI_2) was selected for graphical display. In the ICSI versus
phICSI comparison, 10,000 of the 735,471 possible 16 þ 8 array combinations were
analogously calculated to obtain the corresponding graphical display. Array data
are deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number
GSE60595.
Ratiometric PCR (qPCR). Relative transcript levels were quantified by transferring
single embryos (1 per tube) in a minimal volume (o0.5 ml) of 0.1% (w/v) Sarkosyl
(Teknova, Hollister, CA, USA) containing 10 ng ml � 1 tRNA (Hoffmann-La Roche,
Ch), heated at 65 �C for 5 min and used to programme cDNA synthesis primed
with oligo(dT)20 and random 8-mers (each at 30 mM) in a 21 ml reaction volume
containing 200 U SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp., CA,
USA). Real-time qPCR was in an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, CA) in reactions (20 ml total) containing 1–2 ml of the template cDNA,
forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 2; each at 5 nM) and 12.5 ml of
Power SYBR (ABI), using the parameters: 10 min at 95 �C, followed by 45 cycles of
(15 s at 95 �C, 1 min at 58–60 �C and 35 s at 72 �C). Each sample was assayed in
triplicate and given sample sets collected on at least two days. Primer sets were
non-dimerizing under the conditions employed and steady state levels of
transcripts were normalized against internal controls36.
