Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with low-grade inflammation and specific 
34 
changes in gut microbiota composition1-7. We previously demonstrated that administration 
35 
of Akkermansia muciniphila prevents the development of obesity and associated 
36 
complications8. However, its mechanisms of action remain unclear, whilst the sensitivity of 
37 
A. muciniphila to oxygen and the presence of animal-derived compounds in its growth 
38 
medium currently limit the development of translational approaches for human medicine9. 
39 
Here we addressed these issues by showing that A. muciniphila retains its efficacy when 
40 
grown on a synthetic medium compatible with human administration. Unexpectedly, we 
41 
discovered that pasteurization of A. muciniphila enhanced its capacity to reduce fat mass 
42 
development, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in mice. These improvements were 
43 
notably associated with a modulation of the host urinary metabolomics profile and 
44 
intestinal energy absorption. We demonstrated that Amuc_1100, a specific protein isolated 
45 
from the outer membrane of A. muciniphila, interacts with Toll-Like Receptor 2, is stable at 
46 
temperatures used for pasteurization, improves the gut barrier and partly recapitulates the 
47 
beneficial effects of the bacterium. Finally, we showed that administration of live or 
48 
pasteurized A. muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium is safe in humansThese findings 
49 
provide support for the use of different preparations of A. muciniphila as therapeutic 
50 
options to target human obesity and associated disorders.  
51 
 
52 
Akkermansia muciniphila is one of the most abundant members of the human gut 
53 
microbiota, representing between 1 and 5% of our intestinal microbes10,11. We and others recently 
54 
observed that the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila is decreased during obesity and 
55 
diabetes2,8 and is significantly associated with the improvement of cardiometabolic parameters in 
56 
individuals with obesity undergoing caloric restriction12. Moreover, we found that daily 
57 
administration of live A. muciniphila grown on a mucus-based medium can counteract the 
58 
development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut barrier dysfunction8, an observation 
59 
later confirmed by other groups13,14. However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are 
60 
still unclear. In addition, the current growth requirements of A. muciniphila and its oxygen 
61 
sensitivity9 render this bacterium unsuitable for human investigations and putative therapeutic 
62 
opportunities.  
63 
 3 
 
Therefore, in HFD-fed mice, we compared the effects of daily administration of A. 
64 
muciniphila grown either on a mucus-based medium (HFD Live Akk Mucus) or a synthetic 
65 
medium where mucin was replaced by a combination of glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, soy 
66 
peptone and threonine (HFD Live Akk Synthetic). This medium allowed us to culture A. 
67 
muciniphila with the same efficiency as the mucus-based medium while being exempt of any 
68 
compound incompatible with human administration. We observed that live A. muciniphila 
69 
treatment tended to reduce HFD-induced body weight and fat mass gain (by about 40-50%) and 
70 
to improve glucose intolerance and insulin resistance regardless of the growth medium used and 
71 
independently of food intake (Fig. 1a-g).  
72 
We previously showed that autoclaving A. muciniphila abolished its beneficial effects8. 
73 
However, recent investigations suggest that probiotics inactivated by pasteurization for 30 
74 
minutes at 70°C, a less extreme treatment limiting the denaturation of their cellular components, 
75 
could partly or fully retain their beneficial effects15,16. Hence, we assessed the effects of A. 
76 
muciniphila grown on a synthetic medium and inactivated by pasteurization (HFD Pasteurized 
77 
Akk). Unexpectedly, in two separate sets of experiments, we found that pasteurized A. 
78 
muciniphila exerted stronger effects than the live bacterium, as HFD-fed mice treated with 
79 
pasteurized bacteria showed similar body weight and fat mass gain to mice fed with a control diet 
80 
(ND), independently of food intake (Fig. 1a-c and Supplemental Fig. 1a-c). In both sets of 
81 
experiments, we found that mice treated with pasteurized A. muciniphila displayed a much lower 
82 
glucose intolerance and insulin concentration when compared to the HFD group, resulting in a 
83 
lower insulin resistance (IR) index (Fig. 1d-g and Supplemental Fig. 1d-g). Treatment with 
84 
pasteurized A. muciniphila also led to greater goblet cell density in the ileum when compared to 
85 
ND-fed mice (Fig. 1h), suggesting a higher mucus production, while normalizing the mean 
86 
adipocyte diameter (Fig. 2a-b) and significantly lowering plasma leptin when compared to HFD-
87 
fed mice (Fig. 2c). These effects were not observed in mice treated with live A. muciniphila. A 
88 
similar trend could be observed for plasma resistin (Supplemental Fig. 1h), thereby suggesting 
89 
improved insulin sensitivity, while plasma adiponectin remained unaffected in all conditions 
90 
(Supplemental Fig. 1i). We found that mice treated with pasteurized A. muciniphila had a higher 
91 
fecal caloric content when compared to all other groups (Fig. 2d), suggesting a lower energy 
92 
absorption. This could contribute to the further reduction in body weight and fat mass gain 
93 
observed in this group. Similar effects of A. muciniphila on energy absorption were previously 
94 
 4 
 
reported in mice undergoing cold exposure17. Altogether, these data suggest that pasteurization 
95 
enhances the beneficial effects of A. muciniphila on HFD-induced metabolic syndrome. This 
96 
could be due to increased accessibility of specific bacterial compounds involved in the positive 
97 
effects of A. muciniphila on its host. Conversely, pasteurization of A. muciniphila could prevent 
98 
the production of metabolites or factors mitigating its beneficial effects. 
99 
We next tested whether treatment with A. muciniphila could reduce the HFD-induced shift 
100 
in the host urinary metabolome18 HFD was the main factor influencing 1H NMR-based 
101 
untargeted metabolic profiles on the first O-PLS-DA score (Tpred1) while treatment with 
102 
pasteurized A. muciniphila clustered separately from all other groups regarding the second score 
103 
(Tpred2) (Fig. 2e-g). This resulted in a normalization of the HFD-induced shift of 37% with the 
104 
pasteurized bacterium, and 17% with the live bacterium (Fig. 2f).  
105 
By comparing the metabolic profiles of the different groups, we found that the shift 
106 
induced by pasteurized A. muciniphila was mainly associated with trimethylamine (TMA) and 
107 
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) according to the OPLS-DA model coefficients (Supplemental 
108 
Fig. 2). While HFD feeding severely lowered the abundance of TMA compared to ND-fed mice, 
109 
treatment with pasteurized A. muciniphila significantly offset this reduction (Fig. 2h). A similar 
110 
trend was observed for urinary TMAO (Fig. 2i). This relative increase in TMA abundance was 
111 
not observed in mice treated with live A. muciniphila. Treatment with pasteurized A. muciniphila 
112 
also modulated hepatic expression of Fmo3, encoding the Flavin monooxygenase 3 that converts 
113 
TMA to TMAO, a metabolite associated with atherosclerosis19,20. While exposure to a HFD led 
114 
to a two-fold higher Fmo3 expression when compared to ND-fed mice, treatment with 
115 
pasteurized A. muciniphila reversed this effect (Fig. 2j). Of note, knockdown of Fmo3 by the use 
116 
of specific antisense oligonucleotides can increase serum concentration of TMA20 and protects 
117 
mice against the development of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance21. Moreover, recent 
118 
findings suggest that oral administration of live A. muciniphila can impede atherosclerosis 
119 
development in Apoe-/- mice22. In our study however, the effects observed on urinary TMA and 
120 
Fmo3 expression were not associated with a modification of plasma TMA and TMAO, as all 
121 
HFD-fed group displayed similar concentrations for both metabolites (Fig. 2k,l). This suggests 
122 
that the observed decrease in Fmo3 expression is not sufficient to inhibit the conversion of TMA 
123 
in TMAO, and that metabolic effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila are not related to these 
124 
metabolites.  
125 
 5 
 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate bacterial recognition, intestinal homeostasis and can 
126 
also shape the host metabolism23-25. To identify how A. muciniphila interacts with its host, we 
127 
performed in vitro experiments to evaluate its TLR signaling potential. Previous results suggested 
128 
that A. muciniphila lipopolysaccharide (LPS) differs structurally from that of E. coli and is not a 
129 
powerful TLR4 agonist26. Here, we observed that A. muciniphila specifically activated cells 
130 
expressing TLR2 (Fig. 3a), but not cells expressing TLR5, TLR9 or the NOD2 receptor (Fig. 3b-
131 
d).  
132 
Genomic and proteomic analyses of A. muciniphila identified proteins encoded by a 
133 
specific Type IV pili gene cluster in fractions enriched for outer membrane proteins27. Among 
134 
these, Amuc_1100 was one of the most abundant. Additionally, its presence on a gene cluster 
135 
related to pilus formation suggests that it could be involved in the crosstalk with the host. To test 
136 
this hypothesis, we showed that a His-tagged Amuc_1100 produced in E. coli (hereafter called 
137 
Amuc_1100*) could signal to TLR2-expressing cells in a similar manner to A. muciniphila (Fig. 
138 
3a). Furthermore, Amuc_1100* appeared relatively thermostable as differential light scattering 
139 
analysis indicated its melting temperature was 70°C (Fig. 3e), which is the temperature applied 
140 
for pasteurization. Therefore, Amuc_1100 could still be active in pasteurized bacteria and 
141 
contribute to the observed signaling.  
142 
Consequently, we compared the effects of the live and pasteurized bacterium to those of 
143 
Amuc_1100* in HFD-fed mice. Similarly to what was observed with the pasteurized bacterium, 
144 
treatment with Amuc_1100* induced a lower body weight and fat mass gain when compared to 
145 
untreated HFD-fed mice, independently of food intake (Fig. 3f-h). It also tended to correct HFD-
146 
induced higher adipocyte diameter (Supplemental Fig. 3a,b). Treatment with A. muciniphila or 
147 
Amuc_1100* corrected HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia, with significantly lower plasma 
148 
HDL-cholesterol concentrations and a similar trend for LDL-cholesterol (Fig. 3i). Mice treated 
149 
with pasteurized A. muciniphila displayed significantly lower plasma triglycerides concentrations 
150 
when compared to either untreated mice or HFD-fed mice treated with live A. muciniphila, again 
151 
suggesting an increased potency of the bacterium after pasteurization (Fig. 3j). No differences 
152 
were observed in the distribution of triglycerides and cholesterol in lipoproteins (Supplemental 
153 
Fig. 3c-d). Amuc_1100* also improved glucose tolerance with the same potency as the live and 
154 
pasteurized bacterium (Fig. 3k,l). To further investigate the effects of A. muciniphila on insulin 
155 
sensitivity, we analyzed insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and its 
156 
 6 
 
downstream mediator Akt at the threonine (Aktthr) and serine (Aktser) sites28 in the liver (Fig. 
157 
3m,n). As previously described, untreated HFD-fed mice displayed lower phosphorylation of all 
158 
analyzed proteins when compared to ND-fed mice29, reaching significance for Aktthr (Fig. 3n). 
159 
Treatment with A. muciniphila or Amuc_1100* counteracted these effects, with significantly 
160 
higher levels of p-IR and p-Aktthr in mice treated with Amuc_1100* (Fig. 3m-n) and 
161 
significantly higher levels of p-Aktser in mice treated with the live bacterium (Fig. 3n) when 
162 
compared to untreated HFD-fed mice. 
163 
Previous reports show that beneficial effects of A. muciniphila are associated to 
164 
improvements of the gut barrier function8,13,22,26 leading to a correction of metabolic endotoxemia 
165 
(i.e. increased portal LPS concentration) in obese and diabetic mice. We therefore assessed the 
166 
effects of pasteurized A. muciniphila and Amuc_1100* on endotoxemia and genes associated 
167 
with the intestinal barrier. While HFD-fed mice displayed higher portal LPS concentration than 
168 
ND-fed mice, treatment with Akkermansia –either live or pasteurized– or Amuc_1100* 
169 
completely restored LPS concentration to that observed in the ND group (Fig. 4a). Among the 
170 
assessed markers of the gut barrier, we found that expression of Cnr1, coding for the cannabinoid 
171 
receptor 1 (CB1), was specifically lower in the jejunum of mice treated with Amuc_1100* (Fig. 
172 
4b). Interestingly, activation of CB1 was shown to increase intestinal permeability in vitro, 
173 
whereas blocking CB1 reduces gut permeability both in vitro and in vivo30. Consistently with 
174 
these findings, genes encoding tight-junction proteins involved in the regulation of intestinal 
175 
permeability were also affected. In the jejunum, expression of Cldn3 (encoding Claudin3) was 
176 
higher in mice treated with Amuc_1100* when compared to untreated HFD-fed mice (Fig. 4b) 
177 
while Ocln (encoding Occludin) was higher in all treated groups when compared to ND-fed mice, 
178 
as well as when comparing untreated HFD-fed mice with mice receiving Amuc_1100* (Fig. 4b). 
179 
In the ileum, a trend for lower Cnr1 expression was observed following treatment with A. 
180 
muciniphila (Fig. 4c). Cldn3 expression was greater in all treated groups when compared to 
181 
untreated ND- and HFD-fed mice, while Ocln was unaffected (Fig. 4c). These effects could 
182 
notably be explained by the ability of A. muciniphila to activate TLR2 via Amuc_1100, as this 
183 
receptor can regulate various tight-junction proteins including Occludin and Claudin 331,32. In the 
184 
colon, untreated HFD-fed mice had a higher Ocln expression as compared to the other groups, 
185 
whereas Cnr1 tended to be higher in all HFD-fed groups and Cldn3 was not modified 
186 
(Supplemental Fig. 4a).  
187 
 7 
 
We next assessed markers of the synthesis (Napepld) and the degradation (Naaa) of 
188 
different endocannabinoids and bioactive lipids from the N-acylethanolamine (NAEs) family33. 
189 
Napepld expression was lower specifically in the jejunum following treatment with pasteurized 
190 
A. muciniphila when compared to ND-fed mice or mice treated with Amuc_1100* 
191 
(Supplemental Fig. 4b). Naaa however was not modified by any treatment in all intestinal 
192 
segments (Supplemental Fig. 4b-d). Therefore, this set of data suggests that Amuc_1100* and 
193 
pasteurized A. muciniphila exhibited distinct mechanisms of action on the endocannabinoid 
194 
system. 
195 
Antimicrobial peptides are also contributing to the gut barrier function by shaping the gut 
196 
microbiota34. We found that mice treated with pasteurized A. muciniphila had significantly higher 
197 
Lyz1 expression in both the jejunum and ileum when compared to ND-fed mice, while 
198 
Amuc_1100* did not significantly affect this parameter (Fig. 4d,e). We observed a significantly 
199 
lower DefA expression in the jejunum of mice treated with pasteurized A. muciniphila and 
200 
Amuc_1100* as compared to ND-fed mice (Fig. 4d). In the ileum, mice treated with 
201 
Amuc_1100* had significantly lower DefA expression as compared to mice treated with either 
202 
live or pasteurized A. muciniphila (Fig. 4e). This again suggests different mechanisms of action 
203 
of Amuc_1100* and pasteurized A. muciniphila, here on antimicrobial peptides. However, 
204 
treatment with A. muciniphila or Amuc_1100* did not change the HFD-mediated lower Reg3g 
205 
and Pla2g2 expression (Fig. 4d,e and Supplemental Fig. 4e). Altogether, these results suggest 
206 
that Amuc_1100* and pasteurized A. muciniphila act on different targets to reinforce the 
207 
intestinal barrier in the jejunum and ileum, which could explain the correction of HFD-induced 
208 
metabolic endotoxemia in treated mice.  
209 
Finally, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of A. muciniphila in individuals with 
210 
excess body weight by treating them with different doses of live A. muciniphila (Akk Synthetic - 
211 
1010 and Akk Synthetic - 109) or pasteurized A. muciniphila (Akk Pasteurized - 1010) as part of an 
212 
ongoing clinical study testing the efficacy of this bacterium on metabolic parameters associated 
213 
with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Subjects are currently being recruited and analyzed, 
214 
and complete results will be reported once the study is complete (end of 2017). Anthropomorphic 
215 
characteristics of the subjects at the beginning of treatment are reported in Supplemental Table 1. 
216 
We analyzed several clinical parameters measured in probiotics safety assessments35-37 before 
217 
and after two weeks of treatment. No significant changes on markers related to inflammation and 
218 
 8 
 
hematology, kidney, liver and muscle function were observed with any formulation of A. 
219 
muciniphila (Supplemental Fig. 5 and Supplemental Table 2). Moreover, the frequency of 
220 
recorded adverse effects was similar in all groups (Supplemental Table 3). Borborygmi were 
221 
reported by some subjects treated with live A. muciniphila, but the difference with other groups 
222 
was not significant. While the number of subjects is limited, these first human data suggest that 
223 
both live and pasteurized A. muciniphila are well tolerated in subjects with excess body weight 
224 
and appear safe for oral administration in the context of obesity. 
225 
A. muciniphila is a promising target in the management of obesity and related disorders. 
226 
Several studies have shown positive associations between A. muciniphila and the host metabolic 
227 
health. Moreover, various dietary interventions targeting obesity and glucose intolerance increase 
228 
A. muciniphila abundance8,34,38 as does the glucose-lowering drug metformin3,13. To our 
229 
knowledge, A. muciniphila is currently unique in the field of next-generation probiotic research 
230 
as it resides in the mucus layer, a niche in close vicinity of host cells, and because it displays 
231 
beneficial effects on several pathologies. Direct administration has proven protective not only 
232 
against obesity but also against type 2 diabetes, gut barrier disturbances as well as atherosclerosis 
233 
in various studies8,13,14,22. Moreover, metagenomics data suggest that A. muciniphila abundance 
234 
could also be inversely associated with type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disorders39,40. 
235 
However, translational evaluation of A. muciniphila for human therapeutics is hampered by the 
236 
requirement for animal-derived compounds in the growth medium of the bacterium. To 
237 
circumvent this issue, we tested the effects of A. muciniphila grown on a synthetic medium 
238 
compatible with human administration. We show in mice that effects on obesity and glucose 
239 
metabolism are generally conserved when compared to the bacterium grown on a mucus-based 
240 
medium.  
241 
Another hurdle to the use of live A. muciniphila in human subjects is its high sensitivity to 
242 
oxygen. Here, we show that non-replicative, pasteurized A. muciniphila had stronger effects on 
243 
body weight gain, fat mass gain and glucose intolerance in HFD-fed mice. These effects are 
244 
associated with specific modulations of the host urinary metabolome, decreased intestinal energy 
245 
absorption, normalization of plasma LPS concentration and decreased triglyceridemia. Moreover, 
246 
we show that the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100* is involved in the A. muciniphila-to-host 
247 
interaction through TLR2 signaling, and that it partially recapitulates the effects of A. muciniphila 
248 
against obesity, insulin resistance and gut barrier alteration. How pasteurization enhances the 
249 
 9 
 
effects of A. muciniphila remains to be elucidated. The fact that Amuc_1100* is still stable at 
250 
70°C suggests it could still be signaling in pasteurized cells and that pasteurization enhances the 
251 
effects of A. muciniphila by increasing accessibility of this protein to the host. Whether this 
252 
improvement of beneficial effects through pasteurization is specific to A. muciniphila or could be 
253 
extended to other bacteria also needs to be tested. Regardless, pasteurization could represent an 
254 
innovative way to use anaerobic strains as a therapeutic tool. Moreover, identification and 
255 
isolation of specific bacterial products recapitulating all or part of the effects of the live organism 
256 
could prove useful in the treatment of conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, where 
257 
direct administration of live probiotics would be challenging. 
258 
Finally, preliminary human data suggest that treatment with either live or pasteurized A. 
259 
muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium is safe in individuals with excess body weight, as no 
260 
changes in relevant safety clinical parameters or reported adverse events were observed after two 
261 
weeks of treatment. These results pave the way for future human studies investigating A. 
262 
muciniphila as a therapeutic tool in the management of the metabolic syndrome.

 Online Methods 
470 
Culture and pasteurization of Akkermansia muciniphila 
471 
A. muciniphila MucT (ATTC BAA-835) was cultured anaerobically in a basal mucin-based 
472 
medium as previously described9, or in a synthetic medium where mucin was replaced by 16 g/l 
473 
soy-peptone, 4 g/l threonine, and a mix of glucose and N-acetylglucosamine (25 mM each). 
474 
Cultures were washed and concentrated in anaerobic PBS with 25% (vol/vol) glycerol under 
475 
strict anaerobic conditions. Additionally, an identical quantity of A. muciniphila grown on the 
476 
synthetic medium was inactivated by pasteurization for 30 min at 70°C. Cultures were then 
477 
immediately frozen and stored at -80 °C. A representative glycerol stock was thawed under 
478 
anaerobic conditions to determine the CFU/ml by plate counting using mucin media containing 
479 
1% agarose (agar noble; Difco). Before administration by oral gavage, glycerol stocks were 
480 
thawed under anaerobic conditions and diluted with anaerobic PBS to an end concentration of 
481 
2.108 CFU/150 µl and 2.5% glycerol. 
482 
Mice 
483 
Cohorts of 10 to 11-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, L’Arbresle, France) were 
484 
housed in a controlled environment (12h daylight cycle, lights off at 6 pm) in groups of two mice 
485 
per cage, with free access to food and water. Upon delivery, mice underwent an acclimation 
486 
period of one week, during which they were fed a control diet (ND) (AIN93Mi, Research Diet, 
487 
New Brunswick, NJ, USA). At the beginning of each experiment, cages were randomly mixed to 
488 
ensure that each group was matched in terms of body weight and fat mass. No blinding procedure 
489 
was followed. Mice were fed a normal chow diet (ND) (AIN93Mi, Research diet, New 
490 
Brunswick, NJ, USA) or a high-fat diet (HFD) (60% fat and 20% carbohydrates (kcal/100g) 
491 
D12492i, Research diet, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Body weight, food and water intake were 
492 
recorded once weekly. Body composition was assessed by using 7.5MHz time domain-nuclear 
493 
magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) (LF50 Minispec, Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). Mice 
494 
experiments were not performed in a blinded manner. 
495 
For the first experiment, mice were treated daily with an oral administration of A. muciniphila 
496 
grown on the mucus-based medium (HFD Akk M) or the synthetic medium (HFD Akk S). 
497 
Additionally, one group of mice was treated daily with an oral administration of pasteurized A. 
498 
muciniphila (HFD Akk P).  Control groups (ND and HFD) were treated with an oral gavage of an 
499 
equivalent volume of sterile PBS containing 2.5% glycerol. Treatment was continued for 4 
500 
weeks. 
501 
For the second experiment, mice were treated daily with an oral administration of either live or 
502 
pasteurized A. muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium (HFD Akk S and HFD Akk P, 
503 
respectively). Control groups (ND and HFD) were treated with an oral gavage of an equivalent 
504 
volume of sterile PBS containing 2.5% glycerol. Treatment was continued for 5 weeks. Fresh 
505 
urinary samples were collected during the final week of treatment and directly stored at -80°C 
506 
before analysis. Circulating leptin and resistin concentrations were determined using a multiplex 
507 
immunoassay kit (Merck Millipore, Brussels, Belgium) and measured using Luminex technology 
508 
(Bioplex, Bio-Rad, Belgium) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Circulating adiponectin 
509 
concentrations were determined using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
510 
USA). Fecal energy content was measured on fecal samples harvested after a 24h period during 
511 
the final week of treatment by the use of a bomb calorimeter (Mouse Clinical Institute, Illkirch, 
512 
France).  
513

For the third experiment, mice were treated daily with an oral administration of either live or 
514 
pasteurized A. muciniphila grown on the synthetic medium (HFD Akk S and HFD Akk P, 
515 
respectively). Additionally, one group of mice was treated with a daily oral administration of 3 
516 
µg of the protein Amuc_1100* (see below) in an equivalent volume of sterile PBS containing 
517 
2.5% glycerol. This dose of Amuc_1100* was estimated to be equivalent to 1,5.108 CFU of A. 
518 
muciniphila through the use of an in-house polyclonal antibody. Control groups (ND and HFD) 
519 
were treated with an oral gavage of an equivalent volume of of sterile PBS containing 2.5% 
520 
glycerol. Treatment was continued for 5 weeks.  
521 
All mouse experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the 
522 
local ethics committee. Housing conditions were specified by the Belgian Law of May 29, 2013, 
523 
regarding the protection of laboratory animals (agreement number LA1230314). 
524 
Exclusion criteria were predefined as follows: Mice displaying abnormal behavior under a HFD 
525 
(e.g. increased aggressiveness leading to alteration of food intake and/or body weight loss) during 
526 
the follow-up period were excluded from analyses. All tissues were carefully examined during 
527 
necropsy and sampling. Any mouse displaying lesions (e.g. granulous liver) was also excluded. 
528 
Finally, for all analyses and for each group, any exclusion decision was supported by the use of 
529 
the Grubbs test for outlier detection. Moreover, during the second experiment, 2 mice from the 
530 
same cage in the group HFD Akk S were excluded from analysis of the OGTT and insulin data 
531 
displayed in figure S1d-g, because of aggressiveness and fighting throughout the OGTT leading 
532 
to abnormal blood glucose and insulin values. 
533 
Oral glucose tolerance test 
534 
6h-fasted mice were treated with an oral gavage glucose load (2 g glucose per kg body weight). 
535 
Blood glucose was measured before oral glucose load and 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral 
536 
glucose load. Blood glucose was determined with a glucose meter (Accu Check, Roche, 
537 
Switzerland) on blood samples collected from the tip of the tail vein. 
538 
Insulin resistance index 
539 
Plasma insulin concentration was determined on samples using an ELISA kit (Mercodia, 
540 
Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Insulin resistance index was 
541 
determined by multiplying the area under the curve of both blood glucose (-30 to 120 min) and 
542 
plasma insulin (-30 and 15 min) obtained following the oral glucose tolerance test. 
543 
Tissue sampling 
544 
At the end of the treatment period, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott, 
545 
England) and blood was sampled from the portal and cava veins. After exsanguination, mice 
546 
were killed by cervical dislocation. Subcutaneous adipose tissue depots, intestines and liver were 
547 
precisely dissected, weighed and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80℃ for 
548 
further analysis. 
549 
Histological analyses 
550 
Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depots and ileal tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
551 
for 24 hours at room temperature. Samples were then immersed in ethanol 100% for 24 hours 
552 
prior to processing for paraffin embedding. For the determination of Goblet cell density, ileal 
553 
paraffin sections of 5 µm were stained with Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and counterstained with 
554 
hematoxylin and eosin. Images were obtained using a SCN400 slide scanner and Digital Image 
555 
Hub software (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The number of goblet cells present on one 
556 
 18 
 
villus was quantified and divided by the villus length. A minimum of 5 villi were analyzed per 
557 
mouse in a blinded manner.  
558 
For the SAT adipose tissue diameter, paraffin sections of 5 µm were stained with hematoxylin 
559 
and eosin. Images were obtained using a SCN400 slide scanner and Digital Image Hub software 
560 
(Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). 5 high-magnification fields were selected at random for 
561 
each mouse and adipocyte diameter was determined using ImageJ (Version 1.50a, National 
562 
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). 
563 
Urinary metabonomics analyses 
564 
Mouse urine samples were prepared and measured on a spectrometer (Bruker) operating at 
565 
600.22 MHz 1H frequency according to previously published protocol41; the 1H NMR spectra 
566 
were then processed and analyzed as described previously18. 
567 
UPLC-MS/MS determination of plasma TMA and TMAO concentrations 
568 
Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was 
569 
employed for the determination of plasma TMA and TMAO. Plasma samples (10μL) were 
570 
prepared as follows: I) samples were spiked with 10 μL Internal Standard (IS) solution (13C3/15N-
571 
TMA, d9-TMAO in water; 1 mg/l, Sigma-Aldrich). II) 45 μL of ethyl 2-bromoacetate solution 
572 
(15g/l ethyl 2-bromoacetate, 1% NH4OH in acetonitrile) were added and derivatization of 
573 
trimethylamines (TMA and 13C3/15N-TMA) to their ethoxy- analogues was completed after 30 
574 
minutes at room temperature. III) 935 μL of protein/lipid precipitation solution (94% 
575 
acetonitrile/5%water/1% formic acid) was added; samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes (4°C, 
576 
20000g) and were transferred to UPLC-autosampler vials. Sample injections (5 μL loop) were 
577 
performed to a Waters Acquity UPLC-Xevo TQ-S UPLC-MS/MS system equipped with an 
578 
Acquity BEH HILIC (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 µm) chromatographic column. An isocratic elution was 
579 
applied with 10 mM ammonium formate in 95:5 (v/v) acetronitrile:water for 7 minutes at 
580 
750μl/min and 50°C. Positive electrospray (ESI+) was used as ionisation source and mass 
581 
spectrometer parameters were set as follows: capillary, cone and sources voltages at -700, -18 
582 
and 50 V respectively, desolvation temperature at 600°C, desolvation/cone/nebuliser gases were 
583 
high purity nitrogen at 1000 l/hr, 150 l/hr and 7 bar respectively. Collision gas was high purity 
584 
argon.  Mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The 
585 
monitored transitions were the following: for derivatised-TMA, +146 → +118/59 m/z (23/27 V); 
586 
for derivatised-13C3/15N-TMA, +150 → +63/122 m/z (27/22V); for TMAO, +76 → +59/58 m/z 
587 
(12/13 V); for d9-TMAO, +85 → +68/66 m/z (18/20 V). The system was controlled by the 
588 
MassLynx software, also used for the data acquisition and analysis.  
589 
RNA preparation and Real-time qPCR analysis 
590 
Total RNA was prepared from tissues using TriPure reagent (Roche). Quantification and integrity 
591 
analysis of total RNA was performed by running 1 μl of each sample on an Agilent 2100 
592 
Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit, Agilent). The cDNA was prepared by reverse 
593 
transcription, and real-time qPCR was performed as previously described8. RPL19 RNA was 
594 
chosen as the housekeeping gene.  Sequences of the primers used for real-time qPCR are 
595 
available in Table S1.  
596 
Production of Amuc_1100* Protein 
597 
An expression plasmid for the production of His-tagged Amuc_1100, here termed Amuc_1100*, 
598 
was constructed by amplification of its gene devoid of the coding sequence for its signal 
599 
 19 
 
sequence and cloning the resulting PCR product in pET-26b E. coli XL1Blue (Novagen®,  
600 
Merck  Millipore,  MA, USA). The following primer sequences were used for the construct: 5’-
601 
GGGTACCATATGATCGTCAATTCCAAACGC-3’ 
(Forward) 
and 
5’- 
602 
CCTTGGCTCGAGATCTTCAGACGGTTCCTG-3’ 
(Reverse). 
 
Bolded 
sequences 
are 
603 
restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI enzymes, respectively (Thermoscientific, MA, USA).  
604 
Conformation of the resulting plasmid pET-26b-1100 was verified by sequence analysis and 
605 
transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). This strain was then grown in LB-broth containing 
606 
kanamycin (50 μg/ml) with shaking at 220 rpm at 37° C, followed by induction through the 
607 
addition of 1mM IPTG in the growth medium during mid exponential phase. After three hours of 
608 
induction, cells were pelleted by centrifuging 10 min at 5000 g and cell pellets stored at -20°C 
609 
until lysis. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed using lysozyme and sonification (Sonifier 
610 
450, Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT, USA).  Supernatant was collected  after  
611 
centrifugation and the Amuc_1100* protein  purified  by  metal  affinity  purification under  
612 
native  conditions  using  Ni-16NTA  His•Bind  Resin  (Novagen®,  Merck  Millipore,  MA,  
613 
USA). After buffer exchange using a Zeba spin column, the protein content was determined 
614 
(BCA assay; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and the Amuc_1100* protein was stored at -20°C. 
615 
Extraction of A. muciniphila LPS 
616 
A. muciniphila LPS was extracted using the hot phenol-water extraction method as described 
617 
previously42, with minor modifications. Briefly, bacterial cells from 5 ml overnight cultures were 
618 
collected by centrifugation, washed once with water and resuspended into 500 µl of ultrapure 
619 
water. The bacterial suspensions were warmed up at 65°C and then mixed with an equal volume 
620 
of water-saturated phenol preheated to 65°C. The mixture was incubated at 65°C for 10 min and 
621 
then transferred to ice to cool down. After centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min, the aqueous layer was 
622 
carefully transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and the incubation with an equal volume of hot 
623 
phenol was repeated twice. After this two volumes of acetone were added to the aqueous layer to 
624 
precipitate LPS. The suspension was incubated at -20°C for two hours after which it was 
625 
centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes and the pellet was dissolved in 50 µl of LPS-free water. 
626 
In vitro culture and stimulation of human HEK-Blue hTLR2/5/9/NOD2 cell lines.  
627 
For the immune receptor stimulation analysis HEK-Blue hTLR2, hTLR5, hTLR9 and hNOD2 
628 
cell lines (Invivogen, CA, USA) were used. Cells were authenticated by Invivogen. Presence of 
629 
mycoplasma contamination was assessed regularly through a PCR-based method. Stimulation of 
630 
the receptors with the corresponding ligands activates NF-κB and AP-1, which induces the 
631 
production of secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), the levels of which were 
632 
measured by spectrophotometer (Spectramax, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). All cell lines were 
633 
grown and subcultured up to 70–80% of confluency using as a maintenance medium Dulbecco's 
634 
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/l D-glucose, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 
635 
µg/ml streptomycin, 100 µg/ml Normocin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated 
636 
FBS. For each cell line, an immune response experiment was carried out by seeding HEK-blue 
637 
cells in flat-bottom 96-well plates and stimulating them by addition of 20 µl bacterial 
638 
suspensions. The 96-well plates were incubated for 20–24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 
639 
Receptor ligands Pam3CSK4 (10 ng/ml for hTLR2), RecFLA-ST (0.1 ng/ml for hTLR5), ODN 
640 
2006 (50 µM for hTLR9) and L18-MDP (0.1 ng/ml for hNOD2) were used as positive control 
641 
whereas maintenance medium (DMEM) without any selective antibiotics was used as negative 
642 
control. SEAP secretion was detected by measuring the OD600 at 1 h after addition of 180 µL of 
643 
QUANTI-Blue (Invivogen) to 20 µL of induced HEK-Blue hTLR2/5/9/NOD2 supernatant.

Dynamic light scattering analysis 
645 
Heat induced aggregation of Amuc_1100* was measured by light scattering on a Carry Eclipse 
646 
Fluoroscence spectrophotometer (Agilent Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with 
647 
Cary temperature controller and thermophobes. Amuc_1100* (at the concentration of 15 μM) 
648 
was heated in presence of PBS (pH 7.4) at a constant rate of 1°C /min from 30°C to 100°C. The 
649 
light scattering at 350 nm was measured with excitation and emission slits at 2.5 nm.  
650 
Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography 
651 
Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were measured with commercial kits (CHOD-
652 
PAP for cholesterol and GPO-PAP for TG; BIOLABO SA, Maizy, France). Separation of plasma 
653 
lipoproteins was performed using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC, AKTA purifier 10, 
654 
GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). 50 µl of individual plasma was injected and lipoproteins 
655 
were separated on Superose™ 6 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) with 
656 
NaCl 0.15 M at pH 7.4 as mobile phase at a 1ml/min flow rate. The effluent was collected into 
657 
fractions of 0.3 ml then cholesterol and TG content in each fraction were determined as described 
658 
above. Quantification of cholesterol in lipoprotein classes (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) was 
659 
performed by measuring the percentage peak area and by multiplying each percentage to the total 
660 
amount of cholesterol. 
661 
Western-blot 
662 
To analyze the insulin signaling pathway in the third experiment, mice were allocated to either a 
663 
saline-injected subgroup or an insulin-injected subgroup so that both subgroups were matched in 
664 
terms of body weight and fat mass. They then received 1 mU insulin/g body weight (Actrapid; 
665 
Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) under anesthesia with isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott, England), or 
666 
an equal volume of saline solution into the portal vein. Three minutes after injection, mice were 
667 
killed and liver was harvested. 
668 
For detection of proteins of the insulin signaling pathway, tissues were homogenized in ERK 
669 
buffer (Triton X-100 0.1%, HEPES 50 mM, NaCl 5 M, Glycerol 10%, MgCl2 1.5mM and DTT 
670 
1mM) supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal 
671 
amounts of proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.  
672 
Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline 
673 
tween-20 containing 1% non-fat dry milk: p-IRβ (1:1,000; sc-25103, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p-
674 
AktThr308 (1:1,000; #2965L, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) and p-AktSer473 (1:1,000; 
675 
#4060L, Cell Signaling). Quantification of phospho-proteins was performed on 5 animals with 
676 
insulin injection and 5 animals with saline injection per group. The loading control was β-actin 
677 
(1:10,000; ab6276). 
678 
Plasma LPS analysis 
679 
Portal vein plasma LPS concentration was measured using an Endosafe-Multi-Cartridge System 
680 
(Charles River Laboratories, MA, USA), as previously described8. 
681 
Safety assessment of live and pasteurized A. muciniphila 
682 
Results presented in this manuscript are interim safety reports from twenty subjects with excess 
683 
body weight (Body mass index > 25 kg/m²) presenting a metabolic syndrome following the 
684 
NCEP ATP III definition (any three of the five following criteria: fasting glycaemia > 110 mg/dl,

688 
Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium between December 2015 and May 2016. Subjects 
689 
were assigned to any of the treatment arms following a randomized block design. The exclusion

703 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7.5%. The Commission d’Ethique Biomédicale Hospitalo-
704 
facultaire from the Université catholique de Louvain (Brussels, Belgium) provided ethical 
705 
approval for this study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The 
706 
trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02637115. 
707 
Subjects were assigned to receive either a daily dose of placebo (an equivalent volume of sterile 
708 
PBS containing glycerol), 1010 CFU live A. muciniphila (Akk S - 1010), 109 CFU live A. 
709 
muciniphila (Akk S – 109), or 1010 CFU pasteurized A. muciniphila (Akk P - 1010) for 3 months 
710 
(placebo and bacteria were produced at a food-grade level according to the HACCP quality 
711 
system). Blood samples were collected at the beginning of the treatment and a portion was 
712 
directly sent to the hospital laboratory to measure relevant clinical parameters. Different tubes 
713 
were used based on the clinical parameter: EDTA-coated tubes for white blood cell count, 
714 
Sodium fluoride-coated tubes for fasting glycemia, citrate-coated tubes for clotting assays, and 
715 
lithium-heparin-coated tubes for urea and enzymatic activities. After 2 weeks of treatment, 
716 
subjects came back to the hospital for a safety visit, where blood samples were collected to allow 
717 
comparison of clinical parameters to baseline values. Both the subjects and the physicians were 
718 
blinded to the treatment.  
719 
Statistical analysis 
720 
Mouse data are expressed as the mean + SEM. Number of mice allocated per group was based on 
721 
previous experiments investigating the effects of Akkermansia muciniphila on diet-induced 
722 
obesity8. Variance was compared using a Bartlett’s test. If variances were significantly different 
723 
between groups, values were normalized by Log-transformation before proceeding to the 
724 
analysis. Differences between groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA, followed by the 
725 
Tukey post-hoc test. In cases when variance differed significantly between groups even after 
726 
normalization, a Kruskal-Wallis test was performed, followed by the Dunnett post-hoc test. A 
727 
two-way ANOVA analysis with a Bonferonni post-hoc test was performed for the evolution of 
728 
glycemia and insulinemia during the OGTT, for the repartition of cholesterol and triglycerides in 
729 
specific lipoproteins and for Western-blot analyses.  
730 
 22 
 
In vitro data are expressed as the mean + SEM. Variance was compared using a Bartlett’s test. If 
731 
variances were significantly different between groups, values were normalized by Log-
732 
transformation before proceeding to the analysis. Differences between groups were assessed 
733 
using one-way ANOVA, followed by a Dunns post-hoc test comparing all conditions to DMEM. 
734 
In cases when variance differed significantly between groups even after normalization, a Kruskal-
735 
Wallis test was performed. For the dynamic light scattering analysis of Amuc_1100*, a 
736 
Boltzmann – Sigmoid curve was fitted to the data. 
737 
Human data are expressed as the mean + SD. Differences between groups were assessed using 
738 
Kruskal-Wallis test. Differences between values observed at baseline and at the time of the safety 
739 
visit were assessed using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Data were analyzed using 
740 
GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  
741 
Statistical comparisons were indicated with *,**,*** for P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 
742 
respectively
