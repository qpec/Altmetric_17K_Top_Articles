Cancer cells express tumour-specific antigens derived via genetic and epigenetic alterations,
which may be targeted by T-cell-mediated immune responses. However, cancer cells can
avoid immune surveillance by suppressing immunity through activation of specific inhibitory
signalling pathways, referred to as immune checkpoints. In recent years, the blockade of
checkpoint molecules such as PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, with monoclonal antibodies has
enabled the development of breakthrough therapies in oncology, and four therapeutic
antibodies targeting these checkpoint molecules have been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of several types of cancer. Here, we report the crystal structures of checkpoint
molecules in complex with the Fab fragments of therapeutic antibodies, including
PD-1/pembrolizumab, PD-1/nivolumab, PD-L1/BMS-936559 and CTLA-4/tremelimumab.
These complex structures elucidate the precise epitopes of the antibodies and the molecular
mechanisms underlying checkpoint blockade, providing useful information for the improve-
ment of monoclonal antibodies capable of attenuating checkpoint signalling for the treatment
of cancer.

 A
s the immune system plays an important role in
controlling cancer, utilizing the immune system to
eliminate cancer holds great potential. Although various
immunotherapeutic approaches have been shown to enhance the
immune
system’s
ability
to
modulate
cancer,
therapeutic
antibodies that target regulatory pathways in T-cells to enhance
antitumor immune responses, have attracted significant recent
attention.
T-cell-mediated immune responses are triggered through the
recognition of antigenic peptide/HLA complexes on the surface of
antigen presenting cells (APCs) by T-cell receptors and are tightly
regulated by antigen-independent co-receptor signals, either
costimulatory or coinhibitory, providing the optimal balance
between immune responses to antigens and maintenance of self-
tolerance under normal physiological conditions1–3. Costimu-
latory signals are required to enhance and sustain the function of
T-cells, the most important of which is provided by the
interaction of CD28, a co-receptor on T-cells, with its ligands
B7-1 and B7-2 on APCs (refs 4,5). In contrast, the binding of the
same B7 ligands to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen
4 (CTLA-4), a CD28 homologue with 31% sequence identity,
delivers coinhibitory signals for down-regulation of immune
responses6. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is also an antigen-
independent co-receptor and plays a pivotal role in modulating
immune responses7. The interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-
L1 and PD-L2 on APCs induces inhibitory signals reducing T-cell
activity8,9. Although both CTLA-4 and PD-1 are coinhibitory
receptors, each plays a non-redundant role in the negative
regulation of immune responses. While engagement of CTLA-4
by B7 ligands attenuates the early activation of naı
¨ve and memory
T-cells, PD-1 modulates the function of T-cells later in peripheral
tissues via interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 (ref. 10).
As cancer cells harbour genetic and epigenetic modifications,
tumour-specific antigens are presented on the cancer cell surface
and can be recognized by T-cells, therefore causing immune
responses11–14. However, cancer cells can also evade immuno-
logical recognition and destruction through the activation of
coinhibitory signalling by overproduction of immune checkpoint
proteins such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 on immune effector cells and
PD-L1 on cancer cells15–17. Furthermore, expression of PD-L1 on
cancer cells can directly lead to the death of antigen-specific
effector T-cells expressing PD-1 (ref. 18). In an inflamed tumour
microenvironment, engagement of PD-1 or CTLA-4 can self-
limit the antitumor immune responses and permit cancer cells to
proliferate unrestrained. Advances in the understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of cancer cells to
suppress
immune
surveillance
have
devised
strategies
to
overcome cancer-induced immune tolerance, thereby protecting
the host from tumour progression. Blockade of the ligand-
receptor interaction of these immune checkpoint molecules can
directly enhance the function of T-cells, which represents a
critical paradigm shift whereby checkpoint blockade aims at
disinhibition of the activity of T-cells compared with the
previous immuno-oncology concept, whereby cancer vaccines
and cytokine therapies aimed at de novo activation of immune
responses.
Monoclonal antibodies blocking immune checkpoints have
demonstrated unprecedented therapeutic benefits in clinical trials
and provided a major breakthrough in oncology19–23. While
targeted therapies elicit transient clinical responses because of
acquisition of cancer drug resistance usually occurring within
months after an initial response, the clinical responses of
checkpoint blockade therapies are often durable, with some
patients free from cancer progression for many years19,24,25. The
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
monoclonal antibodies that block CTLA-4 (ipilimumab), PD-1
(pembrolizumab and nivolumab), and PD-L1 (atezolizumab) for
the treatment of melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell
carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer. As a number
of clinical trials for antibodies targeting immune checkpoints are
ongoing, additional approvals are expected for other antibodies
and expanded indications in the near future26.
There have been a number of structural studies for immune
checkpoint molecules. The structures of the extracellular portion
of CTLA-4 revealed an unusual mode of CTLA-4 dimerization
that places the B7 binding sites distal to the dimerization
interface27. The crystal structures of CTLA-4 in complex with its
B7 ligands showed the formation of a unique alternating network
of bivalent CTLA-4 and B7-1/2 dimers, providing a structural
basis for formation of unusually stable signalling complexes to
regulate
T-cell
responsiveness
within
the
immunological
synapse28,29. The structures of murine PD-1 in complex with
human PD-L1, murine PD-1 in complex with murine PD-L2, and
human PD-1 in complex with human PD-L1 have established
the structural foundations of the interaction of PD-1 with
its ligands30–33. These structural studies for checkpoint molecules
and
their
binding
complexes
have
provided
invaluable
information for understanding the molecular mechanism of
coinhibitory signals of T-cells through the communication of
checkpoint molecules.
As the exact epitope and mechanism are crucial elements for
antibody drugs, we report the crystal structures of checkpoint
molecules in complex with the Fab fragments of therapeutic
antibodies approved by the FDA or currently undergoing clinical
trials, and reveal the binding modes of the complexes and the
conformational changes induced by the antibody binding, thereby
providing a structural basis of checkpoint blockade by mono-
clonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer.
Results
Crystal structures of PD-1 in complex with anti-PD-1 drugs.
Pembrolizumab (trade name KEYTRUDA) is a humanized IgG4
antibody that blocks PD-1 (ref. 26). The FDA approved
pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced melanoma in
September 2014 and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) in October 2015. The PD-1/pembrolizumab Fab
fragment
complex
was
crystallized
and
its
structure
was
determined and refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å (Fig. 1a,b). The
pembrolizumab epitope of PD-1 consists of numerous dis-
continuous segments (Fig. 2a). The formation of hydrogen bonds
between PD-1 and pembrolizumab involves side chain atoms of
PD1N66, PD1T76, PD1K78, PD1S87 and PD1K131 and main chain
atoms of PD1F63, PD1E84, PD1S87, PD1G90 and PD1A132, whereas a
salt bridge is formed between PD1D85 and heavyR99. In addition,
the main chain atom of PD1K78 and the side chain atoms of
PD1S87 and PD1D85 participate in water-mediated interactions
with heavyN52 and heavyR99. The residues of PD-1 involved in van
der Waals contact with pembrolizumab are
PD1S62,
PD1V64,
PD1Y68,
PD1Q75,
PD1D77,
PD1A81,
PD1F82,
PD1P83,

PD1Q88,
PD1P89,
PD1G90,
PD1I126,
PD1L128,
PD1A129, and
PD1I134. The paratope of pembrolizumab consists of heavyT30,
heavyY33, and heavyY35 of HCDR1; heavyN52, heavyS54, heavyN55,
heavyG57, heavyT58, and heavyN59 of HCDR2; heavyR99, heavyY101,
heavyR102,
heavyF103,
heavyD104,
heavyM105,
and
heavyD108 of HCDR3; lightT31, lightS32, lightY34, and lightY36 of
LCDR1; lightY53, lightL54, lightY57, and lightE59 of LCDR2; and
lightS95, lightR96, lightD97, lightL98 and lightL100 of LCDR3.
Nivolumab (trade name OPDIVO) is a fully human IgG4 that
blocks PD-1 (ref. 26). The FDA approved nivolumab for the
treatment of melanoma in December 2014, NSCLC in March
2015, renal cell carcinoma in November 2015, and Hodgkin

 lymphoma in May 2016. The PD-1/nivolumab Fab complex and
free
nivolumab
Fab
fragment
were
crystallized
and
their
structures were determined and refined to a resolution of
3.3 and 1.9 Å, respectively (Fig. 1c,d). In the complex structure,
the formation of hydrogen bonds between PD-1 and nivolumab
involves side chain atoms of
PD1D29,
PD1R30,
PD1S60 and
PD1K131 and main chain atoms of PD1P28, PD1L128, PD1A129,
PD1P130, and PD1A132. The PD-1 residues involved in van der
Waals contact with nivolumab are
PD1S27,
PD1P28,
PD1P31,
PD1E61, PD1A129, PD1P130, PD1K131, PD1A132 and PD1Q133. The
residues of nivolumab involved in the interaction with PD-1 are
heavyG26, heavyI27, heavyN31 and heavyG33 of HCDR1; heavyV50,
heavyW52 and heavyY53 of HCDR2; heavyN99, heavyD100, heavyD101
and heavyY102 of HCDR3; lightL46, lightA55 and lightT56 of LCDR2;
and lightS91 of LCDR3 (Fig. 2b).
The total buried surface areas of the PD-1/pembrolizumab and
PD-1/nivolumab complexes are 2,126 Å2 and 1,487 Å2, respec-
tively, compared with 1,970 Å2 for PD-1/PD-L1 (ref. 30). The
epitopes of the two antibodies directly occupy part of the PD-L1
binding site (Fig. 2c). In addition, the binding of PD-1 with
pembrolizumab or nivolumab induces optimal conformational
changes in the BC loop (residues 57–63) and the FG loop
(residues 127–134) of PD-1, which are incompatible with PD-L1
binding as they also interact with PD-L1 in distinct conforma-
tions30 (Fig. 3a,b). The C0D loop (residues 81–90) was shown to
be highly flexible in the NMR structure of free PD-1 (ref. 31), and
disordered in the crystal structure of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex as
a result of the lack of interaction30,32,33. However, most of the
residues of the C0D loop in the PD-1/pembrolizumab complex are
involved in the interactions with pemrolizumab with a clear
electron density around them, implying that the C0D loop
contributes to the binding affinity for pembrolizumab. This loop
intrudes
into
the
groove
formed
by
the
CDR
loops
of
pembrolizumab (Fig. 3a,c). The electron density of the C0D
loop in the complex structure of PD-1/nivolumab is also clearly
shown, probably because of the crystal packing interaction despite
the lack of interaction with nivolumab (Fig. 3b). The structural
comparisons of the Fv regions of pembrolizumab and nivolumab
before and after binding to PD-1 show little deviation in the
conformation of the CDRs and minor adjustments in the side
chains involved in the interaction with PD-1, implying that these
antibody drugs maintain the CDR loops in productive binding
conformations prior to interaction with PD-1 (Supplementary
Fig. 1a,b). The high avidity of these two antibodies, which results
from the bivalency of IgG, could also contribute to their tight
binding to PD-1. Taken together, these structural features suggest
that the mechanism by which the anti-PD-1 antibodies block the
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is through outcompeting PD-L1 for
binding to PD-1.
Crystal structure of PD-L1 in complex with BMS-936559 Fab.
BMS-936559, a fully human IgG4 antibody that blocks PD-L1,
has been shown to induce objective responses in melanoma,
NSCLC, and certain other solid tumours in Phase I clinical
trials34,35. The PD-L1/BMS-936559 Fab fragment complex was
crystallized and its structure was determined and refined to a
resolution of 2.8 Å (Fig. 4). Superposition of the PD-L1 molecules
extracted from PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L1/BMS-936559 yielded a
root mean s.d. of 0.71 Å for all of the Ca atoms, indicating that no
significant overall structural difference occurred (Supplementary
Fig. 2). The side-chain atoms of PDL1D49, PDL1Y56 and PDL1H69
and main-chain atom of PDL1A121 participate in the formation of
hydrogen bonds between PD-L1 and BMS-936559, while a
salt bridge is formed by PDL1E58 (Fig. 5a). Numerous residues of
PD-L1, including PDL1A51, PDL1A53, PDL1I54, PDL1Y56, PDL1Q66,
PDL1V68, PDL1H69, PDL1R113, PDL1M115, PDL1S117, PDL1G119,
PDL1G120, PDL1D122 and PDL1Y123, are involved in van der Waals
contact with BMS-936559. The paratope of BMS-936559 consists
of heavyT31 and heavyY32 of HCDR1; heavyI52, heavyI54, heavyF55,
heavyK57, and heavyH59 of HCDR2; heavyK99, heavyS104, heavyG105,
heavyS106, heavyP107 and heavyF108 of HCDR3; lightT32 of LCDR1;
and lightS92, lightN93, and lightW94 of LCDR3. The total buried
surface area of PD-L1/BMS-936559 is 1,349 Å2, which is much
smaller than that of PD-1/PD-L1 (1,970 Å2) (ref. 30). However,
the epitope of BMS-936559 occupies a large part of the PD-1
binding site (Fig. 5b); in addition, high avidity, resulting from IgG
bivalency, is expected due to the high expression level of PD-L1
in many cancer types36, leading to efficient blockade of the
PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.
Crystal structure of CTLA-4 in complex with tremelimumab Fab.
Tremelimumab is a fully human IgG2 antibody that blocks
CTLA-4. In 2015, tremelimumab was granted Fast Track Desig-
nation and Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA as a potential
treatment for malignant mesothelioma. In addition, tremelimu-
mab is being studied in combination with an anti-PD-L1,
durvalumab,
in
multiple
tumour
types37.
The
CTLA-4/
tremelimumab Fab complex and free tremelimumab Fab were

a root mean square deviation of 1.08 Å for all of the Ca atoms,
indicating no significant deviation in the two structures except for
several residues at the antibody–antigen interface, which are not
involved in the interaction with B7 ligands (Supplementary
Fig. 3). As observed in the structure of free CTLA-4 and that of
CTLA-4 in complex with B7-1/2, the three consecutive proline
residues of the MYPPPYY (residues 99–105) sequence of the FG
loop of CTLA-4 in complex with tremelimumab adopt an
unusual cis-trans-cis conformation and participate in interactions
with the antibody28,29,38 (Fig. 7a). The tremelimumab epitope
partially occupies the B7-1/2 binding site of CTLA-4, with a
larger interface area between CTLA-4 and tremelimumab (buried
surface area of 1,802 Å2) than the receptor–ligand interface
(1,255 Å2 for CTLA-4/B7-1 and 1,212 Å2 for CTLA-4/B7-2)
(Fig. 7b). Therefore, the binding of tremelimumab to CTLA-4
efficiently competes with B7-1/2 binding to CTLA-4, thereby
blocking the function of CTLA-4 in cancer.
Discussion
Checkpoint-blocking antibodies have ensured significant advances
in cancer therapy and provided a new weapon against cancer.
The durability of this immunotherapy largely exceeds that
of other forms of anticancer therapy and sometimes enables
long-term remission where patients exhibit no clinical signs
of cancer for many years. However, monotherapies of these
drugs elicit the therapeutic benefit only in a fraction of
patients treated. As a critical next step in the progress toward
improving clinical responses, combination immunotherapies have
been intensively investigated39–41. Combinations of anti-CTLA-4
or anti-PD-1/PD-L1
therapies with
other
immunotherapies,
chemotherapies,
targeted
therapies,
hormonal
therapies
and
radiation therapies are being explored. The combination of anti-
CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 has been the most successful of these
combinations tested so far, probably because CTLA-4 and PD-1
modulate the activity of T-cells at different stages of T-cell
immunity16,26. Thus, dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 can be a
reasonable and synergistic combination therapy based on their
distinct mechanisms of action. In addition, structural studies of
therapeutic antibodies to reveal their precise epitopes and
therapeutic mechanisms can also facilitate a rational design of
combination immunotherapies, as different epitopes and molecular
mechanisms of therapeutic antibodies can lead to different
therapeutic effects even when therapeutic antibodies target the
same molecule42. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab partially share
epitopes and three-dimensional (3D) space when binding to PD-1,
implying that the mechanisms of antagonism of the two antibodies
are highly similar (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results are
consistent with earlier clinical data showing that the response rate
for both drugs appears similar26; thus, little synergistic therapeutic
effect should be expected from a combination of only these two
drugs.
CTLA-4 exists as a constitutive homodimer generated by an
intermolecular disulphide bond43 (Fig. 8a). Although a single
CTLA-4/tremelimumab Fab complex exists in an asymmetric
unit,
a
crystallographic
two-fold
symmetry
generates
a
homodimeric interface of CTLA-4, which is essentially identical

 to that observed in the structures of free CTLA-4 or CTLA-4
in complex with B7-1, B7-2, and engineered lipocalin 2
(refs 28,29,38,44), implying that tremelimumab binding does
not affect the homodimerization of CTLA-4 (Fig. 8b). In the
crystal structures of CTLA-4 in complex with B7-1 or B7-2, the
crystal packing generates an alternating periodic arrangement in
which bivalent CTLA-4 homodimers connect bivalent B7-1/2
homodimers, providing a model describing the assembly of
CTLA-4 and B7-1/2 at the interface between a T-cell and cancer
cell28,29 (Fig. 8c). In this model, the CTLA-4/B7 complex is
expected to span a distance of B140 Å, which includes the stalk
regions
connecting
these
molecules
to
the
opposing
cell
membranes. This distance is compatible with other ligand–
receptor interactions at the central zone of the immunological
synapse, suggesting that this oligomeric arrangement of CTLA-4/
B7 complex can facilitate the efficient use of low-abundance
CTLA-4 at the T-cell surface, thereby promoting the inhibitory
signalling of CTLA-4 and decreasing the local concentration of
CD28 through simple steric crowding28,29,45. As tremelimumab is
an IgG2 antibody, it is capable of binding two CTLA-4 molecules
with high avidity through Y-shaped bivalent presentation; the
dimension of the CTLA-4/tremelimumab complex is estimated
to span 150–190 Å. This distance is incompatible with the
oligomeric array of the CTLA-4/B7 complex (Fig. 8d). Therefore,
in addition to simple antagonism of the interaction between
CTLA-4 and B7-1/2, tremelimumab binding could prevent or
disrupt the uniquely organized assembly of the CTLA-4/B7
complex within the immunological synapse.
Despite the clinical success of checkpoint-blocking antibodies,
biologics such as therapeutic antibodies have several short-
comings, including the high cost, limited half-life and immuno-
genicity caused by multiple dosages. As an alternative treatment
strategy to overcome the drawbacks of passive antibody-based
therapy, several small-molecule immunomodulators targeting the
PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been reported46–50. While most of them
are based on peptidomimetics, a recent structural study with the
first
nonpeptidic
chemical
inhibitor
of
the
PD-1/PD-L1
interaction revealed that this compound binds to PD-L1 and
induces dimerization of PD-L1, thus occluding the PD-1 binding
site of PD-L1 (ref. 51). Interestingly, the complex structure of
CTLA-4/tremelimumab Fab provided insight for the design of a
small-molecule modulator that interferes with the CTLA-4/B7
signal pathway. Nine of ten residues in the HCDR3 loop (residues
101–110 of the heavy chain) of tremelimumab are involved in the
interaction with CTLA-4 (Fig. 7a). In addition, the binding site of

 the HCDR3 loop overlaps part of the binding site of B7-1/2 on
the surface of CTLA-4 (Fig. 9a). Additionally, heavyR101 and
heavyY110 are located closely enough to be connected directly by a
peptide bond (Fig. 9b). This extensive interaction and the
structural
features
of
the
HCDR3
loop
in
the
CTLA-4/
tremelimumab complex suggest that cyclic peptides based on
the HCDR3 sequence may also prevent binding of B7-1/2 to
CTLA-4 (Fig. 9c). As the HCDR3 loop conformation in the
complex is essentially identical to that of tremelimumab Fab
alone, other CDRs and framework regions of tremelimumab
likely contribute to the conformation of HCDR3, implying that
antibody context is important for the proper display of the
tremelimumab HCDR3 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). If this is indeed
the case, a cyclic peptide approach would not be so promising
because of its intrinsic conformational flexibility. Nonetheless, a
cyclic peptide or peptidomimetic approach based on the HCDR3
sequence in combination with the power of phage-display library
technology
may
facilitate
the
discovery
of
small-molecule
modulators
of
the
CTLA-4/B7
interaction,
providing
an
alternative treatment strategy to overcome the drawbacks of
antibody–based drugs.
In summary, the elucidation of the crystal structures of the
checkpoint molecules PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in complex with
the Fab fragments of therapeutic antibodies sheds light on the
molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of
these monoclonal antibodies. In addition, the precise epitopes
revealed by the present complex structures should provide useful
information for the improvement of current therapeutic anti-
bodies and development of more effective immunotherapeutic
combination strategies and small-molecule modulators that can
attenuate checkpoint signalling.

OD600 reached 0.6–1.0, and the protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG
and incubated for 4 h at 37 �C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation,
re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl) and lysed by
sonication on ice. Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation (25,000g for
0.5 h at 4 �C) and solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl by
stirring overnight. After removing undissolved residue by centrifugation (25,000g
for 0.5 h at 4 �C), solubilized fraction was applied to HisTrap HP column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) and washed with five column volumes of wash buffer
(8 M urea, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole). The protein was
then eluted with elution buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl,
400 mM imidazole). The eluted protein was refolded by dialysis three times
against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and purified further by gel filtration
chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences). The protein purity was evaluated by reducing and nonreducing
SDS–PAGE.
Expression and purification of Fab fragments. The DNA sequences for the Fab
fragments of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, BMS-936559 and tremelimumab were
synthesized after codon-optimization for expression in E. coli (Bioneer, Inc). The
sequences for heavy chain and light chain were cloned into a modified pBAD
vector, containing the STII signal sequence in each chain for periplasmic secretion
and a C-terminal 6His-tag in heavy chain. The plasmid pBAD-Fab was trans-
formed into E. coli Top10F (Invitrogen). The cells were grown at 37 �C in LB
medium supplemented with 50 mg ml � 1 ampicillin. At an OD600 of 1.0, the protein
expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose and cells were grown at 30 �C for 15 h.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl) and lysed by sonication on ice. After removing cell
debris by centrifugation (25,000g for 0.5 h at 4 �C), the supernatant containing
soluble protein was applied to HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences)
and washed with five column volumes of wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole). The protein was then eluted with elution buffer
(20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole). The eluted protein was
concentrated for gel filtration chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex
200 pg column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The column had previously been
equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). The
elution profile of the protein showed a single major peak and the protein quality
was evaluated by reducing and nonreducing SDS–PAGE.

CTLA-4/tremelimumab through a peptide bond, and its structure was
polished by regularization and real space refinement in COOT (ref. 52). In
