The dark side of opioids in pain management:
basic science explains clinical observation
Cyril Rivata, Jane Ballantyneb,*
Abstract
Introduction: In the past 2 decades, opioids have been used increasingly for the treatment of persistent pain, and doses have
tended to creep up. As basic science elucidates mechanisms of pain and analgesia, the cross talk between central pain and opioid
actions becomes clearer.
Objectives: We aimed to examine the published literature on basic science explaining pronociceptive opioid actions, and apply
this knowledge to clinical observation.
Methods: We reviewed the existing literature on the pronociceptive actions of opioids, both preclinical and clinical
studies.
Results: Basic science provides a rationale for the clinical observation that opioids sometimes increase rather than decrease
pain. Central sensitization (hyperalgesia) underlies pain chronification, but can also be produced by high dose and high potency
opioids. Many of the same mechanisms account for both central pain and opioid hyperalgesia.
Conclusion: Newly revealed basic mechanisms suggest possible avenues for drug development and new drug therapies that
could alter pain sensitization through endogenous and exogenous opioid mechanisms. Recent changes in practice such as the
introduction of titration-to-effect for opioids have resulted in higher doses used in the clinic setting than ever seen previously. New
basic science knowledge hints that these newer dosing practices may need to be reexamined. When pain worsens in a patient
taking opioids, can we be assured that this is not because of the opioids, and can we alter this negative effect of opioids through
different dosing strategies or new drug intervention?

1. Introduction
Opioid drugs have been used for the relief of pain for millennia,
understanding that these drugs are also highly addictive. To the
limits of their availability, opioids were used therapeutically for
many centuries with little understanding of why this precious
extract from the opium poppy would have such profound effects
in humans. But in the 20th century, huge changes occurred both
in the clinical use of opioids and in the scientific understanding of
why opioids produce both pain and addiction. Parallel events
occurred. In part related to much greater availability of opium, its
derivatives and synthetics, opioids were administered more
widely and in markedly higher doses for the management of pain
than ever before. At the same time, mechanisms of pain
and analgesia, both opioid related and not, were appreciated at
an increasingly microscopic level, culminating in today’s un-
derstanding of the significant role of endogenous opioid systems
in pain and analgesia, and the part played by these systems in the
survival and evolutionary development of the species and even in
the polymorphisms that arise in individuals.20
Let us consider what happened clinically with opioids in the
twentieth century. The large swings in clinical opioid prescribing
that have occurred over the century because of fears of
unnecessary suffering due to underuse, pitched against fears of
unfettered addiction due to overuse, have been widely written
The Angelic face of Opium is dazzlingly seductive, but if you
look on the other side of it, it will appear altogether a Devil.
There is so much poison in this All-healing Medicine that we
ought not to be by any means secure or confident in the
frequent and familiar use of it.

 about and will not be belabored here. What is of greater relevance
in the context of the present article is the changes in clinical
practice that have led to people being exposed to high doses of
opioids given continuously over long periods of time. The
reformulation of opioids into long-acting preparations, the idea
of giving opioids round the clock, the titrate-to-effect principle
with open-ended dose escalation, and the breakthrough pain
concept have all contributed to this. This is in stark contrast to
prior usage where opioids were generally provided in what would
today be considered low doses, and were much more likely to be
given intermittently, as needed, rather than round the clock.
What has emerged from this clinical “experiment” is that higher
doses and more prolonged continuous use of opioids increase
the risk of adverse effects for individuals, including overdose and
death, falls and fractures, road traffic accidents, endocrinopa-
thies, chronic constipation, lack of disease resistance, neonatal
abstinence syndrome for offspring, and refractory tolerance when
treating acute or end of life pain.84,100 It also increases the risk of
adverse effects (including death) for society arising largely from
addiction on the part both of individuals being prescribed opioids
for pain, and those around them who obtain prescription opioids
through theft or diversion.77 But these now indisputable adverse
effects aside, we must ask whether the new principles of opioid
prescribing have actually improved analgesia, especially for those
seeking relief from chronic persistent pain. We have evidence
now that neuroadaptation interferes with opioids’ ability to
provide long-term analgesia,2,8,73 especially when opioids are
given continuously and may actually produce opposite effects ie,
increase existent pain or facilitate chronic pain develop-
ment.3,40,53,96,107 We have clinical evidence that dose reduction
or opioid discontinuation through tapering often improves
analgesia.11,15,47,55,104,112 We have early evidence that a large
proportion of those currently treated for long term with opioids are
not meeting treatment goals for either pain relief or function, and
that those taking low to moderate doses intermittently gain as
much as high dose users with less harm.27,34,38,106 These are all
clinical indicators that suggest that the new principles of opioid
prescribing – use round the clock, titration to effect, and the
concept of breakthrough – need to be reconsidered. And what
better way to start than with the science behind the adaptations
that seem to be interfering with opioids’ ability to provide effective
long-term analgesia?
2. Tolerance and hyperalgesia: neurobiological
adaptation to opioid analgesia
The use of potent analgesic opioids such as morphine is
motivated by their inhibitory effects on pain transmission. Opioid
receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) superfamily characterized by the presence of 7 trans-
membrane regions. Opioid receptors belong to the well-known
Gi/o class of GPCRs. It is commonly accepted that the main
inhibitory effects of opioid on pain transmission are due to the
stimulation of m-opioid receptor (MOP) resulting in an inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase and ion channels. When activated, MOP
produces hyperpolarization of neurons decreasing the trans-
mission of nociceptive information through the activation of
components of the mitogen activated proteins (MAP) kinase
cascade.116
Tolerance is characterized by a progressive lack of response to
morphine that can be overcome by increasing the dose, whereas
hyperalgesia is a sensitization process by which opioids,
paradoxically, cause pain hypersensitivity.56 Both mechanisms
lead to the decreased efficacy of opioid analgesic effects. These
adaptive phenomena have been studied for decades with notable
insights gained from experiments, usually pharmacological and
may be explained by 2 different biological processes.57 The
within-system adaptation process suggests that drug adminis-
tration elicits an opposing reaction within the same system in
which the drug elicits its primary action. Such an adaptive
response acts to progressively neutralize the drug’s effect and is
exemplified by mechanisms of opioid receptors desensitization
(see below) and is referred to as tolerance. The other conceptual
advance on decreased analgesic effects of opioids is the
relationship between the paradoxical pain hypersensitivity pro-
duced by acute or chronic opioid administration and the
development of resistance to analgesic effects. This has given
rise to the concept of between-system adaptations. To illustrate
this point, it has been reported in both laboratory and clinical
studies that repeated or acute opioid administration induces not
only analgesia, but also hyperalgesia.2,93 The development of
hyperalgesia has been evidenced after potent short-acting MOP
agonist such fentanyl,23 remifentanil,36 buprenorphine,113 but
also after potent long-acting MOP agonist such as mor-
phine.66,68,109 Interestingly the milder MOR agonist tramadol
has also been shown to produce pain hypersensitivity,61
suggesting that the adaptive response manifesting as hyper-
algesia seems to be a feature common to differing MOP agonists.
In animal studies, opioid-induced pain hypersensitivity can be
observed after high-doses and/or chronic opioid administration
but also after ultra-low doses (around 1–10 mg/kg in vivo)
revealing the excitatory properties of opioid receptor.30,31,41,97
This hyperalgesia is mediated by the activation of specific
pronociceptive processes23,39,49,68,78,108,109 which also lead to
an exaggeration of injury-induced hyperalgesia.17,43,62,87,89,90,92
Interestingly, experimental studies report that the prevention of
opioid-induced pain hypersensitivity is able to restore opioid
analgesic effects.87,108,119 Thus these observations strongly
support the fact that decreased analgesic effect is not due only to
an alteration at the opioid receptor level (tolerance) but could also be
associated with an activation of pronociceptive systems triggered by
the opioid that counteracts opioid analgesic effects.2,45,78,98 As
proposed by C´
el`
erier et al.21 in 1999, the net effects of opioids such
as morphine may be due in reality to the balance of the predominant
activation of pain inhibitory systems but these effects would be
partially unmasked by the concomitant activation of pain excitatory
systems. Many features of opioid-induced hyperalgesia can be
viewed in terms of adaptive response intended to normalize net
activity by engaging opposing or compensatory regulatory mech-
anisms or signaling pathways to reduce opioid responses. This
phenomenon refers to the opponent process theory.98,99 Consid-
ering the multiple cellular events involved in the adaptive response
produced by opioid exposure, it is important to note that most of
them are also common to those involved in the development and
maintenance of chronic pain. This suggests that pain vulnerability
may be facilitated in patients taking opioid medication and that
unfortunately opioid-induced pain vulnerability may persist even
after the opioid prescription has stopped. That means that opioid
may participate in the facilitation of the transition from acute to
chronic pain.
2.1. Mechanisms of tolerance and hyperalgesia induced
by opioids
As noted above, different concepts have been proposed to
explain the development to tolerance. First, with regards to the
within-system adaptation process, changes in numbers of
receptors, signaling proteins, and levels of opioid receptor
2

 phosphorylation are part of the alterations that reflect cellular
adaptive changes to opioid exposure. The MOP (and d Opioid
receptor [DOP]) activation initiates a cascade of events (phos-
phorylation, receptor endocytosis, intracellular sorting, and
recycling) leading to desensitization and resensitization which
are important regulatory processes that control signaling and
cellular response.51 In this process, receptor trafficking is an
important aspect of opioid regulation through the involvement of
dynamin and Beta-arrestin. Opioid receptor desensitization can
occur through phosphorylation by G-protein couple receptor
kinase and subsequent arrestin binding.5 Phosphorylation of
specific residues through increased activation of ERK1/2
(extracellular signal-regulated kinases), G-protein couple re-
ceptor kinases in the intracellular domains of MOP is widely
accepted to precede and perhaps cause desensitization. This
phenomenon has been described in a recent review and will not
be discussed here. In addition, desensitization of opioid receptors
occurs after interaction with other GPCRs called heterodimeriza-
tion46,54,80 or when a ligand binds to a specific GPCR, causing the
inactivation/desensitization of a different, unrelated, and unsti-
mulated GPCR through intracellular signaling. This process is
called heterologous desensitization.14,28,58,102,103
With regard to the mechanisms involved in opioid-induced
hyperalgesia ie, between system adaptation, several compre-
hensive reviews have summarized the cellular and molecular
changes that support opioid effects.2,78,93,98 Recent important
new findings provide additional evidence of opioid-induced pain
sensitization. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has long
been implicated in the development of both opioid analgesic
tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia,21,60,68,105 especially
through potentiation of presynaptic NMDA receptor.120 The
importance of NMDA neurotransmission in opioid-induced
tolerance and hyperalgesia has recently been emphasized by
new observations. A whole-genome haplotype-based computa-
tional genetic mapping designed to identify genes involved in
opioid-induced hyperalgesia was used.35 Mpdz gene was
identified as a candidate to explain differences among inbred
mouse strains in developing pain hypersensitivity after short-term
morphine exposure. The Mpdz gene and the associated
Multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1) have been shown to be
involved in NMDA-dependent synaptic functions. Specifically,
Multi-PDZ domain protein 1 associated with Ca21/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II and SynGAP constitutes a synaptic
complex that regulates p38 MAP kinase activity and NMDA
receptor-dependent synaptic a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid receptor potentiation.59 These data
support previous reports showing that the MOP agonist,
remifentanil produces long-term potentiation in dorsal spinal
cord after cessation of opioid administration.36 Altogether, this
suggests that opioids may facilitate “spinal pain memory” and
may facilitate long-lasting changes in pain processing pathways.
As well as the involvement of NMDA receptors in opioid-induced
hyperalgesia, spinal MAP kinase signaling pathway, including
extracellular
signal-regulated
kinase19,115
and
calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II26 have also been implicated in
mediating this phenomenon. MAP kinase has been shown to be
responsible for transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 over-
expression in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, and spinal cord
after repeated morphine administration.25,110 The blockade of
transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 or MAP kinase activation
Figure 1. General view of opioid-induced pain sensitization. Peripheral changes may occur in the primary afferent neurons through enhanced expression in
transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and activity of the protein kinase-A (PKA) and up-regulation of IL-1b in satellite cells that produce increased release, in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord, of excitatory peptides such substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and of glutamate. In addition, at the spinal
cord, a complex interplay between neurons and glial cells may occur. Neurons are sensitized by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent mechanisms
after opioid administration. Activated glial cells through direct (TLR4) and/or indirect action of opioid may produce the release of chemokines, cytokines, and Brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that sensitize neurons leading to overactivity of ascending pain pathways. Activation of descending facilitatory pain pathways
after opioid administration through the increase in cholecystokinin (CCK) into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), facilitate the release of excitatory peptide in
the spinal cord contributing to the maintenance of long-lasting pain sensitization after short-term opioid exposure.

 reduces analgesic tolerance and thermal pain hypersensitivity.
Additional signaling pathways have been implicated in opioid-
induced hyperalgesia. Recently, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein kinase mTOR
has been shown to be increased in dorsal horn neurons after
repeated intrathecal administrations of morphine. Mammalian
target of rapamycin contributes to the development of both
morphine tolerance and hyperalgesia through phosphoinositide
3-kinase/Akt pathway in dorsal horn neurons since blockade of
mTOR reduces those phenomena.119 Thus the spinal cord
appears central to various mechanisms and signaling pathways
supporting pain hypersensitivity observed after chronic opioid
administration (Fig. 1). However, the development of paradoxical
pain hypersensitivity after opioid administration has also been
related to activation of the descending nociceptive pathways
originating from the rostral ventromedial medulla109 through
enhanced endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) activity118 which,
in turn, may promote the upregulation of spinal dynorphin and
enhances primary afferent neurotransmitter release (such as
calcitonin gene-related peptide42; Fig. 1). Interestingly, spinal
dynorphin has been shown to be regulated by epigenetic
mechanisms during morphine exposure.64,65 Indeed, it has been
shown that escalating doses of subcutaneous morphine induce
enhanced expression of aceH3K9 in dorsal spinal cord64
regulating the expression of Pro-dynorphin and BDNF (Brain-
derived neurotrophic factor), as well. Moreover, repeated in-
traperitoneal Histone acetyltransferase inhibitor injections re-
duced both morphine tolerance and pain hypersensitivity,
whereas histone deacetylase inhibitor injection produced the
opposite effects ie, prolongation of morphine hyperalgesia and
tolerance. Whether epigenetic alterations are induced after acute
opioid administration remains to be determined, especially in the
context of tissue injury, but these data strongly support long-term
neuronal changes caused by opioid exposure.
2.2. Opioid-induced neuroinflammatory-like state
Abundant evidence suggests that opioid can also produce
neuroinflammatory responses in both peripheral and central
nervous systems. Microglia-to-neuron signaling is known to play
a key role in opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia. The
implication of microglial cells in pain sensitization is quite
complex. Glia cells have been shown to contribute to opioid-
induced hyperalgesia through the release of proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines.72,81,82,117 To support the inflamma-
tory process activated after opioid administration, administration
of glial metabolic inhibitors, receptor antagonists or cytokine
inhibitors, attenuate the development of morphine tolerance. For
instance, interleukin-1 (IL-1)b is increased after chronic in-
trathecal morphine administration and the blockade of spinal IL-
1b receptor is effective in reducing both the development of
tolerance to morphine analgesia and hyperalgesia and allodynia
observed after repeated morphine administration.52 At the
cellular level, acute as well as chronic morphine administration
produces enhanced protein expression of IL-1b from satellite
cells in the dorsal root ganglia through MMP9 activation.12,76
Further investigations have recently been conducted to elucidate
the role of opioid-induced glial activation in the modulation of
opioid effects. Microglia through P2X4 stimulation has been more
specifically involved in morphine-induced hyperalgesia39 rather
than tolerance suggesting distinct mechanisms between these 2
phenomena. Although, tolerance and hyperalgesia may share
some
common
mechanisms,56,86
additional
investigations
should be conducted in the future to confirm the data obtained
by Ferrini et al. In addition, it has been shown that the microglia-
specific subtype of Ca21-activated K1 (BK) channel is re-
sponsible for generation of morphine-induced hyperalgesia and
tolerance to its analgesic effect.44 Of note, opposition of
analgesia by proinflammatory cytokines is rapid, occurring 65
minutes after intrathecal opioid administration suggesting non-
classic opioid actions on the production of proinflammatory
cytokine.52 Actually, opioid ligands such as morphine have been
shown to directly bind the microglial activate marker, innate
immune receptor toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in decreased
morphine antinoception and hyperalgesia. Such effects have
been reported in both the spinal cord50 and the periaqueductal
gray (PAG).37 Stimulation of TLR4 by opioid activates ceramide
metabolic pathway in spinal glial cells. That would lead to the
activation of the sphingosine 1 phosphate kinase responsible of
enhanced production of TNFa, IL1-b and IL-675 and may
represent one of the mechanisms by which opioids induce
a rapid cytokine overexpression. One of the most prominently
reported cascades activated by opioid exposure is the MAP
kinase pathway which a collection of serine/threonine-specific
protein kinases. Three key kinases of this response system are
p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-
regulated kinase, the phosphorylation of which results in an active
functional signaling complex. For instance, morphine produces
phosphorylation of p38 within microglia.32,48,115 Altogether, the
contribution of proinflammatory cytokines in pain hypersensitivity
suggests a participation of these molecules as antiopioid system
that counteract opioid analgesia. These observations point out
the implication of cytokines as heterologous system in the
modulation of opioid analgesia, in agreement with the within
system adaptation process theory. Of note, spinal astrocytes
have also been implicated in the development of opioid-induced
hyperalgesia13,97 through the involvement of the c-Jun N-
terminal kinase pathway and IL-1b. Altogether this observation
strongly provides favor for gliosis activation after short-term
opioid exposure.
Recent advances demonstrate the importance of chemokines
in the modulation of opioid analgesic effects. Chemokines
constitute a family of small secreted proteins which were initially
described as chemoattractive molecules for lymphocytes.71
However, in addition to their classical role in the immune/
inflammatory reaction, some chemokines are also detected in
resting conditions by neurons and glial cells producing a glio- and
neuromodulatory activities.18,94 Chemokines are also modulated
by morphine exposure within the central nervous system. As the
cytokines, chemokines are known to play a critical role in
functional adaptation after opioid exposure. This statement
emerges from different observations. Works by Watkins’ team
firstly demonstrated that the chemokine CX3CR1/fractalkine
oppose
morphine
analgesia.52
CX3CR1/fractalkine-induced
modulation of morphine analgesia takes place also in the
PAG.24 One of these chemokines, stromal derived factor 1
(SDF-1), also called CXCL12 is a member of the CXC family of
chemokines and it binds to 2 receptors: the G-protein coupled
transmembrane (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), (also identified
as a coreceptor for the T cell tropic human immunodeficiency
virus-1) and the CXCR7 receptor.6 Heterologous desensitization
of MOP and DOP has been documented after stimulation of
CXCR4.81,82,101 For instance, CXCR4 receptor activation in the
PAG, by prior local treatment with CXCL12 markedly reduced the
antinociceptive effects of opioid agonists injected in the same
site.101 The CXCL12/CXCR4 system has also been implicated in
chronic morphine administration-induced tactile hypersensitiv-
ity.117 The participation of spinal CXCL12/CXCR4 system in
4
C. Rivat, J. Ballantyne·1 (2016) e570

 morphine tolerance has also been evidenced. Intrathecal in-
jection of CXCL12 reduced morphine analgesic effects.91
Altogether, this suggests that the spinal chemokine CXCL12
may contribute to the development of opioid tolerance through
within and between adaptations.72
3. Pain chronicization produced by opioid: concept of
latent pain sensitization
3.1. Unmasking opioid-induced persistent pain sensitization
Several recent bodies of evidence suggest that opioid exposure
can induce relatively long-term activation of pronociceptive
systems leading to pain chronicization. First, it has been observed
that after hindpaw inflammation, animals develop an enhanced
hyperalgesic response to a second induction of inflammation 7
days later.89,90 This enhanced response is exaggerated when
fentanyl is administered during the first episode of tissue
inflammation suggesting that both painful inflammation and
opioids can facilitate pain sensitization, making animals vulner-
able to future pain for at least one week. Similar effects were
observed in an animal model of postoperative pain.16 Second, in
a different, but very interesting, experimental paradigm, nocicep-
tive hypersensitivity progressively disappeared over 12 days after
cessation of repeated opioid administration.22 However, admin-
istration of naloxone induced a dramatic decrease in the
nociceptive threshold (precipitated hyperalgesia) when adminis-
tered 8 weeks after opioid administration. Importantly, naloxone-
precipitated hyperalgesia was not observed in opioid-naive rats.
This suggests that after opioid exposure, animals develop an
activation of pronociceptive systems that persists for at least 8
weeks after opioid exposure although this enhanced pronoci-
ceptive becomes masked by endogenous opioid-mediated
antinociceptive systems in just few days. Hyperalgesia may then
be evident when these endogenous opioid-mediated antinoci-
ceptive systems are inhibited by naloxone. Taken together all
these results suggest that the resolution of opioid-induced
hyperalgesia is not due to a rapid extinction of pronociceptive
systems, leading to a return to normal nociceptive responding
(homeostatic state) but is rather due to a counter-adaptation by
inhibitory systems dependent on endogenous opioid release.22
This phenomenon leads to the establishment of a new state,
which has been referred to as allostasis (meaning “maintaining
stability [or homeostasis] through change”69,70 and which
depends on a high-level balance between these 2 opposing
nociceptive-related systems, Fig. 2). It has been proposed that
this allostatic state may be a state of pain vulnerability. To illustrate
this state of pain vulnerability, it has been shown that the
administration of a small dose of heroin (0.2 mg/kg), ineffective in
inducing hyperalgesia in normal rats, triggered substantial long-
lasting hyperalgesia when given several days after prior opioid
exposure.22 Similar effects were obtained when spinal applica-
tions of low dose BDNF or dynorphin were applied after opioid-
induced hyperalgesia resolved65 suggesting that opioids produce
a general state of pain sensitization. Moreover, stress, which is
well known to induce analgesia in normal rats1,79 produces
hyperalgesia in rats previously treated with opioids.88 Since such
stress-induced hyperalgesia was observed in animals that
were returned to basal pain sensitivity; this phenomenon has
been named “latent pain sensitization.” Importantly, such
a phenomenon can be observed up to 119 days after opioid/
injury exposure.88 Opioid-induced long-term pain vulnerability
may increase pain response after various tissue injuries such as
pancreatic
inflammation,63
hindpaw
inflammation,60
inci-
sion,16,62 or nerve injury.67 Importantly, the development of latent
pain sensitization has recently been reported in a preliminary
human volunteer study. The administration of 2 mg/kg naloxone
produced a decreased pain threshold 7 days after a mild heat
Figure 2. Hypothesis on the transition from acute to chronic facilitate by opioid administration. Acute tissue or nerve injury produces an increased activity in pain
facilitatory systems that can be exaggerated by treatment with high doses of opioid. After remission and cessation of opioid administration, increased endogenous
pain inhibition through opioid and a2A adrenergic receptors constitutive activity suppress sustained hyperalgesia that may depend on epigenetic alterations at
BDNF and proDyn gene expression, protein kinase-A in primary afferent neurons and increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b. This results in
the development of latent pain sensitization that may be associated with long-term pain vulnerability that could facilitate the development of chronic pain.

 injury as revealed by heat pain threshold and secondary hyper-
algesia.83 Naloxone response seems to be heterogeneous
between human volunteers suggesting interindividual variation
in the development of latent pain sensitization. To challenge this
observation, this clinical paradigm should be further tested. It
would be of interest to identify markers of vulnerability to chronic
pain to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain,
especially in the context of postoperative pain. Altogether, these
observations suggest that opioid exposure may sensitize
individuals to subsequent different painful and nonpainful stimuli
making opioid a critical factor in the transition from acute to
chronic pain as evidenced after surgery.96,107 This observation
raised important questions about the neurobiological support of
opioid-induced long-lasting neuroplasticity.
3.2. Long-term adaptive changes induced by
opioid exposure
With regard to the mechanisms supporting opioid-induced long-
term pain sensitization, some reports have recently been
published and deserve some attention. First, it seems that
opioid-induced pronociceptive activity may persist long after
cessation of opioid administration. For instance, Loram et al.67
showed that 2 days after cessation of opioid exposure,
enhancement of IL-1b mRNA can be observed in the spinal cord
and trigeminal nucleus caudalis suggesting that sustained
inflammatory mechanisms may be responsible for opioid-
induced pain chronicization. This observation has to be related
to a recent report showing that short-term opioid exposure (5
days) prolongs nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity for
several weeks.43 This observation is consistent with the idea that
opioid produces long-term alterations in pain sensitization
process that facilitates the initiation and/or the maintenance of
chronic pain state. The main mechanism supporting such
a phenomenon seems to be independent of opioid receptor,
involving the NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, a protein
complex that activates toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), P2X7
receptor, caspase-1, or IL-1b in dorsal spinal microglial.43
Actually, these data support the critical role of microglia not only
in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance but also in long-
term pain sensitization observed after brief exposure to opioid.
Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain opioid-
induced persistent pain sensitization. As mentioned above,
opioids may trigger epigenetic mechanisms that produce hyper-
algesia and tolerance. Since epigenetics include processes that
control long-term gene expression, one may speculate that
opioid-induced latent pain sensitization may be supported by
histone modifications, DNA methylation and/or miRNA synthesis.
Along these lines, it has been reported that histone acetylation
may drive exaggerated incision-induced pain hypersensitivity
after morphine exposure through changes in BDNF and pro-
dynorphin gene expression in the spinal cord.95 These epigenetic
mechanisms may have particular interest to partially explain the
latent pain sensitization produced by opioid through long lasting
alterations in neuronal functioning after opioid exposure. Finally,
repeated stimulations of MOP produce long-term sensitization of
nociceptors through specific mechanisms different to those
produced by inflammatory stimulus.4 Indeed, specific signaling
pathways involving protein kinase-A has been shown to support
long-lasting hyperalgesia after prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) injection
in DAMGO-pretreated animals. This report demonstrates a novel
form of hyperalgesic priming that may facilitate the transition from
acute to chronic pain. This suggests that opioid may act also at
primary afferent nociceptors inducing a priming effect that
sensitizes animals to subsequent painful stimulus. Finally, the
concept of latent of pain sensitization has also been investigated
after inflammatory pain. It has been recently shown that adenylate
cyclase 1 and MOP, DOP, kappa-opioid receptor, and a2A
adrenergic Receptors constitutive activity are implicated in the
sustained suppression of pain hypersensitivity after acute in-
flammation.29,114 The question remains regarding the specific
implication of those cellular mechanisms in latent pain sensitiza-
tion induced by opioid exposure. A better characterization of the
neurobiological markers of opioid-induced latent pain sensitiza-
tion should be considered in the future to improve the use of
opioids for the management of pain including limiting the risk of
pain chronification (Fig. 2).
4. Clinical implications of opioid-induced
neuroadaptations
The changes in opioid prescribing that occurred over the past few
decades occurred not because of our greater understanding of
basic mechanisms of pain and analgesia, but despite it. The
changes in opioid prescribing began in the 1980s when palliative
care specialists approached the pharmaceutical industry and
asked them to reformulate morphine to become long-acting so
that cancer patients would have better pain control with fewer
peaks and troughs in their analgesic levels. The reformulation of
several other opioids rapidly followed. Palliative care specialists
also promoted the idea that opioids should be given at regular
intervals rather than on demand, escalating dose with the aim of
relieving as much pain as possible.111 The titrate-to-effect
principle whereby opioid doses would be increased to counteract
not only increases in pain, but also increases in tolerance, was
born. One more change is relevant, and that is the introduction of
the concept of breakthrough pain.74,84 When it became clear that
there is no ideal dose of long-acting opioid that covers all
eventualities and compensates for the changes in pain level that
occur with changes in emotional and physical factors, it was
proposed that short-acting opioids should be given in addition to
long-acting, and given when pain emerges through the base
analgesic regimen. Before the advent of long-acting opioids,
there was no need for a breakthrough pain concept, because the
standard way of prescribing was as needed. The principles
promoted by palliative care specialists were soon extended to the
treatment of chronic pain. Suddenly a much wider population was
being treated with opioids and for much longer. And in line with
the palliative care specialists’ advancement of the titrate-to-effect
principle and the breakthrough pain concept, doses used were
higher than ever previously seen.7,10,100
Although mechanisms of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia
had begun to be elucidated in the laboratory as early as the
1980s, clinicians did not know quite what to make of it. After all,
opioids had been successfully used for the treatment of pain for
millennia: it must be that opioids’ antinociceptive effects generally
override their pronociceptive effects, and that tolerance can be
overcome by dose escalation. And initially, the use round-the-
clock, titrate-to-effect, and breakthrough pain concepts seemed
to be the answer. That is until the 1990s, when in the clinical
space, we began to see that under some circumstances, opioids
seemed to be making pain worse rather than better.9 This was
particularly true when opioids were used either at high doses or
with high potency. Lured by the fact that each dose escalation
seemed capable of restoring analgesia, dosing went up and up,
and the fear that such dosing might actually be worsening pain, or
producing adaptations that compromise opioids’ ability to
provide pain relief, went largely unheeded.

 Recent progress in the laboratory has brought us to the point
where the pronociceptive effects of opioids and their clinical
importance cannot be denied. These can no longer be seen as
changes that will reverse as soon as opioid treatment is stopped:
animal and some human studies suggest that many of the changes
have prolonged effects. Common mechanisms contribute to
opioid induced hyperalgesia and pain chronification, such as
NMDA receptor activation,33,53,85 meaning that it is not always
possible to determine whether an increase in pain should be
attributed to pain itself or could result from continued administra-
tion of opioid. Or indeed, whether discontinuation of opioid therapy
will improve pain or affect any sort of rescue in terms of reversing
the changes. Whether through cellular processes such as receptor
trafficking, intracellular signaling, NMDA neurotransmission or
epigenetic changes, opioid-induced neuroinflammation or latent
pain sensitization, opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia must
be seen as potentially irreversible phenomena that should force
a reexamination of current opioid dosing practices. At the very
least, we know that the newer prescribing tenets have tended to
drive higher dose usage, which the science now reveals changes in
pain processing that can compromise opioids’ ability to provide
sustained pain relief, and may even worsen underlying pain and/or
facilitate the development of chronic pain.
The new understanding of opioid mechanisms afforded by
basic science could lead to the development of novel drug
therapies that by targeting epigenetic changes, cellular pro-
cesses, neuroinflammation and other opioid-induced adapta-
tions, could help reduce pain chronification, reduce tolerance to
opioid analgesics, or both. Well-designed clinical studies will be
needed to clearly define opioid-induced hyperalgesia and
tolerance in humans, and to fully understand the role of dose
and dosing strategies in producing the undesirable neuro-
adaptations that interfere with opioids’ ability to offer sustained
analgesia. However, what the basic science already does is force
us to question whether newer practices such as continuous use
and open ended dose escalation, could sometimes be making
pain worse rather than better.
