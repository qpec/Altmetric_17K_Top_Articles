Background: The Black–White health paradox can be defined as lower frequency of 
depression despite higher prevalence of economic and social adversities as well as chronic 
medical conditions (CMC) among American Blacks compared to American Whites. Based 
on this paradox, the CMC – depressive symptoms link is expected to be weaker among 
Blacks than Whites. We conducted a 10-year longitudinal study to compare Blacks and 
Whites for bidirectional associations between number of CMC and negative affect over time.
Methods: We used data from the MIDUS (Midlife in the United States), a nationally repre-
sentative longitudinal study of American adults. A total number of 7,108 individuals with an 
age range of 25–75 years (N = 7,108) were followed for 10 years from 1995 to 2004. Age, 
gender, and socioeconomic status (education and income) were measured at baseline. 
Negative affect and CMC were measured at baseline (1995) and end of follow up (2004). 
Race was the moderator. Linear regression was used to test the moderating effect of 
race on the reciprocal associations between CMC and negative affect, net of covariates.
results: In the pooled sample, while baseline CMC was predictive of an increase in nega-
tive affect over time, baseline negative affect was also predictive of an increase in CMC. We 
found interactions between race and baseline CMC on change in depressive symptoms, 
as well as race with negative affect on CMC change, suggesting that the associations 
between CMC and negative affect are stronger for Whites in comparison to Blacks.
conclusion: Blacks and Whites differ in reciprocal links between CMC and negative 
affect over time. This finding replicates recent studies on differential links between 
psychosocial factors and physical health based on race. Findings may help us better 
understand how Black-White health paradox develops across mid and later life.

Chronic medical conditions (CMC) are more prevalent among Blacks than Whites (1, 2). Emotional 
problems such as depression are, however, less common among Blacks (3–5). As a result, a larger 
discrepancy exists between CMC and depression among Blacks (6, 7). Disproportionately lower 
prevalence of depression despite higher levels of social and economic adversities as well as CMC 
among Blacks, compared to Whites, is also known as the Black–White health paradox (5, 6). Studies 
that have found weaker associations between CMC and depression among Blacks (8–11) have lent 
empirical support to the Black–White health paradox. Not all studies, however, have found such 
group differences (11–14).

As most prior studies in this area have used a cross-sectional 
design (9–14), there is still a need for additional longitudinal 
research (7). In 2015, Assari and colleagues applied multi-group 
structural equation modeling to data from the Americans’ 
Changing Lives (ACL) study and showed that among White but 
not Black respondents, higher CMC at baseline predicted an 
increase in depressive symptoms over a 25-year follow up period. 
Among Whites but not Blacks, depressive symptoms at baseline 
were predictive of incident CMC over time, as well (7). In another 
attempt, Assari and colleagues used multi-group cross-lagged 
modeling and documented race by gender group differences in 
the lagged effects of depressive symptoms and restless sleep on 
change in CMC over time. While White men, White women, 
and Black women were similar in the residual effect of restless 
sleep over depressive symptoms on CMC, such effect was missing 
among Black men (15).
These studies all suggest that contextual factors such as race 
and ethnicity should be conceptualized as moderators that may 
alter the reciprocal associations between CMC and depression 
(16–18). Also called as the differential effect hypothesis, this 
approach focuses on the contextual (moderating) effects of race 
and ethnicity, rather than their main (direct) effects. In this view, 
populations differ for associations that ultimately influence health 
and illness (16–18).
Despite our knowledge of the bidirectional nature of the rela-
tionship between depression and CMC, existing information is 
still limited on potential population differences in the reciprocal 
relationships between CMC and negative affect over time. Built 
on the existing literature (7, 11, 12, 19–22), we compared Blacks 
and Whites for the reciprocal associations between CMC and 
negative affect over a 10-year period.

Design and setting
Data came from the MIDUS, 1995–2004. The MIDUS is a nation-
ally representative longitudinal cohort study of 7,000 + adult 
Americans aged 25–74. The study is carried out by the MacArthur 
Midlife Research Network. The main purpose of the study was to 
investigate the role of psychosocial factors in understanding age 
variation in physical and mental health (23–26).
ethics
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, UCLA, and Georgetown 
University. Informed written consent was obtained for all partici-
pants. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging. 
Monetary incentives were offered at both wave 1 and 2 to com-
pensate for potential respondent burden (US$20 for completion 
of MIDUS 1 surveys and up to US$60 for completion of MIDUS 
2 surveys).
Process
The survey was multimodal, composed of phone interviews 
and self-report questionnaires. First, the study employed 
an initial 30-min phone or face-to-face interview followed 
by a set (two) of self-administered questionnaires (SAQs). 
Questionnaires were mailed to individuals after completing 
the phone interview.
Data collection of the wave 1 was conducted in 1995 and 
1996. Data collection of the wave 2 of the MIDUS was con-
ducted in 2004 and 2005. The time-2 data collection used the 
original protocol (wave 1). All participants received letters as 
a reminder that an interviewer would contact them for a tel-
ephone survey in few weeks. Following completion of a phone 
interview that lasted 30-mins on average, participants received 
two SAQs via mail.
Participants and sampling
The study used random digit dialing (RDD) to enroll participants. 
RDD is a widely accepted method for recruiting people to tel-
ephone statistical surveys. RDD generates telephone numbers at 
random, thus MIDUS enrolled a random sample of adults. The 
study used telephone numbers within the continental United 
States as the sampling frame for the national RDD survey. The 
study also used an oversampling in five cities. This stage resulted 
in 4,244 individuals enrolled via RDD sampling. By randomly 
selecting 529 cases from the RDD sample who had at least one 
sibling, a sibling sample was generated. Siblings were limited to 
those within a family that had the same biological mother and 
father. Using this strategy, the study enrolled 950 siblings. The 
study also used a two-part sampling design to enroll the twin 
sample [957 twin pairs (n = 1,914)].
Follow-up Data
From the total 7,108 participants who started the study (complet-
ing the phone survey at MIDUS 1), data were collected at wave 
2 for 4,963 (70%) at MIDUS 2, which was 9–10 years later. Thus 
the MIDUS overall retention rate is 75% (adjusted for mortality). 
The retention rate was higher for siblings (81%) and twins (81%) 
compared to the RDD sample (69%). Major causes for non-
participation at MIDUS 2 included refusal (12%), could not be 
contacted (10%), and too ill to be interviewed (8%) or deceased 
(verified by the National Death Index).
Measures
We collected data on core demographic variables and socioeco-
nomic factors at baseline. Depressive symptoms and CMC were 
measured at waves 1 and 2.
Socioeconomic Factors
Demographic variables were collected at baseline in 1995 and 
included age (continuous), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), and 
race (0 = Whites, 1 = Blacks). Socioeconomic variables included 
educational attainment (treated as a continuous measure; 1 = less 
than high school, 2 = high school graduate or equivalent, 3 = some 
college, 4 = college graduate or more) and personal income (con-
tinuous measure).
Chronic Medical Conditions
Data were collected at wave 1 and 2 on history of 20 CMC. 
Examples of conditions are cancer, heart disease, diabetes (high 
blood sugar), asthma, bronchitis or emphysema, ulcer, migraine, 
and thyroid disease (27, 28).

Negative Affect
State negative affect (SNA) was assessed using a 6-item ques-
tionnaire that asked participants how much of the time over 
the past 30 days did they feel: “so sad,” “nervous,” “restless or 
fidgety,” “hopeless,” “worthless,” and “everything was an effort.” 
Participants rated their response on a 5-point scale from 1 (none 
of the time) to 5 (all of the time). We calculated a mean score, 
which could range from 1 to 5, with higher score indicating 
more negative affect. In this measure, SNA is conceptualized as 
symptoms of depression and anxiety, two emotions commonly 
used to define negative affect (29–31). The scale was similar to 
K-6 developed by Kessler and colleagues, which has yielded a 
single factor structure representing current, general psycho-
logical distress (32). Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.75 to 
0.85 across the eight administrations of this scale (33). Internal 
consistency (reliability) was excellent (α = 0.86 for Whites and 
0.87 for Blacks).
statistical note
Data analysis was conducted in SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM 
Inc. Armonk, NY, USA). We ran multiple linear regressions in 
the pooled sample as well as based on race, with and without 
interaction. In the first step, CMC was the independent variable, 
and negative affect was the dependent variables. Then in the sec-
ond step, negative affect was the independent variable, and CMC 
was the dependent variable. Race was the focal moderator. Age, 
gender, education, and income were covariates. Regression coef-
ficients (b), SE with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were reported.
resUlTs
Table 1 presents the results of descriptive analysis in the pooled 
sample and based on race. Compared to Whites, Blacks were 
younger, were more frequently women, and had lower education 
and income. Blacks had higher CMC at wave 1 and 2 compared to 
Whites. Blacks also had higher negative affect at wave 2.
Table 2 summarizes two regression models in the pooled 
sample with CMC as the predictor and depressive symptoms as 
the outcome. According to Model 1, which did not include the 
interaction term, baseline CMC predicted change in negative 
affect, net of socioeconomic factors. Model 2 also included an 
interaction between race and CMC showed a significant and 
negative interaction between Black race and baseline CMC on 
change in negative affect, suggesting that the association between

baseline CMC and subsequent change in negative affect is stronger 
for Whites in comparison to Blacks.
Table 3 provides a summary of two regression models in the 
pooled sample with negative affect at wave 1 as the predictor and 
CMC at wave 2 as the outcome. According to our Model 1 which 
did not include the interaction term, baseline negative affect 
was predictive of change in CMC, net of socioeconomic factors. 
Based on Model 2, there was a significant interaction between 
race and baseline negative affect on CMC at wave 2, suggesting 
that race alters the effect of baseline negative affect and change 
in CMC.
Table 4 presents the results of regression models with CMC at 
wave 1 as the independent variable and negative affect at wave 2 
as the outcome across race groups. Only among Whites (Model 1) 
but not Blacks (Model 2), baseline CMC predicted a change in 
negative affect over time, net of socioeconomic factors.
Table 5 summarizes the results of race-specific regression 
models with negative affect at wave 1 as the predictor and CMC at 
wave 2 as the outcome. Among Whites (Model 1), baseline nega-
tive affect predicted CMC change over time, net of demographic 
and socioeconomic factors. The same association could not be 
found for Blacks (Model 2).

DiscUssiOn
According to our findings, Whites and Blacks differ in reciprocal 
and longitudinal associations between CMC and negative affect 
over a 10-year period. Thus, race alters the inter-relation between 
baseline and change of CMC and negative affect in the United 
States.
In our study, baseline CMC predicted change in negative 
 
affect among Whites but not Blacks. Similarly, baseline negative 
affect predicted change in CMC among Whites but not Blacks. 
These findings replicate a previous report by Assari et al., using 
25-year follow-up data (7). This replication is important as Assari 
et al. mentioned: “… the duration of follow up was 25 years, which 
may have caused selective deaths in the population, particularly 
among Blacks and those with high baseline chronic medical 
conditions. Future reports may consider replication of the current 
findings using shorter follow-up periods.
” (7). These studies provide 
longitudinal support for the Black–White health paradox (6, 7, 
22, 34, 35), defined as lower prevalence of depression or depres-
sive symptoms (4) despite higher prevalence of CMC and other 
social and economic adversities (1, 2).
Capistrant and colleagues have shown that the link between 
baseline depressive symptoms and subsequent mortality due to 
cardiovascular causes was significant for Whites but not Blacks, 
after adjusting for potential confounders (36). There are other 
studies that have documented racial differences in depression 
associated with specific CMC types (20, 21, 37). For instance, 
Lewis and colleagues found evidence suggesting that depressive 
symptoms may have different effect on cardiovascular risk for 
Blacks and Whites (8, 38).
There are multiple explanations for Black–White differences 
in the link between depression and CMC. Jackson and colleagues 
have attributed these findings to racial differences in engagement 
in a number of unhealthy behaviors such as smoking or overeat-
ing that help Blacks cope with psychological distress but impose 
physiological damages at the same time (37, 39). Such ineffective 
coping behaviors may increase the physical toll associated with 
stress and distress among Blacks (19, 37, 39–41).
Literature has also provided results that are either inconsistent 
(11, 12, 37) or unexpected (10, 11, 42). As compared to Whites, 
Blacks have more CMC but less depression, we intuitively expect 
weaker depressive symptoms – CMC link for Blacks. That is, any 
incremental increase in CMC is expected to have a smaller effect 
on depressive symptoms among Blacks compared to Whites. 
Hankerson and colleagues, however, documented a stronger 
association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and 
hypertension, obesity, and liver disease among Blacks compared 
to Whites (42), and Assari found cross-sectional positive asso-
ciation between MDD and cardiovascular diseases among Blacks 
that could not be replicated for Whites (10). Further, using the 
National Survey of American Life (NSAL) data, Watkins, Assari, 
and Johnson-Lawrence showed that lifetime MDD was associ-
ated with at least one CMC among Blacks, but not Whites (12). 
A few existing studies have failed to show any moderating effect 
of race on the association between CMC and depression (11, 14). 
As several of the above findings contradict the expected stronger 
association between depression and CMC among Whites than 
Blacks, we still need more research that explores racial variations 
in the cross-sectional and longitudinal links between CMC and 
depression.
Previous research has shown that the link between depres-
sion and CMC is bidirectional (43–49). While baseline CMC 
predicts subsequent depression (43–47), baseline depression 
also increases risk of CMC in the future (48, 49). However, this 
literature has mainly enrolled White middle class individuals (43, 
47–49) and more is yet to be known on population variations in 
these associations (50).
Depression is known to be more chronic and disabling for 
Blacks in comparison to Whites (10, 12). Among those with 
lifetime MDD, frequency of 12-month MDD is higher for Blacks 
(56%) than Whites (39%) (4). Higher chronicity of depression 
for Blacks (4, 10, 12) may be in part due to low access and trust 
to the health care system as well as high stigma for Blacks than 
Whites (4, 10, 12). Negative beliefs regarding pharmaceutical 
treatment (4), preference of non-pharmacologic approaches (e.g., 
counseling and prayer) (51), and the belief that antidepressants 
are addictive (51) may also operate as barriers against depression 
treatment among Blacks. Higher comorbidity of CMC among 
Blacks with depression also adds to the complexity of diagnosis 
of depression among Blacks (1, 2, 52, 53). Differential presenta-
tion of depression (more somatic among Blacks) may also be 
another barrier for diagnosis (54). Given the worse trajectory of 
depression among Blacks, one would expect stronger effects of 
depression and negative emotions on CMC for Blacks (7).
Improving screening, diagnoses, and treatment of emotional 
problems such as depression among Blacks require major invest-
ment (4, 55, 56). Still, the primary care setting should be regarded 
as a unique opportunity for depression screening among Blacks 
who receive care for their medical conditions (57–59). However, 
quality improvement programs should also enhance quality of 
psychiatric services in primary care settings, particularly for 
Blacks (12, 60).
This study contributes to a growing literature that has docu-
mented Black–White differences in how psychological factors 
contribute to a wide range of physical health outcomes including 
but not limited to CMC and mortality (7, 61, 62). Lucas and 
colleagues have shown that psychological as well as biological 
processes that contribute to cardiovascular health disparities are 
not simply the consequence of individual level exposures but the 
interplay between individual-level and contextual factors (e.g., 
views about justice) (63). Mezuk et al. have suggested that behav-
iors may explain why the links between emotional and physical 
health problems are weaker among Blacks (41). Keyes et al. have 
attributed such differences to flourishing of Blacks in the face of 
social inequality and discrimination (5, 6). Kitayama et al. have 
attributed these findings to cultural differences in tolerance and 
affordance of emotional dysregulation (64–66). Other research-
ers have attributed these group differences to stereotypes and 
schemas such as strong Black Woman ideology (67–69). Such dif-
ferential effects are not specific to depression and negative affect 
(16) and have been seen for self-rated health as well (17). These 
findings are also consistent with findings by Stewart and col-
leagues that suggest depressive symptoms predict inflammatory 
markers among Whites but not Blacks (70–72). Boyle, Williams,

and others have also shown Black–White differences in the link 
between psychological and biological markers of serotonin with 
insulin sensitivity (73–76).
The results reported here should be interpreted with the fol-
lowing limitations in mind. First, this study measured number of 
CMC, regardless of their type. Second, CMC measurement was 
based on self-reported data. As race may alter associations between 
depression and particular types of CMC (8, 9, 14, 20, 21, 37, 38, 
43), there is a need to determine CMC types that may differently 
correlate with depression and negative emotions based on race. 
Third, this study measured negative affect, not clinical depression. 
Some studies have suggested that clinical diagnosis of depression 
is differently associated with CMC than depressive symptoms (8, 
9, 14, 20, 21, 37, 38, 43). Negative emotions may also differently 
predict MDD across racial groups (70). The study did not control 
for access to health care, insurance, and function, as well as behav-
iors that may influence CMC, depression, or both. Forth, Whites 
were over-represented in the sample. Despite these limitations, this 
study still makes a unique contribution to the literature as only a 
handful of studies have compared Blacks and Whites for reciprocal 
associations between affect and CMC over time (7).
Our findings advocate for designing and implementing tai-
lored rather than universal programs that screen for combined 
physical and emotional health problems at the community as well 
as in primary health-care settings. As racial groups differ in how 
physical and mental health problems co-exist and develop, race 
should be in the center of comprehensive protocols that focus 
simultaneously on multiple health aspects of diverse popula-
tions. Race groups with similar level of CMC may have different 
emotional needs. Integrative care may particularly benefit from 
adjustment to culture, race, and ethnicity (77). Findings may 
also have implications for the health-care reform, also known as 
Obama care (78).
In summary, we found racial differences in reciprocal asso-
ciations between CMC and negative affect over a 10-year period. 
Comorbidity between physical and emotional health problems 
is not independent of context, and the inter-relations between 
the trajectories of these health problems may be context specific.
