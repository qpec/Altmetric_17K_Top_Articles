Summary
Background Large-scale and contemporary population-based studies of heart failure incidence are needed to inform 
resource planning and research prioritisation but current evidence is scarce. We aimed to assess temporal trends in 
incidence and prevalence of heart failure in a large general population cohort from the UK, between 2002 and 2014.
Methods For this population-based study, we used linked primary and secondary electronic health records of 4 million 
individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a cohort that is representative of the UK population 
in terms of age and sex. Eligible patients were aged 16 years and older, had contributed data between Jan 1, 2002, and 
Dec 31, 2014, had an acceptable record according to CPRD quality control, were approved for CPRD and Hospital 
Episodes Statistics linkage, and were registered with their general practice for at least 12 months. For patients with 
incident heart failure, we extracted the most recent measurement of baseline characteristics (within 2 years of 
diagnosis) from electronic health records, as well as information about comorbidities, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, 
and region. We calculated standardised rates by applying direct age and sex standardisation to the 2013 European 
Standard Population, and we inferred crude rates by applying year-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific incidence to 
UK census mid-year population estimates. We assumed no heart failure for patients aged 15 years or younger and 
report total incidence and prevalence for all ages (>0 years). 
Findings From 2002 to 2014, heart failure incidence (standardised by age and sex) decreased, similarly for men and 
women, by 7% (from 358 to 332 per 100 000 person-years; adjusted incidence ratio 0·93, 95% CI 0·91–0·94). However, 
the estimated absolute number of individuals with newly diagnosed heart failure in the UK increased by 12% (from 
170 727 in 2002 to 190 798 in 2014), largely due to an increase in population size and age. The estimated absolute 
number of prevalent heart failure cases in the UK increased even more, by 23% (from 750 127 to 920 616). Over the 
study period, patient age and multi-morbidity at first presentation of heart failure increased (mean age 76·5 years 
[SD 12·0] to 77·0 years [12·9], adjusted difference 0·79 years, 95% CI 0·37–1·20; mean number of comorbidities 3·4 
[SD 1·9] vs 5·4 [2·5]; adjusted difference 2·0, 95% CI 1·9–2·1). Socioeconomically deprived individuals were more 
likely to develop heart failure than were affluent individuals (incidence rate ratio 1·61, 95% CI 1·58–1·64), and did so 
earlier in life than those from the most affluent group (adjusted difference –3·51 years, 95% CI –3·77 to –3·25). From 
2002 to 2014, the socioeconomic gradient in age at first presentation with heart failure widened. Socioeconomically 
deprived individuals also had more comorbidities, despite their younger age.
Interpretation Despite a moderate decline in standardised incidence of heart failure, the burden of heart failure in the 
UK is increasing, and is now similar to the four most common causes of cancer combined. The observed 
socioeconomic disparities in disease incidence and age at onset within the same nation point to a potentially 
preventable nature of heart failure that still needs to be tackled.

Introduction
Adequate public health and service delivery planning 
requires reliable information about contemporary 
population-level disease incidence. Policies need to 
consider both standardised rates, which describe disease 
incidence independently of changes in population, and 
absolute numbers of patients affected, which describe 
the impact of the disease on the population and services 
of interest.
Estimates of heart failure incidence and its temporal 
trends, even in high-income countries, are scarce and 
inconsistent.1–6 Previous studies have frequently been 
based on selected cohorts,2–4,6 which may not represent 
the general population. Other studies have restricted 
case identification to those made in general practice 
consultations7 or hospital admissions.8,9 However, it is only 
by con 
sidering presentations across the whole spectrum 
of acute and chronic care that the full burden of disease 
can be captured and an accurate distinction made between 
incident and prevalent cases. Moreover, previous reports 
have differed in their approach to age standardisation—
with some authors presenting crude rates,5,10 others

standardising to census populations,3,4,6 or simply ad-
justing for differences in the denominator population.2,11 
Very few studies refer to a standard population, rendering 
comparisons between studies challenging. Consequently, 
reported incidence varies by a factor of ten across studies 
(appendix).
As for the absolute number of cases of incident heart 
failure, country-specific estimates are rarely reported. 
For instance, in the UK, although several national 
pro 
grammes generate heart failure statistics, reliable 
information about the absolute number of new cases 
is not available. The Annual Quality and Outcomes 
Framework reports UK prevalence estimates based on 
general practice consultations, but yearly incidence is not 
recorded.12 The British Heart Foundation’s Cardiovascular 
Disease Statistics and the National Heart Failure Audit 
include annual numbers of inpatient episodes of heart 
failure, but are limited in their ability to distinguish 
between first and recurrent presentations.13,14 More 
generally, both national and international quantification 
of the absolute number of cases of incident heart failure 
are absent from global heart failure reviews.15,16 
Additionally, long-term trends on the heterogeneity of 
incident heart failure in the general population overall, 
and by features such as age or socioeconomic status, 
are scarce.17
To address these knowledge gaps, we used a large 
longitudinal database of linked primary and secondary 
care records from a representative sample of the UK 
population18 to assess trends in crude and standardised 
heart failure incidence by sex, age, socioeconomic status 
and region. We also investigated the comorbidity profile 
of patients over more than a decade.
Methods
Data sources
We used electronic health records from the Clinical 
Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from Jan 1, 1985, to 
Sept 30, 2015. The CPRD database contains anonymised 
patient data from approximately 7% of the UK population 
and is broadly representative in terms of age, sex, and 
ethnicity. CPRD is one of the largest databases of 
longitudinal medical records from primary care in the 
world and has been validated for epidemiological 
research for a broad range of conditions.18 Primary care 
records from CPRD were linked to secondary care 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for reports published in English between 
Jan 1, 2000, and April 30, 2017, that included “heart failure” and 
“incidence” in their title. We also reviewed references of clinical 
practice guidelines and consulted with experts for relevant 
studies.
Estimates of heart failure incidence rates, trends over time, and 
association with patient features were scarce and inconsistent. 
Studies frequently referred to restricted populations or to 
limited data sources, from either general practice consultations 
or hospital admissions. To compare reports of heart failure 
incidence, we selected a subset of studies that referred to a 
community-based cohort, included outpatient diagnoses in 
their case identification, presented incident rates in the general 
population (all ages and sexes), and considered all types of 
heart failure. We found that reports differed in their approach to 
age-standardisation, rendering comparisons between studies 
challenging, and that reported incidence rates varied by a factor 
of ten across studies. We found no study that presented both 
crude and standardised rates overall and by subgroups.
Added value of this study
Our study provides important new information on the 
contemporary incidence of heart failure and insights into its 
variation over time by age, sex, region, and socioeconomic 
status. We present crude and standardised incidence rates 
derived from a large, representative, general population cohort, 
setting a baseline for international comparison, monitoring of 
prevention strategies, and informed design of public health 
policies. We provide evidence that, in the UK, the burden of 
heart failure is increasing with population growth and ageing, 
and is similar to the combined incidence of breast, prostate, 
lung, and bowel cancer. Many high-income countries have 
similar population structures and temporal changes, and are 
likely to have a similar burden. Our results also highlight 
important changes in patients’ profile over time—with a trend 
towards an increasing age at first presentation and a 
substantial rise in the number of associated comorbidities—
and quantifies the magnitude of socioeconomic disparities, 
showing that these affect not only incidence of heart failure, 
but also age at first presentation and prevalence of 
comorbidities.
Implications of all the available evidence
In Europe, North America, and Australasia, improvements in 
heart failure prevention have been achieved but remain modest 
compared with other cardiovascular diseases. Population 
growth and ageing, observed in many high-income countries, 
have been shown to overcome these improvements, leading to 
an increasing absolute burden of heart failure. Incidence of 
heart failure is similar to the four most common causes of 
cancer (lung, breast, bowel, and prostate) combined, and 
requires reinforced public health action in prevention and 
resource planning, as well as efficient and effective care delivery. 
The profile of patients with heart failure, although mostly 
elderly, male, multimorbid, and economically deprived 
individuals, remains diverse and is changing over time. 
Socioeconomic disparities in disease incidence, age at onset, as 
well as associated comorbidities point to a potentially 
preventable nature of heart failure that still needs to be tackled.

admission records from Hospital Episodes Statistics 
Admitted Patient Care data. Linkage was available for a 
subset of English practices from Jan 1, 1998, covering 
approximately 50% of all CPRD records. Scientific 
approval for this study was given by the CPRD 
Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC).
Study population
Patients were men and women aged 16 years and older, 
contributing to data between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2014. 
Patients were eligible for inclusion if their record was 
labelled as acceptable by CPRD quality control18 and 
approved for CPRD and Hospital Episodes Statistics 
linkage, and if the patient was registered with their 
general practice for at least 12 months.
For incidence calculations, we excluded all individuals 
who had a diagnosis of heart failure before the study start 
date (Jan 1, 1985, to Jan 1, 2002, in primary care records 
and Jan 1, 1998, to Jan 1, 2002, in secondary care records), 
or within the first 12 months of registration with their 
general practice.
Case identification and categorisation
To identify heart failure diagnoses, we used a list of 
107 diagnostic codes from hospital (International 
Classification of Diseases, tenth revision [ICD-10]) and 
primary care (Read19) coding schemes (appendix). These 
include all codes used in the UK quality of care 
management programmes (the Annual Quality and 
Outcomes Framework introduced in 2004 for primary 
care, and the National Heart Failure Audit introduced in 
2007 for secondary care), and additional codes identified 
through medical dictionary keyword searches, previously 
published literature,4,7 and online clinical code reposi-
tories.20 We defined incident heart failure diagnosis as 
the first record of heart failure in primary care or hospital 
admission records from any diagnostic position.
Patient characteristics
For patients with incident heart failure, we extracted the 
most recent measurement of baseline characteristics 
within 2 years of a diagnosis of heart failure—ie, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, and body-
mass index (BMI)—from electronic health records. BMI 
was categorised as underweight (<18·5 kg/m²), normal 
(18·5–24·9 kg/m²), overweight (25–29·9 kg/m²), and 
obese (≥30 kg/m²).
We also extracted information about comorbidities, 
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and geographical region.
To describe comorbidities, we selected 17 common 
chronic conditions: anaemia, asthma, atrial fibrillation, 
cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, dementia, depression, diabetes, 
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, 
obesity, osteoarthritis, peripheral arterial disease, 
stroke, and thyroid disease. For each condition, we 
report prevalence as the percentage of patients with a 
diagnosis recorded in their primary care or hospital 
discharge record, before their first diagnosis of heart 
failure. Patients without diagnosis were assumed to be 
free from that condition. Diagnosis code lists for the 
extraction of each condition were adapted from the 
CALIBER code repository.
To describe socioeconomic status, we used the Index of 
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2015 quintile,21 a composite 
measure of relative deprivation at a small area level, 
covering an average population of 1500 people, ranked in 
ascending order of deprivation score and grouped in equal 
fifths, with quintile 1 representing the least deprived 
area and quintile 5 representing the most deprived area 
(appendix). Although absence of deprivation does not 
necessarily equate to affluence, to assist readability we 
refer to least deprived and most affluent interchangeably. 
Similarly, although the IMD quintiles refer to small 
neighbourhoods rather than to individuals, we use the 
terms most deprived or affluent to refer to people living in 
the most deprived or affluent areas.
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics are presented as frequencies (%) 
for categorical data, medians and IQR for non-normally 
distributed continuous data, or means and SD for 
normally distributed continuous data. Data are stratified 
by sex, socioeconomic quintile, and period of diagnosis. 
Number and percentage of records with missing data are 
displayed for variables with missing entries. For cate-
gorical variables, frequencies refer to complete cases.
We computed age-specific, sex-specific, and year-
specific incidence by dividing the number of incident 
cases by the number of patient-years in the cohort. Time 
at risk was restricted to number of days alive, in people 
aged 16 years and older, who were registered with a 
general practice for over 12 months, and to practice’s 
up-to-standard periods. We calculated age-specific, sex-
specific, and year-specific prevalence considering all 
patients ever diagnosed with heart failure (numerator) 
among patients alive, aged 16 years or older, and 
registered with a general practitioner during an up-to-
standard period (denominator) on June 30 in each year. 
We assumed no heart failure for patients aged 15 years or 
younger and report total incidence and prevalence for all 
ages (>0 years). 
To calculate standardised rates, we applied direct age 
and sex standardisation22 to the 2013 European Standard 
Population23 using 5-year age bands up to 90 years of 
age. The European Standard Population is an artificial 
population structure, designed and published by the 
statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat), to allow 
the calculation of age-standardised and sex-standardised 
rates that are comparable across regions and time.23
Crude rates were inferred by applying year-specific, 
age-specific, and sex-specific incidence to UK census 
mid- 
year population estimates, using 5-year age bands 
up to 90 years of age.

We used Poisson regression models to examine overall 
and category-specific incidence ratios and corresponding 
95% CIs. When applicable, we adjusted models for time, 
age, sex, region, and socioeconomic status.
Study findings are reported in accordance with the RE-
porting of studies Conducted using Observational 
Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) recommend-
ations.24 We used R (version 3.3) to do statistical analyses.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. NC and KR had full access to the 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
A total of 4 045 144 patients contributed data between 
Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2014. For incidence calculations, 
we excluded all individuals who had a diagnosis of heart 
failure before the study start date (45 671 records) or 
within the first 12 months of registration with their 
general practice (7056 records), leading to 3 992 417 eli-
gible patients, and a total of 24 877 519 patient-years at 
risk. Of those patients, 93 074 developed incident heart 
failure during the study period. Patient character 
istics 
stratified by sex, socioeconomic status, and time 
period categories are shown in the table. Mean age at 
heart failure diagnosis was 76·7 years (SD 12·6), and 
49·0% were women. From 2002 to 2014, mean age at 
diagnosis increased from 76·5 (12·0) to 77·0 years (12·9; 
adjusted difference 0·79 years, 95% CI 0·37–1·20; table). 
Men had higher prevalence of smoking than did women, 
and individuals who were most deprived had a higher 
prevalence of smoking and were more likely to have a 
body-mass index (BMI) in the overweight or obese range 
at baseline than the most affluent individuals (table).
In models standardised for age and sex, incidence 
of heart failure decreased by 7%, from 358 per 
100 000 people in 2002 to 332 per 100 000 people in 2014 
(adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0·93, 95% CI 
0·91–0·94; figure 1A). This overall decline was 
consistent across most age groups. However, there was 
an increase in incidence in the very elderly (85 years or 
older), and in those younger than 55 years the rates 
were too low for a meaningful contribution to the over-
all burden. By contrast with the declining standardised 
incidence, crude incidence increased by 2%, from 
288 per 100 000 people in 2002 to 295 per 100 000 people 
in 2014, and the estimated absolute number of yearly

new diagnoses of heart failure increased by 12% from 
170 727 in 2002 to 190 798 in 2014, due to population 
growth, especially in older age groups (figure 1B). For 
comparison, we aggregated the number of new cases of 
the four most common causes of cancer (lung, breast, 
bowel, and prostate) reported by Cancer Research UK in 
2014,25 which totalled 189 136.
Prevalence of heart failure, standardised by age and 
sex, remained relatively stable during the study period, 
ranging from 1·5% in 2002 to 1·6% in 2014 (adjusted 
rate ratio 1·03, 95% CI 1·02–1·05). Nonetheless, the 
absolute number of people living with heart failure in 
the UK increased by 23% over the study period, from 
750 127 in 2002 (1·3% of the total population) to 920 616 
in 2014 (1·4% of the total population; appendix).
The number of comorbidities at or before diagnosis 
of incident heart failure was high (mean 4·5 [SD 2·4]) 
and increased over time, from 3·4 (SD 1·9) in 2002 
to 5·4 (SD 2·5) in 2014 (difference adjusted for age, 
sex, and socioeconomic status 2·0, 95% CI 1·9–2·1; 
figure 2). Overall, 79% patients had three or more 
comorbidities, increasing from 68% in 2002 to 87% in 
2014 (table). The most common comorbidities preceding 
a diagnosis of heart failure are shown in figure 2B.
Age-standardised incidence of heart failure was higher 
in men than in women (IRR 1·52, 95% CI 1·50–1·54), 
particularly in younger age groups, such as the 
45–54 years age group (IRR 2·23, 95% CI 2·08–2·39). 
However, the total number of incident cases was only 
9% higher in men, because of the greater number of 
women in the older age groups (appendix). Men were 
also younger at diagnosis than were women (mean age 
74·0 years [SD 12·7] vs 79·4 years [11·8]; adjusted 
difference –5·51, 95% CI –5·67 to –5·35; table). In time-
trend analyses, the rate of decline in age-standardised 
incidence was similar for men and women from 2002 to 
2014. A similar pattern was seen in patients with 
prevalent heart failure; standardised prevalence was 
higher in men than in women (1·8% in men vs 1·2% 
in women; adjusted rate ratio (RR) 1·52, 95% CI 
1·51–1·53).
At same age and sex, patients in the most deprived 
socioeconomic quintile were more likely to experience 
incident heart failure (IRR 1·61, 95% CI 1·58–1·64) 
than were affluent individuals. Socioeconomic in-
equalities were apparent across all age groups and both 
sexes but were more pronounced in younger age groups 
(IRR 2·56, 95% CI 2·30–2·85 in the 45–54 years age 
group vs 1·17, 95% CI 1·13–1·22 in the >85 years age 
group). A similar disparity was observed in prevalence 
standardised by age and sex (2·0% in most deprived vs 
1·2% in least deprived; adjusted RR 1·57, 95% CI 
1·55–1·58).
In stratified time-trend analyses, there was no 
evidence to suggest that the overall decline in incidence, 
standardised by age and sex, differed by socioeconomic 
quintiles (figure 3). However, age at which heart failure 
was diagnosed differed by socioeconomic status and 
this gap in age widened over time (figure 4). During 
the study period, patients from the most deprived socio-
economic quintile were about 3·5 years younger at 
diagnosis than those from the least deprived (mean age 
at diagnosis 74·5 years [SD 13·3] for most deprived vs 
77·8 years [SD 12·1] for most affluent group; adjusted 
difference –3·51 years, 95% CI –3·77 to –3·25). From 
2002 to 2014, mean age at diagnosis increased by 
2·45 years (95% CI 1·58–3·32) among the most affluent, 
but tended to decrease amongst the most deprived 
(adjusted difference –0·44 years, 95% CI –1·50 to 0·61; 
figure 4). Socio 
economic inequalities were also visible

in comorbidity rates, and the proportion of patients 
presenting with three or more comorbidities ranged 
from 81% for the most deprived to 77% for the least 
deprived group (table).
If incidence from the most affluent group could be 
achieved for all socioeconomic groups, we would expect 
31 810 fewer heart failure cases annually in the UK, or 
an approximately 18% lower crude incidence.
Regional variation in heart failure incidence was wide, 
but attenuated over the study period (appendix).
Discussion
This large-scale, representative, population-based study 
provides several insights into the burden of heart failure 
in the UK and its variation over time, by age, sex, region, 
and socioeconomic status.
The incidence rate of heart failure, standardised by age 
and sex, decreased modestly between 2002 and 2014, 
which contrasts with myocardial infarction, for which 
incidence has decreased by about a third over a similar 
time period in many countries.26 The comparatively 
small reduction in standardised incidence of heart 
failure might be due to higher survival among patients 
with post-myocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction 
as a result of improvements in medical treatment.26–28 
Further insights into these trends come from our 
stratified analyses. Although the declines in incidence 
were largely consistent for both sexes, across all 
socioeconomic groups and regions the age-stratified 
analyses show some discordant trends. In the very 
elderly (>85 years), the standardised incidence appears 
to have increased, despite decreasing for myocardial 
infarction in the same age category.26,29 
The increase in incidence of heart failure in older 
people could result from less effective control of cardio-
vascular risk factors in those age groups. Alternative 
explanations include policy interventions for better 
diagnosis and management of patients in the 
community,12 and investments in specialist heart failure 
services that might have led to increased diagnosis rates, 
particularly among the elderly. Such national policy 
interventions and investments in services could also 
explain the nadir we noted in the number of new heart 
failure diagnoses in the years 2004–06, which coincides 
with the introduction of a national care monitoring 
programme, the Quality and Outcomes Framework. 
However, such modest short-term variations have also 
been noted in other long-term heart failure incidence 
studies,3,4 and could be random variation.
Standardised trends are necessary to compare 
changes in disease burden over time and place, but to 
service payers, providers, and researchers, it is also 
important to know the absolute numbers of patients 
who require treatment. Despite a modest decline in 
standardised incidence, there has been a 12% increase 
in the total number of new cases of heart failure. This is 
substantial, and by comparison is now similar to the 
total number of new cases of breast, prostate, lung, and 
bowel cancer combined.25 The predominant reason for 
the rise in incidence is the increasing number of older 
people in the UK, a demographic change in many other 
countries. More specifically, the number of people aged 
65–69 years has increased by 36%, representing the

post-war baby-boom generation that is now reaching 
the age at which risk of heart failure increases.
The prevalence of heart failure has increased even more 
substantially than its incidence, possibly as a result of 
longer survival after heart failure diagnosis. Overall, 
despite a relatively stable standardised prevalence, we 
observed a 23% increase in the absolute number of people 
living with heart failure.
The number of comorbidities associated with heart 
failure was high and increased between 2002 and 2014 in 
parallel, with increasing age at onset. This suggests that in 
addition to the growing number of patients with heart 
failure, their clinical manage 
ment is becoming more 
complex, further increasing the burden on health 
services and demand for specialist cardiology input in 
multidisciplinary care teams. The increasing number of 
comorbidities is likely to be influenced by several factors, 
such as population ageing, enhanced screening and 
diagnostics, physician awareness, and changes in risk 
factors. Beyond the number of comorbidities, the nature 
of comorbidities noted in our study reveals interesting 
patterns. For instance, non-cardiovascular comorbidities 
make a substantial contribution to multimorbidity in 
patients with heart failure and they have been doing so 
increasingly over time. Future app 
ropriately designed 
studies could investigate this question further.
Achieving equity in access to essential health care has 
been a goal of many health-care systems and is now a 
specific target of the UN’s Sustainable Development 
Goal 3. Previous studies30 have shown that in countries 
where the human development index (a composite 
measure of gross national income per capita, life 
expectancy, and education) is low, patients present with 
heart failure at a much younger age than in countries 
with a high human development index. Likewise, at the 
country level, socioeconomic deprivation is associated 
with an increased incidence of heart failure.7,31 The results 
of our study build upon these findings by showing that 
low socioeconomic status is not only associated with 
higher standardised incidence of heart failure, but also 
an earlier disease onset and higher comorbidity rates 
than associated with high socioeconomic status. Our 
time-trend analyses further show that there has been no 
substantial convergence of the incidence rates by 
socioeconomic status and, in fact, the age gap between 
the most and least deprived groups widened by almost 
2·5 years during the study period.
Our study was not designed to investigate the causal 
role of socioeconomic status or pathways through which 
it affects heart failure incidence. However, previous 
research has shown that the variability in heart failure 
incidence by socioeconomic gradient is likely to be 
explained by several biological, environmental, and 
behavioural risk factors, including, but not exclusively, 
known cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, 
obesity, or blood pressure.31,32 Thus, achieving equity in 
outcomes is likely to require additional population-level 
and individual-level inter 
ventions. The persistent and 
partly widening gaps in disparities in a health-care system 
with equality of access to health care also raises questions 
about how, when, and where more deprived patients seek 
care, and whether additional efforts are necessary to 
achieve equity in health-care use (as well as access).
A major strength of this study is the selection of a large 
representative cohort across primary and secondary care, 
with a sufficient number of cases in each sex, age, 
socioeconomic, and regional category to allow overall and 
subpopulation analyses. This population-based approach 
increases the generalisability of the findings compared 
with surveys that select partipants.33 Moreover, in view of 
the similarity of trends in cardiovascular disease and 
population ageing from the UK with other European 
countries, North America, and Australasia,34,35 our findings 
are likely to be broadly applicable to much of the rest of the 
developed world.
One of the key limitations of our study was the 
incomplete clinical information contained in the 
available electronic health records. In particular, left 
ventricular ejection fraction values were not available, 
meaning that it was not possible to identify the type of 
heart failure. Research using electronic health records 
databases is also reliant on the accuracy of clinical coding 
input by physicians. The validity of clinical diagnoses 
recorded in CPRD has been investigated for a wide range 
of diseases, including heart failure36 and other common 
chronic conditions,37 with an average positive predictive 
value of 89%38 and 92% completeness, compared with 
national registry data.39 Moreover, national clinical audit 
programmes (particularly the Quality and Outcomes 
Framework and the National Heart Failure Audit) ensure 
stable quality of clinical coding practices and provide a 
solid support for the validity of recorded diagnoses. 
Indeed, these programmes report that approximately 
90% of recorded heart failure diagnoses in England are 
referred for echocardiography, specialist assessment, or 
B-type natriuretic peptide measurement (appendix).12,14
Our findings have implications for health-care resource 
planning and preventive strategies. The decline in 
standardised heart failure incidence, particularly in 
people aged 60–79 years, suggests that heart failure 
prevention has improved, probably because of a 
combination of environmental changes, public health 
measures, and improvements in clinical care. However, 
the increase in the absolute number of incident and 
prevalent cases of heart failure is placing an increasing 
burden on health care. The profile of patients with heart 
failure is diverse and evolving over time—with a trend 
towards older age and a substantial increase in the 
number of associated comorbidities—indicating that 
both prevention and management are becoming more 
complex. The observed disparities in heart failure 
incidence by sex, socioeconomic status, and region point 
to potential opportunities for more targeted and equitable 
prevention strategies.
