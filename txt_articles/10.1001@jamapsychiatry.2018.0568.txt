IMPORTANCE Understanding the role of substance use disorders in conversion from
schizotypal disorder to schizophrenia may provide physicians and psychiatrists with
important tools for prevention or early detection of schizophrenia.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether substance use disorders, in particular cannabis use
disorder, are associated with conversion to schizophrenia in individuals with schizotypal
disorder.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included a
population-based sample of all individuals born in Denmark from January 1, 1981, through
August 10, 2014, with an incident diagnosis of schizotypal disorder and without a previous
diagnosis of schizophrenia. Follow-up was completed on August 10, 2014, and data were
analyzed from March 10, 2017, through February 15, 2018.
EXPOSURES Information on substance use disorders combined from 5 different registers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox proportional hazards regression using time-varying
information on substance use disorders and receipt of antipsychotics and adjusted for
parental history of mental disorders, sex, birth year, and calendar year were used to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for conversion to schizophrenia.
RESULTS A total of 2539 participants with incident schizotypal disorder were identified (1448
men [57.0%] and 1091 women [43.0%]; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [4.4] years). After 2 years,
16.3% (95% CI, 14.8%-17.8%) experienced conversion to schizophrenia. After 20 years, the
conversion rate was 33.1% (95% CI, 29.3%-37.3%) overall and 58.2% (95% CI, 44.8%-72.2%)
among those with cannabis use disorders. In fully adjusted models, any substance use
disorder was associated with conversion to schizophrenia (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.63). When
data were stratified by substance, cannabis use disorders (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.68),
amphetamine use disorders (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.17), and opioid use disorders (HR, 2.74;
95% CI, 1.38-5.45) were associated with conversion to schizophrenia. These associations
were not explained by concurrent use of antipsychotics, functional level before incident
schizotypal disorder, or parental history of mental disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Substance use disorders, in particular cannabis,
amphetamines, and opioids, may be associated with conversion from schizotypal disorder to
schizophrenia. However, conversion rates are high even in those without substance use
disorders, indicating a need for universal and substance-targeted prevention in individuals
with schizotypal disorder.

ne-quartertoone-halfofpatientswithschizotypaldis-
order experience conversion to schizophrenia within
5 years.1-3 This potential link is further strengthened
by studies showing that parental schizotypal disorder is asso-
ciated with schizophrenia in offspring.4,5
Substance use disorders are common in patients with
schizotypaldisorder,6andcannabishasbeenshowntobearisk
factor for developing schizotypal disorder.7 Cannabis has also
been linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia.8 Other sub-
stance use disorders, in particular alcohol use disorder, may
also increase risk of later schizophrenia.9
These previous results suggest that substance use, in
particular cannabis, may be associated with conversion to
schizophrenia in individuals with schizotypal disorder. Two
small studies from Denmark1,3 failed to find such a link but
were based on only 79 and 83 individuals each. Conversely,
one of these studies found that in fully adjusted analyses,
antipsychotic treatment and level of functioning were the
only statistically significant variables associated with transi-
tion to psychosis,3 whereas only sex was significantly associ-
ated in the other study.1 This finding may have been attribut-
able to low power because the odds ratio for the association
of cannabis use with psychosis was 2.5 but with a very wide
CI. Consequently, an association cannot be ruled out and
needs to be investigated in larger samples. The potential role
of other substances has not to our knowledge been investi-
gated previously. Further investigation of this proposed
association may provide physicians and psychiatrists with
better tools for preventing or detecting onset of schizophre-
nia in individuals with schizotypal disorder regardless of
whether such an association is causal or simply an indicator
of risk.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether sub-
stance use disorders are associated with conversion to
schizophreniainindividualswithschizotypaldisorder.Ourhy-
pothesis was that individuals with substance use disorders
would be at increased risk compared with those without sub-
stance use disorders. We also hypothesized that cannabis use
disorders would be more strongly associated than other sub-
stance use disorders. Finally, we aimed to investigate whether
this association was confounded by use of antipsychotics or
parental history of mental illness.
Methods
Population
We used the nationwide Danish registries linked through the
civil registration number that has been provided to all indi-
viduals with legal residence in Denmark since 1968.10 We iden-
tifiedallpersonsborninDenmarkfromJanuary1,1981,through
August 10, 2014, with an incident diagnosis of schizotypal dis-
order (code F21 from International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-
10])withoutapreviousdiagnosisofschizophrenia(ICD-10code
F20 or code 295 from the International Classification of
Diseases, Eighth Revision [ICD-8]) through the Danish Psychi-
atric Central Research Register.11 January 1, 1981, was chosen
sothatthecohortwasunlikelytohavehadincidentschizotypal
disorder before the introduction of ICD-10 in 1994. According
to Danish law, register-based studies do not require informed
consent or approval by ethics committees.
Data
The exposure of substance use disorders was established from
linkage of 5 registers. The Psychiatric Central Research Regis-
ter and the National Patient Register provide ICD-8 and ICD-10
diagnostic codes for inpatient psychiatric (since 1969) and so-
matic hospital contacts (since 1977), respectively.11,12 Since
1995, both registers have also included outpatient and emer-
gency department contacts. In these registers, the ICD-8 and
ICD-10 codes shown in Table 1 were used to define the differ-
ent substance use disorder categories.
In addition, we used the following Anatomical Therapeu-
tic Chemical (ATC) codes from the National Prescription
Registry13 to identify medication given for alcohol use disor-
ders:N07BB01(disulfiram),N07BB02(calciumcarbimide),and
N07BB03 (acamprosate calcium). The following ATC codes
identified medication given for opioid use disorders: N07BC01
and N07BC51 (buprenorphine hydrochloride), N07BC02
(methadone hydrochloride), and N07BC03 (levacetylmeth-
adol). Finally, we used the National Alcohol Treatment Reg-
ister and the Register of Substance Abusers in Treatment to
identify individuals receiving treatment for substance use dis-
orders outside hospital settings.
The outcome of schizophrenia was established in the Psy-
chiatric Central Research Register as ICD-10 code F20. Infor-
mation regarding parental psychiatric history was obtained by
linking data on biological parents from the Civil Registration
System with the Psychiatric Central Research Register.10 This
information was stratified into parental history of schizophre-
nia, schizotypal disorder, or any other mental disorder (all re-
maining diagnostic codes).
Information regarding antipsychotics prescribed while the
individual had a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder was ob-
tained from the National Prescription Registry and defined as
all ATC codes in the N05A category. For this purpose, we in-
cluded antipsychotics prescribed within 1 year before the first
diagnosis of schizotypal disorder.
Key Points
Question Are substance use disorders, in particular cannabis use
disorders, associated with conversion from schizotypal disorder to
schizophrenia?
Findings In this Danish nationwide, register-based cohort study
that identified 2539 participants with incident schizotypal
disorder, any substance use disorder was associated with
conversion to schizophrenia at a rate of 33.1%; for cannabis use
disorders, the conversion rate was 58.2%. Results were
statistically significant after controlling for confounders.
Meaning Universal and substance-targeted prevention efforts are
needed to reduce conversion to schizophrenia in individuals with
schizotypal disorder.

 Information regarding functional level was obtained from
the DREAM (Danish Rational Economic Agents Model)
database14 and defined as work or student history in the year
preceding the incident diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. This
information was divided into full-time work or student his-
tory vs at least some periods of unemployment. Information
regarding sex and year of birth were obtained from the Civil
Registration System.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from March 10, 2017, through February
15, 2018, using using Cox proportional hazards regression.
The cohort was followed up from incident schizotypal disor-
der diagnosis until incident schizophrenia diagnosis, death,
migration, or August 10, 2014 (the last update of the current
set of registers), whichever came first. Diagnoses of sub-
stance use disorders and receipt of antipsychotics were
treated as time-varying covariates. If an exposure was inci-
dent before incident schizotypal disorder, the exposure was
thus present for the entire time at risk for that individual. All
analyses were adjusted for sex, calendar year, and year of
birth. In model 1, each variable was entered independently.
In model 2, all variables were entered simultaneously. We
tested for multicollinearity, which was not an issue (highest
variance inflation factor, 1.44; mean, 1.23). We performed
sensitivity analyses by censoring patients when they started
receiving antipsychotics rather than adjusting for this infor-
mation. Consequently, individuals receiving antipsychotics
before the date of incident schizotypal disorder were never
entered into these sensitivity analyses. These analyses were
conducted owing to the possibility that patients had already
developed schizophrenia at the first prescription of an anti-
psychotic without the proper change in diagnosis in the hos-
pital registers. We conducted further sensitivity analyses of
individuals regardless of their year of birth to increase statis-
tical power but at the cost of reduced confidence in the diag-
noses of schizotypal disorder being truly incident. A final set
of sensitivity analyses distinguished between onset of sub-
stance use disorder before or after incident schizotypal dis-
order. Analyses were conducted using Stata/MP software
(version 14.1; StataCorp).

 Results
Weidentified3027individualsborninDenmarksince1981with
incident schizotypal disorder (Table 2). Of these, 275 (9.1%)
were excluded because they had had a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia before their diagnosis of schizotypal disorder. A fur-
ther 213 (7.0%) were excluded because they had lived outside
Denmark before their incident diagnosis of schizotypal disor-
der to ensure full history of psychiatric disorders in the regis-
ter. Consequently, 2539 individuals remained for the analy-
ses (1448 men [57.0%] and 1091 women [43.0%]; mean [SD]
age at first diagnosis of schizotypal disorder, 20.9 [4.4] years).
Table 3 gives hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for conver-
sion to schizophrenia. Any substance use disorder (HR, 1.34;
95% CI, 1.11-1.63), opioid use disorder (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.38-

phetamine use disorder (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.14-3.17), and an-
tipsychotic use (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) were all associated
with conversion to schizophrenia in the fully adjusted analy-
ses. Other substance use disorders were associated with con-

cally significant risk factors for conversion were present, sub-
stance use disorders other than alcohol and cannabis use
disorders were pooled into a single category. After 20 years,

 substance use disorder was not present (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.86-
1.45). For individual substance use disorders, estimated HRs
were largely unchanged, but none were statistically signifi-
cant, presumably because of decreased power.
Weconductedfurthersensitivityanalysesregardlessofthe
birthyearofthecohort(n = 6598).Inthesefullyadjustedanaly-
ses, alcohol use disorder was also associated with conversion
to schizophrenia (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32), but amphet-
amine use disorder (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.65-1.30) and opioid
use disorder (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73-1.33) were not. Low level
of functioning was also associated with conversion to schizo-
phrenia in these analyses (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.46). Con-
version rates in this sensitivity analysis were almost identical
to those in the main analysis.
Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses stratifying sub-
stance use disorders into those with onset before or after in-
cident schizotypal disorder. Cannabis use disorder with on-
setbeforeincidentschizotypaldisorderwasnotassociatedwith
conversion (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.70-1.41; P = .98), and gener-
ally no substance use disorder other than opioid use disorder
(HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 0.99-6.77; P = .05) with onset before inci-
dent schizotypal disorder was associated with conversion to
schizophrenia.
Discussion
Cannabis, amphetamine, and opioid use disorders were asso-
ciated with conversion to schizophrenia in the fully adjusted
model. Cannabis use has been extensively studied as a risk fac-
tor for schizophrenia in the general population, and our study
revealedthisassociation.8,9Apreviousstudy9investigatedcan-
nabis and other substance use disorders as risk factors for
schizophrenia and found that even after full adjustment, can-
nabis use disorders led to a more than 5-fold increased risk of
schizophrenia. The HRs estimated in individuals with schizo-
typal disorder were markedly lower, which probably reflects
a higher baseline risk of conversion to schizophrenia in this
population,with16.3%ofthosewithoutanysubstanceusedis-
orders experiencing conversion to schizophrenia within a
2-year period.
Several explanations may be proposed for this associa-
tion. The association may be causal. This explanation is sup-
ported by a number of indicators from studies establishing an
associationbetweencannabisuseandschizophreniainthegen-
eral population. First, the association appears to be dose
dependent8,9; second, the association is stronger for more po-
tenttypesofcannabis15,16;third,cannabisuseisassociatedwith
earlier onset of psychosis17; and fourth, age at onset of canna-
bisuseisassociatedwithageatonsetofschizophrenia.18Ifsuch
associations are true in the general population, they likely
would also be true in a high-risk population, such as individu-
als with schizotypal disorder. A different explanation of the as-
sociation is that schizophrenia increases the risk of commenc-
ing use of cannabis or other substances.19 In favor of this
hypothesis is that such diverse substances as cannabis, am-
phetamines, and opioids are associated with conversion to
schizophrenia. In our study, the first registered date of sub-
stance use disorder came before the first registered date of
schizophrenia,butdelaysindiagnosesmayhavecausedschizo-
phrenia or its preclinical symptoms to predate substance use.
Many other studies have applied different methods to mini-
mize the risk of this occurrence, and the association is un-
likely to be explained by this theory of reverse causation.8,9
Finally, the association may be explained by common under-
lying or confounding factors. Sensitivity analyses showed that
conversionwasalmostexclusivelydrivenbysubstanceusedis-
order with onset after incident schizotypal disorder.
Alcohol use disorder was not associated with conversion
from schizotypal disorder to schizophrenia in the main analy-
sis, but it was in sensitivity analyses when ignoring the birth
year of the cohort, possibly owing to increased power in these
analyses. This finding is in line with a previous study of the
Danish general population.9 Further research is needed in this
area to establish whether the association is causal.
Low level of functioning was not associated with con-
version to schizophrenia in the main analysis, but it was in
the sensitivity analysis when disregarding birth year. This
finding is in line with those of previous studies regarding
conversion to schizophrenia.3,20,21 This variable may be an
indicator of degree of illness, and thus, it is not surprising
that those most severely affected by schizotypal disorder
are also at higher risk for subsequent conversion to schizo-
phrenia. Adjusting for level of functioning did not, however,
remove the associations between substance use disorders
and conversion to schizophrenia.
Use of antipsychotics was associated with conversion to
schizophrenia.Thisassociationisprobablyacaseofconfound-
ing by indication because patients who are deemed to be most
severely ill among those with schizotypal disorder are treated
with antipsychotics. However, adjustment for antipsychotic
use did not remove the association between substance use dis-

patients with schizotypal disorder in Denmark are prescribed
antipsychotics,whichraisestheconcernthatsomeofthesepa-
tients with schizotypal disorder might already have met the
threshold for a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia be-
fore the eventual diagnosis of schizophrenia. For this reason,
we conducted sensitivity analyses in which we censored in-
dividuals at the time when they first started receiving anti-
psychotics. Apart from loss of power, this censoring had little
effect on the estimated associations. Therefore, antipsy-
chotic use is unlikely to be a causal risk factor for conversion
from schizotypal disorder to schizophrenia. Instead, it may be
a marker of already increased risk.
Parental schizophrenia and other types of parental mental
illness were not associated with conversion from schizotypal
disorder to schizophrenia. This finding may be surprising be-
cause parental history of schizophrenia is a well-known risk
factor for schizophrenia in the offspring22 and parental se-
vere mental illness is associated with substance use in the
offspring22 but is probably a ceiling effect to the high overall
conversion rates from schizotypal disorders. The reasons for
this lack of an association are not clear. The high overall con-
version rate from schizotypal disorder to schizophrenia may
not allow for other genetic risk factors to influence the risk
greatly, whereas environmental risk factors such as cannabis
use disorders are able to increase the risk of conversion even
further.
Apart from cannabis use, amphetamine and opioid use
disorders were associated with conversion to schizophrenia.
In a previous study in the background population, these 2
types of substance use disorders were associated with devel-
opment of schizophrenia.9 To our knowledge, little research
has been conducted on this association. Because these sub-
stances are rather different, schizophrenia might not be
associated with the substances but with the underlying
addiction or even a selection mechanism. However, this pro-
cess would not explain why the same results were not
observed for the remaining substances. Opioids may also
hold an antipsychotic effect23 and thus may be used for self-
medication.
More years of following up incident schizotypal disorder
wererequiredbeforepreviouslyreportedconversionrateswere
reached in our study. Previous studies have relied on clinical
settings in which patients were reassessed for schizophrenia
at preset times. In our study, we had to rely on diagnoses given
in treatment settings. This process may have introduced a de-
lay between the actual time of conversion and the date that
was recorded in registers, which could at least in part explain
this discrepancy. Thus, it seems unlikely that participants with
late conversion were originally misdiagnosed with schizotypal
disorder.
Strengths and Limitations
The population of individuals with schizotypal disorder was
drawn from unselected nationwide registers, thus eliminat-
ing the risk of selection bias and attrition bias. Validation stud-
ies of severe mental illness have shown that the register is
highlyvalidforestablishingpopulationswiththesedisorders.11
We were not able to validate the diagnoses of schizotypal
disorder. The large proportion of antipsychotics prescribed to
the population might indicate that not all of them had true
schizotypal disorder but may in fact have had misdiagnosed
schizophrenia from the start. We performed sensitivity analy-
ses in which we censored individuals when they started re-
ceivingantipsychotics,withnegligiblechangestoresults.Thus,
misdiagnosis of schizotypal disorder does not seem to be a
likely explanation for the associations with cannabis use dis-
order.
A second limitation is that substance use disorders were
only registered if and when they were treated or became
prominent enough to be registered in patient medical rec-
ords, although we attempted to minimize this effect by com-
bining information on substance use disorder from several
different sources. Therefore, our estimates were likely to be
conservatively biased toward the null hypothesis. Similarly,
only substance use disorders were registered, which also
likely led to conservative estimates. An implication of this
limitation could also be that the neurologic processes of
addiction rather than the substances themselves drive the
association.
The extent to which our results are generalizable to DSM-V
is unclear. However, given that ICD-10 requires the presence
of fewer criteria than DSM-V, individuals diagnosed using
DSM-V criteria could be considered to be further along the path
to schizophrenia, in which case we would expect that the as-
sociations be at least as strong using DSM-V criteria as in the
present study.
A final limitation lies in the limited number of variables
for which we could adjust analyses. We did not have informa-
tion on the use of tobacco, which often co-occurs with canna-
bisuseandwithsomeevidenceindicatingthatitmaybelinked
to development of psychosis.24 However, 1 analysis25 has sug-
gested that cannabis may be the explanatory factor in the link
between tobacco and psychosis.
Conclusions
Secondary analyses of the OPUS trial found that integrated,
specialized treatment decreased the rate of conversion to
schizophrenia.1 Another trial found that low doses of risperi-
done combined with cognitive behavior therapy reduced the
rate of conversion to psychosis from ultrahigh-risk states
such as schizotypal disorder,26 but 2 later trials failed to rep-
licate this finding.27,28 Of note, with the exception of the
OPUS trial, all trials to our knowledge that have found sig-
nificant reductions in conversion rates for psychosis have
included patients fulfilling any ultrahigh-risk criterion and
not just individuals with schizotypal disorder. Thus, an
increased focus on how to prevent conversion from schizo-
typal disorder to schizophrenia is required. Preventing or
treating substance use disorders, especially cannabis and
amphetamine use disorders, may have some efficacy in
reducing the additional risk attributable to substance use
disorders but probably not below the already high baseline
conversion rate.
