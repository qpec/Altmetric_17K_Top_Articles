The cerebral correlates of altruistic decisions have increasingly attracted the interest of neuroscientists. To date, investigations on
the neural underpinnings of altruistic decisions have primarily been conducted in healthy adults undergoing functional neuroima-
ging as they engaged in decisions to punish third parties. The chief purpose of the present study was to investigate altruistic
decisions following focal brain damage with a novel altruistic decision task. In contrast to studies that have focused either on
altruistic punishment or donation, the Altruistic Decision Task allows players to anonymously punish or donate to 30 charitable
organizations involved with salient societal issues such as abortion, nuclear energy and civil rights. Ninety-four Vietnam War
veterans with variable patterns of penetrating traumatic brain injury and 28 healthy veterans who also served in combat parti-
cipated in the study as normal controls. Participants were asked to invest $1 to punish or reward real societal organizations, or
keep the money for themselves. Associations between lesion distribution and performance on the task were analysed with multi-
variate support vector regression, which enables the assessment of the joint contribution of multiple regions in the determination of
a given behaviour of interest. Our main findings were: (i) bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal lesions increased altruistic punishment,
whereas lesions of the right perisylvian region and left temporo-insular cortex decreased punishment; (ii) altruistic donations were
increased by bilateral lesions of the dorsomedial parietal cortex, whereas lesions of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and
middle temporal gyri decreased donations; (iii) altruistic punishment and donation were only weakly correlated, emphasizing their
dissociable neuroanatomical associations; and (iv) altruistic decisions were not related to post-traumatic personality changes. These
findings indicate that altruistic punishment and donation are determined by largely non-overlapping cerebral regions, which have
previously been implicated in social cognition and moral experience such as evaluations of intentionality and intuitions of justice
and morality.

Introduction
Altruistic, or costly, punishment and helping lie at the core
of
interpersonal
cooperation
in
all
human
societies
(Henrich et al., 2006), and, by extension, of legal codes
and norms (Green and Groff, 2003). Altruistic punishment
and helping entail costs to punish norm violators and sup-
port to norm enforcers, even under anonymity in which no
reputation gains are at stake (Hoffman, 2014). The devel-
opment of new experimental paradigms, which are usually
designed as economic games (Fehr and Camerer, 2007) and
hypothetical
crime
scenarios
(Robinson
and
Kurzban,
2007), has greatly advanced the experimental investigation
of altruistic decisions in their own right (Krueger and
Hoffmann, 2016).
Moral motivations lie at the roots of altruistic behaviour
(de Oliveira-Souza et al., 2016). Studies using non-invasive
virtual lesion methods, particularly transcranial direct-
current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation
as well as lesion mapping, have provided important clues
on the brain regions that are necessary for moral choices
(Tassy et al., 2012). Transcranial direct-current stimulation
or transcranial magnetic stimulation using two-person eco-
nomic games have shown that the right dorsolateral pre-
frontal
cortex
is
necessary
for
making
choices
that
maximize one’s reputation (Knoch et al., 2009) and for
social norm compliance under the threat of punishment
(Ruff et al., 2013). These findings are consistent with the
role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in reducing
subjective values associated with the pursuit of immediate
self-interests (Hare et al., 2009). Decisions to uphold social
norms in these experiments do not necessarily rely on
moral motivation, because these decisions could also be
driven by self-regarding motivations such as avoidance of
punishment, preserving one’s social reputation, and anger
elicited by challenges to self-interests. By contrast, interfer-
ence with medial frontopolar cortex function reduces guilt
and increases deceitful behaviours, such as lying in mock
crime interrogations (Karim et al., 2010). In patients with
frontotemporal dementia, degeneration of the frontopolar
cortex and septal region led to impairments of guilt and
compassion on an experimental moral sentiment task; im-
pairment of ‘other-critical’ feelings (anger/indignation and
disgust), in contrast, resulted from degeneration of the
amygdala and posterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
(Moll et al., 2011). A recent study Zhu et al. (2014)
showed that damage to the (mostly left) dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex, but not to the orbitofrontal cortex, impaired
honesty concerns. The economic decision task used in that
study enabled the separation of honesty concerns from al-
truistic preferences per se: whereas all groups were equally
altruistic in sharing money with anonymous participants in
a dictator game, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex patients
were less concerned about honesty and more indulgent in
sending ‘false messages’. These results highlight the distinct
roles of the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex in a
specific moral motivation—abiding to honesty—and their
interplay in self-control (Hare et al., 2009; Hayashi et al.,
2013) and value computations (Pre
´vost et al., 2010). Taken
together, these studies point to the importance of different
sectors of the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortices
for prosocial motivations and for honesty, self-reputation
concerns and third party punishment (Coricelli et al., 2005;
Delgado et al., 2005).
The neurological underpinnings of altruistic decisions have
mostly been studied in normal volunteers, few studies having
been conducted in brain-damaged patients (Haushofer and
Fehr, 2008; Glass et al., 2016). Notably, none of them has
investigated anonymous third party punishment and reward
towards societal causes. Patient studies can uniquely contrib-
ute causal information on the underpinnings of altruistic
decisions
and,
by
extension,
to
intuitions
of
justice
(Rorden and Karnath, 2004). In this study, we investigated
the performance of a large cohort of Vietnam War veterans
with focal frontal, temporal and parietal injuries on a simple
altruistic decision task. We hypothesized that anonymous
costly punishments and donations toward organizations
that back up salient societal causes such as women’s
rights, euthanasia, and the use of nuclear energy, would be
altered by damage to different cerebral regions that have
previously been implicated in social cognition and, more
particularly, in intuitions of morality and justice.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants were male combat veterans recruited from the WF
Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study Registry during phase 4,
conducted between 2009 and 2012 at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Maryland (Raymont et al., 2011). Given

 its sample size and wealth of pre-injury and post-injury data,
the Vietnam Head Injury Study provides a unique opportunity
to investigate brain–behaviour relationships with lesion-map-
ping methods. Our sample consisted of 94 veterans with pene-
trating traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 28 controls who also
served in combat in Vietnam but had no history of brain
injury or other neurological disorders. All penetrating TBI
and controls were recruited from the Vietnam Head Injury
Study. The groups were matched on key demographic vari-
ables including age, sex, education, and war experience. Few
participants in either group reported a diagnosis of substance
abuse of cannabis, anxiolytics, stimulants, opioids, cocaine,
phencyclidine, or other substances. All penetrating TBI partici-
pants were retired after their tour of duty ended or if injury
mandated it; controls spent time in Vietnam but almost all
retired shortly afterward. At phase 4, patients with penetrating
TBI were evaluated �40 years after injury, so it can be
assumed that their lesions were stable because most of the
compensatory mechanisms observed after penetrating TBI
had likely occurred within the 3 years that follow the injury.
Their screening at the time of phase 4 did not reveal any
neurodegenerative diseases or additional lesions. Table 1 re-
ports penetrating TBI and controls demographics and results
from selected descriptive neuropsychological tests that were
administered over a 5-day testing period. The Institutional
Review
Board
at
the
National
Institute
of
Neurological
Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda approved all procedures
and participants and caregivers provided written consent
before inclusion in the study.
Imaging acquisition and lesion
identification
Axial CT scans without contrast were acquired at the Bethesda
Naval Hospital on a GE Medical Systems Light Speed Plus CT
scanner in helical mode during phase 3. Structural neuroima-
ging data were reconstructed with an in-plane voxel size of
0.4 � 0.4 mm, an overlapping slice thickness of 2.5 mm, and a
1 mm slice interval. Lesion location and volume were docu-
mented from CT images with the Analysis of Brain Lesion soft-
ware (Makale et al., 2002; Solomon et al., 2007) implemented
in MEDx v.3.44 (Medical Numeric) with enhancements to in-
clude the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas (Tzourio-
Mazoyer et al., 2002). The CT image of each brain was normal-
ized to a CT template in MNI space using an automated image
registration algorithm with 12-parameter affine fit (Woods
et al., 1993). Both the subject’s brain and the MNI template
were skull-stripped to maximize the efficacy of the image regis-
tration from native space to MNI space; voxels inside the traced
lesion were not included in the spatial normalization procedure
(Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). Similar to other lesion studies
(Heberlein et al., 2004), lesions were traced manually on
each slice in native space by a neuropsychiatrist with experi-
ence in reading CT scans, and subsequently reviewed by the
principal investigator of the Vietnam Head Injury Study
(Krueger et al., 2009). Both judges were blind to the results
of the clinical evaluation. The clinical interpretation of scans
acquired during phase 4 was consistent with that of phase 3
on which we had quantifiable information. A map of the
lesion overlap is shown in Fig. 1.
Neurobehavioural protocol and
background neuropsychological
testing
Altruistic Decision Task
The Altruistic Decision Task was modified from a task for-
merly used in a functional MRI investigation of altruistic do-
nations in normal adult volunteers (Moll et al., 2006). The
main goal of the Altruistic Decision Task is to assess prefer-
ences
for
real
societal
causes
based
on
moral
beliefs.
Participants were invited to take part in a study on the psych-
ology of judgements about societal causes such as euthanasia
and gun control. After a brief practice session, they were pre-
sented with the names of 30 real societal organizations and a
short description of their respective missions followed by a
prompt to (i) punish (removing money from) or reward
(donating money to) each organization; or (ii) save the

 money for themselves (the Supplementary material provides a
list of the organizations and the instructions for the Altruistic
Decision Task). Each decision to punish or donate cost $1,
while refraining from either incurred no costs, leading to sav-
ings. From the outset, participants received a sum of $60 to
spend on either rewarding or punishing the organizations. It
was emphasized that they would deal with real money that
they could keep for themselves (heretofore called ‘savings’),
or spend on donating to, or punishing, each organization as
they wished. If the participant chose to donate funds to the
organization, he should select ‘yes’ in the ‘donate’ situation
and $1 was deducted from his account and transferred to
the organization; if he chose to punish the organization, he
should select ‘yes’ in the ‘punish’ situation and $1 was de-
ducted from his and from the organization’s account. (This
was made possible by deducting from the donations of other
participants to the same organization.) If the participant chose
to neither donate nor punish, he was instructed to select ‘no’
and no money was added or subtracted from his account.
Since each one of the 30 organizations was presented twice,
each participant had the opportunity to keep a maximum of
$60, donate a maximum of $30, or spend a maximum of $30
in punishments. Therefore, all donations and punishments
involved sacrificing one’s own money and were, by definition,
altruistic. The amounts saved or spent on punishing or donat-
ing were used for scoring the task. At the end of the session,
the participant received the money that he did not spend on
punishments and rewards.
For the purposes of the present study, we assumed that a
participant’s willingness to reward or punish a given organiza-
tion reflected his moral attitudes towards the mission of the
organization. We also assumed that decisions to punish or
donate reflected moralistic punishment and generous response
inclinations. Inferences like these have proved fruitful in lesion
studies using economic games as surrogates of moral emotions
like guilt and envy (Krajbich et al., 2009).
Background neuropsychological tasks
Participants initially underwent a brief cognitive screening
(Mini-Mental State Examination) followed by an extensive
neuropsychological assessment, which included handedness
(Oldfield Inventory) and intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated
Scale of Intelligence). Given the decisive influence of executive
function in altruistic decisions (Glass et al., 2016), we empir-
ically controlled the executive performance of patients with
penetrating TBI using their Delis-Kaplan raw scores on the
Sorting and the Letter and Category Fluency tasks (Delis
et al., 2001). The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Sorting
Test measures fundamental component processes of executive
functions by having participants to sort six cards along two
columns into several possible categories (Free Sorting) and ver-
bally explain how they reasoned to make the sorts the way
they did (Free Sorting Explanation); this was followed by the
participant’s recognition of the concepts underlying the ar-
rangement of the cards previously sorted by the examiner
(Sorting Recognition). The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function
Verbal Fluency subtests require verbal response generation
within a 1-min time limit: Letter Fluency contains three trials
that require generation of words starting with a specific letter
(F, A, S); Category Fluency includes two trials that require
generation of words that belong to a specific semantic category
(animals and boys names); and Category Switching includes a
single trial that requires the examinee to continuously alternate
between
two
semantic
categories
(fruits
and
furniture).
Personality and impulsivity were assessed with the NEO
Personality Inventory (Costa and McCrae, 1985) and the
Barratt scale (Patton et al., 1995), respectively.
Lesions underlying decisions on the Altruistic
Decision Task
Associations between lesion distribution and performance on
the
Altruistic
Decision
Task
were
assessed
with
support
vector regression multivariate pattern analysis (Smith et al.,
2013). Multivariate pattern analysis was used in the estimation
of the strength of associations between (i) lesion sites; and
(ii) the number of punishments and donations. Unlike univari-
ate analyses, this statistical technique does not assume inde-
pendent contributions of different voxels, but rather the joint
contribution of multiple voxels in the determination of the be-
haviour(s) of interest, in this case, the raw scores on the
Altruistic Decision Task (Zhang et al., 2014). This analysis
provided independent q-maps for punishment and donation,
each with a positive or a negative sign (i.e. the variable of
interest is positively or negatively correlated with the presence
of a brain lesion at a specific location. The steps used here
followed the guidelines provided by Zhang et al. (2014): (i) a
mask containing only the voxels that are lesioned in at least
three individuals is applied to the whole brain; (ii) a �-map is
generated from the raw data through a support vector regres-
sion model; (iii) the P-maps are obtained through a non-
parametric bootstrap analysis with 5000 permutations of the
Altruistic Decision Task raw scores; (iv) the P-maps thus gen-
erated are then corrected for multiple comparisons by applying
a false discovery rate (FDR) using P 5 0.05; and (v) clusters
with less than 10 voxels are filtered from the FDR-corrected
P-maps. The filtered FDR-corrected P-maps are the q-maps,
which can be coded as positive or negative depending on
the sign of the �-value of each voxel. For display purposes,

overlap at each voxel across the whole penetrating TBI

number of subjects, and blue indicates a lower number. The max-
imum overlap occurred in the right rostrolateral prefrontal lobe.

 colour-coded maps were generated by overlaying multivariate
�-maps
on
high-resolution
brain
surface
templates
using
Pycortex (Gao et al., 2015). These maps were thresholded ac-
cording to the procedures described above. It should be noted
that whereas support vector regression computes the associ-
ations between lesion localization and performance on the
Altruistic Decision Task across all patients, it does not provide
information about subgroups of individuals. This is because
decisions to punish or donate by a single individual may be
modulated by lesions in different locations; furthermore, some
lesions may not affect decisions on the Altruistic Decision Task.
We thus moved on to perform further supporting analyses.
Participants with penetrating TBI were then regrouped accord-
ing to the patterns of lesion distribution, which were contingent
on the associations between performance on the Altruistic
Decision Task and lesion sites. These supporting analyses
were performed for the punishment and donation q-maps and
resulted
in the following
subgroups: for the
punishment
q-maps, there were (i) an indifferent lesion subgroup, i.e. a
subgroup in which lesions did not influence decisions to
punish; (ii) a lesion subgroup showing increase in punishments;
(iii) a lesion subgroup showing a decrease in punishments; and
(iv) a lesion subgroup harbouring lesions that modulated pun-
ishment non-specifically, either increasing or decreasing it. An
equivalent categorization was derived for the multivariate do-
nation q-maps. Controls composed the comparison group.
Statistical analyses
The statistical significance of differences among the five behav-
ioural subgroups was assessed separately for punishments and
donations with one-way analyses of variance followed up by
pairwise comparisons with Tukey’s test. The strength of the
correlations between variables of interest was assessed with
Pearson’s coefficient (r). The significance threshold (�) for all
statistical tests was set at 0.05, two-tailed. Statistical power
and effect sizes (Z2) were estimated according to Cohen’s
guidelines for analysis of variance (Cohen, 1992) as small
(0.10), medium (0.25) and large (0.40).
Results
There were no statistical differences between patients (all
penetrating TBI cases pooled together) and controls on age,
education, global intelligence, handedness, or impulsivity.
Verbal intelligence and executive performance were slightly,
but significantly, lower in the penetrating TBI group, whereas
premorbid intelligence was slightly higher in the penetrating
TBI group (Table 1). However, given the small size effect of
these differences (all Z24 0.11) and their lack of significant
correlation with Altruistic Decision Task scores, we did not
enter them as covariates in the statistical model.
Both penetrating TBI and controls retained roughly two-
thirds of the total amount of money they could dispose of.
The remaining third was spent more in donations than in
punishments (F 4 20, df = 1, P 5 0.0001; all pairwise com-
parisons: P 5 0.001). The groups did not significantly differ
in the amount saved and spent on either donations or pun-
ishments (F 5 32, df = 1, P 4 0.23). Although there was an
expected inverse relationship between savings (not punish-
ing plus not donating) and punishing (all r’s 4 �0.49) or
donating (all r’s 4 �0.53) in both controls and all penetrat-
ing TBI pooled together, punishments and donations were
not significantly related. The results of the multivariate ana-
lyses are detailed below.
Punishment
Lesions that increased punishments were found (i) bilat-
erally in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; and (ii) in the
right rostrolateral frontal lobe (middle and inferior frontal
gyri) (Fig. 2). The dorsomedial prefrontal damage was
more extensive in the left hemisphere, where it additionally
involved the depth of the anterior division of the paracin-
gulate sulcus and the pregenual cingulate cortex. Lesions
that decreased punishment (Fig. 2) were distributed in the
left ventromedial temporal lobe, where they destroyed the
anterior two-thirds of the uncus and the rostral-most tip of
the parahippocampal gyrus. Injuries at this location deprive
the amygdala of a major set of connections from prefrontal
and parieto-temporo-occipital cortices (Stefanacci et al.,
1996). In the right hemisphere, the lesions leading to
decreased punishment followed a perisylvian distribution
which encompassed the lower third of the precentral, post-
central and supramarginal gyri (frontal and parietal oper-
cula), the insula, the posterior third of the middle temporal
gyrus, and the posterior half of the superior temporal
sulcus and superior temporal gyrus. The angular gyrus
and temporoparietal junction (Decety and Lamm, 2007)
were spared. Lesions extended into the subcortical white
matter to varying degrees, where they injured the middle
branch of the right superior longitudinal and the left un-
cinate fasciculi (less punishment), and the upper division of
the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (more punishment).
Despite no overall differences were noted between pene-
trating TBI and controls for punishing and donating, all
punishment subgroups spent more on punishing than on
donating, as expected (all P’s 5 0.0001). Only in the sub-
group that punished more was lesion volume correlated
with the amount retained (r = �0.37, P 5 0.03) and spent
on punishments (r = 0.42, P 5 0.01). Moreover, there were
no statistical differences between controls and the indiffer-
ent subgroup on any variable of interest, particularly on the
three main outcome variables of the Altruistic Decision
Task. In other words, the absence of lesions (controls)
had exactly the same effect on the Altruistic Decision
Task as the lesions outside the regions that modulated
the decisions to punish. The largest lesion volume was
found in the subgroup of lesions that led to both punishing
and donating. The total lesion volume of this subgroup was
statistically larger than that of the indifferent subgroup
only. The fact the lesion volume of the subgroup that pun-
ished more did not differ from the other subgroups suggests
that lesion volume alone was not a determinant of perform-
ance on the Altruistic Decision Task. Thus, lesion location,
rather than lesion size, was the primary determinant of

 performance on the Altruistic Decision Task. This conclu-
sion was strengthened by the absence of qualitative changes
in the results after controlling for lesion volume in the sup-
port vector regression model.
Donation
Lesions that led to increased donations were restricted to
the paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as to small
areas in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Fig. 3).
Injuries leading to a decrease in donations were restricted
to small sectors of the right ventrolateral occipital cortex
and posterior middle temporal gyrus (Fig. 3). A decrease in
donations was also related to a large subcortical lesion in
the white matter beneath the right inferior and middle fron-
tal gyri. This lesion, which was barely seen on the cortical
surface, probably destroyed the middle branch of the su-
perior longitudinal fasciculus (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Additional findings
The expected inverse correlations between punishments and
savings (controls r = �0.78, penetrating TBI r = �0.64) and
between donations and savings (controls r = �0.66, pene-
trating TBI r = �0.60), but not between punishments and
donations (r 5 0.26, P 4 0.13), were confirmed, indicating
that the money spent in punishments and donations came
from the savings fund, a further indication of genuine
costly altruism. There were no statistical differences in per-
sonality or impulsivity among groups in any condition; the
statistical differences observed on a few intelligence and
executive tests were of small magnitude (all Z2 4 0.11)
and unrelated to Altruistic Decision Task performance.

Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 describe the behaviour pat-
terns of the Altruistic Decision Task in lesion subgroups
and provide details on their neuropsychological perform-
ance. Total brain tissue volume loss exerted no overall
effect on punishments or donations. The lesion volume of
the subgroup that punished both more and less was statis-
tically larger than that of the indifferent lesion subgroup,
however. To rule out the possibility that results on the
Altruistic Decision Task were biased by spurious associ-
ations between lesions and behaviour arising from small
numbers, the total number of participants contributing to
the observed statistical effects was computed. These results
show that our statistical associations emerged from contri-
butions of at least six and, more typically, between 10 and
25 penetrating TBI participants per brain lesion location
(Table 3).

 Altruistic Donation Task (Wilcoxon test: P 5 0.02, two-
tailed). Finally, results from a voxel-based lesion mapping
univariate analyses provided qualitatively similar results to
the multivariate support vector regression method, though
statistically less robust (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Discussion
To date, this has been the only lesion study tackling the
causal neural underpinnings of altruistic decisions towards
real societal organizations. Its main findings may be thus
summarized: (i) bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal lesions
increased altruistic (costly) punishment, whereas lesions of
the right perisylvian region and left temporoinsular cortex
decreased it; (ii) altruistic (costly) donations were increased
by bilateral lesions of the dorsomedial parietal cortex,
whereas lesions of the right posterior superior temporal
sulcus and middle temporal gyri had the opposite effect;
and (iii) neither altruistic nor selfish decisions were related
to changes in personality. These aspects will be discussed in
turn. First, the relationships between focal brain lesions and
altruistic decisions using support vector regression-based
multivariate
pattern
analysis;
second,
our
study
was
designed to test the possibility that players may not only
punish, but may also donate to third parties, or refrain
from either donating or punishing, keeping their funds in-
stead; third, our experimental design allowed us to assess
the extent of overlap and segregation of the neural net-
works concerned with punishing and rewarding.
The Altruistic Decision Task
The Altruistic Decision Task has some features that distin-
guish it from other tasks designed to evoke altruistic deci-
sions. For the most part, such tasks have concentrated on
the neural substrates of decisions to punish, little attention
being paid to decisions to donate (e.g. Krueger et al.,
2014). First, besides adding the alternative of donating,
the Altruistic Decision Task allows the grading of more
or less punishments or donations. Second, it grants real
monetary incentives in real contexts. Third, the Altruistic
Decision Task provides no clues on when the intent (the
mission) of the organization (the moral agent) will be ac-
complished, or, for that matter, if it will ever be; therefore,
the Altruistic Decision Task emphasizes established beliefs
and attitudes towards the organizations and their missions
at the expense of observable outcomes. This reasoning is in

 line with a recent study that parsed the ordered processes
that end up in a decision to punish crimes of varying se-
verity (Ginther et al., 2016). Although we did not assess the
subjective justifications behind the participants’ decisions,
we assumed that they reflected harmful, benevolent, or
self-serving
(saving)
intentions.
Not
surprisingly,
there
was a consistent overlap of the lesions in our cases and
the regions implicated in empathy and mental attribution
both to individuals (Bzdok et al., 2013) and corporations
(Jenkins et al., 2014). Further support for this interpret-
ation is provided by clinicoanatomical correlations in pa-
tients with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal
dementia, in whom the injury of subregions of the dor-
somedial prefrontal and paracingulate cortices produce al-
terations of morality (Moll et al., 2011; Schroeter et al.,
2015).
Support vector regression
multivariate pattern analysis
Support vector regression multivariate pattern analysis
allows a shift of emphasis from individuals to lesion loca-
tion. This makes the interpretation of the results more real-
istic because it takes into account the fact that normal
people and patients donate, punish, or save when they
are left free to decide (Moll et al., 2006). Support vector
regression multivariate analysis circumvents the need to
force individuals into somewhat artificial categories, like
‘punishers’ or ‘donators’. It uses instead the location of
lesions leading to specific decisions to settle a relationship
of the type: lesion in area X increases decisions to punish,
lesions in area Y reduce decisions to donate, and so forth.
Therefore, it is the location of lesions that predicts decisions
on the Altruistic Decision Task, not the particularities of
the participants. Furthermore, this procedure takes into ac-
count lesion associations; for example, lesions in different
locations leading to an increase or a decrease of punish-
ments in different trials but in the same participant.
Following this lead, two broad patterns of lesion location
differentially accounted for punishments and donations. In
all instances, the lesions were either grossly symmetric or
asymmetric in favour of the right hemisphere; i.e. the right
hemisphere was more influential than the left regarding the
critical outcome variables. A corollary of this finding is that
performance on the Altruistic Decision Task depends less
on the integrity of the left than on the integrity of the right
hemisphere. Indeed, a rightward asymmetry has been the
rule in studies of empathy, moral cognition, and political
inclinations both in normal individuals and in patients with
brain damage (Driscoll et al., 2012; Mendez, 2017).
Brain regions implicated in
punishment
Many regions related to punishment decisions in the pre-
sent study have previously been implicated in altruistic pun-
ishment. A functional MRI study in which normal adults
assigned responsibility (a categorical variable) and graded

 penalties (a dimensional variable) to different patterns of
crimes
showed
that
the
right
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex and intraparietal sulci were engaged by deciding be-
tween responsible and not responsible. Another set of re-
gions were parametrically engaged by the assignment of
degrees of punishment to different crimes, most notably
the right amygdala, the dorsomedial and ventromedial pre-
frontal cortices, the temporal pole, and the posterior cingu-
late (Buckholtz et al., 2008). Glass et al. (2016) reached
essentially the same conclusions, and proposed that at least
two domain-general networks operate in altruistic punish-
ment, namely: (i) a mentalizing network for attribution of
responsibility; and (ii) an executive network for determin-
ing how much punishment should be applied to specific
cases or situations. Like us, they also found that punish-
ment was modulated by lesions of the left dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, right dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex extending into the supplementary
motor area, and right inferior parietal lobule. However,
neither the possible associations between the direction
(more or less) of punishment (Buckholtz et al., 2008) nor
between lesion location and donations (Glass et al., 2016)
had so far been explored. Moreover, whereas there is
agreement that punishments fit the severity of crimes
(Buckholtz and Marois, 2012), the present study is the
first lesion study to use altruistic decisions towards real
societal organizations, and to explore the effects of brain
lesions on altruistic giving.
Our findings concur with those of the aforementioned
authors, further indicating that two interacting systems
modulate altruistic punishment, one related to (i) the
right perisylvian cortex, and the left anterior temporal
lobe and insula; and the other related to (ii) the dorsome-
dial and rostrolateral prefrontal cortices.
Lesions that decreased punishment were primarily located
in parts of the right perisylvian cortex. A number of ima-
ging studies have implicated the temporoparietal junction
and posterior fourth of the superior temporal sulcus in ex-
tracting moral salience from perceptual stimuli (Moll et al.,
2005b; Young et al., 2010). This region only partially over-
laps the supramarginal gyrus and the temporoparietal junc-
tion,
which
have
been
identified
by
functional
MRI
(Chakroff et al., 2015) and transcranial magnetic stimula-
tion (Baumgartner et al., 2014) studies as being relevant to
complex social cues and to individual differences of gener-
osity (Morishima et al., 2012). These functional-anatomic
differences may be explained by damage to the right super-
ior longitudinal fasciculus (Supplementary Fig. 1), which
disrupted the connections among these regions (Mars
et al., 2012). Decreased punishment might also be ex-
plained by a decrease of moral disgust (indignation) result-
ing from the left temporo-insular damage (Moll et al.,
2005a). Overall, our findings suggest that the disposition
to punish third parties is reduced by damage to the right
posterior perisylvian and the left temporo-insular cortices.
The converse was true for injuries located in the prefrontal
cortices. More specifically, bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal
lesions and their ventral extension, and right rostrolateral
prefrontal lesions increased the rate of punishments, a find-
ing that concurs with a growing body of evidence showing
that these regions exert a regulatory effect on the perisylvian
and temporo-insular regions in judgments of moral respon-
sibility. From the perspective of the viewer (or witness), the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex integrates representations of
intent with the agent’s actual behaviour (completed harm
versus no harm at all) to come up with a final condemning
or exculpating judgement (Young and Saxe, 2008). This
tendency may be enhanced by the decrease of prosocial

 emotions that have been shown to follow dorsomedial pre-
frontal cortex damage (Moll et al., 2011). We might specu-
late that the injury of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex has
released the social attribution processes carried out by the
posterior temporoparietal and anterior temporal cortices
(Zahn et al., 2007; Young and Saxe, 2008), thus favouring
the willingness to punish. Whatever the ultimate explanation
for this finding might be, the net result of these interactions
is consistent with the complementary role of these regions in
altruistic punishment (Ruff et al., 2013) as well as with
Krajbich et al.’s (2009) interpretation of their own findings,
as mentioned before.
Brain regions implicated in donations
A second advantage afforded by the Altruistic Decision
Task and the multivariate support vector regression ana-
lysis was the possibility of delving into the cerebral correl-
ates of altruistic donations. As it turned out, these were
related
to
a
different
ensemble
of
cerebral
regions.
Damage to the left medial parietal lobe decreased dona-
tions, whereas damage to the right middle temporal gyrus
increased donations. It was somewhat surprising that these
regions were thus implicated in our patients because they
have to date not been implicated in altruistic reward (Gluth
and Fontanesi, 2016). The few associations between altru-
istic decisions and either activation or damage to the pos-
teromedial
hemispheric
surface
have
pointed
to
the
posterior cingulate in self-referential processes; however,
the supracingulate cortex, which was related to perform-
ance on the Altruistic Decision Task, was not noted in
those studies. Overall, our findings suggest that the super-
omedial parietal cortex is somehow involved in the facili-
tation
of
donations,
whereas
the
ventrolateral
occipitotemporal cortex is necessary for decisions that
reduce the probability of donating.
Interpretation of our findings in the
light of current knowledge
Although our study was not designed to tap the temporal
dynamics of the cerebral regions engaged by the Altruistic
Decision Task, taken together with the findings of other
researchers, our results support the view that altruistic de-
cisions emerge from a subtle interplay of neurocognitive
modules that are called forth into action when a moral
decision is demanded by a challenging context, such as
when one is asked to decide for or against euthanasia
(Moll et al., 2002). Some of these regions underpin the
attribution of mental states to third parties and the experi-
ence of the corresponding moral sentiments (e.g. witnessing
a good deed evokes the moral sentiment of admiration),
judgements of good and bad, and a final decision to
punish, donate or save. Experiments in normal volunteers
and brain-damaged patients have shown that these rela-
tively independent processes (Ginther et al., 2016) are to
a great extent reliant on the integrity of the right cerebral
hemisphere (Miller et al., 2010).
It has long been known that the integrity of the ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex and neighbouring regions is crit-
ical for the enactment of altruistic behaviours, most notably
when self-serving interests conflict with the interests of
others (Moll et al., 2016). Damage to this region enhances
the enactment of selfish decisions at the expense of the well-
being of others (Koenigs and Tranel, 2006; Moretto et al.,
2009). However, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which
was injured in a few cases of the present series, did not
bear a robust relationship to performance on the Altruistic
Decision Task. Together with the lack of acquired changes
in personality in the penetrating TBI group, this observa-
tion supports the claim that cerebral regions beyond the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex must be critical for the regu-
lation of altruistic punishment and donation (Morishima
et al., 2012). The present investigation provides further de-
tails on the workings and interactions among these brain
regions.
Current limitations and opportunities
for further research
The role of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in social cog-
nition has increasingly lured researchers (Bzdok et al.,
2013). There is evidence that this region is functionally
heterogeneous in humans. For example, damage to the
septal
nuclei
and
the
anterior
dorsomedial
prefrontal
cortex was implicated in a decrease of prosocial sentiments,
while a decrease in anger and disgust followed damage to
the posterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (Moll et al.,
2011). Thus, dorsomedial prefrontal injuries may enhance
altruistic or selfish choices in economic games depending on
their location and extent. Analogous reasoning may apply
to the observation that damage to the posterior superior
temporal sulcus and neighbouring regions that resulted in
a diminished capacity for emotional empathy (Driscoll
et al., 2012). Further studies are needed to probe the dif-
ferential role of these regions and their subcortical connec-
tions in specific domains of altruistic decisions.
The role of specific white matter pathways in higher-
order social impairments has also attracted the attention
of researchers (Philippi et al., 2009). That they may have
played a part in some of our cases was indicated by the
subcortical extension of lesions that were related to the
conditions of interest (Supplementary Fig. 1). How they
might extend our findings is the subject of further lesion
studies currently underway (Cristofori et al., 2015).
It might be surprising that changes in personality were
not observed in the 12 patients who sustained uni- or bi-
lateral damage to the frontotemporo-insular region; in fact,
statistically
significant
personality
changes
were
not
observed in any lesion subgroup, nor were significant dif-
ferences in the core dimensions of personality found be-
tween controls and patients. The absence of personality

 changes may have been due to the small number of cases
with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and other
appropriate locations. How acquired sociopathy might
have influenced performance on the Altruistic Decision
Task remains a topic for future studies.
Finally, because of the older and exclusive male compos-
ition of our groups, little can be said about how our find-
ings could possibly apply to female or younger adults. In
view of the well-known interactions between sex and hemi-
spheric symmetries (Kimura, 1992), the cerebral underpin-
nings of female decisions on the Altruistic Decision Task
and kindred altruistic decision tasks may differ in critical
aspects (Harenski et al., 2008). These differences are also
an important topic for future studies.
To summarize, anonymous decisions to punish or donate
to societal causes are grounded in non-overlapping cerebral
regions that have also been implicated in the attribution of
intentionality, morality, and justice both to individuals and
social groups. Further refinement of the model should clar-
ify the details of the neural organization of the many forms
of altruism through experimental manipulations of context,
amount and types of investment, diagnosis, and specific
populations. In addition, the measurement and experimental
study of altruism should consider (i) individual dispositions
for altruism; (ii) altruistic actions towards organizations and
the societal causes they support; (iii) attitudes towards indi-
viduals; and (iv) the patterns of brain organization that
underpin (i–iii). Our study provides a step forward in this
direction by showing that different brain regions are caus-
ally implicated in the anonymous sacrifice of one’s own re-
sources to punish or benefit genuine societal causes.
