T
here has been a rise in rates of multiple births in many 
high-income countries, with a doubling of twin births and 
a threefold increase in triplet births in recent decades.1,2 
In Canada, rates of triplet and higher order multiple births have 
increased from 52.2 to 83.5 per 100 000 live births between 1991 
and 2009.1 This change has occurred primarily because of in-
creases in maternal age at delivery, and especially because of in-
creased use of fertility treatments such as ovulation induction 
and related assisted reproductive technologies.3 Despite the ad-
vances in clinical care that have improved perinatal outcomes for 
multifetal gestation,4 twin pregnancies, and especially triplet and 
higher order multiple pregnancies, continue to experience ele-
vated risks of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.1,2,5,6
Although it is accepted that elective fetal reduction of high-
order multiple pregnancy with 4 or more fetuses substantially 
improves maternal and perinatal outcomes, fetal reduction is 
sometimes viewed as a social rather than a medical issue.2,7,8 Fur-
thermore, studies comparing triplet pregnancies reduced to twins 
and triplet pregnancies managed conservatively have reported 
conflicting results: some have shown no difference in gestational 
age at delivery or in neonatal outcomes,7,9 whereas others have 
reported substantial improvements in perinatal outcomes.2,10,11 
Perhaps the most provocative unanswered question pertains to 
fetal reduction in twin pregnancies. We therefore compared peri-
natal outcomes in multifetal pregnancies with fetal reduction (to 
twin or singleton pregnancy) and without fetal reduction.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: There is currently insuffi-
cient evidence regarding the prognosis 
of multifetal pregnancy following elec-
tive fetal reduction to twin or singleton 
pregnancy. We compared perinatal out-
comes in pregnancies with and without 
fetal reduction.
METHODS: We used data on all still-
births and live births in British Colum-
bia, Canada, from 2009 to 2013. We 
compared outcomes of multifetal preg-
nancies with fetal reduction (to twin or 
singleton pregnancy) with outcomes of 
pregnancies without fetal reduction. 
The primary outcome was a composite 
of serious neonatal morbidity or peri-
natal death. Other outcomes studied 
included preterm birth, low birth weight 
and small-for-gestational-age live birth.
RESULTS: The rate of serious neonatal 
morbidity or perinatal death did not dif-
fer significantly between pregnancies 
reduced to twins and unreduced triplet 
pregnancies (adjusted rate ratio 0.50, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–1.07) 
or between pregnancies reduced to sin-
gletons and unreduced twin pregnan-
cies (adjusted rate ratio 1.57, 95% CI 
0.74−3.33). The rate was significantly 
lower in the fetal reduction group re-
duced to twins versus unreduced triplet 
pregnancies when we restricted the 
analysis to pregnancies conceived fol-
lowing the use of assisted reproduction 
technologies (adjusted rate ratio 0.35, 
95% CI 0.18–0.67). The rates of preterm 
birth, very preterm birth, low birth 
weight and very low birth weight were 
significantly lower among pregnancies 
reduced to twins than among unre-
duced triplet pregnancies. Compared 
with unreduced twin pregnancies, preg-
nancies reduced to singletons had 
lower rates of preterm birth and low 
birth weight.
INTERPRETATION: Fetal reduction to 
twins and singletons was not associated 
with a decreased risk of serious neona-
tal morbidity or perinatal death. How-
ever, such fetal reduction was associ-
ated with substantial improvements in 
several other perinatal outcomes, such 
as preterm birth and low birth weight. 
Clinicians discussing the risks associ-
ated with multifetal pregnancy should 
counsel parents on the potential risks 
and benefits of fetal reduction.

singleton pregnancy in British Columbia, Canada, from April 
2009 to December 2013. The comparison group consisted of all 
births between April 2009 and December 2013 to women with 
triplet, twin or singleton pregnancies who did not undergo elec-
tive fetal reduction. Information on these births was obtained 
from the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry. This popula-
tion-based, clinically focused database includes abstracted 
medical records with details regarding maternal characteristics, 
and prenatal, labour, delivery and neonatal events from more 
than 99% of live births and stillbirths (including home births) in 
the province.12 Diagnoses and interventions in this database are 
coded with the use of the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 10th revision, Canadian modification (ICD-10-CA) and the 
Canadian Classification of Interventions, respectively. Data 
quality is continually assessed by logic and consistency checks, 
and the information in the database has been validated13 and 
used extensively for health planning and research purposes.13–17
Beginning in 2009, fetal reduction procedures have been iden-
tified using the ICD-10-CA code for “continuing pregnancy after 
selective fetal reduction of one fetus or more” (code O31.12). We 
used this code to identify women who underwent a fetal reduc-
tion. In addition, we reviewed the medical charts of women 
undergoing fetal reduction between 2009 and 2013 at the BC 
Women’s Hospital and Health Centre (the institution where most 
fetal reductions in the province are performed).
Outcome measures
The primary study outcome was a composite of stillbirth, in-
hospital neonatal death and serious neonatal morbidity. Serious 
neonatal morbidity included any of the following: a 5-minute 
 
Apgar score of 3 or less, neonatal convulsions, use of assisted ven-
tilation, neonatal sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, grade 3 or 4 intraven-
tricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia and neonatal 
 
encephalopathy.18,19 Other outcomes studied included preterm 
birth (< 37 completed weeks’ gestation), very preterm birth (< 32 
completed weeks’ gestation), small-for-gestational-age live birth 
(< 10th centile),20 low birth weight (< 2500 g), very low birth weight 
(< 1500 g) and low 5-minute Apgar score (≤ 7). Gestational age at 
delivery was determined with the use of a hierarchical algorithm 
based on the date of last menstrual period, earliest ultrasound be-
fore 20 weeks’ gestation, pediatric examination of the newborn 
and other documentation in the medical charts.
Statistical analysis
We compared differences in maternal characteristics between 
women who underwent fetal reduction and those who did not. 
We compared multifetal pregnancies reduced to twin pregnan-
cies with unreduced triplet pregnancies, and pregnancies re-
duced to singleton pregnancies with unreduced twin pregnan-
cies. We used multivariable log-linear regression models with 
robust variance estimates to determine the association between 
peri 
natal outcomes and fetal reduction among pregnancies in the 
entire cohort and among pregnancies conceived following the 
use of assisted reproductive technologies. Contrasts of interest 
were quantified with adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs), with adjustment for potential confounders. The full 
models included maternal age at delivery, parity, pre-pregnancy 
weight, socioeconomic status (based on neighbourhood income 
data obtained from the 2006 Canada census), receipt of assisted 
reproduction and infant sex.
We conducted supplementary analyses comparing pregnan-
cies reduced to twin pregnancies with unreduced twin pregnan-
cies; pregnancies reduced to twin pregnancies with pregnancies 
reduced to singleton pregnancies; and pregnancies reduced to 
singleton pregnancies with unreduced singleton pregnancies. 
Analyses were performed with the use of SAS version 9.2 (SAS 
Institute Inc.).
Ethics approval
The University of British Columbia’s Clinical Research Ethics 
Board approved the study.
Results
Among 208 827 women who delivered in British Columbia 
between 2009 and 2013, 95 (0.04%) underwent fetal reduction. 
Of these, 45 women delivered twins and 50 delivered singletons 
(Figure 1). Women who had a fetal reduction were more likely to 
be older and have a higher socioeconomic status than those 
without a fetal reduction(Table 1). Maternal pre-pregnancy 
weight and parity were comparable between the 2 groups, but 
women who had a fetal reduction to twins had higher rates of 
gestational diabetes and hypertension in pregnancy than women 
who did not have fetal reduction. Women who had a fetal reduc-
tion were substantially more likely to have used assisted repro-
ductive technologies than were those who did not undergo fetal 
reduction (> 75% v. 3.3%). Our review of charts from the BC 
Women’s Hospital and Health Centre showed that 44% of the 
fetal reductions during the study period were from triplets to 
twins, 46% were from twins to singletons, 4% were from triplets 
to singletons, and 6% were from quadruplets to twins.
Characteristics of infants delivered to women with and without 
fetal reduction are shown in Table 2. The median gestational age 
at delivery was higher among pregnancies reduced to twins 
(36 wk, interquartile range [IQR] 33–37 wk) than among unreduced 
triplet pregnancies (32 wk, IQR 28–33 wk) (p < 0.001). Very preterm 
birth occurred less frequently among pregnancies reduced to 
twins (16.9%) than among unreduced triplet pregnancies (47.5%), 
but more frequently than among pregnancies reduced to single-
tons (14.0%). Preterm birth was significantly more frequent among 
pregnancies reduced to twins (61.8%) than among pregnancies 
reduced to singletons (26.0%). Pregnancies reduced to twins had 
significantly fewer infants with low birth weight (57.3%) compared 
with unreduced triplet pregnancies (96.7%). Small-for-gestational-
age live birth was significantly more frequent among pregnancies 
reduced to twins (28.1%) than among unreduced triplet (15.0%) 
and unreduced twin (19.2%) pregnancies. Perinatal death 
occurred in 5.6% of pregnancies reduced to twins, as compared 
with 10.0% of unreduced triplet pregnancies and 2.4% of unre-
duced twin pregnancies. None of the infants from pregnancies 
reduced to singletons died in the neonatal period.

The proportion of pregnancies that had the composite out-
come of serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death was lower 
among those with fetal reduction (15.7% among pregnancies 
reduced to twins and 14.0% among those reduced to singletons) 
than among unreduced triplet pregnancies (33.3%), but higher 
than the proportion among unreduced twin pregnancies (9.2%) 
and unreduced singleton pregnancies (2.1%) (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the crude and adjusted rate ratios of perinatal 
outcomes among pregnancies following fetal reduction com-
pared with pregnancies without fetal reduction. Pregnancies 
reduced to twins had significantly lower adjusted rates of pre-
term birth, very preterm birth, low birth weight and very low 
birth weight, and a significantly higher adjusted rate of small-for-
gestational-age live birth, than unreduced triplet pregnancies. 
The rate of serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death did not 
differ significantly between the 2 groups (adjusted rate ratio 0.50, 
95% CI 0.24−1.07). The rate was significantly lower among preg-
nancies reduced to twins when we restricted the analysis to 
pregnancies conceived following the use of assisted reproduc-
tion technologies, with a 65% reduction in the rate of serious 
neonatal morbidity or perinatal death associated with fetal 
reduction (adjusted rate ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.18–0.67; Table 3).
Pregnancies reduced to singletons had significantly lower 
adjusted rates of preterm birth (adjusted rate ratio 0.40, 95% CI 
0.25–0.66) and low birth weight (adjusted rate ratio 0.51, 95% CI 
0.32–0.82) than unreduced twin pregnancies (Table 3). Rates of 
serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, very preterm birth 
and small-for-gestational-age live birth did not differ significantly 
between pregnancies reduced to singletons and unreduced twin 
pregnancies. The findings were similar in the analysis restricted 
to pregnancies conceived following the use of assisted reproduc-
tion technologies (Table 3).
Supplementary analyses showed that the rates of very low 
birth weight and serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death 
were significantly higher among pregnancies reduced to twins 
than among unreduced twin pregnancies (Appendix 1, available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160722/-/DC1]). 
Compared with pregnancies reduced to singletons, those re-
duced to twins had significantly higher rates of preterm birth and 
low birth weight, whereas the 2 groups had similar rates of small-
for-gestational-age live birth and very preterm birth. Rates of all 
perinatal outcomes were significantly higher among pregnancies 
reduced to singletons than among unreduced singleton pregnan-
cies (Appendix 1).
Interpretation
Our population-based study showed that the composite out-
come of serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death was not 
significantly lower among pregnancies reduced to twins com-
pared with unreduced triplet pregnancies, or among pregnancies 
reduced to singletons compared with unreduced twin pregnan-
cies. However, the composite outcome was significantly lower in 
the fetal reduction groups when we restricted the analyses to 
pregnancies conceived following the use of assisted reproduc-
tion technologies. Furthermore, pregnancies reduced to twins

had significantly lower rates of preterm birth, very preterm birth, 
low birth weight and very low birth weight than unreduced trip-
let pregnancies. Our study also showed that the rates of preterm 
birth and low birth weight were lower among multifetal pregnan-
cies reduced to singleton pregnancies than among unreduced 
twin pregnancies. The improved perinatal outcomes of pregnan-
cies reduced to twins and singletons approached, but did not 
quite achieve, the rates of perinatal complications and death 
observed among unreduced twin and unreduced singleton preg-
nancies, respectively.
Previous studies have shown that fetal reduction to twin 
pregnancy was associated with reduced rates of preterm birth 
and low birth weight and no increase in pregnancy loss com-
pared with unreduced triplet pregnancies.2,10,11 Pregnancy losses 
following fetal reduction have fallen (from previously docu-
mented rates of about 12%21) mainly because of better resolu-
tion ultrasound and increased expertise of fetal medicine spe-
cialists performing the fetal reduction.2,22,23 Rates of perinatal 
death in our study population were consistent with those in 
studies that reported a decrease in perinatal mortality after fetal 
reduction in triplet pregnancy from 11% to 6%,24,25 with triplet 
pregnancies reduced to twins doing almost as well as unre-
duced twin pregnancies. Nevertheless, clinicians counselling 
women with multifetal pregnancy should be aware of the poten-
tial for substantial parental stress resulting from fetal reduction 
procedures, including negative feelings such as guilt, regret and 
grief.26 Our finding of a higher rate of small-for-gestational-age

unreduced triplet pregnancies was likely a consequence of 
growth restriction increasing with advancing gestational age 
and the higher frequency of preterm deliveries among triplet 
pregnancies.27
Our results showed that fetal reduction to singleton preg-
nancy was associated with lower rates of preterm birth and low 
birth weight compared with unreduced twin pregnancies. Previ-
ous studies have reported a higher risk of miscarriage among 
triplet pregnancies reduced to singleton pregnancies than 
among triplet pregnancies reduced to twin pregnancies (6% v. 
4%).7,28 However, even in these studies, the risk of preterm birth 
and infant morbidity was significantly reduced among the triplet 
pregnancies reduced to singleton pregnancies.2,8,23 Also, more 
recent studies showed that reduction of triplet pregnancy to sin-
gleton rather than to twin pregnancy was associated with higher 
rates of term delivery and improved perinatal outcomes, without 
a significant difference in fetal loss rates.8,23,29 The higher rate of 
adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies is typically a 
consequence of the higher incidence of preterm delivery.29,30 
 
Clinicians report that practice changes related to fetal reduction 
in multifetal pregnancy are driven mainly by well-informed 
patients who are aware of safety and efficacy issues based on 
Internet publications. 
In our study, rates of adverse perinatal outcomes, such as 
serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death, were higher 
among pregnancies reduced to singletons than among unre-
duced singleton pregnancies. This difference was likely because 
the multifetal pregnancies were conceived with in vitro fertiliza-
tion following a diagnosis of infertility.31 Although fetal reduc-
tion to a singleton pregnancy will have beneficial effects on 
maternal and perinatal outcomes, the risk of mortality and mor-
bidity will not approach that typical of an unreduced singleton 
pregnancy because of risks associated with infertility and 
related factors.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of our study include the use of a previously vali-
dated and clinically focused database that included information 
on elective fetal reduction. The population-based nature of our 
study is also an important strength, as are the clinically relevant 
contrasts that provide information for women with multifetal 
pregnancy contemplating different options.
The limitations of our study include the lack of detail on mis-
carriage before 20 weeks’ gestation and on the fetal reduction 
itself, including the number of fetuses reduced, the timing of 
fetal reduction and any clinical indications for reduction (e.g., 
chromosomal or anatomic abnormality). Also, we did not have 
information on chorionicity, although chorionicity consider-
ations do not appear to substantially influence outcomes fol-
lowing fetal reduction.2 In addition, the risk of miscarriage and 
preterm birth does not seem to be influenced by the starting 
number of fetuses.23 The ICD-10-CA code used to identify fetal 
reductions has not been validated, although our numbers are 
consistent with those from the BC Women’s Hospital and Health 
Centre, where more than 90% of such procedures in the prov-
ince are performed. Residual confounding may have occurred 
owing to factors not available in our data sources (e.g., maternal 
education) or imprecise measurement of factors such as socio-
economic status.
Conclusion
Our study showed that the composite outcome of serious neonatal 
morbidity or perinatal death was not significantly lower among 
multifetal pregnancies reduced to twins compared with unreduced

singletons compared with unreduced twin pregnancies. However, 
fetal reduction to twins was associated with lower rates of preterm 
birth, very preterm birth, low birth weight and very low birth 
weight, and fetal reduction to singletons was associated with lower 
rates of preterm birth and low birth weight. Clinicians discussing 
the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy should counsel par-
ents on the potential risks and benefits of fetal reduction.
