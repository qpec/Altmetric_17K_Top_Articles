Summary
Background Snakebite envenoming is a frequently overlooked cause of mortality and morbidity. Data for snake 
ecology and existing snakebite interventions are scarce, limiting accurate burden estimation initiatives. Low global 
awareness stunts new interventions, adequate health resources, and available health care. Therefore, we aimed to 
synthesise currently available data to identify the most vulnerable populations at risk of snakebite, and where 
additional data to manage this global problem are needed.
Methods We assembled a list of snake species using WHO guidelines. Where relevant, we obtained expert opinion 
range (EOR) maps from WHO or the Clinical Toxinology Resources. We also obtained occurrence data for each snake 
species from a variety of websites, such as VertNet and iNaturalist, using the spocc R package (version 0.7.0). We 
removed duplicate occurrence data and categorised snakes into three groups: group A (no available EOR map or 
species occurrence records), group B (EOR map but <5 species occurrence records), and group C (EOR map and 
≥5 species occurrence records). For group C species, we did a multivariate environmental similarity analysis using 
the 2008 WHO EOR maps and newly available evidence. Using these data and the EOR maps, we produced 
contemporary range maps for medically important venomous snake species at a 5 × 5 km resolution. We subsequently 
triangulated these data with three health system metrics (antivenom availability, accessibility to urban centres, and 
the Healthcare Access and Quality [HAQ] Index) to identify the populations most vulnerable to snakebite morbidity 
and mortality.
Findings We provide a map showing the ranges of 278 snake species globally. Although about 6·85 billion people 
worldwide live within range of areas inhabited by snakes, about 146·70 million live within remote areas lacking 
quality health-care provisioning. Comparing opposite ends of the HAQ Index, 272·91 million individuals (65·25%) of 
the population within the lowest decile are at risk of exposure to any snake for which no effective therapy exists 
compared with 519·46 million individuals (27·79%) within the highest HAQ Index decile, showing a disproportionate 
coverage in reported antivenom availability. Antivenoms were available for 119 (43%) of 278 snake species evaluated 
by WHO, while globally 750·19 million (10·95%) of those living within snake ranges live more than 1 h from 
population centres. In total, we identify about 92·66 million people living within these vulnerable geographies, 
including many sub-Saharan countries, Indonesia, and other parts of southeast Asia.
Interpretation Identifying exact populations vulnerable to the most severe outcomes of snakebite envenoming at a 
subnational level is important for prioritising new data collection and collation, reinforcing envenoming treatment, 
existing health-care systems, and deploying currently available and future interventions. These maps can guide future 
research efforts on snakebite envenoming from both ecological and public health perspectives and better target future 
estimates of the burden of this neglected tropical disease.

Introduction
Snakebite envenoming is a frequently overlooked 
cause of mortality and morbidity, responsible for 
81 000–138 000 deaths annually,1,2 and between 421 000 and 
1·2 million envenomings.3 Contact from venomous 
snakes, spiders, and scorpions contribute to 1·2 million 
years of life lived with disability annually.4 The burden 
remains poorly characterised because of under-reporting; 
as snakebite is rarely notifiable, existing estimates are 
typically derived from extrapolated hospital records 
and community surveys.5 Snakebite primarily affects the 
poor rural communities of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, 
where socioeconomic status and agricultural and other 
practices contribute to increased snake–human inter-
action.6 Venomous snakebites can also inflict a heavy 
burden on livestock, creating economic hardship for 
already impoverished communities.7 Medically important 
snake species, however, have a cosmopolitan distribution, 
making snakebite a global challenge.3
In June, 2017, snakebite envenoming was classified as a 
category A neglected tropical disease,8,9 and was 
the subject of a resolution passed by the World Health

Assembly in May, 2018. Consequently, there is a renewed 
impetus to accurately assess the burden and distribution 
of snakebite to ensure appropriate prevention and control 
interventions are implemented, and that adequate 
resources and funding are allocated nationally and 
subnationally.10,11 For other neglected tropical diseases, 
substantive global targets exist: Sustainable Development 
Goal target 3·3 aims to “end the epidemics” of these 
diseases by 2030,12,13 with routine reporting, surveillance, 
and notification architecture in place. As a new neglected 
tropical disease, snakebite monitoring and evaluation 
should reflect these objectives.
Data for the presence of venomous snakes and 
occurrence of snakebites are sparse and incomplete 
at the global level, making estimation challenging.14,15 
Although some countries have done household-level 
surveys to determine the incidence of snakebites,14,15 
the global magnitude of this disease remains poorly 
characterised. Snakebite envenoming represents an 
interesting One Health challenge requiring clinical, 
ecological, and public health expertise. Consequently, this 
issue can be approached by considering vulnerability to 
snakebite envenoming as a nexus of ecological contexts 
and public health weaknesses, to provide an evidence 
base for targeting future quantitative studies.
Clinical challenges involve appropriate case diagnosis 
and adequate provisioning of care whether supportive 
(such as ventilators) or direct treatment with antivenom, 
which might not be available at any given point of 
care.2,16 Ascertainment of the correct antivenom can be 
challenging,17 and current diagnostics can be expensive 
and slow.18,19 Furthermore, nearly half of venomous snakes 
do not have antivenoms available as tracked by WHO.2,20 
To comprehensively address snakebites, these clinical 
challenges need to be considered within an ecological 
context by understanding snake behaviour and life-history 
traits that contribute to the frequency and geographical 
distribution of snakebites. Therefore, by contextualising 
contemporary knowledge about snake distributions with 
indicators of the quality of health-care provisioning,21 
the accessibility of these resources,22 and antivenom 
availability,20 we aimed to identify populations vulnerable 
to the worst health outcomes of an envenoming event.
Methods
Study overview
We evaluated range maps for 278 snakes to consider 
their presence at a 5 × 5 km (grid cell) resolution. To 
identify the most vulnerable populations, this ecological 
information was paired with three key metrics: the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Snakebite envenoming is a category A neglected tropical disease 
of particular public health importance in tropical areas of Africa, 
Asia, Latin America, and Papua New Guinea. It is estimated that 
up to 1·2 million people are envenomed annually, resulting in 
81 000–138 000 fatalities. Although effective therapies exist to 
treat envenoming by some snakes of highest medical 
importance, there are many species without such treatments. 
The global distribution of venomous snakes and vulnerable 
populations remains inadequately characterised; therefore, the 
lack of knowledge of subnational disease burden might impede 
production of antivenom supplies and distribution efforts 
among populations currently at risk. To investigate this further, 
we searched for articles on PubMed published before 
March 1, 2017, using the search terms “snakebite”, “distribution”, 
and “burden”. Contemporary studies have investigated 
venomous snake distributions and snakebite risk at national 
levels (several countries in Latin America) or subnational levels 
(India, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka), but these studies did not 
encompass all medically important snake species and are limited 
in both geographical extent and spatial resolution. A more 
recent analysis mapped the distribution of venomous snakes in 
Central America and Latin America but was restricted to widely 
studied species with ample occurrence data. Although an 
important start, no study has coupled global ecological 
information about snake distributions with measures relating to 
public health capabilities to hone in on populations most 
vulnerable to this cause of mortality and morbidity.
Added value of this study
We identified populations most vulnerable to 278 medically 
important snake species by using expert opinion, species’ ranges 
refined by publicly available occurrence data and multivariate 
analyses, information about effective therapies, and metrics of 
health-care quality and accessibility. Although a large proportion 
of the world’s population live in areas where such snakes could be 
present, proxy metrics such as the Healthcare Access and Quality 
Index and urban accessibility paired with broad-scale information 
about market antivenom availability provide a subnationally 
resolved yet globally comprehensive picture of vulnerability, 
highlighting populations that could be most affected.
Implications of all the available evidence
We highlight locations where the combination of the presence 
of a variety of venomous snakes, inequalities in health care and 
accessibility, and possible absence of effective therapy might 
contribute toward increased vulnerability of snakebite 
envenoming. Our analyses can be used to inform the 
positioning of local-scale household surveys to assess the true 
risk of snakebite in areas where such estimates are currently 
inadequate. This study highlights the importance of continuing 
to iterate, improve, and re-evaluate existing geographical 
assessments of snake distributions, and the need to incorporate 
spatially heterogeneous risk within future burden estimation 
efforts. This work is a first step in trying to identify and assist 
the most neglected populations of this newly designated 
neglected tropical disease.

market availability of antivenom therapies as reported 
by WHO,20 accessibility to urban centres as a proxy for 
access to health care,22 and the Healthcare Access and 
Quality (HAQ) Index as a proxy for adequacy and 
efficacy of medical interventions at health-care centres.21 
Figure 1 shows conceptually how populations lacking in 
all these measures should be seen as the most vulnerable 
populations, and how these measures could vary 
geographically.
Global list of snake species
We assembled a list of snake species, using WHO 
guidelines for venomous snake species of medical 
importance (hereafter referred to as snakes),23 which 
define two tiers of medical importance that reflect 
both ecological knowledge on propensity to interact 
with humans and clinical grading of toxicity. Category 
one species are common or widespread snakes that 
result in high morbidity, disability, or mortality. Cate-
gory two species are snakes capable of causing mor-
bidity, disability, or death, or for which epidemiological 
or clinical data are missing or are less frequently 
implicated.
Where relevant, expert opinion range (EOR) maps 
were obtained from WHO blood products online 
database or the Clinical Toxinology Resources data-
base.20,24 Occurrence data for each species were obtained 
from the Global Biodiversity Information Framework, 
VertNet (version 2016-09-29), iNaturalist, iDigBio, and 
Ecoengine, using the spocc R package (version 0.7
.0) on 
May 29, 2017
.25 Duplicate records based upon shared 
collection year and latitude or longitude and those 
missing latitude or longitude were removed.
Given the availability of data, we placed snakes into 
three groups: group A (no available EOR map or species 
occurrence records), group B (EOR map but <5 species 
occurrence records), and group C (EOR map and 
≥5 species occurrence records). Group A species (n=9) 
were excluded from this analysis because of the absence 
of geographical information, reducing our species 
inclusion list to 278 (99 group B species and 179 group C 
species; appendix 1).
Multivariate environmental similarity surface 
generation and species’ ranges
For group C species with sufficient occurrence records, 
potential updates to the EOR maps were assessed. EOR 
maps were updated with data that has become publicly 
accessible since publication of the WHO EOR maps in 
2008. Multivariate environmental similarity method was 
applied to the occurrence records obtained for group C 
species, situated within the EOR, allowing for rapid 
classification of occurrence records outside of the EOR 
within the environmental range of other records (ie, 
interpolation) or beyond these limits (ie, extrapolation). 
Multivariate environmental similarity surfaces (MESS) 
measure the similarity between new environments 
(records outside of the EOR) and those in the training 
sample (records within the EOR), by identifying the 
maximum and minimum values of environmental data 
within the training sample, with respect to a set of 
predictor variables (covariates).26 We fitted species-specific 
MESS using occurrence records within the EOR, and 
eight bioclimatic covariates thought to influence snake 
distribution (appendix 2 provides information about the 
MESS parameters and covariate specifics).
Figure 1: Conceptual overview of vulnerability to snakebite envenoming
(A) Vulnerability can be considered as the intersection of populations who live 
within the range of venomous snakes that have no antivenoms available, 
cannot easily access health care, and have poor quality health care in delivery of 
antivenoms or ensuring necessary stocks. The intersection of all three defines 
the most vulnerable populations. (B) These factors vary in space. By overlaying 
these features, the most vulnerable populations can be identified spatially 
(represented here by the boxes outlined in black).

Occurrence records outside of the currently accepted 
EOR were overlaid on top of each species-specific threshold 
MESS. Records located within cells of environ 
mental 
interpolation (termed MESS-positive) were considered 
valid records of species occurrence. Proposed ranges 
were developed to encompass all valid MESS-positive 
records, generated by applying a buffer radius of 0·898° 
(approx 
imately 100 km at the equator) to each MESS-
positive record to address potential movement of species, 
and possible geopositioning errors.27,28 Buffered locations 
were masked by the threshold MESS to remove areas 
of environmental extrapolation, and merged with the 
currently accepted EOR to produce a proposed con-
temporary range.
Global distribution of snakes
To reflect the geographical diversity of the snakes 
studied, we aggregated the ranges of different species. 
Modified (ie, group C species with MESS-positive 
records [n=96]) or original EOR surfaces (group B 
and group C species with no MESS-positive records 
[n=182]) were converted into 5 × 5 km raster (gridded) 
files. They were then stacked by summing overlapping 
cell values, resulting in three composite output layers: 
a count of the number of unique category one or 
category two species per cell, or both; a count of the 
number of unique category one species per cell; and a 
count of the number of unique category two species 
per cell.

Pairing ecological measures with health system metrics
To identify the extent to which snakebites could vary 
globally as a public health problem, we evaluated three 
key dimensions: existence of any marketed antivenom 
therapy, quality of health care and treatment options 
available, and geographical accessibility to health care. 
Of the 278 snakes considered, the WHO antivenoms 
database documents that any form of antivenom (either 
monospecific or polyvalent) exists for 159 species.20 
Coupling this availability information with each species’ 
range we identified the geographical distribution of 
species with no listed antivenoms, stratified by WHO 
category.
To address differences in health-care quality and 
therefore identify populations to whom treatment 
options might not be available or effectively deployed, 
we categorised countries or regions to identify 
populations living within each decile of a composite 
indicator measure of health care (ie, the HAQ Index).21 
The HAQ Index provides a metric for national levels of 
personal health-care access and quality, drawing from 
mortality rates from 32 causes that are amenable to 
health care. The Index uses risk-standardised cause-
specific mortality rates derived from the Global Burden 
of Disease 2016 study,29 scaled to a common 0–100 value, 
and aggregated using weights derived from a principal 
component analysis. To construct deciles, countries 
were ranked on the basis of the HAQ Index score, and 
threshold values splitting countries into ten equally 
sized groups were identified. Because of variable 
numbers of administrative units, subnational locations 
were 
not 
used 
to 
construct 
decile 
thresholds; 
subnationals for which HAQ values were estimated 
were assigned to the corresponding nationally derived 
decile on the basis of their value. To evaluate the 
appropriateness of the HAQ Index as a proxy metric for 
severe snakebite-related outcomes, we analysed the 
relationship between published estimates of snakebite-
specific mortality numbers and the index, mimicking 
analyses undertaken on other development indices and 
mortality outcomes.6
To reflect relative geographical isolation from health 
care, we coupled mortality data with a contemporary 
surface of accessibility to major population centres. 
Habib and Abubakar30 identified that, for a Nigerian 
cohort of cases, each hour delay between envenomation 
and antivenom administration was associated with 
an increased mortality outcome of 1·01% (95% CI 
1·00–1·02).30 A contemporary surface of accessibility to 
high-density urban locations (travel time in minutes to 
locations with a population >50 000) was used to identify 
remote populations and compared with the mortality 
statistics above.22 To evaluate the suitability of a 
population–centre-based metric versus a health-care-
focused measure, we did a sensitivity analysis using 
published data for African health-care facilities.31
Populations living within these geographical regions of 
vulnerability were enumerated using the most recent 
gridded population estimates from WorldPop, producing 
estimates at the 5 × 5 km pixel level, and aggregated to 
each country’s second-level administrative division 
aiding government interpretation.32

Results
Through the combination of publicly available data, we 
provide a surface showing the ranges of 278 snake 
species per 5 × 5 km area globally. Our MESS validation 
method resulted in range amendments of 96 species 
(appendix 1). Given the broad distribution of snakes, 
approximately 6·85 billion people live within the range 
of one or more of the species considered (figure 2A). 
When filtered by medical classification, 5·80 billion 
people live within range of category one species and 
5·53 billion people live within range of category 
two species (appendix 2 pp 13, 14). Hotspots of venomous 
snake diversity include the Congo Basin, southeast Asia, 
and Latin America.
Using the only openly available database for antivenom 
availability, we identified 119 (43%) of the 278 mapped 
species with no specific therapy. Of these identified 
species, 24 (20%) were category one importance and 
95 (80%) were category two importance. Hotspots of 
species with no listed antivenom occur throughout 
west Africa (eg, Ghana has ≤7 species per cell), 
central Africa (eg, Cameroon has ≤7 species per cell), 
South America (eg, Colombia has ≤7 species per cell), and 
south Asia (eg, India has ≤6 species per cell; figure 2B; 
appendix 2 pp 15, 16). Among category one snake species 
with no therapy, Myanmar and Bangladesh have the 
highest number (≤3 species per cell), with areas in 
west Africa (Mali, Senegal, and Guinea) and Namibia 
having up to two therapy-naive species per cell.
Populations living within these ranges of snake species 
vary greatly in terms of accessibility to population centres 
and presumed health care. Although antivenoms are 
deployed in health facilities of some countries with very 
small communities, this deployment is not universal, and 
in the absence of exact data for antivenom access, we 
were required to approximate the influence of travelling 
time to health-care facilities via a proxy of distance to 
centres with more than 50 000 inhabitants. Our time-
delay surface highlights that should envenoming 
occur in large areas of Sudan, Algeria, Indonesia, 
Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Peru, the time taken 
to travel to a city in which we might expect to find available 
treatment could worsen mortality outcomes by more than 
25%, assuming linear scaling of the statistic from Habib 
and Abubakar30 (figure 3). For instance, 2 531 665 people 
(78·71% of the population) live within ranges of any 
snake species within South Sudan and 624 204 people 
(89·89% of the population) in Papua New Guinea live 
more than 1 h from locations with 50 000 people or more 
(appendix 2 pp 17–26); globally, 750·19 million people 
(10·95% of the population) potentially at risk from 
snakebite envenoming live more than 1 h from high-
density urban areas, increasing the likelihood of delay-
based mortality outcomes after envenoming.
Sensitivity analyses using African hospitals versus cities 
similarly showed consistent results (appendix 2 pp 34, 35).
Separating the populations living within ranges of 
species by HAQ Index deciles reveals large differen 
ces 
across the sociodemographic spectrum (figure 4). 
Such differences are best highlighted when analysing 
populations by medical classification: approximately 
389·58 million individuals (92·91%) of the population 
within the lowest HAQ Index decile are at risk of exposure 
to a category one snake compared with approximately 
1·61 billion individuals (86·27%) within the highest decile 
(appendix 2 p 16). Furthermore, 272·91 million individuals 
(65·25%) of the population within the lowest decile are at 
risk of exposure to any snake for which no effective 
therapy exists compared with 519·46 million individuals 
(27·79%) within the highest HAQ Index decile (figure 4).
Vulnerable populations (ie, people in geographical reg-
ions living within the range of any snake species who also 
lived more than 3 h away from major urban centres, had 
health systems that scored within the lowest three deciles

of the HAQ Index, and were further stratified by the 
presence or absence of a WHO listed antivenom) are 
highlighted in figure 5. Vulnerability estimates for HAQ 
Index deciles of 1–10 are provided in the table. Within the 
lowest three deciles, we highlighted regions where about 
92·66 million vulnerable individuals live (table), with 
Angola, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo ranking as the highest locations 
in absolute numbers. The majority of countries across 
Africa, many of which have some of the lowest scores on 
the HAQ Index, have vulnerable populations present. 
When excluding infor 
mation about the existence of 
antivenoms, 146·70 million people live within remote 
areas lacking quality health care provisioning (deciles 1–3; 
appendix 2 pp 28–31).
Discussion
Understanding the distribution of venomous snakes and 
their potential burden on health systems at national, 
regional, and global levels is important for effective re-
duction and control of snakebite.8 By combining species’ 
range maps, available information about antivenoms, and 
measures of quality of and distance to health care, this 
study provides global contemporary maps of vulnerable 
populations to snakebite and its clinical complications. 
This analysis, therefore, provides a means of identifying 
communities in greatest need of support from herpe-
tologists, clinicians, and public health experts, and to 
prioritise new data-collection activities.
Although this analysis is not a substitute for a full global 
burden estimation, there is overlap between vulnerable 
communities and existing burden estimates, with vulner-
able countries such as Nigeria, Benin, Congo (Brazzaville), 
Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea identified as burden-
some in country-specific estimates,1 and south Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa as regions with considerable mort-
ality and morbidity.3 A post-hoc analysis of national 
envenoming and death burden values, shows that, for 
vulnerable countries, such values were more likely to be 
estimates as opposed to data-driven numbers (χ² test at 
90% significance level, p=0·0476 for envenoming and 
p=0·0517 for deaths).3 Chippaux33 similarly shows that 
where data are available in sub-Saharan countries, they 
are not necessarily contemporary information. These

maps collate ecological and public health metrics, and 
identify opportunities where substantial improvements 
and refinements can be undertaken to move from 
broad vulnerability assessment to a more nuanced 
and accurate description of the most burdensome 
populations.
Our study had key limitations, and future efforts can 
focus on addressing some of these limitations: the relative 
contribution of different snake species must be quantified, 
the factors influencing snake–human interactions and 
subsequent likelihood of envenoming events must be 
identified, and snakebite-specific measures of local 
preparedness, effectiveness, and coverage of existing 
clinical countermeasures must be taken. Paucity of data 
available at the global scale, despite comprehensive 
coverage in several high-income countries, remains one 
of the largest limitations throughout this study. Ultimately, 
quantifying these additional components will allow for 
estimates to be based on a bottom-up data synthesis, 
rather than dependence on global-level datasets and 
correlations.
Mapping snake species’ locations to reflect variations in 
snake presence is also important. Fine-scale maps, such as 
those of American venomous snake species,34 should be 
extended 
globally—this 
current 
analysis 
identifies 
216 species requiring updated assessments of current 
ranges given the quality and quantity of records available. 
This study also establishes a systematic prioritisation 
based on medical importance (appendix 2 pp 3–11). 
Although species occurrence surveys can be formally 
done by public health initiatives or during ecological 
assessments, citizen science has a complementary role 
in facilitating broad-scale data collection.35
This assessment considers the presence of any one 
venomous snake as a prerequisite for vulnerability; 
however, different species contribute differently to 
envenoming risk. Species with a very high incidence of 
envenoming events might be the dominant cause of high 
snakebite burden in a locality,36 regardless of the presence 
of other species,37 as reported for Echis ocellatus,38 Daboia 
russelii,39 and others.40 Identifying and quantifying, at a 
local scale, important species, risky human practices, 
and ongoing changes to subsequent interactions given 
climatic and socioeconomic change, are necessary.41 
Future vulnerability assessments can explicitly leverage 
interspecies’ differences and weigh their relative

contribution as a function of species-specific envenoming 
risk and associated burden. The transition of the 
WHO resource20 into a living database documenting 
contemporary antivenom availability, species taxonomic 
changes, higher-resolution distribution data, and other 
information will substantially aid in this effort.42,43
Areas where snakes are present can be further evaluated 
to determine the true incidence of envenoming events. 
Local-scale household surveys assessing incidence of 
snakebite have been done in several countries.11,14,15,44 
Questions relating to snakebite could also be nested within 
existing demographic and health surveys,45 minimising 
associated costs and informing current data-poor 
estimates. By integrating preventive measures with 
existing management systems for neglected tropical 
diseases, many logistical obstacles to effective intervention 
might be overcome.46 Corresponding quantification of key 
risky behaviours will help reflect fine-scale population 
heterogeneity to exposure. Surveys such as the World Bank 
Living Standards Measurement Survey series could be 
used to obtain local-scale information about agricultural 
practices,47 further aiding the identification of communities 
most at risk and increasing understanding of the public 
health consequences of different land use. Through these 
steps, efforts to prevent envenoming events can be tailored 
to the specifics of any given population.
In many low-income and middle-income countries, a 
multitude of barriers influence snakebite outcomes 
including health care, transport, and communications 
infrastructure, along with adequacy of and access to safe, 
effective, and affordable antivenom supplies, medical 
staff proficiency and training, and public health policy. 
When considering antivenom availability, this method is 
constrained to listings as reported by WHO.20 Since 
initial compilation, new antivenoms have become 
available (eg, EchiTAb-Plus-ICP),48 while others have 
ceased production (eg, Fav-Afrique by Sanofi).42 Market 
availability of antivenom products does not translate to 
in-field availability and efficacy; further information 
regarding country-specific, contemporary stockpiles, and 
the positioning of antivenom holding centres is required. 
Given that some of the countries with the lowest 
HAQ Index deciles have the largest proportions of the 
population living in areas with snakes for which no 
antivenom is currently reported, documented socio- 
economic differences might amplify inequalities in care.6 
Although health system indicators and accessibility 
metrics act as generalised correlates for a location’s 
ability to respond to cases, these measures will possibly 
underestimate or overstate local vulnerabilities in some 
settings. Existing analyses of health systems show 
variation both nationally and subnationally in treatment-
seeking behaviours,49,50 quality of primary point of care 
visits and referrals,51 and general practitioner knowledge 
about the condition.52 However, the external validity of 
these existing surveys is unknown. This vulnerability 
analysis provides a foundation for the identification of 
locations where further surveys of treatment-seeking 
behaviours, quality of care, and existing coverage of 
antivenom stockpiles and supply chains need to be 
assessed.
The global burden of snakebite can be assessed through 
an approach that integrates ecological information, human 
behavioural data, and snakebite-specific health system 
functioning. The impetus to reduce and control the burden 
of snakebite envenoming, a thorough cataloguing of snake 
presence and abundance, species-specific interaction 
profiles with humans, and detailed understanding of 
logistical hurdles to intervention delivery should be 
long-term objectives. Contemporary assessments, such as 
the resources presented, provide an immediate means of 
identifying key hotspots and most vulnerable communities 
where the need for such investigations is greatest.
