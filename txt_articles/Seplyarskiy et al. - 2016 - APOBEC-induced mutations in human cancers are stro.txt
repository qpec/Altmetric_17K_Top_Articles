APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC family, are among the main factors causing mutations in
human cancers. APOBEC deaminates cytosines in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A fraction of the APOBEC-induced mu-
tations occur as clusters (“kataegis”) in single-stranded DNA produced during repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs).
However, the properties of the remaining 87% of nonclustered APOBEC-induced mutations, the source and the genomic
distribution of the ssDNA where they occur, are largely unknown. By analyzing genomic and exomic cancer databases, we
show that >33% of dispersed APOBEC-induced mutations occur on the lagging strand during DNA replication, thus un-
raveling the major source of ssDNA targeted by APOBEC in cancer. Although methylated cytosine is generally more mu-
tation-prone than nonmethylated cytosine, we report that methylation reduces the rate of APOBEC-induced mutations by a
factor of roughly two. Finally, we show that in cancers with extensive APOBEC-induced mutagenesis, there is almost no in-
crease in mutation rates in late replicating regions (contrary to other cancers). Because late-replicating regions are depleted
in exons, this results in a 1.3-fold higher fraction of mutations residing within exons in such cancers. This study provides
novel insight into the APOBEC-induced mutagenesis and describes the peculiarity of the mutational processes in cancers
with the signature of APOBEC-induced mutations.

Carcinogenesis is associated with elevated mutation rates due to
abnormal metabolic activities in the cell, disruption of repair sys-
tems, or environmental factors such as UV light, radiation, and
chemical damage (Roberts and Gordenin 2014a,b). However,
some normal protein enzymatic activities can also be a source of
DNA damage and mutations. Recently, it was shown that some ho-
mologs of APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, cat-
alytic polypeptide-like), cytidine deaminases that function as viral
protecting agents as well as in RNA editing, may be a major factor
causing mutations in human cancers (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012; Burns
et al. 2013b; Roberts et al. 2013). Deamination of cytidine residues
by APOBEC occurs in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Nowarski
et al. 2008; Roberts et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2012). Two members
of the APOBEC family, APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, contribute
substantially to mutations in cancers (Burns et al. 2013a,b;
Roberts et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2015) by deaminating cytosines
in the TpC context (henceforth, the mutated nucleotide is under-
lined) (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012; Burns et al. 2013a,b; Roberts et al.
2013; Taylor et al. 2013; Roberts and Gordenin 2014b; Chan
et al. 2015). The APOBEC cytidine deaminase converts cytosines
to uracils, which usually results in C → T or C → G mutations,
and much less frequently, in C → A mutations (Taylor et al.
2013). The fact that the APOBEC shows the highest specificity
for the TpCpW (where W denotes A or T) context was shown in
cancer genomic studies and in experimental systems (Burns et al.
2013a,b; Roberts et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2013).
APOBEC-induced mutations are unevenly distributed along
thegenome.Forexample, underexperimentalconditionsin yeasts,
26% of them are located in clusters spanning 6–15 kb (Taylor et al.
2013, 2014). This phenomenon, called kataegis, was described for
many cancer types and is believed to be the result of APOBEC-in-
duced mutagenesis (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012; Burns et al. 2013a,b;
Robertsetal.2013).Clusteredmutationsarefrequentlystrandcoor-
dinated,i.e.,arecomprisedofmutationsintheTpCcontextthatoc-
cur in one of the two strands (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012; Roberts et al.

one strand, 13% of the clusters exhibit strand switches, e.g., when
the 5′ part of the cluster carries TpC coordinated mutations on
the forward strand, and the 3′ part, on the reverse strand (corre-
sponding to GpA mutations on the forward strand) (Roberts et al.
2012;Tayloret al.2013).It wasshown incancersandin yeastexper-

 2012; Roberts et al. 2013; Tayloret al. 2013) as a result of the activity
of exonucleases causing long stretches of ssDNA near the DSB,
which become a target for APOBEC enzymes (Roberts et al. 2012;
Taylor et al. 2013). Alternatively, it was suggested that APOBEC en-
zymes can induce DSBs (Landry et al. 2011; Burns et al. 2013a).
Another putative cause of kataegis is the expansion of ssDNA at
the 5′ upstream region of a mismatch during base excision repair
(BER) (Taylor et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014). However, the majority
of APOBEC mutations are dispersed (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012;
Roberts et al. 2012, 2013; Taylor et al. 2013), and the source of
ssDNA that may be a substrate for them in cancer still lacks explicit
mechanistic explanation.
During replication, DNA exists for some time in a single-
stranded state. Although such ssDNA should be protected by the
replication protein A (RPA), it may be a substrate for APOBEC-in-
duced deamination, especially under replication stress (Roberts
et al. 2012; Roberts and Gordenin 2014a). The lagging strand is sin-
gle-stranded for a longer period of time than the leading strand due
to discontinuous synthesis (Okazaki et al. 1968) and is also en-
riched in mutations (Reijns et al. 2015). Despite that firing of indi-
vidual replication origins is stochastic (Rhind et al. 2010), genomic
regions vary in mean time of the replication during the S phase
(Ryba et al. 2010; Pope et al. 2014) and in their propensity to be
replicated unidirectionally, and the preferential fork direction is
conserved among human tissues (Baker et al. 2012).
Here, we hypothesize that the APOBEC-induced mutagenesis
is associated with the lagging strand. By the analysis of large geno-
mic and exomic cancer data sets, we investigate the source of
ssDNA targeted by APOBEC in cancer as well as the other
APOBEC mutational properties.
Results
APOBEC mutational signatures in whole genome and whole
exome cancer data sets
To study the dispersed APOBEC-induced mutations, we used 433
whole genome–sequenced (WGS) cancers from Alexandrov et al.
(2013a) and 3000 whole exome–sequenced (WES) cancers from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/). We considered only those samples that included at least
100 single-nucleotide mutations (Supplemental Tables S1, S2).
Similarly to others (Roberts et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2015), we strati-
fied tumors by the prevalence of the dispersed APOBEC mutational
signature, calculatedastheratio(rapo)ofthefrequenciesofnonclus-
tered C → K mutations in the TpCpW and in the VpCpW contexts
(where K denotes T or G; W denotes A or T; and V denotes A, C, or
G). We excluded the APOBEC mutations in the TpCpS context
(where S denotes C or G) from the main analysis and treated them
separately.Thisenabledustoavoidabiasduetospontaneousdeam-
ination of 5-methylcytosines in the CpG context or to UV-light-in-
duced mutations in the TpCpC context (Alexandrov et al. 2013a;
Lawrence et al. 2013; Roberts and Gordenin 2014b).
In order to assess the efficacy of the chosen metric of enrich-
mentofAPOBECmutations(rapo),wefirstcomparedtheprevalence
of this APOBEC signature with the number of kataegistic clusters,
the well-documented APOBEC signature (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012;
Roberts et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2013). We observed a strong corre-
lation both in WGS (ρ = 0.69, P < 2.2 × 10−22) (Fig. 1A) and WES (ρ =
0.37, P < 2.2 × 10−22) (Fig. 1B) data sets. Next, we asked whether the
enrichment of the APOBEC signature (rapo) was dependent on the
level of APOBEC3B expression. In line with other studies (Roberts
et al. 2013), we observed a moderate, but significant positive corre-
lation(ρ = 0.26,P = 3.6 × 10−10)(Fig.1C).Moreover,inlinewithpre-
vious studies (Burns et al. 2013b; Roberts et al. 2013), we found that
the rapo APOBEC signature is particularly prevalent in cancer types
with a high expression of APOBEC3B (Fig. 1D).
We selected a subset of tumors with a strong APOBEC signa-
ture (APOrich), in which >80% of the C → K mutations in the
TpCpW context are associated with APOBEC (rapo > 5). We also se-
lected a subset of tumors with a low prevalence of APOBEC muta-
tions (APOpoor), in which the frequency of C → K mutations in
the TpCpW context is lower than in the VpCpW context (rapo <
1) as a control data set (Fig. 1E). This yielded 23 APOrich and
167 APOpoor tumors in the WGS data set and 587 APOrich and
904 APOpoor tumors in the WES data set. APOrich tumors from
the WGS data set harbored 168,326 APOBEC mutations, including
146,600 dispersed and 21,726 clustered mutations. To confirm
that this definition of APOrich cancers is robust, we asked how
well it matches the set of cancers with APOBEC signatures deci-
phered by computational methods (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/
cosmic/signatures) (Alexandrov et al. 2013a,b, 2015). In all 23
APOrich cancers in the WGS data set, and in 563 out of 585 cancers
in the WES data set, the 2 + 13 (APOBEC) signatures comprise at
least one-third of all mutations and were more than five times
more prevalent than a combination of the 7 + 10 + 11 + 19 + 23 +
30 (confounding non-APOBEC) signatures. In contrast, none of
the 167 WGS APOpoor cancers and only one of the 683 WES
APOpoor cancers met this criterion, indicating that our definitions
of APOrich and APOpoor cancers are robust.
Dispersed APOBEC-induced mutations are less associated
with double-stranded breaks than clustered mutations
First, we asked whether dispersed APOBEC-induced mutations oc-
cur during the repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs), as previous-
ly identified for clustered APOBEC-induced mutations (Nik-Zainal
et al. 2012; Roberts et al. 2012, 2013; Taylor et al. 2013). To in-
vestigate this, we calculated the enrichment of APOBEC-induced
clustered and dispersed mutations near DNA rearrangement break-
points, used as a proxy for the locations of DSBs (Fig. 1F). We cate-
gorized APOBEC clusters bystrand colocalization of mutations into
strand-coordinated clusters, clusters with one strand switch, and
short or noncoordinated clusters (details in Methods). In line
with the previous observations (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012; Roberts
etal. 2012, 2013;Tayloretal. 2013),mutationsinstrand-coordinat-
ed clusters and clusters with strand switches were highly enriched
within 10 kb from breakpoints (∼80-fold enrichment). In contrast,
the enrichment of dispersed APOBEC mutations near DSBs was
11.4 times weaker (sevenfold enrichment) (Fig. 1F). Mutations in
noncoordinated clusters were also less enriched near DSBs
(20-fold enrichment) than mutations in other types of clusters.
APOBEC mutations are at least two times more frequent
on the lagging DNA strand
We next estimated the preferential direction of the replication fork
from the replication timing (RT) data (Koren et al. 2012). The RT
is highly conserved between human tissues and cell types (Ryba
et al. 2010; Pope et al. 2014); therefore, we utilized the RT data
from one cell type (lymphoblastoid cell line) to different cancer
types. To validate this approach, we used data on replication
timing for five different cell types from the ENCODE Project
Consortium (2012) (https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=
Experiment&assay_term_name=Repli-seq&limit=all) and estimated

 the correlations between RT for these cell types. In all comparisons,
correlation coefficients exceeded 0.7 (Supplemental Table 3), while
using the cell type with the lowest correlation, HeLa, as the source
of information on RT still produced the same results (see below).
We reconstructed replication fork polarity (FP) as the deriva-
tive of the RT (Chen et al. 2011; Baker et al. 2012) and predicted
for each genomic region whether the reference strand is replicated
more frequently as leading (FP > 0) or lagging (FP < 0) (Fig. 2A,B).
The FP values reflect the ratio between the frequencies of passages
of the replication fork in forward and reverse directions (Chen
et al. 2011; Baker et al. 2012).
In order to validate this approach for cancer data sets, we first
tested the FP metric using polymerase epsilon (pol ε). This DNA
polymerase specifically duplicates the leading strand during DNA
replication (Shinbrot et al. 2014). Somatic mutations in the proof-
reading exonuclease domain of pol ε cause an extremely high rate
of TpCpT → TpApT mutations that occur during replication specif-
ically on the leading strand (Shinbrot et al. 2014). We took advan-
tage of the set of tumor genomes (Shinbrot et al. 2014) with such
somatic mutations in pol ε and investigated the distribution of the
TpCpT → TpApT mutations as a function of FP. If our approach was
able to correctly predict the preferential fork direction, we expect-
ed to observe the enrichment of TpCpT → TpApT mutations on
the leading strand in tumors with the somatic mutations in
pol ε. Indeed, we have found a 2.25-fold (P < 2.2 × 10−16) enrich-
ment of the TpCpT → TpApT mutations on the leading strand in
the 10% of genomic regions with the highest FP. No such enrich-
ment was observed in cancers with unaffected pol ε (Fig. 2C).
Having confirmed that our FP statistic accurately reflects the
propensity of the reference strand to be replicated as leading or lag-
ging in cancer genomes, we set out to study its relationship with
the APOBEC signature. In APOrich tumors from the WGS data
set, the fraction of dispersed APOBEC mutations that occurred
on the reference strand grows monotonically with FP. In the
10% of the genome with the highest FP, APOBEC mutations
were approximately twofold less abundant on the reference strand
than on the nonreference stand (P < 2.2 × 10−16). Similarly, in the
10% of the genome with the lowest (negative) FP, APOBEC muta-
tions were approximately twofold more abundant on the reference
strand than on the nonreference stand (P < 2.2 × 10−16, χ2 test) (Fig.
2D). This indicates that 33% of APOBEC signature mutations ge-
nome-wide occur on the lagging strand during DNA replication.
This estimate is conservative, as even in the regions with the high-
est and the lowest FP values, the replication fork is not strictly uni-
directional (Baker et al. 2012). A similar profile was observed in the
WES data set (e.g., a 1.69-fold depletion for the top 10% FP, and

 1.62-fold enrichment for the bottom 10% FP) (Fig. 2E) and in tu-
mors with increased APOBEC expression (Supplemental Fig. 1A).
In order to control for the potential effect of the transcribed strand
in genes, we replicated the analyses only on intergenic regions of
the WGS data set and obtained similar results (Supplemental Fig.
1B). Moreover, the results were also very similar when HeLa cells
were used to estimate FP (Supplemental Fig. 1C), confirming that
tissue specificity of replication fork direction does not affect our
results.
We next investigated how the bias of APOBEC signature mu-
tations in the TpCpW context toward the lagging strand depends
on the prevalence of rapo signature in the tumors. As expected, the
strand bias of this mutation type in the 10% of the genome with
the lowest FP monotonically increases with rapo (Supplemental
Fig. 1D,F), confirming involvement of APOBEC in the observed
patterns. The group of APOBEC signature mutations in the
TpCpW context in APOrich tumors was the only one to reveal a
strong strand bias (Fig. 2D,E). A marginal association with FP was
also observed for mutations in the VpCpW context in APOrich
(1.18-fold, P = 0.0039) but not in APOpoor cancers (0.97-fold,
P = 0.24) (Fig. 2D), implying that some of these mutations may
also be induced by APOBEC.
APOBEC-dependent and APOBEC-independent mutation rates in
APOrich tumors are moderately dependent on replication timing
Point mutation rates in cancer are increased in the genomic loci
that are replicated during the late S phase compared to earlier-rep-
licating regions (Lawrence et al. 2013; Supek and Lehner 2015). We
therefore asked whether APOBEC mutations are also enriched in
regions of late RT. APOpoor tumors exhibited a 3.11-fold increase
of mutation rates in late RT regions (Fig. 3A), consistent with pre-
vious observations (Lawrence et al. 2013). In contrast, in APOrich
tumors, we observed only a very moderate (on average, 1.09-fold)
increase of the rates of APOBEC-induced mutations in late RT. In
some of these tumors, the APOBEC mutations rate was, in fact, de-
creased in late RT (Supplemental Table 1).
In order to investigate if this difference is specific to APOBEC
mutations, we performed a similar comparison for non-APOBEC
mutations: T → V and VpCpW → VpKpW. Unexpectedly, we ob-
served the same trend for these types of mutations as for
APOBEC mutations: a moderate (1.32- and 1.34-fold, respectively)
increase of mutation rates with RT in APOrich tumors versus a
strong (3.71- and 2.27-fold, respectively) increase in APOpoor tu-
mors (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. 3). Some of the mutations in can-
cers with deficiencies in the mismatch repair (MMR) are nearly
independent of RT (Supek and Lehner 2015). However, the rates
of TpCpN → TpApN mutations depend on RT even in MMR-
deficient cancers (Supek and Lehner 2015), and these muta-
tions are also moderately dependent on RT in APOrich cancers
(Supplemental Fig. 2). This suggests that the lack of dependence
on RT of mutations in APOrich tumors is not related to MMR defi-
ciency and represents a novel unexplained phenomenon. The fact
that both APOBEC-induced and other mutations are nearly inde-
pendent of RT in APOrich tumors suggests that this lack of depen-
dence is not specific to APOBEC-related mechanisms, but rather is

 a consequence of another perturbation of the mutational process
in APOrich tumors.
Protein-coding genes are preferentially located in early RT re-
gions (Supplemental Fig. 3), which are less exposed to mutagenesis
than late RT regions (Farkash-Amar et al. 2008). As a result, in
APOrich tumors, where mutation rates are similar between early
and late RT, the fraction of mutations that occurred in coding ex-
ons is 1.27-fold higher than in APOpoor tumors (Fig. 3B).
Therefore, the increased probability of occurrence of functional
mutations in cancer driver genes in APOrich cancers (Roberts
et al. 2013; Henderson and Fenton 2015) is associated not only
with the higher rate of mutations, but also with a higher fraction
of genic mutations among them.
TpCpS → TpKpS and TpCpN → TpApN mutations are likely
associated with APOBEC activity
C → K mutations in the TpCpW context are considered to be the
canonical APOBEC mutational signature. Nevertheless, we also in-
vestigated the propensity of APOBEC for mutating cytosines in
other contexts (Fig. 4A–D; Supplemental Table 4; Burns et al.
2013a; Taylor et al. 2013). Assuming that APOBEC context prefer-
ences in cancers are independent of the extent of APOBEC muta-
tional activity, we searched for additional signatures. For that, we
defined measures analogous to rapo and strength of the lagging
strand mutational bias for noncanonical mutational contexts
(see Methods).
Specifically, we considered the remaining mutations in the
TpC contexts: C → K mutations in the TpCpS context, and C → A
mutations in the TpCpN context (Supplemental Table 3). For the
analysis of C → A mutations, we excluded lung cancers due to
the known high prevalence of APOBEC-independent C → A muta-
tions in them (Alexandrov et al. 2013a; Lawrence et al. 2013;
Roberts and Gordenin 2014b). We found very strong correlations
for APOrich samples (WGS data set) between rapo and enrichments
of mutations estimated analogically to rapo for TpCpS → TpKpS
(rapo_nc1) (ρ = 0.94, P = 3.2 × 10−6) (Fig. 4A) and TpCpN → TpApN
mutations (rapo_nc2) (ρ = 0.91, P = 3.9 × 10−6) (Fig. 4C). Moreover,

 for these mutations, we also observed a strong lagging strand bias
of 1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 4B,D). These analyses con-
firm a high prevalence of APOBEC-induced TpCpS → TpKpS and
TpCpN → TpApN mutations. The mean values of rapo_nc1 and
rapo_nc2 across all APOrich cancers were 3.12 and 4.28, implying
that 68% and 77% of respective mutations are associated with
APOBEC compared to 95% of TpCpW → TpKpW mutations. The
rates of TpCpS → TpKpS mutations caused by APOBEC were 5.34
lower than the rates of TpCpW → TpKpW mutations, resulting in
12.38 times fewer such mutations per genome. The rates of
TpCpN→TpApN mutations caused by APOBEC were 16.27 lower
than the rates of TpCpW → TpKpW mutations, resulting in 8.73
times fewer such mutations per genome. For comparison, in yeast
experiments, APOBEC caused C → A mutations at a rate 1/40 that
of C → K mutations (Taylor et al. 2013). Finally, based on the anal-
ysis of lagging strand bias, we observed that at least 9% of
VpCpW → VpKpW mutations may also be caused by APOBEC
(Supplemental Table 4).
APOBEC preferentially targets nonmethylated cytosines
In order to better understand the action of APOBEC in the TpCpS
noncanonical context, and specifically, the controversial role of
cytosine methylation (Nabel et al. 2012; Caval et al. 2014), we in-
vestigated the preferences of APOBEC for 5-methylcytosines
(5mC) versus nonmethylated cytosines by using the data on meth-
ylation level from Meissner et al. (2008). In APOrich tumors, we
observed an approximately twofold lower mutation rate at
5mCs, compared to nonmethylated cytosines, at the TpCpG con-
text (P = 1.4 × 10−4), but not in the VpCpG context (P = 0.64) (Fig.
5A). This is in stark contrast to tumors of the same cancer type with
rapo < 2, where a 1.5- to twofold increase of mutation rates in meth-
ylated cytosines, both in TpCpG (P = 0.069) and VpCpG contexts
(P < 2.2 × 10−16), was observed (Fig. 5B). These data suggest a strong
preference of APOBEC for nonmethylated cytosines in the TpCpG
context in cancer. The observation that the fraction of mutations
in nonmethylated cytosines in the VpCpG context is higher in
APOrich tumors than in APOpoor tumors is in line with the resid-
ual APOBEC-induced mutagenesis in this context (Burns et al.
2013a; Taylor et al. 2013) and with the weak lagging strand bias
specific to APOrich tumors (Fig. 2D, pink curve).
Discussion
APOBEC-dependent mutagenesis is a frequent phenomenon in
cancer. Of TCGA samples, 18% have a strong APOBEC signature;
and in some tumor types, such as bladder cancer, the fraction of
APOrich tumors may reach 37% (Nordentoft et al. 2014). In
some samples, up to 70% of all mutations are associated with
the APOBEC mutational signature (Supplemental Table 1), con-
firming that APOBEC mutagenesis may be an important factor
for cancer progression and tissue transformation (de Bruin et al.
2014; Henderson et al. 2014; McGranahan et al. 2015). Recently,
it was shown that the expression level of APOBEC3B has prognos-
tic potential, and APOBEC was suggested as a target for oncother-
apy (Cescon et al. 2015).
DSB repair is the most widely discussed source of ssDNA tar-
geted by APOBEC in cancer (Taylor et al. 2013; Nordentoft et al.
2014; Henderson and Fenton 2015). Our study uncovers the
main source of ssDNA substrate of APOBEC, which is related not
to DSBs but to DNA replication. There is some evidence that
APOBEC may specifically mutate the lagging strand under replica-
tion stress in yeast (Roberts et al. 2012). Knowledge about the ori-
gin of ssDNA in cancer cells can expand our understanding of
mutational processes in cancer and can be medically relevant.
Moreover, knowledge about the propensity of regions of DNA
strands to be replicated as leading or lagging can be widely utilized
for the studies of cancer genomes. For example, here we have used
it to show a strong bias of mutations produced by pol ε with dam-
aged proofreading exonuclease domain toward the leading strand.
We suggest that our method would be useful for detection of other
strand-specific mutational signatures and mechanisms.
In theory, selection could confound inference of mutational
patterns. Despite the presence of positive selection in a subset of
cancer-related genes (Woo and Li 2012), the vast majority of exon-
ic mutations in cancer are not subject to selection (McFarland et al.
2014), and therefore are unlikely to affect our results. Moreover, in
the WGS data set, our results were completely reproduced even
when all genes were excluded (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Our conclu-
sions likely concern many different cancer types, as the APOrich
WES data set comprises many types of cancers (Supplemental
Table 2).
The rates of germline mutations are known to be increased in
late RT (Stamatoyannopoulos et al. 2009). A recent study of de
novo mutations has uncovered that this pattern is weaker for mu-
tations that originated in older fathers, resulting in a higher frac-
tion of mutations in exonic regions (Francioli et al. 2015). In line
with these observations, we show that in APOrich cancers, the
fraction of mutations that fall into exons is increased (Fig. 3B).
This difference is even stronger after exclusion of CpG mutations
(1.27-fold for all mutations versus 1.34-fold for non-CpG muta-
tions, P = 0.016) (Supplemental Fig. 4). The association between
the rate of both TpCpW → TpKpW and non-APOBEC signature
mutations and RT is stronger in APOpoor than in APOrich cancers
(Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that the prevalence of
APOBEC-induced mutations is a marker of perturbations of the
mutational processes. These perturbations may be associated
with the frequent fork uncoupling or impairment of certain
Figure 5.

 replication mechanisms in APOrich tumors. Enrichment of muta-
tions in early RT should also increase the probability of acquisition
of driver mutations and therefore, is directly related to cancer pro-
gression (Lawrence et al. 2013).
In summary, our data suggest that the dispersed mutations
with the APOBEC signature are not explained by DSBs. In contrast,
a high fraction of them arise in the ssDNA produced during repli-
cation, particularly, in the lagging strand. We also show that the
mutation rates in APOrich tumors are almost independent of RT,
suggesting disruption of a range of DNA protection mechanisms
in these cancer samples. This difference leads to a higher fraction
of genic mutations in APOrich tumors (which comprise 18% of
all TCGA cancers), likely affecting the functional consequences
of APOBEC-related mutagenesis.
Methods
Data sets and APOBEC signature
Somatic point mutations from 433 whole cancer genomes were ob-
tained (Supplemental Table 1; Alexandrov et al. 2013a). Three
thousand whole cancer exomes with more than 100 mutations
per sample were obtained from TCGA (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/tcga/) (Supplemental Table 2). All regions annotated as repeats
by RepeatMasker were excluded.
Similar to other studies (Burns et al. 2013a,b; Roberts et
al. 2013), we considered TpCpW → TpKpW mutations as the
APOBEC signature. As a measure of the prevalence of APOBEC sig-
nature mutations (rapo), we used the ratio of rates of C → K muta-
tions in the TpCpW context to C → K mutations in the VpCpW
context
rapo = #(TpCpW � TpKpW)/#(VpCpW � VpKpW)
#(TpCpW)/#(VpCpW)
,
which is similar to the metric used in Roberts et al. (2013). For the
comparative analyses, we selected the APOBEC-rich tumors with
rapo > 5, and APOBEC-poor tumors with rapo < 1 (Supplemental
Tables 1, 2). The fraction of APOBEC-induced mutations was calcu-
lated as (rapo−1)/rapo. Similarly, the prevalence of noncanonical
signature mutations was defined as
rapo nc1 = #(TpCpW � TpKpS)/#(VpCpS � VpKpS)
#(TpCpS)/#(VpCpS)
and
rapo nc2 = #(TpCpN � TpApS)/#(VpCpN � VpApN)
#(TpCpN)/#(VpCpN)
.
In order to validate that the rapo signature is specific to APOBEC
mutations, we utilized the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF) method (Alexandrov et al. 2013b). This analysis was applied
to all 23 WGS APOrich and to 167 WGS APOpoor cancers, to 585 of
the 587 WES APOrich cancers, and to 683 WES APOpoor cancers;
the remaining two WES APOrich cancers and 221 WES APOpoor
cancers did not have any signatures detected by NMF.
Clusters of APOBEC-induced mutations
Kataegistic clusters were defined as at least three APOBEC signature
mutations with distance between adjacent mutations not exceed-
ing 20 kb; mutations not falling into any cluster were considered
dispersed. A cluster was categorized as strand coordinated if it car-
ried at least four mutations, and all mutations occurred in the same
orientation (TpCpW or WpGpA); switched if it carried at least two
mutations in one orientation and two adjacent mutations in the
other orientation; and noncoordinated otherwise.
Double-strand breaks
To investigate the relationship between double-strand breaks
(DSB) and clusters of different types as well as dispersed mutations,
we used data on rearrangements (Nik-Zainal et al. 2012) and con-
sidered rearrangement breakpoints as a proxy for DSBs. We used a
relaxed criterion for APOBEC signature enrichment in this analysis
(rapo > 2), yielding 13 of the 21 cancers represented in Nik-Zainal
et al. (2012); using rapo > 5 as a criterion would yield only three
cancers.
Fractions of different types of APOBEC mutations were calcu-
lated for regions with lengths between 20 and 200 kb (in 2 kb in-
crements)
centered
at
the
rearrangement
breakpoints.
The
enrichments of APOBEC clusters and dispersed mutations near
DSBs were calculated as their frequencies in the windows near
DSBs divided by the genome average frequencies in the corre-
sponding category.
Estimates of polarity of replication fork
Replication timing (RT) was obtained from Koren et al. (2012). Fork
polarity (FP) for a genomic coordinate was calculated as replication
timing (RT) increment between points 5 kb upstream of and 5 kb
downstream from the coordinate (Supplemental data). To ensure
that this estimation is robust, we recalculated FP from RT at dis-
tances ranging between 0.5 and 15 kb from the current coordinate;
all resulting values were strongly correlated (Spearman’s ρ > 0.995).
Absolute values of RT change reflect the propensity of FP toward
unidirectionality (Baker et al. 2012). We divided the genome
into nine bins according to the values of FP: eight bins each con-
taining 10% of all nucleotides, and one bin centered at FP = 0, con-
taining 20% of all nucleotides. For each bin, we then measured
the rates of selected mutation types on the reference and nonrefer-
ence strands. To verify conservation of RT between cell types, we
downloaded the RT track for five more cell types (https://www
.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&assay_term_name=
Repli-seq&limit=all) and measured the correlations of the RT val-
ues in 10-kb windows between each of the five tracks and the track
from the lymphoblastoid cell line that was used in our analyses
(Supplemental Table 4). The fraction of APOBEC-induced muta-
tions was calculated as the ratio of APOBEC-induced mutations
on the lagging strand to those on the leading strand in the ninth
bin (y-axis) (Fig. 2C,D,E). The ratio of C → K mutations in the
TpCpW context and their reverse compliment on the lagging
strand is
sb = 0.5(1 − x) + x
0.5(1 − x)
,
where x is the fraction of the APOBEC-induced mutations that spe-
cifically occurred on the lagging strand. Therefore, sb = 2 corre-
sponds to x = 0.33.
For the analysis of the relationship between the RT and the
mutation rates, we categorized the genome into 10 equal bins by
RT values. The TpCpN → TpApN mutation were considered as
MMR-independent (Supek and Lehner 2015).
Stratification of the cancer genomes based on expression
and methylation
APOBEC3B expression normalized by TBP expression for TCGA
cancer samples was obtained from Roberts et al. (2013). The subset
of cancers with high APOBEC3B expression was defined as the
20% of cancers with the highest APOBEC3B/TBP expression ratios,

 and the subset with low APOBEC3B expression was defined as the
50% of cancers with the lowest ratio.
Cytosine methylation levels for noncancer tissues were ob-
tained from http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g
=wgEncodeHaibMethylRrbs (Meissner et al. 2008). Because all
APOrich WGS tumors were from lung, breast, and liver cancer
types, tissue-matched comparisons of the methylation and muta-
tional profiles were performed only for these three tissues. We
merged biological replicates of methylation analyses and con-
sidered only sites with at least 10 reads. To maximize the statisti-
cal power of our tests, we divided TpCpG sites into two equal
subsets depending on the fraction of methylated reads, result-
ing
in
the
methylation
threshold
of
0.013.
VpCpG
sites
were divided analogously, resulting in the methylation threshold
of 0.037. For APOpoor cancers, we used a relaxed threshold of
rapo < 2 due to the low number of mutations at sites with a known
level of methylation.
To map genic and exonic regions, we used KnownGene anno-
tation (UCSC Genome Browser).
