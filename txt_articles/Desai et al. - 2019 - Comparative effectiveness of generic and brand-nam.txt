Abstract
Background
To the extent that outcomes are mediated through negative perceptions of generics (the
nocebo effect), observational studies comparing brand-name and generic drugs are suscep-
tible to bias favoring the brand-name drugs. We used authorized generic (AG) products,
which are identical in composition and appearance to brand-name products but are mar-
keted as generics, as a control group to address this bias in an evaluation aiming to compare
the effectiveness of generic versus brand medications.
Methods and findings
For commercial health insurance enrollees from the US, administrative claims data were
derived from 2 databases: (1) Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (years: 2004–2013) and (2)
Truven MarketScan (years: 2003–2015). For a total of 8 drug products, the following groups
were compared using a cohort study design: (1) patients switching from brand-name prod-
ucts to AGs versus generics, and patients initiating treatment with AGs versus generics,
where AG use proxied brand-name use, addressing negative perception bias, and (2)
patients initiating generic versus brand-name products (bias-prone direct comparison) and
patients initiating AG versus brand-name products (negative control). Using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression after 1:1 propensity-score matching, we compared a composite
cardiovascular endpoint (for amlodipine, amlodipine-benazepril, and quinapril), non-verte-
bral fracture (for alendronate and calcitonin), psychiatric hospitalization rate (for sertraline
and escitalopram), and insulin initiation (for glipizide) between the groups. Inverse variance
meta-analytic methods were used to pool adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for each comparison
between the 2 databases. Across 8 products, 2,264,774 matched pairs of patients were
included in the comparisons of AGs versus generics. A majority (12 out of 16) of the clinical

 endpoint estimates showed similar outcomes between AGs and generics. Among the other
4 estimates that did have significantly different outcomes, 3 suggested improved outcomes
with generics and 1 favored AGs (patients switching from amlodipine brand-name: HR [95%
CI] 0.92 [0.88–0.97]). The comparison between generic and brand-name initiators involved
1,313,161 matched pairs, and no differences in outcomes were noted for alendronate, calci-
tonin, glipizide, or quinapril. We observed a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular end-
point with generics versus brand-name products for amlodipine and amlodipine-benazepril
(HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84–0.99] and 0.84 [0.76–0.94], respectively). For escitalopram and
sertraline, we observed higher rates of psychiatric hospitalizations with generics (HR [95%
CI]: 1.05 [1.01–1.10] and 1.07 [1.01–1.14], respectively). The negative control comparisons
also indicated potentially higher rates of similar magnitude with AG compared to brand-
name initiation for escitalopram and sertraline (HR [95% CI]: 1.06 [0.98–1.13] and 1.11
[1.05–1.18], respectively), suggesting that the differences observed between brand and
generic users in these outcomes are likely explained by either residual confounding or
generic perception bias. Limitations of this study include potential residual confounding due
to the unavailability of certain clinical parameters in administrative claims data and the inabil-
ity to evaluate surrogate outcomes, such as immediate changes in blood pressure, upon
switching from brand products to generics.
Conclusions
In this study, we observed that use of generics was associated with comparable clinical out-
comes to use of brand-name products. These results could help in promoting educational
interventions aimed at increasing patient and provider confidence in the ability of generic
medicines to manage chronic diseases.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Empirical research investigating comparative outcomes of generic versus brand-name
drug use in routine-care patient populations is limited. Many patients and providers
perceive generics to be less effective and less safe than their brand-name counterparts.
• To the extent that outcomes are mediated through negative perceptions (the nocebo
effect), observational studies comparing brand-name and generic drugs are susceptible
to bias favoring the brand-name drugs. This study was done to assess the comparative
effectiveness of generic versus brand-name drugs, while addressing the potential for per-
ception bias.
What did the researchers do and find?
• The authors used data from 2 large US commercial insurance databases to assess autho-
rized generics, which are chemically identical to and share the same appearance as
brand-name products, as proxies for brand-name drug use to account for potential bias

 due to negative perceptions towards generics in comparing the effectiveness of 8 brand-
name versus generic products.
• After analyzing data from more than 3.5 million patients, the authors observed that use
of generics provided comparable clinical outcomes to those of the brand-name products
for chronic conditions including diabetes (glipizide), hypertension (amlodipine, amlo-
dipine-benazepril, and quinapril), osteoporosis (alendronate and calcitonin salmon),
and depression and anxiety (escitalopram and sertraline).
What do these findings mean?
• These results may guide the development of educational interventions to address physi-
cians’ and patients’ negative perceptions of generics and to increase awareness regarding
the equivalence of generic and brand-name drugs.
Introduction
Generic drugs are a critical component of the healthcare system, accounting for approximately
90% of all US prescriptions dispensed [1]. Generic drugs contain equivalent amounts of the same
active ingredient(s) as their brand-name counterparts, but usually cost far less [2]. Some prior
studies have demonstrated improved adherence with generic drugs compared to brand-name
drugs, likely due to price [3,4]. Generics are approved by regulators based on evidence of pharma-
ceutical equivalence and bioequivalence with the brand-name product, even though they may
contain different inactive ingredients. Still, many patients and providers perceive generics to be
less effective and less safe than their brand-name counterparts [5–11]. Some patients explicitly
express concerns about the effectiveness of generic drugs to treat their serious illnesses [12]. Nega-
tive expectations with generic products may lead patients to experience negative clinical outcomes
due to a complex neurobiological phenomenon often described as the nocebo effect [13,14].
Randomized controlled trials comparing clinical outcomes between generic and brand-
name products are rarely conducted as they are not required by regulators for generic drug
approval. In certain cases—for example, when bioequivalence is disputed—rigorous evaluation
of the comparative effectiveness of generic drug products in post-approval observational stud-
ies can be useful. However, in contrast to interventional studies, these observational studies do
not have the advantage of blinding participants to the treatment they receive. As a result, if out-
comes are mediated through negative perceptions of generic products, a theoretical concern is
that comparative investigations in which participants are aware of their treatment assignment
may be biased in favor of the brand-name product [13]. In a recent randomized study of
patients taking a brand-name β-blocker placebo tablet, a switch to a “generic” different colored
placebo tablet resulted in lower reductions in blood pressure and more adverse events com-
pared with a group that continued receiving the brand-name placebo tablet [15].
In this study comparing outcomes between generic and brand-name users across 8 drug
products, we aimed to address potential bias due to negative perceptions by incorporating
authorized generics (AGs) in the study design (Fig 1). AGs are a special type of generic; they
are identical in composition and pill appearance to the brand-name product—but are mar-
keted by brand manufacturers (or their licensees) as generics, usually after regulatory approval
of other generic versions [16]. Considering AG users as a distinct exposure group, we designed

 2 sets of analyses to compare outcomes between users of generics and brand-name products.
In the first set of analyses, we compared outcomes between generic and AG users, with AG use
as a proxy for brand-name use. These analyses were designed to address possible negative per-
ception bias against generics under the assumption that, if such bias existed, it would impact
outcomes equally in both the generic and the AG groups, since patients would not be aware of
the distinction between generic and AG products and patients in both groups would believe
they were taking generics. In the second set of analyses, we compared outcomes between
generic users and brand-name users and between AG users and brand-name users, the latter
representing a negative control. Since AGs and their corresponding brand-name products
have identical active and inactive ingredients, any observed differences in the rates of clinical
outcomes between users of AGs and brand products can be attributed to unmeasured con-
founding factors or differences in adherence patterns, which can help in interpretation of
generic and brand product comparisons.
Two previous studies have used AGs to account for generic perception bias in comparative
evaluations of brand-name versus generic medications [17,18]. The first study had a small
sample size of approximately 5,000 patients, which precluded analysis by specific drug product
[17]. The second study used the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event
Reporting System to compare adverse event reporting patterns between generics and AGs
[18], but this data source has important limitations including substantial under-reporting and
limited ability to assess whether patients used brand or generic versions of drugs [19]. The
objective of our study was to overcome these limitations by comparing the effectiveness of
brand, generic, and AG versions of 8 different drug products in 2 population-based data
sources, allowing for control of potential bias due to negative perceptions.
Methods
This study was undertaken as a part of a Cooperative Agreement (U01) with the FDA Office of
Generic Drugs. As part of the funding proposal (S1 Text), we specified the study hypotheses,

 the pool of drugs of interest, the clinical outcomes of interest, and the analytic techniques to be
used. Changes in the study methods to strengthen the study design, and for practical purposes,
are detailed below. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S1 STROBE checklist).
Data sources
Data were derived from 2 large US-based health insurance claims databases: (1) Truven Mar-
ketScan (2003 to 2015) and (2) Optum Clinformatics Data Mart (2004 to 2013). Both sources
contain de-identified data that are captured during billing of routine healthcare encounters.
Individuals with employer-sponsored commercial and Medicare Advantage health insurance
plans from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia are represented in these data sources.
In the included study years, Truven MarketScan captured the healthcare experiences of 173
million unique individuals, and Optum Clinformatics captured 55 million unique individuals.
Comprehensive longitudinal information on demographics, coded inpatient and outpatient
diagnoses and procedures, and outpatient prescription dispensing is recorded for all enrollees
in these databases during the time of their health insurance enrollment. We selected these data
sources for their size, representativeness of the employed US population, and ability to reliably
identify generic-level prescription drug dispensing through National Drug Codes (NDCs).
The study was approved by the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Institutional Review Board
and the FDA’s Research in Human Subjects Committee.
Drug products
We had initially proposed a list of 25 drugs with marketed AGs to be included in this analysis
(S1 Text). This list was modified to include 20 products based on the following criteria: (1)
restriction to products for which generics entered the market after 2003, which marks the start
of availability of data in our sources; (2) restriction to products for which generics and AGs
entered the market concurrently (i.e., within 30 days of each other), because non-concurrently
marketed generics and AGs were thought to have fundamentally different use and switching
patterns, which we believed could introduce bias; and (3) inclusion of a combination product
(amlodipine-benazepril capsules) to expand the scope of the study to include generics of com-
bination products. Of these 20 products, we differentiated generics from AGs using NDCs
derived from the FDA NDC directory and excluded 12 products for which >5% of filled pre-
scriptions in our data sources had NDCs that were not found in the NDC directory. The most
likely reason for the absence of these NDCs is that the NDC directory does not maintain details
on discontinued NDCs. Furthermore, the quality of recording in the NDC directory is depen-
dent upon manufacturer submissions to the FDA, which could also introduce error or miss-
ingness. The following 8 products met our inclusion criteria: alendronate tablets, amlodipine
tablets, amlodipine-benazepril capsules, calcitonin salmon nasal spray, escitalopram tablets,
glipizide extended release (ER) tablets, quinapril tablets, and sertraline tablets.
Study design
Evaluation of comparative outcomes between generic and AG users.
For all included
drug products, we compared outcomes in 2 separate patient cohorts of AG and generic users:
(1) patients who had previously been dispensed the brand-name version of the drug and then
switched to either an AG or generic and (2) patients who had not been dispensed the brand-
name version in the prior 6 months and initiated either an AG or generic. To identify these
groups, we identified patients’ first prescription for the AG or generic version of a drug after a
period of 6 months of continuous health plan enrollment. This prescription date was defined

 as the index date, and the 6-month pre-index period was defined as the baseline period. If
patients had a record of a brand-name prescription for the same drug product in the baseline
period, we defined them as having switched to AG or generic from the brand-name product. If
they had no record of a brand-name prescription for the same drug product in the baseline
period, we defined them as AG or generic initiators. Since the AGs are identical in composi-
tion and appearance to their brand-name counterparts, the comparison of AG and generic ini-
tiators addressed the clinical question of the comparative effectiveness of the brand versus
generic product among patients initiating a new treatment episode with that particular treat-
ment, while the comparison of patients switching to AG or generic from a brand-name prod-
uct addressed the clinical question of the comparative effectiveness for patients who continued
on the brand-name product versus patients who switched to a generic version.
Evaluation of comparative outcomes between generic and brand users. Next, we com-
pared outcomes directly between initiators of generics and initiators of brand-name products. As
a negative control comparison, we also compared outcomes between initiators of AGs and initia-
tors of the brand products. For both comparisons, patients were required to have no recorded use
of any version of the medication of interest in the 6-month continuous health plan enrollment
period (baseline period) before commencing any type or formulation of the drug of interest.
Outcomes of interest and follow-up
Clinical outcomes of interest were defined based on the approved indications for the specific
drug products. For the drugs treating cardiovascular disease—amlodipine tablets, amlodipine-
benazepril capsules, and quinapril tablets—the outcome of interest was a composite cardiovas-
cular endpoint comprising hospitalization with myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke as the
primary discharge diagnosis or having a coronary revascularization procedure [20,21]. For alen-
dronate tablets and calcitonin salmon nasal spray, the outcome of interest was a composite non-
vertebral fracture endpoint of humerus, wrist, hip, or pelvis fracture identified using discharge
diagnosis codes from hospital admission claims or a combination of diagnosis codes and surgi-
cal procedures from outpatient claims [22]. As escitalopram tablets and sertraline tablets are
used for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including but not limited to major depressive disor-
der and generalized anxiety disorder, we reasoned that an endpoint that captured deterioration
of patients’ mental health would be suitable for comparing the effectiveness for these drugs.
While specific mental health scales are not available in administrative claims, healthcare services
utilization for those with mental health diagnoses is well captured. Therefore, we selected hospi-
talization with a psychiatric condition as the principal discharge diagnosis code as the outcome
of interest for escitalopram and sertraline. For glipizide ER tablets, the outcome was initiation
of insulin during the follow-up period, with the rationale that a need for treatment intensifica-
tion could serve as a proxy for poor glycemic control with current treatment [23]. Table A in S1
Appendix provides specific codes used to identify these outcomes.
Follow-up for the clinical outcome of interest began on the day following the index date.
Follow-up continued until the occurrence of an outcome of interest, health plan disenroll-
ment, drug discontinuation (defined as no dispensing of the index agent for at least 1 month
after the end of the most recent prescription days’ supply), a switch to a different version of the
drug, or the end of the study period.
Covariates
In each comparison, we identified and accounted for a core set of variables that included patient
demographics (age, sex, and geographic region), a combined comorbidity score [24], calendar
year, and healthcare utilization factors as markers of contact with the healthcare system and

 general patient health, including the number of distinct prescription medications, outpatient
visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations during the 6-month baseline period.
Additionally, for each comparison, we identified and included risk factors for the outcome of
interest. For example, we adjusted for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes diagnoses,
and use of other drugs treating cardiovascular disease (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) for analyses of amlodipine tablets, amlodipine-
benazepril capsules, and quinapril tablets. Calendar year was not included in the brand-name
versus generic or brand-name versus AG comparisons because it had an extremely strong asso-
ciation with the exposure to brand and only weak associations with outcomes. Including such
variables in statistical models is known to increase variance and can introduce additional bias
[25]. To minimize the impact of confounding by secular trends in brand-name versus generic
and brand-name versus AG comparisons, we restricted these 2 comparisons to 2 years before
and 2 years after the loss of brand-name market exclusivity for each product. All covariates
were measured in the 6-month pre-index period. For a full list of covariates used in each analy-
sis, please refer to Tables B–I and R–Y in S1 Appendix.
Statistical analysis
Propensity score (PS)–based methods were used for confounding adjustment. PSs were calcu-
lated separately within each database and for each comparison as the predicted probability of
being in the exposure group of interest (AGs in the AG versus generic and AG versus brand
comparisons, and generics in the generic versus brand comparison) in logistic regression mod-
els conditional on the covariates described in Tables B–I and R–Y in S1 Appendix for each
individual product [26]. One-to-one nearest-neighbor matching within a caliper of 0.025 of
the PS was implemented for each comparison [27]. In the matched cohorts, incidence rates for
the outcomes and incidence rate differences were calculated. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to estimate outcome hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All
analyses were conducted for each study drug in the 2 databases separately. Database-specific
estimates were pooled using an inverse variance fixed-effects approach to provide a summary
effect estimate for each comparison of interest. To address the possibility of population overlap
between the 2 databases, we corrected the variance of our pooled HRs assuming 5% overlap
between databases. Statistical analyses were conducted with the Aetion platform, version 2.1.2.
Results
Evaluation of comparative outcomes between generic and AG users
There were a total of 1,694,878 1:1 PS-matched pairs in the comparisons of generic and AG
initiators and 569,896 1:1 PS-matched pairs in the comparisons of patients switching from
brand-name to generic versus AG across the 8 drug products and 2 databases, with cohort
entry dates ranging between 2003 and 2015. Table 1 summarizes the patient demographics
and baseline diagnoses of the primary indications for all matched pairs for each drug product.
The average age of patients included in the analysis varied substantially across drug products,
with older age ranges observed for osteoporosis drugs (alendronate, 60–67 years; calcitonin
salmon, 59–70 years) and cardiovascular drugs (amlodipine, 55–63 years; amlodipine-benaze-
pril, 53–58 years; quinapril, 53–60 years) and younger age ranges seen for users of antidepres-
sants (escitalopram, 39–50 years; sertraline 38–50 years). All patient characteristics were
balanced between 1:1 PS-matched samples in each database. The distributions of patient char-
acteristics for generic and AG users, including co-morbid conditions and co-medications,
prior to PS matching are provided in Tables B–I in S1 Appendix, and after PS matching are
provided in Tables J–Q in S1 Appendix.

 Incidence rates for individual endpoints were generally consistent in all comparisons across
the 2 databases (Table 2). The rates of psychiatric hospitalization were lower among patients
switching from brand-name products to generics or AGs (range 8.7 to 15.5/1,000 person-
years) compared to patients initiating generics or AGs (range 21.2 to 49.8/1,000 person-years)
in both databases for escitalopram and sertraline. The initiator group had high use of other
antidepressants at baseline compared to patients switching from brand-name products to
generics or AGs (Tables F and I in S1 Appendix), suggesting that the initiator group likely rep-
resented patients with treatment-resistant depression while the patients switching from brand-
name products to generics or AGs represented patients continued on a single antidepressant.
S1 Fig summarizes treatment effect estimates for each comparison before PS matching, and
Fig 2 summarizes treatment effect estimates for each comparison after PS matching. After
pooling the PS-matched results from the 2 databases, a majority of the estimates indicated no
differences in the rates of outcomes between the AG and generic versions of drugs. Of the 4
estimates that reached statistical significance, 3 suggested better outcomes among users of
generic versus AG products (HR [95% CI] for patients switching from brand-name glipizide
to AG versus generic: 1.32 [1.07–1.64]; for glipizide AG versus generic initiators: 1.19 [1.14–
1.25]; for sertraline AG versus generic initiators: 1.06 [1.04–1.09]). By contrast, the comparison
of patients switching from brand-name amlodipine to generic versus AG favored the AG (HR
[95% CI]: 0.92 [0.88–0.97]).
Evaluation of comparative outcomes between generic and brand-name
users
Across the 8 drug products and 2 databases, a total of 875,304 1:1 PS-matched pairs were
included in the comparison of generic and brand-name initiators, and 437,857 1:1 PS-matched

 pairs were included in the comparison of AG and brand-name initiators. Table 3 summarizes
the patient demographics and baseline diagnoses for primary indications for all matched pairs
for each drug product. Distributions of baseline characteristics were similar for generic, AG,
and brand-name initiators after 1:1 PS pair matching, for each drug product within each
database (See Tables R–Y in S1 Appendix for distribution before PS matching and Tables Z–
AG in S1 Appendix for distribution after PS matching). Table 4 provides incidence rates for
individual outcomes for patients included in this analysis.
S2 Fig summarizes treatment effect estimates for each product before PS matching, and Fig
3 summarizes treatment effect estimates for each product after PS matching. After PS
matching, the comparison between generic and brand-name initiators (Fig 3) suggested lower
rates of the composite cardiovascular endpoint with the generic version for amlodipine and
amlodipine-benazepril (HR [95% CI]: 0.91 [0.84–0.99] and 0.84 [0.76–0.94], respectively). For
escitalopram and sertraline, a higher rate of hospitalization with a psychiatric diagnosis was
observed among patients initiating generic versions compared to those initiating brand-name
versions (HR [95% CI]: 1.05 [1.01–1.10] and 1.07 [1.01–1.14], respectively). Results from the
negative control analysis also showed a numerically higher rate of hospitalization with a psy-
chiatric condition among AG initiators compared to brand-name initiators for
escitalopram (HR [95% CI]: 1.06 [0.98–1.13]) and a statistically significantly higher rate for
sertraline (HR [95% CI]: 1.11 [1.05–1.18]). For alendronate, calcitonin, glipizide, and

brand-name initiators.
Discussion
In this study conducted using 2 large US commercial insurance databases, we used AGs—
generic versions of brand-name products that are chemically identical and identical in appear-
ance to the branded product—to account for potential bias due to negative perceptions
towards generics in comparing the effectiveness of brand-name versus generic products. We
observed equivalent or better clinical outcomes among patients who used generic versus AG
products in 15 out of 16 comparisons across 8 drug products. When directly comparing indi-
viduals who initiated treatment with generic versus brand-name products, we used AGs versus
brand-name products as a negative control comparison. For the 2 drugs for which we observed
higher rates of hospitalization with a psychiatric condition with the generic version compared
to the brand-name version—escitalopram and sertraline—the negative control comparisons
also tended towards higher rates with AG use compared to brand-name use, suggesting that
the differences observed between brand-name and generic users in these outcomes were likely
explained by residual confounding or generic perception bias.
Our results add to a growing body of literature supporting the clinical equivalence of
brand-name products and FDA-approved bioequivalent generic versions [2,3,17,28,29]. With
2 large national databases and a PS-matched design, we aimed to address the possibility of per-
ception bias affecting comparative effectiveness estimates in observational studies of generic
Fig 2. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing outcomes for patients initiating authorized generics (AGs) versus generics, and
patients switching from brand-name products to AGs versus generics, after 1:1 propensity score matching in each database. The outcome for amlodipine
tablets, amlodipine-benazepril capsules, and quinapril tablets was a composite endpoint comprising hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or
coronary revascularization procedures. The outcome for alendronate tablets and calcitonin salmon nasal spray was a composite non-vertebral fracture endpoint
comprising humerus, wrist, hip, or pelvis fractures. The outcome for escitalopram tablets and sertraline tablets was hospitalization with a psychiatric condition as
the principal discharge diagnosis code. The outcome for glipizide extended release (ER) tablets was initiation of insulin during the follow-up period.

Comparative effectiveness of generic and brand-name medications

 drugs by considering AGs as a control group. We found largely consistent results across 8
drug products and 4 therapeutic classes. In the comparison involving patients switching from
amlodipine brand-name to AG or generic, in which we found a lower rate of the composite
cardiovascular endpoint with AG use compared to generic use, the effect size was modest (HR
of 0.92 with upper 95% confidence limit of 0.97) and should be interpreted cautiously given
the multiple comparisons that were undertaken. We did not correct for multiple testing to
control type I error because this would increase type II error and potentially result in a missed
signal [30]. Therefore, type I error might explain the statistically significant findings in the cur-
rent study.
Although use of generic medications has increased rapidly in the past 2 decades, in recent
national surveys about one-third of patients, physicians, and pharmacists were still classified as
skeptics about the safety, effectiveness, and quality of generic medications [9,11]. Negative per-
ceptions may lead patients to switch back to the brand-name product after generic substitu-
tion. Indeed, switching back to the brand-name product after a brand-name to generic switch
is highly prevalent. In a previous study of the 8 drug products included in this study, we found
that switching back to the brand-name product occurred at a rate of 8.9 per 100 person-years
after a switch to a generic version, and a rate of 7.4 per 100 person-years after a switch to AG
[31]. Switching back to the brand-name product when less expensive generic alternatives are
available can result in unnecessary costs to patients and the healthcare system. Use of low-cost
generic alternatives in place of brand-name drugs saved the US approximately $1 trillion over
the last decade [32]. Results from our comparative effectiveness investigation suggest that clini-
cal outcomes with use of generics and brand products for serious chronic conditions such as
diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and depression and anxiety are broadly equivalent. These
results may inform clinical practice by guiding the development of educational interventions
to address physicians’ and patients’ negative perceptions of generics and to increase awareness
regarding the equivalence of generic and brand-name drugs. For instance, results from the
current and previous studies [2,3,17,28,29] could be used to develop educational materials for
clinical outreach initiatives such as academic detailing, where trained clinical educators includ-
ing physicians, nurses, and pharmacists present concise summaries of the evidence demon-
strating brand and generic equivalence to practitioners in their offices [33]. Similar
educational interventions targeted at patients delivered by trained pharmacy personnel could
increase perseverance on generic medications and reduce the rate of patients switching back to
the brand-name products.

 The most important strength of this study is the use of AGs as a control exposure to indi-
rectly account for perception biases that are not recorded in any data sources. Another major
strength is inclusion of patients from 2 large data sources, which provided large sample sizes
for most analyses. Further, rigorous confounding control was made possible by the availability
of comprehensive longitudinal insurance claims data in both sources. Finally, inclusion of 8
different drugs from 4 therapeutic classes ensures generalizability of our results across multiple
therapeutic classes.
However, our study also has several limitations. First, the data were sourced from 2 com-
mercial health insurance databases from the US that do not collect information about clinical
parameters such as cholesterol or bone mineral density, introducing the possibility of residual
confounding. For instance, if the brand version of alendronate is preferentially used in patients
with low bone mineral density due to a perception of higher effectiveness, then residual con-
founding by this factor could bias the results in favor of the generic version. We sought to
address this limitation by including a large number of measured confounding variables in our
PS models, many of which are likely to be correlated with unmeasured factors. Second, no nar-
row therapeutic index drugs—which have been the subject of particular concern regarding
generic safety and effectiveness—met the criteria for inclusion in this study [10]. Therefore
our results may not generalize to these types of drugs, and future research comparing the effec-
tiveness and safety of generic versus brand versions of narrow therapeutic index drugs is rec-
ommended. Third, we were not able to examine surrogate outcome measures, such as blood
pressure changes or changes in lipid levels, as outcomes since the data sources do not contain
this information. It is possible that slight differences in the bioavailability of different versions
of the same drug could lead to small changes in laboratory values. Changes in laboratory
results or other surrogate measures after switching to generics from brand-name drugs may be
important to identify and characterize in future research. For instance, immediate changes in
blood pressure control after switching from brand to generic amlodipine, perhaps due to the

 nocebo effect, could lead to compromised patient compliance. Therefore, products for which
such changes are common should be identified and prioritized for patient counseling by phar-
macists or physicians.
Conclusion
In this study of 8 drug products conducted using 2 large US commercial insurance databases,
we observed that use of generics provided comparable clinical outcomes as the brand products.
These results could be used in educational interventions aimed at increasing patient and physi-
cian confidence in the ability of generic medicines to manage chronic diseases.
