Diseases of the liver related to metabolic syndrome have emerged as the most common and undertreated hepatic ailments.
The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the aberrant accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes, though the mechanisms
whereby this leads to hepatocyte dysfunction, death, and hepatic fibrosis are still unclear. Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidine-
diones have shown efficacy in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but their widespread use is constrained by
dose-limiting side effects thought to be due to activation of the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor c. We sought to
determine whether a next-generation thiazolidinedione with markedly diminished ability to activate peroxisome prolifera-
tor–activated receptor c (MSDC-0602) would retain its efficacy for treating NASH in a rodent model. We also deter-
mined whether some or all of these beneficial effects would be mediated through an inhibitory interaction with the
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 2 (MPC2), which was recently identified as a mitochondrial binding site for thiazolidine-
diones, including MSDC-0602. We found that MSDC-0602 prevented and reversed liver fibrosis and suppressed expres-
sion of markers of stellate cell activation in livers of mice fed a diet rich in trans-fatty acids, fructose, and cholesterol.
Moreover, mice with liver-specific deletion of MPC2 were protected from development of NASH on this diet. Finally,
MSDC-0602 directly reduced hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro, and MSDC-0602 treatment or hepatocyte MPC2
deletion also limited stellate cell activation indirectly by affecting secretion of exosomes from hepatocytes. Conclusion:
Collectively, these data demonstrate the effectiveness of MSDC-0602 for attenuating NASH in a rodent model and
suggest that targeting hepatic MPC2 may be an effective strategy for pharmacologic development. (HEPATOLOGY

 the related public health problems, there are currently
no approved medical therapies beyond weight loss and
exercise,(9,10)
which
are
difficult
to
achieve
and
maintain.(11)
Pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia)
have been used clinically as insulin-sensitizing agents
and evaluated for their effects on NASH in experimen-
tal models and clinical trials. Thiazolidinediones
(TZDs) reduced liver injury, lowered circulating trans-
aminases,
and
improved
histologic
measures
of
NASH.(12-17) Recently, pioglitazone was shown to
reverse hepatic fibrosis and other NASH measures in
an 18-month trial.(18) TZDs elicit many of their
effects by serving as activating ligands for the nuclear
receptor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor c
(PPARc).(19) While these drugs are clearly effective
insulin sensitizers and anti-inflammatories, their use is
limited by a number of known side effects that are also
mediated through activation of PPARc.(20) Recently,
we postulated that some of the beneficial effects of
TZDs might be separable from their ability to activate
PPARc and have developed “PPARc-sparing” TZDs
(MSDC-0602 and MSDC-0160), which have limited
ability to bind and activate PPARc but retain the bene-
ficial metabolic effects,(21,22) even in hepatocytes with
complete deletion of PPARc.(21)
TZDs also bind to the mitochondrial pyruvate carri-
er (MPC) at physiological concentrations(23,24) and
acutely suppress pyruvate metabolism in isolated mito-
chondria in an MPC-dependent manner.(24,25) The
MPC comprises two proteins, MPC1 and MPC2,
that form a carrier complex in the inner mitochondrial
membrane.(26)
Transport
into
the
mitochondrial
matrix is required for pyruvate metabolism and critical
for a number of metabolic pathways. The effects of
MSDC-0602 on reducing hepatocyte glucose produc-
tion in vitro were abolished in MPC2-deficient hepa-
tocytes,(24) suggesting that at least some of the
beneficial metabolic effects of this PPARc-sparing
TZD are mediated through an interaction with
MPC2.
The objective of the present study was to determine
whether MSDC-0602 might have therapeutic effects
in an experimental model of NASH and, if so, to
define whether binding to the MPC was involved. We
found that MSDC-0602 treatment reduced histologic
fibrosis,
toxic
lipid
accumulation,
and
molecular
markers of hepatic stellate cell activation in mice. We
showed that these effects were dependent on MPC2
and that hepatocyte-specific deletion of MPC2 by
itself was protective from the development of liver
injury. Finally, we showed that MSDC-0602 directly
prevents stellate cell activation in vitro and acts indi-
rectly to regulate activation by modulating exosome
release by hepatocytes in an MPC2-dependent man-
ner. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of
MSDC-0602 at reducing liver fibrosis and stellate cell
activation through effects on MPC2 and suggest that
targeting the MPC is a potential therapeutic avenue
for treating NASH.

 (2% w/w) (HTF-C diet; D09100301; Research Diets
Inc.), described to cause hepatic injury and inflamma-
tion.(27) Control mice were fed a matched low-fat (LF;
10% kcal) diet that was not supplemented with fruc-
tose
or
cholesterol
(D09100304;
Research
Diets
Inc.).(28) After remaining on the designated diets for 4
weeks, a subset of randomly selected HTF-C-fed mice
were placed on the HTF-C diet containing MSDC-
0602 potassium salt (331 ppm) for the remaining 12
weeks prior to sacrifice. This dose was chosen based on
studies showing that 331 ppm in the diet resulted in a
concentration of 2-5 lM MSDC-0602 in the blood of
obese mice (unpublished observation), was effective at
insulin sensitizing,(21) and compared with plasma
exposures examined in clinical trials.(29) In a second
trial, diet feeding was for a total of 19 weeks, and a
fourth group of mice was placed on the plain HTF-C
diet for 16 weeks and then switched to HTF-C 1 331
ppm MSDC-0602 for the remaining 3 weeks.
Body weight was checked weekly. Mice were sacri-
ficed and tissues were harvested after a 4-hour fast.
Liver, gonadal, subcutaneous, and intrascapular brown
fat tissue samples were weighed, frozen in liquid nitro-
gen, and stored at –808C.
MATERIALS
Production-scale synthesis of all TZDs for mouse
studies was conducted by USV (Mumbai, India), and
TZDs were incorporated into the experimental diets
by Research Diets Inc.
PLASMA AND LIVER
CHEMISTRIES
Plasma alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate
transaminase (AST) were measured by kinetic absor-
bance assays (Teco Diagnostics). Liver triglycerides
were measured by solubilizing 100 mg liver tissue in
saline and solubilizing lipid with 0.5% sodium deoxy-
cholate and determined by colorimetric assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
HISTOLOGIC ANALYSES
Liver sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 24 hours and then embedded in paraffin
blocks. Sections were cut and stained with either
hematoxylin and eosin or Masson’s trichrome stain.
Livers were analyzed by a liver pathologist (either
E.M.B. or I.N.), blinded to treatment group and
genotype. Steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte balloon-
ing, and fibrosis were scored according to NAFLD
activity score (NAS) and fibrosis scoring.(30)
MASS SPECTROMETRY AND
LIPID QUANTIFICATION
Oxidative stress markers (oxysterols and organic
aldehydes) were extracted with methanol from homog-
enized
liver
tissues
and
quantified
by
a
liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (Shimadzu and
Applied Biosystems) system using deuterated com-
pounds (in-house preparation and Cayman Chemical)
as internal standards and methods as described.(31)
Protein concentrations in the liver homogenates were
also determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce)
for normalization.
QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAzol method
(RNA-Bee; Tel-Test). Complementary DNA was
made by use of a high-capacity reverse-transcription
kit for liver tissues (Applied Biosystems) and a Vilo
reverse-transcription kit for isolated stellate cells (Invi-
trogen). Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI
PRISM 7500 sequence detection system and a SYBR
green master mix (Applied Biosystems). Arbitrary
units of target mRNA were corrected by measuring the
levels of 36B4 mRNA. Oligonucleotide sequences are
available upon request.
REPORTER SENSITIVE TO
PYRUVATE
Potential drug interactions with the MPC were
assessed using a bioluminescence energy transfer
(BRET)–based MPC activity system called reporter
sensitive
to
pyruvate
(RESPYR).(32,33)
Briefly,
described MPC2-RLuc8 and MPC1-Venus fusion
proteins were stably expressed in HEK293 cells using
lentiviral transduction. Assays were performed as pub-
lished,(32,33) with the addition of drug compounds after
baseline readings in the absence of pyruvate. Biolumi-
nescence and energy transfer were assessed using a
kinetic plate reader (Biotek Synergy 2) at 460 6 40
nm and 528 6 20 nm at 378C.

 STELLATE CELL ISOLATION AND
CULTURE
Primary mouse hepatic stellate cells were isolated by
collagenase perfusion during hepatocyte isolations.(24)
Stellate cells were then purified by density gradient
centrifugation using Optiprep (Sigma) as described.(34)
Cells were seeded onto standard six-well tissue culture
dishes and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 13 Pen/Strep. A subset of cells was harvested
after 24 hours to serve as quiescent control cells. All
other cells were treated as indicated and harvested after
3-7 days.(34)
EXOSOME ISOLATION, WESTERN
BLOTTING, AND STELLATE CELL
TREATMENT
Plasma exosomes were enriched from frozen plasma
collected at the end of the HTF-C diet feeding trials.
Plasma (500 lL) was first defibrinated using purified
thrombin, and then exosomes were purified using Exo-
Quick reagent (System Biosciences). For western blot-
ting analysis, whole blood or plasma exosome samples
were solubilized in 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazine ethanesulfonic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and 1% Triton X-
100 protein lysate buffer. Protein lysates (75 lg) were
run down polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were
then probed with primary antibodies for the vesicle
marker flotillin-1 (1:500, ab50671; Abcam) and the
cell marker calnexin (1:1,000, ab22595; Abcam).
Membranes were then probed with an antirabbit
IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (1:10,000; LI-
COR), and blots were developed on an infrared Odys-
sey developer (LI-COR). For stellate cell treatments,
exosome pellets were solubilized in 300 lL phosphate-
buffered saline, and day 2 stellate cell six-well cultures
were treated with either phosphate-buffered saline
vehicle control or exosomes for 24 hours before harvest
for RNA analyses.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical comparisons were made using a t test or
analysis of variance where appropriate. All data, unless
otherwise specified, are presented as mean 6 standard
error of the mean, with a statistically significant differ-
ence defined as P � 0.05.

MSDC-0602 IMPROVES LIVER
INJURY INDUCED BY HTF-C
FEEDING IN MICE
Diets containing high levels of trans-fat in the con-
text of elevated fructose and/or cholesterol provoke liv-
er injury and development of fibrosis in mice.(27,28,35)
We fed the HTF-C diet to C57BL6/J mice for 16
weeks and evaluated hepatic steatosis and liver injury.
Compared to a matched LF control diet, the HTF-C
diet induced significant weight gain (Fig. 1A) and adi-
posity (Supporting Fig. S1A,B). The HTF-C diet also
caused an increase in the liver to body weight ratio
(Fig. 1B) and increased liver triglyceride content (Fig.
1C). In a subset of mice, the HTF-C diet was fed for
4 weeks, and then MSDC-0602 was added to the
HTF-C diet for the remaining 12 weeks (HTF-
C10602). MSDC-0602 feeding suppressed body
weight gain (Fig. 1A) and adiposity (Supporting Fig.
S1A,B) independently of changes in food intake (Sup-
porting Fig. S1C). The attenuation in body weight
gain and adiposity was correlated with a marked
increase in the mass of intrascapular brown adipose tis-
sue (Supporting Fig. S1D), consistent with MSDC-
0602 directly stimulating differentiation of brown adi-
pocyte
progenitor
cells(23)
and
suggesting
that
increased energy expenditure explains the effects on
body weight. However, this aspect of the phenotype
was not explored further. MSDC-0602 did not reverse
the effects of HTF-C on liver to body weight ratios
(Fig. 1B) or improve the hepatic triglyceride accumula-
tion observed with HTF-C feeding (Fig. 1C), allowing
measurements of inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning,
and fibrosis to be made in an unbiased manner.
Plasma ALT and AST concentrations were mark-
edly increased by the HTF-C diet (Fig. 1D). However,
MSDC-0602 significantly improved plasma ALT and
AST concentrations, suggesting decreased liver injury.
Histologic evidence of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning,
and inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in
HTF-C diet–fed livers (Fig. 2A). Ductular reactions
involving progenitor cells and matrix deposition were
readily apparent in HTF-C livers (Fig. 2A, arrow).
Collagen or matrix deposition was also abundant in
HTF-C livers (Fig. 2A, arrowhead) and appeared
reduced in livers of MSDC-0602-fed animals. When
analyzed by a histopathologist blinded to treatment
groups, the NAS (sum of steatosis 1 ballooning 1

 inflammation)
was
significantly
elevated
by
the
HTF-C diet and reduced by MSDC-0602 (Fig. 2B).
Fibrosis scoring was also significantly elevated by the
HTF-C diet and reduced by MSDC-0602 (Fig. 2B).
Interestingly, although triglyceride accumulation was
not quantitatively affected (Fig. 1C), treatment with
MSDC-0602 restored characteristic zonality to lipid
deposition, with periportal zone 1 hepatocytes being
spared from steatosis (Fig. 2A). The mechanisms driv-
ing this effect can only be speculated upon; perhaps
being related to greater drug effectiveness in zone 1 due
to higher tissue perfusion, oxygen tension, and anabolic
metabolism(36) or differences in lipid profiles(37) of peri-
portal zone 1 hepatocytes. Additionally, expression of
cytochrome P450 and other xenobiotic metabolizing
enzymes is higher in perivenous zone 3 hepatocytes,(36)
suggesting greater drug metabolism and lower drug
effectiveness in zone 3 hepatocytes. Of note, the appear-
ance of the remaining zone 2 and 3 steatosis is not sig-
nificantly altered, with most hepatocytes containing a
mixture of microsteatosis and macrosteatosis.
Liver samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry
for lipid markers of oxidative stress. The HTF-C diet
caused elevated levels of oxysterols 7-ketocholesterol
and 3b,5a,6b-cholestantriol, as well as the organic
aldehydes hydroxynonenal and hydroxyhexanol (Fig.
3A). MSDC-0602 feeding either tended to or signifi-
cantly reduced these lipid markers of oxidative stress.
Lastly, liver gene expression markers of inflammatory
cytokine production, macrophage infiltration, hepatic
stellate cell activation, and fibrosis were also increased
by HTF-C diet feeding (Fig. 3B). MSDC-0602 treat-
ment did not improve markers of inflammation or
macrophage infiltration (Tnfa, Tgfb, Il1b, Cd68, and
Thbs1). However, MSDC-0602 significantly improved
markers of stellate cell activation, fibrosis, and extracel-
lular matrix remodeling (Col1a1, Col3a1, Spp1, Timp1,
Timp3, and Mmp2) (Fig. 3B). These data strongly
suggest that MSDC-0602 alleviates oxidative stress,
stellate cell activation, and matrix deposition in mice
fed an HTF-C diet.
MSDC-0602 REVERSES LIVER
INJURY INDUCED BY HTF-C
FEEDING
We also sought to determine whether MSDC-0602
could reverse, as opposed to prevent, diet-induced liver
injury and stellate cell activation by beginning drug
treatment after 16 weeks on diet, when liver injury and
fibrosis is fully manifest. Switching HTF-C mice to
HTF-C chow containing MSDC-0602 for 3 weeks
beginning at 16 weeks caused significant weight loss
(Fig. 4A). Providing mice with chow containing

 MSDC-0602 starting at 4 weeks slightly reduced liver
triglyceride content, while 3 weeks of MSDC-0602-
containing diet had no effect on liver triglycerides (Fig.
4B). However, both long-term and short-term MSDC-
0602 treatment significantly reduced plasma ALT and
AST concentrations (Fig. 4C) and improved NAS and
fibrosis scoring (Fig. 4D,E). As observed in the previous
trial, early switch to a diet containing MSDC-0602
strongly reduced markers of stellate cell fibrogenesis
(Fig. 4F). Additionally, the 3 weeks of treatment with
MSDC-0602 significantly reduced all markers of stel-
late cell fibrogenesis and extracellular matrix regulation
(Fig. 4F).
MSDC-0602 INTERACTS WITH
THE MPC
MSDC-0602 and other TZDs bind to the MPC
complex and reduce flux through this carrier.(24,25)
To demonstrate a direct interaction between MSDC-
0602 and the MPC, we used the recently described
RESPYR system(32) (Fig. 5A). Interaction with pyru-
vate, the substrate of the MPC, leads to a conforma-
tional change and an increase in energy transfer in this
BRET-based sensor.(32) Interestingly, a high-potency,
irreversible MPC inhibitor (UK-5099) also produces a
robust increase in RESPYR activity (Fig. 5B). Similar-
ly, addition of MSDC-0602 or MSDC-0160 pro-
voked a significant increase in RESPYR activity (Fig.
5B). We believe that these chemical MPC inhibitors
result in increased BRET activity due to their interac-
tion with the same binding pocket of the MPC as
pyruvate, inducing a similar conformational change in
the complex. In contrast, another TZD compound
that
lacks
insulin-sensitizing
properties
(MSDC-
1473)(23) fails to stimulate RESPYR activity (Fig. 5B).
Dose–response curves demonstrated that MSDC-
0602 was 100-fold less potent than UK-5099 and

 failed to elicit the same maximal increase in RESPYR
activity (Fig. 5C). These data are consistent with a
direct interaction between MSDC-0602 and the
MPC, though the affinity of binding and/or mecha-
nism of interaction may be different from other tradi-
tional inhibitors.
MICE WITH LIVER-SPECIFIC
DELETION OF MPC2 ARE
REFRACTORY TO LIVER INJURY
INDUCED BY THE HTF-C DIET
AND THE EFFECTS OF MSDC-0602
To examine the effects of loss of MPC function on
the response to the HTF-C diet and MSDC-0602, we
used mice with liver-specific deletion of MPC2.(24)
There was no effect of this mouse genotype on weight
gain on the HTF-C diet, and loss of MPC in the liver
did not affect the ability of MSDC-0602 to suppress
weight gain (Fig. 6A). Loss of MPC activity in liver
resulted in reduced circulating ALT and AST in
HTF-C-fed mice, and the ability of MSDC-0602 to
reduce plasma transaminase activity was lost in liver
MPC2 null mice. Similarly, fibrosis scoring and the
expression of markers of stellate cell activation were
also suppressed by genetic loss of MPC in liver, and
MSDC-0602 did not further repress the expression of
these
genes
in
LS-Mpc2–/–
mice
(Fig.
6C,D).
MSDC-0602 tended to reduce fibrosis scoring in the
knockout. However, this was not significant (P 5
0.13). Interestingly, this improvement in hepatic fibro-
sis with genetic deletion of MPC2 was despite no
improvement in hepatic steatosis as liver triglyceride
levels were unaltered (Fig. 6E). Thus, both genetic
deletion and pharmacologic inhibition of the MPC
appear to improve hepatic fibrosis without significantly
altering hepatic steatosis in this HTF-C diet–induced
NASH model.
DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS
OF MSDC-0602 ON STELLATE
CELL ACTIVATION
One of the most consistent phenotypes across our
mouse studies was that MSDC-0602 suppressed
expression of the markers of stellate cell fibrogenesis.
Treatment of isolated stellate cells with MSDC-0602
during the 7-day in vitro differentiation process mod-
erately reduced expression of the stellate cell fibrotic
markers Col1a1 and Col3a1 (Fig. 7A).

 We found that genetic deletion of Mpc2 in the liver
also led to reduced activation of stellate cells in vivo
(Fig. 6C,D). It has been suggested that the albumin
promoter may be active in stellate cells and leads to
Cre-mediated recombination in that cell type.(38)
To determine whether Mpc2 expression was affected in
stellate cells of LS-Mpc2–/– mice, we isolated hepato-
cytes and stellate cells from these mice. In our hands,
while the LS-Mpc2–/– hepatocyte fraction shows the
expected deletion of Mpc2,(24) its expression was not

 affected in LS-Mpc2–/– stellate cells in either the day 1
quiescent or day 7 activated state (Fig. 7B). This sug-
gests that the beneficial effects of genetic inhibition of
Mpc2 in LS-Mpc2–/– mice were likely not mediated
through direct effects in stellate cells. Taken together
with the modest effect of MSDC-0602 on stellate cell
activation in vitro (Fig. 7A), these data suggest that
the effects of modulating MPC2 specifically in hepato-
cytes may produce an antifibrotic paracrine signal that
contributes to the reduced stellate cell activation.
SUPPRESSION OF STELLATE
CELL ACTIVATION MAY BE
MEDIATED BY HEPATOCYTE-
DERIVED EXOSOMES
Recent work has suggested that extracellular vesicles,
called “exosomes,” that are released by hepatocytes and
other cell types can signal to stellate cells by transfer-
ring DNA, RNA, protein, or lipid contents.(39-43)
Increased exosome release by steatotic hepatocytes in
vitro and in vivo has also been suggested.(44,45) There-
fore, we next isolated exosome-enriched plasma frac-
tions from our LF diet–fed and HTF-C diet–fed mice
to test whether a paracrine signal was being released
from hepatocytes to stellate cells to affect fibrogenesis.
The plasma exosome samples were enriched for the
membrane vesicle marker flotillin-1 and devoid of the
cell marker calnexin (Fig. 7C). When stellate cell cul-
tures were treated with these plasma exosome fractions
between days 2 and 3 of culture, plasma exosomes iso-
lated from HTF-C-fed mice increased the expression
of Col1a1, Col3a1, Mmp2, and Timp1 in stellate cells
isolated from naive wild-type mice (Fig. 7D). Howev-
er, plasma exosomes isolated from mice fed the HTF-
C diet containing MSDC-0602 failed to enhance the
expression of these genes (Fig. 7D). Lastly, plasma
exosomes from HTF-C diet–fed LS-Mpc2–/– mice
also reduced the expression of stellate cell fibrogenic
markers in comparison to plasma exosomes from
HTF-C diet–fed wild-type mice (Fig. 7E). Altogether,
these data suggest that MSDC-0602 treatment or
genetic deletion of MPC2 in hepatocytes modifies
exosomes containing or lacking a factor that subse-
quently controls stellate cell activation status.
Discussion
Available evidence suggests a strong interconnection
among
insulin
resistance,
hepatic
steatosis,
and
development of NASH. Indeed, a number of studies
have suggested that insulin-sensitizing TZDs may
have efficacy for treating NASH and potentially even
reverse hepatic fibrosis.(12-18) In this study, we evaluat-
ed the efficacy of a next-generation TZD that has
extremely weak binding to PPARc but still directly
interacts with and inhibits the MPC. We found that
MSDC-0602 prevented and reversed stellate cell acti-
vation and fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH. More-
over, we show that loss of the MPC2 protein in mouse
hepatocytes also has similar protective effects on these
parameters. The present in vivo and in vitro findings
suggest that modulating MPC activity in hepatocytes
leads to production of signaling factor(s) that regulate
stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis.
Whereas we did observe a direct effect of MSDC-
0602 on stellate cell activation in vitro, several other
findings in this study suggest that drug effects on the
expression of these genes are also mediated through
effects in hepatocytes. Indeed, exosomes isolated from
plasma of HTF-C diet–fed mice promoted expression
of markers of stellate cell activation in vitro, while exo-
somes from MSDC-0602-treated or MPC2 knockout
mice did not. The caveat is that exosomes isolated
from plasma could be derived from any organ and the
drug effect may not be specific to the liver. However,
the data with exosomes isolated from LS-Mpc2–/–
mice strongly suggest that hepatocyte-derived exo-
somes play an important role in this response. In sup-
port of our findings, an unidentified signal released
from steatotic hepatocytes has been proposed to induce
hepatic stellate cell activation.(46) We also found that
MPC2, which is up-regulated in stellate cells during
activation, was not deleted in stellate cells from LS-
Mpc2–/– mice. This indicates that the albumin pro-
moter is not active in stellate cells in our hands, which
contrasts with a recent report(38) but is consistent with
a paracrine factor being elicited from MPC2-deficient
hepatocytes.
It remains to be determined what cargo of exosomes
is responsible for communicating with stellate cells in
this model of NASH and in our pharmacologic and
genetic
manipulations.
Exosomes
are
small
lipid
vesicles that contain a variety of materials including
lipids, proteins, and RNAs.(47) Delivery and uptake of
these vesicles to other cells is a relatively recently iden-
tified mechanism of cell-to-cell communication, and
this process is incompletely understood. It has been
suggested that hepatocyte-derived exosomes can regu-
late stellate cell activation.(39-43) Candidate mediators
would include mitochondrial DNA(43); microRNAs

 including let-7, miR-122-5p,(41) and miR-214(39,40);
and other noncoding RNAs.(42) Future studies will be
needed to identify the mediator(s) that signals between
hepatocytes and stellate cells in our system, as well as
how altering hepatocyte pyruvate metabolism leads to
these beneficial effects on exosome cargo.
In summary, the present data suggest that the novel
insulin-sensitizer MSDC-0602 has beneficial pharma-
cological effects to prevent and reverse stellate cell acti-
vation and fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH.
Importantly, the effects of this agent, which has inhibi-
tory effects on the activity of the MPC, were recapitu-
lated by genetic deletion of MPC2 in hepatocytes and
lost when MPC2 was deleted. The data presented
herein support a model that hepatocyte-derived exo-
somes mediate a beneficial effect of MPC2 deletion on
stellate cell activation. Though more work is needed to
completely understand mechanisms and mediators, the
present data support further studies using MPC mod-
ulators for treating NASH.
