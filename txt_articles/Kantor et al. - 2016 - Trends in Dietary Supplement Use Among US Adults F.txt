Abstract
Importance—Dietary supplements are commonly used by US adults; yet, little is known about 
recent trends in supplement use.
Objective—To report trends in dietary supplement use among US adults.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Temporal trends in supplement use were evaluated using 
nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) collected between 1999 and 2012. Participants include non-institutionalized adults 
residing in the US, surveyed over 7 continuous 2-year cycles (sample size per cycle ranged from 
4,863 to 6,213).
Exposures—Calendar time, as represented by NHANES cycle.
Main Outcomes/Measures—In an in-home interview, participants were queried on use of 
supplements in the 30 days prior. This information was used to estimate the prevalence of use 
within each NHANES cycle, and trends were evaluated across cycles. Results are presented for 
use of any supplements, use of multivitamins/multiminerals (MVMM), as defined by a product 
containing ≥10 vitamins and/or minerals, as well as use of individual vitamins, minerals, and non-
vitamin, non-mineral supplements. Results are presented overall, and by population subgroup, 
including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational status. All analyses are weighted to be 
nationally representative.

 Results—A total of 37,958 adults were included in the study [weighted mean age, 46.4 years, 
52.0% women], with an overall response rate of 74%. Overall, use of supplements remained stable 
between 1999 and 2012, with 52% of US adults reporting use of any supplements in 2011–2012 
(p-trend:0.19). This trend varied by population subgroup. Use of MVMM decreased, with 37% 
reporting use of MVMM in 1999–2000 and 31% reporting use in 2011–2012 (difference: −5.7%; 
95% CI: −8.6%, −2.7%; p-trend<0.001). Vitamin D supplementation from sources other than 
MVMM increased from 5.1% to 19% (difference: 14%; 95% CI: 12%, 17%; p-trend<0.001) and 
use of fish oil supplements increased from 1.3% to 12% (difference: 11%; 95% CI: 9.1%, 12%; p-
trend<0.001) over the study period, while use of a number of supplements decreased.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among adults in the United States, overall use of dietary 
supplements remained stable from 1999–2012, use of MVMM decreased, and trends in use of 
individual supplements varied and were heterogeneous by population subgroups.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary supplement products are commonly used by adults in the United States, with prior 
research indicating an increase in use between the 1980s and mid-2000s.1,2 Although often 
taken to improve or maintain health, less than a quarter of all supplement products used are 
taken at the recommendation of a healthcare provider.3 Instead, their use may be motivated, 
in part, by evidence suggesting that increased intake of some dietary constituents may be 
associated with reduced risk of outcomes, including cancer and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD).4,5 Even so, results from observational studies have yielded mixed results regarding 
the health benefits of individual supplements or multivitamins/multiminerals (MVMM), and 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have often not supported benefits of these supplements, 
although the duration of many RCTs may have been insufficient to observe beneficial 
effects.6–10 Furthermore, some research has indicated that use of selected supplements at 
high doses may have adverse effects,11 generating some skepticism regarding their use.12
Despite extensive research conducted on the role of dietary supplements in health, little is 
known about recent trends in supplement use. Most studies describing patterns of use are 
restricted to older adults, focus on select supplements, are unable to evaluate temporal 
trends, or do not capture use in the last decade.1,2,13,14 Using data from the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this paper therefore seeks to quantify trends 
in supplement use among US adults from 1999 to 2012, with a focus on use of any 
supplement products and MVMM, as defined by use of any products containing ≥10 
vitamins and/or minerals, as well as use of individual vitamins, minerals, and non-vitamin, 
non-mineral (NVNM) supplements.

 METHODS
Study Population
This study was conducted using data from NHANES, a nationally representative, cross-
sectional survey of civilian, non-institutionalized persons living in the United States.15 This 
analysis includes 7 two-year cycles (1999–2000 to 2011–2012), with 1999–2000 
representing the first cycle for which continuous data are available and 2011–2012 
representing the most recent cycle for which data are available. Each cycle is an independent 
sample. Participants provided written informed consent and study procedures were approved 
by the National Center for Health Statistic’s Research Ethics Review Board. The Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Institutional Review Board determined that this analysis does 
not constitute human subjects research, and does not need human subjects approval.
Supplement Use
NHANES participants were first asked if they used any prescription or non-prescription 
supplements in the prior 30 days. Persons indicating use were asked to show the interviewer 
the bottles of each supplement product taken (77.4% of supplement products were seen): a 
supplement product could be a capsule, tablet, pill, softgel, chew/gummy or other product 
containing one or more supplements. When containers were not seen, participants were 
asked to recall each product taken. By linking to databases of supplement products and 
supplement product blends, use of MVMM, vitamins, minerals, and specific supplements 
was ascertained. More detail has been provided in NHANES documentation,16 and detailed 
information on how this information was used in analysis is provided in the Supplementary 
Methods.
From this information, variables were created for use of any supplement product in the prior 
30 days, use of ≥4 supplement products, as well as use of any vitamin, any mineral, and use 
of MVMM (defined as a product containing ≥10 vitamins and/or minerals).17 This definition 
was created to capture products labeled as multivitamins in the market place (i.e., 
supplements used by consumers as a non-specific dietary supplement, commonly containing 
the recommended daily values of multiple vitamins, and typically including minerals, as 
well). However, this definition did not require any minerals to be in the formulation because 
several of the most popular multivitamin brands during the period of the surveys did not 
have minerals. The cutoff of 10 vitamins and/or minerals was used to separate common 
MVMMs from more specialized supplements such as B-complex supplements and 
supplements developed for eye and bone health. However, to allow for comparison to prior 
NHANES analyses, a secondary MVMM variable, defined as products containing ≥3 
vitamins and ≥1 mineral, is also presented.3
Variables were also created corresponding to individual vitamins, minerals, and NVNM 
supplements. To distinguish how supplements are consumed, results are presented both 
overall (i.e., any use) and exclusive of MVMM supplements (e.g., vitamin D not from 
MVMM). This is important because supplements consumed as part of MVMM are often 
consumed at lower doses than they are in individual or focused combination supplements,

 and because understanding how supplements are consumed can help inform our 
understanding of trends. Primary analyses focus on any use during the prior 30 days.
Statistical Analyses
The prevalence of supplement use, as determined by use in the prior 30 days, was assessed 
within each NHANES cycle. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to calculate a P-
trend across cycles; the statistical significance of trends was evaluated using a two-sided test 
at the α=0.05 level. Ratios for the prevalence of use in 2011–2012 vs. 1999–2000 are 
presented; in the presentation of results, a ‘decrease’ corresponds to a ratio<1 and p-
trend<0.05, an ‘increase’ represents a ratio>1 and p-trend<0.05, and ‘stable’ represents a p-
trend≥0.05. Differences, representing the absolute difference in the prevalence of use in 
2011–2012 vs. 1999–2000, are also presented.
Because most supplemental vitamins/minerals are consumed in the form of MVMM and 
total use was of most interest, trends in main tables are shown for total supplement use. 
However, results are also presented exclusive of MVMM if the trends with and without 
MVMM markedly varied. Detailed trends, both overall and exclusive of MVMM, are 
provided in supplementary tables. Throughout the text, the discussion of trends refers to 
overall trends in any use of a given dietary supplement (regardless of whether consumed as 
part of a MVMM), unless otherwise noted.
As data are presented on a large number of supplements, the discussion focuses on 
supplements fitting the following criteria: i) a high prevalence of use (>10% during any 
cycle), and ii) a large change in use over the study period (>3-fold change). Given potential 
heterogeneity by population subgroup, results are presented by age (20–39y, 40–64y, ≥65y), 
sex, self-reported race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-
American), and education (highest attained degree: <high school, high school/some college, 
≥4-year college)
Sensitivity analyses are presented for regular use (defined as use ≥15 days/month) and age-
adjusted trends. To address whether the trends were consistent over the study period, 
joinpoint regression analyses were conducted and the annual percentage change (APC) 
before and after potential inflection points were calculated using Joinpoint Regression 
Program Software (version 4.2.0, National Cancer Institute).18
NHANES is a stratified, complex, multistage probability-based survey that oversamples 
certain groups, and as such, all participants are assigned analytic weights to account for their 
unequal sampling probability and non-response. Analyses were conducted using Stata 13.1 
(College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Over these 7 NHANES cycles, 38,024 adults aged ≥20y completed an in-home interview, 
where supplement use was ascertained. Sixty-six persons were excluded due to missing 
information on supplement use, leaving 37,958 persons (sample size per cycle: 4,863–

 6,213). The response rate was 73.6%, with the cycle-specific response rate ranging from 
67.4%–78.3%.19
In 2011–2012, 52% (95% CI:49%, 55%) of US adults reported using any supplement 
product in the prior 30 days (Table 1). Supplement use was associated with several socio-
demographic variables. For example, supplement use increased with age, with 72% of adults 
ages 65+ reporting use (95% CI: 69%, 75%), as compared to 40% of adults ages 20–39 
(95% CI: 35%, 45%). Women (58%; 95% CI: 55%, 62%) were also more likely to use 
supplements than men (45%; 95% CI: 42%, 49%). Use was highest among non-Hispanic 
whites (58%; 95% CI: 55%, 62%), and lowest among Mexican-Americans (29%; 95% CI: 
25%, 33%). There was an educational gradient, with use highest among the most highly 
educated: 65% (95% CI: 61%, 69%) of those with ≥4-year college degree reported use, as 
compared to 37% (95% CI: 34%, 40%) of those with <a high school degree.
Overall, there was no change in overall supplement use, with 52% reporting use in 1999–
2000 and in 2011–2012 (difference:0.0%; 95% CI: −3.6%, 3.6%) (Table 2). There was also 
no change in use of ≥4 supplement products, with 9.9% reporting use of 4 supplement 
products in 2011–2012 (difference:1.1%; 95% CI: −0.8%, 3.0%). However, use of MVMM, 
as defined by a product containing ≥10 vitamins and/or minerals, decreased from 37% to 
31% (difference: −5.7%; 95% CI: −8.6%, −2.7%). The trend in MVMM use also 
significantly decreased when alternatively defined by use of products containing ≥3 vitamins 
and ≥1 mineral, with use decreasing from 39% to 36% (difference: −3.6%; 95% CI: −6.8%, 
−0.4%). Use of any vitamin remained stable, with 48% (95% CI: 45%, 50%) reporting use 
in 2011–2012, although use of any vitamin, excluding MVMM, increased. Use of any 
mineral/element decreased from 42% to 39% (difference: −3.0%; 95% CI: −6.5%, 0.4%), 
although use of mineral/elements was stable when excluding MVMM.
There was a decrease in use of several vitamins and minerals overall (Table 2), including 
vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. The decreases in these supplements persisted when 
excluding MVMM (eTable 1). Although use of most vitamins and minerals decreased, this 
was not universal. For example, vitamin D, the most commonly used vitamin in 2011–2012, 
remained stable overall; however, use excluding MVMM increased almost 4-fold (5.1% to 
19%; difference:14%; 95% CI:12%, 17%). Use of lycopene-containing supplements (mostly 
MVMM) increased almost 9-fold (1.9% to 16% among men; difference:14%; 95% CI:12%, 
16%); use of lycopene also increased among women, although use was markedly lower than 
among men.
Use of several NVNM supplements increased (Table 3; eTable 2). Omega-3 fatty acids 
increased almost 7-fold, with 1.9% of adults reporting use in 1999–2000 and 13% in 2011–
2012 (difference:11%; 95% CI:9.4%, 13%). Omega-3 fatty acids were the most commonly 
used NVNM in 2011–2012. This trend was primarily driven by the 9-fold increase in fish oil 
(1.3% to 12%; difference:11%; 95% CI:9.1%, 12%), although use of alpha-linolenic acid/
flaxseed also increased. Omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acid supplement use increased, as did 
use of co-enzyme Q10, cranberry, green tea/epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 
methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and probiotics.

 Use of Echinacea decreased, as did use of garlic, gingko biloba, ginseng, and para-
aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Use of glucosamine and chondroitin did not significantly 
change, nor did use of amino acids or fiber.
Trends by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education were also evaluated (eTables 3–6). Any 
supplement use decreased among adults ages 20–39y, was stable among ages 40–64y, and 
increased among adults ages 65+y (eTable 3; Figure 1). Although women reported more 
supplement use than men, trends were stable in both groups groups (eTable 4; Figure 1). Use 
of any supplements remained stable among non-Hispanic whites and Mexican-Americans, 
but increased among non-Hispanic blacks (eTable 5; Figure 1). Use of supplements 
remained stable among those with less than a high school education, but decreased among 
those in higher education groups (eTable 6; Figure 1).
The overall decrease in use of MVMM was largely driven by a decrease among adults ages 
40–64y, with no change observed among older adults (eTable 3; eFigure 1). Use of MVMM 
decreased significantly among non-Hispanic whites, but remained stable among non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans (eTable 5; eFigure 1). Use of MVMM decreased 
for both men and women (eTable 4; eFigure 1) and for all education groups (eTable 6; 
eFigure 1).
Subgroup-specific estimates are presented in Figure 2 for the most commonly used vitamin/
mineral, vitamin D, and in eFigure 2 for the most commonly used NVNM, fish oil. Use of 
vitamin D (exclusive of MVMM) and fish oil and increased in all population subgroups. 
However, when including MVMM, increased use of vitamin D was observed only in those 
aged ≥65y (eTable 3), females (eTable 4), and Non-Hispanic blacks (eTable 5). When 
exploring use among adult women of childbearing age (20–44y) (eTables 7–8), use of any 
supplement products and MVMM decreased. Use of folic acid-containing supplements 
decreased; however, use of folic acid exclusive of MVMM remained stable.
Trends were relatively comparable for regular use (eTable 9–10), and when adjusting for age 
(eTable 11).
No significant joinpoints were observed for overall supplement use or MVMM (eTable 12). 
However, a significant joinpoint, indicating a change in trend, was observed for a number of 
supplements. Most notably, lycopene increased dramatically prior to 2003–2004 
(APC=130%; 95% CI:62%, 226%), decreasing thereafter (APC=−4.5%; 95% CI: −7.2%, 
−1.6%).
DISCUSSION
In this large, nationally representative survey of US adults, supplement use remained stable 
from 1999–2012, with 52% of adults reporting use of supplements in the prior 30 days in 
1999–2000 and 2011–2012. Use of MVMM, as defined by a product containing ≥10 
vitamins and/or minerals, decreased from 37% to 31%. Trends varied for individual 
supplements, and across age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.

 The stable trend in overall supplement use stands in contrast to earlier studies reporting their 
increase between the 1980s and early-2000s.1,2 With the present data, it is clear that the use 
of supplements among US adults has stabilized. This stabilization appears to be the balance 
of several opposing trends, with a major contributing downward factor being the decrease in 
use of MVMM. This trend may reflect increased scrutiny of MVMM,12 following several 
studies showing no benefit.7,10,20 Furthermore, in the mid-to-late 2000s, several expert 
bodies released statements or recommendations concluding that there is either insufficient or 
no evidence to support use of MVMM or supplements to prevent chronic disease.21–23 It is 
also possible that the economic downturn in the late 2000s may have also impacted trends in 
use. The Physicians’ Health Study II RCT demonstrated that daily MVMM use modestly 
reduced total cancer incidence in men;24 however, this study was published in 2012, and 
would not have influenced our findings.
Beyond the decrease for MVMM, a decrease was also observed in use of most vitamins and 
minerals, including antioxidants vitamins C, E, and selenium. These trends persisted when 
limited to non-MVMM supplements, indicating that these downward trends were not solely 
due to the decrease in MVMM use, but also to the decrease in use of individual or smaller 
combinations containing these antioxidants. This decrease likely reflects increasing 
skepticism regarding antioxidant supplements,12 following the publication of studies which 
demonstrated no or adverse effects on various outcomes.9,11,25–27
Despite the decrease in MVMM and many vitamins/minerals, not all decreased. Although 
overall vitamin D supplement use remained stable, a marked increase in vitamin D 
supplement use exclusive of MVMM was observed. This indicates that this increase is not 
due to increased inclusion of vitamin D in MVMM supplements but rather to an increase in 
individual vitamin D supplements or more focused combinations. This increase aligns with a 
growing body of research evaluating the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D on a 
number of health outcomes, including fractures, cancer, CVD, and multiple sclerosis.28–31 
Such research likely increased public awareness about the potential benefits of vitamin D 
and testing for vitamin D insufficiency,32 contributing to the increase observed here and in a 
recent study of older adults.14
Use of lycopene-containing supplements also increased. A significant joinpoint for lycopene 
use was observed in 2005–2006, at which time lycopene was used by 25% of men. This 
increase in the early 2000s followed well-publicized research suggesting that consumption 
of lycopene-rich tomato products was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer.4 This 
trend was almost entirely driven by MVMM; this increase was due to increased inclusion of 
lycopene in MVMM formulations, not increased use of individual lycopene supplements.
Use of omega-3 fatty acid-containing supplements also increased; this trend was largely 
driven by an increase in fish oil supplements, although an increase in alpha-linolenic acid/
flaxseed was also observed. This increase, which has been observed previously,13,14 likely 
reflects increased research and subsequent media attention for the potential benefits of fish/
omega-3 fatty acid intake and fish oil supplements on risk of cancer and CVD.5,33,34 The 
ongoing Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), when complete, will provide valuable

 information to guide consumers and health care providers regarding the effects of omega-3 
fatty acids and vitamin D.35
Not all NVNM supplements increased; many remained stable and a decrease was observed 
for several, including those that were amongst the most popular in the early-2000s,36 
including ginseng, gingko, and garlic. The decline in gingko may be related to a 2002 RCT 
observing no effect of ginkgo on memory function, its primary indication.37 Furthermore, 
while glucosamine and chondroitin remained stable, a significant joinpoint was observed in 
2005–2006, after which use declined. This is likely due to the 2006 Glucosamine/
Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial, which found no effect of these supplements on joint 
structure/function.8
The trend in any supplement use varied by age, with use decreasing among young adults, 
stable among middle-aged adults, and increasing among older adults. Arecent study of 
adults ages 62–85y, which found that supplement use among older adults rose from 51.8% 
in 2005–2006 to 63.7% in 2010–2011;14 an increase among older adults was also observed, 
but this increase does not hold for other age groups. Use of MVMM decreased significantly 
among non-Hispanic whites and more highly educated groups. The reasons for these 
patterns are unclear. It is possible that the difference in trends in MVMM use by age group 
may reflect a cohort effect, but a longer time frame would be needed to address this 
question. It is also possible that differences in trends by population subgroup reflect that 
research translates into behavior change more quickly in certain population subgroups,38,39 
although differences across subgroups also likely reflect underlying health status and 
socioeconomic differences.3
This study has several important strengths. This study was conducted using data from a large 
nationally representative survey. Supplement use was assessed during an in-home interview, 
in which participants provided detailed information on supplements used over the prior 30 
days; supplement bottles were seen for the majority of supplements, likely increasing 
accuracy of exposure measurement. Furthermore, this data was collected as part of a 
continuous national survey, allowing for evaluation of trends over a 14-year period. Even so, 
the present study has important limitations. This is a study of the non-institutionalized, 
civilian population, and does not capture use among adults in nursing homes or the military. 
Furthermore, supplements were assessed in the prior 30 days, which may underestimate any 
use over the year prior for supplements that may vary seasonally, such as those commonly 
taken for colds; however, this would not influence our ability to detect trends in use over 
time. This analysis uses the most recently available data (available through 2011–2012), and 
it is unknown whether or how these findings reflect dietary supplement use at present. 
Furthermore, this manuscript focuses on any use in the prior 30 days, although sensitivity 
analyses do include evaluate trends in regular use of supplements. The analyses did not 
incorporate information on dose, as the intention was to assess prevalence of use in the 
population, rather than population-level exposure. It also did not incorporate information 
about adherence. Fifth, the serial cross-sectional study design precluded longitudunal 
measurement of supplement use within the same individuals.

 KEY POINTS
Question
As little is known about recent patterns in supplement use, this manuscript describes 
patterns of dietary supplement use among US adults from 1999–2012.
Findings
In the nationally representative National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey, use 
of any supplement products remained stable between 1999 and 2012, with 52% of US 
adults reporting use of any supplements in both 1999–2000 and 2011–2012. Patterns 
varied by individual supplements, and multivitamin/multimineral use decreased, with 
37% reporting use in 1999–2000 and 31% reporting use in 2011–2012.
Meaning
While any use of dietary supplement products remained stable in recent years, patterns 
varied by individual supplements.

ABBREVIATIONS: MVMM (Multivitamin/multimineral)
*Indicates that the trend markedly varied for overall use and use excluding MVMM, and therefore both trends are presented. Detailed information on each trend, both overall and exclusive of MVMM is presented in eTable 2.
aAmong adults ages ≥ 20 years.
bResults are presented for any use of each individual supplement, regardless of whether taken as an individual supplement or as a combination supplement, such as a MVMM. Results are also presented exclusive of MVMM if the two trends markedly varied. In these cases, both 
results (inclusive and exclusive of MVMM) are marked by a star so as to indicate that results are presented both ways.
cA ‘decrease’ corresponds to a ratio<1 and p-trend<0.05, an ‘increase’ represents a ratio>1 and p-trend<0.05, and ‘stable’ represents a p-trend≥0.05.
dData are weighted to be nationally representative. If the relative standard error exceeds 30%, data are suppressed (as indicated by a dash), consistent with NHANES reporting guidelines.20
eDefined as supplement products containing ten or more vitamins and/or minerals. This is the primary definition used in this paper, and is the variable used when defining use exclusive of MVMM elsewhere in the paper and tables.
fDefined as supplements containing three or more vitamins and 1 or more minerals
