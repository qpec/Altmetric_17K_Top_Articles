recent romantic rejection. We compared these effects with placebo effects on physical (heat) pain, which are thought to depend on
pathways connecting prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Placebo treatment, compared with control, reduced both social
and physical pain, and increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in both modalities. Placebo further altered the
relationship between affect and both dlPFC and PAG activity during social pain, and effects on behavior were mediated by a pathway

Introduction
Placebo effects are improvements in symptoms caused by treat-
ment cues, expectations, and the psychosocial context in which
treatment takes place. Placebo effects are especially important in
the treatment of pain and depression, although their effects ex-
tend to a large number of other conditions as well (Kirsch and
Sapirstein, 1998; Benedetti, 2008; Weimer et al., 2015). Placebo
effects tap into endogenous brain processes that promote healing;
thus, understanding them can help us understand the central
mechanisms by which therapies may work across disorders (Price
et al., 2008; Wager and Fields, 2013). Yet, although placebo effects
on physical pain have been relatively well studied, they have sel-
dom been compared with placebo effects on other affective pro-
cesses and clinical disorders.
A literature on the neurophysiological mechanisms of placebo
effects on affective states is emerging, with recent studies on depres-
sion (Leuchter et al., 2002; Mayberg et al., 2002; Pecin
˜a et al., 2015),
negativeemotion(Petrovicetal.,2005;Schienleetal.,2014;Meyeret
al., 2015), and pleasure and value (Plassmann et al., 2008; Ellingsen
et al., 2013). This literature suggests potential common mechanisms
across disorders, based on placebo-induced reductions in stress and
negative affect, and engagement in positive appraisal (Flaten et al.,
2011; Wager and Atlas, 2015). Recent findings suggest transfer
from placebo effects on pain to reductions in negative emotional
states (Zhang and Luo, 2009; Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015). Yet, placebo
effects on many of the affective processes central to the develop-
ment of psychopathology have not been studied. Among these,
the “pain” of social rejection is particularly important and among
the most aversive events humans experience. It is long-lasting
(Chen et al., 2008) and associated with depression, substance use,

shape the emotional experience of other important stressors and life events. Here, we use brain imaging to show that placebo
treatment reduces the painful feelings associated with a recent romantic rejection by recruiting a prefrontal-brainstem network
and by shifting the relationship between brain activity and affect. Our findings suggest that this brain network may be important
for nonspecific treatment effects across a wide range of therapeutic approaches and mental health conditions.

 increased stress-induced inflammation,
and other negative health outcomes
(Eisenberger and Cole, 2012; Murphy et
al., 2015). Individuals who experience a
targeted romantic rejection are 20 times
more likely to develop depression than the
general population (Slavich et al., 2010).
Rejection may also be particularly amena-
ble to interventions that target appraisal
processes (Kross et al., 2007), making it an
important process to study at the brain
and psychological levels. The present
study compared the brain mechanisms of
placebo effects on social rejection-related
distress (“social pain”) with those on heat
pain (placebo analgesia).
Neuroimaging studies of placebo effects
on physical pain suggest that activation of
prefrontal areas, including dorsolateral
(dlPFC), rostral anterior cingulate cortex
(rACC), orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), influ-
ences pain by activating descending pain
regulatory pathways in the brainstem, espe-
ciallyopioidergicmechanismsintheperiaq-
ueductal gray (PAG) (Vogt et al., 1993;
Benedetti et al., 1999; Petrovic et al., 2002;
Bingeletal.,2007;Wageretal.,2007;Scottet
al., 2008; Eippert et al., 2009; Wager and At-
las,2015).Prefrontal-PAGpathwaysareim-
portant in animal models of pain control as
well. PAG pathways mediate multiple types
of behavioral context effect on pain (Fields
et al., 2006), and prefrontal stimulation in
rats evokes PAG- and opioid-mediated an-
algesia (Zhang et al., 1997).
Effects of placebo treatment on social
rejection-related pain have not been stud-
ied, and no studies have directly com-
pared them with placebo effects on physical pain, although
previous work has implicated the opioid system in social pain
(Panksepp et al., 1980; Way et al., 2009). A recent PET study (Hsu
et al., 2013) suggests that increased opioidergic activation of lim-
bic and brainstem areas during social rejection is associated with
resilience, implying opioid involvement in the endogenous reg-
ulation of rejection and other negative emotions (Zubieta et al.,
2003; Ribeiro et al., 2005).
We therefore hypothesized that the PAG might be recruited by
frontal regions that represent placebo-induced beliefs and expec-
tations, especially the dlPFC and the vmPFC/OFC/rACC (Fig.
1A). We predicted that activation of these prefrontal and brains-
tem regions would mediate placebo responses to social and phys-
ical pain.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Forty right-handed participants (19 male, 21 female, mean age 20.8
years, range 18–28 years) who experienced an unwanted breakup of
their romantic relationship within the past 6 months (mean � 2.74
months, SD � 1.7 months) were recruited for the experiment (base-
line data reported in Kross et al., 2011). All participants were screened
for neurological and psychiatric illnesses, psychoactive medication,
and MRI exclusion criteria. Experimental groups (Placebo vs Con-
trol) were matched with respect to demographic variables, clinical
questionnaire scores, and characteristics of the romantic relationship
and breakup. Twenty additional participants were tested at a later
time point and assigned to a distancing manipulation after baseline.
Because of potential cohort effects, and to focus on placebo effects
only, data from this additional group (Woo et al., 2014) are not
reported here. All participants gave written informed consent and
were paid for their time. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Columbia University.
Procedures
Task design. All participants performed multiple separate runs that con-
tained eight trials of either a social rejection task or a heat pain task (Fig.
1B), presented in counterbalanced order (Kross et al., 2011). Each trial in
the social rejection task started with the presentation of a fixation cross
for 7 s. Then participants were presented with a photo of their ex-partner
or a friend (15 s) and subsequently had to rate (5 s) how they felt using a
5 point scale (from 1 � very bad to 5 � very good). Trials were separated
by short epochs of a visuospatial control task to prevent carryover effects
(Kross et al., 2011). The heat pain task had a parallel design, with either
painful or nonpainful thermal stimulation administered to the left volar
forearm for 15 s, again followed by the participants’ affect rating and the
visuospatial control task. Affect, rather than pain intensity, was rated in
both modalities to make them more comparable with each other. Past
placebo studies have identified placebo effects on intensity, affect, or
both, but they are often highly correlated under normative conditions
(r � 0.9) (Wager et al., 2004).

Koban et al. • Placebo Effects on Social Pain
 Stimuli. For the social rejection task, we collected headshot photo-
graphs of each participant’s ex-partner (Ex-Partner condition) and of a
same-gendered friend with whom they shared a positive experience dur-
ing the time of the romantic relationship breakup (Friend condition).
Further, cue phrases were presented beneath each photograph that di-
rected participants to focus on reexperiencing the emotions associated
with each of those events/persons (Kross et al., 2011). Thermal stimula-
tion was applied using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc) with a
16 mm thermode endplate at individually calibrated temperatures, rated
as either only mildly painful (Warm, 2 of 10 point scale) or painful (Heat
pain, 8 of 10 point scale) (Kross et al., 2011).
Placebo intervention. Following the preintervention period, partici-
pants were randomly assigned to a Placebo or a Control group (N � 20
each) and then performed again two runs of each task (Postinterven-
tion). All participants received a nasal spray containing saline solution,
but with different instructions to evoke specific treatment expectations.
In the Placebo condition, they were told that the nasal spray was a “pow-
erful analgesic that is also effective in reducing emotional pain and neg-
ative affect.” Participants in the Control condition were told that the spray
contained a simple saline solution that was used to improve the contrast of
the fMRI images but had otherwise no effects. We used a multilevel GLM to
assess the effects of the intervention on single-trial affect ratings in the Ex-
Partner (social) and Heat (physical pain) conditions.
fMRI data acquisition and statistical analysis
Acquisition and preprocessing. Functional imaging data were acquired
using a GE 1.5T scanner covering the whole brain in 24 axial slices (3.5 �
3.5 � 4.5 mm voxels), with a T2*-weighted spiral in-out sequence (TR �
2 s, TE � 40 ms, flip angle � 84°, FOV � 22 cm). Preprocessing of
functional images was performed with SPM8 (RRID: SCR_007037), us-
ing motion correction, slice-time correction, spatial normalization to
MNI space, and spatial smoothing using a 8 mm FWHM Gaussian ker-
nel. For spatial normalization, T1-spoiled, gradient-recalled structural
images were first coregistered to the mean functional image and normal-
ized to the SPM template using unified segmentation. Resulting images
were sampled at 3 � 3 � 3 mm resolution.
Pattern expression. Previously, we identified two multivariate patterns
trained on the preintervention phase alone, collapsing across Placebo
and Control groups, which sensitively discriminated the Ex-Partner ver-
sus Friend conditions, and the Heat versus Warm conditions, respec-
tively (Woo et al., 2014). These patterns provide a priori, rejection- and
pain-related brain markers for testing placebo effects after intervention.
Testing distributed patterns is advantageous, as research on emotion
suggests that distributed representations are required to capture the pro-
cesses that contribute to creating emotional experiences (Chang et al.,
2015; Wager et al., 2015).
For this purpose, we first computed a GLM, including regressors for
Friend, Ex-Partner, Warm, and Heat epochs. Additional regressors mod-
eled the affect rating periods and the visuospatial control task. Movement
parameters were added as regressors of no interest to control for motion
artifacts and spikes. Contrast images were computed for each condition
versus baseline, separately for Preintervention and Postintervention. We
then calculated the cross-product (as a measure of pattern expression) of
these individual contrast images (Ex-Partner Post and Pre, Heat Post and
Pre) with the patterns trained to classify rejection and heat pain during
the Preintervention epoch (Woo et al., 2014).
Multilevel mediation analysis. Based on previous work (Vogt et al.,
1993; Mayberg et al., 2002; Petrovic et al., 2002; Bingel et al., 2006;
Eippert et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2013; Wager and Atlas, 2015), we tested
whether placebo effects on social pain were mediated by dlPFC-PAG/
brainstem and vmPFC/OFC/rACC-PAG/brainstem pathways (Fig. 1A).
We thus conducted a multilevel mediation model, described below, in
these key regions. We focus here on prefrontal-brainstem pathways be-
cause they have been the most consistently involved in both placebo
effects (Wager and Atlas, 2015) and opioid effects on pain and rejection
(Fields et al., 2006; Hsu et al., 2013).
We first obtained single-trial � estimates of rejection-related brain
activity by including one regressor for each Friend, Ex-Partner, Warm,
and Heat epoch to a GLM. Additional regressors again modeled the affect
rating periods and the visuospatial control task, and movement param-
eters were added as regressors of no interest to control for motion arti-
facts and spikes. To avoid that single-trial estimates could be driven by
movement artifacts or other noise, trial estimates with variance inflation
factors �5 were excluded from further analysis (Atlas et al., 2010). We
then tested relationships between Time (Post-treatment vs Pretreat-
ment), single-trial brain activity, and affect ratings across individual
trials using multilevel mediation analysis, with Group as a second-level
(between-person) moderator (Kenny et al., 2003; Atlas et al., 2010) (Fig.
1D). Multilevel mediation analysis identifies three steps in a potential
mechanistic pathway underlying placebo effects: (1) brain regions that
show activity increases or decreases during placebo (Path a), (2) brain
regions that predict changes in affect (Path b), when controlled for Path
a, and (3) brain regions that formally mediate the relationship between
intervention and changes in affect (Path ab), which significantly reduce
the strength of the direct Path c�. Given that we aimed for functional
changes due to placebo treatment specifically and to control for potential
habituation or Time effects (i.e., Postintervention � Preintervention),
we included Group (Placebo � Control) as a second-level moderator
(placebo effects on Paths a, b, and ab). Resulting activation maps were
thresholded at p � 0.05 FDR (corresponding to a voxel threshold of p �
0.00026 for social and p � 0.00014 for physical pain) corrected across the
whole brain and across mediation paths (Atlas et al., 2010). To facilitate
interpretation of the functional maps, adjacent voxels were displayed at
thresholds of p � 0.005 and p � 0.05 uncorrected. We focus the presen-
tation of our results in a priori regions of interests: right dlPFC, PAG/
brainstem, and vmPFC/OFC/rACC (Fig. 1A). These regions of interest
(ROIs) were derived from a previous meta-analysis (Meissner et al., 2011;
Wager and Fields, 2013) at a more liberal threshold of 3 peaks within 15
mm for dlPFC and vmPFC/OFC/rACC, to cover not only meta-analytic
peaks but also extended activations of prefrontal areas. The PAG/brain-
stem ROI was extracted at the original threshold of 10 mm to avoid
extension into thalamic and cerebellar areas, which we did not hypothe-
size to play a central role in placebo effects. The PAG is a small structure,
and this ROI includes other adjacent brainstem areas as well, such as
parts of the superior colliculus and the dorsal raphe nucleus (Fig. 1A). To
display the direction of the moderation effects, � weights were extracted
for significant clusters and plotted separately for both experimental
groups. To explore the role of additional brain areas in addition to the
ROIs, we present whole-brain results at the same FDR-corrected thresh-
old (p � 0.05).
dlPFC pattern similarity analysis. To test whether mediation of placebo
effects on social versus physical pain were driven by separable activation
patterns in the dlPFC, we compared individual (person-level) images for
the social pain mediation effect (Path ab) with images for the physical
pain mediation effects for individuals in the Placebo group (N � 20). We
trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify to which modality
(social or physical) each map belonged. To assess the accuracy of the
classifier, we used a cross-validation procedure, in which the two medi-
ation images for each subject served as a holdout set once, resulting in a
20-fold (leave-one-subject out) cross-validation. Accuracy is reported on
forced-choice tests on holdout (test) images. To test whether this pattern
was indeed driven by the mediation of the placebo effects and not by
residual activity due to rejection versus heat pain, we performed the same
SVM analysis in the Control group as well.
Results
Social rejection
Behavioral results
We tested for placebo effects on reported rejection and pain ex-
perience using a multilevel GLM. In line with our prediction,
placebo treatment reduced social pain, as evidenced by a signifi-
cant effect of Placebo versus Control Group on Pretreatment
versus Post-treatment negative affect (t(38) � 3.3, p � 0.001, Co-
hen’s d � 1.04). This effect is shown in Figure 1C. No significant
changes were observed for the Friend condition.

 Placebo effects on an a priori fMRI marker
of rejection
To test for placebo effects on the expres-
sion of the social rejection pattern (devel-
oped by Woo et al., 2014), as in previous
studies (Wager et al., 2013), we calculated
the cross-product of the social-rejection
pattern (Woo et al., 2014) with the indi-
vidual contrast images for the Ex-Partner
condition Preintervention and Postinter-
vention. This provided a single number
for each participant that reflected the in-
tensity of activation in the rejection pat-
tern. We expected a reduction in the
rejection signature with placebo. Paired t
tests between Placebo and Control groups
revealed a greater decrease in rejection
pattern expression in the Placebo com-
pared with the Control group Postinter-
vention compared with Preintervention
(t(19) � 2.2, p � 0.022), due to a signifi-
cantly lower pattern expression Postinter-
vention in the Placebo compared with the
Control group (t(19) � 1.8, p � 0.042).
Placebo effects on
prefrontal-brainstem pathways
Our moderated mediation model tests for
placebo-induced changes (Post vs Pre) in
brain activity (placebo effect on Path a)
and in brain activity mediating the effect
on behavioral outcomes (placebo effect
on Path ab). It also tests whether the
brain predictors of affect ratings varied
significantly across groups (placebo ef-
fect on Path b), which would indicate
placebo-induced changes in the rela-
tionships between brain activity and af-
fective experience. Such changes could
indicate recruitment of different local
circuits within affective brain regions
under placebo, possibly related to dif-
ferences in the quality of cognitive
appraisal.
The results of this analysis, testing mediation of placebo effects
on social pain in three key regions, dlPFC, vmPFC/OFC/rACC,
and PAG/brainstem, are shown in Figure 2. In line with our hy-
pothesis, the right dlPFC showed significant effects for group
differences on all three paths, in partially overlapping clusters
(Fig. 2A). Following treatment, activity increased more in the
Placebo compared with the Control group (placebo effect on
Path a, peak coordinates x � 52, y � �4, z � 46, Z � 9.79).
Further, functional activity in right dlPFC was correlated with
more positive affect ratings in the Placebo group, but not in the
Control group (placebo effect on Path b, x � 32, y � 2, z � 50,
Z � 9.19). This indicates that placebo treatment altered the func-
tional relationship between activity and affective outcomes, and
specifically that the contents of activated dlPFC representations
were more strongly associated with positive affect under Placebo.
Several clusters in right dlPFC also showed significant group dif-
ferences in mediation effects (placebo effect on Path ab, x � 44,
y � 0, z � 34, Z � 8.91), confirming a key role of this region in
mediating placebo treatment effects on behavioral outcomes.
The vmPFC/OFC/rACC (Fig. 2B) showed clusters of moder-
ated Path a and moderated Path b effects, but no mediation
effects. Activity in vmPFC/medial OFC increased from Pretreat-
ment to Post-treatment more in the Placebo than in the Control
group (placebo effect on Path a, x � �14, y � 40, z � �20, Z �
7.12). Activity in adjacent subgenual rACC correlated positively
with affect in the Placebo, but not the Control group (placebo
effect on Path b, x � �12, y � 30, z � �14, Z � 12.66).
Finally, a placebo effect on Path b effect was found in the PAG
and adjacent brainstem areas (Fig. 2C; x � 0, y � �30, z � �16,
Z � 11.49), indicating again a strong positive relationship be-
tween activity in this region and affect in the Placebo group, but a
negative relationship between activity and affect in the Control
group. Interestingly, although activity in the PAG/brainstem was
strongly correlated with affect ratings (placebo effect on Path b),
it was not strongly enough affected by the placebo manipulation
to reach significance (placebo effect on Path a).
Ouradditional,exploratorywhole-brainanalysis(Fig.3)showed
the involvement of further regions in placebo effects on social pain.
Most notably, parts of the insula were more positively predictive for

and dorsal parietal areas (Fig. 3A,B), in agreement with previous
findings (e.g., Wager et al., 2004, 2011). Mediation effects (Path ab;
Fig. 3C) were most prominent in right dlPFC, brainstem, and pos-
terior cingulate cortex.
Based on our theoretical model of placebo effects on social pain
(Fig. 1A), we next tested whether the regulatory role of the PAG/
brainstem was driven by top-down input from the vmPFC/OFC/
rACC,thedlPFC,oranotherbrainregion.Activityinfrontalregions
may represent treatment expectations that could recruit descending
opioidergic pathways and thereby influence the regulatory role of
brainstem areas, such as the PAG (Vogt et al., 1993; Petrovic et al.,
2002; Bingel et al., 2006; Eippert et al., 2009; Bu
¨chel et al., 2014;
Wager and Atlas, 2015; Koban et al., 2017). Thus, we conducted a
three-path mediation analysis (Taylor et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2015)
in the Placebo group, searching to identify brain regions that
(1) respond to placebo treatment and (2) influence affect ratings via
PAG/brainstem activity (Fig. 4A). The results of this whole-brain
analysis showed a significant three-path mediation effect in a cluster
intherightdlPFC(x�23,y�15,z�47;Fig.4B),whichoverlapped
in location with the dlPFC ROI and with the Path a and ab effects
shown above, indicating an important role of prefrontal-PAG/
brainstemfunctionalpathwaysinplaceboeffectsonsocialpain.Two
smaller clusters in the left ventral part of the
middle frontal gyrus and the right postcen-
tral gyrus were not theoretically predicted
(Fig. 4B). Thus, the right dlPFC partially
mediates the effects of the placebo interven-
tion on PAG/brainstem responses, which in
turn predicts reduced negative affect specif-
ically in the Placebo group.
Heat pain
Behavioral results
Placebo treatment also reduced negative
affect ratings during heat pain, as indi-
cated by a Group � Time effect (t(38) �
1.92, p � 0.031, Cohen’s d � 0.61; Fig.
1C), yet this effect was less strong than in
the social pain condition and only driven by
a group differences in slopes. Although not
predicted, a similar placebo-related im-
provementwasobservedintheWarm(con-
trol) condition, Group � Time effect (t(38)
� 3.12, p � 0.002). These results were less
strong than those for social pain but are
consistent with those observed in many
other studies of pain. We therefore ex-
pected that brain findings may be statisti-
cally
weaker
but
might
yield
some
parallels with social pain nonetheless.
Expression of an a priori fMRI marker of
heat pain
In parallel to our analyses of social rejec-
tion, we tested whether the multivariate
marker trained to classify pain Preinter-
vention (Woo et al., 2014) was attenuated
during placebo. However, in contrast to
the results for rejection, we did not ob-
serve a significant difference in pattern ex-
pression
decrease
on
the

pain
contrast images between groups after the intervention (p �
0.652). Similarly, pattern expression of the Neurophysiological
Pain Signature (Wager et al., 2013) did not show a significantly
different decrease (p � 0.266).
Multilevel mediation analysis
We next investigated whether functional activity in the three key
ROIs mediated placebo effects on changes in somatic pain. As
with social pain, we found that activity in right dlPFC was in-
creased Postintervention compared with Preintervention, specif-
ically in the Placebo, but not in the Control group (placebo effect
on Path a; Fig. 5A, peak coordinates x � 52, y � 8, z � 34, Z �
10.85). In addition, activity in dlPFC was positively correlated
with improved affect (thus, less pain) in the Placebo group, but

 late cortex (Fig. 6B). Finally, mediation effects were found in
dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal areas, in addition to
subgenual cingulate, occipital cortex, and basal ganglia (Fig. 6C).
Comparison of social and heat pain placebo effects
Activity in the right dlPFC mediated placebo effects on both
physical and social pain, but there was very little direct overlap in
the activated clusters (Figs. 2, 5). On one hand, these might reflect
activation of the same underlying representation, albeit with spa-
tial noise; placebo effects have been shown to transfer from pain
to negative emotion (Zhang and Luo, 2009) and empathy (Ru
¨t-
gen et al., 2015), suggesting similarity. On the other hand, repre-
sentations in the dlPFC-mediating placebo effects in these two
modalities might be different; for example, placebo effects have
often found to be uncorrelated across domains (Liberman, 1964;
Koban et al., 2013) and even unrelated after minor changes in
placebo instructions (Whalley et al., 2008).
We therefore trained a SVM classifier to separate the mediation-
related (Path ab) patterns for social and physical pain in the
right dlPFC. The classifier (Fig. 7) was able to discriminate
whether individual participants’ mediation effect maps were
related to physical or social pain with 80% accuracy (�8.9%
SE, forced-choice test within subjects, p � 0.012) in the Pla-
cebo, but not the Control group (performance at chance). This
finding implies that patterns of placebo-
induced dlPFC activity in physical and
social pain are each conserved across in-
dividuals to some degree but are reliably
different from one another (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Placebo treatments affect outcomes across
multiple disorders and conditions (Bene-
detti,2008).Whereascommonbrainmech-
anisms in the regulation of pain and other
affective states have been hypothesized (Zu-
bieta et al., 2003; Ellingsen et al., 2013; Hsu
etal.,2013),thosehaveseldombeendirectly
compared (Ellingsen et al., 2013; Ru
¨tgen et
al., 2015). The present study investigated,
for the first time, placebo effects on social
rejection-related “pain” and their neural
underpinnings, and compared them with a
more established placebo effect, placebo an-
algesia, in the same subjects. We found that
a placebo nasal spray caused substantial re-
ductions in rejection-related negative affect
and modest reductions in physical pain.
Thisbehavioraleffectwasparalleledbyade-
crease in the response of a recently devel-
oped multivariate social rejection-specific
pattern (Woo et al., 2014).
Our comparisons of brain mecha-
nisms mediating placebo effects on social
and physical pain focused on established
prefrontal-brainstem pathways. Similar to
placebo effects on physical heat pain, the
right
dlPFC
and
vmPFC/OFC/rACC
showed placebo-induced increases in ac-
tivity during social pain. This is in line
with previous studies showing involve-
ment of these prefrontal regions in pla-
cebo effects on pain (Petrovic et al., 2002,
2010; Bingel et al., 2006; Eippert et al., 2009; Krummenacher et
al., 2010; Koban et al., 2012; Amanzio et al., 2013; Geuter et al.,
2013; Wager and Atlas, 2015) and treatment effects on Parkin-
son’s disease, depression, anxiety, and negative affective stimuli
(Mayberg et al., 2002; Petrovic et al., 2005; Benedetti, 2008;
Schmidt et al., 2014).
Our analysis framework represents a relatively novel approach
to investigating placebo effects. We used mediation analysis to
model neurophysiological pathways, going beyond effects on
single regions and relating connectivity to behavioral placebo
effects. Based on previous research and theoretical models of
placebo analgesia (Petrovic et al., 2002; Benedetti et al., 2011;
Bu
¨chel et al., 2014; Wager and Atlas, 2015; Koban et al., 2017), we
tested the hypothesis that functional interactions between pre-
frontal cortex (especially dlPFC and vmPFC/OFC/rACC) and the
PAG would mediate placebo effects on social pain (Fig. 4). This
extends previous work showing placebo-induced enhancement
of medial prefrontal-PAG connectivity (Bingel et al., 2006; Wager
et al., 2007; Eippert et al., 2009) by linking activity directly to
experimentally induced variations in emotional experience.
These pathways have previously been studied chiefly in relation
to physical pain (Vogt et al., 1993; Tracey, 2010; Bu
¨chel et al.,
2014; Wager and Atlas, 2015). Previous work manipulating

Koban et al. • Placebo Effects on Social Pain

 dlPFC has been shown to causally affect pain experience (Taylor
et al., 2013) and effects of placebo (Benedetti et al., 2006; Krum-
menacher et al., 2010). dlPFC and PAG are part of a larger opioi-
dergic“descendingpainmodulatorysystem”(Fields,2004;Gebhart,
2004), and recent work implicates the opioid system and PAG
also in other types of affect (Panksepp, 1998; Keay and Bandler,
2001; Zubieta et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2005; Linnman et al.,
2012; Buhle et al., 2013), including social pain and separation
(Herman and Panksepp, 1978; Way et al., 2009; Panksepp, 2011;
Hsu et al., 2013). Potentially due to statistical power issues,
vmPFC/OFC/rACC were not identified as direct mediators of
PAG effects but are likely to have an important role in regulating
PAG as well.
Furthermore, our analyses also allowed us to test two different
types of functional relationships between brain activity, placebo,
and affect that have not previously been examined. In a “fixed
affect” modal model, the relationship between brain activity and
emotional experience is constant. Placebo treatment increases
activity in prefrontal and brainstem areas, which in turn down-
regulate regions associated with negative affect. However, such a
“fixed affect” model is less compatible with the observation that
brain areas, such as the PAG, are involved in both positive and
negative affective states and their regulation. Alternatively, in a
“context-dependent affect” model, different contextual states,
such as placebo treatment, may shift the relationship between
brain activity and emotional experience. This is likely to occur if
emotions depend on the contents of thoughts encoded in brain
appraisal systems: Activity could support positive or negative out-
comes depending on the nature of the appraisal (Kim and Hamann,
2007; Wager et al., 2008; Urry et al., 2009; Buhle et al., 2014). This is
consistent with both appraisal (Scherer, 1999; Brosch and Sander,
2013) and constructionist models of emotion (Barrett, 2006;
Lindquist et al., 2012), and predicts nonlinear interactions be-
tween brain, placebo, and negative emotional intensity.
Strikingly, our results most strongly support the second view.
Under the control treatment, dlPFC, vmPFC/OFC/rACC, and
PAG activities were all associated with more negative affect. After
Placebo treatment, activity in each of these regions was associated
with reduced negative affect. Similar effects were found in other
cortical regions associated with affect and arousal, including in-
sula and dACC. These findings are consistent with the idea that
placebo treatment alters affective appraisals in these circuits, in-
ducing a shift in the relationship between brain activity and af-
fect. This does not preclude findings supporting the “fixed affect”
model; indeed, we do find placebo-induced increases in dlPFC
and reductions in the multivariate social pain pattern, but it
demonstrates how moving beyond fixed views of brain–affect
relationships is important for understanding placebo effects and
related phenomena.
Together, these findings provide part of the foundation for a
working model of placebo effects across affective states (Fig. 1A)
(Koban et al., 2017). Prefrontal regions maintain necessary con-
text information and attentional set (Benedetti et al., 2006;
Krummenacher et al., 2010; Koban et al., 2017), and /rACC /OFC
(with an associated striatal network) maintains information
about current expected value (Roy et al., 2014), which is com-
pared with PAG-mediated information about aversive outcomes
to shape avoidance over time (Roy et al., 2014). Placebo treat-
ments interface with this system via prefrontal regulation of PAG
and likely other forebrain and brainstem regions (Vogt et al.,
1993; Petrovic et al., 2002; Zubieta and Stohler, 2009; Bu
¨chel et
al., 2014; Wager and Atlas, 2015). And, whereas most previous
analyses have assumed that PAG representations do not change
with context, PAG may play a more dynamic role in appraisal,
increasing or reducing negative affect depending on context and
prefrontal input. The functions of these systems may not be lim-
ited to negative affect. For example, a recent study (Ellingsen et
al., 2013) compared placebo analgesia and placebo hyperhedonia
(increased pleasure), suggesting that enhanced PAG-vmPFC coupling
can downregulate or upregulate sensory processing, depending
on its emotional value, to meet expectations of benefit (Ellingsen
et al., 2013).
Implications for shared mechanisms of social and
physical pain
Our findings are in line with the idea that some broad regulatory
mechanisms, especially prefrontal-brainstem interactions, are
shared in placebo effects across different conditions. A recent
study has shown naloxone-reversible transfer effects from pla-
cebo effects on physical pain to those on empathy (Ru
¨tgen et al.,
2015), suggesting common opioidergic regulation of pain and
empathy. Whereas Ru
¨tgen et al. (2015) studied observation of
others in pain, here we focused on feelings of rejection, which
have a different neural basis (Krishnan et al., 2016). In addition,
that previous study did not investigate the regulatory network
(e.g., prefrontal systems) and brain connectivity mediating pla-
cebo effects. The present findings therefore complement those
earlier results by showing placebo-related activity and mediation
effects in dlPFC on rejection, a strong and unique emotional
experience relevant for well-being.
The present results also provide strong evidence for dissimi-
larity. Our multivariate analysis revealed that the activation
patterns in the dlPFC-mediating placebo effects are modality-
specific. An SVM classifier was able to reliably separate local spa-
tial patterns in mediation maps (Path a*b maps of Placebo ¡
Brain ¡ Affect) for social and physical pain. This classification
result was stable across individuals, demonstrating that the
placebo effect-mediating patterns in dlPFC are preserved

 across persons within each modality but are different across
modalities. This suggests that placebo-relevant representations
(e.g., of expectations) and top-down regulation of brain activity
by dlPFC during social and physical pain are distinct, despite
potentially parallel mechanisms at a broad spatial scale.
Limitations and future directions
Although we focused on specific prefrontal-PAG pathways, there
is evidence that a broader network of regions is important for
placebo effects. In our additional whole-brain analyses, insula,
ACC, vlPFC, parietal areas, and OFC increased during placebo or
were positively predictive of affect ratings. The importance of these
regions is also supported by previous placebo studies (Mayberg et
al., 2002; Petrovic et al., 2010; Geuter et al., 2013) and by studies
on cognitive emotion-regulation (especially vlPFC) (Wager et al.,
2008). Interestingly, most of these regions have direct connec-
tions to brainstem structures, such as the PAG (Benarroch, 2012),
and are also rich in opioid receptors (Baumga
¨rtner et al., 2006),
and may be related to social pain (Hsu et al., 2013). Future studies
could complement our focused approach by investigating the
role of these other regions in the regulation of social and physical
pain, as well as other affective states.
In addition, several other limitations should be mentioned.
First, to compare placebo effects on physical and social pain, both
modalities were tested; however, the results revealed a somewhat
less powerful placebo effect in the physical pain condition (in
both behavior and brain). Our comparisons here do not depend
on matching the strength of placebo responses, although future
studies could provide more quantitative comparisons if they are
able to do so. Second, we found a decrease in the response of the
rejection-specific brain pattern (Woo et al., 2014), indicating that
our placebo intervention altered the neurophysiological process-
ing of the social rejection condition. However, it has to be noted
that this pattern was not trained to track intensity differences in
social rejection, but to separate social rejection-related pain from
physical pain (Woo et al., 2014). Therefore, future studies might
develop and use intensity-sensitive patterns tracking the experience
of social rejection, in combination with hormonal and physiological
measures of emotional distress. Third, we do not provide direct ev-
idence on opioid involvement here, although other studies support
a role for opioids (Wager et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2008; Eippert et
al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2013; Pecin
˜a et al., 2015; Ru
¨tgen et al., 2015).
PET imaging or pharmacological manipulations could be used to
test specific hypothesis regarding the role of the opioidergic sys-
tem in the placebo-induced regulation of social rejection-related
pain.
