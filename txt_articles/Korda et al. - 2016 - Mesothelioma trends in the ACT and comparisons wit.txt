Abstract
Objectives: Inhalation of asbestos fibres is the predominant cause of 
malignant mesothelioma. Domestic exposure to asbestos is a major 
community concern in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) because of 
loose-fill asbestos home insulation. Little is known about how trends in 
mesothelioma rates in the ACT compare with those elsewhere. The objective 
of this study was to describe trends in mesothelioma rates in the ACT and 
compare them with those for the rest of Australia. 
Methods: We used de-identified data from the ACT Cancer Registry (1982–
2014), and the Western Australia (WA) Cancer Registry and the Australian 
Cancer Database (1982–2011). We calculated crude mesothelioma rates, by 
3-year periods, for the ACT and for the rest of Australia (excluding WA). We 
used Poisson regression to analyse mesothelioma trends from 1994 to 2011 
(complete reporting period) using an indirect standardisation approach to 
adjust for age and sex. 
Results: There were 140 mesothelioma cases reported to the ACT Cancer 
Registry between 1982 and 2014 – 81% male and 19% female. Between 1994 
and 2011, age- and sex-adjusted mesothelioma rates in the ACT increased 
over time, on average by 12% per 3-year period (relative risk [RR] 1.12; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99, 1.26). Compared with the rest of Australia 
(excluding WA), ACT rates were, on average, lower (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69, 
1.02), but they increased at a higher rate (RR 1.12 per 3-year period; 95% 
CI 0.99, 1.27). These results are strongly influenced by the higher rate of 
mesothelioma observed in the ACT in 2009–2011, when ACT rates became 
similar to those for the rest of Australia (excluding WA).
Conclusions: Although mesothelioma rates may have increased more in the 
ACT than the rest of Australia (excluding WA) during the past two decades, 
there is considerable uncertainty in the trends. More information is needed 
regarding the health risks associated with living in a house with loose-fill 
asbestos insulation. This is the subject of further studies within the ACT 
Asbestos Health Study.

Key points
• Age–sex standardised rates of 
mesothelioma in the Australian Capital 
Territory (ACT) have increased over time, 
and are around six-fold higher in males 
than females, consistent with national and 
international data
• Compared with the rest of Australia 
(excluding Western Australia), rates in 
the ACT were lower on average, but 
increased at a higher rate between 1994 
and 2011; most of the increase was in 
2009–11 
• The reasons for the trends are not known; 
loose-fill asbestos insulation is one of 
several possible explanations

Mesothelioma trends in the ACT, Australia
Introduction
Inhalation of asbestos fibres is the predominant cause of 
malignant mesothelioma and an important contributor to 
the risk of lung, laryngeal and ovarian cancer in exposed 
people.1 Asbestos exposure can also cause nonmalignant 
lung conditions such as asbestosis and pleural plaques.2 
The risk to health associated with asbestos exposure has 
been well documented in occupational settings3, whereas 
the health impact of asbestos in non-occupational 
settings is less clear.4 
Domestic exposure to asbestos is a major concern 
in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Between 1968 
and 1979, D. Jansen & Co. Pty Ltd and its successor 
firms – commonly and collectively referred to as ‘Mr 
Fluffy’ – insulated homes in the ACT and southern New 
South Wales (NSW) by blowing crushed (loose-fill), mainly 
amosite, asbestos into roof spaces.5 Between 1989 and 
1993, visual checks of some 65 000 houses in the ACT 
identified more than 1000 houses that contained this 
insulation. An extensive joint remediation program by 
the Australian and ACT governments removed loose-
fill asbestos from the roof spaces and made efforts to 
prevent any residual asbestos from spreading inside the 
houses.5 It was recognised that the original program did 
not remove all loose-fill asbestos insulation. The issue 
re-emerged as a prominent community concern when, 
in 2012, asbestos fibres were found in living spaces of 
a house that was missed in the removal program and, 
subsequently, in some remediated houses.5 In response 
to this concern, the ACT Government established the 
Asbestos Response Taskforce, which has recommended 
that houses containing loose-fill asbestos be demolished 
under a buyback scheme.6 As of July 2015, there were 
1022 affected properties registered with the Asbestos 
Response Taskforce.5 
Although asbestos-based home insulation has been 
recognised as a health concern for ACT residents living 
in homes containing this material and for tradespeople 
who may have worked in the homes5, scientific data 
that quantify the health risks in this context are lacking. 
Mesothelioma incidence is often used as a marker of 
asbestos exposure that is sufficient to cause asbestos-
related diseases, albeit a delayed marker because 
cases may not appear until 20–50 years after the initial 
asbestos exposure. Approximately 70–80% of pleural 
mesothelioma cases are associated with documented 
asbestos exposure.7–9 As of 2016, there have been no 
published epidemiological studies that compare trends in 
mesothelioma rates in the ACT with those elsewhere. 
This study, which is part of the ACT Asbestos Health 
Study, aimed to describe trends in mesothelioma rates 
in the ACT from 1982 to 2014, and compare these rates 
with those for the rest of Australia, excluding Western 
Australia (WA). We excluded WA from the comparison 
because rates in WA are substantially higher than 
elsewhere in Australia because of the large number of 
cases associated with asbestos mining and milling at 
Wittenoom.10
Methods
Data
ACT Health supplied de-identified ACT Cancer Registry 
data for cases registered between January 1982 and 
December 2014. This population-based registry holds 
data back to 1982, although cancer reporting has been 
mandatory in the ACT only since 1994. All public and 
private pathology laboratories, hospitals and nursing 
homes in the ACT are required to notify diagnoses of 
cancer to the Cancer Registry. 
The time from diagnosis of mesothelioma to 
registration is usually 3–5 months, sometimes longer; 
thus, some people who have been diagnosed with 
mesothelioma in the ACT before the end of 2014 may 
not have been registered at the time of data extraction 
for this report (30 April 2015). Data up to and including 
December 2011 are considered final. The main analysis 
included cases diagnosed between January 1994 and 
December 2011.
The registry records patients’ names, age, sex and 
address at the time of diagnosis, date of diagnosis, 
clinical and pathological details of the cancer, and date of 
death if relevant. Cancer type is coded to the International 
Classifications of Diseases for Oncology, third edition 
(ICD-O3); morphology (pathology) codes were used to 
identify mesothelioma cases for this study. 
Mesothelioma data for the rest of Australia 
(aggregated by age, sex and year) were sourced from 
the Australian Cancer Database.11 These aggregate data 
were available for January 1982 to December 2011, with 
approximately one-third of the total cases in 2010 and 
2011 estimated because the 2010 and 2011 incidence 
data for NSW and the ACT were not available at the time 
of data extraction.11 To exclude WA cases, we used WA 
mesothelioma data, aggregated by age, sex and year 
(1982–2011), from the WA Cancer Registry, Government 
of Western Australia, Department of Health. To calculate 
rates, we obtained population counts by age, sex and 
year from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.12,13 
Analysis
For both the ACT and the rest of Australia, we calculated 
the number of mesothelioma cases and the total person-
years of observation by sex, age group (based on age 
at diagnosis, categorised as <25, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 
55–64, 65–74, 75–84 and ≥85 years) and period (based 
on year of diagnosis, grouped into 3-year periods 
from 1982–84 to 2012–2014). We calculated the crude 
mesothelioma incidence rate per 100 000 person-years 
with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by period. 
We performed a series of Poisson regression analyses 
to model mesothelioma trends from January 1994 to 
December 2011, the period for which data are considered 
complete. We used an indirect standardisation approach 
to adjust for age and sex because of the small number

of cases. To calculate the expected cases in the ACT 
for each year, we used the age- and sex-specific rates 
for Australia (excluding WA and the ACT) in 2000–2002 
as the standard (Models 1 and 2). We used the age- 
and sex-specific rates for Australia (excluding WA and 
the ACT) in each specific period as the standard when 
comparing mesothelioma rates in the ACT with those 
for the rest of Australia (Models 3–5). In the analyses, 
we regressed observed cases on the factors of interest 
(sex, period) using a log link, with the log of expected 
cases as an offset. Period was modelled as a continuous 
and a categorical variable in separate models, with the 
Wald test used to assess the significance of period in the 
latter. All models were tested for goodness of fit using 
the Pearson chi-square test. Model coefficients were 
exponentiated, with estimates reported as relative risks 
(RRs) (point estimates with 95% CIs). All analyses were 
performed using Stata version 14 (StataCorp). 
The ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee 
(ETH.11.14.330,) and the Australian National University 
Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol no. 
2014/808) approved the project. 
Results
There were 140 mesothelioma cases reported to the ACT 
Cancer Registry between January 1982 and December 
2014; 81% were male (n = 113) and 19% were female 
(n = 27).  Of these, 73% (n = 102; males n = 88, 86%) 
were diagnosed between January 1994 and December 
2011, the main study period (Appendix 1, available from: 
hdl.handle.net/1885/107277). Of all registered cases, 
35% (n = 49) were diagnosed at age 65–74 years, 24% 
(n = 33) in those aged 55–64 years, and less than 5% 
(n = 6) in people younger than 45. Although recorded 
crude mesothelioma rates generally increased between 
1982 and 2011, rates in the ACT were generally lower 
than in the rest of Australia; however, they were similar 
in 2009–2011, being 2.95 (95% CI 2.02, 4.17) and 2.94 
(95% CI 2.80, 3.08) per 100 000 person-years in the ACT 
and the rest of Australia (excluding WA), respectively 
(Figure 1).
Between 1994 and 2011, age-adjusted mesothelioma 
rates in the ACT were 6.29 times (95% CI 3.58, 11.05) 
higher in males than females (Model 1, Table 1). Age- and 
sex-adjusted ACT rates increased over time, on average 
by 12% per 3-year period (Model 1: RR 1.12; 95% CI 
0.99, 1.26). When period was modelled as a categorical 
variable (Model 2), there was no consistent evidence that 
adjusted mesothelioma incidence increased with time 
between 1994 and 2008. The incidence in 2009–2011, 
however, was appreciably higher than in all preceding 
periods. If data for 2009–2011 are excluded from 
Model 1, the RR for period falls to 1.02 (95% CI 0.86, 
1.21), indicating a strong dependence of the RR of 1.12 
on the higher rate of mesothelioma observed in 2009–

2011. Although this might indicate a recent increase in 
mesothelioma rates in the ACT, substantial period-by-
period fluctuations in mesothelioma incidence in the ACT 
have been common since 1982 (Table 1 and Figure 1). 
Age- and sex-adjusted mesothelioma rates were 
lower, on average, in the ACT than in the rest of Australia 
(excluding WA) between 1994 and 2011 (Table 2, Model 
3: RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69, 1.02). Incidence increased at 
a 12% higher rate per 3-year period in the ACT than in 
Australia (Table 2, Model 4: RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.99, 1.27); 
however, if data from 2009–2011 are excluded from the 
analyses, ACT rates do not increase faster than the rest of 
Australia (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.84, 1.19).
Discussion
Rates of mesothelioma have increased over time in the 
ACT, but remain low. Taking into account demographic 
changes in the ACT, rates increased 12% more in the ACT 
than the rest of Australia (excluding WA) between 1994 
and 2011. However, there is considerable uncertainty 
around this estimate. Moreover, the greater increase in the 
ACT than in the rest of Australia appeared to be confined 
to 2009–2011, when ACT rates became similar to those 
in the rest of Australia. Although there was an apparent 
decrease in rates in the most recent period (2012–2014), 
it is not possible to reach a conclusion on this point 
because ACT cancer data are unlikely to be complete for 
this period. 
That the incidence of mesothelioma rose over 
time in the ACT, at least up to 2009–2011, is generally 
consistent with national and international trends.8,9,14,15 
Most countries have now banned asbestos products; in 
Australia, the manufacture of asbestos products ceased 
in 1987, and the sale, use and manufacture of asbestos 
products have been banned since 2003.10 The trends in 
mesothelioma incidence generally reflect the widespread 
use of asbestos since the 1940s and the long lag time 
(20–50 years) expected between exposure and the 
development of mesothelioma.14,16 Given this lag, it will be 
important to continue monitoring mesothelioma rates in 
the ACT. 
We were unable to model trends in males and females 
separately because of the small number of female 
cases. However, that overall rates of mesothelioma were 
substantially higher in men than women is consistent 
with national and international data.9–11 Although we 
cannot ascertain the reason for higher rates in men from 
this study, as elsewhere, it probably reflects the higher 
occupational exposure to asbestos among men, which is 
the predominant exposure type among those diagnosed 
with mesothelioma.10 
Beyond comparisons with other studies, we are 
unable to explain the trends in mesothelioma rates in 
the ACT from this study. Exposure to domestic loose-fill 
asbestos insulation is one possible explanation, along 
with occupational and other non-occupational exposures.

ascertainment of cases), as well as changes in the 
population structure (apart from age and sex), cannot be 
ruled out. 
There are several limitations that need to be borne in 
mind when interpreting the results of this study. Because 
of the small number of cases, there is considerable 
statistical uncertainty in the results. The modelling 
procedure used to test trends over time in the ACT relied 
on assumptions of proportional rate ratios17; although 
this may be a reasonable assumption to make, there was 
insufficient power to test it. There also may be some bias 
in ascertainment of cases – the ACT Cancer Registry 
does not include people with unconfirmed mesothelioma, 
nor cases in former ACT residents who lived interstate at 
the time of their diagnosis. The registry also may include 
people who only recently moved to the ACT. Similar 
issues also apply to the data for the rest of Australia. In 
addition, the aggregate data sourced from the Australian 
Cancer Database for the years 2010 and 2011 included 
both estimated and actual cases.  
Conclusion
Although it is possible that mesothelioma rates have 
increased more in the ACT than the rest of Australia 
(excluding WA), there is considerable associated 
uncertainty, and the apparent increase was largely the 
result of the increase in the 2009–2011 period. The 
reason for this apparent trend is not known, and exposure 
to domestic asbestos, including loose-fill asbestos 
insulation, is one of several possible explanations. 
Specific information is needed about the health risks 
associated with living in a house with loose-fill asbestos 
insulation, which is the subject of further studies within the 
ACT Asbestos Health Study.
