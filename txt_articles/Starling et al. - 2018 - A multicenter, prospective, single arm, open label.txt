Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sTMS) for the
preventive treatment of migraine.
Background: sTMS was originally developed for the acute treatment of migraine with aura. Open label experience has
suggested a preventive benefit. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sTMS for migraine
prevention.
Methods: The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine (ESPOUSE) Study was a multi-
center, prospective, open label, observational study. From December 2014 to March 2016, patients with migraine
(n ¼ 263) were consented to complete a 1-month baseline headache diary followed by 3 months of treatment. The
treatment protocol consisted of preventive (four pulses twice daily) and acute (three pulses repeated up to three times
for each attack) treatment. Patients reported daily headache status, medication use, and device use with a monthly
headache diary. The primary endpoint, mean reduction of headache days compared to baseline, was measured over the
28-day period during weeks 9 to 12. The primary endpoint was compared to a statistically-derived placebo estimate
(performance goal). Secondary endpoints included: 50% responder rate, acute headache medication consumption, HIT
-6,
and mean reduction in total headache days from baseline of any intensity.
Results: Of a total of 263 consented subjects, 229 completed a baseline diary, and 220 were found to be eligible based
on the number of headache days. The device was assigned to 217 subjects (Safety Data Set) and 132 were included in the
intention to treat Full Analysis Set. For the primary endpoint, there was a �2.75 � 0.40 mean reduction of headache days
from baseline (9.06 days) compared to the performance goal (�0.63 days) (p < 0.0001). The 50% responder rate of 46%
(95% CI 37%, 56%) was also significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the performance goal (20%). There was a reduction of
�2.93 (5.24) days of acute medication use, headache impact measured by HIT
-6, �3.1 (6.4) (p < 0.0001), and total
headache days of any intensity �3.16 days (5.21) compared to the performance goal (�0.63 days) (p < 0.0001). The most
common adverse events were lightheadedness (3.7%), tingling (3.2%), and tinnitus (3.2%). There were no serious adverse
events.
Conclusions: This open label study suggests that sTMS may be an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for
migraine prevention.

Introduction
Migraine is a highly prevalent neurologic disease affect-
ing over 38 million people in the United States (1). It is
the leading cause of neurological disability and the sev-
enth most disabling medical illness in the world (2).
Currently available acute and preventive medications
are often associated with suboptimal efficacy, tolerabil-
ity and adherence (3). In those with chronic migraine,
less than 20% of patients are able to adhere to prevent-
ive medications over a period of one year (3).
Transcranial magnetic stimulation employs the prin-
ciples of electromagnetic induction to deliver an elec-
trical current across resistive layers of the scalp, skull,
meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and into the superficial
layers of the cortex where it modulates the electrical
environment of neurons. Single pulse transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (sTMS) is considered a noninvasive,
safe,
and
well-tolerated
diagnostic
and
treatment
modality (4). In preclinical animal models, sTMS
stimulation raises the threshold for cortical spreading
depression (CSD) and modulates the activity of noci-
ceptive thalamic trigeminovascular neurons (5). sTMS
is FDA-approved and has been shown to be effective in
the acute treatment of migraine with aura (6).
It has been hypothesized that sTMS may be effective
for the acute treatment of migraine through CSD inhib-
ition, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) may be effective for the preventive treatment of
migraine through changes in cortical excitability (7,8,9).
However, the exact changes in cortical excitability in
rTMS seem to be highly dependent on stimulation
characteristics. For example, rTMS at high frequency
(20 Hz) has demonstrated an increase in cortical excit-
ability and rTMS at low frequency (1 Hz) has demon-
strated a decrease in cortical excitability (10,11). This
type of variability is reflected in the clinical studies
involving rTMS in the treatment of migraine. Studies
involving rTMS in the prevention of migraine have had
conflicting results, likely due to differences in the loca-
tion, frequency, and strength of stimulation. High fre-
quency tabletop clinic-based rTMS of the primary
motor cortex in a cohort of migraine patients demon-
strated a reduction of headache frequency (�15.6 days)
compared to placebo (�8.1 days) (12). Conversely, low
frequency rTMS was ineffective for the preventive
treatment of migraine (13). In addition to frequency,
location of stimulation is likely a confounding variable
in rTMS studies. Conforto and colleagues found that
stimulation
of
the
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
(DLPFC) using a tabletop clinic-based rTMS did not
decrease headache days in migraine (14). However,
other studies demonstrate efficacy with high frequency
rTMS of the DLPFC (15). There are ongoing studies
with rTMS for the prevention of migraine in efforts
to develop a more consistently effective treatment
protocol.
Interestingly,
patient
experience
in
the
United
Kingdom with sTMS suggested that sTMS may have
not only an acute, but also a preventive benefit for
migraine with and without aura (16). Both episodic
and chronic migraine patients using sTMS reported a
reduction in headache days and acute medication use
over time. The results of this study led to a CE Mark
for migraine prevention. Given that CSD inhibition is a
shared mechanism in many effective migraine prevent-
ive therapies (17), the ability to raise the threshold for
CSD and inhibit dural specific thalamic sensory neu-
rons may be a plausible underlying mechanism result-
ing in acute and preventive benefits in patients with
migraine with or without aura. The ESPOUSE Study
was a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, open label,
post-market observational study to evaluate sTMS for
the preventive treatment of migraine with or without
aura.
Methods
The eNeura ESPOUSE study was a prospective, non-
randomized, single arm study intended to support a
labeling extension to migraine prevention from its
FDA approved indication of acute pain relief in
migraine with aura (NCT02357381). Subjects were
recruited from December 2014 to March 2016 from
Starling et al.
1039
 headache subspecialty clinics. Using Pass 2008, the
sample size required to detect a difference between an
observed reduction of �1.8 days against a performance
goal of �0.63 required 92 completed patients in the
study. Assuming a lost-to-follow-up (LTF) rate of
approximately 15%, the enrolled sample size needed
to be109 subjects. The protocol and consent forms
were approved by site-specific institutional review
boards. All subjects provided signed informed consent
prior to enrollment.
In this study, a performance goal, a statistically
derived placebo response, was used as the comparator.
To calculate the estimated placebo response, the
inverse variance weighted estimate by the method of
Fleiss (18) was used, combining two placebo-controlled
clinical trials evaluating topiramate for the prevent-
ive treatment of episodic migraine (19,20) and one
device
study
(21)
in
similar
patient
populations:
Predominantly episodic migraine patients with consist-
ent age and sex distribution.
Subjects were recruited from selected headache cen-
ters and were provided use of the device for the dur-
ation of the study. After informed consent, subjects in
the ESPOUSE study completed a 28-day baseline paper
headache diary to establish the baseline headache days
and determine eligibility based on the inclusion and
exclusion criteria (Table 1). Subjects 18 to 65 years of
age, who had migraine with or without aura based on
the International Classification of Headache Disorders
(ICHD), 3rd edition, beta version (22), with 4–25 head-
ache
days
per
month
confirmed,
were
included.
A headache day was defined as a calendar day with
�4 hours of headache that at any point resulted in at
least moderate pain intensity. Subjects with a history of
epilepsy
or
seizures,
metal-containing
implants,
concurrent use of other neurostimulation or neuromo-
dulation devices within the past month, use of onabo-
tulinumtoxin A injections for chronic migraine within
the past 4 months, or extracranial nerve blocks within
the past 3 months, were excluded. Subjects were
allowed
to
continue
preventive
medications
and
instructed not to change dosage for the duration of
the study. Details regarding additional inclusion and
exclusion criteria can be found in Table 1.
Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria
underwent the 3-month (12 � 1 weeks) treatment proto-
col (Figure 1), consisting of both preventive and acute
treatment. To treat, the patient placed the portable
sTMS device on the occiput and pressed the button to
deliver the sTMS pulse. Time to deliver each pulse is
less than 1 minute. The device weighs 1.5 Kg with
dimensions
H:
81 mm;
W:
220 mm;
D:
134 mm.
A brief sound is heard as the pulse is delivered. At
treatment, a single magnetic field pulse is delivered of
nominally 0.9 T, measured 1 cm from the device sur-
face, with a rise time of 180 l sec and a total pulse
length of less than 1 ms.
The preventive daily treatment was four pulses twice
per day. The time needed to deliver four pulses is about
2 minutes. The acute treatment dose was three consecu-
tive pulses. If there was no relief after 15 minutes, the
dose could be repeated an additional two times.
Subjects were allowed to rescue with acute medication
30 minutes after the first three pulses were delivered.
Patients reported daily headache status, medication
use, and device use to the clinical centers with a
monthly paper headache diary.
Pre-specified endpoints were measured over weeks
9 to 12. The primary endpoint was the mean reduction
from baseline in headache days compared to the
Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.

 performance goal. Secondary endpoints included the
percentage of subjects achieving a �50% reduction in
headache days, reduction from baseline in days acute
headache medication was taken, the HIT-6 score, and
total headache days of any pain intensity.
Efficacy analysis was performed in the subjects who
completed the baseline assessment and had at least 1
month of data from a diary that indicated device use.
Subjects who did not complete the 3-month diary had
their 3-month headache days imputed 20 times by an
unbiased random selection of headache days from a
patient
who
had
completed
a
diary
(consistent
with the recommendation of the National Research
Council Committee on Missing Data (2010)), unless
their withdrawal from the study was due to an adverse
event or other confirmed reason that indicated lack of
effectiveness. These patients were assigned the worst
outcome from among similar patients because their
data were missing as a result of the device or its per-
formance. After confirmation that data from the study
sites was not heterogeneous, data from 20 imputed data
sets were combined into a single t-statistic inference by
the method of Rubin (23), and sensitivity analyses were
done to demonstrate the robustness of the unbiased
imputation. Within imputation testing was done by a
one-sample t-statistic. As is customary for imputation
analysis submitted to FDA, based on the 2010 recom-
mendations from the National Research Council on
Missing Data, secondary endpoint analyses were done
in the completed cases population without imputation
using a one-sample binomial test for percentages (per-
centage of patients with �50% reduction in headache
days from baseline) or a one-sample t-test for quanti-
tative observations (reduction in acute medication days,
HIT-6, and reduction to total headache days of any
pain intensity). Confirmatory analyses of secondary
endpoints were done in the per protocol population.
The alpha inflation due to multiple hypothesis tests
was controlled by the gatekeeper method between the
primary and secondary endpoints, and among the four
secondary
endpoints
by
the
modified
Bonferroni
method of Hochberg (24).
Results
Sample overview
There were 263 subjects consented for enrollment in the
study between December 2014 and March 2016. As
demonstrated in the Subject Accountability Flow
Chart (Figure 2), 229 subjects completed the baseline
headache diary, 217 subjects were assigned and received
a device and therefore included in the safety analysis
set. Of the 217 subjects, 179 subjects were confirmed to
have used the device at least once. Additionally, it was
confirmed after site monitoring that 47 of these 179
subjects did not meet the inclusion criteria minimum
of four headache days per month, which was defined
as a calendar day with � 4 hours of headache that at
any point resulted in at least moderate pain intensity,
and thus these 47 subjects were excluded from the Full
Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS was the intention-to-treat
population. There were 132 subjects in the FAS, of
whom 15 subjects withdrew for reasons not associated
with the primary endpoint. Of the 15 withdrawn sub-
jects, two subjects were missing for cause and were not
considered missing at random. These subjects were
assigned the worst outcome from the groups of subjects
with a similar baseline number of migraine headache
days. The remaining 13 subjects were assumed to be
missing at random and were assigned a 3-month out-
come based on a random selection with replacement
from subjects within the same imputation group
based on the baseline migraine headache days. There
were 117 subjects in the Completed Cases (CC) set who
met eligibility requirements and completed the 3-month
diary. The Per Protocol (PP) set was comprised of
the 95 patients that met eligibility and used the
device as directed for the entire 3-month treatment
period. Treatment adherence was confirmed by patient
diary.
Quantitative and qualitative baseline demographics
of the FAS, CC, and PP subjects are listed in
Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2.
There were 119/132 (90%) subjects with episodic
migraine and 13/132 (10%) with chronic migraine.

 There were 44/132 (33%) subjects with aura and 88/132
(67%) without aura. There were 9.06 (3.83) headache
days at baseline in the FAS. Although subjects were
allowed to continue preventive medications during the
study, only six (2.3%) patients reported usage of pre-
ventive medications at baseline and no patients added
preventive medications during the treatment period.
Preventive medications used included topiramate and
propranolol. Medication overuse was not analyzed in
this study.
Effectiveness
There were 9.06 (3.83) headache days at baseline in
the FAS. For the primary endpoint there was a
�2.75 � 0.40 (SE) days reduction compared to the
performance goal of �0.63 (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3).
Statistical significance persisted in sensitivity analyses
with a modified placebo estimate using only the topir-
amate clinical trials of �1.1 days.

Completed Cases population against a performance
goal responder rate of 20%. Of the 117 subjects in
the

group,
46%
(54/117)
had
a � 50%
reduction
in
headache
days
(Figure
4),
(95% CI 37–56%). Since the lower limit of the 95%
confidence interval is greater than 20%, the null
hypothesis is rejected and this secondary endpoint
was met.
The second secondary endpoint was the reduction
from baseline in the days of acute headache medication
use. The test was to determine if the amount of reduc-
tion is greater than zero. There was a �2.93 (5.24)
reduction in acute medication days (Table 2). The
results demonstrate that the mean change in days of
acute medication use was significantly greater than
zero. The null hypothesis was rejected, and this second-
ary endpoint was met.
The third secondary endpoint is the reduction from
baseline of HIT-6 impact questionnaire. This hypoth-
esis was tested in the Completed Cases cohort. The test
was to determine if the amount of reduction was greater
than zero. The results (Table 3) demonstrate that the
mean change in the HIT-6 is significantly greater than
zero, thus the null hypothesis is rejected and this sec-
ondary endpoint was met.
The fourth secondary endpoint was the difference
from baseline in total headache days of any pain inten-
sity (mild, moderate, or severe). This hypothesis was
tested in both Completed Cases and Per Protocol popu-
lations. The results (Table 4) demonstrate that the
mean change in total headache days of any pain inten-
sity lasting for 4 or more hours is significantly less than
the performance goal of �0.63, thus the null hypothesis
is rejected and this secondary endpoint was met.
Tolerability and safety
Adverse events were recorded from the Safety Data Set
of 217 subjects who received the device. Overall, there
were no serious adverse events reported. Nine patients
withdrew from the study due to adverse events. In total,
there were 62 adverse events. Sixteen were determined
by the investigator to be unrelated to the treatment or
device, 30 were thought to be possibly treatment related
and 12 were thought to be probably or definitely related
to the device. The most commonly reported adverse
events are listed in Table 5.

 Discussion
This open label study met its primary endpoint and pre-
specified, multiplicity-protected secondary endpoints,
suggesting that sTMS may be an effective preventive
treatment for migraine with or without aura. Overall,
46% of the subjects had a greater than 50% reduction
in the number of headache days, and there was a sig-
nificant reduction in disability and in the days of acute
medication use. In addition, the treatment was safe and
well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events and
only 4% (9/217) withdrew due to adverse events.
Based on epidemiological studies, episodic and
chronic
migraine
are
undertreated
(25,26).
Only
26.3% of patients with episodic migraine and 4.5% of
patients with chronic migraine have overcome the bar-
riers for minimally appropriate care (25,26). Even for
those who ultimately received preventive care, adher-
ence and compliance is poor (27–30). In the study by
Hepp et al., regardless of the class of preventive medi-
cation, there was a sharp decline or discontinuation of
the preventive treatment of choice within 30 days, with
50%
of
patients
stopping
the
medication
within
60 days. Persistence with treatment at 12 months
occurred in only 15% of patients (30). Studies in patient
preference in migraine have demonstrated a desire for a
treatment option that is simple, effective, rapid in onset
of action, and with minimal side effects (31,32). In
clinical practice, patients would like a variety of options
including vitamins, supplements, non-pharmacologic
and
non-oral
preventive
treatment
options
(32).
Treatment that is aligned with patient preference and
meets the needs of the vast majority of migraine
patients is still lacking, which is likely one of the
major reasons why adherence remains poor. Poor
adherence is most commonly a result of poor outcomes,
such as inefficacy or side effects (33,34). In addition, as
the complexity of a treatment regimen increases, adher-
ence declines (28). The simplicity, efficacy and tolerabil-
ity of sTMS, combined with its dual utility as both an
acute and preventive treatment option, may possibly
increase
adherence
and
compliance
and
improve
patient outcomes.
sTMS technology has been safely used for decades in
tens of thousands of subjects and patients for diagnosis,
monitoring, and treatment of a variety of neurologic
and psychiatric
disorders
without
serious
adverse
events (35). The results of this study support previous
studies in migraine in demonstrating good tolerability
and no serious device-related adverse events (6,16). In
addition, it is a non-oral, non-pharmacologic treatment
option that modulates targets and pathophysiological
events considered to be important in the pathophysi-
ology of migraine. The relatively few contraindications
to treatment with sTMS also render it an appealing
choice in patients with episodic and chronic migraine,
who often have a high number of medical and psychi-
atric comorbidities that may preclude the use of many
other therapies (36).
The UK post-market pilot study broadened the
population of those potentially responsive to sTMS to
include both migraine with and without aura, and
expanded the indication to include preventive treatment
of episodic and chronic migraine (16). In addition, simi-
lar to clinical practice, the treatment protocol was tai-
lored to the patient response. In subjects with frequent
or even daily headache, the treatment protocol that was
eventually recommended was daily pulses (16). The
mean baseline frequency of migraine days per month
was 15 at baseline, 11 at 6 weeks, and 8 at 12 weeks
(16). The positive results from the UK pilot study

 demonstrated that sTMS was possibly effective in both
migraine with and without aura. In addition, daily use
of sTMS treatments in subjects with frequent migraine
attacks demonstrated a reduction in mean monthly
migraine days. However, a limitation of the UK pilot
program was that it did not have a consistent treatment
protocol designed to investigate a preventive benefit.
The ESPOUSE Study was therefore designed to deter-
mine the preventive benefit of daily sTMS treatment
with a consistent daily protocol of four pulses twice a
day in both migraine with and without aura. The cur-
rent data demonstrate a preventive benefit of sTMS in
patients with episodic migraine and chronic migraine.
Additional analyses compared ESPOUSE results to
post market observational data collected in the UK
study for preventive treatment of chronic migraine
(16). Sixty-two chronic migraine patients were pre-
scribed and used sTMS preventatively for a minimum
of 3 months (16). The baseline headache days for these
patients was 24.9 (SD ¼ 5.61) (16). The average reduc-
tion in headache days was �8.58 days (SD ¼ 12.82)
with
95%
confidence
limits
of
(�11.
8
days,
�5.3 days) and the 50% responder rate was 47% with
95% confidence limits (33.98%, 59.88%) (16). Average
number of pulses used per daily treatment was 2.9
(SD ¼ 0.86) for an average of 29 days (SD ¼ 2.3) (16).
Acute medication days were reduced by a mean of
�7 days (SD ¼ 9.3) in the 41 patients who provided
information on acute medication use (16). The similar-
ity of the results between two independent studies pro-
vides support for the consistency of effect experienced
by patients treated with the sTMS device for reduction
in migraine days in different populations (UK versus
US) with different investigators.
In addition, recent basic science research has demon-
strated a plausible mechanism of action for sTMS for
the treatment of migraine (5). Migraine pathophysiology
involves first order neurons from the trigeminal nerve
that synapse on second order neurons in the trigemino-
cervical complex that synapse on third order neurons in
the ventroposteromedial (VPM) thalamus via the trige-
minothalamic tract (37). STMS not only inhibited CSD
in the rodent animal model, but also VPM thalamic
spontaneous neuronal activity and C-fiber-mediated
activity for greater than 90 minutes (5). The thalamus
may be a potential target for the acute and preventive
treatment of migraine, as the thalamus is an important
player in not only migraine attacks (38), but also in the
development of central sensitization (39,40).
It may be important to note that sTMS failed to
inhibit CSD in the gyrencephalic cat cortex (5), which
may be a result of the study design and stimulation
protocol as it was optimized for the rodent. However,
it must also be considered that human physiologic
responses may be more similar to the cat, and thus
this is still an area of further investigation, although
previous CSD studies have demonstrated that treat-
ment targets with known positive clinical outcomes in
humans have been less consistently effective in the cat
compared to the rodent (41).
Limitations and future research
Study limitations include the open-label post-marketing
study design, involving a relatively heterogeneous
migraine population, with the lack of a control or
sham device group. The gold standard for clinical
trials is a well-conducted randomized controlled trial
(RCT) with confirmed blinding throughout the study
period, minimal loss to follow-up and balance among
withdrawn patients. Migraine preventive RCTs can
have significant drop out rates that often differ between
treatment groups. In the test arm, patients may with-
draw due to adverse effects or lack of tolerance to the
drug, but in the placebo arm, patients may withdraw
due to lack of efficacy. In addition, the challenge of
developing a true sham comparator for device studies
is well known. Blinding is difficult for neuromodulation
studies because patients can detect the difference
between
active
and
placebo
(sham)
devices.
Developing a true placebo or sham device that emits
no energy but looks and feels like an active device is
often not possible. In the previous sTMS study of acute
treatment for migraine with aura, a true (no energy)
sham was developed and successful blinding was con-
firmed. However, because headache prevention studies
require
more
frequent
(daily)
treatment
over
an
extended period of time, creating a sham that would
support blinding throughout the study was a significant
limitation. Transcutaneous supraorbital neurostimula-
tion (tSNS) and noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation
(nVNS) studies have used lower energy sham devices
(21,42). It is unclear if blinding was sustained, because a
low energy comparator device feels and sounds much
weaker
than
the
active
device.
Additionally,
the
assumption that the low energy (sham) is delivering a
sub-therapeutic dose is not always supported. In one
nVNS study, the low energy sham device showed a
statistically significant reduction of headache days
when compared to the active device (42). This was the
inverse of the expected results. For the current study, a
differential loss to follow-up and difficulty in blinding
a preventive device study led to the decision to conduct
a single arm study.
In these cases, the FDA proposes the use of a
Performance Goal, a statistically derived estimate of
the placebo effect based on historical controls, but
only in extensively studied populations where the
expected
placebo
rates
are
well
characterized.
The historical controls chosen for the performance
Starling et al.
1045
 goal estimate in this study were three contemporary
randomized
placebo-controlled
trials
(RCTs)
with
documented efficacy in migraine prevention. These
were trials in episodic migraine, given that the majority
of the study subjects had episodic migraine. One of the
trials used was the only self-administered, daily admin-
istration, patient-administered device study in migraine
prevention that was available at the time of study
design (21). The other two trials utilized in the gener-
ation of a performance goal were contemporary studies
of topiramate – the most commonly used FDA-
approved migraine preventive treatment in the US.
Each of these studies used comparable patient popula-
tions and patient-administered treatments. Further,
Macedo et al. completed a meta-analysis of the placebo
response in 22 RCTs for all FDA-approved preventive
treatment options in migraine, demonstrating a 23%
placebo responder rate that is comparable to the statis-
tically-derived
comparator
in
this
study
of
20%
obtained from the three studies used to calculate the
performance goal in this study (Table 6) (43).
Other limitations include missing data. Randomized
controlled studies of daily use medication for migraine
prevention exhibit approximately 50% missing data in
both arms (19,20). In 2010, The National Research
Council (NRC) recommended imputation of missing
data combined with a sensitivity analysis to demon-
strate the robustness of the imputation. Following the
NRC recommendation, the FDA is now requesting the
more rigorous imputation analysis in place of last data
point carried forward. The ESPOUSE statistical ana-
lysis plan specified imputation analysis. In this study,
15/132 (11%) subjects included in the Full Analysis Set
did not complete the 3-month treatment diary. In this
intention to treat analysis, a multiple imputation tech-
nique and multiple sensitivity analyses were performed
to confirm the strength of the analyses. In the imput-
ation
sensitivity
analysis,
the
worst-case
analysis
assigned missing data with the worst observed response
in patients completing the study.
While an acute treatment paradigm was utilized,
acute treatment efficacy was not assessed in the present
study. Future studies specifically in migraine without
aura are needed to assess acute treatment response.
Although treatment adherence was documented by
the paper headache diary, in the future, more objective
device monitoring would be helpful to directly evaluate
treatment adherence. Additionally, studies that evalu-
ate clinical factors that predict treatment response to
sTMS would be useful. Medication overuse was not
analyzed in the present study. Although the majority
of subjects had episodic migraine, it was a heteroge-
neous patient population with episodic and chronic
migraine, migraine with and without aura. Due to the
relatively small size of the subject population in specific
subsets, subset analyses were not performed in this
study. The heterogeneity of the patient population in
a study of this size is a limitation. Finally, the study
sample consisted mainly of Caucasian women, which
may limit generalizability to other populations.
In conclusion, this study adds to the current
evidence for acute migraine treatment that sTMS is a
safe and possibly effective preventive treatment for
migraine.
Prior
studies
have
demonstrated
acute
treatment benefits in those who have migraine with
aura. Prior open label patient experience suggested a pre-
ventive benefit, and this current open label study provides
additional evidence for the preventive benefit in patients
with migraine when used daily. All studies support the
safety and tolerability of this treatment method. Based
on a combination of the ESPOUSE study, a previous
randomized controlled trial (6) and the UK program
results (16), the FDA has approved the sTMS device
for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. In
addition, sTMS has received the CE Mark for acute and
preventive treatment of migraine.
Clinical implications
. sTMS is possibly effective for the preventive treatment of migraine.
. This study adds to the current evidence that sTMS is a safe, well-tolerated treatment for migraine.
