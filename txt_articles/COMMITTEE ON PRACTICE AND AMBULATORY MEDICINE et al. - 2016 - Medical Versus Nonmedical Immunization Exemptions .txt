abstract
Routine childhood immunizations against infectious diseases are an integral 
part of our public health infrastructure. They provide direct protection to 
the immunized individual and indirect protection to children and adults 
unable to be immunized via the effect of community immunity. All 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have regulations requiring proof 
of immunization for child care and school attendance as a public health 
strategy to protect children in these settings and to secondarily serve as a 
mechanism to promote timely immunization of children by their caregivers. 
Although all states and the District of Columbia have mechanisms to exempt 
school attendees from specifi
 c immunization requirements for medical 
reasons, the majority also have a heterogeneous collection of regulations 
and laws that allow nonmedical exemptions from childhood immunizations 
otherwise required for child care and school attendance. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports regulations and laws requiring 
certifi
 cation of immunization to attend child care and school as a sound 
means of providing a safe environment for attendees and employees of 
these settings. The AAP also supports medically indicated exemptions 
to specifi
 c immunizations as determined for each individual child. The 
AAP views nonmedical exemptions to school-required immunizations 
as inappropriate for individual, public health, and ethical reasons and 
advocates for their elimination.
BACKGROUND
Principles of Childhood Immunization and Community Immunity
Childhood immunization is one of the greatest accomplishments of 
modern medicine. In the United States 2009 birth cohort, routine 
childhood immunization will prevent approximately 42 000 early deaths

and $68.8 billion in societal costs.

However, vaccines are not 100% 
effective in individuals receiving 
them. Certain infants, children, 
and adolescents cannot safely 
receive specific vaccines because 
of age or specific health conditions. 
These individuals benefit from the 
effectiveness of immunizations 
through a mechanism known as 
community immunity (also known 
as “herd” immunity). Community 
immunity occurs when nearly 
all individuals for whom vaccine 
is not contraindicated have 
been appropriately immunized, 
minimizing the risk of illness or 
spread of a vaccine-preventable 
infectious agent to those who 
do not have the direct benefit of 
immunization. Although there is 
variance for levels of immunization 
required to generate community 
immunity specific to each disease and 
vaccine, it is generally understood 
that population immunization rates 
of at least 90% are required, as 
reflected in the Healthy People 2020 
goals. 
2 Certain highly contagious 
diseases, such as pertussis and 
measles, require a population 
immunization rate of ≥95% to 
achieve community immunity.
School Immunization Requirements
Each of the 50 states and the 
District of Columbia and Puerto 
Rico have requirements for proof 
of immunization for attendees 
of child care centers and public 
schools, and nearly all have laws 
covering private schools as well. 
3 
Some states allow local school 
boards to set requirements for some 
vaccines, although the majority set 
requirements at the state level. These 
policies are designed to protect 
children attending child care and 
school from vaccine-preventable 
diseases by creating a learning 
environment with a very high rate 
of community immunity. In addition, 
vocational schools, colleges, and 
universities also have immunization 
requirements. As an additional 
public health benefit, immunization 
requirements serve as a strong 
incentive for parents and families to 
immunize their children according 
to the schedule recommended by 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Public 
health data show that vaccine 
requirements for child care and/
or school entry result in increased 
community immunization rates 
4 and 
decreased incidence of those vaccine-
preventable diseases.

Medical Immunization Exemptions
Although there are fairly 
consistent standards for required 
immunizations across the United 
States, every state, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico have 
allowances to exempt children from 
school-required immunization 
for medically indicated reasons. 
Examples of such include allergy 
to a vaccine component, previous 
significant adverse reaction to a 
vaccine or its components, or other 
underlying health condition such 
as an immunosuppressed organ 
transplant recipient. 
7 Almost half 
of states have laws that distinguish 
between temporary and permanent 
medical contraindications, 
 
3 with 
nearly another half of these states 
requiring annual or more frequent 
health care provider recertification 
for the medical exemptions. Because 
only a very small proportion of 
children have medical conditions 
prohibiting specific immunizations, 
medically indicated exemptions, 
when granted appropriately, typically 
do not compromise community 
immunity. It is this specific group of 
children that depends on community 
immunity for protection.
Nonmedical Immunization 
Exemptions
Although not required under 
current federal constitutional and 
statutory law, 
 
8 almost all states allow 
exemptions from school attendance 
immunization requirements on the 
basis of religious belief, and almost 
half of the states allow philosophical 
(also known as personal-belief) 
exemptions.
Although nearly ubiquitous, 
nonmedical exemption regulations 
are quite heterogeneous from state 
to state in terms of how they are 
granted, used, and maintained. 
3 Some 
states explicitly exclude philosophical 
and personal-belief exemptions and 
define these as not falling under the 
scope of religious exemptions. More 
than half of the states legally allow 
for exclusion of exempted students 
or can withdraw nonmedical 
exemptions during outbreaks, 
epidemics, or emergencies. More 
than one-quarter of the states 
require parental notarization or 
affidavit confirming either a religious 
or personal-belief justification in 
applying for a nonmedical school 
immunization exemption. A number 
of states have laws requiring parent/
guardian education by health 
departments or health care providers 
about the benefits of vaccines and 
the risks and consequences of not 
receiving recommended childhood 
immunizations.
PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECTS OF 
IMMUNIZATION EXEMPTIONS
Exemption Rates and Vaccine-
Preventable Disease Incidence
Legislation requiring immunization 
before school entry increases 
immunization rates and dramatically 
decreases the incidence of vaccine-
preventable diseases. 
9 Examples of 
these include immunization against 
measles and chickenpox. Likewise, 
higher rates of immunization 
exemptions in communities correlate 
with higher rates of vaccine-
preventable illnesses and disease 
outbreaks, such as pertussis and 
measles.

Although overall rates of many 
required immunizations have 
increased or remained steady over 
the past 10 years, recent studies 
show that unvaccinated children 
are often geographically clustered 
within communities 
14 and have 
corresponding higher rates of 
immunization exemption. This 
clustering reflects the fact that 
families with similar sociocultural 
beliefs often live near each other 
or attend the same schools which 
results in population clusters within 
larger communities with significantly 
lower immunization rates that are 
insufficient to sustain community 
immunity. This phenomenon results 
in disease outbreaks when a vaccine-
preventable illness is introduced into 
these communities.
Exemption Rates and Legal 
Requirements
States with less rigorous 
requirements for nonmedical 
exemptions and those that grant 
permanent medical exemptions 
have significantly higher vaccine 
exemption rates than those states 
with more rigorous requirements 
or those that only grant temporary 
exemptions. 
15
States that offer personal-belief 
exemptions have had steady 
increases in the number of 
exemptions over time. Religious 
exemptions have increased for states 
that do not offer personal-belief/
philosophical exemptions but have, 
through regulatory language, broadly 
defined religion for the purposes 
of obtaining vaccine exemption. 
The ease of requirements to obtain 
nonmedical exemptions, especially 
those of personal belief, can have 
a significant impact on the rate of 
exemptions and immunizations. 
16 
Oregon, which in 2014 began 
requiring parental completion of an 
educational module on the benefits of 
vaccines before allowing a certified 
exemption, saw a 17% decrease in 
the number of exemptions granted 
the following school year.
JUSTIFICATION FOR IMMUNIZATION 
REQUIREMENTS
Legal Justifi
 cation
Resistance and legal challenges to 
compulsory vaccination laws have 
existed since the early 19th century. 
In Jacobson versus Massachusetts, 
 
8 
the court found legislative vaccine 
mandates to be constitutional as a 
means of protecting public health 
and public safety. In Zucht versus 
King in 1922, the Supreme Court 
upheld a local ordinance requiring 
vaccination as a condition for school 
attendance. 
17 In the 1944 case 
Prince versus Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, the court ruled that 
the constitutional rights of religion 
or parenthood were not beyond 
limitation and that states had the 
authority to protect the welfare 
of children and the community. 
Although the specific case was with 
regard to child labor laws, the court 
extended its language to encompass 
both religious and personal activities 
such that, “The right to practice 
religion freely does not include 
liberty to expose the community or 
the child to communicable disease 
or the latter to ill health or death.” 
18 
Since these rulings, there have been 
numerous challenges to state and 
local immunization requirements 
(eg, Workman versus Mingo County 
Schools, Phillips versus City of New 
York). All of these challenges failed.
Ethical Considerations
Parents and the government both 
have a responsibility in maintaining 
the health of children. There is a 
societal interest in protecting the 
health of the individual child and 
society as a whole. Although society 
generally believes that parents 
or guardians are best situated to 
understand their child’s unique 
needs, including health care needs, 
and should participate in caring and 
thoughtful medical decision-making, 
this parental responsibility is not 
an absolute right. With this in mind, 
it is critical to design childhood 
immunization exemption policies 
so that they clearly serve the best 
interests of both the individual child 
and the community.
Parents are expected to consider 
the best interest of their child in 
medical decision-making, focusing 
on their child’s medical, emotional, 
and social needs, rather than their 
own social or emotional interests. 
In general, the state is empowered 
to overrule parental medical 
decision-making only when such 
decision-making or refusal of care 
places a child at significant risk 
of serious harm. Vaccination is 
unique within the realm of medical 
interventions because it not only 
provides a benefit to the patient 
who is vaccinated but also confers 
a significant public health benefit 
in terms of community immunity. 
Similarly, refusal of vaccination not 
only puts the individual child at risk 
but also increases societal risk by 
decreasing community immunity 
and adding to a population of 
unimmunized individuals within 
which vaccine-preventable disease 
may spread. Declining community 
immunity may be a significant risk 
for children and adults with medical 
contraindications to vaccination, who 
rely on community immunity for 
protection from vaccine-preventable 
diseases. Thus, nonmedical 
exemptions effectively disenfranchise 
people with medically indicated 
contraindications to vaccines from 
receiving equal protection under 
public health policy.
Several pediatric bioethicists have 
argued against the elimination of 
nonmedical exemptions by citing the 
ethical Principle of Least Restrictive 
Means for public health policy. 
19 
This principle recognizes that where 
multiple options exist to achieve 
public health goals, “that the full 
force of state authority and power 
3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
should be reserved for exceptional 
circumstances and that more coercive 
methods should be employed only 
when less coercive methods have 
failed.” 
20 However, this principle 
was developed to protect individuals 
from serious deprivations of personal 
liberty. The current immunization 
requirements that some seek to 
avoid with nonmedical exemptions 
are limited in scope to attendance 
in child care or school settings 
and are not requirements for the 
mandatory vaccination or quarantine 
of individuals who are unimmunized. 
Neither is there an undue burden of 
health risk to the individual in that 
immunization safety is scientifically 
well established. The public health 
value and benefit from requiring 
childhood immunizations for child 
care and school attendance versus 
allowing nonmedical exemptions are 
not equal alternatives. Nonmedical 
exemptions negatively affect 
community immunity and have 
indeed failed, as documented in the 
medical literature. 
12 In addition, 
the heterogeneous collections of 
regulations covering nonmedical 
exemptions, they actually present 
an ethical dilemma of unfair 
implementation and application to 
families. 
21
CONCLUSIONS
Immunization requirements for child 
care and school attendance are an 
effective means of protecting people 
from vaccine-preventable diseases, 
both by direct protection from the 
vaccine and indirect protection via 
community immunity. Immunization 
requirements also have a beneficial 
effect on timely immunization of 
children. Because rare medically 
recognized contraindications for 
specific individuals to receive 
specific vaccines exist, legitimate 
medical exemptions to immunization 
requirements are important to 
observe. However, nonmedical 
exemptions to immunization 
requirements are problematic 
because of medical, public health, 
and ethical reasons and create 
unnecessary risk to both individual 
people and communities.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The AAP supports laws and 
regulatory measures that require 
certification of immunization to 
attend child care and school as a 
sound means of providing a safe 
environment for attendees and 
employees of these settings.
2. The AAP supports medically 
indicated exemptions to specific 
immunizations as determined for 
each individual student.
3. The AAP recommends that all 
states and the District of Columbia 
use their public health authority to 
eliminate nonmedical exemptions 
from immunization requirements.
4. The AAP recommends that all 
child care centers, schools, and 
other covered entities comply 
with state laws and regulations 
requiring current and accurate 
documentation of appropriate 
immunization status and 
appropriate medical exemptions 
of attendees and students.
5. The AAP recommends that 
the appropriate public health 
authorities provide the 
community with information 
about immunization rates in child 
care centers, schools, and other 
covered entities and determine 
whether there are risks to 
community immunity on the basis 
of this information.
