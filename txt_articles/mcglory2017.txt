Abstract
Background: Physical inactivity impairs insulin sensitivity, which is exacerbated with aging. We examined the impact of 2 wk of acute 
inactivity and recovery on glycemic control, and integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis in older men and women.
Methods: Twenty-two overweight, prediabetic older adults (12 men, 10 women, 69 ± 4 y) undertook 7 d of habitual activity (baseline; BL), 
step reduction (SR; <1,000 steps.d−1 for 14 d), followed by 14 d of recovery (RC). An oral glucose tolerance test was used to assess glycemic 
control and deuterated water ingestion to measure integrated rates of muscle protein synthesis.
Results: Daily step count was reduced (all p < .05) from BL at SR (7362 ± 3294 to 991 ± 97) and returned to BL levels at RC (7117 ± 3819). 
Homeostasis model assessment–insulin resistance increased from BL to SR and Matsuda insulin sensitivity index decreased and did not return 
to BL in RC. Glucose and insulin area under the curve were elevated from BL to SR and did not recover in RC. Integrated muscle protein 
synthesis was reduced during SR and did not return to BL in RC.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that 2 wk of SR leads to lowered rates of muscle protein synthesis and a worsening of glycemic control 
that unlike younger adults is not recovered during return to normal activity in overweight, prediabetic elderly humans.

Sarcopenia begins around the fifth decade of life and is associated 
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1). 
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for the development of metabolic 
dysfunction leading to other negative clinical outcomes (2). Older 
adults are at greater risk of experiencing periods of acute physical 
inactivity arising from, for example, hospitalization and ensuing bed 
rest, which is likely to have important adverse consequences. It is 
thought that periodic muscle disuse in some cases (3), but not all 
(4), act in confluence with biological aging to confound metabolic 
processes in older individuals (5).
Complete muscle disuse (i.e. bed rest or limb immobilization) has 
deleterious effects on glycemic control in both younger (6,7) and 
older adults (5,8). Within days of the onset of muscle disuse, there 
are demonstrable reductions in skeletal muscle mass (9), strength

 (10), and a rapid onset of peripheral insulin resistance (6). Compared 
to younger persons, elderly individuals show an impaired recovery 
(RC) from muscle disuse (11), rending them at greater risk for disuse-
induced disease and disability (5). Physical inactivity, as a “milder” 
form of relative muscle disuse, may also be debilitating in older per-
sons. For instance, hospitalized elderly individuals take only ~650–
1,000 steps∙d−1 (12) as do older persons convalescing from illness or 
surgery (13). Studies have shown that such periods of acute inactiv-
ity result in the onset of insulin resistance in younger adults (14–17) 
but that younger persons recover with a return to daily ambulation 
(14). To our knowledge, only two studies (18,19) have examined 
how physical inactivity (daily step reduction [SR]) mimicking hos-
pitalization (12), affects muscle metabolic function in older adults. 
These studies showed that SR (<1,500 steps.d−1) resulted in losses of 
muscle mass (18,19), reduction in postprandial (18,19), and postab-
sorbtive (19) rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) (18), as well as 
declines in insulin sensitivity (18). While important, what these stud-
ies (18,19) did not determine was whether these adverse changes are 
restored with a return to habitual activity. This knowledge gap is of 
clinical importance given that early remobilization is de rigueur for 
older individuals convalescing from acute illness with the assump-
tion that it is restorative (20).
We examined the effect of 2 wk of SR (<1,000 steps.d−1) on indi-
ces of glycemic control and integrated rates of MPS in overweight, 
prediabetic older men and women. We also determined if any poten-
tial changes in these measures would recover following 2 wk of 
return to regular activity. We hypothesized that acute physical inac-
tivity would result in an impairment in glycemic control, integrated 
rates of MPS, muscle mass, and muscle strength (as well as protein/
gene expression), but that these changes would be recovered within 
2 wk of returning to regular activity.
Research Design and Methods
Participants
A Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials participant flowchart 
can be seen in Figure 1 and participants’ characteristics are pre-
sented in Table 1. Twenty-two, older adults (12 men, 10 women, 
aged 65–79 y) were recruited from the local Hamilton region and 
surrounding area. This sample size has previously been shown to 
induce decrements in glycemic control and MPS in response to phys-
ical inactivity in our laboratories (18,19). Prior to study inclusion, 
participants were screened to ensure that they met the following 
eligibility criteria: nondiabetic (fasting glucose <7.0 mM) (21), non-
smoking, and free from chronic disease. Participants were excluded 
if they regularly consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or 
medication for cholesterol management or if they were considered 
not to be moderately active (achieving <3,500 steps∙d−1).
Study Approval
The study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research 
Ethics Board (REB 14–609) and adhered to the ethical standards 
outlined by the Canadian tri-council policy statement regarding the 
use of human participants in research (22). All testing visits occurred 
within a 5-wk period within April 2014 and May 2016.
Experimental Outline
A schematic overview of the experimental design can be seen in 
Figure 2. The study consisted of three phases: Baseline (BL), SR, 
and RC. Participants reported to the laboratory following a ~10-h 
overnight fast on eight separate occasions. On the first two occa-
sions, participants performed familiarization trials of muscular 
strength. After these initial assessments, participants underwent 7 
d of BL monitored normal physical activity with an oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT) on the last day. On the next day, body com-
position, a skeletal muscle biopsy, and measurement of isomet-
ric maximal voluntary contraction. Participants then undertook 
a 14-d period of SR (<1,000 steps d−1), followed by a return to 
habitual step-count for the last 14 d of the study as RC. All the 
measures (OGTT, body composition, muscle biopsy, ISO-MVC) 
were repeated in sequential order on the last 2 d of the SR and 
RC phases.
Daily Step-Count, Dietary Intake, Daily Energy 
Expenditure
Participants’ daily step-count was monitored using a hip-placed 
pedometer unit (Piezo SC-StepX Health System, StepsCount, 
Deep River, Ontario, Canada) that was internally validated using 
a SenseWear armband accelerometer (BodyMedia, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania). The SenseWear armband accelerometer (BodyMedia) 
was also used to estimate daily energy expenditure. Our rationale 
for the <1,000 steps d−1 threshold in the present study was based 
on data (12,20) showing that elderly individuals hospitalized for an 
acute illness only take 650–1,000 steps d−1 regardless of their pre-
admittance step count. For the last 3 d of each phase (i.e. during test-
ing), participants were provided with all foods that consisted largely 
of flash-frozen and prepackaged foods (Heart to Home, Hamilton, 
Ontario, Canada) with a daily macronutrient distribution of 15%

 protein (1.0 g kg−1 body mass−1), 30% fat, and 55% carbohydrate 
of total energy. Daily energy requirements of each participant were 
calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation (23) with an activ-
ity factor based on the results of the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (24).
Body Composition
Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorpti-
ometry (DXA) body scanning (Lunar iDXA; GE Medical Systems, 
Madison, Wisconsin), calibrated using a three-compartment 
Universal Whole Body DXA Phantom (Orthometrix, Naples, 
Florida). Body scans were used to determine total body fat mass; 
total body fat- and bone-free mass (FFM); and FFM in the arm, leg, 
and abdominal regions.
Glucose Regulation
Regulation of blood glucose was assessed using an OGTT. 
Participants reported to the laboratory following a ~10-h overnight 
fast. Participants rested in a supine position on a bed, and an intra-
venous catheter was inserted into an antecubital vein. Immediately 
following the initial blood draw, participants ingested 75 g glucose 
in 296 mL (Trutol, Thermo-Scientific, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 
before additional blood samples were obtained at 15, 30, 45, 60, 
75, 90, and 120 min. Blood samples were subsequently centrifuged 
at 4,000g for 10 min at 4°C. Plasma was stored at −80°C until fur-
ther analysis.
Isotope Protocol
To increase deuterium (2H) enrichment in total body water to ~1%, 
participants consumed 150 mL of 70% D2O (Cambridge Isotope 
Laboratories, Tewksbury, Massachusetts) on the first day of the BL 
phase. To maintain the ~1% enrichment in total body water, partici-
pants consumed 50-mL doses every 7 d until the end of the study 
(Figure 2). Total body water 2H2O enrichments were used as a sur-
rogate for labeling of plasma alanine.
Blood Analysis
Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured as 
described previously (25). Commercially available enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays were used to determine concentrations of 
interleukin 6, glycated hemoglobin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(Thermo-Scientific), and C-reactive protein (Cayman Chemical, 
Ann Arbor, Michigan) by following the manufacturers’ instructions. 
Intra-assay coefficient of variation was <5% for all blood analysis.
Maximal Isometric Voluntary Contraction
Participants performed unilateral (nonbiopsied, dominant leg) iso-
metric contractions at a 60° angle to measure maximal knee exten-
sor torque using a dynamometer (Biodex System 3; Biodex Medical 
Systems, Shirley, New York) as previously described in detail (19).
For MPS, immunohistochemistry, microarray analysis, immunoblot-
ting, and calculations. See Supplementary methods.
Statistics
Except where indicated, all statistical analyses were performed using 
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, 
New York). Data were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk 
test and analyzed using two-way between–within mixed analysis of 
variance with sex and time as between and within factors. When no 
effect of sex was detected, groups were collapsed and are presented 
as a single data set analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with 
the effects across time. Tukey’s post hoc test was used to evaluate 
significant effects. In all analyses, p < .05 was considered statistically 
significant.

 BL levels in RC (Table 1). Daily energy expenditure exceeding three 
metabolic equivalents mirrored the changes in daily step count 
 
(p < .01, Table 1). Daily dietary intake prior to the 3-d control period 
was 53 ± 5% carbohydrate, 30 ± 6 fat, 17 + 3% protein [1.0 ± 0.3 g.
kg−1], 2,033 ± 402 kCal.
Glycemic Control
Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly ele-
vated from BL at SR (p < .01) and were not fully recovered from 
SR at RC (Figure 3A and B). Plasma glucose area under the curve 
was significantly elevated from BL at SR (p < .01) and was not fully 
recovered from SR at RC but was also not significantly different 
from BL (p < .05, Figure 3C). Insulin area under the curve increased 
from BL to SR (p < .05) and was still elevated in RC (p < .05, Figure 
3D). Matsuda insulin sensitivity index decreased (3.9 ± 0.7 to 2.9 
± 0.4, P < 0.05, Figure 3E) and Homeostatic Model Assessment of 
Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) increased (2.6 ± 0.4 to 3.8 ± 0.9, p 
< .05, Figure 3F) from BL to SR and neither returned to BL levels 
in RC. Fasted plasma glucose and insulin concentrations as well as 
glucose concentrations at 120 min post OGTT were also elevated 
from BL at SR and were not fully returned to BL concentrations in 
RC (Table 2).
Muscle Protein Synthesis
Integrated rates of MPS were reduced from BL at SR (BL 1.51 ± 0.07 
to SR 1.33 ± 0.05% d−1, p < .05) and were not restored at RC 
(1.34 ± 0.14% d−1, Figure 4A). Women had significantly higher rates 
of integrated MPS across all time points compared to men (p < .05). 
Isotopic enrichments of salivary 2H2O across the duration of the 
study are shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Circulating Inflammatory Markers
Concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers are shown in 
Table 2. Circulating plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 
6, and C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly increased 
from BL at SR (p < .01) and still elevated above BL in RC (p < .01).
Body Composition
Body mass index, total body fat percentage, and total lean mass 
remained unaltered throughout the duration of the protocol 
(Table 3). Leg lean mass declined −0.6 ± 2%, but this reduction was 
not significant (p = .13).
Muscle Fiber Cross-Sectional Area, Distribution, and 
Strength
There were no significant changes in either type1 fiber cross sectional 
area, type 2 fiber cross sectional area, or fiber type distribution (type 
1 vs. type 2) at any time point (Table 4). Strength (isometric maximal 
voluntary contraction) was not altered from BL at SR or RC (Table 4).
Gene and Mitochondrial Complex Protein 
Expression
A total of 36,245 Illumina HT12v4 microarray probes passed 
quality control filters, and 47 probes were significantly different 
in mRNA abundance between BL and SR (p < .05; Figure 5 and 
Supplementary Table 1). Three probes hybridized to loci withdrawn 
from the official genome annotation (excluded from Figure 5) and 
two additional pairs of probes hybridized to the same loci, result-
ing in differential expression detected for 41 protein-coding genes 
and 1 antisense RNA encoding gene. DAVID functional annota-
tion indicated that a large fraction of differentially expressed genes 
were involved in mitochondrial function but additionally detected 
enrichment of terms for oxoglutarate metabolism, oxidative phos-
phorylation, and other diseases (Supplementary Table 2). There 
was no change in the content of mitochondrial protein complexes 
(Supplementary Figure 2).
Discussion
We report that 2 wk of SR (daily steps <1,000 d−1) impaired glyce-
mic control and resulted in declines in integrated rates of MPS in 
overweight, prediabetic older adults. Importantly, these outcomes 
were not recovered upon returning, for 2 wk, to habitual levels 
of physical activity. The detrimental impact of an abrupt period 
of physical inactivity on glycemic control and integrated rates of 
MPS was associated with elevated concentrations of inflamma-
tory markers. Our study represents a relevant clinical observation 
showing that prediabetic older persons are susceptible to inactivity-
induced worsening of an insulin-resistant phenotype, as is observed 
in healthy older and younger persons (14–17). Uniquely, we show 
that the reversal of this phenotype, which occurs in younger adults 
(14), is impaired on return to normal activity in our population. 
Given that age per se is an independent risk for the development 
of T2DM (26), our findings are highly relevant and suggest that in 
prediabetic older adults to recover metabolic health and prevent 
further declines due to periods of inactivity proactive strategies such

 as prescribed activity/exercise and/or pharmaceutical intervention 
may be warranted.
Previous reports have shown that periods (≤2 wk) of SR induced 
a decline in insulin sensitivity and an increase in insulin resistance 
in both younger (14,16,17,27) and older adults (18). Our study 
provides an important extension to these findings showing a 35% 
decrease in Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and a 23% increase in 
HOMA-IR in response to SR that were not restored to preinterven-
tion levels with a return to habitual activity in overweight, prediabetic 
older adults. Our participants’ fasting plasma glucose concentrations 
were significantly increased from BL at SR and remained elevated at 
RC. Moreover, while glucose area under the curve during the OGTT 
returned to BL levels during RC, this reduction was accompanied by 
an elevation in insulin secretion. We posit that the increase in insulin 
secretion was a compensatory adaptation to mitigate hyperglycemia, 
which has been proposed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of 
T2DM (28). It is likely that insulin resistance at the level of skeletal 
muscle contributed in part to the insulin-resistant state as seen by the 
reduction in the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and in accordance 
with studies employing euglycemic clamps in response to SR (16,17). 
However, unlike work in younger adults (16,17), we identified an 
increase and failed RC in HOMA-IR consistent with impaired hep-
atic insulin sensitivity. We do acknowledge that the HOMA-IR may 
not be able to fully discriminate between central, hepatic, or periph-
eral insulin resistance. Future work utilizing a similar design to that 
of our study with glucose/insulin clamps may therefore add to our 
findings. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that in older adults a 
2-wk period of physical inactivity impairs glycemic control in both 
skeletal muscle and liver, potentially rendering older individuals at 
greater risk of developing T2DM and associated conditions.
Prediabetes increases the risk for T2DM and cardiovascular dis-
ease. The American Diabetes Association criteria for diagnosis of 
prediabetes are fasted glucose concentrations of 5.6–6.9 mM, gly-
cated hemoglobin of 5.7%–6.4%, and/or 2-h post OGTT glucose 
concentrations of 7.8–11 mM. Considering these guidelines, at BL, 
all our participants are classified as prediabetic. The prediabetic state 
of our participants may have increased the susceptibility toward 
the development of a full T2DM phenotype in response to reduced 
activity that may not have been observed in individuals who exhib-
ited otherwise normal glycemic control. However, it is important to 
acknowledge that SR resulted in only one participant breaching the 
classification for full T2DM (2-h OGTT glucose concentration of 
16 mM) suggesting that our data are representative of a preclincally 
relevant shift in dysglycemia as opposed to the development of overt 
T2DM. Nevertheless, as we detected a significant worsening of gly-
cemic control in response to SR and that up to 50% of adults over 
65 y in the United States and at least 22% of adults in Canada are 
classified as prediabetic, we argue that our data are highly relevant 
for a significant portion of the North American population.

 Skeletal muscle is the largest site of postprandial glucose disposal 
the size and quality of which is dictated by fed and fasted-state rates 
of MPS. A significant finding of the present study was that 2 wk 
of SR significantly lowered integrated rates of MPS and that these 
rates were not fully recovered to BL levels after return to habitual 
step count. Interestingly, despite a higher mean integrated rate of 
MPS at BL (1.56 ± 0.06% vs 1.47 ± 0.04% d−1) and relative mean 
decline from BL to SR (~14 vs 9%; Figure 4B) in women, there was 
no significant sex-based interaction in changes in MPS over time. 
The sex-specific differences in integrated rates of MPS align with 
a report using stable isotope amino acid infusions (29). This fac-
tor may be relevant considering that women had lower absolute 
lean mass compared to men meaning that multiple acute bouts of 
inactivity may render them at greater risk for disuse-induced mus-
cle atrophy over time (11). Concomitant with the reduction in rates 
of MPS in response to SR was accompanied by a small but signfi-
cant increase in circulating inflammatory markers in both men and 
women. The decline in MPS coupled with the emergence of a hyper-
glycemic inflamed state may well represent a pernicious confluence 
of factors that precipitates reductions in muscle mass and metabolic 
health over time (5,30).
Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the reduction in rates of MPS 
in response to SR did not lead to a detectable reduction in DXA-
measured FFM. One interpretation of this finding is that there may 
also have been an adaptive decline in rates of muscle proteolysis, but 
we lack any experimental evidence for this supposition. Moreover, 
a decline in protein breakdown seems unlikely since previous work 
has shown significant declines in both leg lean and total FFM with 
SR (<1,500 d−1 for 2 wk) (18,19) and that our microarray data failed

esting to note that the starting lean mass of our participants was 
significantly (p < .01) lower than that of the participants in the stud-
ies of Devries et al. (19). and Breen et al. (18). Thus, it is possible

 (18,19) rendered the participants more susceptible to losing lean 
tissue in response to SR compared to those of the present investi-
gation. Evidence for this assertion arises from data demonstrating 
that such a pattern of response has been observed when comparing 
younger and older participants undergoing muscle disuse (11). It is 
also possible that the decrease in integrated rates of MPS preceded 
any detectable changes in fiber cross-sectional area using histochemi-
cal approaches or FFM using DXA.
Our unbiased microarray analysis of muscle gene expression 
identified subtle but statistically significant, false-discovery rate 
adjusted, alterations in the expression of mitochondrial-related 
genes that did not fully return to BL levels at RC (Figure 5). 
Such data are of particular relevance as mitochondrial proteins 
have been proposed to play a key role in the development of 
muscle atrophy and insulin resistance (31) in a variety of experi-
mental settings. We also probed for changes in the content of 
mitochondrial protein complexes using immunoblotting but did 
not detect changes response to SR. Our findings contrast with 
a recent report in which significant declines in mitochondrial 
protein content were observed with 1 wk of bed rest in healthy 
young volunteers (6), although the model of complete disuse 
seen in bed rest is complete disuse versus that of the reduced 
steps to an extent that we propose explains the different find-
ings. A limitation of the present investigation is that we did not 
include a parallel young comparator group precluding our abil-
ity to make direct young versus old comparison. However, com-
plete RC of insulin sensitivity and lower glucose area under the 
curve has been reported in younger adults 16 d after SR (14). It 
is also possible that had we extended our RC period (e.g. >2wk), 
we may have observed broader or even full RC of our meas-
ured variables. Nevertheless, that our older subjects did not fully 
recover is, we believe, indicative of an age-related difference. 
We also acknowledge that no measurements of glucose-specific 
transporters (i.e. GLUT-4) were made in the present investiga-
tion, a factor that may be important in future research may wish 
to consider.
In conclusion, we show that 2 wk of acute physical inactivity, 
akin to that experienced during hospitalization or during conva-
lescence from illness, impairs both postprandial and postabsorp-
tive glycemic and induced the onset of a diabetic phenotype in 
overweight, prediabetic older adults. We also show that 2 wk of 
SR induced a decline in integrated rates of MPS. Critically, neither 
decrements in glycemic control nor rates of MPS were fully recov-
ered following 2 wk of return to normal ambulation. We propose 
that our data provide a case for the development and implementa-
tion of feasible strategies to mitigate declines in, and expedite RC 
of, metabolic function in older adults following acute periods of 
inactivity.
