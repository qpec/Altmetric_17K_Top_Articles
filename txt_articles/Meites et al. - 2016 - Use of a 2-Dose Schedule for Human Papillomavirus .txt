Introduction
Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is rec-
ommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated 
diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 
12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females 
and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recom-
mendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and 
updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously 
published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new 
recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and 
boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 
14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who 
initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and 
for immunocompromised persons.
Background
HPV infection causes cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers 
in women; penile cancers in men; and oropharyngeal and anal 
cancers as well as genital warts in both men and women (3). 
Three HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the United States. 
All are noninfectious. Quadrivalent and 9-valent HPV vac-
cines (4vHPV and 9vHPV, Gardasil and Gardasil 9, Merck 
and Co, Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) are licensed for 
use in females and males aged 9 through 26 years (1). Bivalent 
HPV vaccine (2vHPV, Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, 
Belgium) is licensed for use in females aged 9 through 25 years 
(1). As of late 2016, only 9vHPV is being distributed in the 
United States. The majority of all HPV-associated cancers are 
caused by HPV 16 or 18, types targeted by all three vaccines. 
In addition, 4vHPV targets HPV 6 and 11, types that cause 
genital warts. 9vHPV protects against these and five additional 
types: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. All three vaccines have been 
approved for administration in a 3-dose series at intervals of 
0, 1 or 2, and 6 months. In October 2016, after considering 
new clinical trial results (4), the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) also approved 9vHPV for use in a 2-dose series for 
girls and boys aged 9 through 14 years (5). In October 2016, 
ACIP recommended a 2-dose schedule for adolescents initiat-
ing HPV vaccination in this age range. This report provides 
recommendations for use of 2-dose and 3-dose schedules for 
HPV vaccination.
Methods
During November 2015–October 2016, the ACIP HPV 
Vaccines Work Group held monthly telephone conferences 
to 1) review and evaluate the quality of the evidence assessing 
immunogenicity, efficacy, and postlicensure effectiveness of a 
2-dose schedule; 2) consider benefits and harms of a 2-dose 
schedule; 3) weigh the variability in the values and preferences 
of patients and providers for a 2-dose schedule; and 4) examine 
health economic analyses. During teleconferences, summaries 
of findings were presented for Work Group discussion.
A systematic review was conducted to identify studies 
involving human subjects* that reported primary data on 
any important or critical health outcomes related to HPV 
vaccination† after 2 doses of 9vHPV, 4vHPV, or 2vHPV, 
administered at an interval of 0 and ≥6 months (±4 weeks) to

Recommendations for use of vaccines in children, adolescents 
and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as 
a federal advisory committee to provide expert external 
advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of 
vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-
preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United 
States. Recommendations for use of vaccines in children 
and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent 
possible with recommendations made by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of 
Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations 
for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with 
recommendations of AAFP
, ACOG, and the American 
College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations 
approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines 
on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality 
Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information about 
ACIP is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip.
* No primary data on special populations or medical conditions, including 
immunocompromising conditions, were available for 2-dose intervals and age 
ranges specified.
† No primary data on other important and critical outcomes, including genital warts, 
precancers, oropharyngeal cancer, anal cancer, cervical cancer, vaginal/vulvar cancer, 
and penile cancer, were available for 2-dose intervals and age ranges specified.

persons aged 9 through 14 years. The review focused on this 
age group given available 2-dose trial data for 9vHPV (4). 
Immunogenicity outcomes of interest were seroconversion, 
geometric mean titers (GMTs), or antibody avidity. Studies 
were excluded if they lacked a comparison group in which 
efficacy of 3 doses of HPV vaccine against clinical endpoints 
was demonstrated in clinical trials (e.g., females aged 15 
through 26 years).§ Evidence regarding a 3-dose schedule for 
HPV vaccine was reviewed previously (1,2).
Quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach. Detailed methods and GRADE tables 
can be found online (6). Other studies from the search and 
from the broader literature informed additional expert guid-
ance that extended beyond the research question addressed 
formally via GRADE analysis (7). Evidence was reviewed by 
the Work Group, summarized, and publicly presented at the 
February and June 2016 ACIP meetings. CDC vaccine rec-
ommendations are developed using the GRADE framework 
(8). Proposed recommendations were presented, and after a 
public comment period, were approved unanimously¶ by the 
voting ACIP members at the October 2016 ACIP meeting.
Summary of Key Findings
Immunogenicity. In the 9vHPV clinical trial that was the 
basis for FDA approval of a 2-dose series, participants were 
girls and boys aged 9 through 14 years, compared with young 
females aged 16 through 26 years (4). Among 1,377 partici-
pants, ≥97.9% seroconverted to all nine vaccine-preventable 
HPV types by 4 weeks after the last dose. For girls and boys 
who received 2 doses of 9vHPV 6 months apart (0, 6 month 
schedule) or 12 months apart (0, 12 month schedule), non-
inferiority criteria were met for seroconversion and GMTs. 
Furthermore, GMTs were significantly higher for all 9vHPV 
types among persons aged 9 through 14 years who received 2 
doses compared with females aged 16–26 years who received 
3 doses (0, 2, 6 month schedule). Six additional studies found 
similar results for 4vHPV and 2vHPV (6). Immunogenicity 
was found to be noninferior with 2 doses in persons aged 9 
through 14 years compared with 3 doses in a group in which 
clinical efficacy was demonstrated (GRADE evidence type 3).
Efficacy and effectiveness. Although efficacy and postlicen-
sure effectiveness studies were reviewed, none met the inclusion 
criteria detailed above. The prelicensure HPV vaccine efficacy 
trials were conducted with 3-dose series; post hoc analyses con-
ducted with data from some of these trials found high efficacy 
against infection among vaccinees who received 2 doses and 
those who received 3 doses (9,10). A large study comparing 
2 doses with 3 doses also suggested similar efficacy against 
infection (11). Postlicensure effectiveness studies have found 
lower effectiveness against various HPV-associated outcomes 
among vaccinees who received 2 doses compared with those 
who received 3 doses, but methodologic challenges with these 
studies limit interpretation of the findings.**
Duration of protection. Through 10 years of follow-up 
from clinical trials, no evidence of waning protection after 
a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine has been found (1). Because 
antibody kinetics are similar with 2-dose and 3-dose series, 
duration of protection is also expected to be long-lasting after 
a 2-dose series (12,13).
Health impact and cost-effectiveness modeling. 
Population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 2-dose 
and 3-dose schedules of 9vHPV in the United States have been 
modeled (14). Assuming both efficacy and duration of protec-
tion are similar with either schedule, a 2-dose series would be 
cost-saving and have similar population impact to a 3-dose 
series. Even if duration of protection is 20 years for a 2-dose 
series and lifelong for a 3-dose series, additional benefits of 
a 3-dose series would be relatively small, and a 2-dose series 
would be more cost-effective (14).
Rationale
HPV vaccines are highly effective and safe, and a powerful pre-
vention tool for reducing HPV infections and HPV-associated 
cancers (1,2). Based on the available immunogenicity evidence, 
a 2-dose schedule (0, 6–12 months) will have efficacy equivalent 
to a 3-dose schedule (0, 1–2, 6 months) if the HPV vaccination 
series is initiated before the 15th birthday (GRADE evidence 
type 3) (6). ACIP recommends a 2-dose schedule for HPV vac-
cination of girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at 
ages 9 through 14 years (Category A recommendation).
Recommendations
Routine and catch-up age groups. ACIP recommends 
routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. Vaccination 
can be given starting at age 9 years. ACIP also recommends 
vaccination for females through age 26 years and for males 
through age 21 years who were not adequately vaccinated 
previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. 
(See also: Special populations, Medical conditions)
Dosing schedules. For persons initiating vaccination before 
their 15th birthday, the recommended immunization sched-
ule is 2 doses of HPV vaccine. The second dose should be 
§ Studies were excluded when 2-dose interval was not ≥5 months.
¶ Twelve votes to none, with one recusal.
 
** In studies conducted in the setting of a 3-dose HPV vaccine recommendation 
or policy, many 2-dose recipients received HPV vaccine doses at a 1–2 month 
interval; in addition, 2-dose recipients differed from 3-dose recipients in ways 
that suggested differences in HPV exposure.

administered 6–12 months after the first dose (0, 6–12 month 
schedule)†† (Table).
For persons initiating vaccination on or after their 15th 
birthday, the recommended immunization schedule is 3 doses 
of HPV vaccine. The second dose should be administered 
1–2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be 
administered 6 months after the first dose (0, 1–2, 6 month 
schedule)§§ (Table).
Persons vaccinated previously. Persons who initiated vac-
cination with 9vHPV, 4vHPV, or 2vHPV before their 15th 
birthday, and received 2 doses of any HPV vaccine at the 
recommended dosing schedule (0, 6–12 months), or 3 doses 
of any HPV vaccine at the recommended dosing schedule (0, 
1–2, 6 months), are considered adequately vaccinated.
Persons who initiated vaccination with 9vHPV, 4vHPV, or 
2vHPV on or after their 15th birthday, and received 3 doses 
of any HPV vaccine at the recommended dosing schedule, are 
considered adequately vaccinated.
9vHPV may be used to continue or complete a vaccination 
series started with 4vHPV or 2vHPV.
For persons who have been adequately vaccinated with 
2vHPV or 4vHPV, there is no ACIP recommendation regard-
ing additional vaccination with 9vHPV.
Interrupted schedules. If the vaccination schedule is inter-
rupted, the series does not need to be restarted. The number 
of recommended doses is based on age at administration of 
the first dose.
Special populations. For children with a history of sexual 
abuse or assault, ACIP recommends routine HPV vaccination 
beginning at age 9 years.
For men who have sex with men,¶¶ ACIP recommends 
routine HPV vaccination as for all males, and vaccination 
through age 26 years for those who were not adequately vac-
cinated previously.
For transgender persons, ACIP recommends routine 
HPV vaccination as for all adolescents, and vaccination 
through age 26 years for those who were not adequately 
vaccinated previously.
Medical conditions. ACIP recommends vaccination with 3 
doses of HPV vaccine (0, 1–2, 6 months) for females and males 
aged 9 through 26 years with primary or secondary immuno-
compromising conditions that might reduce cell-mediated 
or humoral immunity,*** such as B lymphocyte antibody 
deficiencies, T lymphocyte complete or partial defects, HIV 
infection, malignant neoplasms, transplantation, autoimmune 
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy, because immune 
response to vaccination might be attenuated (Table) (7).
Contraindications and precautions. Contraindications 
and precautions, including those related to pregnancy, are 
unchanged from previous recommendations (1,2). Adverse 
events occurring after administration of any vaccine should 
be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, 
or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by 
telephone (1-800-822-7967) or online (https://vaers.hhs.gov).

 § In a 2-dose schedule of HPV vaccine, the minimum interval between the first and second doses is 5 months.
 ¶ For persons who were not adequately vaccinated previously, ACIP recommends vaccination for females through age 26 years and for males through age 
21 years; males ages 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. Vaccination is recommended for some persons aged 22 through 26 years; see Medical conditions 
and Special populations.
 ** In a 3-dose schedule of HPV vaccine, the minimum intervals are 4 weeks between the first and second doses, 12 weeks between the second and third doses, and 
5 months between the first and third doses.
 
†† In a 2-dose schedule of HPV vaccine, the minimum interval between the first 
and second doses is 5 months. If the second dose is administered after a shorter 
interval, a third dose should be administered a minimum of 12 weeks after 
the second dose and a minimum of 5 months after the first dose.
 
§§ In a 3-dose schedule of HPV vaccine, the minimum intervals are 4 weeks 
between the first and second doses, 12 weeks between the second and third 
doses, and 5 months between the first and third doses. If a vaccine dose is 
administered after a shorter interval, it should be readministered after another 
minimum interval has elapsed since the most recent dose.
 ¶¶ Including men who identify as gay or bisexual, or who intend to have sex 
with men.
 *** The recommendation for a 3-dose schedule of HPV vaccine does not apply 
to children aged <15 years with asplenia, asthma, chronic granulomatous 
disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, 
central nervous system anatomic barrier defects (e.g., cochlear implant), 
complement deficiency, diabetes, heart disease, or sickle cell disease.
