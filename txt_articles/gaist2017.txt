IMPORTANCE Incidence of subdural hematoma has been reported to be increasing. To what
extent this is related to increasing use of antithrombotic drugs is unknown.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the association between use of antithrombotic drugs and subdural
hematoma risk and determine trends in subdural hematoma incidence and antithrombotic
drug use in the general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case-control study of 10 010 patients aged 20 to 89
years with a first-ever subdural hematoma principal discharge diagnosis from 2000 to 2015
matched by age, sex, and calendar year to 400 380 individuals from the general population
(controls). Subdural hematoma incidence and antithrombotic drug use was identified using
population-based regional data (population: 484 346) and national data (population:
5.2 million) from Denmark. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate
odds ratios (ORs) that were adjusted for comorbidity, education level, and income level.
EXPOSURES Use of low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), a direct oral
anticoagulant, and combined antithrombotic drug treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Association of subdural hematoma with antithrombotic
drug use, subdural hematoma incidence rate, and annual prevalence of treatment with
antithrombotic drugs.
RESULTS Among 10 010 patients with subdural hematoma (mean age, 69.2 years; 3462
women [34.6%]), 47.3% were taking antithrombotic medications. Current use of low-dose
aspirin (cases: 26.7%, controls: 22.4%; adjusted OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.15-1.33]), clopidogrel
(cases: 5.0%, controls: 2.2%; adjusted OR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.57-2.24]), a direct oral
anticoagulant (cases: 1.0%, controls: 0.6%; adjusted OR, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.31-2.28]), and a VKA
(cases: 14.3%, controls: 4.9%; adjusted OR, 3.69 [95% CI, 3.38-4.03]) were associated with
higher risk of subdural hematoma. The risk of subdural hematoma was highest when a VKA
was used concurrently with an antiplatelet drug (low-dose aspirin and a VKA: 3.6% of cases
and 1.1% of controls; adjusted OR, 4.00 [95% CI, 3.40-4.70]; clopidogrel and a VKA: 0.3%
of cases and 0.04% of controls; adjusted OR, 7.93 [95% CI, 4.49-14.02]). The prevalence of
antithrombotic drug use increased from 31.0 per 1000 individuals from the general
population in 2000 to 76.9 per 1000 individuals in 2015 (P < .001 for trend). The overall
subdural hematoma incidence rate increased from 10.9 per 100 000 person-years in 2000
to 19.0 per 100 000 person-years in 2015 (P < .001 for trend). The largest increase was
among older patients (>75 years; n = 4441) who experienced an increase from 55.1 per
100 000 person-years to 99.7 per 100 000 person-years (P < .001 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Denmark, antithrombotic drug use was associated with
higher risk of subdural hematoma; and the highest odds of subdural hematoma was
associated with combined use of a VKA and an antiplatelet drug. The increased incidence of
subdural hematoma from 2000 to 2015 appears to be associated with the increased use
of antithrombotic drugs, particularly use of a VKA among older patients.

S
ubdural hematoma, which is an intracranial hemor-
rhagelocalizedundertheduralmembraneandabovethe
brain surface, can be classified into 2 categories: acute
subdural hematoma and subacute or chronic hematoma. Both
subdural hematoma types are typically traumatic. Acute sub-
dural hematoma is more frequently associated with severe
trauma and usually becomes clinically apparent within 72
hours,whereassubacuteorchronicsubduralhematomaismost
often seen weeks to months after relatively modest trauma
(eg, low-impact falls among elderly individuals).1
Since the 1980s, studies with data on subacute or chronic
subdural hematoma have reported an increase in the inci-
dence of this disorder in both Europe and the United States.2,3
Subacute or chronic subdural hematoma incidence is pre-
dicted to further increase due to the aging population.2 Use of
antithrombotic drugs has been associated with increased sub-
acute or chronic subdural hematoma risk. In meta-analyses of
controlled trials, use of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was as-
sociated with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 3.0 for subacute or
chronic subdural hematoma compared with antiplatelet
therapy, and use of low-dose aspirin compared with no anti-
thrombotic treatment was associated with a pooled OR of 1.6,
which was not statistically significant.4,5
However, epidemiological data on the association of an-
tithrombotic drug use with subdural hematoma risk are lim-
ited, particularly with regard to antiplatelet drug use6 and use
of a direct oral anticoagulant, and in relation to more aggres-
sive regimens of multiple antithrombotic drugs, which are in-
creasingly common.7 The purpose of this study was to pro-
vide updated estimates of subdural hematoma risk associated
with antithrombotic drug use and to explore recent trends in
antithrombotic drug use in relation to subdural hematoma oc-
currence.
Methods
Case-control analyses and descriptive analyses were per-
formedonDanishnationalandregionalpopulation-baseddata.
The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency
and the Statens Serum Institut. According to Danish law, ap-
proval from an ethics board and informed consent are not re-
quired for register studies.8
Cases
Cases were patients aged 20 to 89 years with a first-ever prin-
cipal discharge code of subdural hematoma from 2000 to 2015
according to Danish National Patient Register9 data (dis-
charge, outpatient, procedure, and medication codes appear
in eTable 1 in the Supplement). The date of admission was used
as the index date. Cases with any history of subdural hema-
toma recorded before 2000 and individuals with residency in
Denmark for less than 10 consecutive years were excluded.
Controls
Using risk set sampling10 and applying the same eligibility and
exclusioncriteriaasforcases,40controlsfromtheDanishgen-
eralpopulationweresampledtoeachcaseviauseoftheDanish
CivilRegistrationSystem.11Controlswerematchedbybirthyear
and sex to their index case and were assigned an index date
identical to the event date of their corresponding case.
Assessment of Antithrombotic Drug Exposure, Potential
Confounders, and Short-term Mortality
Data on filled prescriptions were retrieved from the Danish Na-
tional Prescription Registry.12 For each prescription, the date
the drug was dispensed and a full account of the dispensed
product(includingtheAnatomicalTherapeuticChemicalcode)
were recorded.13 The indication and prescribed dose are not
available in the prescription registry.
Based on prescriptions dispensed from 1995 up to 1 day
prior to the index date, cases and controls were classified as
ever users (≥1 prescription) or never users (no prescription) of
low-dose aspirin (only available in doses of ≤150 mg in
Denmark), clopidogrel, other adenosine diphosphate inhibi-
tors (prasugrel and ticagrelor), or dipyridamole. The same
principles were applied for an oral anticoagulant drug classi-
fied as a VKA (warfarin or phenprocoumon) and a direct oral
anticoagulant (dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, or apixa-
ban). The assessment of drug exposure is further detailed in
the eMethods in the Supplement.
National register data (population: 5.2 million) were used
toclassifyindividualswithregardtoanumberofdisordersthat
were potential confounders, which are listed in the statistical
analyses section (codes appear in eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). As proxies for socioeconomic status, individuals were
classified by highest education level attained (years of educa-
tion: 7-10 years, 11-12 years, ≥13 years, or missing) and by in-
come level (low, middle, and high according to tertiles of in-
dividual incomes in the control group).8,14 Register data from
the continuously updated Danish Civil Registration System11
were used to ascertain 30-day fatality rates for cases.
Regional Data
Information on certain factors of potential interest (eg, subdu-
ral hematoma type, trauma severity) is not routinely collected
inDanishregisters.Therefore,informationwasgatheredonthe
subset of patients with subdural hematoma who were from
the Funen area (population: 484 346 in 2009), which has 1 of
the 5 facilities with a neurosurgery department in Denmark.12
Key Points
Question Are changes in subdural hematoma incidence related to
antithrombotic drug use?
Findings In this observational study with 10 010 subdural
hematoma cases and 400 380 controls, subdural hematoma risk
was significantly associated with antithrombotic drug use, in
particular use of a vitamin K antagonist (adjusted odds ratio, 3.69).
An observed increase in antithrombotic drug use was related to
an increase in subdural hematoma incidence from 10.9 per 100 000
person-years in 2000 to 19.0 per 100 000 person-years in 2015.
Meaning The increased incidence of subdural hematoma was
associated with increased use of antithrombotic drugs, especially
use of a vitamin K antagonist.

Patients with verified subdural hematoma (cases) were
classified as having acute subdural hematoma or subacute or
chronic subdural hematoma based on brain scan results ana-
lyzedby2neurosurgeons,whoalsoevaluatedthepresenceand
severity of the head trauma according to medical record in-
formation (eMethods in the Supplement).15 Use of an anti-
thrombotic drug by the validated cases and their general popu-
lation controls was assessed for the period from 2000 to 2012
when data were available.
Statistical Analyses
Conditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted
ORs and 95% CIs for subdural hematoma associated with use
of low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, a VKA, and a direct oral an-
ticoagulant. Because use of other adenosine diphosphate re-
ceptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) was limited dur-
ing the study period, analyses restricted to this drug class were
not performed.
The analyses were adjusted for (1) the presence of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (as a marker of smoking),
disorders indicative of high intake of alcohol, chronic he-
patic diseases, chronic renal failure, diabetes, myocardial
infarction, angina, unstable angina, peripheral artery disease,
coagulopathy, hypertension, epilepsy, dementia, or stroke;
(2) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, statins, hypnotics and seda-
tives (including benzodiazepines), postmenopausal hormone
replacement therapy, or oral corticosteroids; and (3) highest
education level attained and income level as proxies for
socioeconomic status.
Analyses focusing on any use or use of a single antiplate-
let drug were further adjusted for current use of any oral an-
ticoagulant. Similarly, analyses for use of a single anticoagu-
lant were adjusted for current use of any antiplatelet drug.
Furthermore,becauselow-doseaspirinisoftenprescribedwith
clopidogrel or dipyridamole, analyses for these drugs were ad-
justed for current use of low-dose aspirin and vice versa.
We tested whether the ORs for the different antithrombotic
regimens differed by using a likelihood ratio test, which com-
pared 2 models: one model in which the main exposure vari-
ablewasuseofanyantithromboticregimenandanothermodel
in which the individual antithrombotic regimens were speci-
fied. Differences in strength of association between sub-
groups or between different outcomes were evaluated using
the 2-sample Wald test. A 2-sided limit of .05 was used as the
significance threshold.
Using the regional data, the association of antithrom-
botic drug use with subdural hematoma stratified by type of
subdural hematoma and head trauma history was assessed.
Using cases only, the association between use of a VKA or use
of low-dose aspirin and imaging characteristics (subdural he-
matoma width, midline structure deviation), surgical treat-
ment, and 30-day mortality, stratified by subdural hema-
toma type was studied. Age and sex were adjusted for using
linear regression (continuous outcomes) or logistic regres-
sion (categorical outcomes). The annual incidence rate of
subdural hematoma was estimated using census data from
Statistics Denmark,16 standardized (age and sex) to the popu-
lationin2008andtestedfortrend(linearregression;eMethods
in the Supplement).
Regional data on antithrombotic prescriptions for the pe-
riod from 2000 to 2015 were retrieved.12 For each antithrom-
botic regimen, the number of regional residents who were us-
ers of that regimen on a given date was calculated, according
to the exposure definition used in the main study. Using cen-
sus data, the user prevalence proportion for this regimen for
a given day was estimated and hence an average prevalence
proportion for an entire calendar year. These analyses were re-
stricted to the same age population as in the main analyses
(ie, aged 20-89 years).
Probability results of 2-tailed tests less than .05 were con-
sidered statistically significant. All analyses were performed
using Stata SE version 14.1 (StataCorp).
Results
A total of 10 010 incident cases of subdural hematoma
(3462 women [34.6%]) were identified in Denmark during the
study period with a mean age of 69.2 years (median, 72 years
[interquartile range, 60-81 years]) and 47.3% were taking an-
tithrombotic medications. The 30-day mortality of patients
with subdural hematoma was 16.1%.
Comparedwith400380matchedcontrols,caseshadhigher
levels of comorbidity for the disorders included in the present
analyses, especially illnesses indicative of high intake of alco-
hol(17.6%ofcasesvs4.6%ofcontrols),butalsoregardingahis-
tory of hypertension (54.0% vs 46.3%), stroke (14.2% vs 6.8%),
epilepsy (6.6% vs 1.8%), dementia (5.8% vs 2.7%), chronic re-
nal insufficiency (2.9% vs 1.5%), chronic hepatic disease (2.6%
vs 1.0%), and coagulopathy (0.5% vs 0.2%) (Table 1). Cases had
less frequently completed 13 or more years of education (16.1%
vs 17.9% of controls) and less frequently had high income lev-
els (22.8% vs 33.3% of controls) (Table 1). All abovementioned
comparisons were statistically significant (P < .001).
With the exception of oral corticosteroids and postmeno-
pausal hormone therapy, preadmission medication use was
more prevalent among cases than controls for the drugs in-
cluded in the analyses and for the use of antithrombotic drugs
(Table 1; P < .001 for both comparisons). The risk of subdural
hematoma was higher with current use of low-dose aspirin
(cases: 26.7%, controls: 22.4%; adjusted OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.15-
1.33]), clopidogrel (cases: 5.0%, controls: 2.2%; adjusted OR,
1.87 [95% CI, 1.57-2.24]), a direct oral anticoagulant (cases:
1.0%,controls:0.6%;adjustedOR,1.73[95%CI,1.31-2.28]),and
a VKA (cases: 14.3%, controls: 4.9%; adjusted OR, 3.69 [95%
CI, 3.38-4.03]; Table 2 and Table 3). For low-dose aspirin, sub-
dural hematoma risk was inversely related to duration of cur-
rent use; eg, for a duration of less than 1 month (cases: 1.8%,
controls: 0.8%; adjusted OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.20-3.22]) com-
pared with a duration of more than 3 years (cases: 8.1%, con-
trols: 7.9%; adjusted OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.88-1.10]) (Table 2).
A similar relationship was not observed for clopidogrel, for
which the subdural hematoma risk remained fairly constant
(adjusted OR range, 1.46-2.18) and was independent of the du-
ration of current use (Table 2). The risk of subdural hematoma

ment). These estimates did not change notably when first-

corresponded to an adjusted OR of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.24-1.52) for
low-dose aspirin and an adjusted OR of 1.60 (95% CI, 1.21-
2.12) for clopidogrel. For oral anticoagulant drugs, limiting
analyses to first-time use was related to association esti-
mates comparable with those found in the main analyses
(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The risk of subdural hematoma associated with concur-
rent use of antithrombotic drugs varied across regimens. The
lowest risk was associated with concurrent use of low-dose as-
pirin and dipyridamole (cases: 4.2%, controls: 2.6%; adjusted
OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.99-1.38]), whereas the risk of subdural he-
matoma was highest when a VKA was used concurrently with
an antiplatelet drug (low-dose aspirin and a VKA: 3.6% of cases
and 1.1% of controls; adjusted OR, 4.00 [95% CI, 3.40-4.70];

botic drugs and subdural hematoma were stronger among
women than men for use of low-dose aspirin (P = .004) and
a VKA (P < .001) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Associations
did not vary substantially within age groups with use of clopi-
dogrel, a VKA, and a direct oral anticoagulant, whereas the
association increased with use of low-dose aspirin from an ad-

The regional data from the Funen area comprised 936 vali-
dated cases with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range,
59-81 years) and 34.5% females. Based on visual assessment
of brain imaging studies, 55% of validated subdural hema-
toma cases were classified as subacute or chronic subdural he-
matoma and 45% as acute subdural hematoma.15 Results of
analyses of associations with antithrombotic drug use based
exclusively on these validated cases and their 18 689 controls
were highly similar to estimates derived from the nationwide
data (eTable 5 in the Supplement).

[95%CI,0.83-1.45]),whereastherewasahigherriskofacutesub-

sociated with higher risk of both subacute or chronic subdural
hematoma(adjustedOR,2.59[95%CI,1.88-3.55])andacutesub-
dural hematoma (adjusted OR, 4.72 [95% CI, 3.31-6.72]).
Analyses limited to 650 cases with trauma of known se-
verity (definition of trauma severity appears in eMethods in
the Supplement) showed that current use of antithrombotic
drugs was associated with subdural hematoma in the low to
moderate trauma severity group (low-dose aspirin: adjusted
OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.04-1.92]; a VKA: adjusted OR, 3.51 [95% CI,
2.51-4.89]). In the severe trauma group, use of a VKA pre-
sented the strongest association with risk of subdural hema-
toma (adjusted OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.31-4.73]), whereas low-
dose aspirin was not associated with higher risk of subdural
hematoma (adjusted OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.53-1.63]; eTable 7 in
the Supplement).

Analyses restricted to validated cases revealed that cur-
rent users of VKAs were more likely to exhibit midline struc-
ture deviation on their brain scan (subacute or chronic sub-
dural hematoma: OR, 3.29 [95% CI, 1.14-9.51]; acute subdural
hematoma: OR, 2.80 [95% CI, 1.18-6.60]; eTable 8 in the
Supplement) and had higher 30-day mortality (subacute or
chronic subdural hematoma: OR, 2.77 [95% CI, 0.94-8.18];
acute subdural hematoma, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.62-2.89]; eTable 9
in the Supplement) compared with never users of anticoagu-
lants. Current low-dose aspirin use resulted in far less marked
differenceswithregardtotheseoutcomes(eTable8andeTable
9 in the Supplement).
The incidence of subdural hematoma increased during the
study period from 10.9 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 9.9-
12.0 per 100 000 person-years) in 2000 (441 cases in 4 036 965
person-years) to 19.0 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 17.8-
20.4 per 100 000 person-years) in 2015 (819 cases in 4 301 391
person-years) (P < .001 for trend). The largest increase in the
incidence of subdural hematoma occurred among older pa-
tients (aged 75-89 years; n = 4441) and went from 55.1 per
100 000 person-years (191 cases in 346 529 person-years) to
99.7 per 100 000 person-years (382 cases in 383 030 person-
years) (P < .001 for trend). The corresponding incidence trend
among men aged 75 to 89 years increased from 77.9 per
100 000 person-years (95% CI, 63.5-94.6 per 100 000 person-
years) in 2000 (102 cases in 130 899 person-years) to 135.5 per
100 000person-years(95%CI,118.3-154.6per100 000person-
years) in 2015 (222 cases in 163 778 person-years) (P < .001;
Figure 2 and eTable 10 in the Supplement).
The regional analyses revealed increases in antithrom-
botic drug use during the study period both as single drug regi-
mens (average prevalence proportion of 31.0 per 1000 inhabi-
tants from the general population in 2000 vs 76.9 per 1000
inhabitantsin2015;P < .001fortrend)andconcurrentdruguse
regimens(averageprevalenceproportionof2.6per1000inhab-
itants in 2000 vs 17.3 per 1000 inhabitants in 2015, P < .001;
Figure 3). Any use of a VKA increased from 7.4 per 1000 inhab-
itants in 2000 to 16.7 per 1000 inhabitants in 2015 (P < .001).

Thirty-day mortality after subdural hematoma diagnosis
declinedduringthestudyperiodfrom17.9%in2000-2004(432
of 2414 patients died) to 13.1% in 2013-2015 (314 of 2395 pa-
tientsdied).However,thedeclinein30-daymortalityovertime
was only observed for patients aged 20 to 64 years and aged
65 to 74 years (P < .001 for trend for both age groups), whereas
the 30-day mortality remained stable for patients aged 75 to
89 years (P = .40 for trend; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Nei-
ther this measure of short-time mortality, nor the annual in-
cidence rate estimates were materially changed after age and
sex standardization (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this case-control study that included 10 010 patients with
subdural hematoma, low-dose aspirin was associated with a
small risk, use of clopidogrel and a direct oral anticoagulant
with a moderate risk, and use of a VKA with a higher risk of
subdural hematoma. With the exception of low-dose aspirin
combined with dipyridamole, which was associated with a risk
similar to low-dose aspirin monotherapy, concomitant use of
more than 1 antithrombotic drug was related to substantially
highersubduralhematomarisk,whichwasparticularlymarked
for combined treatment of clopidogrel with a VKA. Antithrom-
botic drug use was found to be associated with higher rela-
tive risks of subdural hematoma in women than in men, and
fatal subdural hematoma was more strongly associated with
antithrombotic drug use than nonfatal subdural hematoma.
Incidenceofsubduralhematoma,particularlyamongolder
patients (aged 75-89 years), increased within the 16-year study
period. This observation appears to be temporally related to a
major increase in the use of antithrombotic drugs and in par-
ticular in the use of a VKA. The present data add 1 more piece

Although use of antithrombotic drugs has long been rec-
ognized as a risk factor for subdural hematoma, previous stud-
ies were either based exclusively on patients with subdural
hematoma (ie, with no comparison group)22-25 or focused ex-
clusively on patients treated with an anticoagulant.26,27 In a
case-control study from Italy with 345 cases of subacute or
chronic subdural hematoma collected from a single hospital
and matched to 138 786 emergency department attendees, an-
tithrombotic drug use increased subacute or chronic subdu-
ral hematoma risk (anticoagulant use: OR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.66-
3.64]; antiplatelet drug use: OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.07-1.89]).6
Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials reported similar,
albeit slightly higher estimates of the risk of subdural hema-
toma conferred by use of a VKA or low-dose aspirin.4,5 Despite
differences in setting and design, the present results are thus
in line with previous studies.
InanationwideSwedishregister-basedstudyspanningthe
period of 1987 to 2010, subdural hematoma was the most fre-
quenttraumaticintracranialinjury(excludingconcussion),and
the proportion of patients with subdural hematoma increased
substantially over time.3 A study from the United States also
showedanincreaseintheincidenceratesofsubacuteorchronic
subdural hematoma, and the researchers predicted that sub-
acuteorchronicsubduralhematomawillbecomethemostcom-
mon cranial neurosurgical condition among adults in 2030.2
Steepincreasesinincidenceratesofsubduralhematomaamong
olderpatients(aged75-89years)werefoundinthepresentstudy.
Furthermore, the present results emphasize that the ma-
jor shifts in patterns of antithrombotic drug treatment for older
individuals,28 and the increasing use of more aggressive an-
tithrombotic regimens, have already had a major effect on sub-
dural hematoma incidence. The present results may partly be
driven by increasingly rapid and easier access to brain imaging.
However, if this was predominantly the case, a decrease in
short-term mortality over time would have been expected as
a consequence of less severe cases being detected in more re-
cent years. Indeed, this seems to be the case for patients aged
20 to 74 years.
However, the 30-day mortality rate remained stable in pa-
tients aged 75 to 89 years, which is the age group with use of
antithrombotic drugs that was markedly more prevalent than
that of younger age groups. Increasing surveillance is unlikely
toexplaintheincreasingincidenceratesofsubduralhematoma
otherthanforafractionofthepresentfindings.Alowerthresh-
old for scanning patients who are taking antithrombotic drugs
could also result in higher detection rates of less severe subdu-
ralhematomacasesandbiastheresults.However,basedonthe
presentstudydataonimagingcharacteristics,treatment,andout-
come among validated cases, this scenario is unlikely.
The notion that trauma events could modify the effect of
antithrombotic use6 is supported by the present results based
on regional data. Risk estimates for preadmission antithrom-
botic drug use were higher among patients with low to mod-
erateseveritytraumacomparedwiththosewithseveretrauma.
Although based on small numbers, these results are compat-
ible with antithrombotic drugs playing a greater role in pre-
disposed patients (eg, due to age-related brain atrophy) with
a history of mild to moderate head trauma compared with pa-
tients experiencing a severe head trauma for whom there is
little role left for additional risk factors. This finding is impor-
tant from a public health perspective because the risk of ex-
periencing a small to moderate head trauma exceeds the prob-
ability of experiencing a severe head injury.
The present study has a number of strengths. The study
was performed in Denmark, a setting with free access to health
services, independent of income level. Population-based reg-
isters were used with complete coverage and continuously col-
lected data on all Danish residents, an approach that elimi-
natedrecallbiasandminimizedselectionbias.Ithaspreviously
been shown that the subdural hematoma code used to iden-
tify cases in this study is highly valid with a positive predic-
tive value of 96%.15
This study has several limitations. Even though the ap-
proach used in this study enabled the identification of subdu-
ral hematoma incident cases with minimal misclassification,
it probably resulted in incomplete coverage. Based on the re-
sults from a previous validation study, the incidence rates are
probably underestimated by approximately 22%.15 Also, the
small numbers prevented the assessment of the association of
individual types of direct oral anticoagulants drugs, or of other
adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor use with subdural
hematoma risk. Low-dose aspirin is the only antiplatelet drug
inDenmarkthatisavailableover-the-counter.Becausethecov-
erage of the prescription registry for low-dose aspirin is in the
order of 91%,29 misclassification of exposure caused by over-
the-counter use of this drug is believed to be of minor signifi-
cance. Other potential limitations of the present study in-
clude the lack of data on international normalized ratio and
alcohol consumption.
Among patients using a VKA, subdural hematoma risk is
known to be associated with international normalized ratio
levels.30 Information on this factor was lacking, and the ef-
fect of the international normalized ratio on subdural hema-
tomariskcouldthereforenotbeassessed.Alcoholoveruse,and
its negative effect on brain volume and associated increased
risk of trauma, predisposes individuals to subdural hema-
toma. In the nationwide study, register-based information was
used to assess this effect modifier and possible confounder,
which may have led to considerable misclassification. It is
noted, however, that the estimate of patients with subdural
hematoma and high alcohol intake in the nationwide sample
(17.6%) in the present study was comparable with the frac-
tion of patients with subdural hematoma classified with alco-
holism (16.6%) in the validation study.15
Furthermore, a higher frequency of other disorders pre-
disposing individuals to brain atrophy and associated with an
increased risk of falling (eg, dementia) was found among cases
compared with controls in the present study. Although ad-
justed for in multivariate analyses, residual confounding by
these and other potential confounders cannot be ruled out.

Conclusions
In Denmark, antithrombotic drug use was associated with
higherriskofsubduralhematoma;andthehighestoddsofsub-
dural hematoma was associated with combined use of a VKA
and an antiplatelet drug. The increased incidence of subdural
hematoma from 2000 to 2015 appears to be associated with
the increased use of antithrombotic drugs, particularly use of
a VKA among older patients.
