ABSTRACT
Introduction: In this study we (i) introduced time-motion analysis for assessing the impact of
workplace heat on the work shift time spent doing labor (WTL) of grape-picking workers,
(ii) examined whether seasonal environmental differences can influence their WTL, and
(iii) investigated whether their WTL can be assessed by monitoring productivity or the vineyard
manager’s estimate of WTL. Methods: Seven grape-picking workers were assessed during the
summer and/or autumn via video throughout four work shifts. Results: Air temperature
(26.8 § 4.8�C), wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT; 25.2 § 4.1�C), universal thermal climate index
(UTCI; 35.2 § 6.7�C), and solar radiation (719.1 § 187.5 W/m2) were associated with changes in
mean skin temperature (1.7 § 1.8�C) (p < 0.05). Time-motion analysis showed that 12.4% (summer
15.3% vs. autumn 10.0%; p < 0.001) of total work shift time was spent on irregular breaks (WTB).
There was a 0.8%, 0.8%, 0.6%, and 2.1% increase in hourly WTB for every degree Celsius increase in
temperature, WBGT, UTCI, and mean skin temperature, respectively (p < 0.01). Seasonal changes in
UTCI explained 64.0% of the seasonal changes in WTL (p D 0.017). Productivity explained 36.6% of
the variance in WTL (p < 0.001), while the vineyard manager’s WTL estimate was too optimistic
(p < 0.001) and explained only 2.8% of the variance in the true WTL (p D 0.456). Conclusion: Time-
motion analysis accurately assesses WTL, evaluating every second spent by each worker during
every work shift. The studied grape-picking workers experienced increased workplace heat, leading
to significant labor loss. Monitoring productivity or the vineyard manager’s estimate of each
worker’s WTL did not completely reflect the true WTL in these grape-picking workers.

Introduction
Occupational heat stress is a parameter that influences
several industries worldwide. In the agriculture sector,
occupational heat stress is very relevant because many
tasks rely on manual work as the prevailing and,
sometimes, only feasible method for gentle handling
of vulnerable plants. Workplace heat is difficult to
mitigate in agriculture, as artificial cooling or shadow-
ing toward the sun would be detrimental to growth or
directly harmful for the plants. The global wine indus-
try is large, comprising »0.2% of world gross domestic
product (GDP),1 and climate change has increased the
areas suitable for growing vines. However, climate
change may have also increased the heat exposure in
the subtropical areas, where the majority of the wine
is produced.1 This is noteworthy, because wine pro-
duction is still dominated by manual work. Some tasks
(e.g., transport of the grapes) have been motorized,
but the manual tasks by the grape-picking workers
remain similar to those developed 5,500 y ago when
the vine cultivation tradition emerged.2 However,
given the increase in environmental temperature
during the past five millennia in regions such as
the Mediterranean,3 the workers who currently pick
the grapes carry out their jobs under adverse environ-
mental conditions. In Cyprus, for instance, the mean

 maximum temperature in August (the main part of
the harvest season) is around 36�C.4 These working
conditions would be considered a heat-wave in
Central European countries such as Germany.5
Laboratory studies have shown that the above-
mentioned amount of thermal strain during grape
picking can impair the human physiologic function
and capacity to perform prolonged exercise and
work.6-8
In
addition,
field
studies
in
real-life
occupational settings have shown that workplace heat
exposure impairs productivity.9-13 These effects trans-
late to significant financial implications. Specifically,
the financial costs due to heat-related work absentee-
ism and reduced productivity in Germany during
2004 were estimated between 0.7 and 3.1 billion EUR
(0.8–3.4 billion USD),14 while similar calculations for
Australia during 2013/2014 indicated total losses of
5.6 billion EUR (6.2 billion USD).15 Therefore, it is
vital to identify means that will allow employees to be
more
productive
despite
using
traditional
work
practices in their natural habitat and – at the same
time – will protect their health and safety as well as
improve job satisfaction.
To date, there is very limited detailed and evidence-
based knowledge on the effects of workplace heat on
agriculture workers. Notably, the literature presents
no relevant studies conducted in Europe. Previous
studies in American9 and Indian10 agriculture workers
assessed the effects of workplace heat on productivity
by recording the amount of hourly individual-
harvested crops. The former study reported a non-
significant trend of productivity reduction in fruit
harvesters due to increasing wet bulb globe tempera-
ture (WBGT), while the latter study found that the
productivity
of
rice
harvesters
was
significantly
decreased at WBGT above 26�C. It is important to
consider, however, that productivity may not neces-
sarily reflect the true work time spent on labor (WTL,
that is, the time that a worker spends toward complet-
ing a task, not including breaks or other work-related
behaviors) since it does not take into account differen-
ces in the yield of farm crops due to geological and/or
environmental effects. For instance, factors such as
land leveling and soil moisture can locally affect grape
production by up to 50% within the same vineyard.16
Thus, productivity at a certain time of the day (e.g.,
when heat levels are at maximum) also reflects the
amount of crop that is available for picking at that
time which, as mentioned above, can vary by up to
50% within the same piece of land. This, in turn, can
distort the final productivity assessment of the work-
ers, and the conclusion on the effect of workplace heat
on
productivity.
It
is
important,
therefore,
to
discriminate between productivity and labor.
Time-motion analysis combined with physiologic
data can be valuable in assessing the physiologic strain
of workers during periods of increased occupational
heat stress.17 Time-motion analysis includes analyzing
movement and the time spent on each movement
through video analysis. This method is very powerful,
since the investigator can analyze every second spent
by each worker during every work shift, thus accu-
rately assessing WTL without bias. The primary aim
of this study was to introduce time-motion analysis
for assessing the impact of workplace heat on the
WTL during grape-picking. The latter is a moderate-
intensity work activity, which is self-paced and, hence,
allows for exploring both behavioral responses and
changes in work efficiency (time spent on work versus
breaks). The secondary aim was to examine if seasonal
differences in environmental conditions can influence
the WTL of these grape-picking workers. Finally, the
third aim was to investigate whether WTL of grape-
picking workers can be assessed by the previously-
adopted approaches of: (i) monitoring productivity, or
(ii) the vineyard manager’s estimate of each worker’s
WTL at the end of the work shift.
Materials and methods
The experimental protocol was approved by the
University of Thessaly, School of Exercise Science
Ethics Review Board in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. The study involved monitoring
grape-picking workers on four separate days during
the 77-day harvest of 2016 (August 16 to October 31).
Specifically, the grape harvest season was divided into
two similar time periods as follows: summer (38 days;
August 16 to September 22) and autumn (39 days;
September 23 to October 31). The 4 days that were
selected for monitoring (summer: August 17–18;
autumn: October 11–12) were chosen as the prevailing
environmental conditions were representative for each
time period. Indeed, the average daily WBGT of the
two monitored summer days (24.5 § 0.8�C) and the
average daily WBGT of the entire summer period
(23.8 § 1.3�C) were similar (p > 0.05). Similarly, the
average daily WBGT of the two monitored autumn
TEMPERATURE
331
 days (19.8 § 0.3�C) was similar (p > 0.05) to the
average daily WBGT of the entire autumn period
(19.5 § 0.8�C). The WBGT data used for these com-
parisons were recorded at the Paphos International
Airport, which is located approximately 7 km from
the monitored vineyard, and were provided by www.
wunderground.com.
Given the above-mentioned difference of 4�C
WBGT between the summer and autumn periods,
we calculated the minimum required sample based
on the productivity of rice harvesters at WBGT of
27–28�C (76.6 § 2.1 bundles/h) and 31–32�C
(56.4 § 2.9 bundles/h) from the aforementioned
study in Indian agriculture workers.10 Using these
data, an effect size of 7.67 for the differences
between our summer and autumn seasons was
expected. Assuming an a of 0.05 and b of 0.95,
three participants would provide enough power to
detect a statistical difference of a similar magnitude
(G�Power Version 3.1.9.2).18 Based on these calcula-
tions, a total of seven healthy and heat-acclimatized
(i.e., continuously living in the area for the � 90
previous days and performing other agriculture jobs
on a daily basis) workers with experience in grape-
picking (8–16 y of work experience) volunteered
and were recruited for this study. The workers
worked in a new vineyard each day. For all recorded
shifts during autumn, two workers (one male and
one female) were unavailable to participate because
they were working in a different vineyard and were
replaced by the vineyard manager by one male
worker. Therefore, the monitored group comprised
of six workers (four males and two females) during
the summer and five workers (four males and one
female) during the autumn. Given this change, all
season-related
comparisons
included
data
from
workers who were monitored during both summer
and
autumn.
Written
informed
consent
was
obtained from all volunteers before their participa-
tion in the study.
Two days before the start of data collection, volun-
teers underwent a familiarization session that included
information regarding all data collection procedures.
Anthropometric characteristics were also recorded at
that time. Moreover, to minimize participant bias (i.e.,
WTL being affected because the workers were being
monitored), sham measurements were performed one
day before each seasonal assessment (i.e., on August
16 and October 10). The aim was for the workers to
become familiar with the presence of the investigators
at the workplace and the video recording. During
these sham measurements, all procedures were per-
formed in the same manner as during the actual
recording days.
During each recording and sham day, the workers
were monitored from the beginning (06:00 during the
summer; 07:00 during the autumn) until the end of
the work shift, about 8 h later. Specifically, we cap-
tured workers’ movement via video and we recorded
skin temperature and environmental data throughout
the work shift. At the end of each work shift, we
recorded the vineyard manager’s estimation regarding
the WTL of each worker. No restrictions were placed
on water/food consumption or any other kind of
work- or non-work-related behavior. To ensure that
we did not influence the workers’ normal work rou-
tine, the temperature sensors used were miniature,
wireless, and were placed on the workers’ body during
the previous night. Also, to minimize participant bias
(i.e., WTL being affected because the workers were
being monitored), the true reason for the video
recording was hidden from the volunteers. Instead,
they were informed that the investigators were
creating a video that would describe the process of
wine making. Of course, once the data collection was
completed, all volunteers were informed about the
true purpose of the video recording and gave their
permission to analyze and publish these data.
Anthropometric measurements included height,
mass, waist-to-hip ratio, and skinfold (abdominal, tri-
ceps, thigh, suprailiac) thickness. The latter was used
to calculate body fat percentage according to the
Jackson and Pollock equation.19 Body surface area was
calculated using the Du Bois formula.20 Maximal
oxygen uptake was estimated using a non-exercise
prediction model.21
Workers’ movement was recorded using a video
camera (Hero 4 black, GoPro, California, USA). The
video camera was positioned in close proximity to the
workers (10–40 m) without interrupting their work-
flow. Temperature at the skin surface was recorded
every second at four sites using iBUTTON sensors
(type DS1921 H, Maxim/Dallas Semiconductor Corp.,
USA) to calculate the mean skin temperature [Tsk; 0.3
(chest C arm) C 0.2 (thigh C leg)].22 The difference
(DTsk) between the baseline Tsk (i.e., Tsk at time 0) and
the current Tsk (i.e., Tsk at time t) was also calculated.

 (Tair), relative humidity, and wind speed were mea-
sured continuously using a portable weather station
(WMR200, Oregon, USA). The weather station was
positioned within the vineyard, 20–100 m away from
the workers and was installed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Solar radiation (solR) data were
collected from the official website of the European
Union’s
Joint
Research
Center.23
The
obtained
environmental data were used to calculate WBGT,
and the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) using
the Excel Heat Stress Calculator downloaded from
www.ClimateCHIP.org.24 This calculator uses the
recommended method of Liljegren to calculate the
outdoor WBGT from meteorological data,25,26 as well
as information from the official UTCI webpage27,28 to
estimate the UTCI.
Time-motion analysis
The video recordings were used to identify work-
related behaviors. Work time spent on irregular work
breaks (WTB) was defined as any unprescribed work
cessation determined by workers’ own judgment, and
not based on specific time intervals or instructions.
Lunch time was not considered as WTB because it
was prescribed by management. We also recorded the
duration of uninterrupted WTL (i.e., continuous work
without break) to delineate the impact of workplace
heat on the frequency of breaks, which is different
from the duration of WTB. It should be noted that the
workers had constant access to shade either from the
vine trees themselves or from other trees that, in some
areas, surrounded the vineyard. Thus, the WTB was
divided into two categories: the WTB during which
the workers decided to rest in the shade (WTBshade)
and the WTB during which the workers chose to stay
under the sun (WTBsun). Based on these definitions,
the following five work-related behaviors were identi-
fied in the time-motion analysis: (i) WTL, (ii) uninter-
rupted WTL, (iii) WTBshade, (iv) WTBsun, and (v)
lunch (always taken outdoors). In addition, the video
recordings were used to calculate productivity using
previous methodology [i.e., the number of boxes full
of grapes picked by the entire group in each hour
divided by the number of workers (six workers during
the summer and five workers during the autumn)].10
Work-related behaviors were determined for each
worker individually through time-motion analysis
that
was
conducted
off
site
by
two
trained
analysts. The video recordings (60 min £ 8-h work
shift £ 4 days D 1,920 min total recorded over the
four monitored days) were analyzed within a 2-week
period. To minimize the risk of errors due to fatigue,
each analyst analyzed 6 h of video per day, while
taking a 1-h break every 2 h of time-motion analysis.
Due to the necessary pauses to record work-related
behavior, the overall ratio of video recording to time-
motion analyzing was 1:1.33 (i.e., for every 1 h of
video recording, 80 min were required for analysis).
Experimenter bias was minimized via training the
analysts to rate using the same short video to ensure
adequate agreement. For the same reason, the two
analysts worked in the same room and they were
instructed to seek each other’s advice in cases where
they could not make a firm decision on their own.
They were, thus, encouraged to give consensus group
ratings of work-related behaviors.
Data analysis
The Tair, WBGT, and UTCI were grouped into
5-degree categories (< 15�C, 15–20�C, 20–25�C,
25–30�C, 30–35�C, 35–40�C, 40–45�C, and >45�C),
while the DTsk was grouped into ten 1-degree catego-
ries (<¡2�C, ¡2 to ¡1�C, ¡1 to 0�C, 0 to 1�C, 1 to
2�C, 2 to 3�C, 3 to 4�C, 4 to 5�C, 5 to 6�C, and >6�C).
Finally, solR was divided into groups of 200 W/m2 (0–
200 W/m2, 200–400 W/m2, 400–600 W/m2, 600–
800 W/m2, and >800 W/m2).
To address the primary aim of the study, Pearson’s
correlations were used to detect whether the hourly
WTB and productivity were associated with the hourly
Tair, WBGT, UTCI, solR, DTsk, and Tsk. One-way x2
was conducted to detect prevalence differences among
the four (i.e., excluding lunch) work-related behaviors.
Moreover, two-way x2 analysis was used to detect
prevalence differences of the four work-related behav-
iors among the afore-mentioned categories of Tair,
WBGT, UTCI, and solR.
To address the secondary aim of the study, inde-
pendent samples t-tests were used to assess differences
in hourly Tair, WBGT, UTCI, DTsk, Tsk, and WTB
between summer and autumn. A two-way x2 was used
to detect prevalence differences between the types of
WTB (WTBshade and WTBsun) across the two seasons.
Furthermore, two stepwise multiple linear regression
analyses incorporating backward elimination at the
0.051
level
were
used
to
examine
if
seasonal

 differences in environmental conditions (Tair, solR),
heat stress indices (WBGT, UTCI), Tsk, and DTsk (all
independent variables) can predict seasonal changes
in WTL or WTB (dependent variables). This stepwise
procedure allows for careful assessment of each inde-
pendent variable through the change in the coefficient
of determination (R2).
To address the third aim of the study, simultaneous
linear regression analysis was used to predict WTL
during the previous work hour (dependent variable)
based on hourly productivity or the vineyard manag-
er’s estimate of each worker’s WTL (independent vari-
ables). Finally, a paired samples t-test was used to
investigate whether the vineyard manager’s estimate
of each worker’s WTL was similar to the actual WTL
(as assessed via time-motion analysis). The level of
significance for all analyses was set at p < 0.05. All sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0 for
Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All results are
presented as mean § sd, unless otherwise stated.
Results
The physical characteristics of all volunteers are
shown in Table 1. The slight differences between the
workers monitored in the summer and in autumn
resulted in no significant differences in any of the
physical characteristics recorded (all p’s > 0.05).
There were no relationships between the physical
characteristics of the workers and the hourly WTB (all
p’s > 0.05). During the studied work shifts, the work-
ers harvested a total of 9,600 kg of grapes. The crop
yield per m2 of land was 281 § 4 g of grapes. Produc-
tivity (2.2 § 1.0 boxes) fluctuated from 0.0 to 4.0
boxes of grapes (each box weighed 25 kg), depending
on the type of work done at a given time.
The Tair (mean: 26.8 § 4.8�C; range: 15.2–33.9�C),
WBGT (mean: 25.2 § 4.1�C; range: 14.0–32.8�C),
UTCI (mean: 35.2 § 6.7�C; range: 10.6–45.7�C), and
solR (mean: 719.1 § 187.5 W/m2; range: 0–906 W/m2)
fluctuated considerably throughout the study period.
Large fluctuations were also observed in Tsk (mean:
33.7 § 1.6�C; range: 28.2–37.5�C) and DTsk (mean:
1.7 § 1.8�C; range: ¡2.6 to 6.9�C). The percentage of
work shift time spent in each category of environmen-
tal factors, heat stress indices, and DTsk is shown in
Table 2. As suspected, the majority of the work shift
time during the summer period was spent under con-
ditions of high heat stress. Specifically, 56.4% of work
shift time during the summer was spent at Tair >30�C,
87.3% of time was spent at WBGT >25�C, 80.4% of
time was spent at UTCI >35�C, and 63.5% was spent
at solR >800 W/m2. These results may explain the fact
that the workers spent 57.7% of the work shift time
during the summer having DTsk >2�C. During
autumn, the environment was much more temperate.
Only 1.1% of the work shift time was spent at
Tair >30�C, 8.2% of time was spent at WBGT >25�C,
19.2% of time was spent at UTCI >35�C, and no time
was spent at solR >800 W/m2. During both seasons,
Tsk (Tair: r D 0.90; WBGT: r D 0.76; UTCI: r D 0.83;
solR: r D 0.81) and DTsk (Tair: r D 0.93; WBGT:
r D 0.76; UTCI: r D 0.84; solR: r D 0.87) were posi-
tively correlated with the recorded environmental fac-
tors and heat stress indices (all p’s < 0.05).
Analyses conducted to address the first aim of the
study demonstrated that, across the entire study
period, 12.4% of the total work shift time was lost on
WTB (WTBsun: 8.1%; WTBshade: 4.3%). The hourly
percentage of work shift time spent on WTB ranged
from 0% to 76.1%. The majority of WTB was observed
in the middle 4-h period of the work shift (p < 0.001;
Fig. 1). The mean duration of WTB [01:10 § 05:11
(min:sec)] significantly increased, while the mean
duration of uninterrupted labor [05:23 § 09:43 (min:
sec)] significantly decreased at higher levels of WBGT,
UTCI, solR, and DTsk (all p’s <0.05; Figs. 2 and 3), sug-
gesting that workplace heat stress leads to increased
frequency and duration of work breaks. This was also
confirmed via Pearson’s correlation where the hourly
WTB was positively associated with the recorded envi-
ronmental factors and the DTsk (Tair: r D 0.38; WBGT:
r D 0.39; UTCI: r D 0.40; solR: r D 0.32; DTsk: r D 0.29;
all p’s < 0.01). Furthermore, the total work shift time
lost due to WTB was significantly increased at higher
levels of Tair, WBGT, UTCI, solR, and DTsk (all p’s <
0.01; Fig. 4). Simultaneous linear regression analyses

 demonstrated that there is a 0.8%, 0.8%, 0.6%, and
2.1% increase in WTB for every 1�C increase in Tair
(R2 D 0.47; F(1,18) D 14.97, p D 0.001), WBGT (R2 D

Analyses conducted to address the second aim con-
firmed the existence of significant seasonal differences
in environmental conditions (Table 2). Indeed, all
environmental parameters and heat stress indices
were significantly increased during the summer com-
pared with the autumn (Tair: 28.9 § 4.2�C versus

 773.7 § 177.0 W/m2 versus 653 § 178.6 W/m2; all
p’s<0.05). It is logical to assume that these differences
generated the observed significantly increased summer
mean hourly Tsk (34.3 § 1.4�C versus 32.7 § 1.5�C)
and DTsk (2.3 § 1.7�C versus 0.7 § 1.4�C) compared
with the autumn (all p’s < 0.01; Fig. 5). During the
summer, 15.3% of the total work shift time was lost on
WTB, while only 10% of work shift time was lost on
WTB during the autumn (p D 0.004). This was despite
the fact that the crop yield per m2 of land was similar
in the two seasons (summer: 279 g; autumn: 285 g).
The majority of WTB was observed in the middle 4-h
period of the work shift during both summer
(08:00–12:00) and autumn (09:00–13:00) (p > 0.05;
Fig. 1). Interestingly, while the majority of WTB was
spent under the sun during both the summer (56.2%)
and the autumn (75.3%) (both p’s <0.001), the time
spent in WTBshade was nearly twice as large during the
summer (43.8%) compared with the autumn (24.7%)
(p < 0.001). Also, we found no significant differences
in productivity between the summer (2.3 § 1.2 boxes)
and the autumn (2.0 § 0.8 boxes) (p > 0.05). Back-
ward linear regression analysis demonstrated that sea-
sonal changes in UTCI account for 64% of the
seasonal changes in WTL [F(1,7) D 10.63, p D 0.017].
Our analyses addressing the third aim showed no
significant association between productivity and either
the recorded environmental factors, or the heat stress
indices, or the DTsk (both p’s > 0.05). Productivity
was positively correlated with the WTL during the
previous work hour (r D 0.61, p < 0.001; Fig. 6). A
simultaneous linear regression analysis showed that
productivity accounts for 36.6% of the variance in
WTL during the previous work hour [F(1,31) D 17.34,
p < 0.001]. Finally, the vineyard manager felt that the
workers performed their jobs correctly, at the usual
pace, and at a level that was acceptable throughout the
monitored work shifts. This is indicated by his esti-
mate for each worker’s WTL which was 95.0 § 5.1%.
However, this estimate was significantly higher (p <
0.001) than the actual WTL assessed via time-motion
analysis (87.4 § 4.5%). A simultaneous linear regres-
sion analysis demonstrated that the manager’s esti-
mate of WTL predicted 2.8% of the variance in the
actual WTL [between workers or between work shifts
for the same worker; F(1,21) D 0.577, p D 0.456].
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use
time-motion analysis to discriminate between pro-
ductivity and labor when assessing the impacts of
workplace heat. Time-motion analysis is a qualita-
tive method that has been used for some time for
the assessment of physical performance and work
intensity in elite team sports.29,30 In occupational
settings, it is one of the recommended methods by
the American Conference of Governmental Indus-
trial

 threshold limit values,31 and has been adopted to
determine the degree of correlation between hand
activity/force ratings in various jobs.32 Moreover,
we recently used this technique to assess the physi-
ologic strain of electrical utilities workers in hot
regions of North America.17 In the present study,
we extended this approach to labor assessment,
and we strengthened the methodology by applying
stricter rules and minimizing participant and exper-
imenter bias. Introducing time-motion analysis as a
tool to assess the effects of workplace heat on pro-
ductivity and labor effort in agriculture workers
was the main aspect of this study. As such, this
paper should be considered as a method developing
paper rather than an exhaustive (large scale) study
of
agriculture
workers
which
would
require
a
broader study (more workers and, possibly, differ-
ent
locations).
Though
time
consuming,
time-
motion analysis is very powerful, since the investi-
gator can analyze every second spent by each
worker during every work shift, thus accurately
assessing labor and productivity without bias. This
is supported by the fact that the present WTL and
WTB results were sensitive enough to detect differ-
ences between workers, days, as well as seasons
despite the relatively small number of workers
assessed.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the impact of workplace heat on a group of
European agriculture workers. We chose to study
grape-picking workers because wine is one of the most
important
European
agricultural
products33
and
because these workers carry out manual labor2 under
adverse environmental conditions. Indeed, our study
shows that most of the work shift time during the sum-
mer—the main part of the grape-picking period—was
spent under conditions of increased heat (Tair >30�C,
or WBGT >25�C, or UTCI >35�C, or solR >800 W/
m2) and was accompanied by significant changes in
Tsk. Our study also showed that WTB comprised
12.4% of the total work time during the recorded

 grape-picking shifts. This loss of labor time was
increased (i.e., longer and more frequent work breaks)
at higher levels of WBGT, UTCI, solR, and DTsk, with as
much as 26.7% of the work shift time spent on breaks
at the highest recorded levels of heat stress (i.e., DTsk of
6–7�C). Overall, we found that there is a 0.8%, 0.8%,
0.6%, and 2.1% increase in WTB for every one degree
Celsius increase in Tair, WBGT, UTCI, and DTsk,
respectively. It is important to also note that, following
recent suggestions,34 we evaluated heat stress using sev-
eral parameters and different indices to ensure a com-
prehensive and systematic approach.
We found significant seasonal differences in envi-
ronmental conditions, heat stress indices, Tsk, and
DTsk. Importantly, we also detected notable labor dif-
ferences between seasons, as more than 15% of the
total work shift time was lost on WTB during the sum-
mer, while this loss was restricted to 10% during the
autumn. Overall, seasonal changes in UTCI accounted
for 64% of the seasonal changes in WTL. Also, we
observed that the WTBshade was nearly twice as large
during the summer compared with the autumn, indi-
cating that workers were behaviorally thermoregulating.
This was anticipated, given the significant changes seen
in Tsk, which is the main driver of behavioral thermo-
regulation.6,35 Indeed, environmental and metabolic
heat gain lead to increased Tsk, which augments ther-
mal perception and/or cardiovascular strain. In turn,
this leads to increased perceived exertion that, eventu-
ally, causes reductions in work rate.6
Our results demonstrating that workplace heat is
accompanied by significant labor loss in the studied
agriculture workers are in line with previous larger
occupational studies in the literature reporting similar
effects on the productivity of workers in the agricul-
ture industry.9,10 Agricultural workers, and especially
grape-picking workers, cannot avoid workplace heat
exposure. Based on our calculations, our workers per-
formed moderate-intensity work with an average
work rate of »330 W for men and »260 W for
women (calculation based on known energy expendi-
ture for “farming, fishing, and forestry”).36 As such,
work-rest ratios should be 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 at WBGT
� 29�C, � 30.5�C, and � 32�C, respectively.37 This
would have important implications for the studied
grape-picking workers who spent 35.7%, 7.9%, and
1.6% of their work time at WBGT � 29�C, � 30.5�C,
and � 32�C, respectively, but were officially not pro-
vided with any breaks other than the lunch break.
The results of the present study suggest that moni-
toring productivity or the vineyard manager’s estimate
of each worker’s WTL at the end of the work shift does
not completely reflect the workers’ true labor effort
during grape-picking. Indeed, productivity explained
»37% of the variance in WTL during the previous
work hour (or vice versa), while the vineyard manag-
er’s estimate of WTL was too optimistic and explained
only »3% of the variance in the true WTL assessed
via time-motion analysis. The differences between
productivity, the manager’s estimate of WTL, and the
true WTL assessed via time-motion analysis may
reflect the impact of geological factors that are known
to influence the grape yield by up to 50%, within the
same vineyard.16 It is possible that these factors may
be less important in other agricultural jobs such as
rice10 or tree fruit9 harvesting. Nevertheless, we rec-
ommend that future studies should discriminate
between productivity and labor, possibly by using the
time-motion analysis technique used in the present
study or other similar methods.
The present results would be strengthened by assess-
ing a larger sample of workers and/or separate groups of
workers in different European countries, and by record-
ing also core temperature and heart rate. Studies in this
direction should be planned in the coming years aiming
to protect workers’ health and to preserve their labor
capacity and productivity despite the projected increased
frequency of heat waves due to climate change. More-
over, it is important to note that we did not control work-
ers’ clothing to ensure that we did not influence their
normal work routine and to minimize participant bias.
Based on the present results, it is concluded that
time-motion analysis accurately assesses labor effort,
evaluating every second spent by each worker during
every work shift. Moreover, the studied grape-picking
workers experienced high levels of workplace heat
which was associated with significant loss of labor
effort reaching as high as 27%. Finally, monitoring
productivity or the vineyard manager’s estimate of
each worker’s labor effort at the end of the work shift
did not completely reflect the studied workers’ true
labor effort during grape-picking.
