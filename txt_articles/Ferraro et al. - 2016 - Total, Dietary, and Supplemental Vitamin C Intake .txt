Abstract
Background—Previous studies of vitamin C and kidney stones were conducted mostly in men 
and either reported disparate results for supplemental and dietary vitamin C or did not examine 
dietary vitamin C.
Study Design—Prospective cohort analysis.
Setting & Participants—156,735 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) I and II and 
40,536 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS).
Predictor—Total, dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake, adjusted for age, BMI, thiazide 
use, and dietary factors.
Outcomes—Incident kidney stones
Results—During median follow-up of 11.3–11.7 years, 6,245 incident kidney stones were 
identified. After multivariable adjustment, total vitamin C intake (<90 [reference], 90–249, 250–
499, 500–999 and ≥1,000 mg/d) was not significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones 
among women, but was among men (HRs of 1.00 [reference], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.99–1.46], 1.15 
[95% CI, 0.93–1.42], 1.29 [95% CI, 1.04–1.60] and 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15–1.79], respectively; p for

 trend = 0.005). Median total vitamin C intake for the 500–999 mg/d category was about 700 mg/d. 
Supplemental vitamin C intake (no use [reference], <500, 500–999, and ≥1,000 mg/d) was not 
significantly associated with the risk of kidney stones among women, but was among men (HR, 
1.19 [95% CI, 1.01–1.40] for ≥1,000 mg/d; p for trend = 0.001). Dietary vitamin C intake was not 
associated with stones among men or women, although few participants had dietary intakes >700 
mg/d.
Limitations—Nutrient intakes derived from food-frequency questionnaires, lack of data on stone 
composition for all the cases.
Conclusions—Total and supplemental intake of vitamin C was significantly associated with a 
higher risk of incident kidney stones in men, but not among women.

Kidney stones are common, with a lifetime prevalence of about 10% in the US population. 
Diet is thought to play an important role in the development of kidney stones, particularly 
intakes of calcium,1–3 sodium,1,3 fructose,4 water and other beverages5–8. Ascorbic acid, or 
vitamin C, is an essential nutrient acting as a cofactor in several enzymatic pathways, the 
main dietary sources of which are fresh fruits and vegetables. Ingested vitamin C is partly 
converted to oxalate and excreted in the urine, thus potentially increasing the risk of calcium 
oxalate stone formation.9,10 In a metabolic study in 24 individuals, 2 grams daily of ascorbic 
acid increased urinary oxalate excretion by about 22%.11
Two previous epidemiologic studies have addressed kidney stone risk associated with 
vitamin C intake in men. In a prospective cohort study of men in the Health Professionals 
Follow-Up Study (HPFS), 1,000 mg/d or more of total vitamin C intake was associated with 
a 41% higher risk of stones compared with 90 mg/d or less after adjusting for age, body 
mass index (BMI), use of thiazide diuretics, and dietary factors.12 Recently, another study 
also reported a positive association between supplemental vitamin C intake and kidney 
stones in a cohort of 23,355 Swedish men; the multivariable adjusted relative risk associated 
with supplemental use of vitamin C was almost double compared with no use.13 To date, the 
only study in women was performed in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) I cohort and found 
no association between intake of vitamin C and risk of stones.14
However, the relationship between vitamin C intake and kidney stone formation remains 
unclear. First, the different results for men and women warrant further investigation. Dietary 
risk factors for kidney stones may vary by sex.3,12,15 Second, the risk associated with a 
higher intake (≥1,000 mg/d) of supplemental vitamin C in the previous study in HPFS was 
of borderline statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.97–1.39; p for trend = 0.01).12 Finally, interpretation of urinary oxalate excretion rates 
after vitamin C loading in metabolic studies may be complicated by ex vivo non-enzymatic 
conversion of urinary vitamin C into oxalate.16

 To examine the independent associations of total, supplemental and dietary vitamin C and 
risk of kidney stones in women, we analyzed data from a large prospective cohort, the NHS 
II. We also updated our previous analyses of the NHS I and the HPFS cohorts to include 12 
years of additional follow-up for each cohort, which provided greater statistical power.
Methods
Study Population
The NHS I enrolled 121,700 female nurses aged 30–55 years in 1976; NHS II enrolled 
116,430 female nurses aged 25–42 years in 1989; HPFS enrolled 51,529 male health 
professionals aged 40–75 years in 1986. Participants were asked to complete biennial 
questionnaires with information on medical history, lifestyle and medications; information 
from the questionnaires was updated every 2 years, or every 4 years for the food frequency 
questionnaires (FFQs). For the current analysis, participants who reported a history of 
kidney stones prior to the start of time at risk were excluded from the analysis. Similarly, 
those with a history of cancer (except for non-melanoma skin cancer) prior to baseline were 
excluded from the analysis, and those who developed cancer during follow-up were 
censored, as this condition might have affected their dietary or other behaviors. These 
studies were approved by the Partners HealthCare institutional review board. Return of 
completed baseline and biennial questionnaires was accepted by the institutional review 
board as implied informed consent.
Assessment of Vitamin C Intake and Other Nutrients
In 1986 (NHS I and HPFS) and 1991 (NHS II), participants were asked to complete a FFQ 
that asked about the average use of more than 130 foods and 22 beverages in the previous 
year; dietary information was updated every four years. Validation studies have 
demonstrated the reliability of the FFQ.17,18 The intake of dietary factors was calculated 
from the reported frequency of consumption of each specified unit of food and, except for 
oxalate, from US Department of Agriculture data on the content of the relevant nutrient in 
specified portions. The oxalate content of most foods on the FFQ, as well as of frequently 
consumed foods written in, was measured by capillary electrophoresis as previously 
described.19 The FFQ also inquires about vitamin and mineral supplements. Users of 
multivitamins and vitamin C supplements are asked to name the specific brand and to 
provide the amount and frequency of use. Our database contains the composition of over 
1000 brands of multivitamins and calculates the amount of vitamin C (and other vitamins 
and minerals) as the frequency of intake multiplied by composition. The same method is 
used for individual vitamin C supplements. For the current analysis, we used data from the 
FFQ for total vitamin C (dietary plus supplement sources); intake of alcohol; dietary intake 
of calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, fructose, oxalate, phytate, animal protein, and 
total fluids; and calcium supplements. All nutrients were energy-adjusted.
Assessment of Kidney Stones
Participants who reported an incident kidney stone were asked to complete a supplementary 
questionnaire about the date of occurrence and associated signs and symptoms such as pain 
or hematuria. A kidney stone associated with pain or hematuria was the study outcome.

 Medical record validation studies confirmed the kidney stone diagnosis in more than 95% of 
cases among participants who submitted the supplementary questionnaire.20 Stone 
composition was available in a subsample of the cases and found to be ≥50% calcium 
oxalate in 77% of NHS I, 79% of NHS II and 86% of HPFS participants.20
Assessment of Other Covariates
Updated information from the questionnaires was used for the following variables: age, 
BMI, and use of thiazide diuretics. Self-reported weight, from which BMI was calculated, 
was validated in the NHS I and HPFS cohorts.21
Statistical Analysis
The study design was prospective; information on diet was collected before the diagnosis of 
the kidney stone. We analyzed the association between total vitamin C and risk of stones 
using categories of vitamin C of <90, 90–249, 250–499, 500–999 and ≥1,000 mg/day. We 
selected these cutpoints based on our previous study in men.12 We updated exposure and 
covariates every four years. We allocated person-time contributed by each participant during 
follow-up to the respective category of vitamin C intake and calculated incidence rates of 
kidney stones for each category. Age- and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stones in each category of vitamin C intake were 
computed separately in each cohort with Cox proportional hazards regression models. We 
adjusted for age, BMI (13 categories), use of thiazides (yes/no), supplemental calcium intake 
(no use, <100, 100–499, ≥500 mg/d), intake of alcohol (7 categories), and dietary intakes of 
calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, fructose, oxalate, phytate, animal protein and fluid 
(all quintiles). We further analyzed the association using quintiles of total vitamin C intake 
and repeated the analyses in the NHS I and NHS II cohorts with a referent category of total 
vitamin C intake of <75 mg/d, which is the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for 
women. Linear trends were evaluated using mid-points for categories of vitamin C intake 
and median values of vitamin C intake for quintiles; non-linear relations were explored with 
models that included total vitamin C intake using restricted cubic splines with knots at 
quintiles. Finally, we constructed models of dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake 
separately with the following categories: <90, 90–249 and ≥250 mg/d for dietary intake and 
no use, <500 mg/d, 500–999 mg/d, and ≥1,000 mg/d for supplemental intake. Also in these 
analyses, midpoints for each category were used to test for linear trends across categories. 
Time at risk was 1986–2006 for NHS I, 1991–2011 for NHS II and 1986–2010 for HPFS.
Estimates obtained from the NHS I and NHS II cohorts were pooled with random-effects 
meta-analysis after evaluation of heterogeneity. Pooled results are presented for the two 
cohorts. For descriptive tables, variables were age-standardized using direct standardization 
to the overall age distribution (in 5-year age categories) in the study population.
Results
The analysis included 197,271 participants, with 2,494,789 person-years of follow-up. 
During a median follow-up of 11.7 years for NHS I, 11.5 years for NHS II, and 11.3 years 
for HPFS, 6,245 incident kidney stone events occurred. Baseline characteristics of the study

 cohorts are reported in Tables 1 to 3. In all the cohorts, the use of calcium supplements as 
well as intakes of potassium, magnesium, oxalate and phytate tended to be higher across 
vitamin C categories. Among NHS I participants, age and intake of dietary calcium tended 
to be higher across total vitamin C categories. Among NHS II participants, BMI tended to be 
lower across total vitamin C categories.
Results of age-adjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses for total vitamin C intake are 
shown in Table 4. For the NHS cohorts, the age-adjusted HR for total vitamin C intake of 
≥1,000 compared with <90 mg/d was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69–0.82; p for trend = 0.001). After 
multivariable adjustment, the HR for the same comparison was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.90–1.09; p 
for trend = 0.1). The analysis of quintiles of total vitamin C intake yielded similar results: 
the adjusted HR for the highest quintile compared with the lowest was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.92–
1.20; p for trend = 0.6). The multivariable adjusted HR for total vitamin C intake of ≥1,000 
mg/d compared with taking less than the RDA of 75 mg/d was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.93–1.17).
For HPFS, the age-adjusted HR for total vitamin C intake of ≥1,000 compared with <90 
mg/d was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80–1.20; p for trend = 0.6). After multivariable adjustment, the 
HR was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.15–1.79; p for trend = 0.005). The association between total 
vitamin C and higher risk was statistically significant only for the highest two categories of 
intake, and the median total vitamin C for the 500–999 mg/d intake category averaged 
approximately 700 mg/d over the course of the study. The analysis of quintiles of total 
vitamin C intake yielded similar results: the multivariable adjusted HR for the highest 
quintile compared with the lowest was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.04–1.43; p for trend = 0.01).
Among NHS I participants, the change in point estimates from the age-adjusted to the 
multivariable-adjusted model for total vitamin C was due predominantly to inclusion of BMI 
and calcium and potassium intakes into the regression models. Among NHS II participants, 
the change in point estimates from the age-adjusted to the multivariable-adjusted model was 
due predominantly to inclusion of BMI and intakes of alcohol, total fluid, calcium and 
potassium. Among HPFS participants, the change in point estimates from the age-adjusted 
to the multivariableadjusted model was due predominantly to inclusion of potassium intake 
into the regression models, and to a lesser extent to BMI and intake of calcium.
Results of age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses for supplemental vitamin C 
intake are shown in Table 5. The multivariable-adjusted HR for those taking the highest 
amount of supplemental vitamin C (≥1,000 mg) compared with those not taking any 
supplemental vitamin C was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79–1.04; p for trend = 0.5) in the NHS cohorts 
and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.01–1.40; p for trend = 0.001) in the HPFS cohort.
Restricted cubic splines analysis confirmed no significant association between intake of total 
vitamin C and risk of stones in the NHS cohorts (Figure 1). In HPFS, the p-value for non-
linearity for the cubic spline was 0.4 (Figure 2). By inspection, the risk became statistically 
significant at total vitamin C intakes of 700–800 mg/d. The HPFS participants with total 
vitamin C intake >700 mg/d in general consumed vitamin C supplements: few men had 
dietary vitamin C intakes of 700 mg/d or more. Splines for dietary and supplemental intakes 
are reported in Figures S1–S4 (provided as online supplementary material).

 There was no association between intake of dietary vitamin C and incident kidney stones in 
any cohort (Table S1): the multivariableadjusted HR for dietary vitamin C intake of ≥250 
compared with <90 mg/d was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.68–1.24; p for trend = 0.3) in the NHS 
cohorts and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.75–1.19; p for trend = 0.7) in the HPFS cohort.
Discussion
We found no association between intake of total, dietary or supplemental vitamin C and risk 
of incident kidney stones in 2 large cohorts of women. We also confirmed the previously 
reported positive association in a cohort of men, with increased statistical power and 
precision.
Vitamin C intake has been proposed as a risk factor for kidney stone formation because 
vitamin C may increase urinary oxalate excretion.10,11 However, it is possible that this 
finding might be due to non-enzymatic ex vivo conversion of vitamin C into oxalate in the 
collection vessel.16 When urine specimens were treated with immediate acidification at a pH 
of 2 and frozen at −30°C, intravenous administration of large amounts of vitamin C up to 1.5 
g per kilogram of body weight resulted in oxalate conversion of less than 0.5% of the 
vitamin C load.22 In contrast, urine sample handling, storage and analysis without 
acidification and immediate freezing resulted in up to 25-fold increase in urine oxalate after 
intravenous administration of vitamin C.22
Two previous population-based studies have assessed the association between intake of 
vitamin C and incidence of kidney stones in men. In the prior study of HPFS, intake of 
1,000 mg/d or more of total vitamin C was associated with a 41% (95% CI, 11%–80%) 
increased risk of developing a first stone, after multivariable adjustment for other risk 
factors.12 In that study, the higher risk associated with supplemental intake of vitamin C was 
not statistically significant; the significant association between higher risk and supplemental 
vitamin C intake in the current, updated study is likely due to higher statistical power 
resulting from 12 years of additional follow-up and >25% more cases. A recent analysis of 
over 23,000 Swedish men showed an increased risk associated with use of supplemental 
vitamin C (multivariable-adjusted HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.33–2.77) compared with no use.13 
Although data on supplemental vitamin C dose was not available, a dose-response relation 
was suggested, with HRs of 1.66 (95% CI, 0.99–2.79) for intakes of less than 7 vitamin C 
capsules per day and of 2.23 (95% CI, 1.28–3.88) for intakes of 7 vitamin C capsules or 
more per day when compared with no use.13 In that study, no data were presented for dietary 
or total vitamin C intake.
The reason for the disparate results between men and women is unclear. However, we 
previously reported differential associations by sex for several dietary risk factors for stones, 
including animal protein, sucrose, potassium, sodium and phytate.3,12,15 It is possible that 
the effect of vitamin C on kidney stone risk is different in men and women, and some data 
suggest the potential for sex differences in vitamin C metabolism.23,24
We did not find any association between dietary vitamin C intake and risk of stones in the 
HPFS cohort. However, this finding might be due to the relative low number of participants

 with very high intakes of dietary vitamin C: the median intake for the highest quintile of 
dietary vitamin C was 266 mg/d. Visual inspection of spline curves suggests that the risk 
would significantly increase at values of of 700–800 mg/d (Figure 2); in the HPFS cohort 
there were few participants with that level of dietary intake.
Our study has limitations. First, the possibility of unmeasured or residual confounding 
factors cannot be excluded. It is possible that the disparate results between dietary and 
supplemental vitamin C in men indicate unknown differences between supplement and non-
supplement users that affected our results. Second, nutrient intakes were derived from FFQs, 
although they were validated. Third, we did not have stone composition reports or 24-hour 
urine data for most of the participants in our study. Although the majority of kidney stones 
in these cohorts were likely the calcium oxalate type, we would not expect to see 
associations between vitamin C intake and other types of kidney stones. Fourth, it is possible 
that much higher levels of vitamin C intake than we observed in our study might increase 
risk of kidney stones in women. Finally, our cohorts were predominantly white, and the 
results of our study might not be generalizable to different races.
In conclusion, higher total and supplemental vitamin C intakes were not associated with risk 
of incident kidney stones in two large cohorts of women, whereas they were associated with 
higher risk in a large cohort of men. Dietary vitamin C was not associated with risk in any 
cohort. We advise that male calcium oxalate stone formers abstain from supplemental but 
not dietary vitamin C. Future studies are needed to examine associations between vitamin C, 
oxalate metabolism, and kidney stone formation and to explore the possible effects of sex on 
the relationship between vitamin C intake and kidney stone risk.
