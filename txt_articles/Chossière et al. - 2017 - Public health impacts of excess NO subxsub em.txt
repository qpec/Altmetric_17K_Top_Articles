Abstract
In September 2015, the Volkswagen Group (VW) admitted the use of ‘defeat devices’ designed to
lower emissions measured during VW vehicle testing for regulatory purposes. Globally, 11
million cars sold between 2008 and 2015 are affected, including about 2.6 million in
Germany. On-road emissions tests have yielded mean on-road NOx emissions for these cars of
0.85 g km�1, over four times the applicable European limit of 0.18 g km�1. This study estimates
the human health impacts and costs associated with excess emissions from VW cars driven in
Germany. A distribution of on-road emissions factors is derived from existing measurements and
combined with sales data and a vehicle fleet model to estimate total excess NOx emissions. These
emissions are distributed on a 25 by 28 km grid covering Europe, using the German
Environmental Protection Agency’s (UBA) estimate of the spatial distribution of NOx emissions
from passenger cars in Germany. We use the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model to predict
the corresponding increase in population exposure to fine particulate matter and ozone in the
European Union, Switzerland, and Norway, and a set of concentration-response functions to
estimate mortality outcomes in terms of early deaths and of life-years lost. Integrated over the
sales period (2008–2015), we estimate median mortality impacts from VW excess emissions in
Germany to be 1 200 premature deaths in Europe, corresponding to 13 000 life-years lost and
1.9 billion EUR in costs associated with life-years lost. Approximately 60% of mortality costs
occur outside Germany. For the current fleet, we estimate that if on-road emissions for all
affected VW vehicles in Germany are reduced to the applicable European emission standard by
the end of 2017, this would avert 29 000 life-years lost and 4.1 billion 2015 EUR in health costs
(median estimates) relative to a counterfactual case with no recall.
1. Introduction
Public health is significantly and globally affected by
outdoor
air
pollution
(WHO
2006),
with
the
European Environment Agency (EEA) estimating that
outdoor air pollution is responsible for more than
400 000 premature deaths annually in Europe (EEA
2015b). These impacts are driven primarily by
population exposure to fine particulate matter with
an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mm or less (PM2.5)
and, to a lesser extent, ozone, both of which have been
associated with an increased risk of premature
mortality by epidemiological studies (see the review
study by Hoek et al 2013 and the multi-city analysis in
WHO 2013b). Road transportation emissions account
for approximately 50% of the total health impacts
from ambient air pollution in Europe (OECD 2014).
Vehicle emissions standards initially introduced in
1991 (the so called Euro standards) aimed to reduce
the
air
quality
impacts
of
road
transportation

 (European Commission 1991). However, observed
reductions in ambient pollution have not been as
significantasexpected,andtheEEAnotedthat‘emissions
in real-life driving conditions are often higher, especially
for diesel vehicles, than those measured during the
approval test’ (EEA 2015b). A partial explanation for this
discrepancy came to light in September 2015 when an
investigation by Thompson et al (2014) quantified excess
emissions from Volkswagen group vehicles, ultimately
leading to allegations by the US Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) and admission by VW that certain
vehicle models had engines equipped with software
designed to reduce emissions during approval testing
significantly below levels achieved under actual on-road
operation (US EPA 2015).
Consequently, in October 2015 the German
Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered a
mandatory recall of all 2.4 million affected passenger
vehicles still in service and stated that they must be
modified to comply with European regulations (KBA
2015). Following the KBA order, VW announced that
the recall would begin in 2016 with completion
originally scheduled for the end of the same year (VW
2015). The first vehicles were recalled at the end of
January 2016 (VW 2016). For all three engine sizes
affected (1.2 liter, 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter), Volkswagen
will update the EA 189 engine software to ensure that
on-road emissions stay below the permitted limit. In
addition, for the 1.6 liter engine, VW will fit a flow
rectifier to the intake duct.
In this study, we estimate excess NOx emissions
from affected cars commercialized by the brands of the
Volkswagen Group that used the EA 189 1.2, 1.6 and
2.0 liter engines (Audi, Seat, Skoda, Volkswagen)
within Germany, calculating health impacts and health
costs throughout Europe which have already occurred
between 2008 and 2015, in addition to future
outcomes under different recall scenarios. We seek
to estimate the number of early deaths as well as the
total number of life-years lost which are at risk of
resulting from excess emissions. Morbidity impacts are
not evaluated or estimated.
2. Methods
Excess emissions in this paper are defined as the
difference between vehicle on-road NOx emissions and
the limit value set by the applicable European
Emissions Standard, Euro 5. Even though European
Union regulations only require vehicles to meet this
standard during the type approval test conducted in
the laboratory using the New European Driving Cycle,
the intent of the regulation is to limit on-road
emissions and achieve real-world air quality improve-
ments (European Commission 2007). In the absence
of an official factor to account for the difference
between laboratory and on-road testing, we use the
regulatory limit as the point of reference for our
calculations of excess emissions.
For effects occurring in the future, we first estimate
impacts assuming all affected VW vehicles in Germany
are modified to bring on-road emissions down to
Euro 5 standards by the end of 2016, with a fleet recall
occurring at a fixed rate over the course of 2016. We
then calculate effects for the counterfactual case that
affected vehicles remain in the fleet until their
retirement without on-road emissions being reduced
to
Euro
5
levels.
The
difference
between
the
counterfactual and recall cases yields the benefits of
the recall in terms of avoided excess emissions, health
impacts and health costs. The paper also quantifies the
impact for a case where the recall is performed at a
slower rate and completed by the end of 2017 with the
same start date. It should be noted here that future
health impacts under one of the ‘recall’ scenarios
correspond to a reduction of on-road emissions to the
Euro 5 limit value. While the absolute decrease in NOx
emissions which would result from a recall is difficult
to estimate, any recall, if carried out, would reduce the
average NOx emissions rate from the current estimated
value of ∽0.85 g km�1 to some lower value. We take
the regulatory limit (0.18 g km�1) as a reasonable
minimum value. It is possible to calculate the benefits
of smaller reductions as a linear combination of the
‘no policy’ scenario and the ‘recall’ scenario. As
detailed later in this study, the atmospheric response to
excess emissions is essentially linear for the range of
perturbations considered.
We augment and extend the modelling capabilities
used in Barrett et al (2015) to estimate the impact of
excess VW NOx emissions in the US. They used
an adjoint-sensitivity-based air quality modeling
approach to capture the impacts of spatially disaggre-
gate excess NOx emissions on aggregate PM2.5 and
ozone population exposure in the US. Due to
nonlinearity associated with differences in population
density and distribution, background atmospheric
composition and local meteorology, linear scaling of
the results calculated by Barrett et al for the US will not
necessarily yield an accurate or reliable answer for
other countries. In this study we therefore use a
chemistry-transport model to capture the impacts of
spatially
disaggregate
excess
NOx
emissions
in
Germany on spatially disaggregate PM2.5 and ozone
population exposure in Germany and other European
countries. The calculated increase in population
exposure due to these excess emissions is then
converted into policy-relevant metrics of health
impacts and costs.
The air quality and health impacts of the VW
excess emissions in Germany are computed using
spatially-resolved excess NOx emissions estimates.
Unless
otherwise
specified,
NOx
emissions
are
reported on an NO2 mass basis, consistent with the
standards used in emissions inventories. Excess
emissions are estimated from on-road measurements
of the affected models, as well as the number of
affected cars and the vehicle kilometers traveled. Their
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 034014
2
 spatial distribution is inferred from the distribution of
overall
NOx emissions
from
passenger cars
in
Germany, obtained from the German Environmental
Protection Agency (UBA 2016). A regional chemistry-
transport model is used to relate emissions to
pollutant
concentrations.
Concentration-response
functions
are
applied
to
convert
the
resultant
population exposure to PM2.5 and ozone into health
impacts. Given the significant uncertainties in estimat-
ing health impacts of air pollution and the associated
costs,
we
use
a
probabilistic
framework
which
propagates uncertainty through all aspects of the
calculation. Public health outcomes are monetized
using both the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) and Value
of Life Year (VOLY) approach. In this section we
describetheuncertaintyestimationapproach,theexcess
emissions calculation, the population exposure estima-
tion, health impacts estimation and the monetary
valuation of the impacts.
2.1. Uncertainty quantification
Uncertainty in input variables such as vehicle activity
and emissions factors (mass of NOx emitted per
kilometer driven) is propagated through the analysis
by performing a Monte Carlo simulation. For each
sample, a random draw is taken for each of the
parameters listed in table 1, according to the
distributions shown. The total excess emissions from
German light-duty VW vehicles is calculated for each
sample based on the randomly drawn emissions factor
and on the vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) growth
factor. These two variables and their distributions are
discussed in section 2.3. Total population exposure to
PM2.5 and ozone is then calculated by interpolating
results from the chemistry-transport model GEOS-
Chem,
described
in
section 2.4.
This
includes
compensation for bias in the modeled response
gradient for both ozone and PM2.5, each drawn as a
random variable.
The health impacts of variations in exposure to
PM2.5 and ozone are calculated by applying concen-
tration response functions (CRFs), as described in
section 2.5. For each CRF, the rate of increase in
relative risk per unit of exposure is again drawn as a
random variable for each sample. The total mortality
resulting from the excess emissions for that sample is
calculated by summing the premature mortalities
calculated for PM2.5 and ozone, assuming indepen-
dent effects. We perform one thousand independent
draws of each variable to yield one thousand
independent estimates of the number of premature
mortalities and Years of Life Lost (YLL). The rationale
for the choice of sample size is presented in
the supplementary material (stacks.iop.org/ERL/12/
034014/mmedia). The input variables and their
distributions are discussed in the following sections
and summarized in table 1. In monetizing health
impacts, we perform ten additional draws of a
distribution of the economic value of statistical life
(VSL) and ten draws of a distribution of the Value of
Life Year (VOLY), discussed in section 2.6.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we report the
median value of the output distribution. Data sources
and the uncertainties associated with the different parts
of our study are detailed in the following subsections.
2.2. Affected vehicle fleet and geographic
distribution
An inventory of affected vehicle models in Germany is
constructed from publically available sources (Auto,
Motor und Sport 2016, ADAC Online Autodatenbank
2016). It comprises cars marketed by the brands of the
Volkswagen Group that used the EA 189 engine in its
1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 liter versions (Audi, Seat, Skoda,
Volkswagen). We compute the number of affected cars
for each relevant model that entered into service each
year using annual new registration data published by
the German Federal Motor Transport Authority
(KBA). In order to obtain estimates for vehicle-
kilometers traveled (VKT) by all affected vehicles in
each year, the registration data are used as inputs to the
Stochastic Transport Emissions Policy (STEP) light-
duty vehicle fleet model, developed by Bastani et al
(2012).
We
further
calibrate
the
model
using
Germany-specific data gathered by the TRACCS
project (Papadimitriou et al 2013). A logistic function
is used to estimate the vehicle retirement rate.
The total activityof the affected vehicles is expressed
in vehicles-kilometers traveled (VKT) per year. The
growth rate of this quantity over time is treated as a
random variable and drawn from two triangular
distributions, one applicable to the years prior to
2020 and one to the years between 2020 and 2040. The
total activity for each year and each sample is estimated

 for each 25 km by 28 km grid cell within Germany using
a spatially resolved emissions dataset of NOx emissions
from passenger cars, as reported by the German Federal
Environmental Protection Agency (UBA 2016).
2.3. Emissions factors for affected vehicles
The estimation of NOx emissions factors (mass of NOx
emitted per kilometer driven) for the affected vehicles
relies on two sets of on-road measurements. The first
set of measurements is from KBA (BMVI 2016) using
the Real-world Driving Emissions test cycle, as
announced by the European Commission’s Technical
Committee of Motor Vehicles (European Commission
2015). NOx emission estimates are available for four
vehicle models (VW Beetle 2.0L EA 189 Euro 5, VW
Golf Plus 1.6L EA 189 Euro 5, VW Passat 2.0L EA 189
Euro 5 and VW Polo 1.2L EA 189 Euro 5). KBA
published one measurement per model, yielding four
on-road results.
The second set of measurements is from Thompson
et al (2014), who tested two vehicles—a 2012 Jetta
(Vehicle A) and a 2013 Passat (Vehicle B)—on several
drive cycles characteristic of different types of driving
(urban, rural, highway). Each cycle was driven one or
two times for eachvehicle, yielding a total of 17 samples.
We combined the results from both sources into a
single distribution, composed of 21 samples. Each
measured emissions factor expressed in grams of NOx
per kilometer is normalized by the fuel economy of the
tested car (in liters of fuel per 100 kilometers). A
truncated normal distribution of these factors is used
to perform the draws for the Monte Carlo simulation
method. The lower bound of the truncation corre-
sponds to the Euro 5 limit of 0.18 g km�1 for the
average fuel economy of the fleet of affected vehicles.
We obtain the emissions factor of each affected model
by multiplying its fuel economy (in L/100 km) by the
drawn value in 100 g L�1, yielding a value in g km�1,
from which we compute the excess emissions factor.
This approach assumes that the emissions factors scale
linearly with fuel economy, and that the cars that were
tested on-road constitute a representative sample of
the fleet of affected vehicles. The excess emissions
factor for each vehicle is multiplied by the corre-
sponding VKTsample for this vehicle for a given year,
and the sum over all vehicles yields the total amount of
excess NOx emitted each year.
Although VW have published technical details
regarding the modifications to be made to each vehicle
as part of the recall, at the time of publication there is
no reliable data regarding the effect that these
modifications have on the NOx emissions of the
affected vehicles. As such, we assume that a recalled
vehicle’s emissions are brought down to the Euro 5
standard of 0.18 g NOx/km driven.
2.4. Air quality modeling
The GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model, origi-
nally developed by Bey et al (2001) and since
continuously developed and updated, is used to
calculate the PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. The
model domain encompasses most of Europe, covering
15° W – 40° E and 33° N – 61° N. The resolution is
0.25° in latitude and 0.3125° in longitude (approxi-
mately 25 km � 28 km). This resolution corresponds
to 759 grid cells over Germany.
The GEOS-Chem model has been extensively used
at comparable resolutions to capture PM2.5 and ozone
impacts at the ground level. Numerous studies have
evaluated predicted PM2.5 concentrations against
observations in the US (Duncan Fairlie et al 2007,
Heald et al 2012, Henze et al 2009, Leibensperger et al
2012, Zhang et al 2012), and in Asia (Brauer et al 2012,
2015, Jiang et al 2015, Kharol et al 2013, van Donkelaar
et al 2010, 2015). Barrett et al (2015) used the model
over the US domain to predict PM2.5 and ozone
concentrations. Protonotariou et al (2012) used the
model over the European domain and evaluated the
predicted ozone concentrations in Greece.
We use meteorological data from GEOS-FP,
provided by the Global Modeling and Assimilation
Office (GMAO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight
Center. Boundary conditions for this nested domain
are obtained from a global GEOS-Chem run at 4° � 5°
resolution, using the same meteorological source. We
use the 2013 GEOS-FP data for all simulations. 2013
was a climatologically average year in Europe, with
the average temperature 0.08 °C warmer than the
1995–2015 mean, and 0.16 °C below the mean of
the period of interest 2008–2015 (NOAA 2016). We
use the EMEP anthropogenic emissions inventory for
2012 and note that emissions reductions between 2012
and 2013 associated with other anthropogenic sources
are less than 3% (EMEP 2016). Each simulation is run
for a 15-month period with the first 3 months used as
model spin up, during which the model is run but the
output is not included in the analysis, to ensure that
initial conditions do not impact the results.
A model simulation using baseline anthropogenic
emissions (excluding excess emissions associated with
the VW defeat device) is performed to assess the
accuracy of the model in calculating PM2.5 and ozone
concentrations. Two scenario runs are then performed
where a total of 72 and 130 kilotonnes (106 kg) excess
NOx emissions are added to the baseline anthropo-
genic emissions using the spatial distribution de-
scribed in section 2.3. Excess NOx emissions are input
in the air quality model as NO. This is consistent with
the fact that NO accounts for more than 80% of NOx
emissions from diesel vehicles (Carslaw and Beevers
2005, Yao et al 2005), and that the NOx steady-state in
the atmosphere is expected to be reached quickly with
respect to the timescale of this study (3 to 30 minutes
for NO concentrations of 10 to 1 ppb, following
Seinfeld and Pandis 2006). The uncertainty associated
with this hypothesis is further discussed in section 4.
Differences in the PM2.5 and ozone concentrations
between the baseline and scenario simulations are
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 034014
4
 attributed to the computed excess VW emissions.
Given that the highest estimate for excess VW NOx
emissions is less than 0.8% of the background
anthropogenic NOx emissions in Germany, we use a
linear approach in estimating the PM2.5 and ozone
impacts of intermediate amounts of excess emissions.
One additional scenario run with 520 kilotonnes of
annual excess NOx emissions was conducted in order
to verify the validity of this linear approach. This is
further discussed in the supplementary material.
Simulated PM2.5 and ozone model output con-
centrations over Germany are validated against
observations from the European Environment Agency
Air Quality e-Reporting dataset for Germany (EEA
2015a), as well as the entire European domain. Similar
to Caiazzo et al (2013), the model normalized mean
biases are used to account for the uncertainty in
predicting PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. They are
obtained
from
the
point-to-point
comparison
between available measurements and the model
predictions. The resulting distributions have means
of 0.11 and �5.0 � 10�4 (95% CI: �0.15 to 0.91 and
�0.18 to 0.35) for PM2.5 and ozone, respectively. This
implies that the model typically overpredicts concen-
trations of PM2.5 by 11%, and underpredicts ozone by
0.050%. The reciprocals of the biases are used as
multiplicative factors to correct the GEOS-Chem
model predictions in the uncertainty calculations.
Only the results from the comparison with the
observations in Germany are used in the uncertainty
calculations.
2.5. Health impacts
Population exposure to both annual PM2.5 and one-
hour daily maximum ozone concentrations attribut-
able to excess NOx emissions from Volkswagen cars
within Germany are calculated using the outputs of
the GEOS-Chem air quality model described in
section 2.4. The annual average PM2.5 concentrations
are obtained from the hourly output of GEOS-Chem
for the species that constitute PM2.5 (the GEOS-Chem
tracers NH4, NIT, SO4, BPCI, BPCO, OCPI, and
OCPO). One-hour daily maximum ozone concen-
trations during ozone season are obtained from the
hourly output for the tracer O3. Population exposure
is calculated by multiplying population counts in each
grid cell by the annual-average PM2.5 or one-hour
daily maximum ozone concentration within that grid
cell. The spatial distribution of population in Europe is
taken from the LandScan database for 2013 (Bright
et al 2014), which is aggregated from a 1 km resolution
to the model grid cells. Country-specific population
counts are obtained from the UN World Population
Prospects Division for each year of the study (UN
2015) and are used to scale the population density
distribution. We take into account the current (2016)
member states of the European Union and, due to
their geographic proximity, Switzerland and Norway.
We use the term ‘Europe’ to refer to these states and
note that the United Kingdom is still included in
future year analyses irrespective of the date the state
leaves the EU.
Epidemiological
concentration-response
func-
tions (CRFs) are applied to estimate premature
mortality resulting from population exposure to each
species. Cardiovascular premature mortality from
long-term exposure to PM2.5 is calculated using a log-
linear CRF, with a relative risk distribution taken from
Hoek et al (2013). They find a central relative risk for
cardiovascular disease mortality of 1.11 (95% CI:
1.05–1.16) per 10 mg m�3 increase in PM2.5 exposure.
Premature mortality due to exacerbation of both
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) as a result of exposure to ozone is also
calculated using a log-linear CRF, this time applying
the relative risk distribution from an American Cancer
Society study (Jerrett et al 2009). This CRF has been
widely used by previous studies to assess air quality
impacts (Barrett et al 2015, Jhun et al 2015). Jerrett
et al find a central relative risk of 1.04 (95% CI:
1.013–1.067) per 10 ppb increase in one-hour daily
maximum ozone exposure during local ozone season.
Country-specific baseline mortality rates for each
disease are taken from the World Health Organization
global burden of disease database (WHO 2014) and
are assumed to remain constant over time. We
estimate premature mortality for adults aged 30 and
older given that the epidemiological studies are based
on a cohort of participants aged 30 years or greater
(Jerrett et al 2009, Krewski et al 2009). The age fraction
for each country and each year is taken from UN
population forecasts (UN 2015). Alternative PM2.5
CRF shapes and parameters, including the integrated
exposure-response (IER) function applied in the 2010
Global Burden of Disease study (Burnett et al 2014,
Lim et al 2012), a log-linear CRF from an American
Cancer Society study (Krewski et al 2009) and an all-
cause log-linear CRF reported in Hoek et al (2013), are
evaluated to determine the sensitivity of the result to
the choice of CRF. We also implemented a log-linear
ozone CRF derived from the findings of Turner et al
(2015) that link changes in exposure to the annual
average of the daily maximum 8-hour average ozone
concentrations to changes in mortality from respira-
tory and circulatory diseases. These results are
presented in the supplementary material. In all cases,
a cessation lag structure is applied where 30% of the
mortalities due to exposure in a given year occur in the
first year, 50% occur equally in years 2 through 5, and
the remaining 20% occur equally over years 6 through
20, based on US EPA (2004) recommendations.
The relative risk factors for each of the CRFs are
treated as independent, uncertain variables. We assume
atriangulardistributionwithmodeand95%confidence
interval taken from the corresponding epidemiological
study.
We also compute the number of life-years lost for
each estimated number of premature mortalities. The
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 034014
5
 number of life-years lost is the product of mortalities
in each age group (for adults over 30) with the age
group’s
corresponding
standard
life
expectancy,
obtained from UN population forecasts for the
appropriate year (UN 2015).
2.6. Monetization of health impacts
Mortality effects are valued using two monetization
methods that have been widely used in the literature
and by government agencies. A detailed overview is
given by OECD (2012). The first method relies on
estimates for the monetary value of changes in
mortality risk due to PM2.5 and ozone exposure,
calculated as the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL). The
second uses estimates for the Value Of a Life Year lost
(VOLY) due to exposure to PM2.5 and ozone. VSL and
VOLY estimates are not additive but describe two
different approaches for placing a monetary value on
the health impacts of air pollution.
A distribution of VSL estimates for Europe is only
available in year 2010 USD (OECD 2012), therefore
this distribution is converted to 2015 EUR by
accounting for the USD/EUR purchasing power
parity, changes in economic growth and inflation.
The supplementary material contains detailed infor-
mation on the conversion. We estimate a lower-bound
VSL for 2015 of 1.82 million EUR and a higher bound
of 5.48 million EUR, to which we fit a triangular
distribution with an adjusted OECD base value of 3.65
million EUR as mode. For other years, we adjust VSL
distributions for forecast changes in GDP per capita
compared to 2015. The supplementary material shows
the VSL distributions for all years considered in the
analysis.Annualhealthcostsfromchangesinpremature
mortality are calculated by multiplying the annual
incidences of premature mortality due to excess NOx
emissions with a year-specific VSL estimate, assuming
themortality lag structure recommended by theEPA for
air-quality impacts (US EPA 2011).
For VOLY, we use a year-2015 mean value of
133 000 EUR per year of life lost, with a standard
deviation of 16 000 EUR derived from recommenda-
tions by European agencies (EEA 2014, EC4MACS
2012). For other years, we adjust VOLY distributions
for forecast changes in GDP per capita compared to
2015 in the same fashion as for the VSL. Annual health
costs from life-years lost due to exposure to PM2.5 and
ozone in each year and each sample are calculated by
multiplying the number of life-years lost by a year-
specific estimate for the VOLY drawn from a year-
specific normal distribution. Monetization with the
VOLY method is therefore sensitive to age, with early
deaths in younger age groups resulting in greater
estimated costs than if they occur in older age groups.
Total health costs from historical excess emissions
during the years 2008 to 2015 are expressed in year-
2015 EUR using a social rate of time preference of
3 percent (discount rate), as recommended by the EU
ExternE methodology (Bickel and Friedrich 2005) and
by the US EPA (US EPA 2014). Total health costs
because
of
additional
incidences
of
premature
mortality or life-years lost occurring in future years
are expressed in year-2015 EUR with the same social
rate of time preference as for historical costs. We follow
Bickel and Friedrich (2005) and also calculate results
for lower and upper bounds of discount rates as
sensitivity analyses (0% and 6%, respectively). These
alternative discount scenarios are presented in the
supplementary material.
3. Results
We report results for excess emissions, health impacts
and health costs for historical excess emissions from
the affected fleet as well as for future emissions from
this fleet.
3.1. Excess emissions
Based on the drive cycle tests by KBA (BMVI 2016)
and Thompson et al (2014), we estimate the overall
NOx emissions indices for the affected vehicles to be 16
grams per liter fuel consumed. The associated 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) is 5.0 to 28 g L�1. The
central estimate is equivalent to 0.85 g km�1 for the
given fleet distribution, compared to the Euro 5
standard of 0.18 g km�1. The total excess emissions for
the affected fleet over time are shown in figure 1. The
emissions factor is multiplied by the fuel economy of
each model affected in order to obtain the mass of NOx
emitted per kilometer driven.
The total vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) by
the affected vehicles between 2008 and 2015 is 354
billion km (95% CI: 349 to 360), corresponding to
emissions of 240 kilotonnes of NOx (95% CI: 28 to
440) above the total emissions that would have
occurred if on-road emissions of all affected vehicles
were equivalent to the Euro 5 NOx limit of 0.18 g
km�1. In the absence of a recall that brings on-road
emissions down to Euro 5 limit values, future
emissions from 2016 onward would be 560 kilo-
tonnes of excess NOx emissions (95% CI: 67 to 1100),
as a result of total expected future VKT for the
affected vehicles from 2016 onward of 838 billion km
(95% CI: 823 to 854). If, instead, on-road emissions
from all affected vehicles are reduced to Euro 5
standards by the end of 2016, future excess NOx
emissions would be reduced to 29 kilotonnes (95%
CI: 3.4 to 54). If the recall takes longer and is not
complete until the end of 2017, future excess NOx
emissions increase to 59 kilotonnes (95% CI: 7.0
to 110).
Figure 2 represents the spatial distribution of the
aggregated excess NOx emissions between 2008 and
2015. It is assumed to follow the same spatial pattern
as passenger cars NOx emissions, as reported and
gridded by UBA for the year 2010 (UBA 2016).

 3.2. Exposure and health impacts
For each year within the scope of our analysis and
each draw of the Monte Carlo simulation, the
linearity assumption allows us to compute the
increase in the concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone
over Europe, as well as the corresponding increase in
population exposure. Figures 3(a) and (b) below
present an example of the variation of the concen-
tration of PM2.5 and ozone, respectively, correspond-
ing to annual excess emissions of 48 kilotonnes of
NOx, the approximate median value for 2013. Figures
3(c) and (d) show the corresponding population
exposure to PM2.5 and ozone respectively, and are
obtained by multiplying the concentration of PM2.5
or ozone in each grid cell by the population count in
the cell.

 The excess NOx emissions result in reduced ozone
concentrations in almost all countries impacted by the
excess emissions (with the exception of the region of
the Alps between Switzerland and Austria). This is
attributed to the high concentration of NOx relative to
volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations at
these locations. Under these conditions, an increase in
NOx emissions inhibits the production of ozone due to
the removal of oxidants from the atmosphere via
chemical reaction with NOx (Seinfeld and Pandis
2006). These atmospheric conditions are denoted as
VOC-limited
chemical
regimes
and
have
been
established for Europe by previous studies (e.g.
Beekman and Vautard 2010, Martin et al 2004). In
other locations with higher VOC concentrations, it
appears
that
long-range
transported
NOx
from
Germany dominates ozone production.
After applying the concentration response func-
tions to the computed population exposures to PM2.5
and ozone, we are able to evaluate the number of
premature mortalities that resulted from the estimated
excess NOx emissions.
Table 2 summarizes the health impacts associated
with excess emissions in Germany and in Europe. It
features a retrospective analysis for the period 2008
to 2015 and three prospective scenarios, the first
one without a recall of the affected cars, the second
one with a recall completed by the end of 2016 and
the third one with a recall completed by the end of
2017.
The benefits of a recall completed at a constant
rate over the course of 2016 are obtained by
comparing the scenario assuming that all affected
cars are driven during their whole lifecycle without
any modification to the scenario where all cars are
brought down to the Euro 5 standard by the end of
2016. We also computed the benefit of a recall
completed by the end of 2017. The mortality
reductions from reduced ozone exposure amount
to approximately 10% of the aggregate estimates
shown in this table.
Figure 4 presents detailed estimates for the
number of early deaths occurring in the ten countries
that were most affected by excess emissions released
between 2008 and 2015. The results for other
European countries, as well as the distribution of
the number of life-years lost per country, are presented
in the supplementary material.

impacts
of
the
excess
NOx
emissions are shown in table 2. Costs calculated
using the VOLY method are approximately 50%
lower on average than those calculated using the VSL,
with an average estimate of 11 life-years lost per
premature mortality. This difference is due to the
prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory disease

 in the older population, resulting in the majority of
air-quality-related mortalities occurring in higher age
brackets with lower life expectancies (in terms of life-
years remaining).
Using the VOLY method, we find that past excess
emissions have already caused median health costs
of 1.9 billion EUR, and that median additional costs
of 4.6 billion EUR are expected under a ‘no recall’
scenario. 95% of these costs are avoided if the recall
is completed by the end of 2016; this is reduced to
90% if the recall is not completed until the end of
2017. The costs presented here do not take into
account non-mortality impacts such as new cases of
chronic bronchitis or increased hospital admissions,
but these are expected to be small relative to costs
associated with premature mortality (Barrett et al
2015).
Regardless of the valuation method used, we find
that the majority of monetary damages are incurred
outside of Germany, with approximately 60% of all
mortality costs exported to other countries within the
area of interest. This implies that there might also be
significant health costs within Germany due to diesel
cars operating outside of Germany which are not
accounted for in this study.
4. Discussion and conclusion
We compare our results to an existing study by
Oldenkamp et al (2016) which estimates Europe-wide
health impacts of VW excess emissions using a
simplified modeling approach. The authors calculate
point estimates for health impacts from spatially
unresolved, constant relationships between excess
emissions and mortality impacts. Using this approach,
the authors link estimated historical excess NOx
emissions of 491.7 kilotonnes to 5000 early deaths, and
estimated future emissions in the absence of vehicle
modifications of 802.2 kilotonnes to an additional
8200 early deaths. We use a chemistry-transport model
to estimate spatially resolved population exposure in
each European country as a result of the additional
NOx emissions in Germany. Using this approach yields
an estimate for premature mortality per unit of excess
emissions that is 50% lower than the value used in
Oldenkamp et al (2016), i.e. 5.1 vs. 10.2 early deaths
per kilotonne of excess emissions.
In the case of the US, Barrett et al (2015) report
median excess NOx emissions of 36.7 kilotonnes for
2008 from 2015 from 482 000 affected cars sold,
leading to 59 additional early deaths at the median.
Similarly, Oldenkamp et al (2016) found 33.8 kilo-
tonnes of excess NOx over the same period, yielding
59 premature mortalities. Holland et al (2015), found
45.1 kilotonnes of NOx and 46.1 mortalities. In our
study, we find that while the number of VW cars sold
in Germany is 440% higher than the number sold in
the US, excess emissions in Germany are 540% higher
than in the US, which is a result of annual kilometer
driven per vehicle in Germany being 19 percent higher
than in the US. We note however that our estimate is
for the average diesel vehicle in Germany, whereas
Barrett et al (2015) compute the annual mileage of an
average American vehicle.
Further comparing the results of these studies to
our results, we find that each unit of NOx emitted in
Europe results in 5 times as many premature
mortalities (per capita) as in the US. This difference
can be explained by the combination of Europe’s
greater population density and its more NOx-sensitive
background conditions. A study by Koo et al (2013)
found that in Europe, a combination of high ammonia
emissions and relatively low sulfur emissions results in
a higher sensitivity of population-weighted PM2.5 to
NOx emissions than any other region in the world
apart from Eastern China, where population densities
are comparable to or greater than Europe. This aspect
is discussed further in the supplementary material.
4.1. Limitations
Some sources of uncertainty in this study have not
been quantified. The fleet model does not account for
possible differences in distance traveled by vehicle
model considered. Vehicle kilometers traveled for a
given year are assumed to depend only on the year and
the age of the vehicle. However, we note that the
TRACCS report (Papadimitriou et al 2013) distin-
guished between four categories of diesel passenger
cars (small, lower-medium, upper-medium, execu-
tive) and found no significant differences among these
categories in terms of vehicle kilometers traveled,
when controlling for year and vehicle age (less than 5%
for the average vehicle). We also assume that the spatial
distribution
of
the
excess
NOx
emissions
and
population remains constant over time.
The excess NOx emissions are input into the air
quality model as pure NO. While it is usually
considered that NO accounts for more than 80% of
NOx emissions from diesel vehicles (Carslaw and
Beevers 2005, Yao et al 2005), it appears that the NO2
to NOx ratio in primary emissions from diesel vehicles
is increasing over time (Alvarez et al 2008). However,
the NOx steady-state is reached in about 3 to 30
minutes for ambient NO concentrations of 10 ppb to 1
ppb respectively (Seinfeld and Pandis 2006), which
means that the initial NO2 to NOx ratio is not expected
to significantly influence PM2.5 production. Ashok et
al (2013) have shown in the case of aviation that the
maximum sensitivity of population PM2.5 exposure to
the NO2 to NOx ratio in emissions was 2.75%. Since
PM2.5 is the main driver of the health impacts
estimated in this study, we do not expect our results
would vary significantly if we modified the NO2 to
NOx ratio in the primary emissions. As for ozone, the
fact that excess emissions are input as pure NO results
in increased nighttime titration of ozone. However, we
find that this does not occur during daylight hours due
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 034014
10
 to the high background ozone concentrations. Since
the ozone health impact metrics are based on exposure
to 1-hour daily maximum and 8-hour daily maximum
ozone concentrations which occur during the daylight
hours, the calculated ozone impacts are insensitive to
the primary NO2 to NOx ratio.
We assume the toxicity of different PM species to
be equal, consistent with standard practice. However,
it is worth noting that the particle composition of
PM2.5 is suspected to influence the related health
impacts, as pointed out by Hoek et al (2013) and
WHO (2013b). Since NOx emissions impact ammo-
nium nitrate most strongly, any differential toxicity of
ammonium nitrate relative to the basket of urban PM
for which CRFs are derived is not captured. The
standard GEOS-Chem chemical mechanism does not
include a detailed secondary organic aerosol model,
and these compounds are therefore not included in
our health impact assessment.
Although some epidemiological studies have been
published which find a link between increased
exposure to NO2 and premature mortality indepen-
dent of exposure to other pollutants, there remains
substantial disagreement with regard to the specific
health outcomes affected and their magnitude. If we
include the health impacts of changes in exposure to
NO2 due to VW excess emissions following the
recommendations of the HRAPIE group (WHO
2013a), we find that excess NOx emissions in Germany
released between 2008 and 2015 caused 1 300 (95% CI:
160 to 2800) additional premature mortalities due to
exposure to NO2, including 1 200 in Germany. The
associated health costs are estimated to be 2 billion
EUR (median VOLYestimate). Future emissions in the
absence of modification of affected cars are expected to
cause 3200 additional premature mortalities from
exposure to NO2 in Europe (including 2800 in
Germany) and 5.2 billion EUR in associated health
costs. Including NO2 impacts would approximately
double the total impacts estimated earlier, with
Germany bearing the great majority of this additional
burden. It should also be noted that NO2 is a precursor
to ozone and secondary particulate matter (these
effects are accounted for in our study).
When using a CRF derived from the findings of
Turner et al (2015), we observed greater reductions in
mortality due to reduced ozone exposure than our
central estimate (derived from Jerrett et al 2009).
Integrated excess emissions over the period 2008 to
2015 are estimated to have averted 28 premature
mortalities (95% CI: 1.7 to 85) with the Jerrett et al
2009 CRF, while the Turner CRF predicts 78 avoided
mortalities (95% CI: 0.28 to 640). The total impacts in
Europe of past excess emissions (from exposure to
both PM2.5 and O3) using the Turner CRF as the
central estimate would then be 1 000 premature
mortalities (95% CI: 93 to 2700). This result is to be
compared to the 1,200 mortalities obtained with our
central CRF (95 % CI: 130 to 2800). Using the Turner
CRF as the central ozone estimate, we find that future
emissions in the absence of any modification to the
affected cars are predicted to cause 2600 (95% CI: 230
to 6 700) additional premature mortalities in Europe.
This is to be compared to 2900 (95% CI: 310 to 7 000)
additional premature mortalities estimated with the
JerrettCRFasourcentralozoneestimate.Inconclusion,
changing our central estimate for ozone-related health
impacts from Jerrett et al (2009) to Turner et al (2015)
yields 10% lower mortality estimates. The supplemen-
tary material provides results obtained with different
PM2.5 CRFs.
In addition, our assessment does not include
morbidity impacts, which would increase the health
costs of the estimated excess emissions but typically
account for less than 10% of total health costs
associated with air quality impacts (US EPA 2011). It
should
also
be
mentioned
here
that
although
the epidemiological studies used here and in the
supplementary material are widely used in the
literature (Barrett et al 2015 for instance), they
represent only a small portion of the health literature
on PM2.5 and ozone and mortality.
We also note that no potential environmental
benefits of excess NOx emissions are included in the
analysis. An example could be the reduced use of diesel
exhaust fluid in the selective catalytic reduction, which
could lead to a lower risk of ammonia leakage, a
phenomenon which has been known to contribute to
the PM2.5 health impacts of the road transportation
sector at approximately equal magnitude as NOx
(Dedoussi and Barrett 2014).
Finally, we note that the assessment of model
performance and the corresponding correction by
reciprocal biases use the baseline scenario and the
officially reported emissions data. These might not fully
account for real on-road emissions, and this issue might
introduceasecond-ordereffectthatisnotaccountedfor.
However, given the magnitude of the perturbation (less
than 0.8% of total NOx emissions), this effect is not
expected to alter our results significantly.
4.2. Wider implications
In January 2016, and following orders by the KBA
(2015), VW started to recall affected vehicles with the
aim of reducing their NOx emissions to an as-yet
unspecified level. The modification costs per car have
been reported to amount to 60 EUR, excluding the
value added tax (FAZ 2016). We assume that the
vehicle modification can be completed within 1 hour,
including time required to travel to and from the
modification site. Applying an average value-of-time
of 40 EUR per hour (Korzhenevych et al 2014),
modification of one vehicle incurs a total cost of
approximately 100 EUR. The overall cost of the recall
would then be 240 million EUR. This estimate does
not include other costs such as increased fuel expenses
or social costs of additional carbon emissions if the
vehicle modification results in a reduction in fuel
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 034014
11
 economy. Assuming that the modification reduces on-
road emissions to the Euro 5 standard, the total cost of
the recall amounts to 5% of the median 4.4 billion
EUR health costs (using the VOLYapproach) which we
estimate will be avoided if the recall is completed by
the end of 2016. Our analysis suggests that the recall
will remain net beneficial as long as the per-vehicle
cost is below 1800 EUR.
Although this analysis was centered on Volkswagen-
manufactured cars operated in Germany, NOx emis-
sions from diesel vehicles in excess of the existing
standards constitute a broader and ongoing issue in the
European Union. On-road measurements have shown
that vehicles from several other manufacturers emit
more NOx thanthe applicablelimits(Carslaw etal2011,
Franco et al 2014, BMVI 2016), despite the absence of
any identified measures intended to circumvent
emissions tests. These discrepancies have motivated
the development of on-road emissions testing proce-
dures (Weiss et al 2013, European Commission 2015)
which were approved by the European Council in
February 2016. The VW vehicles modeled in this study
comprise 2.6 million of the 13 million diesel passenger
vehicles operating in Germany in 2012 (Eurostat 2016).
Consequently, there will be additional health impacts
duetoexcess emissionsfromvehicles produced byother
manufacturersthatarenotaccountedforinourstudy.In
addition,therewereatotalof86milliondieselpassenger
vehicles operating in the EU28 in 2010 (Papadimitriou
et al 2013), making excess diesel NOxemissions a public
health concern for all of Europe. On the modeling side,
current road transport NOx inventories are also likely to
be affected, if they are based on measurements from
laboratory test cycles (e.g. EEA 2013), given that
emissions from real-world driving conditions could be
significantly different than those measured during a
laboratory test cycle (Franco et al 2014).

We would like to thank the German Umweltbunde-
samt, in particular Mr Stefan Feigenspan and Mr
Michael Kotzulla, for their valuable help in obtaining
data on the spatial distribution of NOx emissions in
Germany.
