 The Ethics of Vaccination Nudges in Pediatric Practice

Abstract Techniques from behavioral economics—nudges—may help physicians
increase pediatric vaccine compliance, but critics have objected that nudges can
undermine autonomy. Since autonomy is a centrally important value in healthcare
decision-making contexts, it counts against pediatric vaccination nudges if they
undermine parental autonomy. Advocates for healthcare nudges have resisted the
charge that nudges undermine autonomy, and the recent bioethics literature illus-
trates the current intractability of this debate. This article rejects a principle to which
parties on both sides of this debate sometimes seem committed: that nudges are
morally permissible only if they are consistent with autonomy. Instead, I argue that,
at least in the case of pediatric vaccination, some autonomy-undermining nudges
may be morally justified. This is because parental autonomy in pediatric decision-
making is not as morally valuable as the autonomy of adult patients, and because the
interests of both the vaccinated child and other members of the community can
sometimes be weighty enough to justify autonomy-infringing pediatric vaccination
nudges. This article concludes with a set of worries about the effect of pediatric
vaccination nudges on parent-physician relationships, and it calls on the American
Academy of Pediatrics to draw on scientific and bioethics research to develop
guidelines for the use of nudges in pediatric practice and, in particular, for the use of
pediatric vaccination nudges.

 As many as 20–40 % of physicians dismiss (or refuse to accept) families that do not
agree to vaccinate their children (Flanagan-Klygis et al. 2005; O’Leary et al. 2015).
This practice violates the guidelines developed by Douglas Diekema and the
Committee on Bioethics of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), according
to which physicians should ‘‘avoid discharging patients from their practices solely
because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child’’(Diekema and American
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics 2005, 1430). This AAP committee
directs physicians to revisit vaccination decisions with vaccine-refusing parents on
subsequent clinic visits, with the hope that they will change their minds. But
Diekema and the AAP Committee on Bioethics may be too optimistic about the
tractability of vaccine refusers. Recent studies show that factual information about
vaccines is usually unpersuasive (Dube
´ et al. 2015; Nyhan et al. 2014), even when
physicians have received specialized training in vaccine communication (Henrikson
et al. 2015). Physicians also find it emotionally draining to have unproductive
discussions with vaccine refusers (Kempe et al. 2011). And it may become
financially draining for physicians to tolerate vaccine refusers in their practices, as
accountable care organizations acquire greater power to incentivize preventative
healthcare delivery, including immunizations (Gleeson et al. 2016). Finally,
physicians worry that vaccine refusers will infect other patients, inviting potential
malpractice lawsuits (Block 2015).
Physicians usually do not have a legal right to treat children over the objections
of their parents. There are exceptions to the law’s deference to parental authority,
but the AAP Committee on Bioethics argues that vaccine refusal does not usually
impose significant enough risks of serious enough harms to qualify for those
exceptions (Diekema and American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics
2005). Accordingly, physicians who do not want to tolerate vaccine refusers in their
practices may seem to have little choice but to dismiss them.
There may be another way. When people make decisions about topics outside
their areas of expertise, they are especially vulnerable to being unconsciously
influenced by factors that are not relevant to the facts they are considering. Social
psychologists and cognitive scientists have shown that our decisions can be
influenced, for example, by the formats in which people present us with information
and the beliefs we have about the attitudes and practices of other members of our
social groups (Ariely 2010; Haidt 2012; Kahneman 2011). Someone who is able to
direct these (and other) kinds of unconscious cognitive processes can sway our
decisions. To use language that Thaler and Sunstein (2009) introduced, someone
who structures our ‘choice architecture’ in the right way can trigger unconscious
reasoning processes to incline us toward a particular choice; this is a nudge.
The early literature on nudges focused primarily on their usefulness for public
policy and in other institutional contexts. For example, research has shown that
employers can increase workplace retirement plan enrollment rates if they enroll
employees by default (with an option to opt out), instead of waiting for employees
to make a proactive decision to join the plan (Butrica and Karamcheva 2015; Choi
et al. 2003). But there has a been a recent flurry of interest in potential healthcare
nudges (Cohen 2013; Halpern et al. 2007; Li and Chapman 2013; Stevens 2014;
Swindell et al. 2010).

 The most significant empirical work on pediatric vaccination nudges provides
evidence that default nudges can increase vaccine compliance, in much the same
way as default nudges can increase participation in workplace retirement plans.
Douglas Opel and his collaborators have shown that physicians who treat routine
pediatric vaccination as the default option, and who proceed to vaccinate children
until parents actively refuse, face only one-third as much vaccine refusal as do
physicians who treat not-vaccinating as a default from which parents have to be
convinced to deviate (Opel and Omer 2015; Opel et al. 2013, 2015).
Opel et al. identify the relevant default in terms of a distinction between
‘presumptive’ and ‘participatory’ formats for interactions between physicians and
parents:
[P]resumptive formats were ones that linguistically presupposed that parents
would vaccinate, such as declarations that shots would be given (e.g.,‘‘Well,
we have to do some shots’’)…Participatory formats were ones that linguis-
tically provided parents with relatively more decision-making latitude, such as
polar interrogatives (e.g., ‘‘Are we going to do shots today?’’) and open
interrogatives (e.g., ‘‘What do you want to do about shots?’’), or ones that
presupposed that parents would not vaccinate (e.g., ‘‘You’re still declining
shots?’’) (Opel et al. 2013, 1039).
Presumptive formats treat vaccination as a default that parents may opt out of, while
participatory formats treat vaccination as an option that must be proactively chosen.
Using a presumptive format default works: three times as many parents (83 vs
26 %; P \ .001) ‘‘resisted vaccine recommendations when providers used a
participatory rather than presumptive initiation format’’ (Opel et al. 2013, 1040).
Opel et al. have shown that default nudges may incline parents to agree to
vaccinate their children. But other kinds of nudges could increase pediatric vaccine
compliance, too (Gostin 2015; Stevens 2014). Vaccination nudges could use
framing devices, if they presented information about vaccination in terms of
potential gains, rather than potential losses (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). For
example, pediatricians could say things like ‘‘every year, children around the world
receive hundreds of millions of vaccines, and over 99.999 % of them have no
serious complications,’’ and pediatricians could avoid saying (factually equivalent)
statements like ‘‘every year, hundreds of children around the world experience
serious vaccine complications, out of the hundreds of millions who are vaccinated.’’
Vaccination nudges might incorporate commitment devices, if, at a time prior to
vaccination, people were invited to commit to vaccinating (Milkman et al. 2011).
For example, whenever there is a new visit for a first patient, parents might be
invited to sign a form that includes language to the effect that the parent agrees to
vaccinate their children.
Vaccination nudges might also use various kinds of incentives to nudge parents
to vaccinate (Banerjee et al. 2010; Giuffrida and Torgerson 1997). For example,
physicians could give parents cash payments for completing vaccine series, or they
could provide parents with other benefits in exchange for vaccine compliance.
Vaccination nudges could invoke social norms, too, if people were told that
almost everyone vaccinated (Li and Chapman 2013). For example, parents might be
HEC Forum
123
 given the latest data from the CDC showing that 80–90 % of US children are fully
vaccinated by age five. Or physicians might provide information about vaccination
rates in the local community, or among other social identity groups (e.g., race,
religion) of which parents are members.
The Case for Pediatric Vaccination Nudges
There are three reasons to use nudges to increase pediatric vaccine compliance:
They may be effective, they are efficient, and they are less coercive than other
methods of increasing vaccine compliance.
If some pediatric vaccination nudges work, then that is a very good reason to use
them, especially since so little else has been shown to be effective at overcoming
vaccine hesitancy and preventing vaccine refusal. However, while decision science
is an established field, we are still at the early stages of research into the
effectiveness of particular kinds of nudges for increasing pediatric vaccination
compliance. But as the previous section shows, there are reasons to think that some
kinds of nudges may incline vaccine hesitant parents to agree to vaccinate their
children.
Another reason for physicians to use pediatric vaccination nudges is because they
are not only effective, but also efficient. Nudges ‘‘take little effort beyond
constructing a different default option or different wording’’ (Li and Chapman 2013,
195), and they require ‘‘minimal…time and training’’ (Stevens 2014, 1101).
A final reason to use pediatric vaccination nudges is that they may have a morally
commendable (or at least morally neutral) influence on the decision-making of
nudged parents (Dubov and Phung 2015). Advocates of nudging argue that nudges
preserve liberty, because they leave nudged people with the same set of options, and
because the influence of nudges is (supposed to be) easy to escape (Thaler and
Sunstein 2009). Also, nudges are sometimes thought to enhance autonomy, by
helping people overcome weakness of will, or by otherwise de-biasing their
decision-making, e.g., helping people to resist anxiety-based vaccine hesitancy
(Cohen 2013). More importantly, nudges do less to undermine autonomy than more
coercive policies may do. For example, daycare and school immunization
mandates—in the absence of non-medical exemptions policies—may coerce parents
to vaccinate, if parents are unable to care for or educate their children at home.
Nudges and Autonomy: An Objection and Two Responses
Others have been less optimistic about the impact of nudges on autonomy
(Blumenthal-Barby and Burroughs 2012; Ploug and Holm 2015; Saghai 2013;
Sagoff 2013). Some worry that the influence of nudges may not be easy to resist,
especially if they are more effective. Also, nudges may seem to induce bad
reasoning, if they trigger people’s biases to influence their choices. So, a major
worry about nudges—and healthcare nudges, in particular—focuses on how they
impact the autonomy of people who are nudged.

 Autonomous agents are self-governing: they affirm the motives and results of
their actions. Philosophers disagree about what personal autonomy involves—for a
review of the major positions, see Buss (2014)—but we may say that autonomous
decisions are caused by agents, or are at least made in accordance with reasons
agents can endorse. However, we need not travel too far into the weeds of debates
about autonomy for the purposes of this paper, but can instead reflect on the
conditions of informed consent, since informed consent is the primary means by
which patient autonomy is protected in healthcare decision-making (Faden and
Beauchamp 1986). Medical interventions receive informed consent when informed
and competent patients voluntarily consent to them.
There are many reasons why a patient’s consent to a procedure may not qualify
as informed consent. For example, if a physician lies to a patient—or otherwise
deceives her—then the patient’s consent may be insufficiently well-informed. And
if a physician uses coercion—by threatening harm if the patient is noncompliant—
then the patient’s consent may be insufficiently voluntary. But nudges do not
usually involve deception or coercion. Instead, if nudges undermine autonomy it is
because they involve manipulation (Ploug and Holm 2015). Nudges may be
manipulative because they use unconscious cognitive processes to sway our
decisions. Nudges exploit ‘‘nonrational elements of psychological makeup or…[in-
fluence] choices in a way that is not obvious to the subject’’ (Blumenthal-Barby and
Burroughs 2012, 5). Manipulated consent may be inconsistent with informed
consent, since a manipulated decision may not be fully voluntary.
Advocates of nudging in healthcare contexts have two responses to the charge
that nudges are manipulative. One option is to deny that nudges are manipulative.
Unfortunately, this sort of defense requires engaging in larger debates about
nudging and autonomy (and informed consent). Among other things, we must
consider whether different kinds of nudges undermine autonomy to different
degrees. For example, framing and default nudges may undermine autonomy more
than some kinds of pre-commitment nudges do. And getting the facts and moral
arguments right regarding the autonomy-compromising power of particular nudges
requires much more work than can be done in this paper. (For example, a recent
research paper attempts to resolve these questions just for different kinds of framing
nudges (Chwang 2016).) Also, manipulation and autonomy are contested concepts
(as is the related concept of informed consent). Whether particular nudges
manipulate in ways that undermine autonomy (or informed consent) may depend on
which version of those concepts is the right one (Ploug and Holm 2015). A short
article, such as this one, cannot hope to resolve these debates.
Until we have a clearer sense of whether and how particular nudges undermine
autonomy, a second strategy for defending pediatric vaccination nudges may be
more fruitful. We might be able to justify these nudges if we could show that
infringements on autonomy are outweighed by the benefits of nudging. This sort of
argument requires both an account of the value of autonomy for a particular kind of
decision (and, therefore, the disvalue of infringements on autonomy), as well as an
account of the benefits of the nudge. At one extreme, autonomy-undermining
nudges may be morally unproblematic in contexts in which autonomy (and the
related process of informed consent) is not important, because in these contexts
HEC Forum
123
 autonomy-undermining nudges would have no moral costs. For example, Chwang
(2015) claims that it is morally unproblematic for people selling bicycles to nudge
their customers, since informed consent is not required in decisions about whether
to purchase a bicycle (though, of course, consent is necessary in these transactions).
In healthcare contexts, however, autonomy (including informed consent) is centrally
important. So, healthcare nudges that undermine autonomy (and informed consent)
may impose real moral costs, unlike bicycle-selling nudges. Therefore, if autonomy-
undermining healthcare nudges are morally permissible, it is because those nudges
promote goods that compensate for the moral costs of undermining autonomy.
I suspect that this second strategy for defending nudges will fail to justify most
healthcare nudges. The autonomy of adult patients (and older child patients) is
especially valuable, and not easily outweighed. Also, most of the benefits of most
healthcare nudges accrue to the nudged patient; most healthcare nudges are
primarily paternalistic. And paternalism is not a very weighty reason to undermine
the autonomy of adults, especially in healthcare contexts.
There are two reasons to think that pediatric vaccination nudges are more likely
to be ethically justified than other kinds of autonomy-undermining healthcare
nudges. On one hand, pediatric vaccination promotes especially valuable goods.
Like most healthcare nudges, pediatric vaccination nudges promote the health of the
patient, but these nudges also protect the health of other members of the
community. These are people who would have been vulnerable to infection if the
child patient were not vaccinated. On the other hand, autonomy-undermining
pediatric vaccination nudges may not impose as significant a moral cost as do other
autonomy-undermining healthcare nudges. This is because pediatric vaccination
nudges usually undermine the autonomy of parents, and parental autonomy in
pediatric decision-making is not as morally valuable as the autonomy of adult
patients, which is the traditional locus of concern about autonomy in healthcare
contexts. I develop both of these arguments in the following sections.
Before proceeding, it may be helpful to note that I am not committed to any
particular account of the value of autonomy, or of autonomy’s commensurability
with other values. But I hope it is not too controversial to assume the following:
autonomy is not the only important value in healthcare decision-making contexts;
justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for human rights matter, too. And
autonomy is not of absolute value in healthcare decision-making contexts, since
nothing is so valuable that we should be willing to sacrifice everything else to
protect it. This is to say that other values may sometimes outweigh the disvalue of
diminished autonomy. At the extreme, massive violations of autonomy (even of
adult patients) may be permitted to prevent people from significant risks of serious
harms. For example, coercive quarantine may be justified to control ongoing
outbreaks of deadly diseases. And if we accept a principle of proportionality, then
we should think it is ethically permissible to use less autonomy-undermining means
(e.g., manipulative nudges) even to promote less valuable goods than ending
ongoing outbreaks of deadly diseases. In particular, I will argue that the goods
generated by vaccination may justify the use of autonomy-undermining pediatric
vaccination nudges.

 Nudging for the Sake of the Vaccinated Child
Physicians have a moral reason to act in ways that promote their patients’ interests.
This is especially true when a physician’s patients are children, who rely on others
to promote their interests. Routine vaccination is usually in a child’s interests.
Therefore, physicians have a moral reason to act in ways that cause their child
patients to become vaccinated. If nudges make it more likely that parents will
choose to vaccinate their children, then it follows that physicians have a moral
reason to nudge parents to choose to vaccinate their children. But do considerations
about children’s interests justify vaccination nudges?
There are two ways to affirm that a child’s interests in vaccination could justify
pediatric vaccination nudges that undermine parental autonomy. First, advocates of
pediatric vaccination nudges could claim that parental autonomy is valuable only
instrumentally, for the promotion of children’s interests. This is a common way to
account for the moral value of parental autonomy in healthcare decision making,
e.g., Birchley (2016), and the AAP Committee on Bioethics seems to have endorsed
this account in a 1995 statement (AAP Committee on Bioethics 1995). (In contrast,
a 2016 AAP statement appears to embrace a broader account of the moral value of
autonomous parental decision-making (Katz et al. 2016).) If parental autonomy is
valuable only because it promotes children’s interests, then parental autonomy is not
morally valuable when it leads to vaccine refusal, on the assumption that routine
vaccination is in children’s interests. Therefore, even if pediatric vaccination nudges
undermine parental autonomy, it follows that these infringements on parental
autonomy are not a moral loss. And the moral case for autonomy-undermining
pediatric vaccination nudges could therefore be easily made, since these nudges
would realize great benefits while imposing no moral costs.
I think this account is largely correct, though it conceives of the value of parental
autonomy in pediatric decision-making too narrowly. There are other reasons to
care about parental autonomy, i.e., other than because of its usefulness in promoting
children’s interests. Parental autonomy is also good for parents, for parent–child
relationships, and for the family (Brighouse and Swift 2014; Nelson and Nelson
2014). A parent’s life may go better—and her relationships with her children and
her spouse may be stronger—if she is empowered to make decisions about her
children’s healthcare. So, if pediatric vaccination nudges undermine parental
autonomy, they may sacrifice something of moral value, even on the assumption
that vaccination is good for children. Therefore, someone who defends autonomy-
undermining pediatric vaccination nudges has the responsibility to show that the
benefits of these nudges outweigh the costs. This should not be a difficult a task,
since it seems doubtful that one-off interventions in the pediatrician’s office will
undermine parental autonomy in ways that jeopardize the goods that parental
autonomy provides to parents and the family. Vaccination nudges seem unlikely to
undermine the intimacy and spontaneity that parental autonomy contributes to
family life. For example, vaccination decision-making seems unrelated to decisions
about which bedtime stories to read or which sports to encourage children to play.
Therefore, even if autonomy-undermining pediatric vaccination nudges impose real
HEC Forum
123
 moral costs on parents and the family, these costs may be negligible and therefore
easily outweighed.
Importantly, we should not defer to parents’ beliefs about the value of parental
autonomy, the value of childhood vaccination, or the relationship between these
values. Parental convictions are insufficient to establish the moral worth of parental
autonomy or (the moral weight of) their children’s interests (Dawson 2005). Even if
we endorse a subjective account of value (which I do not), it seems clear that the
relevant subjects also include the (un)vaccinated child and other members of the
community, in addition to the parents. So, the mere fact that particular parents may
think that it is especially important for them to make autonomous decisions about
their children’s healthcare—even at a cost to their children’s well-being—does not
make it so.
The negligible moral costs of autonomy-undermining pediatric vaccination
nudges seem to be outweighed by the benefits of childhood vaccination to the
vaccinated child. But completing this argument in specific cases requires more
information. On one hand, we need evidence about the benefits of particular
vaccines for particular children. Most vaccines promote the interests of most
children, but there are important exceptions. For example, some vaccines (on
standard schedules) may not promote some children’s interests at all, e.g., hepatitis
B vaccine given to hours-old infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers (Conis 2015).
And among the vaccines that do promote a child’s interests, they do so to different
degrees; chicken pox is not polio. Furthermore, most vaccines will do more to
promote a child’s interests when herd immunity is vulnerable or non-existent than
they will when herd immunity is robust.
On the other hand, we will need more evidence about whether (and how)
particular nudges undermine parental autonomy. I take myself to have shown that
parental autonomy in pediatric decision-making is not especially valuable, aside
from its ability to promote the interests of the child. But even if my argument is less
successful than I have supposed, we may conclude that autonomy-undermining
pediatric vaccination nudges are more likely to be ethically justified if they do less
to undermine parental autonomy. For example, if a particular pediatric vaccination
nudge causes only minimal infringement on parental autonomy, but will do a great
deal to promote a vaccinated child’s interests, then it seems more likely that the
interests of the vaccinated child will suffice to ethically justify this nudge. In
contrast, if another pediatric vaccination nudge causes significant infringement on
parental autonomy, but does not do much to promote the vaccinated child’s
interests, then it seems less likely that the interests of the vaccinated child will
suffice to ethically justify this nudge.
Before moving on, it may be helpful to clarify that I have not provided a general
defense of autonomy-undermining paternalistic nudges, in healthcare contexts or
otherwise. My arguments apply only to nudges that target parental decision-making
(and, therefore, may undermine parental autonomy). This is because autonomous
parental decision-making has little moral value when it does not promote the
interests of the child. So, if my arguments in this section have broader
consequences, those include only cases in which parents are nudged to promote
HEC Forum
123
 the well-being of their children, e.g., daycare centers or hospitals using nudges to
encourage parents to practice proper car seat installation.
Nudging for the Sake of Others
Vaccination decisions have consequences for other people, since unvaccinated
children are at greater risk of infecting others. Do other people’s interests in
avoiding infection provide physicians with a moral reason to nudge parents to
vaccinate their children?
It seems clear that other people’s interests may affect how a physician treats their
patients (or their patient’s parents). For example, physicians are morally permitted
(even morally obligated) to support quarantine during outbreaks for patients who are
asymptomatic carriers, based on the community’s interest in avoiding infection.
More generally, a physician has a moral reason to practice medicine in ways that do
not place other people at an avoidable risk of significant harms. This includes
protecting other patients from the risks that vaccine refusers impose on them (Block
2015). (Consider that the 2008 San Diego measles outbreak began when an
unvaccinated child—of vaccine refusers—infected other children in a physician’s
waiting room (Sugerman et al. 2010).) And the same responsibility that gives
physicians a reason to protect other patients from becoming infected in the clinic
waiting room also gives physicians a reason to protect non-patients from becoming
infected in the elevator of the office building in which the clinic is located, or in
classrooms at the local school.
The pressing question is whether (and when) other people’s interests in avoiding
infection trump parental autonomy in decisions about childhood vaccinations. In the
previous section, I argued that parental autonomy has negligible moral value when it
is exercised in ways that impose costs on a child. This is because the chief reason to
value parental autonomy is for its usefulness in promoting children’s interests. In
contrast, the fact that parental autonomy fails to promote the interests of other
people is often insufficient to justify infringements on parental autonomy. (Of
course, in the case of pediatric vaccination, the interests of both the vaccinated child
and other people are relevant. The point of this section is to identify whether the
interests of other people provide additional reasons for autonomy-undermining
pediatric nudges, beyond the reasons grounded in the interests of the vaccinated
child.)
The mere fact that pediatric vaccination nudges could reduce the chance that
someone else will be infected is not enough to ethically justify infringements on
parental autonomy. Parents are generally free to make many choices that impose
risks of harms on other people. For example, if parents drive their children to
school, even when they could have walked them to campus, they thereby impose an
avoidable risk of serious harms on pedestrians and other motorists. I assume most
people think parents have a moral right to make this sort of choice about how to
transport their children. Also, I assume many people would object to autonomy-
undermining efforts to increase the number of parents who walk their children to
school, even if these efforts would make pedestrians and motorists safer.
HEC Forum
123
 But there are limits to the (risks of) harms that one person’s parenting choices
may impose on another person. In particular, a parent does not have a moral right to
impose significant risks of serious harms on other people. (They are not entitled, for
example, to let their children shoot guns in their suburban backyards (Flanigan
2014).) But many instances of vaccine refusal do not impose this kind of risk on
other people. For example, tetanus is not contagious, so refusing tetanus vaccine
does not impose any risks on others. For another example, human papillomavirus
(HPV) and hepatitis B are usually transmitted through sexual activity or intravenous
drug use, such that refusing vaccines against these diseases does not impose risks on
others in the way that refusing a vaccine for an airborne disease imposes risks
(Luyten et al. 2014; Malm 2015). Furthermore, when vaccination rates are high—
and herd immunity is robust—an individual parent can refuse any number of
vaccines without imposing significant risks of serious harms on others (Diekema
and American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics 2005). In these cases,
pediatric vaccination nudges will gain support from considerations of other people’s
interests only if those nudges cause at most minimal infringements on parental
autonomy.
In contrast, when vaccination rates are relatively low, or when vaccine refusal is
geographically-clustered (even in the face of high overall vaccination rates), vaccine
refusal may impose significant risks of serious harms (Lieu et al. 2015; May and
Silverman 2003). In these cases, the interests of other people are likely to lend
greater support to pediatric vaccination nudges that undermine autonomy.
Nudging for the Sake of Fairness
Some people object to vaccine refusal on the grounds that it is unfair (Chervenak
et al. 2015; Spier 1998). They think that parents who do not vaccinate their children
may take advantage of the community’s protection from disease (herd immunity)
without contributing to that protection. I am sympathetic with the claim that vaccine
refusal can be unfair (Navin 2013a), but I do not think that this consideration tells in
favor of autonomy-undermining pediatric vaccination nudges.
Fairness is a distinct moral consideration. It does not reduce to a commitment to
harm prevention, since there are harmless ways to take uncompensated advantage.
For example, assume that it can sometimes be unfair to avoid paying taxes. But if
one person unfairly avoids taxes to save a small amount of money (e.g., $100), this
unfair act is extremely unlikely to harm any individual person who relies on federal
government programs, since the shortfall represents an infinitesimally small
percentage of the federal budget. Likewise, a single instance of vaccine refusal
may be relatively harmless when herd immunity is robust, but it may still be unfair,
since the unvaccinated child may take uncompensated advantage of the herd
immunity that others have created (Dawson 2007; van den Hoven 2012). Does a
commitment to avoid this sort of (potentially harmless) unfairness count in favor of
pediatric vaccination nudges, as some (e.g., Buttenheim and Asch 2013) have
suggested?
HEC Forum
123
 I do not think that considerations of fairness contribute to the case for autonomy-
undermining pediatric vaccination nudges. Herd immunity is a political project. It is
a valuable goal at which state and national governments have dedicated billions of
dollars over many decades. If we have a duty of fairness to contribute to herd
immunity, then it is because political morality requires that we make fair
contributions to (some) valuable political projects that our governments have
pursued (Navin 2015). And if physicians have a moral reason to nudge people to
make fair contributions to herd immunity, it is because physicians have a moral
reason to nudge people to fulfill the requirements of political morality.
This sort of argument seems unlikely to succeed. First, members of a society may
not have a political duty to contribute to (all of) the valuable public projects pursued
by their governments. In the absence of explicit consent, the mere fact that one’s
government has chosen to pursue a valuable program may not generate a duty to
contribute (Nozick 1974).
But even if citizens have a duty to make fair contributions to the valuable projects
pursued by their governments, it seems unlikely that physicians have a moral reason
to treat their interactions with patients (or their parents) as a way to enforce this
political duty. The physician-patient relationship is not fundamentally a political
relationship. And it is inconsistent with the ethos of the professional relationships
that physicians have with their patients for physicians to treat patients as instruments
for promoting political projects. To be clear: it is part of a physician’s professional
responsibilities to practice medicine in ways that are not harmful to members of the
community, as the previous section discusses. But a professional obligation to
practice socially responsible medicine stops short of a duty to enforce fair
contributions to essentially political projects.
Consider another example of a political project that citizens may have moral
reasons of fairness to support: national defense. Physicians should not nudge
patients to join the military, even if members of society have a moral duty to join the
military (or otherwise support national defense). If anyone has the right to wield
autonomy-undermining power to promote national defense, it is representatives of
the state (who are accountable to the people they govern), and not private actors
acting on personal initiative. So, to return to the case of vaccination, public health
officials and school district representatives might be morally entitled to use a
combination of coercion and nudges to incline parents to vaccinate their children for
the sake of promoting fair contributions to herd immunity (Constable et al. 2014;
Verweij and van den Hoven 2012). However, it would be wrong for physicians to
undermine parental autonomy in pediatric decision-making for the sake of
promoting a fairer distribution of the costs of herd immunity.
But perhaps vaccination blurs boundaries that are clear in other cases. Even if
there is generally a well-defined divide between professional and political
relationships—and even if relationships between parents and their children’s
physicians are usually professional relationships—interactions surrounding vacci-
nation may avoid easy categorization. For example, public health officials
incentivize providers to vaccinate their patients in order to meet political

 school or daycare vaccine mandates. Interactions between physicians and their
patients’ parents about vaccination therefore take place against the background of
ongoing political projects that aim at promoting herd immunity. Does this give
physicians moral permission to undermine parental autonomy to promote herd
immunity?
No. It is fallacious to reason from the fact that physician-patient interactions take
place against the background of political efforts to promote herd immunity to the
conclusion that physicians have a moral right to treat their interactions with patients
as a means for promoting herd immunity. Participants in a system often have good
reasons not to act to promote the goals of the system. Consider the relationship
between a criminal defendant and her attorney, which takes place against the
background of a system that aims at convicting and sentencing (only) guilty people.
Suppose a criminal defense attorney is justifiably convinced that her client is guilty,
even though her client is very likely to be acquitted if the attorney adequately
defends her. Does the fact that the attorney-client relationship takes place against
the background of a system that aims to convict (only) the guilty give the attorney a
moral right to nudge her client to confess? No. While the broader system aims to
convict the guilty, a defense attorney has a professional obligation to defend her
client, rather than aim at the conviction of guilty people. Much the same can be said
about physician-patient interactions when it comes to vaccination. Even if it is
correct to characterize these interactions as part of a (political) system that aims at
promoting herd immunity, it does not follow that physicians may undermine
parental autonomy to promote fair contributions to herd immunity. In particular,
doing so would violate a physician’s professional duties.
Conclusion
I have argued that autonomy-undermining pediatric vaccination nudges may be
ethically justified, and that they are more likely to be ethically justified than other
autonomy-undermining healthcare nudges. This is because the moral value of
parental autonomy is negligible when it is exercised in ways that fail to promote the
interests of the child, and because a child’s interests in being vaccinated are likely to
be sufficiently weighty to compensate for the limited moral costs impose on parents.
Also, vaccination promotes the interests of other people, and interests of other
people in avoiding infection may also sometimes be weighty enough to compensate
for infringements on parental autonomy caused by pediatric vaccination nudges.
The arguments in this paper outline a defense of autonomy-undermining pediatric
vaccination nudges, but we need much more information to flesh out these
arguments. For example, additional empirical research will tell us more about how
particular nudges can promote vaccine compliance. Here, Opel et al.’s research on
the effectiveness of default nudges points us in the right direction.
We also need to learn more about the longer-term consequences of pediatric
vaccination nudges. For example, we know that parents do not expect physicians to
nudge them, but instead anticipate open-ended discussions with physicians about
vaccines (Benin et al. 2006). If dissatisfied parents are more likely to refuse vaccines

 in future office visits, then this is a reason not to use pediatric vaccination nudges.
Also, we may wonder whether parents will place less trust in physicians if they
discover that physicians are nudging them. On this point, some have worried that
nudges and other persuasive techniques may ‘‘lead to parents avoiding future
vaccinations if they felt their trust in the physician had been violated’’(Shaw and
Elger 2013, 1690). There is good evidence that breakdowns in trusting relationships
between physicians and parents contribute to vaccine refusal (Larson et al. 2011;
Navin 2013b). It would be ironic if pediatric vaccination nudges were ultimately
counterproductive because they undermined parental trust in physicians. So, we
should hope that future research will shine light on the longer-term consequences of
pediatric vaccination nudges for parent-physician relationships.
Finally, there is good reason for the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop
guidelines for the use of nudges in pediatric practice and, in particular, for the use of
pediatric vaccination nudges. This article began with the observation that many
physicians disregard AAP guidelines about dismissing vaccine refusers. It closes
with a call for the AAP to provide guidance to physicians who are considering using
nudges to promote vaccine compliance among the vaccine hesitant (and vaccine
refusing) parents who they have allowed to remain in their practices.
