IMPORTANCE Despite increased focus on reducing opioid prescribing for long-term pain, little
is known regarding the incidence and risk factors for persistent opioid use after surgery.
OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of new persistent opioid use after minor and major
surgical procedures.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using a nationwide insurance claims data set from 2013
to 2014, we identified US adults aged 18 to 64 years without opioid use in the year prior to
surgery (ie, no opioid prescription fulfillments from 12 months to 1 month prior to the
procedure). For patients filling a perioperative opioid prescription, we calculated the
incidence of persistent opioid use for more than 90 days among opioid-naive patients after
both minor surgical procedures (ie, varicose vein removal, laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
laparoscopic appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, thyroidectomy, transurethral prostate
surgery, parathyroidectomy, and carpal tunnel) and major surgical procedures (ie, ventral
incisional hernia repair, colectomy, reflux surgery, bariatric surgery, and hysterectomy). We
then assessed data for patient-level predictors of persistent opioid use.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was defined a priori prior to data
extraction. The primary outcome was new persistent opioid use, which was defined as an
opioid prescription fulfillment between 90 and 180 days after the surgical procedure.
RESULTS A total of 36 177 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 29 068 (80.3%) receiving
minor surgical procedures and 7109 (19.7%) receiving major procedures. The cohort had a
mean (SD) age of 44.6 (11.9) years and was predominately female (23 913 [66.1%]) and white
(26 091 [72.1%]). The rates of new persistent opioid use were similar between the 2 groups,
ranging from 5.9% to 6.5%. By comparison, the incidence in the nonoperative control cohort
was only 0.4%. Risk factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use
included preoperative tobacco use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.21-1.49), alcohol
and substance abuse disorders (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.72), mood disorders (aOR, 1.15; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.30), anxiety (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), and preoperative pain disorders (back
pain: aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.42-1.75; neck pain: aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.07-1.39; arthritis: aOR, 1.56;
95% CI, 1.40-1.73; and centralized pain: aOR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE New persistent opioid use after surgery is common and is not
significantly different between minor and major surgical procedures but rather associated
with behavioral and pain disorders. This suggests its use is not due to surgical pain but
addressable patient-level predictors. New persistent opioid use represents a common but
previously underappreciated surgical complication that warrants increased awareness.

 M
illions of Americans undergo surgery each year, with
expenditures exceeding $500 billion and account-
ing for approximately 40% of national health care
spending.1-6 Although 2016 guidelines from the US Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) address opioid prescribing with re-
spect to long-term pain, little attention is directed toward peri-
operative outpatient opioid prescribing.7-9 Currently, postop-
erative opioid prescribing varies widely and frequently in
excess,10-12 even following minor surgical procedures. More
broadly, nearly 530 individuals die each week in the United
States due to opioid overdose, demanding comprehensive so-
lutions for this public health crisis.13-15
Many patients receive their first exposure to opioids fol-
lowing surgery, but the incidence of new persistent opioid use
after surgical care is not well defined. Specifically, the effect
of surgical case mix and other preoperative risk factors re-
main unclear. In a population-based study of insured indi-
vidualsintheUnitedStates,weexaminedtheincidenceofnew
persistent opioid use and associated risk factors across those
receiving both minor and major surgical procedures. We hy-
pothesized that the incidence of new persistent opioid use
would be common and similar between the groups undergo-
ing minor and major surgical procedures, thereby suggesting
that persistent opioid use may be less associated with post-
surgical pain than addressable patient-level factors.
Methods
Data Sources and Patient Cohort
The Clinformatics Data Mart captures administrative health
claims across the United States for members of a large national
managed care company affiliated with OptumInsight. We ex-
amined claims from January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2015, among
adults aged 18 to 64 years to capture data on surgical proce-
dures performed between 2013 and 2014 to account for the 12-
month preoperative and 6-month postoperative study period.
Weincludedonlyindividualswithcontinuousmedicalandpre-
scriptiondrugcoveragetoevaluatethecompletehealthcareex-
perience. We excluded patients 18 years and younger as well as
patients older than 64 years owing to the incomplete capture
of Medicare Part D prescriptions claims data. The study was
deemed exempt from review by the University of Michigan In-
stitutional Review Board, and informed consent was waived
because the dataset was deidentified.
We selected 13 common elective surgical procedures and
categorized these into minor and major groups based on prior
literature. Minor surgical procedures included varicose vein
removal, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appen-
dectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, thyroidectomy, transurethral
prostate surgery, parathyroidectomy, and carpal tunnel. Ma-
jor surgical procedures included ventral incisional hernia re-
pair, colectomy, reflux surgery, bariatric surgery, and hyster-
ectomy. We identified patients undergoing surgery using
Current Procedural Terminology or International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9)
procedure codes (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Wesoughttodeterminenewpersistentopioiduseaftersur-
gery and included only patients who filled an opioid prescrip-
tion either in the month prior to surgery or within 2 weeks
after discharge. Comparable with previous studies of opioid-
naive surgical populations,7,8 patients who had filled 1 or more
prescriptions for opioids 12 months to 31 days prior to their sur-
gical procedure were excluded from the analysis (Figure 1). To
account for prescriptions provided preoperatively for postop-
erative pain control, patients filling opioids in the 30 days prior
to surgery were included, and prescriptions filled in this time
was included as a covariate in the analyses. Last, we ex-
cluded patients who underwent additional surgical proce-
dures during the study period using subsequent procedural
codes for anesthesia in the 6-month postoperative period.
For a comparison cohort of patients who did not undergo
surgery, we identified a random 10% sample of patients aged
18 to 64 years who did not undergo surgery in the study pe-
riod (n = 492 177 patients). We included only patients in the
nonoperativegroupwhodidnotfillanopioidprescriptiondur-
ing a 12-month period and did not have any codes for surgical
Key Points
Question What is the incidence of new persistent opioid use after
surgery?
Findings In this population-based study of 36 177 surgical
patients, the incidence of new persistent opioid use after surgical
procedures was 5.9% to 6.5% and did not differ between major
and minor surgical procedures.
Meaning New persistent opioid use is more common than
previously reported and can be considered one of the most
common complications after elective surgery.

12 months before the procedure through the 6 months after; (2) no opioid
prescriptions during the 11 months before the procedure; and (3) at least
1 opioid prescription fulfillment during the perioperative period, which was
defined as the 30 days before the procedure to 2 weeks after discharge. The
outcome of new persistent opioid use was defined as at least 1 opioid
prescription fulfillment between 90 and 180 days after the procedure.

 procedures or anesthesia during this period. These patients
were then given a random date of surgery. No patients filled
an opioid prescription in the year prior to their fictitious sur-
gery date nor did they have any anesthesia codes in the
6 months following their fictitious surgery date.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was new persistent opioid use, defined
as an opioid prescription fulfillment between 90 and 180 days
among those patients who filled opioid prescriptions peri-
operatively (Figure 1) and was defined a priori prior to data
extraction.8 This definition of new persistent opioid use rep-
resents a time in which normal surgical recovery would be ex-
pected for the procedures selected and is more conservative
than the 3-month definition of long-term postsurgical pain by
the International Association for the Study of Pain.16 The total
amount of opioids prescribed during the surgical window of
30 days before surgery to 14 days after discharge, including the
dose of the medication and amount dispensed, were con-
verted to oral morphine equivalents (OMEs).17
Patient Factors
We included sociodemographic and clinical covariates, includ-
ing region of residence, and comorbid conditions using both
a Charlson Comorbidity Index score and an indicator of cur-
rent or previous tobacco use (ICD-9 code 305.1; V15.82). In ad-
dition, the Clinical Classification System from the Agency of
Healthcare Research and Quality was used to create indica-
torsformentalhealthdiagnoses.Thesubcategoriesofthemen-
tal health diagnoses by the Clinical Classification System were
collapsedasmooddisorders(ie,adjustment,anxiety,andmood
disorders), suicidality (ie, suicide and intentional self-
inflicted injury), disruptive behavior disorders (ie, attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct and disruptive behav-
ior disorders, and impulse control disorders), personality dis-
orders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, sub-
stance use disorders (ie, alcohol and other substance-related
disorders),andmiscellaneousdisorders(eTable2intheSupple-
ment). In addition, preoperative pain diagnoses were ob-
tained using ICD-9 codes (eTable 3 in the Supplement) and cat-
egorized as back pain, neck pain, arthritis pain, and other pain
disorders. The inclusion for preoperative medical comorbidi-
ties, pain diagnoses, and mental health classifications were re-
stricted to the 1-year preoperative study period.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.1 (Stata-
Corp). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic
variables and comorbidities for each surgical type. Univariate
differences between surgical types were assessed with t tests
or χ2 tests. Further, univariate differences between those with
persistent opioid use and those without persistent opioid use
withineachsurgicaltypewereassessedwithttestsandχ2tests.
A multilevel, multivariate logistic regression model, with US
Census Bureau geographic region included as a random inter-
cept, was estimated to examine differences in persistent opi-
oid use between surgical types while controlling for patient
characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,
history of tobacco use, mental health disorders, Charlson Co-
morbidity Index, pain disorders, and opioid prescription OME
within the surgical time frame. P values were 2-tailed, and
significance was set at P < .05.
Results
A total of 55 359 of the patients met the inclusion criteria of at
least 11 months without an opioid prescription prior to the 30
days preceding a qualifying surgical procedure (Figure 2). Af-
ter excluding patients receiving an additional anesthetic dur-
ingthe180-daypostoperativestudyperiod,withinpatientstays
greater than 30 days, and with no opioid prescriptions during
the perioperative period, the final study cohort consisted of
36 177 patients. There were 29 068 patients (80.3%) who re-
ceived minor surgical procedures and 7109 (19.7%) who re-
ceived major procedures.
Descriptive data are displayed in Table 1. There were no
differences between the groups with respect to opioid pre-
scriptionsinthe30dayspriortosurgery.Themediantotaldose
of all opioid prescriptions during the 30 days before surgery
to 14 days after discharge was 225 mg OMEs for both groups,
which equates to 45 tablets of 5-mg hydrocodone or 30 tab-
lets of 5-mg oxycodone.
Persistent Postoperative Opioid Use
in Major and Minor Surgery Groups
The incidence of new persistent opioid use was similar be-
tween the 2 groups (Figure 3). In the minor surgery group, 1711
patients (5.9%) filled an opioid prescription between 90 and
180 days vs 465 (6.5%) in the major surgery group (odds ratio,
1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24). By comparison, only 1779 (0.4%) in the
nonsurgical comparison group filled an opioid prescription be-
tween 90 to 180 days after the fictitious surgery date. We did
observe a small degree of variation with respect to the inci-
dence of new persistent opioid use across procedures, rang-
ing from 4.5% to 9.9%. After adjusting for all of the preopera-
tive covariates assessed, the small difference between the
groups was no longer statistically significant (adjusted odds

 ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93-1.18; P = .48) (Table 2). The mean (SD)
number of prescriptions was 1.4 (0.9), with a mean (SD) of 53
(105.3) pills. Of those filling an opioid prescription between 90
and 180 days after surgery, the mean (SD) number of opioid
prescriptions in the study period was 3.3 (2.0) with a mean (SD)
of 125 (200.4) pills.
Risk Factors for New Persistent Opioid Use
In this cohort, tobacco use, alcohol and substance abuse dis-
orders, and comorbid conditions increased the risk of new per-
sistent opioid use among opioid-naive patients, regardless of
surgical procedure (Table 2). In addition, anxiety, depres-
sion, and other preoperative pain disorders (ie, back pain, neck
pain, arthritis, and centralized pain conditions) were indepen-
dentlyassociatedwithcontinuedpostoperativeopioiduse.Pa-
tients receiving an opioid prescription in the 30 days before
surgery had almost 2-fold higher odds of persistent opioid use
after surgery, even after adjustment for other covariates. While
there was a significant association between those patients re-
ceiving the most opioids in the perioperative period (300 mg
OMEorhigher)andnewpersistentuse,theeffectsizewasfairly
small (adjusted OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.27).
In the mixed-effects model of the US Census Bureau re-
gions(Table2),theWestSouthCentral(incidence = 7.02%)and
East South Central (incidence = 7.85%) regions were indepen-
dently associated with higher rates of new persistent opioid
use, while the Middle Atlantic region (incidence = 3.78%) was
independently associated with a lower incidence of new per-
sistent opioid use.
Discussion
In this study of a large cohort of privately insured patients in
the United States, 6% of patients undergoing both minor and
major surgical procedures continued to use opioids after 90
days after surgery. Rates of prolonged use were similar be-
tween those who underwent minor and major procedures, and
patientswithagreaternumberofcomorbidities,includingpain
conditions,substanceabuse,andmentalhealthdisorders,were
particularlyvulnerabletoprolongedopioiduse(Table2).Given
the declining rates of morbidity and mortality following com-
mon elective surgical procedures, new persistent opioid use
represents an important, common, and underrecognized com-
plication of perioperative care.2,4-6
Approximately 50 million ambulatory surgical proce-
dures were performed in the United States in 201018; thus, our
findingssuggestthatmorethan2millionindividualsmaytran-
sition to persistent opioid use following elective, ambulatory
surgery each year. When including inpatient surgical proce-
dures and considering the growth in surgical care in the United
States, the number may be much higher. As such, our find-
ings suggest that more than 2 million individuals may transi-
tion to persistent opioid use following elective surgery each
year.TheseresultsarealignedwithreportspublishedbyClarke
et al8 and Alam et al7 describing prolonged postoperative opi-
oid use among a population-based sample of Canadians 65

 years and older. Clarke et al8 examined opioid use among all
patients who filled an opioid prescription within 90 days af-
ter surgery, and Alam et al7 did not require an opioid prescrip-
tion after surgery for inclusion. In contrast, we specifically in-
cluded patients who only filled prescriptions during the
immediateperioperativeprocedureandexcludedpatientswho
receivedadditionalanesthesia(andpresumablyadditionalpro-
cedures) after the index procedure. Our cohort represents the
direct transition from postoperative use to persistent use more
than 3 months after surgery among patients who are opioid na-
ive. Our results are also comparable with the 5% incidence of
new long-term opioids use after the first opioid exposure using
data from the Oregon prescription drug monitoring program,
which includes nonoperative opioid prescriptions.19
More recently, Sun et al20 described a lower incidence
(0.119%-1.41%) following a variety of surgical conditions using
a definition of more than 10 opioid prescription fulfillments
or more than 120 days supplied between 3 and 12 months af-
ter surgery. While this definition identifies those patients fill-
ing large amounts of opioids, it may underestimate the inci-
dence of new persistent opioid use and captures only the far
extreme of opioid consumption. Surgical recovery would be
expected well before the 90-day to 180-day outcome period
used in the study, and any opioid use in this period is consid-
eredalong-termissueandinappropriateinapreviouslyopioid-
free cohort.
Persistent Use May Not Be Related to Surgical Pain
Our findings also highlight that prolonged opioid use follow-
ing surgery may not simply be a consequence of poorly con-
trolled pain. The pain experienced after major procedures
would be expected to be greater than for minor procedures,

 which could be more likely to result in continued opioid use
for long periods. However, we observed that new persistent
opioid use did not differ between major and minor proce-
dures. Aligned with our previous work, patients likely con-
tinue opioids for reasons other than intensity of surgical pain.
For example, approximately 4% of patients undergoing total
hip replacement and 8% undergoing knee arthroplasty who
were not taking opioids before surgery continued to use opi-
oids 6 months after surgery.9 More interestingly, the change
in the surgical knee or hip pain intensity from prior to surgery
to 6 months after surgery was unrelated to new persistent opi-
oid use.
Long-term postsurgical pain has received considerable at-
tentioninrecentyears,21butthereasonsforwhichpatientscon-
tinue to use opioids after surgery are complex and not simply
due to surgical pain. Unfortunately, opioids have been termed
painkillers despite the fact that their long-term benefit with
respect to pain relief has not been demonstrated.9,22-25 More-
over,becauseopioidsareprescribedmedications,patientsmay
overestimate their safety and use opioids intended for post-
surgical pain for other symptoms, such as back and neck pain,
headaches, osteoarthritis, and insomnia, for which opioids are
noteffective.22-24Previousstudieshavealsodemonstratedthat
psychiatric conditions, such as depression, are associated with
long-term opioid use, and patients may continue to use their
postoperative opioids to treat emotional pain and affective
distress.26-31 Regional variation was also found, with higher
rates of new persistent opioid use in the East and West South
Central United States.
CDC Guidelines Fail to Address
Postoperative Prescribing
Despite the sharp focus on the opioid epidemic following the
release of the CDC Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for
Chronic Pain,15,25,32,33 there has been little attention placed on
postoperative prescribing. The omission of postoperative pre-
scribing guidelines was appropriate in many ways, as the data
presented in the present study, to our knowledge, are among
the first to quantify the very serious scope of the problem, and
little is known regarding the variation in opioid consumption
following surgery. However, even with these data, the rea-
sons for which patients continue to use their opioids remain
unclear. Moreover, this study does not address the millions of
patients each year who receive excess opioids that often re-
main stored in an unsecure manner, thereby leading to poten-
tial diversion and abuse.34 While the CDC guidelines and an
increased attention on long-term outpatient management of
opioids has and will continue to decrease opioid prescribing,35
the effect of postoperative use on the opioid overdose epi-
demic has been less recognized. To our knowledge, there are
currently no normative data for postoperative opioid prescrib-
ing to guide practice, and as such, it has become an issue of
convenience and little attention has been placed on the po-
tential morbidity to follow.
Clinical Implications
Although opioids remain an integral part of acute postop-
erative pain management, the data do not support long-
term efficacy. In fact, many experts believe that the risks of
opioids far outweigh the potential benefits.22,24,25 As such,
new persistent opioid use after surgery represents a poor
long-term outcome and could be termed an adverse event.
Given that our cohort is largely made up of individuals
covered by employer-based plans and their dependents,
our findings further underscore the importance of pro-
longed postoperative opioid use among young individuals
during their prime years with respect to career and family
demands.
Althoughwenotedthatsomeproceduresappearedtohave
greater issues with persistent opioid use (eg, colectomy), we
believe that new persistent opioid use is inappropriate in most
cases. We acknowledge that the interventions may need to be
tailored to the condition in some cases, but there are cer-
tainly some aspects of patient and health care professional in-
terventions that are more generalizable.
Limitations
Despite the many strengths of this study, there are some
limitations. First, we did not capture actual opioid consump-
tion; however, the repeated opioid prescription fulfillments
(with an average of 3.3 prescription fills between 90 and 180
days) suggest that patients were continuing to use opioids.
Despite the fact that the cohort had not filled an opioid pre-
scription in the year prior to their procedures, it is possible
that the postoperative opioid prescriptions were related to
another procedure or diagnosis. To mitigate this risk, we
eliminated all patients with claims related to additional
anesthesia during the postoperative period. As was noted
above, the use of claims data does not allow for a granular
assessment of other painful conditions and mood disorders
(eg, degree of impairment or symptoms) that may be driving
persistent use. Prospective data are needed to better under-
stand the patient-level factors associated with new persis-
tent postoperative opioid use. In addition, our categorization
of major vs minor surgical conditions may be subject to cri-
tique, but the categories were created a priori and with guid-
ance from previous studies on this topic. Reclassifying some
of the procedures (eg, moving all laparoscopic procedures to
the minor surgery category) did not significantly change the
results (data not shown). Finally, our cohort was drawn from
a large, population-based cohort of insured adults and their
dependents, and our findings may not be generalizable to
the uninsured, underinsured, and individuals 65 years and
older.
Conclusions
In a cohort of previously opioid-naive patients, approxi-
mately 6% continued to use opioids more than 3 months af-
ter their surgery, and as such, prolonged opioid use can be
deemed the most common postsurgical complication. New
persistent opioid use is not different among patients who
underwent minor and major surgical procedures, thereby sug-
gesting that prolonged opioid use is not entirely due to surgi-
cal pain.
