The Japanese national immunization programme for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) started in 2010.  
Vaccination rates increased up to 70% in women in the 1996-1999 birth.  However, the proactive 
recommendation for HPV vaccine was suspended in 2013, following repeated media reports of adverse 
events.  Vaccination rates plumped to less than 1% in women born since 2002.  In this study, incidence of 
abnormal cytology and histology was examined in terms of HPV vaccination among 5,924 women aged 20 
to 24 years in the fiscal year (FY) 2014 and 2015.  The total rate of vaccination was 16.9% (1,002/5,924).  
In case of FY 2015, the rates of vaccination were 59.26%, 49.68%, 11.97%, 9.08%, and 4.58% in those 
aged 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 years old, respectively.  The rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(HSIL) or worse were 0.20% (2/1,002) in women with HPV vaccination and 1.14% (56/4,922) in those 
without HPV vaccination, indicating a significant reduction of 82.46% with vaccination (P < 0.0001). The 
rates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1+ were 0.80% (8/1,002) in women with vaccination and 
2.28% (112/4,922) in those without vaccination.  The reduction rate of CIN1+ was 64.91% (P = 0.0025).  
The rates of CIN2+ were 0.10% (1/1,002) with vaccination and 0.69% (34/4,922) without vaccination.  The 
reduction rate of CIN2+ was 85.51% (P = 0.0261).  Our data are the first to demonstrate a significant 
reduction of CIN2+ cases in an Asian population.  Scientific discussion is needed to restart the proactive 
recommendation for HPV vaccine in Japan.

Introduction
In Japan, governmental support for human papilloma-
virus (HPV) vaccination began in November 2010 for girls 
aged 12-16 years.  However, Japanese media started to 
report negatively on HPV vaccination due to problems such 
as chronic pain, and the proactive recommendation for vac-
cination was suspended in June 2013 (Morimoto et al. 
2015; Ueda et al. 2015; Hanley et al. 2015; Tanaka et al. 
2017).  The Vaccine Adverse Review Committee of the 
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) 
investigated adverse events in about 8,898,000 injections 
from 2010 to 2013.  Among 2,475 adverse events, there 
were 617 (6.9/100,000) severe cases and 176 (2.0/100,000) 
cases with chronic pain.  The adverse events of chronic pain 
were mainly functional disorders, rather than organic disor-
ders.  To date, the Japanese Government has not reinstated 
a proactive recommendation for use of HPV vaccine.  The 
risks of the vaccine are easily understood, whereas the mer-
its of the vaccine are not easily understood.
We reported the effects of HPV vaccine in Miyagi by 
investigating vaccination rates and the incidence of abnor-
mal cytology in the fiscal year (FY) 2014.  However, 
because of the limited number of the enrolled women, the 
 N. Ozawa et al.
330
effects of vaccine were not conclusive (Ozawa et al. 2016). 
Therefore, we examined the effects of HPV vaccine in 
Miyagi by investigating the incidence of abnormal cytology 
and histology in FY 2014-2015.
Subjects and Methods
The subjects were women aged 20 to 24 years who underwent 
uterine cervical cancer screening in Miyagi Prefecture in FY 2014-
2015 (April 2014-March 2016).  We asked each subject to report her 
history of vaccination in a questionnaire.  Cervical cytology, histol-
ogy and history of vaccination were examined using data of the 
Miyagi Cancer Society.  Statistical analysis was performed by χ2 test. 
Cytological evaluation was performed by the conventional method in 
about 70% of cases and using liquid based cytology in about 30% in 
Miyagi.
This study and questionnaire were discussed by the 
Gynecological Exam Committee of Miyagi Cancer Society and were 
approved by individual municipal governments.  The study was 
approved by the ethics committee of Miyagi Cancer Society 
(approved number 1508).
Results
There were 6,462 women aged 20 to 24 years who 
underwent uterine cervical cancer screening in Miyagi 
Prefecture in FY 2014-2015 (April 2014-March 2016).  The 
attendance rates for cervical cancer screening are very low, 
especially among women aged 20-24 years old.  Most cites 
in Miyagi support young women financially so that they 
can undergo cervical cancer screening in any year.  There 
were 538 women who underwent cervical cancer screening 
in both FY 2014 and 2015.  In this study, we analyzed 5,924 
women among a total 6,462 women, with exclusion of the 
538 women, to examine the rate of vaccination based on 
data per person.  There were 1,002 (16.9%) women who 
had received HPV vaccination among the 5,924 women. 
Importantly, there were no adverse events, such as chronic 
pain, among 1,002 women who were vaccinated in Miyagi.
In FY 2014, the overall vaccination rate was 10.08% 
(331/3,283) for women aged 20 to 24 years old, and the 
rates of vaccination were 42.26%, 9.71%, 14.60%, 3.82%, 
and 4.00% in those aged 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 years old, 
respectively (Table 1).  The rates in FY 2014 were recalcu-
lated from the data published in the earlier report (Ozawa et 
al. 2016).  In FY 2015, the overall vaccination rate was 
25.41% for women aged 20 to 24 years old, and the rates of 
vaccination were 59.26%, 49.68%, 11.97%, 9.08%, and 
4.58% in those aged 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 years old, 
respectively, with the exclusion of the 538 women (Table 1).
The vaccination rates based on year of birth were cal-
culated as follows; the sum of cases of 20 y.o. in FY 2014 
and cases of 21 y.o. in FY 2015 were supposed to be cases 
in FY 1994-93 birth.  Among the 5,924 women, the rates of 
vaccination were 59.26%, 47.80%, 10.40%, 11.02%, 
4.14%, and 4.00% in women born in FY 1995-94, 1994-93, 
1993-92, 1992-91, 1991-90 and 1990-89, respectively 
(Table 2).
In cytology, the rates of atypical squamous cells of 
undetermined significance (ASC-US) or worse were 1.90% 
(19/1,002) in women with HPV vaccination and 5.49% 
(270/4,922) in those without HPV vaccination.  The reduc-
tion rate was 65.39%.  This reduction rate was calculated as 
(5.49-1.90)/5.49 × 100% (Table 3).  Comparison of 
ASC-US or worse and NILM indicates that vaccination 
resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of ASC-US or 
worse (P < 0.0001) (Table 4).
The rates of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(HSIL) or worse were 0.20% (2/1,002) in women with vac-

The reduction rate was 82.46%.  This reduction rate was 
calculated as (1.14-0.20)/1.14 × 100% (Table 5).  We com-
pared HISL or wore cases and LSIL or better cases which 
included NILM, ASC-US, atypical squamous cells, cannot 
exclude HSIL (ASC-H), and LSIL.  Comparison of HSIL or 
worse and LSIL or better indicates that vaccination resulted 
in a significant decrease in the rate of HSIL or worse (P < 
0.0001) (Table 6).
In histology, there were 7 cases of cervical intraepithe-
lial neoplasia 1 (CIN1) and 1 case of CIN2 among women 
with vaccination.  There were 78 cases of CIN1, 25 cases 
CIN2, and 9 cases CIN3+ among women without vaccina-
tion.  Unknown cases include ASC-US cases with HPV 
negative (Table 7).
The rates of CIN1+ were 0.80% (8/1,002) in women 
with vaccination and 2.28% (112/4,922) in those without 
vaccination.  The reduction rates of CIN1+ was 64.91% (P 
= 0.0025).  This reduction rate was calculated as (2.28-
0.80)/2.28 × 100%.
The rates of CIN2+ were 0.10% (1/1,002) with vacci-
nation and 0.69% (34/4,922) without vaccination.  The 
reduction rates of CIN2+ was 85.51% (P = 0.0261).  This 
reduction rate was calculated as (0.69-0.10)/0.69 × 100%.
The rates of CIN3+ were 0% (0/1,002) with vaccina-
tion and 0.18% (9/4,922) without vaccination.  The reduc-
tion rates of CIN3+ was 100% (P = 0.3724, Fisher exact 
test).  This reduction rate was calculated as (0.18-0.00)/0.18 
× 100% (Table 8).
Discussion
The vaccination rates were 47.80% and 59.26% in 
women born in FY 1993-94 and 1994-95, respectively, in 
Miyagi.  The Japanese MHLW reported the vaccination 
rates of national immunization programme increased as fol-
lows, 42.2%, 54.2%, 81.1%, and 81.2% in women born in 
FY 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.  But the vac-
cination rates decreased as follows: 75.3%, 74.2%, 42,9%, 
6.1%, 0.7%, and 0.1% in women born in FY 1998, 1999, 
2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively (Sobue 2016). 
 
Further follow-up of HPV vaccination and cervical abnor-
malities is needed in Japan.
The results showed that the rates of ASC-US or worse 
decreased by 65.39% and the rates of HSIL or worse 
decreased by 82.46% in women who had undergone HPV 
vaccination.  The rates of CIN1+ were decreased by 64.91% 
and the rates of CIN2+ were decreased by 85.51%.  Our 
data are the first to demonstrate a significant decrease of

Several clinical trials have shown the effects of quadri-
valent HPV vaccine (Future II Study Group 2007) and biva-
lent HPV vaccine (Paavonen et al. 2009).  A study in 
Australia (Crowe et al. 2014) showed a 43% decrease of 
atypical cells and a 62% decrease of HSIL in women aged 
22-25 years with three vaccinations (after a lapse of 7 
years).  Similarly, a report in Denmark (Baldur-Felskov et 
al. 2014) on uterine cervical cancer screening for women 
aged 20-21 years showed that atypical cells, CIN2 and 
CIN3 decreased by about 60%, 73%, and 80%, respectively. 
A study in Scotland (Pollock et al. 2014) also showed that 
CIN3 decreased by about 55% after vaccination.  Our data 
are essentially similar to the findings in Australia, Demark 
and Scotland.
We hope that the Japanese MHLW makes a decision to 
restart the proactive recommendation for women aged 
12-16 years old as soon as possible, based on scientific dis-
cussion.  We recommend catch-up vaccination for non-vac-
cinated young women who were born since 2000.  We also 
recommend 9-valent (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) 
HPV vaccine which can protect against around 90% of cer-
vical cancer cases.  (Joura et al. 2015).  HPV16 and 18 are 
detected in about 65% of cases in Japan.  HPV52 and 58 
are detected more often in Japan than in Europe in cases of 
cervical cancer and CIN2-3 (Miura et al. 2006).
In 2017, the WHO Global Advisory Committee for 
Vaccine Safety concluded that the available evidence does 
not suggest any safety concern regarding the use of HPV 
vaccines.  In 2016, the Vaccine Adverse Effects Review 
Committee of the Japanese MHLW studied women aged 
12-18 years old in terms of symptoms such as chronic pain. 
 
The findings showed that 17.5/100,000 had several symp-
toms within 1 year after HPV vaccination, whereas this rate 
was 20.4/100,000 for women who did not receive HPV vac-
cination, with no significant difference between those who 
did and did not receive HPV vaccination (Sobue 2016). 
The same committee followed 156 cases of severe adverse 
events, and found that 73.7% (115/156) of these cases had 
recovered in 2016.  However, despite these findings, there 
is still a need to establish a system for diagnosis and treat-
ment of patients with adverse events after injection of HPV
