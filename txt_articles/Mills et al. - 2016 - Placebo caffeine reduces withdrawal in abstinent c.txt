Abstract 
Background: Expectancies have been shown to play a role in the withdrawal 
syndrome of many drugs of addiction. However no studies have examined the effects 
of expectancies across a broad range of caffeine withdrawal symptoms, including 
craving.  
Aims: The purpose of the current study was to use caffeine as a model to test the 
effect of expectancy on withdrawal symptoms, specifically whether the belief that one 
has ingested caffeine is sufficient to reduce caffeine withdrawal symptoms and 
cravings in abstinent caffeine drinkers. 
Methods 24-h abstinent regular coffee drinkers completed the Caffeine Withdrawal 
Symptom Questionnaire (CWSQ) before and after receiving decaffeinated coffee. 
Half the participants were led to believe the coffee was regular caffeinated coffee 
(Told  group) and half were told that it was decaffeinated (Low Expectancy group).  
Results: Participants in the High Expectancy group reported a significantly greater 
reduction in craving, fatigue, lack of alertness and flu-like feelings factors of the 
CWSQ than those in the Low Expectancy.  
Conclusions: These results indicate that the belief that one has consumed caffeine can 
affect caffeine withdrawal symptoms, especially craving, even when no caffeine has 
been consumed.

Introduction 
Numerous studies demonstrate that expectancies can affect the withdrawal symptoms 
of many addictive drugs (Colagiuri et al., 2009; Francis and Nelson, 1984; Gottlieb et al., 
1987; Juliano and Brandon, 2002; Phillips et al., 1986; Senay et al., 1977; Tyrer et al., 
1983). Caffeine is an addictive substance that is consumed by 80-90% of adults (Gilbert, 
1984; Ressig et al., 2009) and has a well-established withdrawal syndrome (American 
Psychiatric Association and American Psychiatric, 2013; Juliano and Griffiths, 2004). 
However, despite the ubiquity of caffeine use, no study to date has tested the effect of 
expectancies on the full range of caffeine withdrawal symptoms including cravings using 
an empirically verified caffeine withdrawal symptom questionnaire.  
The most commonly reported caffeine withdrawal symptoms are headache, fatigue or 
drowsiness, depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, decreased alertness, difficulty 
concentrating and flu-like symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or muscle pains/stiffness 
(Juliano and Griffiths, 2004). Craving, while not listed as a withdrawal symptom in any of 
the DSM-5 substance withdrawal disorders (APA, 2013), is nevertheless important for the 
study of any withdrawal syndrome since it is an index of motivation to consume a drug 
(Sayette et al., 2000) that spikes following abstinence and is cited as a common cause of 
relapse (Kozlowski and Wilkinson, 1987; Shiffman, 1979). 
In their review of caffeine withdrawal Dews, O’Brien, and Bergman (2002) propose 
two indirect lines of evidence suggesting that withdrawal from caffeine may be 
susceptible to the effect of expectancy.  First, studies have found that caffeine withdrawal 
is most pronounced for subjective symptoms, often in the absence of corresponding 
declines in objective performance (Lane and Phillips-Bute, 1998; Phillips-Bute and Lane, 
1997): Dews et al. (2002) argue that this dissociation indicates a negative expectancy 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 
effect. Second, they argue that the considerable variability in onset and incidence of 
caffeine withdrawal symptoms cannot be explained by the pure pharmacological effects 
of caffeine, and implicates psychological factors like expectancy. For example, estimates 
of prevalence of headache in abstinent caffeine users range from 9% (Hughes et al., 1995) 
to 100% (Naismith et al., 1970) and, in the individuals that experience headaches, there is 
considerable variance in peak onset, ranging from 27 to 51 hours of abstinence (Griffiths 
et al., 1990).  
Some evidence already supports these ideas. Instructions about the caffeine content of 
a beverage have been found to increase arousal and alertness (Flaten and Blumenthal, 
1999; Kirsch and Rosadino, 1993; Kirsch and Weixel, 1988; Lotshaw et al., 1996) and 
contentedness and calmness (Mikalsen et al., 2001) irrespective of actual caffeine content. 
This suggests that expectancy about receiving caffeine can induce positive effects. Yet it 
remains to be seen whether the negative components of caffeine withdrawal, such as 
headaches, negative mood, and fatigue, can be reversed by instruction about beverage 
caffeine content alone. Harrell and Juliano (2009) examined the effect of instruction on a 
range of caffeine withdrawal symptoms; however the instructions given to participants 
pertained to the effect of caffeine on motor performance rather than whether or not they 
had ingested caffeine. Other studies have found evidence that expectancies mediated 
abstinence-induced headache, however these studies contained methodological 
weaknesses such as omission of important statistical information and details of the type of 
random-allocation instructions given to participants (Rubin and Smith, 1999; Smith 
1996).  To our knowledge no studies have examined whether instructions concerning the 
caffeine content of a beverage can reverse or reduce withdrawal across a wide range of 
withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the primary aim of the current study was to test, using an 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
empirically validated caffeine withdrawal questionnaire, whether the expectancy of 
having consumed caffeine can reduce withdrawal following 24 hours of abstinence, and to 
determine which specific withdrawal symptoms are most sensitive to expectancy effects.   
A secondary aim of the study was to test whether information priming would 
influence the reported intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Written warnings about side-
effects have been shown to increase subsequent report of those side-effects (Neukirch and 
Colagiuri, 2013; Myers et al. 1987; Colagiuri et al., 2012). This study sought to explore 
whether written information about the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms could similarly 
increase caffeine withdrawal, by priming half of participants with a warning about 
commonly experienced caffeine withdrawal symptoms.  
 
Method 
Design 
The study used a 2 x 2 x (2) mixed design, as shown in Figure 1. The first factor was 
Priming, where participants were either given information suggesting that abstaining from 
caffeine could lead to substantial withdrawal symptoms (Prime group) or were not given 
this information (No Prime group). The second factor was Expectancy, where participants 
were given decaffeinated coffee and were either told that it was caffeinated (Told Caffeine 
group) or decaffeinated (Told Decaf group). The third factor was Time, either pre-coffee 
ingestion (pre-beverage) or post-coffee ingestion (post-beverage). The primary outcome of 
interest was self-reported caffeine withdrawal symptoms, however blood-pressure readings 
and a test of concentration were also performed and recorded at both time points.

Participants 
Participants were 89 (60 female) adult (mean age: 21.3; range 18-45) moderate to 
heavy coffee drinkers (≥ 3 cups per weekday) studying at the University of Sydney and 
participating in exchange for either course credit (n=84) or for $30 payment. All 
participants gave informed consent to participate in a study on the effect of caffeine on 
cognitive performance and were fully debriefed at the conclusion of the study that the true 
purpose of the study was to understand the effect of expectancy on withdrawal symptoms.  
A desired sample size of 20 per group (40 per main-effect group) was determined by 
consulting published studies examining caffeine placebo effects that had observed 
moderate to high effects sizes for outcomes equivalent to caffeine withdrawal (e.g. the 
Alertness and Tension variables in Kirsch and Weixel, 1988).  
[Figure 1 near here; Caption for figure 1 below] 
 
Fig 1. Design of study. The Prime group were given a written prime in their Participant 
Information Statement suggesting that the they were likely to experience withdrawal symptoms. 
The No Prime group received no prime. The Told Caffeine group were told they were receiving 
caffeinated coffee. The Told Decaf group were told truthfully that they were receiving 
decaffeinated coffee. Pre- and post-beverage tests were, in order: 1) Blood Pressure; 2) CWSQ; 3) 
RVIP task.  
 
Materials and Measures 
Demographic and Caffeine Use Questionnaire: Participants’ demographic information 
and daily caffeine use across all beverages was ascertained via a computerised 
questionnaire (see supplementary materials ESM1). Estimates of caffeine content of 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
beverages were obtained from Barone and Roberts (1996) or from content listed by the 
manufacturer. 
Drinks: Coffee was prepared in a DeLonghi Magnifica Automatic Coffee Machine 
using Peet’s Major Dickason’s Blend Decaffeinated coffee beans. These beans contain 
approximately 4% of the caffeine content of regular caffeinated coffee beans, amounting 
to 4mg or less of caffeine per cup.  
Caffeine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire: A computerised version of the Caffeine 
Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire (CWSQ; Juliano et al., 2012) was used to assess 
withdrawal symptoms The 32-items comprising this version of the CWSQ are arranged in 
nine separate factors: Drowsiness/Fatigue; Decreased Alertness/Difficulty Concentrating; 
Mood Disturbances; Decreased Sociability/Motivation to Work; Nausea/Upset Stomach; 
Flu-like Feelings; Headache, Acute Caffeine Effects, and Craving. Participants were 
asked to rate to what extent they were experiencing each symptom on a 5-item response 
scale from 0 (‘not at all’) to 4 (‘extremely’). The maximum possible score was 128. For a 
full list of items see supplementary materials ESM2.  
RVIP task: In order to disguise the true purpose of the study participants were given a 
version of the Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task, a test of sustained 
attention used by Colagiuri and Boakes (2010). In this 5-min task participants were 
required to monitor single digits appearing on a screen in semi-random order and to detect 
strings of three consecutive odd or three consecutive even digits amongst the random 
digits. Performance on the test was measured via hit rate, false-alarm rate, reaction time, 
and a composite accuracy score.  
Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured via an Omron 
HEM-7221 electronic sphygmomanometer.

Exit Questionnaire/Manipulation Check: A computerised exit questionnaire probed 
participants for awareness of the manipulation and their estimate of the caffeine content of 
the coffee they received (see supplementary materials ESM 5.)  
 
Procedure 
To reduce the possibility of demand characteristics, participants were recruited under 
the guise of a study testing the effects of caffeine on cognitive performance. Participants 
signed up for the study by booking a test session on the University of Sydney’s research 
participation website. Upon signing up participants were randomly allocated to either the 
Prime or No Prime condition. The priming manipulation was administered via a 
Participant Information Statement (PIS) sent to participants by email. In the email 
participants were instructed to read the PIS carefully prior to the test session.  The PISs 
sent to the Prime and No Prime group were identical, except that those given the prime 
contained the additional text:  
“IMPORTANT: Because caffeine withdrawal symptoms become stronger 
over time it is likely that you will experience some withdrawal symptoms 
due to abstaining from coffee. These withdrawal symptoms can include 
headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depression, flu-like 
feelings, nausea, upset stomach, and cravings. If any of these withdrawal 
symptoms become too severe please contact the researchers.”  
See ESM3 and ESM4 for both versions of the PIS. 
Participants were told in advertisements for the study, in the initial contact email, and 
on the PIS sent out with the contact email, that they must drink more than three cups of 
coffee on a standard weekday and be 24-h caffeine abstinent in order to be included in the 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
study. Using a ‘bogus pipeline’ procedure to enhance compliance with the 24-h 
abstinence requirement (Murray et al., 1987), participants were told in the email and PIS 
that abstinence would be verified upon arrival via a saliva test.  
Participants were tested individually in a single 90-min test session. Prior to this 
session they were allocated to either Told Caffeine or Told Decaf conditions. In order to 
screen out participants who did not meet inclusion criteria, participants were asked upon 
arrival at the test session how many cups of coffee a day they drank and when they last 
consumed caffeine. If participants answered less than three cups per day or less than 24 h 
since last caffeine consumed they were not tested. 
Participants meeting eligibility criteria had saliva samples collected, and the 
demographic and caffeine use questionnaire was administered. All questionnaires were 
completed on computers in the test lab during the 90-min test session. Following the 
demographic and caffeine use questionnaire participants had their blood pressure 
measured, and took the RVIP and CWSQ tests for the first time. Next, participants were 
given their cup of coffee, which was prepared in front of them in the test room. All 
participants received decaffeinated coffee. Beans used to make participants’ coffee were 
placed in the test room prior to participants’ arrival according to group allocation; either in 
original packaging or in decoy packaging of a popular (caffeinated) blend sold by Gloria 
Jean’s coffee chain. During preparation of the coffee, participants in the Told Decaf group 
were instructed that they had been allocated to a control condition of the study and would 
therefore receive decaffeinated coffee. The Told Caffeine group on the other hand were 
not given any further instructions, since all participants had been led to believe that they 
would be receiving caffeinated coffee as part of the general study description. Participants 
then consumed their coffee, after which they were allowed a 45-min ‘caffeine absorption

11 
period’ in which they remained in the lab but were free to study, browse the internet, or 
use their smartphones. Following the ‘absorption period’ participants had their blood 
pressure read and took the RVIP and CWSQ tests a second time. Finally, participants were 
given the exit questionnaire and debriefed as to the true nature of the study.  
All the procedures in this study were approved by the University of Sydney Human 
Research Ethics committee and were conducted in accordance with the 1964 declaration 
of Helsinki. 
Results 
Caffeine Use 
Mean caffeine consumption per weekday from all sources (e.g. coffee, tea, cola) was 
554.1 mg (SD=295.8). Coffee was the most commonly consumed caffeinated product. A 
two-way ANOVA revealed no significant between-group differences in daily caffeine 
consumption (Priming: F(1,88) = 0.21, p=.647; Expectancy: (F(1,88) = 1.07, p=.304). 
Effect of Expectancy 
2 x 2 x (2) ANCOVAs, with Priming and Expectancy as the between-subjects factors 
and Time (pre- vs post-Beverage) as the within-subject factor, were conducted on CWSQ 
scores, blood-pressure, and RVIP scores. Eight participants from the Told Caffeine group 
and seven Participants from the Told Decaf group whose belief in the caffeine content of 
their beverage was incongruent with their instructions were excluded from analysis, 
leaving 37 in each group (N = 74). The exclusion of these participants did not affect the 
overall pattern of significant results.

Fig. 2 Effect of expectancy before and after decaffeinated coffee, on total reported caffeine 
withdrawal symptoms (Left) and on cravings (Right). Higher scores indicate more severe 
withdrawal. All participants received deccafeinated coffee. The Told Caffeine group were told 
their coffee contained caffeine whereas the Told Decaf group were told theirs was decaffeinated.  
 
There was a significant interaction between Expectancy and Time in total CWSQ 
scores (F(1,69) = 8.36, p=.005, η2=.108), with the Told Caffeine group reporting a 
reduction of 14.6 points from pre- to post-beverage, compared to a 5.5-point reduction in 
the Told Decaf group. Figure 2 shows graphs of both mean Total CWSQ scores and 
CWSQ-Craving factor scores pre- and post-beverage according to Expectancy group 
allocation. There was no effect of Expectancy on blood pressure or any of the RVIP 
measures.  
Between-group means pre- to post-beverage, F- and p-values and effect size estimates 
for total CWSQ scores and the nine CWSQ factors are reported in Table 2. Of the nine 
CWSQ factors, four showed significant interactions between Expectancy and Time, with 
significantly greater post-beverage reductions in Craving (F(1,69) = 22.53, p<.001, 
η2=.246), Decreased Alertness/Difficulty Concentrating (F(1,69) = 8.29, p=.005, η2=.107), 
Drowsiness/Fatigue (F(1,69) = 4.64, p=.035, η2=.063) and Flu-like feelings (F(1,69) = 4.22, 
p=.044, η2=.058) observed in the Told Caffeine group than the Told Decaf group.

Effect of Priming and Time 
There were significant main effects of Time, with CWSQ scores (F(1,69) = 15.73, 
p<.001), systolic blood pressure (F(1,69) = 15.80, p<.001), and RVIP False Alarm Rate 
(F(1,69) = 21.40, p<.001) decreasing, and RVIP Hit Rate (F(1,69) = 4.91, p=.016), and RVIP 
Accuracy scores (F(1,69) = 12.72, p=.001) increasing significantly across all groups from 
pre- to post-beverage.  
     There was no significant main effect of Priming on CWSQ scores nor any of the other 
dependent variables. Nor were any significant two-way interactions observed between 
Priming and Time or Priming and Expectancy. There were no significant three-way 
interactions between Priming, Time, and Expectancy. 
 
Belief About Beverage Caffeine Content 
In the exit questionnaire participants rated the likelihood that their beverage contained 
caffeine. Responses were coded as follows: ‘Certainly Caffeinated’ (7); ‘Probably’ 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
Caffeinated’ (6); ‘Possibly Caffeinated’ (5); ‘Don't Know’ (4); ‘Possibly Decaffeinated’ 
(3); ‘Probably Decaffeinated’ (2); ‘Certainly Decaffeinated’ (1). A simple linear 
regression was performed to test the extent to which these beliefs predicted change in 
overall CWSQ scores (i.e., pre-beverage CWSQ – post-beverage CWSQ; with higher 
scores indicating a greater reduction in reported withdrawal symptoms) and cravings 
specifically. Since all participants, regardless of instruction, indicated some estimate of 
the likelihood that their beverage was caffeinated, the regression was conducted using all  
89 participants.  The strength of belief that the beverage was caffeinated significantly 
predicted the magnitude of the reduction in both total CWSQ score (R2 =.047, 
F(1,87)=4.282, b = 8.175, SEb = 3.95,  p=.041) and for craving (R2 =.087, F(1,87)=8.241, b = 
0.36, SEb = 0.13,  p=.005). This meant that for every 1-point increase in participants’ 
estimates of likelihood that there was caffeine in their beverage, there was a predicted 
1.39-point decrease in their post-beverage total withdrawal score and a 0.36-point 
decrease in their craving score.  
 
Discussion 
The results of this study demonstrate that caffeine withdrawal symptoms can be 
reduced by the simple belief that caffeine has been ingested, even when it has not. 
Participants who were led to believe that they were receiving caffeinated coffee showed a 
significantly greater reduction in total CWSQ scores following consumption of their 
beverage than those who were told that they had consumed decaf.  Supporting this, 
participants’ ratings of the likelihood that their beverage contained caffeine were 
positively correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in CWSQ scores.

Our novel symptom-by-symptom analysis indicated that four specific symptom 
clusters were susceptible to alteration by expectancy, namely Craving, Decreased 
Alertness/Difficulty Concentrating, Drowsiness/Fatigue, and Flu-like Feelings. It is 
particularly noteworthy that cravings for caffeine were significantly reduced by 
administration of placebo caffeine. This suggests that the belief that one has ingested 
caffeine is sufficient to reduce not only unpleasant withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue 
and diminished alertness, but also the motivation to consume caffeine. Previous research 
examining the effects of expectancy on cravings for other addictive substances, such as 
tobacco, has shown mixed results, with some studies finding expectancy-induced 
reductions in cravings (Darredeau and Barrett, 2010; Juliano and Brandon, 2002) and 
others finding no effects of expectancy (Gottlieb et al., 1987; Hughes et al., 1989; Tate et 
al., 1994). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that expectancy alone 
can reduce cravings in abstinent caffeine users.  
The findings for Drowsiness/Fatigue and Decreased Alertness/Difficulty Concentrating 
are consistent with other studies specifically targeting these symptoms, that have shown 
that abstinent caffeine users who believe they have ingested caffeine feel more alert and 
less fatigued (Flaten and Blumenthal, 1999; Kirsch and Rosadino, 1993; Kirsch and 
Weixel, 1988; Lotshaw et al., 1996). In contrast, other caffeine withdrawal symptoms, 
such as nausea, headache, and mood factors were not significantly influenced by the 
expectancy manipulation in the current study. This suggests that, in the context of caffeine 
withdrawal symptoms, sensations such as alertness, fatigue and craving are more 
susceptible to the type of top-down alteration of perception by expectancy that is thought 
to be involved in some placebo effects (Brown et al., 2008; Wall, 1993) than are 
sensations such as nausea, headache, and mood. It should be noted that nausea (see Quinn 
 PLACEBO CAFFEINE REDUCES WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
and Colagiuri 2015) and mood (Dinnerstein and Halm, 1970) have been shown to be 
susceptible to manipulation by instruction in non-caffeine-related studies, therefore an 
alternative explanation is that these symptoms may take longer than 45 min to reverse than 
the symptoms that did show significant changes.  
Like all withdrawal syndromes caffeine withdrawal is not a unitary phenomenon but is 
rather a cluster of symptoms across multiple modalities (e.g. cognitive, affective, 
somatic). Thus, it is not surprising that some clusters may be more affected by expectancy 
than others. Even within the affected symptoms there was some variation in the 
effectiveness of the expectancy manipulation, with a very large effect size for Cravings 
(η2=.246), a large effect size for Decreased Alertness/Difficulty Concentrating (η2=.107), 
and moderate effect sizes for Drowsiness/Fatigue (η2=.063) and Flu-like Feelings 
(η2=.058). By comparison, the effect size for Mood, which was not significantly changed 
by expectancy, was extremely small (Mood: η2=.002). It was interesting that Headache, 
which is generally the most robust and commonly reported of the caffeine withdrawal 
symptoms (Juliano & Griffiths, 2004), was not significantly affected by expectancy, with 
a small numerical change from 1.97 pre-beverage to 1.57 post-beverage out of 8. There is 
evidence that headaches due to caffeine withdrawal do not peak until 27-51 h after 
abstinence (Griffiths et al. 1990). Therefore, it is possible that the 24-hr abstinence period 
used in the current study created a floor effect in the sense that headaches prior to the 
intervention were already too low to be significantly reduced by the expectancy 
manipulation. 
The finding that Time caused decreases in withdrawal irrespective of group allocation 
was interesting considering that one would expect participants in the Told Decaf groups, 
who knew their abstinence would continue because they were drinking decaf, to report an

increase in withdrawal between pre- and post-beverage. A possible explanation is that 
contextual cues relating to the taste, touch, and smell of coffee elicited conditioned 
withdrawal-reduction effects despite participants knowing they were receiving no caffeine. 
It was also interesting to note that the written prime included in the Participant 
Information Statement did not appear to have any effect on reported pre-beverage 
withdrawal symptoms. It is possible that this was due to caffeine consumers being 
sufficiently well aware of the negative consequences of abstinence that a simple written 
prime had no effect on their expectancies (Rohsenow and Marlatt, 1981). However, given 
that a number of participants booked and attended the test session without having fully 
read even the prerequisites for admission to the study, it is possible simply that many 
failed to read the prime. Thus, it would be interesting to explore other priming  
manipulations that involve a more salient prime in future.  
This study found that that expectancy-induced withdrawal reduction effects can persist 
for 45 min, a duration similar to that required for peak caffeine absorption from coffee (42 
min: Liguori et al., 1997). This is well past the duration of placebo-induced increases in 
alertness of 15-20 min observed in previous studies (Kirsch and Weixel, 1988; Kirsch and 
Rosadino, 1993). Future research should further extend the period of time between 
administration of placebo caffeine and measurement of withdrawal symptoms in order to 
determine the durability of these expectancy effects. 
The current study had several potential limitations. First, the study was single-blind 
only, which can result in increased demand characteristics. Second, since there was no 
objective test of abstinence from caffeine, confirmation that participants abstained from 
caffeine for 24 hours prior to testing relied on self-report. This could result in either under- 
or overreporting of symptoms due to biases such as social desirability. Third, there was no

measure of the pre-existing expectancies held by participants concerning withdrawal 
symptoms, which may have interacted with the priming and expectancy manipulations. In 
future research, a caffeine expectancy questionnaire such as the CaffEQ (Huntley and 
Juliano, 2012) could be administered to address this. Fourth, average daily consumption of 
participants in this study (554mg) was relatively high compared with the average US 
population (280mg; Barone and Roberts). Thus it is possible that both the withdrawal and 
the expectancy effects observed in this study were more pronounced than they would be in 
a sample whose consumption was lower. However participants in Griffiths et al. (1990) 
displayed marked withdrawal symptoms despite their daily caffeine consumption being 
considerably lower that the American average. Thus the effects of expectancy may occur 
irrespective of average consumption as long as the level of use leads to at least some 
withdrawal symptoms, although this needs to be tested. Lastly although the sample size for 
this study was based on sample sizes used by previous studies that found caffeine 
expectancy effects for withdrawal-related phenomena (e.g. Kirsch and Weixel, 1988) 
formal power analyses were not conducted. 
Overall, the current study indicates that a number of caffeine withdrawal symptoms 
can be reduced by expectancy, namely craving, decreased alertness/difficulty 
concentrating, drowsiness/fatigue and flu-like feelings. These findings add to the growing 
body of research indicating that in addition to known pharmacological factors, 
expectancies concerning current levels of a drug in the body also play a significant role in 
the way individuals addicted to that drug perceive their withdrawal symptoms. Caffeine 
Withdrawal Syndrome has been added to list of substance use disorders in the most recent 
edition of the DSM (APA, 2013). These results suggest that expectancy-based 
interventions intended to reduce or eliminate drug intake may serve as a useful adjunct to

existing interventions, both for caffeine use specifically, and for other substance use 
disorders.
