Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological malignancy that relies on drug combinations for first and
secondary lines of treatment. The inclusion of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, into these combina-
tion regimens has improved median survival. Resistance to bortezomib, however, is a common occurrence that
ultimately contributes to treatment failure, and there remains a need to identify improved drug combinations.
We developed the quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) to optimize treatment combinations
selected from a candidate pool of 114 approved drugs. QPOP uses quadratic surfaces to model the biological
effects of drug combinations to identify effective drug combinations without reference to molecular mecha-
nisms or predetermined drug synergy data. Applying QPOP to bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines
determined the drug combinations that collectively optimized treatment efficacy. We found that these combi-
nations acted by reversing the DNA methylation and tumor suppressor silencing that often occur after acquired
bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma. Successive application of QPOP on a xenograft mouse model fur-
ther optimized the dosages of each drug within a given combination while minimizing overall toxicity in vivo,
and application of QPOP to ex vivo multiple myeloma patient samples optimized drug combinations in patient-
specific contexts.
INTRODUCTION
Advances in omics tools have led to a greater understanding of the
complexity of diseases such as cancer, in which large networks of mo-
lecular interactions contribute to both disease progression and thera-
peutic resistance (1). Inhibition of a single pathway is typically not
sufficient to effectively treat such diseases; hence, disrupting multiple
pathways through combination therapy may possibly be more effective.
Combination therapy approaches have been particularly prevalent in
cancer research, with 25.6% of oncology clinical trials from 2008 to
2013 involving the study of combination therapies, whereas only
6.9% of non-oncology trials involved combinations (2). Many cancers,
however, remain incurable and continue to require the development of
further lines of treatment for use after patient relapse. One such in-
curable malignancy is multiple myeloma (MM), which is characterized
by malignantproliferativeplasmacellsandhasamedian overallsurvival
rate of about 8 years despite advances in targeted therapy that have led
to incremental improvements in survival rates (3, 4). The development
of effective secondary lines of treatment for relapsed and refractory MM
patients is particularly important after treatment with the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib (Bort), which is present in 58% of clinically used
drug combinations (5). Clinical studies of Bort-containing combina-
tions have shown overall response rates as high as 93% in newly diag-
nosed patients (6), and the introduction of Bort into MM treatment
regimens, particularly in upfront first-line treatment options, has
increased relative survival rates at 5 years (7). However, as a result of
various intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of resistance to Bort, relapse
is inevitable for most MM patients (8). Thus, identifying effective drug
combinations against Bort-resistant MM may lead to the development
of improved secondary lines of treatment in the context of refractory or
relapsed MM after Bort treatment.
The rational design of drug combinations remains a challenge be-
cause of the complex molecular networks that contribute to feedback
mechanisms of drug resistance and compensatory oncogenic drivers
that limit the efficacy of targeted inhibitors (9, 10). Genomics-based
cancer drug combination development has identified oncogene-specific
synthetic lethality targets or used genomic profiling to identify biomar-
kers that predict enhanced sensitivity to targeted therapies (11). Rather
than using a rationally optimized drug combination design, these tar-
geted therapies are often paired with traditional chemotherapy or added
to existing combination therapies (12, 13). Network modeling algo-
rithms and pairwise combination predictive algorithms have sought
to rationally identify drug combinations by pairing systematic
combinatorial experimentation with an understanding of key biological
processes (14–16). Although these methods are effective in identifying
synergistic drug combinations, they do not identify the true global op-
timum among a set of drugs and can be reliant on an incomplete
understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, drug

 dosages and synergy need to be reoptimized at each stage of develop-
ment because combinations identified as synergistic in vitro may not be
effective in vivo (17, 18). A recent clinical study has shown that drug
synergy can be both dose- and time-dependent, which can further con-
found drug development (19). The need to simultaneously address both
drug selection and dosages creates a virtually infinite parameter search
space that is insurmountable using conventional approaches such as
dose escalation or synergy prediction. To identify the optimal drug
combination and drug dosage ratios within a set of nine drugs over a
range of three concentrations, traditional high-throughput screening
methods would have to test 39 or 19,683 combinations, making this ap-
proach prohibitively expensive and virtually impossible to complete in
vivo. Recent advances in evolution-guided dosing algorithms can opti-
mize drug dosages over a prolonged period, including in vivo, for
increased therapeutic efficacy (20, 21). Current versions of this ap-
proach, however, are limited to optimization of a single drug and do
not take into account the multiple time, dose, and subject-specific drug
interactions that may exist within drug combinations. Pairwise combi-
nation predictive algorithms are also incapable of optimizing drug dos-
ages for maximal efficacy while minimizing toxicity.
To overcome these challenges, we developed a quadratic phenotypic
optimization platform (QPOP) that is able to identify from a pool of
possible drug candidates, without reference to mechanism, the drug
composition and doses that collectively mediate the best possible treat-
ment outcomes. The foundation of QPOP is the discovery that the re-
sponse of biological systems to therapeutic intervention can be
represented by smooth parabolic surfaces, via second-order polynomial
equations (22). Studies across a wide range of biological applications
have suggested that a parabolic surface derived from second-order poly-
nomial equations can accurately identify globally optimal drug combi-
nation parameters (22–26). Furthermore, the importance of first- and
second-order terms in determining parabolic surfaces of therapeutic re-
sponses extends from cells to preclinical models to humans and can be
used to optimize drug dosage ratios in the clinical setting (19, 27, 28).
We hypothesized that mapping a parabolic quadratic surface toward a
set of drug responses might be able to optimize both the drugs that com-
prise the combinations and their respective dosages through continuous
optimization across the preclinical drug development pipeline. Whereas
conventional optimization approaches such as network modeling algo-
rithms are dependent on predetermined synergies, QPOP does not re-
quire this information to globally optimize drug combinations. Here, we
used QPOP against Bort-resistant MM to optimize combinations of
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs against
Bort-resistant MM in vitro and to reoptimize drug dosage ratios in vivo
to minimize systemic toxicity while maintaining drug combination
efficacy. We tested optimized drug combinations in a preclinical animal
model of Bort-resistant MM and against a range of MM primary patient
samples. Our approach revealed the potential for implicitly synergistic
tumor suppressor gene reactivation by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)
inhibitors and interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agents to effectively treat
Bort-resistant MM.
RESULTS
Quadratic phenotypic drug combination optimization
against Bort-resistant MM
We designed QPOP to optimize drug combinations in three stages. At
stage 1, drug combinations (inputs) were administered to systems of
interest ranging from cells grown in vitro to tumor-bearing mice (29).
Upon completionof the drug treatments, the correspondingphenotypic
readoutssuchascellviability andthe overallsurvivalof mice were quan-
tified in stage 2. Because the relationship between the administered
drugs and the quantifiable phenotypic responses can be determined
by a second-order algebraic equation, a quadratic smooth drug response
surface is seen when system response is plotted against drug doses (22).
Using this approach, a set of drug-dose combinations can be used to
describe the system response as a quadratic function (Eq. 1). Because
the quadratic function coefficients of the parabolic surface maps are
derived from changes in system response following the input of specific
drug-dose combinations, QPOP can use these maps to identify optimal
drug-dose combinations that are based on experimentally derived data.
We first identified candidate drugs that may be effective against
Bort-resistant MM using the Bort-resistant cell line RPMI 8226
(P100v), which exhibited a 70.2 times higher half-maximal growth in-
hibitory concentration (IC50) and a noticeable reduction in aggresome
formation compared to the parental RPMI 8226 cell line after treatment
with Bort (Fig. 1A). One hundred fourteen FDA-approved oncology
drugs were screened on RPMI 8226 and P100v cell lines at 1 and
5 mM (Fig. 1B). Using a cutoff of less than 0.6 of the normalized via-
bility in both P100v and RPMI 8226 cell lines, dactinomycin (Dac)
(30), decitabine (Dec), mechlorethamine hydrochloride (Mech) (31),
and mitomycin C (MitoC) were chosen as candidate drugs among in-
hibitors that demonstrated greater sensitivity toward the Bort-resistant
cell line (Fig. 1, C and D, and tables S1 and S2). Dose-response curves
were used to identify and compare the IC50 of the candidate drugs be-
tween both cell lines to validate these hits (Fig. 1E).
We sought to identify optimaldrug combinations froma set of drugs
that included these candidate drugs as well as 10 FDA-approved drugs
clinically used in MM therapy (5). We carried out a 14-drug, two-
dosage QPOP analysis consisting of 128 combinations, where the two
dosages corresponded to different concentrations used (tables S3 and
S4). Drug combinations were determined using a method that has been
shown to be the least number of combinations required for factor
screening and in-depth analyses (29). Drug treatments were evaluated
in P100v and a normal epithelial control cell line, THLE-2, to distin-
guish drug combinations that maximized the killing of Bort-resistant
MM cells while minimizing the effect on normal control cells (table
S5). Thus, we defined the output as the normalized viability of P100v
subtracted from the normalized viability of THLE-2. We then revised
our investigation to nine drugs at three dosages consisting of 155 com-
binations (tables S6 to S8). In this analysis, the top 10 ranked QPOP-
optimized two-drug combinations included Bort, Mech, Dec, or MitoC.
The top-ranked two-drug combinations were Dec/MitoC followed by
Bort/Mech (table S9), whereas Dec/MitoC/Mech was top-ranked for
three-drug combinations (table S10). Top-ranked drug combinations
were deemed to have synergistic interactions when predicted therapeu-
tic output increased as the concentrations of the drugs both increased
(Fig. 2A). QPOP analysis also revealed antagonistic interactions within
current clinical drug combinations used against MM, such as Bort with
dexamethasone (Dex) as well as Bort with panobinostat (Pano), because
increasing the concentrations of the drugs resulted in a decreased
output (Fig. 2B). The R2 of the above QPOP analysis was 0.803 (table
S8), indicating the close proximity of the data points to the QPOP linear
regression analysis. To validate these results, we treated P100v cells with
optimized and nonoptimal drug combinations identified by QPOP
analysis, including the clinically approved three-drug combination of
Bort, Pano, and Dex (D5). The optimized drug combinations (D2,
D3, and D4) repressed the viability of P100v cells compared to the

 nonoptimal drug combinations (D1 and D5; fig. S1). We calculated
the combination index (CI) via the Chou-Talalay method after the op-
timization to determine whether drug combinations were synergistic
(CI < 1), additive (CI = 1), or antagonistic (CI > 1) (32). We confirmed
synergistic interactions (CI < 1) for all three top-ranked drug combi-
nations (D2, D3, and D4), whereas both nonoptimal drug combina-
tions exhibited antagonistic interactions with CIs > 1 (fig. S1). These
data confirm that although QPOP does not use predetermined syner-
gistic or antagonistic interactions in identifying optimal drug combi-
nations, top-ranked combinations were synergistic, whereas previously
unknown antagonistic interactions contributed to lower ranks in the
QPOP analysis.
To further validate QPOP-optimized drug combinations, we
determined the IC50 of these drugs, either as monotherapies or drug
combinations, in vitro. When Bort and Mech were administered con-
currently, there was a marked shift in the dose-response curve, and the
IC50 of the drug combination decreased compared to when drugs were
administered alone (Fig. 2C). Although Mech IC50 only saw a moderate
reduction from 9.47 ± 0.832 mM to 7.29 ± 1.52 mM, Bort IC50 was sig-
nificantly reduced from 12.2 ± 2.66 mM to 0.433 ± 0.173 mM (P <
0.0001). This observation suggests that the efficacy of this top-ranked
drug combination is likely due to the increase in efficacy of Bort in a
Bort-resistant MM cell line. For the Dec/MitoC combination, both
Dec and MitoC saw marked reductions in IC50 values (Fig. 2D). For
Dec, IC50 was significantly reduced from 41.5 ± 8.64 mM to 0.120 ±
0.211 mM (P < 0.0001). For MitoC, IC50 was significantly reduced from
7.52 ± 2.43 mM to 0.0420 ± 0.00366 mM (P < 0.0001). The combination
of these two drugs contributed to a strong synergistic increase in efficacy
as evidenced by a CIIC50 of 0.331. For Dec, Mech, and MitoC, significant
reductions in IC50 of Dec (P < 0.0001) and Mech (P < 0.0001)
contributed to increased efficacy and a CIIC50 of 0.739 (Fig. 2E). Al-
though Pano/Bort/Dex has been approved for use in the clinic for
relapsed and refractory MM, this combination was confirmed to
be antagonistic on the Bort-resistant P100v cells with a CIIC50 of
11.0 (Fig. 2F) (33). This three-drug combination reduced the efficacy
of Pano, with IC50 increasing from 0.0790 ± 0.0888 mM to 0.862 ±
0.304 mM compared to other cell types. We also compared the IC50
derived from P100v cells earlier to the IC50 obtained when these drug
combinations were administered on a normal epithelial cell line,
THLE-2, or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). For both single-drug
and combination drug treatments, the IC50 obtained for both THLE-2
and MSC was higher than the IC50 derived from the P100v cells (fig. S2).
For instance, the IC50 of Bort in the dual combination was higher in
THLE-2 (5 mM) and MSC (1.35 mM), as compared to P100v (0.55 mM;
P = 0.0471 and 0.0369, respectively). The same trend was observed for
Mech (P = 0.00299 for THLE-2 and P = 0.00962 for MSC). These results
demonstrate the ability of the QPOP platform to optimize drug combi-
nations against Bort-resistant MM.
Clinical relevance and disease specificity of QPOP
drug combinations
Although QPOP was used to identify optimized drug combinations
specifically against Bort-resistant MM, the mechanisms by which
Bort resistance arises may be shared across the spectrum of hem-
atological malignancies (34). To investigate the effect of QPOP-
optimized drug combinations against other Bort-resistant cancers,
we evaluated the two top-ranked QPOP-optimized drug combinations
against Bort-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Similar to
the effects seen with the P100v line, optimized drug combinations had
markedly lower IC50 values compared to single-drug treatments and
corresponding CIIC50 values of less than 1 (figs. S3 and S4). Using
Bort-resistant CCRF-CEM cells (7 nM), there was a significant de-
crease in the IC50 of Dec when administered dual therapy (0.0570 mM)
compared to monotherapy (>100 mM) (P = 0.0221), whereas MitoC de-
creased from 6.70 to 0.0480 mM (P < 0.0001). For Bort, a significant
reduction from 11 to 0.150 mM (P = 0.0349) was observed, and for
Mech, IC50 decreased from 8.34 to 1.68 mM (P < 0.0001; fig. S3). Similar
patterns were also observed in CCRF-CEM cells (200 nM), a more
Bort-resistant cell line, where the IC50 of Dec (P = 0.0027), Bort (P <
0.0001), and Mech (P = 0.00770) decreased significantly, whereas
that of MitoC decreased from >50 to 0.0270 mM (fig. S4). These data
suggest that QPOP-optimized drug combinations against Bort-resistant
MM could also represent viable therapeutic options against other
Bort-resistant cancers.
We also examined top-ranked drug combinations ex vivo using
primary MM patient samples to evaluate the clinical relevance of
the QPOP drug combination optimization approach. The Bort/Mech
drug combination was found to be antagonistic (CIIC50 = 1) in a re-
lapsed patient sample, with the IC50 for Bort increasing from 0.00319
to 0.00729 mM (Fig. 2G), suggesting that this drug combination was
optimized specifically against highly Bort-resistant cancers and may
not be as effective against more Bort-sensitive MM cells. The Dec/
MitoC combination, however, resulted in a significantly lower IC50
compared to Dec (P < 0.0001) and MitoC (P < 0.0001) alone (Fig. 2H).
Because Dec/MitoC appeared to retain enhanced efficacy compared
to single-drug treatments, we evaluated additional samples from
both newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients. In all 13 patient
samples tested, the CIIC50 was less than 1 (Fig. 2I). These CIIC50 values
were influenced by reductions in IC50 for both Dec and MitoC in 8 of
13 of these patients (table S11), with many of these reductions in IC50
being orders of magnitude less. For instance, patient 11 had a signif-
icantly lower IC50, from 316 to 0.231 mM (P = 0.0001) for Dec and a
decrease from 1.90 to 0.298 mM for MitoC (P < 0.0001; table S11).
These results suggest that QPOP-based drug optimization identified
an epigenetic inhibitor-based drug combination where the increased
efficacy and implicitly synergistic interactions were retained across a
range of MM patients.
After ex vivo testing of Dec/MitoC in MM patient samples, we ex-
plored how Dec/MitoC interactions would be mapped onto quadratic
surfaces and how this combination compared to other drug combina-
tions tested on ex vivo patient samples. A six-drug, three-level QPOP
analysis was carried out across four newly diagnosed patient samples,
with the six-drug set comprising Dec, Bort, MitoC, Pano, Dex, and
melphalan (Melph; table S12). For all four patients, the combination of
Dec and MitoC displayed synergistic interactions in parabolic quadratic
surface plots (Table 1). Synergism was further confirmed by determin-
ing the IC50 of the drugs decreased in dual therapy as compared to
monotherapy (Table 1). The R2 values for all the ex vivo QPOP analysis
were>0.9, suggestingthe fidelityof the datato the linearregression anal-
ysis. Dec/MitoC emerged in the top 10 two-drug ranked combinations
for patient samples 1 (Table 2) and 2 (Table 3). Other drug combina-
tions, including clinically used combinations such as Bort/Pano/Dex
and Bort/Melph/Dex, were ranked higher than Dec/MitoC for patient
samples 3 (Table 4) and 4 (Table 5). For two of four naïve patient
samples, Dec/MitoC was identified as a potentially effective and
higher-ranked drug combination than two clinically used combina-
tions. For naïve patient samples 3 and 4, lack of previous patient expo-
sure to Bort likely contributed to a higher ranking for Bort-containing

 combinations. Although interpatient heterogeneity may limit the effec-
tiveness of any drug combination against the total cancer population, ex
vivo patient sample validation data suggested that Dec/MitoC is a drug
combination that may be effective toward a subset of MM patients, par-
ticularly Bort-resistant MM patients. Hence, we subsequently interro-
gated potential molecular mechanisms driving this drug combination.
Targeting DNA methylation in MM
Dec works by inhibiting DNMTs and promoting DNA hypomethyla-
tion (35). Previous studies have found that relapsed MM cases had
much higher amounts of global DNA methylation compared to mono-
clonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and newly diagnosed
MM cases (36). We observed that P100v cells had significantly higher
DNA methylation than the parental cell line (P = 0.00928), similar to
what we observed clinically in relapsed MM cases (Fig. 3A). Single- or
dual-drug treatment with Dec and MitoC reduced this DNA methyla-
tion, suggesting that increased global DNA methylation may be a
targetable feature of relapsed MM (Fig. 3B). We explored the genes
and regulatory pathways that were perturbed upon Dec and MitoC
treatment by measuring and analyzing changes in genomic methyl-
ation. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identified a clear
distinction between the Bort-sensitive and Bort-resistant cell lines
(Fig. 3C). Although the amount of global DNA methylation in the
treated Bort-resistant cell lines was not vastly different from that in
the untreated cell line, specific differences in DNA methylation
patterns between the treated samples showed that they were different
from each other. Volcano plots, in which the differences in mean
methylation were plotted against the significance of those differences,

 illustrate that majority of differentially methylated loci were hypo-
methylated for cells treated with 2.5 mM Dec. In addition, the com-
bination of 2.5 mM Dec and 5 mM MitoC also resulted in
hypomethylation as compared to the cells treated with 2.5 mM Dec
only (Fig. 3D). These differences were also mapped to DNA methyla-
tion probes (fig S5), which showed 2022 sites to be hypermethylated

with MitoC caused decreased methylation on 61 and 95 probes, respec-
tively, suggesting that changes in the DNA methylation pattern in
P100v could be one of the mechanisms of resistance to Bort.
Restoration of CDKN1A and PTPN6 transcripts upon dual
therapy of Dec and MitoC
We explored changes in gene expression after combination therapy.
Pathway analysis of RNA sequencing showed that Erb-B2 Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase 2 (ERBB2) signaling pathways were down-regulated
in P100v cells after treatment with Dec alone (table S13), whereas
p53-responsive pathways, particularly the p21 activation pathway, were
up-regulated in P100v cells treated with Dec and MitoC compared to
Dec treatment (table S14). The promoter of the tumor suppressor Src
homology region 2 domain–containing phosphatase-1 gene PTPN6,
which encodes a nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase that negatively reg-
ulates ERBB2 signaling, has been previously reported to be hyper-
methylated in MM (37). p53-independent long-term expression of
p21-encoding gene CDKN1A may contribute to enhanced genomic
instability during tumor progression, and p21 is a cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor that can drive cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition
and has been found to be a critical component of Bort-mediated cyto-
toxicity (38–40). When P100v cells were compared to the parental
RPMI 8226 cell line, both CDKN1A and PTPN6 were significantly re-
pressed in the Bort-resistant line (both P < 0.0001; Fig. 3, E and F). Dec
and MitoC combination therapy resulted in a complete restoration of
both CDKN1A and PTPN6 transcripts (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.00214,
respectively; Fig. 3, E and F). These data suggest that this optimized drug
combination reactivates key tumor suppressor pathways that may con-
tribute to the observed increased therapeutic efficacy.
Enhanced DNA damage by a QPOP-optimized
drug combination
MitoC is an ICL agent that has been shown to induce double-strand
breaks (41), and Dec has been demonstrated to induce DNA-protein
adducts, eventually leading to DNA damage (35). Thus, we investigated
DNA damage and the DNA damage response after treatment with the
QPOP-optimized drug combination. DNA strand break formation was
quantified by an alkaline comet assay in P100v cells after treatment with
Dec and MitoC alone and in combination. A significantly longer tail/
head ratio, indicative of greater extent of strand breaks, was observed
when Dec and MitoC were administered together [P < 0.0001, against
control DMSO and single-drug treatments, one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with Dunn’s correction and Student’s t test between
two independent groups; Fig. 4A]. To further evaluate the extent of
DNA damage induced by both Dec and MitoC, we analyzed the expres-
sion of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 1 (p-Chk1) and phosphoryl-
ated histone H2AX (g-H2AX) protein. Chk1 is a cell cycle checkpoint
protein that is activated by phosphorylation in response to DNA dam-
age (42), and H2AX is phosphorylated in response to DNA strand
breaks (43). A concerted increase in p-Chk1 was observed upon dual
Dec and MitoC treatment of P100v cells (Fig. 4, B and C). The expres-
sion of g-H2AX for drug combination treatment, on the other hand,
was comparable to the expression induced by MitoC and Dec treatment
alone, suggesting that both equally contribute to the formation of DNA
strand breaks (Fig. 4, B and D). These results collectively show that Dec
and MitoC can synergistically induce DNA damage as evident from
the increased formation of DNA strand breaks and up-regulation of
cell cycle checkpoint regulators.

 QPOP in vivo two-drug dosage optimization
Effective and safe drug concentrations for drug combinations obtained
in vitro are often not accurately reflected in vivo (17, 18). To determine
the optimal concentrations of drugs required in vivo, we carried out a
QPOP analysis of the Dec/MitoC combinations consisting of the two
drugs at five dosages, using a total of nine test combinations, in an
in vivo P100v xenograft model (table S15). The variation in tumor volume
andsurvivalwe observed highlightsthe importance of QPOP analysisin
defining optimal dosage concentrations (Fig. 5, A and B). The quanti-
tative output for the in vivo QPOP analysis was defined as efficacy mi-
nus toxicity, where efficacy is the mean survival time of the mice and
toxicity is the mean loss in body weight (table S16). On the basis of this
defined phenotypic output, QPOP analysis generated a ranked list of
drug combinations with a calculated optimal drug dosage for each drug,
within the dosage range rested, to achieve the greatest overall survival
time (table S17). Furthermore, the parabolic surface map revealed that
the Dec/MitoC drug combination maintained a synergistic interaction,
with the parabola peak at 1.5 mg/kg each for both drugs (Fig. 5C). The
R2 for this analysis was lower at 0.680, with the greater variance in data
possibly attributable to the more complex nature of an in vivo model;
however, the interaction between MitoC and Dec remained significant
(P = 0.0489; table S18). The differences in parabola curvature between
the in vitro and in vivo QPOP analyses (Figs. 2A and 5C, respectively)
reflect differencesin the coefficientsof the second-orderquadratic equa-
tion and demonstrate the importance of reoptimization as drug combi-
nation development spans different biological systems.
Enhanced in vivo efficacy of the QPOP reoptimized
drug combination
To validate in vivo QPOP analysis, we treated tumor-bearing mice with
1.5 mg/kg each of Dec and MitoC, either singly or in combination.
Prolonged survival and decreased tumor size were observed for the
Dec/MitoC drug combination as compared to vehicle DMSO (P =
0.0130) or single-drug administration (P = 0.0121 and 0.00174, com-
pared to Dec and MitoC, respectively; Figs. 5D and 6A). In addition, we
compared the efficacy of Dec/MitoC to other drug combinations that
either are FDA-approved or have been clinically tested for treatment of
MM. We treated subcutaneous P100v tumor-bearing mice with Bort/
Dex/Melph or Bort/Dex/lenalidomide (Lena). Bort/Dex/Melph has
been reported to be an effective regimen in refractory and relapsed
MM, with an overall response rate of 62% and a median overall survival
of 33.8 months (44). Bort/Dex/Lena, on the other hand, has been ap-
proved for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM patients, with
a median overall survival of 30 months (45, 46). Neither the Bort/Dex/
Melph nor the Bort/Dex/Lena treatment group survived longer than the
DMSO control group, suggesting that these drug combinations are not
efficacious in Bort-resistant MM (Fig. 5E). However, Dec/MitoC treat-
ment resulted in significantly longer survival times compared to both
Bort/Dex/Melph treatment (P = 0.0389, Mantel-Cox test) and Bort/
Dex/Lena treatment (P = 0.0246, Mantel-Cox test; Fig. 5E). In addition,
a significant decrease in tumor volume was observed for Dec/MitoC
compared to Bort/Dex/Melph (P = 0.000376) and Bort/Dex/Lena (P =
0.000691), and both Bort/Dex/Melph and Bort/Dex/Lena were not sig-
nificantly different from the DMSO vehicle (P > 0.05; Fig. 5F). These
results collectively provide further evidence that the QPOP-derived
optimized combination of Dec/MitoC is more effective than current
clinically used drug combinations for Bort-resistant MM.
Further investigation into the effects of these drug combinations on
Bort-resistant MM in vivo revealed specific tumor responses to Dec/
MitoC that were not shared by the clinical controls. Ki67 analysis
revealed that Dec/MitoC treatment resulted in significantly impaired
cell proliferation compared to vehicle control (P = 0.00477), Dec (P =
0.0112), and MitoC (P = 0.0376) single-drug treatments as well as
both clinically used drug combinations (P = 0.0215 for Bort/Dex/Melph

 and P = 0.00943 for Bort/Dex/Lena) (Fig. 6, B and C). Terminal de-
oxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end
labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed that Dec/MitoC resulted in signif-
icantly more apoptosis compared to the vehicle control (P = 0.00222),
single Dec drug treatment group (P = 0.00244), and Bort/Dex/Lena
(P = 0.0424; Fig. 6, B and D). Notably, Bort/Dex/Melph, which has
shown some clinical efficacy in refractory and relapsed MM cases,
exhibited a similar apoptotic response to Dec/MitoC (Fig. 6, B and
D). This suggests that although clinically used combinations such as
Bort/Dex/Melph may have an apoptotic effect on Bort-resistant MM,
optimizing drug combinationsfor Bort-resistant MM resultedin acom-
bination that can both induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation. Fur-
thermore, both CDKN1A and PTPN6 transcripts were up-regulated in
vivo only after treatment withthe optimized drug combination (Fig. 6, E
and F). This recapitulates the in vitro results and provides further
evidence that reactivation of key tumor suppressor pathways may
contribute to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy seen by the QPOP
drug combination but not the monotherapies or currently clinically
used drug combinations.
As a follow-up to the synergism observed in the earlier ALL in vitro
data, we investigated whether the ability of Dec/MitoC to outperform
clinically used drug combinations observed in our Bort-resistant MM
model could also be observed in an intravenous in vivo Bort-resistant
ALL model, when compared against the clinically used combinations
Dex/cyclophosphamide (Cyclo) (47, 48) or Dex/Melph (49). The
Dec/MitoC combination did not result in significant increases in sur-
vival compared to vehicle control, single-drug treatments, or clinically
used combinations (fig. S7, A and B). It is likely that QPOP reoptimiza-
tion is required to identify the optimal dosages for the intravenously
seeded Bort-resistant ALL xenograft mouse model because the
distribution of tumor cells and dosage-specific responses likely differ
from the subcutaneous Bort-resistant MM xenograft mouse model.
DISCUSSION
QPOP overcame many of the hurdles associated with drug combination
design and optimization, identifying optimal drug combinations and
optimal drug dosages by applying experimental data to a deterministic
model independent of molecular mechanistic assumptions. Here,
QPOP was able to identify from a set of 14 drugs, in a mechanism-blind
manner, a more globally optimized drug combination as well as the op-
timal dosages of each drug for effective treatment of Bort-resistant MM.
This was achieved through multiple iterations of QPOP optimization,
from in vitro cell lines through to a more complex in vivo system. As
demonstrated in this study, in vivo QPOP reoptimization of drug com-
binations identified in vitro may be needed to identify the dosages re-
quired for the most effective therapeutic results. The need to reoptimize
dosages in vivo lies in changes to the effects of drugs in a more complex
biological system, where differences in pharmacokinetic properties,
such as biodistribution, between drugs will ultimately affect how much
of each drug is made available to the target tumors compared to other
organs where they may confer toxic effects. The in vivo doses that were
identified by QPOP reoptimization directly correlated to therapeutic ef-
ficacy and safety and implicitly accounted for the pharmacokinetic
properties of the drug combination that affected in vivo drug exposure.
Thus, whereas in vitro QPOP was effective in identifying the compo-
nents of the optimized drug combination, in vivo QPOP reoptimization
of the drug dosage ratios was able to identify the globally optimal drug-
dose combination.
The ability of QPOP to continuously optimize drug combinations
acrossmultiple systemsofinterestinamechanism-blindmannermakes
QPOP an attractive platform for combination therapy development
that addresses many of the challenges that currently confront the drug
development community. For example, drug repurposing is considered
a promising approachtoward reducing or recovering drug development
costs while expanding treatment options for a wide range of diseases,
including cancer(50, 51).The clinicalsuccessof drug repurposing, how-
ever, often relies on the drugs’ appropriate incorporation into drug
combinations. The application of approaches such as dose escalation
or other conventional strategies that sample the expansive dosing space
can result in combinations with suboptimal dosing ratios. Because
conventional approaches seek clinically acceptable increases in efficacy
response from near-maximum tolerated doses, this could result in
minimal increases in efficacy and even downstream clinical trial failure
due to patient toxicity and mortality. Increasingly, specifically targeted
drugs also necessitate the development of combination therapies to fully
realize the efficacy of these targeted approaches. Therefore, QPOP
may have a role in decreasing drug development costs by rapidly
identifying optimal administration parameters at different phases of
drug development.
We would note that QPOP achieves global optimality under certain
assumptions that biological response to therapeutic intervention is a
robust process that can be mapped by a parabolic smooth map. QPOP
may not achieve global optimality in all general situations, including
settings with a large nonbiological component. Pairing of QPOP with
fully automated high-throughput technology could allow for experi-
mental validation of all possible combinations to demonstrate that
the globally optimal drug combination was identified by QPOP, which
was not done in this study. Although this study was able to reposition
existing clinical drugs for use in MM, the pool of drug candidates from
which QPOP was performed comprised only 14 drugs, including drugs
selected after an initial screen of the FDA-approved oncology drug set
V. More effective drug combinations might result from using drugs that
were not included within this 14-drug set. Again, pairing QPOP with
fully automated high-throughput technology could allow for expanded
in vitro QPOP analysis to identify globally optimal drug combinations
from larger sets of drugs. Furthermore, other drug compounds selected
on the basis of complementary approaches, such as genome-guided
drug selection, would markedly expand the range of derived combina-
tions and provide more immediate insight into drug combinations for
established genomic biomarker-positive patients. Another limitation of
the QPOP work presented in this study is that the optimized drug com-
binations did not take into account the effects of sequential drug
treatment. A number of studies have demonstrated that certain drug
combinations exhibit sequence-dependent efficacy as well as
sequence-dependent synergy or antagonism. Although the most well
characterized of these sequence-dependent drug combinations are
linked to first modulating expression of key drug transporters or
priming the tumor microenvironment to improve tumor uptake of
cytotoxic drugs, there is preclinical and clinical evidence that even
combinations of general cytotoxic drugs may benefit from sequential
treatment (52–55). In vivo or low-throughput optimization of drug
combinations that include optimization of drug treatment sequence
would likely be limited to smaller drug sets with the current QPOP
platform. Although limited to smaller focused drug sets, optimization of
sequential drug combinations by QPOP would be a logical next study to
identify the optimal in vivo sequence of two to three drug combination
treatments, as well as the optimal dosages by which these drugs mediate

 maximal efficacy. Finally, the work presented here demonstrated QPOP
optimization in MM, which is characterized by a single solid tumor site.
Application of QPOP toward other cancers, especially cancers with
multiple tumor sites or hematological malignancies that do not have
solid tumor foci, requires further investigation, as evidenced by
Dec/MitoC response in the Bort-resistant ALL xenograft mouse model.
A key advantage of the QPOP platform over conventional ap-
proaches is that QPOP does not use predetermined drug synergy
information that can confound preclinical and clinical development,
given the dose-dependent nature of drug antagonism and synergy.
There are several factors that can affect optimal drug combination de-
sign, such as the individual drugs having mutually exclusive targets, in-
dividual efficacies, and possibly having overlapping toxicities. Results
from this study demonstrated that synergistic interactions can be iden-
tified and they contribute to the efficacy of drug combinations. Howev-
er, synergy is not the sole determinant for the identification of globally
optimized drug combinations. In the case of the ex vivo QPOP analysis
of naïve MM patient samples, the drug set was built around Dec/MitoC
and two clinically used combinations, Bort/Pano/Dex and Bort/Melph/
Dex. We observed that the efficacies of these drug combinations were
differently ranked across patient samples, in accordance with the fact
that interpatient heterogeneity will always limit the efficacy of any single
proposed drug combination. Clinical results for both Bort/Pano/Dex
and Bort/Melph/Dex bear this out as well (13, 44).
QPOP identified a drug combination that may provide increased ef-
ficacy and benefit for a subset of patients after development of resistance
to Bort or other proteasome inhibitors. Further studies of patient re-
sponse to this combination, paired with genomic or DNA hypermethy-
lation analysis, may be used to identify the most appropriate subset of
patients based on a putative genomic or hypermethylation biomarker.
The identification of a DNA hypermethylation biomarker could poten-
tially be determined through supervised cocluster analysis. A similar
supervised cocluster analysis of Dec/MitoC drug response to genomic
data might reveal unique genomic signature subtypes that are more sen-
sitive to the newly described combination (56). Beyond population-
specific optimized drug combinations, ex vivo QPOP analysis of
primary MM patient samples presented evidence that QPOP could also
be applied toward identifying the best drug combination for specific pa-
tients. This would be particularly valuable for malignancies such as MM
where the yield from bone marrow is low and not easily obtainable and
optimized drug combination analysis must be highly efficient.
Although QPOP does not rely on mechanistic assumptions to derive
optimal drug combinations, we were able to identify a potential mech-
anism to treat MM, that is, by targeting DNA hypermethylation and
promoting the reexpression of the tumor suppressor genes CDKN1A
and PTPN6. The increase in global DNA methylation in the resistant
cell lines mirrored the clinical phenomenon where DNA hypermethy-
lation is observed in relapsed MM (36). Although epigenetic drugs such
as DNMT inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have
been approved for clinical use, this approval is limited to a handful of
hematological malignancies (57, 58). The vast majority of clinical trials
for epigenetic inhibitors have failed because of a lack of patient response
or toxicity (30). These clinical studies often use epigenetic inhibitors as
monotherapies or in nonoptimized drug combinations with standard
preexisting therapeutic regimens. Epigenetic drug combinations based
on in vitro synergistic activities have also thus far not successfully trans-
lated into the clinic. Although HDAC and DNMT inhibitors have
shown synergistic activity in vitro, multiple clinical trials demonstrated
no clinical benefits and, in some cases, even pharmacodynamic antag-
onism for these combinations (59–61). These studies highlight the need
for continuous optimization of drug combinations and dosages
throughout the entire drug development pipeline.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Here, we described a process to identify and rank optimal drug-dosage
combinations as a continuous optimization platform, QPOP, based on
the concept that biological responses to external perturbations can be
mapped to smooth parabolic surfaces (22). This study aimed to use
QPOP to identify effective optimal drug-dosage combinations from a
diverse set of 14 FDA-approved oncology drugs in Bort-resistant
MM. We performed QPOP analysis in vitro to identify drug combina-
tions from this pool of candidates that were effective against a Bort-
resistant human MM cell line. We then performed QPOP analysis in an
in vivo xenograft model to reoptimize the drug combination to identify
the optimal drug dosages for efficacy and reduced toxicity, thus providing
a globally optimal drug-dosage combination. This study further aimed to
evaluate the application of QPOP toward ex vivo patient sample drug
combination optimization and to evaluate the sensitivity of individual
MM patient samples toward QPOP-optimized drug combinations. Hu-
man primary MM cells used for in vitro validation and ex vivo QPOP
experiments were obtained from naïve or relapsed MM patients from
the National University Hospital. Treatment groups were not blinded;
however, drug combinations for all QPOP analyses were prepared by an
automated liquid handler. Details of replicate experiments are included
in the figure legends. All animal studies were performed in accordance
with animal research protocols approved by the National University of
Singapore Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Singapore.
Mice were randomly assigned to each treatment group. Minimum
mouse treatment group sample sizes were determined by power analy-
ses based on an expected minimum 2× difference with a 0.5 SD, a power
of 80%, and a statistical significance of <0.05. Mice were euthanized
when tumors reached 15 mm in diameter. Bone marrow samples from
myeloma patients were collected after informed consent. The collection
of bone marrow samples from myeloma patients for research per-
formed under Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) protocols
2007/00173 and 2012/00058 was approved by the National Healthcare
Group DSRB that governs research ethics in Singapore that involves
patients, staff, premises, or facilities of the National Healthcare Group
and any other institutions under its oversight.
QPOP analysis
The results of the QPOP analysis were correlated into a second-order
quadratic series. For in vitro experiments, the viability of the cells was
used for the fitting, whereas for in vivo experiments, the toxicity sub-
tracted from the efficacy was used for the optimization process. The
second-order quadratic series is as follows:
y ¼ b0 þ b1x1 þ … þ bnxn þ b12x1x2 þ … þ bmnxmxnþ
b11x1
2 þ … þ bnnxn
2
ð1Þ
where y represents the desired output, xn is the nth drug dosage, b0 is the
intercept term, bn is the single-drug coefficient of the nth drug, bmn is
the interaction coefficient between the mth and nth drugs, and bnn is the
quadratic coefficient for the nth drug. This second-order quadratic se-
ries was coded with MATLAB software (MathWorks Inc.), where each

 drug combination was represented as a vector and coded dosages were
used in the analysis (data file S1). For in vitro experiments, the relative
viabilities of the Bort-resistant cell line RPMI 8226 were subtracted from
the relative viabilities of the Bort-sensitive THLE-2 cell line for each
combination and used as data for correlation into the second-order
linear regression process. For in vivo experiments, the optimization
metric was calculated as the mean weight loss of the mice (fig. S6) sub-
tracted from the mean survival time of the mice (table S16).
Stepwise regression was initialized with first-order drug terms, inter-
action terms between drugs, and second-order drug terms, with their
corresponding estimated coefficients. Interaction terms and second-
order drug terms were removed sequentially based on the highest
P values in F test variance comparisons between the reference equation
and the subsequent equation with the removed interaction or second-
order drug term.
The predictive power of the generated outcomes was also calculated
via adjusted R2 and correlation coefficients to confirm the fidelity of
QPOP optimization considering the number of drug and drug-drug in-
teraction terms. Correlation coefficients (measures of the strength of the
linear association between two variables ranging in value between zero
and one) were derived from the experimental output values and
projected output values for the corresponding drug combinations.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in at least triplicate biological repeats,
unless otherwise stated, with data presented as means ± SD. Normal
distributions were first determined using the Shapiro-Wilk normality
test. Student’s two-tailed t test was used for the comparison of two
independent groups, whereas one-way ANOVA (with Dunn’s correc-
tion) was used for multiple comparisons. IC50 curves were compared
using a sum-of-squares F test. For tumor volume analysis, Student’s
t test was carried out between two independent groups at the end point
of the experiment. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-
rank Mantel-Cox test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Primary data are shown in table S19.
