Background
Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep (e.g. sleep onset, maintenance, early waking, impairment of daytime
functioning). Insomnia disorder impairs quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of physical and mental health problems
including anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased health service use. hypnotic medications (e.g. benzodiazepines
and ’Z’ drugs) are licensed for sleep promotion, but can induce tolerance and dependence, although many people remain on long-
term treatment. Antidepressant use for insomnia is widespread, but none is licensed for insomnia and the evidence for their efficacy is
unclear. This use of unlicensed medications may be driven by concern over longer-term use of hypnotics and the limited availability of
psychological treatments.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.
Search methods
This review incorporated the results of searches to July 2015 conducted on electronic bibliographic databases: the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to 2015), Embase (1980 to 2015) and PsycINFO (1806
to 2015). We updated the searches to December 2017, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or older) with a primary diagnosis of insomnia and all participant
types including people with comorbidities. Any antidepressant as monotherapy at any dose whether compared with placebo, other
medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines and ’Z’ drugs), a different antidepressant, waiting list control or treatment as usual.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data using a data extraction form. A third review author
resolved disagreements on inclusion or data extraction.

 Main results
The search identified 23 RCTs (2806 participants).
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo: three studies (135 participants) compared SSRIs with
placebo. Combining results was not possible. Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in subjective sleep measures at
six (60 participants, P = 0.03) and 12 weeks (27 participants, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the fluoxetine study (low quality
evidence).
There were either no adverse events or they were not reported (very low quality evidence).
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) compared with placebo: six studies (812 participants) compared TCA with placebo; five used
doxepin and one used trimipramine. We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four studies (518 participants) could be pooled, showing a
moderate improvement in subjective sleep quality over placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.39, 95% confidence interval
(CI) -0.56 to -0.21) (moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence suggested that TCAs possibly improved sleep efficiency
(mean difference (MD) 6.29 percentage points, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; 4 studies; 510 participants) and increased sleep time (MD 22.88
minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; 4 studies; 510 participants). There may have been little or no impact on sleep latency (MD -4.27
minutes, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; 4 studies; 510 participants).
There may have been little or no difference in adverse events between TCAs and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21;
6 studies; 812 participants) (low quality evidence).
’Other’ antidepressants with placebo: eight studies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mianserin and seven used
trazodone). Three studies (370 participants) of trazodone could be pooled, indicating a moderate improvement in subjective sleep
outcomes over placebo (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02). Two studies of trazodone measured polysomnography and found little
or no difference in sleep efficiency (MD 1.38 percentage points, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63; 169 participants) (low quality evidence).
There was low quality evidence from two studies of more adverse effects with trazodone than placebo (i.e. morning grogginess, increased
dry mouth and thirst).
Authors’ conclusions
We identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations. The effects of SSRIs compared with
placebo are uncertain with too few studies to draw clear conclusions. There may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-
term use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone compared with placebo. The tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is
uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events. There was no evidence for amitriptyline (despite common use in clinical practice)
or for long-term antidepressant use for insomnia. High-quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed.

Antidepressants for insomnia
Why is this review important?
Insomnia (having difficulty falling or staying asleep) is common, approximately one in five people report sleep problems in the preceeding
year. Insomnia can cause daytime fatigue, distress, impairment of daytime functioning and reduced quality of life. It is associated with
increased mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and increased healthcare use. Management depends on the duration and
nature of the sleep problem. It may involve: treating coexisting medical problems; providing advice on sleep habits and lifestyle (known
as sleep hygiene); medicines and psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT, which is a talking therapy).
Medicines called hypnotics (for example, temazepam and ’Z’ drugs) are most commonly used to treat insomnia and are known to help
sleep, but can have problems such as tolerance (needing to take more of the medicine to get the same effect) and dependence (physical
or mental problems if the medicine is stopped). Guidelines recommend only short-term use of hypnotics (two to four weeks). However,
millions of people worldwide take long-term hypnotic medicines.
Antidepressants are widely prescribed for insomnia despite not being licensed for this use, and uncertain evidence for their effectiveness.
This may be because of the concerns regarding hypnotic medicines. Psychological treatments such as CBT are known to help insomnia,
but availability is limited. Thus, alternative medicines, such as antidepressants (used to treat depression) and antihistamines (used to
treat allergies), are sometimes tried. Assessing the evidence for the unlicensed use of these medicines is important.

 Who will be interested in this review?
People with sleep problems and their doctors will be interested in this review to better understand the research evidence and enable
informed decision-making regarding using antidepressants for insomnia.
What questions did this review aim to answer?
The aim was to find out how well antidepressants work in treating insomnia in adults, how safe they are and if they have any side
effects.
Which studies did we include in the review?
We included randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people were randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups;
these trials provide the most reliable and highest quality evidence) of adults with an insomnia diagnosis. People could have had other
conditions (comorbidities) in addition to insomnia. We included any dose of antidepressant (but not combinations with another
antidepressant) compared with placebo (pretend treatment), other medicines for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines or ’Z’ drugs), a different
antidepressant, waiting list control or ’treatment as usual.’
What did the evidence from the review tell us?
We reviewed 23 studies with 2806 people with insomnia. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low due to a small number of people
in the studies, and problems with how the studies were undertaken and reported. We often could not combine the individual study
results. There was low quality evidence to support short-term (i.e. weeks rather than months) use for some antidepressants. There was
no evidence for the antidepressant amitriptyline, which is commonly used in clinical practice, or to support long-term antidepressant
use for insomnia. The evidence did not support the clinical current practice of prescribing antidepressants for insomnia.
What should happen next?
High quality trials of antidepressants for insomnia are needed to provide better evidence to inform clinical practice. Additionally, health
professionals and patients should be made aware of the current paucity of evidence for antidepressants commonly used for insomnia
management.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low quality: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
1Downgraded two levels for unclear risk of bias: lack of information on randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding
in included studies and low numbers.
2Downgraded one level for imprecision: lack of reporting or sparse data for relevant outcome.

Description of the condition
Insomnia disorder is a subjective condition of unsatisfactory sleep,
in terms of sleep onset, sleep maintenance or early waking (Wilson
2010). It is a disorder that impairs daytime well-being and subjec-
tive abilities and functioning, and so can be considered a ’24-hour’
disorder. It often starts with a clear event such as unusual stress at
work or is associated with illness of self or family, or bereavement.
Once the triggering circumstances have diminished or have been
addressed as far as possible, most people will return to normal sleep
if they adhere to good sleep habits. However, the condition may go
on to be a chronic complaint (i.e. symptoms persisting more than
a month), and the main factor influencing this is anxiety about
sleep (Morin 2003). Essential features of insomnia are heightened
arousal and learned sleep-preventing associations.
In early classification systems, insomnia was often classified into
primary and secondary, where secondary insomnia referred to in-
somnia occurring in association with another disorder. However,
most recent classification systems have moved away from this divi-
sion as the distinction is now considered unhelpful (Perlis 2010).
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth
edition (DSM-5) recommends the use of the term ’insomnia dis-
order,’ which we use for this review, but we are aware that past re-
search papers have used other terms to describe insomnia (DSM-V
2015).
Studies of the prevalence of insomnia in the general population
indicate that one third of adults in Western countries experi-
ence difficulty with sleep initiation or maintenance at least once a
week (LeBlanc 2009; Sateia 2004), and 6% to 15% are thought
to meet the criteria for insomnia disorder in that they report
sleep disturbance plus significant daytime dysfunction (LeBlanc
2009; Sivertsen 2009). There is a higher incidence of insomnia in
women, and the incidence increases in both men and women as
they get older.
Insomnia may be present alongside other disorders such as de-
pression, anxiety disorders and physical problems (Baglioni 2011).
Once other disorders are properly treated, insomnia may persist
and need treatment. It is important to treat insomnia because the
condition causes decreased quality of life (Chevalier 1999; Leger
2001; Philip 2006); is associated with impaired functioning in
many areas such as memory and executive function (Altena 2008;
Edinger 2008; Nissen 2011); and leads to increased risk of a new
episode or relapse of depression, anxiety and possibly cardiovascu-
lar disorders (Breslau 1996; Neckelmann 2007; Vgontzas 2009).
Description of the intervention
The goal of treatinginsomniadisorderis tolessensuffering and im-
prove daytime function. The two main treatment classes shown to
be effective, at least in the short term, are psychological and phar-
macological treatments; although evidence is limited for longer-
termeffects(Riemann 2009). The type of treatmentchosenshould
be patient-guided, should take into account the particular pattern
of the problem (i.e. sleep onset or staying asleep) and should be
evidence based (Wilson 2010).
Psychological treatments
Psychological interventions designed for insomnia, usually con-
sisting of a package of educational, behavioural and cognitive ther-
apy, improve insomnia. Based on extensive published evidence, in-
cluding nine systematic reviews or meta-analyses, the National In-
stitutes of Health ’Consensus and State of the Science Statement’
concluded that a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) package is
“as effective as prescription medications are for short-term treat-
ment of chronic insomnia. Moreover, there are indications that the
beneficial effects of CBT, in contrast to those produced by medi-
cations, may last well beyond the termination of active treatment”
(NIH 2005). The UK consensus on the treatment of insomnia
also recommended that CBT should be used as first-line treatment
depending on patient choice, but pointed out that this therapy
may not be available, or the patient may not wish to engage in it,
and therefore the choice may be a drug treatment (Wilson 2010).
Drug treatments for insomnia
Most of the licensed drugs for insomnia are allosteric modulators
of the GABA-A receptor, and thus enhance gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) function in the brain. The benzodiazepines and ’Z’
drugs (zopiclone, eszopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon) are in this
category and these are commonly referred to as ’hypnotic’ medi-
cations. These drugs are all effective in insomnia (Buscemi 2007;
NIH 2005), but as well as promoting sleep they are anxiolytic, an-
ticonvulsant and myorelaxant, and can cause ataxia and memory
problems when taken other than just before a period in bed. If their
effect persists after waking up in the morning, they are described
as having ’hangover’ effects. Therefore, differences in the duration
of action of individual drugs are of particular importance, with
short-acting drugs giving rise to less risk of next-day effects such
as sedation, and impairment of skills such as driving.
A melatonin preparation is licensed for the treatment of insomnia
in people aged over 55 years, and this drug does not give rise to
motor or memory effects (Lemoine 2007; Wade 2007). Clinical
trials have begun to measure daytime outcomes for hypnotic med-
ications, and beneficial effects have been reported for melatonin
in people over 55 years of age (Auld 2017), as well as for zolpidem,
zopiclone, eszopiclone and lormetazepam (NICE 2004; Wilson
2010) These measures have not been used in studies of other drugs,
so their effects on daytime function are not well documented.

 Duration of prescribing
It has long been stated that hypnotic medication should not be
used long term for the treatment of insomnia. This was the consen-
sus view of the panel of a 1983 National Institute of Health Con-
sensus Conference on the medication treatment of insomnia (NIH
1983), which became a guideline for clinical practice in the USA.
Later, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (Committee on
Safety of Medicines 1988), the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and
the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance
(now the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) also
recommended only short-term use (NICE 2004). While it was
appreciated that benzodiazepine hypnotic agents had a favourable
risk-benefit ratio and were first-line agents for insomnia manage-
ment, these reports expressed concerns about the risks of tolerance
and dependence, and recommended their use should be limited
to periods of two to four weeks. This view was not based on data
demonstrating an unfavourable transition in the risk-benefit ratio
after two to four weeks of treatment, but appeared to have emerged
because no substantive placebo-controlled trials of hypnotics had
been carried out for longer than a few weeks. Despite the recom-
mendation for duration of treatment with hypnotic drugs being
only two to four weeks, many millions of people worldwide remain
on long-term treatment (Balter 1992; Ishigooka 1999; Mellinger
1985; Ohayon 1999; Wilson 2010). Trials of nightly dosing for up
to six months’ duration suggest that tolerance and withdrawal do
not generally occur with some hypnotics (zolpidem: six months of
’as needed’ treatment (Krystal 2008); eszopiclone: two studies of
six-months’ duration (Krystal 2003; Walsh 2007); ramelteon: one
six-month study with outcome assessed with polysomnography
(PSG) but not self-report (Mayer 2009); and temazepam: one two-
month study (Morin 1999)). Other agents have not been studied
for longer durations. Therefore, the available evidence does not
suggest there is an unfavourable risk/benefit transition at three to
four weeks for any agent. However, the recommendations remain
in place, and clinicians are generally unwilling to prescribe for long
periods.
Antidepressants
The use of antidepressants to treat insomnia is widespread (Everitt
2014; Morlock 2006; NHS Digital 2011; Wilson 2010), but can
be considered to be ’off-label’ as none is licensed for insomnia. One
consensus statement from the British Association of Psychophar-
macology (BAP) highlighted that “low-doses (sub-therapeutic of
depression) of sedating tricyclics, particularly amitriptyline, do-
sulepin and doxepin, have been used for decades to treat insomnia.
This is particularly common practice in the UK” (Wilson 2010),
and that “low doses of amitriptyline (10 mg or 25 mg) have been
used for long periods in many patients with chronic illness partic-
ularly those with pain syndromes.” Antidepressants are also widely
prescribed ’off licence’ in the USA for insomnia, with trazodone, a
triazolopyridine derivative, being the most commonly prescribed
at subtherapeutic antidepressant doses (Lai 2011).
How the intervention might work
Factors that have influenced the use of antidepressants for insom-
nia are:
• low-dose antidepressants, particularly the tricyclic
antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline, are helpful in the treatment
of chronic pain and studies have reported reduction in pain-
related sleep disturbance (Saarto 2010);
• some sedating antidepressants improve sleep problems in
people with depression (Mayers 2005; Wilson 2005); and
• there is no prescribing duration limitation on
antidepressant use in insomnia, so clinicians may perceive these
medications have the potential for longer-term use.
The proposed mechanism of action for low-dose amitriptyline is as
a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, although 5-HT2 and cholin-
ergic muscarinic antagonism may also contribute. Trazodone, the
second most frequently prescribed medication for insomnia in the
USA, is an antagonist at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and alpha1 adrenergic
receptors as well as a weak 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. Trimipramine
blocks alpha1 adrenergic, histamine H1, dopamine D2, 5-HT2
and cholinergic receptors (Wilson 2010).
One meta-analysis of drugs used in treatment of chronic insomnia
described seven studies that used antidepressants (doxepin, tra-
zodone, trimipramine) to treat insomnia at doses used in depres-
sion (Buscemi 2007). The review concluded that there was some
evidence that antidepressants, particularly doxepin and trazodone,
may be effective treatments for chronic insomnia, with similar
adverse effects to benzodiazepines, but highlighted the paucity of
evidence, as did the BAP consensus statement (Wilson 2010).
Otherfactors that should be considered with the use of antidepres-
sants for insomnia are: toxicity in overdose for amitriptyline and
other TCAs; tolerability and adverse effect issues such as morn-
ing ’hangover’ effects; and increased restless leg syndrome, peri-
odic limb movements in sleep and sleep bruxism with selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), venlafaxine, mianserin and
mirtazapine.
Why it is important to do this review
Antidepressants are widely prescribed for insomnia despite not be-
ing licensed for this indication and there being a poor evidence
base for their effectiveness in insomnia. A significant factor in
this widespread prescription is likely to be concern regarding the
longer-term use of hypnotic medications, and guidelines suggest-
ing that long-term use of hypnotics should be avoided due to po-
tential dependencyandaddiction.Clinicians seekalternative treat-
ments for insomnia that can be used longer term. There is poor
availability of psychological treatments, thus alternative medica-
tions such as antidepressants and antihistamine are tried. We sys-

 tematically reviewed the evidence (or lack of it) behind this prac-
tice, including the efficacy, safety and tolerability of antidepres-
sants. Other Cochrane Reviews explored other aspects of insom-
nia management (i.e. new-generation hypnotics (Rösner 2013),
acupuncture (Cheuk 2012), and CBT (Aversa Lopes 2009)). To-
gether, these reviews highlight what is known about insomnia
management and what further research is needed to provide clin-
icians with the information they require to manage this common
and troublesome condition.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster and cross-
over RCTs.
Types of participants
We included adults (aged 18 or over) with a diagnosis of insom-
nia (to include Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), International Classification of
Sleep Disorders (ICSD), International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Health Related Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10)
(WHO 1992), and other well-recognised classifications), We also
included participants with insomnia defined on validated rating
scales such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Sleep sub-
scale (HAM-D Insomnia).
We included all participant types (including people with comorbid
depression or anxiety disorder and other comorbidities).
Types of interventions
Experimental intervention
We included any antidepressant (administered for at least three
days) as monotherapy including all doses.
We organised antidepressants into classes for the purposes of this
review, as follows.
• SSRIs: fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline,
citalopram, escitalopram.
• TCAs: amitriptyline, imipramine, trimipramine, doxepin,
desipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, clomipramine,
dothiepin, lofepramine.
• Heterocyclic antidepressants: mianserin, amoxapine,
maprotiline.
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI):
◦ irreversible: phenelzine, tranylcypromine,
isocarboxazid;
◦ reversible: brofaramine, moclobemide, tyrima.
• ’Other’ antidepressants:
◦ noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NARIs): reboxetine,
atomoxetine;
◦ noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs):
amineptine, bupropion;
◦ serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):
venlafaxine, milnacipram, duloxetine;
◦ noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants
(NASSAs): mirtazapine;
◦ serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs):
trazodone;
◦ unclassified:agomelatine, vilazodone.
Comparator interventions
• Placebo.
• Other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines, ’Z’
drugs).
• A different antidepressant.
• Waiting list control or treatment as usual.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Efficacy: any subjective improvement in sleep quality or
satisfaction with sleep, total sleep duration (measured in hours or
minutes), sleep onset latency (measured as time taken to fall
asleep), number of nocturnal awakenings or total nocturnal
awakening time (measured in hours or minutes) or sleep
efficiency (measured as a ratio of time asleep to time in bed).
A variety of rating scales were reported (e.g. the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse 1989); Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI) (Morin 2011); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - Sleep
disturbance factor (HRSD or HAM-D) (Hamilton 1960); visual
analogue scales (VAS)).
• Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity.
Secondary outcomes
• Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) or PSG data).
8

 • Tolerability: reported information on tolerability (e.g.
problems with daytime drowsiness, dropout rates).
• Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning.
Timing of outcome assessments
Some trials had multiple sleep diary end points. We report end
points consistently reported across studies rather than the proto-
col-stated primary end point.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases:
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,
2015, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to July 2015), Ovid Em-
base (1980 to July 2015), Ovid PsycINFO (1806 to July 2015).
The initial search was carried out 6 November 2013 and up-
dated on 8 July 2015. We applied no date or language restrictions
(Appendix 1).
In keeping with Cochrane Methodological Expectations of
Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) conduct standard C37,
we ran additional, prepublication searches (3 August 2016 and
12 December 2017), but the results were not incorporated in the
review. In 2017, we added the drug term ’Esmirtazapine’ to the
search strategies and back-dated the search, as appropriate.
Searching other resources
We reviewed the reference lists of included studies to identify
further relevant studies. Ongoing studies were identified through
searching the World Health Organization (WHO) International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Clinical Trials.gov,
and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufactur-
ers&Associationsplatform(IFPMA Clinical Trials Portal)(8July
2015).
We updated the search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the ICTRP to 12
December 2017.
We contacted key researchers in the area to ask about ongoing
work or unpublished studies they might know of.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently identified studies using a pre-
viously prepared inclusion criteria form that had been piloted pre-
viously. A third review author resolved disagreements concerning
the selection of studies. The review authors were not blinded to the
names of the trial authors, institutions or journal of publication.
The process of study identification and its results are outlined in
Figure 1 according to the PRISMA statement (Moher 2009).

 Data extraction and management
Two review authors independently extracted data using a data ex-
traction form. The extraction form was piloted before use and in
the case of discrepancy, we consulted a third review author. We col-
lected information on participants (age, gender, diagnostic criteria,
sample size, country, setting, number of participants randomised
and number followed up), intervention (drug, dosage, length of
treatment, any concomitant interventions, controls, placebo) and
outcome measures (subjective improvement in sleep, rating scale,
numbers of adverse events, objective measures of change in sleep,
reported information on tolerability).
Main planned comparisons
The main comparisons were each identified antidepressant versus:
• placebo;
• other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines, ’Z’
drugs);
• other antidepressants; and
• waiting list control or treatment as usual.
These comparisons were made initially on a drug level and then
were combined at a class of drug level. We only combined drugs in
analyses from the same class. The ’other’ antidepressants category
(see Types of interventions) is presented together, but only drugs
of the same class were combined to produce a pooled effect (e.g.
trazodone).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed each study for bias in
accordance with the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Bias was assessed in terms of random sequence generation and
allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants
andpersonnel (performance bias), blindingof outcome assessment
(detectionbias), incomplete outcome data(attritionbias), selective
reporting (reporting bias) and other bias. Each type of bias was
assessed as low, high or unclear risk, depending on the availability
of information and the likelihood of bias. If insufficient details
were provided or the risk was uncertain in the trial, the level of bias
was described as ’unclear.’ If the two review authors determining
the level of bias disagreed, a third review author (HE) assessed the
evidence and made a decision regarding the level of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous variables, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and risk
difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD)
where studies used the same scale, and standardized mean differ-
ences (SMD) where studies used different scales, with their 95%
CIs.
Unit of analysis issues
Cross-over trials
We identified no cross-over trials.
If in updates of the review we include cross-over trials where suffi-
cient data are present, we plan to include in the analysis data from
the first period only to avoid carry-over effects.
Cluster-randomised trials
We identified no cluster-randomised trials.
If in updates of the review we include cluster-randomised trials, we
plan to conduct the analysis at the same level as the allocation using
a summary measure from each cluster. However, if this appears to
unnecessarily reduce the power of the study due to the number
and size of the clusters, we will seek statistical advice to determine
if an RR or MD (or SMD if different scales have been used)
with CIs can be calculated accounting for the cluster design based
on a ’multi-level model’ or another appropriate method (Higgins
2011).
Studies with multiple treatment groups
In studies with multiple treatment groups, we included the same
group of participants only once in the meta-analysis to avoid mul-
tiple comparisons. We combined groups to compare a single pair-
wise comparison where possible. If this was not appropriate, we
chose one pair of interventions and excluded the others.
Dealing with missing data
Where data were suspected to be missing, we contacted the main
author of the primary study. If this was unsuccessful, we imputed
absent information for continuous data by carrying the last ob-
servation forward (Higgins 2011). A sensitivity analysis was un-
dertaken excluding high levels of missing data. For dichotomous
data, we performed an intention-to-treat analysis.

 Assessment of heterogeneity
Before meta-analysis, we assessed studies for clinical homogeneity
with respect to type of therapy, control group and outcomes. For
studies judged as clinically homogeneous, we estimated statisti-
cal heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2011), using the
following as an approximate guide to interpretation: 0% to 40%
might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate
heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogene-
ity; and 75% to 100% considerable heterogeneity. In cases of con-
siderable heterogeneity, we explored the data further, including by
subgroup analyses, in an attempt to explain the heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Comprehensive searching for trials helped to reduce the risk of
reporting biases. There were insufficient identified trials in each
group to enter into funnel graphs (which require more than 10
studies) (trial effect versus variance) in an attempt to investigate
the likelihood of overt publication bias (Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis
If studies were sufficiently homogeneous for their pooling to be
clinically meaningful, we performed a meta-analysis using a ran-
dom-effects model, regardless of the I2 results. We performed the
analysis using Review Manager 5 software (Review Manager 2014)
and produced forest plots for all analyses.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where sufficient data were available, we performed subgroup anal-
ysis to look at:
• people with a diagnosis of depression or anxiety compared
with people without a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, since a
treatment effect of antidepressants on the symptoms of
depression and anxiety may impact on sleep;
• people with a recorded physical comorbidity (e.g. back
pain), as people with physical comorbidities may have different
causes for their sleep problems to people with lone insomnia,
and this may impact on the effect of antidepressants in these
groups and
• dose as a variable, particularly at low dose as a subgroup, as
some antidepressants have been widely used in lower than usual
antidepressant range treatment doses for the management of
sleep problems (e.g. amitriptyline 10 mg). ’Low-dose’
antidepressants are defined as lower than the usual dose range for
treatment of depression.
Subgroup analyses are hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis
testing, and therefore have been interpreted with caution.
Sensitivity analysis
Where sufficient studies existed, we excluded studies that were
at higher risk of bias to assess if study quality affects the results.
Planned sensitivity analyses included trials with:
• low numbers of participants (i.e. fewer than 10 per arm);
• lack of double blinding of participants;
• poor concealment of group allocation and
• significant levels of missing data.
’Summary of findings’ tables
We prepared ’Summary of findings’ tables, summarising the key
findings of the systematic review in line with the standard meth-
ods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We included the main outcomes
(subjective and objective improvement in sleep and daytime func-
tioning), the magnitude of effect, and the amount and quality of
evidence. We used the GRADE approach to assessing the quality
of the body of evidence. The findings are presented by antide-
pressant group (SSRI, TCA, other antidepressants). There were
insufficient data to pool results for SSRIs compared with placebo
so these were presented as a narrative description.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The initial biomedical database searches (to July 2015) identified
6719 references, 4245 of which remained after deduplication. We
excluded 4025 references on assessment of title and abstract; re-
trieved 220 full-text papers for full inspection; excluded 183 of
these full-text papers; extracted data for 37 studies, but at this stage
excluded another 14 studies, as on further inspection they did not
meet our inclusion criteria; leaving 23 studies (23 references) in-
cluded in the final qualitative descriptions and quantitative anal-
yses.
In keeping with MECIR conduct standard C37, we ran searches
within 12 months of publication. The update searches (2016
and 2017) identified 1073 references and, after screening these,
we identified 10 studies of interest. Eight of these were placed
in ’Studies awaiting classification’ (see Characteristics of studies
awaiting classification table) and two were added to ’Ongoing
studies’ (bringing the total to three)(see Characteristics of ongoing
studies table). These studies will be incorporated in an update of
this review, as appropriate.
We contacted 14 authors of included papers and six key trialists
in the research field for additional information or information on

 ongoing trials by email with at least one follow-up request. Five
of the six key trialists responded, but identified no other ongoing
trials. Three of the trial authors responded, but could not locate the
additional information requested (Le Bon 2003; Reynolds 2006;
Ware 1989).
The PRISMA flow diagram, which includes search results to July
2015 (only) is in Figure 1.
Included studies
The review included 23 studies (Corruble 2013; Fava 2002;
Finnerty 1978; Friedmann 2008; Gillin 1997; Hajak 2001;
Khazaie 2013; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Lankford 2012; Le
Bon 2003; Palomaki 2003; Reynolds 2006; Riemann 2002; Rios
Romenet 2013; Roth 2011; Rush 1998; Satterlee 1995; Shell
2012; Stein 2012; Walsh 1998; Ware 1989; Zhou 2002) (see
Characteristics of included studies table).
One trial required translation from Chinese (Zhou 2002).
Design
All studies were randomised and all but one (Rios Romenet 2013)
were double-blind. Three trials followed up participants for less
than four weeks, 13 followed up for four to eight weeks, four
followed up for eight to 24 weeks and three followed up for more
than 24 weeks.
Sample sizes
The mean number of participants per study was 125 with a min-
imum sample size of 16 and a maximum of 324.
Setting
Fifteen of the included trials were conducted in the USA, two in
Germany, one in Finland, one in Canada, one in Belgium, one
in Iran and one international trial. Twenty-one trials recruited
outpatients and two recruited inpatients (Palomaki 2003; Zhou
2002).
Participants
The studies used a range of diagnostic criteria/scores for insom-
nia: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) Criteria or ICSD Criteria (or both DSM and ICSD)
(Hajak 2001; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Lankford 2012; Le Bon
2003; Reynolds 2006; Riemann 2002; Roth 2011; Rush 1998;
Walsh 1998); PSQI (Friedmann 2008; Stein 2012); Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression - Sleep disturbance factor (HRSD
or HAM-D) (Corruble 2013; Fava 2002; Gillin 1997; Palomaki
2003; Satterlee 1995), Global Sleep Assessment Questionnaire
(GSAQ) (Khazaie 2013); history of sleep disturbance (Finnerty
1978; Shell 2012; Ware 1989); minimal Scales for Outcomes
in Parkinson’s disease (SCOPA) sleep nocturnal subscore and six
months of insomnia (Rios Romenet 2013); Chinese Classification
of Mental Disorders (CCMD-2-R) for chronic primary insomnia
(Zhou 2002).
The mean age of participants was 47.3 years. The mean age in the
included studies ranged from 26 to 73 years.
Four studies specified recruiting older adults or elderly participants
(aged more than 65 years: Krystal 2010; Lankford 2012; 60 to 80
years: Zhou 2002; more than 50 years: Reynolds 2006).
On average, most participants were women. The mean proportion
of women was 60%.
Some studies reported other diagnoses (in addition to insomnia):
seven reported a diagnosis of depression (Corruble 2013; Fava
2002; Finnerty 1978; Gillin 1997; Rush 1998; Satterlee 1995;
Ware 1989); three were in people with substance abuse, two were
in people with alcohol detoxification (Friedmann 2008; Le Bon
2003), one with methadone administration (Stein 2012). One
study recruited inpatients with acute ischaemic stroke (Palomaki
2003). One studyrecruitedoutpatientswith idiopathicParkinson’s
disease (Rios Romenet 2013). One study recruited women in the
third trimester of pregnancy (Khazaie 2013).
Interventions
Three studies compared SSRIs with placebo; two used paroxetine
(Reynolds 2006; Zhou 2002), and one used fluoxetine (Satterlee
1995).
One study compared the SSRI paroxetine with alprazolam (Zhou
2002).
One study compared SSRIs with each other (fluoxetine, sertraline
and paroxetine) (Fava 2002).
Three studies compared SSRIs with another antidepressant
(agomelatine, nefazodone) (Corruble 2013; Gillin 1997; Rush
1998).
SixstudiescomparedTCAswith placebo, five useddoxepin(Hajak
2001; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Lankford 2012; Rios Romenet
2013), and one used trimipramine (Riemann 2002). One study
compared doxepin with lormetazepam (Riemann 2002), one dox-
epin with imipramine (Finnerty 1978), and one imipramine with
trimipramine (Ware 1989).
Eight studies compared ’other’ antidepressants with placebo (one
mianserin (Palomaki 2003); seven trazodone (Friedmann 2008;
Khazaie 2013; Le Bon 2003; Roth 2011; Shell 2012; Stein 2012;
Walsh 1998). One study compared an ’other’ antidepressant (tra-
zodone) with another insomnia medication (zolpidem) (Walsh
1998).
Outcomes
The studies used a range of different outcome scales: PSQI (Buysse
1989), ISI (Morin 2011), HRSD or HAM-D (Hamilton 1960),
global satisfaction with sleep scores and VAS.

 Excluded studies
We excluded 18 studies (from all search results to 2017). Eleven
studies were excluded as part of the full analysis (searches to July
2015).
• Two studies were read in full, but then excluded after
discussion with Cochrane as tryptophan was excluded from the
list of includable antidepressants (Adam 1979; Ferrero 1987).
Tryptophan is a supplement not an antidepressant.
• Seven studies did not, on careful reading, fulfil the criteria
for a primary diagnosis of insomnia (Botros 1989; Boyle 2012;
Chen 2002; Fairweather 1997; Kaynak 2004; Moon 1991;
Stephenson 2000).
• Two studies had fewer than three days/nights of
intervention treatment (Roth 2007; Scharf 2008).
See the Characteristics of excluded studies table for details.
Studies awaiting classification
There are eight studies awaiting classification (Ahmed 2016;
Ivgy-May 2015a; Ivgy-May 2015b; Krystal 2012; Merck 2008;
Miljatovic 2012; Shirazi 2016; Wu 2015). See the Characteristics
of studies awaiting classification table for details.
Ongoing studies
We identified three ongoing studies: Morin 2015 comparing a
behavioural intervention with trazodone or zolpidem in 82 par-
ticipants in the USA with 12 months’ follow-up; NCT02139098
comparing amitriptyline 50 mg, zolpidem and placebo in 150
participants in Germany; and ChiCTR-IPR-16009475 compar-
ing trazodone, alprazolam, quetiapine and zolpidem. See the
Characteristics of ongoing studies table for details.
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias across all studies is shown in Figure 2 and Figure
3. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias across most bias
domains. Only four of the 20 studies did not meet criteria for low
risk of bias related to at least one type of bias (Gillin 1997; Krystal
2010; Walsh 1998; Zhou 2002). All studies that had some level
of high risk only did so for one or two bias domains, with the
majority only carrying risk in one domain. Overall, the risk of bias
analysis revealed that no studies were high risk, that is carried a
high-risk profile over all or most bias domains.

 Random sequence allocation (selection bias)
One study showed high risk of bias (Shell 2012). This trial re-
cruited a disproportionate amount of participants from certain
sites because of higher enrolment at these sites, which is likely to
have caused uneven randomisation. The remaining trials were at
low or unclear risk of selection bias.
Allocation
Rios Romenet 2013 was at high risk of selection bias due to block
randomisation. The remaining trials were at low or unclear risk of
selection bias. Most studies provided no data on allocation con-
cealment.
Blinding
In terms of successful blinding of participants and personnel, Rios
Romenet 2013 did not administer placebo tablets, instead they
administered red light as placebo. The use of this condition as
placebo means that participants were not blinded to the type of
treatment they received (high risk of bias). The remaining trials
were at low or unclear risk of performance bias. All trials were at
risk of low or unclear detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
A higher proportion of studies showed incomplete outcome data
that is likely to reflect high risk of bias. Five studies found an
elevatedproportionof participantsdidnotcomplete the trial (26%
to 74% of enrolled participants) (high risk of bias; Fava 2002;
Finnerty 1978; Reynolds 2006; Roth 2011; Zhou 2002). Seven
studies did not follow an intention-to-treat principle (high risk of
bias; Finnerty 1978; Krystal 2010; Khazaie 2013; Le Bon 2003;
Reynolds 2006; Walsh 1998; Ware 1989). Either elevated rates of
incomplete data or not adhering to the intention-to-treat principle
may result in an under-representation of participants with severe
illness or adverse effects, therefore inflating the positive results
of the study. The remaining trials were at low or unclear risk of
attrition bias.
Selective reporting
One study showed high risk of bias (Finnerty 1978). This study
used the Finnerty-Goldberg scale to assess sleep disturbance, but
the findings were not reported in full. The majority of studies
showed unclear risk of bias as the relationship between prespecified
primary outcomes and the results were not always clearly defined.
Other potential sources of bias
Regarding other forms of bias that may influence the outcomes,
sponsorship bias could be evaluated across all 23 studies. Ten stud-
ies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and evidenced no
attempt to report the findings as independent to the interests of
the company (e.g. by using an external company to control the
blinding of participants or analyse the data (Corruble 2013; Fava
2002; Hajak 2001; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Le Bon 2003;
Rush 1998; Satterlee 1995; Walsh 1998; Ware 1989). Hence,
these 10 studies reflect a high level of sponsorship bias. Three
of the eight studies evidencing low sponsorship bias were funded
by pharmaceutical companies, but showed independence of the
results through using external companies for blinding and data
analysis. Studies that showed an unclear level of sponsorship bias
often included a vague disclosure statement that made reference to
a pharmaceutical company, but the relationship as drug provider
or sponsor of the study remained ambiguous. Only two studies
included no disclosure statement (Finnerty 1978; Zhou 2002).
With regard to bias unrelated to sponsorship, Friedmann 2008
reported that participants in the trazodone group believed more
than participants in the placebo group that they were taking ac-
tive medication. Although this bias in perception may be expected
with taking medication such a trazodone, it has the potential to
change the outcomes of the study. Furthermore, the adherence to
medication is questionable in this study, because there is a large
discrepancy between the adherence percentages reported by au-
tomatic recording (37% to 43%) in comparison with self-report
(82% to 83%).

’Other’ antidepressants compared with placebo for insomnia
1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
1.1. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus placebo
Three studies comprising 135 participants compared an SSRI with
a placebo (Reynolds 2006; Satterlee 1995; Zhou 2002). The study
results could not be pooled as Satterlee 1995 reported no standard
deviations (SD)/standard errors and Zhou 2002 reported all the
elements of the PSQI as separate items. However, we provide a
descriptive analysis below.

 Primary outcomes
1.1.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
Satterlee 1995 examined change from baseline to eight weeks on
the HAM-D sleep subscale in participants randomised to fluoxe-
tine orplacebotreatment. The change frombaseline was2.5 points
in the fluoxetine group and 1.8 points in the placebo group.
Reynolds 2006 reported the subjective sleep quality from the Pitts-
burgh Diary-based Measures of participants treated with paroxe-
tine compared to placebo. The authors observed a small difference
between the groups over the six-week study period favouring the
paroxetine group (P = 0.03).
Zhou 2002 did not report sleep quality.
1.1.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
Zhou 2002 found significantly improved total sleep time com-
pared to placebo at 12 weeks (P < 0.001).
1.1.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
Zhou 2002 found significantly improved total sleep onset latency
compared with placebo at 12 weeks (P < 0.001).
1.1.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
Zhou 2002 found significantly fewer awakenings after sleep onset
in the paroxetine group compared with placebo at 12 weeks (P <
0.001).
1.1.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed).
Zhou 2002 found significantly improved total sleep efficiency
compared with placebo at 12 weeks (P < 0.001).
1.1.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
No studies reported safety data.
Secondary outcomes
1.1.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
Only Reynolds 2006 collected PSG data.
1.1.7.1. Sleep latency
Compared with the placebo group, the paroxetine group took
significantly longer to fall asleep (P = 0.04).
1.1.7.2. Sleep efficiency
There was no significant difference in the sleep efficiency of the
paroxetine group compared with the placebo group.
1.1.7.3. Total sleep time
The study did not report total sleep time.
1.1.7.4. Waking time after sleep onset
The waking time after sleep onset was significantly reduced in the
paroxetine group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.02).
1.1.7.5. Rapid eye movement latency
The study did not report rapid eye movement (REM) latency.
1.1.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
Reynolds 2006 reported an improvement in daytime alertness
in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group (P =
0.008).
1.2. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus other
insomnia medication
Only one study compared an SSRI (paroxetine) with another in-
somnia medication (alprazolam), with 30 participants randomised
to each intervention (Zhou 2002).

 Primary outcomes
1.2.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The study reported the sleep parameters of the PSQI at the end of
12weeks. There wasasignificantdifference betweenthe paroxetine
and alprazolam groups at the 5% level in favour of paroxetine.
1.2.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
The paroxetine group reported that the mean total sleep time
increased by 3.7 hours (SD 1.1). The total sleep time increased by
1.6 hours (SD 0.6) in the alprazolam group. This difference was
significant at the 1% level.
1.2.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
Mean time to falling asleep was shorted by 64 minutes (SD 28) in
the paroxetine group compared with 50 minutes (SD 22) in the
alprazolam group.
1.2.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
Time awake reduced by 1.6 hours (SD 0.5) in the paroxetine group
and by 0.8 hours (SD 0.9) in the alprazolam group.
1.2.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed).
Sleep efficiency improved by 40 percentage points (SD 22) in
the paroxetine group compared with 23 points (SD 18) in the
alprazolam group.
1.2.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
There were no serious adverse effects reported in either group.
Two participants dropped out of the paroxetine group and four
dropped out of the alprazolam group because of adverse effects.
Secondary outcomes
1.2.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
The study did not record objective measures of change in sleep.
1.2.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
The study did not record effect on daytime symptoms/function-
ing.
1.3. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus other
antidepressant
Three studies compared an SSRI with another antidepressant
medication in 489 participants with depression and insomnia
(Corruble 2013; Gillin 1997; Rush 1998).
Primary outcomes
1.3.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The three studies using different scales were combined to assess
subjective improvement in sleep quality. Where more than one
time point was reported, results were pooled for the end point of
the study. Corruble 2013 reported the PSQI at 24 weeks, Gillin
1997 reportedthe HAM-DateightweeksandRush 1998 reported
the HDRS at eight weeks. There was no significant difference in
measure of sleep quality between SSRIs and other antidepressants
(SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.50; I2 = 78%; Analysis 1.1), but
the level of heterogeneity was high.
1.3.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
None of the studies reported subjective measure of total sleep
duration.
1.3.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
One study reported a subjective measure of sleep onset latency, but
found no differences between escitalopram and agomelatine with
respect to time taken to fall asleep at 12 and 24 weeks (Corruble
2013).

 1.3.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
None of the studies reported subjective measure of number of
nocturnal awakenings.
1.3.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
None of the studiesreportedsubjective measuresof sleepefficiency.
1.3.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Three studies reported adverse events (Corruble 2013; Gillin
1997; Rush 1998). There was no difference in effect between SSRI
treatment and other antidepressant treatment (RR 1.36, 95% CI
0.76 to 2.44; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.2).
Secondary outcomes
1.3.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
Rush 1998 reported EEG data on sleep latency. The mean in
the nefazodone group was 23.8 (SD 33.1) and the mean in the
fluoxetine group was 31.4 (SD 37.7) at eight weeks’ follow-up.
Gillin 1997 and Rush 1998 both reported sleep efficiency per-
centages for comparisons of nefazodone versus fluoxetine. There
was a small effect in favour of nefazodone (MD -7.55, 95% CI -
10.54 to -4.56; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.3).
1.3.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
Corruble 2013 used a VAS to record daytime symptoms, “feeling
good” and “daytime sleepiness.” At 24 weeks, the mean change
from baseline for the “feeling good” scale in the escitalopram group
was 38.0 (SD 34.0) and in the agomelatine group was 40.7 (SD
31.9). For the daytime sleepiness scale, the mean change from
baseline for the escitalopram group was -32.3 (SD 32.5) and for
the agomelatine group was -29.5 (SD 34.2).
1.4. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus other
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
One study compared the effectiveness of three SSRI medications,
fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline, against one another (Fava
2002). Based on the HAM-D score at baseline, there were 119
participants with an insomnia diagnosis (34 fluoxetine, 41 sertra-
line and 44 paroxetine).
Primary outcomes
1.4.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The change from baseline scores on the sleep disturbance scale of
the HAM-D indicated no differences in effect between the three
groups. Both the fluoxetine and sertraline groups experienced a
change from baseline of 3.1 points (SD 2.0). The change from
baseline for the paroxetine group was 2.9 (SD 2.4).
1.4.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
The studydidnotrecordsubjective measure of total sleepduration.
1.4.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
The study did not record subjective measure of sleep onset latency.
1.4.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
The study did not record subjective measure of number of noc-
turnal awakenings or total nocturnal awakening time.
1.4.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed).
The study did not record subjective measure of sleep efficiency.
1.4.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Adverse events were not reported separately for the participants
with an insomnia diagnosis.
Secondary outcomes
1.4.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram data)
The study did not record objective measures of change in sleep.

The study did not record effect on daytime symptoms/function-
ing.
2. Tricyclic antidepressants
2.1. Tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo
Six studies (812 participants) examined the effectiveness of TCAs
compared with placebo: three in primary insomnia (Hajak 2001;
Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Lankford 2012; Riemann 2002), and
one in insomnia associated with Parkinson’s disease (Rios Romenet
2013).
Primary outcomes
2.1.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
Five studies measured subjective sleep quality. Krystal 2010;
Lankford 2012; and Rios Romenet 2013 reported the ISI. These
were at 12 weeks in the Krystal 2010 study and at six weeks in
Lankford 2012 and Rios Romenet 2013. Riemann 2002 reported
the PQSI at four weeks. Hajak 2001 used a VAS to assess sleep
quality at four weeks; however, this was not included as it was not
possible to accurately read the figures from the graph provided.
The results for the remaining four studies with 518 participants
were pooled. The results indicated that sleep quality was signifi-
cantly better in the TCA groups than in the placebo groups (SMD
-0.39, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.21; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.1).
2.1.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
Two studies reported subjective total sleep time at follow-up (
Krystal 2010; Lankford 2012). This was four weeks for Lankford
2012 and 12 weeks for Krystal 2010. There was no significant
difference in total sleep duration between the TCA group and the
placebo group (MD 31.68 minutes, 95% CI -12.40 to 75.77; I2
= 91%; Analysis 2.2), but there was a high level of heterogeneity.
Krystal 2010 also reported total sleep time at four weeks’ follow-
up. When we pooled the studies at four weeks’ follow-up rather
than at the end point, the results remained unchanged with no
significant difference in reported total sleep time between the TCA
group and the placebo group (MD 22.98 minutes, 95% CI -4.98
to 50.93; I2 = 76%; Analysis 2.2).
2.1.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
One study reported subjective measure of sleep onset latency (
Krystal 2010). At week 12, the score in the placebo group was 55.5
(SD 39.5). In the doxepin groups, the score was 37.5 (SD 22.8)
in the doxepin 1 mg group and 39.9 (SD 30.3) in the doxepin 3
mg group. This showed an effect in favour of doxepin compared
with placebo for both groups (doxepin 1 mg: P = 0.046; doxepin
3 mg: P = 0.003).
2.1.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
One study reported a subjective measure of waking time after sleep
onset (Lankford 2012). There was a difference in favour of the
doxepin 6 mg group compared to the placebo group at four weeks
with lower mean waking time after sleep onset in the doxepin
group (mean 66.5, SD 43.9) compared with placebo (mean 78.9,
SD 56.5) (P < 0.01).
2.1.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
None of the studies examined subjective measure of sleep effi-
ciency.
2.1.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Six studies reported the incidence of adverse effects and events
(Hajak 2001; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Lankford 2012;
Riemann 2002; Rios Romenet 2013). The pooled results in
showed no difference in the number of adverse effects between
TCAs and placebo (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21; I2 = 34%;
Analysis 2.3).
Secondary outcomes
2.1.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
Four studies reported objective measures of change in sleep mea-
sured by EEG (Hajak 2001; Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011; Riemann
2002). They included sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep
time, waking time after sleep onset and REM percentage.
20
Antidepressants for insomnia in adults (Review)

 2.1.7.1. Sleep latency
Four studies reported EEG data on sleep latency time. The pooled
analysis showed no significant difference in sleep latency time be-
tween TCA and placebo (MD -4.27, 95% CI -9.01 to 0.48; I2 =
0%; Analysis 2.4).
2.1.7.2. Sleep efficiency
Four studies reported EEG data on sleep efficiency. The results
indicated improved sleep efficiency in the TCA group compared
with placebo (MD 6.29, 95% CI 3.17 to 9.41; I2 = 0%; Analysis
2.5).
2.1.7.3. Total sleep time
Four studies reported total sleep time. The pooled analysis indi-
cated a longer total sleep time in the TCA group compared with
placebo (MD 22.88 minutes, 95% CI 13.17 to 32.59; I2 = 0%;
Analysis 2.6).
2.1.7.4. Waking time after sleep onset
Three studies reported waking time after sleep onset (Hajak 2001;
Krystal 2010; Krystal 2011). Waking time was lower in the TCA
group than the placebo group (MD -14.63 minutes, 95% CI -
25.99 to -3.27; I2 = 75%; Analysis 2.7); however, there was a high
level of heterogeneity. This may be because the results in Hajak
2001 expressed wakings after sleep onset as a percentage of sleep
time.
2.1.7.5. Rapid eye movement latency
Two studies reported REM latency (Hajak 2001; Riemann 2002).
The pooled analysis indicated that the TCA group spent more
time in REM latency than the placebo group (MD 26.37 minutes,
95% CI 7.94 to 44.80; I2 = 0%; Analysis 2.8).
2.1.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
One study reported changes in daytime fatigue and cognitive func-
tioning (Rios Romenet 2013). There was a significant improve-
ment in daytime functioning on the Krupp Fatigue Severity Score
in the doxepin group compared with placebo (P = 0.02) and in
cognitive functioning Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in
the doxepin group compared with placebo (P = 0.007). Riemann
2002 reported on the “feeling rested in the morning” subscale of
the SF-A scale. The placebo group had a mean score of 2.82 (SD
1.05) at four weeks compared with 3.08 (SD 0.72) in the TCA
group (P = 0.02)
2.2. Tricyclic antidepressants versus other insomnia
medication
One study reported the effects of a TCA compared to another
insomnia medication, comparing trimipramine to lormetazepam
(Riemann 2002). There were 19 participants in the trimipramine
group and 18 in the lormetazepam group.
Primary outcomes
2.2.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The mean PSQI score at four weeks was 8.39 (SD 3.36) in the
lormetazepam group and 9.39 (SD 3.35) in the trimipramine
group (P = 0.13) indicating no difference in effect between the
groups.
2.2.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
The studydidnotreportsubjective measure of total sleepduration.
2.2.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
The study did not report subjective measure of sleep onset latency.
2.2.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
The study did not report subjective measure of number of noc-
turnal awakenings or total nocturnal awakening time.
2.2.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed).
The study did not report subjective measure of sleep efficiency.
2.2.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Six participants (33.3%) in the lormetazepam group reported 13
adverse events. In the trimipramine group, the rate of adverse
events was significantly higher with 15 participants (78.9%) re-
porting 42 adverse events.

 Secondary outcomes
2.2.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
The study reported PSG results at four weeks. None of the differ-
ences in these objective measures were different between groups.
2.2.7.1. Sleep latency
Sleep latency was 26.31 minutes (SD 33.61) in the lormetazepam
group and 23.34 minutes (SD 24.45) in the trimipramine group
(P = 0.68).
2.2.7.2. Sleep efficiency
Sleepefficiency was 86.25% (SD 8.05) in the lormetazepam group
and 84.53% (SD 15.20) in the trimipramine group (P = 0.22).
2.2.7.3. Total sleep time
Total sleep time was 408.61 minutes (SD 47.29) in the in the
lormetazepam group and 406.13 minutes (SD 77.25) in the trim-
ipramine group (P = 0.11).
2.2.7.4. Waking time after sleep onset
The study did not report waking time after sleep onset.
2.2.7.5. Rapid eye movement latency
There was no difference in REM latency in the lormetazepam
group, with a mean of 82.86 minutes (SD 44.14) compared with
125.21 minutes (SD 117.23) in the trimipramine group (P =
0.45).
2.2.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
There was a significant difference in “feeling rested in the morn-
ing” as measured by the SF-A scale (P = 0.02). The mean at four
weeks in the lormetazepam group was 2.92 (SD 0.87) and in the
trimipramine group was 3.08 (SD 0.72).
2.3. Tricyclic antidepressants versus other antidepressant
One study compared doxepin with imipramine in depressed
people with insomnia (Finnerty 1978). There were 71 partici-
pants randomised to doxepin and 68 participants randomised to
imipramine.
Primary outcomes
2.3.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The mean score on the sleep disturbance factor of the Hamil-
ton Depression scale at four weeks was 0.4 in both groups. The
Finnerty-Goldberg Sleepscale was also used. Although the authors
presented no data, they stated there was no statistically significant
difference between groups.
2.3.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
The studydidnotrecordsubjective measure of total sleepduration.
2.3.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
The study did not record subjective measure of sleep onset latency.
2.3.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
The study did not record subjective measure of number of noc-
turnal awakenings or total nocturnal awakening time.
2.3.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
The study did not record subjective measure of sleep efficiency.
2.3.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
There were 45 doxepin-treated participants and 44 imipramine-
treated participants who experienced adverse effects. In the dox-
epin group, 75% of these adverse effects were “mild to moderate”
while the figure was 82% in the imipramine group.

information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
The study did not record effect on daytime symptoms/function-
ing.
2.4. Tricyclic antidepressants versus other tricyclic
antidepressants
One study compared trimipramine with imipramine in depressed
people with insomnia (Ware 1989). There were 15 participants
randomised to the trimipramine group and 19 participants ran-
domised to the imipramine group.
Primary outcomes
2.4.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
Participants reported their sleep quality on a Likert scale from 1
“not at all” to 4 “extremely.” The change from baseline to 30 days
was 0.4 in the trimipramine group and 0.5 in the imipramine
group.
2.4.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
The mean change from baseline to 30 days was 1.1 hours in the
trimipramine group and 0.7 hours in the imipramine group. There
was no overall difference between the groups, but there was an
interaction between drug and study day (P < 0.01). There was an
immediate increase in hours of sleep in the trimipramine group
while the improvement in the imipramine group was more grad-
ual.
2.4.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
The mean score in the trimipramine group improved by 25 min-
utes in the 30 days from baseline and the score in the imipramine
group improved by 7 minutes. There was a statistically significant
interaction between the drug and the study day (P < 0.01). For
the both groups, sleep latency improved in the first two weeks, but
this was maintained only in the trimipramine group.
2.4.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
The study did not record subjective measure of number of noc-
turnal awakenings or total nocturnal awakening time.
2.4.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
The study did not record subjective measure of sleep efficiency.
2.4.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Two imipramine-treated participants dropped out of the study
because of adverse reactions. During the first two weeks, there were
significantly fewer adverse reactions in the trimipramine group (P
= 0.02). The authors reported that this was not due to any one type
or class of adverse reaction and that none of the adverse reactions
were serious.
Secondary outcomes
2.4.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
2.4.7.1 Sleep latency
Sleep latency improved by 16 minutes from baseline in the trim-
ipramine group, but the imipramine group reported taking an ad-
ditional 7 minutes to fall asleep (P < 0.01).
2.4.7.2 Sleep efficiency
There was significant greater (P < 0.01) sleep efficiency in the
trimipramine group, where the change from baseline was 0.12,
compared to the imipramine group, where the change was -0.06.

 2.4.7.3 Total sleep time
The trimipramine group increased their total sleep time by 55
minutes compared to a decrease in total sleep time of 28 minutes
in the imipramine group (P < 0.01).
2.4.7.4 Waking time after sleep onset
There was a decrease of nine in the percentage to time awake
after sleep onset in the trimipramine group over the 30-day period
compared to an increase of eight in the imipramine group (P <
0.01).
3.1.7.5 Rapid eye movement latency
There was a mean increase in REM sleep latency of 183 minutes
in the imipramine group compared with an increase of only 3
minutes in the trimipramine group (P < 0.01).
3.1.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
The study did not report the effect on daytime symptoms/func-
tioning.
3. ’Other’ antidepressants
3.1. ’Other’ antidepressants versus placebo
Three studies provided useable data on other antidepressants ver-
sus placebo; two in primary insomnia (Roth 2011; Walsh 1998),
and one in opiate dependence with insomnia (Stein 2012). All
looked at trazodone versus placebo in 370 participants. Shell 2012
(in insomnia), Friedmann 2008 and Le Bon 2003 (in abstinent
alcoholics with insomnia), and Khazaie 2013 (in women during
the third trimester of pregnancy) also examined trazodone versus
placebo, but did not provide sufficient data for it to be included
in the pooled results. Palomaki 2003 looked at mianserin versus
placebo in people with stroke with insomnia, but did not provide
extractable data for pooled analysis.
Primary outcomes
3.1.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
Three studiesprovideddataonasubjective measure of sleepquality
thatcouldbe pooled. Stein 2012 measuredthe PSQIatsixmonths.
Walsh 1998 included a subjective rating of sleep quality at two
weeks. Roth 2011 used VAS to measure “difficulty sleeping” at
seven days. There was a slight improvement in subjective sleep
quality in the trazodone group compared with placebo (SMD -
0.34, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.02; I2 = 49%; Analysis 3.1) (Figure 4).
Figure 4.
Forest plot of comparison: 3 ’Other’ antidepressants versus placebo, outcome: 3.1 Subjective
measure of sleep quality.
Friedmann 2008 reported improved sleep quality in the trazodone
group compared to placebo as measured by the PSQI at one and
three months, but there was no significant difference at six months.
Shell 2012 reported no significant difference between the tra-
zodone and placebo group at 14 days’ follow-up.
Palomaki 2003 reported a significant effect on the three sleep items
of the HDRS in favour of mianserin compared to placebo at two
months (P = 0.02), but by six months there were no longer any
differences between groups.
3.1.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
One study reported subjective total sleep time (Stein 2012). The
total sleep time in the trazodone group was 406.1 minutes and in
24

 the placebo group was 389.4 minutes (P = 0.67).
3.1.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
One study reported subjective sleep latency (Stein 2012). The
trazodone group averaged 36.6 minutes and the placebo group
averaged 38.5 minutes (P = 0.69).
3.1.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
Two studies examined the total number of nocturnal awakenings
(Stein 2012; Walsh 1998). There were significantly fewer awak-
enings in the trazodone group compared with the placebo group
(MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.11; I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.2).
3.1.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
One study reported a subjective measure of sleep efficiency (Stein
2012). In the trazodone group, the mean sleep efficiency was
84.5% while in the placebo group, it was 81.6% (P = 0.87), sug-
gesting no difference between the groups.
3.1.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
Walsh 1998 reported that two placebo-treated and five trazodone-
treated participants withdrew as a result of adverse events. The
intervention group reported significantly more adverse effects than
the placebo group.
Le Bon 2003 reported hangovers in five participants and dizziness
in two participants in the trazodone group compared to hangovers
in one participant, headache in two participants and skin irritation
in one participant in the placebo group.
Secondary outcomes
3.1.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
3.1.7.1. Sleep latency
Roth 2011 reported no difference in sleep latency, with 26.2 min-
utes (SD 28.6) in the trazodone group compared with 24.5 min-
utes (SD 18.7) in the placebo group (P = 0.556).
Le Bon 2003 reported no difference in sleep latency, with 53 min-
utes in the trazodone group compared with 26 minutes in the
placebo group.
3.1.7.2. Sleep efficiency
Two studies reported sleep efficiency (Roth 2011; Stein 2012.
These results were pooled and there was no significant difference
between trazodone and placebo (MD 1.38, 95% CI -2.87 to 5.63;
I2 = 0%; Analysis 3.3). Le Bon 2003 also reported an improvement
in sleep efficiency in the trazodone group compared to placebo (P
= 0.015).
Khazaie 2013 reported significantly improved sleep efficiency in
the trazodone group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.0001)
at six weeks, but no significant difference at two weeks.
3.1.7.3. Total sleep time
One study reported total sleep time (Stein 2012). This was 355.9
minutes in the trazodone group and 344.1 minutes in the placebo
group (P = 0.62). Le Bon 2003 reported no difference in total sleep
time. This was 340 minutes in the trazodone group compared to
314 minutes in the placebo group.
Khazaie 2013 reported significantly longer total sleep time in the
trazodone group compared to placebo at six weeks (P < 0.0001),
but no significant difference at two weeks.
3.1.7.4. Waking time after sleep onset
Roth 2011 reported no difference in waking time after sleep onset
with 52.9 minutes (SD 54.9) in the trazodone group compared
with 74.3 minutes (SD 61.1) in the placebo group (P = 0.401).
Le Bon 2003 reported improved wake to sleep onset in the tra-
zodone group (3%) compared to the placebo group (12%) (P =
0.015).
3.1.7.5. Rapid eye movement latency
In Roth 2011, REM latency was 93.0 (SD 53.1) in the trazodone
group compared with 84.3 (SD 40.8) in the placebo group (P
= 0.385). In Le Bon 2003, REM latency was 98 minutes in the
trazodone group compared with 81 minutes in the placebo group.
Neither study showed a significant difference between the groups.

 3.1.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
Walsh 1998 reported that daily morning ratings of sleepiness did
not differ among groups at any time point, neither did ratings of
disruption at work or in social and family life. Friedmann 2008 re-
ported morning drowsiness in 20 (31.3%) participants in the tra-
zodone group and 32 (48.5%) participants in the placebo group.
The difference was borderline significant (P = 0.05). Khazaie 2013
reported daytime sleepiness in the trazodone group, but none of
the participants discontinued treatment.
3.2. ’Other’ antidepressants versus other insomnia
medications
One study compared trazodone and zolpidem (Walsh 1998). It in-
cluded 91 trazodone-treated participants and 90 zolpidem-treated
participants. The primary comparison was between active treat-
ments and placebo, therefore limited data were available to com-
pare trazodone to zolpidem, but the authors did indicate where
comparisons found no significant differences.
Primary outcomes
3.2.1. Subjective measure of sleep quality
The study used a subjective rating of sleep quality at two weeks
and indicated no significant difference between the groups.
3.2.2. Subjective measure of total sleep duration
There were no significant differences between the trazodone and
zolpidem groups with respect to subjective total sleep duration.
3.2.3. Subjective measure of sleep onset latency (measured as
time taken to fall asleep)
There were no significant differences between the trazodone and
zolpidem groups with respect to subjective sleep onset latency.
3.2.4. Subjective measure of number of nocturnal awakenings
or total nocturnal awakening time
There were no significant differences between the trazodone and
zolpidem groups with respect to total nocturnal awaking time.
3.2.5. Subjective measure of sleep efficiency (measured as a
ratio of time asleep over time in bed)
The study did not report subjective measure of sleep efficiency.
3.2.6. Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and
measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity
The study reported that five zolpidem-treated and five trazodone-
treated participants withdrew as a result of adverse events. There-
fore, there were no significant differences between groups.
Secondary outcomes
3.2.7. Objective measures of change in sleep (such as
electroencephalogram/polysomnography data)
The study did not report objective measures of change in sleep.
3.2.8. Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported
information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning
Daily morning ratings of sleepiness did not differ among the
groups at any time point, neither did ratings of disruption at work
or in social and family life.
Subgroup analyses
Diagnosis of depression or anxiety
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
Five studies included people with a depression or anxiety diagnosis
(Corruble 2013; Fava 2002; Gillin 1997; Rush 1998; Satterlee
1995). Satterlee 1995 did not provide data that could be pooled
as no SDs could be obtained. However, this study also found no
statisticallysignificantdifference. Fava 2002 comparedthree SSRIs
with one another and found no difference in effect. The remaining
three studies are those pooled in Analysis 1.1.
Tricyclic antidepressants
Only one study in this category included people with a depres-
sion or anxiety diagnosis (Finnerty 1978). It found no differences
between groups (see Section 2.3. Tricyclic antidepressants versus
other antidepressant).
26

 Recorded physical comorbidity (e.g. back pain)
Data regarding comorbid conditions was fairly limited. Only
two studies attributed a known health condition to participants
(Palomaki 2003; Rios Romenet 2013), but did not provide data
that could be extracted for analysis. Therefore, it was not possible
to conduct an analysis for this subgroup.
Low dose
The only studies in which low doses were employed were trials in
which the intervention was doxepin and compared it to placebo.
Within this subgroup, three studies used a low dose, while only
one (Riemann 2002) used a higher dose. Hajak 2001 also used
a higher dose, but it was not possible to extract data from the
VAS for this study. The three low-dose studies echoed the findings
above for all TCA versus placebo. The results for the single higher-
dose study was in the same direction. In this small sample, there
was no evidence of the effect varying by dose (test for subgroup
differences: Chi2 = 0.86, degrees of freedom (df) = 1 (P = 0.35),
I2 = 0%).
Sensitivity analyses
Lack of blinding
Only one study was at high risk of bias due to non-blinded assign-
ment (Rios Romenet 2013). Excluding this study from Analysis
2.1. changed the overall result very little from SMD -0.39 (95%
CI -0.56 to -0.21) to SMD -0.38 (95% CI -0.57 to -0.19) and
did not change the inferences: the subjective sleep quality was im-
proved in the TCA group compared with the placebo group.
Poor concealment
One study was at high risk of bias due to poor concealment as
no placebo tablets were given (Rios Romenet 2013). However, as
stated in the sensitivity analysis above, excluding this study did not
alter the inferences of the comparison between TCA and placebo.
Low numbers
The protocol defined low numbers as fewer than 10 per arm. One
study had only six participants per arm (Rios Romenet 2013).
Excluding this study did not alter the inferences of the comparison
between TCA and placebo.
Missing data
Five studies were at high risk of bias due to a large proportion of
the outcome data being missing. These were Fava 2002 (27%),
Finnerty 1978 (30%), Reynolds 2006 (26%), Roth 2011 (74%)
and Zhou 2002 (27%). Of these, only Roth 2011 was included
in a pooled analysis. Excluding this study from the comparison
of ’other antidepressants versus placebo’ changes the effect from
SMD -0.34 (95% CI -0.66 to -0.02) to SMD -0.22 (95% CI
-0.44 to -0.01). This did not alter the overall inference of the
comparison, which favoured “other antidepressants” over placebo.
Reporting bias
One study was at high risk of reporting bias and was not included
in pooled data analysis (Finnerty 1978).

Summary of main results
Searches conducted to July 2015 identified 4245 references; 220
were screened in full text and 23 studies with 2806 participants
were included in the review. The included studies did not report
all the outcomes that were prespecified in the protocol.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
We foundverylowqualityevidence comparingSSRIswith placebo
(Summary of findings for the main comparison). Three studies
including 135 eligible participants compared SSRIs with placebo.
Combining results was not possible due to reporting differences.
Two paroxetine studies showed significant improvements in sub-
jective sleep measures at six and 12 weeks. There was no differ-
ence in the fluoxetine study. One study also reported PSG results
and a daytime function outcome. There was increased objectively
measured sleep latency and reduced waking after sleep onset in the
paroxetine group, and increased subjective daytime alertness.
One study with 60 participants and a significant risk of bias com-
pared an SSRI with another insomnia medication. The paroxetine
group showed significantly lower sleep onset latency and waking
during the night, and significantly greater total sleep time and
sleep efficiency, compared with alprazolam. There were no serious
adverse effects reported in either group.
We found very low to moderate quality evidence comparing an
SSRI with another antidepressant. Three studies compared SSRI
(escitalopram or fluoxetine) with agomelatine or nefazodone, all
were conducted in people with major depressive disorder who
also had insomnia. Combining these studies of 489 participants,
Analysis 1.1 measures of subjective sleep quality showed hetero-
geneity was high so it was not possible to infer a clear effect when
comparing SSRIs with other antidepressants. Objective results
from PSG recordings showed that sleep efficiency and sleep onset
latency improved in the nefazodone groups and worsened slightly
in the fluoxetine groups (Analysis 1.3). There were no differences
between drug groups on measures of daytime function reported.
One study compared three different SSRIs in major depression
with insomnia (fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline) and found
no difference on sleep measured by HAM-D sleep items.
In all the SSRI studies, adverse events were either not reported, or
showed similar low rates between drug and placebo, or between
different drugs (Analysis 1.2).
Tricyclic antidepressants
We found low to moderate quality evidence comparing TCAs
with placebo (Summary of findings 2). Six studies (812 partici-
pants) compared a TCA with placebo (five used doxepin, one used
trimipramine). We found no studies of amitriptyline. Four stud-
ies (518 participants) with moderate quality evidence could be
pooled showing significant improvement in subjective sleep qual-
ity compared with placebo (Analysis 2.1). PSG measurements of
objective sleep, with moderate quality evidence, showed increased
sleep efficiency (Analysis 2.5), longer sleep time (Analysis 2.6),
and decreased waking during the night (Analysis 2.7). Two studies
reported changes in daytime function. They reported significant
improvements in fatigue and cognitive function in the doxepin
group compared with placebo, and an increase in feeling rested in
the morning and well-being in the evening after trimipramine.
There was no significant difference in reported adverse effects or
events between TCAs and placebo, though the quality of the evi-
dence was low.
Three studies compared a TCA with another medication. One
study compared doxepin with lormetazepam, one compared dox-
epin with imipramine and one compared trimipramine with
imipramine. None revealed significant differences on secondary
outcomes, but in one study, the trimipramine group showed more
improvement than the imipramine group.
’Other’ antidepressants versus placebo or other
insomnia medications
We found very low to moderate quality evidence comparing other
antidepressants with placebo (Summary of findings 3). Eight stud-
ies compared other antidepressants with placebo (one used mi-
anserin; seven used trazodone). Three trazodone studies (370 par-
ticipants) provided extractable data of moderate quality indicat-
ing improvement in subjective sleep outcomes for trazodone over
placebo (Analysis 3.1). One study of trazodone measured PSG and
foundasignificanteffectof trazodone todecrease night-time awak-
enings (Analysis 3.2) and sleep efficiency (Analysis 3.3). Three tra-
zodone studies reported on adverse events or effects in trazodone
groups compared to placebo groups (i.e. ’morning grogginess,’ and
increased dry mouth), but quality was low and there were insuffi-
cient data to draw inferences.
Where possible, we performed subgroup analyses, but data were
limited and thus the results must be treated with caution. The
subgroup analyses detected no consistent influence of the degree
of depression or anxiety at baseline assessment, the presence of
comorbid physical ill-health, or drug dosage (Analysis 4.1).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
A concertedandrepeatedsearch of the publishedliterature resulted
in the identification of 23 eligible studies and repeated attempted
contact with researchers in the field generated no additional rele-
vant studies. The final database included seven studies with SSRIs,
eight studies with TCAs, no studies with MAOIs and eight studies
with ’other’ antidepressants (seven used trazodone and one used
mianserin). The studies displayed a broad range of methodologies,
employed a wide array of subjective (questionnaires, scales, diaries)
32

 and objective (PSG or ’sleep EEG’) outcome measures, at a variety
of end points and came from different settings and patient groups
(including comorbid drug and alcohol misuse and parkinsonism).
Insomnia was not the primary inclusion criterion for participants
in some of the papers, where the main focus was on another di-
agnosis such as depression or anxiety. The sleep outcomes were
not always the primary outcome measure for the research and the
sleep data were sometimes presented in a limited way that made
data extraction challenging. When there were sufficient studies
with broadly similar design to permit group analysis, there was
sometimes significant heterogeneity between studies, so rendering
the findings difficult to interpret.
Our risk of bias assessments (conducted independently by two
review authors, any disagreements assessed and determined by
a third review author) reveal that while most studies were not
assessed to have a high risk of bias overall, quite a few had an
unclear level of bias for several categories. This was particularly so
for allocation concealment. Five studies were at high risk of bias
for incomplete data outcomes and eight studies at high risk of bias
for sponsorship.
The included trials had a variety of reporting methods and end
points and it was sometimes not possible to fully extract useable
data for the published paper that could be combined (e.g. when
VAS were presented in the papers). In this case the authors were
always contacted (often several times) to request further clarifi-
cation or data. Only three authors responded and unfortunately
they were unable to provide the requested additional data.
This review and meta-analysis reveals a limited evidence base on
which to make inferences about the potential value or otherwise of
antidepressant drugs for managing people with primary insomnia
(now known as insomnia disorder). The studies identified were
typically small with design limitations or unclear assessments of
bias, which make it difficult to identify reliable findings and to
draw robust conclusions. What was clear was that published trials
provided no evidence to support the long-term use of an antide-
pressant drug in the management of people with primary insom-
nia. There is some evidence to support the short-term use of some
TCAs (low-dose doxepin) or trazodone, but insufficient evidence
to support the short-term use of an SSRI. There was no evidence
or amitriptyline, which is one of the most commonly prescribed
antidepressants for insomnia in clinical practice.
Our review found evidence for a small, but significant advantage
for TCA over placebo on subjective assessment of sleep quality
(pooled data from four studies). However, it should be noted that
the pooled TCA studies were all of doxepin, which is a drug used
in depression at doses between 75 mg/day and 300 mg/day. At
these higher doses, it is an inhibitor of reuptake of noradrenaline
and serotonin, which is how it probably exerts its antidepressant
action. However, in the studies included in this review doxepin was
used at very low doses (1 mg, 3 mg and 6 mg), at which it blocks
histamine receptors but has very little action on other receptors or
reuptake. It is probable that this antihistamine action underlies its
effects in the studies of insomnia included in the meta-analysis in
this review (Wilson 2010). Doxepin is now licensed in the USA
(but not in Europe) for the treatment of insomnia at doses of 3
mg and 6 mg at night.
The data on tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia
was similarly limited, with many papers not reporting these out-
comes. Where pooling of data was possible (SSRI compared with
other antidepressants and TCA compared with placebo) there were
no significant differences in tolerability and safety, but the overall
quality of this evidence was low. In other settings, TCA are known
to have significant tolerability problems and are potentially fatal if
taken in overdose (Wilson 2010). As such it currently inadvisable
to recommend the use of a TCA for the short-term treatment of
people with primary insomnia, even though this is an approach
that seems to be commonly adopted in clinical practice.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, the quality of the evidence included in this review was
very low to moderate on the GRADE evidence profile. Thus,
the estimates of effect should be considered uncertain as further
research could change the estimate of effects and the degree of
confidence for its applicability in clinical practice.
For SSRIs, data could be pooled when compared with other an-
tidepressants, but not when compared with placebo or other in-
somnia medications. Three studies contributed to the subjective
measures of sleep quality pooled data. These were RCTs, but had
serious risks of bias because of lack of information in the papers
on randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. Hetero-
geneity was also high at 78%. Thus, the quality of evidence was
downgraded to low. For adverse event and sleep efficiency data
there were very wide CIs and for sleep efficiency there was also
small numbers of participants, but heterogeneity was not high.
Thus, these outcomes had a low GRADE quality assessment.
For TCA, data could be pooled when compared with placebo, but
not when compared with other insomnia medications or other an-
tidepressants. Four studies contributed to the subjective measures
of sleep quality pooled data. These were RCTs, but had serious
risks of bias because of lack of information in the papers on ran-
domisation, allocation concealment and blinding. Heterogeneity
was not high. This gave a moderate GRADE quality assessment.
For adverse event and sleep efficiency data there were very wide
CIs and for sleep efficiency there was also small numbers of par-
ticipants giving a low GRADE quality assessment.
For other antidepressants, data could be pooled when compared
with placebo, but not when compared with other insomnia medi-
cations or other antidepressants. Three studies contributed to the
subjective measures of sleep quality pooled data. These were all
RCTs of trazodone but had serious risks of bias because of lack of
information in the papers on randomisation, allocation conceal-
ment and blinding. Heterogeneity was not high. This gave mod-
erate GRADE quality assessment. For sleep efficiency data there
33

 were wide CIs and small numbers of participants giving a low
GRADE quality assessment.
Potential biases in the review process
Potential limitations of this review include identification, assess-
ment and data extraction of eligible studies and antidepressant
categorisation.
The Cochrane Common Mental Disorders group assisted us with
a rigorous database search to ensure a robust search strategy and
identification of as many potentially eligible studies as possible.
Key trialists and authors in the research field were also contacted
to ask for any additional studies they were aware of (either pub-
lished or underway). However, there is still a risk of publication
bias with RCTs particularly of those with negative outcomes. A
significant number of studies found were published more than
15 years ago, before the advent of robust clinical trial registries
and a number were funded by pharmaceutical companies. There
may be unpublished studies that we have not identified. There
were insufficient studies to perform a funnel plot to assess publi-
cation bias. A potential additional source of bias could be a fail-
ure to identify papers in populations with secondary insomnia,
where sleep disturbance was measured as a secondary outcome,
and where the sleep outcomes were reported in the full text of
the paper but not clearly identified in the abstract, key words or
database subject headings. Our focus was on a clear definition of
insomnia at baseline rather than just reports of sleep disturbance.
Our search terms were sensitive for insomnia but did not search
for vaguer terms such as sleep disturbance. One way to explore if
there was potentially valid additional data published would be to
consider increasing the sensitivity of the search by including terms
for sleep/sleep disturbance together with terms for comorbid con-
ditions where insomnia is most prevalent.
We attempted to include as many trials as possible and included
a range of definitions of insomnia and comparator treatments:
placebo; medications for insomnia (such as short-acting benzodi-
azepines, and so-called ’Z-drugs’); other antidepressants; waiting
list control and treatment as usual. Antidepressant medications
were included at all doses and there was no restriction of eligibility
for comorbidities. Indeed, many of the included trials were un-
dertaken in populations with a primary diagnosis of depression or
anxiety and we extracted reported data on those with an defined
insomnia disorder in addition. After discussion with the Cochrane
Mental Health group, trials of tryptophan were excluded as it was
deemed a dietary supplement rather than an antidepressant. Tri-
als involving quetiapine were excluded as it was deemed an an-
tipsychotic rather than an antidepressant. Trials with fewer than
three days of drug treatment were also excluded as it was deemed
that clinically important effects of antidepressants on insomnia
(by definition a long-term condition) required more than a one or
two doses of an antidepressant to be able to determine the effect.
There were a small number of studies included in the pooled meta-
analyses. These were analysed as per the protocol, using a random-
effects model. However, with small numbers of studies, a fixed-
effect model may provide more robust estimates of effect. Future
updates to this review will include a sensitivity analysis using the
fixed-effect approach.
For this review, antidepressants were grouped as described in the
protocol into traditional classes such as TCAs, SSRIs and other
antidepressants. This traditional antidepressant categorisation has
acknowledged limitations due to the varying mechanisms of ac-
tions (i.e. reuptake inhibitors and modulators, receptor blockers
and enzyme inhibitors) and there has been the been some debate
in recent years regarding alternative nomenclatures and classifica-
tions. In particular, our category ’other’ antidepressants included
a range of disparate antidepressants and combining these in meta-
analysis could have been questioned. In the review, due to the data
available, all the pooled data in the ’other’ antidepressant group
relate to a single antidepressant (trazodone).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Analyses from this study concur with other published reviews and
papers highlighting the paucity of evidence for the use of antide-
pressants for insomnia and the need for further high-quality trials,
while acknowledging the limited evidence for the short-term use
of some antidepressants (Buscemi 2007; Wilson 2010).
Buscemi 2007 included eight RCTs of antidepressants (doxepin,
trazodone, trimipramine and pivagabine) compared with placebo
forinsomniadurationof one night tofive weeks, which the authors
describedasmoderate qualityonthe Jadadscale. PSGdatawere the
mainoutcome measures. Theyreportedthatthese studiesfavoured
antidepressants (weighted mean difference (WMD) PSG, sleep
onset latency -7.0 minutes, 95% CI -10.7 to -3.3), but sleep diary
results were ’fewer and non-significant’ (WMD sleep diary, sleep
onset latency -12.2 minutes, 95% CI -22.3 to -2.2). They included
three studies that reported safety and they reported a significant
increased risk of harm in the antidepressant group compared with
placebo (risk difference 0.09) with the most commonly reported
adverse events being somnolence, headache, dizziness and nausea.
Our results agree with the conclusions of this systematic review:
there is some evidence for short-term use of some antidepressants
(particularlytrazodone anddoxepin)forinsomnia, butthatthere is
paucityof dataandthatfurtherstudiesare neededtoestablish long-
term safety and efficacy and to determine if they are equivalent in
efficacy to benzodiazepines and ’Z’ drugs.
Mayers 2005 published a systematic review that included RCTs
assessing the impact on sleep of antidepressants when compared
with placebo or other antidepressants, but did not require a pri-
mary diagnosis of insomnia and did not perform any meta-anal-
yses. They reported that antidepressants were associated with dif-
34

 fering effects in sleep profiles with variations within and between
classes.
Krystal 2009 published a compendium of placebo-controlled trials
of the risks/benefits of pharmacological treatments for insomnia.
This paper highlighted the lack of data on the efficacy and safety
in antidepressants and documented only RCTs in doxepin and
trazodone.
Thaler 2012 identified six head-to-head trials (involving 1061 par-
ticipants) of the effect of second-generation antidepressants on in-
somnia in people with depression, but only two of the included
trials required an initial diagnosis of insomnia. They reported the
strength of the evidence to be low to moderate, being weakened by
inconsistency and imprecision, but concluded the evidence sug-
gested that the SSRIs did not differ with regards to their effect on
insomnia.

Implications for practice
This comprehensive literature search identified only a small num-
ber of studies with short-term follow-up on the use of antidepres-
santsformanagingprimaryinsomnia. The findingsof the included
studies provide only equivocal data supporting short-term use for
some tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin in low dose), and for tra-
zodone, but with no evidence to support long-term use. There was
no evidence for amitriptyline despite its common use in clinical
practice, or to support long-term antidepressant use for insomnia.
Current research evidence does not support the widespread prac-
tice of prescribing antidepressants for insomnia. Health profes-
sionals and patients should be made aware of the current paucity
of evidence for antidepressant medications commonly used for in-
somnia management. Increased access to, and provision of, other
evidenced based ways to manage insomnia should be explored,
such as increased access to psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive
behavioural therapy for insomnia).
Implications for research
There is a need for randomised placebo-controlled trials of an-
tidepressants within the setting of primary medical care. Previous
studies have many identified risks of bias and a number of design
limitations. These should be avoided in a new study by ensur-
ing that the trial is independent, of sufficient size to permit some
participant attrition, with adequate power to be able to generate
reliable findings, and with prespecified primary subjective (rather
than objective) outcome measures. The study design should in-
clude assessments of the balance of benefit and risk after both
acute treatment (arguably at four to eight weeks) and continua-
tion treatment (arguably at between 26 and 52 weeks) and should
include robust data collection regarding adverse effects. Because
of the common somatic and psychiatric comorbidity of insomnia,
the study design should permit the inclusion of people in whom
insomnia is comorbid with physical illness or mental disorder (or
both), with sensitivity analyses to take account of the influence of
coexisting medical conditions.

Corruble 2013
Methods
Randomised, double-blind, controlled trial (flexible dose)
Participants
Insomnia diagnosis criteria (method of diagnosis): no formal diagnosis of insomnia
made; however, baseline scores of HAM-D sleep component, VAS sleep measures and
PSQI scores indicate baseline insomnia. We reported on subset of 187 participants with
high levels of sleep complaints (PSQI ≥ 13 at baseline)
Other diagnoses: MDD
Number of participants randomised: 324 total; 187 in the insomnia subgroup which
represented 57.7% of randomised participants
Agomelatine: n = 164
Escitalopram: n = 160
Number of participants:
Agomelatine: n = 144 completed 12 weeks; n = 124 completed 24 weeks
Escitalopram: n = 137 completed 12 weeks; n = 115 completed 24 weeks
Age, mean (SD) years:
Agomelatine: 43.6 (12.9)
Escitalopram: 42.8 (11.8)
Gender (M/F):
Agomelatine: 26.8%/73.2%
Escitalopram: 31.3%/68.7%
Race/ethnicity: not reported
Country: international study with 51 centres across Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
Russia, South Africa and the UK
Setting: multiple outpatient centres
Included: people with single or recurrent episode of MDD for ≥ 4 weeks with or
without melancholic features based on HAM-D 17 total score ≥ 22, CGI-S score ≥
4 or HADS ≥ 11. HAM-D 17 score had to be stable between selection and inclusion
(decrease < 20%), without seasonal pattern, without psychotic features and without
catatonic features. Participants were required to be physically healthy or to have stabilised
significant illnesses on the basis of medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG
and clinical laboratory tests
For insomnia subgroup: PSQI ≥ 13
Excluded: MDE with seasonal pattern or psychotic features; chronic MDE (> 2 years);
bipolar I or II disorder; MDD superimposed on dysthymic disorder; current panic disor-
der; OCD; PTSD; acute stress disorder; schizoaffective or any other psychotic disorder;
neurological disorders or severe or uncontrolled organic disorders. Exclusion criteria also
included transaminases values > 2 times ULN, alkaline phosphatase > 3 ULN or total
bilirubin > 34 µmol/L or positive plasma β-hCG or a combination of these; alcohol or
drug abuse or dependence within the past 12 months; any personality disorder, and risk
of suicide. People were excluded if they had not responded to an appropriate dose of
2 different previous antidepressant treatments (54 weeks), if they had received insight-
oriented and structured psychotherapy (within 3 months), light-therapy started (within
2 weeks), oral antipsychotic drugs (within 4 weeks), neuroleptics at low dose (within

2 weeks), depot neuroleptics (within 6 months), electroconvulsive therapy (within 3
months). The washout periods were as follows: antidepressants (1 week), non-selective
MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants (2 weeks) and fluoxetine (5 weeks). Hypnotics,
anxiolytics and neuroleptic agents were prohibited during the study and before inclusion
depending on their half-life
Withdrawals:
Agomelatine: n = 20 at 12 weeks; n = 13 at 24 weeks
Escitalopram: n = 23 at 12 weeks; n = 15 at 24 weeks
Baseline imbalances: no obvious differences noted
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the subgroup (187 insomnia partici-
pants) were not different from those observed in the set of randomised participants
Date study undertaken: July 2007 - September 2008
Interventions
Intervention: agomelatine 25 mg per day taken in the evening (± 8 p.m.), increased to
50 mg per day in case of insufficient improvement. Increase started from week 2 onwards
Comparator: escitalopram 10 mg per day taken in the evening (± 8 p.m.), increased to
20 mg per day in case of insufficient improvement. Increase started from week 2 onwards

Trimipramine: 10/9
Lormetazepam: 9/9
Placebo: 13/5
Race/ethnicity: white
Country: Germany
Setting: outpatients; 12 sleep disorders clinics located at psychiatry university hospitals
Included: aged 18-70 years; insomnia diagnosis according to DSM-III-R criteria for ≥
1 month; bedtime 11 p.m. ± 60 min
Excluded: serious organic disease excluded by urine test, blood test, EEC, ECG, medical
and neurological examination; any current or lifetime psychiatric disorder excluded by
psychiatric examination and MADRS < 20; pregnancy or risk of pregnancy; sleep apnoea
(apnoea index > 5/hr); period leg movements during sleep (> 5/hr)
Withdrawals: n = 9
Trimipramine: n = 3 (adverse events n = 2; reversal of previous diagnosis n = 1)
Lormetazepam: n = 3 (lack of efficacy of drug n = 2; reversal of previous diagnosis n = 1)
Placebo: n = 3 (lack of efficacy of drug n = 2; withdrawal of consent n = 1)
Baseline imbalances: imbalance of M:F ratio in the placebo group. Number of males
much higher in placebo group
Interventions
Intervention 1: trimipramine; self-administered a flexible dose of 50-200 mg prior to
bedtime. Dose titrated according to participant reported efficacy as follows: day 1-2: 25
mg; day 3-4: 50 mg; day 5-6: 75 mg; day 7-9: 100 mg; day 10: 150 mg; day 11-28: 200
mg
Dosage could be varied starting on day 4 according to the reported effectiveness of the
drug. Hence, trimipramine dosage at the end of the study could vary from 50 mg to 200
mg
Intervention 2: lormetazepam 1 mg at night-time
Comparator 1: placebo; self-administered a flexible amount of tablets from 1-4 in the
evening prior to bedtime. In practise, all participants took 4 tablets
Comparator 2: lormetazepam; self-administered a flexible amount of tablets in the
evening prior to bed-time. The first tablet contained lormetazepam 1 mg. Because the
wording was unclear, it was not evident whether this was 1-4 tablets although the dosage
remained the same for all participants

Methods
Randomised, double-bind, 4-armed, controlled trial
Participants
Insomnia diagnosis criteria (method of diagnosis): history of sleep disturbance lasting
> 6 weeks and defined by perceived lack of restorative sleep
Other diagnoses: none
Number of participants randomised: n = 111
Trazodone: n = 36
Sentra PM: n = 28
Sentra PM + trazodone: n = 22
Placebo: n = 25
Number of participants: n = 110 (the participant who did not complete the trial was
carried forward as ITT)
Age, range: 18-75 years. No results on actual age of those recruited or gender. Data not
available for each arm
Gender: not reported
Race/ethnicity: not reported
Country: USA
Setting: 12 independent sites around the USA
Included: men and non-pregnant and non-lactating women aged 18-75 years with
history of sleep disturbance lasting > 6 weeks and defined by perceived lack of restorative
seep were enrolled by the study physician in each site
Excluded: people currently taking tricyclic antidepressants; who had previously taken
Sentra PM, trazodone or another amino acid formulation; with biochemical abnormal-
ities that would put the person at risk or invalidate study findings
Withdrawals: n = 1 (included as ITT)
Baseline imbalances: uneven randomisation occurred due to higher enrolment rates
at some of the clinical sites; however, this did not affect the statistical outcome of the
study. Authors state that table 2 demonstrated that the 4 study groups were “statistically
comparable” at baseline
Interventions
Intervention 1: trazodone 50 mg daily at bedtime + 2 capsules Sentra-like placebo at
bedtime
Comparator 1: placebo (1 trazodone-like placebo and 2 Sentra-like placebo at bedtime
Comparator 2: Sentra PM alone (a neurotransmitter based medical food) 2 capsule dose
at bedtime + 1 trazodone-like placebo at home
Comparator 3: Sentra PM 2 capsule dose + trazodone 50 mg at bedtime

Insurance Table, pregnancy or risk of becoming pregnant, and lactation. Recent history
of drug addiction, alcoholism or drug abuse; history of sensitivity to CNS depressants,
regular use of any medication that would interfere with the study, use of any investiga-
tional drug within 30 days of study entry and previous use of zolpidem precluded partic-
ipation. Benzodiazepines or non-prescription sleep medication had to be discontinued
for (mean 177 SD) 7 ± 25 days, depending upon duration of action. Finally, a positive
urine drug screen for CNS-active drugs, participation in a weight loss programme, shift
work or any other regularly changing sleep schedule, precluded study participation

Participants
Insomnia diagnosis criteria (method of diagnosis): diagnosed with primary insomnia (according to the DSM-IV)
≥ 1 month before study entry
Number of participants randomised: n = 419
Number of participants: n = 366
Ezmirtazapine 3.0 mg: n = 117
Ezmirtazapine 4.5 mg: n = 124
Placebo: n = 125
Age range, years: 18-65
Gender (of those randomised):
Esmirtazapine 3.0 mg: 40/93 F
Esmirtazapine 4.5 mg: 48/85 F
Placebo: 45/87 F
Race/ethnicity: mixed
Country: US and Canada
Setting: 43 outpatient research clinics
Included: aged 18-65 years and diagnosed with primary insomnia, that is, according to the DSM-IV, ≥ 1 month
before study entry. They also had to fulfil the following PSG criteria on 2 screening/baseline PSG nights: mean TST
< 6.5 hr (and ≥ 3 and < 7 hr on both nights), WASO ≥ 45 min (and ≥30 min on both nights), and LPS ≥ 15 min
(and ≥ 10 min on both nights)
Excluded: other sleep or circadian disorders, current or recent history of depression, history of substance abuse, other
conditions potentially causing sleep disturbances and drugs known to affect the sleep-wake function (e.g. anxiolytics,
sedatives, antidepressants, antipsychotics and centrally acting antihistamines)
Withdrawals: data from 1 of the sites (n = 15) were not included in the efficacy analysis due to concerns about the
eligibility of participants; based on audit findings, concerns were raised about the credibility of the data
Ezmirtazapine 3.0 mg: n = 22 (AEs n = 11, withdrew consent n = 3, lack of compliance n = 1, reasons unrelated to
study n = 4, other n = 3)
Ezmirtazapine 4.5 mg: n = 14 (AEs n = 5, withdrew consent n = 2, lack of compliance n = 3, reasons unrelated to
study n = 1, other n = 3)
Placebo: n = 11 (AEs n = 2, withdrew consent n = 4, lost to follow-up n = 1, other n = 4)
Baseline imbalances: overall, the treatment groups were well balanced with respect to baseline demography and
clinical characteristics, although there were slightly fewer white participants in the esmirtazapine 3.0 mg group

Outcomes
Primary outcomes
Participant-reported sTST, SL, number of awakenings, WASO, sleep quality and satisfaction with sleep duration
(mean of weekly values and over entire 6-week period); and ISI scores and the Investigator’s Global Rating (mean at
days 15 and 36)
Rebound was assessed using PSG (days 43 and 44) and sleep diary data (days 43-49) during the run-out period.
Withdrawal was assessed using the Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms Questionnaire, completed at base-
line, and on days 36 and 50. This is a 20-item questionnaire completed by participants; each symptom was rated as
absent (0), moderate (1) or severe (2), and the maximum possible score is 40
Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, routine laboratory pa-
rameters and electrocardiograms. Residual daytime effects of treatment assessed using the Bond-Lader rating scale; a
morning alertness VAS; data on daytime functioning, energy levels and napping (recorded in an electronic question-
naire completed in the evening); and a digit symbol substitution test on the mornings following PSG assessments
Secondary outcomes
PSG was conducted at the end of days 1, 15 (week 2) and 36 (week 5). Participants also completed an electronic
sleep diary each morning during the treatment period
Primary end point was PSG-measured WASO, and the key secondary end point was PSG-measured LPS (mean at
days 1, 15 and 36). Other secondary efficacy end points were: TST, number of awakenings, WASO per quarter of
the night and sleep architecture (PSG-assessed; mean of entire 6-week period and mean at days 1, 15 and 36 for
WASO per quarter)

within the last year; night workers or rotating shift workers or plan to travel through more than 3 time zones; routinely
nap during the day; body mass index ≥ 36
Interventions
Intervention: esmirtazapine 4.5 mg once a day for 6 months
Comparator: placebo tablets once a day for 6 months
Outcomes
Primary outcome
Change from baseline in TST over 6-months. TST was defined as the time recorded for sleep diary question 6 “How
much time did you actually spend sleeping?” as reported by participants using a LogPad (hand-held electronic data
capture device). Baseline was defined as the mean TST from the placebo run-in period. Change from baseline was
calculated as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using LOCF approach
Secondary outcomes
Number of participants who experienced AEs up to 31 weeks. AE defined as any unfavourable and unintended
change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body whether or not considered related to study drug. Number
of participants who experienced AEs was combined for 6-month treatment period and the 7-day discontinuation
period
Number of participants who discontinued study drug due to an AE up to 27 weeks. An AE defined as any unfavourable
and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body whether or not considered related to study
drug. Number of participants who discontinued study drug due to an AE was combined for the 6-month treatment
period and the 7-day discontinuation period
Change from baseline in SL in 6-month treatment period (baseline and mean of weeks 14-26). SL defined as the
time recorded for sleep diary question 3 “How long did it take you to fall asleep?”, as reported by participants using
a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean SL from the placebo run-in period. Change from baseline was calculated
as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using an LOCF approach
Change from baseline in WASO in 6-month treatment period (baseline and mean of weeks 14-26). WASO defined
as the time recorded for sleep diary question 5 “How much time were you awake, after falling asleep initially?”, as
reported by participants using a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean WASO from the placebo run-in period.
Change from baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using an LOCF approach
Other outcome measures
Change from baseline in NAW in 6-month treatment period (baseline and mean of weeks 14-26). NAW defined as
the number of times recorded for sleep diary question 4a “How many times did you wake up during the night?”, as
reported by participants using a LogPad. Baseline was defined as the mean NAW from the placebo run-in period.
Change from baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using an LOCF approach
Change From baseline in sleep quality in 6-month treatment period (baseline and the mean of weeks 14-26). Sleep
quality assessed using a VAS in response to the sleep diary question 7 “Rate the quality of your sleep last night”, as
reported by participants using a LogPad. Responses could range from 0 = Very poor to 100 = Excellent, with a higher
score indicating greater sleep quality. Baseline was defined as the mean sleep quality score from the placebo run-
in period. Change from baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using an LOCF

approach
Change from baseline in satisfaction with sleep duration in 6-month treatment period (baseline and the mean of
weeks 14-26). Satisfaction with sleep duration was assessed using a VAS in response to the sleep diary question 8
“How satisfied are you about your sleep duration of last night?”, as reported by participants using a LogPad. Responses
could range from 0 = Very unsatisfied to 100 = Fully satisfied, with a higher score indicating great satisfaction with
sleep duration. Baseline was defined as the mean satisfaction with sleep duration score from the placebo run-in period.
Change from baseline was calculated as the mean of combined data from weeks 14-26, using an LOCF approach
Change from baseline in 2 aggregate measures of the SF-36 Health Survey Score in 6-month treatment period
(baseline and week 26). SF-36 is a participant-rated questionnaire that consists of 8 scaled scores: vitality, physical
functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role
functioning and mental health, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly
transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each of the 8 questions carries equal weight. The SF-36 can
be divided into 2 aggregate summary measures: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component
Summary. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating more disability. Baseline was defined as the SF-
36 score assessed at randomisations
Change from baseline in IGR in 6-month treatment period (baseline and week 26). The IGR is a clinician-rated 7-
point scale used to assess the severity of illness. Severity is rated on a scale from 1 = Normal to 7 = Extremely severe.
Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value obtained during the placebo run-in period
Change from baseline in IGR in 7-day discontinuation period.

Trials with fewer than three days of drug treatment were excluded from the review as it was deemed that clinically important effects of
antidepressants on insomnia (by definition a long-term condition) required more than one or two doses of an antidepressant to be able
to determine the effect. This three-day minimum had not been prespecified in the protocol.
We have removed the term ’primary’ from before ’insomnia diagnosis’ in the ’Type of participants’ section. ’Primary insomnia’ is now
largely outdated as terminology with the newer definition being ’Insomnia disorder.’ Our use of this terminology had created confusion
on peer review as some had interpreted it to mean that papers should only be included if the main focus of the paper was insomnia
(i.e. insomnia was the primary diagnosis reported in the title). This is not what we, the review authors, had originally intended and
would lose valuable data by excluding papers that focused on depression or anxiety, but had a clear definition of insomnia at baseline
and collected and reported good sleep outcomes. Different conditions coexist and it is most often not possible to say which is more
relevant to the patient’s overall status. It is often a question of perspective or of emphasis in the way the paper is written. We had clearly
stated a priori that participants should be included with all types of comorbidity (e.g. anxiety or depression) and insomnia and this is
what we have done in this review. The key criteria for inclusion was having a clear entry criteria of a definition of insomnia at baseline.
