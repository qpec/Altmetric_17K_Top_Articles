Abstract
Rationale, aims, and objectives:
The United States is in the midst of a public health epi-
demic with more than 40 people dying each day from prescription opioid overdoses. Health care
systems are taking steps to address the opioid overdose epidemic by implementing policy and
practice interventions to mitigate the risks of long‐term opioid therapy. Kaiser Permanente
Southern California launched a comprehensive initiative to transform the way that chronic pain is
viewed and treated. Kaiser Permanente Southern California created prescribing and dispensing
policies, monitoring and follow‐up processes, and clinical coordination through electronic health
record integration. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of these inter-
ventions and assess the impact of this set of interventions on opioid prescribing.
Method:
The study used a retrospective pre‐post evaluation design to track outcomes before
and after the intervention. Kaiser Permanente Southern California members age 18 and older
excluding cancer, hospice, and palliative care patients and this sub‐population of 3 203 880 was
approximately 75% of all Kaiser Permanente Southern California members. All data are from
Kaiser Permanente's pharmacy data systems and electronic health record collected on a rolling
basis as interventions were implemented from January 2010 to December 2015.
Results:
There were reductions in all tracked outcomes: a 30% reduction in prescribing opi-
oids at high doses; a 98% reduction in the number of prescriptions with quantities greater than
200 pills; a 90% decrease in the combination of an opioid prescription with benzodiazepines and
carisoprodol; a 72% reduction in the prescribing of Long Acting/Extended Release opioids; and a
95% reduction in prescriptions of brand name opioid‐acetaminophen products. In addition,
methadone prescribing did not increase during this period.
Conclusions:
This study adds promising results that a comprehensive system‐level strategy
has the ability to positively affect opioid prescribing. The basic components of the intervention
are generalizable and applicable to other health care settings.

 Beginning in the late 1990s, prescription opioids were increasingly
used to treat pain—with an estimated 20% of patients presenting to
physician offices with non‐cancer pain symptoms or pain‐related
diagnoses receiving an opioid prescription.2 In 2013, an estimated
1.9 million persons in the United States abused or were dependent
on prescription opioid pain medication.3 In 2015, there were more
than 15 000 deaths involving prescription opioids,* in the United
States.4 The 4‐fold increase in deaths since 1999 parallels a concomitant
increase in sales of opioid pain medications during the same period.5
Among patients receiving opioid prescriptions for pain, higher opioid
dosages are associated with increased risk of opioid overdose.6-9
A range of system‐level strategies are being explored to alleviate the
problem of inappropriate prescribing of opioids.10 Interventions include
the use of prescription drug monitoring programs,11 restricting patients
to a single pharmacy or provider,12 state pill mill laws,13 and patient and
provider education.14 In addition, in March 2016, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids
for Chronic Pain to provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for
primary care physicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside
of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end‐of‐life care.15
Health care systems are also taking steps to address this epidemic
by implementing policy and practice interventions to mitigate the risks
of long‐term opioid therapy. Since 2010, Kaiser Permanente Southern
California (KPSC) has targeted long‐term opioid therapy across multiple
settings of care. Kaiser Permanente Southern California created pre-
scribing and dispensing policies, follow‐up and monitoring pro-
cesses, organizational and clinical coordination, and information
technology integration to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing.
The Safe and Appropriate Opioid Prescribing (SAOP) program is a
clinically‐driven initiative led by physicians from primary care, pain
management, and addiction medicine departments, and pharmacy
operations. The purpose of this paper is to (1) describe the elements
of KPSC's intervention and outline the implementation process, and
(2) report on short‐ and intermediate‐outcomes.

METHODS
2.1
|
Evaluation design
Kaiser Permanente Southern California used a retrospective pre‐post
evaluation design to track these outcomes before and after the
intervention:
• Reduce prescribing large quantities (>200 pills per prescription) of
opioid‐acetaminophen combination prescriptions
• Reduce prescribing high dose opioids (≥120 mg morphine
milligram equivalent (MME) per day)
• Reduce combination prescribing of opioids with benzodiazepines
and carisoprodol
• Reduce prescribing of Long Acting (LA)/Extended Release (ER)
opioids,
specifically
OxyContin
(oxycodone‐LA)
and
Opana
(oxymorphone) and tracking prescribing of methadone as it is an
alternative long acting opioid to OxyContin and Opana
• Reduce prescribing of brand name opioids when generics are
available

Data
All patient data are from Kaiser Permanente's pharmacy data system
and electronic health record (EHR). Over 95% of patient prescriptions
are filled in Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser Permanente's Pharmacy Analyt-
ical Services Department extracted all data. All analyses are descriptive
in nature, and statistical testing was not conducted. Data were
collected on a rolling basis as interventions were implemented from
January 2010 to December 2015. Nearly all outcomes (high dose,
combination prescriptions, LA/ER opioids, generics) have pre‐interven-
tion data and post‐intervention data while other outcomes (high MME)
only have post‐implementation data. Data timeframes are noted in the
results section and included in the figures. Morphine milligram equiva-
lent calculations were based on the Centers for Medicare and Medic-
aid Services (CMS) conversion factor table.16

Patients
Kaiser Permanente Southern California is a large integrated health care
delivery system where currently over 6600 physicians in the Southern
California Permanente Medical Group provide care to 4.2 million
Kaiser Foundation Health Plan members in various inpatient and out-
patient settings, including 14 Medical Centers and 217 medical offices
with 131 outpatient retail pharmacies.17 The KPSC SAOP program
serves Kaiser Permanente members age 18 and older excluding cancer,
hospice, and palliative care patients. This patient sub‐population is
approximately 75% of the total KPSC members and grew from
2 503 883 in December 2010 to 3 203 880 in December 2015.

Intervention description
In 2010, KPSC launched SAOP to leverage multidisciplinary stake-
holders from across the organization to transform the way that chronic
pain is viewed and treated at Kaiser Permanente. The architects of
SAOP—physician specialties and pharmacists—reviewed the literature
to determine how to design a successful program. Research supports
a multi‐pronged approach rather than one single strategy and incorpo-
rating auditing and monitoring elements of continuous quality
improvement.18 Organizational support, automated decision support
systems, and tools for individual feedback are the basis of SAOP.19
*Given the recent surge in illegally‐made fentanyl, the CDC Injury Center is ana-
lyzing synthetic opioids (other than methadone) separately from other prescrip-
tion opioids. This new analysis can provide a more detailed understanding of the
increase in different categories of opioid deaths from previous years. Changing
the way deaths are analyzed seems to result in a decrease in deaths involving
prescription opioids. But, this new number is likely an undercount of deaths
related to prescription opioids, because it does not include deaths that are asso-
ciated with pharmaceutical fentanyl, tramadol, and other synthetic opioids that
are used as pain relievers. (See https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analy-
sis.html for more details).

 Less effective methods for implementing change (ie, traditional con-
tinuing medical education, didactic learning, and dissemination of
materials) were intentionally de‐emphasized.20,21
Interventions were introduced in a step‐wise approach that
allowed for refinements over time and a natural grouping of interven-
tions. Also, interventions were rolled out first in smaller medical service
areas and then adopted region wide. The interventions were standard-
ized across the region by having common reports, letters, communica-
tions, templates, and implementation instructions. A brief description
of the elements of the intervention is described in the next section.
The introduction of the interventions in years 2010 through 2015
and additional details about the efforts are in Table 1.
Organizational support:
• Obtaining strong sponsorship from senior leaders in the Medical
Group and pharmacy operations for this initiative;
• Forming a multi‐disciplinary executive team composed of physi-
cian administrative leaders, clinical leaders from primary care, pain

review
teams in each Medical Center to oversee and support review of
patients; receiving ≥120 MME per day (later reduced to ≥100
MME per day); and
• Developing opioids specialty support agreements between primary
care and specialists.
Prescribing and dispensing policies:
• Implementing a self‐imposed restriction policy for new prescribing
of OxyContin (oxycodone‐LA) and Opana (hydromorphone) to
pain management, oncology, and continuing care clinicians (pallia-
tive and hospice care);
• Adding prescriptions of OxyContin and Opana to the list of high‐
risk medications limited to a 30‐day supply, and patients are not
allowed to refill these before 30 days;
• Avoiding daily doses of methadone (an alternative long acting
opioid to OxyContin and Opana) ≥ 40 mg;†
• Instituting “Brand When Generic Available” initiative to reduce
prescribing of brand name drugs when generics are available; and
• Encouraging prescribers to schedule office visits at least once every
6 months for patients on long‐term opioid therapy (ie, prescribers were
provided an individualized list of their patients who required a visit).
Performance feedback:
• Using prescribing data to generate prescriber‐specific data on
patients with high dose opioids accompanied by treatment and taper-
ing recommendations based on best practices and clinical guidelines;
• Using EHR and prescribing data to send prescribers emails when
patients on high dose opioids have not had an office visit with
the prescribing physician in 8 months or more; and
• Instituting pharmacy calls to prescribers for high dosing to limit
prescriptions to 200 pills for opioid‐acetaminophen combination
products and to 1000 pills for any opioids for all opioids, excluding
cancer, hospice, and palliative care.
Prescriber education:
• Providing pain management continuing medical education to
prescribers on current evidence‐based pain assessment and safe
opioid prescribing practices; and
• Implementing customized education sessions at KPSC's Medical
Centers and one‐on‐one academic detailing using KPSC's leading
pain and addiction specialists.22
Decision support tools:
• Adding features to the EHR to provide medication menus, medica-
tion and safety alerts, questionnaires to inform prescribing physi-
cians of the risks, preferred and maximum doses, links to
evidence‐based guidelines, prompts for alternative treatments or
medications, and patient treatment agreements. Strived to ensure
EHR alerts and pop‐ups are optimized and do not interrupt work
flow or introduce “alert fatigue” (ie, having too many alerts which
could cause them to be ignored by prescribers); and
• Adding a link from the EHR to the California Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program called the Controlled Substance Utilization
Review and Evaluation System.

Short‐ and intermediate outcomes
Reductions were seen in all outcomes. In terms of the number of opi-
oid‐acetaminophen combination prescriptions with a quantity greater
than 200 pills, there was a 98% reduction from pre‐implementation
(2521 prescriptions) to post‐implementation (47 prescriptions). Pre‐
post implementation refers to the specific policy of limiting the number
of opioid‐acetaminophen combination prescriptions to 200, see
Figure 1. For opioid prescriptions with ≥120 mg MME per day, reduced
30% over a 32‐month period starting 8 months post‐implementation
in May 2013 to December 2015. Pre‐implementation data as of
November 2013 were not collected on this high MME measure, see
Figure 2.
Concurrent use of an opioid prescription with benzodiazepines
and carisoprodol decreased by 90% over a 14‐month period from
policy implementation in November 2014 to December 2015. The
number of pills prescribed for OxyContin‐long acting (oxycodone‐

†At the time KPSC initiated this part of the program (August 2010), there existed
several different MME conversion formulas for methadone. Kaiser Permanente
Southern California chose a conversion factor for methadone that would be
close to the 120 MME/day range, promoted by CMS. Using that, methadone
40 mg/day =120 MME/day, which at the time was the recommended maximum
daily dose. In the years since, more consensuses have been adopted on the con-
version of methadone; KPSC is in the process of adjusting the methadone max-
imum daily doses.

decreased
66%

(such
as
hydrocodone
products
including
hydrocodone‐acetaminophen,

and codeine‐acetaminophen products) declined by 95% (422 pre-
scriptions to 21 prescriptions) from policy implementation in Jan-
uary 2010 to December 2015 (see Table 2).
As
OxyContin‐long
acting
(oxycodone‐LA)
and
Opana

is important to note that methadone (an alternative long acting opioid
to OxyContin and Opana) prescribing did not increase between 2011
and 2015. The monthly prescribing rate for methadone stayed steady
at .75 with a slight increase in 2014 to .77 and then .72 in 2015.

DISCUSSION
This study adds promising results that a comprehensive system‐level
strategy has the ability to positively affect inappropriate opioid pre-
scribing. Kaiser Permanente Southern California's approach focused
on multiple levers to create prescribing and dispensing policies,
monitor processes, organizational and clinical coordination that
included information technology integration. Kaiser Permanente
Southern California saw sustained reductions in all 5 outcomes of
interest. Also, methadone (an alternative long acting opioid to
OxyContin and Opana) prescribing did not increase during this period.
All of these reductions were achieved with an ever changing patient
population over 6 years.
There are limitations to this study. First, long‐term health out-
comes were not measured (ie, improved pain management and func-
tion;
reduced
prescription
opioid
overuse,
misuse,
abuse
and
addiction; reduced complications from opioids; and reduce uninten-
tional overdose from opioids). As a next step in the research, it will
be important to document the status of these measures, report how
patient pain management and function was affected as prescribing
was reduced, and if there were any unintended consequences.
Second, there are methodological limitations such as a pre‐post
design without having a comparison group, limited availability of
pre‐implementation data, and statistical analyses were determined
to be beyond the scope of this preliminary investigation. Third, KPSC
implemented a continuous quality improvement process over 6 years.
Many of these interventions occurred simultaneously. The relative
contribution of any single intervention is unknown. Fourth, the KPSC
population is reflective of a culturally diverse and insured population
(including Medicaid, commercial, and Medicare) in southern California,
so it is possible that the findings are not generalizable to uninsured
populations or populations in other parts of the country. Despite
these limitations, important lessons learned have been gleaned
related to patient safety, multi‐disciplinary engagement and corre-
sponding responsibility, data‐driven interventions and accountability,
and generalizability.

Patient safety
Opioid prescribing should be done judiciously and with frequent deter-
mination that benefits outweigh risks. Kaiser Permanente Southern
California supported safer prescribing guidelines through policies and
procedures to exclude unsafe or high‐risk medications, doses, or
medication combinations, instituted limit quantities, restricted certain
drugs to specialists, created a limit for daily maximum opioid dose,
and created policies on early refills.
Kaiser Permanente Southern California took these steps to
enhance patient safety and effective pain management and to align
opioid prescribing with the best available science. Pain management
and addiction medicine specialists were involved in all aspects, and to
assure appropriate patient care—pain management and/or substance
abuse care. The multi‐disciplinary team approach (primary care, pain
management, addiction medicine, physical medicine, psychiatry, neu-
rology) has helped create a culture of mutual specialty support to pro-
vide patients high‐quality integrated and patient‐centered care.
Kaiser Permanente Southern California also promotes alternative
and effective non‐opioid medications, as appropriate (acetaminophen,
NSAIDs, antidepressants). This is a key part of the education and deci-
sion support provided to clinicians. Kaiser Permanente plan benefits
include access to pain management, addiction medicine (both sub-
stance abuse and rehabilitation services), and treatment alternatives,
including physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupunc-
ture/pressure, exercise programs, health education programs, and
chiropractic services.
4.2
|
Multi‐disciplinary engagement and
corresponding responsibility
Kaiser Permanente Southern California's intervention was developed
and overseen by a multi‐disciplinary team composed of physician
administrative leaders, primary care, pain management and addiction
medicine physicians, pharmacists, information technology leaders,
and education specialists. For example, in terms of clinical oversight
to review patients receiving ≥120 MME per day, each Medical Center
has a multi‐disciplinary controlled substances review team chaired by a
pharmacist or physician leader with representatives from the depart-
ments of pain management, primary care, addiction medicine, phar-
macy, psychiatry, and physical medicine. This structure provides the
critical framework needed to develop, communicate, implement, and
sustain the initiative. The intervention reinforces corresponding
responsibility of pharmacist practices. Policies and procedures were
crafted to support and recognize the important role of pharmacists.
For example, pharmacists can implement escalations based on red flag
criteria, are empowered to not fill prescriptions when there are signs of
diversion or misuse, can stop early refills, and can initiate calls to pre-
scribers who appear to have excessive dosing.
4.3
|
Data‐driven interventions and accountability
Continuous quality improvement over the 6 years—looking at data and
tracking trends was a key driver. Local multi‐disciplinary review teams
compared actual practice with policies and gave providers data on their
patients on high‐risk regimens. Comparative performance feedback
was also provided by sharing aggregate as well as provider‐specific
data. There was a commitment to develop measurement and analytic
tools to support ongoing real time identification and monitoring of high
utilizers. Through all of these touch‐points, there was a cascade of
accountability for performance improvement that emerged.
4.4

Generalizability
The basic components of KPSC's intervention—prescribing and dis-
pensing policies, provider education, clinical decision support tools,
and organizational support—are potentially generalizable and appli-
cable to other health care settings. These interventions can be done
in any setting, as long as there is leadership commitment, multi‐
stakeholder collaboration and cooperation, as well as accurate and
timely data. Certainly, the fully integrated health care delivery sys-
tem of KPSC is an important contextual factor that offers inherent
benefits to implementing a comprehensive system‐level interven-
tion. However, every health care system has its own culture and
“way of doing business” that can be harnessed to help advance a sim-
ilar initiative. While SAOP was implemented in a single region of one
state and with an insured population, it is hoped that the interven-
tions could be effective with different patient populations and in
other states. Implementing these strategies in other settings will help
assess their generalizability.
The United States is in the midst of a public health epidemic with
more than 40 people dying each day from prescription opioid over-
doses. Promising strategies such as those of KPSC demonstrate con-
crete ways to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Kaiser Permanente
Southern California's systematic and evidence‐based approach is
changing the culture of pain management and opioid prescribing by
“hard wiring” more effective, safer care into work flow through use
of decision support, alerts, protocols, collaborative and integrated
multi‐specialty care, performance feedback, and ongoing communica-
tion about safer and appropriate opioid prescribing. Combining these
strategies with efforts to collaborate with local and national efforts—
support spread of safer prescribing, enhanced continuing education
for providers, access to medication‐assisted treatment, and increased
availability, training, and use of naloxone—are ways to broaden the
potential impact of health care system strategies. Continuing efforts
to refine, evaluate, and strengthen these efforts are necessary to effec-
tively reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing.
