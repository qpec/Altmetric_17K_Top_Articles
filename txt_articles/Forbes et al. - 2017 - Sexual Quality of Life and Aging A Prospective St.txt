Abstract
Unlike other life domains, sexual quality of life (SQoL) has a negative relationship with age. This 
study disentangled the effect of age in this relationship from confounding sociocultural influences 
(e.g., the period of time in which data were collected, and cohort differences), and aimed to 
understand the roles of other sexual domains (i.e., frequency, perceived control, thought and effort 
invested in sex, and number of sexual partners). We analyzed data from the longitudinal Midlife in 
the United States study (n = 6,278; age range 20–93), which were collected between 1995 and 
2013. Repeated measures linear mixed-effects models showed that age was the most robust time-
related predictor of declining SQoL. However, after the sexual domains were included in the 
model, age had a positive relationship with SQoL, and older adults’ SQoL was differentially 
influenced by the quality—not quantity—of sex. When partnership characteristics were included 
in the model, age was no longer related to SQoL. These findings suggest that aging may be 
associated with the acquisition of skills and strategies that can buffer age-related declines in SQoL, 
particularly in the context of a positive relationship. We summarize these findings as sexual 
wisdom.

Introduction
A fulfilling sex life is important for wellbeing in adulthood, and subjectively perceived 
quality of the sexual aspects of life (sexual quality of life; SQoL) has diverse associations 
with multiple domains of functioning in English-speaking countries. For example, low SQoL 
is associated with depression, predicts instability in intimate relationships, and acts as a 
precursor to subsequent relationship distress (Mitchell et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Yeh,

 Lorenz, Wickrama, Conger & Elder, 2006). In contrast, high SQoL is associated with greater 
relationship satisfaction, love, commitment, and relationship stability across the lifespan 
(Byers, 2005; Davison, Bell, LaChina, Holden & Davis, 2009; Lindau & Gavrilova, 2010; 
Sprecher, 2002). While there is a comparative dearth of research on SQoL in older 
adulthood, some Western studies have found that older adults tend to report less sexual 
satisfaction than younger adults (e.g., Araujo, Mohr & McKinlay, 2004; Field et al., 2013; 
Lindau & Gavrilova, 2010). Preliminary evidence also suggests a specific association for 
older adults between higher SQoL and better physical health in the United States (U.S.) 
(Lindau & Gavrilova, 2010)—as well as greater life satisfaction in Israel (Woloski-Wruble, 
Oliel, Leefsma & Hochner-Celnikier, 2010). However, sexuality in aging remains a largely 
unexplored area of research (Koh & Sewell, 2015).
In the US, age has a positive relationship with the quality of other life domains such as 
marriage, work, relationships with children, and finances (e.g., Fleeson, 2004), but the 
opposite is true for SQoL: Cross-sectional research has found a negative relationship 
between age and SQoL (e.g., Balsis & Carpenter, 2004; Fleeson, 2004). This negative 
association is particularly pronounced for women (Balsis & Carpenter, 2004; Fleeson, 2004; 
Lindau & Gavrilova, 2010), which is a concern given American women report lower SQoL 
than men, regardless of age (Carpenter, Nathanson & Kim, 2009; Lindau & Gavrilova, 
2010). Understanding how and why the quality of our sex lives would diverge from other life 
domains as we age is critical for facilitating successful aging and positive sexual experiences 
across the lifespan (Woloski-Wruble et al., 2010). Past research on aging and sexuality has 
been confounded by the sociocultural influences that are intertwined with age differences 
(e.g., Araujo et al., 2004). The first step towards better understanding the relationship 
between aging and SQoL is thus to disentangle it from these factors.
Sociocultural influences on sexuality are important to consider in research with a focus on 
the effects of aging, as each generation is shaped by its sociocultural context. For example, 
the impact of the sexual revolution in the U.S.that began in the 1960s would be different for 
people who were adults during the sexual revolution (children during World War II; the 
Silent Generation), compared to people who were born after that war (i.e., Baby Boomers), 
or those born during—or after—the sexual revolution (i.e., Generation X). Indeed, past 
research found that earlier generations in North America that did not grow up with the social 
norms of the sexual revolution tended to have more conservative attitudes towards sex, even 
in midlife (e.g., Fengler & Wood, 1972). Further, the time period in which research is 
conducted is important, as age- and gender-related norms of sexuality change over time 
(e.g., Christensen & Gregg, 1970; Oliver & Hyde, 1993).
Essentially, research that aims to understand aging needs to consider three types of effects: 
(1) Differences that characterize a generation that are independent of the process of aging 
(i.e., cohort effects); (2) Changes at a particular time that affect all age groups and cohorts 
uniformly (i.e., period effects); and (3) Changes that affect all cohorts as they age, 
independent of time period (i.e., age effects) (Blanchard, Bunker & Wachs, 1977). These 
effects are intertwined and confound the interpretation of apparent age-related changes, 
particularly in cross-sectional research (Yang & Land, 2013). For example, results from a 
cross-sectional analysis might not be accurately interpreted as “Older adults have lower

 SQoL.” (an age effect) but rather as “Adults born in the 1920s have lower SQoL compared 
to those born in the 1950s” (a cohort effect). It is necessary to disentangle age, period, and 
cohort effects to determine how much of the change in SQoL over time is actually due to 
aging, and how much is due to something else—such as the particular period in history 
being analyzed or the specific cohort-related time and circumstances in which an individual 
aged (Segall, 2013). To separate these three effects, longitudinal data is required (Yang & 
Land, 2013).
In addition to determining which time-related factors drive the apparent negative relationship 
between age and SQoL, it is important to identify specific mechanisms that might account 
for between-individual differences and within-individual change in SQoL over time. The 
most likely explanation for age-related changes in subjective SQoL seems to be the 
simultaneous decline in other domains of sexuality with age. For example, population 
studies in the U.S.and UK have found that frequency and likelihood of engaging in sexual 
activity currently have a negative relationship with age from midlife onwards (Field et al., 
2013; Lee, Nazroo, O’Connor, Blake & Pendleton, 2016; Schick et al., 2010; Thomas, Hess 
& Thurston, 2015), particularly for women (Lindau et al., 2007). Older adults in the 
U.S.have also reported putting less thought and effort into their sex lives (Balsis & 
Carpenter, 2004). While older adults in the U.S.tend to report higher levels of perceived 
control or mastery in many life domains, the reverse is true for sex where older adults report 
lower levels of control over their sex lives than in their intimate relationships, health, work 
life, relationship to their children, contributions to others, or finances (Lachman & Firth, 
2004). This effect is stronger for men, who tend to have lower levels of perceived control 
over their sex lives than women (Lachman & Firth, 2004). Taken together, extant research 
suggests that these sexual domains may account for the negative relationship between age 
and SQoL, but may have different roles for men and women.
Finally, there are a variety of individual and partnership characteristics that may have a role 
in the relationships between age, gender, and sexuality. For example, international research 
over the past 20 years has found that sociodemographic characteristics—such as race (e.g., 
Huang et al., 2009), sexual minority status (e.g., Institute of Medicine, 2011), education 
(e.g., Haavio-Mannila & Kontula, 1997), marital status (e.g., Schick et al., 2010), having 
children (e.g., Hansson & Ahlborg, 2012), and religiosity (e.g., Iveniuk, O’Muircheartaigh 
& Cagney, 2016)—are related to differences in sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and/or SQoL 
for men and women. Recent research from the U.S.specifically has found that mental and 
physical health mediate age-related differences in rates of sexual activity (Huang et al., 
2009), and predict sexual satisfaction (Lindau et al., 2007; Schick et al., 2010; Wang et al., 
2015). Partnership characteristics are also influential: Having a healthy partner is important 
for SQoL in older adults in particular (e.g., Kingsberg, 2002), and relationship quality is 
central to SQoL (Byers, 2005; Sprecher, 2002). As such, these characteristics represent 
covariates to consider in our research as we aim to understand the processes involved in the 
relationship between SQoL and aging.

 The Present Study
To date, most population studies on sexuality and aging have relied on cross-sectional or 
repeated cross-sectional data (e.g., Field et al., 2013; Kontula & Haavio-Mannila, 2009; 
Lindau et al., 2007; Reece et al., 2010) and consequently have not been able to separate the 
effects of aging from the confounding period and cohort effects. The present study used data 
from the Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS), which comprises three waves of 
longitudinal data from 1995–2014 in a nationally representative sample, and includes a 
section that assesses sexual behavior and quality of life. MIDUS consequently offers a 
unique and largely unexplored opportunity to understand the complex set of interrelated 
factors that influence sexuality across the lifespan. The present study built on previous 
research and aimed to characterize the processes that influence aging and sexuality, 
specifically by disentangling the effects of aging, period, and cohort. Following this, we 
examined how age and gender intersect with other sexual domains to affect SQoL across the 
lifespan. Finally, we tested whether these relationships are contingent on sociodemographic 
and partnership characteristics. Specifically, the present study addressed six research 
questions (RQs) that contributed incrementally to our understanding of these relationships:
RQ1. Are changes in SQoL over time accounted for by age, 
period, and/or cohort effects?
RQ2. Do these effects vary for men and women (i.e., is gender a 
moderator)?
RQ3. To what extent are the age, period, and/or cohort effects 
accounted for by changes in sexual domains (i.e., perceived 
control over the sexual aspects of life, the amount of thought 
and effort put into the sexual aspects of life, frequency of sex, 
and number of sexual partners)?
RQ4. Does the role of these four sexual domains differ with 
age, and/or for men and women (i.e., are age and/or gender 
moderators for these effects)?
RQ5. Do the above relationships change after accounting for 
sociodemographic covariates of sexuality and aging (i.e., visible 
racial minority status, sexual minority status, level of education, 
living with a partner, having children, religiosity, depression, 
and physical health)?
RQ6. Do the above relationships change after accounting for 
partnership characteristics (i.e., partner health, and relationship 
quality)?

 relevant contents of the study are described below, and the methods have been detailed 
elsewhere (Radler, 2014). Briefly, MIDUS is a longitudinal study of adult development 
based on a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized, English-speaking adults 
in the U.S. It currently comprises three data collection waves (MIDUS-I, MIDUS-II, and 
MIDUS-III) each separated by nine years, on average. At MIDUS-I, beginning in 1995, 
7,108 individuals participated (51.1% female; age range 20–75 years, mean = 46.4, SD = 
13.00). MIDUS-I comprised a national random digit dialing (RDD) sample (n = 3,487) with 
an oversample in select metropolitan areas (n = 757); siblings of individuals from the RDD 
sample (n = 950); and a national RDD sample of twins (n = 1,914). The MIDUS-II sample 
(n = 4,963) included the subset of MIDUS-I participants (69.8%) who were successfully 
recontacted and agreed to participate an average of 9 years later (53.3% female; age range 
28–84 years, mean = 55.4, SD = 12.45). The MIDUS-III sample (n = 3,294) represented the 
subset of participants from MIDUS-I (46.3%) who could be recontacted and agreed to 
participate an average of 18 years later (54.9% female; age range 39–93 years, mean = 63.6, 
SD = 11.35). The attrition in MIDUS has been analyzed in detail elsewhere (Radler & Ryff, 
2010) and does not appear to fundamentally bias the representativeness of the study sample. 
All participants completed a 30-minute telephone interview at each wave, and were asked to 
complete extensive self-administered questionnaires in private and return them by mail. The 
present study focuses on content from these questionnaires.
Analytic sample—Participants were included in the present study if they reported on their 
SQoL at one or more of the waves of data collection. This resulted in a final sample of 6,278 
participants (88.3% of the full sample), including 6,072 at MIDUS-I (96.0% of the 
participants who returned questionnaires), 3,773 at MIDUS-II (93.4% of the participants 
who returned questionnaires), and 2,529 at MIDUS-III (93.1% of the participants who 
returned questionnaires). People who returned their self-administered questionnaires but did 
not provide any data on their SQoL (n = 167; 2.3% of the full sample) tended to be older 
(MMIDUS-I[SD] = 56.1[14.40], t(268.17) = 8.34, p < .0005) and were more likely to be 
female (χ2(1) = 30.20, p < .0005, φ = .06), compared to those who did report on their SQoL. 
At MIDUS-I, 95.7% of the included sample had no missing items for the purposes of the 
primary analyses in the present study (99.3% had one or zero items missing); at MIDUS-II, 
92.1% of the sample had no missing items (98.7% had one or zero items missing); and at 
MIDUS-III, 92.4% of the sample had no missing items (99.0% had one or zero items 
missing). In short, the analytic sample represented nearly all of the participants that 
completed questionnaires at each wave, and the final dataset had low levels of missing data. 
Descriptive statistics for the included participants at each wave are provided in Table 1.
Assessment
Sexual Quality of Life—SQoL was measured using a scale from “the worst possible 
situation” (0) to “the best possible situation” (10) on which participants rated “the sexual 
aspect of [their] life these days”. This item was based on Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers’ 
(1976) theoretical model of life quality, which assumes that people know and can accurately 
report on the quality of the distinct and relatively independent domains of their life (e.g., 
marriage, work, health). It was extended to include SQoL in MIDUS, and is based on 
Forbes et al.

 respondents’ own criteria for evaluating the quality of the sexual aspects of their life 
(Fleeson, 2004).
Age, Period, and Cohort Information—Age was reported by all participants at each 
wave. Age in years was centered at the mean age of all included participants at MIDUS-I 
(46.6 years) and multiplied by ten to calculate meaningful regression coefficients (i.e., the 
effect of a ten-year age difference). Period was coded as 0, 1, and 2 to represent the data 
collection periods of 1995–1996, 2004–2005, and 2013–2014, respectively. Cohort was 
coded into four historical generations based on year of birth: (1) the GI Generation included 
people who came of age in The Great Depression and World War II (WWII), and the 
veterans who fought in WWII (born 1901–1926); (2) the Silent Generation included people 
who were children during WWII, and most of those who fought in the Korean War (born 
1927–1945); (3) Baby Boomers included people born post-WWII (born 1946–1964); and (4) 
Generation X represented the generational change following the well-defined Baby Boom 
(born after 1964; 1965–1975 for the purposes of the present study). These cohorts 
represented the shared sociocultural influences that the generations experienced.
Gender—Gender was reported by all participants at each wave (coded as male [0] or 
female [1]). No participants reported gender transition over the three waves, so gender was 
treated as a constant.
Sexual Domains—Participants rated four domains of sexuality at all three waves of data 
collection: (1) perceived control over their sex life and (2) amount of thought and effort they 
put into their sex life (both rated from “none” [0] to “very much” [10]); (3) average sexual 
frequency in the past 6 months (rated from “never or not at all” [0] to “2+ times per week” 
[5]); and (4) number of sexual partners in the past year (coded as 0, 1, and “2 or more”). 
People who reported zero sexual partners in the past 12 months were also coded as zero for 
sexual frequency.
Sociodemographic Covariates of Sexuality and Aging—Sociodemographic items 
included as covariates in analyses included self-reported race (coded as White or not White 
to represent visible racial minority status); sexual minority status (heterosexual or not 
heterosexual); education (graduated high school or less, or as some college or more); 
whether they lived with a partner (yes or no); whether they had children (yes or no); 
religiosity (coded as not religious, or religious) where a participant was coded as religious if 
they reported being somewhat or very religious; depressed affect (coded as present or 
absent) was defined as feeling sad, blue or depressed all day or most of the day every day or 
almost every day for two weeks in the past 12 months, and endorsing four depression 
criteria; and self-rated physical health was rated on a 4-point scale from “poor” to 
“excellent”.
Partnership Characteristics—People in relationships reported their partner’s physical 
health (on a 4-point scale from “poor” to “excellent”) and their marital/relationship quality 
(on an 11-point scale from “worst possible” to “best possible”).

 Analyses
The mixed procedure in SPSS (version 22) was used to analyse the data. Repeated measures 
linear mixed-effects modeling was used for all six research questions, with SQoL as the 
dependent variable. All variables were assessed at all three waves, which allowed us to 
model how the dynamic effects of each variable (i.e., variable means and changes over time) 
predicted SQoL over time. Gender and race variables were held as constants. In the repeated 
component of each model, measurements across the three waves were nested within 
individuals, and individuals were nested within families to account for the non-independence 
of a given individual’s responses over time and for the non-independence of sibling and twin 
observations. The variance-covariance structure was specified as autoregressive for all 
models to allow for stronger correlations between individuals’ observations that were closer 
together in time and weaker correlations between observations that were temporally further 
apart. Individuals with missing data were included in analyses, and their responses were 
calculated based on the available data using full information maximum likelihood 
estimation; there was no imputation of missing data, and participants were included in an 
analysis if they had at least one observation for each of the independent variables. All 
models included a random intercept and a random effect for age that allowed individuals’ 
rates of change (i.e., slopes) to vary by age. The specific models we analyzed to address the 
six research questions are described in more detail below. Only the fixed effects varied 
between the models, with each research question requiring additional effects to be added to 
the model.
The age, period, and cohort models in RQ1 were compared using the Bayesian information 
criterion (BIC; lower values represent better fit) to determine which model offered the best 
fit to the data (Yang & Land, 2013). Subsequent analyses (RQ2 – RQ6) built on the best-
fitting model from RQ1 and were adjudicated based on the strength and significance of the 
fixed effects in the model (i.e., using F-tests and t-tests of the estimated fixed effects) to 
elucidate which factors predicted changes in SQoL. A significance level of .001 was used in 
all analyses to account for the large sample size and multiple comparisons. For the sake of 
brevity, we have not presented or interpreted the coefficients for the covariates (i.e., for RQ5 
and RQ6) in-text, as they are not the focus of the present study. These results are available in 
the online supplement.
Results
RQ1. Are changes in SQoL over time accounted for by age, period, and/or cohort effects?
The observed mean levels of SQoL over time show evidence for age effects in particular, as 
well as likely period or cohort effects. Figure 1 illustrates the trends in the observed means 
in three ways: (1) examining change within age groups over time, showing a decline in 
SQoL across all age groups; (2) comparing the age distributions of SQoL at the three periods 
of assessment, showing possible declines in mean SQoL with each period of assessment; and 
(3) comparing age-matched groups at the three periods of assessment, highlighting that the 
effect of age was similar within each period of assessment.

 To assess whether age, period, and cohort effects were required in a model to explain 
changes in SQoL over time, we followed the recommendations of Yang and Land (2013) to 
determine the best combination of these effects as predictors for changes in SQoL. We first 
tested a model for each effect individually, then for the effects in pairs, then with all three 
effects included in a single model (see Table 2). We selected the optimal model by BIC, 
which included age and period effects. In this model, age had a negative relationship with 
SQoL, where a ten-year difference in age was associated with a 5.0% decline in SQoL (F(1, 
4965.22) = 334.58, p < .001). Period was also a significant predictor of SQoL, (F(2, 
7257.49) = 18.36, p < .001) where MIDUS-II and MIDUS-III had lower levels of SQoL than 
MIDUS-I.
To understand the nature of these age and period effects, we tested a quadratic growth 
variable in this model to allow for non-linear change in SQoL over time (cf. Araujo et al., 
2004), but this effect was not significant, which suggested that the change in SQoL was 
linear. We also tested whether age moderated the rate of change between the periods in the 
model, finding significant moderation (F(2, 6584.08) = 9.68, p < .001) and showing that the 
estimated marginal means of SQoL for older adults had a faster rate of decline over time, 
compared to those of younger adults (see Figure 2). Including the age by period moderation 
effect in the model did not affect model fit (BIC = 61057.05, versus 61057.43), but aided 
substantive interpretation, so we retained it in the model for RQ1 (see Table 3).
RQ2. Do the age/period/cohort effects vary for men and women?
To determine whether the effects observed in RQ1 varied for men and women, we included 
gender in the model. Gender was a significant predictor of SQoL (see Table 3) where men 
had 5.2% higher SQoL on average, compared to women. The inclusion of gender in the 
model did not affect the size, direction, or significance of any of the other parameters in the 
model. When included as a potential moderator, gender did not show a significant (i.e., at p 
< .001) interaction with age (F(1, 4927.61) = 5.99, p = .014) or period effects (F(2, 7263.77) 
= 1.52, p = .218), so these moderation effects were not included in subsequent models. The 
model including the main effect for gender is shown in Table 3.
RQ3. To what extent are the age, period, and/or cohort effects accounted for by changes in 
sexual domains?
To address RQ3, we added four sexual domains as predictors to the model for RQ2 
simultaneously: (1) perceived control over the sexual aspects of life, (2) the amount of 
thought and effort put into the sexual aspects of life, (3) frequency of sex, and (4) number of 
sexual partners. All four domains were significant predictors of SQoL (see Table 3): Higher 
levels of perceived control, more thought and effort, and greater frequency of sex were all 
associated with higher SQoL. Number of sexual partners was also a significant predictor, 
where people with two or more sexual partners in the past year reported lower SQoL 
compared to people with one sexual partner (i.e., the reference category). In contrast, people 
with no sexual partners did not report significantly different SQoL compared to people with 
one sexual partner.

 The inclusion of the four sexual domains resulted in a number of changes in the parameters 
in the model, highlighting their strong influence as predictors of SQoL. For example, the age 
by period moderation effect halved in magnitude, reversed direction, and became non-
significant; and the value of the constant dropped by nearly six points to become statistically 
equivalent to zero. The main effect of gender also became smaller, but remained significant; 
women were predicted to have 2.6% lower SQoL than men on average. Most notably, the 
effect of age was moderated by the inclusion of the four sexual domains. Specifically, the 
effect of age reversed, so that older people had slightly higher ratings of SQoL (see Figure 
3): A ten-year increase in age was associated with a 1.4% increase in SQoL, holding other 
variables constant.
RQ4. Does the role of these four sexual domains differ with age or gender?
To determine whether the strength of the four sexual domains as predictors of SQoL varied 
by age or gender, we added these moderation effects to the RQ3 model (see Table 3). Age 
significantly moderated the effects of perceived control, thought and effort, and frequency of 
sex. Perceived control and frequency of sex became less strongly associated with SQoL in 
older adults, whereas the amount of thought and effort invested in the sexual aspects of life 
became more strongly associated with SQoL in older adults. These interactions explained 
small (<1%) but statistically significant amounts of the variance in SQoL. Gender 
significantly moderated the effects of perceived control, and thought and effort, accounting 
for 1.3–1.5% of the variance in SQoL. That is, perceived control was more strongly 
associated with SQoL in men than women, and the amount of thought and effort was more 
strongly associated with SQoL in women than men. The inclusion of these moderation 
effects resulted in a stronger main effect of age. Further, the confidence interval for the main 
effect of gender expanded, which meant that while women were predicted to have 3.0% 
lower SQoL than men, this effect was no longer significant.
RQ5. Do the above relationships change after accounting for sociodemographic covariates 
of sexuality and aging?
We added the following covariates to the RQ4 model to determine the robustness of our 
predictors to their inclusion: visible racial minority status, sexual minority status, level of 
education, living with a partner, having children, religiosity, depression, and physical health. 
The inclusion of these covariates had negligible effects on the direction, strength, and 
significance of the parameters in RQ4 (see Table 3). The full results for the model (i.e., 
including the effects of the sociodemographic characteristics) are available in the online 
supplement.
RQ6. Do the above relationships change after accounting for partnership characteristics?
In order to address this final question, we narrowed the scope of the analysis to focus on the 
subsample of participants in relationships who reported on their partner’s health and their 
relationship quality (n = 4,750). Most of the effects in the preceding models were unchanged 
after adding these partnership characteristics to the RQ5 model, but there were a few notable 
changes (see Table 3). The coefficients of perceived control, thought and effort, and 
frequency of sex were slightly smaller in magnitude (.15–.55 compared to .18–.64), but 
remained significant; age still had a significant moderating effect on thought and effort and

 on frequency of sex; and gender still had a moderating effect on perceived control and 
thought and effort, as above. However, three parameters that were significant in RQ4 and 
RQ5 were no longer significant after controlling for partnership characteristics. Most 
notably, age was unrelated to SQoL; a ten-year age difference predicted a 0.3% change in 
SQoL. Further, number of sexual partners was no longer significantly related to SQoL—
although the magnitude of the coefficient was similar (−.36 compared to -.44)—and age no 
longer had a moderating effect on the role of perceived control. The full results for the 
model (i.e., including the effects of the partnership characteristics and sociodemographic 
characteristics) are available in the online supplement.
Discussion
This study aimed to disentangle the association of aging and SQoL from the effects of 
sociocultural influences (i.e., period and cohort effects) by using two decades of longitudinal 
data from the Midlife in the United States study. We also explored the roles of gender and 
four specific sexual domains in these associations, and examined whether individual and 
partnership characteristics accounted for the relationships between these constructs across 
the lifespan. The findings from our six research questions are integrated below, and 
interpreted in the context of the extant literature.
Age, Period, and Cohort Effects
Age effects—The age effect was the strongest of the three time-related effects in our 
models. However, the relationship between SQoL and age varied depending on the 
constructs that were included in the models. Initially, age had a negative relationship with 
SQoL, which is consistent with existing literature from the U.S.(Balsis & Carpenter, 2004; 
Fleeson, 2004): A ten-year increase in age was associated with a 5% decline in SQoL; this 
decline was more rapid for older adults, and slower for younger adults. This effect reversed 
after accounting for the roles of perceived control over the sexual aspects of life, thought and 
effort invested in the sexual aspects of life, frequency of sex, and number of sexual partners 
in the past year. In the models that controlled for these sexual domains, age had a positive 
relationship with SQoL such that—holding the other variables constant—older adults would 
be predicted to have higher SQoL. In other words, if we compared a 40-year-old man and a 
50-year-old man at MIDUS-I who had the same levels of perceived control, thought and 
effort, frequency of sex, and number of sexual partners, we would expect the 50 year-old to 
report better SQoL.
A positive relationship between age and SQoL is consistent with extant American research 
on the relationship between age and other domains of quality of life, such as relationships, 
work, and financial matters (Fleeson, 2004); the subjective quality of these domains 
improves with age. Fleeson (2004) hypothesized that this is because people develop better 
skills and strategies over time to manage these aspects of their lives with more mastery. 
Correspondingly, the residual positive relationship between age and SQoL may be reflecting 
the benefits of life experience for sexuality as people learn more about their sexual 
preferences, or about their partners’ likes and dislikes, for example. If this were the case, we 
would expect these positive effects to be more likely to develop in the context of a fulfilling

 intimate relationship—where sexual exploration and a focus on partners’ pleasure is more 
likely to take place (Sprecher, Cate, Harvey & Wenzel, 2004)—and less likely to develop in 
a negative relationship. As such, it was fitting that the positive relationship between age and 
SQoL was accounted for by partnership characteristics (i.e., the quality of the relationship) 
in the model for RQ6. The other key finding for the association between age and SQoL was 
that quality—not quantity—of sexual encounters became a more important predictor of 
SQoL in older age: Frequency of sex became less influential with increasing age, and the 
amount of thought and effort invested in the sexual aspects of life became more influential 
(cf. Lodge & Umberson, 2012). In short, these findings suggest that age is not just 
associated with declines in the sexual aspects of life, but also with the acquisition of 
knowledge, skills, and preferences that can buffer these declines. Given wisdom is “the 
quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment” (In Oxford Dictionaries, 
2016), we could summarize these age-related findings as the development of sexual wisdom.
Period effect—While age had the strongest time-related effect, the period effect (i.e., the 
effect of the time at which the data were collected) was also influential in the preliminary 
models where there was a trend of declining SQoL over the 18 years of the study, even after 
controlling for age. However, given the period effect was not significant after the age by 
period moderation was included in the analyses—and this moderation was also subsequently 
accounted for by the effects of the four sexual domains—it seems that the period effect was 
due to the aging respondents, combined with the declines in perceived control, thought and 
effort, and frequency of sex between the waves (i.e., controlling for these variables rendered 
the period effects non-significant).
Cohort effect—The cohort effect did not add to the predictive power of the models for 
SQoL. This implies that there were no important differences in SQoL characterized by the 
historical birth cohorts specifically. Any differences that were present were captured by the 
age and period effects, which means that the generational differences were either linearly 
related to age, or were masked by societal shifts that affected all generations equally (Yang 
& Land, 2013). In short, the age effect was the most robust predictor of time-related changes 
in SQoL.
The Role of Gender
After controlling for the age and period effects, women had poorer SQoL than men, which is 
consistent with past research from the U.S.(Carpenter et al., 2009; Lindau & Gavrilova, 
2010). However, it is striking that even after accounting for the effects of perceived control, 
thought and effort, frequency of sex, and number of sexual partners, women still had 
significantly poorer SQoL than men. This gender difference may reflect differences in 
sexual beliefs and attitudes, and the role of sexual dynamics in “traditional” heterosexual 
relationships, which favor men’s sexual priorities in many Western countries (e.g., Fahs, 
2014; Hinchliff, Gott & Wylie, 2012; Richters, de Visser, Rissel & Smith, 2006; Wood, 
Mansfield & Koch, 2007). If this were the case, we would expect the inclusion of religiosity 
(cf. traditionalism) and sexual minority status (i.e., non-heterosexual sexual interactions) as 
covariates in the model for RQ5 to attenuate this relationship. Consistent with this, the effect 
of gender was non-significant in the model for RQ5; its magnitude, however, was

 unchanged, which suggests that there are other reasons for gender differences in SQoL that 
are not included in the present study. The moderation effects of gender were also consistent 
with socially normed scripts for gendered sexual interactions, which often lack variety in 
heterosexual encounters and are biased towards men’s pleasure in Western cultures 
(Messiah, Blin & Fiche, 1995; Richters et al., 2006; Tiefer & Hall, 2010; Wiederman, 2005). 
Specifically, perceived control was more important for men’s SQoL, and the amount of 
thought and effort invested in sex was more important for women. On a more positive note, 
we did not find women’s SQoL to decline more rapidly than men’s, which is in contrast to 
previous cross-sectional research from the U.S.that found the negative relationship between 
age and SQoL to be stronger for women (Balsis & Carpenter, 2004; Fleeson, 2004; Lindau 
& Gavrilova, 2010).
The Effects of Controlling for Individual and Partnership Characteristics
The analyses for RQ5 and RQ6 highlighted that the relationships between age, gender, 
sexual behavior, and SQoL were robust to the roles of sociodemographic factors. It is 
important to note that this does not mean that sociodemographic factors are unrelated to 
SQoL, but rather that their roles are not at the intersection of age, gender, sexual behavior, 
and SQoL. For example, while living with a partner was related to SQoL, it was evidently 
not differentially related to SQoL with aging (i.e., the effect of cohabitation was not stronger 
in older age; cf. Thomas et al., 2015).
In contrast, partnership characteristics were influential. For example, they attenuated many 
of the effects in RQ6, and wholly accounted for the effect of age (as discussed above). 
Overall, the mediating effect of partnership characteristics was smaller than we might have 
expected, given SQoL and relationship quality are intertwined and have bidirectional 
associations (Byers, 2005; Sprecher, 2002). After controlling for partnership characteristics, 
the effects of perceived control, thought and effort, and frequency of sex were stable, and 
remained significant; age still had a significant moderating effect on thought and effort and 
on frequency of sex; and gender still had a moderating effect on perceived control and 
thought and effort, as above. This suggests that while partnership characteristics play an 
important role in SQoL and account for the effect of age on SQoL, they do not account for 
the effects of other sexual domains, which is consistent with past research that found 
relationship quality and SQoL to operate independently (Fleeson, 2004).
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths and weaknesses of the study should be kept in mind when interpreting these 
results. The primary strength of this study was the use of a prospective longitudinal sample 
of over 6,000 adults. The primary limitation was the restricted measurement of the 
constructs of interest—which often relied on a single item. While many of the constructs 
were measured with robust validity—such as the item for SQoL, which was based on 
Campbell et al.’s (1976) theoretical model of life quality—some others were not. For 
example, the measurement of frequency of sex and number of sexual partners was limited 
because “sex” was not defined for the respondents (e.g., frequency of sex was measured by 
an item that read “How often have you had sex with someone?”). While it is likely that these 
items were interpreted as referring to penetrative sexual intercourse, there are, of course, 
Forbes et al.

 broader interpretations of “sex.” The measurement of sexual minority status was also limited 
by the use of a dichotomous “heterosexual”/“not heterosexual” variable, which was due to 
the small number of participants that endorsed the “bisexual” and “homosexual” response 
options (nWave 1 = 168 total, 2.7%; nWave 2 = 105 total, 2.8%; nWave 3 = 75 total, 3.0%), and 
limited our understanding of SQoL within the diversity of non-heterosexuality. Further, 
although respondents indicated whether they were in a cohabiting relationship, it was not 
assessed whether any or all reported sexual activity was within this relationship.
The other primary limitation was the absence of additional constructs of interest that may 
have contributed to the analyses. For example, low sexual function and the experience of 
menopause or perimenopause are important factors to consider in research on aging and 
sexuality (Dundon & Rellini, 2010; Fisher, Donahue, Long, Heiman, Rosen & Sand, 2015; 
Kontula & Haavio-Mannila, 2009). Unfortunately, these constructs were not assessed at 
MIDUS-I so we excluded them in order to use the data from all three waves of MIDUS in 
our analyses, and to maximize the sample size. Sexual attitudes and beliefs were also not 
measured explicitly, and likely represent the mechanisms that account for many of the 
results in the present study. Examining the effects of these variables in the relationships 
between aging and SQoL would be an interesting avenue for future research. We also did not 
account for relationship duration, which is related to SQoL (Schmiedeberg & Schröder, 
2016), because it would have been perfectly confounded with the effect of age for people 
who remained with the same partner between waves of data collection. Finally, the present 
study has focused on SQoL and aging in the US. While the extant literature from Western 
countries highlights strong similarities between other countries with European influences 
and the U.S.in the relationships among SQoL, aging, and related factors, less research has 
focused on these constructs in non-Western countries. As such, it is not clear to what extent 
these results can be expected to generalize to other cultures.
Conclusion
This study adds to the literature by extending our understanding of the relationship between 
aging and sexuality. Our findings suggest that while SQoL does tend to decline with age, 
this decline is largely related to potentially modifiable factors, such as the amount of thought 
and effort invested in the sexual aspects of life, and frequency of sex. In fact, there was 
evidence to suggest that age may be associated with the acquisition of skills that can lessen 
age-related declines in SQoL (i.e., “sexual wisdom”). Delineating the mechanisms at work 
in this phenomenon (e.g., the positive age-related changes in sexual skills, beliefs, or 
attitudes) thus represents an interesting direction for future research, as they could offer 
targets for clinical interventions to facilitate positive sexual experiences across the lifespan. 
Overall, the results highlight a place for sexuality in the framework of successful aging (cf. 
Woloski-Wruble et al., 2010), which focuses on “adding life to the years” of older age, 
rather than adding years to life (Havighurst, 1961, p. 8).

the centred age variable. Exact values are mid-20s = 26.6, mid-30s = 36.6, mid 40s = 46.6, 
mid 50s = 56.6, mid 60s = 66.6, and mid 70s = 76.6. MIDUS = Midlife in the United States.

Note. Sexual quality of life (SQoL) was measured on a scale from 0–10, so a coefficient of .5 corresponds to a 5% change in SQoL. Significant effects (p < .001) are shown in bold where the Type III test of 
fixed effects and the estimate of the fixed effect (i.e., the global F-test for the effect, and the t-test for the different levels of categorical effects) reached significance.
