Previous dating of the Vi-207 and Vi-208 Neanderthal remains from
Vindija Cave (Croatia) led to the suggestion that Neanderthals
survived there as recently as 28,000–29,000 B.P. Subsequent dating
yielded older dates, interpreted as ages of at least ∼32,500 B.P. We
have redated these same specimens using an approach based on the
extraction of the amino acid hydroxyproline, using preparative high-
performance liquid chromatography (Prep-HPLC). This method is
more efficient in eliminating modern contamination in the bone col-
lagen. The revised dates are older than 40,000 B.P., suggesting the
Vindija Neanderthals did not live more recently than others across
Europe, and probably predate the arrival of anatomically modern
humans in Eastern Europe. We applied zooarchaeology by mass
spectrometry (ZooMS) to find additional hominin remains. We iden-
tified one bone that is Neanderthal, based on its mitochondrial DNA,
and dated it directly to 46,200 ± 1,500 B.P. We also attempted to
date six early Upper Paleolithic bone points from stratigraphic units
G1, Fd/d+G1 and Fd/d, Fd. One bone artifact gave a date of 29,500 ±
400 B.P., while the remainder yielded no collagen. We additionally
dated animal bone samples from units G1 and G1–G3. These dates
suggest a co-occurrence of early Upper Paleolithic osseous artifacts,
particularly split-based points, alongside the remains of Neander-
thals is a result of postdepositional mixing, rather than an associa-
tion between the two groups, although more work is required to
show this definitively.

Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition
T
he period between ∼45,000 and 35,000 cal B.P. in Europe
witnessed the so-called biocultural transition from the Mid-
dle to early Upper Paleolithic, when incoming anatomically
modern humans displaced Neanderthal groups across the con-
tinent (1, 2). Significant questions still remain regarding the
precise nature of this transition, the humans responsible for the
various transitional early Upper Paleolithic industries, the degree
of overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans, and the
timing of the disappearance of the former. The European record for
the transition retains its interest because it is the best-documented
sequence for the disappearance of a hominin group available (3).
The latest data, both radiometric and genetic, suggest Neanderthals
and modern humans coexisted or overlapped for up to several
thousand years in Europe until Neanderthal disappearance at
around 40,000 cal B.P. (4, 5). Ascertaining the spatial attributes of
Neanderthal and modern human populations in Europe is an area
of active research, and a reliable chronology remains essential.
Our understanding of the biocultural processes involved in the
transition have been greatly influenced by improved accelerator
mass spectrometry (AMS) dating methods and their application
to directly dating the remains of late Neanderthals and early
modern humans, as well as artifacts recovered from the sites they
occupied. It has become clear that there have been major pro-
blems with dating reliability and accuracy across the Paleolithic
in general, with studies highlighting issues with underestimation
of the ages of different dated samples from previously analyzed
sites (6). We have been working on redating some of the pur-
ported late-surviving Neanderthal sites from around Europe,
which have included human and archaeological remains from
sites such as Mezmaiskaya (Russia), where a previous directly
dated Neanderthal infant yielded a radiocarbon age of ∼29,000
B.P. (7), and Zafarraya (Spain), which was thought to contain
Neanderthal remains clustering in age around a small group of
U-series–dated animal bones between 33,400 and 28,900 B.P.
(8). At Mezmaiskaya, the AMS dates obtained for the Nean-
derthal excavated above the previously dated individual were
substantially older (9). This, along with other AMS dates from
cut-marked fauna from the same archaeological horizons, sug-
gested the original date of 29,000 B.P. could not be correct. At
Zafarraya, Wood et al. (10) showed that, when redated using
ultrafiltration methods, the bones that produced ages of ∼33,000
B.P. were in fact beyond the radiocarbon limit, suggesting the
Significance
Radiocarbon dating of Neanderthal remains recovered from
Vindija Cave (Croatia) initially revealed surprisingly recent re-
sults: 28,000–29,000 B.P. This implied the remains could repre-
sent a late-surviving, refugial Neanderthal population and
suggested they could have been responsible for producing
some of the early Upper Paleolithic artefacts more usually produced
by anatomically modern humans. This article presents revised ra-
diocarbon dates of the human bones from this site obtained using
a more robust purification method targeting the amino acid
hydroxyproline. The data show that all the Neanderthal remains
are from a much earlier period (>40,000 cal B.P.). These revised
dates change our interpretation of this important site and dem-
onstrate that the Vindija Neanderthals probably did not overlap
temporally with early modern humans.

 Neanderthal remains were unlikely to be as young as previously
thought. In both cases, revised radiocarbon dates produced with
more robust chemical pretreatment methods have illustrated sig-
nificant underestimates in the previous dates that cannot be rec-
onciled with a hypothesis of late-surviving refugial Neanderthals.
The Neanderthal fossil remains from level G1 of Vindija Cave
in northern Croatia have remained in the literature as potentially
late individuals. Given the evidence from the Pes
¸tera cu Oase
specimen, which demonstrates a recent Neanderthal ancestry in
a 40,000 cal B.P. modern human from the Danube corridor (5),
the renewed dating of the Vindija remains is overdue.
Two specimens, Vi-207 and Vi-208, were originally directly
AMS dated in the late 1990s at the Oxford Radiocarbon Ac-
celerator Unit (ORAU). Vi-207 is a right posterior mandible and
Vi-208 is a parietal fragment, both showing Neanderthal-specific
morphology (11, 12). The initial radiocarbon results were
29,080 ± 400 B.P. (OxA-8296) and 28,020 ± 360 B.P. (OxA-
8295) (13). Higham et al. (14) attempted to redate these speci-
mens by taking the very small amounts of collagen remaining
from the original sample pretreatment and ultrafiltering the
product before AMS dating. The revised measurements were
32,400 ± 1,800 B.P. (Vi-207: OxA-X-2089-07) and 32,400 ± 800
B.P. (Vi-208: OxA-X-2089-06), which indicated the previous
dates were indeed too young. For sample Vi-208, after ultrafil-
tration, the C/N atomic ratio was 3.4, which indicates collagen of
acceptable quality. However, for Vi-207, the >30-kDa fraction
obtained produced a C/N ratio of 4.3, which indicates the pres-
ence of a high molecular weight contaminant. The radiocarbon
date for this sample could therefore include a higher molecular
weight noncollagenous contaminant, possibly cross-linked to the
collagen. On the basis of the potential problems associated with
the small size of the redated samples and the potential for re-
maining contaminants, OxA-X-2089-06 was considered to be a
minimum age (14). If the dates are even approximately correct,
however, it makes them the most recent known Neanderthals.
This would imply a more extensive temporal overlap between
Neanderthals and early modern humans in central Europe than
has recently been documented (4).
In addition to the Neanderthal remains, level G1 has yielded a
small archaeological assemblage that contains techno-typologically
Middle and Upper Paleolithic lithic artifacts plus several distinc-
tively early Upper Paleolithic osseous points (12). It has been ar-
gued that the mix of Neanderthals, Middle Paleolithic tools, and
Upper Paleolithic technology was the result of cryoturbation and
Ursus spelaeus activity in level G1, with elements mixing into level
G1 from both the Upper Paleolithic unit F above and the Middle
Paleolithic level G3 below (15, 16). Zilhão (17) has suggested that
the G1 lithic assemblage has parallels with the Szeletian tech-
nocomplex, and further, that there is a mixture of elements
of Szeletian and Aurignacian I and II within the level [see also
Svoboda (18)]. Karavani�
c and Smith (19) have suggested that the
mixture of elements may represent the interaction and possible
acculturation between modern humans and late Neanderthals.
These alternatives are testable by selecting human and organic
osseous points, as well as animal bones, for renewed AMS dating.
This is what we have undertaken and describe here.
Materials
A total of 10 samples from Vindija Cave were selected for AMS radiocarbon
dating (Table 1). These included three previously dated Neanderthal specimens
(Vi-207, Vi-208, and Vi-33.19), as well as a fourth Neanderthal bone (Vi-*28)
discovered using zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS) screening. In
addition, to test the reality of the co-occurrence of earlier Upper Paleolithic
bone and antler point artifacts with the Neanderthal remains, we selected six
osseous points for dating (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). To test collagen preservation,
we took ∼3–5 mg bone powder, using tungsten carbide drills, and measured
the %N content. This is an indicator of collagen preservation (20). The results
show that only one bone point sample (Vi-3446) had sufficient levels of ni-
trogen to warrant full sampling for collagen extraction and AMS dating; the
remainder failed and therefore were not sampled further (SI Appendix, Table
S1). We also included the sample from a split-based bone point (Vi-3437) that
had been analyzed in the laboratory previously, producing only a small collagen
yield. We decided to attempt to redate it, using a larger starting mass of bone
powder. Unfortunately, there was insufficient collagen remaining from this
sample after pretreatment. We also selected four animal bones of Cervidae
(Vi-*17), Panthera sp. (Vi-*6), Ursus sp. (Vi-*7), and Bovidae (Vi-*60), iden-
tified by ZooMS from stratigraphic units G1 and G1–G3 to explore the po-
tential issue of postdepositional mixing in the deposits further.
Results and Discussion
ZooMS Collagen Fingerprinting. We used ZooMS to identify po-
tential hominin bone fragments among the unidentified faunal
remains from the G1 and G3 levels, as well as the stratigraphic unit
G1–G3. The majority of the 383 samples we analyzed yielded poor
collagen preservation, which prevented any identification to genus
or taxon. Only 101 samples produced identifiable spectra; a sum-
mary of all taxa identified by ZooMS is shown in SI Appendix,
Table S2. This assemblage is dominated by Ursus, and only six of
the 27 taxa identified by morphological study of the bones in
Miracle et al. (21) could be identified here. We identified a single
hominin specimen (Fig. 1 A and B), which again highlights the use
of applying such techniques to groups of unidentified Paleolithic
bone samples. The bone was analyzed using ancient DNA tech-
niques to enable a formal species identification.
DNA Analysis of the Human Bones. Genomic analysis based on mi-
tochondrial DNA revealed that all four human specimens fall into
Neanderthal mitochondrial variation. Full mitochondrial genomes of
Vi-207 and Vi-*28 were reconstructed with an average coverage of
103-fold and 257-fold, respectively. The mitochondrial DNA se-
quence of Vi-207 was identical to Vi-33.25 and Feldhofer 1 mito-
chondrial genomes, whereas Vi-*28 had an identical mitochondrial

 sequence to Vi-33.17 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Both Vi-33.25 and Vi-
33.17 were found in layer I of Vindija Cave. As previously
published, Vi-33.19 has the same mitochondrial sequence as Vi-
33.16 (22). Because of lower endogenous DNA content in Vi-
208, a full mitochondrial genome could not be reconstructed for
the sample. However, from the limited amounts of mitochondrial
sequences, we were able to trace most of the observed variants
to variations found in previously sequenced Neanderthal mito-
chondrial genomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
AMS Dating. Nine of the samples selected produced enough col-
lagen (or hydroxyproline) to be dated by AMS. All dates obtained
on the four Neanderthal specimens at the ORAU are reported in
Table 2. We also list the dates obtained on two other hominin
samples: Vi-75-G3/h-203, analyzed at the Uppsala Radiocarbon
Laboratory (Sweden) (23), and Vi-2291-18 (level G, sublayer un-
known), prepared at the Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, and dated
at the ORAU (24). The different sample pretreatments are also
indicated in Table 2.
Vi-208 and Vi-207 produced hydroxyproline dates of 42,700 ±
1,600 and 43,900 ± 2,000 B.P., respectively. These ages are sig-
nificantly older than any of the dates obtained previously for these
specimens using the AG (gelatinized filtered collagen) and AF
(ultrafiltered collagen) procedures, and this strongly suggests that

Radiocarbon dates of the Vindija Neanderthal remains. CRA is conventional radiocarbon age, expressed in years B.P. (49). Stable isotope ratios are
expressed in per mil (‰) relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite with a mass spectrometric precision of ±0.2‰ (50). PCode refers to pretreatment code; AG
is gelatinized filtered collagen, AF is ultrafiltered collagen, XB denotes collagen extracted at a different laboratory than the ORAU, and HYP denotes the
extraction of hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed bone collagen (51, 52). Collagen yield represents the weight of gelatin or ultrafiltered gelatin in milligrams.
%Yld is the percent yield of extracted collagen as a function of the starting weight of the bone analyzed. When further purification (AF or HYP) was
performed on previously extracted collagen, the yields are not reported. %C is the carbon present in the combusted sample (gelatin or hydroxyproline). C/N is
the atomic ratio of carbon to nitrogen and is acceptable if it ranges between 2.9–3.5 in the case of collagen or ∼5.0 in the case of hydroxyproline. All samples
were prepared and dated at the ORAU with the exception of Vi-2291-18, which was extracted at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig and dated in Oxford (24)
and Vi-75-G3/h-203, which was prepared and dated at Uppsala in Sweden (23). The background carbon derived from the HPLC separation has been accounted
for by using a correction where appropriate (details can be found in the SI Appendix). Slash indicates data not available.

 noncollagenous high molecular weight contaminants, probably
crosslinked to the collagen, were still present in the sample pre-
viously dated. It is only by hydrolyzing the collagen and selecting
the hydroxyproline that we were able to successfully remove these
contaminants.
The AMS measurement of the third human bone from level
G1 (Vi-*28), identified using the ZooMS method, gave a date
of 46,200 ± 1,500 B.P. For these three HYP (extraction of
hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed bone collagen) dates obtained
on the Neanderthal bones from level G1, we performed a χ2 test
using the modern fraction F14C and its error. The error
weighted mean is 0.0038 ± 0.0005 with a t value of 2.57. If t
is <5.99, the value for χ2, the error weighted mean is not sig-
nificant. This shows that the results obtained on the three
Neanderthal bones from level G1 are statistically in agreement.
Vi-33.19 (level G3) was also dated using the hydroxyproline
method and produced a date of 44,300 ± 1,200 B.P., which is a
more precise date than the one obtained using the AF procedure
(45,300 ± 2,300 B.P.). The AF determination had a low target
current in the AMS (85% of normal current) and was imprecise
for this reason. The fact that the two dates overlap suggests no
significant contamination in this bone. Taken together, these
dates show a significantly older occupation of the site by Neander-
thals, suggesting the site cannot be considered to be a refugium for
late-surviving Neanderthals (Fig. 2, code in SI Appendix). The two
other dates obtained on samples Vi-33.26 and Vi-75, even if ob-
tained with a method that can be less efficient in removing con-
tamination, confirm the dating of level G is more than 42,000 B.P.
Only one bone point (Vi-3446–P41417) produced enough ni-
trogen during prescreening to warrant pretreatment chemistry.
Less than 500 mg bone was available, so we applied an AG
(gelatin) treatment to maximize the collagen yield. We obtained
a date of 29,500 ± 400 B.P., which we consider to be a minimum
age, as this pretreatment has been shown before to underesti-
mate the age of ancient bones such as this (Table 3). To test
possible perturbation in level G1, we also dated four faunal
samples identified as originating from levels G1 and G1–G3, using
ultrafiltration (AF). These samples produced dates that were all
greater than or very close to the radiocarbon limit (Table 3). These
samples are less likely to have been treated with conservation
materials than the human bones, and therefore were not prepared
using the HPLC method. Three of these faunal bones are from
level G1 (Table 1). We see more variation that would be expected
statistically if we combine the three Neanderthal bones and three
faunal bones from level G1 for a χ2 test (error weighted mean,
0.0027 ± 0.0004; t = 22.52; χ2 = 11.07). This shows there is bone of
variable radiocarbon age in the G1 level and suggests the possibility
of postdepositional mixing and movement of material. In conse-
quence, the bone tools cannot be associated with the Neanderthal
remains unless further direct radiocarbon dating using the HYP
approach is undertaken. Clearly, the low collagen content of the
points appears to preclude this at this time.
Conclusions
Single-amino acid AMS dating of the Vindija Neanderthals has
yielded results that are substantially older than the previous ages
that were initially obtained. We have shown that the Neander-
thals predate ∼44,000 cal B.P. The results suggest this group was
not a late-surviving refugial Neanderthal population, as previously
thought, and means the group almost certainly did not overlap with
early anatomically modern humans in this part of Europe. Despite
our best attempts, we were not able to date the bone industry
associated with the archaeology of level G1. The one date we
obtained from a later stratigraphic unit was younger than 30,000
B.P., but because the bone was not treated with the most rig-
orous pretreatment chemistry methods, it could potentially be
older. The dating of other faunal materials from level G1 highlighted
a significant range in age, which could indicate a perturbation of
the general sequence. The question, then, of whether some of
the points could have been produced by Neanderthals remains
open; however, it is parsimonious to conclude that the split-based
point at least must have a maximum age of 32,000–34,000 B.P. based
on evidence for its association with the Aurignacian in other regions,
and so it likely postdates the Vindija Neanderthals significantly.

SEE COMMENTARY
 Bone points have been recovered throughout Eurasia with dates as
early as ∼37,000 B.P. (e.g., from the Aurignacian site of Pes’ko and
the Châtelperronian site of Arcy-sur-Cure) (6, 25, 26). It is there-
fore clear that both anatomically modern humans and Neander-
thals produced bone points, with only split-based bone/antler points
being diagnostic of the earlier facies of the former.
Our perception of the biological transition between Nean-
derthals and modern humans has changed radically during the
last decade. Evidence suggests interbreeding and a significant
temporal overlap between the two from ∼44,000–40,000 cal
B.P. On the basis of our hydroxyproline dates and the DNA
results, the Vindija Neanderthals date before the period when
the first modern humans arrived into Europe and interbred
with Neanderthals.
Methods
Bone Screening by ZooMS. We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting or
ZooMS to analyze preserved type 1 collagen (COL1) from small unidentified
bone fragments from the Vindija site. COL1 is characterized by three poly-
peptide (alpha) chains, and within these chains there are small differences in
the amino acid sequences among different species. These offer the possibility
of identification of species-specific amino acid markers. We used matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to determine the
relative mass-to-charge (m/z) values of the tryptic digest peptides in each
bone sample. By comparing these values with a library of known fauna, we
identified bones to genus or species in some instance (27–31). We screened a
total of 383 unidentified bone samples from Vindija Cave (levels G1, G3, and
stratigraphic unit G1–G3).
Radiocarbon Dating. We used two different methods to prepare the samples
for AMS dating. First, samples from artifacts were pretreated following
the routine ORAU procedure, comprising a decalcification, base wash,
reacidification, gelatinization, and ultrafiltration (coded AF in the ORAU), as
described by Brock et al. (20). Sample P41417 produced too little collagen for
ultrafiltration, so the treatment was halted after gelatinization (coded AG).
The four human bone samples were dated using the single amino acid ra-
diocarbon dating method developed at ORAU (32). This method involves
separation of the underivatized amino acids from hydrolyzed bone collagen
samples using preparative HPLC. Details of the method are described in the
SI Appendix. Hydroxyproline (HYP), was isolated by Prep-HPLC, combusted,
graphitized, and AMS-dated. This pretreatment approach is the most effi-
cient technique to remove contaminants, including conservation materials
(unless collagen-based glue has been applied).
DNA Analysis.
DNA extraction and library preparation. Genomic analysis of the four human
bones was performed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthro-
pology in Leipzig, Germany. Three samples (Vi-207, Vi-208, and Vi-*28) were
prepared specifically for this project, whereas Vi-33.19 was previously ana-
lyzed as part of a separate study (22). Bones were sampled using a sterile
dentistry drill, and between 15 and 30 mg bone powder was used for DNA
extraction, with the exception of Vi-*28, in which three separate parts of the
bone were sampled (SI Appendix, Table S3). DNA extraction was performed
using a method for ultrashort DNA fragment retrieval (33) with modifica-
tions (34). The bone powder of Vi-207 and Vi-208 was treated with 0.5%
hypochlorite solution before DNA extraction (34) to remove microbial and
modern human DNA contamination. Next-generation sequencing libraries
were prepared from 10 μL of each extract, using two single-stranded library
preparation schemes: Vi-207 and Vi-208 with a previously published method
(35), with modifications from Korlevi�
c et al. (34), and Vi-*28 with an auto-
mated library preparation scheme (36). Libraries were amplified and labeled
with a pair of unique index sequences (37, 38).
Enrichment of the mitochondrial DNA and sequencing. Amplified libraries were
enriched for human mitochondrial DNA, using a bead-based hybridization
capture (39) with modifications (40). Enriched libraries were sequenced on an
Illumina MiSeq platform with a double index configuration (41). Overlapping
paired-end reads were merged (42) and mapped to the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence mitochondrial genome (rCRS; NC_0120920), using Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner (43) with parameters “-n 0.01 -o 2 -l 16500” (44). Analyses
were restricted to sequences with perfect index combinations. PCR duplicates
were removed using bam-rmdup (https://bitbucket.org/ustenzel/biohazard-
tools), and mapped sequences longer than 35 bases with a mapping quality of
at least 25 were retained for subsequent analyses. To assess whether the results
could be affected by present-day modern human contamination, sequences
with ancient DNA specific cytosine to thymine substitutions (C to T) at the 5′ or
3′ molecule end were selected and analyzed separately.
Phylogenetic analyses. To reconstruct the mitochondrial genomes of the three
previously unanalyzed hominin samples, DNA sequences were realigned to the
Vindija 33.16 mitochondrial genome (AM948965) (45). Data were processed as
described earlier. Data analysis was performed as previously published (ref. 28
for full mitochondrial genomes, ref. 46 for partial mitochondrial data).
