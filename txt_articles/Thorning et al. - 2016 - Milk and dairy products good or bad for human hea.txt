Abstract
Background: There is scepticism about health effects of dairy products in the public, which is reflected in an
increasing intake of plant-based drinks, for example, from soy, rice, almond, or oat.
Objective: This review aimed to assess the scientific evidence mainly from meta-analyses of observational
studies and randomised controlled trials, on dairy intake and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and all-cause mortality.
Results: The most recent evidence suggested that intake of milk and dairy productswas associatedwith reducedrisk
of childhood obesity. In adults, intake of dairy products was shown to improve body composition and facilitate
weight lossduring energy restriction. Inaddition, intake of milk and dairy productswas associatedwith a neutral or
reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke. Furthermore, the
evidence suggested a beneficial effect of milk and dairy intake on bone mineral density but no association with risk
of bone fracture. Among cancers, milk and dairy intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer, bladder
cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, and not associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung
cancer,whilethe evidenceforprostate cancerriskwasinconsistent.Finally,consumptionofmilkanddairy products
was not associated with all-cause mortality. Calcium-fortified plant-based drinks have been included as an
alternative to dairy products in the nutrition recommendations in several countries. However, nutritionally, cow’s
milkandplant-baseddrinksare completelydifferentfoods,andanevidence-basedconclusiononthe healthvalue of
the plant-based drinks requires more studies in humans.
Conclusion: The totality of available scientific evidence supports that intake of milk and dairy products
contribute to meet nutrient recommendations, and may protect against the most prevalent chronic diseases,
whereas very few adverse effects have been reported.

S
everal media stories and organisations claim that
dairy increases risk of chronic diseases including
obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
osteoporosis, and cancer. Therefore, there is an increasing
scepticism among the general consumers about the health
consequences of eating dairy products. This is reflected in
an increasing consumption of plant-based drinks, for
example, based on soy, rice, almond, or oats. Dairy is an
essential part of the food culture in the Nordic countries;
thus, inclusion of milk and dairy products in the diet may
be natural for many Nordic individuals. The major causes
of loss of disease-free years in the Nordic countries today
are type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers.
Moreover, the increasing prevalence of obesity greatly
increases the risk of these chronic diseases. Given
the increasing prevalence of these chronic diseases, it is
critically important to understand the health effects of
milk and dairy products in the diet. Accordingly, this
narrative review presents the latest evidence from meta-
analyses and systematic reviews of observational studies
and randomised controlled trials on dairy intake (butter
excluded) and risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease, osteoporosis, and cancer as well as all-cause
mortality.
We aim to answer the key questions: 1) For the general
consumer, will a diet with milk and dairy products overall
provide better or worse health, and increase or decrease
risk of major diseases and all-cause mortality than a diet

 with no or low content of milk and dairy products? 2) Is
it justified to recommend the general lactose-tolerant
population to avoid consumption of milk and dairy
products? 3) Is there scientific evidence to substantiate
that replacing milk with plant-based drinks will improve
health?
Obesity and type 2 diabetes
A large share of the on-going increase in prevalence
of type 2 diabetes is driven by the obesity epidemic (1, 2),
and it is therefore relevant to assess the role of milk
and dairy products for body weight control. Childhood
overweight and obesity worldwide is a major contributor
to the current obesity epidemic, and childhood obesity
frequently tracks into adulthood (3). Therefore, early
prevention of childhood obesity is important. A meta-
analysis showed that among children in the pre-school
and school age, there was no association between dairy
intake and adiposity (4). However, there was a modestly
protective effect in adolescence. A recent meta-analysis
by Lu et al. (5) found that children in the highest dairy
intake group were 38% less likely to be overweight or
obese compared to those in the lowest dairy intake group.
An increase in dairy intake of one serving per day was
associated with a 0.65% lower body fat and a 13% lower
risk of overweight or obesity.
Milk and dairy products are good sources of high-
quality protein. Protein is important during weight
loss and subsequent weight maintenance due to the high
satiating effect which helps to prevent over-consumption
of energy and thereby reduces body fat stores (6, 7).
Furthermore, dairy protein is a good source of essential
amino acids for muscle protein synthesis and thus helps
to maintain the metabolically active muscle mass during
weight loss (8). Meta-analyses support that in adults,
dairy products facilitate weight loss and improve body
composition, that is, reduce body fat mass and preserve
lean body mass during energy restriction and in short-term
studies (9�11). The effect of an increased dairy consump-
tion on body weight in long-term studies (�1 year) and
in energy balance studies is less convincing (10, 11). This
is likely due to the opposing effects of dairy on body
composition, that is, reduction of fat mass and preserva-
tion of lean body mass.
Meta-analyses assessing the role of intake of milk and
dairy products on risk of type 2 diabetes have consistently
found no or a slight beneficial effect of dairy intake on
diabetes risk (12�15). This is consistent with a Mendelian
randomisation study using genetic polymorphisms for the
lactase gene, which showed that milk intake assessed by
lactose tolerance was not associated with risk of type 2
diabetes or obesity (16). The most recent meta-analysis on
dairy intake and diabetes incidence included 22 cohort
studies with a total of 579,832 subjects and 43,118 type 2
diabetes cases (17). An inverse association between total
dairy and yoghurt intake and risk of type 2 diabetes was
reported although there was no association with milk intake.
The benefits of fermented dairy products (cheese and
yoghurt) in relation to type 2 diabetes may be due to
their effect on the gut microbiota (18, 19). Other studies
have identified that whey protein (primarily in milk and
yoghurt) can reduce postprandial plasma glucose concen-
tration in type 2 diabetic subjects (20). This effect may be
due to the branched chain amino acids in the whey protein
fraction, particularly leucine which has been shown to
induce a greater stimulation of glucose-dependent insulino-
tropic polypeptide (GIP), but not glucagon like peptide 1
(GLP-1), compared to other amino acids (21). The GIP
response is possiblya key factor in the higher insulin response
andthe subsequent loweringof bloodglucose seenafterwhey
ingestion, at least in healthy subjects. In addition to the
insulinotropic effect of milk, a recent study has indicated that
dairy may also improve insulin sensitivity (22).
Conclusion on obesity and type 2 diabetes
A diet high in milk and dairy products reduces the risk
of childhood obesity and improves body composition
in adults. This likely contributes to lower the risk of
developing type 2 diabetes. Additionally, dairy product
consumption during energy restriction facilitates weight
loss, whereas the effect of dairy intake during energy
balance is less clear. Finally, there is increasing evidence
suggesting that especially the fermented dairy products,
cheese and yoghurt, are associated with a reduced risk of
type 2 diabetes.
Cardiovascular disease
Low-fat, calcium-rich dairy products are generally con-
sidered to lower blood pressure. This was supported by
a meta-analysis of six observational studies, whereas
no association was found with intake of high-fat dairy
products (23). High-fat dairy products are known to
increase high density lipoprotein (HDL)- and low density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations. The latter
normally predicts risk of cardiovascular disease (24),
but this may depend on the size of the LDL-cholesterol
particles. Small, dense LDL particles are more athero-
genic than their larger counterparts (25�28) due to their
lower affinity for the LDL-receptor and higher suscept-
ibility to oxidation (29). In agreement, some of the fatty
acids typically found in milk and dairy products have
been associated with less small, dense LDL particles
(4:0�10:0 and 14:0 in the diet, and 15:0 and 17:0 in serum
phospholipids) (30). In addition, the minerals in milk
and dairy products have been shown to attenuate the
LDL-response to high-fat dairy intake (31, 32).
Among high-fat dairy products, cheese in particular
does not seem to increase LDL-cholesterol to the extent
expected, based on the high content of saturated fat (33).
When compared to habitual diet with a lower total and

 saturated fat content (33), or compared to diets with lower
total fat content but higher content of high-GI carbohy-
drates (34, 35), a high intake of cheese was found not
to increase LDL-cholesterol. A meta-analysis of rando-
mised controlled trials studying the effect of cheese
consumption compared with other foods on blood lipids
and lipoproteins showed that cheese caused lower
total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol
concentrations compared with butter (36). Compared
with milk, however, there was no statistically significant
difference in blood lipids (32, 37). Several meta-analyses
have been conducted on the relationship between intake
of milk and dairy products and risk of developing cardi-
ovascular disease. There was no consistent association
between milk or dairy intake and cardiovascular disease,
coronary heart disease or stroke in a meta-analysis by
Soedamah-Muthu et al. (38). In a recent update, includ-
ing a higher number of prospective cohort studies, there
was a significant inverse association between milk intake
and stroke, with a 7% lower risk of stroke per 200 ml
milk/day, but considerable heterogeneity. Further, strati-
fication for Asian and Western countries showed a more
marked reduction in risk in Asian than in Western
countries. This is consistent with a previous meta-analysis
by Hu et al. (39) showing a non-linear dose�response
relationship between milk intake and risk of stroke, with
the highest risk reduction of 7�8% with a milk intake of
200�300 ml/day. Also, the meta-analyses by Hu et al. (39)
and de Goede et al. (40) both showed an inverse
association between cheese intake and stroke, however
only borderline significant in the latter. Accordingly,
another meta-analysis on dairy and cardiovascular dis-
ease found that intake of cheese and milk as well as
yoghurt was inversely associated with cardiovascular
disease risk (41). A later meta-analysis by Qin et al.
(42) found that dairy intake was associated with a 12%
lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and 13% lower risk
of stroke as compared to individuals with no or a low
dairy consumption (42). Likewise, a recent and compre-
hensive meta-analysis, including 31 cohort studies, sug-
gested that a high dairy intake was associated with a 9%
lower risk of stroke, whereas no association was found
with total cardiovascular disease or coronary heart
disease (43). Moreover, a high intake of cheese was
associated with an 8% lower risk of coronary heart
disease and a 13% lower risk of stroke. In addition,
high plasma levels of the saturated fatty acid C 17:0,
which primarily originates from dairy, were found to be
associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease
(44). Finally, a meta-analysis by O’Sullivan et al. (45)
found no indication of total dairy intake or any specific
dairy product being associated with an increased cardi-
ovascular mortality. Studies are emerging showing that
dairy products, particularly the low-fat types, cluster
within a healthy dietary pattern (46), and therefore, the
risk of residual confounding in the observational studies
cannot be ruled out.
In accordance with the latest meta-analyses presented
above, the latest Nordic Nutrition Recommendations
have concluded that high consumption of low-fat milk
products is associated with reduced risk of hypertension
and stroke (47).
Conclusion on cardiovascular disease
The overall evidence indicates that a high intake of milk
and dairy products, that is, 200�300 ml/day, does not
increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Specifically,
there is an inverse association with risk of hypertension
and stroke.
Bone health and osteoporosis
Milk and dairy products contain a number of nutrients
that are required for building strong bones in childhood
and for their maintenance during adulthood with the aim
to reduce osteoporosis and bone fractures in older age (48).
The European Commission has concluded that protein,
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, zinc, vita-
min D, and vitamin K are necessary for maintaining
normal bones (European Commission regulation 2012).
With the exception of vitamin D, these nutrients are all
present in significant amounts in milk and dairy products.
Osteoporosis has been described as a ‘paediatric disease
with geriatric consequences’ as low milk, and hence, low
mineral intake during childhood and adolescence has been
associated with significantly increased risk of osteoporotic
fractures in middle and older age, particularly in women
(49, 50). A recent study indicated that in children and
adolescents, except for those with very low calcium intakes,
magnesium intake may be more important than calcium
in relation to bone development (51). Calcium intake was
found not to be significantly associated with total bone
mineral content or density, whereas intake of magnesium
and the amount absorbed were key predictors of bone
mass. The extent to which these results can be extrapolated
to the general population is uncertain, but milk and dairy
products are important sources of magnesium and hence
important supporters of bone growth during adolescence.
In a meta-analysis by Huncharek et al. (52), dairy pro-
ducts, with or without vitamin D supplementation, in-
creased total body and lumbar spine bone mineral content
in children with low baseline dairy intake, whereas no
effect was found for children with a high baseline dairy
intake. Thus, there may be a threshold above which
increasing intake of dairy products or dairy-calcium does
not additionally benefit bone mineral content or density
in children.
In adults, interactions between calcium, phosphorus,
protein and vitamin D reduce bone resorption and
increase bone formation, thereby attenuating age-related
bone loss (53). Possibly due to the complex interaction

(page number not for citation purpose)
 between nutrients and the multifactorial nature of bone
fractures, it has been difficult to establish whether or not
a low intake of milk and dairy in adulthood increases the
risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Hence, to date,
meta-analyses have not supported a protective effect of
milk and dairy intake in adulthood on risk of osteoporo-
sis and bone fractures (54, 55). Nevertheless a recent
systematic review concluded that calcium and dairy are
important contributors to bone health in adults (56).
In the 2015�2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
it was stated that ‘Healthy eating patterns include fat-free
and low-fat (1%) dairy, including milk, yoghurt, cheese,
or fortified soy beverages (commonly known as ‘‘soy-
milk’’). Those who are unable or choose not to consume
dairy products should consume foods that provide the
range of nutrients generally obtained from dairy, includ-
ing protein, calcium, potassium, magnesium, vitamin D,
and vitamin A (e.g. fortified soy beverages)’. Although
the focus is on achieving the nutrient requirements by
foods rather than supplements, plant-based beverages
typically contain inorganic chemical forms of calcium,
which may actually increase cardiovascular risk (56, 57).
As calcium in dairy is organic, milk and dairy products
should still be considered the superior sources of calcium
(58). Yet, future studies need to address whether or not
vitamin D fortification of dairy products is crucial for
these to have a positive effect on bone fracture risk.
Conclusion on bone health and osteoporosis
The present evidence suggests a positive effect of milk and
dairy intake on bone health in childhood and adolescence,
but with only limited evidence on bone health in adult-
hood and on the risk of bone fractures in older age.
Cancer
In population studies, dairy has been associated positively
and negatively with various cancers, but most have been
based on limited evidence and very few findings remain
robust. Dairy products contain a variety of bioactive com-
pounds that could exert both positive and negative effects on
carcinogenesis. The positive effects may be related to the
content of calcium, lactoferrin, and fermentation products,
whereas the negative effects could be linked to the content of
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) (59). The World Cancer
Research Fund (WCRF) continuously and systematically
reviews the evidence on diet and physical activity in relation
to prevention of cancer, and specific areas are updated when
new evidence has emerged.
Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of
death among cancers in developed countries. Even though
colorectal tumourigenesis is a complex process, epidemio-
logical and experimental data indicate that milk and dairy
products have a chemopreventive role in the pathogenesis.
In the 2011 WCRF report on colorectal cancer, it
was concluded that consumption of milk and calcium
probably reduces the risk of this cancer (60). Likewise, in
meta-analyses, dairy intake has consistently been asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer (61, 62)
and colon cancer (63). The most recent meta-analysis by
Ralston et al. (64) reported 26% lower colon cancer risk in
males consuming 525 g of milk per day, whereas no
association was found in females.
The link between dairy intake and colorectal cancer is
considered to be mainly due to the calcium derived from
dairy, with a 24% risk reduction with a dairy-calcium
intake of 900 mg/day (65). The proposed mechanisms
behind this are calcium binding to secondary bile acids
and ionised fatty acids, thereby reducing their prolifera-
tive effects in the colorectal epithelium (66). Also, calcium
may influence multiple intracellular pathways leading to
differentiation in normal cells and apoptosis in trans-
formed cells (67). Accordingly, a number of studies have
reported reduced cell proliferation in the colon and
rectum with intake of calcium and dairy products (68�72).
In the 2010 WCRF report on breast cancer, it was
concluded that the evidence for dairy intake and risk of
breast cancer is non-conclusive (73). In accordance with a
meta-analysis from 2011 on prospective cohort studies
(74), a recent meta-analysis by Zang et al. (75), however,
suggested that a high (�600 g/d) and modest (400�600
g/d) dairy intake was associated with a reduced risk of
breast cancer (10% and 6%, respectively) compared with
a low dairy intake (B400 g/d). Within dairy subgroups,
particularly yoghurt and low-fat dairy were found to be
inversely associated with the risk of developing breast
cancer. As calcium and vitamin D supplementation was
previously shown to reduce risk of breast cancer in the
Women’s Health Initiative (76), these nutrients could be
involved in the underlying mechanisms.
According to the 2014 WCRF report on prostate
cancer, dairy may be associated with a limited-suggestive
increased risk of prostate cancer, but the current evidence
is limited (77). However, this conclusion was substantiated
by the most recent meta-analysis by Aune et al. (78),
which suggested that a high intake of dairy products, milk,
low-fat milk, cheese, and calcium were associated with a
3�9% increased risk of prostate cancer. The mechanism
behind this was suggested to be an increased circulating
concentration of IGF-1, which has been previously
shown to be associated with an increased prostate cancer
risk (79).
The 2015 WCRF report on bladder cancer suggested
that the evidence for milk and dairy on bladder cancer
risk was inconsistent and inconclusive (80). Two meta-
analyses on milk intake and bladder cancer risk have
suggested a decreased risk of bladder cancer with a high
intake of milk (61, 81). Others have found no association
between milk and dairy intake and risk of bladder cancer
risk (82), but none have suggested an adverse effect.

 Of the cancer types for which the associations with
dairy intake were not presented in the WCRF reports,
recent
meta-analyses have
suggested
no association
between dairy intake and risk of ovarian cancer (83),
lung cancer (84, 85), or pancreatic cancer (86) and an
inverse association between dairy intake and risk of
gastric cancer in Europe and the United States (87).
Studies in lactose-intolerant individuals
In a limited number of subjects, potential differences in
cancer risk and mortality between lactose-tolerant and
lactose-intolerant individuals (self-reported or assessed by
polymorphisms for the lactase gene) have been reported
under the assumption that lactose-intolerant individuals
consume less milk. However, there may also be other
differences between these two groups that need to be taken
into consideration, for example, genetics, ethnicity, other
dietary habits, smoking, physical activity, and socio-
economic factors.
Ba
´csi et al. (88) examined the role of genetically
determined differences in the ability to degrade lactose
and showed that subjects with deficiencies in the genes
coding for lactase (i.e. subjects not drinking milk due to
intolerance) had an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
This supports the ability of dairy products to reduce
colorectal cancer risk and the causality of this relation.
In the European EPIC study, the hypothesis that the
genetically determined lactose tolerance was associated
with elevated dairy product intake and increased prostate
cancer risk was examined (89). The study included 630 men
with prostate cancer and 873 matched control participants.
Dairy product consumption was assessed by diet ques-
tionnaires, and intake of milk and total dairy products
varied significantly by lactase genotype, with an almost
twofold higher intake in lactose-tolerant compared to
lactose-intolerant subjects. However, the lactase variant
was not found to be significantly associated with prostate
cancer risk. This indicates that residual confounding may
have biased the associations observed between milk and
dairy intake and prostate cancer risk in the observational
studies included in a previous meta-analysis (78).
Ji et al. (90) investigated Swedish subjects with self-
reported lactose intolerance and found a lower riskof lung,
breast, and ovarian cancers compared to lactose-tolerant
subjects. Unfortunately, no information about milk intake,
or other genetic, ethnic, lifestyle (diet, smoking and
physical activity), and behavioural characteristics were
reported. Also, self-reported lactose intolerance may not
be comparable to genetically determined lactose intoler-
ance. Due to potential bias in the design and the lack
of control for known confounders, it is impossible to
conclude about the relationship with dairy intake. Also,
these findings are in contrast with the additional literature
suggesting no or an inverse association between dairy
intake and risk of breast cancer (74, 75), ovarian cancer
(83, 91), and lung cancer (84, 85).
Conclusion on cancer
According to WCRF reports and the latest meta-analyses,
consumption of milk and dairy products probably protects
against colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer,
and breast cancer. Dairy intake does not seem to be
associatedwith riskof pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or
lung cancer, whereas the evidence for prostate cancer risk is
inconsistent. In women, dairy offers significant and robust
health benefits in reducing the risk of the common and
serious colorectal cancer and, possibly, also the risk of
breast cancer. In men, the benefit of the protective effect of
milk and dairy on the common and serious colorectal
cancer is judged to outweigh a potentially increased risk of
prostate cancer.
All-cause mortality
In medical research, the term ‘all-cause mortality’ implies
all causes of death. There are many individual studies
reporting that a high consumption of milk and dairy
products is associated with decreased mortality (92),
unchanged mortality (93), or even increased mortality
(94). However, based on meta-analyses of observational
cohort studies, there is no evidence to support the view
that milk and dairy product intake is associated with all-
cause mortality (45, 95). In a meta-analysis, O’Sullivan
et al. (45) studied whether intake of milk and dairy
products as food sources of saturated fat was related to
all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular
mortality. Neither total dairy intake nor intake of any
specific dairy products was found to be associated with
all-cause mortality. In the most recent meta-analysis
including 12 observational studies of milk intake and
mortality, there were no consistent associations between
milk intake and all-cause or cause-specific mortality (95).
Conclusion on all-cause mortality
The evidence from observational studies confirms that
there is no association between consumption of milk and
dairy products and all-cause mortality.
Comparison of nutrient content and health aspects
of milk and plant-based drinks
In recent decades, the market for milk and dairy substitute
drinks based on, for example, soy, rice, oats, or almonds
has expanded, and calcium-fortified plant-based drinks
have become part of the nutrition recommendations
as alternatives to milk in several countries, such as the
United States, Sweden, Australia, and Brazil. Among
the plant-based milk substitutes, soy drink dominates the
market in the Western world, but the emerging of other
plant-based drinks has influenced the market for soy
drink (96).

(page number not for citation purpose)
 The nutrient density of plant-based milk substitutes
varies considerably between and within types, and their
nutritional properties depend on the raw material used,
the processing, the fortification with vitamins and miner-
als, and the addition of other ingredients such as sugar
and oil. Soy drink is the only plant-based milk substitute
that approximates the protein content of cow’s milk,
whereas the protein contents of the drinks based on oat,
rice, and almonds are extremely low, and the recent review
of Ma
¨kinen et al. (96) emphasises the importance of
consumer awareness of such low-protein contents. More-
over, there are now cases of severe nutritional deficiencies
in children being reported as a result of inappropriate
consumption of plant-based drinks (97, 98).
Despite the fact that most of the plant-based drinks are
low in saturated fat and cholesterol, some of these products
have higher energy contents than whole milk due to a
high content of oil and added sugar. Some plant-based
drinks have a sugar content equal to that of sugar-
sweetened beverages, which have been linked to obesity,
reduced insulin sensitivity (99), increased liver, muscle, and
visceral fat content aswell as increased blood pressure, and
increased concentrations of triglyceride and cholesterol
in the blood (100, 101). Analyses of several commercially
available plant-based drinks carried out at the Technical
University of Denmark showed a generally higher energy
content and lower contents of iodine, potassium, phos-
phorus, and selenium in the plant-based drinks compared
to semi-skimmed milk (102). Also, rice drinks are known
to have a high content of inorganic arsenic, and soy drinks
are known to contain isoflavones with oestrogen-like
effects. Consequently, The Danish Veterinary and Food
Administration concluded that the plant-based drinks
cannot be recommended as full worthy alternatives to
cow’s milk (102), which is consistent with the conclusions
drawn by the Swedish National Food Agency (103).
The importance of studying whole foods instead of
single nutrients is becoming clear as potential nutrient�
nutrient interactions may affect the metabolic response
to the whole food compared to its isolated nutrients. As
the plant-based drinks have undergone processing and
fortification, any health effects of natural soy, rice, oats,
and almonds cannot be directly transferred to the drinks,
but need to be studied directly. Only a few studies have
compared the effects of cow’s milk with plant-based
drinks as whole foods on disease risk markers (104�108).
However, none of these have included commercially
available drinks or disease endpoints. Therefore, the
evidence is currently insufficient to conclude that plant-
based drinks possess health benefits above those of milk
and dairy products. Until more research has been
conducted and a scientifically sound conclusion can be
drawn, health authorities should be cautious about recom-
mending plant-based drinks as acceptable substitutes to
cow’s milk for the general population.
Conclusion on nutrient content and health aspects of milk
and plant-based drinks
Cow’s milk and plant-based drinks are completely dif-
ferent products, both regarding nutrient content and pre-
sumably also health effects. Although there are concerns
about children consuming the low-protein drinks, further
evidence-basedassessmentofthenutritionalandhealthvalue
of the plant-based drinks must await more studies in humans.
Answers to the key questions
Key question 1: For the general consumer, will a diet with
milk and dairy products overall provide better or worse
health, and increase or decrease risk of major diseases
and all-cause mortality than a diet with no or low content
of milk and dairy products?
Consumption of dairy products is associated with an
overall reduced risk of cardiometabolic diseases and some
cancers, whereas only very few adverse effects have been
reported (Fig. 1). Dairy products may therefore have the
potential to reduce the burden of the most prevalent
chronic diseases in the population and to substantially
reduce the health care costs for society (109). Consump-
tion of dairy products is part of the dietary recommenda-
tions in several nations, for example, Sweden, Denmark,
and United States. A general recommendation to reduce
the intake of dairy products in individuals who actually
tolerate them may be counterproductive for health and
could therefore increase health care expenses. However,
more emphasis should be on the foodswhich dairy replaces
in the diet. In addition, as most of the conducted meta-
analyses are on observational data, residual confounding

 cannot be ruled out, and it is also possible that milk and
dairy intake in these studies could be just a marker of diets
of higher nutritional quality.
Key question 2: Is it justified to recommend the general
lactose-tolerant population to avoid the consumption of
milk and dairy products?
In the Nordic countries, as few as 2% of the population
has primary lactase deficiency and can be classified as
lactose-intolerant individuals (110). Yet, most lactose-
intolerant adults can tolerate one glass of milk or a scoop
of ice cream. Cheeses have negligible lactose contents, and
the lactose in yoghurt is digested more efficiently than
other dairy sources due to the bacterial lactase present in
yoghurt which facilitates lactose digestion (111). There-
fore, fermented dairy products, that is, yoghurt and most
cheeses (cottage cheese, as well as soft and hard cheeses),
can be tolerated by lactose-intolerant individuals without
symptoms (111, 112).
The same applies to cow’s milk protein allergy that
typically occurs in 0.1�2.0% of children in the Nordic
countries and Europe (113). Among children with verified
cow’s milk-specific IgE who were re-evaluated 1 year after
diagnosis, 69% tolerated cow’s milk at re-evaluation (114).
Thus, the condition is generally seen to resolve in children.
To warn the general population against dairy consump-
tion based on rare milk allergies would be equivalent to
warn against foods, such as peanuts or seafood due to the
fact that a small subset of the population is allergic to
these foods.
Key question 3: Is there scientific evidence to substantiate
that replacing milk and dairy products with plant-based
drinks will improve health?
Cow’s milk and plant-based drinks are not nutritionally
comparable foods. As only a few studies have investigated
the health effects of replacing cow’s milk with plant-based
drinks and none have focused on commercially available
drinks or on disease endpoints, the effect of this replace-
ment can only be speculated on. There have, however,
been individual cases reporting illness in children con-
suming low-protein plant-based drinks, but an evidence-
based final assessment of the health value of plant-based
drinks compared to cow’s milk must await more studies in
humans.
Overall conclusions regarding intake of milk and
dairy products and health
Our reviewofthe totalityofavailablescientific evidence sup-
ports that intake of milk and dairy products contributes
to meeting nutrient recommendations and may protect
against the most prevalent, chronic non-communicable
diseases, whereas very few adverse effects have been
reported.
