Structured online surveys were used to explore the experiences of the parents of children with refractory epilepsy using medicinal
cannabis in Mexico during September 2016. The surveys, which were completed in full, were reviewed, and 53 cases of children aged
between 9 months and 18 years were identified. Of these, 43 cases (82%) were from Mexico and 10 (18%) were from Latin American
countries. Of the 43 Mexican cases, the diagnoses were as follows: 20 cases (47%) had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS); 13 cases
(30%) had unspecified refractory epilepsy (URE); 8 cases (19%) had West syndrome (WS); 1 case (2%) had Doose syndrome (DS);
and 1 case (2%) had Ohtahara syndrome (OS). In total, 47.1% of cases had previously been treated with 9 or more anticonvulsant
therapies. The parents reported a decrease in convulsions when cannabidiol was used in 81.3% of the cases; a moderate to significant
decrease occurred in 51% of cases, and 16% of cases were free from seizure. The number of antiepileptic drugs being used was reduced
in 9/43 (20.9%) cases. No serious adverse effects were reported, with only some mild adverse effects, such as increased appetite or
changes in sleep patterns, reported in 42% of cases.
1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a common and chronic neurological disorder,
which frequently requires the use of polypharmacy. It has
been calculated that over 50 million people worldwide
suffer from epilepsy, with 85% of these patients residing
in developing countries such as Mexico. Nearly 2.4 million
new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed every year according to
the World Health Organization, “Mental health, Neurology,
Epilepsy” [1]. About 30–35% of patients have refractory
epilepsy (RE), which is defined as a failure to respond to
≥2 antiepileptic drugs according to the new definition of
refractoriness proposed by the International League Against
Epilepsy (ILAE) Agreement in 2010 [2]. In Mexico, the
prevalence rate reported by the Programa Prioritario de
Epilepsia [Epilepsy Priority Programme] centers is 11–15/1000
inhabitants [3]. Thus, it is estimated that there are 1.5 million
patients with epilepsy in Mexico, with 80% of patients
receiving inadequate treatment while 30% of patients have
RE. Some studies carried out in Mexico have reported a
prevalence of between 1.2 and 3%, with Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome presenting in 3% of childhood epilepsy cases [4].
Serious childhood epilepsies are characterized by fre-
quent convulsions, delayed neurological development, and
a deterioration in the quality of life of the child, in these
cases, which do not respond to conventional treatments.
Childhood epilepsies beginning in the first few years of life
are frequently characterized by seizures that are resistant to
available treatments, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs),
ketogenic diet, high doses of steroids, and surgery [5]. When
indicated treatments fail to control their child’s seizures,
some parents turn to alternative treatments. One of these
alternative treatments is cannabidiol-enriched cannabis. The
cannabis plant contains approximately 80 cannabinoids, of
which cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are
the two most abundant [6, 7]. Families often look for
alternative treatments to bridge the gap between the need
for effective treatments and the adverse effects and high

costs of conventional treatments. Therefore, these patients
receive multiple combinations of various antiepileptic drugs;
for many of these patients there are no beneficial treatment
options.
Over the last decade, interest has emerged in the use of
Cannabis sativa in home-made products to treat various types
of childhood epilepsy, and anecdotal evidence of its success
has spread via digital media according to Gupta [8]. From the
international point of view, Epilepsy of the ILAE dedicated
part of June issue 2014 to the theme “Cannabis and Medical
Marijuana for Epilepsy,” which is a support for those who are
“interested in working on the subject,” according to Mathern
et al. [9].
Gradually medical studies regarding the use of these
products have also been published. Gloss and Vickrey [10]
conducted a systematic review of four articles reporting on
the use of C. sativa and concluded that studies in animals
have provided sufficient justification for testing in humans;
however, there is still no consistent evidence regarding its
effectiveness and safety. Porter and Jacobson [11] carried out
an observational study of 19 children with RE aged between 2
and 16 years in Stanford University via a survey using social
media. The results of that survey showed that 16 out of 19
parents (84%) reported a reduced frequency of seizures with
C. sativa. Other effects reported were as follows: improve-
ment in mood (79%), increased state of alertness (74%),
improved sleep (68%), and a reduction in self-stimulating
behaviors (32%). The only adverse effects reported were
somnolence (37%) and fatigue (16%). In another survey of
117 parents of children with RE, due to Lennox-Gastaut
and infantile spasms, Hussain et al. [12] reported similar
improvements over an average treatment time of 6.8 months
using an average dose of 4.3 mg/kg/day of cannabidiol (CBD).
Devinsky et al. [13] recently published the results of an
open multicenter prospective clinical trial, approved by the
FDA, using a pharmaceutical product (Epidiolex�) which is
cannabinoid based, that is, 99% CBD. There was an average
reduction in motor seizures of 36.5% in the 162 children
studied, and an adequate safety profile for CBD was noted.
A bioethics review was recently carried into the use
of CBD in the Epilepsy Clinic of the Hospital General de
M´
exico, CDMX [Mexico General Hospital]. This gave rise to
three proposals regarding its position and offered important
points for consideration in the well-practiced debate on the
legalization of cannabis use. One of the proposals suggests
that, from a neuroethical point of view, the use of CBD
is justified in cases of RE or catastrophic cases, based
on international laws safeguarding human life and dignity
(Kalkach-Aparicio et al. [14]).
We present the first observational study on the medicinal
use of CBD (Medicinal cannabis) in children with RE in
Mexico.
2. Materials and Methods
An online survey was used to explore the experience of
parents administering CBD to children with RE in Mex-
ico. To this end, an online commercial software program
was used (http://www.e-encuesta.com) and a license was
obtained which provided options for designing an unlimited
number of questions of different types (open, closed, and
multiple choice), as well as using filters in a packet of up to
5000 e-mail invitations. The system gathered the responses
and automatically produced a report using basic statistical
analyses. The information was securely stored according to
the guidelines of Amazon Web Services�.
A survey was designed which consisted of 31 questions
in 9 sections. Informed consent was provided and a con-
fidentiality clause was included for personal details, which
required a digital signature from the father or mother as
means of acceptance. The sections were as follows: personal
details, time of evolution and neurological diagnoses, pre-
vious number of conventional anticonvulsants, antiepilep-
tic drugs prior to CBD, total number of seizures in the
month preceding CBD treatment, CBD product, dose and
time of treatment, total number of seizures in the month
following CBD treatment, changes in emotional, cogni-
tive, sleep, and dietary state, side-effects observed during
treatment with CBD, and open feedback on the use of
CBD.
The survey was available for the month of September
2016 and was presented to parents of patients by a link sent
via e-mail or the Facebook group porGRACE (porGRACE
Association A.C.), which was set up to share information
on the use of medicinal cannabis to treat convulsions in
children. Participation in the survey was voluntary and via
self-selection. The criteria for invitation were as follows: (1)
diagnosis of RE, such as Lennox-Gastaut, Dravet, Doose,
or other causes, without symptoms being controlled, and
(2) current use of medicinal cannabis (cannabidiol alone
or in combination). An automated report of all of the
information was obtained, which removed surveys of people
over the age of 18, partially answered surveys, or surveys
of individuals who did not meet the ILAE RE criteria. All
completed surveys were printed and individually analyzed.
Microsoft Excel 2013� was used to input data and generate
graphs.
3. Results
8,757 entries were recorded from 53 completed surveys:
43 cases from Mexico and 10 from other Latin American
countries. The general characteristics of the 43 Mexican
children are shown in Table 1.
The most commonly used product was RSHO-X�
Cannabidiol (76.6%), which contains less than 0.1% THC.
Its import has recently been approved by COFEPRIS (gov-
ernment institution equivalent to the US FDA). 11.5% of
individuals use some sort of combination therapy of CBD +
THC (Charlotte’s web�) and 11.6% of individuals use different
home-made cannabis extract products containing undefined
concentrations of cannabinoids.
The results indicate a decrease in convulsions in 81.3% of
cases, with 7 cases (16%) free from seizure, 22 cases (51%)
showing moderate to significant improvement, and 7 cases
(16%) showing slight improvement. No change was seen in
5 cases (11.6%), and 2 cases (4.6%) showed an exacerbation of
seizures (Table 2).

The improvements reported by parents were related not
only to the frequency of the seizures, but also to their duration
and intensity (Figure 1).
Benefits reported by parents in relation to quality of life
indicators for their children were, for example, improvements
in emotional state, attention, communication, sleep patterns,
and diet (Figure 2).
No serious adverse effects were reported. In 16 cases
(42%) some mild adverse effects were reported, such
as increased appetite or changes in sleep patterns.

4. Discussion
We believe that the reports from parents who participated
in our survey are encouraging when it comes to the use of
cannabidiol in RE in children. The limitations of this survey
are the self-selected cases and the placebo effect, observed as
20% in controlled studies with placebo.
The effectiveness and safety profile of CBD does not vary
greatly from what has been reported by other authors such as
Devinsky et al. [13] and Porter and Jacobson [11], who report
freedom from seizure in 14.5% and 11% of cases, respectively,
compared to 16% of cases in our survey. Reductions in the
frequency of seizures of over 50%, which is an indicator of

the effectiveness of an antiepileptic drug, have been reported
by Devinsky et al. (67%) and Porter and Jacobson (42%)
compared to the 51% reduction noted in our survey.
With regard to the adverse effects of CBD, these are
similar to those reported in the literature [10–13], with the
exception of fatigue. This is likely due to the limitations in
communication in our cases. While some cases experienced
an increase in convulsive seizures during CBD treatment, no
epileptic state or sudden unexpected death was reported in
the Mexican cases.
Rivera-Olmos and Parra-Bernal in a recent review article
[15] commented that preliminary data exist that the use of
CBD in extremely rare childhood epilepsies refractory may
have a therapeutic effect in intractable crises, but controlled
studies based in evidence are still ongoing and have not
been completed. The recommendation is that the use of CBD
in these cases is within a framework of study where the
actual efficiency can be determined and security aspects are
monitored.
These results, and published from other in a large number
of patients, are encouraging and have revived interest in
testing these treatment options, despite the legal restrictions
that exist in many countries.
5. Conclusions
This is the first observational study carried out in Mexico
exploring the use of medicinal cannabis in pediatric RE.

The results of this study indicate that, from the viewpoint
of the parents of children with RE, medicinal cannabis is
useful as an “add on” treatment for their children since it
induces a significant reduction in the frequency, duration,
and intensity of the seizures. It also improved aspects of
the patients’ quality of life in terms of their emotional and
cognitive states, their sleep patterns, and their diet. There
was an absence of serious adverse effects, with only some
tolerable mild adverse effects experienced with this CBD-
based treatment.
We believe that these results support the clinical protocols
being established in large centers where there are a high num-
ber of epilepsy cases and in epilepsy clinics in our country.
The actual role of CBD in particular, and medicinal cannabis
in general, in epilepsy and other neurological pathologies still
needs to be determined.
