Abstract
Short and dysfunctional telomeres are sufficient to induce a persistent DNA damage
response at chromosome ends, which leads to the induction of senescence and/or apopto-
sis and to various age-related conditions, including a group of diseases known as “telomere
syndromes”, which are provoked by extremely short telomeres owing to germline mutations
in telomere genes. This opens the possibility of using telomerase activation as a potential
therapeutic strategy to rescue short telomeres both in telomere syndromes and in age-
related diseases, in this manner maintaining tissue homeostasis and ameliorating these dis-
eases. In the past, we generated adeno-associated viral vectors carrying the telomerase
gene (AAV9-Tert) and shown their therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of cardiac infarct,
aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis. Although we did not observe increased cancer inci-
dence as a consequence of Tert overexpression in any of those models, here we set to test
the safety of AAV9-mediated Tert overexpression in the context of a cancer prone mouse
model, owing to expression of oncogenic K-ras. As control, we also treated mice with AAV9
vectors carrying a catalytically inactive form of Tert, known to inhibit endogenous telome-
rase activity. We found that overexpression of Tert does not accelerate the onset or progres-
sion of lung carcinomas, even when in the setting of a p53-null background. These findings
indicate that telomerase activation by using AAV9-mediated Tert gene therapy has no
detectable cancer-prone effects in the context of oncogene-induced mouse tumors.
Author summary
The ends of our chromosomes, or telomeres, shorten with age. When telomeres become
critically short cells stop dividing and die. Shortened telomeres are associated with onset
of age-associated diseases. Telomerase is a retrotranscriptase enzyme that is able to elon-
gate telomeres by coping an associated RNA template. Telomerase is silenced after birth

 in the majority of cells with the exception of adult stem cells. Cancer cells aberrantly reac-
tivate telomerase facilitating indefinite cell division. Mutations in genes encoding for pro-
teins involved in telomere maintenance lead the so-called “telomere syndromes” that
include aplastic anemia and pulmonary fibrosis, among others. We have developed a telo-
merase gene therapy that has proven to be effective in delaying age-associated diseases
and showed therapeutic effects in mouse models for the telomere syndromes. Given the
potential cancer risk associated to telomerase expression in the organism, we set to ana-
lyze the effects of telomerase gene therapy in a lung cancer mouse model. Our work dem-
onstrates that telomerase gene therapy does not aggravate the incidence, onset and
progression of lung cancer in mice. These findings expand on the safety of AAV-mediated
telomerase activation as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diseases associ-
ated to short telomeres.
Introduction
Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures localized at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes,
which are essential to protect them from degradation and end-to-end chromosome fusions. In
mammals, telomeric DNA consists of TTAGGG tandem repeats bound by a 6-protein com-
plex known as shelterin [1, 2]. Telomerase is a reverse-transcriptase able to elongate telomeres
by the de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto chromosome ends [3]. Telomerase is com-
posed by the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) and by a RNA compo-
nent (Terc), that is used as a template for telomere elongation. Telomerase is active in
pluripotent cells where it elongates telomeres within each generation, but is silenced after birth
in the majority of tissues. In mice, it has been shown that both Terc and Tert are downregu-
lated in the majority of tissues post-natally with some exceptions like the testis and the hemato-
poietic tissues [4–6]. In particular, adult mouse lungs, kidney, heart and brain lack detectable
telomerase activity [4–6]. Thus, in the adult organism telomeres shorten associated to cellular
division owing to the end-replication problem [7, 8]. When telomeres reach a critically short
length this is insufficient to warrant telomere protection thus leading to the activation of a per-
sistent DNA damage response at chromosome ends, ultimately inducing senescence or apo-
ptosis. Several studies have shown that the presence of short/dysfunctional telomeres in the
cell rather than the mean telomere length is what negatively impacts on cell division [9, 10].
Telomere shortening is considered one of the hallmarks of aging as short telomeres have been
shown to be sufficient to induce organismal aging [6, 11, 12]. Even though mice are born with
longer telomeres than humans they show a 100-fold faster rate of telomere shortening than
humans in blood cells [13, 14]. Indeed, by using a single-cell telomere length analysis using a
quantitative FISH technique, we have shown that mouse telomeres shorten with aging in all
mouse tissues. In support of telomeres being rate limiting for mouse aging, first generation tel-
omerase-deficient mice have shorter telomeres than normal and show a decreased mouse lon-
gevity, a phenotype that is anticipated with increasing mouse generations in the absence of
telomerase [13, 15–21]. Thus, there is mounting evidence that although mice have on average,
longer telomeres than humans, they also suffer telomere shortening with aging, and indeed
this shortening is relevant for aging [13, 21].
Similar to the telomerase-deficient mouse models, human germline mutations in telome-
rase and other telomere-related genes are causative of the so-called telomere syndromes (ie.,
aplastic anemia and pulmonary fibrosis) owing to presence of much shorter telomeres than
normal which lead to premature loss of the regenerative capacity of tissues [22].

 Interestingly, owing to its ability to confer unlimited proliferative potential, TERT is also
found over-expressed and mutated in the vast majority of human cancers including lung can-
cer where it is thought to allow cancer cell growth by ensuring a minimal telomere length to
warrant telomere protection [23–31]. Telomerase is also upregulated in mouse tumors [32–
34].
Tert transgenic mouse models with a constitutive telomerase expression in adult tissues
indicated that although Tert over-expression does not have per se an oncogenic activity, its per-
sistent expression throughout organismal lifespan could favor cancer appearance at older ages
[35–38]. Of note, transgenic over-expression of Tert in the context of cancer-resistant mice
results in longer telomeres in the adult organism and in an increased mouse longevity by 40%
[39], thus demonstrating that telomerase has an anti-aging activity by virtue of its ability to
maintain telomeres.
More recently, our group has also shown that reactivation of telomerase activity in adult
mice by using non-integrative gene therapy vectors, which in proliferating cells, only allow
temporary expression of telomerase, is sufficient to extend mouse longevity and delay many
different age-related conditions, without increasing cancer incidence [6]. In particular, we
used adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) to deliver telomerase to adult tissues. These vectors
present many desirable properties as they are non-integrative, show a poor immunogenicity
and an excellent safety profile [40]. They are able to transduce both dividing and quiescent
cells in a wide range of tissues and maintain the expression for a long time [41]. Moreover,
some AAV vectors (as AAV9) have the capability of crossing the blood-brain-barrier and tar-
get brain cells upon intravenous injection in adult mice [42, 43]. In particular, expression of
Tert using AAV9 vectors can delay physiological aging and extend longevity in wild-type mice
without increasing cancer [6]. Moreover, a single treatment with AAV9-Tert vectors showed
therapeutics effects in preventing death by heart failure after induction of myocardial infarc-
tion in mice, as well as in preventing or reversing disease in mouse models of aplastic anemia
and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated to short telomeres [44–46].
Importantly, AAV9-Tert gene therapy has not been shown to increase cancer incidence
either in the context of mouse longevity studies [6] or in the context of the above-mentioned
mouse models of disease owing to short telomeres [44–46]. However, mice are short lived spe-
cies compared to humans, and although mice also spontaneously develop cancer with aging, a
potential long-term pro-tumorigenic effect of telomerase may be missed. To circumvent this,
here we set to study the safety of AAV9-Tert treatment in the context of cancer prone mouse
models. In particular, here we tested the long-term effects of AAV9-Tert gene therapy in an
oncogene-induced lung cancer mouse model. To this end, we tested our AAV9-Tert gene ther-
apy vectors in the well-established lox-stop-lox-K-RasG12V knock-in mouse model in which
endogenous expression of the K-RasG12V oncogene is induced upon Cre expression [47]. Our
results show that AAV9-Tert gene therapy treatment does not affect tumor onset and/or devel-
opment suggesting the safety of this therapy in the context of a cancer-prone background in
mice. Interestingly, we observe that telomerase inhibition previous to the induction of the
oncogene is tumor protective.

Telomerase activation mediated by AAV9 vectors does not favor
K-RasG12V-induced lung carcinogenesis
Here we set out to address the impact of telomerase activation by using Tert gene therapy in a
well-established mouse model of lung cancer initiation and progression. To this end, we used
the well-established oncogenic K-Ras lung carcinogenesis model [47]. This mouse model

 harbors one copy of the K-RasG12V oncogene (K-Ras+/ LSLG12Vgeo) containing a STOP codon
flanked by loxP sites. Expression of the Cre recombinase leads to the excision of the stop cas-
sette and consequent expression of K-RasG12V and its β-galactosidase (β-geo) reporter (Fig 1A).
The Cre recombinase is delivered by intratracheal instillation with replication-defective adeno-
viruses encoding the Cre recombinase (Adeno-Cre) [48]. The telomerase gene is packaged in
adeno-associated virus type 9 (AAV9) and is delivered systemically by intravenous tail injec-
tion [6]. First, we checked whether lung cells could be co-infected with adeno-Cre and with
AAV9 viruses. To this end, we simultaneously transduced mice with adeno-Cre and with
AAV9 carrying GFP (AAV9-eGFP). One week after the viral transductions, mice were sacri-
ficed and lung samples were taken for immunohistochemistry staining of β-galactosidase (β-
geo), a surrogate marker co-expressed with the K-RasG12V, and of GFP (S1 Fig). One week
after induction of oncogenic K-Ras, β-Gal positive cells appear in small clusters of 4–8 cells
that show a cytoplasmic foci staining [49] (S1 Fig). Double staining with anti-β-Gal (brown)
and with anti-GFP (purple) of these samples revealed that these cell clusters were also positive
for GFP, demonstrating that lung cells can be co-infected with adeno viruses and adeno-asso-
ciated viruses (S1 Fig).
Next, to address the impact of AAV9-Tert treatment in the context of oncogenic K-Ras
expression, we tested two possible scenarios. First, we used a “pre-treatment” strategy in which
young 8-week-old mice were first infected by tail vein injection with either AAV9-Null,
AAV9-Tert or a catalytically inactive AAV9-Tert-DN vectors. TERT-DN acts as a dominant
negative and has been previously described by us to inhibit endogenous telomerase activity
and to impair the growth of cancer cell lines [50, 51]. Four weeks after treatment with the viral
vectors, we induced the expression of the oncogenic K-Ras by intratracheal instillation with
replication-defective adenoviruses encoding the Cre recombinase (Adeno-Cre)(Fig 1B). In a
second experimental setting, we used a “simultaneous treatment” strategy in which 12-week-
old mice were treated with either one of the three AAV9 vectors (AAV9-Null, AAV9-Tert and
AAV9-Tert-DN) by tail injection at the same time that they were intratracheally treated with
Adeno-Cre to activate K-Ras (Fig 1B). In both strategies, we included a group of 12-weeks old
mice that were not infected with any of the AAV9 vectors but were treated with adeno-Cre, as
positive control for oncogenic K-Ras tumorigenesis in the absence of AAV9 viral vectors. Two
months after oncogene activation by adeno-Cre inoculation, tumor growth was longitudinally
followed by using computed tomography (CT) every two months (Fig 1B). Mice were sacri-
ficed 40 weeks after oncogene activation and samples were taken for histological analysis (Fig
1B).
In vivo tumor follow-up by CT showed that AAV9-Tert treated mice showed the same
number of mice affected with tumors as well as the same number of tumors per mouse and the
same tumor area as the AAV9-Null treated mice and the untreated control group both in the
“pre-treatment” and “simultaneous treatment” experimental settings (Fig 1C–1I). Interest-
ingly, mice pre-treated with AAV9-Tert-DN vectors before oncogene activation (“pre-treat-
ment group”), showed a significant decrease in the percentage of mice developing tumors at
32 weeks post-oncogene activation (Fig 1C). In addition, pre-treated AAV9-Tert-DN mice
showed less number of tumors per mouse and a reduced tumor area compared to either
AAV9-Tert treated, AAV9-Null treated mice or to the untreated control group at 32 weeks
post-oncogene activation (Fig 1D, 1E and 1I). In contrast, in the “simultaneous treatment”
group, we observed no significant differences between the AAV9-Tert-DN and the other
groups both in the percentage of mice with tumors, in the number of tumors per mice or in
the tumor area (Fig 1F and 1I).
We also studied the impact of AAV9-Tert gene therapy in K-Ras-induced lung tumorigene-
sis in a p53-deficient background, a more aggressive scenario in which lung tumors develop

 even more rapidly [48]. To this end, we first treated the mice with the AAV9 viruses and then
activated oncogenic K-Ras (“pre-treatment” strategy; Fig 1A). Mice were sacrificed 5 months
post-adeno-cre infection for macroscopic quantification of tumor burden (S2 Fig). In this
p53-deficient genetic background, 100% of the experimental mouse groups developed lung
tumors and no significant differences in the number of tumors and in tumor size were
detected between AAV9-Tert treated group as compared to AAV9-null and untreated control
groups (S2 Fig).
All together, these results clearly indicate that telomerase gene therapy has no effect in
tumor onset or in tumor development in a context of oncogenic K-Ras lung tumorigenesis
even in a p53-deficient background, in mice. In contrast, telomerase inhibition by using a
dominant negative Tert gene, administered previously but not simultaneously to oncogene
activation significantly impairs tumor growth.
Telomerase activation mediated by AAV9 vectors does not increase
malignancy in K-RasG12V-mediated lung cancer
To analyze the degree of malignancy of the K-RasG12V lung tumors that appeared in the differ-
ent experimental cohorts, we performed hematoxylin and eosin staining in serial sections of
paraffin embedded lungs at 40 weeks post-oncogene activation in the “pre-treatment” group,
which was the one that showed significant differences in tumor growth in the AAV9-Tert-DN
cohort. Lesions were classified either as hyperplasias, adenomas, or carcinomas. Hyperplasic
lesions showed alveolar-like structures with uniform nuclei and similar to healthy lung tissue.
Adenomas contained cells with slightly enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli and disturbed
the adjacent tissue. Carcinomas presented cells with very large, pleomorphic nuclei, high
mitotic index with aberrant mitosis, and hyperchromatism (Fig 2A–2C). We observed no sig-
nificant differences in the total number of hyperplasic lesions between the different mouse
cohorts (Fig 2A). Similarly, mice pre-treated with AAV9-Tert did not show any significant dif-
ferences in the incidence of adenomas and carcinomas compared to mice treated with the
AAV9-Null or to mice not treated with viruses (mock) (Fig 2B–2C). Interestingly, we observed
a significant reduction in the number of adenomas in the AAV9-Tert-DN pre-treated mice
compared to mock and AAV9-Null pre-treated mice (Fig 2B). Furthermore, the total number
of carcinomas was also lower in mice pre-treated with AAV9-Tert-DN compared to mock,
AAV9-Null and AAV9-Tert treated mice (Fig 2C). These results demonstrate that AAV9-Tert
gene therapy does not increase the malignancy of K-ras induced lung tumors. Again, telome-
rase inhibition by using AAV9-Tert-DN gene therapy vector previous to oncogene-induction
had a significant impact in decreasing both tumor onset and tumor malignancy.
To confirm that the tumors originated from cells simultaneously infected with adeno-cre
and the AAV9 vectors, we first determined K-RasG12V expression in tumors by detecting the
expression of its surrogate β-galactosidase marker by immunohistochemistry (Materials and
Methods). We found that all tumors originated were from adeno-cre infected cells (Fig 2D).
We next determined the presence of the AAV9-Tert/AAV9-Tert-DN viral genomes (vg) in the
transduced with AAV9 (Null, Tert or Tert-DN) vectors by tail vein injection and four weeks after they were infected with Adeno-CRE
intratracheally. In the “simultaneous treatment” group, twelve weeks old mice were infected with AAV9 (Null, Tert or Tert-DN) by tail vein
injection and with Adeno-CRE intratracheally at the same time. In both groups mice were analyzed every 8 weeks by computerized
tomography (CT) until 32 weeks post-oncogene activation. Mice were sacrificed 40 weeks post-oncogene activation for further histological
analysis. C-H CT quantification of the percentage of mice developing tumors (C, F), the number of tumors (D, G) and the area of the tumors

 tumors at the end-point from the different experimental groups. We performed a PCR from
total tumor DNA as template and using primers annealing at the 5’-end within the CMV pro-
moter that drives the expression of the Tert transgene and at the 3’-end within the Tert/Tert-
DN ORF (Fig 2E). We analyze a total of 26 tumors belonging to AAV9-Null, AAV9-Tert and
AAV9-Tert-DN treated mice from the “pre-treatment” from the “simultaneous” group. We
found that the AAV9-Tert/Tert-DN vg was detected in 88% of all the tumors analyzed from the
“pre-treatment” and in 75% of the tumors analyzed from the “simultaneous” group (Fig 2E).
These results clearly show that K-RasG12V induced tumors aroused from cells also infected
with the AAV9 vectors (Fig 2D and 2E).
AAV9-Tert treatment results in Tert mRNA over-expression in the lung
Next, to study whether the effects of the different viral vectors carrying the wild-type and
mutant Tert genes could be related to their expression levels, we studied the transcriptional
expression levels of both Tert and Tert-DN mRNAs in treated lungs both at 8 weeks and 40
weeks post-oncogene activation by using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. We found a simi-
lar upregulation of both Tert and Tert-DN mRNA levels at 8 weeks after oncogene activation
and this up-regulation was maintained, although to lower levels, at 40 weeks after oncogene
activation in both the “pre-treatment” and “simultaneously treatment” cohorts (Fig 3A–3C).
AAV9-Tert treatment results in longer telomeres in lung cells
We showed previously that AAV9 vectors target preferentially alveolar type II cells (ATII) in
mouse lungs (80% of AAV9-infected lung cells are ATII cells) [46]. To address the effects of
treatment with AAV9-Tert and AAV9-Tert-DN viral vectors in telomere length in whole lung
tissue and specifically in ATII cells, we performed an immuno-telomereFISH using an anti-
Sftpc antibody as a marker for ATII cells and a telomeric quantitative FISH probe to measure
telomere fluorescence on lung sections [46]. Telomere fluorescence was measured in healthy
whole-lung tissue and in ATII cells at 8 weeks post-oncogene activation in the “pre-treatment”
group, which was the one that showed differences in tumor growth between the different viral
treatments (Fig 4). The results show that AAV9-Tert treated lungs show significantly higher
telomere fluorescence and a lower percentage of short telomeres (telomeres below 25th percen-
tile of telomere fluorescence) in both healthy whole-lung tissue and in ATII cells compared to
AAV9-Null and AAV9-Tert-DN treated lungs (Fig 4A–4C).
Telomere fluorescence was also measured in healthy whole-lung tissue, in ATII cells, and in
tumors at the experimental end-point (40 weeks post-oncogene activation) in both pre-treated
(Fig 5) and simultaneously treated groups (Fig 6). At the end-point, AAV9-Tert treated mice
in both groups, “pre-treatment” and “simultaneous”, showed longer telomeres and lower per-
centage of short telomeres both in the whole lung and in ATII cells compared to untreated,
AAV9-Null and to AAV9-Tert-DN control groups (Fig 5A–5C and Fig 6A–6C). When telo-
mere length was determined in tumors, we also observed a significant increase in average telo-
mere length and a decrease in the percentage of short telomeres in AAV9-Tert treated samples
pleomorphic nuclei (black arrows), high mitotic index (yellow arrow head) and hyperchromatism (red arrow head). Error bars represent

 compared to untreated, AAV9-Null and to AAV9-Tert-DN control groups (Fig 5D and 5E;
Fig 6D and 6E).
AAV9-Tert-DN treatment induces DNA damage and apoptosis and blocks
proliferation in lung tumors
To understand at the molecular level the impact of different AAV9 treatments on lung tumori-
genesis, we next determined DNA damage (γH2AX-positive cells), apoptosis (C3A-positive
cells), and proliferation (Ki67-positive cells) in tumors at 40 weeks post-oncogene activation
both in the “pre-treatment” and “simultaneous treatment” groups by using immunohis-
tochemistry. Interestingly, in both experimental settings, tumors appearing in the AAV9-Tert-
DN treated mice showed significantly less Ki67-positive cells compared to AAV9-Tert treated
and to control groups (no viral treatment and mice treated with AAV9-Null) (Fig 7A), which
is in agreement with significantly less tumors in this group (Fig 1D and 1E). Importantly, no
significant differences in Ki67-positive cells were observed between AAV9-Tert treated and
control mice (no viral treatment and mice treated with AAV9-Null) neither in the “pre-treat-
ment” nor in the “simultaneous” groups (Fig 7A–7C), which is in agreement with similar
tumor burdens in these groups (Fig 1G and 1H).
Next, we determined the impact of different AAV9 treatments on DNA damage induction
by quantifying the percentage of γH2AX positive cells in the tumors at 40 weeks after onco-
gene-induction both in the “pre-treatment” and “simultaneous treatment” groups. We found
that lung tumors appearing in the mice with AAV9-Tert-DN presented increased number of
cells with DNA damage compared to AAV9-Tert treated and control mice (no viral treatment
and treated with AAV9-Null). Again, the tumors appearing in mice treated with AAV9-Tert
showed a similarly low abundance of cells positive for γH2AX to the untreated and AAV9-Null
treated cohorts (Fig 7D–7F).

 In accordance with higher DNA damage in tumors from mice pre-treated with AAV9-Tert-
DN vectors, we observed increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the AAV9-Tert-DN treated
mice compared to AAV9-Tert treated mice and control mice (untreated and AAV9-Null
treated cohorts) (Fig 7G and 7I). Again, in the “pre-treatment” group we found no significant
differences in the number of apoptotic cells between the AAV9-Tert and control mice (Fig 7G
and 7I). However, no differences in the number of apoptotic cells were observed in the “simul-
taneous treatment” among the different mouse cohorts (Fig 7H and 7I), in agreement with
similar tumor burden in all cohorts within the simultaneous treatment group (Fig 1G–1H)
Altogether, these results indicate that tumor burden in the different cohorts correlates with
proliferation, DNA damage and apoptosis, namely tumors appearing in the AAV9-Tert-DN
“pre-treatment” group have less proliferation and more DNA damage and apoptosis. Impor-
tantly, telomerase overexpression in the AAV9-Tert treated mice did not influence any of
these parameters either in the “pre-treatment” or in the “simultaneous treatment” groups, in
agreement with the fact that AAV9-Tert treatment did not increase lung tumorigenesis.
AAV9-Tert-DN treatment induces telomeric DNA damage in KRas-
induced lung tumors
In order to study the effects of the different gene therapy vectors on DNA damage specifically
located at telomeres, we performed a double immunofluorescence using antibodies against
53BP1 to mark DNA damage foci and TRF1 to mark telomeres in lung tumor sections. To this
end, we quantified the number of cells presenting �4 53BP1 foci within the tumor in the “pre-
treatment” and “simultaneous treatment” groups (Fig 8A–8C). In the “pre-treatment” group,
tumors appearing in the AAV9-Tert-DN treated mice showed a 5-fold increase in 53BP1-posi-
tive cells compared to tumors appearing in untreated mice or mice treated with AAV9-Null
and AAV9-Tert vectors (Fig 8A). In the “simultaneous” group, however, no differences in the
percentage of damaged cells among the four mouse cohorts were detected (Fig 8B). In addi-
tion, the percentage of damaged cells presenting � 2 telomere induced foci (TIF) was 5-fold
higher in tumors from the AAV9-Tert-DN treated group compared to untreated, AAV9-Null
and AAV9-Tert treated cohorts in the “pre-treatment” group (Fig 8D). In the “simultaneous
treated group”, however, no differences in the percentage of cells presenting � 2 TIFs among
the four mouse cohorts were detected (Fig 8E). These results suggest that telomerase inhibition
by using AAV9-Tert-DN gene therapy vectors previous to oncogene activation results in
increased telomere damage associated to oncogenic K-Ras tumorigenesis. This is in agreement
with the reduced tumor burden observed in mice in which telomerase activity was inhibited
by AAV9-Tert-DN before oncogene activation (Fig 1C–1E and Fig 2C). The observation that
AAV9-Tert treatment leads to similar numbers of tumor cells with telomere damage (TIFs)
than the AAV9-Null controls, underlies the non-oncogenic effects of telomerase gene therapy.
AAV9-Tert treatment reduces mRNA levels of the p16 senescence marker
Previous studies showed that K-ras mediated lung carcinogenesis induces senescence in the
pre-neoplastic lesions (adenomas) and that this senescence is overcome in the more aggressive

 lesions [52–55]. Interestingly, short/dysfunctional telomeres have been proposed to be at the
origin of this oncogene-induced senescence [56, 57]. We set to assess whether treatment with
the AAV9-Tert and AAV9-Tert-DN vectors had any effects on the levels of the senescence
marker p16 compared to untreated mice and to mice treated with AAV9-Null. To this end, we
determined p16 mRNA levels at 8 and at 40 weeks post-oncogene activation by using q-PCR
(Fig 8G–8I) [58]. Interestingly, in the “pre-treatment” group, AAV9-Tert treated lungs showed
significantly lower p16 expression compared to AAV9-Tert-DN treated mice and to both
untreated and AAV9-Null treated mice at 8 weeks post-oncogene activation (Fig 8G), suggest-
ing that telomerase expression previous to oncogene activation inhibits senescence induction
at early times during K-Ras induced lung carcinogenesis. However, at 40 weeks post-oncogene
activation these differences were lost and we observed similar p16 mRNA expression levels in
the different mouse cohorts both in the “pre-treatment” and in the “simultaneous” group (Fig
8H and 8I), most likely owing to the more advanced tumor stage. These results indicate that
pre-treatment with AAV9-Tert leads to reduced senescence associated to oncogene-activation,
however, this does not seem to be important for overall tumor progression and aggressiveness.
Discussion
The majority of adult cell types in both humans and mice do not express telomerase and this
results in progressive shortening of telomeres and increased telomere-associated DNA damage
with aging [4–6, 13, 21, 58–64], a phenomenon that is proposed to be among the primary
causes of organismal aging [11]. Mice are born with longer telomeres than humans but the
rate of telomere shortening in blood cells from mice is 100-fold higher than in humans and
telomeres do shorten very significantly during the mouse lifespan [14, 21]. Thus, although
mice have on average longer telomeres than humans, they also suffer telomere shortening with
aging, and indeed this shortening is relevant for aging [13]. In contrast to telomere shortening
in healthy cells, the majority of cancer cells aberrantly reactivate telomerase to achieve unlim-
ited proliferative potential, one of the hallmarks of cancer [65]. Indeed, many different human
cancer types show mutations in either the promotor region or coding regions of the telomerase
catalytic subunit TERT gene [23–31, 66]. Also, a wide variety of mouse cancers activate telome-
rase [32–34]. This frequent re-activation of telomerase in cancer cells, has led to the idea that
the postnatal suppression of telomerase activity in the adult organism may have a role as a
tumor suppression mechanism. However, there is mounting evidence that short telomeres can
also lead to increased cancer, especially owing to accumulation of chromosome aberrations if
DNA damage checkpoints are lost, such as p53 loss [61, 67, 68]. Indeed, cancer incidence
increases with aging and it is also more elevated in the so-called telomere syndromes [69].
Interestingly, constitutive telomerase expression in telomerase transgenic mouse models
shows that telomerase does not act as an oncogene and only leads to slightly higher incidence
of some spontaneous cancer at old ages [36, 37]. More recently, we have demonstrated that tel-
omerase activation using non-integrative gene therapy vectors (adeno associated vectors) does
not lead to increased cancer both in the context of normal physiological aging [6] and in the
context of mouse models of disease including heart infarct [44], aplastic anemia associated to
short telomeres [45], and pulmonary fibrosis owing to short telomeres and low doses of a dam-
aging agent to the lungs [46]. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that chimeric mice with
activation in simultaneously treated mice. C,E Representative images showing ATII cells stained with anti-SFTPC (green cytoplasm,

 a high percentage of cells having much longer telomeres than those that are normal for the spe-
cies are in fact cancer protected in agreement with the fact that these mice accumulate less
DNA damage with aging, thus suggesting that maintaining long telomeres during aging pro-
tect from cancer [70]. However, whether telomerase activation can lead to more cancer in the
context of tumor prone contexts remained to be formally addressed.
Here, we demonstrate that telomerase gene therapy does not affect (either increasing or
decreasing) tumorigenesis in a well-established mouse model of lung carcinogenesis induced
by oncogenic K-ras even in a p53-defficient background [47]. We demonstrate this by using
two independent strategies, one in which we over-express Tert before the induction of the
oncogene and another in which we activate Tert at the same time that we induce the oncogenic
K-Ras allele. This result suggests that endogenous telomerase activation associated to onco-
gene-induced tumorigenesis is sufficient to allow carcinogenesis and that extra telomerase
activation provided by the gene therapy vectors does not affect tumor initiation. Interestingly,
when we treated mice with gene therapy vectors carrying a catalytically dead mutant allele of
Tert that is unable to catalyze the addition of new telomeric repeats, we found a decreased can-
cer incidence but only when the vector carrying the catalytically dead Tert mutant was admin-
istered prior to oncogene activation. This is in agreement with previous finding from our
group showing that catalytically dead Tert acts as a dominant negative blocking endogenous
telomerase activity and inhibiting cancer cell growth [51]. Furthermore, we show here that
expression Tert dominant negative prior to oncogene activation results in lower proliferation
and increased DNA damage and apoptosis, thus contributing to block initiation of K-Ras car-
cinogenesis. Although we cannot rule out that AAV9-Tert-DN might also have some telomere-
independent mechanism to suppress tumor growth, however, the fact that the tumors appear-
ing in mice transduced with AAV9-Tert-DN showed a five-fold increase in telomere induced
foci (TIFs) clearly indicates that Tert-DN expression suppress tumor growth by inducing telo-
mere damage. Of note, this did not occur in the simultaneous treatment group, suggesting that
telomerase inhibition once the tumor is already induced has less effect blocking tumorigenesis
than when telomerase is inhibited prior to oncogene induction most likely owing to the fact
that endogenous telomerase is activated with tumorigenesis.
The tumor suppressive effects observed with AAV9-Tert-DN treatment prior to oncogene
induction are remarkable since telomerase activity is dispensable for transformation of cells
with long telomeres [71]. Indeed, telomerase abrogation in the context of cancer-prone mouse
models, including the K-Ras+/G12D lung tumorigenesis mouse model, only showed anti-tumor-
igenic activity after several mouse generations in the absence of telomerase when telomeres
reached a critically short length [67, 72–74]. However, the fact that AAV9-Tert-DN treatment
prior to oncogene activation significantly delays tumor onset and progression by increasing
telomere-induced DNA damage and apoptosis suggests that telomere length is rate limiting in
the early steps of oncogene-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. These results open new thera-
peutic opportunities using AAV9-Tert-DN gene therapy to prevent tumor induction in cancer
prone settings.

 Finally, we make here the very intriguing finding that AAV9-Tert treatment prior to onco-
gene induction significantly reduced the levels of the p16 senescence marker. It was been pre-
viously proposed that DNA damage associated to oncogene-induced senescence is largely
produced by short/dysfunctional telomeres [57]. Our results support this notion as pre-treat-
ment with telomerase is able to significantly decrease senescence in the early steps of lung car-
cinogenesis. Nevertheless, our results also indicate that senescence does not seem to correlate
with tumor burden, as AAV9-Tert treatment does not impact on the final number of adeno-
mas and carcinomas.
A limitation for any gene therapy as a treatment for human diseases is the potential immu-
nogenic response elicited either by the viral particles or by the product encoded by the trans-
gene. We use, however, AAV vectors that are weak immunogens [75]. Our AAV9 vectors do
not carry any viral gene and no immunogenic response against AAV9 have been reported in
mice [76]. In line with this, we did not observe a significant difference in the tumor burden
between the untreated and the AAV9-null treated mice, although there was a trend to lower
tumor burden in the mice that received the AAV9 vectors in some of the parameters mea-
sured. Regarding the potential immune response against the AAV9-encoded transgene prod-
uct, namely telomerase, we think it is unlikely since the transgene encodes the endogenous
mouse telomerase. In agreement with this, we found no significant difference in the tumor
burden between the AAV9-Null and the AAV9-Tert treated mice. Indeed, we have tested the
AAV9-Tert gene therapy in several previous works and never observed an immunogenic effect
of mouse Tert in mice [6, 44–46]. However, the potential immunogenic response of human tel-
omerase in humans deserves further clinical research.
The experimental design of this work poses the limitation that the delivery of the Cre
recombinase to induce oncogenic K-Ras expression and of telomerase were performed using
different viral vectors, adeno virus and adeno associated virus, respectively. Hence, there was
no mechanism to select for cells that were infected with both virus. Furthermore, owing to the
packaging limit of AAV vectors to 5 kilobases [77], it was not possible to carry both the Cre
and the Tert genes in the same AAV9-vector in the “simultaneous strategy”. Nevertheless, we
observed that the K-Ras expressing tumors also expressed the AAV9-transduced Tert/Tert-DN
genes, indicating that the majority of the tumors originated from cells transduced with the
AAV9 vectors. Furthermore, we show that one week after co-infection with adeno-Cre and
with AAV9-GFP the β-gal positive cells also expressed GFP, demonstrating that lung cells are
susceptible to be co-infected with adeno and adeno-associated virus. However, we cannot rule
out the possibility that some tumors arise from cells only infected by the adeno-Cre and not by
the AAV9 vectors.
One could argue than in a long-lived specie like humans, the exogenous expression of Tert
in a wild-type scenario may take several years/decades to facilitate cancer development, the
time needed to acquire additional oncogenic mutations that eventually lead to malignant
transformation and tumor development. To model the impact of AAV9-Tert in cancer in
short lived mice, we forced oncogenic Ras expression to induce tumorigenesis both in wild-
“simultaneous” group (B). C Representative images of 53BP1 staining. Cells with more than 3 53BP1 foci corresponding to pre-treated

 type and p53-null genetic backgrounds, thereby avoiding this lagging time. In addition, to
avoid that long-term expression of telomerase could facilitate cancer development after several
decades, we use non-integrative AAV9 vectors, which allow only for a transitory expression of
telomerase due to the fact that as cells divide the virus load is progressively diluted until even-
tually cells lose the expression of the transgene (Tert).
In summary, the results shown here demonstrate that telomerase activation by adeno asso-
ciated vectors does not increase lung carcinogenesis even in the context of an activated K-Ras
oncogene, highlighting the safety of therapeutic strategies based on telomerase activation
using AAV9 vectors.
Methods
Mice
K-Ras+/G12V mice were generated as previously described [47]. K-Ras+/G12V mice were crossed
with p53-/- mice (Jackson Labs, http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/002101.html) to generate the
compound K-Ras+/G12V p53-/- mouse. Separated groups of mice were tail-vein injected with
2x1012 vg (viral genomes)/mouse of either AAV9-Null, AAV9-Tert or AAV9-Tert-DN, a cata-
lytically inactive form of mouse TERT. All mice were maintained at the Spanish National Can-
cer Centre under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the recommendations
of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). All animal
experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee (CEIyBA) and performed in accordance
with the guidelines stated in the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research
Involving Animals, developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sci-
ences (CIOMS).
Gene therapy vector production
Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV9) were generated and purified as previously described
[78]. The vectors used were (i) AAV9-Null (ii) AAV9-Tert that express murine catalytic sub-
unit of telomerase (iii) AAV9-Tert-DN that express murine catalytically inactive telomerase
(iv) AAV9-GFP [6]. AAV9 particles were purified using 2 cesium chloride gradients, dialyzed
against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filtered. Viral genome particle titers were deter-
mined by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
Adenovirus intratracheal infection
Twelve-week-old mice were treated once with intratracheal adeno-Cre vectors (Gene Vector
Core, University of Iowa, 1x1010 pfu/ml) instillation with 1x108 pfu/mouse of virus after anes-
thesia by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-medetomidine (Domitor, 1mg/ml; Orion Cor-
poration). To wake up the mice after the instillation, they were injected with 0.05 mg of
atipamezole (Antisedan, 5mg/ml; Orion Corporation).
In vivo imaging by computed tomography (CT)
Eight weeks after adeno-Cre inoculation, an in vivo follow-up of tumor growth was achieved
by four computed tomographies (CT) every 8 weeks. CT analyses were performed as previ-
ously described [79]. Briefly, Micro-CT imaging was performed on a high resolution scanner
(Locus, General Electric HealthCare, London,Ontario,Canada). The scanning protocol oper-
ates at 80 kVp and 50 mA, 400 projections and collected in one full rotation of the gantry in
approximately 10, minutes. The reconstruction was done with a modified Feldkamp cone-

 beam algorithm. Micro-CTimages were analyzed using MicroView Analysis + (v2.2, General
Electric Healthcare, London, Ontario, Canada).
Immunohistochemistry analyses in tissue sections
Lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 5 mm.
For pathological examination sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, according to
standard procedures. Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry in lung tumor sections
included those raised against: γH2AX Ser 139 (Millipore), Ki67 (Master diagnostica), C3A
(Cell Signaling Technology), β-GAL (3A9A; CNIO Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, AM
(3A9A)) and GFP (Cell Signaling). For β-GAL and GFP double staining, the immunohisto-
chemical reaction was developed using 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
(Chromomap DAB, Ventana, Roche) and purple chromogen (Discovery Purple Kit, Ventana,
Roche), respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with Harrys’s hematoxylin. Pictures were
taken using Olympus AX70 microscope.
Real-time qPCR
Total RNA from cells was extracted with the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed
was using the iSCRIPT cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD) according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems,
Life Technologies) using Go-Taq qPCR master mix (Promega) according to the manufactur-
er’s protocol. Samples were run in triplicates. Primers used are as follows: TBP1-F 5’-ACCC
TTCACCAATGACTCCTATG-3’; TBP1-R 5’-TGACTGCAGCAAATCGCTTGG-3’; TERT-F
5’-GGATTGCCACTGGCTCCG-3’; TERT-R 5’-TGCCTGACCTCCTCTTGTGAC-3’; P16-F
5’-TACCCCGATTCAGGTGAT; P16-R 5’-TTGAGCAGAAGAGCTGCTACGT-3’; CMV-F
5’-CAATTACGGGGTCATTAGTTCATAGC-3’.
Telomere length analyses on tissue sections
Quantitative telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) was performed directly on
parafinn-embedded lung sections as previously described [21] and analysed by Definiens soft-
ware. The incidence of short telomeres was calculated as the percentage of telomeres below the
25th percentile of telomere fluorescence in AAV9-null samples.
Immunofluorescence analyses on tissue sections
For immunofluorescence analyses, tissue sections were fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma)
and embedded in paraffin. After desparaffination and citrate antigen retrieval, sections were
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton in PBS and blocked with 1%BSA and 10% Australian FBS
(GENYCELL) in PBS. The antibodies were applied overnight in antibody diluents with back-
ground reducing agents (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-SFTPC
(Sigma), rat polyclonal anti-TRF1 (homemade), anti-53BP1 (Novus Biologicals). Immunofluo-
rescence images were obtained using a confocal ultraspectral microscope (Leica TCS-SP5).
Quantifications were performed with Definiens software. A double immunofluorescence
using antibodies against 53BP1 to mark DNA damage foci and TRF1 to mark telomeres was
performed in lung tumor sections to assay for telomeric DNA damage specifically located at
telomeres.
