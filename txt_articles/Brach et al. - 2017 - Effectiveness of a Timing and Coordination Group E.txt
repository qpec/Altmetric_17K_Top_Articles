IMPORTANCE Timing and coordination exercises may be an important addition to
community-based health promotion exercise programs to improve walking in older adults.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of the On the Move group exercise program, which
focuses on the timing and coordination of movement, with a seated strength, endurance, and
flexibility program (usual care) at improving function, disability, and walking ability of older
adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster-randomized, single-blind intervention trial.
Thirty-two independent living facilities, senior apartment buildings, and senior community
centers were randomized to On the Move (16 sites; 152 participants) or usual care (16 sites;
146 participants). Participants were 65 years or older, able to ambulate independently with a
gait speed of at least 0.60 m/s, able to follow 2-step commands, and were medically stable.
INTERVENTIONS Exercise classes were 50 minutes, twice a week for 12 weeks and had 10 or
fewer participants per class. On the Move consisted of warm-up, timing and coordination
(stepping and walking patterns), strengthening, and stretching exercises. The usual-care
program consisted of warm-up, strength, endurance, and stretching exercises.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were self-report of function and
disability (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument) and mobility (6-minute walk distance
and gait speed) assessed by blinded individuals.
RESULTS Participants (mean [SD] age, 80.0 [8.1] years) were mostly female (251 [84.2%])
and white (249 [83.6%]) and had a mean (SD) of 2.8 (1.4) chronic conditions. Intervention
groups were similar on baseline characteristics. Postintervention, 142 (93.4%) participants in
On the Move and 139 (95.2%) participants in usual care completed testing. On the Move had
greater mean (SD) improvements than the usual-care group in gait speed (0.05 [0.13] vs
−0.01 [0.11] m/s; adjusted difference = 0.05 [0.02] m/s; P = .002) and 6-minute walk
distance (20.6 [57.1] vs 4.1 [55.6] m; adjusted difference = 16.7 [7.4] m; P = .03). Attendance
was greater in the usual-care program compared with On the Move (95 [65.1%] vs 76
[50.0%] attended �20 classes; P = .03). There were no significant differences in any of the
other primary or secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The On the Move group exercise program was more effective
at improving mobility than a usual-care exercise program, despite lower attendance.
Additional research examining the impact of the intervention on long-term disability
outcomes is needed before recommending routine implementation into clinical practice.

alking difficulty is a common, costly condition in
older adults.1 Walking difficulty contributes to loss
of independence, higher rates of morbidity, and in-
creasedmortality.2,3Exerciseisbeneficialtophysicalandmen-
tal health and may prevent walking difficulty.4-6 Community-
based group exercise programs are 1 option for promoting
health and wellness and could potentially be used to improve
walking in older adults.
Studies examining the impact of group exercise pro-
grams on walking have conflicting findings and
limitations.7-11 Many of the studies were small, conducted in
“young” older adults, or the control groups were nonexer-
cise. The 1 group exercise program that did improve mobility
consisted of a high dose of exercise (65 minutes a day, 5 days
a week for 24 weeks), which may not be acceptable to most
older adults.7 Whereas many group programs emphasize
lower extremity muscle strengthening, flexibility, and gen-
eral conditioning because of the association of related
impairments with walking difficulties,12 they have failed to
focus on the ability to walk or the timing and coordination of
movement that is critical to walking.7-9,11 Previously, thera-
peutic, individually supervised exercise led by physical
therapists that includes timing and coordination compo-
nents has been shown to improve walking in older
adults.13-16 Therefore, timing and coordination exercises
could be an important addition to community-based health
promotion group exercise programs to improve walking.
Based on previous research,14,15 and with critical input
from older adults and other stakeholders, the On the Move
(OTM) group-based exercise program that includes timing
and coordination and focuses on improving walking was
developed.17 A pilot study showed that OTM was feasible and
acceptable.17 We now report the results of a large patient-
centered comparative effectiveness trial establishing the
effectiveness of OTM against a usual-care group exercise pro-
gram in community-dwelling older adults residing in inde-
pendent living facilities, senior apartment buildings, and
attending senior community centers. We hypothesized that
OTM would produce greater gains in self-reported function
and disability and walking ability, be acceptable and low in
risk, and would result in greater satisfaction and adherence
than the usual-care group exercise program.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
Detailed methods are published elsewhere.18 As described
therein, all major components of the study design including
formulation of hypotheses, participants, randomization, and
outcomes were influenced by input from stakeholders and de-
cided on with a patient-centered view. Briefly, the trial was de-
signed to establish the effectiveness and explore the sustain-
ability of the OTM group exercise program. The study was a
cluster-randomized, single-blind intervention trial to com-
pare the effects of OTM and a usual-care group exercise pro-
gram in community-dwelling older adults. The sustainability
of the program, defined as similar benefits when taught by a
community member, is being explored elsewhere (D. Wert,
PhD, PT, et al, unpublished data, May 2017). The study was ap-
proved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review
Board and registered in clinicaltrials.gov, and signed in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants. The study
protocol is available in Supplement 1.
Study Participants
Participants were recruited between April 2014 and January
2016, from those individuals residing in independent living fa-
cilities and senior housing, and attending community cen-
tersinthegreaterPittsburgh,Pennsylvania,area.Inclusioncri-
teria were age 65 years or older, a resident or member of the
participating facility, and ability to ambulate independently
(with or without a straight cane) with a gait speed of at least
0.60 m/s. Individuals with a gait speed less than 0.60 m/s have
difficulty participating in the program and raise safety con-
cerns in the group exercise setting. Those non-English speak-
ing; unable to follow a 2-step command or understand the in-
formed consent process; planning to leave the area for an
extendedperiodoftime;withaprogressiveneuromusculardis-
order; with any medical condition or illness that was not stable
(ie, unplanned hospitalization for a life-threatening illness or
major surgery in the past 6 months); or with a post–6-minute
walk test heart rate of at least 120 beats per minute, systolic
blood pressure of at least 220 mm Hg, a drop in systolic blood
pressure of greater than 10 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pres-
sure of at least 110 mm Hg were excluded.
Interventions
Both exercise programs were group based, had identical fre-
quency and duration (50 minutes, twice a week for 12 weeks),
had 10 or fewer participants per class, and were delivered by
trained exercise leaders (ie, physical therapists or physical
therapy assistants). All exercise sessions were held on site at
the facilities and were initiated within 2 weeks of baseline test-
ing.Exerciseprogramfidelitywasdeterminedthroughsitevis-
its by the program developers. A detailed description of both
interventions can be found in the eMethods in Supplement 2.
On the Move was based on principles of motor learning
that enhance “skill,” or smooth and automatic movement
control.19-21 The program contained a warm-up, stepping
patterns, walking patterns, strengthening, and cool-down.22
Key Points
Question What is the effectiveness of a timing and coordination
group exercise program (On the Move) compared with a seated
strength, endurance, and flexibility exercise program (usual care)
for improving mobility in community-dwelling older adults?
Findings In this single-blind cluster-randomized trial that included
298 older adults, participants in the On the Move group had
greater improvements in mobility than those in the usual-care
group.
Meaning Group exercise programs to improve mobility in older
adults should include timing and coordination exercises that are
important for walking.

 The stepping and walking patterns were goal-oriented, pro-
gressively harder patterns that promoted the timing and
coordination of stepping, integrated with the phases of the
gait cycle.20(pp181-194)21,23 The goal of the stepping patterns
was to facilitate a shifting of the center of pressure postero-
lateral and then forward, encouraging hip extension. Step-
ping patterns consisted of stepping forward and across the
midline of the body with 1 foot for several repetitions fol-
lowed by stepping forward and across the midline with the
opposite foot. A similar activity was conducted with back-
ward stepping. Stepping was progressed from stepping on all
1 side, to alternating left and right steps, to alternating for-
ward and backward stepping. The goal of the walking pat-
terns was to promote a shift of the center of pressure during
medial stance and to promote the timing and interlimb coor-
dination of muscle activations (ie, abductors of the immi-
nent swing limb with the adductors of the stance limb). Pat-
terns consisted of ovals, spirals, and serpentines that were
progressed by changing the amplitude of the pattern (ie, nar-
rower oval), altering the speed of walking, or increasing the
complexity of the task (ie, walking past other walkers or
object manipulation while walking). Exercises were pro-
gressed when participants correctly completed the activity
at least 80% of the time. Only 1 item—amplitude, speed, or
complexity—was progressed at a time. The strengthening
program focused on lower extremity muscle groups impor-
tant for walking. A detailed description of OTM can be found
in Brach et al.17 The majority of the program was conducted
in standing (40 minutes), with only 10 minutes in sitting.
The usual-care group exercise comparator was a seated
strength, endurance, and flexibility program based on pro-
grams being conducted in the community-based facilities. The
usual-care exercise program contained a warm-up, upper and
lower extremity strength exercises, aerobic activities, and a
cool-down. The warm-up and cool-down contained gentle
range-of-motion exercises and stretches. Strengthening exer-
cises focused on upper and lower extremity muscle groups and
usedplaygroundballs,theoppositeextremity,andbodyweight
to provide resistance to the movements. Aerobic activities
included repeated movements of the lower extremities
(marching, tapping, and skiing) at various speeds. Upper ex-
tremity movements were added to increase the intensity of the
activity. The entire program was conducted while sitting
(50 minutes).
Randomization
We randomized facilities equally to the 2 interventions strati-
fied by facility type. Participating independent-living facili-
ties were known ahead of time and further stratified by socio-
economic status, academic medical center affiliation, and
location in adjacent county before randomization to achieve
a balance by design. Each of the other 2 facility types was ran-
domizedastheyagreedtoparticipate,usingrandomblocksizes
of 2 and 4. Facility assignment was revealed to the coordina-
tor only after baseline testing. We then randomized partici-
pants within each facility to a class run by a study exercise
leader (primary aim) or a subsequent one by a facility staff
activity person (exploratory sustainability aim). Per a midtrial
protocol modification approved by the sponsor for potential
safety concerns, if a suitable facility staff person was not avail-
able, their class was also taught by an exercise leader, and
participants were analyzed accordingly.
Outcomes
All measures were collected at baseline prior to randomiza-
tion, immediately prior to intervention in those randomized
to a subsequent class, and immediately following the 12-
week intervention by blinded personnel. All testing was
conducted on site at the facilities.
The primary outcomes were Late Life Function and Dis-
ability Instrument (LLFDI) overall function and disability fre-
quency domains, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and gait
speed. The LLFDI is a pair of self-report instruments targeted
for assessing physical function and disability in older adults
with acute or chronic problems, and designed to be more sen-
sitive to change than similar measures. The LLFDI has estab-
lished known-groups validity and test-retest reliability
(0.68-0.98).24,25 Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores
representing greater function. The 6MWD included time for
restasneeded26andhasexcellenttest-retestreliability(0.95)27
and construct validity.28 A 20-m change in 6MWD is consid-
ered small but meaningful, and 50 m, substantial.29 Gait speed
is a strong indicator and predictor of disability, morbidity, and
mortality,2,3,30 and was assessed on an instrumented walk-
way (Zeno Walkway, Zenometrics). Participants completed 6
passes at their usual speed, which were averaged. Gait speed
has excellent test-retest reliability (0.98).31 A 0.05-m/s change
in gait speed is considered small but meaningful, and 0.10 m/s,
substantial.29 The secondary outcomes were Figure of 8 walk
test, modified Gait Efficacy Scale, Short Physical Perfor-
mance Battery, gait variability, and complex walks.32-35 Demo-
graphic characteristics, fear of falling, fall history, height, and
weight were self-reported. Chronic condition burden was as-
sessed with a self-reported comorbidity index indicating 18
common conditions. Eight domains (cardiovascular, respira-
tory, musculoskeletal, neurological, general, cancer, diabe-
tes, and visual) were derived and summed.36
Participant satisfaction was assessed by exit surveys. The
items included degree of satisfaction with components of the
exercise program (the exercises, safety, individualized instruc-
tion, satisfaction, and likelihood of continued participation),
participants’ expectations, perception of benefit from the
program, and likelihood of recommending the program to oth-
ers, and included open-ended questions.
Adherence was measured by class attendance rosters. Rea-
sons for missed classes were recorded when available. Ad-
verse events during testing or intervention were recorded for
review by the study physician for adjudication and direction.

Statistical Analysis
We performed a prespecified intention-to-treat analysis. Par-
ticipant flow was summarized using a CONSORT diagram.38
First, the baseline participant characteristics were compared
between the 2 arms. Second, we performed a multivariate
Hotelling t test to simultaneously compare the baseline to fol-
low-up change in the primary outcomes between arms to pro-
tect the type I error rate from multiplicity. On observing sig-
nificance, subsequent analyses were to be performed without
further multiplicity adjustment. Third, we fit linear mixed
models39(pp275-283) with baseline to follow-up change in con-
tinuous outcomes as the dependent variable; intervention arm
as the fixed effect of interest; baseline value of outcome as a
covariate; and a facility random effect for site clustering. We
used multiple imputation to account for missing data.40(p15-18)
Fourth, dichotomous secondary outcomes were analyzed
similarly, but using a generalized estimating equations
model41(pp146-147) with a binomial distribution, logit link, and
an exchangeable correlation structure for clustering. Fifth, we
explored with a series of unplanned subgroup analyses strati-
fied by adherence, setting, and baseline performance and/or
function. Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses of re-
sults to additionally adjust for baseline characteristics differ-
ent between groups, using immediate preintervention mea-
surement instead of prerandomization baseline for those in a
subsequent class, and ignoring missing data. SAS, version 9.3,
software (SAS Institute, Inc) was used.
Results
See the Figure for participant flow and sources of missing data
(and eFigure, A and B in Supplement 2 for a comprehensive
CONSORT diagram of the entire trial). Of the 37 sites con-
tacted, 32 participated. Three were not interested, and 2 had
insufficient numbers of participants. By telephone or in per-
son, 560 were screened for initial eligibility, among whom 482
were eligible and assessed in person (17 failed: 5 used a walker;
5 too young; 7 for other reasons). Of them, 476 completed
screening (6 did not: 3 refused to sign the liability waiver; 3
changed mind). Of the 52 screen failures, 37 had gait speed less
than 0.6 m/s and 15 had abnormal blood pressure and/or heart
rate, leaving 424 for trial participation. Of the 32 sites, 16 were
randomized to OTM and 16 to usual-care intervention where
exercise leaders taught 152 and 146 participants, respec-
tively. In OTM, 142 (93.4%) completed postintervention test-
ingand10didnot(4losttofollow-up,5healthissues,1dropped
out). In the usual-care program, 139 (95.2%) completed post-
intervention testing and 7 did not (1 lost to follow-up, 3 health
issues, 3 dropped out).
Participants had a mean (SD) age of 80.0 (8.1) years, were
mostly female (84.2%) and white (83.6%), and had a mean (SD)
of 2.8 (1.4) chronic conditions. Participants walked slowly
(mean [SD] speed, 0.91 [0.21] m/s), and 170 (57.0%) had a
6MWDlessthancommunityambulationdistance(300m).The
intervention groups were similar except minor differences in
facility type (Table 1).
The 2 groups had significantly different improvements,
when primary outcomes were simultaneously considered in
a multivariate test (P = .02). The OTM group had significantly
greater mean (SD) improvements than the usual-care group in
gait speed (0.05 [0.13] vs −0.01 [0.11] m/s; adjusted differ-
ence = 0.05 [0.02] m/s; P = .002) and 6MWD (20.6 [57.1] vs 4.1
[55.6] m; adjusted difference = 16.7 [7.4] m; P = .03). A mean-
ingful improvement in gait speed (0.05 m/s) was achieved by
64 of 152 (42.1%) and 36 of 146 (24.7%), respectively, in the 2
groups,resultinginanumberneededtotreatof5.7.Therewere
no significant differences between groups in other outcomes
(Table 2 and Table 3).
Participants in OTM were less likely than usual-care pro-
gram participants to attend at least 20 of the 24 classes (76
[50.0%] vs 95 [65.1%]; odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.95;
P = .03) (Table 3). The majorities in both programs felt that
they benefited from the class; the classes were at least some-
what challenging; they received just enough or more person-
alized instruction; and felt safe or very safe while doing the
exercises. In both groups, almost all (128 [97.0%] and 126
[96.9%]) were satisfied or very satisfied and said that they
would continue with the same program if offered (113
[85.6%] vs 108 [83.1%]).
Unplanned exploratory subgroup analyses showed sig-
nificanttreatmentbyclassattendance(P = .01)andfacilitytype
(P = .04) interactions with respect to 6MWD. We hypothesize
that those attending 20 or more classes (mean [SE] 6MWD im-
provement, 31.8 [9.4] m; P = .002) or from community cen-
ters(mean[SE],48.9[17.3]m;P = .005)mayderivegreaterben-
efits from OTM than the usual-care program. There were 4
adverse events (falls, fatigue, pain), and all occurred during the
OTMclasses.Sensitivityanalysesdidnotmateriallychangethe
results (data not shown).
Discussion
The On the Move program, designed to target the timing and
coordination of movement important for walking, elicited
greater improvements in mobility than a usual-care seated
groupexerciseprogramwhentaughtbyanexerciseleader.The
greater gait speed gain was both statistically significant and
clinically meaningful based on the 0.05-m/s criterion, with a
favorable 5.7 needed to treat.29 The greater 6MWD gain was
close to the small but meaningful change criterion of 20 m.29
The greater improvements in mobility in OTM compared with
the usual-care group occurred despite the lower adherence.
Our findings support the idea that timing and coordination ex-
ercise should be included in group exercise programs to im-
prove mobility in older adults. Individuals in OTM did not
report greater improvements in function and disability than
the usual-care group. One possible explanation is that mobil-
ity performance improvement may not have reached a thresh-
old that the older adults would recognize as affecting overall

 function and disability. Another possible explanation is that
the intervention may need to be of a longer duration to affect
function and disability.
Although the number of adverse events experienced dur-
ing the trial was minimal (4 events), it is important that all the
events occurred during the OTM program. They were ex-
pected adverse events of exercise and did not prohibit any-
one from finishing the program. All who experienced an event
were willing and able to return to exercise. Previously, we had
found that older adults recognize the risks of more challeng-
ing exercises yet believe that the risks are worth the benefit.17
Attendance in OTM was lower than in the usual-care ex-
ercise program. Participants were equally satisfied with either
program, and they felt safe in both programs. On the Move is
conducted primarily while standing and was designed to be a
more challenging program than the usual-care class. One
potential explanation for the lower adherence is that an indi-
vidual who had a health status change during the 12-week
program may have been more likely to continue in the usual-
care program, which was completed while seated, than in the
OTM program, which was completed primarily while stand-
ing. Another potential explanation is that participants need a
certain level of baseline reserve to elicit greater gains from
OTM than the usual-care program, as suggested by weak evi-
dence of greater between-intervention differences among
faster walkers than slower walkers from the post hoc sub-
group analyses.

 important first step in the translation of OTM into wide-
spread use in the community.
Our study has several strengths. First, ours was a real-
world community-based comparative effectiveness study42 in
which we compared OTM with a usual-care exercise program
instead of a passive nonintervention control. Many of the pre-
vious research reports on community-based group exercise
programshavecomparedagroupexerciseprogramwithanon-
exercise control,7-9 whereas ours was evaluated against a more
challengingusual-careexerciseprogram.Notonlywasthecom-
parator an active exercise program, but it was also one well
taught by trained exercise professionals. Despite being held to
a more challenging standard, we were able to demonstrate a
greater improvement in mobility with OTM. Second, we were
able to demonstrate the effectiveness on site in 3 different set-
tings. All testing and interventions were delivered at the fa-
cilities, thus indicating that the program can be conducted in
various community locations, which supports implementa-
tioninavarietyofsettings.Third,participantswereolder,many
had multiple chronic conditions and impaired mobility, and
approximately one-third reported fear of falling and a history
of falls. The participants constituted a somewhat frail group
of old-older adults, usually not included in community-
based exercise studies.
Limitations
Some limitations should be considered. In some sites, all
individuals were not taught simultaneously, but in classes
conducted in series. The study was so designed that during
the first session taught by an exercise leader, we could train
the staff activity personnel to lead the second session. Conse-
quently, participants randomized to the staff activity person-
nel class had to wait 12 weeks before starting their exercise
sessions. The additional waiting time could have exposed the
participants to additional health events, fatigue of waiting,
and disappointment of not being taught by a professional.
Second, outcomes were examined immediately following the
intervention; thus, the long-term intervention effects on
mobility, function, and disability and whether the mobility
improvements persist over time is unknown. Last, our
heterogeneity of treatment examination was exploratory, and
we have interpreted cautiously contingent on significant
interactions. Interaction tests43 have low statistical power
and require large samples, and thus we may have been
unable to generate hypotheses about important subgroups.
With the present findings, a larger study aiming for confirma-
tory subgroup conclusions may now be warranted.
Conclusions
From a community-based health promotion and wellness
exercise programming perspective, the On the Move group ex-
ercise program was more effective at improving mobility than
ausual-caregroupexerciseprogram,despitelowerattendance.
Additional research examining the impact of the intervention
onlong-termdisabilityoutcomesisneededbeforeroutineimple-
mentation into clinical practice can be recommended.
