Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of 
Plasmodium species that infect humans has been hampered by a 
lack of genetic information for three human-infective species: P. 
malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri)1. 
These species are prevalent across most regions in which malaria 
is endemic2,3 and are often undetectable by light microscopy4, 
rendering their study in human populations difficult5. The exact 
evolutionary relationship of these species to the other human-
infective species has been contested6,7. Using a new reference 
genome for P. malariae and a manually curated draft P. o. curtisi 
genome, we are now able to accurately place these species within 
the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative 
that infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in 
the P. malariae lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to 
be capable of colonization of both human and chimpanzee hosts. 
Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations occurred over 
similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome that 
is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be 
linked to their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae 
expresses a family of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have 
structural similarities to a protein crucial for invasion of red blood 
cells. The data presented here provide insight into the evolution of 
the Plasmodium genus as a whole.
A reference genome of P. malariae was produced from  
clinically 
 
isolated parasites and sequenced using long-read sequencing 
 
technology (Table 1; Supplementary Information). The assembly 
surpasses available draft genome data for P. malariae7, especially in 
terms of contiguity (63 versus 7,270 scaffolds, N50 = 
 2.3 Mb versus 
6.4 kb) (Supplementary Information; Extended Data Table 1) allowing 
large-scale structural changes to be accurately determined. Against a 
background of near-complete collinearity with P. vivax, we found a 
previously undescribed large reciprocal translocation between chromo-
somes 6 and 10 and a pericentric inversion of chromosome 5 (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a, b). Additional draft genomes for both species of P. ovale 
were assembled from P. falciparum co-infections and the genome of a 
parasite that we call ‘P. malariae-like’ was assembled from a chimpanzee 
co-infected with P. reichenowi (Fig. 1; Table 1; Extended Data Table 2; 
Supplementary Information).
To investigate host-specific adaptation of parasites to human and 
chimpanzee hosts, we compared P. malariae to P. malariae-like. 
 
We found lower levels of nucleotide diversity in the human-infective 
species than in the chimpanzee-infective species (Table 1; Extended 
Data Fig. 2a). This mirrors the lower levels of nucleotide diversity in the 
human parasite P. falciparum than in its chimpanzee-infective relative 
P. reichenowi8. In both cases, the lack of diversity in human-infective 
species suggests recent population expansions. However, we found 
that a species that infects New World primates termed P. brasilianum 
was indistinguishable from P. malariae (Extended Data Fig. 2b), as 
 
previously suggested9. Thus host adaptation in the P. malariae lineage 
appears to be less restricted than in P. falciparum.
Using additional samples to calculate standard measures of molecular 
 
evolution (Methods; Supplementary Information), we identified a 
 
subset of genes under selection in both P. malariae and P. malariae-like 
and in an earlier study of P. falciparum and P. reichenowi10 (Extended 
Data Fig. 3a; Extended Data Table 3), showing some conservation 
of selection pressures in Plasmodium lineages and suggesting host- 
specific adaptation of parasites to human and chimpanzee hosts. There 
is  
evidence that five genes are under diversifying selection in both 
 
lineages (Extended Data Fig. 3b), including one encoding Merozoite 
surface protein 1 (msp1). Two genes expressed in blood stages are 
under significant balancing selection in both comparisons (Extended 
Data Fig. 3c): the genes encoding Apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) 
and an uncharacterized conserved protein. Genes under significant 
 
selection in both comparisons are enriched for ‘pathogenesis’ and ‘entry 
 
into/exit from host cell’ Gene Ontology terms. The increased  
signatures 
of selection in the P. malariae lineage reflect a genome-wide increase 
in fixed nonsynonymous mutations in this species (Extended Data 
Fig. 3d). One of the genes with the highest ratio of nonsynonymous 
to synonymous mutations in the P. malariae and P. malariae-like 
 
comparison is reticulocyte-binding protein 1a (RBP1a), prompting 
 
us to hypothesize that human genes encoding transmembrane proteins 
that act as potential RBP1a receptors would have to be conserved in 
red blood cells between humans and New World primates but not with 
chimpanzees (Supplementary Information; Methods; Extended Data 
Table 4). As expected from the recent divergence of P. malariae from 
 
P. malariae-like, more genes were found with signatures of selection in 
P. malariae than between the two P. ovale species (Table 1; Extended 
Data Fig. 3a; Supplementary Information).
Using the added accuracy of manually curated gene sets for both 
 
P. malariae and P. o. curtisi (Table 1; Methods), maximum likeli-
hood trees were constructed using 1,000 conserved single-copy 
core genes that are present in 12 selected Plasmodium species 
 
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Information). There is strong evidence that 
P. malariae forms an out-group both to rodent-infective species and 
to a primate-infective clade that includes P. vivax. This  
phylogenetic 
arrangement is identical to that found using apicoplast data6 but

contrasts with other previous studies1,7,11 (Supplementary Information). 
However, our phylogenetic analysis is based on the most comprehensive 
amino acid alignment to date, which is enriched for neutrally evolving 
sites through stringent filtering and has been subjected to a number 
of different sensitivity tests (Supplementary Information). Assuming 
consistent mutation rates and generation times across the branches 
(Supplementary Information), we find that the relative split between 
the two P. ovale species is about five times earlier than the split between 
P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, whereas P. malariae and P. malariae-like 
seem to have split at a similar time to the latter two (Fig. 2).
Manual curation of about 5,000 gene models of both P. malariae 
and P. o. curtisi enabled a detailed exploration of lineage-specific 
differences in gene content (Table 1), with some paralogous 
 
expansions being particularly notable (Extended Data Fig. 1c, d). 
Genes potentially involved in formation of hypnozoites in P. ovale—
the lifecycle stage responsible for relapse infections—were also iden-
tified (Supplementary Information). The manual curation enabled 
pseudogenes that are  
differentially distributed between the two 
genomes and other human-infective Plasmodium species (Extended 
Data Table 5) to be analysed in ways not possible using computer- 
annotated draft genome data7. For instance, pseudogenes are found 
among a paralogously expanded family of invasion-associated RBPs 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a–e), and a homologue of a P. falciparum cyclin 
(PF3D7_1227500) is only pseudogenized in P. o. wallikeri and may

be linked to the  
difference in relapse times between the two P. ovale 
species12.
Large multigene families are a defining feature that distinguish 
the genomes of malaria species but are refractory to detailed  
analysis 
in non-curated draft genome data. In P. malariae and P. ovale, 
 
approximately 40% of the total genome is subtelomeric. However, the 
gene  
content of the subtelomeres differs substantially between the two 
 
species (Fig. 3a; Table 1). The breadth and sequence types of the pir 
gene repertoires of the P. ovale species are similar to P. vivax, whereas 
P. malariae contains only a restricted subset (Extended Data Fig. 5a). 
The ancient divergence of the two P. ovale species is supported by their 
pir repertoires being readily distinguishable (Extended Data Fig. 5b). 
Despite being sister taxa to P. ovale, the pir repertoire of rodent malaria 
 
parasites, however, appears to be completely different (Extended Data 
Fig. 5a). Moreover, almost 50% of pir genes in P. malariae are pseu-
dogenes (compared to 25% in P. o. curtisi and 9% in P. vivax), suggesting 
an even smaller functional repertoire.
The most notable difference in the subtelomeres of P. malariae is the 
presence of two large gene families that were not apparent in  
earlier 
partial genome data7, and which we have termed fam-l and fam-m 
(Fig. 3a). Proteins encoded by fam-l and fam-m show characteristics 
of proteins that are probably exported from the parasite to the infected 
red blood cell surface (PEXEL export signal, signal peptide, transmem-
brane domains, and a variable region). Most fam-l and fam-m genes 
face the telomeres and occur as doublets (Fig. 3b), and we found some 
evidence that they are co-evolving (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Proteins 
encoded by fam-l and fam-m genes may therefore form  
heterodimers, 
a feature not previously seen among subtelomeric gene families in 
other Plasmodium species. Finally, 3D structures of fam-l and fam-
m proteins, predicted with high confidence (template modelling 
 
(TM)-score > 
 0.5)13, overlap the crystal structure of the P. falciparum 
RH5 protein (TM-score > 
 0.8)14, with 100% of the RH5 structure 
 
covered despite having only 10% sequence similarity (Fig. 3c). RH5 is 
the only known P. falciparum protein that is essential for erythrocyte 
invasion, through binding to basigin on the erythrocyte surface15. The 
RH5 kite-shaped fold is known to be present in RBP2a in P. vivax16, and 
may be a conserved structure necessary for the binding capabilities of 
all Rh and RBP genes. This suggests that fam-l and fam-m genes also 
have an adhesion role, possibly binding host receptors.
The present study highlights features of host-specific adaptations 
at several levels: ape to human, primate to rodent and within human 
hosts. As noted in previous comparative genomics studies involving 
host switches in the Plasmodium genus, invasion-related genes are 
consistently found to be rapidly evolving. The RBP family is highly 
expanded (Extended Data Fig. 4a) but its differential distribution across 
species suggests that RBP3 may be essential for invasion of normo-
cytes (Extended Data Fig. 4c). In contrast to other studies1,7,11, we place 
the rodent malaria parasites as an outgroup to P. ovale but rooted by 
 
P. malariae. The rodent malaria parasites could therefore more closely 
model the biology of P. ovale than other human-infective species; this 
indicates that there must have been an ancestral host switch from 
primates to rodents. The relative dating of speciation events suggests 
that the move between non-human primates and humans occurred at 
approximately the same time in two well-separated lineages, suggesting 
that a common historical event may have promoted host switching 
and speciation in Plasmodium at the time. The much older speciation 
 
of the two P. ovale parasites and the fact that they have been considered 
identical until recently shows the limitation of morphology alone in 
species determination.
Owing to the importance of rapidly evolving multigene families and 
genome structure, high quality genomes for all human infective  
species 
of Plasmodium are desperately needed. Although P. malariae and 
 
P. ovale are known to be widespread and common in co-infections 
with P. falciparum (Fig. 1), their low parasitaemia levels have compli-
cated their study and consequently little is known about them. The 
 
present study provides a high-quality reference genome for P. malariae, 
thereby providing a step forward in better understanding this elusive 
species.

Data reporting. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. 
The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to 
allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
Co-infection mining. We aligned the P. malariae (AB354570) and P. ovale 
(AB354571) mitochondrial genome sequences against those of P. falciparum18, 
 
P. vivax19, and P. knowlesi20 using MUSCLE21. For each species, we identified three 
15-bp stretches within the Cox1 gene that contained two or more species-specific 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We searched for these 15-bp species- 
specific barcodes within the sequencing reads of all 2,512 samples from the 
Pf3K global collection that mapped to the P. falciparum mitochondrial genome 
 
(http://www.malariagen.net). Samples that contained at least two sequencing 
reads  
matching one or more of the 15 bp barcodes for a specific species were 
 
considered to be positive for that species (Extended Data Table 2). We found 
good  
correspondence between the three different barcodes for each species, with 
over 80% of positive samples being positive for all three barcodes. We generated 
pseudo-barcodes by changing two randomly selected nucleotide bases at a time 
for 10 randomly selected 15 bp region in the P. vivax19 mitochondrial genome. 
We did not detect any positive hits using these pseudo-barcodes. As an additional 
negative control, we searched for P. knowlesi co-infections, but did not find any 
samples positive for this  
species as expected from the limited geographical range of 
this species. Two samples (PocGH01, PocGH02) had high numbers of sequencing 
reads for all three P. ovale barcodes and were used for reference genome assembly 
and SNP calling respectively.
Parasite material. All P. ovale samples were obtained from symptomatic patients 
diagnosed with a P. falciparum infection. The two P. o. curtisi samples (PocGH01, 
PocGH02) identified through co-infection mining (see above), were from two 
patients that tested positive on a CareStart (HRP2-based) rapid malaria  
diagnostic 
test kit at the Navrongo War Memorial hospital, Ghana. One P. o. wallikeri  
sample 
(PowCR01) and one P. o. curtisi sample (PocCR01) were from patients with uncom-
plicated malaria that tested positive by light microscopy at the Mile 16 Bolifamba 
Health Centre, Buea, Cameroon. The other P. o. wallikeri sample (PowCR02) was 
obtained from an individual with asymptomatic parasitaemia enrolled through a 
community survey in Mutengene, Cameroon. For all samples, following consent 
obtainment, about 2–5 ml of venous blood was obtained and then diluted with 
one volume of PBS. This was passed through CF11 cellulose powder columns to 
remove  
leukocytes before parasite DNA extraction. Ethical approval was obtained 
for all P. ovale samples used in this study.
The two P. malariae-like samples, PmlGA01 and PmlGA02, were extracted from 
Chimpanzee blood (Pan troglodytes troglodytes, 9-year-old female and 11-year-old 
female, respectively) obtained during routine sanitary controls of animals living in 
a Gabonese sanctuary (Park of La Lékédi, Gabon). Blood collection was performed 
following international rules for animal health. Within six hours after collection, 
host white blood cell depletion was performed on fresh blood samples using the 
CF11 method22. After DNA extraction using the Qiagen blood and Tissue Kit and 
detection of P. malariae infections by Cytb PCR and sequencing23, the samples went 
through a whole-genome amplification step24.
One P. malariae sample, PmMA01, was collected from a patient with uncompli-
cated malaria in Faladje, Mali. Venous blood (2–5 ml) was depleted of leukocytes 
within 6 h of collection through CF11 cellulose powder columns as previously 
described25. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Faculty 
of Medicine and Odontomatology and Faculty of Pharmacy, Bamako, Mali.
Four samples of P. malariae were obtained from travellers returning to Australia 
with malaria. PmUG01 and PmID01 were sourced from patients returning from 
Uganda and Papua Indonesia, respectively, who presented at the Royal Darwin 
Hospital, Darwin, with microscopy-positive P. malariae infection. PmMY01 
was sourced from a patient presenting at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Sabah, 
Malaysia, with microscopy-positive P. malariae infection. Patient sample PmGN01 
was collected from a patient who presented to Royal Brisbane and Women’s 
Hospital in 2013 on return from Guinea. Venous blood samples were subject 
to leukodepletion within 6 h of collection. PmUG01 was leukodepleted using a 
commercial Plasmodipur filter (EuroProxima, The Netherlands); custom-made 
cellulose-based filters were used for PmID01 and PmMY01, whereas PmGN01 
was leukodepleted using an inline leukodepletion filter present in the venesection 
pack (Pall Leukotrap; WBT436CEA). DNA extraction was performed on filtered 
blood using commercial kits (QIAamp DNA Blood Midi kit, Qiagen). For  
samples 
PmUG01, PmID01 and PmMY01, ethical approval for the sample collection was 
obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of NT Department of 
Health and Families and Menzies School of Health Research (HREC-2010-1396 
and HREC-2010-1431) and the Medical Research Ethics Committee, Ministry of 
Health Malaysia (NMRR-10-754-6684). For sample PmGN02, ethical approval was 
obtained from the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital Human Research Ethics 
Committee (HREC/10/QRBW/379) and the Human Research Ethics Committee 
of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (p1478).
Sample preparation and sequencing. One P. malariae sample, PmUG01, was 
selected for long-read sequencing, using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), owing to 
its low host contamination and abundant DNA. Passing through a 25-mm blunt-
ended needle, 6 μ 
g of DNA was sheared to 20–25 kb. SMRT bell template  
libraries 
were generated using the PacBio issued protocol (20 kb Template Preparation 
using the BluePippin Size-Selection System). After a greater than 7 kb size- 
selection using the BluePippin Size-Selection System (Sage Science), the library 
was sequenced using P6 polymerase and chemistry version 4 (P6/C4) in 20 SMRT 
cells (Supplementary Information).
The remaining isolates were sequenced with Illumina Standard libraries of 
200–300 bp fragments and amplification-free libraries of 400–600 bp fragments 
were prepared26 and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 v3 or v4 and the 
MiSeq v2 according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol (Supplementary 
Information). Raw sequence data was deposited in the European Nucleotide 
Archive (Supplementary Information).
Genome assembly. The PacBio-sequenced P. malariae sample, PmUG01, was 
assembled using HGAP27 with an estimated genome size of 100 Mb to account 
for the host contamination (~ 
85% human). The resulting assembly was 
 
corrected initially using Quiver27, followed by iCORN28. PmUG01 consisted of 
multiple  
haplotypes, with the majority haplotype being used for the iCORN28, 
and a  
coverage analysis was performed to remove duplicate contigs. Additional 
 
duplicated contigs were identified using a BLASTN29 search, with the shorter 
contigs being removed if they were fully contained within the longer contigs or 
merged with the longer contig if their contig ends overlapped. Host contamina-
tion was removed by manually filtering on GC, coverage, and BLASTN hits to the 
non-redundant nucleotide database29.
The Illumina-based genome assemblies for P. o. curtisi, P. o. wallikeri, and 
P. malariae-like were performed using MaSURCA30 for samples PocGH01, 
PowCR01, and PmlGA01 respectively. To confirm that the assemblies were indeed 
P. ovale, we mapped existing P. ovale capillary reads to the assemblies (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?view= 
search, using as search terms: CENTER_
PROJECT = 
 “PO” and CENTER_NAME = 
 “SC”). Before applying MaSURCA30, 
the samples were mapped to the P. falciparum 3D7 reference genome18 to remove 
contaminating reads. The draft assemblies were further improved by iterative uses 
of SSPACE31, GapFiller32 and IMAGE33. The resulting scaffolds were ordered 
using ABACAS34 against the P. vivax PVP01 (ref. 35) (http://www.genedb.org/
Homepage/PvivaxP01) assembly (both P. ovale) or against the P. malariae PacBio 
assembly (P. malariae-like). The assemblies were manually filtered on GC, 
 
coverage, and BLASTN hits to the non-redundant nucleotide database29. iCORN28 
was used to correct frameshifts. Finally, contigs shorter than 1 kb were removed.
Using two more samples, PocGH02 and PowCR02, additional draft assemblies 
of both P. ovale species were produced using MaSURCA30 followed by RATT36 to 
transfer the gene models from the high-quality assemblies.
The genome sequences and annotations are currently available on GeneDB 
for P. malariae (http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Pmalariae) and for P. ovale 
curtisi (http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Povale). The genome sequences have 
been deposited into the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). 
 
Accession numbers for all reads generated for this study can be found in 
Supplementary Information. Accession identifiers for the assembled genome 
sequences can be found in Supplementary Information.
Gene annotation. RATT36 was used to transfer gene models on the basis of synteny 
conserved with other sequenced Plasmodium species (P. falciparum18, P. vivax19, 
 
P. berghei37, and P. gallinaceum (http://www.genedb.org/Homepage/Pgallinaceum). 
In addition, genes were predicted ab initio using AUGUSTUS38, trained on a set 
consisting of manually curated P. malariae and P. ovale genes respectively. Non-
coding RNAs and tRNAs were identified using Rfam 12.0 (ref. 39). Gene models 
were then manually curated for both the P. malariae and P. o. curtisi reference 
genomes, using Artemis40 and the Artemis Comparison Tool41. These tools were 
also used to manually identify deleted and disrupted genes (Extended Data Table 
5). The P. malariae-like and P. o. wallikeri genomes were both annotated using the 
Companion tool42.
Phylogenetics. Following orthologue assignment using BLASTP29 and 
OrthoMCL43, amino acid sequences of 1,000 core genes from 12 Plasmodium 
 
species (P. gallinaceum44, P. falciparum18, P. reichenowi10, P. knowlesi20, P. vivax 
P01 (ref. 35), P. cynomolgi45, P. chabaudi37, P. berghei37, and the four assemblies 
produced in this study) were aligned using MUSCLE21. The alignments were 
cleaned using GBlocks46 with default parameters to remove non-informative and 
gapped sites. The cleaned non-zero length alignments were then  
concatenated. 
This resulted in an alignment of 421,988 amino acid sites per species. The  
optimal 
substitution model for each gene partition was determined by running RAxML47

for each gene separately using all implemented substitution models. The sub-
stitution models with the minimum Akaike Information Criterion on a guide 
maximum parsimony tree were used for each gene partition. A maximum likeli-
hood phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAxML47 version 8.2.4. with 100 
bootstraps48 (Fig. 2). To confirm this tree, we used different phylogenetic tools 
including PhyloBayes49 and PhyML50, a number of different substitution models 
within RAxML, starting the tree search from the commonly accepted phylogenetic 
tree, and removing sites in the alignment which supported significantly different 
trees (Supplementary Information). Figtree was used to display and colour the tree 
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
A phylogenetic tree of four P. malariae (PmID01, PmGN01, PmGN02, 
PmMY01) and all P. malariae-like samples (PmlGA01, PmlGA02) was generated 
using PhyML50 on the basis of all P. malariae genes. For each sample, the raw 
SNPs, as called using the SNP calling pipeline (see below), were mapped onto all 
genes to morph them into sample-specific gene copies using BCFtools51. Amino 
acid alignments for all genes were concatenated and cleaned using GBlocks46 with 
default parameters.
Divergence dating. Species divergence times were estimated using the Bayesian 
inference tool G-PhoCS52, a software which uses unlinked neutrally evolving loci 
and a given phylogeny to estimate demographic parameters. One additional sample 
per assembly (PmGN01 for P. malariae, PocGH02 for P. o. curtisi, PowCR02 for 
 
P. o. wallikeri, and PmlGA02 for P. malariae-like) was used to morph the 
 
respective assembly using iCORN28. Regions in the genomes without mapping 
were masked, as iCORN28 would not have morphed them. Unassigned contigs 
and subtelomeric regions were removed for this analysis owing to the difficulty 
of  
alignment. Repetitive regions in the chromosomes of the four assemblies 
and the four  
morphed samples were masked using Dustmasker53 and then the 
 
chromosomes were aligned using FSA54. The P. o. wallikeri and the P. o.  
curtisi 
chromosomes were aligned against each other, as were the P. malariae and 
 
P.  
malariae-like  
chromosomes. The alignments were split into 1 kb loci, removing 
those that  
contained gaps, masked regions, and coding regions to conform with 
the neutral loci prediction of G-PhoCS52. G-PhoCS52 was run for one million 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-iterations with a sample-skip of 1,000 and a 
burn-in of 10,000 for each of the two-species pairs. Follow-up analyses using Tracer 
 
(http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer) confirmed that this was sufficient for  
convergence 
of the MCMC chain in all cases. In the model, we assumed a  
variable  
mutation 
rate across loci and allowed for on-going gene flow between the  
populations. The 
tau values obtained from this were 0.0049 for P. malariae and 0.0434 for P. ovale.
The tau values were used to calculate the date of the split, using the formula 
(tau × G) / m, where G is the generation time in years and m is the mutation rate. 
Testing a number of different generation time and mutation rate estimates in 
order to optimize the P. falciparum and P. reichenowi split to 4 million years ago as 
 
estimated previously17, we found a mutation rate of 3.8 × 10−10 SNPs per site per 
lifecycle55 and a generation time of 65 days56 to generate this previously published 
date17. For P. malariae, a generation time of 100 days was used owing to the longer 
intra-erythrocytic cycle.
3D structure prediction. The I-TASSER57 version 4.4 online web server58  
(http://www.zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER) was used for 3D  
protein 
structure prediction. Predicted structures with a TM-score of over 0.5 were 
 
considered reliable as suggested in the I-TASSER user guidelines13. TM-align14, 
as implemented in I-TASSER58, was used to overlay the predicted protein structure 
with existing published protein structures.
Hypnozoite gene search. Using the OrthoMCL43 clustering between all sequenced 
Plasmodium species used for the phylogenetic analysis (see above), we examined 
clusters containing only genes of hypnozoite-forming species: P. vivax P01 genes, 
P. cynomolgi45 genes and genes of both of the P. ovale species.
Additionally, we examined P. o. curtisi orthologues of previously published 
 
hypnozoite gene candidates45, looking in the 1 kb 5′ 
 upstream region for any of the 
four ApiAP2 motifs59 involved in sporozoite regulation and expression: GCATGC 
(PF3D7_1466400), GCCCCG (PF3D7_1342900), TAAGCC (PF3D7_1342900), 
and TGTTAC (PF3D7_0420300) (Supplementary Information).
Gene family analysis. All P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax P01 genes were 
 
compared pairwise using BLASTP29, with genes having a minimum local BLAST 
hit of 50% identity over 150 amino acids or more being considered connected. 
These gene connections were visualized in Gephi60 using a Fruchterman-
Reingold61 layout and with unconnected genes removed.
P. malariae, P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri protein sequences for Plasmodium 
interspersed repeat (pir) genes, excluding pseudogenes, were combined with those 
from P. vivax P01 (ref. 35), P. knowlesi20, P. chabaudi AS v3 (http://www.genedb.org/
Homepage/Pchabaudi), P. yoelii yoelii 17X v2 (ref. 37), and P. berghei v3 (ref. 62). 
Sequences were clustered using tribeMCL63 with blast e-value 0.01 and inflation 2. 
 
This resulted in 152 subfamilies. We then excluded clusters with one member. 
 
The number of genes per species in each subfamily were plotted in a heatmap using 
the heatmap.2 function in ggplots in R-3.1.2.
The pir genes from two P. o. curtisi and two P. o. wallikeri assemblies (two 
high-quality and two draft genome assemblies) were compared pairwise using 
BLASTP29 with a 99% identity over a minimum of 150 amino acids cutoff. 
The gene–gene connections were visualized in Gephi60 using a Fruchterman–
Reingold61 layout after removing unconnected genes.
Mirror tree analysis. Using Artemis40, 79 fam-m and fam-l doublets that were 
 
confidently predicted as being paired-up were manually selected on the basis 
of their dispersal throughout the subtelomeres of different chromosomes. The 
Mirrortree64 web server (http://csbg.cnb.csic.es/mtserver/) was used to  
construct 
mirror trees for these 79 doublets. 35 doublets with recent branching from 
another doublet were manually selected to enrich for genes under recent selection 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c). To control for chance signals of co-evolution on the basis 
of their subtelomeric location, the same methodology was repeated by choosing 79 
pir genes in close proximity of fam-m genes as ‘pseudo-doublets’ for analysis and 
paired up in the Mirrortree64 web server (Extended Data Fig. 5d).
Reticulocyte-binding protein (RBP) phylogenetic plot. Full-length RBP 
genes were manually inspected using ACT41 and verified to either be functional 
or  
pseudogenized by identification of sequencing reads in other samples that 
 
confirm mutations inducing premature stop codons or frameshifts. All functional 
RBPs were aligned using MUSCLE21 and cleaned using GBlocks46 with default 
 
parameters. PhyML50 was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of the different 
RBPs (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Figtree was used to colour the tree (http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
SNP calling. Additional P. malariae (PmMY01, PmID01, PmMA01, PmGN01) and 
P. o. curtisi (PocGH01, PocGH02, PocCR01) samples were mapped back against 
the reference genomes using SMALT (-y 0.8, -i 300) (Supplementary Information). 
 
As outgroups, P. malariae-like (PmlGA01, PmlGA02) and P. o. wallikeri (PowCR01, 
PowCR02) were also mapped against the P. malariae and P. o. curtisi genomes 
respectively. The resulting ‘bam’ formatted files were merged for either of the two 
genomes, and GATK65 Unified Genotyper was used to call SNPs from the merged 
bam files (Supplementary Information). As per GATK65 best practices, SNPs 
were filtered by quality of depth (QD > 2), depth of coverage (DP > 10), mapping 
 
quality (MQ > 
 20), and strand bias (FS < 
 60). Additionally, all sites for which we 
had  
missing data for any of the samples or for which we had heterozygous calls were 
filtered. Finally, we filtered sites that were masked using Dustmasker53 to remove 
repetitive and difficult to map regions. The same methodology was also applied 
to two P. vivax samples (SRR3400910 and SRR332566) and two P. falciparum Pf3K 
field samples (PF0066-C and PF0038-C, see https://www.malariagen.net/projects/
pf3k) for comparative purposes.
Molecular evolution analysis. To calculate the nucleotide diversity for the  
different 
species, we extracted all filtered SNPs in the genomes excluding the subtelomeres. 
We then counted the number of pairwise differences between the different  
samples 
divided by the resulting genome size, comprising three comparisons for species 
with three samples (P. malariae, P. o. curtisi, P. vivax, P. falciparum) and one 
 
comparison for species with two samples (P. o. wallikeri, P. malariae-like). These 
estimates were then averaged by species (Table 1).
The filtered SNPs were used to morph the reference genomes using BCFtools51 
for each sample, from which sample-specific gene models were obtained. 
Nucleotide alignments of each gene were then generated. Codons with alignment 
positions that were masked using Dustmasker53 were excluded. For each alignment 
(that is, gene), we calculated Hudson–Kreitman–Aguadé (HKA)66, McDonald–
Kreitman (MK)67, and Ka/Ks68 values (see below). Subtelomeric gene families 
and pseudogenes were excluded from the analysis. The results were analysed and 
 
plotted in RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/).
For the HKA66, we counted the proportion of pairwise nucleotide differences 
intra-specifically (that is, within P. malariae and within P. o. curtisi) and inter- 
specifically (that is, between P. malariae and P. malariae-like, between P. o. curtisi 
and P. o. wallikeri). The intraspecific comparisons were averaged to obtain the 
nucleotide diversity π 
 of the genes and these were divided by the average inter-
specific comparisons, the nucleotide divergence, to get the HKA ratio (HKAr) 
for each gene.
The MK test67 was performed for each gene by obtaining the number of fixed 
and polymorphic changes, as well as a P value, as previously described69 and then 
calculating the skew as log2(((Npoly + 
 1) / (Spoly + 
 1)) / ((Nfix + 
 1) / (Sfix + 
 1))), 
where Npoly and Nfix are polymorphic and fixed non-synonymous substitutions 
 
respectively, and Spoly and Sfix refer to the synonymous substitutions.
To calculate the average Ka/Ks ratio68, we took the cleaned alignments of the MK 
test, extracting the pairwise sequences of P. malariae and P. malariae-like (and of 
P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). The ‘Bio::Align::DNAStatistics’ module was used to 
calculate the Ka/Ks values for each pair70, averaging across samples within a species.

Using existing RNA sequencing data from seven different life-cycle stages in 
 
P. falciparum71, reads were mapped against spliced gene sequences (exons, but not 
UTRs) from the P. falciparum 3D7 reference genome18 using Bowtie2 (ref. 72) v2.1.0 
 
(-a -X 800 –x). Read counts per transcript were estimated using eXpress v1.3.0 
 
(ref. 73). Genes with an effective length cutoff below 10 in any sample were 
removed. Summing over transcripts generated read counts per gene. Numbers 
were averaged for all gametocyte stages and for all blood stages. Genes with no 
stage having 10 or more reads were classified as being expressed elsewhere. Genes 
in P. malariae and P. ovale were classified by the maximum expression stage of their 
P. falciparum orthologue if the difference between the maximum expression stage 
and the second highest stage was larger than the difference between the second and 
third highest stage, otherwise the gene was classified as having no peak expression.
The Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis was performed in R, using 
TopGO74. As a Gene Ontology database, the predicted Gene Ontology terms from 
the P. falciparum 3D7 genes orthologous to the P. malariae and P. o. curtisi genes 
included in the analysis were used. Collated tables for all molecular evolution 
 
measures for all genes can be found in Source Data File 1 for P. malariae and 
 
P. o. curtisi.
RBP1a receptor search. To find the putative RBP1a receptor, we performed an 
OrthoMCL43 clustering between human, chimpanzee75, and common marmoset76 
genes. P. brasilianum (P. malariae) results in chronic infection in the common 
 
marmoset77. Genes without transmembrane domains as well as those annotated as 
‘predicted’ were removed. To limit false positives, all remaining genes were searched 
against the chimpanzee genes using BLASTP29 with a threshold of 1 × 10−10.

Extended Data Figure 1 | Large genomic changes in the P. malariae and 
P. ovale genome sequences. a, Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)41 view 
showing reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 6 and 10 in P. malariae. 
The red lines indicate blast similarities, chromosome 6 in orange and 
chromosome 10 in brown. b, ACT41 view showing a pericentric inversion 
in chromosome 5 of P. malariae. Red lines indicate BLAST similarities  
and blue lines indicate inverted BLAST hits. c, Expansion of 22 copies  
(20 functional) of Pfg27 in P. malariae (top) compared to a single copy  
in P. falciparum (bottom) with red lines indicating BLAST similarities. 
Functional genes are in red and pseudogenes in grey. This compares to 
only 17 Pfg27 copies described previously7, which were found on six 
separate contigs, while all Pfg27 copies described here are found on  
the same contig. d, Expansion of PVP01_1270800 (PF3D7_1475900  
in P. falciparum), a gene with no known function, in P. o. curtisi and  
P. o. wallikeri, with different copy numbers in each, compared to the one 
copy in P. vivax. Functional genes shown in orange and pseudogenes 
shown in grey. This gene family was recently named KELT7, and we 
confirm the 8 copies present in P. o. wallikeri, but show that P. o. curtisi  
has 9 copies, two of which are pseudogenes.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Different population genetics in P. malariae 
and P. o. curtisi. a, HKA ratio and MK Skew for both P. malariae versus 
P. malariae-like (left) and P. o. curtisi versus P. o. wallikeri (right). Genes 
with high HKAr values (> 
0.15, vertical line) are coloured by the peak 
expression of their orthologue in P. falciparum71 (red, blood stage; green, 
gametocyte; blue, ookinete; yellow, other; grey, no peak expression) 
(Methods). Genes with high HKAr and a significant MK skew (square 
symbols): (1) merozoite surface protein 9, PF3D7_1228600; (2) rRNA 
(adenosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase, PF3D7_1429400; (3) merozoite 
surface protein 1, PF3D7_0930300; (4) formin 1, PF3D7_0530900.  
b, Gene-wide HKAr values for the P. falciparum to P. reichenowi 
comparison, described earlier10, versus HKAr for the P. o. curtisi to P. o. 
wallikeri (blue) and the P. malariae to P. malariae-like (red) comparisons. 
Five genes show significant HKAr (> 0.15) values for both comparisons: 
(1) ferrodoxin reductase-like protein (PF3D7_0720400); (2) EGF-like 
membrane protein (PF3D7_0623300); (3) ADP/ATP carrier protein 
(PF3D7_1004800); (4) merozoite surface protein 1 (PF3D7_0930300); (5) 
conserved Plasmodium protein (PF3D7_0311000). c, log2 of P values of 
gene-wide MK tests for the P. falciparum to P. reichenowi comparison10 
by P. o. curtisi to P. o. wallikeri (blue) and P. malariae to P. malariae-like 
(red) comparisons. Three genes have significant MK skews (log2(P) 
< −3) for both comparisons: (1) glideosome-associated connectyor 
(PF3D7_1361800); (2) apical membrane antigen 1 (PF3D7_1133400); 
(3) NAD(P)H-dependent glutamate synthase (PF3D7_1435300). 
d, Nonsynonymous versus synonymous fixed mutations per gene for both 
the P. o. curtisi to P. o. wallikeri (blue) and the P. malariae to P. malariae-
like (red) comparisons. Whereas the former has most genes centred 
around the x = y line, the latter has most genes below this line with more 
nonsynonymous than synonymous mutations, indicative of an ancestral 
bottleneck. e, Bar plot of proportion of P. malariae (above) and P. o. curtisi 
(below) genes expressed at different stages (no peak expression (grey), 
ookinete (blue), gametocyte (green), intraerythrocytic (red), and other 
stage (yellow)) binned by Ka/Ks, with the number of genes in each bin 
displayed (n). P. o. curtisi genes with very high Ka/Ks values (> 
2.5) are

(P. vivax, P. o. curtisi, P. o. wallikeri, P. cynomolgi, P. malariae, P. knowlesi) 
grouped by erythrocyte invasion preference (reticulocyte versus 
normocyte). d, PhyML50 generated phylogenetic tree of all RBP genes 
over 1 kb long in P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri. Pseudogenes are denoted

Extended Data Figure 5 | Subtelomeric gene family dynamics in  
P. ovale and P. malariae. a, Heat map showing the sharing of pir 
subfamilies between different species based on tribeMCL63. Columns 
show pir subfamilies and rows show species. Colours indicate the number 
of genes classified into each subfamily for each species. Subfamilies were 
ordered by size, species were ordered for clarity. pir genes in rodent-
infective species fall into a small number of well-defined families.  
Those in P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale, however, are much more 
diverse. There is little overlap between rodent subfamilies and human-
infective subfamilies, despite P. ovale being a sister taxa to the rodent-
infecting species. P. knowlesi has some sharing with other species, but 
its largest families are species specific, suggesting it has undergone 
specialization of its pir repertoire. b, Gene network of pir genes for both 
high-quality assemblies of P. o. curtisi (dark red) and P. o. wallikeri  
(dark blue) and draft assemblies of each (light red and light blue 
respectively). pir genes with BLASTP29 identity hits of 99% and over 150 
amino acids become connected in the graph. Genes without connections 
were removed. There is one connection between the two species (circled 
in black and with a zoomed in version), 801 between the P. o. curtisi 
assemblies, 524 between the P. o. wallikeri assemblies, 527 on average 
within each P. o. curtisi assembly, and 423 on average within each  
P. o. wallikeri assembly. This indicates that there is considerably less 
sharing of pir genes between the two P. ovale species than within each 
species, as expected if the two do not recombine with each other. c, Mirror 
tree64 for 79 fam-m and fam-l doublets, where the two phylogenetic trees 
correspond to either of the families with lines connecting branch tips 
of the same doublet. 35 branches (red) were manually selected owing 
to exhibiting recent branching. Inset below shows the correlations as 
calculated by the Mirrortree webserver64 between the two trees for all 
branches (above, correlation = 0.19, P < 0.001) and red branches (below, 
correlation = 0.53, P < 0.001). This shows that the two families are  
co-evolving, especially when doublets that recently branched are selected, 
suggesting that the co-evolution may be disrupted over longer periods 
of time, potentially through recombination. d, Mirror tree64 for 79 pir 
and fam-m pseudo-doublets (Methods), where the two phylogenetic 
trees correspond to either of the families with lines connecting branch 
tips of the same doublet. We manually selected 35 branches (red) as they 
exhibited recent branching. Inset shows the correlations as calculated by 
the Mirrortree webserver64 between the two trees for all branches  
(above, correlation = − 
0.09, P > 0.05) and red branches (below, 
correlation = − 
0.10, P > 0.05). This shows that the two families are  
not co-evolving, and that subtelomeric location does not produce  
sporadic signals of co-evolution.
