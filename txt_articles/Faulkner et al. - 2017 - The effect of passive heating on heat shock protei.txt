ABSTRACT
Increasing physical activity remains the most widely publicized way of improving health and
wellbeing. However, in populations that benefit most from exercise (EX), adherence is often poor
and alternatives to EX are important to bring about health improvements. Recent work suggests a
role for passive heating (PH) and heat shock proteins (HSP) in improving cardio-metabolic health.
The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of HSP70 and interleukin-6 in response to
either EX or PH and the subsequent effect on glucose control. Fourteen males volunteered and
were categorized lean (BMI 23.5 § 2.2 kg¢m¡2) or overweight (29.2 § 2.7 kg¢m¡2) and completed
60 minutes of either moderate cycling at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (EX) or warm
water immersion in 40�C water (PH). Extracellular HSP70 increased from baseline in both conditions
with no differences between PH (0.98 § 1.1 ng¢mL¡1) or EX (0.84 § 1.0 ng¢mL¡1, p D 0.814). IL-6
increased following both conditions with a two-fold increase after PH and four-fold after EX. Energy
expenditure increased by 61.0 § 14.4 kcal¢h¡1 (79%) after PH. Peak glucose concentration after a
meal immediately following PH was reduced when compared with EX (6.3 § 1.4 mmol¢L¡1 versus
6.8 § 1.2 mmol¢L¡1; p < 0.05). There was no difference in 24-hour glucose area under the curve
(AUC) between conditions. These data indicate the potential for thermal therapy as an alternative
treatment and management strategy for those at risk of developing metabolic disease where
adherence, or ability to EX, may be compromised.

Introduction
Overweight and obesity are characterized by chronic
inflammation and impairments to insulin sensitivity
and glucose control. A multitude of factors contribute
to enhancing health and wellbeing; increasing physical
activity remains the most widely publicized way of
doing so. However, in populations that benefit most
from exercise (EX), adherence is often poor, most
likely due to medical conditions and disability,1 poor
motivation and a lack of convenience.2,3 There are
many factors involved in the development and treat-
ment of insulin resistance, with the roles played by
both thermal therapy and heat shock proteins (HSPs)
receiving increased attention.4-7 Furthermore, it has
been suggested that HSPs may provide an early indi-
cator of the onset of metabolic diseases, such as type 2
diabetes (T2DM),8,9 while also acting as a possible bio-
marker for the chronicity of diabetes.10
HSPs are synthesized in response to a number of
physiological stressors,11–13 and are individually char-
acterized by their molecular weight. The most widely
studied HSP in humans is the 70 kDa family of HSPs
which includes both the constitutive HSP73 and
inducible HSP72 forms. HSPs have wide-ranging
functions including their roles as thermo-protectants
and involvement in protein synthesis.14 The resting
level of extracellular HSP70 (eHSP70) appears to be
related to adiposity and inflammation with elevations
reported in obesity and T2DM, whereas resting intra-
cellular HSP70 (iHSP70) is decreased in T2DM.9 A
reduction in iHSP70 is an important component in
the vicious cycle of chronic inflammation and reduced
insulin signalling15,16 and the development of insulin
resistance.17,18 Indeed, a reduction in iHSP70 has been
reported in T2DM and correlates to insulin resistance
and glucose disposal rates.19,20

 eHSP70 is increased following acute EX13 with the
magnitude of change dependent on both the duration
and intensity.21,22 A core temperature (Tc) threshold
for elevations in eHSP70 has been suggested, with a
0.8–1.5�C increase in Tc being required in order to
elevate eHSP70.23,24 Recently, thermal therapy has
been demonstrated to stimulate HSP70 production,
although to a lesser extent than following EX,4,24 and
may offer an alternative way by which the positive
effects of HSP may be induced.9
The influence of thermal therapy on glycemic regu-
lation and metabolic disease has primarily been inves-
tigated using rodent models.17,18,25–27. However, there
are human data to suggest that local heating at the site
of insulin infusion improves postprandial insulin
action28,29 and may benefit long-term glycemic con-
trol29,30 and cardiovascular health in humans.31 How-
ever, the mechanisms by which such an effect may
occur in humans remain to be elucidated. Chung et al.
were the first to demonstrate that passive heating
(PH) of mice resulted in an elevation in iHSP70 which
was protective against the deleterious effects of con-
suming a high-fat diet.18 They report that in response
to a high-fat diet there was an increase in the phos-
phorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Such
an increase has been linked to impaired insulin sensi-
tivity due to JNK binding with the insulin receptor
substrate, thus preventing the initiation of the insulin
signaling cascade and resulting in an elevation in
plasma glucose (For review, the reader is directed to
ref.[32]). Importantly, Chung et al. demonstrated that
PH attenuated hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance
and insulin resistance and as a direct consequence of
elevations in HSP70 and was closely associated with
prevention of JNK phosphorylation. Therefore, there
is a need to investigate how well data from these
rodent models translate into human participants, with
a specific focus on the ability of thermal therapy to ele-
vate HSP70 and improve glycemic control.
HSPs may impact on the inflammatory state by
directly inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Regular
EX has been demonstrated to have a positive effect on
the inflammatory profile that is suggested to occur as
a consequence of the repeated exposure to an anti-
inflammatory environment following each EX bout.33
This may occur as a consequence of secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-
6) that may in turn up-regulate anti-inflammatory
cytokines.34 Importantly, it has been shown that
HSP70 independently induces pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines.35,36 Therefore, thermal therapy may be able to
replicate some of the anti-inflammatory benefits of
EX, which could help reduce the level of inflammation
evident in many types of chronic disease.
While EX has significant benefits to improving
health, individuals with many types of chronic disease
often experience low EX tolerance and poor rates of
adherence.1,37 Based on the above animal literature,
there is evidence to suggest that thermal therapy may
replicate some of the health benefits of EX and allevi-
ate some of the comorbidities often associated with
chronic diseases such as T2DM.38 If successful, the
implementation of thermal therapy may help to lessen
some of the financial burden of treating chronic by
potentially reducing the dependence on pharmacolog-
ical interventions. Thermal therapy could offer a sim-
ple home-based intervention that may appeal to
individuals unable or unwilling to participate in regu-
lar EX.
The primary aim of this study was to investigate
the expression of eHSP70 in response to either EX
or thermal therapy in the form of PH via warm
water immersion. A secondary aim was to investi-
gate the effect of body composition on the eHSP70
response. Finally, we wished to investigate the
potential effect of PH on glycemic control in
response
to
replicated
dietary
intake.
It
was
hypothesized that both EX and PH would elevate
eHSP70, with a larger magnitude of change follow-
ing EX. It was further hypothesized that there
would be a differential response in eHSP70 between
lean and overweight participant groups.
Methods
Participants
A total of 14 males volunteered to participate in the
study and were split into two groups: (i) Lean (LEAN,
n D 7; BMI < 25 kg¢m¡2, body fat < 15% and fat
mass < 12 kg) and (ii) Overweight (OW, n D 7; BMI
> 27.0 kg¢m¡2, body fat > 20% and fat mass >
25 kg). Participant characteristics are provided in
Table 1. All participants were healthy non-smokers
with no history of cardiovascular, hematological or
metabolic disorders and had been weight stable for �
3 months. Participants were habitually inactive; per-
forming less than 1.5 hours of structured physical
activity per week and had avoided any hot weather

 exposure in the previous two months, including fre-
quent sauna or spa use.
Ethical approval
Full ethical approval was granted by the Loughbor-
ough University Ethical Advisory Committee. All pro-
cedures conformed to the principles defined in the
Declaration
of
Helsinki.
Participants
were
fully
informed of the experimental protocols and any
potential risks were identified before they provided
their written consent to participate.
Experimental overview
Participants visited the laboratory on three occasions.
The preliminary visit to the laboratory consisted of
initial measures including a blood profile, body com-
position and both submaximal and maximal oxygen
uptake tests ( _
VO2 max test). Visits two and three com-
prised the experimental trials which consisted of either
60 minutes of PH via warm water immersion (PH), or
60 minutes of EX at a fixed rate of metabolic heat pro-
duction (EX) which were completed in a counterbal-
anced order and were matched for DTc. On arrival,
participants were asked to void their bladder and were
weighed in minimal clothing and then fully instru-
mented. The first blood sample was then collected and
muscle temperature measured. Participants then com-
pleted either PH or EX as detailed below. On comple-
tion of each trial, a second blood sample and muscle
temperature measure were obtained, with a final blood
sample
being
taken
2
hours
after
completion
(Figure 1). Experimental trials were separated by a
minimum of 5 days to reduce any acclimation effect39
and to minimize any effect of prior EX or heating
upon insulin sensitivity.40 All trials were completed at
the same time of day to minimize effects of circadian
variation.

 Preliminary visit
Participants arrived in a fasted state and a capillary
blood sample was drawn for assessment of total
cholesterol,
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-
C), glucose and triglycerides (TG) (Cardiochek,
Polymer Technology Systems, Indianapolis, IN).
Participants’ height and weight were recorded (Seca
360, Birmingham, UK), and BMI calculated. Body
composition was determined with skinfold callipers
(Harpenden, Warwickshire, UK) using the seven-
site formula.41 Participants then completed a sub-
maximal EX test on an electronically braked cycle
ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport, Groningen, Neth-
erlands) with an online gas analyzer (Metamax 3B,
Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Germany). The test com-
prised
four
stages,
increasing
by
20
W
every
4 minutes. _
VO2 and _
VCO2 were determined over a
30-second rolling average from the final minute of
each stage. On completion of the submaximal test,
participants were given a minimum of a 10-minute
recovery period prior to commencing the _
VO2 max
test. This test used a continual ramp protocol at a
rate of 20 W¢min¡1 until the participant reached
volitional exhaustion. _
VO2 max was determined over a
30-second rolling average from the final minute of
the test.
Experimental trials
Seventy-two hours prior to the start of each experi-
mental trial, participants reported to the laboratory
where they were fitted with a continuous glucose
monitor device (CGM; Freestyle Libre, Abbott Lab-
oratories, Berkshire). The sensor was inserted on
the posterior aspect of the upper arm, with intersti-
tial glucose measured every 15 minutes. CGM data
were analyzed for 2-hours post meal glucose AUC
and peak glucose concentration.42 Participants were
provided
with
scales
(HoMedics
Group
Salter,
Kent) and detailed instruction on how to measure
dietary intake in order to accurately complete a 3-
day diet diary during the first trial, which com-
menced 24 hours before and ended 24 hours after
completion of trial 1. Participants were instructed
to consume the first meal after each condition fol-
lowing a standardized 3-hour time period. Partici-
pants were required to replicate their dietary intake
and timing of meals for the second trial.
Exercise trial
Participants performed 1-hour cycling at a fixed rate
of metabolic heat production ( _
Hprod) equivalent to
7 W/kg in an environmental chamber (25.6 § 0.7�C;
49.8 § 3.8% relative humidity, rh). The initial work-
load was determined from the submaximal test and
external workload was manipulated throughout the
60 minutes in order to maintain _
Hprod at 7 W/kg. Par-
ticipants completed the EX at a self-selected cadence.
_
V O2 and _
VCO2 were recorded throughout using an
online gas analyzer. Airflow was provided by three
fans stacked vertically, positioned 2.5 m in front of the
ergometer at an air speed of 1.5 m¢s¡1.
Passive heating trial
Participants were seated in a water bath (40.2 §
0.2 �C) and immersed up to the waist for 1 hour.
Water was circulated throughout to ensure main-
tenance of water temperature.
_
VO2 and
_
VCO2
were recorded throughout. Ambient conditions dur-
ing the trial were 23.9 § 0.9 �C; 49.9 § 4.4% rh.
Owing to the effect of temperature and duration on
HSP70 and IL-6 expression, we attempted to match
the change in core temperature between conditions by
eliciting a 1�C increase in core temperature. Further-
more, the duration of both EX and PH was matched
to limit the effect of intervention exposure time on
key outcome measures.
Instrumentation
Core temperature (TC) was measured using a rectal
thermistor
(Grant
Instruments
Ltd,
Cambridge)
inserted 10 cm beyond the anal sphincter. Wireless
skin sensors (iButtons, DS1922, California, USA) were
applied and secured by Medipore tape (3M, Berkshire,
UK). Mean skin temperature (Tsk/
was calculated
according to the formula of Ramanathan.43 Partici-
pants wore a heart rate monitor throughout (RS800,
Kempele, Polar, Finland).
Muscle temperature
Muscle temperature (Tm) was measured in the right
vastus
lateralis
using
a
solid
needle
probe
(MKA08050A275TS Ellab, Copenhagen, Denmark)
immediately pre- and post-trial. Following standard
sterile procedure, the needle probe was first inserted
to an initial depth of 3 cm beyond the muscle fascia
TEMPERATURE
295
 where the temperature was allowed to stabilize before
the probe was withdrawn to 2 cm and then 1cm
depths, with the temperature recorded at each depth.
Blood sampling
Venous blood samples were collected by venepuncture
from an antecubital vein in the right arm into a 10 mL
Vacutainer that had been pre-cooled and pre-treated
with K3EDTA (BD Biosciences, San Diego, USA).
Samples were obtained before and on completion of
each heating protocol with a final sample taken
120 minutes later (Figure 1). Samples were stored on
ice until they were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for
10 min at 4�C and the plasma stored at ¡80�C until
subsequent analysis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
Plasma HSP70 (ENZ-101, AMP’D� hs HSP70, Enzo
Life
Sciences,
Exeter,
UK)
and
IL-6
(HS600B,
Quantikine� HS IL-6, R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK)
concentrations were analyzed using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent sandwich assays (ELISAs) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma HSP70 and
IL-6 concentrations were determined in relation to a
four-parameter standard curve (version 6.0 GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All samples were ana-
lyzed in duplicate with a mean intra plate coefficient
of variation (CV) of 4.5% for HSP70 and 5.8% for IL-
6. The inter plate CV was 6.3% for HSP70 and 6.1%
for IL-6.
Calculations
Energy expenditure during PH and EX was calculated
via indirect calorimetry. Heat balance parameters
were estimated via partitional calorimetry and are pre-
sented as the mean value for each condition. All
parameters were calculated in W/m2 but presented as
W/kg where appropriate. The rate of metabolic energy
expenditure was estimated as

Mean body temperature (DTb) was estimated using
the three-compartment model as follows:
DTb D .0:63 D Tc/ C .0:24 DTsk/ C .0:13 D Tm/
(3)
where DTc represents the change in core temperature,
DTsk the change in mean skin temperature and DTm
the change in muscle temperature at a depth of 3cm.44
AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method.
Statistical analysis
The normality and distribution of data was assessed
using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Where data
failed to meet the criteria of normal distribution, the
data were log transformed. Mean participant charac-
teristics were compared using independent samples t-
tests. Tc, Tsk, Tm, HSP70, IL-6 were analyzed using
repeated measures ANOVA. Where significance was
obtained post hoc tests were completed using Sidak’s
test for multiple comparisons. _
Hprod, DTb and energy
expenditure were analyzed using one-way ANOVA
with Sidak’s test for multiple comparisons. Correla-
tional analysis was done using Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. Linear regression was used to analyze the
relative contributions of DTc, DTsk, DTm and DTb to
DHSP70 and DIL-6. The R2 value was employed to
determine the variance explained by each predictor
variable. Where reported, the adjusted R2 value is pro-
vided for multiple linear regression in order to
account for the number of predictor variables in the
model. All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism (version 6.0 GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA, USA). All data are presented as mean § SD
unless otherwise stated. p values � 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant. Effect sizes (ES) corrected
for bias using Hedge’s g were calculated as the ratio of
the mean difference to the pooled standard deviation
of the difference, with 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) for differences also presented. The magnitude of
the ES was classed as trivial (< 0.2), small (0.2–0.6),

Results
_
Hprod. There were differences in _
Hprod between PH
(1.9 § 0.2 W/kg) and EX (7.3 § 0.5 W/kg, p < 0.001).
_
Hprod was successfully matched between groups for
both PH (LEAN 2.0 § 0.2 W/kg, OW D 1.8 § 0.2 W/
kg, p D 0.433, CI D ¡0.03 to 0.43, ES D 0.9) and EX
(LEAN 7.3 § 0.4, OW 7.2 § 0.5 W/kg; p D 0.763,
CI D ¡0.63 to 0.43, ES D 0.21). However, when lean
body mass is accounted for, differences in _
Hprod were
evident (LEAN 8.4 § 0.4 W/kg/LBM¡1; OW 9.8 § 1.6
W/kg/LBM¡1, p < 0.05, CI D 0.04 to 2.76, ES D 1.1).
eHSP70. There was a main effect of time (p <
0.005) but not condition (p D 0.887) on the eHSP70
response (Figure 2A). The increase in eHSP70 follow-
ing PH and EX was 23% and 24%, respectively
(Figure 2B). Across conditions DeHSP70 correlated
with mean Tm (r D 0.485, p < 0.05). DeHSP70 was
negatively correlated to body mass (r D ¡0.400, p <
0.05). Of the thermal variables, DTm provided the best
predictor of DHSP70, with the DTm explaining 24.7%
of the total variance in DHSP70 (r D 0.498, p < 0.01).
Body mass also predicted DHSP70, explaining 16.4%
of the total variance (r D ¡0.405, p < 0.05). When
combined, DTm and body mass provided the strongest
predictor, accounting for 28% of the variance in
DHSP70 (Adjusted R2 D 0.280, r D 0.585, p < 0.01).
IL-6. There was a main effect of time (P < 0.001),
condition (P < 0.05) and an interaction effect (P <
0.01, Figure 2C) on IL-6 concentration. IL-6 was
higher immediately following EX (1.74 § 1.79
pg¢mL¡1) compared to PH (0.97 § 0.86 pg¢mL¡1, p <
0.0001, ES D 0.5) and equated to an increase of 346%
after EX and 118% following PH (Figure 2D) from
baseline values. IL-6 had returned to baseline at 2-
hours post for PH (0.58 § 0.47 pg¢mL¡1) and EX
(0.73 § 0.79 pg¢mL¡1). When considering differences
between LEAN and OW, there was a main effect of
time (p < 0.05) but not group (p D 0.533) on the IL-6
response. None of the thermal variables, nor body
mass, provided an effective model for predicting the
change in IL-6.
Energy expenditure
There were no differences in resting metabolic rate
between LEAN (1811.2 § 82.3 kcal¢day¡1) and OW

 (1873.9 § 140.7 kcal¢day¡1; p D 0.330, ES D 0.5).
There was an overall effect of condition on energy
expenditure during heating (p < 0.0001) and an inter-
action effect (p < 0.05). PH increased energy expendi-
ture by 61.0 § 14.4 kcal¢h¡1 compared to rest (p <
0.0001, ES D 4.8), which equates to a 79.5% increase.
EX resulted in an additional energy expenditure of
556.3 § 92.0 kcal¢h¡1 compared to rest (p < 0.0001,
ES D 7.1), equating to a 721% increase. EX energy
expenditure was greater for OW compared to LEAN
(11.3 § 1.9 kcal¢min¡1 versus 9.8 § 0.9 kcal¢min¡1,
respectively, p < 0.05, ES D 1.0), resulting in an addi-
tional caloric expenditure from rest of 597.7 §
107.9 kcal for OW (748%), and 515 § 52.1 kcal for
LEAN (681%). During PH, there was no difference in
the increase in energy expenditure between LEAN and
OW (2.3 § 0.3 kcal¢min¡1 versus 2.3 § 0.3 kcal¢min¡1,
respectively, p D 0.997, ES D 0.0). Caloric expenditure
increased from rest by 63.4 § 16.6 kcal (84%) and
58.5 § 12.7 kcal (74%) kcal for LEAN and OW,
respectively although there was no difference between
groups (p D 0.623, ES D 0.3).
Substrate oxidation
Total EX carbohydrate oxidation was higher for OW
(125.3 § 20.8 g) compared to LEAN (92.5 § 28.2 g;
p < 0.05, ES D 1.3). There was a moderate effect of
body mass on total carbohydrate oxidation in PH
between OW (7.5 § 4.2 g) and LEAN (13.2 § 8.3 g,
ES D 0.83) although this did not reach significance
(p D 0.13). There was no difference between OW and
LEAN in total fat oxidation during EX (p D 0.46).
There was a tendency for OW to display a greater total
fat oxidation than LEAN in PH, although this did not
reach statistical significance (10.6 § 1.54 g versus 9.0
§ 3.1 g; ES 0.7; p D 0.13).
Continuous glucose monitoring
Owing to instances of poor compliance to diet replica-
tion and sensor malfunction and drop out, CGM anal-
ysis was only completed on eight participants, with an
unequal split between LEAN (n D 3) and OW
(n D 5). Therefore, it was only possible to conduct
analysis on PH compared to EX. Peak glucose concen-
tration in response to the meal following PH (6.3 §
1.4 mmol¢L¡1) was lower compared to the same meal
after EX (6.8 § 1.2 mmol¢L¡1; p < 0.05, CI D ¡0.9 to
1.9, ES D 0.4, Figure 3A). There was no difference in
glucose AUC for PH compared to EX following this
meal (p D 0.875, CI D ¡11.2 to 12.4, ES D 0.1
Figure 3B). There were no differences in either peak
glucose (meal 2 p D 0.168, meal 3 p D 0.266) or AUC
(meal 2 p D 0.070, meal 3 p D 0.183) consumed in the
subsequent 24-hour period. There were also no differ-
ences in total 24-hour AUC between PH and EX
(p D 0.168)
Core temperature
There was a main effect of time (p < 0.0001) and an
interaction effect (P < 0.0001), but no main effect of
condition on DTc (p D 0.112, Figure 4a). PH DTc was
lower in OW compared to LEAN from 35 minutes
(p < 0.05), although by 60 minutes there was no dif-
ference in DTc (1.0 § 0.2�C versus 0.9 § 0.2�C, LEAN
versus OW, respectively p D 0.089, CI D ¡0.13 to
0.33, ES D 0.5). There were no differences in DTc
between OW and LEAN during EX at any time point,

 with DTc at 60 minutes being 0.8 § 0.1�C versus 0.8 §
0.2�C for LEAN and OW, respectively (p D 0.999).
Skin temperature
There were main effects of time (p < 0.0001), condi-
tion (p < 0.0001) and an interaction effect (p <
0.0001) on DTsk (Figure 4B). There were no differen-
ces in DTsk between OW and LEAN following EX
(LEAN 1.7 § 0.7�C versus OW 1.7 § 1.6�C, p D
0.999, ES D 0.0) or PH (LEAN 4.2 § 0.4�C versus
OW 4.7 § 0.6�C, p D 0.095, ES D 0.9).
Muscle temperature
There was an effect of depth on DTm (p < 0.001), but
no effect of condition (p D 0.285) or interaction (p D
0.111, Figure 4C). Following PH, the DTm was greater
for LEAN compared to OW at a depth of 1cm (LEAN,
2.5 § 0.8�C; OW 1.9 § 0.6�C, p < 0.0005, CI D ¡0.2
to 1.4, ES D 0.8) and 3cm (LEAN, 2.3 § 0.6�C; OW
1.9 § 0.7, p < 0.005, CI D ¡0.4 to 1.2, ES D 0.6). After
EX, DTm was only different at 1cm (LEAN, 2.3 §
0.6�C; OW 2.0 § 0.7, p < 0.005, CI D ¡0.5 to 1.1,
ES D 0.4).
Mean body temperature
There was a difference in DTb between conditions
(p < 0.0001, Figure 4D). There were differences
between LEAN PH and LEAN EX (1.7 § 0.3�C versus
1.1 § 0.3�C, p < 0.005, CI D 0.3 to 1.0, ES D 1.9);
OW PH and OW EX (1.8 § 0.2�C versus 1.0 § 0.4�C;
p < 0.001, CI D 0.4 to 1.2, ES D 2.4). There were no
differences between LEAN and OW within the same
condition (both p > 0.9).
Heart rate
There were significant effects of time, condition and
interaction effect of heart rate (all p < 0.0001). Mean
percentage HRmax EX was 78 § 8% compared to 54 §
7% in PH (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in
the mean percentage of HRmax between groups for
either PH (LEAN D 54.0 § 6.0% versus OW D 55.2
§ 6.2%, p D 0.719) or EX (LEAN D 78.5 § 7.3%; OW
D 81.7 § 7.4%, p D 0.428).
Discussion
The primary outcome of the present study was that
the concentration of eHSP70 in the plasma was similar

 between EX and PH when both conditions were
matched for DTc, with DTm being the best individual
predictor of DeHSP70, explaining »25% of the total
variance. This suggests that changes to Tm may in part
determine the appearance of eHSP70. An important
secondary outcome is the increase in energy expendi-
ture evident as a consequence of PH. This has impor-
tant implications for the use of PH as a future
intervention that may help to moderate body mass,
particularly for individuals unable or unwilling to
complete regular physical activity. However, we recog-
nize that PH should be coupled with dietary manipu-
lation to maximize any potential benefit to body
composition. Finally, the reduction in peak glucose in
the meal following PH compared to EX suggests that
PH may have a beneficial effect on glycemic regulation
and provide an alternative or augmentative interven-
tion by which individuals with metabolic diseases may
be able to improve their glycemic control. However,
additional research needs to be conducted to confirm
these data in larger cohorts over a prolonged period of
time.
The HSP70 response may be hindered by excess
body mass. Regression analysis demonstrated a link
between body mass and the DeHSP70. A greater body
mass was associated with an impaired eHSP70
response to heating, via either EX or PH, explaining
16% of the total variance. Such variation may be indic-
ative of an impaired HSP response in overweight indi-
viduals in the face of physiological stress and would
likely be compounded by low aerobic capacity.46 The
implications for such a deficiency are wide ranging
and may increase susceptibility to metabolic dis-
ease,46,47 impaired vascular function48 and even con-
tribute to the impaired thermoregulatory control
evident in individuals with diabetes.49
While there were no clear differences in the HSP70
response between either PH or EX, there were clear
differences in the IL-6 response. Previous work has
shown that temperature increases independently ele-
vate IL-6.50 However, the present data do not support
the view that skeletal muscle may act as a “heat stress
sensor” triggering a subsequent cytokine response, as
none of the thermal measures taken during the trials
were effective predictors of DIL-6 and could not
account for a significant proportion of the variation in
IL-6 following heating. Our data also indicate that the
difference in IL-6 between PH and EX is not due to
HSP70 induction of IL-6,35,36 as DHSP70 was similar
following PH and EX. This suggests the IL-6 response
to EX occurs independently of HSP70 expression and
is more dependent on intensity and duration of EX,51
than exposure to heat stress. IL-6 combined with its
receptor (IL-6R), may also have a positive effect on
insulin independent glucose uptake at rest.52 Should
chronic PH enhance IL-6R expression as is evident
following EX training,53 interventions capable of
increasing both IL-6 and IL-6R, may provide a thera-
peutic basis for improving glycemic control. More-
over, it has recently been shown that acute PH
elevates the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and
IL-10,54 suggesting that chronic PH may benefit the
inflammatory profile in a similar way to EX. However,
long-term investigation of PH is required to corrobo-
rate this hypothesis.
Although the sample size for analysis of the glyce-
mic response to PH and EX was somewhat limited,
the fact that comparable glycemic profiles were evi-
dent between PH and EX is interesting. Given the
acute effect of EX on improving glucose control as a
consequence of improved insulin sensitivity,55 this is a
somewhat surprising result. However, it has recently
been shown that heat stress activates insulin indepen-
dent glucose transport via 50 adenosine monophos-
phate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.56
In response to the heat stress stimulus, a reduction in
muscle adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine and
glycogen was reported, indicating a significant energy
cost to the heating protocol and hence activation of
AMPK. This suggests that, acutely at least, heat stress
may improve glucose uptake due to increased energy
expenditure. Further work needs to be conducted to
establish the exact mechanisms by which PH may
exert such an effect.
In addition to benefits to metabolic regulation, PH
has been shown to benefit cardiovascular health. In a
recent meta-analysis, Laukkanen et al. report that life-
long sauna use reduced cardiovascular and all cause
mortality, with the largest benefits associated with
more frequent sauna use.57 Although this relationship
does not establish causality,31,58 it is nonetheless an
interesting link that is supported by recent investiga-
tions.59-61 PH appears to improve vascular function,
with improvements to flow-mediated dilatation, arte-
rial stiffness and blood pressure reported after 8 weeks
of PH.59 Moreover, Thomas et al. have shown that
30 minutes of PH can induce a significant shear stress
response and a reduction in mean arterial pressure in
300

 patients with peripheral arterial disease.62 Further-
more, in a healthy cohort who underwent matched
duration PH or EX, the PH group demonstrated a
greater shear stress response compared to that in
response to EX.60 Based on heart rate responses, the
cardiovascular strain in the present study was compa-
rable to that of Thomas et al., which elicited »50%
HRmax during their immersion protocol.60 These
recent findings indicate that PH has the potential to
induce significant systemic benefits, which in some
instances may be comparable to or even greater than
the effects evident following EX.
There are a few limitations with the present investi-
gation. First, the omission of a measure of iHSP70,
either derived from skeletal muscle or leukocytes
makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the
potential intracellular effect of PH and glycemic regu-
lation. Without direct measures of iHSP70, in addition
to JNK and other molecules in the insulin-signaling
cascade, it is difficult to derive the exact effect of PH
on acute glycemic control. Therefore, we are limited
to discuss the relationship between eHSP70 and
iHSP70 and that an increase in the extracellular com-
ponent is reflective of changes in the intracellular
compartment. Future investigation should employ
techniques to measure both iHSP70 and eHSP70 to
enable greater understanding of the effect of PH on
the intracellular to extracellular ratio. Second, the rela-
tively small sample size of this study, which may limit
the statistical power of our experiments. We acknowl-
edge that further experiments with larger cohorts
should be conducted in order to replicate the present
data.
In summary, the data presented here demon-
strate that both acute PH and EX result in compa-
rable increases in HSP70. It is suggested that
DHSP70 is sensitive to the DTm. The elevations in
both HSP70 and IL-6 may promote an anti-inflam-
matory milieu and help combat the chronic inflam-
mation associated with many disease states. The
increase in energy expenditure following PH dem-
onstrates a systemic effect of PH, which has the
ability to reduce adipose tissue and further contrib-
ute to reducing inflammation. However, it should
be noted that EX still offers the greatest overall
benefit to weight control and metabolic health.
Finally, in agreement with that of other authors,
the present data indicate that PH might provide an
alternative to EX in some individuals who are too
physically impaired to undertake prolonged aerobic
activity to improve their cardio-metabolic health.
The possible therapeutic benefits of PH require
more extensive investigation.
