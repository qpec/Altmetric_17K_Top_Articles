doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00154.2016.—We reported, using a unilat-
eral resistance training (RT) model, that training with high or low
loads (mass per repetition) resulted in similar muscle hypertrophy and
strength improvements in RT-naïve subjects. Here we aimed to
determine whether the same was true in men with previous RT
experience using a whole-body RT program and whether postexercise
systemic hormone concentrations were related to changes in hyper-
trophy and strength. Forty-nine resistance-trained men (23 � 1 yr,
mean � SE) performed 12 wk of whole-body RT. Subjects were
randomly allocated into a higher-repetition (HR) group who lifted
loads of �30-50% of their maximal strength (1RM) for 20–25
repetitions/set (n � 24) or a lower-repetition (LR) group (�75–90%
1RM, 8–12 repetitions/set, n � 25), with all sets being performed to
volitional failure. Skeletal muscle biopsies, strength testing, dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry scans, and acute changes in systemic
hormone concentrations were examined pretraining and posttraining.
In response to RT, 1RM strength increased for all exercises in both
groups (P � 0.01), with only the change in bench press being
significantly different between groups (HR, 9 � 1, vs. LR, 14 � 1 kg,
P � 0.012). Fat- and bone-free (lean) body mass and type I and type
II muscle fiber cross-sectional area increased following training (P �
0.01) with no significant differences between groups. No significant
correlations between the acute postexercise rise in any purported
anabolic hormone and the change in strength or hypertrophy were
found. In congruence with our previous work, acute postexercise
systemic hormonal rises are not related to or in any way indicative of
RT-mediated gains in muscle mass or strength. Our data show that in
resistance-trained individuals, load, when exercises are performed to
volitional failure, does not dictate hypertrophy or, for the most part,
strength gains.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY
We provide novel evidence of the effect of lifting markedly
different (lighter vs. heavier) loads (mass per repetition) during
whole-body resistance training on the development of muscle
strength and hypertrophy in previously trained persons. Using
a large sample size (n � 49), and contradicting dogma, we
report that the relative load lifted per repetition does not
determine skeletal muscle hypertrophy or, for the most part,
strength development. In line with our previous work, acute
postexercise systemic hormonal changes were unrelated to
strength and hypertrophic gains.
RESISTANCE TRAINING (RT) is a potent stimulus for increasing
skeletal muscle mass and strength (9, 30); however, the exact
RT variables that determine skeletal muscle hypertrophy and
strength remain a topic of continued investigation (3, 36).
Current recommendations are that RT with relatively heavy
[i.e., at �70–85% one-repetition maximum (1RM)] loads
(“load” herein referring to the amount of mass used per
repetition) is a prerequisite for maximizing RT-induced hyper-
trophy (12, 31). It has even been suggested, on the basis of only
acute electromyography (EMG) data [despite caution on use of
EMG in this manner (10)], that greater motor unit recruitment
occurs when lifting heavier loads even if heavier and lighter
loads are performed to volitional failure (16, 21). Notably, this
conclusion is at odds with existing data determined from
long-term training studies (28, 33). We reported that load from
as low as 30% and up to 90% of 1RM played a minimal role
in stimulating muscle protein synthesis (4). Similar loading
strategies also did not affect hypertrophy in a small sample of
trained (33) or untrained (28) men following RT when the
participants performed their RT to volitional failure. In addi-
tion, and in contrast to what others have proposed (18, 19, 31),
we have also demonstrated that resistance exercise-induced
increases in circulating hormones play little role in regulating
muscle protein synthesis after an acute bout of resistance
exercise (51) or skeletal muscle hypertrophy following RT
(50). Taken together, our data suggest that factors regulating
skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to RT include neither
load nor systemic hormonal concentrations (4, 28, 33, 50, 51).
While there is growing evidence that neither load (28, 33)
nor acute postexercise increases in circulating hormones (50)
affect RT-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy, it is important
to acknowledge that many of the aforementioned studies were
conducted in healthy, but untrained participants (4, 28, 50, 51).
Given that resistance-trained individuals exhibit an attenuated
muscle protein synthetic response to resistance exercise (17,
53), they are likely less “adaptable” than untrained persons in
terms of phenotypic adaptations of skeletal muscle in response
to RT. In addition, the model used in previous trials (4, 28) was
unilateral in nature, which is not a training model used in
practice, and limb cross-education may have obscured a true
estimate of strength development with the comparison of
lighter vs. heavier loads (6).
The primary aim of this study was to determine the effects
of a 12-wk higher-repetition (lower load) vs. a lower-repetition
(higher load) RT intervention on skeletal muscle hypertrophy

 and strength development in resistance-trained young men.
The secondary aim was to examine whether the acute postex-
ercise increase in systemic hormones was correlated with
changes in skeletal muscle mass or strength. Our hypothesis
was that neither load nor the acute postexercise increase in
systemic hormones would determine RT-induced adaptations.
METHODS
Participants. Forty-nine healthy young men (23 � 1 yr, 86 � 2 kg,
181 � 1 cm, means � SE) who had been engaging in RT for at least
the past 2 yr [4 � 2 yr, training �2 sessions per week (range 3–6
days/wk), including at least one weekly dedicated lower body session]
volunteered to participate in this study. Recognizing the high interin-
dividual response variability in hypertrophy and strength gain that occurs
with RT (13, 27, 28, 48), we conducted the study with a large enough
number of participants to allow detection of a 15% difference in hyper-
trophy via muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) change and a 10%
difference in fat- and bone-free (lean) body mass change measured by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with 90% power based on
previous work in trained men (33).
Ethics statement. All participants were informed of the purpose of
the study, experimental procedures, and associated risks prior to partic-
ipation and exercise testing. All participants gave verbal and written
informed consent, which was approved by the Hamilton Integrated
Research Ethics Board and conformed to the most recent Tri-Council
policy statement on the use of human participants in research (http://
www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/pdf/eng/tcps2-2014/TCPS_2_FINAL_Web.pdf).
The trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02139865.
Familiarization and strength testing. Two weeks prior to the start
of the RT protocol, participants completed a familiarization session to
assess each participant’s 10RM for each exercise. At least 72 h after
any exercise, participants returned to the laboratory to complete 1RM
(strength) testing on the inclined leg press (LP; Maxam Fitness,
Hamilton, ON, Canada), barbell bench press (BP), machine-guided
knee extension (KE; Atlantis, Laval, QC, Canada), and machine-
guided shoulder press (SP; Life Fitness, Rosemont, IL). The same
investigators administered all strength testing. In short, after a brief
general warm-up, a specific warm-up of the given exercise was then
performed at �50% of the participant’s estimated 1RM based on the
10RM testing. Load was progressively increased by �10–20% for
each repetition until a true 1RM was reached as previously described
(5, 40). Three to five minutes of rest was given between each attempt.
A successful attempt required the participant to move the load
throughout the full range of motion with correct form.
Experimental design. A schematic illustration of the experimental
design can be seen in Fig. 1A. A between-group, repeated measures
design in which participants were randomly allocated to one of two
possible conditions, high repetition (HR; n � 29) or low repetition
(LR; n � 27; Fig. 2), was employed. For the training program the HR
group performed 3 sets of 20–25 repetitions per set such that the load
varied between �30 and 50% of 1RM with each set being performed
to volitional failure. The LR group performed 3 sets of 8–12 repeti-
tions per set that corresponded to �75–90% of 1RM with each set
being performed to volitional failure (38). The loads were adjusted in
between each set to ensure that the correct repetition range was
maintained. Each participant underwent 12 wk of full-body RT 4 days
per week. Session attendance was 97 � 2% for the HR group and
96 � 2% for the LR group with no difference between groups. Both
groups performed 1RM testing at baseline and retested at 3, 6, 9, and
12 wk on what would be the participants’ first session of the week.
Participants consumed 30 g of whey protein (BioPRO; Davisco Foods
International, Le Sueur, MN) twice per day: immediately following
RT on training days (8) and the other prior to sleep (39). On
nontraining days, participants consumed the first dose in the morning
and the second dose 1–2 h prior to sleep, similar to training days.
Acute protocol. A schematic illustration of the acute blood sam-
pling protocol can be seen in Fig. 1B. At least 72 h following the
familiarization and strength testing, each participant came in after an
overnight fast and received a muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis
and a resting blood sample via an intravenous antecubital cannula.
Following the resting blood draw, a bout of resistance exercise was
performed that consisted of a “superset” (exercises conducted in
succession with no rest in between) including an incline leg press,
hamstring curl, and knee extension. Participants were given 1 min of
rest following each superset with three supersets performed in total.
Each exercise was performed until volitional failure in their respective
group repetition ranges (HR or LR). Following the bout of resistance
exercise, the participant was given 30 g of pure whey protein (Bio-
PRO; Davisco Foods International) mixed with 500 ml of water.
Blood samples were collected at 0 (immediately post), 15, 30, and 60
min following the consumption of the protein beverage.
Hormone concentrations. Blood samples were obtained via a can-
nula that was inserted into an antecubital vein kept patent by periodic
flushes of 0.9% saline. Tubes containing whole blood were allowed to
clot for 30 min at room temperature before serum (4 ml) was isolated.

 Heparinized tubes were used to isolate plasma (4 ml). All blood tubes
were centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4°C prior to serum and
plasma being separated into cryotubes and frozen at �80°C until
further analysis. Blood samples were analyzed for serum total testos-
terone (T; ng/dl), free T (fT; pg/ml), cortisol (nM), dihydrotestoster-
one (DHT; ng/ml), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; ng/ml), luteiniz-
ing hormone (LH; IU/l), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1; �g/dl),
free IGF-1 (fIGF-1; ng/ml), lactate (mM), and growth hormone (GH;
ng/ml) using solid-phase, two-site chemiluminescence immunometric
assays (Immulite; Intermedico, Holliston, MA) or radio-immunoassay
(Diagnostics Products, Los Angeles, CA). All analyses resulted in
interassay coefficients of variation (CV; n � 245) of less than 6% and
intraassay CV (n � 2,450) on replicates of less than 4%.
Body composition. Body composition was assessed following an
overnight fast (12 h) and �72 h following their last exercise bout both
preintervention and postintervention. DXA measurements were con-
ducted using a GE Lunar iDXA total body scanner (GE Medical
Systems Lunar, Madison, WI) and analyzed with software (Lunar
enCORE version 14.1; GE Medical Systems Lunar) in the medium
scan mode. The machine was calibrated each testing day by using a
three-compartment Universal Whole Body DXA Phantom: Oscar, Jr
(Orthometrix, Naples, FL). The analysis regions used were standard
regions where the head, torso, arms, and legs were subdivided by the
software, but were subsequently checked manually, in a blinded
manner, by a single investigator. Intrascan (without repositioning) and
interscan (on different occasions) variability using the phantom was
�1.6% for all tissues.
Dietary records. Dietary intake records were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9,
and 12 wk and analyzed using the NutriBase dietary analysis software
(Nutribase11 Professional Edition, version 11.5; Cybersoft, Phoenix,
AZ).
Resistance-training intervention. The full-body RT was performed
4 days/wk (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday). Each day
included five exercises, consisting of two separate supersets and one
additional exercise. Exercises were performed for three sets, with each
set executed until volitional failure. One minute of rest was given
between each set or superset. Each workout was repeated twice per
week [Monday/Thursday: inclined leg press with seated row (superset
1), barbell bench press with cable hamstring curl (superset 2), and
front planks (set 3). Tuesday/Friday: machine-guided shoulder press
with bicep curls (superset 1), triceps extension with wide-grip pull
downs (superset 2), and machine-guided knee extension (set 3)]. If
necessary, loads were decreased (�5–10%) between sets to ensure
repetitions were performed within the participant’s assigned repetition
range. Each participant was individually supervised by a trainer for
each session to ensure each set was performed to volitional failure
with correct technique. Participants’ load was increased with subse-
quent training sessions when they could perform more repetitions than
their designated repetition range. Weeks during the training interven-
tion that included 1RM testing (weeks 4, 7, and 10) involved only

 three prescribed sessions with 1RM testing to serve as the fourth
session. Participants were asked to refrain from any additional exer-
cise outside of the study.
Volume. The volume, sometimes referred to as “volume-load,” of
each set was calculated by multiplying the number of repetitions with
the load. Total volume was calculated as the sum of each set’s volume
throughout the 12-wk RT intervention. Average session volume was
calculated by dividing the total volume by the number of sessions that
participant attended.
Muscle fiber type and cross-sectional area. Muscle biopsies were
obtained from the vastus lateralis preintervention and postinterven-
tion. Biopsies were taken using a 5-mm Bergström needle custom
modified for manual suction under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine).
Participants had not participated in any physical activity for 72 h prior
to each biopsy. Upon excision, the muscle samples were immediately
cleared of visible connective tissue and fat and were oriented verti-
cally by visual inspection before being embedded in optimal cutting
temperature medium. The mounted muscle was frozen in isopentane,
cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at �80°C until further analysis.
Cross sections (7-�m thick) were cut on a Microm HM550 Cyrostat
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), mounted on glass slides,
and stained. Fiber type and CSA were assessed via immunofluorescent
staining of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms and dystrophin as
previously described (2, 37). Primary antibodies against dystrophin
(MANDYs), MHCI (BA-F8), MHCIIA (SC-71), and MHCIIX (6H1;
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) followed by
isotope-specific fluorescent secondary antibodies allowed for the iden-
tification of type I, type IIA, and type IIX fibers. Slides were mounted
with Prolong Diamond Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies, Burl-
ington, ON, Canada) and imaged the following day. Images were
taken with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope at a magnification of 20X
and captured with a Photometrics Cool SNAP HQ2 fluorescent
camera (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY). Analysis was completed
using the Nikon NIS elements AR software (Nikon Instruments) on a
large-scale image. All data reported in this manuscript, unless other-
wise stated, have type IIA and type IIX fiber types pooled together and
reported as type II fibers because of the number necessary to individ-
ually analyze type IIA and IIX fibers (�50–60) per sample (24, 25).
Fiber CSA was determined by counting at least 100 individual fibers,
and fiber type was assessed using the whole cross section of fibers
(367 � 18 fibers). All fibers selected for analysis were free of freezing
artifact, and care was taken so that obliquely or longitudinally oriented
fibers were not used in the analysis. Muscle fibers on the periphery of
muscle cross sections were not used in the analysis. The same
investigator, who was blinded to the time and group of each sample,
conducted all immunofluorescent analyses. All mention of CSA refers
to the muscle fiber CSA determined by muscle biopsy.
Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS (ver-
sion 22.0; Chicago, IL). Baseline characteristics were compared
between groups using an independent t-test. The postexercise hor-
monal area under the curve (AUC) was calculated by subtracting the
baseline concentration from the postexercise AUC of each hormone
(60 min). Bivariate correlations were run for the two-tailed Pearson
correlation coefficient between the postexercise hormone AUC and
the change in strength and muscle mass. Muscle strength, lean body
mass, muscle fiber CSA, muscle fiber type, and postexercise hormonal
AUC were all analyzed using a two-factor (group � time) repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with group (between) and
time (within) as the experimental variables. In addition, independent
t-tests were performed with the independent variable as condition and
the dependent variable as the absolute change for each measure of
strength and muscle mass, all reported with their mean and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was accepted when
P � 0.05. Results are presented as means � SE in text and tables
unless otherwise specified. To show the variability in response, graphs
are presented as box-and-whisker plots including the median (lines),
mean (crosses), interquartile range (boxes), and 95% CI (tails).
RESULTS
Descriptive characteristics. Forty-nine participants com-
pleted this study (Table 1). Participants were similar at baseline
for all descriptive characteristics with no differences between
groups (P � 0.05) with the exception of fat mass (P � 0.05;
Table 1). Seven participants did not complete the study proto-
col because of non-intervention-related injuries (n � 5) or
relocation (n � 2; Fig. 2). There was no significant difference
in dietary intake of macronutrients or energy between groups at
0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 wk (P � 0.05; data not shown).
Body composition and muscle fiber CSA. Kolmogorov-Smir-
nov and Levene’s tests were run for normality and homogene-
ity of variance, respectively, and all assumptions were met
(P � 0.05). Following the intervention (using pooled
means), there was an increase in type I [5,448 � 152 to
6,113 � 150 �m2; F(1,47) � 19.45, P � 0.001; Fig. 3B] and
type II [6,193 � 176 to 7,171 � 158 �m2; F(1,47) � 26.11,
P � 0.001; Fig. 3D] CSA with no significant difference
between groups. Independent t-tests on the absolute change
also revealed no difference between groups for muscle fiber
CSA in either type I [t(47) � �0.29, P � 0.77, mean
(M) � �88, 95% CI (�693, 518)] or type II [t(47) �
�0.52, P � 0.61, M � �198, 95% CI (�967, 569)].
There were no group, time, or group by time interactions for
type I and type II fiber type distributions with the intervention;
however, with means pooled and all fiber types included (type
I, IIA, and IIX), there was a shift from type IIX [10.3 � 1.1 to
6.5 � 0.72%; F(1,47) � 8.95, P � 0.004] to type IIA fibers
[45 � 1.7 to 49.7 � 1.2%; F(1,47) � 5.11, P � 0.03].
Following the intervention (using pooled means), there was
a significant increase in total fat- and bone-free mass [FBFM;
64.6 � 1.1 to 65.8 � 1.1 kg; F(1,47) � 40.50, P � 0.01; Fig.
3F] with no significant difference between groups indicated by
ANOVA and by an independent t-test [t(47) � �1.91, P �
0.091, M � �0.73, 95% CI (�1.49, 0.04)]. There was also a
significant increase in appendicular lean mass [ALM; 33.1 �
0.6 to 34.0 � 0.6 kg; F(1,47) � 30.19, P � 0.001] and leg lean
mass [LLM; 24.4 � 0.5 to 25.0 � 0.5 kg; F(1,47) � 16.97,
P � 0.001] with no significant differences between groups.
Strength. All exercises passed normality assessed by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (P � 0.05) with the exception of
preintervention LP (P � 0.03) and BP (P � 0.01); however,
assessment of histogram and probability-probability (P-P)
plots revealed no kurtosis or skewness. Levene’s test revealed
no significance for any variable (P � 0.05). Maximum isotonic

 strength (using pooled means) increased for LP [355 � 10 to
480 � 11 kg; F(1,48) � 249.77, P � 0.001], KE [76 � 2 to
107 � 2 kg; F(1,47) � 216.91, P � 0.001], SP [91 � 3 to 112 �
12 kg; F(1,46) � 113.83, P � 0.001], and BP [97 � 3 to 109 �
3 kg; F(1,47) � 152.07, P � 0.001; Fig. 4] following the
intervention. There were no group by time differences for LP, KE,
or SP; however, the change in BP was greater in the LR group
(14 � 1 kg) than in the HR group [9 � 1 kg; F(1,47) � 6.75,
P � 0.012; Fig. 4, C and D]. Independent t-tests on the absolute
change also revealed no significant difference between groups for
LP [t(47) � �0.1, P � 0.05, M � �2.55, 95% CI (�53, 48)], KE
[t(47) � �1.47, P � 0.05, M � �6.03, 95% CI (�14, 2)], and
SP [t(47) � 0.55, P � 0.05, M � 4.3, 95% CI (�11, 19)];
however, as the ANOVA results showed, there was a significant
difference between group difference for BP [t(47) � �2.6, P �
0.05, M � �4.9, 95% CI (�8.7, �1.1)].
Resistance-training volume. Average volume per session
was significantly lower in the LR group (14,805 � 592 kg)
than in the HR group (23,969 � 901 kg; P � 0.001).
Hormone concentrations. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
showed normality for all postexercise hormone AUCs (P �
0.05) with the exception of preintervention and postinterven-
tion cortisol (P � 0.001); however, assessment of histogram
and P-P plots revealed little to no kurtosis or skewness.
Levene’s test revealed that preintervention lactate (P � 0.03),
preintervention cortisol (P � 0.03), and postintervention lac-
tate (P � 0.01) were significant. The hormone concentrations
were not “corrected” for blood volume shifts, which have a
negligible impact on the results, as we propose that the “un-

 DISCUSSION
Twelve weeks of supervised, higher- and lower-load per
repetition RT programs were similarly effective at inducing
skeletal muscle hypertrophy in resistance-trained participants
when RT was performed to volitional failure. Additionally,
when participants were tested periodically for maximal
strength (i.e., essentially being allowed to practice their 1RM),
the increases in muscular strength were not significantly different
between groups. The exception was bench press 1RM, which
increased to a greater extent in the LR group. Additionally,
postexercise levels of circulating hormones did not change as a
result of the RT intervention and were unrelated to changes in
muscle mass and strength.
The amount of mass lifted per repetition (referred to here as
load) is not a primary determinant of changes in muscle protein
synthesis (4) or hypertrophy (28) when resistance exercise is
performed until volitional failure in untrained participants.
Mitchell et al. (28) demonstrated greater gains in muscle mass
than in the present study following 10 wk of RT in untrained
participants who performed only knee extension thrice weekly
[i.e., Mitchell et al. (28) vs. present study: type I CSA, �23 vs.
�12%; type II CSA, �19 vs. 16%]. The attenuated gains in
muscle size in the present study vs. those seen by Mitchell et
al. (28) are congruent with previous literature showing a
blunted training response in resistance-trained individuals, who
would presumably have less capacity for adaptation since they
are regularly exposed to the stimulus of RT (17, 42). Taken
together with previous data (4, 28), the findings of the present
study, along with a recent metaanalysis (35), do not support the
assertion that higher-load RT is a prerequisite to maximize

 RT-induced muscle hypertrophy especially when lower-load
exercises are performed to volitional failure.
Few studies have addressed the effect of load with hyper-
trophy and strength as main outcomes when the exercise
sessions are not volume-matched (20, 28). Indeed, in a volume-
matched situation, low-repetition (high load) RT appears to
provide a greater stimulus for hypertrophy and strength gains
(5, 15, 41); however, it is obvious that when performing RT
with lighter loads, a greater lifting volume (repetitions � load)
is needed to reach volitional failure. In the present study, which
had participants perform RT until volitional failure, average
session volume performed in the LR group was only �62% of
that performed by the HR group. We hypothesize that the
increased volume performed by the HR group allowed them to
reach volitional failure, which led to the similar adaptations
seen in the LR group, a finding consistent with previous studies

 (4, 28, 33). Alternatively viewed, performance of a LR set at
80% of 1RM and a HR set performed at 40% of 1RM would
result, at volitional failure, in the LR set having lost only
�20% of their force-generating capacity and the HR group
having lost �60% of their force-generating capacity. To be
clear, it is apparent that a HR group would have to perform
more repetitions (thus more volume) and lose more of their
force-generating capacity (fatigue) to reach volitional failure
on any given set. While the mechanisms underlying fatigue
may be different between groups (11, 22), at volitional failure
the size principle would dictate that larger motor units have
been recruited in an attempt to sustain the required force (14,
26). There have been recent claims that greater EMG ampli-
tude seen with a higher- vs. a lower-load condition is equiva-
lent to greater motor unit drive and thus greater potential for
hypertrophy (21); however, such a premise is fundamentally
incorrect as has been pointed out (45, 46). The current data,
along with previous work (28, 35), are direct proof that
hypertrophy and strength gains are not a function of the load
lifted and directly contradict the assertion that acute EMG
recordings predict hypertrophic potential (21). Instead, we
propose that exercising until volitional failure with adequate
volume and load (between 30–90% 1RM) will sufficiently
activate muscle motor units, which drives skeletal muscle
hypertrophy.
Studies that have used volume-matched groups often have
participants lift in a lower-repetition (higher load) condition to
volitional failure to determine the volume that the higher-
repetition (lower load) group will match (15, 41). This scenario
would, we argue, not allow the high-repetition group to per-
form their RT to volitional failure and would result in an
inferior stimulus. For example, Holm et al. (15) examined
untrained young men performing volume-matched unilateral
RT and found that low-repetition RT resulted in a significantly
greater increase in muscle CSA (measured via magnetic reso-
nance imaging) compared with the high-repetition RT (7.6 vs.
2.6%, respectively). Indeed, work from our group using a
similar model indicates that a higher-repetition, lower-load
group volume-matched to a lower-repetition, higher-load
group produces a substantially inferior muscle protein synthe-
sis response (4). In contrast, however, lower loads, when lifted
to volitional failure (i.e., using a greater volume than the
higher-load condition), results in a similar stimulation of mus-
cle protein synthesis (4) and equivalent hypertrophy (28). Even
if different RT programs are manipulated to have participants
exercise until volitional failure and be volume-matched (e.g.,
more sets) (34), it remains apparent that the similar adaptations
are a result of the resistance exercise being performed until
volitional failure. Thus, in the current protocol, our participants
performed their RT, regardless of group assignment, to voli-
tional failure. As mentioned previously, allowing the HR group
to perform more volume, resulting in volitional failure, there
was fatigue that would have driven motor unit recruitment (4,
28) and therefore hypertrophy of the muscle fibers innervated
by both large and small motor units (28, 29).
Following the 12-wk intervention, there were similar in-
creases in muscular strength between groups. Specifically, both
HR and LR increased LP, KE, and SP 1RM with no differences
between groups. However, while both groups increased BP
1RM, the increase was greater in the LR group compared with
the HR group (15 vs. 9%; Fig. 4, C and D). Notably, others
have also found similar increases in 1RM in healthy untrained
(15) and trained (33) men performing either low- or high-load
RT. It is evident that current literature supports the use of both
low-repetition (high load) (1, 20, 41) and high-repetition (low
load) (5, 28, 44) RT to induce increases in maximal strength.
Our results support the concept that maximal strength increases
can be achieved with the use of either low or high loads, so
long as there is periodic practice of lifting with heavier loads,
whereas the disparity in BP 1RM changes remain in agreement
with literature supporting the use of high loads with a low
repetition range. We have previously reported greater increases
in isotonic 1RM when performing RT with high loads (80%
1RM) than low loads (30% 1RM); however, when strength was
evaluated with an unpracticed test, a 5-s isometric maximum
voluntary contraction using a dynamometer, there was no
difference between groups (28). Indeed, strength is a product of
muscle mass (23), neural adaptation (7, 32), and “practice”
of the desired outcome. Though there is no apparent advantage
of lifting with different loads on changes in muscle mass, there
is undoubtedly a neuromuscular advantage to lifting heavier
loads if the primary outcome is performing a 1RM test (28).
Conversely, it appears that periodic practice of the chosen
strength outcome (e.g., 1RM) is effective at eliminating the
majority of any posttraining difference.
A further purpose of the current study was to investigate the
effects of novel (DHT, DHEA, and LH) and canonical (IGF-1,
GH, and T) postexercise, circulating hormones that have been
hypothesized to provide an anabolic stimulus [for reviews, see
Kraemer and Ratamess (19) and Vingren et al. (47)]. An acute
bout of exercise induces a significant but transient systemic rise
in a variety of hormones and metabolites (19). It has been
previously reported that the postexercise hormonal environ-
ment does not contribute to the resistance exercise-induced
muscle protein synthetic response (51) or hypertrophy follow-
ing RT (50). Despite women having �15- and 45-fold lower
resting and postexercise systemic T concentrations, respec-
tively, men and women experience similar magnitudes of
myofibrillar protein synthesis in response to the same RT
stimulus (49). West and Phillips (52) concluded that anabolic
hormones such as GH, IGF-1, and T have little to no correla-
tion with changes in hypertrophy and strength as a result of a
12-wk RT intervention. The present study adds to these results
by comparing the hormonal response to different (high and low
load) RT regimens in resistance-trained persons. We observed
no correlations, at any time point, between the postexercise
AUC for T, GH, and IGF-1 and changes in muscle mass and
strength. Last, the postexercise concentrations of any of the
aforementioned hormones are not even moderately (r � 0.45)
relevant indicators of RT-induced changes in muscle mass and
strength in resistance-trained men (Table 2) and do not change
as a result of RT (Fig. 5). We acknowledge that the acute
exercise trial was conducted in the fasted state, which may
limit the direct applicability of these data to the applied setting;
however, when subjects were fed, we have also not observed
relationships between hormones and hypertrophy (52).
It is important to acknowledge that our repetition ranges and
loads were chosen to match previous study “intensities” (4, 5,
15, 28, 43, 44) and replicate those of current guidelines set
forth by the American College of Sports Medicine (31) and
National Strength and Conditioning Association (12). As men-
tioned before (28) and in a recent review (29), we propose that

 muscle hypertrophy is fundamentally driven by motor unit
activation. The current data demonstrate that performing RT
with high and low repetitions (using low and high loads,
respectively) to volitional failure provides a similar and suffi-
cient stimulus, though neither are necessary, for hypertrophy or
strength. In conjunction with previous data (28), it appears that
if 1RM strength is the primary goal, performing the to-be-
tested exercise with heavier loads, either consistently and/or
periodically, may be required for optimal improvement. Thus
lifting heavier and lighter loads should not be mutually exclu-
sive in terms of promoting RT adaptations, but as training
“zones” that could easily be used in RT programs without the
expectation that strength or muscle mass gains would be
significantly compromised, though we acknowledge that train-
ing paradigms should be tailored to the individual’s goals and
preferences.
In conclusion, high- and low-repetition (low and high load,
respectively) training paradigms elicit a comparable stimulus
for the accretion of skeletal muscle mass when resistance
exercise is performed until volitional failure. The current
findings taken together with previous reports (1, 20, 28) show
that these effects are not contingent upon training status or
study design. Increases in lean body mass, as an indirect
measure of muscle mass, and muscle fiber CSA, a direct
measure of muscle area, occurred in both LR and HR groups
with no differences between groups. There was a significant
increase in 1RM strength for the leg press, knee extension, and
shoulder press exercises, again with no differences between
groups. While 1RM bench press increased in both groups, it
increased to a greater extent in the LR group. We speculate that
because the participants in the HR group performed greater
volume, they were able to exercise until volitional failure,
which allowed for maximal activation of their motor units and
ultimately led to the similar increases in muscle strength and
hypertrophy seen in the LR group. In agreement with previous
studies (50–52) it is clear that the postexercise increases in
systemic hormone concentrations are unrelated to changes in
muscle hypertrophy or strength.
