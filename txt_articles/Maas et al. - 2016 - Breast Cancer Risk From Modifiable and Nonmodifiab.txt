IMPORTANCE An improved model for risk stratification can be useful for guiding public health
strategies of breast cancer prevention.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate combined risk stratification utility of common low penetrant single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiologic risk factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using a total of 17 171 cases and 19 862 controls sampled
from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) and 5879 women
participating in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, a model for predicting absolute
risk of breast cancer was developed combining information on individual level data on
epidemiologic risk factors and 24 genotyped SNPs from prospective cohort studies,
published estimate of odds ratios for 68 additional SNPs, population incidence rate from the
National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer
registry and data on risk factor distribution from nationally representative health survey. The
model is used to project the distribution of absolute risk for the population of white women in
the United States after adjustment for competing cause of mortality.
EXPOSURES Single nucleotide polymorphisms, family history, anthropometric factors,
menstrual and/or reproductive factors, and lifestyle factors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Degree of stratification of absolute risk owing to
nonmodifiable (SNPs, family history, height, and some components of menstrual and/or
reproductive history) and modifiable factors (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared], menopausal hormone therapy [MHT],
alcohol, and smoking).
RESULTS The average absolute risk for a 30-year-old white woman in the United States
developing invasive breast cancer by age 80 years is 11.3%. A model that includes all risk
factors provided a range of average absolute risk from 4.4% to 23.5% for women in the
bottom and top deciles of the risk distribution, respectively. For women who were at the
lowest and highest deciles of nonmodifiable risks, the 5th and 95th percentile range of the
risk distribution associated with 4 modifiable factors was 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5% to 25.0%,
respectively. For women in the highest decile of risk owing to nonmodifiable factors, those
who had low BMI, did not drink or smoke, and did not use MHT had risks comparable to an
average woman in the general population.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This model for absolute risk of breast cancer including SNPs
can provide stratification for the population of white women in the United States. The model
can also identify subsets of the population at an elevated risk that would benefit most from
risk-reduction strategies based on altering modifiable factors. The effectiveness of this model
for individual risk communication needs further investigation.

recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to
the identification of 92 common susceptibility loci marked by
singlenucleotidepolymorphisms(SNPs).6-8TheseSNPsareeach
associated with only a small effect size but cumulatively ex-
plain substantial variation in risk.9,10 The proportion of varia-
tion in risk explained by common genetic variation is likely to
increase in the near future, after the completion of the OncoAr-
ray project11 that is anticipated to detect many additional risk-
associated variants for breast cancer.

Methods
Study Population
The BPC3 has previously been described in detail.19-21 In short,
it consists of 8 large, prospective cohorts from Europe, Austra-
lia, and the United States with genetic data and questionnaire
information. The diagnosis of cases of breast cancer was con-
firmedbymedicalrecordsand/ortumorregistries.Analysespre-
sented in this manuscript include only invasive breast cancer
cases. We analyzed data available from the nested case-
control samples within the cohorts selected for genetic stud-
ies. In these studies, subjects were considered eligible controls
if they were free of breast cancer until the diagnosis of breast
cancer in the matched case subject. Matching criteria varied
amongcohorts,butageandmenopausalstatusatbaselinewere
usedforall.TheBPC3projectwasapprovedbytheethicalcom-
mitteeoftheInternationalAgencyforResearchonCancer(IARC)
for the EPIC cohort, by the Emory University Institutional Re-
viewBoardforCPS-IIcohort,bytheInstitutionalReviewBoard

niafortheMECcohort,bytheethicalcommitteeoftheBrigham
and Women’
s Hospital for the NHS cohort and the NCI Institu-
tional Review Board for the PLCO cohort.
The BPC3 study and published estimates of SNP odds ra-
tios (ORs) were used to develop a logistic regression model that
included a polygenic risk score (PRS), nonmodifiable risk fac-
tors other than the PRS (ie, family history, age at first birth, par-
ity, age at menarche, height, menopausal status, and age at
menopause), along with modifiable risk factors (ie, body mass
index[BMI;calculatedasweightinkilogramsdividedbyheight
inmeterssquared],MHTuse,levelofalcoholconsumption,and
smoking status). The eMethods in the Supplement describe in
detail all steps in the development of this model, which in-
cludes 92 known susceptibility SNPs (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment) and the other risk factors. Data on 24 SNPs genotyped in
Key Points
Questions What is the utility of low penetrant common single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for guiding public health
strategies for breast cancer prevention?
Findings A risk prediction model including 92 susceptibility SNPs
and various epidemiologic risk factors can provide important
stratification for absolute risk for white women in the United
States. The model predicts that effect of healthy lifestyle choices
for risk reduction is expected to be larger for women who are at
higher risk owing to genetic susceptibility and other nonmodifiable
risk factors.
Meaning The assessment of common SNPs may be useful for
screening recommendations and individualized risk
communication.

score for the 24 SNPs (PRS-24) by assuming additive associa-
tionsonthelogscaleoftheSNPsinthelogisticregressionmodel
after adjustment for study, age at study entry, and family his-
tory. Data on the 24 genotyped SNPs was used to evaluate mul-
tiplicative interactions between individual SNPs and PRS-24
with other risk factors. We also used a recently developed tail-
based χ2 goodness of fit test22 to assess possible deviations of
risks estimated from a multiplicative model from true risks at
the extremes of the risk distribution. Assuming the validity of
the multiplicative model, we then derived a model based on all
92 known breast cancer SNPs (PRS-92) based on published ORs
for the 68 remaining SNPs that were not genotyped in BPC3.

Results
The analysis involved a total number of 17 171 cases and 19 862
controls from 8 prospective cohort studies, but the number of
cases and controls with complete information in each study
varied by risk factor (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Assessment of Interactions and Risk Model Building
The additive model on the logistic scale for the SNP-risk asso-
ciations in the PRS-24 risk model was adequate, even at the
extremes of risk. Consistently, estimates of the ORs associ-
atedwithdecilesofafittedlogisticregressionmodelforPRS-24
andfamilyhistorycloselyfollowedtheirvaluespredictedfrom
the normal distribution theory for PRS (eMethods and eTable
3 in the Supplement).
Odds ratio estimates for individual risk factors from the
fitted multivariate logistic regression model are shown in eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement. The association between risk and
quantitative factors (height, number of children, age at first
birth, and alcohol use) appeared to be nonlinear on the logis-
tic scale; thus, in subsequent analysis, we modeled quantita-
tive factors as categorical variables, defined by the deciles of
their distributions in controls (eMethods and eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Higher BMI was associated with increased risk
only for postmenopausal women, and the strength of the as-
sociation was stronger for patients who did not use MHT (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement). We did not detect any statistically
significantinteractionsbetweenPRS-24andindividualriskfac-
tors in the categorical or the continuous modeling ap-
proaches (data not shown). We also performed an overall χ2
goodness-of-fit test for this model using a tail-based method22
and found that the model including both PRS-24 and all other
risk factors in a multiplicative fashion (or additive in the lo-
gistic scale) fit the BPC3 data adequately.
The final risk model included main effects of the PRS-92
(genotyped PRS-24 plus simulated PRS-68, as described in our
Methods section), main effects of all of the risk factors coded
ascategoricalvariables,andinteractiontermsinvolvingmeno-
pausalstatus,BMI,andMHTvariables(eMethodsintheSupple-
ment). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for
models with only questionnaire-based risk factors, only PRS-
92, and both types of risk factors were 0.588, 0.623, and 0.648,
respectively (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Stratification of Absolute Breast Cancer Risk
Although AUC values were low to modest, the models, par-
ticularlythemodelsincludingthePRS,ledtosubstantialspread
in the distribution of absolute risk for the population. For ex-
ample, the absolute cumulative risk of a 30-year-old white
woman in the United States developing invasive breast can-
cer over the next 50 years is 11.3% on average. A model based
on PRS-92 and questionnaire-based risk factors could iden-
tify 5% of the population with risk below 4.5% or above 22.0%

(Figure 1). As risk accumulated over age, the degree of strati-
fication of absolute risk provided by all the risk factors com-
bined also increased with age (Figure 2). The percentage of the
population that could be identified to be of moderate risk (two-

high risk (>3-fold risk compared with the population average)
variedsubstantiallyamongmodels(Table1),withthemostpro-
nounceddiscriminationforthefullmodelcomparedwithmod-
els with only PRS-based or questionnaire-based risk factors.
Distribution of Modifiable and Nonmodifiable
Breast Cancer Risk
The spread in the distribution of risk by the 4 modifiable risk
factors (ie, BMI, MHT use, alcohol use, smoking) was larger for
those substrata of the population that were at higher risk ow-
ing to nonmodifiable risk factors (Figure 3). For example, the
5th and 95th percentile ranges of the risk distribution associ-
ated with modifiable factors were 2.9% to 5.0% and 15.5 to
25.0% for subjects who were in the lowest and highest deciles
of nonmodifiable risk, respectively. Accordingly, estimates of
the proportion of cases that could be prevented by the reduc-
tion of modifiable risks varied substantially across these strata,
with a higher proportion of preventable cases in the strata de-
fined by higher nonmodifiable risks (Table 2). In our model,
we defined women at the lowest risk from modifiable risk fac-
tors as those who were in the lowest decile of BMI, did not use
MHT, did not drink alcohol, and did not smoke. Overall, we es-
timated that up to 28.9% of all breast cancers could be pre-
ventedifallwhitewomenintheUSpopulationwereatthelow-
est risk from these 4 modifiable risk factors. Nearly one-fifth
of these total preventable cases arise from the subpopulation
in the top decile of nonmodifiable risk. In contrast, only about
4% of the preventable cases arise from the population in the
lowest decile of nonmodifiable risk.

Utilizing a model including most known risk factors for breast
cancer, we have shown that this information can be used to

ferentlevelsofabsoluteriskforinvasivebreastcancer.Wehave
also shown that the benefit (in terms of reductions in abso-
lute risk) this population could achieve by changing modifi-
able risk factors is expected to be larger for those who are at

catesthatindividualinformationonriskcouldbeusefulinmak-
ing more informed decisions on breast cancer prevention.
Our results are generally consistent with the theoretical
projections made regarding the degree of risk stratification
achievable for various breast cancer risk models under a num-
ber of assumptions, including multiplicative effects of ge-
netic and other risk factors.10 Like other recent large
studies,18,19,21,29-32 we did not detect any evidence of multi-
plicative interactions between lifestyle and/or environmen-
tal risk factors and SNPs. Moreover, by application of a novel
χ2 goodness-of-fit test22 designed to detect model misspeci-
fication at extremes of disease risk, our analysis provides ad-
ditional evidence that a multiplicative model for gene-
environment interactions is adequate for describing the joint
risk of breast cancer for women with different risk factor pro-
files. This was shown for the 24 SNPs that were genotyped in
our sample. We could not validate the multiplicative assump-
tion of the model for the full set of 92 SNPs owing to the lack
of genotyped data on 68 SNPs. However, our analyses of 24
SNPs and other very large, previously published
studies18,19,21,29-32 including more SNPs provide solid sup-
port for the multiplicative model. Multiplicative effects across
many risk factors, even when individual effects are modest,
can lead to pronounced stratification for absolute risk of breast
cancer, as described in this report. The multiplicative model
also implies that the absolute risk difference from modifiable
risk factors varies by levels of nonmodifiable risk factors.33
The US Preventive Services Task Force currently recom-
mends biennial screening mammography for women ages 50
to 74 years and consideration of individual factors, such as risk
and potential benefit, for the decision to start screening mam-
mography prior to age 50 years. Our analysis shows that use
of a model based on most known risk factors can change the
recommendation for screening for a substantial fraction of the
population, compared with using only age-based criteria
(Table 1). For example, a full model based on PRS and other
risk factors can identify 16.1% of the population who can be

recommended to start screening at age 40 years as their 10-
year risk exceeds that of an average 50-year-old woman. How-
ever, the number of additional cases that would be detect-
able by screening would still be low, as a percentage of the
womenforwhomriskneedstobeassessed,andthusthepopu-
lation-level benefit of such practice, would depend on the
implementation cost of risk assessment. The full model can
also identify 32.0% of the population who at age 50 years have
10-year risk less than that of an average 40-year-old woman.
These women benefit least from screening and may benefit
from additional counseling about risk of false-positive
results.
Resultsfromtheseanalysescouldhaveimplicationsforfu-
ture cancer prevention efforts, particularly for risk communi-
cation and counseling at an individual level. For instance,
women found to be at elevated risk owing to factors that can-
not be changed may be more motivated to adopt a healthy life-
style to lower their risk of breast cancer if they had a better
understanding of the potential gains. In this regard, it is en-
couraging that even for women in the highest decile of risk
owing to nonmodifiable factors, those who had low BMI, did
not smoke or drink, and did not use MHT, had risks compa-
rable to those for an average woman in the general popula-
tion. Further research is needed to evaluate how knowledge
of individual risk can influence behavior to modify risk.34,35
Early studies36-39 that have evaluated whether knowledge of
genetic risk can improve health behavior have shown mixed
results. As the number of susceptibility markers and their cu-
mulative power to identify risk continue to increase for many
common diseases, it will be increasingly important to de-
velopandevaluateeffectiveriskcommunicationstrategiesthat
may motivate adoption of healthy behavior.
Consistent with a previous report from the United
Kingdom,4 our analysis indicates that only a modest propor-
tion (29%) of breast cancer cases could be prevented by modi-
fying most known risk factors. We also showed that a larger
fraction of the total preventable cases would occur among
women at higher levels of risk owing to genetic risk factors and
other nonmodifiable risk factors. This could indicate that cer-
tain interventions for risk factor modification that may not be
applicable to the whole population because of cost and other
considerations could be targeted to high-risk strata to obtain
a higher yield of cancers prevented. As noted before, the cost-
benefit ratio of such targeted intervention will depend on the
cost of implementing risk assessment. However, a substan-
tial proportion of cases preventable by modification of risk
factors is still expected to arise outside the high-risk strata.
Therefore, to have a major effect on reducing the disease
burden, broader efforts for prevention need to continue at the
population level. Furthermore, although these epidemio-
logic estimates of preventable cases could be a useful guide to
understanding the potential effect of intervention and life-
style change, ultimately evidence from randomized trials will
be needed to understand the true effect of an intervention for
the underlying population, as a whole or for subgroups.
Nonmodifiable risk factors were defined as those that can-
not be modified (eg, genetics) or that are unlikely to be modi-
fiedwiththeaimofreducingbreastcancerrisk.However,some
of these factors do have modifiable components (height, age
at menarche, and age at menopause are partially determined
bydietandbodysize).Alimitationofthisreportisthatwecould
not evaluate several known risk factors for breast cancer since
datawerenotavailableintheBPC3dataset.Theseincludelevel
of education, breastfeeding, physical activity, breast condi-
tions (such as mammographic density and benign breast dis-
ease), and endogenous hormone biomarkers (such as estra-
diol, testosterone, and prolactin levels).40 Further model
improvements could also be achieved by refining the risk fac-
torsincludedinthemodel(eg,changesinBMIsinceage18years
rather than current BMI). Our risk projections accounted for
expected changes in MHT use over time based on the popu-
lation distribution of length of use. However, our model as-
sumed that all other risk factors remained constant over the
time period of projected risk. Thus, the proportion of prevent-
able cases including all known modifiable risk factors could
be larger than reported here.
As information on all risk factors was not available in a
single large study, we developed the model using a combina-
tion of imputation (for risk factors that were available in BPC3
but had missing data) and simulation (for PRS associated with
68 SNPs not genotyped in BPC3). Use of imputation within
BPC3 allowed us to obtain more precise estimates of model
parameters than those that could be obtained had we ana-
lyzed patients with only complete data. Nevertheless, when
additional variation due to imputation was accounted for,
substantial uncertainty in estimates of OR parameters was
observed for several risk factors (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). In contrast, the use of simulation for 68 SNPs allowed
us to incorporate information on very precise estimates of
the OR parameters that are available from much larger case-
control studies. In principle, risk estimates can be biased
owing to the violation of the underlying assumption of mul-
tiplicative effect of SNPs and other risk factors, but for rea-
sons noted earlier herein, this scenario is unlikely. As inci-
dence density sampling was not followed in all studies, it is
also possible that there could be some bias due to the use of
ORs to estimate the hazard ratio parameters underlying the ab-
solute risk model (eMethods in the Supplement). The effects
of different types of biases owing to various modeling assump-
tions need to be examined in future validation studies.
Our analysis also has several strengths, including the
development of a model for relative risks based on a large case-
control sample drawn from prospective cohort studies, the
incorporation of information on cancer rate and risk factor dis-
tributions from nationally representative databases, and the
use of novel methodologic framework for assessment of risk
stratification. Future studies are needed to evaluate the value
ofincorporatingadditionalinformationonfactorsintoamodel.
Although our model assumptions are supported by analyses
of very large sets of data, this model, as well as future exten-
sions (eg, including more SNPs and other risk factors), need
to be validated in independent prospective cohort studies. A
more precise estimate of risk parameters associated with some
of the epidemiologic risk factors could be used to reduce un-
certainty in the estimates of risk that are produced by the
model.

Conclusions
Our results illustrate the potential value of risk stratification
to improve breast cancer prevention, particularly to aid
decisions on risk factor modification at the individual
level. The effect of such models for improving the
cost-benefit ratio of population-based prevention pro-
grams will depend on the implementation cost of risk
assessment.
