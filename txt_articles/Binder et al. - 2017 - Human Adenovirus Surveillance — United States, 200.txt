Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are nonenveloped, double-
stranded DNA viruses in the family Adenoviridae; seven species 
(A–G) and >60 genotypes are known to cause human infection 
(1). Clinical manifestations associated with HAdV infection 
include fever, acute respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, and con-
junctivitis. HAdV infection can be severe, particularly among 
immunocompromised patients, and can cause respiratory failure, 
disseminated infection, hemorrhagic cystitis, neurologic disease, 
and death (1,2). Illness tends to occur sporadically and without 
demonstrated seasonality. Outbreaks of HAdV have been reported 
globally in communities (3), and in closed or crowded settings, 
including dormitories, health care settings, and among military 
recruits, for whom a vaccine against HAdV type 4 (HAdV-4) 
and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) has been developed (4,5). CDC 
summarized HAdV detections voluntarily reported through the 
National Adenovirus Type Reporting System (NATRS) after 
initiation of surveillance in 2014 to describe trends in reported 
HAdVs circulating in the United States. Reporting laboratories 
were also encouraged to report available results for specimens col-
lected before surveillance began. Overall, the number of reporting 
laboratories and HAdV type identifications reported to NATRS 
has increased substantially from the start of official reporting in 
2014 through 2016; this report describes specimens collected dur-
ing 2003–2016. The most commonly reported HAdV types were 
HAdV type 3 (HAdV-3) and HAdV type 2 (HAdV-2), although 
HAdV types reported fluctuated considerably from year to year. 
In the United States, information on recently circulating HAdV 
types is needed to inform diagnostic and surveillance activities by 
clinicians and public health practitioners. Routine reporting to 
NATRS by all U.S. laboratories with the capacity to type HAdVs 
could help strengthen this surveillance system.
NATRS is a passive laboratory-based surveillance system initi-
ated in 2014 to coordinate reporting of laboratory identifications 
of HAdV types in the United States. Traditional typing tech-
niques based on serologic methods have been largely replaced by 
molecular typing techniques including sequencing and conven-
tional or real-time polymerase chain reaction, which can rapidly 
determine HAdV types. However, the number of public health 
and clinical laboratories with the capacity to type HAdVs using 
molecular techniques remains limited, and traditional methods 
are labor intensive and time consuming. Commercial molecular 
assays are more readily available; although some of these assays 
determine species, they do not identify specific types. Public 
health and clinical laboratories without the capacity to type 
HAdVs can send specimens of public health or clinical impor-
tance to CDC’s Respiratory Virus Diagnostics Laboratory. All 
participating laboratories are encouraged to report HAdV typing 
data quarterly to NATRS accompanied by limited demographic, 
clinical, and laboratory data.
Eleven laboratories reported data to NATRS during 2014–
2016, including the CDC Respiratory Virus Diagnostics 
Laboratory, public health laboratories from seven states, two 
clinical laboratories, and one U.S. Department of Defense 
laboratory. Data with specimen-collection years 2003–2013 
represent retrospective data from reporting laboratories with 
the capacity to test and type before surveillance formally began 
in 2014. All typing data for specimens collected during 2003–
2007 was provided by the CDC Respiratory Virus Diagnostics 
Laboratory. Five laboratories, including the CDC Respiratory 
Virus Diagnostics Laboratory, provided data for typed detec-
tions among specimens collected during 2008–2013 (rang-
ing from two laboratories in 2008 to five in 2013). NATRS 
received reports for 2,138 HAdV detections among specimens 
collected during 2003–2016. Species and type were reported 
for 2,107 (98.6%) and 1,497 (70.0%) detections, respectively, 
representing 22 types (Table 1) from 32 states and the U.S.

Virgin Islands, according to patient state of residence. The most 
commonly reported specimen types were respiratory specimens 
(N = 1,227; 82.0%), ocular swabs (61; 4.1%), and stool or 
rectal swabs (35; 1.8%). Species C (N = 683; 41%) and B (657; 
40%) were the most commonly reported species during the 
13-year period. The number of typed HAdV identifications 
reported by year of specimen collection ranged from two in 
2003 to 269 in 2014 when data collection began and increased 
to 362 in 2016. HAdV-3 (N = 341; 22.8%), HAdV-2 (293; 
19.6%), HAdV type 1 (HAdV-1) (248; 16.6%), HAdV-4 (185; 
12.4%), HAdV-7 (127; 8.5%), and HAdV type 14 (HAdV-14) 
(89; 5.9%) accounted for 1,283 (85.5%) of the 1,497 reports 
with type identified (Figure) (Table 1). A single type was 
identified in 1,490 (99.5%) specimens, whereas detection of 
two types was identified in seven (0.5%) specimens. Year-to-
year fluctuations in circulating types were evaluated using data 
reported during 2014–2016. HAdV-3, HAdV-2, HAdV-1, and 
HAdV-4 were among the most common types identified each 
year during this period; however, the frequency with which 
individual types were reported varied considerably from year to 
year (Table 2). The most commonly reported typing methods 
included serum neutralization (N = 591; 39.5%), full or partial 
genome sequencing (567; 37.9%), and real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (285; 19.0%).
Discussion
Type-based HAdV surveillance in the United States has three 
objectives: 1) to monitor patterns of circulation for HAdV 
types over time; 2) to assist with recognition and confirma-
tion of outbreaks associated with circulating types; and 3) to 
inform development or use of diagnostics tests, therapeutics, 
and vaccines. After initiation of NATRS in 2014, this is the 
first report describing national trends in HAdV type circulation 
in the United States, and fluctuations in frequency of HAdV 
types during 2014–2016.
During 2003–2016, the six most commonly reported types 
were HAdV-3, HAdV-2, HAdV-1, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and 
HAdV-14, which have all been detected in association with 
acute respiratory illness worldwide (2). HAdV-7 was recognized 
in the United States as an important cause of severe respiratory 
illness among adults in a community outbreak in Oregon in 
2014 (3). Nearly half of HAdV-7 detections (n = 62; 48.8%)

† Data not reported.
in NATRS occurred during 2014 (Table 2) as a result of 
sampling and typing of specimens collected as part of the 
Oregon outbreak investigation. Before 2014, HAdV-7 
was uncommonly reported among civilian populations, 
although respiratory illness outbreaks had been reported 
among military recruits (6). Respiratory illness associated 
with HAdV-4 also has been well documented among mili-
tary recruits, but has been less commonly reported among 
civilian populations (7).
A live, oral vaccine against HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 was 
given to all U.S. military members from 1971 to 1999. After 
depletion of the vaccine in 1999, HAdV-4 reemerged as the 
main cause of febrile respiratory illness among military ser-
vice members, especially among those in initial entry (i.e., 
basic) training. Subsequent reintroduction of HAdV-4 and 
HAdV-7 vaccine at all U.S. initial entry training sites in late 
2011 led to declines in overall rates of respiratory illness and 
in incidence of adenovirus infections(8,9). The prevalence of 
respiratory illness associated with HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 in 
non-military congregate populations that might potentially 
benefit from HAdV vaccination is not known.
Other common HAdV types reported to NATRS include 
HAdV-14, which was first documented in North American 
military populations in 2006 (2,10). After HAdV-4 and 
HAdV-7 vaccine re-introduction in 2011, HAdV-14 
surpassed HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 as the most prevalent HAdV 
type reported in these settings, although the actual number of 
cases of HAdV-14 did not increase (8). By 2007, outbreaks 
of respiratory illness because of HAdV-14 in multiple civil-
ian populations were also documented (4). Among the 89 
HAdV-14 detections reported to NATRS during 2003–2016, 
the highest number (25) and percentage (28.1%) were 
reported during 2007, likely coinciding with specimens col-
lected during documented outbreaks of HAdV-14 among 
community and military populations and in health care 
settings in certain states during this period.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, NATRS is a passive system that relies on voluntary 
participation from laboratories, and data might be biased by 
outbreak investigations and nonrandom sample selection for 
typing; therefore, types reported might not be representative 
of the HAdV types circulating nationally or regionally. Second, 
NATRS collects limited clinical information, restricting the 
interpretation of trends in HAdV disease associated with cir-
culating types. Third, although quarterly reporting to NATRS 
is encouraged and allows for retrospective outbreak documen-
tation, not all participating laboratories submit timely data, 
limiting the ability to detect outbreaks of HAdVs in real-time. 
Finally, although the number of laboratories with the capac-
ity to test for specific HAdV types and report to NATRS is

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) can cause a wide spectrum of 
clinical illness, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe 
illnesses and death. Approximately 60 HAdV genotypes have 
been identified to date, and they are associated with different 
clinical illnesses, including respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, 
and conjunctivitis. Surveillance for circulating HAdV types in the 
United States is passive and voluntary but might be useful to 
inform diagnostic and surveillance activities by clinicians and 
public health practitioners.
What is added by this report?
Based on data from the National Adenovirus Type Reporting 
System, the most commonly reported types of HAdVs during 
2003–2016 in the United States were HAdV types 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 
and 14, which accounted for 85.5% (n = 1,283) of all types 
reported. Year-to-year fluctuations in HAdV types circulating in 
the United States varied considerably, likely reflecting increases 
in testing in response to recognized HAdV outbreaks.
What are the implications for public health practice?
HAdV type-based surveillance data can be used to determine 
patterns of circulation for individual HAdV types in the United 
States, assist with the recognition and documentation of 
outbreaks associated with circulating types, and guide develop-
ment of new diagnostic tests, therapeutics, and vaccines.
increasing, the relatively small number of reporters limits the 
reliability and generalizability of these results.
NATRS monitors patterns of HAdV circulation in the 
United States based on voluntary laboratory reporting of 
detections by type. Understanding currently circulating HAdV 
types and improving the reliability and generalizability of 
surveillance data relies upon voluntary reports to NATRS 
from public health and clinical laboratories. The long-term 
sustainability of NATRS depends on building and maintaining 
the capacity to identify and type HAdVs among public health 
and clinical laboratories; improving timeliness of reporting by 
currently participating laboratories; and increasing the number 
of participating laboratories.
