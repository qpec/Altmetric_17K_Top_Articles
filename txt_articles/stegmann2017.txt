In plants, perception of invading pathogens involves cell-surface immune receptor kinases.
Here, we report that the Arabidopsis SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P) cleaves endogenous RAPID
ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) propeptides to inhibit plant immunity. This inhibition is
mediated by the malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), which otherwise facilitates
the ligand-induced complex formation of the immune receptor kinases EF-TU RECEPTOR
(EFR) and FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) with their co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID
INSENSITIVE 1–ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) to initiate immune signaling. We show that
FER acts as a RALF-regulated scaffold that modulates receptor kinase complex assembly.
A similar scaffolding mechanism may underlie FER function in other signaling pathways.
P
lant immune pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) are often receptor kinases (1). The
Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis)
receptor kinases FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2
(FLS2) and EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) bind
bacterial flagellin (or the epitope flg22) and EF-Tu
(or the epitopes elf18/elf24), respectively, and form
ligand-induced complexes with their co-receptor
BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1–ASSOCIATED
KINASE 1 (BAK1) (1).
To decipher the negative regulation of plant
PRR-mediated immune signaling, we screened
for modifier of bak1-5 (mob) mutants that regain
immune responses in the immunodeficient mu-
tant background bak1-5 (2). Here, we report the
characterization of MOB6.
bak1-5 is impaired in the production of re-
active oxygen species (ROS) upon flg22 or elf18
treatment (3). We identified the recessive bak1-5
mob6 mutant on the basis of restoration of this
response (fig. S1A). To map the mob6 locus, we
sequenced bulked F2 segregants from a back-
cross between bak1-5 mob6 and bak1-5 combined
with phenotypic and genetic analysis of an F2
population from a cross between bak1-5 mob6
and Col-0 [see the supplementary materials (SM)].
Wefoundahomozygousmissensemutation[where
Ser replaces Pro612 (P612S)] in At5g19660 encod-
ing the subtilase SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P)/SBT6.1
(fig. S1, B and C). Allelism tests and transcomple-
mentation assays confirmed that the mob6 phe-
notype is caused by a mutation in S1P (fig. S1, D
and E). We thus renamed mob6 as s1p-6.
We characterized the effect of mutant S1P al-
leles on immune signaling. s1p-3 and s1p-6 single
mutants produced more ROS in response to elf18,
flg22, and chitin (fig. S1, D and E; fig. S2A; and fig.
S3) and exhibited increased expression of the im-
mune marker genes FRK1 and PHI1 upon elf18
treatment (fig. S2B). Also, s1p-3 and s1p-6 mutants
were more resistant to the hypovirulent bacterium
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pto) DC3000
coronatine-minus (COR–) strain (fig. S2C). Thus,
S1P is a negative regulator of immunity.
Similar to its human ortholog, the Arabidopsis
subtilase S1P processes substrates with the canon-
ical cleavage site RxxL/RxLx (where R is arginine,
L is leucine, and x is any amino acid) (4). The
endogenous peptide RAPID ALKALINIZATION
FACTOR 23 (RALF23; At3g16570)—an established
S1P substrate in Arabidopsis (5)—is a major hub
in a flg22-regulated transcriptional network (6).
Consistent with a potential role of RALF23 in im-
munity, elf18 treatment or inoculation with the
type III–deficient strain Pto DC3000 hrcC– rap-
idly increased the processing of the propeptide
PRORALF23(fig.S4,AandB),inanS1P-dependent
manner (fig. S4C).
RALF23 treatment led to a dose-dependent
inhibitionofelf18-inducedROSproduction[median
inhibitory concentration (IC50) ~ 200 nM] (Fig. 1A
and fig. S5) and resistance to Pto DC3000 (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, RALF23 overexpression (7) inhibited
elf18-triggered ROS production and increased
susceptibility to Pto DC3000 COR– (Fig. 1, C and
D) and to the fungus Plectosphaerella cucu-
merina (7). Conversely, loss of RALF23 (fig. S6A)
led to increased elf18-triggered ROS production
(Fig. 1E) and resistance to Pto DC3000 COR–
(Fig.1F). RALF23 similarlyinhibitedflg22-triggered
ROS production (fig. S7). Furthermore, treatment
with RALF23 suppressed the heightened elf18-
induced ROS production in s1p-6 mutants (fig.
S8), which suggests that the negative regulatory
function of S1P is executed by the processing of

 RALF23 or related peptides. For example, the
closely related RALF33 (At4g15800) peptide (figs.
S9A and S10A) (8, 9) could also inhibit elf18-
induced ROS production (figs. S6B; S9, B and C;
and S10B). We conclude that RALF23, as well as
RALF33, negatively regulates immunity.
The Arabidopsis genome encodes about 35
RALF peptides (8, 9). Only 11 RALFs (including
RALF23 and RALF33) display a S1P cleavage site
(fig. S10A). Cotreatment with RALF34 (contain-
ing a predicted S1P cleavage site) inhibited
elf18-induced ROS burst to the same extent
as RALF23 and RALF33, whereas RALF32 (lack-
ing a predicted S1P cleavage site) did not (fig.
S10B). This suggests that S1P-cleaved RALFs
inhibit immunity. RALF23, RALF33, and the more
divergent RALF32 triggered seedling growth inhi-
bition (fig. S10C) in a way similar to RALF1 (9).
However, RALF32 does not affect elf18-triggered
ROS production (fig. S10B). All RALF peptides
previously tested induced alkalinization (8, 10),
suggesting that immune inhibition is not a gen-
eral property of RALFs and is independent of the
alkalinization activity, which is consistent with
our bioassays involving RALF peptides being per-
formed under buffered conditions (SM).
The Arabidopsis malectin-like receptor kinase
FERONIA (FER; At3g51550) was recently identi-
fied as a receptor for RALF1 (9). RALF1, RALF23,
and RALF33 are closely related (fig. S9A and S10A)
and have overlapping gene expression patterns
with FER (fig. S11) (8, 9). fer-2 and fer-4 mutants
were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of RALF23
or RALF33 peptide on elf18-induced ROS produc-
tion (Fig. 2A and fig. S12A), which was comple-
mented in a fer-4/FER–GREEN FLUORESCENT
PROTEIN (fer-4/FER-GFP) line (Fig. 2A). Fur-
thermore, RALF23 overexpression in fer-2 had no
effect on elf18-induced ROS production (fig. S12B).
The genetic dependence of FER in RALF23-,
RALF33-, and RALF32-triggered growth inhi-
bition (fig. S10C) suggested that FER may bind
additional RALF peptides.
Biotinylated RALF23 bound to recombinant
FER ectodomain (ectoFER) but not the unrelated
EFR receptor ectodomain (ectoEFR) (Fig. 2B).
Similarly, ectoFER expressed and purified from
insect cells bound to biotin-RALF23 but not biotin-
elf24 (Fig. 2C), with dissociation constant (Kd)
values ~300 nM and ~600 to 900 nM, as re-
vealed by microscale thermophoresis and iso-
thermal titration calorimetry, respectively (Fig. 2D
and fig. S13), which is consistent with values
reported for other ligand-receptor kinase pairs
(11, 12) and the IC50 for RALF23-mediated inhi-
bition of elf18-triggered ROS production (fig. S5).
Thus, in addition to RALF1 (9), FER is also a re-
ceptor for RALF23.
FER is enriched in detergent-resistant mem-
branes after flg22 treatment (13). The fer-2 and
fer-4 mutants were hyposensitive to elf18, flg22,
and chitin (Figs. 2A and 3A and figs. S12 and
S14) and were more susceptible to Pto DC3000
COR– (Fig. 3B), indicating that FER can also
positively regulate immunity. FER weakly asso-
ciates with both FLS2 and BAK1, with the latter
being strongly enhanced upon flg22 treatment
(Fig. 3C). Flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 complex for-
mation was reduced in fer-4 and restored in fer-4/
FER-GFP (Fig. 3D). Cotreatment with RALF23
reduced ligand-induced FLS2/EFR-BAK1 com-
plex formation (Fig. 3, E and F). RALF23 over-
expression had a similar effect on flg22-induced

 FLS2-BAK1 complex formation (fig. S15). RALF23
or the loss of FER did not affect accumulation of
FLS2, EFR, or BAK1 (Fig. 3, D to F, and fig. S15).
Thus, ligand-induced complex formation between
FLS2/EFR and their co-receptor BAK1 is pro-
moted by FER and inhibited by RALF23.
Our data suggest that FER acts as a scaffold
to regulate immune receptor–complex formation.
FER may reside in plasma membrane micro-
domains as part of preformed signaling “plat-
forms,” together with receptors and co-receptors.
Whether FER-mediated regulation intersects with
other regulators of FLS2/EFR-BAK1 complex for-
mation, such as BIR2 and IOS1 (14, 15), will be
an interesting topic for future investigation.
Two-thirds of RALF proteins lack a predicted
S1P cleavage site and are devoid of a propeptide
region (fig. S10A). Treatment with one of these,
RALF17, induced ROS production and acted ad-
ditively to elf18 (fig. S16, A and B). RALF17 pre-
treatment was also sufficient to induce resistance
to Pto DC3000 (fig. S16C). As RALF17-induced
ROS production is dependent on FER (fig. S16B),
the activity is not caused by a possible contam-
ination with synthetic peptides (e.g., flg22 or elf18)
used in our laboratory.
PRORALF23 is processed by S1P within min-
utes of elicitor perception (fig. S4), which sug-
gests a negative-feedback mechanism to inhibit
the scaffolding function of FER and to dampen
immune signaling. Fungal pathogens secrete pep-
tides with homology to RALF23 (16, 17); these
fungal RALF orthologs may suppress immunity
by inhibiting the formation of active receptor
complexes.
FER has emerged as a regulator of many
biological processes, ranging from fertilization
to inhibition of cell elongation and growth (18).
Many of these processes involve receptor kinases
and co-receptors (19). This suggests that FER
may have a similar scaffolding function within
other receptor kinase complexes. Different, but
overlapping, expression patterns of FER and RALF
genes (fig. S11) (9, 20) suggest that a variety of
FER-RALF modules may regulate diverse recep-
tor kinase complexes during growth, development,
or environmental sensing.
