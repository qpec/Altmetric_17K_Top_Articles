IMPORTANCE Low mobility is common during hospitalization and associated with loss or
declines in ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and limitations in community
mobility.
OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of an in-hospital mobility program (MP) on
posthospitalization function and community mobility.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-blind randomized clinical trial used masked
assessors to compare a MP with usual care (UC). Patients admitted to the medical wards of the
Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center from January 12, 2010, through June 29, 2011,
were followed up throughout hospitalization with 1-month posthospitalization telephone
follow-up. One hundred hospitalized patients 65 years or older were randomly assigned to the
MP or UC groups. Patients were cognitively intact and able to walk 2 weeks before
hospitalization. Data analysis was performed from November 21, 2012, to March 14, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients in the MP group were assisted with ambulation up to twice daily,
and a behavioral strategy was used to encourage mobility. Patients in the UC group received
twice-daily visits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in self-reported ADL and community mobility
were assessed using the Katz ADL scale and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Study
of Aging Life-Space Assessment (LSA), respectively. The LSA measures community mobility
based on the distance through which a person reports moving during the preceding 4 weeks.
RESULTS Of 100 patients, 8 did not complete the study (6 in the MP group and 2 in the UC
group). Patients (mean age, 73.9 years; 97 male [97.0%]; and 19 black [19.0%]) had a median
length of stay of 3 days. No significant differences were found between groups at baseline.
For all periods, groups were similar in ability to perform ADL; however, at 1-month after
hospitalization, the LSA score was significantly higher in the MP (LSA score, 52.5)
compared with the UC group (LSA score, 41.6) (P = .02). For the MP group, the 1-month
posthospitalization LSA score was similar to the LSA score measured at admission. For the UC
group, the LSA score decreased by approximately 10 points.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A simple MP intervention had no effect on ADL function.
However, the MP intervention enabled patients to maintain their prehospitalization
community mobility, whereas those in the UC group experienced clinically significant
declines. Lower life-space mobility is associated with increased risk of death, nursing home
admission, and functional decline, suggesting that declines such as those observed in the UC
group would be of great clinical importance.

ospitalization among older adults is associated with
functional loss, including declines in ability to per-
form activities of daily living (ADL) and limitations in
community mobility.1-7 Approximately 40% of older adults ex-
perience a decline in the ability to perform ADL, with one-
third failing to recover within a year after discharge.6 The ef-
fect of hospitalization on community mobility may be even
more concerning. Among a cohort of community-living older
adults, hospitalization for a nonsurgical indication was asso-
ciated with a clinically significant decline in community mo-
bility with little evidence of recovery after up to 2 years of
follow-up.7
Low mobility, defined as being limited to a bed or chair, is
alsocommonduringhospitalizationandisassociatedwithade-
cline in the ability to perform ADL and the need for new nurs-
ing home admission, even after controlling for illness severity
and comorbidity.8 Although the mean length of stay for older
adults is only 5.5 days,9 the low mobility that occurs may con-
tribute to the functional decline observed at hospital dis-
charge given the added potential effect of illness and
inflammation.10-13 One study13 found decreases in all func-
tionalcapacityparameters,includingstrength,pulmonaryfunc-
tion, and submaximal exercise tolerance, after 5 days of hospi-
talizationinacohortofpatientsnotrestrictedtobed.Thus,older
adults who experience low mobility during hospitalization are

function, which may lead to long-term mobility disability.14
Although a number of cohort studies15-17 have found the
potential beneficial effects of hospital mobility, no studies to
date have used a randomized clinical trial design to deter-
mine the effect of a hospital mobility program in a general
medical population.18 The purpose of this study is to exam-
ine the effect of an in-hospital mobility program (MP) on post-
hospitalization function and community mobility 1 month
after discharge among a cohort of older adults hospitalized for
medical illness.
Methods
Participants
Participantswere100patients65yearsorolderadmittedtothe
medicalwardsoftheBirminghamVeteransAffairsMedicalCen-
ter(BVAMC)fromJanuary12,2010,throughJune29,2011,who
were analyzed with intent to treat. Data analysis was per-
formed from November 21, 2012, to March 14, 2016. The wards
did not use any geriatric-specific programs, such as the Hos-
pitalElderLifeProgram,19atthetimeofthisstudy.Patientswere
identified Monday through Friday, and a trained research as-
sistant performed a brief screening interview with the physi-
ciantoestablishkeyinclusioncriteria,includingageof65years
or older, having a medical (vs surgical) reason for admission,
and not being imminently terminal (death expected in the next
30 days). Common admission diagnoses included pneumo-
nia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbations.Thepresenceofdeliriumordementiawasevalu-
ated using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)20 and the
Mini-Cognitive Assessment (Mini-Cog),21,22 respectively. In-
clusion criteria were having a negative screening result for cog-
nitive impairment (Mini-Cog score, ≥3), not being delirious
(CAM score, 0), self-report of being ambulatory with or with-
outanassistivedeviceinthe2weeksbeforeadmission,nothav-
ing a significant language barrier that required a translator, and
not previously enrolled in the study. The institutional review
board of the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center ap-
provedtheinformedconsentformsandallstudyprotocols.The
trial protocol can be found in the Supplement. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants.
Eight patients did not complete the study. During hospi-
talization, among MP participants, 3 were transferred to the
intensive care unit (ICU), 1 became delirious, and 1 died,
whereas 1 usual care (UC) participant withdrew consent. Pa-
tientswhoweretransferredtotheICUorbecamedeliriouswere
withdrawn from the study and received no further interven-
tion. Two patients died before the 1-month follow-up tele-
phone call (1 from each group). A priori, on the basis of previ-
ous work,10 we determined that a sample size of 45 per group
provided 90% power to detect a 2-hour difference in time
spend out of bed at the α = .05 level. A study flow diagram is
provided in the Figure.
Assessments
Participants completed assessments before randomization to
document demographics, functional status, mobility, and co-
morbidities. Experienced clinical researchers who under-
went intensive training and interrater reliability assessments
conducted the initial assessments. After randomization, as-
sessments were completed throughout the hospitalization by
a separate group of masked assessors. Approximately 4 weeks
after discharge, all patients were contacted by telephone and
asked to self-report on their function and mobility.
Functional Outcome Assessment
Participants were asked at baseline to rate their ability to per-
form basic ADLs (bathing, dressing, feeding, toileting, groom-
ing, transferring, and walking) on admission and retrospec-
tively for the 2 weeks before admission. This assessment was
repeated at hospital discharge and by telephone 1 month af-
ter discharge. For each ADL, participants were asked whether

they were independent, required some assistance, or re-
quired total assistance, and a summary score was created. The
ADL summary score ranged from 7 (independent for each ADL)
to 21 (required total assistance for each ADL).23
Community Mobility Assessment
At baseline and 1 month after hospital discharge, the Univer-
sity of Alabama at Birmingham Life-Space Assessment (LSA)
was completed. The LSA is a tool that measures community
mobility based on the distance through which a person re-
ports moving during the 4 weeks that precede the assess-
ment.24,25 Life-space levels range from within one’
s bedroom
to beyond one’
s town. A life-space composite score is calcu-
lated based on level, degree of independence in achieving each
level, and frequency of attaining each level. Life-space com-
posite scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores repre-
senting greater mobility.24 The LSA test-retest reliability had
an interclass correlation of 0.96.
Frequency and independence of movement were incor-
porated into the LSA to capture important changes in mobil-
ity not captured by other assessments. The LSA has been
validated as an important clinical measure of community
mobility, predicting death, nursing home admissions, and
hospitalization in some populations and reflecting important
changes in mobility after hospitalizations.7,26-28
Hospital Mobility Assessment
Our initial trial registration described time out of bed using ac-
celerometers as our primary outcome.29 However, technical
failures in this measure precluded use of accelerometer data.
Therefore, this report focuses on outcomes from other aims
in the protocol.
Sociodemographic Variables
Age was abstracted from the patient’
s medical records. Sex
and race were self-reported and classified based on self-
report. Options for race were not defined by the investigator.
Race was assessed to ensure that results included an appro-
priate distribution.
Cognitive Assessments
Before informed consent was obtained, the presence of de-
lirium and dementia was evaluated using the CAM20 and
Mini-Cog,21,22 respectively. The CAM allows rapid assess-
ment of the presence of delirium.20 The Mini-Cog is a brief cog-
nitive screening measure that includes a 3-item memory re-
call and a clock drawing test.21,22 This test has sensitivity and
specificitysimilartotheMini-MentalStateExamination.30The
research assistants also used the CAM at each patient visit
throughout the hospital stay to ensure that patients in either
group did not develop incident delirium.
On study admission, participants were screened for de-
pression using the Geriatrics Depression Scale Short Form, a
15-item screening tool used to assess for the presence of
depression.31,32 A score greater than 5 is considered a positive
screening result.
Daily 24-Hour Fall Reporting
During the hospital stay, patients were asked to provide a daily
24-hour fall report.
Medical Records Data
Medical records were abstracted for hospital length of stay, in-
formation to determine the Charlson comorbidity index,33 and
illness severity using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
EvaluationII.34Dataregardingordersforphysicaltherapywere
also collected.
Intervention
After completion of the baseline assessments, patients were
randomized to the MP or UC group using a block randomiza-
tion strategy where for every block of 10, a total of 5 were al-
located to each study arm. To achieve allocation conceal-
ment, sequentially sealed envelopes with assignments based
on the randomization schedule were used. All members of the
research team who transferred and walked with patients re-
ceived in-depth training in safe patient handling techniques
by BVAMC physical therapists. Proficiency and competency
were documented using objective standards.
Hospital MP
A standard hospital mobility protocol was developed in which
MPparticipantsbeganwithassistedsitting,thenstanding,pro-
gressing to weight shifting, stepping in place, and then ambu-
lation as tolerated with the assistance of the research assis-
tant. A rolling walker was provided if needed. Gait belts were
used to ensure safe ambulation. The MP patients were seen up

to twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes each session 7 days a week.
Although the MP patients were encouraged to walk at each ses-
sion, they could refuse any or all sessions. The research assis-
tantattemptedtomakeatleast3visitsforeachscheduledwalk.
If a patient was away at a test or busy with another health care
professional, the research assistant returned at a later time to
walk with the patient.
Behavioral Intervention Integration to the MP
In addition to assistance with walking, a behavioral interven-
tion strategy was integrated to encourage MP patients to
increase time spent out of bed. The goal was to encourage
additional activity (outside provided walks) through use of
an out-of-bed protocol based on social cognitive theory.
Social cognitive therapy explains human behavior in terms of
a dynamic, 3-way interaction among personal factors, envi-
ronmental influences, and behavior.35 A basic premise of
social cognitive therapy is that people learn not only through
their own experience but also through observing the actions
of others and the result of those actions.
The level of out-of-bed activity was dependent on the in-
dividual patient and incorporated activities patients were
deemed able to do independent of cueing or assistance dur-
ing each walking session. For example, if a patient could stand
at the bedside independently but required standby assis-
tance for walking, he or she would be encouraged to sit on the
side of the bed and stand for 3 to 5 minutes every 2 hours as
able. The patient would be instructed not to attempt to walk
without nursing assistance. To reinforce this behavior, the pa-
tientandresearchassistantsetdailygoalsregardingtheamount
of time the patient would try to spend out of bed. To assist in
self-monitoring of out-of-bed mobility, the MP patients were
providedwithadiarythatcouldbeusedtodocumenteachtime
they sat up or walked. This diary was used by the research as-
sistants to reinforce positive behavior and to set goals for the
following day.
Inadditiontogoalsetting,patientswereencouragedtodis-
cuss any barriers to mobility they were experiencing. Using an
interview guide, the research assistant asked about mobility
challenges and prompted patients to develop potential solu-
tionstothesechallenges.Forexample,ifthepatientnotedpain
as a mobility challenge, the patient would be prompted for po-
tential solutions. If the patient was unable to verbalize any so-
lutions, the research assistant would suggest talking with the
physician or nurse or using distraction techniques to reduce
the challenge.
Usual Care
TheUCpatientsreceivedvisitsbytheresearchassistanttocon-
trol for the daily attention that MP patients receive. The visits
were approximately 15 to 20 minutes long and occurred up to
twice a day 7 days a week. The UC patients were provided with
a diary that looked identical to those for the MP patients; how-
ever, the UC group was asked to document frequency of visi-
tors, both family and health care professionals.
Physicians were able to order physical therapy services for
the MP and UC groups. This referral was neither encouraged
nor discouraged by the research team and did not affect the
number of visits the research assistant made to the patient. In-
formation was gathered from the medical record regarding fre-
quency of physical therapy referrals.
Statistical Analysis
We used t tests and χ2 tests to test for significant differences
between the MP and UC groups for continuous and categori-
cal variables, respectively. Because more patients in the MP
group (n = 6) than the UC group (n = 2) were withdrawn
because of death or ICU transfer before study end, there is the
potential for biased results. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis
was performed using 2 methods: (1) complete analysis with
the reduced sample (ie, those patients with available data)
and (2) multiple imputations (N = 25) using Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods that assumed an arbitrary missing pat-
tern for ADL and, separately, a monotone missing pattern for
LSA. We examined group differences in ADL and LSA at spe-
cific time points using multivariate linear regression. Other
covariates in multivariate models included age, race, and sex.
For comparisons from multiple imputations, regression coef-
ficients and their corresponding covariance matrices were
combined, and statistical inferences about the regression
model based on a t-distribution were generated. Mixed mod-
els were used to examine changes in ADL during 4 assessment
periods, between the MP and UC groups, and tested for the
presence of significant group-time interaction by including a
group-time product term in the model. Analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) was used to test for significant changes in LSA from
time of admission by including baseline admission values for
LSA in multivariate models. Other covariates included in mul-
tivariate models included age, race, and sex. Our use of mul-
tiple imputations for ADL and LSA was based on a missing at
random assumption (ie, an ignorable response mechanism)
and that missing values were not related to ADL or LSA.
Results
Characteristics of the study cohort are given in Table 1. Over-
all, the group had a mean (SD) age of 73.9 (6.96) years, 97
(97.0%) were male, and 19 (19.0%) were black. No significant
differences were found between the MP and UC groups for any
baseline characteristics. The mean (SD) length of stay was 4.06
(3.29) days, with a range of 1 to 21 days. When the 5 patients
who were withdrawn from the study because of ICU transfer,
delirium, or death were removed from analysis, the mean (SD)
length of stay was 3.6 (2.3) days. The mean (SD) baseline LSA
scores of the 5 withdrawn patients compared with the rest of
thecohortwere40.3(9.4)and53.3(25.9),respectively(P = .03).
Noothersignificantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenthosewho
were withdrawn and the rest of the cohort.
The MP group completed 122 of the potential 238 walks
(51.3%). Reasons for lack of completion included patient
refusal (45 [18.9%]), patient unavailable because of tests or
procedures (39 [16.4%]), staff not available (27 [11.3%]), and
other (5 [2%]). Although 45 walks were refused during the
study, 28 refusals (62.2%) came from 4 patients. Failure to
complete a walk with the research team did not preclude the

patient completing additional walks independently. For the
behavioral intervention component, which included goal set-
ting and discussion of mobility barriers, the MP group com-
pleted 108 of the 135 visits (80.0%). The UC group completed
184 of the 223 visits (82.5%).
To assess safety of the in-hospital MP, patients were asked
to provide a daily 24-hour fall report. The MP group reported
no falls, whereas 2 patients in the UC group had a total of 3 falls
while hospitalized.
Table 2 presents imputed estimates of mean self-
reported ADL by group for the 2 weeks before admission, at
admission, at discharge, and 1 month after hospitalization; in
addition, imputed estimates of mean LSA scores measured at
admission and 1-month after hospitalization are reported. For
all periods, groups were similar in their ability to perform ADL
(P = .62); furthermore, ability to perform ADL did not signifi-
cantly change over time (P = .77), and there were no signifi-
cant group-time interactions (P = .76). For LSA measured 1
monthafterhospitaldischarge,basedonreplacingmissingLSA
values with those derived from multiple imputation values,
mean (SD) significant differences were found in LSA scores for
the MP group (LSA score, 52.6 [4.39]) compared with the UC
group (LSA score, 41.8 [3.15]) (P = .02).
Results from the ANCOVA reveal that after adjustment for
baseline admission values and other covariates, the MP group
had a 10-point higher 1-month posthospitalization LSA score
compared with the UC group (P = .02) (Table 3). For the UC
group, the LSA score decreased by approximately 10 points
based on complete case analysis and imputation for missing
values. In both analyses, posthospitalization LSA differences
were significantly higher in the MP group compared with the
UC group. The sensitivity analysis suggests that missing val-
ues had little effect on group differences in LSA scores be-
cause results of complete case analysis were similar to those
derived from replacing missing data with imputed values.
Discussion
This study provides evidence that an easy-to-implement MP
that included offering assistance with ambulation twice a day
linked with a behavioral intervention that focused on goal set-
ting and addressing mobility barriers prevented loss of com-
munity mobility 1 month after hospital discharge. Those who
received UC experienced a clinically significant 10-point de-
crease in community mobility as measured by LSA. An ex-
ample of a 10-point decrease would be an older person who
previously reported no assistance to go into town 1 to 3 times
a week (LSA score, 64) but who now requires a cane to go into
town and goes less than once a week (LSA score, 54). In addi-
tion, the hospital mobility program appears to be safe, with 3
falls reported in the UC group but no falls reported in the MP
group.
The loss of community mobility observed among our UC
cohort is similar to findings from a cohort study of life-space
recovery after hospitalization among 1000 community-
dwelling older adults. That study found that patients with a
nonsurgical hospitalization, on average, experienced a simi-
lar 10.3-point (95% CI, −14.3 to −6.3) decrease in LSA score af-
ter adjustment for demographic covariates and ADL impair-
ments with little evidence of recovery even after up to 2 years
of follow-up.7 Lower life-space mobility is associated with
increased risk of death, nursing home admission, functional
decline, and cognitive impairment,24-28,36 suggesting that

declines such as those observed in the UC group would be of
great clinical importance.
Functional decline is common after hospitalization.1-7
Unlike prior studies1-6 of ADL decline, we did not observe a
significant change in ability to perform ADL after hospitaliza-
tion. However, study patients did not have dementia or
delirium, which may have affected our findings. In addition,
the study was not powered to see significant ADL changes.
In qualitative studies,37,38 concern regarding falls has been
raised as a barrier to mobility. However, this study found that
falls were more likely to occur in the UC than the MP group,
lending strength to the potential use of mobility as an inter-
vention to reduce hospital falls. In 1 prospective cohort study39
of an in-hospital fall prevention program, participants re-
ceived mobility-related interventions, including provision of
mobility devices, encouragement of early mobility, and fre-
quent toileting assistance. Falls were lowest in patients with
the highest mobility scores, but patients at all mobility levels
gained from the intervention. Further research is needed to
determinethepotentialefficacyofusingincreasedhospitalmo-
bility as a fall prevention tool.
A number of studies15,16,40,41 have examined the effect of
hospital mobility on in-hospital outcomes. Mundy et al40 com-
pared UC with early progressive mobilization in a cohort of pa-
tients with community-acquired pneumonia and found that
those who were mobilized early were able to leave the hospi-
tal sooner (adjusted absolute difference, 1.1 days; 95% CI, 0.0-
2.2 days) and had no significant differences in mortality rates,
emergency department visits, or subsequent hospitaliza-
tions. Preliminary results of a Veterans Affairs clinical dem-
onstration of a supervised walking program found a reduc-
tion in length of stay and a higher likelihood of discharge to
homeamongthosewhoparticipatedcomparedwiththosewho
declined.16 A nurse-driven mobility protocol found improve-
ment in Barthel index scores and a reduced length of stay
among study participants.15 There is additional evidence that
hospital patients who walk in the hallways at least daily are at
lower risk of ADL and instrumental ADL decline during and
after hospitalization.41
Although a number of studies15,16,40,41 have found the po-
tential beneficial effects of hospital mobility, this is the first,
to our knowledge, to use a randomized clinical trial design in
a cohort of general medical patients and to examine out-
comes beyond those occurring during hospitalization. In ad-
dition, the intervention is easy to implement and has the po-
tential to be incorporated into UC at any hospital. Specifically,
by focusing on a walking intervention with a behavioral com-
ponent that encourages out-of-bed mobility and goal setting,
the intervention does not require the specialized skills of a
physicaltherapistbutrathercanbedeliveredbyamobilityaide
or possibly by well-trained volunteers.
BecausethisstudywasperformedinaVeteransAffairshos-
pital with mostly male patients, it may not be generalizable.
In addition, study patients did not have dementia or de-
lirium, so the level of out-of-bed mobility may be higher than
thatseeninageneralmedicinepopulation.However,thisgroup
had a significant burden of comorbidities and was acutely ill,
as indicated by their comorbidity count and Acute Physiol-
ogy and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Although this is
a small study that needs replication, it provides evidence of
the safety and efficacy of a hospital mobility program.
Conclusions
A hospital MP that included assistance with ambulation and
a behavioral intervention to encourage mobility was safe and
effective. Patients in the MP group were less likely to experi-
ence a decline in community mobility when compared with
UC and were able to maintain their prehospitalization com-
munity mobility status. Currently, there is no standard of care
regarding mobility in hospitalized older adults. This study pro-
vides evidence of the positive effect of mobility during hos-
pitalization among older adults, although the findings re-
quire replication before large-scale implementation can be
recommended.
