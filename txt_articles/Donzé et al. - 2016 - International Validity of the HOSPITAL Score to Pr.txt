Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Identification of patients at high risk of potentially avoidable readmission 
allows hospitals to efficiently direct additional care transitions services to the patients most likely 
to benefit.
OBJECTIVE—To externally validate the “HOSPITAL” score in an international multicenter 
study to assess its generalizability.
DESIGN—International multicenter retrospective cohort study.
SETTING—9 large hospitals across 4 different countries.
PARTICIPANTS—All adult patients consecutively discharged alive from a medical department 
between January and December, 2011 (117,065 participants). Patients transferred to another acute 
care facility were excluded.
EXPOSURES—The “HOSPITAL” score includes the following predictors at discharge: 
Hemoglobin, discharge from an Oncology service, Sodium level, Procedure during the index 
admission, Index Type of admission (urgent), number of Admissions during the last 12 months, 
and Length of stay.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—30-day potentially avoidable readmission to the index 
hospital using the SQLape algorithm.
RESULTS—Of all medical discharges, 14.5% (n=16,992) were followed by a 30-day 
readmission, and 9.7% (n=11,307) were followed by a 30-day potentially avoidable readmission. 
The discriminatory power of the “HOSPITAL” score to predict potentially avoidable readmission 
was good with a C-statistic of 0.72 (95% CI 0.72-0.72). As in the derivation study, patients were 
classified into 3 risk categories: low (62%), intermediate (24%), and high risk (14%). The 
estimated proportions of potentially avoidable readmission for each risk category matched the 
observed proportion, resulting in an excellent calibration (Pearson goodness of fit test P=0.89).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The “HOSPITAL” score identified patients at high risk 
of 30-day potentially avoidable readmission with moderately high discrimination and excellent 
calibration when applied to a large international multicenter cohort of medical patients. This score 
has the potential to easily identify patients in need of more intensive transitional care interventions 
to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions.

 INTRODUCTION
Hospital readmissions are frequent, harmful and costly— 18% of Medicare patients can 
expect to be readmitted within 30 days in the US at a cost of more than 17 billion dollars.1 
Recent changes in healthcare policy aimed at reducing readmission have substantially 
increased attention to this major healthcare issue.
Although some readmissions are unavoidable, and the proportion of readmissions that are 
truly avoidable remains controversial, at least some appear to be preventable, therefore 
leaving room for improvement by hospitals and health care systems.2,3 A recent systematic 
review and meta-analysis showed a relative readmission risk reduction of 0.82 from 
transitions interventions (p<0.01), however the most effective interventions were of high 
complexity.4 In order to most efficiently reduce hospital readmissions, hospitals need to 
target complex and intensive discharge interventions at those patients at high risk of 
potentially avoidable readmission and therefore more likely to benefit. However, prior 
research indicates that clinical providers are not able to accurately identify which patients 
are at high risk for readmission.5
Prediction models may provide a more efficient and accurate means to identify those 
patients at highest risk. Unfortunately, most existing predictions models have yielded only 
fair discriminative ability, do not focus on readmissions that are avoidable, are not externally 
validated, or are not easy to use in practice.6 In response to these shortcomings, we 
previously derived and internally validated the “HOSPITAL” score consisting of 7 readily 
available clinical predictors (Table 1 lists components forming the acronym). This simple 
prediction model accurately identified patients at high risk of potentially avoidable 
readmissions among more than 10,000 medical inpatients,7 and is innovative in several 
ways: it focuses on 30-day readmissions that are potentially avoidable, shows good 
discrimination power to accurately differentiate low from high risk patients, includes only 
readily available predictors, and can be calculated before discharge.
Before wider application of the HOSPITAL score can be recommended, it is important to 
understand how the score performs in populations outside those from which the score was 
developed. To assess its generalizability, we aimed to externally validate the HOSPITAL 
score in a large international multicenter cohort of medical patients.
METHODS
Study design and participants
This multicenter multinational retrospective cohort study included all consecutive adult 
patients discharged alive between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 from the medical 
services of 9 hospitals in 4 different countries: the United States, Canada, Israel, and 
Switzerland (ICARE: International Cohort of Avoidable REadmissions). To minimize 
inclusion of observation stays, only hospitalizations with a length of stay of more than one 
day were included. We then excluded patients who were transferred to another acute 
healthcare facility (hospital or psychiatric hospital) or who left against medical advice.

 The participating centers were: 1) University of California San Francisco Medical Center, 
San Francisco, CA, USA; 2) Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 
USA; 3) Harborview Hospital Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; 4) 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; 5) Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA; 6) Christiana Hospital, Wilmington, DE, USA; 7) Sheba 
Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel; 8) William Osler Health System, Ontario, Canada; 9) 
Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland. Of these, 7 are University hospitals and 2 are 
community hospitals (Christiana Hospital and William Osler Health System). All are not-
for-profit hospitals.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each site and also of the 
managing site at Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Partners Healthcare, Boston, MA, USA. 
The study follows the criteria from the “Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction 
model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis” (TRIPOD) Initiative (checklist available upon 
request).8
Study outcome
First, all 30-day readmissions to any division of the same medical center were identified. 
The primary outcome of 30-day potentially avoidable readmission was then identified 
through the same process as in the derivation study, using the SQLape algorithm.7 This 
algorithm, based on administrative data and diagnosis codes, was initially developed in 
Switzerland and has been used there for now for more than 5 years for hospital 
benchmarking purposes.9-11 In summary, readmissions which are foreseeable are classified 
as unavoidable, including readmissions for transplantation, labour and delivery, chemo- or 
radiotherapy, follow-up or rehabilitation treatment, specific surgical procedures, or some 
specific diseases deemed difficult to cure (such as multiple sclerosis and idiopathic 
thrombocytopenia). Then, it classifies readmissions as unavoidable if they involve a new 
organ system unknown to be affected during the preceding hospitalization. Conversely, 
complications of treatment (e.g. deep vein thrombosis, catheter associated urinary tract 
infection, drug-induced disorders, etc.) were considered potentially avoidable.
The unit of analysis was the hospital discharge, and each admission could be considered as 
both an index hospitalization and a rehospitalization when several hospital stays occurred 
within an interval of less than 30 days.
Predictor Variables
Information on the 7 predictor variables included in the HOSPITAL score was collected at 
each site using the same definition as the derivation study (Table 1).7 HOSPITAL is the 
acronym for the 7 variables included in the score: last available Hemoglobin before 
discharge (positive if < 12 g/dl), discharge from an Oncology service, last available Sodium 
level before discharge (positive if < 135 mmol/L), any Procedure performed during the 
hospitalization (any International Classification of Disease [ICD-9 or -10] coded procedure), 
Index admission Type (emergent or urgent as opposed to elective), number of Admissions in 
the previous 12 months, and Length of stay (positive if ≥ 5 days). ICD procedures in medical 
patients included for example endoscopy, hemodialysis, heart cardiac catheter, paracentesis

 or thoracocenthesis, transfusion, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The scoring system ranges 
from 0 to a maximum of 13 points, with a risk of 30-day potentially avoidable readmission 
that increases with the number of points.
Due to the absence of patients with zero previous admissions in the last 12 months at 2 sites, 
patients with only one admission in the previous year were attributed 0 points instead of 1 as 
in the original score. Overall, 5.9% of hemoglobin values and 3.4% of sodium values were 
missing. The values were imputed as normal when missing (i.e. no points attributed for the 
missing variable). Other data collected included demographic information in order to 
describe the population.
Statistical analysis
Patients’ baseline characteristics were presented as proportions, means with standard 
deviation (SD), and as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate.
First, the HOSPITAL score was calculated for each hospital discharge. Then the risk for an 
admission to be followed by a 30-day potentially avoidable readmission was categorized into 
3 groups according to the total number of points: low risk if 0 to 4 points, intermediate risk 
if 5 to 6 points, and high risk if 7 or more points. These categories were created in the 
derivation study for ease of interpretation, roughly corresponding to 5%, 10%, and 20% risk 
of potentially avoidable readmission.
The score was evaluated according to its overall performance, its discriminatory power, and 
its calibration. We used the Brier score to quantify the overall performance, i.e. how close 
predictions are to the actual outcome.12,13 A useful prediction rule ought to have a Brier 
score smaller than 0.25 (the lower the better). The discriminatory power reflects the ability 
of the score to discriminate the cases from the non-cases based on both sensitivity and 
specificity (C-statistic).14,15 The calibration shows the ability of the model to generate 
probabilities that match the observed rates.13 We used the Pearson Goodness-of-fit test to 
summarize this measure, and presented both observed and predicted rates for each risk group 
of the score (P values ≥0.05 on this test imply good fit, with higher numbers signifying 
better fit).
Discharges followed by an unavoidable 30-day readmission (according to SQLape 
classification) were grouped with the discharges not followed by any 30-day readmission 
(group control) for the main analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, we also evaluated the 
performance of the HOSPITAL score when these unavoidable readmissions were completely 
excluded from the analysis.
All tests were conducted as two-sided at a 0.05 level of significance. In the logistic 
regression, we used a fixed effect for hospital to account for possible differences in 
outcomes across the 9 hospitals. We also used a robust sandwich variance estimator to 
account for repeated admissions from the same patient within hospital.16 Analyses were 
performed with SAS Software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

 RESULTS
During the study period, a total of 121,136 adults were discharged alive from the medical 
department of the 9 participating centers, and 117,065 (96.6%) discharges were included in 
the analysis (Figure 1). Within 30 days after discharge, 15.0% (n=17,516) of the medical 
patients had a readmission, and 9.7% (n=11,307) had a potentially avoidable readmission. 
The median time to readmission was 12.0 days (IQR 5;19). Baseline characteristics of 
patients are summarized in Table 2. Patients had a mean age of 60.8 years (SD 18.2), and 
had a median length of stay of 4 days (IQR 3;7). Overall, patients with a potentially 
avoidable readmission more often had an urgent or emergent index admission, were more 
frequently discharged from an oncology service, had a length of stay greater than 5 days, 
had more hospitalizations in the past year, more often had a procedure, and more often had a 
low hemoglobin or low sodium level at discharge. All these differences were highly 
statistically significant (P<0.001).
HOSPITAL score
The score ranged from 0 to 13, with a median HOSPITAL score of 4.0 (IQR 2;5). Using the 
HOSPITAL score, 62.4% of the patients were categorized as low risk, 23.6% as intermediate 
risk, and 14.0% as high risk for a potentially avoidable readmission. Risk of 30-day 
potentially avoidable readmission for patients with a HOSPITAL score in the low, 
intermediate, and high risk groups were 5.8%, 12.0%, and 22.8%, respectively.
Discriminatory power
We found that the HOSPITAL score had a C-statistic of 0.72 (95%CI 0.72-0.72), showing 
good discrimination. In US hospitals, the C-statistic was 0.72 (95%CI 0.71-0.72), in Canada 
0.78 (95%CI 0.76-0.80), in Israel 0.68 (0.67-0.69), and in Switzerland 0.68 (95%CI 
0.66-0.71). The Brier score was 0.08, signifying very good overall performance.
In a sensitivity analysis, excluding patients with unavoidable readmissions rather than 
combining them with patients without any readmissions did not significantly change the C-
statistic (C-statistic = 0.73 [95%CI 0.73-0.74]).
Calibration
In terms of calibration, the estimated risk of potentially avoidable readmission calculated 
with the HOSPITAL score matched the observed proportion of potentially avoidable 
readmissions in each risk group: 5.8% for the low risk group, 11.9% for the intermediate, 
and 22.8% for the high risk group (Table 3). This is also reflected by an excellent Pearson 
goodness of fit test with a P-value of 0.89. When calibration is analyzed for each individual 
point score, calibration remains excellent except at the extreme high and low ends of the 
range, zero points and 11 or more points, where sample size is limited (see eTable1). The 
positive likelihood ratio for each point score showed a similar pattern (see eTable2).

 DISCUSSION
In a large international multicenter external validation study, we found that the HOSPITAL 
score had good discriminative ability and excellent calibration for predicting the risk of 30-
day potentially avoidable readmission. The HOSPITAL score is easy-to-use and can be 
calculated before discharge, which makes it a practical tool for identification of patients at 
high risk for preventable readmission and the timely administration of high intensity 
interventions designed to improve transitions of care.
A recent systematic review comparing existing readmission scores pointed out the lack of 
validated, reliable, and generalizable score stratification models for readmission.6 Most 
scores developed to date have exhibited poor performance, lacked geographical validation, 
were developed using small sample size, or are complex. Among the most frequently cited 
score is the LACE score.17 Derived and validated in large populations in Ontario, Canada, 
the score showed a C-statistic of 0.68 in Ontario and 0.70 in an external validation study in 
Singapore.18 It has however never been validated in other countries, including the US. Also, 
it requires users to calculate another score, the Charlson comorbidity index, that estimates 
the 1-year mortality of the patient based on billing coded comorbidities, practically available 
only after discharge.
In comparison, the HOSPITAL score applies 7 readily available predictors. Importantly, it 
can be calculated before the discharge of the patient, in time for interventions to be started in 
the hospital. It showed good performance in this large international multicenter study, which 
is to our knowledge the first prediction model for readmission to be so widely validated 
across an international cohort of patients and one of the few that follows current 
methodological recommendations.19 The size of the validation cohort is also one of the 
largest. Moreover, the HOSPITAL score was designed specifically to focus on readmissions 
that are potentially avoidable, i.e., those that are theoretically most likely to benefit from 
interventions. This is of critical importance as hospitals and health systems face decisions 
about how to best deploy limited resources, yet there has been a dearth of such tools.20 In a 
recent study among nearly 20,000 medical patients in Denmark, the HOSPITAL score was 
significantly better than the LACE score for identifying patients at risk of 30 day 
readmission (P<0.001).21
With a C-statistic of 0.72, the HOSPITAL score performs similarly to other commonly used 
prediction models. As a comparison, the well-known CHADS2 and CHADS2-VASC scores 
for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation, and the HAS-BLED score for bleeding risk 
on anticoagulation all have a C-statistic of 0.68 or less in external validation studies.22-25
This study has several limitations. First, by design the model focuses on a medical 
population, and it may not be generalizable to other patient populations such as surgical 
patients. Second, additional predictors could have been used to improve the model’s 
discrimination (e.g. functional status, socioeconomic status), however we purposefully chose 
to use a smaller number of readily available predictors to increase clinical applicability and 
ease of use. Third, we should note that 30 days may not be the most appropriate time frame 
to judge preventable readmissions. However, we chose it because it has become the standard

 for research studies and for hospitals given its use by CMS in its Readmission Reduction 
Program. Fourth, the variables cannot and should be not used to guide readmission reduction 
interventions. The variables included are predictors and not necessarily modifiable risk 
factors. For example, we would not presume that transfusing a patient with a hemoglobin < 
12 g/dL would be indicated to lower their readmission risk. Fifth, we acknowledge that 
transitional care interventions are most effective when implemented as early in the 
hospitalization as possible, and that the score cannot always identify high-risk patients early 
since it includes length of stay and lab values at discharge. However, some patients can be 
identified as high risk at the time of admission (e.g., based on admission type, service, and 
number of prior hospitalizations), while initially lower risk patients may be monitored and 
then identified as high risk prior to discharge, once they have had a procedure or the length 
of stay reaches 5 days. Intensive interventions could then be started at that time. Further 
research would be needed to determine the effects of interim low sodium and hemoglobin 
levels on readmission risk given their ability to normalize (or not) by the time of discharge.
Last, we acknowledge that the outcome of interest in this study is “potentially avoidable 
readmissions” and not “avoidable readmissions.” The SQLape algorithm identifies a 
population with unplanned readmissions that are likely related to the index admission (e.g., 
same organ system, possible complications of therapy). This population is enriched with 
patients whose readmissions are truly preventable, but is neither 100% sensitive nor specific 
for identifying such patients, assuming such patients could ever be identified with certainty. 
The extent to which readmissions are preventable is controversial. The advantage of tools 
such as the HOSPITAL score is that we can use it to begin to answer the more relevant 
question of which patients are most likely to benefit from interventions designed to prevent 
readmissions. Predicting potentially avoidable readmissions (as opposed to all readmissions) 
is an important step along this progression. This work is particularly important given recent 
incentives to reduce readmissions and several recent unsuccessful efforts to reduce them.26 
Future intervention studies should therefore be adequately powered to identify subgroups, 
such as those identified by the HOSPITAL score, most likely to benefit.
Conclusions
The HOSPITAL score had good to excellent ability to identify patients at high risk of 30-day 
potentially avoidable readmission when applied to a large international cohort of medical 
patients. The HOSPITAL score is the first risk prediction score to focus on potentially 
avoidable as opposed to all-cause readmissions, using readily available predictors at the time 
of discharge. This study externally validated it in a large cohort in 4 countries. This score has 
the potential to reliably identify patients in need of more intensive transitional care 
interventions to prevent hospital readmissions.
