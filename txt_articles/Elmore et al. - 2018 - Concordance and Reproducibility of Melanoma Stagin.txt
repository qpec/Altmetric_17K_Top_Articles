Abstract
IMPORTANCE The recently updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification of
cancer staging, the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition (AJCC 8), includes revisions to
definitions of T1a vs T1b or greater. The Melanoma Pathology Study database affords a comparison
of pathologists’concordance and reproducibility in the microstaging of melanoma according to both
the existing 7th edition (AJCC 7) and the new AJCC 8.
OBJECTIVE To compare AJCC 7 and AJCC 8 to examine whether changes to the definitions of T1a
and T1b or greater are associated with changes in concordance and reproducibility.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this diagnostic study conducted as part of the national
Melanoma Pathology Study across US states, 187 pathologists interpreting melanocytic skin lesions
in practice completed 4342 independent case interpretations of 116 invasive melanoma cases. A
consensus reference diagnosis and participating pathologists’interpretations were classified into the
Melanocytic Pathology Assessment Tool and Hierarchy for Diagnosis class IV (T1a) or class V (�T1b)
using both the AJCC 7 and AJCC 8 criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Concordance with consensus reference diagnosis,
interobserver reproducibility, and intraobserver reproducibility.
RESULTS For T1a diagnoses, participating pathologists’concordance with the consensus reference
diagnosis increased from 44% (95% CI, 41%-48%) to 54% (95% CI, 51%-57%) using AJCC 7 and AJCC
8 criteria, respectively. The concordance for cases of T1b or greater increased from 72% (95% CI,
69%-75%) to 78% (95% CI, 75%-80%). Intraobserver reproducibility of diagnoses also improved,
increasing from 59% (95% CI, 56%-63%) to 64% (95% CI, 62%-67%) for T1a invasive melanoma,
and from 74% (95% CI, 71%-76%) to 77% (95% CI, 74%-79%) for T1b or greater invasive
melanoma cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Melanoma staging in AJCC 8 shows greater reproducibility and
higher concordance with a reference standard. Improved classification of invasive melanoma can be
expected after implementation of AJCC 8, suggesting a positive impact on patients. However,
despite improvement, concordance and reproducibility remain low.

 Introduction
Disease subclassification according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual by the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is the customary and prevalent mode for stratifying patients with
melanoma to estimate prognosis, determine appropriate surgical intervention, and assess eligibility
for adjuvant therapies and clinical trials. The process presupposes that pathologists’application of
the AJCC histopathological criteria to individual cases of melanoma is accurate and reproducible.
However, in the field of melanoma, there are only limited analyses quantifying the degree of
reproducibility of AJCC microstaging between pathology observers.1 Extensive variability has been
noted among pathologists in the diagnosis of invasive melanoma.2-7 One of the largest studies,2 our
previously published Melanoma Pathology Study (M-Path) of 187 US pathologists, found less than
50% agreement between pathologists and a consensus-derived reference diagnosis of T1a invasive
melanoma, with improvement to 72% concordance for invasive melanoma T1b or greater. Similarly,
M-Path findings revealed only 46% interobserver agreement for T1a invasive melanoma, and 77%
agreement for T1b or greater melanomas.2
The previous study2 was conceived and executed in the context of the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 7th edition (AJCC 7) staging system. Across interpretations at 2 points, pathologists’
intraobserver reproducibility reached 63% for T1a melanomas and 83% for T1b or greater
melanomas. Given the updated classification in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition (AJCC
8), particularly with changes in definitions of T1a vs T1b or greater, the M-Path database enables a
new comparison of pathologist concordance with a reference standard and reproducibility in the
microstaging of melanoma according to both the existing AJCC 7 and the current AJCC 8.8,9 Briefly,
in AJCC 8, the depth for stage T1a is established at 0.8 mm, rather than 1.0 mm, and the presence of
ulceration continues to contribute to stage modification, but mitoses do not. In addition, the
reporting of Breslow thickness is limited to intervals of tenths of a millimeter rather than hundredths.
We assess whether changes in criteria in the newer AJCC 8 are associated with changes in
concordance and reliability, and whether observer interpretations of histological alterations within
melanocytic lesions are reliable in the context of the demands of microstaging and its consequences
per the AJCC schema.
Methods
Study Design
The data used in this diagnostic study are derived from the M-Path study,2 which was described
previously. Practicing pathologists from 10 US states who actively interpreted melanocytic skin
biopsy lesions as part of their usual clinical practice and planned to continue practicing for a minimum
of 2 subsequent years were invited to participate. This study was approved by the institutional
review boards of Dartmouth College, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Oregon Health
and Science University, and the University of Washington. Informed consent was obtained from
every participating pathologist using an online platform.
Each pathologist was randomized to interpret the same set of melanocytic skin biopsy cases on
2 occasions, at least 8 months apart. The study cases (n = 240) were assembled into 5 sets of 48
cases, each represented by a single glass slide. Each set included the full spectrum of melanocytic
skin lesions (eg, from benign to invasive melanoma).
Participating pathologists independently reviewed the same cases using the same glass slides.
Participants entered diagnostic interpretations into an online Melanocytic Pathology Assessment
Tool and Hierarchy for Diagnosis (MPATH-Dx) histology form for each case, choosing from a diverse
and comprehensive list of more than 50 diagnostic terms. We asked participants to assume that the
single glass slide for each case was representative of the entire lesion and that the margin was
involved (irrespective of whether it involved the biopsy margin). Research analysts subsequently
mapped diagnostic interpretations into 1 of 5 diagnostic classes according to the MPATH-Dx mapping

 scheme.10 Examples of diagnostic terms for each class and suggested treatment recommendations,
provided under the assumption that specimen margins are positive, are depicted in Table 1. Because
the AJCC 8 criteria changes only affect MPATH-Dx classes IV (T1a) and V (�T1b), this article focuses
on the distinction between invasive melanomas exclusively.
Before data collection, a panel of 3 experienced dermatopathologists independently reviewed
the hematoxylin-eosin–stained glass slides for each case followed by consensus review using a
modified Delphi approach.11,12 This process was used to develop a consensus diagnosis for each of the
M-Path study cases. Only 116 cases of invasive melanoma, as defined by the consensus diagnosis,
were considered in this analysis. Three cases included in the original M-Path study as class IV were
excluded here because classification was based on a treatment recommendation of wide excision but
these cases were assessed as melanocytic lesions of uncertain malignant potential.
Statistical Analysis
For each case, the consensus reference diagnosis and the participating pathologists’interpretations
were classified into the MPATH-Dx class IV (T1a) or class V (�T1b) using both the AJCC 7 and AJCC 8
criteria.8,9 Accuracy outcome measures included overinterpretation, underinterpretation, and
concordance of participant interpretations with the relevant (AJCC 7 or AJCC 8) reference diagnosis.
We defined overinterpretation as diagnosing cases at a higher diagnostic class than the reference
diagnosis, and underinterpretation as diagnosing cases at a lower diagnostic class than the reference
diagnosis. Interpretations in agreement with the reference diagnosis were concordant. Confidence
intervals accounted for both within-participant and across-participant variability by using variance
estimates of the following form:
{var(ratep) + [ave(ratep) × (1−ave(ratep))]/nc}/np,
where ave(ratep) is the average rate among pathologists, var(ratep) is the sample variance of rates
among pathologists, nc is the number of cases interpreted by each pathologist, and np is the number
of pathologists. Logistic regression models were used to test for a difference in accuracy between
AJCC 7– and AJCC 8–based mappings. Models used robust estimators of the variance to account for
correlation of case interpretations from the same pathologist.
The reproducibility of participating pathologists’interpretations were assessed as both
intraobserver and interobserver concordance. Interobserver concordance considered all pairs of
interpretations of the same invasive disease case by 2 different pathologists, and the proportion of
those pairs for which interpretations were in the same diagnostic class was calculated. Although
cases were restricted to those with invasive melanoma by consensus reference diagnosis,
participating pathologist interpretations could include diagnoses in other noninvasive MPATH-Dx
classes. Confidence intervals for interobserver concordance rates were bootstrap percentile

 intervals, and tests for differences between AJCC 7– and AJCC 8–based mappings used a Wald
statistic based on the bootstrap standard error of the difference. A total of 3000 bootstrap samples
were obtained by participant-level sampling with replacement and generation of all possible pairs
of distinct sample participants for each sample.
For intraobserver concordance among the 118 participants who interpreted the same glass
slides on 2 occasions, we calculated the proportion of cases with both interpretations in the same
diagnostic class. Confidence intervals for intraobserver concordance rates used a logit
transformation and robust standard error that accounted for clustering at pathologist level. Logistic
regression models were used to test for a difference in intraobserver concordance between AJCC 7–
and AJCC 8–based mappings. All P values correspond to 2-tailed tests and differences with P < .05
were considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using Stata statistical
software (StataCorp), version 14.
Results
The 116 skin biopsy cases defined as invasive melanoma per the consensus reference diagnosis
included 55 cases (47%) of T1a invasive melanoma and 61 cases (53%) of T1b or greater using AJCC 7.
When AJCC 8 staging criteria were applied, the consensus reference diagnosis was upgraded from
T1a to T1b or greater for 4 of 55 cases (7%) and downgraded from T1b or greater to T1a for 19 of 61
cases (31%). The reclassification of invasive cases by consensus reference diagnosis under AJCC 8
resulted in 70 T1a cases (60%) and 46 cases (40%) of T1b or greater.
Of 301 eligible pathologists, 187 (62%) enrolled and completed independent interpretations. In
the first round of interpretations, the pathologists completed 4342 independent case interpretations
of the invasive melanoma cases. Similar to the aforementioned movement in consensus reference
diagnoses, participant diagnoses were upgraded from T1a to T1b or greater for 136 of 1229 T1a
assessments (11%) and downgraded from T1b or greater to T1a for 467 of 1841 assessments (25%).
As shown in Table 2, concordance and reproducibility were improved when using the AJCC 8
criteria vs the earlier AJCC 7 criteria. With regard to T1a diagnoses, participating pathologists’
concordance with the consensus reference diagnosis increased from 44% (95% CI, 41%-48%), using
AJCC 7 criteria, to 54% (95% CI, 51%-57%), using AJCC 8 criteria. The concordance for T1b or greater
cases increased from 72% (95% CI, 69%-75%) to 78% (95% CI, 75%-80%). The increased
concordance associated with using the AJCC 8 reduced both underinterpretation and
overinterpretation.
The intraobserver reproducibility of diagnoses also improved when using the AJCC 8 criteria,
increasing from 59% (95% CI, 56%-63%) to 64% (95% CI, 62%-67%) for T1a invasive melanoma,

Discussion
This analysis provides data that the new AJCC 8 criteria may lead to improved concordance and
reproducibility among pathologists in the classification of invasive melanoma, although the size of
this effect is modest. One explanation of the improvement in concordance of pathological staging of
T1a and T1b melanoma in AJCC 8 is the change in stage T1 subgroups and criteria from AJCC 7. In AJCC
7, the criteria for T1b were presence of dermal mitotic activity, Breslow thickness, or epidermal
ulceration,8 whereas in AJCC 8, the primary determinants for T1a vs T1b were Breslow thickness and
ulceration, with the elimination of mitotic activity.9
In AJCC 8, T1b is now defined by Breslow thickness 0.8 mm or greater or ulceration in
melanomas smaller than 0.8 mm. Because recognition of mitoses in thin melanomas is considered
potentially unreliable13 and the recording of Breslow thickness more reliable,14 one would expect to
find greater reliability of both T1a and T1b classification in the AJCC 8 staging. In fact, our results
correspond exactly to this presupposed increase in reliability of classification of T1a and T1b in AJCC
8. A retrospective restaging of the Netherlands Cancer Registry database also reported a modest
improvement in stratification of pT1 melanoma associated with the implementation of AJCC 8
criteria.15
Limitations
Limitations of the study include interpretation of a single slide (although participants were asked to
assume the slide was representative), use of a testing environment rather than a practice setting, and
inability to obtain second opinions and clinical histories. Also, there is no established method to
define a gold-standard diagnosis; therefore, improvement in concordance with an expert-defined
reference should not necessarily be interpreted as improvement in accuracy. We chose to use the
consensus of 3 experienced pathologists because this approach could be replicated in clinical
practice. Finally, the relative proportions of cases used for this study are not representative of the
population.16 Strengths include a large number of participating pathologists reviewing the same glass
slides on 2 occasions and the ability to assess both concordance with a reference and reproducibility.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that the changes in the AJCC staging will likely have a positive effect on patients.
The consequences of melanoma staging to patients are substantial. Among these are patients’
perceptions of long-term implications to their health as determined by the particular stage assigned
at diagnosis, economic consequences of health care services, and the magnitude of surgical
interventions indicated by the staging classification (eg, size of wide local resection, eligibility for
sentinel lymphatic mapping, and implications for other therapies). In view of these clinical
ramifications, even modest improvements of 6% to 10% in diagnostic concordance resulting from
changes from AJCC 7 to AJCC 8 are important. However, despite improvement, concordance and
reproducibility remain low and suggest that conventional histopathology has been parsed to a
degree that falls below the limits of reliability for the demands and consequences of the staging
schemata that have evolved over time.
