BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pasta as a traditional component of Mediterranean diet (MeD) in Italy has not been studied in detail
in the management of body weight. This study aimed at evaluating the association of pasta intake with body mass index (BMI) and
waist-to-hip ratio, in two large epidemiological datasets.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 14 402 participants aged ⩾ 35 years randomly recruited from the general population of the Molise
region (Moli-sani cohort) and 8964 participants aged 418 years from all over Italy (Italian Nutrition & HEalth Survey, INHES) were
separately analyzed. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-food frequency questionnaire and
one 24-h dietary recall were used for dietary assessment. Weight, height, waist and hip circumference were measured in Moli-sani
or self-reported in INHES. Residuals methodology corrected for either total energy intake or body weight was used for the analysis
of pasta intake.
RESULTS: Higher pasta intake was associated with better adhesion to MeD in both genders (P for botho0.001). In the
Moli-sani study, after multivariable analysis, pasta-energy residuals were negatively associated with BMI in women but not in men
(β-coef = − 0.007, P = 0.003 for women and β-coef = − 0.001, P = 0.58 for men). When pasta intake-body weight residuals were used,
pasta intake was significantly and negatively associated with BMI in crude and multi-adjusted models (including adhesion to MeD)
in both genders and Moli-sani and INHES studies (for all β-coefo0, Po0.05). In the Moli-sani study, pasta-body weight residuals
were significantly and negatively associated with waist and hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (for all β-coefo0, Po0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: As a traditional component of MeD, pasta consumption was negatively associated with BMI, waist circumference
and waist-to-hip ratio and with a lower prevalence of overweight and obesity.

INTRODUCTION
The traditional Mediterranean diet (MeD), a healthy eating
behavior model, might be the basis for establishing nutrition
guidelines as an outcome of health policies.1,2 Its health benefits
in primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases has long
been studied since middle 50s3–5 and confirmed by meta-
analysis.6–8
Major components of the MeD are foods with high content of
complex carbohydrates and fiber such as legumes, rice and
cereals.1 The latter represent the main source of carbohydrates in
the diet and in Italy, they are consumed mainly in the form of
pasta.9
In the last decades in Italy, despite the strong effort to promote
MeD, a progressive change occurred in eating habits.10,11 Pasta
consumption has been decreased,9–14 as a concept of low
carbohydrate and high protein diet against obesity emerged.
However, the debate of hypo-caloric high protein diets versus low
fat and standard carbohydrate diets in the management of body
weight and the health implications (that is, kidney function, bone
health) is still open.15–20
On
the
contrary,
adherence
to
the
MeD
according
to
epidemiological and clinical evidence has a protective role on
overweight and obesity,21–23 in parallel with important health
benefits against chronic diseases and related comorbidities.5,6
Despite this fact, the components of MeD have not been studied
in deep for their association with body weight and obesity. In
particular, epidemiological data about the association of pasta
consumption with body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of
overweight and obesity are still limited.
This work aimed at evaluating the association of pasta intake
with BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and
prevalence of overweight and obesity in the context of MeD
adherence. Data from two different large epidemiological studies
with
different
methodology
in
dietary
and
anthropometric
assessment have been used.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study populations
Moli-sani participants.
The cohort of the Moli-sani Project was randomly
recruited in the Molise region (Italy) from city hall registries by a multistage
sampling, as previously described.24,25 Between March 2005 and April
2010, 24 325 subjects were enrolled. Participants who had incomplete
medical (n = 235) or dietary questionnaires (n = 1917) or were not
caucasians or not born in Italy (n = 332) were excluded from the analysis.
Furthermore, persons who were under a special diet or a diet for the
control of diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia (n = 6262) were
excluded as these conditions may lead to changes in their usual diet.

 The final study sample included in this analysis consisted of 14 402
subjects (7216 women and 7186 men).
The Moli-sani project was approved by the Catholic University Ethical
Committee. All participants provided written informed consent.
INHES participants.
The Italian Nutrition & Health Survey (INHES) project is
a telephone-based survey on nutrition and health specifically designed to
collect information on the dietary habits (quality, quantity and patterns),
food choice determinants, and food health awareness of the Italian
population according to geographical distribution, age, gender and
socioeconomic profile. Between November 2010 and November 2013,
9319 women and men aged ⩾ 5 years from all over Italy were enrolled.
First, subjects (n = 9106) in the age range 35–79 years, recruited in the
2008–2012
wave
of
the
Cardiovascular
Epidemiologic
Observatory
(participation rate 53%, from 40 to 85% in the different regions)26,27 were
invited to participate in the INHES survey. Once they accepted, participants
were asked to invite one relative older than 79 or younger than 35 years to
join the survey. Finally, 5385 (59.1%) from the original population and 3754
from their relatives were included in the survey.
The sampled subjects were distributed in the four seasons (excluding
Christmas, Easter and middle August periods). The survey calendar was
organized to capture an adequate proportion of weekdays and weekend
days at group level.
The recruitment was performed using computer-assisted telephone
interviewing (CATI): 1-day 24-h dietary recall,9 the Italian version of the
European Food Propensity Questionnaire,28 questionnaire of nutrition-
related behavior, anamnestic questionnaire on health status, risk factors
and anthropometry, and SF12 questionnaire on health perception29 were
administered.
For the purpose of the present study, the adult (18–96 years) population
of 8964 (4782 women and 4182 men) was analyzed. The INHES study was
approved by the Ethical Committee of the Catholic University of Rome.
Dietary assessment
Moli-sani population.
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition (EPIC)-food frequency questionnaire, specifically adapted for
the Italian population, was used to determine usual nutritional intakes
during the previous year.12 A computer program, NAF,30 was developed by
the
Epidemiology
and Prevention Unit,
Fondazione IRCCS,
Istituto
Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan to convert questionnaire dietary data into
frequencies of consumption and average daily amounts of foods (grams
per day) and energy intake (kcal per day). NAF was linked to the Italian FTC
for the energy assessment.31
INHES population.
Each participant received by mail a short photograph
atlas and guidance notes to estimate portion sizes (with instructions to
quantify the portions used by children) developed on the basis of EPIC-
SOFT picture book32 and a hard-copy diary structured by meal, where all
the information on food consumption the day before the telephone
interview was self-recorded. All foods and drinks consumed (including tap
and bottled water), both at and outside home, were recorded. The day
after, participants were interviewed by telephone by trained and
standardized interviewers, starting from the self-recorded diary, by using
a computer-based 24-h dietary recall interview software.
For every eating occasion, subjects were asked to carefully record and
recall: time, place of consumption, detailed description of foods (or
beverages), quantity consumed and brand (for manufactured foods).
Portion sizes were reported by subjects with the help of a picture booklet.
Moreover, it was asked whether they were following a particular diet and
whether the consumption they had reported differed from their usual
consumption.
The
data
management
system
INRAN-DIARIO
3.1
developed
by
INRAN9,33 in previous surveys9,34 was used for data coding, data entry
and data processing. This software includes several checkpoints to ensure
the accuracy and completeness of the data recorded and allows each
interviewer to create new temporary food codes for all the food items and
recipes that are not present in the databanks. Four databases were used to
transform the data reported by subjects into the weight of single foods,
raw ingredients and into the amounts of nutrients consumed. The portions
estimated by subjects with the help of the picture booklet are linked to the
specific weight of each food item. This database contains a total of 9450
entries (weight of standard portions of specific dishes or units of
measurement) for 2460 foods, that is, on average approximately four
entries per food. Any missing food consumed during the survey was added
to the food composition database.
For both studies, pasta consumption was calculated and expressed as
grams per day and g kcal − 1 of daily energy intake. Adherence to MeD was
evaluated by applying a dietary score ranging from 0 to 11, that have been
specifically developed for the Italian population.34 The increase in that
score was associated with higher adherence to MeD.
Measurements and definition of factors
Moli-sani population.
Socioeconomic status was defined as a score based
on eight variables ranging from 0 to 8; the higher the score, the higher the
level of socioeconomic status.24 Physical activity was assessed by a
structured questionnaire and expressed as daily energy expenditure in
MET-h.24,35 Body weight and height were measured while the subjects
wore no shoes and light underwear and BMI (kg m − 2) was calculated.
Categories of BMI 'o25 kg m − 2', '25–29.9 kg m − 2' and ' ⩾ 30 kg m − 2' were
considered as 'under/normal weight', 'overweight' and 'obese', respec-
tively, according to WHO guidelines.36 Moreover, waist circumference, in
cm, was measured in the middle between the twelfth rib and the iliac crest
and hip circumference, in cm, was measured around the buttocks. The
waist-to-hip ratio was then calculated.
INHES population.
Participants reported the type of their profession as
'manual', 'non manual', 'housewife' (only for women), 'retired' and 'student
or unemployed' and their marital status as 'single', 'married', 'separated'
and 'widow'. They were also asked about their physical activity and
grouped to the categories of 'physically active' or 'inactive'. Body weight
and height were self-reported and BMI (kg m − 2) was calculated. Self-
reported BMI data tend to over- or under-estimate in proportion to
measured BMI. Categories of BMI were calculated as above. Both physical
activity and anthropometric assessment37,38 were under self-reporting
biases.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis.
The normality of continuous variables was tested
graphically. Continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation)
and categorical variables as frequencies. Comparisons of continuous
variables between two groups of study were performed using the
Student’s t-test. Comparisons of continuous variables within more than
two groups were carried out using the analysis of variance F-test.
Associations between food group intake and score of adherence to MeD
were tested using the Spearman’s rho, while associations of categorical
variables were tested using Pearson’s X2-test. Two-sided P-valueo0.05 was
considered as statistically significant. STATA version 9 software was used
for all calculations (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Statistical modeling step 1.
Crude linear regression models stratified by
gender were generated with main outcome the BMI (kg m − 2) and
independent factor, the pasta consumption (grams per day) in both Moli-
sani and INHES populations.
Statistical modeling step 2.
The energy residuals methodology, previously
used in the study of the association of food group intake with BMI,39 was
used to overcome bias related to the over- or under-estimation of dietary
data in both Moli-sani and INHES datasets.
In particular, linear regression was used to 'predict' individual pasta
intakes on the basis of total energy intake (kcal per day), and the residual
value for each regression was calculated by subtracting the observed value
from the predicted value (resulting in the 'Pasta-energy residuals').
The latter was used as an independent variable in regression models
with BMI (dependent variable) in crude and multi-adjusted level in both
Moli-sani and INHES datasets. Multi-adjusted models were calculated by
adjusting crude models for age, social status, physical activity level, energy
intake and adherence to the MeD in the Moli-sani dataset; and for age,
marital status, occupation, physical activity, energy intake and adherence
to the MeD in the INHES dataset.
Statistical modeling step 3.
Crude linear regression models stratified by
the quintiles of body weight of the subjects were generated with BMI
(kg m − 2) as main outcome and pasta consumption (grams per day) as
independent factor, in both Moli-sani and INHES populations.
As this stratification significantly affected the association of BMI with
pasta
intake
(from

to
negative

 associations in different body weight groups after stratification), further
regression analysis was performed.
Standardized residuals (that is, 'pasta-body weight residuals') were
predicted in both datasets, using linear regression analysis with main
outcome as pasta intake (grams per day) and independent variable as
body weight (kg). The generated pasta-body weight residuals were
standardized by dividing them by their estimated standard error and
produced to be mathematically independent from body weight. This way
of correcting pasta intake by the body weight takes into account in a
generic way the individual’s need.
Crude and multi-adjusted models stratified by gender were generated
with main outcome the BMI (Kg m-2) and independent factor, the
predicted pasta-body weight residuals in both Moli-sani and INHES
datasets.
Multi-adjusted models were calculated by adjusting crude models for
age, social status, physical activity level, energy intake and adherence to
the MeD in the Moli-sani dataset; and for age, marital status, occupation,
physical activity, energy intake and adherence to the MeD in the INHES
dataset. Stratified linear regression analysis by groups of MeD adherence
(that is, quartiles of MeD index) was performed to assess any interaction of
MeD on the association of pasta with BMI.
Statistical modeling step 4.
Linear regression analysis using the same
adjustment scheme was performed with main outcome the waist or hip
circumference (cm) or waist-to-hip ratio and independent factor the pasta-
energy and -body weight residuals in the Moli-sani population.
Linear regression assumptions testing.
For all models, normality of
residuals, homoscedasticity and multiple co-linearity were evaluated by
plotting standardized residuals against the predicted values and these
assumptions tend to be fulfilled.
RESULTS
Pasta intake in association with BMI
Moli-sani population.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity
was 35.7% and 27.7% in women and 50.4% and 29.0% in men,
respectively (P for gender differenceo0.001). Table 1 presents the
characteristics of Moli-sani participants according to BMI group in
a stratified analysis by gender. Both in women and men, the obese
population was older and at lower socioeconomic status (P for
allo0.001), had higher waist and hip circumferences and waist-to-
hip ratio, and consumed more pasta (grams per day) than normal
or overweight participants (P for botho0.05).
Pasta consumption was also associated with better adhesion to
the Mediterranean diet in both genders (for both Spearman’s
rho40, Po0.001). Among food groups included in MeD, cooked
tomatoes and other sauces were strongly correlated with pasta
consumption in both women (Spearman’s rho = 0.68 and 0.64,
Po0.001) and men (Spearman’s rho = 0.71 and 0.59, Po0.001).
Other food groups included in MeD with strong correlations with
pasta intake in both genders were onions and garlic, olive oil,
seasoned cheese and rice (P for allo0.05).
Simple linear regression analysis indicated that pasta intake
expressed as grams per day was positively associated with BMI in
both genders (Figure 1). However, because underreporting of
energy intake was evident in obese women participants (Table 1),
the energy residuals methodology was elaborated to overcome
related bias and the association changed direction from positive
to negative (Figure 1).
Pasta-energy residuals were negatively associated with BMI in
women and not in men (Figure 1, Table 2). After adjustment for
age, social status, physical activity level, energy intake and
adherence to the MeD, results remained significant for women
population (β-coef = − 0.007, P = 0.003 for women and β-coef =
− 0.001, P = 0.58 for men).
Moreover, stratified analysis by quintiles of body weight of the
subjects showed that the initial positive association of pasta intake
(grams per day) with BMI changed to negative associations in the
majority of body weight groups in both genders (β-coefo0,
Po0.05), (Table 3).
Figure 1 also illustrates the change in the direction of the
association of pasta intake with BMI (that is, from positive to
negative) that was observed after elaborating the residuals
methodology by correcting pasta intake (grams per day) by the
body weight (kg) of the subjects.
Multi-adjusted linear regression analysis (Table 2) indicated that
the pasta-body weight residuals were negatively associated with
BMI in women and men, respectively (β-coef = − 0.87, Po0.001 in
women and β-coef = − 0.51, Po0.001 in men) (Table 2).
Stratified analysis by MeD adherence of the association of
pasta-body weight residuals with BMI showed a significant

The prevalence of overweight and obesity was
30.5% and 12.6% in women and 46.7% and 14.5% in men,
respectively (P for gender differenceo0.001). Table 4 presents the
characteristics of INHES participants according to BMI group in a
stratified analysis by gender. Similarly to the Moli-sani dataset,
both female and male obese were older (P for botho0.001), at
lower socioeconomic status and reported a higher intake (grams
per day) of pasta in women (P = 0.002).

in

population
(β-coef = 0.004,
P = 0.01) and not in men (β-coef = − 0.004, P = 0.05).
Pasta-energy residuals were negatively associated with BMI in
women (β-coef=−0.004, P=0.01) and positively in men (β-coef=
0.005, P=0.01), in crude analysis (Table 2). These associations became
non-significant after adjustments in both genders (P40.05).
However, stratified analysis by the quintiles of body weight of
the subjects for the association of pasta intake (grams per day)
with BMI changed the initial positive association to negative
associations in part of the body weight groups in both genders (β-
coefo0, Po0.05), (Table 3).
Finally, correcting pasta intake by the body weight of the
subjects, linear regression analysis showed a negative significant
association of BMI with pasta-body weight residuals in both
genders and in multi-adjusted models (β-coef = − 0.18, P = 0.01 in
women and β-coef = − 0.30, Po0.001 in men), (Table 2).
Stratified analysis by the group of MeD adherence of the
association of pasta-body weight residuals with BMI indicated
significant negative associations in different groups in both
genders (β-coefo0, Po0.05).

men (P40.05) of the Moli-sani population (Table 5). After
adjustments, only the negative association of pasta-energy
residuals with hip ratio remained significant (β-coef = − 0.01,

DISCUSSION
Despite the evidence supporting the role of MeD adherence in the
management of a favorable body weight,21–23 according to the
best of our knowledge, there is no study evaluating this
association for pasta as a MeD component. Our findings show a
negative association of pasta consumption with general and
central obesity in two methodologically and geographically
different, large Mediterranean populations.

Pasta intake and central, overall obesity
G Pounis et al

Nutrition & Diabetes (2016) 1 – 8
 Pasta as a product of cereals has been since ancient times
consumed in the Mediterranean area and it has been considered
as one of MeD’s traditional components, placed at the basis of the
pyramid.1,2 Our comparative analysis of data from two different
Mediterranean populations supports that pasta intake is nega-
tively associated with both indexes of obesity status and
prevalence of overweight and obesity.
Our results are in agreement with a relatively recent study
examining food and nutrient intakes in association with BMI in
1794 US middle-aged adults, showing that pasta intake among
other food groups is negatively associated with BMI.39 Moreover,
evidence from Greek islands supports a favorable role of
carbohydrate intake on central and general obesity.40
On the other hand, bias of over-estimation or under-estimation
presented generally in dietary data was evident also in the present
datasets especially in women. As a result, pasta intake expressed
as grams per day, seemed to be positively associated with BMI in
crude analysis. However, to overcome the related bias, the
correction of food group consumption by total caloric intake
using the 'energy residual methodology' was elaborated as a
relatively frequent procedure in dietary analysis.41 The association
changed direction and from positive became negative.

Pasta intake and central, overall obesity
G Pounis et al
5
Nutrition & Diabetes (2016) 1 – 8
 To
strengthen
our
results,
we
also
performed
multiple
approaches in dietary analysis. In fact, we used both 'energy
residual methodology' and residual methodology for correcting
pasta intake for body weight of the subjects.
This approach was derived from the observation that in both
Moli-sani and INHES datasets, the association of pasta intake as
grams per day with BMI from positive became negative after
stratification for the body weight of the subjects. Standardized
residuals were predicted in both datasets, using linear regression
analysis with main outcome pasta intake (grams per day) and
independent variable body weight (kg).
The generated pasta-body weight residuals were produced to
be mathematically independent from body weight. This was
evident because the standardized residuals (that is, 'pasta-body
weight residuals') that were predicted by using linear regression
analysis with main outcome pasta intake (grams per day) and
independent variable body weight (kg) are mathematically
independent from body weight.
Again, pasta-body weight residuals were negatively associated
with BMI in both populations and in both genders. Altogether,
these different approaches strengthen the negative association of
pasta intake with obesity indexes.
The measurement of body weight, as carried out in the Moli-
sani study, is a simple physical examination that has limited
systematic or random errors and might result in a reduction in
overall error because the reported energy intake can be under
miss- or over-reporting bias. The evidence that with both
methodologies the negative association of pasta intake with
obesity status was confirmed is possibly an indicator of the validity
of the proposed methodology, although further investigation in
prospective studies is needed.
During the last decades, a progressive increase in red meat
consumption, fats, dairy products and simple sugars has been
recorded in Italy.10,42 The adherence to the MeD that may offer
weight management advantages is significantly lowered.42 Pasta
consumption
has
been
modified,
because
it
is
frequently
considered as a dietary factor that should be restricted in a
weight loss program.
In this work, pasta intake was positively associated with the
intake of other important food groups included in MeD such as
tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, garlic, olive oil, seasoned cheese
and rice.5,6,21–23 However, it was interesting that the negative
association of pasta intake with BMI was independent from MeD
adherence and total daily caloric intake. Indeed, the negative
association was not affected by either the addition of both MeD
adherence index and total daily caloric intake into multivariate
analysis or by the stratification for MeD adherence level.
From an epidemiological and clinical perspective, it could be
important to evaluate the role of other food groups associated
with pasta consumption on the management of body weight. The
study of dietary patterns such as MeD or others not 'a-priori'
defined in association with human anthropometry would be
useful to understand the effect of the combination of pasta with
other food group intake on the management of body weight.
The debate of hypo-caloric high protein diets versus low fat and
standard carbohydrate diets in the regulation of body weight is
still on the surface of nutrition research,15,22,23 especially because
health implications of high protein diets have been discussed (that
is, kidney function, bone health).17–20 Our results support that
MeD, and pasta as one of its major components, should be further
investigated for their role in decreasing the risk for overweight
and obesity.
Another novelty of the present work is the comparative
assessment of the study hypothesis in both Moli-sani and INHES
datasets. In fact, the results derived from the two analyses were
almost identical, despite the large differences in participant’s
recruitment
methodology
and
in
dietary
assessment.
This
demonstrates the reproducibility of the present associations
among studies with relative diversity in their methodologies.
In particular, the Moli-sani population is a cohort study based on
face-to-face interviews and clinical examinations, while INHES is a
telephone-based
survey.
In
addition,
Moli-sani
recruited
a
representative sample of the Molise region in Italy while the
population of INHES is spread all over the country. Also, the
dietary
evaluation
was
performed
by
using
the
EPIC-food
frequency questionnaire in the case of Moli-sani and one 24-h
dietary recall in INHES. Even the prevalence of obesity was
significantly lower in INHES population because the anthropo-
metric assessment and the age range differed. Moli-sani monitors
made the measurements during the clinical assessment, while in
INHES, the body weight and height were self-reported and under
related bias of underreporting.
Beyond the relevance of the findings of the present work,
limitations do exist. First, because both Moli-sani and INHES are
cross-sectional studies, they do not allow to provide cause–effect
considerations in the observed associations. Prospective anthro-
pometric data on these populations are still missing and limit the
clinical significance of the present conclusions. In addition, bias of
over- or under-estimation by the use of the dietary methodologies
and for the extracted data (that is, pasta intake, adherence to
MeD) should be acknowledged for both studies. The co-linearity
presented in food group intake data (that is, pasta intake with
other food groups) limits also the present analysis.
In the Moli-sani study, although adequate from a broad
epidemiological perspective, a food frequency questionnaire is
less accurate at the individual level than other measurement
methods. In addition, dietary information was retrieved only once
and, thus, may be prone to recall bias and seasonal variation.
Possible errors because of misreporting by the participating

 subjects should also be acknowledged. However, to rule out the
possibility that the associations found were dependent on either
changes in lifestyle (particularly in dietary habits) as a conse-
quence of a disease or to the presence of less healthy food intake
in healthy people, we had preliminarily excluded from our
analyses all subjects with previous CVD or cancer and participants
under special diets. Furthermore, the cross-sectional analysis
design does not allow for concluding on the causality of the
present associations.
Limitations are evident also for INHES study. The one 24-h
dietary recall could not be considered as representative of the
dietary habits of an individual. The telephone-based interviews are
under the limitation of misreporting or under/over-estimation of
food consumption. The body weight and height was self-reported
and under the related bias.
In conclusion, this study for the first time has observed a negative
association of pasta consumption and central and overall obesity in
a large sample of Mediterranean population. Pasta as the traditional
component of MeD was studied for its association with obesity
indexes. The comparative assessment of two different epidemiolo-
gical datasets and the similarities revealed in the studied associa-
tions provide reliability and support to the present results.
