Background
Self-harm (SH; intentional self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, often repeated, and associated with suicide. This is an update of
a broader Cochrane review first published in 1998, previously updated in 1999, and now split into three separate reviews. This review
focuses on psychosocial interventions in adults who engage in self-harm.
Objectives
To assess the effects of specific psychosocial treatments versus treatment as usual, enhanced usual care or other forms of psychological
therapy, in adults following SH.
Search methods
The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) trials coordinator searched the CCDAN Clinical Trials Register (to
29 April 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE
(1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date).
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing psychosocial treatments with treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual care (EUC) or alternative
treatments in adults with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services.
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane’s standard methodological procedures.

Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)

 Main results
We included 55 trials, with a total of 17,699 participants. Eighteen trials investigated cognitive-behavioural-based psychotherapy
(CBT-based psychotherapy; comprising cognitive-behavioural, problem-solving therapy or both). Nine investigated interventions for
multiple repetition of SH/probable personality disorder, comprising emotion-regulation group-based psychotherapy, mentalisation, and
dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT). Four investigated case management, and 11 examined remote contact interventions (postcards,
emergency cards, telephone contact). Most other interventions were evaluated in only single small trials of moderate to very low quality.
There was a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy compared to TAU at final follow-up in terms of fewer participants
repeating SH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.88; number of studies k = 17; N = 2665; GRADE: low
quality evidence), but with no reduction in frequency of SH (mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.26; k = 6; N = 594;
GRADE: low quality).
For interventions typically delivered to individuals with a history of multiple episodes of SH/probable personality disorder, group-based
emotion-regulation psychotherapy and mentalisation were associated with significantly reduced repetition when compared to TAU:
group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N = 83; GRADE: low quality), mentalisation
(OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134; GRADE: moderate quality). Compared with TAU, dialectical behaviour therapy
(DBT) showed a significant reduction in frequency of SH at final follow-up (MD -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k = 3; N = 292;
GRADE: low quality) but not in the proportion of individuals repeating SH (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.59, k = 3; N = 247; GRADE:
low quality). Compared with an alternative form of psychological therapy, DBT-oriented therapy was also associated with a significant
treatment effect for repetition of SH at final follow-up (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k = 1; N = 24; GRADE: low quality). However,
neither DBT vs ’treatment by expert’ (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.95; k = 1; N = 97; GRADE: very low quality) nor prolonged
exposure DBT vs standard exposure DBT (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.68; k = 1; N =18; GRADE: low quality) were associated with
a significant reduction in repetition of SH.
Case management was not associated with a significant reduction in repetition of SH at post intervention compared to either TAU
or enhanced usual care (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.30; k = 4; N = 1608; GRADE: moderate quality). Continuity of care by the
same therapist vs a different therapist was also not associated with a significant treatment effect for repetition (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07
to 1.10; k = 1; N = 136; GRADE: very low quality). None of the following remote contact interventions were associated with fewer
participants repeating SH compared with TAU: adherence enhancement (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.02; k = 1; N = 391; GRADE:
low quality), mixed multimodal interventions (comprising psychological therapy and remote contact-based interventions) (OR 0.98,
95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1 study; N = 684; GRADE: low quality), including a culturally adapted form of this intervention (OR 0.83,
95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167; GRADE: low quality), postcards (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.23; k = 4; N = 3277; GRADE:
very low quality), emergency cards (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.14; k = 2; N = 1039; GRADE: low quality), general practitioner’s
letter (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932; GRADE: moderate quality), telephone contact (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to
1.32; k = 3; N = 840; GRADE: very low quality), and mobile telephone-based psychological therapy (OR not estimable due to zero
cell counts; GRADE: low quality).
None of the following mixed interventions were associated with reduced repetition of SH compared to either alternative forms of
psychological therapy: interpersonal problem-solving skills training, behaviour therapy, home-based problem-solving therapy, long-
term psychotherapy; or to TAU: provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, intensive inpatient and community
treatment, general hospital admission, or intensive outpatient treatment.
We had only limited evidence on whether the intervention had different effects in men and women. Data on adverse effects, other than
planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were not reported.
Authors’ conclusions
CBT-based psychological therapy can result in fewer individuals repeating SH; however, the quality of this evidence, assessed using
GRADE criteria, ranged between moderate and low. Dialectical behaviour therapy for people with multiple episodes of SH/probable
personality disorder may lead to a reduction in frequency of SH, but this finding is based on low quality evidence. Case management and
remote contact interventions did not appear to have any benefits in terms of reducing repetition of SH. Other therapeutic approaches
were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to these interventions is inconclusive.

 Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults
Why is this review important?
Self harm (SH), which includes non-fatal intentional self-poisoning/overdose and self-injury, is a major problem in many countries and
is linked to risk of future suicide. It is distressing for both patients and their families and friends, and places large demands on clinical
services. It is therefore important to assess the evidence on treatments for SH patients.
Who will be interested in this review?
Clinicians working with people who engage in SH, policy makers, people who themselves have engaged in SH or may be at risk of
doing so, and their families and relatives.
What questions does this review aim to answer?
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 1999, which found little evidence of beneficial effects of psychosocial
treatments on repetition of SH. This update aims to further evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial treatments for
patients with SH with a broader range of outcomes.
Which studies were included in the review?
To be included in the review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for adults who had recently
engaged in SH. We searched electronic databases to find all such trials published up until 29 April 2015, and found 55 that met our
inclusion criteria.
What does the evidence from the review tell us?
There have now been a number of investigations of psychosocial treatments for SH in adults, with greater representation in recent years
of low- and middle-income countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Some moderate quality evidence shows that cognitive-behavioural-based (CBT-based) psychotherapy (a psychotherapy intended to
change unhelpful thinking, emotions and behaviour) may help prevent repetition of SH, although it did not reduce overall frequency
of SH. There were encouraging results (from small trials of moderate to very low quality) for other interventions aimed at reducing the
frequency of SH in people with probable personality disorder, including group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy, mentalisation
(a psychosocial therapy intended to increase a person’s understanding of their own and others’ mental state), and dialectical behaviour
therapies (DBT; psychosocial therapies intended to assist with identification of triggers that lead to reactive behaviours and to provide
individuals with emotional coping skills to avoid these reactions). Whilst DBT was not associated with a significant reduction in
repetition of SH at final follow-up as compared to usual treatment, there was evidence of low quality suggesting a reduction in frequency
of SH.
There was no clear evidence supporting the effectiveness of prolonged exposure to DBT, case management, approaches to improve
treatment adherence, mixed multimodal interventions (comprising both psychological therapy and remote contact-based interven-
tions), remote contact interventions (postcards, emergency cards, and telephone contact), interpersonal problem-solving skills training,
behaviour therapy, provision of information and support, treatment for alcohol misuse, home-based problem-solving therapy, intensive
inpatient and community treatment, general hospital admission, intensive outpatient treatment, or long-term psychotherapy.
We had only limited evidence from a subset of the studies relating to whether the intervention had different effects in men and women.
The trials did not report on side effects other than suicidal behaviour.
What should happen next?
The promisingresultsforCBT-basedpsychological therapyanddialectical behaviourtherapywarrantfurtherinvestigationto understand
which patients benefit from these types of interventions. There were only a few, generally small trials on most other types of psychosocial
therapies, providing little evidence of beneficial effects; however, these cannot be ruled out. There is a need for more information about
whether psychosocial interventions might work differently between men and women.

 a We rated risk of bias as SERIOUS as the nature of the intervention means that clinical personnel could not have remained blind
to treatment allocation. Additionally, for some trials, participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. Performance
and detection bias therefore may have been present.
b Imprecision was rated as SERIOUS as the confidence interval is wide
c We rated inconsistency as SERIOUS due to notable differences in the magnitude of the effect size estimates between trials
on visual inspection of the forest plot.

Description of the condition
The term ’self-harm’ is used to describe all non-fatal intentional
acts of self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of degree of sui-
cidal intent or other types of motivation (Hawton 2003a). Thus
it includes acts intended to result in death (’attempted suicide’),
those without suicidal intent (e.g., to communicate distress, to
temporarily reduce unpleasant feelings), and those with mixed
motivation (Hjelmeland 2002; Scoliers 2009). The term ’parasui-
cide’ was introduced by Kreitman 1969 to include the same range
of behaviour. However, clinicians in the USA have used ’parasui-
cide’ to refer specifically to acts of self-harm without suicidal in-
tent (Linehan 1991), and the term has largely fallen into disuse in
the UK and other countries. The Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) includes two types
of self-harming behaviour as conditions for further study, namely
non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviour disorder
(SBD). Many researchers and clinicians, however, believe this to
be an artificial and somewhat misleading categorisation (Kapur
2013). We have therefore used the approach favoured in the UK
and some other countries where all intentional self-harm is con-
ceptualised in a single category, namely self-harm (SH). Within
this category, suicidal intent is regarded as a dimensional rather
than a categorical concept. Readers more familiar with the NSSI
and SBD distinction may regard SH as an umbrella term for these
two behaviours (although it should be noted that neither NSSI
nor SBD include non-fatal self-poisoning).
SH has been a growing problem in most countries over the past
40 years. In the UK, researchers estimate that there are now more
than 200,000 presentations to general hospitals per year (Hawton
2007). In addition, self-harm often occurs in adults in the commu-
nity and does not come to the attention of clinical services or other
helping agencies (Borges 2011). SH consumes considerable hospi-
tal resources in both developed and developing countries (Carter
2005; Claassen 2006; Fleischmann 2005; Gibbs 2004; Kinyanda
2005; Parkar 2006; Schmidtke 1996; Schmidtke 2004).
Unlike suicide, in most countries SH usually occurs more com-
monly in females than males, although this gap decreases over
the life cycle (Hawton 2008). It has also decreased in recent years
(Perry 2012). SH predominantly occurs in young people, with
60% to 70% of individuals in many studies aged under 35 years.
In females, rates tend to be particularly high among those aged 15
to 24, whereas in males the highest rates are usually among those
in their late 20s and early 30s. SH is also less common in older
people but then tends to be associated with high suicidal intent
(Hawton 2008), with consequent greater risk of future suicide
(Murphy 2012).
Many people who engage in SH are facing acute life problems,
often in the context of longer-term difficulties (Hawton 2003b).
Common problems include disrupted relationships, employment
difficulties, financial and housing problems, and social isolation.
Alcohol abuse and, to a lesser extent, drug misuse are often present.
There may be a history of adverse experiences, such as physical
abuse, sexual abuse, or both. In older people, physical health prob-
lems, bereavement, and threatened loss of independence become
increasingly important.
Many patients who present to hospital following SH have psychi-
atric disorders, especially depression, anxiety, and substance mis-
use (Hawton 2013). These disorders frequently occur in combi-
nation with personality disorder (Haw 2001).
Both psychological and biological factors appear to increase vul-
nerability to SH. Psychological factors include difficulties in prob-
lem-solving and a tendency to show black and white (or all or
none) thinking patterns, low self-esteem, impulsivity, vulnerabil-
ity to having pessimistic thoughts about the future (i.e., hopeless-
ness) and a sense of entrapment ( O’Connor 2012: Williams 2000;
Williams 2005). Biological factors include disturbances in the
serotonergic and stress-response systems (Van Heeringen 2014).
SH is often repeated, with 15% to 25% of individuals who present
to hospital with SH returning to the same hospital following a
repeat episode within a year (Carroll 2014; Owens 2002). Studies
from Asia suggest a lower risk of repetition (Carroll 2014). There
may be other repeat episodes that do not result in hospital presen-
tation.
The risk of death by suicide within one year amongst people who
attend hospital with SH varies across different studies, from nearly
1% to over 3% (Carroll 2014; Owens 2002). This variation re-
flects differences in the characteristics of the SH population and
background national suicide rates. During the first year after a SH
episode, the risk in the UK is 50 to 100 times that of the gen-
eral population (Cooper 2005; Hawton 1988; Hawton 2003b).
Of people who die by suicide, over half will have a history of SH
(Foster 1997), and at least 15% will have presented to hospital
with SH in the preceding year (Gairin 2003). A history of SH is
the strongest risk factor for suicide across a range of psychiatric
disorders (Sakinofsky 2000). Repetition of SH further increases
the risk of suicide (Zahl 2004).
Description of the intervention
Psychosocial interventions include a wide variety of treatments,
for example cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), problem-solv-
ing therapy, behaviour therapy, and dialectical behaviour therapy
(DBT). Treatments may vary in relation to the initial manage-
ment; the location of treatment; the continuity, intensity or fre-
quency of contact with a therapist; and the mode of delivery (in-
dividual or group-based). We included treatments that focused on
specific subgroups of SH patients in this review. These subgroups
may be defined in terms of age, psychological characteristics or
psychiatric diagnoses, substance misuse, and history of repetition
of self-harm. We also included studies of strategies to maintain
contact with patients, such as visits to patients with poor thera-

means.
How the intervention might work
The mechanisms of action of psychosocial interventions might in-
clude helping people improve their coping skills and self-esteem,
tackle specific problems, overcome psychiatric disorders, increase
their sense of social connectedness, and reduce impulsivity, aggres-
sion and unhelpful reactions to distressing situations.
CBT-based psychotherapy
CBT aims to help patients identify and critically evaluate the way
in which they interpret and evaluate disturbing emotional experi-
ences and events and then change the way they deal with problems
(Westbrook 2011). The therapy has three steps. First, therapists
help patients change the way in which they interpret and evalu-
ate distressing emotions. Secondly, patients learn strategies to help
them change the way they think about the meaning and conse-
quences of these emotions. Lastly, with the benefit of modified
interpretation of emotions and events, the therapy helps patients
to change their behaviour and especially to develop positive func-
tional behaviour (Jones 2012).
Problem-solving therapy, which is an integral part of CBT, as-
sumes that psychopathological processes such as SH are ineffec-
tive and maladaptive coping behaviours. Patients might overcome
them by learning skills to actively, constructively and effectively
solve the problems they face in their daily life (Nezu 2010). Ther-
apists might achieve this by encouraging patients to consciously
and rationally appraise problems, reduce or modify the negative
emotions generated by problems, and develop a range of possible
solutions to address their problems (D’Zurilla 2010). Treatment
goals include helping patients to develop a positive problem-solv-
ing orientation, use rational problem-solving strategies, reduce the
tendency to avoid problem-solving, and reduce the use of impul-
sive problem-solving strategies (Washburn 2012).
Our rationale for including CBT and problem-solving therapy
approaches in a single category of CBT-based psychotherapy in
this review is that they share common elements. For example,
problem-solving therapy incorporates other elements of behaviour
therapyandconstitutesakeypartof cognitive behavioural therapy;
also, cognitive-behavioural strategies are important for effective
problem-solving therapy (Hawton 1989; Westbrook 2011)
Interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable
personality disorder
The goal of emotion-regulation training is to help patients find
adaptive ways to respond to distress instead of trying to control,
suppress or otherwise avoid experiencing these emotions through
behaviours such as SH (Gratz 2007). Emotion-regulation training
therefore helps patients in four stages: first, to become more aware
and accepting of their emotional experiences; second, to engage
in goal-directed behaviours whilst inhibiting the expression of im-
pulsive ones; third, to use appropriate strategies to moderate the
intensity and duration of their emotional responses; and fourth, to
become more accepting of negative emotional experiences within
their daily life (Gratz 2004).
Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) combines problem-solving
training, skills training, cognitive modification training and mind-
fulness techniques to encourage patients to accept their thoughts,
feelings, and behaviours without necessarily attempting to change,
suppress, or avoid these experiences (Lynch 2006; Washburn
2012). Within this framework, the aim of DBT is to help patients
better regulate their emotions, achieve a sense of interpersonal ef-
fectiveness, become more tolerant of distressing thoughts and feel-
ings, and become better at managing their own thoughts and be-
haviours (Linehan 1993b; Linehan 2007). The primary treatment
goals of DBT are therefore threefold: to reduce SH, to reduce be-
haviours that interfere with treatment success (e.g., treatment non-
adherence), and to reduce any other factors that may adversely
affect the patient’s quality of life (e.g., frequency and duration of
psychiatric hospitalisations) (Linehan 1993b). As the aim of DBT
is to help patients change or adjust to significant personality char-
acteristics, treatment is intensive and relatively prolonged.
Mentalisation refers to the ability to understand the actions of
both the self and of others as meaningful given knowledge of the
desires, beliefs, feelings, emotions, and motivations that under-
score their behaviour (Bateman 2004; Choi-Kain 2008). During
times of interpersonal stress, however, individuals may fail to rep-
resent experiences in terms of mental states and instead become
overwhelmed with negative thoughts and feelings about the self
(Rossouw 2013). Behaviours such as SH may then represent an
escape from these negative self-evaluations. Mentalisation therapy
aims to improve patients’ ability to empathise with others in or-
der to develop the ability to see how their own behaviours may
have an impact on the feelings of others, and to regulate their own
emotions more effectively (Rossouw 2013).
Case management
Case management in mental health services has mainly been de-
veloped for more severely ill patients. “In its simplest form . . . case
management is a means of co-ordinating services. Each . . . person
is assigned a ’case manager’ who is expected to assess that person’s
needs; develop a care plan; arrange for suitable care to be provided;
monitor the quality of the care provided; and maintain contact
with the person (Holloway 1991)” (Marshall 2000a, p. 2). Case
management might have a significant role in the aftercare of self-
harmpatientsbecause of the recognisedproblemof poor treatment
adherence in many patients and the heterogeneous nature of the
problems patients are often facing (Hawton 2003b; Lizardi 2010).
It has included, for example, provision of a care manager, crisis
intervention, problem solving, assistance with getting to clinical
9

 appointments, and assertive outreach, each provided according to
individual patient need (Morthorst 2012).
Treatment adherence enhancement approaches
These approaches include specific efforts to maintain contact with
patients, such as following up patients in the community who fail
to attend outpatient appointments (Van Heeringen 1995). It also
includes strategies to encourage adherence with treatment (Hvid
2011).
Having the same clinician who assessed a patient initially also pro-
viding any aftercare intervention may increase treatment adher-
ence and may also have an advantage in that the clinician is already
acquainted with the patient’s problems and needs.
Remote contact interventions
Remote contact interventions typically involve sending regular
letters or postcards to patients. Patients may view this kind of
intervention as a ’gesture of caring’ that may help to counteract
the sense of social isolation many SH patients experience (Cooper
2011). This sense of “social connectedness” may, in turn, have a
stabilising emotional effect (Motto 2001).
Another type of remote contact intervention involves the use of
emergency cards, which may encourage patients to seek help when
they feel distressed as well as offering provision for on-demand
emergency contact with psychiatric services (Kapur 2010).
The fact that in many countries most individuals have their own
general practitioner (GP) can also facilitate provision of care di-
rectly following SH. Interventions may include guidance for GPs
on treating and managing problems commonly experienced by SH
patients (e.g., depression, substance misuse, life problems). Such
advice may also include advising GPs on referral of SH patients to
local community services (Bennewith 2002).
Telephone contact with patients following discharge from hospital
can also help to ensure a continuing sense of contact with the
service and be used to provide advice and possibly psychotherapy.
The immediacy that psychotherapy by mobile telephone can
achieve, when compared with standard clinic-based psychother-
apy, may help with crisis management in times of distress
(Marasinghe 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
SH is a major social and healthcare problem. It is responsible for
significant morbidity, is often repeated, and has strong links to
suicide. It also leads to substantial healthcare costs (Sinclair 2011).
Many countries now have suicide prevention strategies (WHO
2014), which include a focus on improved management of pa-
tients presenting with SH due to their greatly elevated suicide
risk and their high levels of psychopathology and distress. The
National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England (Her Majesty’s
Government Department of Health 2012) and the US suicide
prevention strategy (Office of the Surgeon General 2012), for ex-
ample, highlight SH patients as a high risk group for special at-
tention.
In recent years there has been considerable focus on improving
the standards of general hospital care for SH patients. The Royal
College of Psychiatrists published consensus guidelines for such
services in 1994 and a further guideline in 2004 (Royal College
of Psychiatrists 1994; Royal College of Psychiatrists 2004). While
these guidelines focus particularly on organisation of services and
assessment of patients, there clearly also need to be effective treat-
ments for SH patients. These may include both psychosocial and
pharmacological interventions. In 2004 the National Institute for
Clinical Excellence (NICE) produced a guideline on self-harm,
which focused on its short-term physical and psychological man-
agement (NCCMH 2004). More recently, NICE produced a sec-
ond guide focused particularly on long-term management, using
some interim data from the present review as the evidence base for
therapeutic interventions (NICE 2011). A similar guideline was
produced in Australia and New Zealand (Boyce 2003). We had
previously conducted a systematic review of treatment interven-
tionsforSHpatientsintermsof reducingrepetition of SH(includ-
ing suicide); this review highlighted the paucity of evidence for ef-
fective treatments, at least in terms of this outcome (Hawton 1998;
Hawton 1999). The first NICE guideline essentially reinforced
this conclusion (NCCMH 2004). However, there was emerging
evidence for beneficial effects of short-term psychological therapy
on other outcomes (depression, hopelessness, and problem reso-
lution) (Townsend 2001). Using interim data from the present
review, the second NICE guideline concluded that there was ev-
idence showing clinical benefit of CBT-based psychotherapeutic
interventions in reducing repetition of self-harm, compared with
routine care (NICE 2011).
We have now fully updated our original review in order to pro-
vide current evidence to guide clinical policy and practice. Previ-
ous versions of this review included SH patients of any age and
both psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. We have
now divided this research into three separate reviews, one of in-
terventions in children and adolescents (Hawton 2015a), another
of pharmacological interventions in adults (Hawton 2015b), and
this, the third, focused on psychosocial interventions in adults. We
have also now included data on treatment adherence, depression,
hopelessness, problem-solving, and suicidal ideation.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials, including cluster-ran-
domised, multi-arm, and cross-over trials of specific psychoso-
cial interventions versus any comparator (e.g., treatment as usual
[TAU]/enhanced usual care [EUC]/other alternative forms of psy-
chotherapy) in the treatment of adult SH patients.
Types of participants
Participant characteristics
Participants were adult men and women (aged 18 and over) of all
ethnicities. We also included trials where there were a small mi-
nority (< 15%) of adolescent participants. However, we undertook
sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of including such studies.
Diagnosis
We included participants who had engaged in any type of non-fatal
intentional self-poisoning or self-injury in the six months prior to
trial entry resulting in presentation to clinical services. There were
no restrictions on the frequency with which patients engaged in
SH; thus, for example, we included trials where participants had
frequently repeated SH (e.g., those with self-harming behaviour
associated with borderline personality disorder).
We defined SH as any non-fatal intentional act of self-poisoning
or self-injury, irrespective of degree of suicidal intent or other types
of motivation. Thus we included acts intended to result in death
(attempted suicide), those without suicidal intent (e.g., to com-
municate distress, to temporarily reduce unpleasant feelings), and
those with mixed motivation. Self poisoning includes both over-
doses of medicinal drugs and ingestion of substances not intended
for consumption (e.g., pesticides). Self-injury includes acts such
as self-cutting, self-mutilation, attempted hanging, and jumping
in front of moving vehicles. We only included trials where partic-
ipants presented to clinical services as a result of SH.
Co-morbidities
There were norestrictionsonincludedpatientsintermsof whether
or not they had psychiatric disorders nor with regard to the nature
of those disorders, with the exception of intellectual disability, as
any SH behaviour is likely to be repetitive (e.g., head banging),
and the purpose of this behaviour is usually different from that
involved in SH (NICE 2011).
Setting
Interventions delivered in inpatient or outpatient settings were
eligible for inclusion, as were trials from any country.
Subset data
We did not include trials in which only some participants had
engaged in SH or trials in people with psychiatric disorders where
SH was an outcome variable but not an inclusion criterion for
entry into the trial.
Types of interventions
Comparisons included in this review were between any psychoso-
cial intervention and any comparator (e.g., TAU/EUC/other al-
ternative forms of psychotherapy, or placebo). As the trials in-
cluded in this review assessed a wide variety of interventions, we
developed categories or groups of interventions. This categorisa-
tion was based on consensus discussions within the review team
and included decisions about combining trials in which there were
superficial differences between treatments but the key method-
ologies between trials were similar. In some cases we sought more
details of the therapy from authors to assist this process. Categori-
sation reflected both prior views on types of psychotherapy and
the types of interventions that were identified as a result of the
systematic review of the literature.
Experimental interventions
These included:
1. CBT-based psychotherapy;
2. interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable
personality disorder;
3. case management;
4. treatment adherence enhancement approaches;
5. mixed multimodal interventions;
6. remote contact interventions;
7. other mixed interventions.
Comparator interventions
Treatment as usual
As treatment as usual (TAU) is likely to vary widely between set-
tings, following previous work we defined TAU as any care that
patient would receive had they not been included in the trial (i.e.,
routine care) (Hunt 2013).
Enhanced usual care
Enhanced usual care (EUC) refers to TAU that has in some way
been supplemented, for example through the provision of psycho-
11

 education, assertive outreach, or more regular contacts with case
managers.
Treatment by expert
This typically consists of a treatment by a widely recognised au-
thority with significant experience in treating individuals follow-
ing SH.
Other alternative forms of psychotherapy
This included other forms of psychotherapy designed to be of
lower duration or intensity than the experimental intervention and
could include:
1. brief or short-term psychotherapy;
2. standard case management;
3. standard dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT).
Discharge from hospital without further aftercare
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome measure in this review was the occurrence
of repeated SH (defined above) over a maximum follow-up period
of two years. Repetition was identified through at least one of the
following: self-report, collateral report, clinical records, or research
monitoring systems. As we wished to incorporate the maximum
amount of data from each trial, we included both self-reportedand
hospital records of SH where available. We also assessed frequency
of repetition of SH.
Secondary outcomes
1. Treatment adherence
Thiswasassessedusingarange of measuresof adherence, including
the proportion of participants that both started and completed
treatment, pill counts, and changes in blood measures.
2. Depression
This was assessed either continuously, as scores on psychometric
measures of depression symptoms (for example total scores on
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck 1961) or scores on the
depression sub-scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS; Zigmond 1983)), or dichotomously, as the proportion
of patients reaching defined diagnostic criteria for depression. We
included both patient- and clinician-reported instruments.
3. Hopelessness
This was assessed as scores on psychometric measures of hope-
lessness, for example total scores on the Beck Hopelessness Scale
(BHS; Beck 1974). We included both patient- and clinician-re-
ported instruments.
4. Suicidal ideation
This was assessed suicidal ideation either continuously, as scores on
psychometric measures (for example total scores on the Beck Scale
for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI; Beck 1988)), or dichotomously, as the
proportion of patients reaching a defined cut-off for ideation. We
included both patient- and clinician-reported instruments.
5. Problem solving
Problem solving ability was assessed either continuously, as scores
on psychometric measures (for example total scores on the Prob-
lem-Solving Inventory (PSI; Heppner 1988)), or dichotomously,
as the proportion of patients with improved problems. We in-
cluded both patient- and clinician-reported instruments.
6. Suicide
This included both register-recorded deaths and reports from col-
lateral informants such as family or neighbours.
Timing of the outcome assessment
We reported outcomes for the following time points.
1. At the conclusion of the treatment period.
2. Between 0 and 6 months after the conclusion of the
treatment period.
3. Between 6 and 12 months after the conclusion of the
treatment period.
4. Between 12 and 24 months after the conclusion of the
treatment period.
Hierarchy of outcome assessment
Where a trial measured the same outcome (e.g., depression) in two
or more ways, we used the most common measure across trials
in any meta-analysis, but we also reported scores from the other
measure in the text of the review.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
1. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review
Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)

Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CC-
DAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at their editorial base
in Bristol, UK: a references register and a studies-based register.
The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 39,500 re-
ports of randomised controlled trials on depression, anxiety and
neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged
to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CC-
DANCTR-Studies register and records are linked between the two
registers through the use of unique study ID tags. Coding of trials
is based on the EU-PSI Coding Manual. Please contact the CC-
DAN Trials Search Coordinator for further details.
Reports of trials for inclusion in the group’s registers are collated
from weekly generic searches of MEDLINE (1950 to date), EM-
BASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date), as well as
quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL).
We searched the CCDANCTR (Studies and References) database
on 29 April 2015 using terms for self-harm (condition only), as
outlined in Appendix 1.
We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status
to the search.
2. Additional electronic database searches
Sarah Stockton, librarian at the University of Oxford, conducted
earlier searches (1998 to October 2013) of MEDLINE, EMBASE,
PsycINFO and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), following the
search strategy outlined in Appendix 2. As the CCDANCTR al-
ready contains relevant reports of RCTs from these databases, it
was unnecessary to re-search these. Additionally, KW searched the
Australian Suicide Prevention RCT Database (Christensen 2014).
KW also conducted electronic searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and
the ISRCTN registry using the keywords random* AND suicide
attempt* OR self$harm* to identify relevant ongoing trials.
Both the original version of this review as well as an unpublished
version also incorporated searches of the following databases:
SIGLE (1980 to March 2005) and SocioFile (1963 to July 2006).
We updated the search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN
registry to 29 April 2015.

We checked the reference lists of all relevant papers known to our
review team as well as the reference lists of major reviews that in-
clude a focus on interventions for SH patients (Baldessarini 2003;

Correspondence
We consulted trial authors and other experts in the field of suicidal
behaviour to find out if they were aware of any ongoing or un-
published RCTs concerning the use of psychosocial interventions
for adult SH patients.
Data collection and analysis
For details of the data collection and analysis methods used in the
original version of this review, see Appendix 4.
Selection of studies
For this review update all review authors independently assessed
the titles of trials identified by the systematic search for eligibility.
A distinction was made between:
1. eligible trials that compared any psychosocial intervention
with a control (e.g., treatment as usual (TAU), enhanced usual
care (EUC), or other alternative forms of psychotherapy);
2. general treatment trials (without any control treatment).
All trials identified as potentially eligible for inclusion underwent a
second screening. Pairs of review authors, working independently
from one another, screened the full text of relevant trials to identify
whether the trials met our inclusion criteria.
We resolved disagreements following consultation with KH.
Where we could not resolve disagreements based on the informa-
tion reported within the trial, or where it was unclear whether
the trial satisfied our inclusion criteria, we contacted authors to
provide additional clarification.
Data extraction and management
In the current update, KW and one other author (TTS, EA, DG,
PH, ET or KvH) independently extracted data from included
trials using a standardised extraction form. In case of disagreement,
authors resolved them through consensus discussions with KH.
13
Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Data extracted from each eligible trial included participant demo-
graphics, details of the treatment and control interventions, and
information on the outcome measures used to evaluate the efficacy
of the intervention. We contacted study authors to obtain raw data
for outcomes that were not reported in the full text of included
trials.
We extracted both dichotomous and continuous outcome data
from eligible trials. As the use of non-validated psychometric scales
is associated with bias, we extracted continuous data only if the
psychometric scale used to measure the outcome of interest had
been previously published in a peer-reviewed journal and was not
subjected to item, scoring, or other modification by the trial au-
thors (Marshall 2000b).
We planned the following main comparisons.
1. CBT-based psychotherapy versus TAU or other alternative
forms of psychotherapy.
2. Interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable
personality disorder versus TAU or other alternative forms of
psychotherapy.
3. Case management versus TAU or other alternative forms of
psychotherapy.
4. Treatment adherence enhancement approaches versus TAU
or other alternative forms of psychotherapy.
5. Mixed multimodal interventions versus TAU or other
alternative forms of psychotherapy.
6. Remote contact interventions versus TAU or other
alternative forms of psychotherapy.
7. Other mixed interventions versus TAU or other alternative
forms of psychotherapy.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Given that highly biased trials are more likely to overestimate treat-
ment effectiveness (Moher 1998), KW and one of TTS, EA, DG,
PH, ET or KvH independently evaluated the quality of included
trials by using the criteria described in Higgins 2008a. This tool
encourages consideration of the following domains:
1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants and personnel.
4. Blinding of outcome assessment.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias.
We judged each source of potential bias as conferring low, high
or unclear risk of bias, and we incorporated a supporting quota-
tion from the report to justify this judgment. Where the original
report provided inadequate details of the randomisation, blind-
ing, or outcome assessment procedures, we contacted authors for
clarification. We resolved disagreements through discussion with
KH and reported risk of bias for each included trial in the text of
the review. For cluster-randomised and cross-over trials, we used
appropriate methods of assessing bias as outlined in Higgins 2011,
sections 16.3.2 and 16.4.3.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous outcomes
We summarised dichotomous outcomes, such as the number of
participants engaging in a repeat SH episode and the number
of deaths by suicide, using summary odds ratios (OR) and the
accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI), as the OR is the
most appropriate effect size statistic for summarising associations
between two dichotomous groups (Fleiss 1994).
Continuous outcomes
For outcomes reported on a continuous scale, we used mean dif-
ferences (MD) and accompanying 95% CI where trials employed
the same outcome measure. Where studies used different scales to
assess a given outcome, we used the standardised mean difference
(SMD) and its accompanying 95% CI.
We only aggregated trials for the purposes of meta-analysis if treat-
ments were sufficiently similar. For trials that could not be in-
cluded in a meta-analysis, we have instead provided narrative de-
scriptions of the results.
Unit of analysis issues
Zelen design trials
Trials in this area increasingly employ Zelen’s method, in which
investigators obtain consent after randomisation and treatment
allocation. This design may lead to bias if, for example, partici-
pants allocated to one particular arm of the trial disproportionally
refuse to provide consent for participation or, alternatively, if par-
ticipants only provide consent provided they are allowed to cross
over to the active treatment arm (Torgerson 2004). We included
four trials that employed Zelen’s method in this review (Carter
2005; Hatcher 2011; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015). Given the
uncertainty of whether to use data for the primary outcome based
on all those randomised to the trial, or only those who consented
to participation, we extracted data for the primary outcome mea-
sure using both sources where possible. We also conducted sensi-
tivity analyses by excluding these trials to investigate what impact,
if any, their inclusion had on the pooled estimate of treatment
effectiveness.
Cluster-randomised trials
Cluster randomisation, for example by clinician or general prac-
tice, can lead to overestimation of the significance of a treatment
effect, resulting in an inflation of the nominal type I error rate,
14

 unless there is appropriate adjustment for the effects of cluster-
ing (Donner 2002; Kerry 1998). We planned to statistically ad-
just for the effects of clustering following the guidance outlined
in Higgins 2008b, section 16.3.4. Clustering was an issue in one
included study (Bennewith 2002); however, we were unable to
adjust for the effects of clustering in subsequent analyses as the
study authors could not provide us with either the intercluster co-
efficient or the design effect.
Cross-over trials
A primary concern with cross-over trials is the ’carry-over’ effect,
in which the effect of the intervention treatment (e.g., pharma-
cological, physiological, or psychological) influences the partic-
ipant’s response to the subsequent control condition (Elbourne
2002). As a consequence, on entry to the second phase of the trial
participants may differ systematically from their initial state de-
spite a wash-out phase. This, in turn, may result in a concomitant
underestimation of the effectiveness of the treatment intervention
(Curtin 2002a; Curtin 2002b). One trial included in the current
update used cross-over methodology (i.e., Marasinghe 2012). To
protect against the carry-over effect, we only extracted data from
the first phase of this trial, prior to cross-over.
Studies with multiple treatment groups
Two trials in the current review included multiple treatment
groups(Stewart 2009; Wei2013). Asboth interventionarmsinthe
Stewart 2009 trial investigated the effectiveness of CBT-based psy-
chotherapy, we combined dichotomous data from these two arms
and compared them with data from the TAU arm. For outcomes
reported on a continuous scale, we combined data using the for-
mula given in Higgins 2011, section 7.7.3.8. Wei 2013 compared
two different psychotherapies with TAU, namely CBT-based psy-
chotherapy and telephone contact. Therefore we included this trial
in both categories of intervention using the data from the relevant
experimental arm. As we did not combine these interventions in
any meta-analysis, we used the same TAU data for both analyses.
Studies with adjusted effect size estimates
None of the trials included in the current update calculated ad-
justed effect sizes. In future updates of this review, however, where
trials report both unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes, we will in-
clude only unadjusted effect sizes.
Dealing with missing data
We asreviewauthorsdidnotimpute missingdata,aswe considered
that the bias that would be introduced by doing this would have
outweighed any benefit (in terms of increased statistical power)
that may have been gained by the inclusion of imputed data. How-
ever, where authors omitted standard deviations (SD) for contin-
uous measures, we estimated these using the method described in
Townsend 2001.
Dichotomous data
Although many authors conducted their own intention-to-treat
analyses, few presented intention-to-treat analyses as defined by
Higgins 2008b. Therefore, we based outcome analyses for both
dichotomous and continuous data on all information available on
trial participants. For dichotomous outcomes, we included data
on only those participants whose results were known, using as the
denominator the total number of participants with data for the
particular outcome of interest, as recommended (Higgins 2008b).
Continuous data
For continuous outcomes, we included data only on observed
cases.
Missing data
Where data on outcomes of interest were incomplete or excluded
from the text of the trial, we contacted authors to request further
information.
Assessment of heterogeneity
It is possible to assess between-study heterogeneity using either
the Chi2 or I2 statistic. In this review, however, we used only the
I2 statistic to determine heterogeneity, as Higgins 2003 considers
this to be more reliable. The I2 statistic indicates the percentage
of between-study variation due to chance and can take any value
from 0% to 100% (Higgins 2003). We used the following val-
ues to denote unimportant, moderate, substantial, and consider-
able heterogeneity, respectively: 0% to 40%, 30% to 60%, 50%
to 90%, and 75% to 100% as per the guidance in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2008, sec-
tion 9.5.2). Where we found substantial levels of heterogeneity
(i.e., ≥ 75%), we explored possible reasons. We also planned to
investigate heterogeneity even when the I2 statistic was lower than
75% but either the direction or magnitude of a trial effect size was
clearly discrepant from that of other trials included in the meta-
analysis (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
section for further information on these analyses).
We also report heterogeneity in the results section but only when
we observed substantial levels, as indicated by an I2 statistic of
75% or greater.
Assessment of reporting biases
Reporting bias occurs when the direction and significance of a
particular trial’s results influence the decision to publish a report
on it (Egger 1997). Research suggests, for example, that trials with
statistically significant findings are more likely to be submitted and
15

 subsequently accepted for publication (Hopewell 2009), leading
to possible overestimation of the true treatment effect. To assess
whether trials included in any meta-analysis were affected by re-
porting bias, we entered data into a funnel plot but only, as recom-
mended, when a meta-analysis included results of at least 10 trials.
Where evidence of any small-study effects were identified, we ex-
plored reasons for funnel plot asymmetry, including the presence
of publication bias (Egger 1997).
Data synthesis
For the purposes of meta-analysis, we calculated the pooled OR
and accompanying 95% CI using the random-effects model, as
this is the most appropriate model for incorporating heterogeneity
betweentrials(Deeks2008, section9.5.4). Specifically, we usedthe
Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous data and the inverted
variance method for continuous data. However, we also undertook
a fixed-effect analysis to investigate the potential effect of method
choice on the estimates of treatment effect.We descriptively report
any material differences in ORs between these two methods in the
text of the review. All analyses were conducted in Review Manager,
version 5 (RevMan 2014).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Subgroup analyses
In the original version of this review, we planned to undertake sub-
group analyses by repeater status (i.e., history of multiple episodes
of SH vs first known episode of SH) and gender but found there
were insufficient data. Consequently, in this update we only un-
dertook a priori subgroup analyses by sex or repeater status where
there were sufficient data to do so.
Investigation of heterogeneity
Where meta-analyses were associated with substantial levels of be-
tween-study heterogeneity (i.e., as indicated by an I2 statistic ≥
75%), KH and KW first independently triple-checked the data to
ensure that the review team had correctly entered the data. Assum-
ing this was the case, we investigated the source of heterogeneity by
visually inspecting the forest plot and removing each trial that had
a very different result from the general pattern of the others until
homogeneity was restored as indicted by an I2 statistic < 75%.
We have reported the results of this sensitivity analysis in the text
of the review alongside hypotheses regarding the likely causes of
heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analysis
We undertook sensitivity analyses, where appropriate, as outlined
below.
1. Trial/s that used Zelen’s method of randomisation (see Unit
of analysis issues section).
2. Trial/s that contributed substantial levels of between-study
heterogeneity (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of
heterogeneity section).
3. Trial/s that included some adolescent participants.
4. Trial/s that specifically recruited individuals diagnosed with
borderline personality disorder.
Summary of findings table
We prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table for the primary out-
come measure, repetition of SH, following recommendations out-
lined in Schünemann 2008a, section 11.5. This table provides in-
formation concerning the overall quality of evidence from each
included trial. We prepared the ’Summary of findings’ table using
GRADEpro software (GRADE profiler). We assessed quality of
the evidence following recommendations in Schünemann 2008b,
section 12.2.

Description of studies
Results of the search
In this update, the search strategy outlined in Appendix 1 and
Appendix 2 yielded a total of 23,725 citations. We identified a
further 10 trials that were ongoing at the time of the systematic
search through correspondence and discussion with researchers in
the field. All have subsequently been published.
In consultation with CCDAN, we divided the original review
(Hawton 1998; Hawton 1999) into three separate reviews: the
present review focuses on psychosocial interventions for adults, a
second review deals with pharmacological interventions for adults
(Hawton 2015b), and the third assesses interventions for children
and adolescents (Hawton 2015a). Nine of the additional 10 trials
evaluated psychosocial interventions for adults, and were therefore
included in the present update. The remaining trial evaluated an
intervention for children and adolescents; this is included in the
related relevant review (i.e., Hawton 2015a).
After deduplication, the initial number of citations decreased to
16,700. Of these, we excluded 16,459 after screening the titles and
abstracts and a further 217 after reviewing the full texts (Figure
1).

 Included studies
In the previous versions of this review (Hawton 1998; Hawton
1999; NICE 2011), we included 36 trials of psychosocial in-
terventions for adults following SH (Allard 1992; Bateman
2009; Bennewith 2002; Brown 2005; Carter 2005; Cedereke
2002; Clarke 2002; Dubois 1999; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b;

2006; Van der Sande 1997a; Van Heeringen 1995; Waterhouse
1990; Weinberg 2006; Welu 1977). The present update in-
cluded information from an additional 19 trials (Beautrais 2010;
Crawford 2010; Davidson 2014; Gratz 2014; Harned 2014;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015;

2014; Marasinghe 2012; McAuliffe 2014; Morthorst 2012; Priebe
2012; Tapolaa 2010; Wei 2013). The present review there-
fore included 55 non-overlapping trials. Five further follow-up
studies (i.e., Bertolote 2010; Hassanzadeh 2010; McMain 2012,
Vijayakumar 2011 and Xu 2012) provide additional data for two
of these trials (Fleischmann 2008; McMain 2009).
We obtained unpublished data from corresponding authors from
a further 36 trials (Bateman 2009; Beautrais 2010; Bennewith
2002; Brown 2005; Carter 2005; Cedereke 2002; Clarke 2002;

2010; Turner 2000; Tyrer 2003; Vaiva 2006; Wei 2013; Weinberg
2006).
We also identified 16 ongoing trials of psychosocial interventions
following SH in adults (see Characteristics of ongoing studies sec-
tion for further information on these trials).
Design
Study authors described all 55 independent trials as randomised
controlled trials (RCTs). Most (number of studies k = 49; 89.1%)
employed a simple randomisation procedure based on individual
allocation to the intervention and control groups. Zelen’s post-
randomisation consent design was used in four trials (Carter 2005;
Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher 2011), a cluster-randomi-
sation procedure in one (Bennewith 2002), and a matched pair
randomisation procedure in another (Cedereke 2002).
Participants
The included trials comprised a total of 17,699 participants. All
had engaged in at least one episode of SH in the six months prior
to randomisation.
Participant characteristics
In the 39 trials that recorded information on age, the average age
of participants at randomisation was 30.9 years (SD 4.6). Twenty
trials included a small number of adolescent participants (i.e., un-
der 18 years of age at randomisation) (Carter 2005; Dubois 1999;
Evans 1999b; Gibbons 1978; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011;
Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher 2011; Hawton 1987a;
Husain 2014; Hvid 2011; Marasinghe 2012; McLeavey 1994;
Morthorst 2012; Priebe 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Slee 2008; Van
der Sande 1997a; Van Heeringen 1995; Wei 2013). However, in-
vestigators did not record the precise number in any of them. As
the majority of participants in these trials were adults, we included
them in the present review rather than in the related review spe-
cific to interventions for children and adolescents (i.e., Hawton
2015a). The majority of the sample was female in the 46 trials that
recorded information on sex (k = 46; mean 69.2%), reflecting the
typical pattern for SH (Hawton 2008).
Diagnosis
In all trials, a recent episode of SH was a requirement for trial entry.
SH includes intentional acts of self-harm (i.e., self-poisoning or
self-injury) and not acts such as recreational use of drugs that may
result in accidental harm.
A history of multiple episodes of SH was a requirement for par-
ticipation in 13 trials (Evans 1999b; Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014;
Harned 2014; Liberman 1981; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006;
McMain 2009; Priebe 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Torhorst 1988;
Tyrer 2003; Weinberg 2006). For an additional 28 trials, over
half the sample had a history of multiple episodes of SH (Allard
1992; Bateman 2009; Beautrais 2010; Bennewith 2002; Brown
2005; Carter 2005; Cedereke 2002; Crawford 2010; Davidson
2014; Dubois 1999; Gibbons 1978; Guthrie 2001; Hatcher
2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher 2011; Husain 2014; Kapur 2013a;
Marasinghe 2012; McAuliffe 2014; McLeavey 1994; Morthorst
2012; Patsiokas 1985; Slee 2008; Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010;
Turner 2000; Wei 2013; Welu 1977). In four further trials, just
under half of the sample had a history of multiple episodes of
SH (Clarke 2002: 47.0%; Evans 1999a: 47.6%; Kawanishi 2014:
49.2%; Van der Sande 1997a: 46.3%). We present the propor-
tion with a prior history of SH in the remaining eight trials in
Table 1. Morgan 1993 excluded those with a history of multiple
episodes of SH from participation, whilst Torhorst 1987 provided
18

 no information on the proportion of the sample with a history of
multiple episodes of SH.
In around half of the included trials (k = 25; 45.4%), the au-
thors stated either within the trial report or through correspon-
dence that they included participants irrespective of whether or
not the episode of SH involved suicidal intent (Bateman 2009;
Beautrais 2010; Bennewith 2002; Clarke 2002; Davidson 2014;
Fleischmann 2008; Harned 2014; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015;
Hatcher 2011; Hawton 1981; Hawton 1987a; Hvid 2011; Kapur
2013a; Liberman 1981; Linehan 2006; McAuliffe 2014; McMain
2009; Patsiokas 1985; Slee 2008; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst 1987;
Turner 2000; Tyrer 2003; Van Heeringen 1995; Waterhouse
1990). Seven trials included participants following a ’suicide at-
tempt’ (i.e., suggestive of evidence of suicidal intent) (Allard 1992;
Cedereke 2002; Morthorst 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Torhorst 1988;
Van derSande 1997a; Wei2013). A further five trials included par-
ticipants only if there had been evidence of suicidal intent (Brown
2005; Kawanishi 2014; Marasinghe 2012; Stewart 2009; Welu
1977), whilst in an additional two, the majority of participants
(76.5% and 74.0% respectively) expressed a wish to die (Guthrie
2001; Husain 2014). Gratz 2014 included participants only if
there was no evidence of suicidal intent, whilst only 2.0% in one
trial expressed a wish to die (Vaiva 2006). Thirteen trials did not re-
port information on suicidal intent (Carter 2005; Crawford 2010;
Dubois 1999; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b; Gibbons 1978; Gratz
2006; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Linehan 1991; McLeavey
1994; Morgan 1993; Priebe 2012; Weinberg 2006).
Twenty-five trials did not report information on the meth-
ods of SH for the index episode (Allard 1992; Bateman 2009;
Cedereke 2002; Davidson 2014; Dubois 1999; Evans 1999b;
Fleischmann 2008; Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014; Hvid 2011; Kapur
2013a; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006; Marasinghe 2012; McMain
2009; Morthorst 2012; Patsiokas 1985; Priebe 2012; Salkovskis
1990; Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010; Turner 2000; Tyrer 2003; Wei
2013; Weinberg 2006). One trial provided information on the
methods used in all episodes of SH (including the index episode)
in the two years preceding trial entry (Liberman 1981). A total
of 55.7% of these episodes involved self-poisoning and 44.3% in-
volved self-injury. One additional trial provided information on
methods used in the three months prior to trial entry with a total
of 61 (67.8%) participants in this trial engaging in self-injury at
least once over this period; however, investigators did not specify
the methods that the remaining 29 participants used for SH (Slee
2008). We present methods of SH for the remaining 28 trials in
Table 2. In these trials, the majority of participants had engaged
in self-poisoning (k = 28; 79.9%). Two trials included only those
who engaged in self-injury (Harned 2014; Welu 1977), whilst in
a further trial the majority of participants (75.6%) had engaged
in self-poisoning using pesticides (Husain 2014).
Comorbidities
We present information on current psychiatric diagnoses for all 55
trials in Table 3. Eight trials focused specifically on participants
diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (Bateman 2009;
Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006; McMain
2009; Turner 2000; Weinberg 2006), three focused on partici-
pants diagnosed with any personality disorder (Davidson 2014;
Evans 1999b; Priebe 2012), one focused specifically on partici-
pants diagnosed with alcohol use (Crawford 2010), and one fo-
cused on participants with comorbid post-traumatic stress disor-
der and borderline personality disorder (Harned 2014).
Details on comorbid diagnoses were not reported in the majority
of trials (k = 49; 89.1%) (Allard 1992; Bateman 2009; Beautrais
2010; Bennewith 2002; Cedereke 2002; Clarke 2002; Crawford
2010; Dubois 1999; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b; Fleischmann
2008; Gibbons 1978; Gratz 2006; Guthrie 2001; Harned 2014;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015;
Hatcher 2011; Hawton 1981; Hawton 1987a; Husain 2014;
Hvid 2011; Kapur 2013a; Kawanishi 2014; Liberman 1981;
Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006; Marasinghe 2012; McAuliffe 2014;
McLeavey 1994; Morgan 1993; Morthorst 2012; Patsiokas 1985;
Priebe 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010;
Torhorst 1987; Torhorst 1988; Turner 2000; Tyrer 2003; Vaiva
2006; Van der Sande 1997a; Van Heeringen 1995; Waterhouse
1990; Wei 2013; Weinberg 2006; Welu 1977). In Brown 2005,
most participants (85.0%) were diagnosed with more than one
psychiatric disorder; however, the authors did not provide infor-
mation on specific diagnoses. In an additional three trials (Carter
2005; McMain 2009; Slee 2008), the median number of psychi-
atric diagnoses was greater than two, suggesting that participants
in these trials were also diagnosed with more than one psychiatric
disorder; however, none of the three reported further information
on specific diagnoses. In one trial, 45.0% of the participants were
diagnosed with comorbid personality disorder and substance mis-
use (Davidson 2014), whilst in another, just under half of the sam-
ple (45.9%) had a comorbid personality diagnosis (Gratz 2014).
Setting
Of the 55 independent RCTs included in this review, most took
place in the United Kingdom (k = 17) or the United States (k =
12), followed by New Zealand (k = 4), Australia (k = 2), Canada
(k = 2), Denmark (k = 2), France (k = 2), Germany (k = 2),
the Netherlands (k = 2), and one each from Belgium, China,
Finland, Iran, Japan, Pakistan, the Republic of Ireland, Sri Lanka,
and Sweden. One trial was a multicentre study conducted in a
number of countries.
Interventions
The trials included in this review investigated the effectiveness of
various forms of psychosocial intervention.

Outcomes
Information on the primary outcome, repetition of SH, was avail-
able for all but one of the included trials (Patsiokas 1985). In
the case of four trials, we obtained information on this out-
come following correspondence with authors (Marasinghe 2012;
McAuliffe 2014; McMain 2009; Tapolaa 2010). For around half
of the trials (k = 24; 43.6%), information on repetition of SH
was based on self-report (Brown 2005; Cedereke 2002; Davidson
2014; Evans 1999b; Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014; Harned 2014;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hawton 1981; Hawton 1987a;
Husain 2014; Liberman 1981; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006;
McMain 2009; Priebe 2012; Slee 2008; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst
1988; Turner 2000; Vaiva 2006; Van Heeringen 1995; Wei 2013;
Weinberg 2006), whilst in a further eight trials, collateral re-
ports, hospital/clinical records, or both supplemented the self-
reported information (Allard 1992; Bateman 2009; Bennewith
2002; Fleischmann 2008; Guthrie 2001; Hvid 2011; Morthorst
2012; Tyrer 2003). In 11 trials, information on repetition of SH
was based on hospital re-presentations (Beautrais 2010; Carter
2005; Clarke 2002; Crawford 2010; Evans 1999a; Hatcher 2016a;
Hatcher 2015; Hatcher 2011; Kapur 2013a; Waterhouse 1990;
Welu 1977), whilst in three others, investigators obtained the
information from hospital or medical records (Gibbons 1978;
Morgan 1993; Van der Sande 1997a). McLeavey 1994 used col-
lateral records supplemented by hospital records to determine
repetition of SH. McAuliffe 2014 used mixed methods to de-
termine repetition of SH, using self-reported information at the
post-intervention and six-month follow-up assessments and data
on hospital re-presentations at the 12 month follow-up assess-
ment. Patsiokas 1985 did not report information on repetition
of SH, and our review team was unable to obtain this infor-
mation through correspondence. The remaining seven trials pro-
vided no details about the source of the data on repetition of
SH (Dubois 1999; Kawanishi 2014; Marasinghe 2012; Salkovskis
1990; Stewart 2009; Torhorst 1987).
The 19trialsthatrecordedinformationon treatmentadherence as-
sessed this using a variety of methods, including: the proportion of
participants who completed the full course of treatment (Bateman
2009; Harned 2014; Husain 2014; Linehan 1991; McMain 2009;
Priebe 2012; Slee 2008; Torhorst 1987; Turner 2000), the propor-
tion of participants who attended at least one treatment session
(Bennewith 2002; Cedereke 2002; Hawton 1981), and the num-
ber of treatment sessions attended (Brown 2005; Evans 1999b;
Van Heeringen 1995). Three trials assessed treatment adherence
using both the proportion of participants that completed the full
course of treatment and the total number of treatment sessions at-
tended (McAuliffe 2014; McLeavey 1994; Torhorst 1988), whilst
the remaining trial assessed treatment adherence using both the
proportion of participants who attended at least one treatment
session and the total number of treatment sessions attended (Van
der Sande 1997a).
Investigators assessed depression using the BDI in 13 trials
(Bateman 2009; Fleischmann2008; Gibbons 1978; Guthrie 2001;
Hawton 1987a; Husain 2014; Linehan 1991; Marasinghe 2012;
McAuliffe 2014; McMain 2009; Salkovskis 1990; Slee 2008;
Tapolaa 2010), the HamiltonRatingScale forDepression(HRSD;
Hamilton 1960) in 3 trials (Harned 2014; Linehan 2006; Wei
2013), both the BDI and HRSD in 1 trial (Turner 2000), the De-
pression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond 1995) in 2 trials
(Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery 1979) in 1 trial (Van der
Sande 1997a), the depression sub-scale of the HADS in 6 trials
(Davidson 2014; Evans 1999b; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015;
Hatcher 2011; Tyrer 2003), both the BDI and the HRSD in 1 trial
(Brown 2005), and both the BDI and the Zung Self-Rating De-
pression Scale (ZSRDS; Zung 1965) in a further trial (Liberman
1981). In one trial it was not clear what scale the researchers used
to assess depression (Torhorst 1988).
All 14 trials that recorded information on hopelessness assessed
this using the BHS (Brown 2005; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015;
Hatcher 2011; Husain 2014; Kawanishi 2014; Linehan 1991;
McAuliffe 2014; McLeavey 1994; Patsiokas 1985; Salkovskis
1990; Stewart 2009; Van der Sande 1997a; Waterhouse 1990).
Ten trials assessed suicidal ideation using the BSSI (Cedereke
2002; Davidson 2014; Guthrie 2001; Hatcher 2011; Husain

 2014; Marasinghe 2012; McAuliffe 2014; Patsiokas 1985; Stewart
2009; Turner 2000), two trials used the Suicide Behaviors Ques-
tionnaire (SBQ; Linehan 1981) (Linehan 2006; Weinberg 2006),
one trial used the Scale for Suicidal Ideators (SSI; Schotte 1982)
(Linehan 1991), and one the suicidal ideation sub-scale of the
Psychiatric Status Schedule (PSS; Spitzer 1970) (Waterhouse
1990). Three trials measured suicidal ideation dichotomously as
the proportion with self-reported suicidal ideation (Hassanian-
Moghaddam 2011; Liberman 1981; Wei 2013).
Hatcher 2011 assessed problem-solving using the Social Prob-
lem-Solving Inventory-Revised (SPSI-R; D’Zurilla 1996); Husain
2014 used the Coping Resource Inventory (CRI; Marting 1988);
Patsiokas 1985, the Means-Ends Problem Solving test (MEPS;
Maydeu-Olivares 1996); Salkovskis 1990, the Personal Ques-
tionnaire Rapid Scaling Technique (PQRST; Mulhall 1977);
McAuliffe 2014 and McLeavey 1994, both the MEPS and Self-
RatedProblemSolvingScale (SRPSS; McLeavey 1987); Slee2008,
the oriented coping subscale of the Coping Inventory for Stress-
ful Situations (CISS; Endler 1994); and Fleischmann 2008 (at
one site of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) multisite
trial SUPRE-MISS, as reported in Xu 2012), the problem-solv-
ing sub-scale of an idiosyncratic problem-solving questionnaire.
Gibbons 1978 and Hawton 1987a measured problem-solving di-
chotomously as the proportion of participants self-reporting im-
proved problems at follow-up.
In about half of the 44 trials (k = 24; 54.5%) that recorded in-
formation on completed suicide, the method used to assess this
outcome was unclear (Bateman 2009; Beautrais 2010; Brown
2005; Clarke 2002; Davidson 2014; Dubois 1999; Gratz 2006;
Gratz 2014; Guthrie 2001; Harned 2014; Husain 2014; Kapur
2013a; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006; Marasinghe 2012; McMain
2009; McLeavey 1994; Priebe 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Slee 2008;
Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst 1987; Weinberg 2006). In
the 20 remaining trials, investigators used a variety of methods to
assess completed suicide, including: collateral reports (Crawford
2010; Fleischmann 2008; Hawton 1987a; Wei 2013), Coroner’s
records (Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher 2011; Hvid
2011; Tyrer 2003), hospital records, medical records or both
(McAuliffe 2014; Morthorst 2012), mortality statistics (Carter
2005; Cedereke 2002; Kawanishi 2014; Van Heeringen 1995),
collateral reports supplemented by medical records or Coroner’s
records (Allard 1992; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011), collateral re-
port supplemented by mortality statistics (Van der Sande 1997a),
hospital records, medical records or both, supplemented by mor-
tality statistics (Vaiva 2006), or mortality statistics supplemented
by Coroner’s records (Evans 1999a).
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 217 articles from this update: 94 in which
not all participants engaged in SH; 60 that used a non-randomised
clinical trial design; 27 that were reviews, editorials, letters to the
editor, or conference proceedings; 23 that were trial protocols; 11
where SH could have occurred at any point rather than within six
months of randomisation; one that only presented data from one
trial arm (although a related publication that presented data for
both the intervention and control arms was eligible for inclusion),
and one that reported data reported for a period beyond two years
(although articles reporting data for earlier follow-up periods for
this trial were eligible for inclusion).
We excluded one trial that had been included in the original ver-
sion of this review following advice from CCDAN due to bias in
the method used to randomise participants to the intervention and
control groups (Chowdhury 1973). We also had to exclude one
further trial that otherwise met inclusion criteria for this review as
correspondence with authors revealed that information on non-
fatal SH could not be disaggregated from information on com-
pleted suicide (Chen 2013).
We provide details on the reasons for excluding 52 trials
clearly related to psychosocial interventions for suicidality in the
Characteristics of excluded studies section.
Ongoing studies
We identified a total of 20 ongoing trials of psychosocial inter-
ventions for SH in adults. We provide full details of these trials in
the Characteristics of ongoing studies section. We note that one of
these trials has subsequently been terminated owing to the resigna-
tion of key clinical staff and a lack of ongoing funding (Agyapong
2013).
Studies awaiting classification
Four potentially relevant trials are currently awaiting assessment
(see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table), two of
DBT (Andreasson 2016; Linehan 2015), one of a mixed multi-
modal intervention combining face-to-face psychosocial therapy
with a remote contact intervention (Gysin-Maillart 2016) and one
trial testing the effectiveness of implementation intentions (vo-
litional help sheet) in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviour
(Armitage 2016).
Risk of bias in included studies
We present summaries of the overall risk of bias for the included
trials in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Risk of bias for each included trial
is also considered within the text of the review.

 Allocation
Sequence generation
All of the 55 independent trials used random allocation. We
considered the majority (k = 40; 72.7%) to have a low risk
of bias for this item. In most trials a computer-generated ran-
domisation sequence was used to allocate adults to the experi-
mental and control groups (Beautrais 2010; Brown 2005; Carter
2005; Guthrie 2001; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher
2011; Husain 2014; Kapur 2013a; Kawanishi 2014; Linehan
1991; Linehan 2006; McAuliffe 2014; Morthorst 2012; Priebe
2012; Slee 2008; Tyrer 2003; Vaiva 2006; Van der Sande 1997a;
Wei 2013). In two trials a minimisation algorithm was used
to allocate participants to the experimental and control groups
(Bateman 2009; Harned 2014) whilst in one a pre-generated
block randomisation procedure was used (McMain 2009). In
the remaining trials a variety of other randomisation procedures
were used, including: a random numbers table (Bennewith 2002;
Clarke 2002; Crawford 2010; Davidson 2014; Fleischmann 2008;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hawton 1981; Hawton 1987a;
Welu 1977), shuffled envelopes (Gibbons 1978; Morgan 1993;
Salkovskis 1990; Waterhouse 1990; Weinberg 2006), numbers
drawn from a hat (Stewart 2009), and coin tossing (Tapolaa 2010).
In one trial details on the method used to allocate participants to
the invention and control groups were not provided, but the au-
thors undertook post hoc analyses to investigate the distribution
of various pre-treatment factors and found no significant differ-
ence in the distribution of these factors between the two groups,
suggesting that the randomisation procedure used was unbiased
(Turner 2000). We therefore also rated this trial as having low risk
of bias for this item.
We rated 13 trials (23.6%) as having unclear risk of bias for se-
quence generation, as study authors provided no information on
the method used to allocate participants to the experimental and
control groups (Cedereke 2002; Dubois 1999; Gratz 2006; Gratz
2014; Hvid 2011; Liberman 1981; Marasinghe 2012; Patsiokas
1985; Torhorst 1987; Torhorst 1988). In an additional three trials
opaque, sealed envelopes were used, but it was unclear whether
these were shuffled to ensure random sequence generation (Allard
1992; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b). We rated the two remaining
trials as having high risk of bias for this item, as investigators used
an open numbers table to allocate participants to the experimental
and control groups (McLeavey 1994; Van Heeringen 1995).
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
We considered just over half of the included trials to be at
low risk of bias for allocation concealment (k = 31; 56.4%). A
third-party researcher working independently of the trial team
handled allocation in nine trials (Beautrais 2010; Bennewith
2002; Clarke 2002; Guthrie 2001; Harned 2014; Hassanian-
Moghaddam 2011; Hvid 2011; Morthorst 2012; Vaiva 2006),
14 trials used opaque, sealed envelopes (Allard 1992; Cedereke
2002; Crawford 2010; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b; Gibbons 1978;
Hawton 1981; Hawton 1987a; McMain 2009; Morgan 1993;
Salkovskis 1990; Waterhouse 1990; Weinberg 2006; Van der
Sande 1997a), and a remote/offsite researcher allocated partic-
ipants in six trials (Bateman 2009; Fleischmann 2008; Husain
2014; Kawanishi 2014; Slee 2008; Tyrer 2003). In the one re-
maining trial information was not provided on the method used
to conceal allocation, but correspondence with authors confirmed
that they had adequately concealed allocation (Linehan 1991).
We rated a total of 18 trials (32.7%) as having unclear risk of bias
for this item, as they provided no information on the method used
to conceal allocation (Brown 2005; Davidson 2014; Dubois 1999;
Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014; Kapur 2013a; Liberman 1981; Linehan
2006; Marasinghe 2012; Patsiokas 1985; Priebe 2012; Stewart
2009; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst 1987; Torhorst 1988; Turner 2000;
Wei 2013; Welu 1977). We also rated six trials as having a high risk
of bias for this item. For four trials this was because the Zelen’s de-
sign, in which participant consent is obtained after randomisation,
was used (Carter 2005; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; Hatcher
2011), whilst for the remaining two trials, this was because ran-
domisation was via an open numbers table (McLeavey 1994; Van
Heeringen 1995).
Blinding
Blinding was assessed separately for participants, clinical person-
nel, and outcome assessors.
Blinding of participants
Overall, we classified the majority of trials (k = 53; 96.4%) as
having high risk of bias for blinding of participants, as it is gen-
erally not possible to blind participants to psychological therapy.
In Harned 2014, correspondence with study authors clarified that
allocation was concealed from participants until their first therapy
session, at which point the therapist informed participants as to
which treatment condition they had been allocated, confirming
that participants were not blind to treatment allocation. We rated
one trial as having low risk of bias for this item, as the authors
asserted that “[t]he subjects were blinded as to their assignment”
(Fleischmann 2008, p. 704). We rated the remaining trial as hav-
ing an unclear risk of bias for this item; although authors did not
provide any information on participant blinding, treatments were
so similar that participants might have been blind to which treat-
ment they were receiving (Liberman 1981).

 Blinding of personnel
We classified the majority of trials (k = 52; 94.5%) as having high
risk of bias for blinding of clinical personnel, as it is not possible
to blind clinicians to the psychological therapy they are delivering.
We rated one trial as having an unclear risk of bias for this item as,
although GPs received a copy of the green (emergency) card given
to participants randomised to the experimental group, it is unclear
whether GPs were aware which of their patients received this card
(Morgan 1993). We rated the two remaining trials as having a low
risk of bias for this item, as clinicians were masked to allocation
status (Beautrais 2010; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011).
Blinding of outcome assessors
As outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation in 30
(54.5%) of the trials included in this review, we rated the ma-
jority of trials as having low risk of bias for blinding of outcome
assessment. We rated 10 trials as having a high risk of bias for
this item, as outcome assessor blinding was not possible: in four
trials this was due to reliance on self-reported information from
participants who were not blind to treatment allocation (Guthrie
2001; Slee 2008; Torhorst 1987; Van Heeringen 1995), and in six
it was due to issues related to feasibility, implementation, or both
(Allard 1992; Brown 2005; Gratz 2006; Hassanian-Moghaddam
2011; Stewart 2009; Waterhouse 1990). We rated the remain-
ing 15 trials as having an unclear risk of bias for this item as
they did not provide information on outcome assessor blinding
(Bennewith 2002; Cedereke 2002; Dubois 1999; Fleischmann
2008; Liberman 1981; Morgan 1993; Morthorst 2012; Patsiokas
1985; Salkovskis 1990; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst 1988; Tyrer 2003;
Van der Sande 1997a; Wei 2013; Welu 1977).
Incomplete outcome data
For most trials the authors reported having conducted analyses on
anintention-to-treatbasis, earningthemarating of low risk forthis
item (k = 33; 60.0%), although the method used to conduct these
analyses was not clear for the majority of these trials (Allard 1992;
Bateman 2009; Beautrais 2010; Carter 2005; Cedereke 2002;
Crawford 2010; Davidson 2014; Evans 1999a; Guthrie 2001;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hawton 1987a; Husain 2014;
Hvid 2011; Kapur 2013a; Kawanishi 2014; Marasinghe 2012;
Morgan 1993; Morthorst 2012; Salkovskis 1990; Turner 2000;
Vaiva 2006; Van der Sande 1997a; Wei 2013; Weinberg 2006).
Three used regression methods (Bennewith 2002; Clarke 2002;
Priebe 2012), one used longitudinal modelling (Brown 2005),
and one used Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation
(Gratz 2014). The remaining three trials combined intention-to-
treat with per protocol analyses (Harned 2014; Hatcher 2011;
McMain 2009; Slee 2008), so we also rated them as having low
risk of bias for this item. We rated seven trials as having unclear
risk, as insufficient information was provided to confirm whether
intention-to-treat or per protocol analyses had been undertaken
(Hawton 1981; Patsiokas 1985; Torhorst 1987; Torhorst 1988;
Tyrer 2003; Waterhouse 1990; Van Heeringen 1995). We classi-
fied the remaining 15 trials as having high risk of bias because per
protocol analyses were undertaken (Dubois 1999; Evans 1999b;
Fleischmann 2008; Gibbons 1978; Gratz 2006; Hatcher 2015;
Hatcher 2016a; Liberman 1981; Linehan 1991; Linehan 2006;
McAuliffe 2014; McLeavey 1994; Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010;
Welu 1977).
Selective reporting
As the review authors did not have access to trial protocols for the
trials included in this review, it is difficult to assess the extent to
which selective outcome reporting could have occurred. Conse-
quently, we classified the majority of trials as having an unclear risk
of bias for this item (k = 52; 94.5%). We rated the remaining three
trials as having high risk of bias for this outcome because data on
pre-specified outcomes were not reported in the text (Kawanishi
2014; McLeavey 1994; Torhorst 1987).
Other potential sources of bias
We classified most trials as having low risk of bias for this item as
no evidence of other bias was apparent (k = 47; 85.4%). We rated
seven trials as at high risk of bias for this item. Three had used Ze-
len’spost-consentrandomisationprocedure toallocate participants
to the experimental and control groups (Hatcher 2011; Hatcher
2016a; Hatcher 2015). In an additional three there were substan-
tial imbalances between the experimental and control groups on a
number of putative risk factors for repetition of SH, despite ran-
domisation (Beautrais 2010; Davidson 2014; Torhorst 1987). We
rated the remaining trial as at high risk of other bias because a small
number of participants in the control group (n = 20; 5.1%) mis-
takenly received the intervention treatment and yet were included
in the control group for all subsequent analyses (Carter 2005). We
rated one further trial as having unclear risk of bias for this item,
as the participants were biased towards more compliant patients
who were willing and able to attend a psycho-education session at
the commencement of treatment and were able to attend hospital
regularly for case management sessions and follow-up face-to-face
interviews. Additionally, this trial excluded individuals who had
engaged in non-suicidal SH from participation (Kawanishi 2014).
Few trials used systematic means to investigate whether partici-
pants were able to guess if they had been allocated to the experi-
mental or control arm.
Thirteen trials did not indicate the source of funding (Allard
1992; Dubois 1999; Hatcher 2016a; Hatcher 2015; McLeavey
1994; Morgan 1993; Patsiokas 1985; Salkovskis 1990; Stewart
2009; Tapolaa 2010; Torhorst 1987; Turner 2000; Waterhouse
1990). Fifteen trials received funding from national medical as-
sociations, research organisations, or both (Brown 2005; Gratz
25

2012; Slee 2008; Tyrer 2003; Van Heeringen 1995; Wei 2013;
Welu 1977). An additional nine trials received funding from
a health organisation (Bennewith 2002; Carter 2005; Clarke
2002; Davidson 2014; Evans 1999b; Fleischmann 2008; Gratz
2006; Guthrie 2001; Vaiva 2006). The remaining trials received
funding from a variety of sources, including: research organisa-
tions associated with specific diagnostic groups (Bateman 2009;
Weinberg 2006), charitable trusts (Crawford 2010), private re-
search foundations (Cedereke 2002), accident compensation or-
ganisations (Hatcher 2011), health insurance companies (Van der
Sande 1997a), government departments (Evans 1999a; Hawton
1981; Kawanishi 2014; Torhorst 1988), and university sources
(Marasinghe 2012). A number of trials also received joint fund-
ing, including from health and accident compensation organ-
isations (Beautrais 2010), health organisations and legal chari-
ties (Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011), university sources and edu-
cational institutes (Husain 2014), government departments and
health organisations (Gibbons 1978), government departments
and health insurance companies (Hvid 2011), government depart-
ments and charitable trusts (Morthorst 2012), and health organi-
sations and national research organisations (McAuliffe 2014).

1999b, N = 32; Gibbons 1978, N = 400; Guthrie 2001, N = 119;

162; Weinberg 2006; N = 30). One of these used Zelen’s design
(Hatcher 2011). In most trials, therapy was typically very brief
(i.e., less than 10 sessions), and it was delivered on an individual
basis in all but one (McAuliffe 2014). One trial included only
patients with borderline personality disorder (Weinberg 2006). In
Stewart 2009, there were separate treatment arms for cognitive
behavioural therapy and problem-solving therapy. We therefore
combined data from these two conditions using the formula out-
lined in section 7.7.3.8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Primary outcome
1.1 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy on repetition of SH by post-intervention in
McAuliffe 2014 (23/171 vs 27/142; OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to
1.21; k = 1; N = 313; GRADE: low quality).
By the six-month follow-up assessment, however, on the basis of
data from 12 trials there was evidence of a significant treatment
effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on repetition of SH (Analysis
1.1; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85; k = 12; N = 1317), with mod-
erate quality of evidence (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison). Omitting Weinberg 2006, which included only par-
ticipants diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, did not
materially affect this result. There was, however, evidence of a sig-
nificant difference by modality (Analysis 1.1; test for subgroup dif-
ferences: Chi2= 7.32, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P = 0.007, I2 =
86.3%). Specifically, although individual CBT-based psychother-
apy was associated with a significant treatment effect on repetition
of SH by the six-month follow-up assessment (OR 0.52, 95% CI
0.36 to 0.75; k = 11; N = 1083), a group-based approach was
not associated with a significant treatment effect for this outcome
in one trial (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.41; k = 1; N = 234;
McAuliffe 2014).
There was also evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy by the 12-month follow-up assessment in
10 trials (Analysis 1.2; OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98; k =
10; N = 2142), again with a moderate quality of evidence (see
Summary of findings for the main comparison). Once again, omit-
ting Weinberg 2006 did not materially affect this result, nor did
omitting Hatcher 2011, which used Zelen’s design. Hatcher 2011
also reported numbers of participants self-reporting an episode of
SH rather than those admitted to hospital following an episode of
SH. Using these data, however, did not materially affect this result.
There was no evidence of a significant difference by modality for
this outcome (Analysis 1.2; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 =
1.68, df = 1, P = 0.19, I2 = 40.6%).
In two trials data on repetition of SH from 12 to 24 months
were reported. A significant treatment effect for this outcome was

 found (Analysis 1.3; OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; k = 2; N
= 105; GRADE: moderate quality) (see Summary of findings for
the main comparison).
Including all 17 trials that reported information on repetition of
SH suggested a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psy-
chotherapy by the final follow-up assessment (i.e., including data
for the last follow-up assessment available in each trial) (Analysis
1.4; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88; k = 17; N = 2665). Excluding
Hatcher 2011 or Weinberg 2006 did not materially affect these
results. Once again, using data on self-reported incidents of SH
for Hatcher 2011 did not materially affect this result, nor did us-
ing data for the randomised rather than consenting group. There
was also no evidence of a significant difference by modality for
this outcome (Analysis 1.4; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 =
3.08, df = 1, P = 0.08, I2 = 67.5%). However, quality of evidence,
as assessed by the GRADE criteria, was low for this outcome (see
Summary of findings for the main comparison).
With respect to frequency of SH, data from six trials indicated
no significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on
frequency of repetition of SH by final follow-up (Analysis 1.5; k =
6; N = 594). Excluding Weinberg 2006 did not materially affect
this result. There was no evidence of a significant difference by
modality (Analysis 1.5; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 1.17,
df=1,P=0.28, I2 =14.2%).However, thisoutcome wasassociated
with low quality of evidence (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison). One trial reported information on median, rather
than mean, number of episodes of SH at six months. However,
the authors found that although “[t]he rate of self-harm episodes
was lower in the [experimental] group . . . [it was not] significantly
so” (Evans 1999b, p.22). A further trial reported information on
mediannumberof episodesof SHat12months’ follow-up, finding
that “[t]he median number of self-harm episodes was two in both
[the experimental and TAU] groups” (Tyrer 2003, p. 972).
Secondary outcomes
1.2 Treatment adherence
Data on adherence was reported for both the experimental and
control groups in one trial in which a significant treatment effect
for CBT-based psychotherapy on the proportion of participants
who completed all 12 sessions of therapy in addition to the three
follow-up appointments was found (40/40 vs 33/42; OR 22.97,
95% CI 1.29 to 409.37; k = 1; N = 82; Slee 2008).
Four trials reported adherence data for the experimental group
only (Brown 2005; Evans 1999b; Husain 2014; McAuliffe 2014).
Brown 2005 foundthat“participantsinthe cognitive therapy(CT)
group participated in a mean (SD) of 8.92 (5.97) CT sessions
(range 0-24). Thirty participants (50%) received ten or more CT
sessions” (p. 568). In Evans 1999b, five participants in the exper-
imental group did not have specific sessions of manual-assisted
cognitive-behaviour therapy (MACT) and received almost all in-
put from the booklet component of CBT alone. Overall, 17 of the
18 participants in the experimental group received the booklets.
Husain 2014 found that “more than half of the (intervention)
group attended all six sessions (n= 56)” (p. 466).
McAuliffe 2014, in which a group-based approach was used, like-
wise found that “almost half of those assigned to [problem-solving
therapy] (103, 46.4%) attended all 6 therapy sessions” (p. 4).
1.3 Depression
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy on depression scores at the post-intervention
assessment in McAuliffe 2014 (mean 18.20, SD 14.80, n = 171
vs mean 20.60, SD 16.0, n = 142; MD -2.40, 95% CI -5.84 to
1.04; k = 1; N = 313).
Data on depression scores at six months’ follow-up suggested a
significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on de-
pression scores (Analysis 1.6; SMD -0.30, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.10;
k = 11; N = 1668). Omitting Hatcher 2011, which used Zelen’s
design, did not materially affect this result. There was also no evi-
dence of a significant difference by modality (Analysis 1.6; test for
subgroup differences: Chi2 = 1.38, df = 1, P = 0.24, I2 = 27.3%).
Seven trials reported data on depression scores at 12 months, sug-
gesting evidence of a significant treatment effect for psychological
therapy (Analysis 1.7; SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.07; k = 7;
N = 1130; I2 = 76%). This outcome was associated with substan-
tial levels of heterogeneity (I2 = 76%). Omitting Hatcher 2011
did not materially affect the result nor the heterogeneity. Visual
inspection of the forest plot did not clearly indicate which trial/s
contributed to this substantial level of heterogeneity.
Only two trials reported depression scores between 12 and 24
months’ follow-up; however, there was no evidence of a significant
treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy (Analysis 1.8; k =
2; N = 225). One trial also reported data on depression scores at
6 and 12 months’ follow-up (Hawton 1987a); however, there was
not enough information to enable calculation of the SD. Never-
theless, the authors reported that there were no significant differ-
ences between groups in BDI scores at any time point.
Analysis of all 14 trials at final follow-up indicated a significant
treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on depression (
Analysis 1.9; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; k = 14; N =
1859).OmittingHatcher 2011 didnotmateriallyaffectthisresult.
1.4 Hopelessness
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy on hopelessness at the post-intervention as-
sessment in three trials, regardless of treatment modality (Analysis
1.10; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 2.06, df = 1, P = 0.15,
I2 = 51.5%).
However, by the six-month follow-up assessment, CBT-based psy-
chotherapy was associated with a significant treatment effect in
27

 four trials (Analysis 1.11; SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.13; k
= 4; N = 968). There was evidence of a difference by treatment
modality for this outcome, however (Analysis 1.11; test for sub-
group differences: Chi2 = 8.11, df = 1, P = 0.004, I2 = 87.7%). A
group-based CBT-based psychotherapy approach was not associ-
ated with a significant treatment effect on hopelessness scores at
six months in one trial (MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.89 to 1.29; k = 1;
N = 234; McAuliffe 2014).
Three trials reported data on hopelessness scores at 12 months,
again showing evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychological therapy (Analysis 1.12; MD -1.89, 95% CI -
2.97 to -0.81; k = 3; N = 539). Omitting Hatcher 2011, which
used Zelen’s design, did not materially affect these results.
Analyses of all seven trials also suggested evidence of a significant
treatment effect at final follow-up (Analysis 1.13, SMD -0.31,
95% CI -0.51 to -0.10; k = 7; N = 1017). Omitting Hatcher 2011
did not materially affect this result. There was also no evidence
of a significant treatment difference by modality for this outcome
(Analysis 1.13; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 3.65, df = 1,
P = 0.06, I2 = 72.6%).
1.5 Suicidal ideation
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy in three trials at the post-intervention assess-
ment, regardless of treatment modality (Analysis 1.14; k = 3; N
= 360; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 1.84, df = 1, P =
0.17, I2 = 45.8%). However, sensitivity analyses using the fixed-
effect, rather than random-effects model, suggested evidence of a
significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on this
outcome (fixed: MD -1.93, 95% CI -3.83 to -0.04).
By the six-month follow-up assessment, CBT-based psychother-
apy was associated with a significant treatment effect for suicidal
ideation scores (Analysis 1.15; SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.51 to -
0.13; k = 6; N = 1011). Omitting Hatcher 2011, which used Ze-
len’s design, did not materially affect this result, nor did omitting
Weinberg 2006, in which participants had been diagnosed with
personalitydisorders.There wasevidence of asignificantdifference
by treatment modality, however (Analysis 1.15; test for subgroup
differences: Chi2 = 6.69, df = 1, P = 0.010, I2 = 85.1%), with a
group-based CBT-based psychotherapy approach not appearing
to be associated with a significant treatment effect for this out-
come (Analysis 1.15; MD -0.20, 95% CI -2.49 to 2.09; McAuliffe
2014).
Data from Hatcher 2011 suggested that CBT-based psychother-
apy was not associated with a significant treatment effect for suici-
dal ideation scores at 12 months (mean 3.70, SD 6.70, n = 187 vs
mean 4.80, SD 7.40, n = 231; MD -1.10, 95% CI -2.45 to 0.25;
k = 1; N = 418).
Including all eight trials suggested evidence for a significant treat-
ment effect for psychological therapy on suicidal ideation scores at
final follow-up (Analysis 1.16; SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.11;
k = 8; N = 1129). Omitting Hatcher 2011 or Weinberg 2006 did
not materially affect this result. However, once again there was ev-
idence of a significant difference by treatment modality (Analysis
1.16; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 4.61, df = 1, P = 0.03, I2
= 78.3%), with a group-based psychotherapy approach not associ-
ated with a significant treatment effect for this outcome (Analysis
1.16; MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.20; McAuliffe 2014).
Wei 2013 recorded data on the proportion of participants self-
reporting suicidal ideation. There was no evidence of a significant
treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy in this trial at the
six-month follow-up assessment (30/35 vs 32/40; OR 1.50, 95%
CI 0.44 to 5.10; k = 1; N = 75). Although data were also available
for the 12-month follow-up period, authors reported a greater
number of participants in the CBT arm who self-reported suicidal
ideation (n = 30) than were reported to have been followed-up by
this point (n = 25). As we were unable to clarify these numbers
with the authors, we have excluded this analysis from the review.
1.6 Problem solving
Two trials recorded dichotomous data on problem-solving as the
proportion of participants reporting improvement in problems.
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-based
psychotherapy on problem-solving in these trial trials at the six-
month follow-up assessment (Analysis 1.17; OR 2.81, 95% CI
1.50 to 5.24; k = 2; N = 231). However, for the same dichotomous
outcome, there was no indication of any apparent treatment effect
at the 12-month follow-up assessment in Hawton 1987a (24/30
vs 26/35; OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.47; k = 1; N = 65). Gibbons
1978 reported data for problem-solving at the 24-month follow-
up assessment, with evidence of a significant treatment effect for
CBT-based psychotherapy (64/73 vs 40/73; OR 5.87, 95% CI
2.54 to 13.54; k = 1; N = 146). Analysis of both these trials at the
final follow-up assessment, however, suggested no overall evidence
of a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on
problem-solving (Analysis 1.18; k = 2; N = 211). On the other
hand,there wasasignificantdifference usingthe fixed-effectmodel
(fixed: OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.09).
Data on problem-solving scores at post-intervention indicated
no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-based psy-
chotherapy with no evidence of a significant difference by treat-
ment modality (Analysis 1.19; test for subgroup differences: Chi
2 = 0.07, df = 1, P = 0.79, I2 = 0%). By the six-month follow-
up, however, there was evidence of a significant treatment effect
for CBT-based psychotherapy for this outcome (Analysis 1.20;
SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.58; k = 4; N = 949). Omitting
Hatcher 2011, which used Zelen’s design, caused this effect to be-
come non-significant (MD 0.24, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.51). There
was also evidence of a significant difference by treatment modality
(Analysis 1.20; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 8.11, df = 1,
P = 0.004, I2 = 87.7%), with a single trial of group-based psy-
chotherapy indicating no evidence of a significant treatment effect
28

 for this outcome (MD 0.30, 95% CI -3.55 to 4.15; McAuliffe
2014). There was no apparent benefit for CBT-based psychother-
apy in a single trial at 12 months (mean 92.2, SD 18.1, n = 190 vs
mean 90.5, SD 18.9, n = 233; MD 1.70, 95% CI -1.84 to 5.24;
k = 1; N = 423; Hatcher 2011). Combining all five trials at final
follow-up suggested evidence of a significant treatment effect for
problem solving at the final follow-up assessment (Analysis 1.21;
SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.50; k = 5; N = 958). Omitting
Hatcher 2011 caused the association to become non-significant
(SMD 0.35, 95% CI -0.00. to 0.69; k = 4; N = 535).
Finally, Salkovskis 1990 reported the severity of participants’ three
main problems using the Personal Questionnaire Rapid Scaling
Technique (PQRST) at one week, one month, three months,
six months and one year following entry to treatment. The au-
thors reported that “the problem-solving therapy group showed
significantly better overall results on their three main problems
when compared with the group who received ’treatment as usual’
” (Salkovskis 1990, p. 873).
1.7 Suicide
Fifteen trials reported data on suicides during follow-up; however,
there was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for CBT-
based psychotherapy on suicides by final follow-up (Analysis 1.22;
k = 15; N = 2354). In Tyrer 2003, there was one death in the
experimental group that medical staff considered to be a suicide,
although the coroner did not record a suicide verdict in this case.
Including this death as a suicide did not materially change the
overall result.
Comparison 2: Interventions for multiple episodes of
SH/probable personality disorder vs TAU or other
alternative forms of psychotherapy
A number of trials investigated provision of a specialised treatment
for patients with multiple episodes of SH and/ or probable per-
sonality disorder, including: group-based emotion-regulation psy-
chotherapy (two trials; Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014), mentalisation-
based therapy (MBT; one trial; Bateman 2009), DBT-oriented
therapy (one trial; Turner 2000), DBT (four trials; Linehan 1991;
Linehan 2006; McMain 2009; Priebe 2012), and DBT prolonged
exposure protocol (one trial; Harned 2014).
Group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy vs TAU
Two trials assessed the effectiveness of group-based emotion-reg-
ulation psychotherapy in women diagnosed with borderline per-
sonality referred for outpatient treatment as a result of recurrent
SH (Gratz 2006, N = 22; Gratz 2014, N = 61). Correspondence
with authors suggested that this treatment did not require partic-
ipants to abstain from SH behaviour. Instead, participants were
encouraged to work on resisting urges to engage in SH and, when
SH occurred, to learn from the reasons for it.
Primary outcome
2.1 Repetition of SH
Group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy was associated
with a significant treatment effect by the post-intervention assess-
ment (Analysis 2.1; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; k = 2; N =
83). Quality of evidence for this outcome, however, was low (see
Summary of findings 2).
With respect to frequency of repetition of SH, there was no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for group-based emo-
tion-regulation psychotherapy by the post-intervention assess-
ment (Analysis 2.1; k = 2; N = 83). Once again, this was associated
with a low quality of evidence (see Summary of findings 2).
Secondary outcomes
2.2 Treatment adherence
No data available.
2.3 Depression
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for group-
based emotion-regulation therapy on depression scores at the post-
intervention assessment (Analysis 2.8; MD -9.59, 95% CI -13.43
to -5.75; k = 2; N = 83).
2.4 Hopelessness
No data available.
2.5 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
2.6 Problem solving
No data available.
2.7 Suicide
There were no suicides in either group for either trial.
Mentalisation vs TAU
Bateman 2009 (N = 134) assessed the effectiveness of mentalisa-
tion-based therapy in adults diagnosed with borderline personal-
ity disorder referred to a specialist personality disorder treatment
service following an attempted suicide or an episode of life-threat-
ening SH in the six months prior to trial entry.

 Primary outcome
2.8 Repetition of SH
There was a significant treatment effect for mentalisation-based
therapy by the conclusion of the 18-month treatment period, with
fewer participants in the experimental group engaging in SH based
on data obtained by correspondence (Analysis 2.1; 18/71 vs 31/
63; OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73; k = 1; N = 134). However,
quality of evidence was moderate (see Summary of findings 2).
There was also evidence of a significant treatment effect for men-
talisation-based therapy on frequency of SH episodes by the post-
intervention assessment according to data obtained by correspon-
dence (Analysis 2.5; mean 0.38, SD 0.83, n = 71 vs mean 1.66,
SD 2.87, n = 63; MD -1.28, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.55; k = 1; N =
134). Once again, quality of evidence was moderate (see Summary
of findings 2).
Secondary outcomes
2.9 Treatment adherence
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for mental-
isation-based therapy on the proportion of participants who com-
pleted the full course of treatment (Analysis 2.7; k = 1; N = 134).
2.10 Depression
Mentalisation-based therapy was associated with a significant
treatment effect for depression at the post-intervention assessment
(Analysis 2.8; mean 14.80, SD 8.55, n = 71 vs mean 18.68, SD
8.76, n = 63; MD -3.88, 95% CI -6.82 to -0.94; k = 1; N = 134).
2.11 Hopelessness
No data available.
2.12 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
2.13 Problem solving
No data available.
2.14 Suicide
There had been no suicides in either treatment arm by the time
of the post-treatment assessment.
Dialectical behaviour-oriented psychotherapy vs other
alternative forms of psychotherapy
One small trial in participants diagnosed with borderline person-
ality disorder and referred to outpatient services following a sui-
cide attempt assessed the effectiveness of a DBT-oriented therapy
versus client-oriented therapy over a 12-month follow-up (Turner
2000, N = 24).
Primary outcome
2.15 Repetition of SH
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT-
orientedtherapyforrepetitionof SHbypost-treatmentassessment
(Analysis 2.1; 1/12 vs 8/12; OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.49; k =
1; N = 24). This result had low quality evidence (see Summary of
findings 2).
Data on number of repeat episodes of SH, obtained by corre-
spondence, also suggest a significant treatment effect for DBT-
oriented therapy by the post-treatment assessment (Analysis 2.5;
mean 0.75, SD 1.23, n = 12 vs mean 5.58, SD 5.28, n = 12; MD
-4.83, 95% CI -7.90 to -1.76; k = 1; N = 24). Once again, how-
ever, a low quality of evidence was associated with this outcome
(see Summary of findings 2).
Secondary outcomes
2.16 Treatment adherence
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT-
oriented therapy on the number of participants who completed
the full course of treatment (Analysis 2.7; k = 1; N = 24).
2.17 Depression
DBT-oriented therapy was associated with a significant treatment
effect for depression scores according to both the BDI and the
HRSD by the post-treatment assessment (BDI: Analysis 2.8; mean
14.92, SD 8.26, n = 12 vs mean 24.08, SD 5.55, n = 12; MD -
9.16, 95% CI -14.79 to -3.53; k = 1; N = 24; HRSD: mean 7.50,
SD 5.96, n = 12 vs mean 12.58, SD 3.90, n = 12; MD -5.08,
95% CI -9.11 to -1.05; k = 1; N = 24).
2.18 Hopelessness
No data available.
2.19 Suicidal ideation
There was also evidence of a significant treatment effect for suicidal
ideation at the post-treatment assessment (Analysis 2.11; mean
3.83, SD 8.03, n = 12 vs mean 11.58, SD 9.21, n = 12; MD -

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) vs TAU
Three trials investigated the effectiveness of dialectical behaviour
therapy (DBT) in adults diagnosed with personality disorders,
typicallyborderline personalitydisorder, referredtospecialistDBT
services owing to recurrent SH (Linehan 1991, N = 63; McMain
2009, N = 180; Priebe 2012, N = 80).
Primary outcome
2.22 Repetition of SH
We obtained data on repetition of SH through correspondence for
all three trials. There was no clear evidence of a significant treat-
ment effect for DBT compared to TAU in terms of the proportion
of patients repeating SH in three trials by the post-intervention
assessment (Analysis 2.1; k = 3; N = 267). Similarly, there was
no evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT by the 12-
month follow-up assessment in two trials (Analysis 2.3; k = 2; N =
172). Combining data from all three trials by the final assessment
period suggested no evidence of a significant treatment effect for
DBT versus TAU (Analysis 2.4; k = 3; N = 247). Quality of ev-
idence for these three outcomes was low, however (see Summary
of findings 2).
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT as
compared to TAU on frequency of SH by the post-intervention
assessment (Analysis 2.5; MD -18.82, 95% CI -36.68 to -0.95; k
= 3; N = 292). Once again quality of evidence for this outcome
was low (see Summary of findings 2).
Following a “naturalistic” follow-up period, data from Linehan
1993a (N = 39) indicated that the effectiveness of DBT in the
Linehan 1991 trial was maintained at 24 months; however, this
outcome was only investigated for a proportion of the original
participants (61.9%) who the researchers were able to contact at
24 months. Results have therefore not been reproduced in the
present review.
Secondary Outcomes
2.23 Treatment adherence
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT for
the number of participants completing the full course of treatment
in one trial (McMain 2009) (55/90 vs 56/90; OR 0.95, 95% CI
0.52 to 1.74; k = 1; N = 180). Numbers completing treatment in
the control group for Priebe 2012 were not provided. Therefore
we could not incorporate the results of this trial in a meta-analysis.
Although Linehan 1991 did not provide numerical data on treat-
ment adherence, the authors did report that participants allocated
to the DBT group were “. . . significantly more likely to start indi-
vidual therapy . . . (100% versus 73%)” (Linehan 1991, p. 1062).
2.24 Depression
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT
as compared to TAU on depression scores at the post-intervention
assessment (Analysis 2.8; k = 2; N = 198).
Data from McMain 2012 furthermore suggested there was no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for DBT on depression
at the 24-month assessment (mean 22.24, SD 16.40, n = 90 vs
mean 21.67, SD 14.82, n = 90; MD 0.57, 95% CI -4.00 to 5.14;
k = 1; N = 180).
2.25 Hopelessness
We obtained data on hopelessness by correspondence for one trial
(Linehan 1991). There was no evidence of a significant treat-
ment effect for DBT at the 24-month follow-up assessment (mean
10.86, SD 6.04, n = 7 vs mean 10.69, SD 6.18, n = 11; MD 0.17,
95% CI -5.61 to 5.95; k = 1; N = 18).
2.26 Suicidal ideation
One trial reported data on suicidal ideation (Linehan 1991).
Again, there was no significant treatment effect for DBT at the
post-intervention assessment (mean 24.01, SD 19.80, n = 46 vs
mean 31.92, SD 26.80, n = 35; MD -7.91, SD -18.47 to 2.65; k
= 1; N = 81).
2.27 Problem solving
No data available.
2.28 Suicide
Although a suicide occurred in the DBT arm of Linehan 1991
before the post-intervention assessment, there were no suicides in
Priebe 2012 or in McMain 2009. There was therefore no evidence
of a significant treatment effect for this outcome (Analysis 2.13;
k = 3; N = 317). There were no suicides in Priebe 2012 or in
McMain 2009 by the 24-month follow-up assessment.
Dialectical behaviour therapy vs other alternative forms of
psychotherapy
One trial compared the effectiveness of DBT versus psychological
treatment by ’experts’ (CBT-E) for women diagnosed with border-
line personality disorder and referred to a specialist DBT service
owing to recurrent SH (Linehan 2006, N = 101). Community
mental health leaders (such as heads of inpatient psychiatric units

 and clinical directors of mental health agencies) nominated pro-
fessionals who they considered experts in treating difficult clients.
These therapists described themselves as “eclectic but non behav-
ioral” or “mostly psychodynamic” in their treatment approach.
No therapists with experience of delivering cognitive behavioural
therapy were included, however.
Primary outcome
2.29 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a treatment effect for DBT versus treat-
ment by expert on repetition of SH by either the post-interven-
tion assessment (Analysis 2.1; k = 1; N = 97) or by the 12-month
follow-up period (Analysis 2.3; k = 1; N = 97). Quality of evidence
for this outcome at both time points, as assessed by the GRADE
criteria, was very low (see Summary of findings 2).
Study authors did, however, state that those allocated to the DBT
group had “ . . . half the rate of suicide attempts compared with the
CTB-E group (23.1% vs 46% . . . hazard ratio, 2.66, P = 0.005)”
(Linehan 2006, p. 761). Nevertheless, correspondence with au-
thors regarding the total number of parasuicidal acts across the
12-month follow-up period revealed no evidence of a significant
treatment effect for DBT (mean 8.79, SD 10.81, n = 52 vs mean
23.64, SD 77.34, n = 45; MD -14.85, 95% CI -37.64 to 7.94; k
= 1; N = 97). Quality of evidence for this outcome was also very
low (see Summary of findings 2).
Secondary outcomes
2.30 Treatment adherence
No data available.
2.31 Depression
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on depres-
sion scores either at the post-intervention assessment (Analysis 2.8;
k = 1; N = 89) or at the 12-month follow-up assessment (Analysis
2.10; k = 1 ; N = 81) in this trial.
2.32 Hopelessness
No data available.
2.33 Suicidal ideation
There was also no evidence of a significant treatment effect for
DBT for suicidal ideation scores at either the post-intervention
(Analysis 2.11; k = 1; N = 89) or 12-month follow-up assessments
(Analysis 2.12; k = 1; N = 81).
2.34 Problem solving
No data available.
2.35 Suicide
There were no suicides in either treatment arm by the end of the
12-month follow-up period.
Dialectical behaviour therapy prolonged exposure vs other
alternative forms of psychotherapy
The effectiveness of two forms of DBT were compared over a
three-month follow-up period in one small trial of women with
comorbidborderline personalitydisorderandpost-traumaticstress
disorder referred to clinical services due to recurrent SH (Harned
2014; N = 26). In the experimental arm, participants received, in
addition to the standard DBT protocol, additional weekly therapy
sessions involving in vivo and imaginal exposure to previously
traumatic experiences.
Primary outcome
2.36 Repetition of SH
Data obtained by correspondence suggested there was no evidence
of asignificanttreatmenteffectforthe DBTprolongedprotocol on
repetition of SH either by the post-treatment assessment (Analysis
2.1; k = 1; N = 18) or by the three-month follow-up (Analysis 2.2;
k = 1; N = 18). Quality of evidence for both these time points was
low, however (see Summary of findings 2).
Data on frequency of SH, obtained following correspondence with
authors, also suggested no apparent benefit of the DBT prolonged
exposure protocol by either the post-treatment (Analysis 2.5; k =
1; N = 18) or three-month follow-up (Analysis 2.6; k = 1; N =
18) assessments. Quality of evidence, as assessed by the GRADE
criteria, was low (see Summary of findings 2). Data on frequency
of suicide re-attempts could not be analysed as there were no repeat
suicide attempts in the control group by the final three-month
follow-up assessment.
Secondary outcomes
2.37 Treatment adherence
There was no significant difference between the experimental and
control groups regarding the number of participants who attended
the full one-year course of treatment (Analysis 2.7; k = 1; N = 26).
According to the authors, “. . . one therapist . . . was not adherent
to DBT and had a 100% dropout rate” (p. 12). Excluding the four
participants treated by this therapist did not, however, materially
affect this result.

 2.38 Depression
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for the
DBT prolonged exposure protocol for depression scores at either
the post-treatment (Analysis 2.8; k = 1; N = 18) or three-month
follow-up (Analysis 2.9; k = 1; N = 18) assessments.
2.39 Hopelessness
No data available.
2.40 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
2.41 Problem solving
No data available.
2.42 Suicide
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on death by
suicide by the three-month follow-up assessment (Analysis 2.14:
0/17 vs 1/9; OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.41; k = 1; N = 26) in
this trial.
Comparison 3: Case management vs TAU
Four trials investigated the provision of case management for the
prevention of SH either compared to either treatment as usual
(TAU; Clarke 2002, N = 467; Hvid 2011, N = 133; Morthorst
2012, N = 243) or to enhanced usual care (EUC; Kawanishi 2014,
N = 914). Although the intervention in Hvid 2011 and Morthorst
2012 also included aspects of problem-solving psychotherapy, this
component was not the primary or only element of the case man-
agement strategy adopted in these trials, so we felt these trials were
sufficiently similar to justify pooling within a meta-analysis.
Primary outcome
3.1 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for case
management on repetition of SH by the post-intervention assess-
ment (Analysis 3.1; k = 4; N = 1608). Supplementing hospital-
recorded episodes of SH with self-reported data for Morthorst
2012 did not materially affect this result. There was also no in-
dication of a significant difference by comparator condition (i.e.,
TAU vs EUC) for this outcome (Analysis 3.1; test for subgroup
differences: Chi2 = 0.20, df = 1, P = 0.66, I2 = 0%). Quality, as
assessed using the GRADE criteria, was moderate for this outcome
(see Summary of findings 3).
One trial disaggregated data on repetition of SH by sex (Hvid
2011). Although there was no evidence of a significant treatment
effect for males in this trial (4/20 vs 4/18; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.18
to 4.17; k = 1; N = 38), case management was associated with a
significant reduction in repetition of SH in females (2/49 vs 10/
46; OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.74; k = 1; N = 95).
Multiple readmissions for SH were, however, significantly more
common in the case management group than in the control group
over the treatment period in one trial (Clarke 2002: 9/220 vs 2/
247; OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.12 to 24.45; k = 1; N = 467). Quality of
evidence for this outcome was moderate (see Summary of findings
3).
Secondary outcomes
3.2 Treatment adherence
The authors of one trial reported that “11 participants in the
assertive case management group did not receive the intervention”
(Kawanishi 2014, p. 197). However, ascorrespondingnumbersfor
the enhanced usual care group were not reported, we were unable
to analyse the effect of assertive case management on treatment
adherence for this trial.
3.3 Depression
No data available.
3.4 Hopelessness
Although the Beck Hopelessness Scale was administered to par-
ticipants throughout the follow-up period in one trial (Kawanishi
2014), the authors did not report data on this outcome. Cor-
respondence, however, revealed that they are currently analysing
these data and will present them in a future report.
3.5 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
3.6 Problem solving
No data available.
3.7 Suicide
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on sui-
cide by the post-intervention assessment (Analysis 3.2; k = 4; N =
1757), nor was there evidence of a significant difference by com-
parator condition (i.e., TAU vs EUC) for this outcome (Analysis
3.2; test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 0.67, df = 1, P = 0.41, I
2 = 0%).

 Comparison 4: Treatment adherence enhancement
approaches vs TAU or other alternative forms of
psychotherapy
Two trials investigated the effectiveness of treatment adherence en-
hancement approaches compared either to TAU (Van Heeringen
1995) or to other alternative forms of psychotherapy (Torhorst
1987) in patients admitted to hospital following an episode of SH.
Treatment adherence enhancement vs TAU
Van Heeringen 1995 (N = 516) investigated the effectiveness of
adherence enhancement, involving home visits by a nurse for those
patients who failed to attend outpatient appointments, over a 12-
month follow-up period in patients referred to accident and emer-
gency departments following an episode of SH, irrespective of sui-
cidal intent.
Primary outcome
4.1 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on repeti-
tion of SH by the 12-month follow-up assessment, although the
difference inrepetitionbetweengroupswasfairlymarked(Analysis
4.1; k = 1; N = 391). Quality of evidence for this outcome, as as-
sessed by the GRADE criteria, was low (see Summary of findings
4).
Secondary outcomes
4.2 Treatment adherence
There was, however, a significant treatment effect for adherence
with outpatient aftercare appointments in this trial (129/252 vs
102/256; OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.25; k = 1; N = 508).
4.3 Depression
No data available.
4.4 Hopelessness
No data available.
4.5 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
4.6 Problem solving
No data available.
4.7 Suicide
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for the
number of participants who died by suicide over the 12-month
follow-up period (Analysis 4.3; k = 1; N = 391) in this trial.
Continuity of care by the same therapist vs other alternative
forms of psychotherapy
One trial investigated the effectiveness of continuing aftercare
with the same therapist (defined as continued therapeutic contact
with the original hospital therapist in an outpatient setting) versus
changing to a different therapist (defined as receiving therapy in
a specialised suicide prevention centre, which involved changing
both therapist and institution) over a 12-month follow-up period
in adults admitted to hospital following an episode of self-poison-
ing (Torhorst 1987, N = 141).
Primary outcome
4.8 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for receiv-
ing continued therapeutic contact with the original hospital ther-
apist on repetition of SH by the 12-month follow-up assessment
(Analysis 4.1; k = 1; N = 136). A very low quality of evidence was
associated with this outcome (see Summary of findings 4).
Secondary outcomes
4.9 Treatment adherence
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for treatment
adherence, favouring the same-therapist group (49/68 vs 36/73;
OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.34; k = 1; N = 141).
4.10 Depression
Depression scores did not differ significantly between groups at
the 12-month follow-up assessment (Analysis 4.2: mean 6.20, SD
6.90, n = 65 vs mean 7.60, SD 9.20, n = 62; MD -1.40, 95% CI
-4.24 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 127).

Comparison 5: Mixed multimodal interventions vs
TAU
Two trials investigated the effectiveness of a package of interven-
tions, including problem-solving psychotherapy, postcards, and a
GP voucher entitling participants to one free visit to their GP in
adults admitted to emergency departments following an episode
of SH, irrespective of intent (Hatcher 2016a: Hatcher 2015).
Mixed multimodal interventions vs TAU
One large trial using Zelen’s post-randomisation consent design
investigated the effectiveness of a package of mixed multimodal
interventions in adults admitted to emergency departments fol-
lowing an episode of SH irrespective of intent over a 12-month
period (Hatcher 2015; N = 1474).
Primary outcome
5.1 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for this
package of interventions in terms of hospital-recorded episodes
of SH by 12-month post-intervention assessment (66/327 vs 73/
357; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43; k = 1; N = 684). This out-
come had a low quality of evidence (see Summary of findings 5).
Using data from the randomised (including both patients who,
following treatment allocation, subsequently consented to partic-
ipation and those who did not), rather than consenting, sample
did not materially affect these results.
Investigators also presented data on repetition of SH by repeater
status at trial entry. However, there was no evidence of a signifi-
cant treatment effect for those with no history of SH prior to the
index attempt compared to those with a history of multiple SH
episodes by the post-intervention assessment (those with a history
of multiple episodes of SH: 47/176 vs 56/194; OR 0.90, 95% CI
0.57 to 1.42; k = 1; N = 370; those without a history of multiple
episodes of SH: 19/151 vs 17/163; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.62 to
2.48; k = 1; N = 314).
With respect to frequency of SH, the authors reported that
“[a]lthough there were 20% fewer episodes in the intervention
group, the difference was not statistically significant” (Hatcher
2015, p. 17).
Secondary outcomes
5.2 Treatment adherence
No data available.
5.3 Depression
There was no significant treatment effect for this intervention on
depression scores at the 12-month post-intervention assessment
(mean 6.8, SD 4.9, n = 211 vs mean 6.5, SD 5.1, n = 234; MD
0.30, 95% CI -0.63 to 1.23; k = 1; N = 445).
5.4 Hopelessness
There was also no apparent treatment effect for this intervention
on hopelessness scores at the 12-month post-intervention assess-
ment (mean 8.3, SD 6.3, n = 210 vs mean 8.4, SD 6.4, n = 233;
MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; k = 1; N = 443).
5.5 Suicidal ideation

month post-intervention assessment (1/327 vs 2/357; OR 0.54,
95% CI 0.05 to 6.03; k = 1; N = 684). One death in the experi-
mental and one in the control group were due to uncertain causes
as they had yet to be investigated by the Coroner. However, as-
suming these deaths were attributable to suicide did not materially
affect this result.

 Culturally adapted multi-model interventions vs TAU
The effectiveness of a culturally-adapted mixed multimodal inter-
vention was investigated over a 12-month follow-up period in one
trial using Zelen’s post-randomisation consent design in adults ad-
mitted to emergency departments following SH and who identify
themselves as of M
ori ethnicity (Hatcher 2016a; N = 365).
Primary outcome
5.8 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for this
intervention on re-presentation to hospital following an episode
of SH by the time of the post-intervention assessment (34/95 vs
29/72; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.55; k = 1; N = 167). Using
data from the randomised sample only (including both patients
who, following treatment allocation, subsequently consented to
participation and those who did not) did not materially affect these
results. Both outcomes had a low quality of evidence, as assessed
using the GRADE criteria (see Summary of findings 5).
Investigators presented information on repetition of SH by re-
peater status; however, there was no significant difference in rep-
etition of SH between groups for either those with a history of
multiple episodes of SH (24/60 vs 21/40; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27
to 1.35; k = 1; N = 100) or for those without a history of multiple
episodes of SH (10/35 vs 8/32; OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.55; k
= 1; N = 67).
Secondary outcomes
5.9 Treatment adherence
No data available.
5.10 Depression
There was no treatment effect for this intervention on depression
scores at the 12-month post-intervention assessment (mean 5.80,
SD 4.50, n = 66 vs mean 6.30, SD 4.30, n = 48; MD -0.50, 95%
CI -2.13 to 1.13; k = 1; N = 114).
5.10 Hopelessness
There was also no apparent treatment effect for this intervention
on hopelessness scores at the post-intervention assessment (mean
5.00, SD 4.40, n = 66 vs mean 5.70, SD 4.80, n = 47; MD -0.70,
95% CI -2.43 to 1.03; k = 1; N = 113).
However, the authors note that “whilst there was a greater change
in [hopelessness] scores at . . . 12 months [i.e., the post-inter-
vention assessment] in the intervention group, the group had a
significantly lower baseline score . . . because of the significant
differences in baseline scores and missing follow up data we . .
. used a mixed linear model to estimate the differences in scores
at [the post-intervention assessment].” Using this model the au-
thors found “there was a decrease in [h]opelessness scores in the
treatment group compared to the usual care group but this was
statistically non-significant” (Hatcher 2016a, ePub version, p. 5).
5.11 Suicide ideation
No data available.
5.12 Problem solving
No data available.
5.13 Suicide
Correspondence with authors revealed there was no significant
treatment effect for this intervention on suicides by the time of
the post-intervention assessment (0/72 vs 1/95; OR 0.43, 95%
CI 0.02 to 10.82; k = 1; N = 167).
Comparison 6: Remote contact interventions vs TAU
A number of trials investigated the effectiveness of remote con-
tact interventions, including, postcards (Beautrais 2010; Carter
2005; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Kapur 2013a), emergency
cards (Evans 1999a; Morgan 1993), general practitioner’s (GP)
letter (Bennewith 2002), telephone contact (Cedereke 2002; Wei
2013; Vaiva 2006), or mobile telephone-based psychotherapy
(Marasinghe 2012) for the prevention of repetition of SH.
Postcards vs TAU
Four trials assessed the effectiveness of sending postcards to
patients on a regular basis over a 12-month follow-up period
(Beautrais 2010, N = 327; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011, N =
2113; Kapur 2013a, N = 66), including one that used Zelen’spost-
randomisation consent design and reported data only for the ran-
domised sample (Carter 2005, N = 772). The trials of Beautrais
2010, Carter 2005, and Kapur 2013a took place in three high-
income countries, whilst the Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011 trial
was in a low income country (i.e., Iran).
Primary outcome
6.1 Repetition of SH
Due to the definition of SH used in the report for one trial of post-
cards, we obtained data for this trial on repetition of SH through
correspondence (Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011).

Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Overall, there was no evidence of a significant treatment effect
on the proportion of patients repeating SH by the post-interven-
tion assessment (Analysis 5.1; k = 4; N = 3277). Excluding Carter
2005, which used Zelen’s design, did not materially affect this re-
sult. Quality of evidence, as assessed using the GRADE criteria,
was very low for this outcome (see Summary of findings 6). Visual
examination of the forest plot suggested that the result for Kapur
2013a may have been an outlier. Removing this trial reduced het-
erogeneity to 0% and suggested a significant treatment effect for
postcards on repetition of SH (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; k
= 3; N = 3212).
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for post-
cards on repetition of SH by the 12-month follow-up assessment
in two trials (Analysis 5.2; k = 2; N = 2885). The quality of ev-
idence for this outcome was moderate (see Summary of findings
6). Excluding Carter 2005, however, caused this result to become
significant (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; k = 1; N = 2113) as
did a sensitivity analysis using the fixed-effect rather than random-
effects model (fixed: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91).
Combiningdatafromboth time pointsindicatednooverall signifi-
cant effect for postcards by the final follow-up assessment (Analysis
5.3; k = 4; N = 3277). Excluding Carter 2005 did not materi-
ally affect this result. However, as before, excluding Kapur 2013a
caused this result to become significant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63
to 0.95) as did a sensitivity analysis using the fixed-effect model
(fixed: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95), quality of evidence was
again very low for this outcome (see Summary of findings 6).
Data on repetition of SH by the post-intervention assessment and
12-month follow-up were available by sex in one trial (Carter
2005; Carter2007); however, there wasnoevidence of asignificant
treatment effect for postcards in either sex by either time point
(post-intervention: males 20/145 vs 16/102; OR 0.86, 95% CI
0.42 to 1.75; k = 1; N = 247 versus females 37/233 vs 51/291; OR
0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.41; k = 1; N = 524; 12 months’ follow-
up: males 26/145 vs 19/102; OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.50; k = 1; N =
247 versus females 54/233 vs 59/291; OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to
1.80; k = 1; N = 524).
With respect to frequency of SH, we obtained data on mean num-
ber of repeat SH episodes by correspondence for three of the four
trials of postcards (Carter 2005; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011;
Kapur 2013a). For the one remaining trial (Beautrais 2010), the
available data indicated a reduced mean number of SH episodes
for the experimental group (0.57 vs 0.78); however, as no infor-
mation on SDs, t-test or F statistics were reported, we were unable
to impute SDs using the method outlined in Townsend 2001 to
calculate the mean difference in frequency of SH episodes between
groups. Overall, there was no evidence of a significant treatment
effect for postcards on frequency of repetition of SH by the post-
intervention assessment (Analysis 5.4; k = 3; N = 1,097). Qual-
ity of evidence for this outcome was very low (see Summary of
findings 6).
By the 12-month follow-up assessment, there was similarly no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for postcards in two trials
(Analysis 5.5; k = 2; N = 984). One trial also provided data for the
24-month follow-up period; however, no evidence of a significant
treatment effect was apparent (mean 0.21, SD 0.75, n = 217 vs
mean 0.24, SD 0.68, n = 255; MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.10; k
= 1; N = 472; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011). Quality of evidence
was very low to moderate for these outcomes (see Summary of
findings 6).
Through correspondence, we were also able to obtain post hoc
data on frequency of repetition of SH by the post-intervention
assessment by both sex and repeater status for three trials (Carter
2005; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Kapur 2013a). There was
no evidence of a significant treatment effect for postcards on fre-
quency of repetition by the post-intervention assessment for ei-
ther sex (males: Analysis 5.4; k = 3; N = 401; females: Analysis
5.4; k = 3; N = 695), those with a history of multiple episodes of
SH (Analysis 5.4; k = 3; N = 339), or those without a history of
multiple episodes of SH (Analysis 5.4; k = 3; N = 758). There was
also no evidence of a significant treatment effect for postcards on
frequency of repetition for males (Analysis 5.5; k = 2; N = 336),
females (Analysis 5.5; k = 2; N = 647), those with a history of
multiple episodes of SH (Analysis 5.5; k = 2; N = 296), or those
without a history of multiple episodes of SH (Analysis 5.5; k =
2; N = 688) by the 12-month follow-up assessment in two trials.
Correspondence with study authors revealed no significant treat-
ment effect for postcards on frequency of repetition in either males
(mean 0.33, SD 1.07, n = 116 vs mean 0.29, SD 0.82, n = 104;
MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.29; k = 1; N = 220), females (mean
0.14, SD 0.52, n = 101 vs mean 0.21, SD 0.59, n = 151; MD -

 6.5 Suicidal ideation
One trial recorded information on suicidal ideation at both
the post-intervention assessment and 12-months’ follow-up (
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2015).
There was a significant treatment effect for the number of peo-
ple reporting suicidal ideation at the post-intervention assessment
(302/1043 vs 446/1070; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.68; k = 1;
N = 2113). Data reported by the trial authors in a subsequent
follow-up paper suggested that this effect was maintained at the
12-month follow-up assessment (465/997 vs 588/1004; OR 0.62,
95% CI 0.52 to 0.74; k = 1; N = 2001; Hassanian-Moghaddam
2015).
6.6 Problem solving
No data available.
6.7 Suicide
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for post-
cards on suicide by the post-intervention assessment (Analysis 5.6;
k = 4; N = 3464). Excluding Carter 2005, however, suggested a
harmful effect of postcards on suicides (OR 3.74, 95% CI 1.04 to
13.51; k = 3; N = 2692).
Dataonsuicidesbythe 12-month follow-upassessment were avail-
able for one trial (i.e., Carter 2005); however, no significant treat-
ment effect was found (Analysis 5.7; k = 1; N = 772).
Emergency cards vs TAU
Two trials investigated the effectiveness of providing an emergency
contact card (’green card’) providing 24-hour access to emergency
advice from a psychiatrist in addition to TAU in adults admitted
to general hospitals following an episode of SH, most frequently
self-poisoning (Evans 1999a, N = 827; Morgan 1993, N = 212).
Evans 1999a reported data on repetition of SH in a secondary trial
publication (Evans 2005).
Primary outcome
6.8 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for emer-
gency cards on repetition of SH by the post-intervention assess-
ment (Analysis 5.1; k = 2; N = 1039). Quality of evidence for
this outcome was low (see Summary of findings 6). There was
also no evidence of a significant treatment effect for emergency
cards by the time of the 12-month follow-up assessment in Evans
1999a (Analysis 5.2; k = 1; N = 827). For this outcome, quality
of evidence as assessed by the GRADE criteria was moderate (see
Summary of findings 6).
Evans 1999a disaggregated data on repetition of SH by repeater
status (i.e., those without a history of multiple episodes of SH
versus those with a history of multiple episodes of SH) in post hoc
analyses. Whilst there was no evidence of a significant treatment
effect for emergency cards on repetition of SH in those without a
history of multiple episodes of SH (18/221 vs 25/206; OR 0.64,
95% CI 0.34 to 1.22; k = 1; N = 427), emergency cards were
associated with a significantly increased risk of repetition of SH
in those with a history of multiple episodes of SH (52/194 vs 33/
200; OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.03; k = 1; N = 394) in this trial.
Evans 1999a also reported data on frequency of repetition of SH as
the proportion with no episodes at follow-up, the proportion with
a single episode at follow-up, and the proportion of two or more
repeat episodes of SH by the 12-month follow-up assessment.
There was no significant difference between groups in the number
of participants who had none (347/417 vs 351/410; OR 0.83,
95% CI 0.57 to 1.21; k = 1; N = 827), one (46/417 vs 32/410;
OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.35; k = 1; N = 827), or two or more
(24/417 vs 27/410; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.53; k = 1; N =
827) episodes of SH over the six-month follow-up period.
This authors also presented data on frequency of repetition of SH
by repeater status in post hoc analyses. For those without a history
of multiple episodes of SH, there was no significant difference
between groups in the number of participants who had none (203/
221 vs 181/206; OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.95; k = 1; N = 427),
one (13/221 vs 16/206; OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.58; k = 1;
N = 427), or two or more (5/221 vs 9/206; OR 0.51, 95% CI
0.17 to 1.54; k = 1; N = 427) repeat episodes of SH. For those
with a history of multiple episodes of SH, however, receipt of an
emergency card was associated with a significant reduction in the
numberof participantswith nofurtherepisodesof SH(142/194 vs
167/200; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.88; k = 1; N = 394) coupled
with a significant increase in the number of participants with one
repeat episode of SH (33/194 vs 15/200; OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33 to
4.82; k = 1; N = 394). There was no significant difference between
the experimental and control groups with respect to the number
of participants with or two or more subsequent episodes of SH for
those with a history of multiple episodes of SH, however (19/194
vs 18/200; OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.16; k = 1; N = 394).

6.14 Suicide
Data on suicides were reported in only one trial (Evans 1999a).
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for emer-
gency cards on suicide by the time of the six-month follow-up
assessment (2/417 vs 1/410; OR 1.97, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.82; k
= 1; N = 827).
General practitioner’s letter vs TAU
A single, cluster-randomised controlled trial compared the effec-
tiveness of a letter from patients’ general practitioners following
discharge from hospital care offering an appointment and advice
on patient management versus TAU over a 12-month follow-up
period (Bennewith 2002, clusters = 98 practices, N = 1932).
We were unable to adjust for the effects of clustering in this anal-
ysis, as the study authors could not provide us with either the in-
tercluster coefficient or the design effect. Therefore the effects we
report for this intervention should be interpreted with caution.
Primary outcome
6.15 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for a letter
from patients’ general practitioners on repetition of SH by the 12-
month follow-up assessment (211/964 vs 189/968; OR 1.15, 95%
CI 0.93 to 1.44; k = 1; N = 1932). A moderate quality of evidence
was associated with this outcome (see Summary of findings 6).
A post hoc analysis by sex, however, suggested that whilst there
was no significant treatment effect for males (82/383 vs 84/413;
OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; k = 1; N = 796), a GP letter was
associated with a significant treatment effect on repetition of SH
for females (30/581 vs 105/555; OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.36;
k = 1; N = 1136).
Inasecondposthocanalysis, the authorsalsoanalysedrepetitionof
SH by repeater status at trial entry and concluded that “[t]he odds
ratio for the effect of the intervention in patients with a history of
self-harm was 0.57 (0.33 to 0.98), indicating a beneficial effect,
and in those with no history was 1.32 (1.02 to 1.70), indicating
a harmful effect” (Bennewith 2002, p. 1258). As the raw data on
which these sub-group results were based is not reported, we were
unable to reproduce these results in this review.
Secondary outcomes
6.16 Treatment adherence
There was no significant treatment effect for the number of par-
ticipants with at least one contact with treatment services by the
time of the 12-month follow-up assessment (351/599 vs 387/681;
OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.34; k = 1; N = 1280).

T
elephone contact vs TAU
Three trials investigated the effectiveness of telephone contact in
adults admitted to emergency departments following a ’suicide
attempt’ (i.e., suggestive of suicidal intent) (Cedereke 2002, N =
216; Vaiva 2006, N = 605; Wei 2013, N = 157).
Primary outcome
6.22 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for tele-
phone contact on repetition of SH at the six-month follow-up
assessment in Wei 2013 (1/41 vs 4/40; OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.02
to 2.11; k = 1; N = 81), by the 12-month follow-up period in
Cedereke 2002(14/83 vs 15/89; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.23;
k = 1; N = 172), or by the 24-month follow-up period in Vaiva
2006 (44/293 vs 59/312; OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; k = 1;

 N = 605). Combining data for these three time points indicated
no significant treatment effect for telephone contact by the final
follow-up point (Analysis 5.3; k = 3; N = 840). Quality of evidence
for these three time points was very low to low (see Summary of
findings 6).
With respect to frequency of repetition of SH, the mean number
of episodes of SH was similar between treatment groups in both
Cedereke 2002 (0.31 vs 0.30) and Vaiva 2006 (0.15 vs 0.19).
However, as study authors did not report information on SDs, t-
test or F statistics, we were unable to impute SDs using the method
outlined in Townsend 2001 to calculate the mean difference in
the number of repeat episodes of SH between groups in these two
trials.
Secondary outcomes
6.23 Treatment adherence
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on the
number of patients attending treatment at least once by 12-month
follow-up assessment in one trial (60/83 vs 58/89, OR 1.39, 95%
CI 0.73 to 2.67; k = 1; N = 172; Cedereke 2002).
6.24 Depression
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for tele-
phone contact on depression at either the six-month (mean 6.01,
SD 8.87, n = 41 vs mean 5.85, SD 8.16, n = 40; MD 0.16, 95%
CI -3.55 to 3.87; k = 1; N = 81) or the 12-month (mean 5.73, SD
8.71, n = 36 vs mean 5.84, SD 8.23, n = 27; MD -0.11, 95% CI
-4.32 to 4.10; k = 1; N = 63) follow-up assessments in the only
trial of telephone contact to report data on depression scores (Wei
2013).
6.25 Hopelessness
No data available.
6.26 Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation was recorded continuously in Cedereke 2002,
whereas Wei 2013 recorded data on suicidal ideation dichoto-
mously as the proportion self-reporting an episode of suicidal
ideation.
In Cedereke 2002, telephone contact was not associated with a
significant treatment effect on suicidal ideation scores by the 12-
month follow-up assessment (mean 5.80, SD 7.80, N = 5 vs mean
4.00, SD 6.20, N = 8; MD 1.80, 95% CI -6.27 to 9.87; k = 1; N
= 13).
Telephone contact was also not associated with a significant treat-
ment effect on the proportion of participants reporting suicidal
ideation by the six-month follow-up assessment in Wei 2013 (26/
41 vs 24/40; OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.83; k = 1; N = 81). By the
12-month follow-up assessment, however, telephone contact was
associated with a significant treatment effect on the proportion of
participants reporting suicidal ideation in this trial (24/36 vs 25/
27; OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.79; k = 1; N = 63).
6.27 Problem solving
No data available.
6.28 Suicide
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for tele-
phone contact on suicides by either the 12-month (1/107 vs 1/
109; OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.50; k = 1; N = 216; Cedereke
2002) or 24-month (1/293 vs 2/312; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.05 to
5.89; k = 1; N = 605; Vaiva 2006) follow-up assessments. Com-
bining data from these trials suggested no evidence of a signifi-
cant treatment effect by the time of the final follow-up assessment
(Analysis 5.8; k = 2; N = 821).
Mobile telephone-based psychotherapy vs TAU
One trial assessed the effectiveness of psychotherapy, including
elements of training in problem-solving therapy, meditation and
social support, delivered by mobile telephone over a six-month
follow-up period in adults admitted to general hospitals following
an episode of SH with significant suicidal intent (Marasinghe
2012; N = 68). As this trial used a cross-over design, we report only
data from the post-intervention assessment (i.e., prior to cross-
over) in this review.
Primary outcome
6.29 Repetition of SH
Data obtained by correspondence from the authors indicated there
were no repeat episodes of SH in either the treatment or control
groups by the post-intervention assessment. It was therefore not
possible to calculate the pooled odds ratio and accompanying 95%
confidence interval owing to zero cell counts (Analysis 5.1; k = 1;
N = 68). A low quality of evidence was apparent for this outcome
(see Summary of findings 6).

 6.31 Depression
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for mobile
telephone-based psychotherapy for depression at the post-inter-
vention assessment (mean 7.00, SD 5.00, n = 34 vs mean 14.60,
SD 10.40, n = 34; MD -7.60, 95% CI -11.48 to -3.72; k = 1; N
= 68).
However, a priori analyses suggested that this effect varied by sex.
Mobile telephone-based psychotherapy was associated with a sig-
nificant treatment effect for depression at the post-intervention
assessment in males (mean 5.90, SD 2.40, n = 17 vs mean 13.30,
SD 6.10, n = 17; MD -7.40, 95% CI -10.52 to -4.28; k = 1; N
= 34) but not in females (mean 8.10, SD 6.30, n = 17 vs mean
11.60, SD 6.50, n = 17; MD -3.50, 95% CI -7.80 to 0.80; k = 1;
N = 34).
6.32 Hopelessness

6.34 Suicidal ideation
There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for mobile
telephone-based psychotherapy for suicidal ideation at the post-
intervention assessment (mean 3.60, SD 1.60, n = 34 vs mean
7.30, SD 5.50, n = 34; MD -3.70, 95% CI -5.63 to -1.77; k = 1;
N = 68) in this trial.
When we analysed results separately by sex, however, there was
no evidence of a significant treatment effect for mobile telephone-
based psychotherapy for suicidal ideation at the post-intervention
assessment in males (mean 3.50, SD 1.80, n = 17 vs mean 6.20,
SD 5.50, n = 17; MD -2.70, 95% CI -5.45 to 0.05; k = 1; N =
34). There was, however, a significant treatment effect for females
(mean 3.80, SD 1.40, n = 17 vs mean 8.90, SD 6.20, n = 17; MD
-5.10, 95% CI -8.12 to -2.08; k = 1; N = 34).
6.35 Problem solving
No data available.
6.36 Suicide
Information obtained by correspondence indicated that there was
one suicide in the experimental group by the time of the post-
intervention assessment and none in the control group. Mobile
telephone-based psychotherapy was not associated with a signifi-
cant treatment effect for suicide by this time point (Analysis 5.6;
k = 1; N = 68).
Comparison 7: Other mixed interventions vs TAU or
other alternative forms of psychotherapy
A number of single, small trials investigated the effectiveness of
other types of heterogeneous interventions, including: interper-
sonal problem-solving skills training (vs TAU; McLeavey 1994),
behaviour therapy (vs other alternative forms of psychother-
apy; Liberman 1981), provision of information and support (vs
TAU; Fleischmann 2008), treatment for alcohol misuse (vs TAU;
Crawford 2010), home-based problem-solving therapy (vs other
alternative forms of psychotherapy; Hawton 1981), intensive in-
patient and community treatment (vs TAU; Van der Sande 1997a,
general hospital admission (vs other alternative forms of psy-
chotherapy; Waterhouse 1990), intensive outpatient treatment (vs
TAU; Allard 1992; Welu 1977), and long-term therapy (vs other
alternative forms of psychotherapy; Torhorst 1988).
Interpersonal problem-solving skills training vs other
alternative forms of psychotherapy
One small trial compared the effectiveness of interpersonal prob-
lem-solving skills training (IPSST) with brief problem-oriented
therapy in adults admitted to accident and emergency facilities
following an episode of self-poisoning (McLeavey 1994; N = 39).
Primary outcome
7.1 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for repeti-
tion of SH, defined as a ’self-poisoning act’, within the 12-month
follow-up period (2/17 vs 4/16; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.57;
k = 1; N = 33) in this trial. A very low quality of evidence was
associated with this outcome (see Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.2 Treatment adherence
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect on the
number of participants who completed the full course of treatment
(2/19 vs 3/20; OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.51; k = 1; N =
39).There was, however, evidence for a significant treatment effect
in terms of the number of treatment sessions attended (mean 5.30,
SD 0.48, n = 17 vs mean 4.20, SD 1.32, n = 16; MD 1.10, 95%
CI 0.41 to 1.79; k = 1; N = 33).

 7.4 Hopelessness
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for hope-
lessness at the six-month follow-up assessment (mean 6.12, SD
4.61, n = 19 vs mean 4.35, SD 4.39, n = 20; MD 1.77, 95% CI
-1.06 to 4.60; k = 1; N = 39).
7.5 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
7.6 Problem solving
Analysis of means estimated by the review authors from graph-
ics in the original report suggests that, at the post-intervention
assessment, participants allocated to the experimental group had
scores within the normal range whilst those allocated to the con-
trol group remained impaired according to both the Means-Ends
Problem-Solving Scale (estimated means 6.4 vs 2.9) and the Self-
Rated Problem Solving Scale (estimated means 89.8 vs 78.0). Ad-
ditionally, participants in the experimental group reported feeling
more confident in solving problems post-treatment according to
scores on the Perceived Ability to Solve Current Problems scale
(estimated means 0.9 vs 1.9). Lastly, both groups reported a reduc-
tion in self-reported number of problems (estimated means 1.1 vs
1.5).
Results reported by the trial authors suggest an equal benefit of
both treatments in reducing the “number of presenting problems .
. .” (McLeavey 1994, p. 382). However, the authors conclude that
IPSST was “significantly more effective . . . as determined by other
outcome measures . . .” including measures of interpersonal cogni-
tive problem-solving, self-rated personal problem-solving ability,
and perceived ability to cope with ongoing problems (McLeavey
1994, p.382).
7.7 Suicide
There were no suicides in either group during the 12-month fol-
low-up period.
Behaviour therapy vs other alternative forms of
psychotherapy
One small trial compared the effectiveness of behaviour therapy
versus insight-oriented therapy in adults referred for inpatient
treatment following a suicide attempt (Liberman 1981; N = 24).
Primary outcome
7.8 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect with regards
to the number of patients repeating SH by the 24-month follow-
up period (2/12 vs 3/12; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.45; k = 1; N
= 24). This outcome was associated with a low quality of evidence
(see Summary of findings 7)
Secondary outcomes
7.9 Treatment adherence

7.10 Depression
Depression was measured using both the BDI and the ZSRDS in
this trial. There was evidence of a significant treatment effect for
behaviour therapy at the post-treatment assessment according to
both measures (BDI: mean 4.00, SD 4.00, n = 12 vs mean 14.00,
SD 12.00, n = 12; MD -10.00, 95% CI -17.16 to -2.84; k = 1; N

At the six-month (24-week) follow-up assessment, although there
was no significant treatment effect for depression according to the
ZSRDS (mean 34.00, SD 8.00, n = 12 vs mean 41.00, SD 13.00,
n = 12; MD -7.00, 95% CI -15.64 to 1.64; k = 1; N = 24), BDI
scores did show an effect (mean 4.00, SD 6.00, n = 12 vs mean
13.00, SD 11.00, n = 12; MD -9.00, 95% CI -16.09 to -1.91; k

7.12 Suicidal ideation
There was no evidence of a significant effect for behaviour therapy
on the number of patients reporting suicidal ideation at the 24-

 Provision of information and support vs TAU
The effectiveness of providing a one-off hospital-based informa-
tion session combined with regular home visits and/or telephone
contactinadditiontoTAUoveran18month follow-up periodwas
investigated in one multicentre trial (SUPRE-MISS) conducted
in ten countries, although data from only five of these countries
are reported in Bertolote 2010 (N = 1,663) and Fleischmann
2008 (N = 1,699). Data from three of the individual countries (
Hassanzadeh 2010, N = 632; Vijayakumar 2011, N = 680; Xu
2012, N = 111) were also included for some outcomes.
Correspondence with authors indicted that the term ’attempted
suicide’ in this trial was used to refer to SH both with and without
suicidal intent.
Primary outcome
7.15 Repetition of SH
For the overall SUPRE-MISS cohort, data from Bertolote 2010
indicated there was no evidence for a significant treatment effect
for information and support on repetition of SH by the 18-month
follow-up assessment (66/863 vs 60/800; OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71
to 1.47; k = 1; N = 1663). This outcome was associated with
low quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria (see
Summary of findings 7).
Data on repetition of SH were also available for males and females
separately. Overall, across all five sites, there was no evidence of a
significant treatment effect on repetition of SH by the 18-month
follow-up assessment in either males (30/349 vs 27/340; OR 1.09,
95% CI 0.63 to 1.88; k = 1; N = 689) or females (36/514 vs 33/
460; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.59; k = 1; N = 974).
Data on repetition of SH by the 18-month follow-up assessment
were also available for each of the five countries separately. Al-
though there was no significant difference between groups for the
individual sites in Campinas, Brazil (21/71 vs 10/64; OR 2.27,
95% CI 0.97 to 5.28; k = 1; N = 135), Colombo, Sri Lanka (3/
130 vs 5/121; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.34; k = 1; N = 251),
Karaj, Iran (33/303 vs 28/298; OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.00;
k = 1; N = 601), and Yuncheng, China (1/58 vs 0/38; OR 2.01,
95% CI 0.08 to 50.60; k = 1; N = 96), significantly fewer par-
ticipants in the experimental group had repeated SH by the 18-
month follow-up period at the Chennai, India site (8/301 vs 17/
260; OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; k = 1; N = 561). Quality
of evidence for these five sites varied from very low to low (see
Summary of findings 7).
Breaking results down by gender revealed no significant effect for
information and support on repetition of SH by the 18-month
follow-up assessment for either gender at either of the five study
sites [Campinas, Brazil: males 4/21 vs. 3/25; OR 1.73, 95% CI
0.34 to 8.76; k = 1; N = 46 versus females 17/50 vs. 7/39; OR

= 1; N = 36 versus females 0/41 vs. 0/38; OR not calculable; k =
1; N = 79].
Hassanzadeh 2010 reported data on frequency of SH for one sub-
sample atthe six-month follow-upassessmentinKaraj, Iran. Inthis
sample, there was evidence of a significant increase in frequency
of repetition of SH in the information and support group relative
to the TAU group (mean 1.63, SD 1.19, n = 319 vs mean 1.17,
SD 0.38, n = 310; MD 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60; k = 1; N =
629). Quality of evidence for this outcome was low (see Summary
of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.16 Treatment adherence

7.17 Depression
Correspondence with authors revealed that information on de-
pression was recorded at one site only: Yuncheng, China (reported
by Xu 2012). Information and support was associated with a sig-
nificant treatment effect for depression scores at this site by the
18-month follow-up assessment (mean 2.51, SD 3.25, n = 57 vs
mean 5.60, SD 9.25, n = 54; MD -3.09, 95% CI -5.70 to -0.48;

7.20 Problem solving
Correspondence with authors revealed that information on prob-
lem solving was reported for one site only: Yuncheng, China (re-
ported in Xu 2012). There was evidence of a significant treatment
effect for information and support at this site by the 18-month
follow-up assessment (mean 0.64, SD 0.29, n = 57 vs mean 0.52,
SD 0.30, n = 54; MD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; k = 1; N = 111).

 7.21 Suicide
In the overall SUPRE-MISS cohort, as reported in the primary
study reference (Fleischmann 2008), there was evidence of a sig-
nificant treatment effect for information and support on suicide
by the 18-month follow-up period (2/872 vs 18/827; OR 0.10,
95% CI 0.02 to 0.45; k = 1; N = 1699).
Data on suicides were also available for three of the five study
sites in related publications: Vijayakumar 2011 reported data from
Chennai, India, Hassanzadeh 2010 from Karaj, Iran, and Xu
2012 from Yuncheng, China. There was evidence of a significant
treatment effect for information and support on suicides by the
18-month follow-up assessment at the Chennai, India site (1/302
vs 9/320; OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.91; k = 1; N = 622) but not
at either the Karaj, Iran (2/319 vs 2/310; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.14
to 6.94; k = 1; N = 629) or the Yuncheng, China (0/57 vs 2/54;
OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.89; k = 1; N = 111) sites.
Notably, the number of completed suicides in the experimental
group reported for these three subsamples is greater than the num-
ber reported for the overall SUPRE-MISS cohort in the primary
study reference (i.e., Fleischmann 2008). We were unable to con-
firm the correct number of completed suicides in the experimental
group with the authors. Including the one additional suicide for
the experimental group identified from the three subsample pub-
lications with the data reported in the primary study reference,
however, did not materially affect the result obtained for the over-
all SUPRE-MISS cohort.
Treatment for alcohol misuse vs TAU
One trial investigated the effectiveness of a brief intervention for
alcohol misuse on repetition of SH over a six-month follow-up
period in adults who were misusing alcohol and were admitted
to emergency departments following an episode of SH (Crawford
2010; N = 103).
Primary outcome
7.22 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for treat-
ment for alcohol misuse on repetition of SH by the six-month
follow-up period (7/52 vs11/51; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.60;
k = 1; N = 103). This was associated with a moderate quality of
evidence (see Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.23 Treatment adherence
The study authors report that only 47.1% of those randomised to
the experimental group attended the brief alcohol treatment ses-
sion (Crawford 2010, p.1826). However, as corresponding num-
bers were not available for the control group, who did not receive
an invitation to a brief alcohol treatment session, we could not
calculate treatment effect sizes for this outcome.
7.24 Depression
No data available.
7.25 Hopelessness
No data available.
7.26 Suicidal ideation
No data available.
7.27 Problem solving
No data available.
7.28 Suicide
Correspondence with authors confirmed that no participants died
by suicide in either group over the course of the six-month follow-
up period. However, the authors warn that as they were unable to
track participants via their National Health Service (NHS) iden-
tity numbers, they were unable to confirm numbers of suicides
from national mortality data. Thus, there may have been suicides
amongst those participants whom the authors were unable to con-
tact by the six-month follow-up assessment.
Home-based problem-solving therapy vs other alternative
forms of psychotherapy
Hawton 1981 (N = 96) investigated the effectiveness of brief prob-
lem-oriented counselling delivered in two different ways, namely
as a flexibly-timed home-based therapy, combined with open ac-
cess via telephone services to the general hospital psychiatric ser-
vice, versus treatment in weekly outpatient clinics, in adults re-
ferred to the psychiatric department of a general hospital following
admission for self-poisoning, irrespective of intent.
Primary outcome
7.29 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for home-
based problem-solving therapy on repetition of SH by the 12-
month follow-up assessment (5/48 vs 7/48; OR 0.68; 95% CI
44

 0.20 to 2.32; k = 1; N = 96). Quality of evidence, as assessed
using the GRADE criteria, was moderate for this outcome (see
Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.30 Treatment adherence
There was, however, a significant treatment effect for home-based
problem-solving therapy on the number of participants who at-
tended at least one treatment session over the course of the 12-
month follow-up period (45/48 vs 35/48; OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.47
to 21.08; k = 1; N = 96).
7.31 Depression
Although this trial included data on depression, the authors mod-
ified the scale used (Lorr and McNair Mood Scale; McNair 1964;
Lorr 1967), thereby precluding inclusion of this data in this re-
view.
7.32 Hopelessness
No data available.
7.33 Suicidal Ideation
Data obtained by correspondence suggested there was no signifi-
cant treatment effect for suicidal ideation at either the post-treat-
ment assessment (Mann-Whitney U = 984, P = 0.29) or six-month
follow-up (Mann-Whitney U = 726, P = 0.14). As only median,
rather than mean, scores were available for this outcome, we were
unable to reproduce the mean difference in suicidal ideation scores
between the experimental and control groups in this review.
7.34 Problem solving
No data available.
7.35 Suicide
No data available.
Intensive inpatient and community treatment vs TAU
One trial compared the effectiveness of brief psychiatric inpatient
admission followed by regular outpatient appointments and 24-
hour access to the psychiatric unit with TAU over a 12-month
follow-up period in adults admitted to a general hospital following
a ’suicide attempt’ (i.e., suggestive of suicidal intent) (Van der
Sande 1997a, N = 274).
Primary outcome
7.36 Repetition of SH
There wasnoevidence of asignificanttreatmenteffectforintensive
inpatient and community treatment on repetition of SH by the
12-month follow-up (24/140 vs 20/134; OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.62
to 2.25; k = 1; N = 274). Quality of evidence, according to the
GRADE criteria, was low for this outcome (see Summary of
findings 7).
With respect to frequency of repetition of SH, there was also no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for intensive inpatient
and community treatment (mean 0.23, SD 0.57, n = 140 vs mean
0.23, SD 0.81, n = 134; MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.17, k = 1;
N = 274). Quality of evidence for this outcome was also low (see
Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.37 Treatment adherence
There was a significant treatment effect for treatment adherence.
More patients in the experimental group attended at least one out-
patient treatment session by the 12-month follow-up assessment
(119/140 vs 64/134; OR 6.99, 95% CI 3.69 to 12.36; k = 1; N
= 274). However, there was no difference in the total number of
treatment sessions attended (mean 14.30, SD 24.20, n = 140 vs
mean 11.40, SD 27.70, n = 134; MD 2.90, 95% CI -3.27 to 9.07;
k = 1; N = 274).
7.38 Depression
There was no significant treatment effect for intensive inpatient
and community treatment on depression scores by the 12-month
follow-up assessment (mean 30.80, SD 15.90, n = 94 vs mean
35.80, SD 16.20, n = 50; MD -5.00, 95% CI -10.52 to 0.52; k =

General hospital admission vs other alternative forms of
psychotherapy
One trial investigated the effectiveness of general hospital admis-
sion versus non-admission over a four-month follow-up period
in a group of adults attending an emergency room following an
episode of self-poisoning, who had no immediate medical or psy-
chiatric treatment needs (Waterhouse 1990, N = 77). In this trial,
admission was described as consisting of little more than admis-
sion to an inpatient bed. The investigators did not attempt to in-
fluence referral to psychiatric or other treatment services. The me-
dian length of admission for those allocated to the experimental
group was 17 hours.
Primary outcome
7.43 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for hospital
admission on repetition of SH at the post-intervention assessment
(2/38 vs 2/39; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.69; k = 1; N = 77) or
by the four-month follow-up assessment (3/38 vs 4/39; OR 0.75,
95% CI 0.16 to 3.60; k = 1; N = 77). Quality of evidence for these
time points was low (see Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.44 Treatment adherence
No data available.
7.45 Depression
No data available.
7.46 Hopelessness
The authors state that there was no significant difference in hope-
lessness scores at the post-intervention assessment (mean 10.29,
SD 5.68 vs mean 10.21, SD 4.97); however, they did not provide
the numbers of patients in each group, thus precluding calculation
of the MD and its associated 95% CI.
7.47 Suicidal ideation
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for hospital
admission on suicidal ideation scores by the four-month follow-
up assessment (mean 0.22, SD 0.85, n = 27 vs mean 0.04, SD
0.20, n = 25; MD 0.18, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.51; k = 1; N = 52).

7.49 Suicide
No data available.
Intensive outpatient treatment vs TAU
Two trials compared the effectiveness of intensive outreach inter-
ventions with standard outpatient care in adults admitted to emer-
gency departments following a ’suicide attempt’ (i.e., suggestive
of suicidal intent) (Allard 1992, N = 150; Welu 1977, N = 119).
Allard1992 compared an intensive intervention, involving psychi-
atrists and a social worker, a schedule of visits including at least one
home visit, therapy provided where needed, reminders (telephone
or written), and home visits with treatment by regular personnel
in the same hospital over a 12-month treatment period. Thera-
pies in the experimental group varied, and drug therapy was also
an option. Welu 1977 compared a specialist, intensive outreach
programme in which a community mental health team contacted
participants immediately after discharge and arranged home visits
and weekly or bi-weekly contact with therapists alongside routine
psychiatric consultation.
Primary outcome
7.50 Repetition of SH
There wasnoevidence of asignificanttreatmenteffectforintensive
intervention on repetition of SH by either the four-month (Welu
1977: 3/62 vs 9/57; OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.06; k = 1; N =
119) or 24-month (Allard 1992: 22/63 vs 19/63; OR 1.24, 95%
CI 0.59 to 2.62; k = 1; N = 126) follow-up assessments. For both
follow-up periods, quality of evidence was low(see Summary of
findings 7). We combined the results of these two trials, and again
there was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for intensive
outpatient intervention by the final follow-up point (Analysis 6.1;
k = 2; N = 245). The quality of evidence was very low for this
outcome (see Summary of findings 7).
In the one trial that reported information on frequency of SH over
the course of the 24-month follow-up period (i.e., Allard 1992),
“the experimental subjects did not make fewer attempts than the
comparison subjects” (Allard 1992, p. 310).

 Secondary outcomes
7.51 Treatment adherence
Data on treatment adherence were only available for Allard 1992.
However, as the authors did not report information on SDs, t-test
or F statistics we were unable to impute SDs using the method
outlined in Townsend 2001 to calculate the mean difference in the
number of treatment sessions attended. Nevertheless, the authors
themselves report that “[t]he mean numbers of encounters with
psychiatrists were 12.35 versus 1.54 (P < 0.001) in the first year
and 2.11 versus 0.64 (P = 0.071) in the second year” (Allard 1992,
p. 311).

7.56 Suicide
Allard 1992 reported data on suicide during follow-up. There
was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for the intensive
outpatient intervention on suicides, however, by the 24-month
follow-up assessment (3/76 vs 1/74; OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.30 to
29.52; k = 1; N = 150) in this trial.
Long-term psychotherapy vs other alternative forms of
psychotherapy
One trial investigated the effectiveness of long-term (one session
per month over 12 months) versus short-term (one session per
week over 12 weeks) outpatient psychotherapy on repetition of SH
over a 12-month follow-up period in adults admitted to hospital
due to repeated episodes of self-poisoning (Torhorst 1988, N =
80). The content of therapy was not specified in this trial, however.
Primary outcome
7.57 Repetition of SH
There was no evidence of a significant treatment effect for long-
term therapy on repetition of SH by the post-treatment assessment
(9/40 vs 9/40; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.86; k = 1; N = 80).
A low quality of evidence was associated with this outcome (see
Summary of findings 7).
Secondary outcomes
7.58 Treatment adherence
The authors did not provide numerical data on treatment adher-
ence, although they state, “[a]ttendance at the first session was
about equal for both groups (about 60%)” (Torhorst 1988, p.
420). However, the authors further state that “participation of the
12-month (long-term therapy) group dropped drastically by the
second session to under 40%, while the participation of the pa-
tients in the 3-month (intensive short-term therapy) program re-
mained higher” (Torhorst 1988, p. 420). It is unclear whether this
difference was significant.
Overall adherence also appears to have been very low in both
groups as the “average number of sessions was 3.9 (out of a possible
12 sessions) in the three-month group and 2.6 (out of a possible 12
sessions) for the 12-month group” (Torhorst 1988, p.420). Again,
it is unclear whether this difference is significant. Additionally, as
neither SDs, nor t-test, nor F statistics were reported, we were
unable to impute SDs using the method outlined in Townsend
2001 to calculate the mean difference in the number of treatment
sessions attended by the experimental and control groups.
7.59 Depression
Although numerical data on depression scores were not available,
means estimated by the review authors from a graph in the orig-
inal report suggest there was little difference in depression scores
between those allocated to long-term therapy and those allocated
to short-term therapy by the 12-month follow-up assessment (es-
timated means 9.3 vs 6.7).
The studyauthors, however, statedthat“self-evaluateddepressivity
. . . improvedconsiderablymore forthe patientsof the three-month
program than for those of the 12-month program” (Torhorst
1988, p. 421). This improvement was described by the authors as
significant.

Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
This systematic review represents an update of previous versions
(Hawton 1998; Hawton 1999; NICE 2011). Whilst those ver-
sions included psychosocial and pharmacological interventions as
well as data for adults, children and adolescents who engage in SH,
this update focused solely on psychosocial treatments for adults. In
the previous versions of this review, we only focused on a limited
number of clinical outcomes, namely repetition of SH and suicide.
In this update we have considerably expanded the range of clini-
cally relevant outcomes examined to include treatment adherence,
depression, hopelessness, problem-solving, and suicidal ideation
where available. We also reported frequency of SH where data on
this outcome were available. For the primary outcome of SH, we
have included SH episodes with any type of motivation, including
suicidal. Where we clarified suicidal intent with study authors a
number reported including all episodes of SH irrespective of sui-
cidal intent despite inclusion criteria suggesting that only those
indicating intent to die were eligible to participate, highlighting
the problems in attempting to ascertain suicidal intent.
Recently there has been a considerable increase in the number
of trials conducted in this field and in the types of interventions
evaluated, reflecting the international concern about self-harm,
the increased attention to suicide prevention in particular, and the
involvement of newer countries in this research, especially in Asia.
Previously we commented on the fact that the majority of trials
included either patients who had all taken overdoses, or samples
where the majority had, reflecting the types of patients who present
to general hospitals following SH (Hawton 2007). However, there
are other important patient subgroups, especially those who en-
gage in self-mutilation. Some of the more recent trials in this re-
view included such participants, particularly those that focused
on patients who had a history of multiple episodes of SH at trial
entry (e.g., Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014; Harned 2014; Linehan 1991;
Linehan 2006; McMain 2009; Priebe 2012; Weinberg 2006). It
should be noted that people who repeat SH may change the meth-
ods they use (Owens 2015; Lilley 2008). It is also important to
note that multiple repetition of SH is associated with increased
suicide risk (Zahl 2004).
None of the trials included information on adverse effects of these
interventions, other than further suicidal behaviour.
We have used the intention-to-treat method where data allowed.
This was usually possible when examining the outcomes of repe-
tition of SH and suicide. Where outcomes relied on patient inter-
view, this was generally not possible and we have instead used all
available case data.
Summary of main results
CBT-based psychotherapy
There were 18 trials that compared CBT-based psychotherapy,
comprising cognitive behavioural therapy, problem-solving ther-
apy, or both, versus treatment as usual (TAU) (Brown 2005;
Davidson 2014; Dubois 1999; Evans 1999b; Gibbons 1978;
Guthrie 2001; Hatcher 2011; Hawton 1987a; Husain 2014;
McAuliffe 2014; Patsiokas 1985; Salkovskis 1990; Slee 2008;
Stewart 2009; Tapolaa 2010; Tyrer 2003; Wei 2013; Weinberg
2006). Meta-analysis of these trials provided evidence to suggest
a reduction in repetition of SH at both 6 and 12 months after
trial entry and at final follow-up. However, we did not find any
significant treatment effect for CBT-based psychotherapy on the
frequency of SH at final follow-up. On the basis of data from 15
trials, there was no evidence of a significant effect of psychological
therapy on suicides, although relatively few events (i.e., 24) were
recorded. We also found beneficial effects for depression and hope-
lessness at 6 and 12 months as well as at final follow-up. Few trials
assessed suicidal ideation, although there was an apparent benefit
for CBT-based psychotherapy at three months, six months, and
at final follow-up. Relatively few trials reported findings for treat-
ment adherence, and they did so in different ways, so we cannot
draw firm conclusions for this outcome.
Interventions for multiple repetition of SH/probable
personality disorder
Group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy
On the basis of two trials, conducted by the same research group,
emotion-regulation therapy for patients with borderline personal-
ity disorder provided in a group-based setting was associated with
a reduction in the proportion of patients repeating SH in the final
two months of the initial treatment period, but not with an overall
reduction in the frequency of SH over the whole treatment period
(Gratz 2006; Gratz 2014). There was also no effect for this type
of therapy on depression.
Mentalisation
In a single trial, mentalisation therapy for patients diagnosed with
borderline personality disorder was associated with fewer partici-
pants repeating both SH and suicide attempts by the post-inter-
vention assessment (Bateman 2009). There were also beneficial
effects for frequency of repetition of suicide attempts and for de-
pression scores.
Dialectical behaviour therapy
Three trials compared DBT with TAU in patients diagnosed with
borderline personality disorder, with no apparent overall effect on
the proportion of patients repeating SH at 12 and 24 months
following trial entry (Linehan 1991; McMain 2009; Priebe 2012).
83
Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 There was, however, a significant treatment effect for DBT on
frequency of repetition of SH.
A single trial compared DBT versus psychological treatment by
’experts’ (CBT-E; Linehan 2006). There was no evidence of dif-
ferences in outcomes for patients in the two groups in terms of
the proportion repeating SH or in the total number for ’parasui-
cidal’ acts, although the authors stated that there was a beneficial
effect for DBT on suicide re-attempts. There were no differences
between the DBT and CBT-E groups for depression and suicidal
ideation, however.
There was no difference in terms of repetition of SH, depression,
or treatment adherence in a single small trial between two forms of
DBT, an experimental one in which participants were given signif-
icantly longer cognitive exposure to stressful events coupled with
the standard DBT protocol and a control one in which partici-
pants received the standard DBT protocol as devised by Linehan
1991 (Harned 2014).
Dialectical behaviour-oriented therapy
In a single small trial (Turner 2000), DBT-oriented therapy ap-
peared to be more effective than client-oriented therapy in terms
of the proportion of patients repeating SH and the frequency of
SH. There were also benefits for depression and suicidal ideation.
Case management
In a single trial comparing case management versus TAU, there
was no effect for the experimental treatment on the proportion
of participants repeating SH, but it was associated with fewer
multiple admissions (Clarke 2002).
Two trials compared case management with added assertive out-
reach versus TAU (Hvid 2011; Morthorst 2012). There was no
evidence of a significant treatment effect for repetition of SH, but
there was a reduction in the proportion of females repeating SH
in the experimental group in one of these trials (Hvid 2011).
A single large trial compared case management plus assertive out-
reach versus enhanced usual care (Kawanishi 2014). There was no
difference between groups for repetition of SH or for suicide by
the 24-month follow-up period, although the study authors state
that are undertaking further analyses and also data for hopeless-
ness.
Treatment adherence enhancement approaches
Adherence enhancement
In a single trial that made efforts to improve adherence with treat-
ment by having nurses make home visits to participants who had
not attended initial outpatient appointments, there were increased
rates of attendance at the outpatient clinic in the group receiving
the experimental intervention. However, in spite of a marked re-
duction in subsequent repetition of SH in this group, the differ-
ence was non-significant (Van Heeringen 1995).
Continuity of care by the same therapist
In a single trial, continuity of care (i.e., where the clinician who
assessed each participant in hospital also provided aftercare for
them) resulted in better treatment attendance than where different
therapists treated participants (Torhorst 1987). However, there
was no beneficial effect on repetition of SH.
Mixed multimodal interventions
Mixed multimodal interventions
A single large trial compared a package of interventions including
problem-solving therapy, postcards, and vouchers entitling partic-
ipants to GP care versus TAU (Hatcher 2015). However, there was
no beneficial effect for the experimental treatment on repetition
of SH, depression, or hopelessness.
Culturally-adapted mixed multimodal interventions
Hatcher 2016a adapted the treatment package developed by
Hatcher 2015 for participants self-identifying as of M
ori ethnic-
ity. There were no apparent benefits of this intervention in terms
of repetition of SH (including in subgroups of those with only a
single episode of SH prior to trial entry and those with a history
of multiple episodes of SH), depression, or hopelessness.
Remote contact interventions
Postcards
Four trials compared the effectiveness of postcards sent on a reg-
ular basis over a 12-month period with TAU (Beautrais 2010;
Carter 2005; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Kapur 2013a). How-
ever, there was no benefit for this intervention in terms of pro-
portion of patients repeating SH. Substantial heterogeneity was
associated with this analysis, and removing Kapur 2013a (a small
pilot trial which may have been an outlier) resulted in a signifi-
cant treatment effect. The single largest trial of this intervention
did find fewer patients repeating SH in the experimental group
(Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011). This result is notable because the
control treatment used in this trial would have consisted of little
more than discharge because of the paucity of psychiatric services
in Iran as compared to Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, which
have well-developed services. This raises the possibility that such
an intervention may be more effective in such settings. Addition-
ally, the postcards used in this trial included religious and philo-
sophical messages in addition to general support, which may also
explain their apparent efficacy in reducing suicidal behaviour.

 There was also no evidence of a significant treatment effect for
postcards on frequency of repetition of SH at either post-inter-
vention or at 12 or 24 months’ follow-up in three of the four trials
of postcards (Carter 2005; Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Kapur
2013a). It should be noted that the positive effect on frequency of
repetition reported in Carter 2005 was, according to the study’s
author, largely accounted for by difference in repetition in a small
subsample (less than 3% of the total sample) of women with a
history of three or more episodes of SH prior to trial entry.
Emergency cards
On the basis of two trials, there was no evidence that provision
of an emergency contact card allowing emergency access to a psy-
chiatrist on demand had an impact on repetition of SH (Evans
1999a; Morgan 1993). In the original report, however, a post hoc
subgroup analysis indicated that receipt of the emergency card was
associated with an increased risk of repetition of SH in those with
a history of multiple episodes of SH prior to the index episode
(Evans 1999a).
General practitioner’s letter
In a single trial in which general practitioners sent a letter to par-
ticipants following their discharge from hospital after SH offering
an appointment coupled with specialist advice on the manage-
ment of SH patients (Bennewith 2002), there was no apparent
beneficial effect on repetition of SH, although there was evidence
of a substantial beneficial effect in females. When analysed by re-
peater status, furthermore, there appeared to be a beneficial effect
in those with a history of multiple episodes of SH at trial entry,
but the reverse was true in those with only a single episode of SH
at trial entry.
T
elephone contact
In three trials telephone contact with patients after discharge from
hospital did not produce any apparent benefits in terms of repe-
tition of SH compared with standard care (Cedereke 2002; Vaiva
2006; Wei 2013). There was also no evidence of any impact of
telephone contact on depression, suicidal ideation, or on the pro-
portion of participants attending at least one treatment session
during the 12-month follow-up period.
Mobile telephone-based psychotherapy
A single trial delivered psychotherapy, which included elements
of problem-solving therapy, meditation, and social support, by
mobile telephone (Marasinghe 2012), but there was no effect of
this intervention on repetition of SH. In the mobile phone psy-
chotherapy group, however, depression improved more in males
compared to those assigned to the wait list control group, whereas
suicidal ideation improved more in females.
Other mixed interventions
Interpersonal problem-solving skills training
In a single trial, interpersonal problem-solving skills training
(IPSST) was no better than brief problem-oriented therapy in
terms of repetition of SH, suicide and hopelessness (McLeavey
1994), although patients in the IPSST group may have had better
scores after treatment with regard to measures of problem-solving.
Treatment adherence also did not differ between groups, although
patients in the IPSST group did attend more treatment sessions.
Behaviour therapy
In a single trial, although behaviour therapy appeared to lead to
significant reductions in depression at the 10-week post-treatment
assessment, by the nine-month follow-up assessment there was
no apparent benefit for behaviour therapy compared to insight-
oriented therapy (Liberman 1981). Behaviour therapy was also
associated with mixed findings with respect to suicidal ideation.
There was no apparent effect of behaviour therapy in reducing the
proportion of participants reporting suicidal ideation at the two-
year follow-up period, although there was some evidence of a sig-
nificant treatment effect for shorter follow-up periods. Behaviour
therapy was also not associated with a significant treatment effect
for repetition of SH over a two-year follow-up period.
Provision of information and support
In a single trial conducted in five countries, a hospital-based infor-
mation service combined with regular home support, telephone
support, or both, appeared to have no extra benefit compared to
TAU in terms of repetition of SH (Bertolote 2010). However,
when results were analysed separately by site, although no ap-
parent benefit for information and support was found for four
of the five sites, this intervention package was associated with a
significant reduction in repetition of SH at the Chennai, India
site. There was evidence of significant reduction in suicide for the
overall cohort (Fleischmann 2008) and for the Chennai, India site
(Vijayakumar 2011), but not for the remaining two sites for which
data on suicides were available (Karaj, Iran: Hassanzadeh 2010
and Yuncheng, China: Xu 2012). We have noted that there is a
discrepancy between the findings for the overall cohort and those
reported from the individual sites, in that the number of suicides
reported for the overall cohort for the experimental group is less
than that presented in three local site reports (i.e., two vs three,
respectively).
Treatment for alcohol misuse
Evaluation in a single trial of a brief intervention for alcohol misuse
in SH patients showed no significant effect for this intervention on
repetition of SH, although the proportion of participants repeat-
ing SH was somewhat lower in the experimental group (Crawford
85
Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2010). However, only 47.1% of those randomised to the experi-
mental group attended the alcohol treatment session. The original
trial report did, however, observe a non-significant trend towards
reduced alcohol consumption per drinking day in those allocated
to the experimental arm.
Home-based problem-solving psychotherapy
In a single trial, home-based problem-solving psychotherapy re-
sulted in better treatment adherence than outpatient problem-
solving therapy, but there was no difference in repetition of SH, de-
pression, or suicidal ideation between the groups (Hawton 1981).
Intensive inpatient and community treatment
A single trial compared an intervention involving brief psychiatric
admission followed by regular outpatient appointments plus 24-
hour access to a treatment service versus TAU (Van der Sande
1997a). There was no difference between the two groups in repe-
tition of SH, depression, or hopelessness, although more patients
in the experimental groups attended at least one outpatient ap-
pointment.
General hospital admission
In a single trial, there was no beneficial effect of general hospital
admission on repetition of SH or on hopelessness compared with
discharge from hospital (Waterhouse 1990). However, as this trial
was limited to low-risk participants, only around 15% of the pre-
senting patients were included.
Intensive outpatient intervention
Two trials compared a combination of intensive therapies, includ-
ing psychotherapy, behaviour therapy and family therapy, versus
standard outpatient care (Allard 1992; Welu 1977). There was no
effect of this treatment package on repetition of SH.
Long-term psychotherapy
In a single trial that compared long-term therapy (the nature of
which was unspecified) versus short-term intensive therapy, there
was no difference in repetition of SH (Torhorst 1988). Estimates
of scores from graphs also suggests little difference in depression
scores.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Completeness of evidence
There have now been a considerable number of trials of psychoso-
cial interventions for adult SH patients (we identified 55 indepen-
dent trials). There have been multiple trials of CBT-based psy-
chotherapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, case management, and
postcards. Investigators have also evaluated a wide range of other
types of interventions, including attempts to increase adherence
with treatment and specific aftercare interventions; however, many
of these evaluations have been limited to single trials.
It is important to note that we identified no trials of psychosocial
interventions for older (> 60/65 years) adults.
Most trials evaluated a range of relevant primary and secondary
outcomes (e.g., repetition of SH, hopelessness, depression). How-
ever, they infrequently reported information on suicide, and we
had to request it from many authors. In 11 trials, information
on repetition of SH was based only on hospital re-presentations,
whereas in a large number of trials this information came from
self-reported data, which in some cases was supplemented by in-
formation from clinical and other sources. More episodes of SH
will be identified through self-report compared with information
from clinical records, as much SH occurs in the community and
does not result in presentation to clinical services (Borges 2011).
However, these differences in the recording of SH would not have
affected the overall results, as whatever approach was used in the
individual trials would have affected the experimental and con-
trol arms equally. Also, some trials only assessed repetition during
the period in which participants received therapy (e.g., Bateman
2009), whereas for most trials there were further post-treatment
follow-up assessments.
Acceptability of evidence
The proportions of participants from the two sexes in these
trials appears to be in accord with SH patients more gener-
ally (Hawton 2007). A number of trials focused on those with
a history of multiple episodes of SH, including patients diag-
nosed with borderline personality disorder; this focus is welcome
given that a history of multiple episodes of SH is associated
with a particularly high risk of subsequent suicide (Zahl 2004).
A number of trials did not record information on suicidal in-
tent of participants (e.g., Carter 2005; Crawford 2010; Dubois
1999; Evans 1999a; Evans 1999b; Gibbons 1978; Gratz 2006;
Hassanian-Moghaddam 2011; Linehan 1991; McLeavey 1994;
Morgan 1993; Priebe 2012; Weinberg 2006), which is surprising
given the association of SH with future risk of suicide (Carroll
2014; Owens 2002).
Compared to previous versions of this review (Hawton 1998;
Hawton 1999; NICE 2011), there is now a greater representation
of trials from low- to middle-income countries, including China
(Wei2013; Xu2012), India(Vijayakumar 2011), Iran(Hassanian-
Moghaddam 2011; Hassanzadeh 2010), Pakistan (Husain 2014),
and Sri Lanka (Marasinghe 2012).
It is worth noting that this review focused exclusively on patients
who had previously engaged in SH. As a result, we excluded pa-
86

 tients with conditions such as borderline personality disorder who
had not engaged in SH and mixed trials of patients with either SH
or suicidal ideation in the absence of actual SH.
Quality of the evidence
Apart from trials of CBT-based psychotherapy (18 trials), group-
based emotion-regulation psychotherapy (two trials), dialectical
behaviour therapy (three trials in which DBT was compared with
TAU), case management (four trials) and postcards (four trials),
all the included trials compared specific interventions, thus limit-
ing the robustness of possible conclusions about their effectiveness
compared with routine care (TAU). Also, many trials were too
small to detect significant differences in proportions of patients
experiencing the primary outcome, namely repetition of SH. Ad-
ditionally, quality of evidence, as assessed using the GRADE ap-
proach, was generally low to moderate, suggesting that further re-
search is likely to have an important impact on our confidence
in the estimate of treatment effectiveness and may, in some cases,
change the estimates.
Limitations in design and implementation
All 55 included trials were rated as at high risk of bias in rela-
tion to at least one aspect of trial design, especially with respect to
blinding of both participants and clinical personnel. In part this
may reflect the fact that the focus of the present review was on
the effectiveness of psychological interventions, and we believe it
is generally not possible to blind participants or clinical personnel
to psychological therapy. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out perfor-
mance or detection bias.
Indirectness of evidence
Repetition of SH was measured using either self-reported informa-
tion, medical records, or re-presentation to hospital in all 55 trials
included in this review. It is possible that self-reported information
might over- or underestimate the real recurrence of SH. On the
other hand, use of medical records, hospital presentations, or both
may underestimate the real recurrence of SH, as many episodes
of SH occur in the community and do not result in presentation
to clinical services (Borges 2011). However, these differences in
the recording of SH would not have affected the overall results,
as whatever approach was used in the individual trials would have
affected the experimental and control arms equally.
Trials assessed secondary outcomes using widely validated psycho-
metric measures (e.g., BDI, BHS), which authors did not typically
modify in scoring.
Unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results
One meta-analysis included in the review, effectiveness of CBT-
based psychotherapy on depression scores at 12 months, was asso-
ciated with substantial levels of heterogeneity (I2 = 76%). Exclud-
ing Hatcher 2011, which used Zelen’s method of randomisation,
did not materially affect heterogeneity.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses where visual inspection of
the forest plot indicated that one or more trials may have been
outliers. For this reason, we excluded the postcard trial by Kapur
2013a from meta-analyses for repetition of SH both at post-inter-
vention and at 12-month follow-up. In both cases, exclusion of
this trial caused the overall estimate of treatment effectiveness for
postcard-based interventions to obtain significance. This could be
due to the fact that Kapur 2013a was a small pilot investigation.
We also undertook sensitivity analyses where one or more trials
included adolescent participants. Excluding trials for this reason,
however, did not appear to systematically explain heterogeneity.
Imprecision of results
Results of the individual trials included in this review were asso-
ciated with a high level of imprecision as indicated by the wide
confidence intervals around the effect size estimates for many of
the outcomes reported in this review.
Probability of publication bias
We could only formally evaluate the presence of publication bias
for CBT-based psychotherapy with respect to repetition of SH at
six months (Figure 4), 12 months (Figure 5), and final follow-
up (Figure 6), and for depression scores at final follow-up (Figure
7). In all four cases, some funnel plot asymmetry was evident
and particularly seemed to affect the right side of the plot. It
is therefore possible that there are unpublished trials in which
experimental treatment was ineffective. However, it should also be
noted that funnel plot asymmetry could also be due to high levels
of heterogeneity.

For one trial of provision of information and support, investiga-
tors have not published data from two of the seven study sites
(Fleischmann 2008; Bertolote 2010). Therefore we cannot rule
out publication bias for this intervention. We are also aware of one
further unpublished trial of CBT-based psychotherapy for which
we were unable to obtain the results from the authors. All other
trials included in this review have been published in full in peer-
reviewed journals. We therefore believe that publication bias is
unlikely to have been a major cause of heterogeneity. Instead, we
believe either poor methodological design or true heterogeneity
between trials may be responsible for this result (Sterne 2011).
Potential biases in the review process
We have no reason to believe we have not identified all relevant
published trials of psychosocial interventions for SH in adults.
Nevertheless, by using the random-effects model in all analyses our
results possess greater generalisability than if we had used the fixed-
effect model (Erez 1996). However, because our review criteria
included trials in people who had all engaged in SH and presented
to clinical services in the preceding six months, we excluded trials
where only some of the participants had engaged in SH and also
trials where SH was an outcome measured in general psychoso-
cial interventions for patients with psychiatric disorders. Data on
repetition of SH were available for all but one of the included
trials (Patsiokas 1985). Information on suicides was available for
43 (78.2%) of the trials included in this review, although for most
trials this information had to be obtained via correspondence with
authors.
Owing to uncertainties about the impact of using Zelen’s design,
for trials using this approach we analysed data for the primary
outcome of repetition of SH using data for both the randomised
sample (including both those patients who, following treatment
allocation, subsequently consented to participation and those who
did not) and the consenting sample only (see Unit of analysis issues
section). This typically had little impact on the pattern of results
observed.
Due to the large number and varied nature of the interventions in-
cludedinthe earlierversionsof thisreview(Hawton1998; Hawton
1999) we decided, with agreement of the editors, to divide the re-
view into three (the others reviews being of pharmacological inter-
91

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 ventions in adults (Hawton 2015b) and both pharmacological and
psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents (Hawton
2015a)). Because of the fact that we approached this review with
a view to identifying the types of psychosocial interventions that
had been evaluated to date in this clinical population, we used a
consensus approach to grouping the interventions. This process
might have been subject to bias, but in general, there was very
good agreement between members of the review group, who have
considerable experience in research and clinical practice in relation
to SH in adults.
Risk of bias for selective outcome reporting was based on the
analyses undertaken by the study authors. As we were unable to
include data that had been statistically adjusted for missingness in
the present review, we believe it would be unfair to rate trials that
made use of statistical adjustments to account for missing data
at follow-up as having high risk of bias for this outcome simply
because of our choice of outcome.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
There have been several reviews of the efficacy of psychosocial in-
terventions for adult SH patients. None of those that used system-
atic review methodology to identify all relevant treatment inter-
ventions also present meta-analyses of treatment efficacy (Comtois
2006; Crawford 2007a; Daigle 2011; Hepp 2004; Van der Sande
1997b), aside from Inagaki 2015 and NICE 2011; however, this
latter review was conducted using data supplied by our review team
during a previous update of the present review. Of two further
meta-analyses, one specifically focused on cognitive behavioural
interventions (Tarrier 2008b) and one examined remote contact-
based interventions (Milner 2015).
Inagaki 2015 combined trials of case management, treatment
adherence enhancement, and remote contact interventions into
one category which the authors termed “active contact and fol-
low-up” interventions. They concluded that these interventions
show promise in reducing repetition at 12 months’ follow-up but
not at 24 months’ follow-up. Combining trials of such different
treatment approaches, however, is potentially misleading given
their very different mechanisms of action. Crawford 2007a also
combined different treatment approaches (e.g., CBT-based psy-
chotherapy, DBT, and adherence enhancement), as well as inter-
ventions specifically developed for children and adolescents (e.g.,
Spirito 2002; Wood 2001). The authors concluded there was no
evidence of a preventive effect of psychosocial interventions for the
prevention of suicide. However, they only assessed efficacy with
respect to completed suicide, which few trials are adequately pow-
ered to evaluate. Repetition of SH, on the other hand, is a much
more common outcome for which a greater number of trials are
powered to evaluate.
There is general agreement amongst these reviews concerning the
efficacy of CBT-based psychotherapy. Comtois 2006, for example,
concluded there were positive effects for psychotherapy and out-
reach interventions. However, conclusions concerning the latter
type of intervention in this review were particularly influenced by
the findings of a single trial in which regular letters were mailed to
suicidal patients discharged from psychiatric inpatient care (Motto
2001). As not all participants included in this trial had engaged
in SH behaviour, this trial did not meet inclusion criteria for the
present review. Tarrier 2008b, moreover, concluded there was evi-
dence for the effectiveness of CBT-based psychotherapy but only
when compared against TAU rather than another form of active
psychosocial therapy. Benefits of psychological therapy have re-
cently been reported by findings of a national, non-randomised
naturalistic study in Denmark (Erlangsen 2015).
A recent meta-analysis of contact-based interventions found no
significant reduction in terms of repetition of SH (both proportion
andnumberof episodesperperson)forthese interventions(Milner
2015). Surprisingly, however, the review pooled together several
different types of contact-based intervention, including letters,
emergency cards, and postcards. Additionally, despite the stated
focus of the review being on interventions following SH, it also
included trials in which not all participants had engaged in SH
prior to inclusion (e.g., Motto 2001; Robinson 2012). Also, for
one of the trials included in this review, our correspondence with
the original trial authors revealed that data on non-fatal repetition
of SH could not be disaggregated from information on completed
suicide (e.g., Chen 2013).
Other reviews have focused specifically on interventions for pa-
tients with personality disorder, particularly borderline personality
disorder (McMain 2007b; Kliem 2010). They, along with the re-
view by Comtois 2006, concluded that dialectical behaviour ther-
apy was effective for the prevention of SH, although these reviews
included some trials in which not all participants had engaged
in SH prior to trial entry. Further reviews by Luxton 2013 and
Kapur 2010 of postcard, telephone, emergency card, and face-to-
face interventions concluded they may be effective in preventing
suicidal behaviour, although again, these reviews included some
trials in which not all participants had engaged in SH at trial entry.
The inclusion of these participants means that the focus of the
intervention in such trials, and hence the specificity of the findings
for SH patients and planning of clinical services for these patients,
will be unclear.

Implications for practice
Evidence drawn from an earlier version of this review has been in-
corporated in guidance for commissioners of clinical services in the
United Kingdom, which states that brief CBT-based psychother-
apy should be available in self-harm services (NICE 2011). Our
92

 updated findings would reinforce the view that there is some evi-
dence to suggest that CBT-based psychotherapy is effective in re-
ducing repetition of SH compared with treatment as usual (TAU).
There is a lack of evidence with respect to the prevention of sui-
cide, however, although there was a relatively small number of
such events in these trials, precluding a firm conclusion.
In most trials CBT-based psychotherapy was typically very brief
(i.e., less than 10 sessions). It was delivered on an individual basis
in all trials except one (i.e., McAuliffe 2014).
While dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) did not reduce the
proportion of participants with borderline personality disorder
who engaged in a repeated episode of SH as compared with TAU,
it did appear to reduce the frequency of repetition. Arguably, where
patients are multiple repeaters of SH and much of their SH will
have included acts such as superficial self-cutting, reduction in the
frequency of SH could be viewed as a key outcome.
Less intensive remote contact-based interventions, such as sending
regularpostcardstopatientsinthe yearfollowinganepisode of SH,
did not appear to reduce the proportion of patients repeating SH.
However, these interventions may hold promise in settings where
there are very limited psychiatric services (where the alternative
may be no provision of little or no aftercare). Case management
approaches also did not appear to be effective in reducing the
proportion of patients who repeat SH.
Otherinterventionshave mostlybeenevaluatedinsingle trials. Ina
trial of DBT-oriented therapy, for example, there was a significant
reduction in both the number of patients repeating SH and the
total number of repeat episodes, as well as significant reductions in
depression and suicidal ideation. Mentalisation therapy was asso-
ciated with reduced repetition of SH and depression in the latter
stages of follow-up in patients with borderline personality disor-
der. Group-based emotion-regulation psychotherapy was associ-
ated with a reduction in the proportion of patients repeating SH
in the final two months of the treatment period, but there was no
apparent effect on depression. Provision of information and sup-
port was associated with reduced numbers of completed suicides
in a single multicentre trial conducted in five low- and middle-
income countries, but not with reduced repetition of SH. There is,
however, some inconsistency in the reporting of numbers of sui-
cides in the experimental group for the overall cohort as reported
in Fleischmann 2008 and those from three of the five individual
study sites (in Karaj, Iran (Hassanzadeh 2010); Chennai, India
(Vijayakumar 2011); and Yuncheng, China (Xu 2012)). Home-
based problem-solving psychotherapy and continuity of treatment
by the same therapist from assessment to aftercare appeared to
improve treatment adherence, but without clear benefit in terms
of repetition of SH.
Where possible, we analysed results separately by sex. Whilst one
trial indicated reduced benefit for the intervention on depression
in females as compared to males (Marasinghe 2012), in the few
trials where a subgroup analysis by sex was possible, the majority
suggested a significant treatment effect of psychosocial interven-
tions for females but not males.
In terms of repeater status, it appears that some more limited inter-
ventions (emergency cards) may have negative effects in patients
with a history of multiple episodes of SH. However, trials of some
more intensive interventions (e.g., group-based emotion-regula-
tion psychotherapy, mentalisation, DBT) appear to have positive
benefits on repetition of SH, and particularly for participants who
were multiple repeaters of SH at trial entry, which would mostly
have included participants diagnosed with borderline personality
disorder.
Implications for research
Given the apparent positive benefits of CBT-based psychother-
apy and some other treatment approaches, future trials should
identify which types of patients are most likely to benefit from
these interventions. Although we were only able to undertake sub-
group analyses by sex in five trials (Bennewith 2002; Carter 2005;
Fleischmann 2008; Hvid 2011; Marasinghe 2012), evidence from
the present review would suggest that some psychosocial inter-
ventions, particularly remote contact-based interventions and case
management, tend to be of greater benefit for female patients.
There should therefore be a greater focus on sex-specific interven-
tions, especially to identify treatments most likely to benefit male
SH patients.
We could only undertake subgroup analyses by repeater status (i.e.,
with or without a history of multiple episodes of SH) in five trials
(Bennewith 2002; Evans 1999a; Hatcher 2011; Hatcher 2016a;
Hatcher 2015). Nevertheless, there is limited evidence that whilst
some forms of psychosocial interventions may be more effective in
those with a history of multiple episodes of SH (e.g., CBT-based
psychotherapy) other forms of contact-based interventions, such
as emergency cards, may lead to an increased risk of repetition of
SH in those with a history of multiple episodes of SH prior to
trial entry. For these reasons, history of prior SH should be clearly
identified in future trials, with stratified randomisation according
to repeater status being desirable.
Researchers investigating psychosocial treatments should endeav-
ourtoinvestigate whetherthe interventionresultsin changes in the
psychological orsocial mechanismsthatare the targetsof treatment
(e.g., problem-solving, emotion-regulation, interpersonal skills)
and the extent to which such changes relate to positive outcomes
(Arensman 2001). Such knowledge will help clarify the mediators
of treatment efficacy and allow therapists to modify interventions
so that they may be more effective.
In view of the apparent effectiveness of CBT-based psychother-
apy in reducing repetition of SH and the development of online
therapy for a range of psychological problems (Andersson 2014;
Griffiths 2006), and the introduction online means of provid-

 ing this therapy should be a priority, particularly given the find-
ings of some short-term benefits of online self-help for suicidal
thoughts (Van Spijker 2014) and behaviours (Franklin 2016), al-
though these effects may not be maintained at longer-term follow-
ups. The longer term effectiveness of these interventions is there-
fore yet to be determined.

Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Unclear risk
Quote: “Subjects were randomly assigned
either to the intensive intervention group
or to the comparison group, using sealed
and numbered envelopes” (p. 306)
Comment: No mention of how the se-
quence was generated or how envelopes
were numbered. It is therefore unclear if the
allocation sequence was adequately gener-
ated
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Quote: “Subjects were randomly assigned
either to the intensive intervention group
or to the comparison group, using sealed
and numbered envelopes” (p. 306)
Comment: No mention of whether the en-
velopes were opaque or not, although they
probably were
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
Of participants
High risk
Quote: “If in the experimental group, sub-
jects . . . were put under the care of the
project team (two staff psychiatrists and a
social worker); if in the comparison group,
they were treated by other personnel” (p.
306)
Comment: It is not known whether the par-
ticipantswere aware theywere beingtreated
by a different team or not, although the na-
ture of the intervention means it is likely
participants were aware of which treatment
group they had been assigned to
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
Of personnel
High risk
Quote: “If in the experimental group, sub-
jects . . . were put under the care of the
project team (two staff psychiatrists and a
social worker); if in the comparison group,
they were treated by other personnel” (p.
306)
Comment: Personnel would have been
aware of which teamtheyhadbeenassigned
to
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
Of outcome assessors
High risk
Quote: “For most of the study, patients in
the experimental group were interviewed at
12 months by their psychiatrist (instead of
the research assistant)” (p. 307)
Comment: If personnel were also acting

(Continued)
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Quote: “All comparisons between groups
were made on an intention-to-treat basis”
(p. 307)
Comment: Within the section on ’Losses to
follow-up’, the authors state that follow-
up information was not available for 24
participants. No reasons for dropouts were
provided in this section. The authors do,
however, assert these losses were unlikely to
introduce bias and “unlikely to affect the
comparisons between the two groups” (pp.
308-309) as dropouts (who shared a simi-
lar demographic profile) were “equally dis-
tributed between groups”
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Unclear risk
Comment: no reason to suspect that all out-
comes were not reported; however, in the
absence of the trial protocol this cannot be
ascertained
Other bias
Low risk
Comment: no other apparent sources of bias

Methods
Allocation: offsite random assignment made using a stochastic minimisation programme
(MINIM) balanced for age (18-25, 26-30, and > 30 years), sex, and diagnosis of antisocial
personality disorder
Follow-up period: 6, 12, and 18 months
N lost to follow-up: 8/134 (6.0%) at the 18-month follow-up period

Inclusion criteria: i) diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; ii) made a suicide
attempt or an episode of SH within 6 months prior to randomisation; iii) aged 18-65
years
Exclusion criteria: i) currently in long-term psychotherapeutic treatment; ii) met DSM-
IV criteria for any psychosis or bipolar I disorder; iii) dependent on any opiate to such
a degree that specialist treatment was required; iv) presence of a mental impairment or
evidence of an organic brain disorder
Numbers: Of the 134 participants, 71 were allocated to the experimental arm and 63 to
the control arm
Profile: 80% (n = 107) were female,100% (n = 134) were multiple repeaters, 56% (n =

Methods
Allocation: randomisation using a random numbers table and delivered using prepared,
sealed, opaque envelopes
Follow-up period: 6 months
N lost to follow-up: 0/103 (0%) for repetition of SH; 65/103 (63.1%) for secondary out-
comes not included in this review (e.g., alcohol consumption, mental health problems,
and satisfaction with treatment)

formed consent (e.g., due to an inability to communicate in English or impaired con-
sciousness); iii) no fixed address in the greater London area; iv) already receiving treat-
ment from alcohol misuse services; v) made a specific request to receive treatment from
alcohol misuse services at index presentation
Numbers: Of the 103 participants, 51 were allocated to the experimental arm and 52
were allocated to the control arm

ment and discussion of both current and previous drinking behaviours delivered accord-
ing to the FRAMES approach in addition to a health information leaflet advising on the
damaging effects of excessive alcohol consumption, recommended limits of alcohol con-
sumption, and the contact details of nationally-based alcohol misuse help lines (Miller
1993). Participants could also be referred by the alcohol nurse specialist to individual
alcohol counselling or detoxification services as required

Comment: This was a very small trial with
substantial imbalances between interven-
tion and control groups with respect to lev-
els of non-suicidal self-harm, anxiety, and
depression at baseline. Follow-up analyses
did not adjust for these baseline imbal-
ances. This is likely to result in exaggerated
treatment effects as, in all cases, the control
group had higher levels of self-harm, anxi-
ety, and depression

Methods
Allocation: randomisation based on Zelen’s method using a centrally-generated randomi-
sation sequence. A stratified minimisation procedure was also used to ensure balance in
key prognostic factors (i.e., history of SH and method of SH) between the 3 sites
Follow-up period: 12 months for primary outcome (i.e., hospital recorded repetition of
SH) and 3 and 12 months for secondary outcomes (i.e., self reported repetition of SH,
depression, and hopelessness)
N lost to follow-up: 0/365 (0%) for hospital re-presentations for SH.
Participants
Inclusion criteria: i) presented to the emergency department at 1 of the 3 participating
hospitals following an episode of SH; ii) self identified as M ori; iii) able to communicate
effectively in Te Reo Maori (M ori language)
Exclusion criteria: i) aged less than 17 years; ii) still enrolled full-time in school; iii) unable
to provide informed consent
Numbers: Of the 167 participants who provided informed consent, 95 were allocated to
the experimental arm and 72 were allocated to the control arm
Profile: Of those who consented to participation 65.3% (n = 109) were female, 59.9%
(n = 100) were multiple repeaters

telephone patient support sessions over the 2 week period following discharge from
hospital to ensure patients were adhering to their agreed discharge plan, improved access
to primary care via the provision of a voucher that could be used to access 1 free GP
consultation, development of a risk management strategy, and a cultural assessment
focused on identifying patients’ sense of belonging and identification with M ori culture
Control: TAU involving referral to multi-disciplinary teams for psychiatric/psychological
assessment, intervention, or both; referral to crisis teams; or referral to community-based
drug or alcohol treatment teams as necessary
Therapist: research clinicians (no further details on qualifications or experience were
provided), mental health crisis and community mental health clinicians (no further

Source of participants: admissions to emergency departments following a suicide attempt
Location: various locations around Japan
Interventions
Experimental: assertive outreach and case management involving contact with patients
at week 1 and 1, 2, 3 , 6, 12, and 18 months after the index suicide attempt with a view

could interfere with treatment adherence, providing encouragement to remain adherent
with treatment, coordination and referral to appointments with psychiatrists and any
other primary care physicians, outreach for those who had dropped out of treatment,
referral to social services and other support organisations as needed, psycho-education,
and access to a dedicated website designed to provide participants with information and
resources
Control: enhanced usual care. No further details on treatment content provided
Therapist: mixture of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, and clinical psychologists
Type of therapy offered: assertive outreach
Length of treatment: 18 months
Outcomes
Included: i) repetition of SH; ii) suicide
Excluded: none

lifetime suicide attempts or non-suicidal self injuries combined; ii) number of psychi-
atric hospitalisations; iii) history of only suicide attempts, only non-suicidal self-injury,
or both; iv) age; v) Beck Depression Inventory score > 30 or a Global Assessment of
Functioning score < 45 for any comorbid condition
Follow-up period: 24 months
N lost to follow-up: 0/101 (0%) for repetition data
Participants
Inclusion criteria: i) 18-45 years; ii) female; iii) met criteria for borderline personality
disorder; iv) at least 2 suicide attempts or episodes of SH in the past 5 years, with at least
1 in the past 8 weeks

disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, or mental retardation; ii) seizure
disorder requiring medication; iii) mandate to treatment; iv) requiring primary treatment
for another debilitating condition
Numbers: Of the 101 participants 52 were allocated to the experimental arm and 49 to
the control arm
Profile: 101 (100%) were female, 97 (96%) had a lifetime diagnosis of a depressive disor-
der, 73 (72.3%) were diagnosed with major depression, and 30 (29.7%) had substance
abuse
Source of participants: clinical referrals and individuals attending inpatient units, emer-
gency rooms and outpatient clinics
Setting: Seattle, WA, USA
Interventions
Experimental: dialectical behavior therapy involving cognitive behavioural treatment de-
veloped specifically for the treatment of for suicidal patients with borderline personal-

motivation for treatment whilst also reinforcing functional behaviour. The manualised
treatment consisted of 1 h weekly individual psychotherapy, 2.5 h weekly group skills
training, telephone consultation as required (within each therapists’ limitations), and
weekly therapist team meetings
Control: community treatment by experts specifically designed for the trial to control for
factors previously uncontrolled in DBT trials. Whilst similar to TAU, as therapists were
free to decide on type and dose of therapy they believed was most suited to the patient
(minimum of 1 scheduled individual session per week), the characteristics of therapists
were controlled via selection of therapists and supervisory arrangements

; ii) admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt; iii) able to provide written informed
consent; iv) consent to randomised assignment
Exclusion criteria: i) diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar dis-

Numbers: Of the 24 participants, 12 were allocated to the intervention arm and 12 were
allocated to the control arm
Profile: 79.2% (n = 19) were female, 95.8% (n = 23) met criteria for a comorbid Axis
I disorder, including: dysthymia with a comorbid generalised anxiety disorder (n = 17)
, major depression (n = 3), and dysthymia (n = 3). 95.8% (n = 23) met criteria for a

personality disorder (n = 6), narcissistic personality disorder (n = 6), schizotypal per-
sonality disorder (n = 3), antisocial personality disorder (n = 2), paranoid personality
disorder (n = 2), and compulsive personality disorder (n = 1). 75.0% (n = 18) had alcohol
misuse, 83.3% (n = 20) had substance misuse
Source of participants: patients admitted to hospital following a suicide attempt
Location: Philadelphia, PA, USA
Interventions
Experimental: dialectical behaviour therapy involving elements of Linehan’s manualised
DBT protocol (see Linehan 1993a) but modified to include: i) psychodynamic tech-
niques to conceptualise patients’ behavioural, emotional, and relationship schema. Addi-
tionally, no group skills training sessions were provided. Instead, skills training occurred
during individual therapy. The 6 sessions intended to be used as group skills training
sessions were instead used for interpersonal skills training focusing on the identification
of significant persons in the participants’ environment, including problems in relation-
ships, with family, etc
Control: client-centred therapy based on Carkhuff’s model involving emphatic under-
standing of the patients’ sense of aloneness and the provision of a supportive atmosphere
to enable individuation (Carkhuff 1969; Carkhoff 1976). Carkhuff’s manual provides
directions for increasing the therapeutic relationship through emphatic and supportive
elements. The primary focus of treatment was to provide support to enable participants
to deal with everyday stress and prevent relapse. Participants also received 6 sessions of
interpersonal skills training focusing on the identification of significant persons in the
participants’ environment, including problems in relationships, with family, etc. Treat-
ment also included the creation and signing of a contract by the therapist and patient
stipulating that the patient would not engage in SH or make a suicide attempt during
the 12-month treatment period
Therapist: 4 therapists with an average of 22 years’ clinical experience in family systems,
client-centred, and psychodynamic treatment therapies. All therapists also received 12
sessions of training in dialectical behaviour therapy delivered over a 3-month period
prior to randomisation
Type of therapy offered: dialectical behavioural therapy
Length of treatment: 12 months

behind the current suicide attempt; ii) discuss these reasons with family, partner, or both
if required; iii) contact the unit on discharge in the case of a suicidal crisis; iv) change
their ability to cope with future problems. 24-hour emergency access to unit was offered
throughout the duration of outpatient treatment
Control: TAU. For around 25% (n = 34) this involved admission to an inpatient unit,
whilst for the remaining 75% (n = 100), this involved referral to outpatient services
Therapists: 1 psychiatrist, 2 community psychiatric nurses, and 9 psychiatric nurses
Type of therapy offered: problem-solving therapy
Length of treatment: not specified

All participants were initially presented with a brief statement designed to encourage them to plan not to self-harm:
‘We want you to plan not to self-harm. Research shows that you are much more likely to be successful in your intention not
to self-harm if you can identify critical situations and appropriate responses’.
Following this statement, participants were randomised to one of three groups:
(i) volitional help sheet with implementation intentions (11 critical situations and 11 appropriate responses) (N=75)
;
(ii) self-generating implementation intentions, without help (N=78);
(iii) a control condition (the volitional help sheet, but no instruction on how to form implementation intentions,
participants were simply asked to identify critical situations and appropriate responses that might be useful to them)
(N=73)
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: suicidal ideation and behaviour (revised Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire); depression (BDI-II)
; motivation to avoid self-harm

Gysin-Maillart 2016
Methods
Allocation: individual randomisation using shuffled sealed envelopes.
Design: single centre (hospital-based recruitment).
Setting: emergency unit of a university general hospital.
Location: Bern, Switzerland.
Participants
Males and females, 18 years of age and older, admitted to the emergency unit of a university general hospital following
a suicide attempt for which there is evidence of an intent to die. Those with a history of multiple episodes of self-
harm (i.e., indicative of probable borderline personality disorder pathology), serious cognitive impairment, psychosis,
insufficient ability to communicate in German, or those resident outside of the hospital catchment area will be
excluded from participation
Interventions
Individuals randomised to the intervention group will receive between three and four weekly sessions of between 60-
90 minutes in length of face-to-face psychosocial therapy delivered according to the ASSIP manual (Gysin-Maillart
2013; Michel 2015) involving a narrative interview, cognitive restructuring, and crisis safety planning. Additionally,
participants in the intervention group will receive one letter every three months for a total of 24 months reminding
them of the importance of safety planning during times of crisis

Outcomes
Primary outcomes: suicide reattempts according to hospital records during the 24 month follow-up period
Secondary outcomes: scores on the 11-item Penn Helping Alliance Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and
the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation during the 24 month follow-up period
Notes
Linehan 2015
Methods
Allocation: randomisation using a computerised adaptive minimisation procedure whereby participants were matched
using 5 primary prognostic variables: i) age; ii) number of prior ’suicide attempts’; iii) number of prior NSSI episodes;
iv) number of psychiatric hospitalisations within the past year; v) depression severity
Follow-up period: 12 months
N lost to follow-up: 0/99 (0%) for repetition of NSSI and ’suicide attempts’
Participants
Inclusion criteria: i) 18-60 years; ii) female; iii) met criteria for borderline personality disorder; iv) at least 2 ’suicide
attempts’ or episodes of NSSI over the past 5 years; v) at least 1 ’suicide attempt’ or episode of NSSI within the 8
weeks prior to entering the study; vi) at least 1 ’suicide attempt’ in the previous year. Due to difficulties in reaching
recruitment targets, the authors relaxed inclusion criteria towards the end of the recruitment period to include 1
participant who had engaged in an episode of NSSI in the 8-week period prior to entering the study but who did
not have a prior history of NSSI and 5 participants who did not have a history of repeated episodes of NSSI but who
did make a ’suicide attempt’ within the past year
Exclusion criteria: i) met criteria for a current psychotic or bipolar disorder; ii) diagnosed with a seizure disorder
requiring the use of medication; iii) currently undergoing treatment for another life-threatening condition (e.g.,
anorexia nervosa); iv) an IQ score of less than 70 on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised
Numbers: of the 99 participants 33 were allocated to the DBT + skills training arm, 33 were allocated to the DBT +
individual therapy arm, and 33 were allocated to the DBT standard protocol arm
Profile: 99 (100%) were female, 95 (95.9%) had a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, 87 (87.9%) had a lifetime
diagnosis of any anxiety disorder, and 69 (69.7%) had a lifetime diagnosis of a substance use disorder
Source of participants: healthcare practitioners
Setting: Seattle, WA, USA
Interventions
Experimental: This trial involved 2 experimental arms. The first, ’DBT + skills training’, incorporated a manualised
standard case management protocol, group-based skills training sessions, and telephone coaching as required; it was
designed to resemble the DBT standard protocol with the omission of all sessions of individual-based psychotherapy.
The second, ’DBT + individual therapy’, incorporated individual-based therapy, an activity-based support group,
and telephone coaching as required; it was designed to resemble the DBT standard protocol with the omission of all
sessions of group-based skills training
Control: DBT standard protocol incorporating sessions of individual-based psychotherapy, group-based skills training,
and telephone coaching as required
Therapists: specially trained to provide either experimental or control therapy
Type of therapy offered: dialectical behaviour therapy with skills training and dialectical behaviour therapy with
individual-based psychotherapy
Length of treatment: 1 year
Outcomes
To be included: i) repetition of SH (requires correspondence from study authors as to whether it is possible to aggregate
episodes of NSSI and ’suicide reattempts’); ii) depression; iii) suicidal ideation; iv) adherence with treatment
Excluded: i) anxiety; ii) importance of reasons for living

months post-baseline, individuals randomised to the experimental group will receive a similar “booster” help
sheet and a covering letter explaining that the Volitional Help Sheet can be completed again if required
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: repetition of self-harm necessitating hospital admission to any hospital in Scotland during
the 6-month follow-up period, number of re-presentations to hospital for self-harm during the 6-month
follow-up period, and cost-effectiveness of the Volitional Help Sheet, as measured by the estimated incremental
cost per episode of self-harm or suicide averted
Secondary outcomes: Time to re-presentation to any hospital in Scotland with self-harm during the 6-month
follow-up period measured in weeks, months, or both
Starting date
April, 2012.
Proposed End Date: April, 2015.

Notes
Prof Rory O’Connor very kindly provided unpublished information relating to this trial. Additionally, Prof
O’Connor provided the following to describe the theoretical basis, content, and purpose of the Volitional
Help Sheet: “The intervention takes the form of a help sheet (Armitage 2008), which is developed from
three well established theoretical perspectives and previous research: Gollwitzer’s concept of Implementation
Interventions (Gollwitzer 1993), Prochaska and DiClemente’s trans-theoretical model (Prochaska 1983),
Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model of suicidal behaviour (IMV; O’Connor 2011) and previous work on
self-harm (e.g., O’Connor 2006; O’Connor 2009; Hawton 2006). In essence, the help sheet is a behavioural
change technique which encourages participants to link critical situations in which they are tempted to self-
harm with alternative responses/solutions.”

Notes
We made 3 attempts to contact Dr Pham-Scottez to confirm these details; however, we received no response
and so were unable to confirm whether all participants either engaged in deliberate self-harm or made a
suicide attempt within 6 months prior to randomisation. We extracted information for this trial from the
ClinicalTrials.gov record

Women Offenders Repeat Self-Harm Intervention Pilot II.
Trial registration number: ISRCTN18761534.
Methods
Allocation: randomisation by minimisation
Design: multicentre (3 closed-category prisons)
Setting: closed-category prisons housing a mixture of remand and sentenced prisoners
Follow-up period: 3 and 6 months
Location: Cheshire, Derby, and Yorkshire, UK
Participants
Inclusion criteria: female prisoners, 18 years or older, remanded or sentenced to any 1 of 3 prisons for any
offence, who have a history of repeated self-harming behaviour with at least 1 incident within the month
prior to randomisation, and are currently on an Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT). As

Interventions
Participantsrandomisedtothe experimental groupwill receive weeklysessionsof psychodynamicinterpersonal
therapy for a minimum of 6 weeks. Those randomised to the control group will receive active control
comprising a weekly session of time out of their cell to play card games, read magazines, listen to music,
or to discuss practical topics (e.g., developing financial management skills) with research assistants. Women
randomised to this group are specifically instructed that they cannot discuss emotive topics with research
assistants

a All diagnoses represent current rather than lifetime diagnoses.
b As participants could be diagnosed with more than one axis II diagnosis, the absolute number of participants diagnosed with any
other personality disorder in this trial is unclear.
c Median number (interquartile range) of psychiatric diagnoses in the both the intervention and control groups was 2 (1-3). Information
on specific categories of psychiatric diagnosis; however, were not reported.
d A total of 47/216 (21.7%) of the sample were diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder other than a mood or adjustment disorder.

 e Diagnosed with a possible psychiatric disorder according to cut-off scores on the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Out of a total of 176 participants with complete ratings on this instrument.
f Diagnosed with problematic alcohol use according to cut-off scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Out
of a total of 63 participants with complete ratings on this instrument.
g An additional 73/914 (8.0%) were diagnosed with any other major psychiatric disorder.
h The authors state that “[m]ost patients would have been given personality disorder designations . . . including histrionic, narcissistic,
borderline, avoidant, and dependent types” (p.1127). The absolute number of participants diagnosed with any one of these personality
disorders in this trial is, however, unclear.
i A total of 14/243 (5.8%) participants had been admitted to a psychiatric inpatient ward in the four weeks prior to the index suicide
attempt. These patients were therefore likely to have been diagnosed with a current major psychiatric illness.
j Mean (standard deviation (SD)) number of axis I psychiatric disorders was 8.0 (3.1) (n = 63) and mean (SD) number of axis II
diagnoses was 3.5 (1.6) (n = 80).
k A total of 100/459 (21.8%) of participants had, however, been referred for psychiatric treatment at the time of the index suicide
attempt. These patients were therefore likely to have been diagnosed with a current major psychiatric illness.
l A total of 166/239 (69.4%) were, however, diagnosed with a major psychiatric illness according to DSM-IV-TR criteria.

In the original version of this review, Sarah Stockton, Librarian at the University of Oxford, conducted the systematic search for trials.
Two out of TTS, EA, ET, and KH then independently screened the titles of identified trials for relevancy. A distinction was made
between:
1. eligible studies, in which any psychological and/or psychopharmacological treatment was compared with a control (e.g., standard or
less intensive types of aftercare or medication); and
2. general treatment studies, without any control treatment.
A second screening was then undertaken in which two of TTS, EA, ET, and KH independently screened the full text of relevant studies
with reference to the following inclusion criteria:
1. All participants must have engaged in SH (self-poisoning or self-injury) shortly prior to randomisation.
2. Studies must have reported the number of participants engaging in a repeat episode of SH as an outcome measure.
3. Study participants must have been randomised to the treatment and control groups.
Data extraction and management
Data extraction was carried out by EA and second member of the review group (TTS, ET, or KH) using a standardised data extraction
form. Members of the review team extracted data independently from one another. Disputes were resolved through consensus discussions
with a third member of the review group with assistance from the CCDAN editorial base.
We extracted data from each eligible trial concerning the characteristics of patients, the details of the interventions used, and information
on the number of participants engaging in a repeat episode of SH during the follow-up period. Where these details were unclear,
corresponding authors were contacted to provide additional clarification.
Assessment of risk of bias
For the original version of this review, three independent review authors (EA and ET plus another member of the review group) rated the
quality of the studies. Review authors were blind to authorship according to the recommended Cochrane criteria for quality assessment
(Sackett 1997).
Given that the quality of allocation concealment can affect the results of trials (Schulz 1995), studies were assigned a quality of
concealment rating ranging from C (poor quality) to A (high quality). Trials rated as inadequately concealed, for example via reference
to an open random number table, were given a rating of C. Trials that did not provide adequate details about how the randomisation
procedure was carried out were given a rating of B, and trials that were deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation,
for example through the use of serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; numbered or coded bottles or containers, were rated as
A quality. Where the concealment of allocation was not clearly reported (i.e., where trials were initially in category B), we contacted
corresponding authors for more information. Where raters disagreed as to the category to which a trial had been allocated, the final
rating was made by consensus discussion in consultation with TS, KH, and a third member of the review group.

 Measures of treatment effect
RevMan, version 3.0, was used to calculate summary odds ratios and accompanying 95% CIs for the number of participants engaging
in a repeat episode of SH during the follow-up period.
Unit of analysis issues
1. Cluster trials
Clustering was an issue in one included study (Bennewith 2002); however, as the authors reported adjusting for the effects of clustering
in their primary analyses, we reproduced the data from this study as if it came from a non-cluster randomised study.
2. Studies with multiple treatment groups
One included study presented data for multiple treatment groups (Hirsch 1982). As both treatment groups were prescribed antide-
pressants in this study, we combined the data from these two treatment arms.
Dealing with missing data
Where data on the primary outcome measure were incomplete or excluded from the study, corresponding author(s) were contacted
to obtain further information. Some authors used intention-to-treat analyses to account for missing data using a variety of different
methods which will be discussed within the ’Risk of bias’ tables. We as review authors did not attempt to impute data for those studies
in which intention-to-treat analyses had not been conducted, however. Instead, the effects of missing data will be discussed in the text
of the review.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Clinical heterogeneity was examined using the Chi2 statistic. Where this statistic was significant, we investigated potential causes of
heterogeneity as outlined in the ’Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity’ section below.
Assessment of reporting biases
To assess whether any meta-analysis reported in this review are affected by reporting bias, we planned to construct funnel plots to
investigate the likelihood that the results of our meta-analysis were affected by reporting bias. We were unable to undertake these
analyses, however, due to the very small number of trials included in our meta-analyses.
Data synthesis
The Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method was used to calculate pooled summary ORs and accompanying 95% CIs.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
In analyses resulting in significant heterogeneity, as indicated by the Chi2 statistic, an investigation into the source of this heterogeneity
was conducted. We had planned to conduct subgroup analyses by repeater status and sex; however, there were insufficient studies with
appropriate data to enable these analyses to be undertaken.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken where appropriate (e.g., in relation to risk of bias of included trials in the relative intensity of
treatment).

KH had the idea for the review. All authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias for included trials. Both TTS and KW conducted
the statistical analyses. KH, TTS, and KW wrote the initial version of the report and all authors contributed to the writing of drafts.
All authors also approved the final version of the review for publication.

In the original protocol for this review we planned to assess dichotomous outcome data (i.e., repetition of self-harm and suicide) using
the Peto odds ratio. Following revisions to iterations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2003)
and new statistical advice, however, we have instead used the Mantel Haenzel method in this update. For this version of the review
we have been able to add data for the previously stated outcomes of interest: depression, hopelessness, problem-solving, and suicidal
ideation. We have also used the I2 statistic, rather than the Chi2 test, to summarise between-study heterogeneity in this version in light
of revisions to Higgins 2003.
We also planned to assess methodological quality of included trials by the means recommended by the contemporary version of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2003). For this version of the review, we have therefore created
’Risk of bias’ and ’Summary of findings’ tables as per current recommendations. We have also refined the unit of analysis section, as
per current recommendations, to include Zelen designed trials and trials that report adjusted effect sizes.
We have also added four sensitivity analyses, one for trials that employed Zelen’smethod of randomisation; one for trials that contributed
substantial (> 75%) levels of heterogeneity; one for trials that specifically recruited individuals diagnosed with borderline personality
disorder; and a fourth for trials that included a small minority (< 15%) of adolescent participants.
