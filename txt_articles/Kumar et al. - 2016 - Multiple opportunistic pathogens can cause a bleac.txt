Originality-significance statement: Macroalgae, the ecosystem engineers of marine temperate 
reef systems suffer from a number of diseases for which the causative agent remains 
unknown. In this study we provide original experimental evidence that opportunistic bacterial 
pathogens from taxonomically diverse groups can cause identical disease outcomes in the red 
alga Delisea pulchra. We further show that disease is associated with lower microbial 
diversity and general dysbiosis. These findings make a significant original contribution not 
only to the field of marine symbiosis but also address fundamental questions of pathogen 
evolution, dysbiosis and disease relevant across many host systems.

Abstract  
While macroalgae (or seaweeds) are increasingly recognized to suffer from disease, in most 
cases the causative agents are unknown. The model macroalga Delisea pulchra is susceptible 
to a bleaching disease and previous work has identified two epiphytic bacteria, belonging to 
the Roseobacter clade, that cause bleaching under laboratory conditions. However, recent 
environmental surveys have shown that these in vitro pathogens are not abundant in naturally 
bleached D. pulchra, suggesting the presence of other pathogens capable of causing this algal 
disease. To test this hypothesis, we cultured bacteria that were abundant on bleached tissue 
across multiple disease events and assessed their ability to cause bleaching disease. We 
identified the new pathogens Alteromonas sp. BL110, Aquimarina sp. AD1 and BL5 and 
Agarivorans sp BL7 that are phylogenetically diverse, distinct from the previous two 
pathogens and can also be found in low abundance in healthy individuals. Moreover, we 
found that bacterial communities of diseased individuals that were infected with these 
pathogens were less diverse and more divergent from each other than those of healthy algae. 
This study demonstrates that multiple and opportunistic pathogens can cause the same disease 
outcome for D. pulchra and we postulate that such pathogens are more common in marine 
systems than previously anticipated.

Introduction 
 
Marine microorganisms have important functions for the health and wellbeing of 
multicellular organisms, as demonstrated for the zooxanthellae in corals, the photosynthetic 
symbionts in sponges and the protective layer of epiphytic bacteria associated with 
macroalgae (Rosenberg et al., 2007, Penesyan et al., 2009, Webster & Taylor, 2012). 
However, negative interactions are also increasingly recognized, including the role 
microorganisms play in the disease of corals, sponges, seagrasses, macroalgae, fish, 
crustacean and molluscs (Wahl et al., 2012). While several microbial diseases have in the 
past been explained by single pathogens, such as the mortality of shrimp caused by Vibrio 
harveyi (Austin & Zhang, 2006), the white pox disease of corals caused by Serratia 
marcescens (Patterson et al., 2002) and the brown ring disease of clams due to Vibrio tapetis 
infection (Allam et al., 2002), the causative agents of disease in many marine organisms 
often remain unknown, are polymicrobial (e.g. black band disease of corals (Sato et al., 
2015)) or are inconsistently reported (Bourne et al., 2009, Cook et al., 2013, Joyner et al., 
2015). Moreover, it has been proposed, but not experimentally addressed, that some marine 
diseases can be caused not by just one but likely multiple individual pathogens and that these 
may be opportunistic in nature (Brown et al., 2012, Burge et al., 2013, Cook et al., 2013, 
Egan et al., 2014, Joyner et al., 2015). Opportunistic pathogens are defined here as those that 
are present on both healthy and diseased hosts but only become harmful following a 
disturbance of their host (Brown et al., 2012). Such opportunism has been mainly studied in 
the context of human disease including skin infections caused by commensal Staphylococcus 
aureus (Krishna & Miller, 2012) and environmentally acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infections in immune-compromised patients (Wagner & Iglewski, 2008). Given the large 
diversity of microorganisms that marine hosts are exposed to (Lynch & Neufeld, 2015;

Zinger et al., 2011) and the prevalence of putative virulence factors in marine bacteria as 
revealed by (meta-) genomic studies (Persson et al., 2009, Gennari et al., 2012), it may be 
argued that a specific disease phenotype in the marine environment can be mediated by 
different bacterial pathogens. However, while the ecology of opportunistic pathogens in 
marine systems has been recognized as an emerging field (Burge et al., 2013) this concept 
has not been extensively tested.  
 
Macroalgae are important habitat formers in temperate, coastal systems, where they provide a 
protective habitat, nursery and a food source for many species of fish and invertebrates. 
Macroalgae also have an increasing economic value as a food source (Gachon et al., 2010) 
and feed-stock for biofuels (Gross, 2008), which has led to a growing seaweed mariculture 
industry (Radulovich et al., 2015). However, these important marine organisms are also 
recognized to suffer from microbial diseases (Gachon et al., 2010, Egan et al., 2014). For 
example, agar-producing Gracilaria species and carrageenan-producing Kappaphycus 
species suffer from a whitening disease commonly known as ice-ice, believed to be caused by 
a bacterial infection (Largo et al., 1995, Weinberger et al., 1997). Similarly farmed Porphyra 
species are susceptible to a number of diseases (e.g. white-spot, red-rot and chytrid blight) as 
a result of fungal and/or oomycete infection (Gachon et al., 2010). In natural populations of 
macroalgae, disease has been linked to changes in environmental conditions, such as those 
induced by climate change and other anthropogenic factors (Harvell et al., 2009, Hoegh-
Guldberg & Bruno, 2010, Campbell et al., 2011), however in most cases the precise 
etiological agents remain unknown.  
 
The bleaching disease of the red macroalga Delisea pulchra is arguably one of the best-
studied models for macroalgal disease (Bauer & Robinson, 2002, Campbell et al., 2011,

Natrah et al., 2011, Harder et al., 2012, Egan et al., 2013, Cooper & Smith, 2015). This 
disease is characterized by the localized loss of pigment around the mid-thallus region 
(distinct from generalized photo-bleaching or fading), which subsequently spreads to cause 
low photosynthetic efficiencies, low reproduction levels and susceptibility to herbivore 
grazing (Campbell et al., 2014). Support that bleaching is due to infectious agents is based on 
the observations that distinct microbial communities are associated with diseased and healthy 
D. pulchra in the field (Fernandes et al., 2012) and that two bacterial epibionts of D. pulchra 
(Nautella italica R11 and Phaeobacter sp. LSS9; both in the family Rhodobacteraceae) can 
cause symptomatic bleaching in algal sporelings during in vitro infection assays (Case et al., 
2011, Fernandes et al., 2011). However, a recent, extensive culture-independent study found 
evidence only for Phaeobacter sp. LSS9 on diseased thalli during two separate bleaching 
events (Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015). These natural bleaching events were instead 
characterized by an enrichment of other taxa within the families Rhodobacteraceae and 
Flavobacteriaceae. These findings led to the hypothesis that other bacterial pathogens exist 
in natural communities associated with D. pulchra (Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015) and hence 
represent an opportunity to explore the multiple-pathogens concept introduced above. 
 
Here we test this concept, by first isolating, through an extensive culturing effort, a range of 
bacteria that are enriched on diseased compared to healthy D. pulchra thalli. These bacterial 
strains were then tested for their ability to cause bleaching in D. pulchra. Using a 
modification of Koch’s postulates involving the molecular detection of the pathogens, we 
identified three new and phylogenetically diverse bacterial species that are capable of causing 
disease. We further analyzed the microbial community of individual D. pulchra post-
infection in order to identify any underlying changes in the community that were associated 
with disease. The outcomes of this study show that multiple opportunistic pathogens are

capable of causing the same disease phenotype in D. pulchra and that the disease event is 
accompanied by a general dysbiosis of the host’s microbiome. 
 
Results 
Isolation and classification of bleaching-associated bacteria 
An extensive culturing effort (see Experimental Procedures) yielded a total of 156 isolates, of 
which 83 were obtained from bleached tissue and 73 from healthy tissue directly adjacent-to-
bleached tissue. We chose to also isolate bacteria from adjacent tissue because it might 
contain pathogens active on the host tissue prior to the occurrence of the bleaching 
symptoms. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for these isolates resulted in 66 unique 
sequences (Table S1). These unique sequences represented 26 operational taxonomic units 
(OTUs, at 97% identity cut-off), many (31%) of which were present on both tissue types. 
 
For both bleached (BL) and adjacent-to-bleached (AD) sample types, the majority (80%) of 
isolates classified into the phylum Proteobacteria (class alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria), 
with a smaller proportion (20%) to the phylum Bacteroidetes. The alpha-proteobacteria 
comprised entirely of the family Rhodobacteraceae, while the majority (60%) of gamma-
proteobacteria was assigned to the families Vibrionaceae and Alteromonadaceae. Isolates 
belonging to the Bacteroidetes were represented by members of the family Flavobacteriaceae 
(Figure S1). Phylogenetic analysis further highlighted the taxonomic breadth of the isolates 
(Figure 1) and showed that the bacteria isolated from BL and AD tissue types had little 
overall phylogenetic difference (Unifrac similarity score: 0.842167; P <0.001).

Twenty-nine (out of total 156) isolates obtained here matched 18 OTUs found in a previous 
 
study on both healthy and diseased individuals associated with two disease events occurring 
 
at distinct locations near Sydney, Australia (i.e. Long Bay and/ or Bare Island) (Zozaya-
 
Valdes et al., 2015). Of these isolates, 19 were represented by 9 OTUs that were significantly 
 
enriched (i.e. in higher abundance) on bleached D. pulchra in at least one of the previous 
 
bleaching events (Figure 2, Table 1). Among these bleaching-enriched isolates were 
 
Aquimarina sp. strains AD1, BL5 and AD10 (represented by OTU00001), Alteromonas sp. 
 
strains BL110 and BL86 (represented by OTU00052), Agarivorans sp. BL7 (represented by 
 
OTU00909), Winogradskyella sp. strain BL18 (represented by OTU00043) and Vibrio sp. 
 
strains AD104, AD65, AD098, AD47, AD95, BL0114 and BL89 (represented by 
 
OTU00036), which we defined as candidate pathogens. 
 
 
 
Candidate pathogens can induce in vivo disease in D. pulchra 
 
To determine if any of the isolates enriched in the microbial communities associated with 
 
bleached D. pulchra can cause disease, an in vivo infection assay was performed. This 
 
infection assay was based on harvesting juvenile D. pulchra from the field, which are in 
 
limited supply. We could therefore only choose a sub-set of isolates to test in the infection 
 
experiments and the selection was based on a) using strains with high relative abundance in 
 
bleaching events (i.e. OTU1 represented by Aquimarina sp. strains AD1, BL5 and AD10), b) 
 
having closely related strains from either bleached or adjacent tissue (i.e. Aquimarina sp. 
 
strains AD1, BL5 and AD10) and c) strains spanning a large phylogenetic distance (i.e. 
 
Alteromonas sp. strains BL110, Agarivorans sp. BL7 and Winogradskyella sp. strain BL18) 
 
(see Figure 1). N. italica R11 was also tested in the infection assay as this strain has been 
 
shown to cause bleaching in laboratory-reared sporelings (Case et al., 2011, Campbell et al., 
 
2014). N. italica R11, however, did not cause consistent bleaching in juveniles (P= 0.435,

Figure 3). In contrast, the strains Aquimarina sp. AD1 and BL5, Agarivorans sp. BL7 and 
 
Alteromonas sp. BL110 were shown to cause substantial bleaching of juvenile D. pulchra 
 
when compared to uninoculated controls (Figure 3, P= 0.007, 0.053, 0.005 and 0.004 
 
respectively). In some cases, up to 70% of the individual thalli tested showed bleaching, 
 
however some individuals also showed no response when exposed to the candidate 
 
pathogens. 
 
 
 
Community analysis on diseased (bleached) and healthy (unbleached) D. pulchra reveals 
 
candidate pathogens  
 
In order to show that the candidate pathogens are indeed present on bleached samples from 
 
the infection assay and underrepresented on unbleached samples, we performed 16S rRNA 
 
gene based analysis of the total bacterial community present on the alga at the end of the 
 
infection assay. Sufficient DNA for 16S rRNA gene amplification was obtained for samples 
 
inoculated with strain Aquimarina sp. AD1, and Alteromonas sp. BL110 as well as the 
 
control, and we could analyze four samples of each treatment with either a bleached or a non-
 
bleached outcome (total of 24 samples: 3 treatments x 2 outcomes x 4 replicates). 
 
 
 
Sequence data was clustered into OTUs at an identity cut-off of 100% and spurious OTUs 
 
were removed with an abundance filter (see Experimental Procedures). This resulted in 2 569 
 
unique OTU sequences, including two OTUs, OTU18472 and OTU08694, that matched 
 
Aquimarina sp. AD1 and Alteromonas sp. BL110 with 100% and 99% identity, respectively. 
 
We then used the relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences to assess the prevalence of 
 
the sequences corresponding to the two strains in each condition. Both strains were absent in 
 
the controls, whether the individual thalli were bleached or not (Figure 4). Aquimarina sp. 
 
AD1 and Alteromonas sp. BL110 were, however, found to be present in the inoculated

treatment and were more abundant on bleached thalli than on non-bleached samples (P=0.059 
for Aquimarina sp. AD1 and P=0.022 for Alteromonas sp. BL110). In the case of 
Alteromonas sp. BL110, the corresponding OTU accounted for, on average 35% of the total 
16S rRNA gene data on bleached samples. The OTU for Aquimarina sp. AD1 only attained 
an average abundance of 0.1% in the bleached samples, but was not detected in the non-
bleached samples. This result shows a clear correlation between bleaching and the presence 
of either of the two pathogens. 
 
Bacterial communities associated with in vivo bleaching of D. pulchra are less diverse but 
more divergent than those associated with healthy thalli 
To understand how the pathogens influence the community associated with D. pulchra, we 
re-clustered the 16S rRNA gene sequence data at 97% similarity cut-off. After removal of 
spurious OTUs (see Experimental Procedures), removal of two samples with very low 
number of reads (uninoculated controls C_56 and C_78; Table S2) and subsampling to the 
size of the smallest sample (33,889), a total of 984 OTUs were obtained. Rarefaction curves 
and Good’s coverage (0.931 for a cutoff of 0.03) suggest a high coverage of the community 
for all samples (Figure S2). A significantly lower OTU-based diversity (inverse Simpson 
index) was observed for samples with a bleached phenotype compared to healthy ones 
(P=0.04), however pathogens alone did not have a significant effect (P=0.61) (Figure S3). 
Multivariant analysis (PERMANOVA) detected a significant overall effect of treatment and 
outcome (Table S3), which was due to the fact that bleached samples were significantly more 
divergent from one another than communities from healthy alga (PERMDISP (P=0.002)) 
(Figure 5, Table S3).

Culture-independent techniques have been instrumental in understanding correlations 
between deterioration of host-health and shifts in associated microbiota (Mao-Jones et al., 
2010, Closek et al., 2014). However, infection experiments are essential to demonstrate 
disease causality and this can only be achieved by having putative pathogens in culture. In 
order to isolate ecologically relevant pathogens for the bleaching disease of D. pulchra, we 
established a culture collection of bacteria from bleached and adjacent-to-bleached tissues. 
Previous culture-independent studies have demonstrated that the algal thallus directly 
adjacent to the bleached tissue harbors bacterial taxa common to both healthy (unbleached) 
and diseased (bleached) tissue (Fernandes et al., 2012), indicating that this region contains a 
microbial transition phase between a “healthy” and a “disease” community. Bacteria cultured 
from the surface of diseased D. pulchra largely belong to the phylum Proteobacteria followed 
by Bacteroidetes. Bacterial members of these phyla are readily cultured from marine host 
surfaces using non-selective media (Ivanova et al., 2004, Montalvo et al., 2014, Penterman et 
al., 2014). Whilst culturing is known to have an inherent bias and does not adequately reflect 
the true microbial diversity (Hugenholtz et al., 1998), here we found that more than half of 
the isolates (56%) corresponded to OTUs found in a previous culture-independent study of 
the surface-community of both healthy and diseased D. pulchra (Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015) 
(Figure 2). In fact, our culturing effort captured isolates, which combined matched OTUs that 
comprise 27% of the total community abundance on diseased D. pulchra. This included a 
member of the genus Aquimarina, which represented the most dominant OTU found on 
diseased D. pulchra (Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015). Other isolates in the culture collection that 
belonged to OTUs overrepresented in previous disease events included those from diverse 
taxa within the Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Alteromonadaceae. Together these 
findings highlight that despite being able to capture a very small proportion of the total 
diversity (i.e. 66 unique sequences from the culture collection compared to > 1 500 unique

11 
OTUs from the culture-independent analysis (Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015)), we have isolated 
bacterial strains corresponding to OTUs that are among the most dominant 16S rRNA gene 
sequences on diseased tissue in the field and thus arguably the more ecologically relevant 
strains. 
 
The pathogenicity of isolates that were enriched on diseased tissue was assessed using 
juvenile D. pulchra. These results identified four pathogens of D. pulchra representing three 
different bacterial genera, namely Alteromonas sp. BL110, Agarivorans sp BL7 and 
Aquimarina sp. AD1 and BL5, which belong to the families Alteromonadaceae 
(Gammaproteobacteria) and Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteroidetes). These bacterial strains are 
also found (albeit in lower abundance) on healthy seaweed hosts (Fernandes et al., 2012, 
Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015) and their enrichment in diseased samples is indicative of an 
opportunistic adaptive response. Among these bacterial groups, only members of the genus 
Alteromonas have previously been implicated in disease of macroalgae (Vairappan et al., 
2001, Staufenberger et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2008, Peng & Li, 2013). Specifically, 
Alteromonas sp. strain A-1 (with >97% homology to BL110) was isolated from diseased 
Saccharina japonica located in a Chinese kelp farm and was shown in laboratory assays to 
infect healthy axenic S. japonica gametophytes (Peng & Li, 2013). Many members of the 
Flavobacteriaceae, including those closely related to Aquimarina sp. AD1, are known to 
enzymatically hydrolyze polysaccharides present in algal cell walls and have thus been 
indirectly implied in disease (Ivanova et al., 2004, Goecke et al., 2010, Hollants et al., 2012). 
However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to highlight their direct role as 
causative agents in a seaweed disease.

Our study shows that pathogens causing bleaching disease of D. pulchra are found in 
phylogenetically diverse groups and are not just restricted to the Rhodobacteraceae, as 
suggested based on previous studies of the two isolates N. italica R11 and P. gallaeciensis 
LSS9 (Case et al., 2011, Fernandes et al., 2011). Together with the observation that closely 
related Aquimarina isolates displayed different capacity to cause disease, suggests that 
taxonomic affiliation alone is not a good indicator of a bacterium’s pathogenicity. Microbial 
community assemblage based on functional traits rather than phylogeny has previously been 
reported for healthy seaweed hosts (Burke et al. 2011). Our data suggests that non-species 
specific traits may also be important determinates of a bacterium’s ability to cause disease in 
seaweeds. Future work using comparative –omic approaches should reveal the traits, 
common to the multiple pathogens identified here, that are relevant for causing disease in D. 
pulchra. 
 
Multiple pathogens of specific marine hosts have been previously reported with cases of 
infection by individual pathogens traditionally being diagnosed by distinct host pathologies, 
as is the case for bleaching of corals caused by Vibrio sp. (Rosenberg & Falkovitz, 2004), 
white pox disease by Serratia sp. (Patterson et al., 2002) and brown-band disease by a ciliate 
(Bourne et al., 2008). However more recent studies have also suggested some coral diseases 
may, in fact, be caused by multiple etiologies (Cook et al., 2013, Joyner et al., 2015) 
highlighting the need for more robust disease diagnosis (Pollock et al., 2011). Similarly, 
earlier studies of Kappaphycus alvarezii have suggested that multiple bacteria may contribute 
to the emergence of ice-ice disease in this commercially valuable seaweed (Largo et al., 
1995). Thus the discovery of multiple opportunistic pathogens resulting in the same disease 
in D. pulchra further argues for a wider search for opportunistic pathogens that result in 
defined disease syndromes in other marine hosts.

Whilst the newly identified pathogens cause the same bleaching symptom, their abundance 
patterns post-infection were significantly different, with strain AD1 representing 0.1% of the 
total bacterial community on bleached D. pulchra compared to up to 35% abundance for 
BL110. These observations imply that either Aquimarina sp. AD1 employs a lower 
‘infectious dose’ than Alteromonas sp. BL110 to cause disease, or that Aquimarina sp. AD1 
is shed from hosts post infection, as has been seen for other opportunistic pathogens 
(Madetoja et al., 2000, Merikanto et al., 2012). To address these two alternatives, future work 
should correlate pathogen abundance along a defined time course following disease 
progression. 
 
Surprisingly, the pathogen N. italica R11, for which virulence has previously been 
determined using algal sporelings in vitro (Case et al., 2011) and adults in situ (Campbell et 
al., 2014) did not cause reproducible bleaching symptoms in juveniles of D. pulchra (Figure 
3). One possible explanation for this is that the combined contribution of pathogen action and 
host response has different outcomes reflecting the life-history stages of the host. The 
reduced susceptibility towards N. italica R11 observed here maybe indicative of increased 
general environmental resilience in the juvenile stage of D. pulchra. In both terrestrial plants 
(Bazzaz et al., 1987) and kelps (Graham, 2002), ‘trade-offs’ between reproduction, growth 
and defense have been observed and the energy allocated to these different functions is 
prioritized during different life-history stages (Bazzaz et al., 1987). Thus it is possible that 
similar defense ‘trade-offs’ are involved in the growth-intensive sporeling and the 
reproductive adult stages of D. pulchra, resulting in a comparatively more resilient juvenile 
phase. In support of this, we have observed that juvenile D. pulchra are more robust when 
grown under aquaria conditions than either sporelings or adults (Kumar et al., unpublished).

A common assumption in the study of infectious disease is that the microorganisms most 
abundant or enriched on diseased hosts are the most likely candidates for pathogens (Mao-
Jones et al., 2010). Whilst this abundance-pathogen paradigm maybe true in some cases, for 
example, in Vibrio cholerae infections of humans (Sinha et al., 2013) or Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens in the crown-gall disease in plants (Stafford, 2000), our data indicate that 
causality strictly based on microbial abundance patterns in diseased individuals should not be 
assumed. Indeed bacterial strains, such as Aquimarina sp. AD10 and Winogradskyella sp. 
BL18, which are highly enriched on diseased algae in the field (Figure 2), are not pathogenic 
in the infection assays (Figure 3). In other cases, a pathogen may only be occasionally 
enriched during disease, such as was observed for the pathogenic strain Agarivorans sp. BL7 
(Figure 2). These findings, together with the previously observed inconsistent association of 
N. italica R11 and Phaeobacter sp. LSS9 over multiple bleaching events (Fernandes et al., 
2012, Zozaya-Valdes et al., 2015), highlight that these pathogens of macroalgae do not 
always follow predictable patterns of infection. Rather variations in abundance during disease 
are likely to be a combined result of inherent virulence characteristics of the pathogen/s, host 
susceptibility (see discussion of life-stages above) and the potentially protective role of the 
host microbiome. Thus our findings support a recent paradigm shift in viewing disease by 
opportunistic pathogens to include a number of possible outcomes based on the specific host-
microbe interaction (Casadevall & Pirofski, 2001, Casadevall & Pirofski, 2002, Lorenzo, 
2015).  
 
Analysis of the bacterial community associated with diseased and healthy individuals found 
no significant effect on the community due to treatment alone, with the presence of the 
pathogen per se having little impact on diversity (Figure S3). However the outcome of

15 
bleaching was significantly correlated with a reduction in diversity (Figure S3) and microbial 
communities on diseased individuals were significantly more divergent from one another 
than those on their healthy counterparts (Figure 5, Table S3). In other ecological systems, 
increases in community divergence between individual samples have been correlated with 
disturbance to the natural community structure (O’Connor, 2013, Séguin et al., 2013, Rubal 
et al., 2014). For example, disturbance induced by draining rock pools resulted in increased 
within-group dissimilarity in the communities of marine benthic algae and sessile animals 
inhabiting the pools (Séguin et al., 2013). Increased phylogenetic divergence was also 
observed for the microbiome of the kelp Ecklonia radiata, where the characteristic ‘core’ 
community associated with healthy hosts was replaced with taxonomically diverse microbial 
communities following host stress (Marzinelli et al., 2015). While future studies should also 
consider the dynamics of other microbial members of the seaweed holobiont (e.g. viruses, 
eukaryotes), the current study nevertheless contributes to the increasing evidence that host 
condition impacts the structure of associated bacterial communities and maybe linked to the 
proliferation or activity of a pathogen, ultimately result in microbial dysbiosis. Such 
microbial dysbioses as a function and/or cause of disease is broadly relevant to both 
environmental and medical diseases. Indeed microbial dysbiosis has been linked to disease in 
marine invertebrates (Webster, 2007, Meres et al., 2012), colony collapse in honeybees 
(Hamdi et al., 2011) and human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Tamboli et 
al., 2004, Pham & Lawley, 2014) and periodontitis (Hajishengallis, 2015). Thus, the isolation 
of multiple and opportunistic pathogens representing different bacterial taxonomic groups 
that cause the same disease in D. pulchra provides a powerful model to address fundamental 
questions on pathogen evolution, dysbiosis and disease that will be relevant across diverse 
host systems.

Experimental Procedures 
Bacterial isolation  
Sampling of D. pulchra was carried out in February 2012 (late summer). Algae showing 
bleaching in mid thalli regions were collected from Long Bay, Sydney (151ᵒ14’42’’ E, 
33ᵒ58’19’’ S) from depths of eight meters. Samples were transported to the laboratory and 
bleached and directly adjacent-to-bleached tissues of D. pulchra were excised and rinsed 
individually in filter-sterilized seawater (FSW) to remove loosely attached bacteria. Excised 
tissue was subsequently swabbed using sterile cotton applicators and the swab transferred to 
FSW, vortexed vigorously, and the solution was spread onto half-strength Marine Agar 
(DifcoTM 2216) and incubated for 4 days at room temperature. Isolation of bacterial colonies 
was based on a random sampling method whereby agar plates were divided into quadrats and 
a random number generator was used to select ten quadrats, from which individual colonies 
were isolated. 
 
16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis 
PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of individual bacterial isolates was performed 
according to Penesyan et al. (2009) using primers F27 (5’-GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-
3’) and R1492 (5’-ACGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’). PCR products were sequenced via 
Sanger sequencing at the Ramaciotti Center for Genomics, UNSW. A phylogenetic tree was 
constructed using >700 nucleotide bases from 66 unique sequences, together with the closest 
relatives available in the NCBI non-redundant database (Zhang et al., 2000) in November 
2014. The sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE aligner (Edgar, 2004) in Molecular 
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 6 package. Phylogenetic distance between groups 
of isolates obtained from the two different types of algal tissue (bleached or adjacent-to-
bleached) was assessed using UniFrac (Lozupone & Knight, 2005) in Mothur (Schloss et al.,

2009). Evolutionary history of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was inferred using the 
Maximum Likelihood method (Tamura & Nei, 1993) and the evolutionary distances were 
computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method (Tamura et al., 2004). A 
phylogenetic tree was constructed using a total of 111 aligned nucleotide sequences and 
tested with 1000 bootstraps (Tamura et al., 2013). 
 
To identify those bacterial isolates in the culture collection that are enriched during bleaching 
in the field, we compared the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates to a previous culture-
independent deep amplicon sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) targeting the V4 region of the 
16S rRNA gene from microbial communities associated with two distinct D. pulchra 
bleaching events occurring at Bare Island and Long Bay near Sydney, Australia (Zozaya-
Valdes et al., 2015). Briefly, isolate sequences were trimmed to 100 bp of the V4 region that 
corresponded to the previous amplicon study and aligned against the SILVA reference 
database using Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009). The resulting 37 unique isolate sequences were 
then compared with BLAST against all representative sequences from OTUs (defined at 97% 
sequence identity) of the amplicon study using a 100% identity and coverage cut-off. The 
standardized abundances of the selected OTUs were fit to a Generalized Linear Model 
(GLM), using a negative binomial distribution with the R mvabund software package (Wang 
et al., 2012). The GLMs were then used to test the significance of difference in abundances 
of the selected OTUs between healthy (i.e. unbleached) and diseased (i.e. bleached) samples 
using analysis of deviance. For this, the ANOVA function implemented in mvabund was 
used with nBoot=10000, p.uni=“unadjusted".

One hundred microliters of log-phase cultures of the test isolates obtained here or N. italica 
R11 were inoculated into 10 ml DifcoTM Marine Broth 2216 and incubated at 25 °C with 
agitation at 160 rpm. After 18 hrs incubation, bacterial cultures were centrifuged at 3000 x g 
for 10 min and the cell pellet was washed twice with bromide-free artificial seawater (Br- 
ASW) and resuspended in sterile Br- ASW to give an OD600 = 0.1. One millilitre of this 
culture (corresponding to a final inoculum concentration of 107 cfu/ml) was used in the 
infection assay. 
 
Previous studies on the disease of D. pulchra have been based on laboratory-reared, 
chemically undefended sporelings to detect bacterial pathogens (Case et al., 2011, Campbell 
et al., 2014). Here we used an assay that is closer to the natural situation by using whole thalli 
of juvenile collected from the field. Briefly, on day 0, algae were transferred from the field 
and placed into individual sterile 25 cm2 Corning® polystyrene tissue culture flasks with 
vented caps. The flask contained 50 ml of 0.22 µm filtered and autoclaved seawater. Algae 
were permitted to acclimatise and on day 1, seawater in the flasks was replaced with sterile 
Br- ASW to reduce the level of the alga’s chemical defence, which is based on bromide-
containing furanone compounds and mimics host stress (Dworjanyn et al., 1999). Replicate 
algae were inoculated with 1 ml of test bacteria (as prepared above) or sterile Br- ASW alone 
as a procedural control. 
 
Flasks were incubated at 25 °C under 15:9 light dark cycle and agitated at 80 rpm. At day 3, 
seawater in the flasks was replaced, followed by re-inoculation with a fresh preparation of the 
inoculum (as outlined above). The algae were assessed for the presence or absence of 
bleaching on day 5. Experiments were repeated three times with six replicates per treatment 
(i.e. total n=18). A two-way ANOVA was used to test for consistency between independent

19 
experiments and to determine the effect of treatments relative to the respective uninoculated 
 
control. All analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism 6.03 (San Diego, CA, USA).  
 
 
 
Analysis of microbial communities post infection 
 
Bacterial communities associated with D. pulchra at the end of the infection assay were 
 
assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Total bacterial community DNA was 
 
extracted from the surface of four individual algae from each treatment and control using the 
 
selective extraction method described by Burke et al. (2009). The primers, 27F 
 
(AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 519R (GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG) were used to 
 
amplify the V1-3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene and paired-end sequencing of the resulting 
 
16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Caporaso et al., 
 
2012) at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics, UNSW. 
 
 
 
Sequence analysis was performed following the MiSeq SOP in Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009, 
 
Kozich et al., 2013). Briefly, after making contigs, sequences with ambiguous bases or 
 
lengths exceeding 525 bp were removed. Unique contigs were then identified and aligned 
 
against the SILVA reference database (Pruesse et al., 2007). Poorly aligned sequences or 
 
those containing homopolymers greater than 8 bp were removed and remaining sequences 
 
trimmed to remove gaps and ends overhanging the V1-3 region. Sequences were pre-
 
clustered (allowing for 2 differences, per sequence), followed by an abundance-based sorting. 
 
Chimeric sequences were identified using the Uchime algorithm (Edgar et al., 2011) and 
 
removed along with singleton sequences. Sequences were taxonomically classified using the 
 
Greengenes reference taxonomy (Werner et al., 2012) and a naïve Bayesian approach (Wang 
 
et al., 2007). Sequences assigned as chloroplast, mitochondria, archaea, eukaryotes and those 
 
unassigned at the domain level were removed. In order to detect sequences corresponding to

20 
the inoculated bacteria quality-filtered sequences were clustered into OTUs at 100% identity 
 
using the default average neighbor algorithm. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 
 
inoculated bacteria were then queried against OTUs sequences using BLAST 2.2.30+ 
 
(Altschul et al., 1990). 
 
 
 
The R mvabund package (Wang et al., 2012) was used to assess differences in abundance of 
 
16S rRNA gene sequences corresponding to the inoculated bacteria between treatments using 
 
a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Univariate test statistics were calculated using ordinary 
 
unadjusted P values, where P < 0.05 was considered significant. Abundance plots of the 
 
OTUs in corresponding inoculated-treatments and the uninoculated controls were visualized 
 
using box plots in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA, USA).  
 
 
 
The total bacterial community present in each treatment sample was further analyzed by 
 
clustering OTUs at 97% similarity to consensus taxonomy with an OTU abundance threshold 
 
of 0.0003% (Bokulich et al., 2013). Samples with low number of sequences (<2000) were 
 
removed and remaining samples standardized to account for different sequencing depths by 
 
subsampling to the sequence counts of the smallest sample (here 33,889). Rarefaction data 
 
for quality- and abundance-filtered sequences was generated in Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009). 
 
In order to identify the underlying changes (i.e. other than the differences in abundance of 
 
sequences related to the inoculated bacteria) in the bacterial community between healthy and 
 
diseased D. pulchra, sequences corresponding to the inoculated bacteria were removed. 
 
Inverse-Simpson diversity indices were determined in Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) and 
 
statistical analysis performed in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA, USA). Additional 
 
statistical analysis of community data was performed using PRIMER (Clarke & Gorley, 
 
2006). Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient for square-root transformed sequence counts was

calculated to analyze community structure. Multivariate patterns were illustrated using a non-
metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plot. A Jaccard resemblance matrix was created to 
compare community composition. Multivariate analysis of the effect of treatment and the 
bleaching outcome on the overall abundances of OTUs were tested using PERMANOVA+ 
(Anderson, 2001). Univariate analysis, within PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001) was used to 
test for differences within treatments and bleaching outcomes. In order to test whether 
differences between assemblages were due to different multivariate dispersion (or 
divergence) between samples, PERMDISP was used (Anderson, 2001), P < 0.05 was 
considered significant.

from GenBank, in November 2014. The phyla to which the strains belong are indicated on 
the right. The maximum likelihood tree was constructed in MEGA6 using the aligned partial 
16S rRNA gene sequences (approximately 700 nucleotide bases). Bootstrap method, with a 
thousand replications was used as the test of phylogeny. The tree is drawn to scale with 
branch lengths representing the number of base substitutions per nucleotide position. 
 
Figure 2 Fourth root transformation of relative abundances of OTUs (classified at 97%) on 
bleached (diseased; black circles) and healthy (unbleached; red triangles) D. pulchra from: 
(A) Long Bay, where significant increase in abundances of OTU00001, OTU00043, 
OTU00262, OTU00052, OTU00036, OTU00258, OTU00053 and OTU00463 (P<0.05) were 
observed and (B) Bare Island, where significant increases in abundances of OTU00001, 
OTU00262 and OTU00499 (P<0.05) were observed. OTUs with significant increases 
between healthy and bleached samples are highlighted in blue. Analysis on OTU abundances 
for both disease events were conducted using mvabund hypothesis tests (Wang et al., 2012). 
*Refer to Table 1 for ID of other isolates included in the OTU. 
 
Figure 3 Bleaching of D. pulchra after inoculation with candidate pathogens. (A) Bar graph 
showing the effect of adding candidate pathogens on the health of juvenile D. pulchra. For 
each treatment, the data represents the mean ± standard error values calculated from six 
replicates in three independent experiments (totaling 18 replicates per treatment). A two-way 
ANOVA was used to determine the effect of inoculation and to test for consistency between 
independent experiments. Increased bleaching in comparison to the controls was observed for 
AD1, BL5, BL7 and BL110 (P=0.007, P=0.053, P=0.005 and P=0.003, respectively). (B)

Figure 4 Box plots showing the relative abundances of the OTU’s based on 16S rRNA gene 
amplicon sequencing matching putative pathogens in inoculated treatments and uninoculated 
control treatments of (A) Aquimarina sp. AD1 (OTU18472). An increase in the abundance of 
OTU18472 in bleached D. pulchra in the inoculated treatment (P=0.059) was observed. (B) 
Alteromonas sp. BL110 (OTU08694). A significant increase in the abundance of OTU08694 
in bleached D. pulchra in the inoculated treatment (P=0.022) was observed. The mean of the 
data is represented with ‘+’. Mvabund hypothesis test was used to determine the effect of 
treatment on OTU abundances (Wang et al., 2012).

similarity cut-off) abundances on unbleached (healthy; triangles) and bleached (diseased; 
circles) samples of D. pulchra. The stress value was 0.12. Treatments are represented as 
follows: pink - inoculation with Aquimarina sp. AD1, green – inoculation with Alteromonas 
sp. BL110 and blue as the control group.
