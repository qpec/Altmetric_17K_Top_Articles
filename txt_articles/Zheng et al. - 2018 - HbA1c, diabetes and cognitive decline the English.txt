Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of the study was to evaluate longitudinal associations between HbA1c levels, diabetes status and
subsequent cognitive decline over a 10 year follow-up period.
Methods Data from wave 2 (2004–2005) to wave 7 (2014–2015) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) were
analysed. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline (wave 2) and reassessed every 2 years at waves 3–7. Linear mixed models
were used to evaluate longitudinal associations.
Results The study comprised 5189 participants (55.1% women, mean age 65.6 ± 9.4 years) with baseline HbA1c levels ranging
from 15.9 to 126.3 mmol/mol (3.6–13.7%). The mean follow-up duration was 8.1 ± 2.8 years and the mean number of cognitive
assessments was 4.9 ± 1.5. A 1 mmol/mol increment in HbA1c was significantly associated with an increased rate of decline in
global cognitive z scores (−0.0009 SD/year, 95% CI −0.0014, −0.0003), memory z scores (−0.0005 SD/year, 95% CI −0.0009,
−0.0001) and executive function z scores (−0.0008 SD/year, 95% CI −0.0013, −0.0004) after adjustment for baseline age, sex, total
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, BMI, education, marital status, depressive symp-
toms, current smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, CHD, stroke, chronic lung disease and cancer. Compared with partic-
ipants with normoglycaemia, the multivariable-adjusted rate of global cognitive decline associated with prediabetes and diabetes
was increased by −0.012 SD/year (95% CI −0.022, −0.002) and −0.031 SD/year (95% CI −0.046, −0.015), respectively (p for trend
<0.001). Similarly, memory, executive function and orientation z scores showed an increased rate of cognitive decline with diabetes.
Conclusions/interpretation Significant longitudinal associations between HbA1c levels, diabetes status and long-term cognitive
decline were observed in this study. Future studies are required to determine the effects of maintaining optimal glucose control on
the rate of cognitive decline in people with diabetes.

 Introduction
Of the psychiatric conditions strongly associated with poor
quality of later life, dementia is one of the most prevalent and
thus represents a serious public health burden, given the sub-
stantial increase in ageing populations around the world [1–3].
Diabetes, a metabolic disease characterised by hyperglycaemia
that can lead to long-term dysfunction, has rapidly increased in
prevalence over the past several decades [4, 5]. The association
between diabetes and dementia has been well documented
[6–8]; however, the association between diabetes and cognitive
decline is less well studied. Cognitive decline occurs over a
long period prior to dementia, and the trajectory of cognitive
decline, which consists of several assessments of cognitive
function, is important for evaluating and monitoring the pro-
gression of cognitive deterioration. Identification of risk factors
for cognitive decline could help screen individuals who may
benefit from early intervention.
HbA1c is central to the management of glucose control in
individuals with diagnosed diabetes and has recently been
recommended for use in diagnosing diabetes as well as iden-
tifying people at risk of developing diabetes [9]. Compared
with individual fasting or post-load blood glucose measure-
ments, HbA1c has better reliability between tests [10] because
it reflects average circulating glucose levels over the preced-
ing 2–3 months, making it a stronger predictor of subsequent
diabetes [11]. However, there is little research prospectively
investigating the association of hyperglycaemia, based on
HbA1c levels, with long-term cognitive decline in individuals
with and without diabetes [12, 13]. Moreover, the studies con-
ducted on this topic to date use cognitive trajectories that
consist of only three cognitive assessments [12, 13].
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) pre-
sents an opportunity to investigate the association between
HbA1c levels and the subsequent trajectory of cognitive de-
cline based on a greater number of cognitive assessments.
Therefore, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to
determine whether prediabetes (defined by an HbA1c level in
the range 38.8–46.4 mmol/mol [5.7–6.4%] [14]) and/or dia-
betes are associated with accelerated cognitive decline in an
elderly population with normal cognition at baseline; and (2)
to examine whether people with diabetes with better
glycaemic control, as measured by HbA1c levels, show a sim-
ilar or decreased rate of subsequent cognitive decline.
Methods
Study population This study used data from wave 2 (2004–
2005) to wave 7 (2014–2015) of the ELSA, a prospective and
nationally representative cohort of men and women living in
England aged 50 years and over [15]. A detailed description of
the goals, design and methods of the ELSA has been pub-
lished elsewhere [16]. A flow chart of participant selection
for the present study population based on inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 9432 individuals
attended the wave 2 survey of the ELSA. Of these, 1766 were
excluded from the present study because they did not have a
nurse visit (clinical assessment). A further 1883 individuals
were excluded for the following reasons: they had missing
HbA1c results (n = 1851), they did not complete all of the
cognitive tests (n = 17) or they had a confirmed diagnosis of
dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease at baseline (n = 15). An

 additional 594 individuals were excluded from the main anal-
ysis (but were included in a sensitivity analysis) because they
were lost to follow-up from waves 3 to 7. The remaining 5189
participants (2329 men and 2860 women) with complete base-
line data and at least one reassessment of cognitive function
(waves 3–7) were included in the analyses reported here.
The ELSA was approved by the London Multicentre
Research Ethics Committee (MREC/01/2/91). Informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Cognitive assessments Participants underwent a memory as-
sessment through immediate and delayed recall of ten unre-
lated words. Both immediate and delayed recall scores ranged
from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating better memory
performance. Immediate and delayed recall tests have been
shown to have good construct validity and consistency [17].
A composite memory score was created by summing the
scores of the two individual memory tests. Executive function
was assessed by a verbal fluency task in which participants
were required to orally name as many animals as they could in
60 s. The task is well documented to be both reliable and valid,
and has previously been used as an indicator of executive
function for the ELSA population [18]. The score for this task
was the total number of words produced, excluding repeat
words and non-animal words. Orientation was assessed by
asking four questions regarding the date, i.e. day of month,
month, year and day of week, and scoring one point for each
correct answer. Generally, higher scores indicate better cogni-
tive function.
To enable comparison across cognitive tests, z scores
standardised to wave 2 were generated for individual tests
by subtracting the mean score at wave 2 from the partici-
pant’s test score at each wave and dividing by the SD of the
wave 2 scores. A composite global cognitive z score was
calculated for each participant by averaging the z scores of
the three tests and re-standardising to wave 2 using the mean
and SD of the global cognitive z score at wave 2. A z score of
1 would therefore describe cognitive performance that is 1
SD above the mean score at wave 2. For all cognitive tests,
we used standardised values in the regression analysis to
allow for comparisons of regression coefficients across cog-
nitive tests.

 Measurement of HbA1c In wave 2, blood samples were col-
lected and sent to the Biochemistry Department at the Royal
Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, UK for laboratory analysis
[19]. Total HbA1c was measured by the Haematology
Department at the Royal Victoria Infirmary using a Tosoh
G7 analyser (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) [19]. The analytical
methods used for HbA1c measurement in the UK are required
to be traceable to the work carried out in the Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial (DCCT), part of the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program in the USA. The
Secondary Reference Laboratory at the University of
Minnesota was the main analytical laboratory for the DCCT
work.
Definition of diabetes and prediabetes Diabetes was defined
as an HbA1c level ≥47.5 mmol/mol (6.5%), a self-reported
physician diagnosis of diabetes or current use of glucose-
lowering therapy. Among participants without diabetes, we
defined prediabetes as an HbA1c level in the range 38.8–
46.4 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%), according to the 2014 American
Diabetes Association guidelines [4]. In participants with dia-
betes, HbA1c levels were further categorised using a standard
clinical cut-off value of 53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) to test the
effect of glucose management on subsequent cognitive de-
cline [4].
Covariates Covariates shown by previous studies to be asso-
ciated with both HbA1c levels and cognitive function were
selected for our analyses. These covariates included age,
sex, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, circu-
lating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), BMI, educa-
tion, marital status, depressive symptoms, current smoking,
alcohol consumption, hypertension, CHD, stroke, chronic
lung disease and cancer. Details of covariates are available
in the ESM Methods.
Statistical analysis The results are presented as percentages for
categorical variables and means ± SDs for normally distribut-
ed continuous variables. The results for high-sensitivity CRP
and triacylglycerol are presented as medians with interquartile
ranges because their distribution was highly skewed. The
cross-sectional associations between HbA1c levels and cogni-
tive scores at baseline were tested using multiple linear regres-
sion models, and linear mixed models were used to evaluate
longitudinal associations. We also conducted longitudinal
analyses to calculate the mean difference in the rate of change
in cognitive scores (SD/year) and compared categories of
baseline diabetes status using non-diabetic participants with
normal HbA1c levels (<38.8 mmol/mol [5.7%]) as the refer-
ence group. Linear mixed models can incorporate all available
follow-up data, account for the fact that repeated measures in
the same participant are correlated with each other, and handle
missing data. In the two models that we ran, both the intercept
and the slope were fitted as random effects to account for
inter-individual differences at baseline and different rates of
change in cognitive function over the follow-up period. The
first model included HbA1c levels (or diabetes status), time
(years since baseline), time × HbA1c interaction, age (years)
and sex (male or female). The time × HbA1c interaction term
indicated differential change by each one unit increment in
HbA1c from baseline to the end of the study. The second
model additionally adjusted for baseline total cholesterol
(mmol/l), HDL-cholesterol (mmol/l), triacylglycerol
(mmol/l), high-sensitivity CRP (nmol/l), BMI (kg/m2), educa-
tion (below level 3 National Vocational Qualification
[NVQ3]/General Certificate of Education [GCE] A level, or
above or equal to NVQ3/GCE A level), marital status (cur-
rently living alone or not), depressive symptoms (yes or no),
current smoking (yes or no), one or more alcoholic drinks
once or more per week (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no),
CHD (yes or no), stroke (yes or no), chronic lung disease (yes
or no) and cancer (yes or no).
We used a multiple imputation, chained-equations method
to replace missing data for cognitive assessments during
follow-up (waves 3–7) and used all available data from 5783
participants in the sensitivity analyses. Variables used to im-
pute the missing values of cognitive scores included partici-
pants’ baseline information (age, sex, education, marital sta-
tus, BMI, current smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes and
stroke) and baseline cognitive scores. For each longitudinal
analysis, we created 20 imputed data sets and combined the
results using the MIANALYZE procedure of SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). To detect differences in the
rate of change in cognitive z scores between individuals with
diabetes and those completely free of diabetes, we conducted
another sensitivity analysis that excluded 261 participants
with incident diabetes during follow-up.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute). All analyses were two-sided; an
alpha value of 0.05 was considered the threshold for statistical
significance.
Results
Baseline characteristics and sample size The mean age of the
5189 participants was 65.6 ± 9.4 years; 55.1% of participants
were women. Within the sample, 1190 participants (22.9%)
were classified as having prediabetes and 446 (8.6%) were
classified as having diabetes. The mean HbA1c level across
all participants was 37.7 ± 7.9 mmol/mol (5.57 ± 0.79%) and
ranged from 15.9 to 126.3 mmol/mol (3.6 to 13.7%). The
distribution of baseline covariates and cognitive scores by
diabetes status is shown in Table 1.
From waves 2 to 7, the cohort size was 5189, 4969, 4378,
4045, 3732 and 3276, respectively. The mean follow-up
842

 duration was 8.1 ± 2.8 years and the mean number of cogni-
tive assessments was 4.9 ± 1.5.
Baseline HbA1c levels, diabetes status and cognitive scores
(cross-sectional analyses) Linear regression analyses found
that baseline HbA1c levels were significantly associated
with global cognitive, memory and executive function z
scores after adjustment for age and sex, but these associ-
ations lost significance after further adjustment for total
cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, high-
sensitivity CRP, BMI, education, marital status, depres-
sive symptoms, current smoking, alcohol consumption,
hypertension, CHD, stroke, chronic lung disease and can-
cer (ESM Table 1). In both models, orientation scores
were not linearly associated with HbA1c levels. As shown
in ESM Fig. 1, none of the cognitive scores were signif-
icantly associated with baseline diabetes status after mul-
tivariable adjustment.
Baseline HbA1c levels, diabetes status and cognitive decline
(longitudinal analyses) Table 2 shows the longitudinal associ-
ations between HbA1c levels and rate of change in cognitive
scores. After multivariable adjustment, a 1 mmol/mol incre-
ment in HbA1c was significantly associated with an increased
rate of decline in global cognitive z scores (−0.0009 SD/year,
95% CI −0.0014, −0.0003), memory z scores (−0.0005 SD/
year, 95% CI −0.0009, −0.0001) and executive function z
scores (−0.0008 SD/year, 95% CI −0.0013, −0.0004), but
not orientation z scores (−0.0004 SD/year, 95% CI −0.0011,
0.0002).
As shown in Fig. 2, the cognitive scores of participants with
diabetes decreased at a greater rate than those of non-diabetic
participants with normal HbA1c levels (<38.8 mmol/mol
[5.7%]). The multivariable-adjusted rates of global cognitive
decline associated with prediabetes and diabetes were increased
by −0.012 SD/year (95% CI −0.022, −0.002) and −0.031 SD/
year (95% CI −0.046, −0.015), respectively (p for trend <0.001;

 Table 3), compared with the normal group. Similarly, memory,
executive function and orientation z scores also declined at a
greater rate in participants with diabetes (Table 3). Compared
with the normal group, the multivariable-adjusted rate of mem-
ory decline associated with diabetes was increased by −0.015
SD/year (95% CI −0.026, −0.003), and the rates of executive
function and orientation decline were increased by −0.022 SD/
year (95% CI −0.034, −0.009) and −0.023 SD/year (95% CI
−0.041, −0.006), respectively (Table 3).
We further categorised diabetic participants into two
groups using a standard clinical cut-off value for HbA1c
(53.0 mmol/mol [7.0%]). Among participants with diabetes
and an HbA1c level <53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%), the mean
HbA1c level was 45.7 ± 4.7 mmol/mol (6.33 ± 0.43%) and
the median level was 46.5 mmol/mol (6.4%). Among those
with diabetes and an HbA1c level ≥53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%), the
mean HbA1c level was 67.2 ± 14.6 mmol/mol (8.30 ± 1.34%)
and the median level was 61.8 mmol/mol (7.8%). As shown in
ESM Fig. 2, global cognitive z scores of participants with
diabetes and an HbA1c level ≥53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) declined
fastest during the follow-up. The overall decreased trend of
cognitive decline remained significant among the four groups
(p for trend <0.001). However, there was no significant differ-
ence in the rate of global cognitive decline between the two
diabetic groups (p = 0.453; ESM Fig. 2). Compared with par-
ticipants with diabetes and an HbA1c level <53.0 mmol/mol
(7.0%), the multivariable-adjusted rate of global cognitive de-
cline associated with diabetic participants with an HbA1c level
≥53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) showed a non-significant increase of
−0.007 SD/year (95% CI −0.023, 0.036). In addition, we di-
vided 446 participants with diabetes into two groups accord-
ing to whether they were taking glucose-lowering therapies at
baseline. The results showed that glucose-lowering therapies
were not significantly associated with future cognitive decline
(ESM Table 2).
Non-response analyses From the completed ELSA cohort,
3649 individuals (38.7%) were excluded from this study be-
cause of incomplete baseline data or a confirmed diagnosis of
dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease. This group of excluded
participants had: a higher percentage of women; were living
alone; had depressive symptoms; were smokers; had self-
reported diabetes, CHD or stroke; a lower percentage of high
education and alcohol consumption; and poorer cognitive
function (ESM Table 3). An additional 594 individuals
(6.3%), who were excluded because of loss to follow-up, also
had higher levels of the major risk factors and poorer cognitive
function (ESM Table 4).
Sensitivity analyses Longitudinal analysis results using imput-
ed data (n = 5783) were similar to those from the main analy-
ses (ESM Tables 5 and 6). Thus, the impact of missing data on
our main findings was likely to be small. Likewise, another
sensitivity analysis showed similar results to those of the main
analysis when 261 participants who became diabetic during
follow-up were excluded (ESM Tables 7 and 8).

 Discussion
In this community-based population, we observed a signifi-
cant trend for cognitive decline over a 10 year period among
individuals aged ≥50 years with normoglycaemia, prediabetes
or diabetes at baseline. Additionally, HbA1c levels were line-
arly associated with subsequent cognitive decline in memory
and executive function (but not orientation) irrespective of
diabetes status at baseline.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective
study of the association between diabetes (assessed using
HbA1c levels) and cognitive decline that analyses data from
more than three cognitive assessments over time. From these
data, we were able to generate a reliable and accurate trajec-
tory of cognitive decline with which to investigate this asso-
ciation. Our results are compatible with prior studies exploring
this association using clinical categories of HbA1c levels [12,
13]. Two cohort studies, both conducted in middle-aged pop-
ulations, reported significantly faster cognitive decline in par-
ticipants with diabetes than in those with normoglycaemia,
although the tests used to measure cognitive function were
different from those used in our study [12, 13]. Regarding
the relationship between prediabetes and cognitive decline,
results are inconsistent between studies. In agreement with
the present study, Tuligenga et al reported that cognitive de-
cline was not significantly faster in people with prediabetes
than in those with normoglycaemia [13]. Conversely,
Rawlings et al reported that cognitive decline was significant-
ly faster among people with prediabetes than among those
with normal HbA1c levels [12]. Given the similar trends of
cognitive decline among participants with normoglycaemia,
prediabetes and diabetes in all three of the aforementioned
studies, it is possible that sample size is responsible for the
controversial results. In particular, the significant result for
cognitive decline in people with prediabetes vs those with
normoglycaemia was obtained from a cohort of 2365 individ-
uals with prediabetes [12], whereas the non-significant results
were obtained from cohorts of only 648 and 1190 individuals
with prediabetes in the study by Tuligenga et al [13] and the
present study, respectively. Further studies with larger sample
sizes are required to validate the association between predia-
betes and cognitive decline.
According to recommendations of the American Diabetes
Association, maintaining an HbA1c level of less than
53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) could help prevent diabetes-related mi-
crovascular complications [9]. Therefore, using HbA1c levels as
a marker of glucose management, we divided our diabetic par-
ticipants into two groups to examine the effect of glucose man-
agement on subsequent cognitive decline. The results revealed
that while both groups showed a significant trend towards cog-
nitive decline, there was no significant difference between the
two groups. This result agrees with that of a previous study
reporting a greater but not statistically significant decline in di-
abetic participants with an HbA1c level of at least 53.0 mmol/
mol (7.0%) [12]. This finding might be attributable to diabetes
treatment-related adverse events such as severe hypoglycaemia
[20], which would result in fluctuations in blood glucose levels.
Although the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated, it
is suggested that both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia play
important roles in diabetes-related cognitive decline [21, 22].
Studies of cellular mechanisms suggest that, compared with
sustained hyperglycaemia, glycaemic fluctuations may have a

 greater adverse effect on endothelial function and induce more
oxidative stress, potentially leading to greater cognitive decline
[23, 24]. However, findings from randomised clinical trials are
conflicting. No effect on cognitive decline was observed follow-
ing an intervention to reduce HbA1c levels in the Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Memory
in Diabetes Study (ACCORD-MIND) [25], while slower cog-
nitive decline was observed following an intervention at an
HbA1c level of 53.0 mmol/mol (7.0%) or less in the
Informatics in Diabetes Education and Telemedicine Study
(IDEATel) [26]. Additionally, no benefits for cognitive function
were reported by the Anglo–Danish–Dutch Study of Intensive
Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary
Care–Netherlands (ADDITION-Netherlands) in their compari-
son of the effectiveness of intensive multifactorial treatment (in-
cluding keeping HbA1c levels lower than 53.0 mmol/mol
[7.0%]) with routine care [27]. However, all the studies men-
tioned above emphasise the importance of early intervention to
prevent or delay diabetes onset. Modest cognitive function dec-
rements are already present during the early stage of diabetes
[28], and the effects of tight glycaemic control on those with
established diabetes are complicated and yet to be determined.
In addition, HbA1c levels were recently recommended to be
used in clinical practice in the UK, to assess diabetes and serve
as a biomarker for blood glucose management according to the
guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence [29]. This is consistent with our opinion that
HbA1c levels are important for the prevention and management
of diabetes. Given that HbA1c levels were not used in clinical
practice during the conduct of the present study, we also inves-
tigated whether fasting glucose levels and HbA1c levels pro-
duced different diabetes diagnoses. As shown in ESM Table 9,
HbA1c levels identified more diabetic participants than did
fasting glucose levels; the mismatch rate was approximately
1.4% in total. Therefore, the effect of mismatch between differ-
ent diagnosis standards on our results is likely to be minimal.
Notably, the observed linear correlation of HbA1c levels
with global cognitive decline was primarily driven by impair-
ments in the domains of memory and executive function,
which were assessed by immediate and delayed word recall
tests and a verbal fluency task, respectively. This may suggest
that cognitive decline related to high circulating glucose levels
could be specific to dysfunction of certain brain regions or
subcortical pathways involved in memory and executive func-
tion. Another possible explanation is that the orientation test,
with only four questions and a score ranging from 0 to 4, was
relatively insensitive to the small increments of cognitive de-
cline induced by high glucose levels. Nevertheless, it is still
worth mentioning that, although the observed associations
were statistically significant, the effect sizes were quite small.
While the precise mechanisms underlying the association
of diabetes with cognitive decline remain unclear, several po-
tential mechanisms have been proposed. Diabetes has been
implicated to be related to subsequent cognitive impairment
through both direct mechanisms (e.g. by inducing amyloid
accumulation) and indirect mechanisms (e.g. by increasing
microvascular disease of the central nervous system—be-
lieved to play a very important role in vascular dementia)
[8]. In addition, individuals with diabetes are at increased risk
of comorbidities such as depression, obesity, hypertension and
hyperlipidaemia, all of which could affect cognitive perfor-
mance [30]. However, only small attenuations of associations
were noted after adjustment for such factors, indicating that
diabetes is an independent and strong risk factor for cognitive
decline. A critical aspect of successful ageing is maintaining
cognitive function and ensuring a high quality of life. It has
been shown that even a modest decrease in cognitive function
could result in substantially greater cognitive decline over
several years [31]. As there is currently no cure for dementia,
early intervention on modifiable risk factors, such as diabetes,
may offer an important way to prevent cognitive decline.
Indeed, it has been established that intervention for treating
and addressing modifiable risk factors for dementia could pre-
vent up to a quarter of dementia cases [30].
A major strength of the present study is that it is one of the
largest general population-based studies exploring the rela-
tionship between HbA1c levels and cognition over a long-
term 10 year follow-up period. Another strength is that we
obtained repeated measures of cognitive function over the
follow-up period, providing a robust assessment of cognitive
deterioration and enabling us to capture the cumulative burden
and chronicity of estimates of long-term trajectories of cogni-
tive decline. Nevertheless, the present findings should be con-
sidered in the context of some potential limitations. First, the
extent to which we can infer a causal relationship between
HbA1c levels and cognitive decline is limited because of the
observational study design. It has been argued that even lon-
gitudinal designs cannot completely assuage this criticism.
However, our findings show that high HbA1c levels were
not independently related to poorer cognitive function at base-
line, but to a greater longitudinal cognitive decline, thus im-
plying that poor cognition is a corollary of high HbA1c levels,
but not vice versa. Second, our study lacked a clinical demen-
tia diagnosis during follow-up; therefore, we cannot analyse
the temporal relationship between HbA1c levels, diabetes and
incident dementia. Third, although we adjusted for many po-
tential confounding factors, there may be residual confound-
ing factors such as genetic susceptibility, including the APOE
genotype. Genetic data are not available for the ELSA and so
we cannot adjust for the APOE genotype; however, previous
studies indicated that there is no interaction with APOE status
and diabetes on cognitive decline [7, 8, 32]. Fourth, only
55.0% of participants who completed the wave 2 survey were
eligible for this study, which might have led to selection bias.
Non-response analyses show that the study sample was
healthier than the original ELSA population, which may affect
846

 the internal validity of estimates and limit generalisation to the
English population. Using only the responders might have
diluted the association between baseline diabetes and future
cognitive decline, because dropouts and non-responders had a
higher percentage of self-reported diabetes and might have
had an even faster cognitive decline compared with re-
sponders. Thus, a stronger association could be expected if
there had been full participation. Finally, cognitive function
was assessed using isolated tasks; a more elaborate neuropsy-
chological assessment may result in different associations.
In conclusion, our study provides evidence to support the
association of diabetes with subsequent cognitive decline.
Moreover, our findings show a linear correlation between cir-
culating HbA1c levels and cognitive decline, regardless of
diabetic status. Future studies are required to determine the
long-term effects of maintaining optimal glucose control on
cognitive decline in people with diabetes.
