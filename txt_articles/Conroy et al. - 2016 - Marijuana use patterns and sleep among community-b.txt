Abstract
Background—Marijuana (MJ) is the most commonly used recreational drug in the US. Research 
on the relationship between MJ and sleep is still in its infancy. The study examined the differences 
in sleep characteristics between a community sample of daily users, non-daily MJ users, and non-
users.
Methods—A total of 98 subjects (45M; 53 F) participated. The mean age was 22.3 (SD=3.0). 
There were 53 females and 55% of the sample was Caucasian. Recruitment was through online 
and via print advertisements in the community. Groups were categorized as non-daily users 
(n=29), daily users (n=49), and non-user controls (n=20). Sleep was characterized by the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
(ESS) and Morningness Scale (MEQ).
Results—A standard cut off score of >10 for the ISI was found in 38.8% of daily users, 10.3% of 
non-daily users, and 20% of non-users. PSQI scores in daily users (7.0 +/− 3.8) was higher than 
non-daily (4.9+/−3.2) and non-user controls (5.0+/− 3.7), p=0.02. ISI scores in daily users (7.9 +/
−6.1) were higher than non-daily (5.1 +/−4.3) and non-user controls (4.3+/−4.8), p=0.01. 
Covariate adjusted regression analyses revealed mean PSQI and ISI scores were significantly 
lower for non-daily users and controls relative to the daily users. When adjusting for depression 
and anxiety, these unique associations were not significant. There were no differences in ESS or 
MEQ.
Conclusion—Daily MJ users endorsed more sleep disturbance than non-daily users. Future 
studies should consider mood in the relationship between MJ use and sleep.

 INTRODUCTION
Marijuana (MJ) is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States. It is now well 
known that individuals report self-treating with MJ for a number of medical and psychiatric 
symptoms, most commonly PTSD, pain, anxiety, and insomnia1-3. The availability of MJ to 
treat these symptoms has been increasing, due in part to changes in laws related to MJ use. 
In the United States, MJ has been legalized in four states, decriminalized in 16 states, and 
there are now 23 states that have medical marijuana legalization. Many individuals using MJ 
medicinally or for recreational purposes use MJ for insomnia 2-4. This is despite the research 
suggesting that treatment seeking5 and non-treatment seeking 6 individuals report disturbed 
sleep when they stop using MJ and a only a small portion report a reduction of related 
symptoms as a primary benefit of use7.
MJ use and sleep in young adults
Marijuana use is most prevalent in the United States among 18-25 year olds with 
approximately 32% of non-college and 35% of college-attending persons reporting past year 
use, and 19% of emerging adults (18-29 years old) reporting past month marijuana use8. 
Young adults use MJ for recreational reasons, but some also use MJ for sleep difficulties 9. 
An estimated 7.3% of individuals aged 18-29 meet ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria for the 
diagnosis of insomnia10. In a community sample of over four thousand 18-25 year olds, 
29.3% scored above the clinical cut-off on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)11. 
Thus, about 30% of individuals in this age group complain of sleep disturbance, although 
only one-fourth of these meet formal diagnostic criteria. Insomnia has been associated with 
both self-reported impairments in daytime functioning 12 and lost productivity 13.
The biopsychosocial changes of young adulthood affecting sleep are well known 14 and may 
contribute to MJ use. As individuals begin to live more independently, there may be fewer 
restrictions on sleep schedules, particularly parent-set bedtimes. Many choose to stay awake 
later at night to socialize or to meet academic demands. Individuals with an evening 
“chronotype,” who prefer to be awake late into the evening, have been shown to have more 
problems with reward functioning (including sensation seeking and substance 
involvement)15. Evening chronotypes have also demonstrated higher depression scores 16, 
suicidal thoughts, more impaired work and other activities, higher paranoid symptoms, and 
higher anxiety, compared to a morningness-type group 17. Thus, the pattern of MJ use in 
young adults may be influenced by an interplay between changes in sleep patterns, 
chronotype, and mood.
To date, literature on the effects of marijuana on sleep a young adult sample have been 
somewhat limited. While objective sleep indices have been studied in middle aged Veterans 
who are heavy MJ users 18-21, only one study has examined objective indices of nocturnal 
sleep and daytime sleepiness the following day in a community sample of young adults. In 
that study, 8 healthy volunteers participated in a double-blind and placebo-controlled study 
with either: 1) 15 mg D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 2) 5 mg THC combined with 5 mg 
cannabidiol (CBD), 3) 15 mg THC combined with 15 mg CBD or 4) placebo 22 via 
oromucosal spray one hour before bedtime. THC in addition to CBD was used because of 
the different effects associated with each compound, i.e. CBD is not as centrally activating

 like THC and has useful therapeutic/anticonvulsant properties. Participants underwent 
polysomnography and then sleep and morning functioning were evaluated. Nighttime sleep 
slightly worsened with 15 mg CBD and next day performance was impaired (deficits in 
memory, reduced sleep latency, and mood changes) with 15 mg THC. This study highlights 
the effect of MJ on both nighttime sleep and daytime functioning.
If the relationship between MJ use and sleep disturbance in persons who are not seeking 
treatment for substance use disorders is substantial and documented to affect daytime 
function, it could have major public health significance. Health officials could publicize the 
relationship of MJ and sleep, primary care and behavioral health workers could highlight 
this information during office visits for insomnia, and drug treatment providers could 
meaningfully target sleep among MJ users who do seek treatment.
MJ use patterns and insomnia over time
Epidemiological studies have found associations between MJ use and insomnia over time 23. 
Adolescents, in particular, who used any illicit drug (most often MJ) were 2.6 times more 
likely to report a sleep problem than those who remained substance free 24. In a nationally 
representative sample, adolescents with insomnia were 1.8 times as likely to report MJ use 
compared to adolescents without insomnia25. Across ages, about one in five persons who 
use MJ (and no other illicit drugs) report insomnia (e.g., have trouble going to sleep or 
staying asleep most or all of the time). This is significantly higher than the rate of insomnia 
diagnosed in persons not using MJ 25 which is approximately one in ten.26 While these 
epidemiological studies are informative and suggest co-occurrence, they do not inform us 
regarding the relationship of level of MJ use to sleep effect, or as to common (i.e., a third 
factor causing both) versus reciprocal etiology.
Study aim
The majority of studies conducted on the influence of MJ on sleep have focused on heavy, 
chronic, and “problematic” users, and persons seeking substance use disorders treatment. 
The distinct effects of daily versus non-daily marijuana use on sleep remain unknown. 
Previous studies have also not considered insomnia severity with daytime effects in non-
daily users. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the effects of non-daily 
and daily MJ use patterns on sleep quality and patterns in young adults recruited from the 
community.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were co-recruited from a larger study on individuals who use alcohol and 
marijuana between March 2012 and September 2013 through on-line advertisements in 
Craig’s List, Facebook, flyers, word-of-mouth, radio advertisements, and newspaper 
advertisements targeted at the Rhode Island/southeastern Massachusetts area. These methods 
are free services, widely known and used, and easy to access from a computer or 
smartphone. The advertisement for this study read, “Adults between 18 and 29, do you use 
marijuana?” You may be eligible to participate in a research study,” and asked interested

 persons to call the study telephone number listed. Exclusion criteria were: 1) past month 
cocaine, opioid, benzodiazepine, barbiturate, inhalant, PCP, hallucinogen, or stimulant use, 
2) more than one episode of binge drinking (defined as 5 drinks within a 2-hour period for 
men, 4 drinks within a 2-hour period for women) in the past month. We permitted inclusion 
of one binge episode because of the small number of participants who had no episodes of 
binge drinking in the last month, 3) night shift work, 4) self-reported diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 5) lack of stable 
housing, 6) current (past 2 weeks) suicidal ideation, and 7) past month use of sleep 
medication or antidepressants. We also recruited an age-matched control group who reported 
no MJ use in the last month.
A total of 1307 persons aged 18-29 who reported using marijuana at least once a month 
were screened by phone for eligibility. Of these, 1052 were ineligible, due to more than one 
recent binge drinking episode. Other reasons for exclusion included use of other drugs (n = 
45), mental disorder diagnosis (n = 65), currently being treated for depression (n = 22), 
suicidal ideation (n = 27), and unstable housing (n = 5). Of the 146 eligible participants, 8 
could not be reached to schedule a baseline appointment, 4 refused participation, and 35 did 
not come in for their baseline appointment. Ninety-nine consented to participate in the 
study; one person was excluded from participation after consent due to non-compliance with 
study protocols and limited cooperation with study staff. This study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Boards of Butler Hospital and the University of Michigan.
Procedures
At baseline, eligible participants provided informed consent and received a 40-minute face-
to-face interview to assess demographics, and marijuana use. Participants also provided 
urine samples for toxicological analysis to rule out recent opioid, cocaine, amphetamine, or 
benzodiazepine use prior to this interview. The non-user control group was also required to 
have negative urine toxicology for THC at the time of the baseline interview.
Measures
Marijuana use
All participants were administered the patient version of the Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV (SCID)27 at baseline to assess for current marijuana dependence only in the last 
year. During the baseline interview, a Time Line Follow Back 28was conducted to assess for 
MJ use over the past 4 weeks. On each day of MJ use, participants were asked how many 
minutes they smoked MJ. Participants were provided with the following instructions: “We 
would like you to look on this calendar and let us know how much time you spent using 
marijuana each day so we can write that in. We are also interested in knowing what time 
each day you used marijuana.” The day was divided into 4 six-hour quadrants. Daily 
smokers were defined as persons smoking MJ at least six days per week, and non-daily 
smokers were persons who smoked on at least 1 day in the past month to up to 5 days per 
week. Non-users were participants who had not smoked MJ in the last month.

 The basis for using minutes of marijuana as an outcome was because it is very difficult to 
ascertain in the naturalistic setting exactly how much THC the participant is ingesting. To 
clarify this measure further, we made frequency of use in days (daily vs. non-daily use) and 
meeting a diagnosis of dependence as our secondary measures.
In looking at the validity of our chosen outcome measure, we did find support from 
concurrent measures of MJ use frequency. The spearman rank correlation between average 
minutes of MJ use during the two-week evaluation period and the percentage of days using 
MJ during that same period was r=0.88 (p<0.001). The median was 25.18 and inter-quartile 
range was 12.90-62.91. The correlation between average minutes of MJ use during the two-
week evaluation period and a baseline DSM-IV diagnosis of Cannabis Dependence was 
r=0.33 (p=0.10). Although not significant statistically, those with a diagnosis of Cannabis 
Dependence reported an average of 42 (SD= 32.8) as compared to an average of 24 (SD= 
34.4) among those without a diagnosis, a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d=0.53).
Sleep Disturbance Measures
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)29—The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses general sleep quality and sleep disturbances over 
a 1-month time period. Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: 
subjective sleep quality; sleep latency; sleep duration; habitual sleep efficiency; sleep 
disturbances; use of sleeping medication and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for 
these seven components yields one global score. A global PSQI score greater than 5 has 
been used to define sleep disturbance.29
Insomnia Severity Index30—The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a seven-item self-
report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in the past month. 
Dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning 
awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime 
functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep 
difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very 
severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. We used a cut off ≥10 because 
this score has been shown to be optimal (86.1% sensitivity and 87.7% specificity) for 
detecting insomnia cases in a community sample 31.
Epworth Sleepiness Scale32, 33—The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-item 
questionnaire assessing the level of daytime sleepiness. Respondents rate their likelihood to 
fall asleep or doze off on a scale of 0-3 (0=none, 1=slight chance, 2= moderate chance, 
3=high chance) in 8 different situations that may induce sleepiness (e.g., sitting and 
reading). A score of 10 or greater is considered problematic daytime sleepiness, with a score 
of 18 signifying severe daytime sleepiness.
The Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ)34—Smith’s MEQ is a 13-
item questionnaire that assesses individual time of day preference for morning or evening 
activities, such as bed- and rise-times, and the clock time of becoming fully awake. This 
questionnaire measures behavioral temporal preference with high reliability, validity, and

 cross-cultural utility 35. Scores range from 13-52. Scores ≤22 indicate an eveningness 
preference, 23-43 indicated intermediate (no preference for time of day), and scores ≥44 
indicate morningness.
Mood measures
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)36—The PHQ9 is a 9- item questionnaire that 
inquires about how often mood symptoms were bothersome to the participant in the past two 
weeks. Participants respond on a Likert scale between 0-3, with 0 = not at all, 1=several 
days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Total scores from 5-9 indicate mild 
symptoms of depression, 10-14 moderate symptoms, 15-19 moderately severe, and 20-27 
severe. PHQ9 is a reliable and well validated scale37, 38
The Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire39—To obtain information 
about anxiety, we used the brief 10-item PDSQ scale to measure generalized anxiety 
disorder. The PDSQ refers to the past 2 weeks. Participants responded to 10 questions about 
their anxiety (e.g., were you a nervous person on most days) with either no (0) or yes (1). 
Higher scores reflect more anxiety symptoms.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted analyses on the enrolled participants that provided baseline interview 
responses. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to explore whether MJ 
use group predicted scores on sleep, daytime sleepiness, and chronotype questionnaires. All 
models evaluating sleep measures across MJ use groups included planned covariates. Given 
that the high rate of unemployment in the sample (54%) may impact sleep behaviors and the 
possibility of gender differences in MJ use patterns, all models included gender and 
employment status as planned covariates. Because anxiety 40 and depression 19 are related to 
both marijuana use and sleep, we followed up our initial evaluations with models that 
controlled for these potential confounds in our analyses. All statistical analyses were 
completed using R statistical software (R Core Team, 2013).
RESULTS
Participants
A total of 98 participants (53 female, 45 male) completed the baseline interview (Please see 
Table 1). Participants were predominantly in their early 20s with a mean age of 22.3 
(SD=3.0). The distribution of males and females was approximately equal in each MJ use 
category. The sample was approximately half Caucasian, female, unemployed, and 27% 
reported at least a high school education (Table 1). None of these variables differed 
significantly between groups. Of the n=98 that were eligible to participate, one had one 
binge drinking episode in the past month. Daily users smoked MJ nearly four times longer 
(in minutes) than non-daily users on use days, and non-daily users smoked on average two 
days a week. Daily users typically used MJ across the day and night whereas non-daily users 
used primarily at night.

 Sleep measures by MJ Use Category
PSQI: Table 2 lists descriptive statistics for sleep disruption measures within each marijuana 
use group. Sleep disturbance (PSQI>5) 29 was evidenced by 55.1% of daily MJ users, 34.5% 
of non-daily users, and 45.0% of non-users. Higher PSQI scores were associated with being 
female (b=2.3, SE=0.70, p=0.001). In covariate adjusted regression analyses (see Table 3), 
mean PSQI scores were significantly lower for non-daily users (p=0.001) than for the daily 
MJ users. PSQI scores in the non-user group also were significantly lower than among daily-
users (p=0.04). When added after other terms, there was a significant influence of depression 
(p<0.001) and no influence from anxiety (p<0.09) on PSQI scores. When adjusting for 
depression and anxiety, the unique association between level of MJ use and PSQI was 
reduced when comparing the non-daily (p=0.16) and non-user groups (p=0.33) to daily MJ 
users. Please see Table 3.
ISI: The criterion for clinical insomnia (ISI≥10) was met in 38.8% of daily users, 10.3% of 
non-daily users, and 20.0% of non-users. In the covariate-adjusted regression model, higher 
ISI scores were associated with being female (b=2.4, SE=1.1, p=.03).
Across MJ use categories, when adjusting for gender and employment status (see Table 3), 
ISI scores in daily MJ users were higher than non-daily users (p=.03), and higher than non-
users (p=0.01). When added to the model described above, we observed a signifiant positive 
association between higher levels of depression (p<.001), and no association between higher 
anxiety (p=0.56) and higher ISI scores. After adjusting for depression and anxiety, the 
differences between non-daily (p=.25) or non-user groups (p=0.09) and daily users on the 
ISI were not significant.
ESS: Average sleepiness ratings by all MJ use groups were less than 10, indicating normal 
daytime sleepiness. There were no significant influences of gender and employment status 
on levels of ESS scores. We observed similar levels of ESS when comparing non-daily (p=.
65) and non-user groups (p=0.39) groups to daily MJ users (see Table 3). When added to the 
model, level of depression was significantly associated with ESS score (p<.001). Level of 
anxiety was not related to ESS (p=0.68).
MEQ: Overall, the cohort scored within the intermediate chronotype, that is, neither evening 
type nor morning type predominated. Gender, employment were not significantly associated 
with MEQ. We did not observe significant differences between non-daily (p=0.27) or non-
user groups (p=0.44) when compared to daily MJ users (see Table 3). When added to 
models, levels of depression (p=0.01) and not anxiety (p=0.13) were related to higher MEQ 
scores.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the association between non-daily and daily 
MJ use patterns on sleep patterns in young adults recruited from the community. Daily MJ 
users endorsed more sleep disturbance on the PSQI and ISI than non-daily users. These 
results are consistent with previous studies showing an association between sleep

 disturbance and heavy MJ use in adults 21, 24. Of note, however, was our finding that non-
daily MJ users and non-users had similar sleep indices. Daytime sleepiness and chronotype 
did not differ across our three groups. This study provides new information about the 
relationship between MJ use patterns, mood, sleep, and daytime functioning.
We found that the proportion of persons reporting a clinically significant PSQI threshold of 
>5, which distinguishes good from poor sleepers 29, was lowest among non-daily users and 
highest among the daily users (who also had a significantly higher mean PSQI). We also 
found that these non-daily users tended to use MJ mostly at nighttime, whereas daily users 
smoked considerably more MJ on use days and used during the day and the evening.
The effects of MJ on sleep in intermittent users may be similar, in part, to that of alcohol 41 
where improvements in sleep continuity measures (e.g., decreased sleep onset latency and 
wake after sleep onset) have been reported with intermittent use, whereas daily use results in 
the worsening of sleep. However, methodological differences in previous marijuana studies 
limit definitive support. While a review of 39 research studies on the effects of cannabis on 
sleep revealed that cannabis may interrupt sleep patterns and result in non-restorative 
sleep42, objective polysomnography in heavy MJ users show normal (on average) sleep 
patterns during periods of cannabis use 21, 43. One possible explanation for the study 
findings is that individuals habituate to the sleep inducing effects of cannabis after continued 
use 44. In addition, our finding that non-users had similar ISI scores to non-daily users, and 
that a lower proportion reached clinical criteria for insomnia, suggests that sleep disturbance, 
which is common in this age group, may not be increased by non-daily MJ use. Because this 
is not a MJ administration trial, this remains speculative. The clinical significance of the 
lower ISI score in non-daily users is likely minimal, as all scores <10 typically reflect sub 
threshold insomnia.
Our findings suggest that anxiety is significantly related to scores on the PSQI. Persons with 
anxiety may be using MJ to mitigate their sleep symptoms. This is consistent with the 
literature, where MJ is the most commonly used illicit substance in individuals with anxiety 
disorders 40 and where higher MJ use has been associated with higher rates of anxiety 45. 
Lev Ran et al. (2012) found that when adjusting for any concurrent mood disorder, there was 
a significant impact of regular, but not occasional, use of cannabis on mental health-related 
quality of life in participants with anxiety disorders 46. It remains possible that our ISI scores 
might have been higher in the daily MJ users because MJ was contributing to anxiety, which 
in turn may have exacerbated the severity of insomnia.
We found gender effects on our PSQI and ISI scores, but not on ESS or MEQ scores. The 
relationship between insomnia and gender was expected 47, 48 as insomnia is more common 
in females than in males in non-substance using populations49. Lev-Ran et al. (2012) found 
that compared to non-users, occasional MJ users (defined as less than weekly use) had 
poorer mental health scores in females, but not among males. These findings suggest that MJ 
use patterns may affect females differently given their increased risk of both insomnia and 
depression. MJ has been shown to affect women more significantly than men on 
neuropsychological tasks 50.

 We expected that there would be more evening chronotypes in the daily MJ use category, 
because evening chronotypes have been shown to be more likely to use alcohol, to have poor 
impulse control, depression, and difficulty falling asleep 51. However, our MEQ results did 
not differ between non-users, non-daily and, or daily users. This finding is consistent with 
results of one study which utilized the Horne Ostberg questionnaire to assess chronotype in 
MJ users and reported that there were no chronotype differences between heavy MJ users 
and non-users21. Our study is among others to examine chronotype among persons who are 
primarily MJ users where the influence of concurrent heavy alcohol use has been 
mitigated21, 52, 53. While the relationship between chronotype and substance use is likely 
multifactorial, future studies might consider exploring whether evening chronotypes may be 
more likely to use alcohol or MJ.
Our study had several limitations. First, daily MJ users in this study were heavy users, 
therefore, we are unable to know if the sleep reports of daily users are a result of frequency 
of use or quantity of use. Future studies might try to recruit daily MJ users who smoke 
minimally, perhaps only at night to “treat” sleep disturbance. Second, participants self-
reported MJ use and sleep indices. Third, given the cross-sectional nature of this study, we 
are unable to assess causality. Fourth, the size of our sample increases the risk of Type 1 
error, missing associations that might have been seen in a larger study. Fifth, the absence of 
significant difference between the non-user and user groups may have been due to low 
power, as the non-user group had a lower number than user groups. Sixth, we did not 
quantify the use patterns beyond the past month. Therefore there may have been users in our 
non-user groups that could have quit more than one month ago. Seventh, the sample may not 
be representative of this population for two reasons. Even though we recruited MJ users and 
non-user controls from a larger study on alcohol and marijuana, our exclusion criteria may 
have been too limiting. In addition, given the high rate of unemployment and low rate of 
high school graduates in our study sample, this study sample may not be representative of 
this demographic. Eighth, the non-using control sample in this study was recruited from a 
larger study, which may have affected statistical assumptions for comparing the MJ user 
group with the HC group. Lastly, a formal diagnosis of insomnia was not conducted in this 
study and therefore associations with insomnia based on the ISI should be interpreted 
cautiously.
With the increasing availability of MJ and an increasing number of individuals using it for 
insomnia with the belief that MJ use improves sleep, our study suggests that daily use may 
not in fact improve sleep, although this study cannot est. Large scale studies assessing the 
impact of MJ on sleep are warranted.
