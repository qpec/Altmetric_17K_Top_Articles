Racial Disparities in Preventable Risk Factors for Head
and Neck Cancer
Sunshine Dwojak, MD, MPH; Neil Bhattacharyya, MD
Objectives/Hypothesis: To demonstrate racial differences in preventable risk behaviors/practices that contribute to
head and neck cancer (HNCA).
Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of large national risk factor survey.
Methods: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 2013 was analyzed. Demographic data were extracted,
including age, sex, and race. Social habits considered risk factors for HNCA were also extracted, including alcohol consump-
tion, smoking, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status. Statistical comparisons were conducted according to race
for each risk factor, and additional comparisons were conducted within the American Indian population subgroup for risk fac-
tors according to sex.
Results: A total of 238.6 million Americans were surveyed. American Indians reported higher rates of binge drinking
(19.0%) than whites (17.3%), blacks (12.4%), and Asian Americans (13.1%; P < .001). This rate was significantly higher for
American Indian males (23.5%) versus females (13.7%; P < .001). Mean total drinks per month was higher for whites and
American Indians (13.5 and 13.5; P < .001). American Indians reported the highest rates of current smoking (28.1%), fol-
lowed by blacks (20.1%), whites (18.3%), and Asians (10.2%; P < .001). American Indians also reported the highest rates of
every day smoking (18.2%), versus whites (13.3%), blacks (13.1%), and Asians (6.1%; P < .001). Rates of HPV vaccination
were lowest for American Indians (11.7%), compared to whites (14.6%), blacks (13.6%), and Asians (12%; P 5 0.618).
Conclusions: There are striking racial disparities in the prevalence of preventable risk factors for HNCA. These data
highlight the need for targeted education and prevention programs in particular racial groups.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck cancer (HNCA) comprises squamous
cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypophar-
ynx, and larynx and was predicted to affect approxi-
mately 59,340 people in the United States by 2015.1 The
annual cost of HNCA is approximately $4.2 billion and
is comparable to more common cancers such as lung and
colon cancer.2 There are known racial disparities in both
the incidence and outcomes for patients who develop
HNCA. African Americans in the United States are
more likely to present with late stage disease and to
have worse survival.3–5
Similarly, American Indians
with HNCA are more likely to present with late stage
disease, less likely to receive surgery for cancer of the
oral cavity, and more likely to die from their disease
than their white counterparts in the United States.6,7
One component of these cancer disparities that is
not well studied is the differential exposures to risk fac-
tors for HNCA. The most common risk factors for HNCA
include
alcohol
and
tobacco
use.
There
is
a
dose-
dependent relationship between tobacco and HNCA; the
addition of alcohol synergistically increases the risk of
cancer. Over the past 10 years, human papillomavirus
(HPV) has been identified as a causative risk factor for
HNCA, responsible for approximately 80% of oropharyn-
geal cancer. The prevalence of HPV-related HNCAs is
increasing in the United States as smoking-related can-
cers decline throughout the country.8
In this paper, we sought to understand disparities in
HNCA in the context of additional risk factor burden. One
of the best and most cited methods for assessing health-
related risk behaviors of US residents is tracking via the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an
annual, nationwide telephone survey conducted by the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).9 We
used the BRFSS to identify differences in the prevalence
of preventable risk factors for HNCA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The BRFSS for calendar year 2013 as administered by the
CDC served as the data source for this study. This study was
reviewed by our hospital’s committee on clinical investigations
and was deemed exempt from review as a deidentified, publicly
available data set investigation. BRFSS is the nation’s premier

 system of systematic health-related telephone surveys that col-
lects annual state-level data about US residents regarding their
self-reported health-related risk behaviors, chronic health condi-
tions, and use of preventive services. Data obtained are all
by self-report; information from insurance claims, primary care
providers records, et cetera are not included. BRFSS collects
data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and
three US territories.9 The BRFSS completes >400,000 adult
interviews each year, making it the largest continuously con-
ducted health survey system in the world. Data within the
BRFSS have been subjected to quality, validity, and reliability
studies and, in most instances, have been found to be relatively
consistent with household-based and in-person epidemiologic
studies of risk factors and health conditions.10–12 We have
previously used this survey data set for other otolaryngologic
analyses.13
The 2013 BRFSS was imported into SPSS version 22.0
(IBM, Armonk, NY) for data analysis. From the survey data,
standard demographic data were determined, including respon-
dent age, sex, and race. Race was determined as white only,
black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native,
Asian only, and “other.” The following social habits and varia-
bles generally considered as risk factors for HNCA were also
extracted from the survey: alcohol consumption (binge drinking,
heavy alcohol consumption, and number of alcoholic drinks con-
sumed per month), smoking and smokeless tobacco use, and
HPV vaccination status. Binge drinking was defined within
the survey as five or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion for
males and four or more drinks on one occasion for females. A
heavy alcohol consumption designation was applied to adult
men with more than two drinks per day and adult women with
more than one drink per day, consistently. Smoking status was
determined as currently smoking (yes or no) as well as quanti-
fied further into every day, some days, former smoker, or never
smoked. Smokeless tobacco use was quantified as every day,
some days, or not at all.
Univariate comparisons were conducted according to race
for each of the HNCA risk factor variables noted above. Statisti-
cal testing was done with v2 test with statistical significance set
at P 5 .05. Statistical methods that incorporate stratification
and weighting according to the survey design of the BRFSS
were incorporated. Additional testing was done within the
American Indian population subgroup to look at differences in
risk factor behaviors according to sex. Data are presented as
the population mean 6 standard error, where appropriate.
RESULTS
Demographics
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the 238.6 million
American surveyed, reflecting a nationally representa-
tive sample of US residents.
Alcohol Use
American Indians reported the highest rates of
binge drinking (19.0%; P < .001). The rates of heavy
alcohol consumption were highest among whites (6.5%)
and American Indians (5.7%; P � .001). Mean total
drinks per month were higher for whites and American
Indians (13.5 and 13.5; P < .001; Table I).
When breaking down alcohol use among American
Indians/Alaska Natives by sex, the rate of binge drinking
was significantly higher for American Indian males (23.5%)
versus females (13.7%; P < .001). The rate of heavy alcohol
use was also significantly higher for American Indian males
(7.3%) versus females (3.9%; P < .001).
Smoking
American Indians reported the highest rates of
current smoking (28.1%) and every day smoking (18.2%;
P < .001). American Indians and African Americans
have the highest rates of smoking on “some days” (9.9%)
and (7.1%; P < .001; Table II). There was no significant
difference in the reported rates of smoking between male
and female American Indian/Alaska Natives (P 5 .10).

 Smokeless Tobacco
American Indians and whites have the highest
rates of every day use of smokeless tobacco (2.3% and
2.3%; P < .001). American Indians also have the highest
rates of occasional use of smokeless tobacco (2.5%; P <
.001; Table II).
HPV Vaccination
American Indians have the lowest rates of HPV
vaccination (11.7%), followed by Asians (12%), African
Americans (13.6%), and whites (14.6%; P 5 .618). How-
ever, these rates did not reach statistical significance
(Table III).
DISCUSSION
Cancer rates throughout the United States have
been declining for the past 2 decades in large part due
to the reduction in cancer risk factors. These gains have
been made preferentially in the majority population, and
in parts of the country that are more affluent and edu-
cated.1 It is disheartening to see that there are still
significant
discrepancies
in
the
prevalence
rates
of
important and preventable risk factors for HNCA.
Our study shows that whites and American Indians
have the highest rates of alcohol use and abuse. Our
data are consistent with other reports from the BRFSS
showing higher use of alcohol among whites and Ameri-
can Indians.14 Data show that cessation of drinking
results in an average of 2% lower risk per year of HNCA
compared with current drinkers and that after 5 years
of
abstinence,
the
alcohol-related
risk
of
HNCA
decreases by 15%.15 Current evidence-based treatments
for alcohol use combine motivational interviewing and
psychotherapy with pharmacological treatments.16 Stud-
ies show that there is resistance to these standard treat-
ments within American Indian communities. The lack of
spiritual and cultural adaptation has been cited as a rea-
son for their widespread lack of acceptance. Pairing cur-
rent evidence-based treatment with traditional cultural
practices is happening in both rural and urban areas.17,18
In addition, there are ongoing studies to improve access
to treatment via online models tailored for American Indi-
ans.19 Current studies of these programs are underway to
determine their cost and overall effectiveness.20
Our data also show that American Indians and
African Americans are at higher risk for HNCA based
on their high rates of smoking. These data confirm pre-
vious reports from the BRFSS linked to the Indian

Dwojak and Bhattacharyya: Disparities in Risk Factors for HNCA
3
 Health Service Data as well as data from the surgeon
general.14,21 In addition to causing cancer, continued cig-
arette smoking portends a worse prognosis for HNCA,
decreases response to treatment, and increases the risk
of recurrence.21 There is significant research showing
that tobacco companies have targeted marketing to low-
er income and primarily minority neighborhoods.22 In
addition, social determinants of health including finan-
cial strain have been shown to increase the risk of smok-
ing.23 American Indians and African Americans face
multiple challenges that make them vulnerable to smok-
ing. Approaches to reduce the rates of smoking in these
communities need to take these additional factors into
account.
There are many methods that have been shown to
be successful in helping patients quit smoking. Identify-
ing smokers during a hospitalization and then providing
them with smoking cessation counseling and nicotine
replacement has been shown to yield long-term quit
rates of 30% to 70%.24 These types of hospital-based pro-
grams have been shown to be equally effective for Afri-
can American patients.25 Targeted interventions geared
toward minority communities are just starting. They are
feasible and have shown good short-term quit rates, but
larger and longer studies are needed.26,27 One of the
most effective ways to address smoking is through physi-
cian screening. Approximately 70% of smokers see a
physician every year. Simply asking questions about
smoking, prescribing nicotine replacement, and setting
up a follow-up appointment can help patients achieve
long-term smoking cessation.28
Finally, our data show that minorities in the United
States may be at a higher rate of exposure to HPV-
related cancers as a result of low immunization rates.
HPV is responsible for approximately 80% of oropharyn-
geal cancers within the United States, with 60% of these
cancers resulting from vaccine subtypes 16–18. In addi-
tion, approximately 20% of nonoropharyngeal HNCA is
related to HPV.8,29 The rates of HPV-related oropharyn-
geal cancer appear to be similar among American Indi-
ans, but lower in African Americans.7,29 Due to the
significant latency between infection and presentation, it
has not yet been possible to study the impact of vaccina-
tion on rates of HNCA. However, the HPV vaccine is
90% to 100% effective against precancerous infection,
suggesting that the vaccine should be able to prevent all
cancers related to HPV 16 and 18. Data on adolescent
vaccine rates show that minority populations are more
likely to initiate vaccination, but are less likely to com-
plete the vaccine series. Factors influencing the decision
to vaccinate include access to primary care, health care
provider
recommendation,
and
parental
knowledge
about the vaccine.30 Short educational sessions on HPV
and HPV-related disease have been shown to increase
willingness to vaccinate in diverse environments.31 Tar-
geted education efforts directed at both American Indian
and
African
American
communities
are
needed
to
increase vaccination initiation and completion rates.
This study must be interpreted in light of some lim-
itations. First, this is a national survey that reports
aggregate data from the United States. There are known
geographic
differences
in
demographics
and
behavior
among minority populations in the United States. For
example,
American
Indians
in
the
Southwest
have
much lower smoking rates than those in the Northern
Plains.13 Second, the BRFSS is a self-reported telephone
survey. Studies show that surveys via landlines exclude
people with lower socioeconomic status who are more like-
ly to smoke. Cellular data has been added to the BRFSS
since 2011. In addition, people in self-reported phone sur-
veys have a known bias to underreport negative behav-
iors.32 Finally, the BRFSS surveys adults over the age of
18 years. The HPV vaccine was recommended in 2007 for
girls aged 11 to 12 years and recommended for boys in
2011. The published rates of vaccination among adoles-
cents are approximately 50% for girls and 30% for boys.29
Assuming a maintained vaccination rate, it is expected
that vaccination rates reported in future BRFSS surveys
will increase as the population ages and today’s youth
become a larger percentage of the adult population.
CONCLUSION
Our study shows that there are disparities in pre-
ventable risk factors for HNCA.
American Indians and African Americans have dis-
proportionately higher rates of smoking and alcohol use
and lower rates of HPV vaccination. To combat racial
disparities in the incidence and outcomes of HNCA, we
must advocate for and implement evidence-based strate-
gies to address these inequalities.
