Preterm infants are at risk for a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral disabilities associated with diffuse disturbances in cortical growth
and development. During brain development, subplate neurons (SPNs) are a largely transient population that serves a critical role to
establish functional cortical circuits. By dynamically integrating into developing cortical circuits, they assist in consolidation of intra-
cortical and extracortical circuits. Although SPNs reside in close proximity to cerebral white matter, which is particularly vulnerable to
oxidative stress, the susceptibility of SPNs remains controversial. We determined SPN responses to two common insults to the preterm
brain: hypoxia-ischemia and hypoxia. We used a preterm fetal sheep model using both sexes that reproduces the spectrum of human
cerebral injury and abnormal cortical growth. Unlike oligodendrocyte progenitors, SPNs displayed pronounced resistance to early or
delayedcelldeathfromhypoxiaorhypoxia-ischemia.Wethusexploredanalternativehypothesisthattheseinsultsalterthematurational
trajectory of SPNs. We used DiOlistic labeling to visualize the dendrites of SPNs selectively labeled for complexin-3. SPNs displayed
reduced basal dendritic arbor complexity that was accompanied by chronic disturbances in SPN excitability and synaptic activity. SPN
dysmaturation was significantly associated with the level of fetal hypoxemia and metabolic stress. Hence, despite the resistance of SPNs
to insults that trigger white matter injury, transient hypoxemia disrupted SPN arborization and functional maturation during a critical
window in cortical development. Strategies directed at limiting the duration or severity of hypoxemia during brain development may
mitigate disturbances in cerebral growth and maturation related to SPN dysmaturation.

Introduction
During human development, the preterm brain commonly sus-
tains antenatal, perinatal, or postnatal disturbances in cerebral
blood flow and metabolism. In 25%–50% of survivors of preterm
birth, these insults contribute to a broad spectrum of unexplained
neurological disabilities in motor control, vision, language, cogni-
tion, attention, learning, and social development (Vohr, 2014).
These behavioral abnormalities coincide with significant impair-
ment in cortical growth and connectivity defined by volumetric

Significance Statement
The human preterm brain commonly sustains blood flow and oxygenation disturbances that impair cerebral cortex growth and
cause life-long cognitive and learning disabilities. We investigated the fate of subplate neurons (SPNs), which are a master
regulator of brain development that plays critical roles in establishing cortical connections to other brain regions. We used a

 MRI studies (Ball et al., 2013; Vinall et al., 2013). With the excep-
tion of more severe cerebral injury (Ligam et al., 2009; Andiman
et al., 2010; Kinney et al., 2012), most cortical volume loss appears
unrelated to significant cortical oxidative damage or neuronal
degeneration (Back et al., 2005; Dean et al., 2013; Back and Miller,
2014). Given that subplate neurons (SPNs) mature when the pre-
term cerebrum displays peak vulnerability (Volpe, 2009), insults
to SPNs were proposed to contribute to aberrant cortical growth
and connectivity (Volpe, 1996). SPNs are a largely transient and
unique neuronal population just below cortical layer 6 (Kostovic
and Rakic, 1990; Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., 2013) that dynam-
ically integrate into developing cortical circuits to promote
consolidation of functional intracortical and extracortical con-
nectivity. SPNs generate the first axons of the corticothalamic
tract (McConnell et al., 1989). These projections provide a scaf-
fold for thalamic inputs to directly innervate cortical layer 4
(Kanold and Luhmann, 2010; Viswanathan et al., 2012). Most
SPNs later undergo programmed cell death (Chun and Shatz,
1989; Torres-Reveron and Friedlander, 2007), which leaves a
monosynaptic thalamocortical projection to layer 4.
Because ablation of SPNs disrupts the entry or patterning of
corticothalamic projections (Ghosh et al., 1990; Kanold et al.,
2003), hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was proposed to similarly trigger
SPN degeneration to disrupt formation of thalamocortical affer-
ents. After HI, neonatal rat SPNs selectively degenerated unlike
other neuronal populations (McQuillen et al., 2003). However,
analysis of preterm human autopsy brains found no significant
loss of the total SPN population (Kinney et al., 2012). Recently,
three different SPN-specific markers were used to quantify SPN
vulnerability to HI in the neonatal rat. SPN degeneration was
only observed in association with more severe cortical neuronal
loss (Okusa et al., 2014).
Because these disparate results leave unresolved the role of
SPNs in preterm brain injury, we used an instrumented preterm
fetal sheep model of in utero global cerebral HI that closely repli-
cates in a gyrencephalic brain both human cortical maturation
and the spectrum of antenatal and postnatal preterm cerebral
injury (Back et al., 2012; Back, 2014). We uniquely defined the
dendritic arbor of preterm SPNs through DiOlistic labeling in
combination with immunolabeling for complexin 3 (Cplx3), a
selective SPN marker (Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molna
´r, 2013).
We analyzed SPN responses to hypoxia (Hx) and HI. Whereas
SPNs were strikingly resistant to degeneration from either insult,
they displayed persistent disturbances in dendritic arbor matura-
tion that were significantly related to the severity of the hypoxic
insult. Dysmaturation of SPNs was accompanied by chronically
increased SPN synaptic activity and a highly correlated reduced
electrical excitability. Hence, aberrant SPN maturation appears
to contribute to disturbances in preterm cortical growth and con-
nectivity during a critical window in the evolution of cortical
circuitry.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. All experiments performed on animals adhere to strict
protocols approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Instrumented fetal sheep surgery. Sterile surgeries on time-bred preg-
nant ewes were performed between 88 and 92 d gestational age (dGA;
term 145 dGA) at Oregon Health and Science University as previously
described (Hagen et al., 2014). Briefly, a midline laparotomy and hyster-
otomy were used in a sterile field to access each of the twin fetuses. A vinyl
catheter was placed nonocclusively in a carotid, brachial, or femoral
artery, and an inflatable Silastic occluder was placed around the brachio-
cephalic artery to control blood flow to the brain through the common
carotid and vertebral arteries. In the sheep, all collateral circulation to the
brain, except the spinal arteries, is provided through branches of the
brachiocephalic artery. An additional catheter was sewn to the fetal skin
to allow monitoring of the fetal amniotic fluid pressure. Following sur-
gical instrumentation, the fetus was returned to the uterus, the maternal
incision was closed, and the ewe was allowed to recover from surgery for
3 d after which HI studies were conducted (see Fig. 1A). Fetuses of either
sex were included in the study (n � 10 female, n � 12 male).
Cerebral HI studies and physiological monitoring. Maternal Hx was in-
duced by supplying the pregnant ewe with a mixture of 50% room air and
50% nitrogen gas for an inhaled oxygen fraction of 10.5%. Following
5 min of maternal Hx, cerebral ischemia was initiated in one of the twin
fetuses (designated HI fetus) and maintained by inflating the brachioce-
phalic occluder for 25 min. Four arterial blood gas (ABG) samples were
collected from each fetus throughout experimentation: pre-Hx (baseline
or pre-ABG), at 5 min after initiation of maternal Hx (Hx ABG), 25 min
after initiation of ischemia-induction (HI or HI ABG), and 10 min after
cessation of ischemia (recovery or post-ABG). Blood samples were ana-
lyzed using an ABL800 flex blood gas analyzer (Radiometer Medical, A/S
RRID:SCR_014772). If the fetal arterial oxygen concentration (ctO2) fell
�5.0 vol% after a 5 min exposure to maternal Hx, the maternal inhaled
oxygen fraction was enriched to 14% for the duration of the experiment.
Fetuses exposed exclusively to maternal Hx were designated hypoxic
controls (Hx), whereas fetuses exposed to maternal Hx in combination
with cerebral hypoperfusion were designated HI animals (see Fig. 1A).
Each experimental twin pregnancy was comprised of a Hx and HI pair.
Tissue collection and processing. To ensure the viability of the fetal
brains for concurrent electrophysiological studies, the ewe was placed
under general anesthesia and ventilated. After fetal harvest, ewes were
then killed with a 12 ml intravenous bolus of a pentobarbital sodium and
phenytoin sodium solution (Euthasol NAC# 10230760, Virbac). Fetal
brains were harvested either 24 h (Hx, n � 5; HI, n � 4) or 4 weeks (Hx,
n � 8; HI, n � 8) after exposure to maternal Hx and HI. Separate groups
of appropriately age-matched normal twin fetuses were harvested to
serve as true controls (TC: 4 weeks/120 dGA, n � 7; 24 h/95 dGA, n � 3)
to the Hx and HI experimental groups. Fetal brains were removed from
the cranial vault, and the cerebellum and brainstem were removed by
cutting the cerebral peduncles at the pontopeduncular junction. The
remaining cerebrum and diencephalon was then divided into anteropos-
terior pieces with a single coronal cut at the rostral end of the ectomar-
ginal sulcus, caudal to the ansate (cruciate) sulcus. Next, the anterior and
posterior blocks were hemisected by a single sagittal cut through the
midline. The frontal block (anterior to section 0640 in the Michigan State
University online sheep brain atlas: https://msu.edu/~brains/brains/
sheep/index.html) of one hemisphere (specifically, the ansate (cruciate)
gyrus containing the primary motor cortex) (Simpson and King, 1911;
Vanderwolf and Cooley, 1990) was used for the cortical subplate (SP)
electrophysiological studies reported on in this paper, whereas corre-
sponding regions of the frontal block, including primary motor and
somatosensory cortical areas (Dinopoulos et al., 1985) of the opposite
hemisphere, were used for the SP morphometric studies. The hemi-
sphere destined for morphometric studies was subdivided into two
equivalent coronal blocks (labeled A and B, where A is most anterior),
and immersed in 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 4°C).
Subsequent tissue processing of the B-block (level of frontal periven-
tricular white matter (WM), and the head of the caudate nucleus) varied
according to individual studies. This block has been analyzed extensively
by us in prior studies (Riddle et al., 2006; Riddle et al., 2011) because of
the predilection for cerebral WM injury at this level both in our fetal
sheep preparations and in human preterm infants.
Fetal brains used for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) area frac-
tion and Cplx3/1-1�-dioctadecyl-3,3,3�,3�-tetramethylindocarbocyanine
perchlorate (DiI) studies were collected 4 weeks after exposure to mater-
nal Hx and/or HI at �119–123 dGA. B-blocks were removed from fixa-
tive 3 h after immersion and were cut into 200 �m coronal slices using a
vibrating microtome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems). The brain slices
were stored in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide at 4°C until use. Sections
were collected at equivalent intervals across the B-block to ensure sys-
tematic sampling across the entire block.

 Fetal brains used for activated caspase-3 (AC3)/T-Box, Brain,1 (Tbr1)
counts were collected both 24 h (TC, n � 3; Hx, n � 5; HI, n � 4) and 4
weeks (TC, n � 7; Hx, n � 3; HI, n � 6) after HI. Fetal brains were also
examined for the presence of inflammation 24 h after HI using GFAP and
Iba1 antisera (TC, Hx, and HI, n � 3 animals/treatment group). B-blocks
were sectioned at 50 �m using a vibrating microtome and stored until
further use at �20°C in cryoprotectant (30% v/v ethylene chloride, 15%
m/v sucrose, 0.3 M PO4).
Immunohistochemical studies. Antigen retrieval (Tris-EDTA with
0.05% Tween 20 at pH 9.0 for 10 min) and Triton X-100 (0.1% in 55 mM
PBS, for all staining steps) were used in all immunohistochemical studies
to facilitate antibody penetration of tissue, except when double-staining
with DiI was necessary. AC3 (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy, catalog #9662, RRID:AB_331439, 1:500) and Tbr1 (chicken poly-
clonal, Millipore, catalog #AB2261, RRID:AB_10615497; 1:100) primary
antisera were visualized with rhodamine Red-X-conjugated secondary
antibodies against rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, cata-
log #111-295-045, RRID:AB_2338025; 1:200) or chicken (Invitrogen,
catalog #A-11041, RRID:AB_2534098; 1:100), respectively, and counter-
stained with the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, catalog
#H3570). Cplx3 primary antibody (rabbit IgG, Synaptic Systems, catalog
#122 302, RRID:AB_2281240, 1:1000) was visualized with either a FITC-
conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit (Jackson ImmunoRe-
search Laboratories, 1:200), or a biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog #111-065-045,
RRID:AB_2337962, 1:200) and FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Im-
munoResearch Laboratories, catalog #016-010-084, RRID:AB_2337236,
1:200), and a Hoechst counterstain. A rabbit polyclonal antisera against
GFAP (Dako, catalog #Z0334, RRID:AB_10013382, 1:500) and a rabbit
polyclonal antisera against the Iba1 calcium binding protein expressed in
microglia/macrophages (Iba1; Wako Chemicals, catalog #019-19741,
RRID:AB_2665520, 1:500) were visualized with a biotin-conjugated
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,
catalog #111-065-045, RRID:AB_2337962, 1:200) and FITC-conjugated
streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog #016-010-
084, RRID:AB_2337236, 1:200). The mouse monoclonal O4 used to vi-
sualize oligodendrocytes was a gift from Dr. Steven E. Pfeiffer (University
of Connecticut Medical School, Farmington, CT), and its purification
and visualization have been described previously (Bansal et al., 1989;
Back et al., 2001). Antigen retrieval and detergents were not used in DiI
studies to maintain cell membrane integrity. To improve antibody pen-
etration, both primary (Cplx3) and secondary (biotinylated anti-rabbit)
antibody incubations steps were extended to 6 d and conducted in PBS
with 0.05% sodium azide at 4°C to avoid tissue degradation. Tertiary
incubations (FITC-streptavidin) were conducted overnight at 4°C in
PBS. Overnight washes were conducted after primary and secondary
antibody incubation steps.
DiI bullet preparation. DiI bullets were prepared as described in a JoVE
tutorial (Seabold et al., 2010).
DiI delivery. DiI was delivered to neurons by shooting DiI-covered
tungsten bullets into Cplx3-stained tissue slices using a Helios Gene Gun
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, catalog #165-2431 and #165-2432). Air
pressure was set to 180 psi for optimum DiI penetration of the tissue. Fol-
lowing DiI delivery, tissue sections were washed in PBS for 30 min and
mounted for imaging using Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium (Vec-
tor Laboratories, catalog #H-1000, RRID:AB_2336789). Sections were im-
aged within 24 h to avoid DiI diffusion out of labeled cellular membranes.
SP cell death imaging and analysis. Image montages for Tbr1 and AC3
staining were collected using a Confocal Microscope A1 system (Nikon).
All images were collected using a 20� air lens (PLAN APO, Nikon, NA �
0.8) with consistent acquisition settings maintained between samples
(pinhole � 57.6 �m, 2� optical zoom, 1024 � 1024 pixel resolution per
tile, 2� averaging); 405 nm and 561 nm excitation used a solid state laser
source, whereas 488 nm emission used a variable argon/krypton laser set
to emit at 488 nm.
Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen to include the periventricular
WM and SP. Confocal images in the Nikon *.nd2 format were opened
using FIJI RRID:SCR_002285 (Schindelin et al., 2012), and Tbr1 and
Hoechst staining was used in combination to define the lower boundary
of the cortical mantle and the boundary between the SP and periven-
tricular WM (see Fig. 1B), which were outlined using FIJI’s ROI tool. A
grid was overlaid on the image to assist in counting, and the cell-counter
plugin of FIJI was used to note the presence of apoptotic, pyknotic, and
Tbr1 � cells in each ROI.
GFAP area fraction analysis. At 4 weeks after HI, WM injury was as-
sessed in 7 brains/treatment group by imaging GFAP staining using a
systematic random sampling approach with StereoInvestigator software
(MicroBrightfield RRID:SCR_004314) on an upright fluorescent micro-
scope (Zeiss AxioImager M2). Systematic random sampling image series
were acquired at 20� air lens (Zeiss EC Plan-NeoFluar, NA � 0.5), with
image distribution such that �25% of the WM from each section was
imaged. Quantification of the GFAP area fraction for each image was
performed as described previously (Hagen et al., 2014).
Stereological quantification of GFAP cell densities. The density of
GFAP-labeled cell somas 4 weeks after HI was estimated using the
StereoInvestigator optical fractionator probe (version 2017.01.1,
MBF Bioscience, RRID:SCR_004314) on a Zeiss Imager M2 upright
microscope. Contours for the WM ROIs were drawn as previously
described (Riddle et al., 2006). A digital sampling grid containing at
least 50 sampling sites overlaid the entire ROI. Cells were counted
using an APO chrom-AT 63�/1.40 NA oil objective within an 85 � 85
�m counting frame. The distance from the top of the section to the
unbiased virtual counting zone was fixed at 3 �m (guard zone), and
the height of the unbiased virtual counting zone (optical dissector)
was set at 30 �m. The thickness of the section was measured at every
sample site. Density and coefficients of error were calculated as pre-
viously described using the averages of the slices sampled from each
animal (TC, n � 5; Hx, n � 3; and HI, n � 3 animals) (McNeal et al.,
2016).
Neuron virtual reconstruction. Confocal z stacks of the 200-�m-thick
tissue sections were acquired at 20� (488 nm and 561 nm excitation,
2048 � 2048 pixel resolution, 1� optical zoom, pinhole � 19.2 �m, 1
�m step size, 2� averaging), such that the entire dendritic arbor of SPNs
could be visualized and later reconstructed. Images were converted from
*.nd2 to *.tif format using FIJI, and tiff stacks were opened using Neuro-
lucida (MBF Bioscience, RRID:SCR_001775). Neurons were traced if
they met the following criteria: (1) expression of Cplx3, (2) adequate
filling of the cell body and dendritic processes with DiI, (3) presence of
the entire dendritic arbor without significant process truncation, and
(4) no obstruction of the neuron by other DiI-filled structures. The out-
line of the cell soma was traced at its widest point in the 2D plane to
provide an estimate of cross-sectional area, and the dendritic arbor was
traced in the x, y, and z coordinate planes. The dendritic arbor was not
followed into adjacent slices, and the dendritic diameter was not studied.
Using these selection criteria, a total of 658 Cplx3 � SPNs (n � 230 TC
neurons; 6 fetuses, 4 female, 2 male; n � 217 Hx neurons, 8 fetuses, 3
female, 5 male; n � 211 HI neurons, 8 fetuses, 3 female, 5 male) were
examined. To estimate arbor complexity, a value was computed by Neu-
rolucida software by the following equation: [Sum of the terminal orders �
Number of terminals] � [Total dendritic length/Number of primary
dendrites] (Pillai et al., 2012).
Fetal ovine ansate (cruciate) gyrus acute slice preparation. Methods for
preparation of brain slices and subsequent patch-clamp recording were
similar to our previous reports in rodents (Andrade and Rossi, 2010;
Mohr et al., 2010), nonhuman primates (Welsh et al., 2011; Mohr et al.,
2013), and fetal sheep (McClendon et al., 2014) All standard salts were
from Sigma Chemicals, and kynurenic acid was from Abcam.
After rapid removal of the brain, frontal forebrain was rapidly isolated
and immersed in ice-cold (0°C–2°C), low-sodium, artificial cerebrospi-
nal fluid (ACSF) composed of the following (in mM): 234 sucrose, 3.2
KCl, 17 NaH2PO4, 6 MgSO4, 10 D-glucose, 27.7 NaHCO3, and 0.216
CaCl2, and transported to the electrophysiology laboratory (total trans-
port time was �5 min). The ansate (cruciate) gyrus was microdissected
from the surrounding cortex and mounted perpendicular to the WM in
a slicing chamber filled with ice-cold (0°C–2°C), low sodium ACSF. Hor-
izontal slices (225 �m) were made with a ceramic razor blade mounted
in a vibrating microtome (Vibratome, Oxford Instruments). Slices were
incubated in warmed (33 � 1°C), normal ACSF (in mM as follows: 124

 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10
D-glucose, and bubbled with 95%O2/5% CO2, pH 7.4) for 1 h after brain
collection and subsequently held in room temperature ACSF until used.
Kynurenic acid (1 mM) was included in the holding solution (to block
glutamate receptors to reduce potential excitotoxic damage) but was
omitted from other experimental solutions.
Electrophysiology. Slices were placed in a submersion chamber and viewed
with a Hitachi KP-M2RN CCD camera (Kokuasi Electric) mounted on an
Olympus BX-51 microscope equipped with a 60� 0.9 N.A. water-
immersion objective (Olympus) and modified Dodt contrast enhance-
ment optics. Slices were perfused with warmed (32°C–34°C) ACSF at a
rate of �3 ml/min. The SPN layer was �1.5 mm from the edge of the
slice, adjacent to the WM, and was visually identified using DIC. Patch-
clamp recordings (using a Molecular Devices Multiclamp 700-B ampli-
fier in voltage- and current-clamp configurations) were made with patch
pipettes constructed from thick-walled borosilicate glass capillaries and
filled with an internal solution containing the following (in mM): 132.3 K
gluconate, 7.7 KCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 4 MgATP, and
0.5 Na2GTP. Solutions were pH adjusted to 7.2–7.3 with KOH. The
internal solution also contained 0.125% neurobiotin in �50% of the
recordings for histology. Since previous studies found that neurobiotin
can affect electrical excitability at higher concentrations (Schlo
¨sser et al.,
1998), we initially analyzed neuronal recording properties with varying
concentrations of neurobiotin. When 0.5% neurobiotin was included in
the recording electrode, electrical excitability was clearly altered (data not
shown). However, no significant effects were detected at 0.125%, and all
reported studies were done with concentrations of neurobiotin of
�0.125%. Electrode resistance was 3.5–5.5 M�. Cells were rejected if
access resistance was �10 M�.
Recording protocol. After establishing whole-cell voltage-clamp config-
uration with stable access resistance (assessed by �5 mV voltage steps),
the amplifier was switched to current-clamp mode. For each cell in the
three experimental groups, a constant current was injected to bring Vm to
�65 mV (TC � �66.0 � 18.1 pA, n � 36; Hx � �19.3 � 5.7 pA, n � 53;
HI � �31.1 � 6.5 pA, n � 52 cells). Cell excitability was determined by
injecting a series of currents (300 ms duration), from �40 pA to 125 pA
in 15 pA increments per step (12 current injection steps), and recording
the voltage response. If none of the depolarizing current injections
evoked action potentials, an additional current injection protocol was
implemented, starting at 125 pA and increased by 25 pA increment steps
to 250 pA (6 total steps). To quantify general excitability, plots of the
number of action potentials evoked by a given current injection were
generated for each cell (see Fig. 9G), and the area under the resultant
curve (AUC) was determined and used for a single, summary value of
cellular excitability to be compared with various ischemic/metabolic pa-
rameters (see Fig. 9H–J). Subsequently, the amplifier was switched to
voltage-clamp configuration (Vh � �65 mV), and an I–V curve was
constructed by implementing a series of 10 voltage steps from �85 mV to
5 mV in 10 mV increments, each lasting 50 ms. Voltage and current
responses were acquired at 20 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz, and their magni-
tude and kinetics were analyzed with pClamp software (version 10.6,
Molecular Devices) and IGOR (Wavemetrics, RRID:SCR_000325). After
completion of the I–V protocols, the holding potential was changed to Vh
� �80 mV and spontaneous synaptic activity was recorded at 5 kHz,
filtered at 2 kHz for 3–5 min. The kinetics and magnitude of the sponta-
neous synaptic currents were analyzed with pClamp. For correlation
analysis between synaptic current frequencies and metabolic parameters,
two HI cells (of 51 total) were excluded from analysis as aberrant outliers
because their frequency was �3 SDs higher than the mean for all cells.
Postrecording immunohistochemistry for Cplx3. To confirm recordings
in SPNs, a subset of cells were filled with neurobiotin (Vector Laborato-
ries, catalog #SP-1120, RRID:AB_2313575) and labeled for Cplx3. Four
cells were recorded from each slice, in the same laminar position. The
first and fourth cells, which defined the outer boundaries of the recording
site, were filled with neurobiotin. Immediately after termination of the
recording from the fourth cell, the two neurobiotin-loaded cells were
visualized with fluorescence optics on the patch-clamp microscope. After
confirming the location of the recorded cells within the SP, slices were
immersion fixed overnight at 4°C in phosphate-buffered 2% PFA, 15%
picric acid, pH 7.4, and processed for immunohistochemical detection of
neurobiotin with FITC-conjugated streptavidin, and Cplx3, as described
above, visualized with anti-rabbit Rhodamine Red X-conjugated second-
ary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog #111-

Statistical analyses. All data analyses were performed with either SAS/
STAT (SAS Institute RRID:SCR_008567) or Prism 4 statistical software
(GraphPad Software RRID:SCR_002798). Data are expressed as mean �
SEM. Comparisons of group means for cell counts and area fractions
among age-matched TC, Hx control, and HI animals were performed
with the Kruskal–Wallis test (one-way ANOVA) followed by the Dunn
post hoc test for multiple pairs. Comparisons of group means for den-
dritic morphology and electrophysiological parameters among age-
matched TC, Hx, and HI animals were performed with the SAS/STAT
GLIMMIX mixed-effects model, which tested and controlled for any
effects of ewe, fetus, or gender, followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test
for multiple treatment pairs. No effects of ewe, fetus, or gender were
observed unless otherwise noted. Sholl (radius � treatment group) and
branch order (branch order � treatment group) analyses of dendritic
morphology parameters between age-matched TC, Hx, and HI animals
were performed by two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc
tests. A value of p � 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Fetal HI generates acute cell degeneration in cerebral WM
and SP
Because human SPNs are highly enriched in the preterm brain
during the period of increased risk for cerebral white matter in-
jury (WMI) (Volpe, 2009), we quantified cell degeneration in the
SP in a preterm fetal sheep model of diffuse WMI (Back et al.,
2012) induced by brachiocephalic artery occlusion and/or mater-
nal Hx at 0.65 gestation (preterm human equivalent �24–28
weeks gestation). At 24 h (n � 3 TC, 5 Hx, 4 HI) and 4 weeks (n �
7 TC, 3 Hx, 6 HI) after the insult, cell death was quantified at the
level of the frontal cerebral WM, a region that is particularly
susceptible to cerebral WMI in human and sheep. Cellular degen-
eration was identified by the presence of AC3 staining or con-
densed, pyknotic nuclei visualized with Hoechst 33342.
At 24 h survival, the WM displayed a modest increase in cell
death in response to fetal Hx and a more pronounced increase
from HI, as measured by pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 1C: p � 0.0001,
Kruskal–Wallis test; TC 1.35 � 0.33 vs Hx 8.16 � 0.58, p � 0.01;
TC vs HI 20.79 � 3.18, p � 0.001, Dunn’s post hoc test for mul-
tiple pairs) and AC3 �/apoptotic cells (Fig. 1E: p � 0.0001; TC
0.63 � 0.14 vs Hx 4.42 � 0.51, p � 0.01; TC vs HI 17.71 � 3.22,
p � 0.001). A similar, but more moderate, response was also
observed in the SP for pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 1C: p � 0.0013; TC
0.14 � 0.08 vs Hx 2.61 � 0.55, p � 0.05; TC vs HI 9.04 � 3.20, p �
0.01) and apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 1E: p � 0.0113; TC 0.08 � 0.05 vs
Hx 1.48 � 0.53, not significant; TC vs HI 4.80 � 1.72, p � 0.05).
After a 4 week survival, a low level of delayed cell degeneration
was seen in the WM and SP in response to either insult (Fig.
1D,F). In response to fetal Hx, a modest increase in cell death was
seen in the WM (Fig. 1D; pyknosis TC 2.40 � 0.31 vs Hx 4.30 �
0.35, p � 0.05; Fig. 1F; apoptosis TC 2.55 � 0.26 vs Hx 4.05 �
0.64, not significant). A similar response was seen for HI (Fig. 1D;
pyknosis TC 2.40 � 0.31 vs HI 6.06 � 0.74, p � 0.001; Fig. 1F;
apoptosis TC 2.55 � 0.26 vs HI 7.15 � 0.95, p � 0.001). Like the
WM, the incidence of pyknosis in the SP also declined in the Hx
group (Fig. 1D; TC 2.13 � 0.32 vs Hx 3.00 � 0.40, not significant)
but remained significantly different in the HI group (Fig. 1D; TC
2.13 � 0.32 vs HI 4.60 � 0.62, p � 0.01). In contrast to the WM,
apoptosis failed to reach significance in the SP 4 weeks after ex-
posure to Hx or HI (Fig. 1F; TC 1.96 � 0.33 vs Hx 2.80 � 0.64 or
HI 3.75 � 0.77, not significant). Like the WM, no significant

 differences in the degree of pyknosis or apoptosis were observed
between Hx versus HI in the SP. Hence, cell death in the WM was
accompanied by a low level of cell death in the preterm SP in
response to Hx or HI.
Cplx3 discretely localizes to fetal ovine neurons
We next asked whether degenerating SPNs were present in the
WM or SP in response to Hx or HI. We first tested several poten-
tial SPN markers, Nurr1, Tbr1, and Cplx3, in preterm fetal ovine
brain at 0.65 and 0.85 gestation. Unlike the robust staining ob-
served in neonatal rodents (Wang et al., 2010), Nurr1 staining
gave inconsistent results at both dGAs in the fetal ovine fore-
brain (data not shown). Although we obtained reproducible Tbr1
staining at both dGAs, Tbr1 localized nonselectively to neurons
both in deeper cortical layers as well as the SP layer and subjacent
WM (Fig. 2A,B). By contrast, Cplx3 discretely localized to the SP
and scattered interstitial neurons in the WM at both dGAs (Fig.
2C,D), similar to that previously reported in rat (Hoerder-
Suabedissen and Molna
´r, 2013). To confirm the localization of
Cplx3 in the fetal ovine SP, the neuronal marker Tbr1 was covi-
sualized with Cplx3. All Cplx3 � cells were also Tbr1 � (Fig. 2E),
but not all Tbr1 � cells were Cplx3 �. Although both Cplx3 and
Tbr1 were robustly expressed in SPNs, the discrete localization of
Cplx3 to the SP identified it as a selective SPN marker in fetal

Degenerating cells in the SP zone are not Tbr1 � SPNs.
To determine the magnitude and extent of SPN degeneration, we
next sought to combine staining for AC3 with a SPN marker. It
was not feasible to covisualize AC3 and Cplx3 because both were
detected with a rabbit antisera. Consequently, we pursued an alter-
nativeapproachtoquantifystainingforAC3andTbr1intheSP(Fig.
2F,G). Surprisingly, at 24 h after exposure to Hx or HI, colocaliza-
tion of Tbr1 and AC3 was not observed in the SP. We confirmed
this result by quantifying Tbr1-labeled cells that had a pyknotic
nucleus visualized with Hoechst 33342. As summarized in Table 1,
only 3.7% of pyknotic nuclei in the SP were Tbr1 � in the Hx
group. In 4 week survivors, the percentage of degenerating Tbr1 �
SP cells was still very low or negligible as defined by pyknotic
nuclei (TC � 0%, Hx � 10%, and HI � 8.3%) or AC3-labeled
cells (TC � 2.2%, Hx � 0%, and HI � 1.5%). In cerebral WM,
the percentage of degenerating Tbr1 � cells was also similarly low
for both the 24 h and 4 week survivors. Hence, SPN degeneration
did not appear to substantially contribute to the observed cellular
degeneration in either the preterm fetal SP or WM.
Degenerating cells in the SP layer are oligodendrocyte
lineage cells
Because we did not identify either early or delayed degeneration
of Tbr1-labeled neurons in the SP, we tested an alternative
hypothesis that the degenerating cells might be glial in origin.
Because we previously detected widespread degeneration of O4-
antibody labeled late oligodendrocyte progenitors (preOLs) in
fetal cerebral WM at 0.65 gestation in response to HI (Riddle et
al., 2006), we determined whether preOLs might also degenerate
in the SP in response to HI or Hx. Staining for the O4 antibody in
combination with Hoechst 33342 detected numerous degenerat-
ing O4-labeled cells in the SP after HI (Fig. 3A–E), as well as in
cerebral WM and the cortex. Scattered foci of degenerating pre-
OLs were also detected throughout the WM after Hx (Fig. 3G).
Hence, preterm WMI was accompanied by degeneration of pre-
OLs, but neuronal degeneration was rarely observed in the SP or
adjacent cerebral cortex.
WMI from HI is not accompanied by SPN inflammation
Periventricular WMI from HI in preterm fetal sheep and human
is accompanied by persistent reactive astrogliosis and microglio-
sis (Riddle et al., 2011; Buser et al., 2012). We first determined
whether an acute inflammatory response was observed in the
cerebral WM adjacent to the SP layer in response to HI or Hx.
Fetal (93 dGA, 0.65 gestation) brains were analyzed at 24 h after
HI with the astrocyte marker GFAP (Fig. 4A–F) and the macro-
phage/microglial marker Iba1 (Fig. 4G–L). Despite the presence
of periventricular WMI with preOL degeneration, we did not ob-
serve increased astroglial or micoglial/macrophage reactivity in the
superficial WM adjacent to the SP.
Similarly, at 4 weeks after HI or Hx, there were no significant
differences in GFAP-labeled cells as determined by area fraction
analysis in the TC versus HI groups (Fig. 4O), whereas GFAP label-
ing was significantly lower in the Hx group relative to both TC and
HI groups (Fig. 4O; p � 0.001 Dunn’s post hoc for multiple compar-
isons). The density of GFAP-labeled cells, quantified by stereol-
ogy, did not differ among the three groups (ANOVA F(2,8) �
1.048, p � 0.3943). Hence, neither HI nor Hx appeared to pro-
mote acute or chronic enhanced glial reactivity adjacent to the SP.
SPN basal dendrite maturation is disrupted in response to
fetal Hx or HI
We previously found that HI-induced WMI in the preterm fetal
brain was accompanied by disturbances in neuronal maturation
in the cerebral cortex (Dean et al., 2013) and caudate nucleus
(McClendon et al., 2014). Although SPNs displayed significant
resistance to cell death in the setting of WMI, we determined
whether they might display disturbances in dendritic arboriza-

 tion in response to Hx or HI. Because
SPNs display a wide variety of morpho-
logical subtypes, this heterogeneity pre-
cluded the unambiguous identification of
SPNs through the widely used Golgi-
impregnation technique. We used an
alternative approach where Cplx3 immu-
nohistochemistry was combined with Di-
Olistics to specifically label SPNs by gene
gun delivery of DiI to permit 3D recon-
struction of dendritic arbors visualized by
confocal microscopy (Fig. 5A–C, top
row). Unlike the Golgi stain, the use of DiI
not only allowed us to select the Cplx3-
immunoreactive SP population, but it
also allowed us to visualize and trace the
complete apical arbors (Fig. 5A–C, bot-
tom row) as well as the basal dendritic
trees (Fig. 5A–C, third row). The four cri-
teria for selection of SPNs for morpho-
metric analysis are described in Materials
and Methods.
The basal and apical dendrites of a to-
tal of 658 Cplx3 �/DiI � SPNs subjacent to
the primary motor and somatosensory
cortices (n � 230 TC, 217 Hx, and 211 HI
cells; n � 6 TC, 8 Hx, and 8 HI fetal brains)
were traced and quantified by Neurolucida
after a 4 week survival (�119–123 dGA,
0.85 gestation). For multiple measures
of basal dendritic complexity, SPNs
from the controls (TC) generally dis-
played greater complexity than either
the Hx or HI groups (Figs. 5, 6). Al-
though not evident from most global
measures of complexity, significant dif-
ferences in SPN basal dendrites were
also observed between the Hx and HI
groups when complexity metrics were explored by branch order.
To estimate the effect of Hx or HI on arbor maturation, an
overall complexity value was calculated using Neurolucida (see
Materials and Methods). In response to both Hx and HI, SPN
basaldendritesdisplayedasignificantreductioninoverallcomplex-
ity relative to controls (Fig. 6A; TC 40,470 � 3441 vs Hx 20,640 �
1531, mean � SEM, df � 2, 652, t � �4.25, Bonferroni p � 0.0001;
TC 40,470 � 3441 vs HI 25,960 � 1798, t � �3.45, p � 0.0018). No
significantdifferences(t��0.32,p�1.0000)werepresentbetween
the HI and Hx groups.
Although several factors contribute to the calculation of the
global complexity metric, for our population of SPNs, the dendritic
length of the branches had the most impact on the complexity in the
Hx and HI groups. The mean dendritic length was significantly re-
ducedfortheHxandHIgroupsversuscontrols(Fig.6B;TC402.30�
13.50 vs Hx 308.90 � 12.27, mean � SEM, df � 2, 652, t � �4.24,

�2.45, p � 0.0439). Branch order analysis revealed that the overall
reduction in dendritic length was mostly related to reduced matura-
tion of the sixth- and seventh-order basal dendritic branches, which
decreasedsignificantlyinlengthinbothHxandHIgroups(Fig.6F).

 Although a trend toward fewer total branch points (nodes)
was present globally in SPNs exposed to Hx and HI versus
control, these groups failed to reach statistical significance (Fig.
6C). However, when nodes were examined on the basis of indi-
vidual branch orders, the decline in the quantity of branch points
was significant for branch orders 2–6 for the Hx group and
branch orders 4–6 for the HI group (Fig. 6G). Consistent with
the decline in nodes for the Hx and HI groups, there was also a
significant decrease in the number of branches for branch orders
4–7 for both the Hx and HI groups versus controls (Fig. 6H). No
differences were seen in the number of total branches or endings
(terminals) between the Hx and HI groups versus controls (data
not shown).
The complex responses of the SPNs was further illustrated by
analysis of soma size and the related number of primary den-
drites. The mean area of the cell soma was lower in both Hx and
HI animals versus controls (Fig. 6D; TC 350.50 � 9.34 vs Hx
333.20 � 8.93, mean � SEM, df � 2, 652, t � �2.72, Bonferroni
p � 0.0198; TC 350.50 � 9.34 vs HI 307.80 � 11.67, t � �2.94,
p � 0.0102). No differences were observed between soma size of
the Hx and HI groups (t � 0.28, p � 1.0000). It was notable that
changes in complexity of the basal dendritic arbors to Hx or HI
were variable and related to distance from the soma. Despite the
smaller soma size of the HI SPNs, the number of primary basal
dendrites projecting from the soma of the Hx and HI SPNs
tended to increase versus control but only reached statistical sig-
nificance in the HI SPNs (Fig. 6E; TC 4.06 � 0.10 vs Hx 4.79 �
0.11 mean � SEM, df � 2, 644, t � 1.76, Bonferroni p � 0.2377;
TC 4.06 � 0.10 vs HI 4.62 � 0.10, t � 2.43, p � 0.0462). This
finding suggested that an increase in primary dendrites in concert
with an overall decline in dendritic complexity might potentially
produce a null difference in Sholl intersections between controls
and treated groups because multiple simple arbors can produce
as many intersections as a few complex arbors. Nevertheless, the
significant decline in basal dendritic complexity of the Hx and HI
SPNs relative to controls did produce significant differences in
the number of observed intersections in the Sholl analysis (Fig. 6I;
TC vs Hx radii 60–105, p � 0.01; TC vs HI radii 95–110, p � 0.05;
Hx vs HI, not significant).
SPN apical dendrite maturation is disrupted in response to
fetal Hx but not HI
Among the total population of SPNs studied, 99.5% of them had
a single apical dendrite oriented toward the pial surface (TC �
100%, Hx � 99.1%, and HI 99.5%). In contrast to the basal
dendritic arbors, the apical dendritic arbors of the HI group gen-

complex than the Hx group for multiple global measures of com-
plexity but failed to reach statistical significance for any of these

values for the Hx and HI groups (Fig. 7D; TC 60,950 � 6206 vs

roni p � 0.2208; Hx 39,170 � 3244 vs HI 49,560 � 4116 t � 0.32,
p � 1.0000). However, branch order analyses of nodes (Fig. 7G)
and total number of branches per branch order (Fig. 7F) revealed
that the tendency toward reduced complexity of SPNs in the Hx
group was related to significant changes in branch orders 3–6 for
nodes and 4–7 for numbers of branches. No significant differ-
ences in the apical dendritic arbors were observed among the
three groups for total dendritic length or mean dendritic length
when considered as a whole or by branch order (data not shown).
Although the individual indices of complexity (nodes, endings,
and total branch number) failed to reveal significant differences
in the apical arbor between the TC and HI groups, a Sholl analysis
(Fig. 7E) demonstrated that the number of intersections in-
creased in the HI group at 25–50 �m from the soma relative to
controls (p � 0.01) and 30–60 �m (p � 0.01) from the soma
relative to the Hx group. A significant decline in the number of
intersections was observed between TC and Hx groups at 100–
120, and 135 �m (p � 0.05) from the soma.
SPN complexity is directly related to fetal
systemic oxygenation
As noted above, we often paradoxically observed that the HI
group was less significantly affected than the Hx group. To eval-
uate this paradox, we instrumented 13 sets of twins to collect
ABG values on both Hx and HI fetuses (4 females/9 males in each
experimental group). Blood samples were collected (Fig. 8A) at
the start of the experiment (pre-ABG), 5 min after the onset of
maternal Hx (Hx-ABG), 25 min later at the end of Hx or HI
(HI-ABG), and 10 min after the end of Hx or HI (post-ABG). The
mean oxygen content, lactate, and glucose values of the 13 twin
pairs (Fig. 8B–D, blue [Hx] and red [HI] lines) were compared
with the mean values of the 8 HI fetuses used in this study to
analyze SP anatomy (Fig. 8B–D, black [HI-SP] lines). Figure 8B
shows that all fetal groups had the same mean baseline (pre-ABG)
values for oxygen content. Five minutes into maternal Hx (Hx
ABG), all fetal groups respond with a drop in oxygen content
(vol %). Twenty-five minutes later (HI ABG), the two fetal HI
groups mounted a compensatory response that elevated their
oxygen content back to baseline levels, whereas the Hx twins
continued to display reduced oxygen content until maternal
Hx was terminated.
To better understand the source of the rise in mean oxygen
content values, we examined hemoglobin, hematocrit, oxygen
saturation (sO2%), and partial pressure (PaO2 mmHg) values.
Whereas there were no differences in hemoglobin or hematocrit
levels across the groups, oxygen saturation and partial pressure
values had a corresponding rise in the HI group relative to the Hx
(Table 2). Hence, this compensatory response of the HI group to
the severity of the HI insult resulted in normalization of the fetal
systemic hypoxemia and appeared to be related to the generally
greater complexity of the SPNs in the HI group relative to the Hx.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the complexity of the basal
dendritic arbors of the SPNs for 8 HI animals for which blood gas

 values were available to calculate an oxygen content rebound
ratio, which was defined as the ratio of the HI-ABG/Hx-ABG
oxygen content values (Fig. 8E). Among HI animals, basal den-
dritic complexity was positively associated with the oxygen con-
tent rebound ratio (F(1,208) � 3.81, p � 0.05) such that, as the
ratio increased, so did basal dendritic complexity.
SPN excitability and synaptic activity are directly related to
fetal systemic lactic acidosis
To define how HI and Hx affect SPN signaling, we conducted
current- and voltage-clamp recordings from cells in the SP region
(Figs. 9, 10). Cells were confirmed to be neuronal by their ability
to fire action potentials and/or the presence of synaptic currents
(Figs. 9D–F, 10A,B). These neurons were all located in the region
of highest density of Cplx3-labeled cells and had dendritic mor-
phologiessimilar to those observed from morphometric DiOlistic
labeling (Figs. 5, 9A–C). Of the 34 cells that were filled with neu-
robiotin and survived removal of the recording electrode and
subsequent fixation, 80% were confirmed to be immunoreactive
for Cplx3. Those cells that did not colocalize with Cplx or for
which staining was ambiguous were not analyzed.
To quantify overall neuronal excitability, current-clamp record-
ings were conducted, and voltage responses to a series of hyperpo-
larizing and depolarizing current injections were recorded (Fig.
9D–F). SPNs did not exhibit hyperpolarization-activated poten-
tials or rebound spiking, but the vast majority of SPNs in each
condition (TC � 92%, Hx � 96%, and HI � 92%) exhibited
action potentials in response to depolarizing current injections
(Fig. 9D–F). Excitability (defined as the number of action poten-
tials fired for a given depolarizing current magnitude, and quan-
tified by the area under the input–output curve for each cell:
AUC; for details, see Materials and Methods) varied considerably
across individual cells, but there were no significant differences
across conditions (p � 0.3310; Fig. 9D–H).
However, excitability (AUC) was significantly negatively as-
sociated with the lactate rebound ratio (Fig. 9I) defined as the
HI-ABG value/Hx-ABG value (df � 1, 56, t � �2.72, p � 0.0086)
and the lactate recovery ratio defined as the post-ABG value/pre-
ABG baseline value (Fig. 9J; df � 1, 52, t � �2.57, p � 0.0132).
The observed differences in excitability were not due to differ-
ences in the properties of the Na � channels that generate action
potentials because there was no significant relationship between
excitability and the Na � current magnitude assessed under voltage
clamp (Fig. 9K,L). Instead, differences in excitability were signifi-
cantly positively associated with differences in resting input resis-
tance (df � 1, 132, t � 7.18, p � 0.0001; Fig. 9M), suggesting that
differences in excitability are due to differences in electrical shunting
(Heigele et al., 2016).
Although recording solutions were optimized for recording
actionpotentialsunderphysiologicalionicconditions,uponswitch-
ing to voltage-clamp (Vh � �80 mV), spontaneous synaptic cur-
rents were clearly resolvable (Fig. 10A,B). Given that our recording
solutions result in the reversal potential for glutamate-gated and
GABA receptor-gated currents being �0 mV and �60 mV, re-

 spectively, both synaptic currents would be inward at Vh � �80
mV, and so all analyses likely reflect the activity of both GABA-
ergic and glutamatergic synapses. Similar to SPN excitability, the
frequency of synaptic currents in SPNs was widely variable across
cells, but there were no significant differences across conditions
(df � 2, 125, F � 2.71, p � 0.0706; Fig. 10A–C). However, syn-
aptic current frequency was significantly positively associated
with the lactate recovery ratio (Post/Pre; df � 1, 53, t � 2.05, p �
0.0451; Fig. 10D) and the glucose ratio (HI/Hx; df � 1, 57, t �
2.25, p � 0.0283; Fig. 10E). Given that variation in cellular input
resistance appears to explain differences in SPN excitability (Fig.
9M), we determined whether variation in synaptic activity across
cells could account for the differences in input resistance. Indeed,
the frequency of synaptic currents was significantly negatively
associated with cellular input resistance (df � 1, 125, t � �3.25,
p � 0.0015; Fig. 10F). Thus, SPN synaptic activity and electrical
excitability (which is likely determined by the level of spontane-
ous synaptic activity) are directly related to hypoxemia-induced
changes in levels of glucose and lactate.
Discussion
We demonstrated that transient disturbances in fetal oxygenation
can trigger chronic dysmaturation of SPNs without significant SPN
degeneration during a critical window in the establishment of cor-
tical connectivity. Under conditions of moderately severe Hx or
HI, SPNs and interstitial WM neurons were markedly more re-
sistant to degeneration than preOLs. PreOL degeneration ap-
peared to account for almost all cell death in the SP and adjacent
WM in response to HI or Hx. Future studies are needed to deter-
mine whether preOL degeneration in the SP zone may also
contribute to SPN dysmaturation through disruption of trophic
interactions between preOLs and SPNs at the level of their
dendritic or axonal arbors. Moreover, preOL dysmaturation in
chronic WM lesions may disrupt axonal inputs to SPNs (e.g.,
thalamocortical afferents), which may further contribute to ab-
errant cortical connectivity.
The paucity of SPN degeneration is consistent with the re-
sponse of preterm fetal ovine cortical pyramidal neurons (Dean
et al., 2013) and caudate medium spiny neurons (McClendon et
al., 2014), where minimal neuronal degeneration also occurred in
response to HI. More severe cerebral insults appear to be required
for SPN degeneration in rodents (Okusa et al., 2014; Jantzie et al.,
2015; Mikhailova et al., 2017) or human (Folkerth et al., 2008;
Andiman et al., 2010; Kinney et al., 2012; Pogledic et al., 2014), in
which case neuronal degeneration is also observed in other gray
matter structures. Similarly, rodent models of excitotoxic WM
injury generate necrotic lesions that are accompanied by exten-
sive neuronal degeneration and gyral abnormalities (Marret et
al., 1995). The resistance of SPNs to degeneration does not appear
related to a lower level of SP ischemia because fetal ovine cortex
and WM sustain similar blood flow during ischemia and reper-
fusion (Riddle et al., 2006; McClure et al., 2008). Hence, both the
selective vulnerability of preOLs (Back and Rosenberg, 2014) and
Table 2. The ABG values of 13 twin pairs (one Hx and one HI fetus/pair) are compared with the ABG values of the 8 HI fetuses used to study the SP in this paper (HI-SP)

 the resistance of SPNs appear to reflect cell-specific responses to a
similar magnitude of ischemia.
We identified a new form of SPN vulnerability related to dis-
turbances in dendritic development, synaptic activity, and neu-
ronal excitability. The long-term maturation of basal and apical
dendritic arbors of SPNs was associated with transient disruption
of fetal oxygenation 1 month earlier. Moreover, electrophysio-
logical studies of SPNs from chronic survivors found increased

 synaptic activity and a resultant shunting inhibition of electrical
excitability, both associated with fetal hypoxemia-induced changes.
Serialfetalbloodgasmeasurementsdemonstrated that the preterm
ovine fetus responds to maternal Hx with a broad range of sys-
temic oxygen levels. In fetuses exposed only to Hx, fetal systemic
oxygen levels remain low throughout the period of maternal Hx
and only return to baseline levels with the cessation of maternal
Hx. In contrast to their Hx-only twin, the fetal systemic oxygen
levels of the HI twin rebounds in a compensatory response to the
added ischemic insult before the cessation of maternal Hx and the
onset of reperfusion. Although we expected that HI would more
adversely impact SPN maturation, we actually observed that
SPNs in the HI group were more similar to control than Hx
neurons. We attribute this paradoxical difference to the compen-
satory response of the fetus to HI. In contrast to fetal exposure to
Hx, animals that sustained HI displayed significantly higher sys-
temic oxygen levels during ischemia, which suggested that HI
promotes a fetal physiological response to cerebral hypoxemia
that extracts more circulating oxygen (Brew et al., 2014). Consis-
tent with the apparent inability of the Hx fetus to mount a
protective response to hypoxemia, SPN arborization was signifi-
cantly more affected. Moreover, the severity of the metabolic
insult, as measured by lactic acidemia, was also significantly as-
sociated with SPN dendritic dysmaturation, as defined electro-
physiologically. The association with lactate is consistent with the
notion that lactic acidosis is a major consequence of hypoxemia
(Volpe, 2008). Hence, our morphometric and electrophysiology
studies similarly support that chronic SPN dysmaturation is associ-
ated with the severity of fetal systemic hypoxemia and lactic aci-
demia, which are indicators of global fetal metabolic stress. A
limitation of our in utero preparation is the lack of feasibility to
measure fetal cerebral oxygenation or glucose metabolites, such
as lactate. Although our data found significant associations be-
tween measures of SPN activity and systemic lactate levels, we
cannot conclude that cerebral lactate levels are mechanistically
linked to SPN dysmaturation. Systemic hypoxemia may con-
tribute to SPN dysmaturation through one or more potential
mechanisms thatincludeaberrantexpressionofgenesthatstabilize
dendritic arbors (Curristin et al., 2002; Koleske, 2013) or regulation
ofinflammatorymediatorsshowntoplayaroleinelaborationofthe
dendritic arbor or regulation of synaptic activity (Stellwagen, 2011;
Pribiag and Stellwagen, 2014).
Although the response of SPNs to isolated acute or chronic Hx
has not been studied in rodents, neonatal rodents respond to
intermittent Hx or severe chronic Hx with disturbances in WM
gliogenesis and myelination (Schwartz et al., 2004; Back et al.,
2006; Salmaso et al., 2012; Fancy et al., 2014; Scafidi et al., 2014;
Juliano et al., 2015). Chronic Hx disrupts myelination through
Hx inducible factor that couples angiogenesis and preOL matu-
ration (Yuen et al., 2014). However, chronic Hx does not trigger
preOL degeneration in neonatal mice. Similarly, unilateral acute
HI is not associated with preOL degeneration in the contralateral
hypoxic hemisphere in neonatal rats (Back et al., 2002; Segovia et
al., 2008). In contrast, we observed that both preterm fetal HI and
Hx triggered preOL degeneration. Hence, there appear to be
species-associated differences in the response to Hx between ro-
dents and sheep that may also be related to differences in adap-
tation to the in utero versus extrauterine environment of the WM.
Although SPN maturation has not been specifically studied,
chronic Hx also results in a variety of disturbances in gray matter
maturation. Chronic Hx in mice reduces cortical volume, triggers
neuronal apoptosis (Banasiak et al., 2000), and induces a delay in
Figure 10.

 cortical maturation (Salmaso et al., 2014) that appears to involve
disturbances in neurogenesis and disruptions in interneuron
maturation, connectivity, and activity (Komitova et al., 2013).
Prolonged exposure to hypoxemia, induced by restricting utero-
placental flow for 6 or 12 h in utero in �0.6 gestation preterm fetal
sheepresultedinreductionsincortical,cerebellar,andhippocampal
volume, and reductions in Purkinje cell arborization and spine
density after 1 week (Rees et al., 1999), but with sparse cell death.
Similarly, chronic Hx in full-term neonatal piglets disrupts cor-
tical growth and reduces neurogenesis (Morton et al., 2017).
Systemic inflammation induced by endotoxin or other inflam-
matory mediators is commonly associated with perinatal brain
injury that results in cell death (Hagberg et al., 2015) and matura-
tional disturbances in WM and gray matter (Dean et al., 2011;
Favrais et al., 2011). In contrast, we did not observe that acute Hx
resulted in significant acute or chronic inflammation. Our find-
ings are consistent with multiple studies of chronic Hx in mice,
where neither gray nor WM inflammation mediated by reactive
astrocytes or microglial was observed (for review, see Back and
Rosenberg, 2014). Although we found no evidence that our mod-
els of HI or Hx activated glial inflammation in the SP or adjacent
subcortical WM, there remains a potential role for inflammatory
mediators as a synergistic contributor to SPN dysmaturation that
might be identified by a more detailed analysis of intermediate
recovery periods.
The timing of insults to the preterm SP may be a critical factor
that defines the magnitude of disruption to cortical connectivity.
SPN dendritic maturation in rodents and carnivores involves
both initial progressive growth and regressive events in which the
arbor remodels. SPNs initially have large arbors that contact all
cortical layers, but later most SPN connections are restricted to
layer 4 or below (Friauf et al., 1990; Hoerder-Suabedissen and
Molna
´r, 2013). The reduction in SPN arbors in response to fetal
ovine hypoxemia is consistent with disruption of SPN matura-
tion during a phase of progressive arbor growth. Hence, the tim-
ing of hypoxemia may have variable impact depending on the
phase of growth of the SPN arbors.
SPN dysmaturation may have several potential consequences
for maturation of the cortex, thalamus, and their connections.
Thalamic inputs to the SP and SPN projections to cortical layer 4
may be particularly affected as may be local interneuron projec-
tions to layer 4. In human preterm survivors, MRI-defined re-
ductions in cortical and thalamic growth have been extensively
described (Nagasunder et al., 2011; Ball et al., 2015; Loh et al.,
2017) and may be related to SPN-mediated disturbances in neu-
ronal maturation in these structures. Consistent with this notion,
we observed that the fetal ovine cortex displays progressive vol-
ume loss in response to HI that is accompanied by reduction in
the dendritic arbor of cortical pyramidal neurons (Dean et al.,
2013). Alternatively, in the setting of more severe insults, primary
injury to the thalamus (Pierson et al., 2007; Ligam et al., 2009) or
cortex (Andiman et al., 2010) may disrupt projections to the SP
with secondary disturbances in SPN maturation.
Human preterm survivors who sustain Hx or HI are at in-
creased risk for a broad spectrum of cognitive and neurobehav-
ioral disabilities (Volpe, 2008). Although our findings are derived
from an in utero model, they suggest that persistent SPN dysma-
turation may also contribute to these chronic neurobehavioral
deficits when sustained by transient hypoxemia postnatally in
preterm neonates. The particular sensitivity of fetal SPNs to tran-
sient disturbances in oxygen delivery in utero is clinically possible
in several settings. During human pregnancy, transient or chronic
intrauterine hypoxemia may arise from maternal, placental, or fetal
causes (Hutter et al., 2010). Transient or chronic episodes of
hypoxemia are also commonly encountered in some preterm
neonates in association with critical illness, cardiopulmonary
disease, or sepsis (Martin et al., 2011). Although experimental
hypoxic preconditioning studies have demonstrated the neuro-
protective effects of a transient hypoxic exposure to subsequent
neonatal HI (Bergeron et al., 2000), our studies suggest that tran-
sient cerebral hypoxemia may also contribute to adverse neuro-
developmental outcomes by disrupting cortical connectivity at a
critical window in development through persistent functional
disturbances in activity of SPNs or other neuronal populations.
The magnitude of SPN dysmaturation was significantly related
to the nadir of systemic Hx and lactic acidosis, which suggests a role
in dendritic arborigenesis. Transient Hx in vitro disrupts long-
term neuronal activity and connectivity defined with multielec-
trode arrays (le Feber et al., 2017). Hypoxic conditions disrupt
neurite extension and axon path finding through stabilization of
Hx-inducible factor 1 (Pocock and Hobert, 2008; Miyake et al.,
2015). Recurrent moderate hypoxemia in neonatal mice caused a
wide array of behavioral disturbances (Juliano et al., 2015) but
may also be protective (Bouslama et al., 2015).
The minimum duration of transient oxygen desaturations
that may be deleterious requires further study. A deleterious role
for mild chronic hypoxemia is supported by the recent BOOST
trials, which found that infants maintained at chronically lower
oxygen saturations of 85%–89% had an increased risk of death
relative to infants administered oxygen to target saturations of
91%–95%. Another potential benefit of the avoidance of low
oxygen states during pregnancy or in preterm neonates may be to
reduce the risk of abnormal cortical connectivity related to SPN
dysmaturation. Future studies are needed to define critical devel-
opmental windows when isolated or recurrent hypoxic events
maximally impact the maturation of SPNs and potentially other
neuronal populations. It will also be important to determine
whether SPN dysmaturation may be reversible or treatable via strat-
egies that promote neuronal maturation and cerebral growth, such
as environmental enrichment, optimized neonatal nutrition, or re-
duced neonatal stress (Back and Miller, 2014).
