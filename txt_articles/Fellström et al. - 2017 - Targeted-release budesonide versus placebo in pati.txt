Summary [[Word limit: 300; Currently 300]] 
27 
Background 
28 
IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is postulated to be associated with mucosal immune system 
29 
dysfunction, manifesting as renal IgA deposition leading to impairment and end-stage renal 
30 
disease (ESRD) in 20–40% of patients over 10–20 years. The NEFIGAN trial investigated a 
31 
novel targeted-release formulation of budesonide (TRF-budesonide), designed to deliver drug 
32 
to the distal ileum in IgAN patients. 
33 
Methods 
34 
Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial: 6-month run-in, 9-month treatment, 
35 
3-month follow-up phases. TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day [n=48]; 8 mg/day [n=51]) was 
36 
compared with placebo (n=50) in patients with persistent proteinuria despite optimised 
37 
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. Endpoints included mean change from baseline in 
38 
urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) at 9 months (primary) and change in estimated 
39 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01738035. 
40 
Findings 
41 
At 9 months, mean UPCR had decreased by -24·4% with TRF-budesonide (-27·3% with 
42 
16 mg/day [p=0·0092], non-significant -21·5% with 8 mg/day [p=0·0290]), relative to +2·7% 
43 
with placebo. The effect was sustained throughout follow-up; mean UPCR decreased by -
44 
32·0% from baseline at 12 months for 16 mg/day vs. +0·5% for placebo. Over 9 months, 
45 
 3 
 
eGFR was stable with TRF-budesonide but decreased -9·8% with placebo (TRF-budesonide 
46 
vs. placebo: p=0·0010). There were dose-dependent trends in the incidence of solicited 
47 
corticosteroid-related adverse events and discontinuations, although the incidence of all 
48 
adverse events was 87·8%, 94·1%, and 84·0% with 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day, and placebo, 
49 
respectively. Two of 13 serious adverse events were possibly related to TRF-budesonide: 
50 
deep vein thrombosis (16 mg/day) and unexplained deterioration in renal function in follow-
51 
up. 
52 
Interpretation 
53 
TRF-budesonide, additional to optimised RAS blockade, reduced proteinuria and maintained 
54 
eGFR in IgAN patients. Both these effects are indicative of a reduced risk of future 
55 
progression to ESRD. These results suggest that TRF-budesonide has potential to become the 
56 
first IgAN-specific treatment targeting intestinal mucosal immunity upstream of disease 
57 
manifestation.

Introduction 
61 
Primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent chronic 
62 
glomerular disease worldwide, with patients often diagnosed as young adults.1 
63 
Approximately 20–40% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10–
64 
20 years of diagnosis.2–4 Major risk factors for progression to ESRD are persistent 
65 
proteinuria, hypertension, and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR).1,3,5,6 KDIGO 
66 
guidelines for glomerulonephritis recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade 
67 
utilizing angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
68 
(ARBs) as first-line treatment for IgAN patients with proteinuria >1 g/day (recommendation 
69 
level 1B), and suggest up-titration as far as tolerated up to the maximum recommended dose 
70 
to achieve proteinuria <1 g/day (recommendation level 2D).7 For patients with persistent 
71 
proteinuria >1 g/day and GFR >50 mL/min/1·73 m2 despite 6 months’ optimised RAS 
72 
blockade, KDIGO suggest 6 months’ treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids 
73 
(recommendation level 2C).7 However, use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids is 
74 
associated with increased risks of adverse events and sequelae including serious infections, 
75 
hypertension, weight gain, diabetes, and osteoporosis.8–10 The benefit of systemic 
76 
immunosuppression, in addition to the intervention of dietary restrictions and polypharmacy 
77 
upon optimised RAS blockade has recently been questioned in the STOP-IgAN trial.11 
78 
Notwithstanding, there is an unmet need for a targeted treatment with a favourable 
79 
risk-benefit profile in IgAN patients at risk of progression to ESRD.  
80 
Evidence suggests a role for the mucosal immune system in the pathogenesis of IgAN.1,12,13 
81 
In IgAN patients, mucosal B lymphocytes located in Peyer’s patches are thought to be primed 
82 
to produce IgA1 that is galactose deficient (Gd-IgA1), which in the circulation can form large 
83 
immune complexes with anti-glycan IgG antibodies.1,14–16 These complexes may bind to 
84 
 5 
 
glomerular mesangial cells and stimulate cell proliferation, release of inflammatory mediators 
85 
that promote proteinuria, and fibrotic remodelling, ultimately leading to loss of renal 
86 
function.1,15 This pathogenesis suggests that local immunosuppression of mucosal B 
87 
lymphocyte activation and proliferation in Peyer’s patches could attenuate Gd-IgA1 
88 
production,17 thereby reducing subsequent pathophysiological changes, assessed as a 
89 
reduction in protein excretion by the kidneys.  
90 
A novel, oral, targeted-release formulation of the glucocorticosteroid budesonide 
91 
(TRF-budesonide; NEFECON™ [Pharmalink AB, Stockholm, Sweden]) was developed to 
92 
release drug in the distal ileum, where Peyer’s patches reside at high density. The safety 
93 
profile of TRF-budesonide was anticipated to be superior to high-dose systemic 
94 
corticosteroids because of its extensive first pass metabolism: less than 10% of budesonide 
95 
enters systemic circulation.18 In a previous exploratory phase 2a trial, 16 IgAN patients 
96 
received TRF-budesonide (8 mg/day). Treatment over 6 months resulted in a statistically 
97 
significant reduction in proteinuria and was well-tolerated.19 The objective of the current 
98 
phase 2b trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of TRF-budesonide in 
99 
IgAN patients at risk of progressing to ESRD due to persistent proteinuria despite optimised 
100 
RAS blockade therapy.  
101

Methods 
103 
Trial design 
104 
The NEFIGAN trial was randomised, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled in patients with 
105 
biopsy-confirmed primary IgAN and overt proteinuria considered at risk of progressing to 
106 
ESRD. This phase 2b trial was conducted at 62 sites across 10 European countries (Belgium, 
107 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands, UK; 
108 
see the Supplementary Appendix). Concerned competent authorities and ethics committees 
109 
for participating centres approved the trial, which was conducted from December 2012 to 
110 
June 2015 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, 2008. 
111 
Patients 
112 
Male and female patients aged ≥18 years with biopsy-confirmed primary IgAN and overt 
113 
proteinuria were eligible for the run-in phase. All patients provided written informed consent 
114 
prior to enrolment. Inclusion criteria for randomisation to treatment included 
115 
eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1·73 m2 and a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥0·5 g/g or urinary 
116 
total protein ≥0·75 g/day, levels considered to increase risk of progressing to ESRD.20 The 
117 
approach of using either 24 hour protein excretion or UPCR to determine eligibility was 
118 
applied to overcome collection errors and deviations from normal creatinine excretion (eg 
119 
physically active and muscular males), respectively, thus minimizingthe risk of unintentional 
120 
exclusion of patients. Eligibility criteria are presented in Table S1.  
121 
Procedures 
122 
Trial medication was an oral capsule formulation of TRF-budesonide (NEFECON™; 
123 
Pharmalink AB, Stockholm, Sweden) or placebo, designed to provide sustained release of 
124 
 7 
 
active compound that was delayed until the capsule reached the distal ileum,21 targeting 
125 
where Peyer’s patches reside at high density.  
126 
After screening, eligible patients were enrolled into a 6-month run-in phase, a 9-month 
127 
treatment phase, and a 3-month follow-up phase; patient eligibility was assessed prior to 
128 
run-in and treatment phases. During run-in, RAS blockade was optimised by up-titrating 
129 
ACEIs and/or ARBs to a maximum recommended or tolerated dose, to a target blood 
130 
pressure <130/80 mmHg, UPCR <0·5 g/g, and urine protein <0·75 g/day. At the end of 
131 
run-in, patients with persistent proteinuria (UPCR ≥0·5 g/g or proteinuria ≥0·75 g/day) 
132 
despite optimised RAS blockade, estimated GFR (eGFR [CKD-EPI serum creatinine 
133 
equation22]) or measured GFR ≥45 mL/min/1·73 m2, and blood pressure ≤160/100 mmHg 
134 
were eligible for randomisation to treatment. Run-in phase directives are detailed in the 
135 
Supplementary Appendix. 
136 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitored all safety issues and 
137 
reviewed data at interim analysis. 
138 
Randomisation and masking 
139 
Patients were stratified according to baseline UPCR (≤0·9 g/g and >0·9 g/g) at Month 0 
140 
(baseline). Allocation of patients to treatment groups was done by randomisation using the 
141 
method of randomly permuted blocks. Within each block, patients were allocated in a 1:1:1 
142 
ratio to TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day, or placebo. All patients continued optimised 
143 
RAS blockade treatment throughout the trial. Randomisation was performed by Pharma 
144 
Consulting Group AB, Uppsala, Sweden. 
145 
 8 
 
The trial was double-blind and the allocation to treatment groups was, therefore, unknown to 
146 
the patient, the investigator, the sponsor, or the monitor. The sponsor and investigators were 
147 
fully blinded to randomised treatment assignment and the pre-planned interim analysis.  
148 
To ensure blinding, placebo capsules were used with the same appearance and route of 
149 
administration as the active capsules. Patients self-administered blinded capsules, once daily, 
150 
1 hour before breakfast during the treatment phase. During follow-up (Months 9–12), patients 
151 
who received TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day during Months 0–9 were tapered to 8 mg/day for 
152 
2 weeks while all other patients (ie, those who received TRF-budesonide 8 mg/day or placebo 
153 
during Months 0–9) received placebo to maintain blinding. No further trial medication was 
154 
administered after tapering. 
155 
Treatment code envelopes were provided for each randomised patient. In case of emergency, 
156 
the code envelope could be opened. Any unblinded patient had to be withdrawn from the 
157 
trial. 
158 
Outcomes 
159 
The primary outcome was mean change from baseline in UPCR over the 9-month treatment 
160 
phase. The primary analysis compared mean change from baseline in UPCR at 9 months 
161 
between TRF-budesonide-treated patients (16 mg/day and 8 mg/day combined) and 
162 
placebo-treated patients.  
163 
Key secondary and tertiary outcomes, assessed at various time points, included mean changes 
164 
from baseline in eGFR; UPCR, 24-hour urine protein, urine albumin creatinine ratio 
165 
(UACR), and 24-hour urine albumin were calculated from measured 24-hour urine samples; 
166 
the presence or absence of microhaematuria, assessed by dipstick. 
167 
 9 
 
Standardised questionnaires were used at each visit to ask patients about the presence of 
168 
specific gastrointestinal-related and corticosteroid-related adverse events. All solicited and 
169 
spontaneously-reported adverse events were recorded from screening until the end of trial, 
170 
and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 16·0E). Vital 
171 
signs, clinical chemistry, and haematology parameters were assessed.  
172 
Statistical analysis 
173 
Individual patient data from other relevant studies were used to estimate UPCR variability 
174 
and the expected change from baseline at 9 months for placebo.23,24  The geometric mean 
175 
ratio of 9 month:baseline UPCR values was 0·88 (log standard deviation [SD]: 0·597). The 
176 
corresponding geometric mean ratio for TRF-budesonide was estimated from a previous 
177 
exploratory phase 2a trial19 as 0·60 (log SD: 0·488). Sample size calculations were based on 
178 
the hypothesis that the true difference between TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day and 8 mg/day 
179 
combined) and placebo in log UPCR change from baseline was log(0·60) - log(0·88) 
180 
corresponding to an absolute difference of (1-0·6) - (1-0·88) = 28%. A trial with 150 patients 
181 
(50 per treatment arm) provided more than 90% power to detect this level of treatment effect 
182 
for TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day and 8 mg/day combined) vs. placebo at the one-sided 2.5% 
183 
alpha level.  
184 
The primary outcome (mean change from baseline in UPCR over the 9-month treatment 
185 
phase) was assessed on the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all randomised patients who 
186 
took at least one dose of trial medication and had at least one post-dose efficacy measurement 
187 
(modified intention-to-treat analysis). A formal interim analysis governed by the DSMB was 
188 
prospectively planned for when 90 patients completed 9 months’ treatment, while the other 
189 
patients in the FAS had entered the study but had not reached 9 months. Thus data from all 
190 
randomised patients in the FAS, regardless of whether they had reach 9 months, was included 
191 
 10 
 
in the interim analysis, which was analysed using a mixed model repeated measures 
192 
(MMRM) model. The threshold for significance for TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day and 
193 
8 mg/day) vs. placebo on the primary outcome was 1·58% one-sided; futility could also be 
194 
declared if predictive power was ≤5%. The alpha level applied at final analysis was 1·52% 
195 
one-sided to ensure an overall Type I error rate of 2·5% one-sided. 
196 
It was prospectively planned that if statistical significance for the primary outcome was met 
197 
during the interim analysis: (a) the trial would continue; and (b) that during the final analysis 
198 
(after all patients had completed the trial), confirmation of the interim analysis result would 
199 
be gained by analysing the mean change from baseline in UPCR over the 9-month treatment 
200 
and 3-month follow-up phases.  
201 
All secondary and tertiary endpoints were analysed during the final analysis. It was 
202 
prospectively planned that all secondary and tertiary comparisons between treatment groups 
203 
could only be made if statistical significance for the primary outcome was met during the 
204 
interim analysis. 
205 
The following post-hoc analysis was defined after the interim analysis, and before the final 
206 
database lock: The treatment effects on UPCR and eGFR CKD-EPI as a function of baseline 
207 
UPCR and eGFR. 
208 
All efficacy data were analysed using MMRM analysis with fixed effect terms for baseline 
209 
log UPCR, randomised treatment group, UPCR stratification level, visit, and visit by 
210 
treatment group interaction. Subject and region were included as random effects. Region was 
211 
defined on the country level, although Denmark was combined with Sweden (region = 
212 
Scandinavia) and Belgium with the Netherlands (region = Benelux) due to small patient 
213 
numbers per country. 
214 
 11 
 
Statistical analyses were performed by Scandinavian Development Services AB, Sweden, 
215 
using SAS® (Version 9·3).

Results 
232 
In total, 297 patients were screened between December 11, 2012, and December 26, 2013, 
233 
and 207 patients were enrolled into the run-in phase. Following run-in, all patients eligible for 
234 
randomisation to treatment were receiving either a maximum tolerated or maximum 
235 
recommended dose of ACEIs and/or ARBs. A total of 150 randomised patients received 
236 
blinded trial medication; 149 comprised the FAS (one patient was unable to swallow 
237 
capsules) (Figure 1 and Table S2). Trial drug exposure is described in the Supplementary 
238 
Appendix. Treatment groups (TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day, and placebo) were 
239 
well-balanced regarding demographic and baseline characteristics, with all patients using 
240 
RAS blockade therapy (Table 1). Patients maintained optimised RAS blockade treatment 
241 
throughout the trial. In a minority of patients, changes in dose or drug were made in RAS 
242 
blockade (17 [11·3%] patients]) or diuretics (10 [6·7%] patients]). The frequencies of 
243 
changes were comparable across the TRF-budesonide and placebo treatment groups (Table 
244 
S3).  
245 
In the pre-planned interim analysis shown in Figure 2A, the primary outcome of geometric 
246 
LS mean UPCR at 9 months was reduced from baseline by 24·4% (absolute change in UPCR 
247 
to be presented) in all TRF-budesonide-treated patients combined versus an increase of 2·7% 
248 
(absolute change in UPCR to be presented) in placebo-treated patients and the difference was 
249 
statistically significant (p=0·0066) (Figure 2A; Note: all point estimates and 95% CIs in the 
250 
following are presented in Table S4). Hence, the primary objective of the trial was met and 
251 
the corresponding null hypotheses rejected. Geometric LS mean changes from baseline 
252 
were -27·3% for TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day and -21·5% for 8 mg/day. The difference in 
253 
UPCR at 9 months was statistically significant for TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day vs. placebo 
254 
(p=0·0092), but not 8 mg/day vs. placebo (p=0·0290), which did not meet the adjusted p-
255 
 13 
 
value at interim analysis (p≤0·0158). Change in UPCR from baseline at 9 months in the final 
256 
analysis was consistent with the change in the interim analysis (Figure 2A) and is presented 
257 
as absolute mean change in UPCR from baseline across the 12 months of the randomized 
258 
portion of the study (Figure 2B).  
259 
In addition to the interim analysis performed when 90 patients had completed  9 months’ 
260 
treatment, a final analysis was also performed when all patients had completed the trial. In 
261 
this final analysis, when assessed as a secondary outcome, reduction in UPCR at 9 months vs. 
262 
baseline showed TRF-budesonide had a consistent effect on the relative change in UPCR 
263 
regardless of baseline UPCR levels (Figure S1). Upon completion of the 3-month follow-up, 
264 
the geometric LS mean reduction in UPCR was sustained in the TRF-budesonide 8 mg/day 
265 
group (-22·6% change versus baseline) and continued to decrease in the 16 mg/day group 
266 
(-32·0% change versus baseline) vs. an increase of 0·5% for placebo. Compared to placebo, 
267 
the changes for both active treatment groups were statistically significant (16 mg/day vs. 
268 
placebo, p=0.0005; 8 mg/day vs. placebo, p=0·010). Changes in 24-hour protein excretion, 
269 
UACR, and 24-hour albumin excretion were consistent with the UPCR data (data not shown). 
270 
eGFR remained stable in the TRF-budesonide groups but decreased in the placebo-treated 
271 
group during the treatment phase in the final analysis, as shown by percent changes at 
272 
9 months (Figure 3A) and by absolute mean changes in eGFR from baseline across the 12 
273 
months (Figure 3B). Mean percent change from baseline in eGFR at 9 months was -9·8% for 
274 
placebo, +0·6% for 16 mg/day, and -0·9% for 8 mg/day (Figure 3A). Comparisons with 
275 
placebo achieved statistical significance at 9 months (16 mg/day vs. placebo: p=0·0026; 
276 
8 mg/day vs. placebo: p=0·0064). Exploratory post-hoc analyses suggested that stabilisation 
277 
of eGFR in TRF-budesonide-treated groups was independent of baseline UPCR and eGFR 
278 
values, and that the degree of eGFR reduction in the placebo group appeared related to the

magnitude of baseline UPCR (Figure S1). eGFR levels in the TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day 
280 
group were sustained throughout the trial (mean percent change from baseline at 
281 
12 months: -0·7vs. -10·9% for placebo; p=0·0134). 
282 
When assessed as a tertiary outcome in the final analysis, the proportion of patients with 
283 
microhaematuria in the TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day group decreased from 87·5% (n=42 of 
284 
48) at baseline to 43·8% (n=21 of 48) at 9 months, and was statistically significant versus 
285 
placebo (74·0% [n=37 of 50] of placebo-treated at 9 months, 95%CI 0.072-0.675, OR 0.221, 
286 
p=0·0041) but remained unchanged in the 8 mg/day-and placebo-treated groups.  
287 
There were no deaths and no patient progressed to ESRD. Fourteen patients 
288 
(TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, n=3; 8 mg/day, n=4; placebo, n=7) reported 
289 
treatment-emergent adverse events associated with worsening of renal function and/or 
290 
received high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy.  
291 
Eleven patients reported 13 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (Table S5). Two were 
292 
considered possibly related to TRF-budesonide by investigators blinded to study treatment: 
293 
deep vein thrombosis (16 mg/day), and unexplained worsening of renal function, reported 
294 
during follow-up after tapering from 16 mg/day to 8 mg/day. Two serious adverse events in 
295 
the placebo-treated group were considered possibly related to trial medication: both cases of 
296 
increased proteinuria, one with a decline in renal function (see the Supplementary Appendix 
297 
for details on adverse event reporting). 
298 
The total incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across treatment groups 
299 
(Table 2). The most frequently reported adverse event, nasopharyngitis, was reported by 
300 
similar percentages of patients in each group. There were no statistically significant changes 
301 
from baseline in body weight, blood pressure, or glycated haemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) values in 
302 
either TRF-budesonide group vs. placebo at end of treatment (Table S6, post-hoc analysis). 
303 
 15 
 
Two patients receiving TRF-budesonide, both with a body mass index of 36 kg/m2 at 
304 
baseline, exhibited increases in HbA1c into the diabetic range (≥48 mmol/mol) at the end of 
305 
treatment or during follow-up (Table S6 footnote for details). There were no other clinically 
306 
relevant changes in clinical chemistry variables in any treatment group (see the adverse event 
307 
reporting section of the Supplementary Appendix for the list of clinical chemistry variables 
308 
investigated). The incidence of gastrointestinal-related adverse events was similar in 
309 
TRF-budesonide-treated and placebo-treated patients (Table S7). 
310 
Solicited corticosteroid-related adverse events were more frequently reported by 
311 
TRF-budesonide-treated patients (Table S8). Eighteen patients experienced adverse events 
312 
that led to discontinuation of treatment (n=11 in the 16 mg/day group, n=5 in the 8 mg/day 
313 
group, n=2 in the placebo group). The majority of patients who discontinued in the 
314 
TRF-budesonide groups experienced corticosteroid-related adverse events (Table S9).

Discussion 
316 
We report the results of the NEFIGAN trial in which 9 months’ treatment with 
317 
TRF-budesonide resulted in a statistically significant reduction in UPCR vs. placebo in 
318 
patients with primary IgAN. This primary outcome was met in a pre-specified interim 
319 
analysis of data from the FAS population. The effect of TRF-budesonide was shown to be 
320 
dose- and time-dependent. Upon completion of the 3 month follow up, the mean percent 
321 
reduction in UPCR was sustained in the TRF budesonide 8 mg/day group and continued to 
322 
decrease in the 16 mg/day group. This persistence of effect following cessation of treatment 
323 
is suggestive of a disease-modifying effect. There is a growing body of evidence and general 
324 
acceptance that a reduction in proteinuria is associated with a reduced risk of ESRD in IgAN 
325 
patients, and time-averaged (TA)-proteinuria is predictive of renal survival in IgAN patients: 
326 
the rate of decline of renal function and subsequent risk of renal failure are associated with 
327 
higher levels of TA-proteinuria.5,20 A recent meta-analysis of IgAN trials used contemporary 
328 
statistical methodology to assess the possible surrogacy of the effect of treatment intervention 
329 
(RAS blockade, fish oil, immunosuppression, and steroids) on proteinuria at 9 months to 
330 
predict the effect of the intervention on ESRD clinical outcome. The analysis showed a 
331 
statistically significant association, suggesting that an improvement in proteinuria at 9 months 
332 
for drug compared to control would be positively associated with an improvement in longer 
333 
term ESRD outcome.25  
334 
Patients entering the treatment phase of this trial were at risk of progression to ESRD due to 
335 
persistent proteinuria despite optimised RAS blockade. The further reduction in proteinuria 
336 
was achieved by targeting an alternative pharmacological mechanism, and was attributable to 
337 
TRF-budesonide, irrespective of baseline UPCR, eGFR and time since diagnosis of IgAN ( 
338 
Fig S1D). Our findings support the generally accepted hypothesis that mucosal immune 
339 
 17 
 
system dysfunction has a significant role in the pathogenesis of IgAN, as TRF-budesonide 
340 
targets the region of the gastrointestinal tract where Peyer’s patches reside at high density.  
341 
eGFR declined in the placebo-treated group but remained stable in the TRF-budesonide 
342 
groups following 9 months’ treatment, an effect that persisted throughout follow-up in the 16 
343 
mg/day group. Stabilisation of eGFR in IgAN patients is likely to predict a favourable 
344 
outcome. It should be noted that RAS blockade therapy remained optimised throughout the 
345 
trial, with no dose changes during the treatment phase, except in a small number of 
346 
individuals (dose of RAS blockade was increased for 5/150 patients and decreased for 6/150 
347 
patients), distributed across the 3 treatment groups (see Table S3). Despite the rigorous 
348 
maintenance of RAS blockade, the rapid rate of loss of eGFR observed in the placebo-treated 
349 
group was greater than that seen in the recently reported STOP-IGAN study11 but consistent 
350 
with other studies of IgAN in patients receiving optimised RAS blockade, albeit with 
351 
generally higher levels of baseline proteinuria.24,26 Of note, posthoc analysis demonstrated 
352 
that eGFR reduction in the placebo group was  related to  baseline proteinuria (Fig S1B), ( 
353 
but not to baseline  blood pressure ? (not shown) ?Is this correct ? I did not see any 
354 
stat.analysis on that ? ) As histology data are not available for all of these studies, it is 
355 
difficult to speculate on the contribution of histopathological changes to rate of eGFR 
356 
decline. However, the deterioration in eGFR illustrates that this patient population is at risk of 
357 
disease progression, current standard-of-care therapy is insufficient, and there is a need for 
358 
further intervention in IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria.  
359 
High-dose systemic corticosteroids and other potent immunosuppressive treatments have 
360 
been studied in a number of randomised controlled trials with varying results.27 A 
361 
consequence of these trials has been the necessity to test interventions with a background of 
362 
optimised standard-of-care RAS blockade, as has been conducted in this trial. This has also 
363 
been applied in the TESTING trial, a randomised controlled trial evaluating high-dose 
364 
 18 
 
systemic corticosteroid therapy vs. placebo (recruitment was stopped early and randomised 
365 
treatment discontinued due to safety concerns, interim results published)32, and in the STOP-
366 
IgAN trial.11 The STOP-IgAN trial assessed the potential benefit of systemic 
367 
immunosuppression in addition to the intervention of dietary restrictions and polypharmacy 
368 
upon optimised RAS blockade, and is the first study in IgAN to employ such comprehensive 
369 
supportive care. No difference in the rate of decrease in eGFR was observed between groups 
370 
over the 3-year period of the STOP-IgAN trial.11 The slow annual loss of eGFR in the 
371 
intensive supportive care group (1·6 mL/min/1·73 m2) suggests that further interventions, in 
372 
addition to optimised RAS blockade, retards the loss of renal function.11 
373 
TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the presence of 
374 
microhaematuria at 9 months vs. placebo. Although the prognostic significance of haematuria 
375 
disappearance in IgAN has not been prospectively investigated, clinical and experimental 
376 
studies suggest that haematuria is associated with glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage in 
377 
IgAN and other glomerular diseases.28,29 
378 
In the present trial, TRF-budesonide appeared to be safe and generally well-tolerated, 
379 
although there was a dose-dependent trend in the incidence of solicited corticosteroid-related 
380 
adverse events and in discontinuations due to these events (see Tables S8 and S9). 
381 
Budesonide, administered as a targeted-release oral dosage form, is subject to high first-pass 
382 
metabolism, resulting in low systemic exposure (approximately 10% of administered dose).18 
383 
Some degree of systemic exposure is reflected in reduced cortisol excretion (data not shown) 
384 
and the aforementioned dose-dependent trend in the incidence of solicited 
385 
corticosteroid-related adverse events. However, several studies have reported higher 
386 
incidences of diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, and weight gain 
387 
in high-dose systemic corticosteroid-treated patients.11,30 Furthermore, increased incidences 
388 
 19 
 
of serious and fatal infections were documented with high-dose systemic immunosuppressive 
389 
therapy in the STOP-IgAN trial11 and TESTING trial32. In contrast, no serious infections 
390 
were attributed to TRF-budesonide in the NEFIGAN trial and there were no statistically 
391 
significant changes in blood pressure, HbA1c, or body weight with TRF-budesonide vs. 
392 
placebo. There was a trend for numerically higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels 
393 
in the TRF-budesonide 16 mg group at the end of treatment compared to baseline values, but 
394 
this was not statistically significant (Table S6). The NEFIGAN trial data indicate that 
395 
TRF-budesonide may elicit fewer and less severe systemic effects and has a preferable 
396 
tolerability profile than previously reported for high-dose systemic corticosteroid regimens, 
397 
when used to treat IgAN patients at risk of progression to ESRD, many of whom are young 
398 
adults.11,30  However, this needs to be confirmed in larger studies than the current phase 2b 
399 
trial. 
400 
Proteinuria is a major risk factor for renal failure in IgAN.3,5 As addressed by Rauen et al.,11 
401 
in the past, clinically significant proteinuria has been arbitrarily defined as an excretion level 
402 
greater than 1 g/day (KDIGO guidelines).7 However, evidence from epidemiology studies 
403 
indicate that IgAN patients with proteinuria of 0·5 to 1 g/day are at increased risk of renal 
404 
failure.20,31 Thus, to evaluate TRF-budesonide in a clinically relevant high-risk IgAN 
405 
population, a proteinuria threshold of either 0·75 g/day or 0·5 g/g UPCR (on a 24-hour 
406 
collection) was selected. A threshold level of 0·75 g/day was similarly applied in the recently 
407 
reported STOP-IgAN trial. 
408 
The primary objective of this trial was to assess the effect of TRF-budesonide on UPCR, a 
409 
proteinuria-based measure and surrogate endpoint for renal failure. While both a reduction in 
410 
UPCR and stabilisation of eGFR were demonstrated, it will be necessary to quantify the 
411 
magnitude of relative risk reduction associated with TRF-budesonide-treatment in IgAN 
412 
 20 
 
patients at risk of progression to ESRD in a larger trial of longer duration. Another limitation 
413 
of the present trial is that the patient population treated was almost exclusively Caucasian. In 
414 
addition, allowing entry of patients in to the study regardless of time since biopsy, led to a 
415 
lack of availability of recent histopathology data on all patients prior to randomization 
416 
prevented the implementation of a stratification strategy to discount imbalance of renal 
417 
histology score as a potential confounder. However, in a post-hoc analysis, a consistent effect 
418 
on relative change in UPCR at 9 months was observed regardless of time from diagnosis 
419 
(Figure S1d) indicating that this did not affect the results. There are also no published 
420 
pharmacokinetic data for TRF-budesonide in patients with IgAN. Patients with severe hepatic 
421 
impairment were excluded from the study but it is unknown if IgAN patients may be subject 
422 
to higher systemic exposure due to increased mucosal GI absorption. There is evidence of 
423 
increased exposure of budesonide in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (range 11-21% 
424 
vs.9-12% in healthy volunteers) but that systemic exposure normalises after 8 weeks of 
425 
treatment33. Nevertheless, this trial is one of the largest randomised controlled trials 
426 
conducted in IgAN in which RAS blockade was optimised prior to adjunct therapy. 
427 
This trial demonstrated that 9 months’ treatment with TRF-budesonide resulted in reduced 
428 
proteinuria and stabilised eGFR in IgAN patients at risk of progression to ESRD. The 
429 
observed effect was additive to optimised RAS blockade and supports the use of 
430 
TRF-budesonide as adjunct therapy in IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria. 
431 
TRF-budesonide has the potential to become the first disease-specific treatment for IgAN, 
432 
with a risk-benefit profile supportive of its use early in the course of disease. 
433 
Research in context 
434 
Evidence before this trial 
435 
 21 
 
We searched PubMed up to April 26, 2016, for published papers about NEFECON using the 
436 
following search terms (with no language restrictions): “targeted-release”, “budesonide”, 
437 
“TRF-budesonide”, and “NEFECON”. We identified one relevant paper. In 2011, Smerud 
438 
and colleagues19 reported an open-label, uncontrolled, exploratory phase 2a trial, in which 16 
439 
IgAN patients received TRF-budesonide. Treatment over 6 months resulted in a statistically 
440 
significant reduction in proteinuria and was well tolerated.19  
441 
Added value of this trial 
442 
To date, the current phase 2b trial is the only randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
443 
trial to investigate and demonstrate that TRF-budesonide, additional to optimised RAS 
444 
blockade, reduced proteinuria and stabilised eGFR in IgAN patients at risk of progression to 
445 
ESRD. At 9 months, mean UPCR had decreased by 24·4% in all TRF budesonide-treated 
446 
patients combined versus an increase of 2·7% in placebo-treated patients (combined TRF 
447 
budesonide vs. placebo: p=0·0066). The effect was sustained throughout follow-up for 
448 
16 mg/day; mean UPCR decreased 32·0% from baseline at 12 months vs. 0·5% for placebo. 
449 
Over 9 months, eGFR was stable with TRF-budesonide but decreased 9·8% with placebo 
450 
(combined TRF-budesonide vs. placebo:, p=0·0010). Both these effects are indicative of a 
451 
reduced risk of future progression to ESRD.  
452 
Implications of all the available evidence 
453 
TRF-budesonide has the potential to become the first IgAN-specific treatment targeting 
454 
intestinal mucosal immunity upstream of disease manifestation, reducing the risk of 
455 
progression to ESRD.

Figure 2: Change in UPCR from baseline 
Panel A shows the percent change in UPCR from baseline in patients after receiving placebo 
or TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day and 8 mg/day combined, 16 mg/day, and 8 mg/day) for 
9 months at the interim analysis (primary outcome). The comparisons of TRF-budesonide 16 
mg/day and 8 mg/day combined and 16 mg/day with placebo were statistically significant, 
but not 8 mg/day vs. placebo (p=0·0290). Panel B shows the absolute mean change in UPCR 
from baseline in patients receiving TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day, or placebo over 
the 9 month treatment phase (solid line) and 3 month follow-up phase (dashed line). 
UPCR=urine protein creatinine ratio. Data are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean. 
In both panels, the changes in UPCR are based on data from all 149 patients in the FAS. 
Figure 3: Change in eGFR from baseline  
Panel A shows the percent change in eGFR CKD-EPI from baseline in patients after 
receiving placebo or TRF-budesonide (16 mg/day and 8 mg/day combined, 16 mg/day, and 8 
mg/day) for 9 months. The comparisons of TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day and 8 mg/day 
combined, 16 mg/day, and 8 mg/day with placebo were statistically significant. Panel B 
shows the absolute mean change in eGFR CKD-EPI from baseline in patients receiving 
TRF-budesonide 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day or placebo over the 9 month treatment phase (solid 
line) and 3 month follow-up phase (dashed line). CKD-EPI=chronic kidney disease
