BACKGROUND: The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) 
(Abbott) is a centrifugal, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood 
pump engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce shear stress on 
blood components. The MOMENTUM 3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev 
Technology in Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy 
With HeartMate 3) compares the HM3 LVAS with the HeartMate II (HMII) 
LVAS (Abbott) in advanced heart failure refractory to medical management, 
irrespective of therapeutic intention (bridge to transplant versus destination 
therapy). This investigation reported its primary outcome in the short-term 
cohort (n=294; 6-month follow-up), demonstrating superiority of the HM3 for 
the trial primary end point (survival free of a disabling stroke or reoperation to 
replace the pump for malfunction), driven by a reduced need for reoperations. 
The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the aggregate of hemocompatibility-
related clinical adverse events (HRAEs) between the 2 LVAS.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary end point evaluation of HRAE 
(survival free of any nonsurgical bleeding, thromboembolic event, pump 
thrombosis, or neurological event) in the short-term cohort (as-treated 
cohort n=289) at 6 months. The net burden of HRAE was also assessed 
by using a previously described hemocompatibility score, which uses 4 
escalating tiers of hierarchal severity to derive a total score for events 
encountered during the entire follow-up experience for each patient.
RESUL
TS: In 289 patients in the as-treated group (151 the HM3 and 138 the 
HMII), survival free of any HRAE was achieved in 69% of the HM3 group and 
in 55% of the HMII group (hazard ratio, 0.62; confidence interval, 0.42–0.91; 
P=0.012). Using the hemocompatibility score, the HM3 group demonstrated 
less pump thrombosis requiring reoperation (0 versus 36 points, P<0.001) or 
medically managed pump thrombosis (0 versus 5 points, P=0.02), and fewer 
nondisabling strokes (6 versus 24 points, P=0.026) than the control HMII 
LVAS. The net hemocompatibility score in the HM3 in comparison with the HMII 
patients was 101 (0.67±1.50 points/patient) versus 137 (0.99±1.79 points/
patient) (odds ratio, 0.64; confidence interval, 0.39–1.03; P=0.065).
CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, the 
HM3 LVAS demonstrated greater freedom from HRAEs in comparison with 
the HMII LVAS at 6 months.

H
emocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAEs) 
are the Achilles heel of the interaction between 
a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) and its 
biological circulatory interface.1 The constellation of 
device-related hemolysis, pump thrombosis leading to 
malfunction, neurological events (predominantly stroke 
and bleeding), and nonsurgical bleeding (particularly 
gastrointestinal bleeding) are the principal concerns that 
influence outcomes in mechanical circulatory support. 
These frequent complications are noted to occur with all 
contemporary centrifugal and axial continuous-flow de-
vices, the HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare International Inc) 
and the HeartMate II (HMII) (Abbott) LVAS, respectively.2,3
The HeartMate 3 (HM3) LVAS (Abbott) is a continu-
ous-flow centrifugal pump, with a fully magnetically levi-
tated rotor, wide blood flow passages, and an intrinsic 
pulse designed to avert stasis within the pump.4 This 
novel LVAS is currently being evaluated in a prospective, 
randomized, controlled trial comparing it with the HMII 
pump in patients with advanced heart failure who are re-
fractory to optimal medical therapy (MOMENTUM 3 trial 
[Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in Patients Un-
dergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support Therapy With 
HeartMate 3]).5 The primary analysis of the short-term 
cohort in this study (n=294 [intention-to-treat popula-
tion], 6-month follow-up) was recently published.6 In this 
analysis, the HM3 LVAS demonstrated superiority to the 
HMII for the primary end point of survival free of disabling 
stroke or reoperation for pump replacement. Although 
clearly focusing on the most severe complications of 
LVAS, such an end point may underappreciate the total-
ity of HRAEs encountered in the experiential journey.1
The purpose of this secondary analysis is severalfold: 
(1) to compare outcomes between the HM3 and HMII 
LVAS, when all HRAEs are evaluated as an efficacy end 
point, (2) to assess the aggregate net burden of HRAEs 
encountered within and between each device system, 
and (3) to explore hypothesis-generating clinical corre-
lates predictive of HRAE that may inform further studies.
METHODS
MOMENTUM 3 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-
blinded, pivotal clinical trial comparing the HM3 with the HMII 
LVAS in patients who have advanced-stage heart failure, and its 
design has been previously described.5 Eligible patients (bridge 
to transplant or destination therapy) were randomly assigned 
1:1 to receive either the HM3 or the HMII LVAS. The primary 
end point of the trial was survival free of disabling stroke, 
and reoperation to repair or replace the device, assessed at 
6 months and 2 years postimplantation. This adaptive design 
trial has completed enrollment (n=1028 patients) at 69 US 
sites, and comprises 3 specific patient cohorts:
1. Short-Term Cohort: The first 294 patients enrolled into 
the trial, where the primary end point (powered for non-
inferiority) was compared between the 2 devices at 
6-months follow-up by intention-to-treat. The primary out-
comes, which demonstrated noninferiority and superior-
ity, as well, of the HM3 LVAS, have been reported.6
2. Long-Term Cohort: The first 366 patients (including the 
294 in the Short-Term Cohort), where the primary end 
point (powered for noninferiority) will be (still ongoing) 
compared between the 2 devices at 2 years.
3. Extended Long-Term Cohort: The full cohort of 1028 
patients (including the Long-Term Cohort), where the pri-
mary goal is to demonstrate superiority of the HM3 on 
the secondary end point of pump malfunction requiring 
replacement (ongoing).
Each participating center’s institutional review board 
approved the protocol and all patients or their authorized 
representative provided written informed consent. Predefined 
adverse events, reoperations, readmissions to the hospital, 
and device malfunctions were reported as they occurred. 
Centers entered data into a validated Internet-based electronic 
data capture system that is compliant with Title 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 11 (21 CFR Part 11). Site users were 
permitted only data entry rights to use the system, and only 
after database training was completed. An independent clinical 
events committee blinded to the randomization adjudicated all 
key events. They also adjudicated the severity and device rela-
tionship of these adverse events. An independent data safety 
and monitoring board performed regular review of the clinical 
safety data. Antithrombotic management included anticoagula-
tion with warfarin (with a targeted international normalized ratio 
[INR] of 2.0–3.0) and aspirin therapy (81–325 mg daily) for 
both groups.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Hemocompatibility with a left ventricular assist 
system refers to the constellation of bleeding and 
thrombosis events that often aggregate together in 
the same individual. 
• This 6-month secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 
3 trial (Multicenter Study of MagLev Technology in 
Patients Undergoing Mechanical Circulatory Support 
Therapy With HeartMate 3) compares the HeartMate 
3 with the HeartMate II pump and demonstrates that 
the HeartMate 3 pump is superior in reducing hemo-
compatibility-related adverse outcomes (driven by 
absent pump thrombosis and decreased nondis-
abling strokes) at 6 months.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• We now provide quantitative estimates of freedom 
from hemocompatibility-related adverse events 
between the 2 pumps (at 6 months) and suggest 
exploratory findings of clinical correlates in the 
hemostatic management axis that may warrant pro-
spective confirmation. 
• Importantly, we define a new score of the burden 
of hemocompatibility that can serve to standardize 
assessment of aggregate patient-level outcomes 
across various device platforms.

Hemocompatibility-Related Adverse Event 
In this secondary analysis, clinical adverse events attributable 
to LVAS-related bleeding or thrombosis abnormalities were 
classified as an HRAE. These events were:
• Nonsurgical bleeding: Gastrointestinal or other nonsurgi-
cal bleeding episodes >30 days postimplant
• Neurological events: Stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic, 
disabling or nondisabling) or other neurological events 
(eg, transient ischemic attack, seizures) at any time
• Thromboembolic events: Suspected or confirmed pump 
thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism with or without 
organ involvement at any time
A patient experiencing any of these events was deemed to 
have experienced an HRAE.
Hemocompatibility Score
To determine the aggregate net burden of HRAE in each 
patient, a tiered hierarchal score (hemocompatibility score 
[HCS]) that weights each event by its escalating clinical 
relevance was calculated for each patient as previously 
described.1 The methodology for calculating the score is pro-
vided in Table 1. In brief, mild events (eg, ≤2 nonsurgical 
bleeding episodes) contributed a single point to the HCS, 
whereas serious events (eg, disabling stroke) contributed a 
higher grade to the HCS (eg, disabling stroke contributes 4 
points). The HCS was calculated for each patient by summing 
up all the points associated with each HRAE experienced by 
the patient for the duration of available follow-up. The HCS 
served as the net burden of all HRAEs experienced by the 
patient for the duration of 6-month follow-up. For example, a 
patient who has 3 gastrointestinal bleeds (score 2) followed 
by a nondisabling stroke (score 2) and then a reoperation to 
replace the device (score 3) would contribute a total score of 
7 to the HCS end point.
Statistical Analysis
Patients implanted as randomly assigned constituted the as-
treated cohort of the MOMENTUM 3 Short-Term Cohort for the 
present secondary analysis. Categorical variables are reported 
as percentages and were compared between the groups using 
the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables are presented as 
median (interquartile range) and were compared between 
groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical significance 
was set at P<0.05. Hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated by using Cox propor-
tional-hazard models. Time-to-event analysis was performed by 
using the Kaplan-Meier method with P values reported using 
the log-rank test. Three separate analyses were conducted.
Analysis 1: Comparison of HRAEs Between HM3  
and HMII LVAS
Outcome measures assessed and compared between the 2 
groups were: (1) Survival free of any HRAE at 6 months (ana-
lyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazard mod-
els), and (2) the incidence of any HRAE at 6 months (odds 
ratios and 95% CIs were evaluated from the associated 2×2 
contingency table, and the statistical significance was tested 
using the Fisher exact test). The analysis was stratified by age 
>65 and ≤65, because age has previously been shown to be a 
risk factor associated with HRAEs, and this age cutoff is clini-
cally meaningful in distinguishing destination therapy indica-
tions.7,8 Additionally, days spent in the hospital after the patient 
had been readmitted for an HRAE were compared between the 
HM3 and HMII using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Analysis 2: Comparison of the Net Burden of HRAEs 
(Assessed by the HCS) Between the HM3 and HMII 
The distribution of HCS was compared between the HM3 and 
the HMII by using a proportional odds regression model. HCS 
was modeled as an ordinal outcome variable for each patient 
with values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or ≥5, for a total of 6 ordinal levels. 
The proportional odds assumption was tested and was found 
to be satisfied.
Analysis 3: Exploratory Determination of Clinical 
Correlates Predictive of HRAEs (Based on a HCS>0)
This analysis was performed for the full cohort by compar-
ing those patients alive with a HCS=0 in comparison with 
those with a HCS>0 or death. The clinical correlates analyzed 
included baseline characteristics (eg, age, sex, therapeutic 
intent), anticoagulation level (INR), and the use of aspirin 
therapy and mean arterial pressures at 30 days postim-
plant. These include variables that have been found to be

risk factors impacting bleeding and thrombotic events with 
LVAS.9,10 A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used 
for identifying factors that were independently predictive of 
any HRAEs (HCS>0) or death in the full cohort of patients, 
with device type included as a covariate. Variables with P 
values<0.1 on univariable analysis were incorporated into the 
multivariable regression analysis.
RESULTS
Two hundred eighty-nine patients (of the 294 intention-
to-treat population) constituted the as-treated cohort of 
MOMENTUM 3 (HM3=151 patients; HMII=138 patients). 
The baseline characteristics of the 2 treatment groups 
are reported in Table 2.
Analysis 1: Comparison of HRAEs Between HM3 
and HMII
Survival free of any HRAEs at 6 months was signifi-
cantly higher for the HM3 than for the HMII (69±4% 
versus 55±4%; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.91; 
P=0.012) (Figure 1A). When stratified by age, the HM3 
group had a greater absolute difference relative to 
HMII LVAS for patients ≤65 years of age (76±5% ver-
sus 58±5%; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30–0.87; 
P=0.01). For patients >65 years of age, the results re-
mained numerically better for the HM3 group, although 
P values exceeded 0.05 (Figure 1B). In the HM3 group, 
43 patients (28%) experienced at least 1 HRAE (mild, 
moderate, or severe), versus 53 HMII patients (38%) 
(P=0.08). Table 3 shows the breakdown of patients who 
experienced bleeding, thrombosis, or both bleeding and 
thrombotic complications. HM3 patients had predomi-
nantly bleeding events, whereas bleeding and throm-
boembolic events were equally distributed in the HMII 
group. The total number of days spent in the hospital be-
cause of readmission for HRAE for HM3 versus HMII was 
578 days versus 617 days, respectively, translating into 
a 6.3% reduction in favor of the HM3 group (P=0.079). 
Most events required hospitalization for <10 days.
Analysis 2: Assessment of Net HRAE Burden 
Assessed Using HCS
The HCS for HM3 versus HMII patients was 101 points 
(0.67±1.50 points/patient; median [range]: 0 [0–10] 
points/patient) versus 137 (0.99±1.79 points/pa-
tient; median [range]: 0 [0–9] points/patient; odds 
ratio, 0.64; CI, 0.39–1.03; P=0.065), respectively. 
Further analysis of the HCS breakdown between the 
devices is presented in Table 4. Figure 2 outlines the 
proportional contribution of tiered events to the HCS. 
Figure 3 shows a distribution of the cumulative score 
experienced by each patient in both the HM3 and HMII 
groups, respectively.

total cohort (HMII+HM3) are shown in Table 5. In this 
univariable analysis, patients who experienced any HRAE 
or death were more often implanted with the HMII, were 
older, received the device as destination therapy, were 
more likely to have a lower INR (<1.5), and were not on 
aspirin at 30 days postimplant. Figure 4 shows the result 
of the multivariable analysis of the full cohort of patients. 
The HMII LVAS, older age, absence of aspirin at 30 days, 
and a lower INR (<1.5) at 30 days were independently 
associated with development of any HRAE or death at 
6 months postimplantation. Mean arterial pressure and 
therapeutic intent were not significant in the final multi-
variable model.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this investigation demonstrate that the

A, More patients implanted with HM3 were alive free of HRAE at 6 month compared to patients supported with the HMII. This was 
associated with a statistically significant 38% reduction in the Hazard Ratio in favor of the HM 3. These numbers correspond to 
survival probability estimates ± standard error obtained from the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Hazard ratios were obtained from Cox 
Proportional Hazards modeling. There were 46 events in the HM3 group, and 62 events in the HMII group. B, Survival Free of HRAEs 
stratified by age.  Overall improvement in survival free of HRAEs with the HM3 is more pronounced in patients ≤65 years of age. In the 
Age≤65 subgroup, there were 20 events in the HM3 group and 39 events in the HMII group. In the Age>65 subgroup, there were 26 
events in the HM3 group, and 23 events in the HMII group. There was no interaction of age with device-type (P=0.49). HM3 indicates

HM3, is associated with a significant increase in free-
dom from HRAE in comparison with the HMII LVAS at 6 
months, driven predominantly by a reduction in nondis-
abling strokes and any pump thrombosis. Importantly, as 
previously described,6 no evidence of pump thrombosis 
was noted with the HM3 pump. Furthermore, the HCS, 
which assesses net burden of events per patient, is nu-
merically lower in those implanted with the HM3 LVAS, 
although this comparison did not meet conventional lev-
els of statistical significance (P=0.065).
Hemocompatibility represents the interaction between 
the LVAS interface and intrinsic pathophysiology of acti-
vation or destruction of circulating blood elements.1 Clin-
ically, the overall interaction manifests itself as nonsurgi-
cal bleeding (predominantly gastrointestinal or nasal) and 
thromboembolic events (stroke, pump thrombosis, and 
other systemic embolic events). Importantly, the relation-
ship between events is closely intertwined, because the 
management to ameliorate one may directly influence 
the other. Historically, in LVAS trials, these events are re-
ported separately, some counting as efficacy end points 
and most as adverse events; understanding their inter-
play, and the accumulation of events in each patient, as 
well, has therefore been obscured. As in the recent opin-
ion piece, we evaluated hemocompatibility, for the first 
time, as an aggregate-consolidated end point.1 Similarly, 
we used the proposed HCS to allow a closer apprecia-
tion of the totality of these complications encountered 
by the patient.

This analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial demonstrates 
the relative frequencies between bleeding, clotting, or 
both as contributors to the expression of clinical hemo-
compatibility. We illuminate the fact that a device may 
predispose predominantly to varying clinical grades of 
HRAEs in 1 domain (such as thrombosis) while show-
ing little change in the other domain (such as bleeding). 
Thus, in our analysis, HM3 patients show their greatest 
benefit in the domain of thrombosis-related hemocom-
patibility outcomes as seen in the absence of medically 
or surgically managed pump thrombosis and marked

or HCS>0 group who were excluded from the analysis. For the analysis 
incorporating MAP, anticoagulation, and antiplatelet data at 30 days, only 
patients ongoing on device support at 30 days were included. There 
were 15 patients who either died (n=14, 5 in HM3, 9 in HMII) or received 
transplants (n=1, HMII) in the first 30 days.

reduction in nondisabling strokes (typically ischemic in 
origin). We did not show a difference between the 2 LVAS 
in disabling strokes, which typically represent a devastat-
ing nonsurgical bleeding complication.
Engineering changes in the HM3 that correlate with the 
observed improved outcomes in the fully magnetically levi-
tated, continuous-flow blood pump exhibit 3 potential ad-
vantages1: a frictionless rotor, with no mechanical bearings 
subject to wear and tear2; wide gaps between the rotor and 
casing that allow for permissive blood paths3; and an arti-
ficial intrinsic pulse that prevents pump stasis.5 These en-
gineering attributes, in vitro, are associated with reduced 
shear stress and absence of hemolysis or thrombosis in 
comparison with contemporary devices.11 A proposed 
explanation for reduced hemocompatibility-related com-
plications with the HM3 include the absence of observed 
hemolysis, which is directly correlated with the impact of 
the LVAS on blood element destruction and the effects on 
high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor. 
These clinical biomarkers are also known to reflect effects 
of the continuous-flow circulatory interface and potentially 
herald hemocompatibility-related adverse outcomes.12 
There is now preliminary evidence from an observational 
in vivo investigation that the HM3 LVAS prevents shearing 
of the high-molecular-weight multimers compared with the 
HMII device, which results in more predictable loss of this 
biomarker.13 Whether these mechanisms directly correlate 
with improved hemocompatibility or merely represent an 
epiphenomenon, remains uncertain. However, it is very re-
assuring to note that, although only half of the HMII LVAS–
treated patients are free of a HRAE at 6 months, over 
two-thirds of HM3 patients demonstrate freedom of this 
morbidity. Importantly, advancing age appears to influence 
hemocompatibility-related adverse outcomes. As noted 
in our investigation, those >65 years of age experience 
less freedom from hemocompatibility-related adverse out-
comes with either LVAS, a finding that has implications for 
the growing population of lifetime therapy patients who are 
ineligible for transplantation. Thus, a significant burden of 
hemocompatibility-related complications remains in the 
elderly age group, a clinical predicament that will require 
continued close attention.
The vexing dilemma of hemocompatibility-related ad-
verse outcomes has led investigators to alter manage-
ment practices in the domain of device function (by driv-
ing the speed up or down), managing antiplatelet and 
anticoagulation regimens disparately, all in attempts to 
abrogate the net burden of hemocompatibility-related 
complications. However, experience has suggested that 
such attempts may be associated with improvement in 1 
domain (eg, reduced anticoagulation bridging and running 
the pump in parallel, rather than in series, to decrease

correlates for patients experiencing any HRAEs or death. 
Odds ratios (ORs) are shown for each variable entered into the multivariable mode. Significant correlates included the use of the 
HMII LVAS, older age, an INR<1.5, or no aspirin use at 30 days postimplant. Importantly, there were no significant differences in 
HRAE outcomes by therapeutic intention (destination therapy [DT] or bridge to transplantation [BTT]) or mean arterial pressure

gastrointestinal bleeding) while yielding a worsening in 
a second critical domain (eg, a surge in pump thrombo-
sis).14–17 Nevertheless, attention has shifted to the role of 
both antiplatelet and anticoagulation protocols in manag-
ing the LVAS. A European experience demonstrated that 
an aspirin-free protocol was not related to an increased 
rate of thromboembolic adverse events in HMII-treated 
patients.18 However, analyses with other devices point to 
the importance of full antiplatelet therapy in achieving im-
proved neurological outcomes.19 In our exploratory multi-
variable analysis, we find evidence for age and antiplatelet 
and anticoagulation management regimens as important 
arbiters of HRAE. Surprisingly, blood pressure did not 
appear to clearly correlate with such HRAE outcomes.
Limitations
The current secondary analysis is based on the short-term 
cohort of the MOMENTUM 3 study and reflects a small 
number of patients with a short 6-month follow-up duration. 
Further validation of the HM3 LVAS and outcome durability 
will emerge from planned analyses of the ongoing larger 
cohorts in the trial. The hemocompatibility end point may 
miss some bleeding events in the perioperative phase (<30 
days postimplant) and thus may not fully represent the net 
burden of hemocompatibility. Note should be made that we 
included all deaths, thrombosis-related events, and neuro-
logical events from implant to 6 months. However, the early 
postimplant period is typically a time of adjustment of the 
patient to the device and stabilization of anticoagulation 
regimens, and it is fraught with predominant surgical com-
plications. Typically, patients stay in-hospital for 3 weeks 
postimplant, and bleeding events that occur during this 
time usually represent surgical events or adverse sequelae 
of a baseline patient predisposition (eg, a gastric ulcer that 
bleeds). Yet, events in this early period may drive conse-
quences further downstream, and our exploratory findings 
with respect to antiplatelet and anticoagulation use point 
in this direction. Importantly, early deaths (within 30 days) 
would have reduced the opportunity for a subsequent non-
surgical bleeding event. In this regard, it should be noted, 
that there were 5 deaths in the HM3 group and 9 deaths in 
the HMII group in the first 30 days. Thus, any disadvantage 
in the lost opportunity for subsequent HRAE would have 
been levied in the HM3 group. Another important issue 
relates to the role of infection and its consequent inflam-
matory state in driving a change in the hemocompatibility 
milieu.20 We did not specifically study the interrelationship 
between these variables for this analysis. This was the first 
attempt at using the hemocompatibility burden score and 
could serve to help refine its utility over time.
CONCLUSION
In this secondary analysis of the MOMENTUM 3 trial, 
the HM3 had a higher freedom from an aggregate of 
HRAEs at 6 months in comparison with the HMII LVAS, 
driven predominantly by a reduction in nondisabling 
strokes and absence of any pump thrombosis. These 
data provide further evidence that the HM3 LVAS has a 
more favorable physiological circulatory interface than 
does the HMII.
