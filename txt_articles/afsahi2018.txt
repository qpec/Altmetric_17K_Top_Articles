Abstract:  
We have developed a cost-effective and portable graphene-enabled biosensor to detect 
Zika virus with a highly specific immobilized monoclonal antibody. Field Effect 
Biosensing (FEB) with monoclonal antibodies covalently linked to graphene enables 
real-time, quantitative detection of native Zika viral (ZIKV) antigens. The percent change 
in capacitance in response to doses of antigen (ZIKV NS1) coincides with levels of 
clinical significance with detection of antigen in buffer at concentrations as low as 
450 pM. Potential diagnostic applications were demonstrated by measuring Zika antigen 
in a simulated human serum. Selectivity was validated using Japanese Encephalitis 
 NS1, a homologous and potentially cross-reactive viral antigen. Further, the graphene 
platform can simultaneously provide the advanced quantitative data of nonclinical 
biophysical kinetics tools, making it adaptable to both clinical research and possible 
diagnostic applications. The speed, sensitivity, and selectivity of this first-of-its-kind 
graphene-enabled Zika biosensor make it an ideal candidate for development as a 
medical diagnostic test.

1. Introduction 
Zika is a vector borne viral infection originating in the Zika Forest of Uganda in the 
mid-20th century (Sikka et al., 2016). Since its discovery, there have been several 
significant outbreaks of Zika, most recently in 2015 in North and South America 
including the United States (Peterson et al., 2016). The long-term effects of Zika include 
severe brain defects in fetuses (Rasmussen et al., 2016) and Guillain-Barre Syndrome 
in adults (Ladhani et al., 2016). As a result, the Zika virus epidemic has been a growing 
concern for public health in the United States. Over 41,000 cases of Zika virus infection 
have been reported since January 2015 within the United States and its territories, of 
which 3,461 cases are pregnant women (Centers for Disease Control, 2017). The 
current diagnostic standards for Zika detection are RNA Nucleic Acid Testing (RNA 
NAT), Trioplex rRT-PCR, or the Zika IgM Antibody Capture Enzyme-Linked 
Immunosorbent Assay (Zika MAC-ELISA) in urine, serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (Huzly 
et al., 2016; Lanciotti et al., 2008). However, due to cross-reactivity with co-circulating 
viruses, such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) (Sironi et al., 2016; Xu et al., 
2016), the confirmation rate of presumptive positive results is less than 50% for the 
commercial IgM capture ELISA (Food and Drug Administration, 2016). Both timely and 
accurate diagnostic capabilities from emerging technologies are needed to combat this 
public health threat.  
Highly sensitive nanomaterials show promise as biosensors by affording lower limits of 
detection with better selectivity than traditional assays. A promising biosensor 
candidate, graphene, is a single layer, two-dimensional sheet of hexagonally arranged 
carbon atoms first experimentally isolated in 2004 (Geim and Novoselov, 2007; 
Novoselov et al., 2004). As a conductive, two-dimensional material, every atom in a 
graphene sheet is in direct contact with its environment and responds to electrostatic 
fluctuations, making it an ideal candidate for sensing applications (Zhu et al., 2013). 
Indeed, graphene has been incorporated into sensors of all varieties, including pressure 
sensors (Zhu et al., 2013), chemical vapor sensors (Esfandiar et al., 2013; Lu et al., 
2010), optical sensors, (Lu et al., 2012) and biomolecular sensors (Lerner et al., 2014). 
We have recently demonstrated use of a commercially available graphene chip as a 
biosensor, with read out by portable electronic hardware (Lerner et al., 2016). Graphene 
is selected as the base material for our platform over other nanomaterials because of 
this extensive publication history of sensor devices coupled with recent availability of 
graphene biosensor chips that have been processed through commercial fab, 
packaging and QA processes (Lerner et al., 2016). Use of commercially available 
biosensor chips rather than lab built biosensor chips allows us to evaluate the material 
and device characteristics using scaled production, closer to what is needed for a 
 potential fielded diagnostic device compared to a laboratory constructed device. These 
chips are modified here to demonstrate sensitive and specific detection of Zika viral 
nonstructural protein 1 (ZIKV NS1).  
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Graphene Biosensor Fabrication 
Biosensor chips are fabricated at a commercial foundry as described previously (Lerner 
et al., 2016). Briefly, photolithography and plasma-enhanced CVD is used to pattern 
and passivate graphene with Ti/Pt leads on 6” silicon wafers (Lerner et al., 2016). High 
quality, single layer graphene films are grown via CVD on copper foil (Alfa Aesar) and 
transferred via bubbing transfer (Gao et al., 2012; Kybert et al., 2014). Individual dies 
are packaged using a chip-on-board process and encapsulated with epoxy to form an 
exposed well above the graphene biosensor surface. 
2.2 Graphene Biosensor Measurement 
Graphene biosensor chips are read using the commercial Agile R100 system 
(Nanomedical Diagnostics), previously described in detail (Lerner et al., 2016). With this 
system, graphene biosensor chips are inserted into an electronic reader that applies a 
source-drain voltage across the graphene channel and a gate voltage between the 
applied liquid and the drain electrode of the graphene. There are 2 read-out channels 
available: the I-Response (current through the channel) and the C-Response 
(capacitance of biosensor to the liquid).  In this study, the C-Response channel is used. 
Control of the system, as well as data readout is performed via the Agile Plus software, 
which is run on a PC attached to the system via USB, as shown in Figure 1b. 
2.3 Protein Immobilization 
Our previously described NHS surface chemistry was used to build sensor chips ready 
for protein attachment (Afsahi et al., 2017).  
The biosensor chips were then functionalized with the target, anti-Zika NS1 mouse mAb 
6B1 developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Anti-Zika NS1 was diluted to 
a working concentration of 14.6 nM in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. 
During immobilization and measurement, 75 µL of all solutions were used on the 
biosensor chips and incubation steps took place at room temperature. The software was 
calibrated to baseline in 1X PBS pH 7.4 for 60 seconds. Anti-Zika NS1 was immobilized 
on the surface by incubating for 15 minutes. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has previously 
been shown to be an effective block against non-specific interactions in general and 
specifically when covalently attached to graphene devices (Gao et al., 2016; Liu et al., 
2013). Thus, residual active NHS groups were first quenched using 3 mM amino-PEG5-
alcohol (amino-PEG) pH 7.4 (BroadPharm) before a final quench with 1 M 
Ethanolamine pH 8.5. Each quench step was done for 15 minutes each, followed by 
several washes in 1X PBS pH 7.4. The high concentration of PEG used during blocking 
leads to both covalently linked PEG to the graphene surface and absorbed PEG to the 
rest of the chip surfaces. This provides both an anti-absorptive to the SiO2 as well as a 
stable block on the graphene against non-specific interactions at the surface. 
Measurements were performed in an assay buffer of 1X PBS pH 7.4 or a dilution of 
simulated serum (Cellastim, InVitria) for spike in measurements at 1:10 and 1:100 of 
 serum to 1X PBS pH 7.4. Immediately after immobilization, the biosensor chips were 
calibrated in assay buffer for 5 minutes. The ZIKV NS1 recombinant antigen (The Native 
Antigen Company) was diluted in assay buffer to the desired concentration. Each 
concentration was applied to individual biosensor chips for at least 5 minutes to 
generate a sensor response. A negative control was also conducted using 
500 ng/mL Japanese encephalitis (JEV) NS1 recombinant viral antigen (The Native 
Antigen Company) applied to biosensor chips using the same protocol as the ZIKV NS1 
targets.  
3. Results and Discussion 
Graphene quality is indicated by the low D/G ratio (<0.1) in the Raman spectrum 
depicted in Figure 1d. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) indicates that target 
immobilization on the 1.0 nm thick graphene surface (Supplemental Figure S1) occurs 
at the optimal density of 5 proteins/µm2 and thus confirms the change in C-Response 
after protein immobilization (Figure 1c).  
The graphene biosensor chip relies on Field Effect Biosensing (FEB) technology, 
whereby the channel current and gate capacitance of a field effect graphene transistor 
shift reproducibly when appropriate biological targets are immobilized to the surface as 
the gate dielectric (Figure 1a). Pristine graphene is functionalized to bind the desired 
target. The graphene surface is then blocked and passivated to reduce non-specific 
interactions. Biosensors are monitored throughout this process, as shown in Figure 1e. 
Notably, antibody immobilization produced a 20% increase in the capacitance response 
(Figure 1e). Further, a 100% increase was seen in the C-Response between the wash 
step and the calibrated baseline (Figure 1e). This indicates that irreversible chemical 
modifications took place on the surface, successfully functionalizing the biosensor. 
Anti-Zika NS1 has a greater impact on the capacitance of graphene transistors than the 
source-drain resistance, which is why the C-Response channel was used in this study. 
Each of the datapoints in Figure 1e corresponds to a complete cycle of liquid gate 
voltage from -100 mV to 100 mV and back. Figure 1f shows representative complete 
current versus gate voltage curves during calibration, quenching, and rinsing. The 
increase in the I-Vg slope (higher transconductance) implies increased sensitivity of the 
graphene biosensor.

transistor with a graphene channel. (b) Illustration of the entire sensor chip system, incorporating the sensor chip,

capacitance during target immobilization and quenching on the graphene biosensor chip surface. (f) I-Vg curves at 
different immobilization steps. The dramatic steepening of the I-Vg slope indicates substantial change in the surface 
chemistry and increased sensitivity of the biosensor. 
In developing a clinical diagnostic test, maximizing sensitivity and specificity is critical. 
The current incidence of Zika infection is unclear due to high rates of cross-reactivity 
with other co-circulating flavivirus pathogens. To address this, diagnostics target a 
specific viral protein with unique epitopes. The crystal structure of ZIKV NS1 reveals 
that the protein C-terminal has electrostatic characteristics that differentiate it from 
related co-circulating viruses (Song et al., 2016). This unique charge signature allows 
for development of specific mAbs with limited cross-reactivity among related viruses 
such as JEV.  
Sensitivity of ZIKV NS1 detection on a graphene biosensor chip was determined by 
running several analyte concentrations. Figure 2a shows the calibration, response, and 
exponential sensorgram fit for 0.45 nM ZIKV NS1. The RMS noise level of the Agile 
R100 system is ±0.2%. Our previous work measuring Zika antigen in buffer has shown 
a limit of detection of 0.45 nM ZIKV NS1 in buffer, a significant improvement over other 
 label free techniques such as BLI when using this antibody-antigen system (Afsahi et 
al., 2017).  
To demonstrate the selectivity of anti-Zika NS1 immobilized on graphene based 
biosensor chips, 500 ng/mL ZIKV NS1 or JEV NS1 was applied to individual biosensor 
chips functionalized with anti-ZIKV NS1. JEV NS1 shares 56.5% amino acid sequence 
identity with ZIKV and represents a potential cross-reactive species (Xu et al., 2016). 
When a single exponential fit was applied to the resulting sensorgram (Figure 2b), the 
ZIKV NS1 C-response was 8%. Comparatively, JEV NS1 did not elicit a measurable 
sensor response when exposed to anti-ZIKV NS1, demonstrating high selectivity for 
ZIKV NS1 antigen.

a re-application of 1X PBS pH 7.4. (b) Sensorgram of the C-Response during sensing by anti-ZIKV NS1 of 500 ng/mL 
JEV NS1 versus an equal concentration of ZIKV NS1. Blue line indicates single exponential fit to the ZIKV NS1 
response curve.  
Spike-in measurements in simulated serum were performed at 2 dilutions in 
quadruplicate to demonstrate the potential for optimization of this assay for diagnostic 
purposes. Sensorgrams are shown in Figure 3a, and the average responses after 
5 minutes with standard deviations are shown in Figure 3b. Dilution of serum improved 
the coefficient of variation percentage (CV%) despite lowering the overall sensor 
response. Generally, for in vitro diagnostics, CV% should be ≤20%, with ≤10% being 
considered a reliable test. However these parameters are based on assay precision in 
relation to clinical allowable error (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, 2012). At 1:10 
 dilution, the CV is 19.89%, while at 1:100 dilution, the CV is 9.17% (see Supplemental 
Table S1), which suggests the possibility of a diagnostic valuable in a clinical setting.

4. Conclusions 
Emerging epidemics such as Zika drive advances in the medical and research sectors. 
Interpretation of the results of Zika virus antibody (IgM) tests may be complicated due to 
high cross-reactivity among related, co-circulating viruses such as JEV. Covalent 
linkage of anti-Zika NS1 to a graphene biosensor chip enables low cost and portable 
acquisition of real-time kinetic binding data via FEB technology. The Agile R100 
biosensor chip functionalized with anti-Zika NS1 detects ZIKV NS1 at concentrations as 
low as 0.45 nM. Furthermore, when the device was tested with JEV NS1 there was no 
measurable cross-reactivity. The LLOD and specificity of the ZIKV NS1 antigen provide 
an opportunity for early stage detection of active disease in presumptive Zika infection. 
 The Agile R100 FEB platform provides a promising base for development into Zika 
clinical applications and improved diagnostic testing early in infection.
