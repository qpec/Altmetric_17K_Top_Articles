Summary Box
 
► This study showed that a group of elite athletes ha-
bitually consuming a very low-carbohydrate (LC) diet 
for over a year exhibited markedly elevated concen-
trations of total and LDL-C, above levels considered 
desirable and beyond that which has been observed 
in ketogenic diet interventions in non-athletes.
 
► The LC athletes also had extremely high concentra-
tions of HDL-C and fewer small, dense LDL particles, 
suggestive of lower risk for cardiovascular disease.
 
► The explanation for this paradox of very high circulat-
ing cholesterol in highly-trained endurance athletes 
who adopt a low-carbohydrate diet, may be related 
to high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol as 
well as an increased demand for lipid metabolism 
and corresponding expansion of the intravascular 
cholesterol pool to accommodate their dramatically 
accelerated rates of fatty acid oxidation.
ABSTrACT
Objective A growing number of ultra-endurance athletes 
have switched to a very low-carbohydrate/high-fat 
eating pattern. We compared markers of cholesterol and 
the lipoprotein profile in a group of elite ultra-runners 
consuming a high-carbohydrate (HC) or low-carbohydrate 
(LC) diet.
Methods Fasting blood was obtained from competitive 
male ultra-endurance runners habitually consuming a 
very low-carbohydrate (LC; n=10) or high-carbohydrate 
(HC; n=10) diet to determine blood cholesterol profile, 
lipoprotein particle distribution and sterol biomarkers of 
cholesterol balance.
results Plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) cholesterol 
were all significantly greater (p<0.000) in the LC group 
(65%, 83% and 60%, respectively). There were also 
significant differences in lipoprotein particle distribution 
as evidenced by a greater size and concentration of large 
HDL and LDL particles, and total LDL particle concentration 
was significantly greater in the LC group, but they had 
significantly fewer small LDL particles.
Conclusion Ultra-endurance athletes habitually 
consuming a very low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet for over 
a year showed unique cholesterol profiles characterised 
by consistently higher plasma LDL-C and HDL-C, less 
small LDL particles, and lipoprotein profiles consistent 
with higher insulin sensitivity. There may be a functional 
purpose to the expansion of the circulating cholesterol pool 
to meet the heightened demand for lipid transport in highly 
trained, keto-adapted athletes.
InTrOduCTIOn
Ketogenic diets are effective in the manage-
ment of obesity,1 metabolic syndrome2 and 
type 2 diabetes.3 Athletes, especially those in 
the ultra-endurance community, have increas-
ingly embraced lower carbohydrate/higher 
fat eating patterns.4 5 Whereas carbohydrate 
restriction and nutritional ketosis consistently 
improve dyslipidaemia (high triglycerides, low 
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) 
and predominance of small low-density lipopro-
tein (LDL) particles),2 the effects on total and 
LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are less predictable. 
Based on our prior ketogenic diet intervention 
studies in both sedentary and recreationally 
active men and women with a wide range of 
adiposity and insulin resistance,6–11 serum 
LDL-C responses varied widely in magnitude 
and direction, with the mean response often 
not significantly different from baseline.
Regular 
aerobic 
exercise 
consistently 
increases HDL-C, specifically the larger HDL2-C 
fraction, with more robust effects observed with 
higher levels of training.12 13 Aerobic exercise 
also decreases LDL-C, smaller LDL particles 
and triglycerides,14 but the effects are variable 
and are more consistent with higher volumes of 
exercise.15 Studies in ultra-endurance athletes 
indicate they have significantly lower total and 
LDL-C, and higher HDL-C concentrations, 
compared with sedentary individuals.16 17
Knowledge of how ketogenic diets interact 
with high levels of exercise training to impact 
cholesterol/lipoprotein profiles is limited. 
Elite cyclists fed a 4-week eucaloric ketogenic 
diet during training increased total choles-
terol from 156 mg/dL to 208 mg/dL.18 It 
remains unclear if serum cholesterol would 
have continued to rise if the ketogenic diet was 
extended. Male monozygotic twins with vastly 
disparate habitual levels of physical activity who 
consumed both a low-fat/high-carbohydrate 
diet and a moderate-fat/moderate-carbohy-
drate diet for 6 weeks showed the expected

decrease in HDL-C and size of LDL particles with high-car-
bohydrate intake, with a high degree of concordance within 
twin pairs.19 This result suggests that extreme differences in 
exercise have little impact on serum lipoprotein responses 
to diets varying in carbohydrate and fat.
To study whether chronic high levels of exercise training 
would be associated with attenuation or accentuation of 
the ‘normal’ cholesterol and lipoprotein responses asso-
ciated with a ketogenic diet, we measured fasting serum 
cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles in ultra-endurance 
athletes who had been habitually consuming a very low-car-
bohydrate/high-fat diet for >6 months compared with a 
matched group of athletes consuming a high-carbohydrate 
diet.
MeThOdS
experimental approach
The following data are an extension of a larger cross-sec-
tional investigation4 that reported on metabolic responses 
in two groups of elite ultra-marathoners habitually 
consuming either a low-carbohydrate (LC) or high-car-
bohydrate (HC) diet. The purpose of the current analysis 
was to more closely examine differences in cholesterol and 
lipoprotein markers between these groups.
Study participants
Twenty highly trained, male ultra-endurance runners 
consuming an LC (n=10) or an HC (n=10) diet 21–45 years 
of age were selected for participation. Athletes competed 
in sanctioned running events ≥50 km and/or triathlons 
of at least half ironman distance (113 km) and were in 
the top 10% of finalists. Athletes were matched for age, 
physical characteristics, primary competition distance and 
competition times. All but one athlete travelled via plane 
to our laboratory for 2 days of testing. Interested athletes 
spoke extensively with a registered dietitian about their diet 
history, and completed questionnaires to assess their diet, 
training, running competition and medical history. At least 
one phone call was scheduled to review this information 
and determine eligibility and availability. Diet information 
was entered into nutrient analysis software (Nutritionist 
Pro, Axxya Systems, Stafford, Texas). Subjects had to be 
consuming an LC (<20%en carbohydrate, >60%en fat) for 
>6 months or >55%en from carbohydrate for the HC group. 
Athletes were excluded if they had diabetes, heart disease, 
kidney, liver, or other metabolic or endocrine dysfunc-
tion, current injury, or anti-inflammatory medication use. 
Subjects were informed of the purpose and possible risks 
of the investigation prior to signing an informed consent 
document.
Measurements
Full methods and metabolic results have been published.4 
Athletes arrived at the laboratory at 06:00 after a 10-hour 
overnight fast and were asked to restrict caffeine, over-the-
counter medications and alcohol. The night prior and the 
morning before testing, subjects were encouraged to liber-
ally consume water to ensure hydration. A urine sample was 
provided to assess specific gravity (Model A300CL, Spartan, 
Japan). All subjects had a urine specific gravity (USG) 
>1.025, indicating adequate hydration. Body composi-
tion was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 
(Prodigy, Lunar, Madison, Wisconsin). Body weight was 
recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale (OHAUS, 
Florham Park, New Jersey).
Blood collection and analysis
All blood samples were obtained with a 21 G butterfly 
needle from an antecubital vein of the subject. After resting 
quietly for 15 min in a supine position, blood was collected 
into EDTA and serum separator vacutainer tubes (Vacuette, 
Greiner Bio-One North America, Monroe, North Caro-
lina). EDTA tubes were immediately spun while serum 
tubes remained at room temperature for 15 min prior to 
centrifugation to allow clotting to occur. Whole blood was 
centrifuged (1500× g for 15 min at 4°C), promptly aliquoted 
into cryostorage tubes, snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen 
and stored at −80°C for later analysis. Frozen samples were 
thawed only once before the analysis of all variables.
HDL-C and triglycerides were analysed using enzymatic 
methods on an automated analyser (cobas C 111, Roche 
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). Total cholesterol 
was measured using enzymatic colourimetric methods.20 
Plasma LDL-C was determined using a direct method,21 as 
well as calculated from the total cholesterol, HDL-C and 
triglyceride concentrations.22
Lipoprotein distribution was conducted by Liposci-
ence (Raleigh, North Carolina) using hydrogen nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) on a 400 MHz NMR analyser 
(Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, Massachusetts) as previously 
described.23 24 Lipoprotein subclasses were grouped based 
on particle diameters: large very low-density lipoprotein 
(VLDL) (>60 nm), medium VLDL (35–60 nm), small 
VLDL (27–35 nm), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) 
(23–27 nm), large LDL (21.2–23 nm), medium LDL (19.8–
21.2 nm), small LDL (18–19.8 nm), large HDL (8.8–13 
nm), medium HDL (8.2–8.8 nm) and small HDL (7.3–8.2 
nm). The lipoprotein insulin resistance index (LP-IR) was 
calculated from six lipoprotein measures (VLDL, LDL and 
HDL size, large VLDL particles, small LDL particles and 
large HDL particles).25
Concentrations of non-cholesterol sterol precursors 
(lathosterol, desmosterol, cholestanol, sitosterol and camp-
esterol) were quantified by Boston Heart Diagnostics using 
a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method.26 Data 
are presented in absolute concentration and normalised 
to total cholesterol (μmol/mmol of cholesterol) since the 
non-cholesterol sterol precursors are transported in plasma 
by lipoproteins. Fractional cholesterol balance was calcu-
lated using the following formula: (fractional cholesterol 
balance = (lathosterol × 0.8 + desmosterol × 0.2)/(beta-sit-
osterol × 0.5 + campesterol × 0.5)).
Statistical analysis
Means and SD were calculated for all variables. Differ-
ences between groups were assessed using independent

Shapiro-Wilk test. The following non-normal data were 
analysed using the Mann-Whitney U: triglycerides, LP-IR, 
HDL particle size, total LDL particles, IDL particles, small 
LDL particles, total VLDL particles, large VLDL particles 
and medium VLDL particles. Normal data with significant 
variance were analysed using the Welch’s unequal vari-
ance t-test. A priori power calculations via G*Power were 
conducted for our previously reported primary outcome 
(fatty acid oxidation rates)4 with a statistical power of 80% 
and significance of 0.05. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calcu-
lated. All statistical analyses were preformed using the 
Prism GraphPad software (V.6.0, La Jolla, California).
reSulTS
Subject characteristics and diet
There were no differences between groups in physical 
characteristics or aerobic capacity, or caloric intake, but 
the composition of the diet was dramatically different as 
per the experimental design (table 1). Two athletes in 
each group were triathletes, and all others competed in 
events largely ranging from 80 km to 161 km (50–100 
miles). Athletes consuming an LC diet derived a majority 
of their energy from fat (70%), predominantly in the 
forms of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. 
Only ~10% of energy intake was from carbohydrate 
sources. Conversely, athletes consuming an HC diet 
consumed over half their energy in the form of carbo-
hydrates (57%). Protein was not significantly different 
between groups. Dietary cholesterol intake was signifi-
cantly greater (p<0.003) among the LC athletes (844 
mg/day) compared with the HC athletes (291 mg/day). 
The average duration on an LC diet ranged from 9 to 36 
months.
Plasma lipids
Compared with the HC group, athletes consuming an LC 
diet had greater total cholesterol (65%), LDL-C (calcu-
lated) (79%), LDL-C (direct) (83%) and HDL-C (60%) 
(table 2, figure 1). There was a high degree of correlation

in LDL-C concentration (r=0.992) between the calcu-
lated and direct methods of determination. Plasma 
triglycerides and the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio were 
not different between groups. LC athletes had a lower 
triglyceride (TG):HDL ratio (44%). There was no differ-
ence in fasting glucose and a trend for a lower insulin in 
LC athletes.
lipoprotein particles
LC athletes had smaller VLDL, and larger LDL and HDL 
particles (table 3, figure 2). LC athletes had a greater 
concentration of large HDL and LDL and fewer small 
LDL particles. Total LDL particle concentration was 
greater in LC athletes. The LC group had greater large 
HDL particles. The LP-IR was lower in the LC group.
Fractional cholesterol balance and non-cholesterol sterols
Absolute concentrations of sterols were greater in the LC 
group for desmosterol and cholestenol (table 4). When 
normalised to total cholesterol, lathosterol, cholestanol 
and campesterol were higher and desmosterol was lower 
in the HC group. The calculated fractional cholesterol 
balance was not significantly different between groups.
dISCuSSIOn
We compared cholesterol profiles in two groups of highly 
trained, ultra-endurance athletes who were chronically 
adapted to either an LC or HC diet. All LC athletes had 
total cholesterol >200 mg/dL and LDL-C >100 mg/
dL, whereas in a matched group of HC athletes all but 
two were under these thresholds considered desirable/
optimal.27 Despite the high LDL-C, LC athletes had less 
small LDL particles, and HDL-C levels were considerably 
higher than expected in trained athletes.12 13 16 17 The 
exaggerated hypercholesterolaemia exhibited in chron-
ically keto-adapted endurance athletes is counterintuitive 
in consideration that (1) the cholesterol levels in LC 
athletes are greater in magnitude than has been reported 
in non-athletes consuming a ketogenic diet,28 (2) 
ultra-endurance athletes are reported to have similar or 
lower total cholesterol and LDL-C than less active indi-
viduals,16 17 (3) exercise training studies report either 
no change or slight reductions in total and LDL-C,15 29 
(4) previous studies in endurance athletes fed high-fat 
diets (50%–85% of energy) for 2–12 weeks indicate total 
cholesterol concentrations remain under or slightly 
above 200 mg/dL,18 30 31 and (5) disparate levels of 
exercise have little impact on the typical cholesterol 
responses to diets varying in carbohydrate and fat.19 We 
propose several explanations for the apparent paradox of 
high-volume exercise training accentuating, as opposed 
to attenuating, the cholesterolaemic response to a keto-
genic diet.
Typical cholesterol profiles associated with ketogenic diets
In a review of 15 low-fat diet comparison studies,28 it 
was reported that in all cases, a very low-carbohydrate 
diet led to greater increases in total cholesterol, LDL-C 
and HDL-C. The mean difference between the rela-
tive changes for each diet was 7% for total cholesterol, 
9% for LDL-C and 11% for HDL-C. The highest mean 
increase in LDL-C for any study reviewed was 15%.8 By 
comparison, total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C were 
64%, 79% and 59% higher in LC athletes relative to 
their HC counterparts. Despite the nearly twofold higher 
LDL-C concentrations in LC athletes, small LDL particle 
concentration was 56% lower than HC athletes. The shift 
from small to large LDL particles is independent of the 
change in LDL-C and consistent with the strong correla-
tion between dietary carbohydrate and LDL size32 and 
is in agreement with many other ketogenic diet inter-
ventions.7 11 33 High HDL-C and large HDL2-C in LC 
athletes were expected, but the magnitude of difference 
is noteworthy. All 10 LC athletes had HDL-C higher than 
the mean HDL-C level in HC athletes (64 mg/dL). A

a ketogenic diet, but both groups had similar low levels 
of triglycerides, suggesting that additional mechanism(s) 
beyond those related to TG lowering account for the 
differences in HDL-C.
reasons for hypercholesterolaemic profiles in lC athletes
The hypercholesterolaemia observed in LC athletes could 
be partially explained by dietary factors including greater 
intake of saturated fat (86 vs 21 g/day) and cholesterol 
(844 vs 251 mg/day), and lower intake of fibre (23 vs 57 
g/day). Meta-analyses indicate that higher intake of satu-
rated fat34 and cholesterol35 and lower intake of fibre36 
are associated with increased blood cholesterol. However, 
the predicted increase in blood cholesterol from these 
dietary factors, even if viewed collectively, falls short of 
explaining the significantly higher blood cholesterol 
levels in LC athletes. We observed significant associations 
between dietary cholesterol, saturated fat and fibre intake

with blood cholesterol measures, but their individual role 
is impossible to ascertain from correlations and the high 
degree of inter-relation among dietary nutrients.
Several biological processes involved in cholesterol 
homeostasis may be altered in keto-adapted athletes that 
manifest in increased circulating cholesterol. An increase 
in dietary cholesterol is normally balanced by some 
combination of decreased exogenous cholesterol absorp-
tion, decreased endogenous cholesterol synthesis and 
increased biliary cholesterol output such that circulating 
cholesterol levels are not significantly altered. It is note-
worthy that ketogenesis and cholesterol synthesis share 
a common pathway whereby acetyl CoA is converted 
to acetoacetyl-CoA and then β-Hydroxy β-methylgl-
utaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) by thiolase and HMG-CoA 
synthase, respectively.37 In the synthesis of cholesterol, 
HMG-CoA is converted to mevalonate by HMG-CoA 
reductase, whereas in the synthesis of ketones HMG-CoA 
is converted to acetoacetate by HMG-CoA lyase. Although 
ketone synthesis occurs exclusively in the mitochondria 
and cholesterol synthesis in the cytoplasm,37 it is possible 
for some acetoacetate generated during ketogenesis to 
diffuse out of the mitochondria and be converted to 
acetoacetyl-CoA in the cytosol via the action of acetoace-
tyl-CoA synthetase.38 Thus, the higher flux of fatty acids 
and ketogenesis in LC athletes in the context of overall 
high energy expenditures could contribute to increased 
endogenous synthesis of cholesterol by enhancing the 
cytosolic substrate pool. Increased circulating lathosterol 
and to a lesser extent desmosterol expressed relative 
to total cholesterol are markers of de novo cholesterol 
synthesis.39 Lathosterol was lower in LC athletes, indi-
cating that cholesterol overproduction is likely not a 
major contributor to hypercholesterolaemia.40
Campesterol, a marker of exogenous cholesterol 
absorption, expressed relative to total cholesterol was 
lower in LC athletes, implying a lower rate of cholesterol 
absorption may have limited the increase in circulating 
cholesterol. Serum sitosterol has been demonstrated 
to positively correlate with cholesterol absorption effi-
ciency41 and is higher in endurance athletes,42 but was not 
different in this study. Absolute concentrations of choles-
tanol were higher in LC athletes, implying decreased 
conversion of cholesterol to the bile acid chenodeoxy-
cholate. Normally, high cholesterol intake is associated 
with enhanced biliary cholesterol output to prevent 
hypercholesterolaemia,43 but this mechanism appears to 
be compromised in LC athletes. The fact that the overall 
ratio of cholesterol synthesis to absorption markers (ie, 
the fractional cholesterol balance) was the same between 
LC and HC athletes is consistent with the fact that greater 
consumption of cholesterol by LC athletes is trans-
lated into an expansion of their circulating cholesterol 
pool.44 45
There may be an unexpected interaction between 
keto-adaptation and high-volume endurance exercise 
that manifests in a hypercholesterolaemic phenotype. 
The LC athletes had been performing relatively high 
volumes of endurance training for many years. Meta-
bolically, they exhibited a highly refined ability to

derive the majority of their energy from lipids at rest 
and during training.4 The substantially greater rates 
of lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation compared with 
their HC counterparts may also require adaptations 
in intravascular lipoprotein metabolism to support 
the overall greater flux of lipid fuels. Serum HDL-C, 
specifically HDL2-C, raising effects of exercise are 
partially attributed to increased expression and activity 
of skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase, which breaks 
down circulating triglycerides, resulting in a transfer of 
cholesterol and other substances to HDL-C.46 It is quite 
likely keto-adapted athletes increase muscle lipoprotein 
lipase to enhance use of triglyceride from circulating 
VLDL particles.47 The greater catabolism of VLDL-TG 
in LC athletes could result in accumulation of VLDL 
remnants in the LDL density range.48
There are common polymorphisms in successful 
endurance athletes49 that might contribute to a hyper-
cholesterolaemic profile in the context of a ketogenic 
diet. For example, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PPARGC1A) polymorphisms 
are related to exceptional endurance capacity50 and 
cholesterol response to dietary fat.51 Additional research 
is necessary to determine the influence of genetic vari-
ation as a contributor to the hypercholesterolaemic 
response to ketogenic diets.

Clinical relevance
From a traditional cardiovascular risk perspective, 
the levels of total and LDL-C observed in LC athletes 
would classify them as high risk27; however, there are 
conflicting studies on the role of LDL-C and mortality.52 
A broader look at the lipoprotein profile supports low 
risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. LC 
athletes had extremely high HDL-C, specifically in 
the large HDL2-C fraction, which is greater in magni-
tude than would be expected from a ketogenic diet 
or exercise training alone. They also exhibited low 
concentrations of triglycerides and small, dense LDL 
particles. In over 11 000 men and women followed for 
over a decade, small dense LDL was more strongly asso-
ciated with an incident of coronary heart disease than 
traditional blood LDL-C.53 The LP-IR derived from 
the NMR lipoprotein profile correlates with multiple 
measures of insulin resistance25 and is associated with 
an incident of type 2 diabetes.54 The LP-IR was 78% 
lower in LC athletes, with absolute scores among the 
lowest values recorded in over 5000 individuals.25
limitations
Because of the cross-sectional design of this study, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that LC athletes were by 
nature more hypercholesterolaemic or they for some 
unknown reason self-selected to an LC diet. The rela-
tively small sample size should be expanded to include 
larger more diverse athletes including women. Since 
all the measurements made in this study were circu-
lating surrogate markers, it will be important in future 
work to track athletes for longer periods of time while 
measuring clinical events and relevant indicators of 
mortality. None of the participants indicated familial 
hypercholesterolaemia on their medical questionnaire, 
but we did not perform genetic testing to test for this 
condition or other genetic variants. Genotyping in 
future work would help uncover potential interactions 
of a ketogenic diet with specific polymorphisms that 
relate to cholesterol metabolism.
COnCluSIOn
Ketogenic diets in normal-weight and overweight 
non-athletes result in a moderate increase in total, 
LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations relative to low-fat 
diets.28 The observation that highly trained, ultra-en-
durance athletes consuming a very low-carbohydrate/
high-fat diet exhibited a more dramatic and uniform 
hypercholesterolaemia is counterintuitive since high-
volume exercise tends to lower total and LDL-C levels. 
The explanation for this paradox may involve high 
intake of cholesterol and saturated fat combined with 
high-energy demands for lipid metabolism character-
istic of the keto-adapted phenotype. LC athletes who 
adopt a ketogenic diet may experience an expansion of 
their endogenous cholesterol pool during the adapta-
tion phase of the diet, after which they maintain greater 
circulating cholesterol levels.
