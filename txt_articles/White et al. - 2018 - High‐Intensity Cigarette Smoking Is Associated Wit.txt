Background-—Previous reports on whether smoking is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus have yielded
inconsistent findings. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and incident diabetes mellitus in the
Jackson Heart Study.
Methods and Results-—Jackson Heart Study participants enrolled at baseline without prevalent diabetes mellitus (n=2991) were
classified by self-report as current smokers, past smokers (smoked ≥400 cigarettes/life and no longer smoking), or never
smokers. We quantified smoking intensity by number of cigarettes smoked daily; we considered ≥20 cigarettes per day (1 pack)
“high-intensity.” We defined diabetes mellitus as fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% or International Federation
of Clinical Chemistry units HbA1c 48 mmol/mol, or use of diabetes mellitus medication. We estimated the adjusted associations
of smoking status, intensity, and dose (pack-years) with incident diabetes mellitus using Poisson regression models. At baseline
there were 361 baseline current (1–10 cigarettes per day [n=242]; ≥20 [n=119]), 502 past, and 2128 never smokers. From Visit 1
to Visit 3 (mean 8.0�0.9 years), 479 participants developed incident diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for covariates, baseline
current smokers who smoked less than a pack/d and past smokers had similar rates of incident diabetes mellitus compared with
never smokers (incidence rate ratios 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.69–1.58 and 1.08, 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.42,
respectively). Baseline current high-intensity smokers had a 79% (95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.81) higher incidence of diabetes
mellitus compared with never smokers. Smoking dose (per 10 pack-years) was also associated with a higher incidence of diabetes
mellitus (incidence rate ratios 1.10, 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.19) in adjusted models.
Conclusions-—High-intensity cigarette smoking and smoking pack-years are associated with an increased risk of developing
diabetes mellitus in blacks. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e007413. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.007413.)

igarette smoking is a major cause of preventable disease
and mortality worldwide, and the impacts of smoking on
cancer and cardiovascular disease are well established.1–3
Smoking also may be an independent risk factor for insulin
resistance and diabetes mellitus; however, there have been
discrepant findings from previous studies examining these
relationships.4–6 Furthermore, despite evidence that smoking
is associated with incident diabetes mellitus in certain ethnic
groups, little is known about the association of cigarette
smoking with diabetes mellitus in blacks, who are dispropor-
tionately affected by obesity and diabetes mellitus.7,8
Racial/ethnic disparities in smoking behaviors have been
described, including longer smoking durations for blacks
compared with whites and lower cessation rates in blacks
compared with both whites and Hispanics.9 In the NHANES II
(National Health and Nutrition Examination Study), smoking
rates were significantly higher in newly diagnosed black versus
white individuals with diabetes mellitus (42% versus 29%,

 respectively).10 Behavioral smoking differences, coupled with a
higher risk of other known diabetes mellitus risk factors, may
augment the risk of diabetes mellitus in blacks who smoke.
Despite evidence suggesting a causal role for smoking
predisposing to diabetes mellitus, the potential mechanisms
that mediate this relationship are not well known. It has been
hypothesized that smoking-induced inflammation or obesity
may contribute to diabetes mellitus onset.11–13 Although
smoking has been associated with reduced body mass index
(BMI), smoking is positively associated with visceral adiposity,
a known risk factor for diabetes mellitus.14 We aimed to
examine the associations of cigarette smoking status, inten-
sity, and dose with incident diabetes mellitus in a large,
prospective black cohort, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). We
also evaluated the influence of measures of adiposity (body
mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]), and
inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) in
this relationship.
Research Design and Methods
Study Cohort
The JHS is a large, prospective cohort study of 5301 blacks
aged 21 to 84 years who were recruited from the tri-county
area surrounding Jackson, MS from 2000 to 2004. We
collected data at 3 participant examinations; we completed
Visit 3 from 2009 to 2013. The 3 participating institutions
(University of Mississippi Medical Center, Tougaloo College,
and Jackson State University) approved the study and the
University of Mississippi Medical Center Institutional Review
Board approved the study. Each participant provided written,
informed consent. The data, analytic methods, and study
materials can be made available to other researchers for
purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the
procedure by following the JHS publications procedures and
data use agreements.15
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
We included participants with available follow-up data includ-
ing diabetes mellitus outcome measures and self-reported
smoking status at Visit 3. We excluded participants with
prevalent diabetes mellitus at baseline (Visit 1, n=733). We
also excluded participants with relevant missing variables at
Visit 3 (n=435).
Assessment of Smoking Status, Intensity, and
Duration
We obtained self-reported cigarette smoking status via
questionnaire at baseline. We defined participants who
smoked >400 cigarettes in their lifetime as “ever smokers.”
We classified those who did not as “never smokers.” We
classified participants who gave a positive response to the
question “Do you now smoke cigarettes” as “baseline current
smokers.” Participants who were classified as “ever” smokers
who did not smoke for at least 30 days at the time of the
examination were classified as “past” smokers. Further
information related to number of cigarettes smoked daily
also was collected. We defined smoking intensity as number
of cigarettes smoked per day. We defined high-intensity
smoking as smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily based on
previous published literature.16 We measured cumulative dose
of smoking in “pack-years,” which we calculated by multiply-
ing the number of packs of cigarettes per day by the number
of years smoking. One participant who identified as a current
smoker did not report the number of cigarettes smoked daily
and therefore was not included in analyses of smoking
intensity or dose relationships.
Diabetes Mellitus Ascertainment
We defined diabetes mellitus as fasting plasma glucose
≥126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5% or International
Federation of Clinical Chemistry units HbA1c 48 mmol/mol,
or use of diabetes mellitus medications within 2 weeks before
the examination. We defined incident diabetes mellitus as
presence of diabetes mellitus at Visit 3 in those participants
who did not have diabetes mellitus at the baseline visit.
Baseline Covariates and Biomarker Measures
Measured at Visit 1
The baseline examination included a home interview, self-
administered questionnaires, and a clinic visit that included
blood and urine collections. Other evaluated risk factors
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Current high-intensity smoking (≥1 pack cigarettes per day)
and smoking dose (pack-years) are associated with incident
diabetes mellitus in blacks.
• Smoking intensity and dose were associated with impaired
pancreatic beta cell function (homeostatic model assess-
ment of pancreatic beta cell function).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Although smoking cessation should be encouraged for
everyone, certain high-risk groups such as blacks who are
disproportionately affected by diabetes mellitus should be
targeted for cessation strategies.

 included education level, physical activity, and alcohol con-
sumption in the past 12 months. Participants self-reported
the highest level of education attained (less than or greater
than a high school diploma). Physical activity was defined as a
summary score of the intensity, frequency, and duration of
activities encountered daily, which has been previously
validated.17
We recorded age, sex, and BMI at the baseline JHS
examination. We averaged 2 measures of WC taken at the
level of the umbilicus on each participant to determine
baseline WC. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure
≥140/90 mm Hg or use of blood pressure–lowering medica-
tion. Additional information such as use of diuretics and
statins
was also collected at each visit. Psychosocial
measures including global stress was measured using the
Global Perceived Stress Scale, which is an 8-item measure of
global perceptions of stressors associated with ongoing
stressful conditions such as employment, relationships,
neighborhood, meeting basic needs, and others.18
We asked each participant to fast overnight for at least
12 hours before their clinic visit. We collected blood and urine
samples according to the National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards as previously reported.19 We measured
glucose and insulin concentrations using standard procedures
that met the College of American Pathologists accreditation
requirements. We used a high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy system (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to measure
glycosylated HbA1c concentrations. We measured total
cholesterol from plasma with the cholesterol oxidase method
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) on a Roche COBAS FARA
centrifugal
analyzer.
We
measured
hs-CRP
using
the
immunoturbidimetric CRP-Latex assay (Kamiya Biomedical
Company, Seattle, WA) with a Hitachi 911 analyzer (Roche
Diagnostics).20 The homeostatic model assessment for insulin
resistance
(HOMA-IR)
was
calculated
using
the
equa-
tion HOMA-IR=(fasting plasma insulin [lU/mL])9(fasting
plasma glucose [mmol/L])�22.5. HOMA-B, a measure of
pancreatic beta cell function, was measured using the
equation: HOMA-B=209insulin�fasting plasma glucose�3.5.
Statistical Analyses
We compared baseline characteristics with v2 tests or 1-way
ANOVA for differences among never, past, and baseline
current smokers. We performed multivariable Poisson regres-
sion models to estimate the association between smoking
status at Visit 1 and incident diabetes mellitus from Visit 1 to
Visit
3 yielding
incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Poisson regression models were
utilized to accommodate different follow-up time intervals
among participants between Visit 1 and Visit 3. In the Poisson
regression models, the models were offset by log (years),
which were calculated as the time between Visit 1 and Visit 3.
Covariates
included
age,
sex,
BMI,
hypertension,
total
cholesterol, education, physical activity, prevalent cardiovas-
cular disease, diuretic use, statin use, perceived stress,
menopause status, and alcohol consumption. Smoking dose
(pack-years) was analyzed as a continuous variable (per
10 pack-years). We conducted additional secondary analyses
adjusting for WC, and adjusting for hs-CRP. Multivariable
linear regression models were used to assess the cross-
sectional associations between smoking status and HOMA-IR
and HOMA-B at Visit 1. All statistical analyses were performed
using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All P values
were 2-tailed and P values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
We studied 2991 participants with follow-up data at Visit 3. At
baseline (Visit 1) we identified 361 current smokers, 502 past
smokers, and 2128 never smokers. Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics of the never smokers, past smokers,
and current smokers. Compared with never smokers, baseline
current and past smokers were more likely to be men
(P<0.001). BMI was highest in never smokers and lowest in
baseline current smokers (P<0.001). Similarly, WC was lowest
in baseline current smokers (P<0.001). Baseline current
smokers were younger, less educated, and were more likely
to have consumed alcohol in the past year than never
smokers and past smokers (all P<0.001). Table 2 shows the
baseline characteristics of participants in each analyzed
smoking intensity category. High-intensity cigarette smokers
(>20 cigarettes per day) were more likely men, less educated,
and more likely to have consumed alcohol in the past
12 months. There were no significant differences in unad-
justed fasting glucose levels (P=0.71) or hemoglobin A1c
(P=0.67); however, unadjusted plasma insulin levels were
lower in high-intensity smokers (P<0.0001). BMI and WC were
also significantly lower in high-intensity smokers (P<0.0001
and P=0.006, respectively).
Between baseline and Visit 3, 479 participants developed
incident
diabetes
mellitus
(mean
follow-up
time
was
8.0�0.9 years). There were 320 incident diabetes mellitus
cases in never smokers (unadjusted incidence rate 15%)
compared with 99 in past smokers (unadjusted incidence rate
20%) and 60 in current smokers (unadjusted incidence rate
17%). After multivariable adjustment, smoking status was not
significantly associated with risk of incident diabetes mellitus
(Table 3). However, further analysis of smoking intensity
showed that among baseline current smokers who smoked
≥20 cigarettes daily, there was a significantly higher inci-
dence of diabetes mellitus compared with never smokers
(P=0.01), which remained significant after further adjustment

 for WC (P=0.01). Smoking dose (pack-years) was also
associated with a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus
(P=0.02). We further adjusted these models to include hs-
CRP to assess the role of inflammation in the increased risk of
diabetes mellitus in smokers. Addition of hs-CRP only slightly
attenuated the risk of incident diabetes mellitus (P=0.03). We
also further adjusted for medications including diuretics and
statins that have been implicated in hyperglycemia. The
findings remained similar after adjusting for diuretic or statin
use (IRR 1.73, 95% CI, 1.10–2.73 for high-intensity smoking
and IRR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.01–1.19 for smoking dose). As
mental stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of
diabetes mellitus,21 we additionally adjusted for perceived
stress and there were no significant changes in the relation-
ship between high-intensity smoking (IRR 1.76, 95% CI, 1.12–
2.78) or dose (IRR 1.10, 95%, CI 1.01–1.20). The risk of
diabetes mellitus has also been reported to increase in
postmenopausal women.22 After adjustment for menopause

 status, the risk for incident diabetes mellitus increased in
high-intensity
smokers
(IRR
2.01,
95%
CI,
1.00–4.06),
although not quite statistically significant.
We also assessed insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and pancre-
atic beta cell function (HOMA-B) to gain mechanistic insight into
the relationship between smoking and incident diabetes
mellitus. Smoking status and intensity were not significantly
associated with HOMA-IR; however, smoking dose (pack-years)
was associated with a slightly lower HOMA-IR, suggesting that
insulin resistance is not the mechanism of the relationship
between smoking and incident diabetes mellitus (Table 4).
However, HOMA-B was lower in current compared with never
smokers, and smoking intensity and smoking dose were
associated with lower HOMA-B (Table 5). Therefore, reduced
beta cell function is the likely factor leading to our findings.
Discussion
Our findings from a large cohort of blacks demonstrate high-
intensity cigarette smoking (at least 1 pack per day) and
higher pack-years of smoking were associated with incident
diabetes mellitus. Additionally, adjusting for WC and hs-CRP
minimally attenuated the incidence rate.
In 2014, the Surgeon General Report was published on the
health consequences of smoking that stated there is sufficient
evidence “to infer that cigarette smoking is a cause of
diabetes” and that the “risk of developing diabetes is 30% to
40% higher in active smokers than nonsmokers.”23 Several
large prospective cohorts have demonstrated increased risk
of incident diabetes mellitus in current smokers compared
with never smokers. The Nurses’ Health Study, a prospective
study of over 100 000 women with 24 years of follow-up,

Smoking and Incident Diabetes Mellitus in Blacks
White et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 showed a dose-dependent increased risk of incident type 2
diabetes
mellitus
in
current
smokers
compared
with
nonsmokers (relative risk 1.39 for current smokers smoking
1–14 cigarettes per day and relative risk 1.98 for ≥25 ci-
garettes per day).24 Whereas that study had a very large
number of participants, over 93% of the participants were
white and they did not analyze specific races separately. In
the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study, current smokers
exhibited a significantly higher incidence of diabetes mellitus
compared with never smokers (odds ratio 2.66, P=0.001).6
Although many of these studies demonstrated positive and
dose-dependent associations with current cigarette smoking
with incident diabetes mellitus, most included very limited
numbers of black participants. Other multiethnic cohort
studies such as the MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atheroscle-
rosis) did not observe independent associations between
cigarette smoking and insulin resistance.5
Given the discrepant published findings and limited data
evaluating the link between smoking and incident diabetes
mellitus in blacks, our findings have important implications.
This is especially important given that almost 18% of blacks
are current smokers and blacks have higher rates of diabetes
mellitus compared with other ethnic groups.25 Furthermore,
many previous studies reporting that smoking was associated
with incident diabetes mellitus19 were from a period of time
when smoking intensity was higher and composition of
cigarettes differed from that of current smokers, including
unfiltered cigarettes and higher tar content.26,27
Inflammation has been proposed as a precursor to the
development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.28 Previous studies,
including analyses from the JHS, have observed a positive
relationship between hs-CRP (biomarker of inflammation) and
incident diabetes mellitus.13,29 However, this association was
largely explained by measures of obesity including BMI and
WC. In our study, we further adjusted for hs-CRP, which only
slightly
attenuated
the
incidence
rate,
suggesting
inflammation may play a minor role in the relationship
between smoking and incident diabetes mellitus.
We further evaluated relationships of smoking status,
intensity, and dose with HOMA-IR and HOMA-B, measures of
insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell function, respec-
tively. Only smoking dose was slightly associated with HOMA-
IR, suggesting insulin resistance is not the main contributor to
the association of high-intensity smoking with incident
diabetes mellitus. However, HOMA-B was lower in current
smokers compared with never smokers and with increasing
smoking dose (pack-years), suggesting reduced beta cell
function is the likely factor leading to our findings.
Our report does have some limitations. First, the JHS is an
all-black cohort, so our findings may not generalize to other
ethnic groups. Second, our findings are based on a small
number of incident cases of diabetes mellitus, particularly
among current smokers. However, to our knowledge, our
study is the largest study of the relationship between smoking
and incident diabetes mellitus in blacks who have higher rates
of diabetes mellitus. Most participants who developed
diabetes mellitus were prediabetic (HbA1c 5.7–6.4 mmol/
mol). Therefore, current high-intensity smoking may impose
an additional risk in those with a propensity to diabetes
mellitus. Cigarette smoking was self-reported in the JHS;
therefore, there is potential for misclassification. Unfortu-
nately, urine cotinine levels were not measured in the
participants, which would have provided a more objective
exposure level of cigarette smoking. Furthermore, the type of
cigarettes that the participants smoked was not available for
analysis. We did not account for change in smoking status
over follow-up because of limited availability of longitudinal
smoking data in the JHS. As our study was observational, we
cannot exclude residual confounding, and cannot infer
causality. It is also possible that genetic variation, which we
did not assess, may play a role in the impact of smoking on
incident diabetes mellitus.30 Last, we cannot adequately

 account for second-hand cigarette smoking since such data
were not collected at Visit 1.
In conclusion, in a large prospective cohort of blacks,
baseline current high-intensity cigarette smoking and smoking
pack years were associated with incident diabetes mellitus in
adjusted models. In general, people should be encouraged to
stop smoking. Our data suggest that certain high-risk groups
among blacks should be particularly identified for smoking
cessation.
