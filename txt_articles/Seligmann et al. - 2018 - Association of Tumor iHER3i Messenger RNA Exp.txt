Question: Can tumor mRNA expression of HER3 predict response to anti-EGFR 
agents in RAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer? 
 
Findings:  In this study of patients in a large phase 3 trial of irinotecan 
with/without panitumumab, RAS wild-type patients whose tumors had high 
HER3 mRNA expression benefitted markedly from panitumumab, but patients 
with RAS wild-type low HER3 tumors gained no benefit. The biomarker/ 
treatment interaction was significant. 
 
Meaning: Tumor HER3 mRNA expression may be a useful predictive biomarker 
for anti-EGFR therapy in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer: further study is 
urgently warranted.

Abstract 
Importance:  
EGFR (HER1) signaling depends on ligand binding and dimerization with itself or 
other HER receptors. We previously showed in a randomized trial that high 
EGFR ligand expression is predictive of panitumumab benefit in advanced 
colorectal cancer. Tumor expression of HER3 may further refine the RAS wt 
population benefitting from anti-EGFR agents. 
 
Objective:  
To examine HER3 mRNA expression as a prognostic and predictive biomarker 
for anti-EGFR therapy in a randomized clinical trial of panitumumab. 
 
Design, setting and participants:  
Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study from the PICCOLO trial 
which tested the addition of panitumumab to irinotecan therapy in patients with 
KRAS wt aCRC who experienced failure with prior fluoropyrimidine treatment. 
HER3 was assessed as a prognostic marker, then as a predictive biomarker in 
RAS-wt patients, first as a continuous variable then as a binary (high vs low) 
variable. Relationship with MEK-AKT pathway mutations and EGFR ligands 
(EREG/AREG) were also assessed. 
 
Main outcomes and measures: 
  
4 
Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points 
were response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). 
 
Results: 
 
Higher HER3 was weakly prognostic for OS (HR per 2-fold change 0.91[0.83-
0.99],p=0.04), but not PFS (HR=0.93[0.83-1.05],p=0.25).  Higher HER3 was 
strongly predictive, being associated with prolonged PFS on IrPan 
(HR=0.71[0.61-0.82],p< 0.001), but not irinotecan (HR=0.96[0.82-1.13],p=0.65) 
in RAS wt patients; biomarker/treatment interaction (p=0.001). Similar 
biomarker/treatment interaction was seen for OS (p=0.004).  
 
In an exploratory binary model, dividing the population at the 66thcentile, HER3 
was strongly predictive of panitumumab benefit: in HER3-high patients, median 
PFS was 8.2 (IrPan) vs 4.4 months (irinotecan), HR=0.33[0.19-0.58],p<0.0005; 
HER3-low patients gained no benefit: 3.3 (IrPan) vs 4.3 months (Ir), 
HR=0.96[0.67-1.38],p=0.84; interaction p=0.002. The binary model was also 
predictive for OS: interaction p=0.01.   
 
Combining HER3 and ligand data, patients with HER3-high, AREG/EREG-high 
tumors gained markedly from panitumumab: PFS HR =0.24[0.11-0.51],p<0.005; 
OS HR=0.36[0.18-0.73],p=0.004; conversely HER3-low, AREG/EREG-low 
patients did not benefit (PFS HR=1.14[0.73-1.79],p=0.57; OS HR=1.44[0.92-
2.26],p=0.11).

Conclusions and Relevance: 
 
High HER3 identified RAS-wt patients who gained markedly from 
panitumumab, and those who did not, with statistically significant 
biomarker/treatment interactions for PFS and OS. This finding provides insight 
into the mechanism of anti-EGFR agents and is of potential clinical utility.

Background 
 
Whilst RAS-mutations identify advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC) patients who 
will not benefit from anti-EGFR agents,[1] RAS-wt status does not reliably predict 
who will.[2]  We recently published clinical validation of combined tumor mRNA 
overexpression of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) 
as a predictive biomarker for panitumumab in RAS-wt aCRC[3] in a large 
randomized trial (PICCOLO: irinotecan/panitumumab [IrPan] vs irinotecan for 
second-line treatment of KRAS-wt aCRC[2]).  
 
The activity of agents targeting EGFR (HER1) may also depend upon interactions 
with other HER receptors. HER family interdependence is well documented;[4] 
HER3, unlike other HER receptors, cannot generate signaling through 
homodimerization but is an obligate heterodimer, predominantly with EGFR or 
HER2.[5] The equilibrium between HER3 heterodimers may be a key factor in 
downstream EGFR family signaling.[6,7,8].  
 
We investigate the role of HER3 tumor mRNA expression in aCRC in pre-
treatment samples from the PICCOLO trial, first as a prognostic biomarker, then 
as a predictive biomarker for panitumumab efficacy. We further investigate its 
relationship with AREG and EREG, with a view to future development as a 
clinically applicable selection tool.

Patients and Methods 
The results of the PICCOLO trial (ISRCTN93248876) have been reported 
previously.[2]  This study includes all patients with adequate stored tumor 
material. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue 
sections and HER3 expression measured by reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 1).  
 
The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints were OS and 12-week 
response rate (RR). The primary analysis assessed HER3 expression as a 
continuous variable (log-transformed to base 2). In a planned exploratory 
analysis HER3 expression was assessed as a dichotomous variable, using a range 
of cut-points to achieve optimum discrimination for biomarker/treatment 
interaction. Further details are provided in the Supplementary material. 
 
 
Results 
331 patients had tumor available for RNA; HER3 expression measurement was 
successful in 308. Baseline characteristics by treatment arm were well balanced 
(Supplementary Table 2), with no significant differences from the overall trial 
population.  
 
  
8 
RAS/RAF genotype data (KRASc.12-13,61,146 NRASc.12-13,61 and BRAFV600E) was 
available for all cases. 209/308 (67.8%) patients were wt for all KRAS/NRAS 
codons and form the primary analysis population for this study (Supplementary 
Figure 1). HER2 expression data was available for 210/308 (68%) patients;[9] 
however, overexpression was found in only 3/210 (1.4%), precluding 
meaningful analysis. 
 
HER3 was not significantly associated with RAS mutation status (p=0.46), but 
was lower in BRAF-mutant and PIK3CA-mutated groups compared with wt 
(p<0.05 and p=0.02 respectively). HER3 levels were weakly positively correlated 
with both AREG and EREG levels �Spearman�s rho ���� for each� p�������� In RAS 
wt patients, HER3 levels were lower in right-sided compared with left-sided 
tumors (p=0.02), but no association in the whole population (p=0.09). 
 
Higher log2 HER3 was prognostic for improved OS (HR per 2-fold change 
0.91,[0.83�0.99],p=0.04), but not PFS (HR=0.93,[0.83-1.05],p=0.25) in the whole 
population(Supplementary Table 3).  
 
In RAS-wt patients, increasing HER3 expression was significantly predictive for 
panitumumab benefit on PFS  (IrPan: HR=0.71[0.61-0.82] per 2-fold increase, 
p<0.0005; Ir: HR=0.96[0.82-1.13],p=0.65; interactions: unadjusted p=0.001 
(Table 1), estimates were similar after adjusting for performance status (PS) and 
previous response, interaction p=0.003)(data not shown). HER3 was also 
significantly predictive for panitumumab benefit on OS in RAS wt patients (IrPan: 
  
9 
HR=0.73[0.64-0.83],p<0.0005; 
Ir: 
HR=0.93[0.83-1.05],p=0.25; 
interactions: 
unadjusted p=0.004 (Table 1); adjusted p=0.006 (data not shown)). This effect 
was independent of BRAF-mutation status and primary tumour location 
(PTL)(Supplementary Table 4). 
 
Preplanned predictive analyses of HER3 expression dichotomized at the 50th, 
66th, 80th and 90th centile in RAS wt patients (Supplementary Table 5) showed 
that at the 66th centile, there was no PFS benefit from panitumumab in low 
expressers (median PFS 3.3 months (IrPan) vs 4.3 months (irinotecan); 
HR=0.96[0.67-1.38],p=0.84), clear benefit in high expressers (HR=0.33[0.19-
0.58],p<0.0005)(Figure 1) and strong evidence for interaction (p=0.002). 
Secondary analyses adjusting for PS and previous response showed similar 
estimates (interaction p=0.008, data not shown). This cut-point was therefore 
selected for all subsequent analyses to define �HER3-high� and �HER3-low� 
populations. Dichotomized HER3 was also predictive for OS in RAS wt patients, 
though here the interaction was driven in part by a negative impact of 
panitumumab in HER3-low patients. In RAS-wt, HER3-high patients, median OS 
was 14.6 (IrPan) vs 13.2 months (irinotecan) (HR=0.66[0.40-1.10],p=0.11), 
while in RAS-wt, HER3-low patients, median OS was 8.3 (IrPan) vs 10.3 months 
(irinotecan); HR=1.56[1.09-2.23],p=0.02); interaction p=0.01 (Table 2 and 
Figure 1). Secondary analyses adjusting for PS and previous response showed 
similar estimates, interaction p=0.02 (data not shown). The dichotomized HER3 
model was also independent of BRAF-mutation status and PTL (Supplementary 
Table 4). 
  
10 
 
Dichotomized HER3 was not significantly prognostic for OS (HR=0.85[0.60-
1.20],p=0.35) or PFS (HR=1.03[0.73-1.45],p=0.86) (Supplementary Table 3 and 
Supplementary Figure 2).   
 
In RAS-wt, HER3-high patients, 12-week response rate (RR) was 48.6% (IrPan) 
vs 12.1% (irinotecan) (Relative risk=4.01[1.50-10.68]), while in RAS-wt, HER3-
low patients RR was 24.6% (IrPan) vs 11.1% (irinotecan) (Relative 
risk=2.21[1.03-4.75]) (interaction p=0.34) (Supplementary Table 6). 
 
We previously reported that in a dichotomous ligand mRNA expression model, 
�EREG-high and/or AREG-high� was strongly predictive of panitumumab PFS 
benefit in RAS-wt patients, and that as a continuous variable AREG was the more 
predictive of the two ligands.[3]  
 
As continuous variables in a joint model, HER3 and AREG were independent 
predictors of IrPan PFS benefit (interaction HER3*treatment p=0.03; 
AREG*treatment p=0.05), while for OS the evidence was equivocal (interaction 
HER3 p=0.07; AREG p=0.21) (Supplementary Table 7). 
 
In an exploratory dichotomous model, the RAS-wt population was divided into 
four groups: HER3-high/, AREG/EREG-high[n=42]; HER3-high/, AREG/EREG-
low[n=27]; 
HER3-low/, 
AREGEREG-high[n=53]; 
HER3-low, 
AREG/EREG-
  
11 
low[n=87]. Marked panitumumab benefit was observed in the HER3-high, 
AREG/EREG-high group (PFS HR=0.24[0.11-0.51],p<0.005; OS HR=0.36[0.18-
0.73],p=0.004). Conversely, the HER3-low, AREG/EREG-low group showed no 
evidence of benefit (PFS HR=1.14[0.73-1.79],p=0.57; OS HR=1.44[0.92-
2.26],p=0.11).  Patients in the two intermediate groups had intermediate effects 
for PFS (Supplementary Table 8).

Discussion 
 
The work described here represents the largest dedicated analysis of HER3 
expression in CRC to date. We found no good evidence for HER3 as a prognostic 
marker but found HER3 overexpression to be significantly associated with 
benefit from panitumumab.  
 
Overall in PICCOLO panitumumab produced a significant improvement in PFS 
but not OS.[2] It is therefore encouraging that HER3 was significantly predictive 
for OS as well as PFS. Furthermore, in our combined HER3-and-ligands model, 
patients with HER3-high, AREG/EREG-high tumors achieved marked and 
significant OS benefit with panitumumab (HR=0.36[0.18-0.73], p=0.004).  These 
findings are interesting, but must be treated with caution, especially given that 
the HER3 cut-point for dichotomization was derived internally, from this dataset. 
 
The interaction between HER3 expression and anti-EGFR agent efficacy in aCRC 
has been studied previously in 2 smaller series.[9,10] Instead HER3 
overexpression was associated with inferior clinical outcomes with anti-EGFR 
agents. The present study is a dedicated comprehensive analysis in a mature, 
large, randomized trial, allowing for adjustments for likely confounders. 
Preclinical work supports both hypotheses: heregulin activation of HER3 might 
trigger an alternate signaling pathway circumventing EGFR blockade,[8,11] 
supporting HER3 overexpression as a negative predictive marker. Alternatively, 
given its role as an obligate heterodimer, HER3 expression could identify those 
  
13 
tumors most reliant on EGFR signaling through autocrine feedback loops, and 
more likely to respond to EGFR-targeted agents.[7]  
 
In conclusion, this study suggests that high HER3 expression is related to anti-
EGFR agent activity in aCRC, and may offer a clinically useful selection 
biomarker. Prior to clinical application, re-validation of the findings and refining 
of the cut-point is required, in well-designed hypothesis-based studies using 
other randomized datasets.
