Abstract
Cyclical expression of cell-autonomous circadian clock components and key metabolic regulators 
coordinate often discordant and distant cellular processes for efficient metabolism. Perturbation of 
these cycles, either by genetic manipulation, disruption of light/dark cycles, or, most relevant to 
the human population, via eating patterns, contributes to obesity and dysmetabolism. Time-
restricted feeding (TRF), during which time of access to food is restricted to a few hours, without 
caloric restriction, supports robust metabolic cycles and protects against nutritional challenges that 
predispose to obesity and dysmetabolism. The mechanism by which TRF imparts its benefits is 
not fully understood but likely involves entrainment of metabolically active organs through gut 
signaling. Understanding the relationship of feeding pattern and metabolism could yield novel 
therapies for the obesity pandemic.
Circadian Rhythms and Metabolism
More than one-third of adults in the USA are obese [1], and this exerts a significant burden 
on national healthcare spending [2]. In the past, an underappreciation of the complexity of 
bodyweight regulation led to ineffective or scientifically unsound recommendations [3]. In 
recent years, tremendous resources have been committed to curtail obesity, and these efforts 
have had some success [4]. From 2003 to 2012 the prevalence of obesity in the USA has 
plateaued [1], after increasing consistently in the previous four decades. Recent findings 
have dramatically improved our understanding of the components of metabolic homeostasis 
and how their perturbation can lead to obesity. Whereas obesity has long been viewed as a 
simple behavioral problem of overnutrition, now it is appreciated as a phenomenon 
involving multiple genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, as well as multiple organs 
and commensal organisms. In this review we discuss one facet of the mammalian metabolic 
homeostasis – the impact of feeding time on metabolism as a whole.

 Daily Rhythms: The Central Circadian Pacemaker and the Sleep/Wake Cycle
From cyanobacteria to humans, the majority of organisms have physiological rhythms that 
cycle with a period of approximately 24 h. The pervasiveness of these rhythms across 
organisms spanning kingdoms indicates that there is an evolutionary advantage to coordinate 
cellular machinery to anticipated external stimuli [5,6]. In mammals, virtually every tissue or 
physiological function exhibits diurnal oscillations. These patterns on a systemic level 
appear to be temporally coordinated by neuronal and chemical networks which are in turn 
maintained by various timekeeping mechanisms in the central nervous system (Figure 1) [7]. 
Central to these rhythms is the endogenous circadian rhythmicity of the hypothalamic 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is entrained by light [8]. The other dominant daily 
rhythm is the sleep/wake cycle driven by both circadian system and sleep homeostasis 
[9,10].
The SCN is the dominant circadian pacemaker [11]. Ambient light is detected by specialized 
retinal ganglion cells that project to SCN neurons via the retinohypothalamic tract, as well as 
through multi-synaptic, indirect pathways via the thalamus [12]. In turn, SCN output is 
mediated by circadian variation of its neuronal firing, or release of a number of peptides, 
including arginine vasopressin (AVP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), gastrin-
releasing peptide (GRP), transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), prokineticin 2, and 
cardiotrophin-like cytokine. These diffusible and synaptic outputs synchronize and modulate 
the activity of the autonomic nervous system and the release of hormones from the 
hypothalamus, which in turn help to maintain vigorous oscillation of circadian proteins in 
the peripheral tissue, although the mechanisms are not yet well understood.
Sleep/wake homeostasis has been far more difficult to study. However, sleep is essential for 
maintaining metabolic health [13–15], likely by facilitating the removal of waste byproducts 
and restoration of necessary metabolites [16]. Although the sleep/wake cycle and the signals 
from SCN are highly linked, sleep is heavily influenced by a sleep homeostat akin to an 
hourglass oscillation. For example, a neural sleep factor (‘S’) rises during waking, and 
decays during sleep, hence regulating the timing, amount, and intensity of sleep [17]. 
Melatonin, a pineal gland-derived hormone, plays an important role in synchronizing the 
sleep/wake cycle and the circadian clock [18,19].
The pathways by which the central circadian system and the sleep/wake cycles control 
hormonal release, peripheral clock oscillations, and metabolism in other tissues are still 
being actively investigated. Neurohumoral and neuronal signaling from SCN and brain 
regions involved in sleep regulation, however, can affect the activity of the hypothalamus 
and influence the pulsatile release of various hormones, which in turn affect the intermittent 
release of pituitary hormones [20]. Hence, many hormones that are released by the pituitary 
are circadian, with their levels oscillating throughout the day. These include plasma levels of 
cortisol (high in the morning), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH, high at night), prolactin 
(high at night), and growth hormone (high at night), which all normally have ~24 h 
oscillation. In non-diabetic participants, the response to a glucose challenge is very different 
with the time of day, independently of the route of administration, resulting in higher plasma 
glucose levels in the evening than in the morning [21]. Post-meal insulin levels also oscillate

 during a 24 h period, increasing toward the evening and decreasing in the morning. Even 
sensitivity to insulin is circadian, although not mediated by the hypothalamus [22].
Together, the central circadian pacemaker and sleep/wake homeostasis have tremendous 
influence over the endocrine system. They can coordinate the physiological activity of 
various organs with the timing of the release of hormones. As a result, glucose homeostasis, 
as an example, is highly dynamic; baseline serum glucose and insulin levels, response to 
glucose or identical meal boluses, and sensitivity to insulin itself, all display circadian 
fluctuations [21].
Circadian Regulators and Metabolism
Our understanding of the influence of the circadian clock on metabolism has significantly 
advanced with the discovery of clock proteins that serve as biological clocks. These proteins, 
expressed in nearly every eukaryotic cell as well as in some prokaryotic organisms, allow 
each individual cell to have an autonomous, self-sustained mechanism to keep track of a 24 
h day [6]. These circadian oscillators are characterized by (i) sustained and persistent period 
length under stable conditions, (ii) the ability to entrain to external stimuli, and (iii) not 
being affected by wide variations in temperature. Circadian oscillations are driven by 
interlocked negative feedback circuits of activators such as CLOCK, brain and muscle 
ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR), as well as 
by inhibitors such as cryptochrome (CRY), period (PER), and REV-ERB (nuclear receptor 
1D1/2, NR1D1/2) that act as master regulators. Together these proteins produce a cell 
autonomous, self-sustained transcriptional rhythm of their own protein levels, and control 
the circadian expression of many target genes [23]. Importantly, they are able to synchronize 
to temporally relevant external events such as light, temperature, and feeding.
Transcriptomic studies show that up to 45% of all transcripts in mice display 24 h 
oscillations [24]. Many of these genes are key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, 
and of oxidative phosphorylation [25,26]. Metabolism in animals is highly circadian, 
coordinated not only by the cell-autonomous circadian rhythms but also by the feeding/
fasting cycles which together drive genomic programs [27–29]. Regulators of nutrient 
homeostasis such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cAMP response element-
binding protein (CREB), and v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT/
PKB), which are driven by daily rhythms of feeding and fasting, are coupled with circadian 
proteins. For example, fasting-sensitive protein kinase AMPK can phosphorylate CRY and 
target it for degradation, thereby constituting a mechanism by which fasting influences the 
circadian clock [30]. Feeding has a wide-ranging impact on rhythmic hepatic gene 
expression [28]. For example, cAMP-induced CREB activation upregulates Per 
transcription, thereby connecting the transcriptional circadian oscillation to G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) that use cAMP as a second messenger [31]. Several hormones, 
including glucagon, signal through a cAMP pathway. Moreover, post-prandial 
thermogenesis can also activate heat-shock factors, which subsequently modulate 
transcription of clock components. Consequently, feeding and fasting rhythms have a 
profound impact on rhythmic hepatic gene expression [28].

 The contribution of cell-autonomous clock and feeding/fasting rhythms on the oscillation of 
the hepatic transcriptome has been systematically examined. Under ad libitum access to a 
standard diet, mice show a daily rhythm in food intake with the majority of food being 
consumed at night. In these mice, up to 3000 transcripts oscillate daily. However, in the 
absence of any food intake only ~350 hepatic transcripts are rhythmic in a 24 h period [28]. 
A large number of hepatic rhythmic transcripts under ad libitum feeding conditions are 
driven by the daily rhythm in food intake. The contribution of feeding- and fasting-induced 
genes to hepatic rhythms is more apparent in mice fed an isocaloric diet exclusively during 
the day. These mice with distinct periods of feeding and fasting show daily rhythms in up to 
5000 hepatic transcripts. The phase of oscillation in the clock components and of other 
rhythmic transcripts is also changed in day-fed mice [28]. Hence, timing of food intake 
determines the phase of the hepatic clock. However, a distinct feeding/fasting rhythm alone 
cannot drive a vast majority of rhythmic transcription. While mice lacking CRY proteins 
show no discernible rhythm in daily feeding and have no significant hepatic transcript 
oscillation, under a isocaloric feeding/fasting cycle daily oscillations are restored in only 700 
hepatic transcripts [28]. Similar effects are seen in liver metabolites. Hepatic lipidomic 
analysis of wild-type and Per1/2 null mice showed that a similar fraction of lipids (16–17%), 
including triglycerides, oscillated in both mouse strains [32]. However, the phases of these 
oscillations are different in the two mouse strains. Nighttime-restricted feeding increased the 
number of cycling lipids (~50%) in both conditions, and made their oscillation similar in 
both strains of mice. This implies that feeding/fasting rhythms can shape the phase of 
hepatic lipid accumulations [32].
These experiments conclude that a functional circadian clock, food availability, and the 
temporal pattern of feeding are important in determining the features of hepatic circadian 
transcriptome.
The Consequences of Dyssynchrony
Lessons from Animal Models
The importance of the interconnectedness between the circadian clock and dysmetabolism, 
such as obesity and diabetes, became clear in genetic mouse models. Mice with whole-body 
or tissue-specific loss of function or hypomorphic alleles of circadian genes often develop 
perturbation in glucose and lipid homeostasis, insulin resistance, and other hallmarks of 
metabolic disease (Table 1) [29,33,34]. Early observations of severe metabolic dysregulation 
in Bmal1−/−mice led to a systematic investigation of metabolic homeostasis in almost every 
circadian mutant mouse model [35]. Dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, with decreased 
gluconeogenesis, and increased insulin sensitivity occurs in Bmal1 knockout mice [36]. 
Double knockout of Rev-erbα and Rev-erbβ causes deregulated lipid metabolism [37]. 
Some of these genetic mouse models display aberrant feeding patterns, suggesting that a 
suboptimal feeding time may be contributing to metabolic disease. For example, Per1S714G 
mutant mice, where a serine to glycine mutation in PER1 causes acceleration of the 
molecular feedback loop, had a food intake time that differed with energy expenditure time 
by several hours [38].

 Disruption of feeding/fasting rhythms, circadian gene expression, or, in most cases, both, is 
commonly found in animal model of obesity and dysmetabolism. For example, in diet-
induced obesity (DIO), animals consume a significant amount of food outside of their 
normal nocturnal window that dampens the normal feeding/fasting cycles [39,40]. This is 
accompanied by disruption of the oscillation of circadian clock genes and their transcription 
targets involved in metabolism. In addition, obese (ob/ob) mice, that lack leptin and thus 
exhibit hyperphagia, have dampened oscillation of their circadian clock genes before 
becoming obese [41,42]. Hence, animal models of obesity and dysmetabolism often have 
dyssynchrony between circadian clock genes and feeding/fasting driven metabolic 
regulators.
Light/Dark Cycles and Feeding Time
The role of maintaining a diurnal feeding rhythms in metabolism has also been demonstrated 
through disrupting normal circadian activity by altering external temporal cues such as light 
and feeding time [33]. For example, a classic ‘shift work’ experiment, in which nocturnal 
rats are required to be active during daytime, leads to discombobulation of circadian gene 
rhythmicity and with it obesity and other metabolic disturbances [43]. Adding a dim light to 
the dark phase of the light/dark cycle increased nighttime food consumption and led to 
dysmetabolism in wild-type mice [44]. In addition, altering feeding time by restricting 
access to food to a smaller time-window can separate the effects of temporal cues such as 
light on the SCN from the feeding/ fasting rhythms in peripheral tissue [45]. Restricting 
feeding of mice, which are nocturnal animals, to daytime leads to weight gain [46]. All these 
studies demonstrate that, even without genetic manipulation of the mice, obesity and 
dysmetabolism can be induced in wild-type animals when circadian clock and feeding/
fasting rhythms are dyssynchronized.
There is strong evidence that this phenomenon also exists in humans. Individuals with 
specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CLOCK gene (e.g., CLOCK 
3111T/C, rs1554483G, rs4864548A) are more susceptible to metabolic syndrome and 
obesity, while other SNPs (e.g., rs1801260/CGC) are protective for the development of 
obesity [47–49]. The functional role of these SNPs is not yet fully understood.
Circadian and metabolic dyssynchrony has also been studied at a population level in shift 
workers, as well in an inpatient laboratory setting. Shift workers, or laborers that work 
outside typical daytime hours, comprise about 15–20% of the workforce population in the 
USA [50]. There is strong evidence that they are particularly predisposed to obesity and 
metabolic syndrome [51–54]. This is perhaps due to the uncoupling of clock systems and the 
hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [8,55,56]. Other factors that affect the normal 
cyclical oscillation along this axis (e.g., chronic stress or treatment with high doses of 
corticosteroids) also lead to metabolic syndrome [57], although it is unclear whether this can 
specifically be related to circadian dyssynchrony.
Laboratory studies on humans have also shown that dyssynchrony between feeding/fasting 
time and the circadian clock can lead to obesity and dysmetabolism. Simulated night shift 
work induced reduced daily energy expenditure by approximately 12–16% [58]. There were 
also decreased levels of leptin and peptide YY which signal satiety. Individuals who have

 been subjected to circadian misalignment for 10 days had elevated post-prandial glucose, 
elevated insulin (that is, more insulin resistance), and increased mean arterial pressure [59].
In conclusion, there is mounting evidence in both animal models and humans that aberrantly 
timed feeding, out of synchrony with the light-entrained central circadian clock, leads to 
obesity and dysmetabolism. Synchronized oscillation of these two systems likely 
coordinates distant and often discordant cellular and physiological processes for more-
optimal energy metabolism. At a cultural level, with the advent of electricity, modern 
humans are exposed to far more prolonged illumination [19]. There is also increasing 
evidence that aberrant feeding patterns are prevalent in our society today, wherein variation 
in eating patterns can be observed with people eating more frequently throughout the day 
and with a bias toward late-night eating [60]. Together these two phenomena are further 
environmental contributors to the rise in the prevalence of obesity over the past several 
decades.
TRF Induces Synchrony
Until recently it was not clear whether aiming to synchronize feeding/fasting times with the 
central circadian clock would prevent or even reverse obesity and its associated metabolic 
diseases. However, recent evidence has shown that synchrony between feeding rhythms and 
circadian oscillations can be restored.
TRF in Mice
Using TRF to allow mice access to food only in the nocturnal phase can promote natural 
feeding rhythms and restore synchrony with circadian oscillations [61]. TRF restores cycling 
of metabolic regulators such as CREB, mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), and 
AMPK, and downstream signaling pathways, as well as oscillations of the circadian clock 
and expression of their target genes, which are dampened or obliterated by DIO. The 
metabolic benefits of restoring these rhythms are tremendous (Figure 2, Key Figure). 
Although the mice consume similar amount of calories and have similar activity levels, they 
do not become obese on a high-fat diet (HFD). TRF mice display significantly less adiposity 
and improved glucose and lipid homeostasis. This is accompanied with decreased leptin 
resistance, decreased hepatic inflammation and steatosis, decreased ectopic lipid deposition, 
and even improved motor coordination [62–64].
Although TRF affords protection against the development of obesity from the nutritional 
challenge of HFD (61% dietary fat), it was unclear if it was effective against dysmetabolism 
caused by other types of nutritional challenges. However, in a later study Chaix et al. showed 
that the TRF protocol attenuated the metabolic consequences from a variety of obesogenic 
diets, not only high-fat, but also high-fructose and high-sucrose diets [65]. Furthermore, 
TRF reversed the progression of dysmetabolism in mice with pre-existing obesity and 
insulin resistance. The benefits of TRF were directly proportional to the length of time of 
food restriction. That is, mice with restricted access of 9 h fared better than those who had 
access for 15 h.
These initial studies showed that TRF is particularly effective against DIO and other 
nutritional challenges that cause obesity. TRF also proved to be effective against at least one

 genetic cause of obesity. In Per1S714G mutated mice, where feeding rhythms are perturbed 
and the animals are particularly susceptible to DIO [38], TRF prevented the weight gain 
displayed by PER1 mutated mice on a HFD. Furthermore, PER1 mutated mice with ad 
libitum access to HFD had significant misalignment of various behavior measurements such 
as feeding phase and oxygen consumption, although their overall locomotor activity, food 
intake, and oxygen consumption were not significantly different from controls. However, 
TRF improved alignment between feeding phase and oxygen consumption [38].
In murine models, TRF also leads to improvement of fatty acid turnover in the liver, brown 
and white adipose tissue, and cardiac muscle [61,64,65]. Furthermore, nighttime-restricted 
feeding considerably reduced hepatic lipid levels (including triglyceride) in wild-type mice 
fed a normal chow diet. This suggests that fasting/feeding rhythms also affect the amount of 
hepatic lipid accumulation [32].
The function of TRF in aging and heart health was recently assessed in a Drosophila model 
[66]. As in murine models, 12 h TRF in Drosophila, where caloric intake and activity were 
unchanged, led to prevention of weight gain and deceleration of age- and diet-induced 
decline in cardiac function including arrhythmia. These benefits appeared to be mediated not 
only by the oscillation of circadian clock gene but also by the mitochondrial electron 
transport chain, and by the TCP-1 ring complex chaperonin that assists the folding of 
proteins upon ATP hydrolysis.
TRF in Humans
Although no studies in humans have yet specifically tested TRF, some small studies about 
timed eating suggest that restoring feeding/fasting cycles with light/dark circadian rhythms 
can have weight-loss benefits [67]. For example, in a cohort of patients undergoing a 
behavioral weight-loss treatment, those who consumed their calories earlier in the day were 
more likely to lose weight, compared to those who ate later [68]. Another study, where two 
groups of obese women were randomized to consuming an isocaloric meal during breakfast 
or dinner, showed that high-calorie breakfast consumers had much better fasting glucose, 
insulin sensitivity, and improved lipid profile compared to the high-calorie dinner consumers 
[69]. As discussed above, recent studies have demonstrated that the timing of feeding in the 
general population is diverse [60], suggesting that more precision medicine is needed to 
identify those who have poor feeding patterns, and selectively recommend behavioral 
changes in these individuals to improve their metabolism. Ongoing effort to monitor the 
daily pattern of food intake, sleep, and activity using smartphones (http://
www.mycircadianclock.org) in a large cohort will quantify the epidemic of circadian 
disruption and identify at-risk individuals.
Multiple studies show that TRF, where feeding has been restricted to the active time phase, 
has significant metabolic benefits. TRF prevents obesity and improves glucose and lipid 
homeosta-sis, and has beneficial effects on other metabolic organs such as the liver, heart, 
and brown adipose tissue. These affects are accompanied with synchrony and more robust 
oscillation between circadian effectors and metabolic regulators that are entrained to 
feeding/fasting cycles. However, although restoration of circadian and metabolic synchrony 
is correlated with improved metabolism, the mechanism by which this improvement occurs

 is not yet fully understood. There are still many gaps in understanding the relationship 
between light-entrained central circadian oscillations with those in the periphery that may be 
entrained by other external stimuli such as feeding. In addition, although it is clear that light-
entrainment occurs with specialized retinal ganglion cell signaling to the SCN, feeding 
entrainment from the gut to metabolically active tissues such as the liver, muscle, and 
adipose tissue is not entirely understood.
Gut Signaling and Feeding Entrainment
The impact of TRF on obesity has important implications in our understanding of 
metabolism and circadian rhythms, adding a further level of complexity. The timing of food 
intake has as much of an impact, if not more, on energy homeostasis as the nutritional 
content of the diet and gut signaling. Recent advances in our understanding of the effect of 
bariatric surgery on gut hormones such as incretins, or the impact of obesity on the 
composition and function of the gut microbiome, has led to tremendous interest in the role 
of gut signaling in metabolism. Orexigenic or anorexigenic peptides from the gut have the 
ability to affect energy utilization in other organs in a significant manner. Our understanding 
of how peripheral circadian genes are entrained by appetite hormones is currently limited, 
and future investigations in this area could lead to novel therapies for obesity and its 
associated metabolic disorders [70].
The Gut–Brain Axis
The SCN itself can likely influence appetite and feeding behavior through direct connections 
with hypothalamic nuclei that control appetite [71]. However, if light entrains the circadian 
cycling of SCN neurons, what agent conveys the feeding cycles from the gut? The gut is a 
mediator between ingested food and all other organs. It has an elaborate mechanism in place 
that transmits crucial information about the size and composition of the meal through 
endocrine, inflammatory, and neuronal signals. It is a highly circadian organ [72]. 
Furthermore, the gastrointestinal (GI) track houses a reservoir of trillions of commensal 
bacteria that are involved in sophisticated, direct and indirect (by secondary metabolites) 
interactions with the host. Candidate entraining agents can include any substance that 
oscillates with feeding within the gut lumen, or in the gut tissue, and has an impact on host 
metabolism. Potential agents identified that fit this profile include luminal nutrients, 
incretins, bile acids (BA), and the gut microbiome. Some of these candidates will be 
discussed in further detail.
Luminal Nutrients and Their Sensors
Luminal nutrients, such as particular fatty acids and starches, can elicit a complex signaling 
cascade in the gut–brain axis that provides feedback to satiety centers in the brain by 
suppressing feeding and appetite, and by altering the endogenous production of specific 
nutrients in other organs [73]. This signaling is either conveyed by the nutrients alone or in 
conjunction with the release of GI peptides from enteroendocrine cells (EECs). EECs 
contain multiple nutrient-dependent receptors, many of which are GPCRs, that can trigger 
depolarization and fluctuation in intracellular calcium and, hence, the secretion of gut 
peptides such as incretins, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, gastrin, serotonin, neurotensin, or

 secretin. Many of these peptides can then activate afferent enteric neurons, as well as work 
in an endocrine fashion. Such receptors include GPR41/FFAR3 and GPR43/FFAR2, which 
can detect short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [74]. Upon activation by SCFAs derived from the 
gut during feeding, GPR43, in particular, is able to modulate adipocyte sensitivity to insulin 
and hence affect lipid homeostasis [75]. In addition, microbiota-produced SCFAs that 
activate GPR41 can affect host energy homeostasis by stimulating adipocytes into making 
leptin [76], and inducing glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion by intestinal EECs [74].
Novel Supplements
Recent studies now show that orally ingested substances can affect circadian clock function 
and energy homeostasis, and this has broadened our understanding of how luminal 
substances can affect host metabolism. Circadian proteins control the biosynthesis of NAD+ 
which feeds back to modulate the activity of core clock components through sirtuin 1 
(SIRT1) and regulates rhythmic mitochondrial respiration through SIRT3 [77–79]. Bmal1 
knockout mice have significantly decreased SIRT3 activity, which affects mitochondrial 
oxidative function [79]. However, supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide 
(NMN), a NAD+ precursor, restored the function of SIRT3 as well as its effects on 
mitochondrial function [79].
In addition, circadian clock and feeding/fasting patterns regulate oscillations in polyamines, 
which are essential polycations present in all living cells that regulate essential cellular 
processes including gene transcription and translation, and cell growth [80]. Polyamines also 
regulate the activity of core clock proteins by modulating the interaction of PER2 and CRY1 
[81]. Nevertheless, their biological levels decrease with age, leading to longer circadian 
periods [81]. Supplementation with dietary polyamine results in reversal of age-related 
changes to the circadian period [81]. These new studies not only suggest that circadian gene 
expression and, with it, host metabolism can be affected with ingestible supplements, but 
that other, undiscovered compounds in the diet can potentially have a tremendous influence 
in the rhythmicity of the circadian clock program.
GI-Derived Peptides
Incretins such as GLP-1 can also serve as the agent that entrains feeding behavior. GLP-1 is 
a gut hormone that boosts glucose-dependent insulin secretion and is released during 
feeding, specifically when food enters the small intestine. In mice, GLP-1 excretion is 
circadian, with larger amounts being released in the evening, and is highly entrained by 
feeding behavior [82]. GLP-1 affects satiety in the central nervous system [83] and can 
influence metabolic homeostasis by affecting hepatic gene expression. GLP-1 receptor 
activation in hepatocytes increases cAMP production as well as peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor α (PPARα) and acetyl-CoA oxidase expression, both of which are 
involved in fatty acid oxidation. In addition, there is decreased expression of stearoyl-coA 
desaturase 1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (ACC), and fatty acid synthase (FAS), collectively suggesting the GLP-1 
impairs lipogenesis and improves β-oxidation of fatty acids [84,85]. Hence, GLP-1 or other 
EEC-released hormones could serve as feeding entraining agents to both the central nervous 
system and metabolically active tissues.

 Bile Acids
BAs are secreted into the GI lumen to facilitate lipid digestion. They are the endogenous 
ligands for the orphan nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) [86]. BA activation of 
FXR is the main regulatory step in the control of cholesterol and BA metabolism. 
Furthermore, in mice, FXR activation in hepatocytes, or FXR-mediated release of fibroblast 
growth factor 15 (FGF15) from the terminal ileum, play a modulatory role in lipid and 
glucose homeostasis [87]. TGR5 (G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, GPBAR1), another 
BA receptor, also plays an important regulatory role in host metabolism [88]. For example, 
BA activation of TGR5 can lead to weight loss. This is mediated by increased activation of 
thyroid hormone receptor in brown adipose tissue and, hence, increased energy expenditure 
in the setting of unchanged caloric intake [89]. Finally, BAs can affect host metabolism 
indirectly by inducing GLP-1 secretion through TGR5 activation [90]. Importantly, both 
serum BA levels and the FXR pathway, including its gene targets, exhibit circadian behavior 
and are induced by feeding [91].
The Gut Microbiota and Circadian Rhythms
The most recent addition to the list of potential feeding entrainment agents is the gut micro-
biome. Recent studies show that the gut microbiome is far more dynamic than previously 
imagined. It is also now appreciated that the gut microbiota is a major environmental 
contributor to obesity, although the full mechanisms by which it affects host metabolism are 
unknown [92]. In mice, the composition of the gut microbiome fluctuates cyclically. 
However, in DIO mice this cyclical fluctuation is dampened dramatically [63,93]. In 
addition to diet, the dynamic structure of the gut microbiome responds to a myriad of 
separate host controls, including gender, feeding time, clock gene mutation, diet, and jet-lag 
[63,93–95]. The gut microbiota is essential for normal circadian gene expression in the gut 
[94,96], and clock mutant mice also have a far less dynamic structure to their gut 
microbiome compared to control mice [93,95]. Behavioral disruption of the circadian clock, 
such as reversals of the light/dark cycle, leads to changes in the gut microbiome composition 
in mice [97]. TRF restores oscillating fluctuations in key bacterial families that are thought 
to affect host metabolism [63]. Dysfunctional gut microbiota can adversely affect host 
metabolism either via direct interactions with the host through activation of inflammatory 
pathways [98], by influencing the activation of GLP-1 [99], changing the luminal BA profile 
[63,100,101], or by affecting gut corticosteroid release [96].
We now begin to understand that the idea of a single agent that entrains feeding rhythms is 
false. Instead, it is entirely possible that a cascade of events is necessary for feeding 
entrainment. For example, dynamic fluctuation of the gut microbiome could induce 
fluctuations in the levels of SCFAs. This in turn could cause cyclical fluctuation of GPR43 
activation, which would then suppress insulin signaling in adipocytes, promoting the 
utilization of lipids in other ways, hence controlling metabolic homeostasis [75]. In addition, 
the dynamic fluctuations in the gut micro-biome can lead to cyclical fluctuation of primary 
and secondary BAs which can modulate FXR and TGR5 activation and downstream 
signaling, affecting energy expenditure and influencing cholesterol, lipid, and glucose 
homeostasis. One can imagine that when the normal feeding rhythms are perturbed with 
DIO [63] this leads to a cascade of disrupted cyclical fluctuations of the gut microbiome

 that, in turn, alter the luminal SCFA profile [102] or BA profile, leading to constant 
suppression of GPR43 signaling and a continuous increase in insulin-mediated lipid uptake 
in adipocytes [75]. Few studies have investigated how each single agent discussed can affect 
circadian biology. It will be exciting to determine, by investigating each of these complex 
and intertwined pathways, the mechanism by which meal timing can promote optimal 
metabolic health
Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives
Recent advances in circadian biology have had a tremendous impact on our understanding of 
the temporal regulation of metabolism. Metabolism is a highly dynamic process, controlled 
by three oscillating systemic networks: light-entrained central circadian neural oscillations, 
sleep/ wake homeostasis, and feeding/fasting rhythms. These networks affect cellular 
processes through circadian proteins, which are exquisitely coordinated with key cellular 
metabolic regulators. The synchrony of these oscillating networks with endocrine and 
enteroendocrine hormones, and neuronal input at the system level, and with the cellular 
machinery at the single-cell level, likely synchronizes distant organs and discordant cellular 
processes.
Dyssynchrony from altered genetics, disruption of normal cycling, or the introduction of 
obesogenic diets leads to dysmetabolism. Synchronizing feeding/fasting times with the light-
entrained circadian clock by TRF can, in some cases, prevent and treat obesity and 
dysmetabolism. The gut signals that impart the benefits of TRF are not yet well understood 
(see Outstanding Questions). However, deciphering how the gut can entrain the feeding/
fasting rhythms could lead to the development of much needed novel therapies for obesity 
and its associated metabolic diseases. The circadian rhythm of metabolism has highlighted 
the necessity for temporal separation of catabolic and anabolic metabolism to distinct times 
of the day. Such separation is now increasingly appreciated as a dominant component of 
metabolic homeostasis.
Outstanding Questions
How do circadian rhythms and feeding/fasting cycles ‘synergize’ to drive oscillations at a 
genomic level? Circadian clock or feeding/fasting cycles alone drive oscillations in a 
small set of transcripts, but the mechanism by which they exert their synergistic effect to 
regulate daily oscillations in a large number of transcripts or proteins is largely unknown.
What effect does the gut microbiome have on local and systemic rhythms in metabolism 
and physiology? Are there gut microbiome-derived metabolites that affect the circadian 
oscillators in distant organs or hunger/satiety circuits in the brain? These effects can 
affect daily rhythms of nutrient metabolism in the whole organism.
Why do particular foods, such as HFD, dampen the feeding/fasting rhythms?
How does dyssynchrony between the light/dark cycles and feeding/fasting rhythms result 
in dysmetabolism?

 Can obesity and dysmetabolism develop without dyssynchrony of the multiple oscillatory 
networks? Although dyssynchrony of oscillators predisposes to metabolic diseases, it is 
not known whether this is a hallmark feature of metabolic disease.
Does TRF protect against obesity and dysmetabolism in humans?
How do the circadian oscillations affect the homeostatic control of satiety to generate 
daily rhythms in feeding and fasting?
Could the relationship between obesity and specific cancers be linked to metabolic 
dysregulation caused by the dyssynchrony of circadian oscillatory networks?

Glossary
Ad libitum
literally meaning ‘at liberty’, where mice have access to food at all times. Mice with ad 
libitum access to normal chow have a diurnal feeding pattern, consuming nearly 75% of 
their daily calories during the dark/active period. Mice with ad libitum access to HFD spread 
their caloric intake more widely, consuming approximately 50% of their daily calories 
during the dark/ active period.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
a cellular metabolic regulator important for energy homeostasis. AMPK promotes ATP 
production and increases the catabolic drive of cells during periods of fasting.
Brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1)
also known as ARNTL (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1), is a 
transcription factor that acts as a positive element in the mammalian cell-autonomous 
circadian feedback loop. BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to activate Per and Cry 
transcription.
CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput)
a positive transcription factor in the mammalian cell autonomous circadian feedback loop. 
CLOCK dimerizes with BMAL1 to activate transcription of Per and Cry.
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)
a transcription factor that plays a key role in energy homeostasis. It increases the anabolic 
drive of cells during feeding.
Cryptochrome (CRY)
Zarrinpar et al.

 a transcription factor that acts as an inhibitory element in the mammalian cell-autonomous 
circadian feedback loop. CRY dimerizes with PER and inhibits the transcription of the 
Clock/ Bmal1 components.
Diet-induced obesity (DIO)
wild-type mice fed a HFD ad libitum constitute a model used to study dysmetabolism. The 
mice develop increased adiposity, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, 
among other metabolic problems.
Isocaloric diets
two diets that share the same amount of calories, but may differ in their nutrient composition 
or the timing of their intake.
Period (PER)
an inhibitory transcription factor in the mammalian cell-autonomous circadian feedback 
loop. PER dimerizes with CRY and inhibits the transcription of Clock/ Bmal1 components.
Retinoic acid related-related orphan receptor (ROR)
also known as NR1F (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group F), ROR is a member of the 
nuclear receptor family of transcription factors that serves as an activator of Bmal1.
REV-ERB
also known as NR1D1/2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, members 1/2), a member 
of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors that serves as an inhibitor of Bmal1. It 
also plays a major role in lipid homeostasis.
Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
a group of specialized neurons in the hypothalamus that receive light information from 
specialized cells in the retina and control circadian cycles. They can influence many 
physiological and behavioral rhythms that occur over a 24 h period and coordinate them 
with the change in light they detect.
v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT)
also known as protein kinase B (PKB), AKT is a serine/threonine kinase and central 
regulator of cellular metabolism, cell survival, and health. It plays a prominent role in 
glucose metabolism, promoting the catabolic drive of cells during fasting.

 Trends
Central circadian pacemakers, sleep/ wake homeostasis, and feeding/fasting rhythms 
coordinate distant metabolic processes for efficient metabolism through endocrine and 
neuronal signals.
Each cell has autonomous circadian clock components that interact with key metabolic 
regulators and effect cellular metabolic efficiency.
Obesity and dysmetabolism can be induced by perturbing these physiological or cellular 
cycles either via genetic manipulation, disruption of light/dark cycles, and by feeding 
patterns.
TRF promotes synchrony of feeding/ fasting rhythms with the central circadian 
pacemaker, resulting in more-robust circadian and metabolic cycles, and prevents and 
treats obesity and its metabolic consequences.
Entrainment of feeding/fasting rhythms is entrained by gut signaling which can by 
mediated by multiple potential candidates, including the gut microbiome, bile acids, 
incretins, nutrients, and secondary luminal metabolites.

 Figure 1. 
Central Circadian Control of Endocrine Signals. Specialized retinal ganglion cells in the 
retina detect ambient light and send this information to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 
through the retinohypothalamic tract. The SCN contains the central circadian clock. This 
area also receives information about light input indirectly thorough the thalamus. Sleep/
wake homeostasis constitutes another oscillatory network. This system has an ‘hourglass’ 
oscillation that is dependent on the amount of neural sleep factor S (together with other sleep 
factors) that build up over time. The central circadian clock and the sleep/wake homeostasis 
systems are tightly regulated through unknown mechanisms. Melatonin from the pineal 
gland is one compound that can help to synchronize these two systems. Neural and chemical 
signaling from the SCN to the hypothalamus induces circadian release of multiple releasing 
hormones [e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone 
(TRH), growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)]. These in turn cause the pituitary to 
release several hormones in a circadian manner [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), growth hormone (GH)]. The circadian release of these 
hormones has an effect on peripheral tissues, but they respond differently to nutrients or 
stressors depending on the time of the day. For examples, blood glucose oscillates with time, 
rising above average in the late evening, early night, peaking in the middle of the night, and 
then at a nadir in the morning. The central circadian clock in the SCN also can modulate 
circadian cycles in the peripheral organs, although the process is not well understood.

 Figure 2. 
Green arrows indicate findings published in the literature. Red arrows signify potential 
pathways. Mice on a diet-induced obesity (DIO) protocol have ad libitum access to a high-
fat diet (HFD). These mice have changes in the gut microbiome, stool metabolomics, and 
hepatic gene expression. There are presumed changes in gut signaling, particularly in the 
bile acid signaling pathway. As a result, these mice are particularly predisposed to obesity 
and dysmetabolism. With TRF, cyclical fluctuation is restored in the gut microflora, luminal 
metabolites, and hepatic gene expression. Presumably TRF also restores oscillations in gut 
signaling. As a result, TRF protects against obesity and dysmetabolism. Abbreviations: 
CYP7A1, cytochrome P450 7A1; FGF15, fibroblast growth factor 15; FXR, farnesoid X 
receptor; LIPC, hepatic lipase.
