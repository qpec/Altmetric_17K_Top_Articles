abstract
BACKGROUND: Most children with hearing loss who receive cochlear implants (CI) learn spoken 
language, and parents must choose early on whether to use sign language to accompany 
speech at home. We address whether parents’ use of sign language before and after CI 
positively influences auditory-only speech recognition, speech intelligibility, spoken 
language, and reading outcomes.
METHODS: Three groups of children with CIs from a nationwide database who differed in the 
duration of early sign language exposure provided in their homes were compared in their 
progress through elementary grades. The groups did not differ in demographic, auditory, or 
linguistic characteristics before implantation.
RESULTS: Children without early sign language exposure achieved better speech recognition 
skills over the first 3 years postimplant and exhibited a statistically significant advantage 
in spoken language and reading near the end of elementary grades over children exposed 
to sign language. Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-
appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more 
years. Early speech perception predicted speech intelligibility in middle elementary grades. 
Children without sign language exposure produced speech that was more intelligible (mean 
= 70%) than those exposed to sign language (mean = 51%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most compelling support yet available in CI literature 
for the benefits of spoken language input for promoting verbal development in children 
implanted by 3 years of age. Contrary to earlier published assertions, there was no 
advantage to parents’ use of sign language either before or after CI.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: Cochlear 
implant use, even from a young age, does not 
insure that spoken language will develop normally. 
Controversy exists regarding whether sign language 
in combination with spoken language provides 
greater benefit from a cochlear implant than spoken 
language alone.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: Outcomes were compared 
for early-implanted children from a prospective, 
national cohort differing in amount and duration 
of sign language use. Children exposed to sign 
language performed more poorly on auditory-only 
speech recognition, speech intelligibility, spoken 
language, and reading outcomes.

In a national sample of more than 
27 000 school-aged children who 
were deaf or hard of hearing, Mitchell 
and Karchmer1 reported only 3.9% 
had 2 parents who were deaf or 
hard of hearing. Most parents with 
normal hearing would like their child 
who is deaf to learn to communicate 
using spoken language and choose 
to provide a cochlear implant 
(CI) to facilitate this outcome. A 
major question for parents and the 
professionals who work with them is 
whether speech recognition, speech 
production, spoken language, and 
reading skills are best developed 
by focusing exclusively on spoken 
language or if early exposure to sign 
language provides an important 
foundation for learning a spoken 
language. Children of Deaf* parents 
are assumed to learn American Sign 
Language (ASL) at a normal rate 
through natural exposure to their 
parents’ language.2, 
 
3 However, most 
hearing parents and teachers are 
not ASL-proficient and typically 
learn an English-based sign language 
system that accompanies speech 
and maintains English word order 
and morphology, often referred 
to as “total” or “simultaneous” 
communication.4 Proponents of this 
approach maintain that signing while 
talking aids development of spoken 
language and reading skills.
For example, a recent review in 
Pediatrics 
2 noted “The benefits 
of learning sign language clearly 
outweigh the risks. For parents and 
families who are willing and able, this 
approach seems clearly preferable 
to an approach that focuses solely 
on oral communication.” Despite 
these assertions, there is a paucity 
of data directly comparing spoken 
language outcomes in similar groups 
of children learning language with 
and without the addition of sign. 
A systematic review of studies 
*“Deaf” is capitalized here because it is 
customary when referring to people who 
culturally identify as deaf and embrace the values 
of the Deaf Community.
conducted between 1995 and 2013 
concluded that “insufficient high-
quality evidence exists to determine 
if sign language in combination with 
oral language is more effective than 
oral language therapy alone” 
5. The 
question we address is whether 
parents’ use of sign language before 
and after cochlear implantation 
positively influences auditory-
only speech recognition, speech 
intelligibility, spoken language, and 
reading outcomes.
1. Does an early exclusive focus on 
spoken language promote faster 
development of auditory speech 
recognition skills, leading to more 
intelligible speech in elementary 
grades?
2. Does early exposure to sign 
language in addition to speech 
promote the development of 
spoken language and reading in 
elementary grades?
3. Is the quantity of sign language 
exposure over the first 3 years 
postimplant important for age-
appropriate spoken language and 
reading development?
MeThODs
Participants
Ninety-seven children were selected 
from the Childhood Development 
after Cochlear Implantation (CDaCI) 
study, 
6 a prospective multicenter, 
national cohort of 188 children 
recruited from 6 large CI centers 
between November 2002 and 
December 2004. Institutional Review 
Board approval of the protocol was 
obtained at each of the test sites (see 
Acknowledgments), and written 
informed consent was obtained from 
each participating family. The sample 
for this study was selected as follows: 
CI activated by 38 months of age (n = 
137/188), parents who consistently 
reported the communication mode 
used with their child (N = 129/137), 
and returned for testing near early 
and late elementary grades  
(n = 97/129). Over 95% of the 
children received specialized 
intervention during some or all of 
the first 3 years postimplant. The 
selected sample had statistically 
significantly younger age at implant 
activation (21.8 vs 37.3 months) and 
a higher percentage of families with 
white race (70% vs 55%) and with 
maternal education level at college 
graduate or higher (57% vs 42%) 
compared with those 91 families in 
the CDaCI database who were not 
included in these analyses.
sign exposure classification
Parents answered written questions 
about their child’s exposure to 
sign language at baseline (just 
before CI surgery) and at 12, 24, 
and 36 months postimplant. A 
child was classified as negative 
for sign language exposure at a 
given rating period if the parent 
reported no sign language use by 
the parent or intervention program 
(ie, auditory–oral, auditory–verbal, 
or cued speech methodologies). A 
child was classified as positive for 
sign language exposure at that rating 
period if one of the following systems 
was reported by a parent as used 
at least 10% of the time at home 
and/or in the child’s intervention 
program: ASL, Total/Simultaneous 
Communication, baby sign, Signing 
Exact English, Signed English, sign 
language, sign support, or Pidgin 
sign. Sign language exposure 
categorization was determined 
as follows: No sign = no report of 
parent or intervention program sign 
language use from baseline through 
the first 3 years postimplant (N = 
35); Short-term sign = positive for 
sign language use at baseline and/or 
12 months postimplant but negative 
for sign language use at 24 and 36 
months postimplant (N = 26); Long-
term sign = positive for sign language 
use at baseline and/or 12 months 
and at 24 and 36 months postimplant 
 
(N = 36). Similar rates of sign language 
use at baseline were reported for the

40 children who met the implant age 
criteria but were excluded due to lack 
of sufficient follow-up data.
Parents were also asked to estimate 
how much of each day sign language 
was used in the home, to separate 
frequent signers (>50% of the day) 
from infrequent signers (<50%). In 
families providing long-term sign 
language exposure, the proportion 
of frequent signers decreased from 
63% at baseline or 12 months 
postimplant to 29% at 24 or 36 
months postimplant.

10 or auditory

children who used sign language 
were statistically significantly more 
likely to be enrolled in parent–infant 
intervention preimplant than 
nonsigning families (P = .01).
Postimplant Outcome Measures
Auditory development was tracked 
over the first 3 years after CI 
activation. Speech intelligibility 
was measured near the middle of 
elementary school (age = 6.0–8.9 
years). Spoken language and reading 
outcomes were examined at a point 
near early (age = 5.0–7.9) and near 
late (age = 9.0–11.9) elementary 
grades. Tests were administered by 
certified audiologists and speech-
language pathologists at each CI 
Center without previous knowledge 
of group assignment for this study.
Early Auditory Development
The Speech Recognition Index in 
Quiet (SRI-Q) combines multiple 
results from a hierarchical test 
battery into a single cumulative 
speech perception index, accounting 
for both the difficulty level and 
accuracy on a specific test.12 SRI-Q 
values range from 0 to 600, with 
lower scores (0–100) representing 
parent report on the Meaningful 
Auditory Integration Scale.11, 
 
13  
Midrange scores (101–300) 
represent closed-set word 
recognition: Early Speech Perception 
Test14 and Pediatric Speech 
Intelligibility Test.15 Highest values 
(301–600) delineate open-set speech 
recognition: Lexical Neighborhood 
Test, 
16 Phonetically-Balanced Word 
Lists-Kindergarten, 
17 and Hearing in 
Noise Test for Children (administered 
in quiet).18
Speech Intelligibility
Audio recordings were made of each 
child imitating 36 sentences (3, 5, 
or 7 syllables long).19 Each sentence 
contained a key word that was either 
predicted by context (Read the book) 
or not (Get the cake). Normal hearing 
adults with no previous experience 
listening to the speech of individuals 
who are deaf were instructed to 
write down as much of the sentence 
as they understood. Three judges 
provided responses to each sentence, 
and no judge listened to more than 1 
sentence from the same child. Each 
overall intelligibility score represents 
the percent of 36 key words correctly 
understood across a total of 108 
judgments.
Spoken Language
The Core Composite standardized 
score (SS) on the Comprehensive 
Assessment of Spoken Language 
(CASL)20 was used to assess language 
in relation to hearing age-mates in 
the normative sample. All children

and paragraph comprehension at 
later grades. Results are expressed in

the normative sample.
statistical analyses
Pre- and postimplant characteristics 
and outcomes were compared 
across the 3 sign language exposure 
groups. Continuous variables were 
compared using analysis of variance 
F- or Kruskal-Wallis (when scores 
were not normally distributed or in 
interval scale) tests, and categorical 
variables were compared by using χ2 
or Fisher’s exact tests. Because the 
SRI-Q is an ordinal hierarchy created 
by scaling the different tests from 0 
to 100 and stacking them, Kruskal-
Wallis tests were used to compare 
the groups. Dunn’s test was used for 
posthoc comparison between groups. 
Spearman’s rank correlation ρ was 
used to correlate SRI-Q scores with 
speech intelligibility. Unadjusted 
logistic regressions were used to 
compare odds of language and 
reading outcomes below clinical 
thresholds (SS <85) for those 
exposed to short- or long-term 
sign to the no sign group. Stata 11 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) was 
used for all analyses, and all tests 
were 2-sided with α = .05.

spoken Language Promote Faster

Grades?
Median SRI-Q at baseline and over 
the first 3 years of CI use is reported 
in Table 2. A statistically significant 
difference between sign language 
exposure groups was identified at 
36 months postimplant. Posthoc 
pairwise comparisons revealed a 
statistically significant advantage of 
the no sign group over the long-term 
sign language exposure group (P = 
.004).
Speech intelligibility scores obtained 
at a mean age of 8.2 years (SD = 0.7) 
statistically significantly differed  
for the 3-sign exposure groups  
(P < .001). Dunn’s pairwise posthoc 
comparison revealed that children 
with long-term sign exposure 
produced statistically significantly 
less intelligible speech (mean = 
50.9%; SD = 23.5) than those with no 
sign exposure (mean = 70.4%; SD = 
16.5; P < .001) and those with short-
term sign exposure (mean = 63.0%; 
SD = 20.4; P = .01).
SRI-Q at baseline did not predict  
later speech intelligibility  
(ρ = 0.10). However, the rank 
correlation between post-CI speech 
recognition and later production 
was statistically significant at each 
of the 3 postimplant intervals and 
increased over time (ρ = 0.24, P = .02 
at 12 months; ρ = 0.32, P = .002 at 24 
months; and ρ = 0.42, P < .001 at 36 
months post-CI).

without sign language exposure was

of 100, whereas mean scores for the 
groups with sign language exposure 
remained delayed (83.8 and 76.4 for 
the short- and long-term exposure 
groups, respectively).
Reading
All 3 CI groups achieved 
comprehension scores on par 
with hearing children in the early 
elementary years, with no group 
differences reaching statistical 
significance. However, children 
without sign language exposure 
(mean SS = 94.9) exhibited a 
statistically significant reading 
advantage over the long-term sign 
language group (mean SS = 86.0) in 
later elementary grades (P = .02).
Is the Quantity of sign Language 
exposure Over the First 3 years 
Postimplant Important for  
age-appropriate Language and 
Reading Development?
Short-term Versus Long-term Exposure
The bottom row of Fig 1 reports 
the percentage of children in each 
group scoring more than 1 SD 
less than their normal hearing 
age-mates, and the lower section 
of Table 3 compares the odds of 
children in the sign language groups 
exhibiting delays in spoken language 
or reading relative to the no sign 
group. Between early and late 
elementary grades, the percentage 
of children with delayed language 
decreased from 49% to 29% in the 
no sign language exposure group, 
remained constant at 58% in the 
short-term group, and decreased 
from 75% to 61% in the long-term 
group. The percentage of children 
with less-than-average reading 
scores increased from <20% in early 
elementary grades to over 50% 
in late elementary grades in the 
groups exposed to sign language. 
For children without sign language 
exposure, only 11% were delayed in 
early elementary grades, increasing 
to 23% in late elementary grades. By 
late elementary school, participants 
exposed to sign language, regardless 
of short- or long-term exposure,

of having less-than-average (SS

comprehension scores compared 
with participants not exposed to sign 
language.
Frequent Versus Infrequent Sign 
Language Exposure
No statistically significant differences 
were observed based on quantity 
of sign language exposure when 
collapsed across sign language 
exposure groups. Spoken language 
scores did not statistically 
significantly differ between children 
from families reporting use of sign 
language 10% to 50% of the day (N = 
28; SS = 75 early CASL; 78 later CASL) 
and those whose family reported 
≥50% sign language use (N = 33; 
SS = 76 early CASL; 82 later CASL). 
Similarly, there was no statistically 
significant reading comprehension 
advantage in children whose parents 
used sign language infrequently  
(SS = 99 early WJ; 85 later WJ) 
compared with those with frequent 
sign language exposure (SS = 100

were compared in their post-CI 
progress through elementary grades. 
Data were analyzed to address 3 
questions. Below, we summarize and 
interpret these results.
Does an early exclusive Focus on 
spoken Language Promote Faster 
Development of auditory speech 
Perception skills, Leading to More 
Intelligible speech in elementary 
school?
Children whose families used spoken 
language exclusively developed  
better auditory speech recognition  
skills after 3 years of CI use and had  
more intelligible speech than children  
whose families used sign language.  
A strong relationship that increased 
over time was documented between 
early speech recognition and later 
speech intelligibility. Previous studies 
have documented a relation between 
the perception and production of 
speech sounds in children with  
CIs, 
22 
– 
24 and more intelligible speech 
has been associated with oral-only 
instruction.23, 
25 The current findings 
further suggest that parental sign 
language use from an early age, if 
continued after receipt of a CI, is 
associated not only with slower 
development of speech recognition, but 
also with substantially less intelligible 
speech in elementary grades (50% 
in children of long-term signers 
compared with 70% for children 
of nonsigning parents). Although 
short-term use of sign language did 
not enhance development, it did not 
appear to have deleterious effects on 
either speech perception growth or 
later speech intelligibility.
It is likely that parents in the long-
term group continued to use sign 
language because their child was 
slow to develop speech perception 
abilities, and families in the short-
term group stopped using sign 
language because their child’s 
auditory gains made the use of sign 
language unnecessary. Nonsigning 
families did not report switching to 
sign language use later, presumably 
because their child’s listening and 
spoken language skills continued 
to develop. Although the groups 
appeared well-matched initially with 
similar auditory and vocabulary 
skills preimplant and no speech 
perception differences for the first 2 
years postimplant, it is possible that 
use of sign language interfered with 
auditory and speech development.
Does early exposure to sign Language 
in addition to speech Promote the 
Development of spoken Language and 
Reading in elementary Grades?
Spoken language development is 
negatively affected by delaying access 
to linguistic input until auditory 
input is initiated through hearing 
aids and/or CIs. Proponents of early 
sign language use assert that children 
with Deaf parents who are exposed 
to ASL from birth have a firmer 
foundation for the development 
of spoken language once the CI is 
activated, although empirical data 
supporting this conclusion are 
limited.26 Most hearing parents do 
not know sign language when their 
child is diagnosed with hearing loss, 
and acquiring proficiency is a long 
and arduous process for them. In 
this study, early exposure to sign 
language did not enhance either 
spoken language or reading. In fact, 
children whose parents signed were 
statistically significantly more likely 
than children of nonsigning parents 
to exhibit spoken language delays in 
elementary grades and to fall behind 
age-mates in reading comprehension 
by late elementary grades. Long-term 
parental signing was associated with 
greater delay throughout elementary 
grades, and children from families 
who discontinued signing after a 
year of CI use still were 3.5 to 4 times 
more likely than nonsigners to score 
more than 1 SD less than age-mates 
in the normative sample in spoken 
language and reading near the end of 
elementary school.
These results are in line with 
previous findings from a nationwide 
sample of 181 children who received 
a CI between 1.6 and 5.3 years of 
age and were tested when they 
were 8 to 9 years old.27 Each child’s 
communication mode was ranked 
to reflect educational emphasis 
on spoken versus sign language 
input beginning preimplant and 
continuing into elementary grades. 
Children enrolled in an educational 
environment that emphasized 
spoken language and minimized 
accompanying signs exhibited a 
statistically significant language 
advantage over children enrolled 
in sign language programs.28 As 
in the current study, the effect of 
communication mode on reading 
comprehension was not statistically

significant in early elementary 
grades.29 However, 8 years later, 
when 112 of the original 181 
participants returned for assessment 
(ages 15.0–18.5 years), 
30 those 
students who continued to rely on 
sign language in their teenage years 
had statistically significantly worse 
overall English language outcomes31 
as well as overall literacy levels.32
The relatively high proportion of 
children in the no sign language 
exposure group achieving scores 
within 1 SD of normal hearing age-
mates replicated results observed 
previously for a nationwide sample 
of 60 children who had no early sign 
language exposure, received a CI 
within the same age range (ie, by 38 
months), and were approximately the 
same age at assessment near early 
and late elementary grades.33 The 
percentage of children exhibiting a 
language delay that persisted through 
elementary grades was strikingly 
similar in these 2 studies (29% and 
32%), indicating generalizability of 
this result.
Parents in the long-term exposure 
group may have continued signing 
with their children because of 
their children’s lack of spoken 
language progress, and sign 
language skills (not measured 
here) may have excelled. Measuring 
only spoken language outcomes 
may have underestimated total 
language abilities in spoken 
and signed language together. 
However, increasing lags in reading 
comprehension scores of children 
exposed to sign language suggest that 
their overall language skill was not 
sufficient to compensate for verbal 
achievement deficits.
Is the Quantity of sign Language 
exposure Over the First 3 years 
Post-Implant Important for age-
appropriate spoken Language and 
Reading Development?
To examine this question, we first 
compared outcomes of children 
with short-term and long-term 
exposure to sign language with those 
from nonsigning families. Children 
with long-term sign language 
exposure were at a significant 
disadvantage compared with those 
from nonsigning families across 
all outcomes, whereas short-term 
exposure was associated with 
spoken language and reading 
delays that emerged only in late 
elementary grades. This result 
suggests a sensitive period may 
exist for early sensory experience 
and a focus on early auditory input 
capitalizing on phonologically 
relevant articulatory events plays 
an important and persisting role in 
verbal development.34
Second, we compared children in 
families with frequent parental sign 
language use with those of infrequent 
signers. Children whose parents 
reported using sign language more 
frequently did not achieve better 
outcomes than those of less frequent 
signers. It is possible that the sign 
exposure provided by these hearing 
parents was not sufficient to promote 
spoken language development. 
The diminished performance of 
children of hearing parents learning 
sign may not adequately represent 
the potential benefits of early sign 
language input from accomplished 
signers.26 On the other hand, 
when this issue was addressed in 
“Language Choices for Deaf Infants: 
Advice for Parents Regarding 
Sign Languages, 
” 
35 parents were 
encouraged to sign regardless of their 
skill level:
[P]arents do not have to be perfect 
language models or even very good 
language models…even if not fluent, the 
parents’ language use is still important to 
the language development of the child… 
When a hearing mother signs with her 
deaf child, the child shows early language 
expressiveness on a par with hearing peers 
regardless of her signing abilities (p2).
Results of the current investigation 
indicate that hearing parents’ 
attempts to expose their child to 
sign language more frequently or for 
longer periods of time did not benefit, 
and may have detracted from, 
development of auditory, speech, 
and spoken language skills. However, 
the proportion of parents using sign 
language more than half of the day 
decreased from 63% at baseline or 
12 months post implant to 29% at 
24 or 36 months postimplant. We do 
not know whether more intensive 
use of sign language would have had 
different outcomes.

These results shed new light on a 
number of assertions regarding the 
benefits of early sign exposure cited 
in a review by Napoli et al.2 (1) “[E]
arly sign language, when used for a 
short time preimplant as a bridge to 
spoken language, cannot hurt and 
may be beneficial.” Current results 
indicate no lasting advantage to using 
sign before and immediately after 
a CI, and these children were more 
likely to experience delayed language 
and reading in late elementary grades 
than children with no sign exposure. 
(2) “With sign language, the deaf child 
is able to travel through various social 
situations and communities without 
difficulty and not be confined to 
communicating only with family and 
friends, as is often the case for deaf 
children who have no knowledge of 
sign language.” Children not exposed 
to sign language developed speech 
that was, on average, 70% intelligible 
to hearing listeners, suggesting they 
can use speech to communicate 
effectively in the wider hearing world. 
Children whose families signed for 
the first 3 years after CI averaged 
considerably less intelligible speech 
(50%), which likely affects the ease 
of spoken communication. (3) “[S]
igning deaf children, with or without 
a CI, perform better on literacy skills.” 
Children without sign language 
scored significantly better in reading 
in late elementary grades compared 
with children whose families 
provided early exposure to sign 
language.

GEERS et al
Some caveats apply when 
interpreting these results. First, 
children in the current study were all 
from families with normal hearing 
who were not native signers, and at 
least some children with Deaf parents 
who used ASL have reportedly 
achieved age-appropriate spoken 
language, 
26 as did some children 
with sign exposure in the current 
investigation. Second, although there 
were no differences among the 3 
groups of parents and children on a 
number of key predictors measured 
before cochlear implantation, 
differences may have existed that 
were not measured here. Third, more 
than half of mothers in this study 
had college degrees, and results may 
not apply equally to less advantaged 
populations. Nevertheless, based on 
results from this nationwide sample 
of children who differed in amount of 
early sign language exposure, if the 
long-term development of spoken 
English communication and literacy 
is the primary objective for a child 
with a CI, focus on early spoken input 
increases the probability of achieving 
those goals.
