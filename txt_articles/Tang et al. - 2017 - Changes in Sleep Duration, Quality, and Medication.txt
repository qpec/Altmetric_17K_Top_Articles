Introduction: Sleep is a plausible target for public health promotion. We examined the association of changes in sleep with subsequent health and well-being 
in the general population.
Aims and Methods: We analyzed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, involving 30 594 people (aged > 16) who provided data on sleep and 
health and well-being at both Wave 1 (2009–2011) and Wave 4 (2012–2014) assessments. Predicting variables were changes in sleep quantity, sleep quality, 
and sleep medication use over the 4-year period. Outcome variables were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 12-Item Short-Form Health 
Survey (SF-12) mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scores at Wave 4. Linear regression on each outcome was fully adjusted for potential confounders 
and baseline values of the relevant predicting and outcome variables.
Results: Better outcomes were associated with an increase in sleep duration (GHQ: β = 1.031 [95% confidence interval {CI}: −1.328, −0.734]; MCS: 1.531 
[1.006, 2.055]; PCS: −0.071 [−0.419, 0.56]), sleep quality (GHQ: β = −2.031 [95% CI: −2.218, −1.844]; MCS: 3.027 [2.692, 3.361]; PCS: 0.924 [0.604, 1.245]), 
and a reduction in sleep medication use (GHQ: β = −1.929 [95% CI: −2.400, −1.459]; MCS: 3.106 [2.279, 3.933]; PCS: 2.633 [1.860, 3.406]). Poorer outcomes 
were on the other hand associated with a reduction in sleep duration, a decrease in sleep quality, and an increase in sleep medication use. Changes in sleep 
quality yielded the largest effects on the health and well-being outcomes.
Conclusions: Changes in sleep were temporally associated with subsequent health and well-being. Initiatives that aim to protect a critical amount of sleep, 
promote sleep quality, and reduce sleep medication use may have public health values.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is increasingly recognized as a vital part of public health.1–5 
Sleeplessness has now been linked to problems with daytime 
functioning and vehicle and occupational accidents.6–8 The 
increased awareness is also explained by the emerging connec-
tions of sleep with health and well-being, whereby excessively 
long or short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and chronic use 
of sleep medication have been identified as predictors of adverse 
outcomes. The most convincing evidence has come from longi-
tudinal studies, showing that people reporting these sleep issues 
are at greater risk for developing depression,9 obesity,10 type II 
diabetes,11 hypertension,12 and cardiovascular disease,13 directly 
and indirectly contributing to higher risks of mortality.14–16
These findings highlight sleep as a profitable treatment tar-
get for a number of long-term conditions. However, in exam-
ining the public health benefits of early sleep interventions, 
we have limited evidence outside of the clinical context that 
sleep parameters are amenable to “positive change” over time 
and that “positive changes” in sleep duration, quality, and sleep 
medication use are associated with better health and well-being 
outcomes in the general population.
Only a handful of population-based longitudinal studies have 
investigated the prospective effect of sleep “changes” on health 
and well-being. Analyses of data from the Whitehall II study 
have indicated that a reduction of sleep duration to <6 hours per 
night, over a period of 5 years, is associated with lower scores 
on a range of memory and cognitive function tests including the 
Mini Mental State Examination, an instrument commonly used 
to assess progression of dementia.17 Such reduction in nightly 
sleep duration is also associated with higher levels of C-reactive 
protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) over the 5-year period.18 
Both CRP and IL-6 are biomarkers of inflammation with impli-
cations for the development of cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
and depression.19 Whereas, analyses of data from the Quebec 
Family Study have revealed that short sleepers increasing their 
nightly sleep duration from <6 to 7–8 hours were less likely to 
gain weight and adiposity over a period of 6 years, compared 
with those who maintain a short sleep duration.20,21 Although 
these findings suggest a role for sleep in cognitive function-
ing and weight control, the extent to which “changes” in sleep 
impact on our health and well-being has not been examined. 
Furthermore, little is understood about the effect of changes in 
other important sleep parameters such as sleep quality and sleep 
medication use. The only population-based study that looked at 
changes in these parameters found no effect for sleep quality 
change, but a significant increase in mortality risk among those 
Statement of Significance
Sleep is gaining traction as a health and well-being topic in recent years, with more and more evidence showing that poor sleep is a risk factor of a range 
of noncommunicable diseases and even increased mortality. Helping people to achieve a healthy sleep pattern may be a cost-effective way to promote 
well-being, but there is little empirical evidence that sleep improvements (in a nonclinical context) is followed by better health and well-being outcomes. This 
article examined the potential benefits of positive sleep changes on health and well-being in the general population from an epidemiological angle. Using 
data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we found that positive changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep medication use over a period 
of 4 years are temporally associated with better subsequent health and well-being. Initiatives that aim to protect a critical amount of sleep, promote sleep 
quality, and reduce sleep medication use may have public health values.

who switched status from nonusers or infrequent users to fre-
quent users of sleep medication.22
To address these gaps in knowledge, the current study exam-
ined changes in sleep in the general population and the effect 
of both positive and negative changes in sleep on health and 
well-being, using data from the UK Household Longitudinal 
Survey (UKLHS). We captured changes in sleep duration, sleep 
quality, and use of sleep medication over a period of 4 years, 
and we used changes in these parameters to predict outcomes 
reported at the end of the 4-year period. It was hypothesized 
that an increase in sleep duration and a reduction in sleep medi-
cation use would be associated with better outcomes, whereas a 
reduction in sleep duration and an increase in sleep medication 
use would be linked to poorer outcomes at 4 years. No predic-
tion was made for changes in sleep quality given the absence of 
prior evidence.
METHOD
Study Design
We analyzed Wave 1 (2009–2011) and Wave 4 (2012–2014) 
data drawn from the UKLHS,23 a major panel study that super-
sedes and incorporates the British Household Panel Survey 
(BHPS). The University of Essex granted ethical approval to 
the study. Detailed description of the design and conduct of the 
survey can be found elsewhere.24 A total of 18 waves of annual 
assessment are planned. Each wave of data collection spans 
over 2 years. At the time of writing, only the first five waves 
of data have been released, and of particular relevance to our 
analysis plan, Wave 4 repeated for the first time the same sleep 
questions administered in Wave 1. These data were retrieved 
and analyzed under the regular UK Data Service’s End User 
License. Figure 1 summarizes the participant constitution of the 
UKHLS at Wave 1 and Wave 4 and the response rate by house-
hold data collection structure.
Both Wave 1 and Wave 4 samples consisted of a general pop-
ulation sample (GP) and a booster sample of minority ethnic 
groups (EMB). However, Wave 4 also incorporated a sample of 
BHPS whose involvement in the UKHLS began at Wave 2. The 
GP sample was selected from postal addresses, using a propor-
tionally stratified, clustered, and equal probability approach. 
The EMB sample was recruited through oversampling of areas 
with a higher population density of five targeted ethnic minority 
groups; Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, and 
Black African.
The data collection method followed the structure of a house-
hold. Within each household, only one person completed the 
household enumeration grid and the household interview. Each 
member of the household aged over 16 had an individual inter-
view and a self-completed questionnaire.
At Wave 1,25 45 431 eligible households were identified for 
the GP sample and 10 253 for the EMB sample. Of these, inter-
views were achieved with 57% (26 057) of the GP and 40% 
(4060) of the EMB households. Within these interviewed 
households, individual interviews were completed with 82% of 
adults (aged 16 or over) in the GP sample and 73% in the EMB 
sample. Of these adult respondents, 87% (n = 41 046) of those in 
the GP sample and 70% (n = 6683) of those in the EMB sample 
also completed a paper self-completion questionnaire, which 
contained questions about sleep habits, health and well-being 
that were used in the current study.
At Wave 4,26 31 447 eligible households were identified. Of 
these, 21 497 were from the GP sample, 3110 the EMB sample, 
and 6840 the BHPS sample. The overall response rate was 62% 
at the household level. Within these interviewed households, 
92% of all eligible adults (n = 47 453) gave individual inter-
views and >80% of these interviewed individuals also returned 
a self-completion questionnaire (93% in the GP sample, 83% 
EMB sample, and 94% BHPS), which included the same ques-
tions about sleep habits, health and well-being asked in Wave 1.
Participants
For the current study, 30 594 people provided self-comple-
tion data at both Waves 1 and 4, allowing for longitudinal 
comparison.
Assessment of Predictors, Outcomes, and Potential 
Confounders
The key sleep parameters of interest were (1) sleep quantity, (2) 
sleep quality, and (3) use of sleep medication. In both waves of 
assessments, sleep quantity was calculated from the question 
that asked, “How many hours of actual sleep did you usually 
get at night during the last month?” (“hh:mm”). Sleep quality

BHPS sample was introduced at Wave 2, but these participants’ 
data were not included in the current analysis as their Wave 1 data 
were missing.

was measured using the question, “During the past month, how 
would you rate your sleep quality overall?” (“very good,” “fairly 
good,” “fairly bad,” or “very bad”). Use of sleep medication was 
checked with the question, “During the past month, how often 
have you taken medicine (prescribed or ‘over the counter’) to 
help you sleep?” (“not during the past month,” “less than once 
a week,” “once or twice a week,” or “three or more times a 
week”). These sleep questions were modified from select items 
of the well-validated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).27 
The wording, timeframe, and response scale of the questions 
were exactly the same. The PSQI has good internal consistency 
(α = 0.83) and test–retest reliability (r = 0.82; over an average 
of 19 days).28,29
Predicting variables were “changes” in these sleep parameters 
between Waves 1 and 4 assessments. For both sleep quantity and 
use of sleep medication, the three derived response categories 
were “increase,” “no change,” and “decrease”; for sleep quality, 
“better,” “no change,” or “worse.” The number of subjects and 
their response categories across assessment points for each of 
these sleep parameters are shown in Supplementary Tables 1–3.
Outcome variables were health and well-being, measured 
with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12; 
Likert scoring)30,31 and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-12)32 at Wave 4. The GHQ-12 is an established self-report 
measure for assessing psychological comorbidity in non-psy-
chiatric, community settings. The SF-12 is a well-validated 
scale for measuring health-related quality of life. It gives two 
component summary scores, mental component summary 
(MCS) and physical component summary (PCS), which were 
used as separate outcome variables in the current study.
Potential confounders taken into consideration were demo-
graphics variables assessed at Wave 1, including age, sex, eth-
nicity, education and employment status, and body mass index 
(BMI). In addition, baseline values of the relevant predicting 
sleep variables, GHQ-12, MCS, and PCS were entered to the 
model to adjust for differences in symptom presentation.
Analysis
We first analyzed how the Wave 4 measurement of GHQ-12, 
PCS, and MCS was associated with each of the key sleep-
change parameters. Each analysis was restricted to only the sub-
jects who provided data for the outcome variables at both Waves 
1 and 4, because cases with incomplete outcomes but complete 
predictors do not contribute to the regression of interest if the 
outcome is missing at random, or will cause modeling issues if 
the outcome is not missing at random.33,34 This led to a sample 
size of 22 396 for GHQ-12 and 25 431 for both PCS and MCS. 
We further restricted the analysis to those who had complete 
data on both Waves 1 and 4 measurements on the key sleep-
change parameters as well as the confounders of interest. We 
investigated the sensitivity of our results to these further restric-
tions by using multiple imputation by chained equations35–37 
(see Supplementary Appendix 1).
Our first analysis on each of the outcomes was a linear regres-
sion on the outcome measurement at Wave 4 on each of the 
key sleep-change parameters, while accounting for the baseline 
outcome measurement, the potential confounders, and base-
line measurement of the sleep parameters. In the estimation 
of the parameters, longitudinal weights computed by UKHLS 
were applied to the regression analysis. These weights apply 
to individual data from Waves 1 to 4 representing adult pop-
ulations who continued to live in the United Kingdom at both 
time points; they accounted for unequal selection probability, 
potential sampling biases, and participant nonresponse.38 We 
adjusted for confounders by means of multivariable adjust-
ment. We computed the local effect size of each sleep predictor 
using Cohen’s f2, which quantifies the proportion of variance 
explained by adding a sleep predictor to the model with con-
founders alone.38
All analyses were carried out in R (http://www.r-project.org).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Table 1 presents the baseline demographic characteristics of 
the participants by analysis. The sample characteristics were 
highly similar across analyses. Based on the complete case 
analysis, over half of the participants were female (56.037%), 
with a mean age of 47.166 years and a mean BMI of 26.268. 
The majority of the samples were white (87.957%), in full-
time employment (44.483%), and did not have a university first 
degree (49.358%).
At baseline, most of the participants reported an average 
sleep duration of 6–8 hours per night (77.0%). The remainder 
of the participants were split evenly into two camps, with 11.7% 
reported sleeping less than 6 hours and 11.3% more than 8 hours 
a night. While the majority considered their sleep quality to be 
fairly (53.8%) or very good (24.3%), a fifth of the participants 
regarded their sleep quality fairly (18.2%) or very bad (3.8%). 
Nearly 16% of the participants reported sleep medication use 
in the past month, with 8.8% taking sleep medications more 
than three times a week. Values of mean scores on the GHQ-12 
(10.9), MCS (51.1), and PCS (50.4) were within the normative 
range.30,32
Changes in sleep quantity, sleep quality, and use of sleep med-
ications were observed over the 4-year period, although stability 
in these parameters appeared to be the default (Supplementary 
Tables 1–3). Twice as many participants reported a decrease 
(18.9%) than an increase (9.4%) in sleep quantity. Change in 
sleep quality was split between both directions, with 24.5% 
noting better sleep quality and 21.2% noting worse sleep qual-
ity over time. The number of participants reporting a reduction 
in sleep medication use (13.4%) was nearly three times higher 
than those reporting an increase (5%).
Effect of Sleep Changes on Wave 4 GHQ-12
Table 2 presents the parameter estimates of all predictors 
included in the regression models. Adjusted for the Wave 1 
GHQ-12 score and all potential confounders, both an increase 
and a decrease in sleep quantity were found to be independ-
ent predictors of Wave 4 GHQ-12 score and yielded an effect 
size of f2 = 0.014. A decrease in sleep quantity was associated 
with a higher subsequent GHQ-12 score (β = 1.913, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] = [1.682, 2.144]), suggestive of more 
psychiatric symptoms, whereas an increase in sleep quantity 
was associated with a lower GHQ-12 score (β = −1.031, 95%

CI = [−1.328, −0.734]). Changes in sleep quality yielded an 
effect size of f2 = 0.090, and worse sleep quality was associ-
ated with a higher GHQ-12 score (β = 2.348, 95% CI = [2.157, 
2.538]) and better sleep quality was associated with a lower 
GHQ-12 score (β = −2.031, 95% CI = [−2.218, −1.844]). The 
same pattern of findings was also observed for changes in sleep 
medication use, which yielded an effect size of f2 = 0.019; an 
increase in sleep medication use was associated with a higher 
Wave 4 GHQ-12 score (β = 2.595, 95% CI = [2.240, 2.949]) 
and a decrease in sleep medication use a lower GHQ-12 score 
at Wave 4 (β = −1.929, 95% CI = [−2.400, −1.459]).
Effect of Sleep Changes on Wave 4 MCS
Table 3 summarizes the results of the same analyses carried out 
with Wave 4 MCS score as the outcome variable. Adjusted for 
the Wave 1 MCS score and all potential confounders, changes in 
sleep quantity were found to be independent predictors of Wave 
4 MCS score and yielded an effect size of f2 = 0.016. A decrease 
in sleep quantity was associated with a lower subsequent MCS 
score (β = −2.628, 95% CI = [−3.038, −2.217]), suggestive of 
poorer mental health, whereas an increase in sleep quantity was 
associated with a higher MCS score (β = 1.531, 95% CI = [1.006, 
2.055]). As for changes in sleep quality, which yielded an effect 
size of f2 = 0.081, there were associations between worse sleep 
quality and a lower MCS score (β = −3.514, 95% CI = [−3.855, 
−3.173]) and between better sleep quality and a higher MCS 
score (β = 3.027, 95% CI = [2.692, 3.361]). Changes in sleep 
medication use yielded an effect size of f2 = 0.024, and an 
increase in sleep medication use was associated with a lower 
MCS score (β = −4.567, 95% CI = [−5.193, −3.940]) and a 
decrease in sleep medication use a higher MCS score at Wave 4 
(β = 3.106, 95% CI = [2.279, 3.933]).
Effects of Sleep Changes on Wave 4 PCS
Table 4 presents the results of the same analyses with Wave 
4 PCS score as the outcome variables. Adjusted for Wave 1 
PCS score and all potential confounders, changes in sleep 
quantity yielded an effect size of f2 = 0.009, and a decrease

in sleep quantity was associated with a lower subsequent PCS 
score (β = −1.526, 95% CI = [−1.909, −1.143]), suggestive of 
poorer physical health, but no effect was found for an increase 
in sleep quantity (β = −0.071, 95% CI = [−0.419, 0.560]). 
Changes in sleep quality yielded an effect size of f2 = 0.023, 
and worse sleep quality was associated with a lower PCS score 
(β = −1.867, 95% CI = [−2.194, −1.539]) and better sleep qual-
ity a higher PCS score (β = 0.924, 95% CI = [0.604, 1.245]). 
Likewise, an increase in sleep medication use was associ-
ated with a lower PCS score (β = −3.024, 95% CI = [−3.610, 
−2.438]) and a decrease in sleep medication use a higher 
PCS score at Wave 4 (β = 2.633, 95% CI = [1.860, 3.406]), 
and changes in sleep medication use yielded an effect size of 
f2 = 0.015.
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed our analysis on each of the imputed data sets 
to investigate the sensitivity of our conclusions relative to the 
complete case analysis. The conclusions drawn from our analy-
ses did not differ using the imputed data sets.
DISCUSSION
Changes in all sleep parameters were associated with subse-
quent measures of health and well-being. There was a high 
level of consistency across the findings from different analyses 
by outcome, indicating that poorer outcomes were predicted 
by a reduction in sleep duration, a decrease in sleep quality, 
and an increase in sleep medication use. Better outcomes on 
the other hand were predicted by an increase in sleep duration, 
an improvement in quality, and a reduction in sleep medica-
tion use. Importantly, effects of these sleep parameters were 
independent of baseline health status and a number of known 
confounders.
Of all predictors, effects on health and well-being were larg-
est for changes in sleep quality (f2 = 0.021−0.086), followed by 
changes in sleep medication use (f2 = 0.014−0.021) and then 
changes in sleep quantity (f2 = 0.008−0.014) (see Figure 2). 
While negative changes in sleep generally had larger effects 
on health and well-being, positive changes in sleep were asso-
ciated with an up to 2-point reduction on the GHQ-12 and a 
3-point increase on the MCS and PCS. These levels of change

on the MCS and PCS translate to “some less” to “a lot less” 
physical and mental role limitations according to the SF-12 
scoring and interpretation manual.27 Changes on the GHQ are 
comparable with those seen in mental health professionals com-
pleting a 8-week program of mindfulness-based cognitive ther-
apy designed to improve psychological well-being (1.6-point 
reduction at 20-week follow-up).25 They are also comparable 
with the average improvement in well-being (1.4-point reduc-
tion) shown by UK BHPS lottery winners 2 years after a medi-
um-sized (£1000–£120 000 in 1998 money) lottery win.26
These findings were largely consistent with our hypothe-
ses, except for two unexpected observations. First, while an 
increase in sleep duration was associated with better MCS 
score, it was not associated with better PCS score at 4 years. 
This suggests that benefits of longer sleep do not necessarily 
emerge at the same speed or magnitude across different health 
domains. Benefits of longer sleep on physical health may take 
longer to emerge and may only be apparent in subgroups of 
short sleepers clocking <6 hours of sleep per night (n = 2867; 
12% of the current sample at baseline). Second, changes in 
sleep quality were associated with subsequent health and 
well-being. This contrasts with the comparisons derived from 
a previous Finnish study, in which no effect on mortality was 
found for changes in sleep quality but consistent effects were 
observed for both changes in sleep quantity and an increase in 
sleep medication use.22 Arguably, mortality is a much broader 
and more distant measure of health and well-being. Differences 
in findings may also be explained by differences in sample con-
stitution (Finnish vs. British) and length of follow-up (22 vs. 
4 years). That said, the current finding challenges the predomi-
nant focus on sleep quantity in some of the public health mes-
sages.28 Sleep may be better understood as a multidimensional 
experience, whereby quality of sleep is just as important as 
quantity.
The current study benefited from the methodological 
strengths of UKHLS, which included its large sample size, 
representativeness of the sample, repeated assessments of 
the same individuals over multiple points, derived weights 
to account for sample attrition, and the use of well-validated 
health outcome measures.24 However, the assessment of

sleep was relatively coarse, and each of the sleep parameter 
was measured with individual items derived from the PSQI. 
Objective measurement of sleep was not available; self-report 
data on sleep were arguably vulnerable to recall and report-
ing biases. We did not have information about the dose, fre-
quency, and duration of the sleep medication used. We also 
did not have information about the presence of any clinical 
sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) and thus were unable to 
control these potential confounds in our analysis. However, 
we understand that the UKHLS did collect self-reported 
information on chronic medical conditions that may be linked 
to sleep (e.g., diabetes, asthma, cancer, epilepsy, depression, 
coronary heart disease etc.). It is possible for future research 
to run subgroup analysis to fine-tune our understanding of the 
sleep and health and well-being link as moderated by preex-
isting medical conditions.
We specifically examined the effect of changes in sleep and 
its impact on overall health and well-being over time, as this 
approach allowed us to establish temporal precedence between 
sleep improvement/disruptions and subsequent outcomes. 
Although conclusions concerning the causality between sleep 
improvement and better health cannot be drawn, integration of 
extant evidence from observational, experimental, and clini-
cal studies suggests that the pathway from sleep changes to 
health can be both direct and indirect, through their effects on 
the circadian, homeostatic, metabolic, immune, pain, endo-
crine, cardiovascular, emotions, and memory systems and on 
the brain structures involved in the regulation of these overlap-
ping systems.13,19,39–46 Analyses reported in this study were not 
designed to uncover the possible triggers of changes in sleep. 
There are many possible triggers, including the natural process 
of aging and intentional and unintentional changes in health, 
diet, medication/substance use, lifestyle, exercise patterns, 
work conditions, and life circumstances (e.g., divorce, unem-
ployment). It would be a challenge for future research to pro-
vide a comprehensive list of these triggers and elucidate the 
neurophysiological mechanisms through which changes in 
these factors translate into sleep disruption or improvement. 
That said, the public health benefits of identifying what con-
stitutes an effective avenue for protecting and improving sleep 
at the population level would be considerable. An excellent 
example is found in the body of work examining the associa-
tion between sleep deprivation and medical errors, which has 
generated credible evidence suggesting that sleep deprivation 
as a result of long shift hours can increase daytime fatigue, 
clinical performance deficit, and medical errors among hospi-
tal residents.47–50 Recent intervention studies have shown that 
these undesirable consequences can be prevented or signifi-
cantly reduced with innovations in shift scheduling that aims 
to eliminate extended shift and reduce work hours51 and work 
policies that aim to safeguard a protected sleep period (of 5 
hours) during extended (up to 30 hours) overnight in-hospital 
duty hours.52
In raising the public’s awareness of sleep and health, 
although the emphasis on protecting a critical amount of sleep 
is important, the focus of the message should be broadened to 
include the importance of getting sleep of good quality and of 
reducing dependence on sleep medication. On the latter point, 
the current study found that at baseline 16% of the sample 
reported use of sleep medication in the past month, with 8.8% 
taking sleep medication three or more times a week. This level 
of prevalence is higher than that reported in France (10%; 
6.17% on a chronic and frequent basis)53 and the estimated 
level of prescribed hypnotic use in the United States (4%).54 
Of relevance, those who increased their use of sleep medica-
tion over time reported worse outcomes despite the intended 
purpose of the medication to improve sleep and overall health 
and well-being. These findings align with work by Kripke 
et al.55 and Sivertsen et al.,56 revealing a dose–response rela-
tionship of hypnotic prescriptions with hazards of cancer and 
even death.
Overall, the current study has provided fresh evidence in 
support of a temporal effect of sleep changes on health and 
well-being. This relationship applies to both negative and pos-
itive changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, and use of sleep 
medication. Sleep is therefore a logical and feasible target for 
preventative health intervention.
