Introduction
Unconventional natural gas development 
(UNGD), which includes the process of 
hydraulic fracturing, represents an expanding 
share of energy production worldwide. Shale 
gas extraction now comprises 40% of U.S. 
domestic natural gas production [Energy 
Information Administration (EIA 2015)]. In 
the past decade, particularly rapid increases in 
UNGD have occurred in Pennsylvania, where 
> 8,800 unconventional wells have been drilled.
There are concerns that UNGD could 
affect the environment via chemical pollut-
ants such as diesel exhaust, volatile organic 
compounds, combustion products, fugitive 
emissions, and fracking chemicals (Werner 
et al. 2015). UNGD has been linked to 
contamination of air (Macey et al. 2014; 
Paulik et al. 2015), soil (Maloney and 
Yoxtheimer 2012), ground water (Jackson 
et al. 2013; Drollette et al. 2015), and surface 
water (Kassotis et al. 2014). UNGD also 
creates contextual and psychosocial stressors 
including noise, truck traffic, influxes of 
nonlocal workers, and perceived negative 
impacts on quality of life and on the built and 
social environments (Saberi et al. 2014; Powers 
et al. 2015; Adgate et al. 2014).
There have been few studies of the health 
effects of UNGD, despite increasing concerns 
(Mitka 2012; Kovats et al. 2014). Previous 
studies have been limited by factors including 
small sample size and imprecise exposure 
assessment (Adgate et al. 2014). Because the 
expansion of UNGD has outpaced scientific 
understanding of its potential health impacts, 
studies of self-reported outcomes have been 
advocated as a rapid means of generating 
hypotheses that could influence public policy. 
Furthermore, some illnesses with plausible 
links to UNGD, such as pain syndromes 
and fatigue, are defined solely by symptoms. 
Yet, to date there have been only two epide-
miologic studies of symptoms in relation 
to UNGD, each with < 500 participants 
(Steinzor et al. 2013; Rabinowitz et al. 2015).
We used data from a large population-
based cross-sectional survey of Pennsylvania 
adults to identify patients with nasal and 
sinus symptoms, migraine headache, and 
higher levels of fatigue. We selected these 
outcomes because of their high prevalence, 
large economic costs, and possible links to 
environmental risk factors through chemical 
toxicity, irritation, odors, or stress (Hastan 
et al. 2011; Bhattacharyya 2009; Shashy et al. 
2004; Tan et al. 2013; Friedman and De ver 
Dye 2009; Sjöstrand et al. 2010; Bell et al. 
1998; Griffith and Zarrouf 2008; Ranjith 
2005; Ricci et al. 2007). The purpose of this 
study was to test the null hypothesis that 
UNGD is not associated with these three 
outcomes. To do so, we performed a case–
control analysis in which we compared indi-
viduals having one or more of these health 
outcomes with selected participants having 
no or minimal evidence of these diseases.
Methods
Study Overview
In early 2014, we performed a cross-
sectional survey of primary care patients 
of the Geisinger Clinic. Information was 
gathered via a questionnaire designed to 
study general chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)

Background: Unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) produces environmental 
contaminants and psychosocial stressors. Despite these concerns, few studies have evaluated the 
health effects of UNGD.
oBjectives: We investigated associations between UNGD activity and symptoms in a cross-
sectional study in Pennsylvania.
Methods: We mailed a self-administered questionnaire to 23,700 adult patients of the Geisinger 
Clinic. Using standardized and validated questionnaire items, we identified respondents with 
chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), migraine headache, and fatigue symptoms. We created a summary 
UNGD activity metric that incorporated well phase, location, total depth, daily gas production and 
inverse distance–squared to patient residences. We used logistic regression, weighted for sampling 
and response rates, to assess associations between quartiles of UNGD activity and outcomes, both 
alone and in combination.
results: The response rate was 33%. Of 7,785 study participants, 1,850 (24%) had current CRS 
symptoms, 1,765 (23%) had migraine headache, and 1,930 (25%) had higher levels of fatigue. 
Among individuals who met criteria for two or more outcomes, adjusted odds ratios for the highest 
quartile of UNGD activity compared with the lowest were [OR (95% CI)] 1.49 (0.78, 2.85) for 
CRS plus migraine, 1.88 (1.08, 3.25) for CRS plus fatigue, 1.95 (1.18, 3.21) for migraine plus 
fatigue, and 1.84 (1.08, 3.14) for all three outcomes together. Significant associations were also 
present in some models of single outcomes.
conclusions: This study provides evidence that UNGD is associated with nasal and sinus, 
migraine headache, and fatigue symptoms in a general population representative sample.

epidemiology (for the questionnaire, see 
Supplemental Material, “Population Study 
of Nasal and Sinus Symptoms”). The ques-
tionnaire did not mention UNGD because 
that was not its primary purpose. We used 
residential addresses and information about 
Pennsylvania unconventional gas wells to 
create UNGD activity metrics for four 
time-varying well development phases. We 
evaluated the associations between UNGD 
activity and CRS, migraine headache, and 
fatigue symptoms. The study protocol was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) of the Geisinger Health System with an 
IRB Authorization Agreement with the Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
Waivers of Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
authorization and written informed consent 
were approved by the IRB; implied consent 
was considered to have been provided if the 
patient returned the mailed questionnaire.
Study Population
The Geisinger Clinic provides primary care 
services to > 400,000 patients, predominantly 
in central and northeastern Pennsylvania. 
Our source population consisted of 200,769 
adult (age ≥ 18 years) Geisinger primary care 
patients for whom we had electronic health 
record (EHR) data and information on race/
ethnicity. From this source population, we 
selected 23,700 survey recipients using a 
stratified sampling design that is described in 
“Rationale and Description of the Stratified 
Sampling Method.” We mailed the baseline 
questionnaire in April 2014. A total of 7,847 
(33.1%) individuals returned the question-
naire after three mailings. Questionnaires were 
returned between 13 April and 13 October 
2014. After excluding respondents who lived 
outside Pennsylvania (n = 62), the study 
sample consisted of 7,785 participants.
Rationale and Description of the 
Stratified Sampling Method
We oversampled racial/ethnic minorities 
because a primary interest of the parent grant 
was to understand racial/ethnic differences 
in CRS epidemiology. Geisinger’s catchment 
area only has ~8% racial/ethnic minorities. 
Oversampling was necessary to ensure a suffi-
cient number of racial/ethnic minorities in the 
parent study.
Similarly, to ensure an adequate number 
of CRS patients in the parent CRS study, we 
oversampled individuals with higher likeli-
hood of having CRS. To do so, we used 
EHR data to identify Geisinger primary 
care patients with higher, intermediate, and 
lower likelihood of CRS. These assessments 
were based on International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and 
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 
codes from the medical record. Patients with 
a “higher” likelihood of CRS (n = 13,494) 
had at least two ICD-9 codes for CRS (ICD-9 
codes 473.x or 471.x) associated with an 
outpatient, inpatient, or emergency depart-
ment encounter, or they had at least one CPT 
code for sinus computerized tomography, 
sinus endoscopy, or sinus surgery. Patients 
with “intermediate” likelihood of CRS 
(n = 49,918) had at least one ICD-9 code for 
asthma (493.x) or allergic rhinitis (477.x) or 
a single ICD-9 code for CRS associated with 
an outpatient, inpatient, or emergency depart-
ment encounter. The 137,357 patients who 
did not meet criteria for the higher and inter-
mediate likelihood groups were designated as 
having a “lower” likelihood of CRS.
We divided our source population into six 
strata based on race/ethnicity and likelihood 
of CRS. We mailed the baseline CRS survey 
to a larger percentage of individuals in the 
strata of interest (see Table S1).
Covariates
We obtained the following covariates from 
the EHR: sex, current age (years), race/
ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, other), 
smoking status (never, current, former), 
body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), residential 
address, and history of receiving Medical 
Assistance, a means-tested health insurance 
program that we used as a surrogate for family 
socioeconomic status (Casey et al. 2013). We 
used information in the EHR to derive each 
individual’s residential place type (township, 
borough, or census tract in cities) and 
Charlson comorbidity index. We computed 
the Charlson index, which incorporates the 
number and severity of comorbid illnesses, 
in a manner consistent with previously 
published criteria (Charlson et al. 1987). We 
dichotomized race/ethnicity because only 
10% of participants were nonwhite, which is 
reflective of the general population in these 
communities (Casey et al. 2016). Our ques-
tionnaire ascertained additional information 
on educational status, marital status, house-
hold income, hay fever, nasal polyps, age at 
onset of nasal/sinus symptoms (in 5-year cate-
gories), history of sinus surgery, and current 
use of sinusitis medications (antibiotics and 
oral, inhaled, and nasal corticosteroids). We 
used U.S. Census data (Liu et al. 2012) to 
derive community socioeconomic deprivation 
(CSD) in townships, boroughs, and cities 
using a modified version of the Townsend 
index (Townsend 1987) as  
previously 
reported (Liu et al. 2012).
Outcome Ascertainment
The cardinal symptoms of CRS are nasal 
congestion/obstruction, nasal discharge 
(anterior or posterior nasal drip), smell loss, 
and facial pain or pressure. Our questionnaire 
ascertained the frequency (“never,” “once 
in a while,” “some of the time,” “most 
of the time,” or “all the time”), in the past 
3 months, of the aforementioned symptoms 
(questions 10–15 of the questionnaire, 
which is included in the Supplemental 
Material, “Population Study of Nasal and 
Sinus Symptoms”). Following European 
Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal 
Polyps (EPOS) diagnostic criteria for CRS 
in epidemiologic studies (Fokkens et al. 
2012), we determined participants to have 
current CRS if they experienced two or more 
cardinal symptoms [one of which must be 
nasal congestion/obstruction (question 10) 
or discharge (question 11 and/or 12)] at least 
“most of the time” in the past 3 months.
We ascertained migraine headache via 
questions from the ID Migraine™ question-
naire (Lipton et al. 2003) covering the past 
12 months. Those with headaches at least 
“some of the time” (question 80) were asked 
the frequency (“never,” “rarely,” “less than 
half the time,” “half the time or more”) of 
headache-associated disability, nausea, and 
photophobia (questions 81–83). Using a vali-
dated scoring method (Lipton et al. 2003), we 
dichotomized the three responses. Responses 
of “never” or “rarely” were scored as no and 
responses of “less than half the time” or 
“half the time or more” were scored as yes. 
Participants who answered yes to at least 
two of three questions were considered to 
have migraines.
We ascertained fatigue with eight ques-
tions from the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS®) fatigue short form 8a (http://
www.assessmentcenter.net). These items 
assessed the frequency (“not at all,” “a little 
bit,” “somewhat,” “quite a bit,” “very much”) 
of fatigue and fatigue-related disability in the 
past week (questions 84–91). We used the 
instrument’s standardized scoring instruc-
tions to code responses from 1 (“not at all”) 
to 5 (“very much”) and summed the eight 
values to produce a score ranging from 8 to 
40. We excluded individuals who answered 
fewer than four questions (n = 76). Individuals 
who answered between 4 and 7 questions 
were assigned a prorated score using the 
following formula: score = (raw sum × 8)/
(number of items answered). Fractional scores 
were rounded up to the nearest integer. Our 
“higher levels of fatigue” outcome consisted of 
individuals in the highest quartile (score ≥ 28).
Some respondents met criteria for more 
than one outcome. In the analysis, we 
evaluated associations of UNGD with single 
outcomes (i.e., CRS only, migraine only, or 
fatigue only) and with multiple outcomes 
(i.e., participants with CRS and migraine, 
CRS and fatigue, migraine and fatigue, or all 
three outcomes).
 Fracking and sinusitis, migraine, and fatigue

Reference Group
We performed an unmatched case–control 
analysis in which we compared individuals 
having one or more of the three primary 
outcomes (“cases”) with a subset of partici-
pants having no or minimal evidence of these 
outcomes (hereafter referred to as “controls” 
or the “reference group”). The reference group 
comprised study participants who a) did not 
meet diagnostic criteria for past or current 
CRS, b) reported no migraine headache 
symptoms, and c) reported lower levels of 
fatigue (i.e., first quartile of fatigue score). 
Individuals with past CRS, inter 
mediate like-
lihood of migraine, and/or moderate levels 
of fatigue were excluded from the reference 
group. These exclusion criteria were intended 
to produce a reference group free of indi-
viduals with a moderate likelihood of having 
the outcome (in the case of migraine and 
fatigue) or whose disease had been aggressively 
managed and treated (in the case of past CRS).
We created the reference group as follows. 
First, we excluded all study participants with 
one or more of the outcomes of interest. 
Next, individuals who met criteria for lifetime 
CRS [i.e., responses of “yes” to at least two 
cardinal symptoms on questions 1–6, one of 
which had to be nasal blockage (question 1) 
or discharge (question 2 and/or 3)] but not 
current CRS were deemed to have “past 
CRS” and were excluded from the reference 
group. We then excluded participants from 
the reference group if they endorsed any of 
the three ID Migraine™ criteria. In other 
words, members of the reference group either 
skipped the ID Migraine™ questions (e.g., 
because they reported a headache frequency 
of “never” or “once in a while” on question 80 
and were instructed to skip the following three 
questions) or responded to questions 81–83 
with no migraine symptom occurring more 
frequently than “never” or “rarely.” Finally, we 
excluded individuals from the reference group 
if their fatigue score was higher than the 25th 
percentile (i.e., those with fatigue score > 13) 
or if they did not answer at least four of eight 
PROMIS® fatigue items (questions 84–91). 
No other inclusion or exclusion criteria were 
applied to the reference group.
UNGD Activity Assessment
We used published descriptions, and our own 
data, to estimate the duration of each UNGD 
phase (Gaines and Ziegler 2013; New 
York State Department of Environmental 
Conservation 2015; Casey et al. 2016). Pad 
preparation, which involves clearing of the 
well site, lasts ~30 days. Drilling the well then 
takes 1–30 days, proportionate to the total 
(vertical plus horizontal) depth. After drilling, 
hydraulic fracturing (fracking) occurs during 
a stimulation phase that lasts an average of 
7 days. Finally, the well produces natural 
gas during a production phase that lasts 
months to years.
To capture these complexities of well 
development, we compiled data on UNGD 
in Pennsylvania from 1 January 2005 through 
31 December 2014 from the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection, the 
Pennsylvania Department of Conservation 
and Natural Resources, and SkyTruth (http://
skytruth.org). We obtained the following 
information for each well: geographic coor-
dinates; start dates of drilling, stimulation, 
and production; total depth; and volume of 
natural gas produced during 6- or 12-month 
reporting windows.
Using methods described previously 
(Casey et al. 2016), we created UNGD activity 
metrics for each phase of well development. 
Briefly, these metrics incorporated all uncon-
ventional gas wells in Pennsylvania and were 
defined as follows:
 
1
T

Metric for participant
1
i
T
w
t

j

,
where T is an averaging period in days 
(in our primary analysis, T = 90 because 
CRS diagnostic criteria require 3 months of 
symptoms); t is a temporal summation index 
whose negative sign represents past dates (e.g., 
summing from t = –1 to –90 indicates that 
the metric was averaged over 90 consecutive 
days immediately before the survey); n is the 
number of wells; wj(t) is the weight assigned 
to the jth well on day t; and d 2
ij is the squared 
distance between well j and the residential 
address of participant i. We set wj(t) = 0 for 
wells that were inactive in the given phase 
on day t. Active wells were assigned weights 
during the duration of the relevant phase 
as follows: for pad preparation and drilling 
metrics, wj(t) was 1; for the stimulation metric, 
wj(t) was the total depth in feet (a surrogate 
for hydraulic fracturing chemical volumes 
and the number of truck trips required to 
transport stimulation materials); and for the 
production metric, wj(t) was the average daily 
volume in Mcf (1 Mcf = 1,000 cubic feet) of 
natural gas produced during the corresponding 
reporting period.
Because the four UNGD phase metrics 
were highly correlated when averaged over 
90 days (Spearman coefficient > 0.90 for each 
pairwise comparison), we z-transformed the 
metrics and summed the resulting z-scores. 
For analysis, we divided this continuous 
composite UNGD activity metric into quar-
tiles for ease of interpretation and because of 
its skewed distribution.
Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to compare 
characteristics of participants with and 
without each outcome. To evaluate selection 
bias with respect to UNGD, we compared 
distributions of the UNGD activity metric in 
study participants and questionnaire nonre-
sponders. To assess the potential for noncon-
servative errors due to selection bias with 
respect to health status, we analyzed distribu-
tions of the Charlson comorbidity index in 
study participants and survey nonresponders, 
stratified by UNGD quartile. Categorical and 
continuous variables were compared using 
χ2 tests and t-tests, respectively. For hypoth-
esis testing, p-values < 0.05 were considered 
 
statistically significant.
We used weighted logistic regression 
to evaluate associations between UNGD 
activity and symptoms while adjusting for 
confounding variables. All models compared 
individuals with the outcome(s) of interest 
(“cases”) to the reference group described 
above (“controls”). The use of sampling 
weights allowed us to account for the 
differential patient selection and participa-
tion rates in our stratified design while 
targeting unbiased measures of association 
and obtaining robust standard errors. We 
assigned each participant a sampling weight 
equal to the inverse probability of inclusion in 
the study (see Table S1). Because the weight 
in one stratum (150.8) was substantially 
larger than the other weights, we truncated 
this weight by reducing it to the value of the 
second-highest weight (32.3).
We adjusted all models for these potential 
confounders that we identified a priori: sex, 
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white vs. other), 
age [linear and quadratic terms; to avoid 
collinearity, we centered the age variable by 
subtracting its mean (i.e., Ac = Ai – Amean)], 
receipt of Medical Assistance (never vs. ever), 
and smoking status (never vs. former and 
current). We tested for additional confounding 
by adding linear and quadratic terms for BMI 
and CSD. We retained these covariates in the 
models if they changed associations between 
UNGD and the outcome by ≥ 10%. Analyses 
were performed in R (version 3.0.2, R Project 
for Statistical Computing) and Stata 13.1 
(StataCorp) using the svy command.
We reasoned that UNGD might be 
associated with current CRS only for onset 
of symptoms after 2006, when UNGD 
commenced in Pennsylvania. To test the 
associated hypothesis, we stratified the CRS 
group by date of symptom onset (before/after 
1 January 2006) and reran models within each 
stratum. Although associations of UNGD 
activity with our other outcomes could also 
differ by onset date, our questionnaire did 
not ascertain the onset date of migraine and 
fatigue symptoms.
We performed several sensitivity analyses. 
To explore the impact of sampling weight 
choices, we reran models with full (i.e., 
 Tustin et al.
192 
volume 125 | number 2 | February 2017 • Environmental Health Perspectives
not truncated) weights and again with no 
weights. To determine whether associations 
differed by the length of the UNGD assess-
ment period, we compared associations using 
7-day, 90-day, and 365-day averaged UNGD 
metrics that corresponded to the question-
naire’s recall windows for the three primary 
outcomes. To explore spatial differences 
among groups of participants, we mapped the 
residential locations of individuals with and 
without our primary outcomes stratified by 
UNGD quartile and case/control status. To 
assess whether UNGD was associated with 
symptoms in individuals with past disease or 
moderate symptoms, we created additional 
CRS and fatigue models in which we reclas-
sified some previously excluded individuals as 
“cases” (for details see Supplemental Material, 
“Models of Past Disease and Moderate 
Symptoms”). To assess whether unmeasured 
confounding, including spatial confounding, 
could be responsible for the observed associa-
tions, we created “negative control outcome” 
models (Lipsitch et al. 2010). These adjusted 
logistic regression models evaluated asso-
ciations between UNGD and self-reported 
outcomes (bad breath, ear pain, and cold/flu 
symptoms) that we thought were unlikely to 
be related to UNGD. We expected to find 
no significant associations between UNGD 
and these outcomes; the presence of such 
associations could indicate bias resulting from 
unmeasured confounding. In these models, 
we defined cases as all study participants who 
reported the symptom at least “most of the 
time” in the past 3 months (questions 36, 43, 
and 48 for bad breath, ear pain, and cold/flu 
symptoms, respectively). The reference group 
for each model consisted of all individuals 
who reported the symptom “never” in the 
past 3 months.
Results
Characteristics of the Study 
Population
Questionnaire respondents were 7,785 
individuals from 39 counties in central and 
northeastern Pennsylvania, in regions with 
and without UNGD (Figure 1). Compared 
with questionnaire recipients who did not 
respond, our study population was more 
likely to be female, white, and older (results 
not shown). The continuous UNGD activity 
metric did not differ significantly (p = 0.26) 
between study participants and questionnaire 
nonresponders (Table 1). Study participants 
were less likely than nonresponders to be in 
the highest UNGD quartile. Although the 
Charlson comorbidity index was higher 
in responders (mean = 3.43) than in 
non 
responders (mean = 2.52, p < 0.001), the 
mean Charlson values were similar across all 
UNGD quartiles (Table 1).
We identified 738 participants with 
current CRS and no other primary outcome, 
580 with migraine headache only, and 666 
with higher levels of fatigue only (Table 2). 
These conditions were co-occurring in other 
individuals. There were 268 individuals with 
CRS and migraine, 347 with CRS and higher 
levels of fatigue, 420 with migraine and 
higher levels of fatigue, and 497 with all three 
outcomes. There were 1,380 participants 
with no current or past CRS, no migraine 
headache symptoms, and lower levels of 
fatigue; these individuals comprised the refer-
ence group. Compared with the reference 
group, individuals with each single outcome 
were more likely to be younger and current 
smokers (Table 2). Those with migraine and 
fatigue were more likely to be female, and 
those reporting CRS and fatigue were more 
likely to be white non-Hispanic.

ated with significantly increased odds of 
the following combinations of two or more 
outcomes: CRS and higher levels of fatigue 
[odds ratio (OR) = 1.88; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 1.08, 3.25], migraine headache 
and higher levels of fatigue (OR = 1.95; 
95% CI: 1.18, 3.21), and all three outcomes 
(OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.14) (Table 3). 
The second and third quartiles of UNGD 
were not significantly associated with any of 
the outcomes. In individuals with only one 
outcome, the odds ratios for the fourth quartile 
of UNGD were 1.11 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.65) 
for current CRS, 1.43 (95% CI: 0.94, 2.18) 
for migraine headache, and 1.47 (95% CI: 
0.996, 2.18) for higher levels of fatigue 
(Table 3). In general, participants in the fourth 
quartile of UNGD lived farther north than 
those in other UNGD quartiles (Figure 2).
When we stratified CRS patients by 
onset date, the second (OR = 3.27; 95% CI: 
1.21, 8.82) and fourth (OR = 3.26; 95% CI: 
1.14, 9.36) quartiles of UNGD were associ-
ated with significantly increased odds of CRS 
in those whose symptoms began after 2006 
(see Table S2). There were no associations in 
participants with earlier symptom onset.

In participants with multiple outcomes, 
most inferences were unchanged whether 
we used the full sampling weights, truncated

weights, or no weights (compare Table 3 with 
Table S3). Odds ratios for the fourth quartile 
of UNGD were consistently higher, and had 
wider confidence intervals, in fully weighted 
models than in models with truncated 
weights. For example, the odds ratio for the 
association of the fourth quartile of UNGD 
with the coexistence of migraine and fatigue 
was 2.89 (95% CI: 1.45, 5.76) in the fully 
weighted model. In individuals with single 
outcomes, the fourth quartile of UNGD 
was significantly associated with migraine 
headache (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.17) 
and fatigue (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.10, 3.26) 
in the models with full weights; significant 
associations were also present in unweighted 
models (see Table S3).
UNGD activity, when averaged over 7 
or 365 days, was highly correlated with the 
90-day time-averaged UNGD metric used 
in the primary analyses (Spearman coef-
ficient = 0.98 for both comparisons). Most 
inferences and associations were similar when 
using a 7-day or 365-day averaging period 
(see Table S4). The second quartile of UNGD 
was associated with past CRS, but there were 
no associations of UNGD with moderate 
levels of fatigue (see Table S5). UNGD was 
not associated with the negative control 
outcomes of ear pain, bad breath, or cold/flu 
symptoms (Table 4).
Because only the highest level of UNGD 
was associated with our primary outcomes, we 
compared demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics of individuals in the fourth 
quartile of UNGD with those of participants 
in other UNGD quartiles (see Table S6). 
Participants in the fourth quartile of UNGD 
differed on some covariates, several of which 
were included in the final models. We did 
not include place type in the final adjusted 
models because it could be a surrogate for 
mediators (e.g., individual- or place-level 
socioeconomic status) of associations between 
UNGD and symptoms. In a sensitivity 
analysis that explored the effect of place type, 
some associations were slightly attenuated 
when place type was added to the models, but 
inferences were similar (see Table S7).
Discussion
In our survey of primary care patients in 
central and northeast Pennsylvania, residen-
tial UNGD activity was associated with nasal 
and sinus symptoms, migraine headache, 
and higher levels of fatigue, either alone or 
in combination. Our findings are suggestive 
of a threshold in the relationship between 
UNGD and symptoms because associations 
were present only among participants in the 
fourth quartile of UNGD activity. We found 
stronger associations in individuals with two 
or more co-occurring outcomes. In addition, 
UNGD was associated with CRS in individ-
uals whose nasal and sinus symptoms began 
after the start of UNGD in Pennsylvania, 
although these estimates had lower precision 
owing to the small number of subjects with 
recent CRS onset.
In surveys such as ours, in which selection 
is based on the outcome, regression models 
must include sampling weights (or employ 
another strategy to acknowledge the selection 
mechanism) to avoid bias. However, extreme 
sampling weights can significantly increase the 
model’s variance (Potter 1988). To balance 
bias reduction against variance inflation, 
several techniques have been developed to 
truncate large sampling weights. We employed 
one such technique in our primary analyses. 
We found associations between UNGD and 
symptoms in the primary models as well as in 
fully weighted and unweighted models.
There is limited prior evidence linking 
environmental factors to CRS, migraine 
headache, and fatigue. Exposure to allergens, 
toxicants, and secondhand smoke may trigger 
nasal and sinus symptoms (Fokkens et al. 
2012). However, a recent review found insuf-
ficient epidemiologic evidence from which to 
draw conclusions about occupational or envi-
ronmental risk factors for CRS (Sundaresan 
et al. 2015). Although migraines have a strong 
hormonal and genetic component, they can 
also be triggered by noise, odors, and stress 
(Friedman and De ver Dye 2009; Sjöstrand 
et al. 2010; Sauro and Becker 2009). 
Similarly, fatigue has multiple risk factors 
including sleep deprivation, psychosocial 
stressors, medical disorders, psychiatric factors, 
occupation, and exposure to low levels of 
environmental chemicals (Bell et al. 1998; 
Ranjith 2005; Ricci et al. 2007; Griffith 
and Zarrouf 2008). Our UNGD activity 
metrics were designed to capture all poten-
tial environmental pathways that could affect 
these symptoms.
We did not measure participants’ exposure 
to ambient air pollution. We also did not 
account for conventional oil and gas wells. 
During our study period, the production of 
conventional gas wells in Pennsylvania was 
very low compared with that of unconven-
tional wells. Furthermore, Pennsylvania’s 
conventional wells tend to be in the north-
west and west, where Geisinger has no clinics/
hospitals. The lack of significant geographic 
overlap with our study population makes 
confounding of UNGD associations by 
conventional oil and gas wells unlikely.
Participants in the fourth quartile of 
UNGD activity lived farther north than those 
in other quartiles (Figure 2). This spatial sepa-
ration is due to the location of the Marcellus 
shale, which constrains UNGD to the 
northern portion of the Geisinger catchment 
area. Given the correlation between geography 
and UNGD, we cannot rule out the possi-
bility that spatial confounding was responsible 
for the observed associations. However, we 
note that our models were adjusted for several 
covariates (such as race/ethnicity and socio-
economic status) that could be associated with 
both location and outcome. In addition, the 
null results in our negative control outcome 
models did not suggest spatial confounding.
CRS, migraine headache, and fatigue 
are highly prevalent and produce significant 
societal costs. CRS affects 2–16% of U.S. 
adults and results in emergency department 
visits, antibiotic prescriptions, sinus surgeries, 
and direct healthcare costs (Hastan et al. 
2011; Bhattacharyya 2009; Shashy et al. 2004; 
Tan et al. 2013). Migraines have a prevalence 
of 11–14% and cause substantial temporary 
disability, emergency department visits, outpa-
tient clinic visits, and analgesic use (Lipton 
et al. 2007; Burch et al. 2015). Fatigue

For all models, the reference group consisted of individuals with no current or past CRS, no migraine headache symptoms, and the lowest quartile of fatigue score. All models included 
sampling weights, with the highest weight truncated to the value of the second-highest weight. Models included the following covariates: sex, race/ethnicity (white non-Hispanic 
vs. other), centered age (linear and quadratic terms), Medical Assistance (never vs. ever), and smoking status (never vs. current and former). UNGD activity was averaged over the 
90 days before the survey.
aThese models included centered body mass index as an additional covariate. Because individuals with unknown body mass index were excluded, these case counts are slightly 
lower than those reported in the text.

prevalence, defined in various ways across 
studies, is estimated at 7–45%, and fatigue 
costs U.S. employers > 100 billion USD per 
year in lost productive work time (Ricci et al. 
2007). From a public health and economic 
perspective, it is vital to understand modifiable 
risk factors for these illnesses.
Recent reviews have noted the lack of 
high-quality evidence regarding the health 
effects of UNGD (Adgate et al. 2014; Werner 
et al. 2015). Our study of 7,785 Pennsylvania 
residents is the largest survey of symptoms 
with respect to UNGD and has several 
strengths when compared with prior studies. 
We selected a population-based adult sample 
with no exclusion criteria. Reporting bias was 
minimized by the fact that UNGD was not 
identified as a study aim, and response rates 
did not differ by proximity to UNGD. Our 
time-varying UNGD activity metric incorpo-
rated well phase and intensity measures such 
as total depth and gas production. We used 
standardized and validated instruments to 
assess fatigue and migraine, respectively, and 
we used consensus epidemiologic guidelines to 
assess CRS.
This study had several limitations. In 
general, cross-sectional surveys such as ours 
cannot assess temporal relationships between 
exposures and outcomes, and we did not 
ascertain the onset dates of some symptoms. 
We note, however, that our UNGD activity 
metrics could theoretically be used to establish 
temporality because they can be computed 
for any date prior to symptom onset. Our 
ascertainment of self-reported outcomes was 
susceptible to various types of information 
bias. For example, despite the fact that our 
questionnaire did not mention UNGD, indi-
viduals residing near UNGD may have over-
reported symptoms. There was some evidence 
of selection bias because survey participants 
had poorer health (measured by the Charlson 
comorbidity index) than nonresponders. 
However, differences in health status were 
similar across levels of UNGD activity. 
Another limitation is that our estimates of 
well development phase durations, although 
based on published average values, may have 
been incorrect for individual wells. Further 
exposure misclassification could have occurred 
because our UNGD activity metric was 
based on residential addresses. Participants’ 
exposure to UNGD activity could have 
been affected by unmeasured factors such as 
occupation, travel, and time spent outdoors. 
Additionally, our UNGD activity metric did 
not allow identification of specific exposures 
or exposure pathways.
Conclusions
UNGD was associated with CRS, migraine 
headache, and fatigue symptoms in a large 
population-based survey. Associations 
were stronger in patients with two or more 
outcomes. Our work has several advantages 
over previous studies, making it an impor-
tant addition to the growing body of evidence 
that UNGD is associated with adverse health 
effects. Further research, including more 
sophisticated exposure and outcome measure-
ments, is necessary to evaluate whether these 
associations are causal and to elucidate the 
mechanisms for these findings.

UNGD, unconventional natural gas development.
Individuals having the symptom at least “most of the time” in the past 3 months were compared with those having the 
symptom “never” in the past 3 months. All models included sampling and response weights, and the highest weight 
was truncated to the value of the second-highest weight. Models included the following covariates: sex, race/ethnicity 
(white non-Hispanic vs. other), centered age (linear and quadratic terms), Medical Assistance (never vs. ever), and 
smoking status (never vs. current and former). UNGD activity was averaged over the 90 days before the survey.
