Environmental events are processed on multiple timescales via hierarchical organization of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in the
brain. The dependence of neural timescales and TRWs on altered states of consciousness is unclear. States of reduced consciousness are
marked by a shift toward slowing of neural dynamics (�1 Hz) in EEG/ECoG signals. We hypothesize that such prolongation of intrinsic
timescalesarealsoseeninblood-oxygen-level-dependent(BOLD)signals.Totestthishypothesis,wemeasuredthetimescalesofintrinsic
BOLD signals using mean frequency (MF) and temporal autocorrelation (AC) in healthy volunteers (n � 23; male/female 14/9) during
graded sedation with propofol. We further examined the relationship between the intrinsic timescales (local/voxel level) and its regional
connectivity (across neighboring voxels; regional homogeneity, ReHo), global (whole-brain level) functional connectivity (GFC), and
topographical similarity (Topo). Additional results were obtained from patients undergoing deep general anesthesia (n � 12; male/
female: 5/7) and in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) (n � 21; male/female: 14/7). We found that MF, AC, and ReHo
increased,whereasGFCandTopodecreased,duringpropofolsedation.Thelocalalterationsoccurbeforechangesofdistantconnectivity.
Conversely, all of these parameters decreased in deep anesthesia and in patients with DOC. We conclude that propofol synchronizes local
neuronal interactions and prolongs the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals. These effects may impede communication among distant
brain regions. Furthermore, the intrinsic timescales exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and DOC. These
results improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness in pharmacologic and neuropathologic states.

Introduction
The capacity of the brain to integrate complex streams of infor-
mation requires a multitude of coexisting spatiotemporal scales.
In the spatial domain, a basic organizing principle of the visual
system is the increasingly large spatial receptive fields of neurons
along hierarchical cortical pathways (Hubel, 1988). An analogous

Significance Statement
Information processing in the brain occurs through a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in multiple timescales.
Anesthetic drugs induce a reversible suppression of consciousness and thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate the state
dependence of neural timescales. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that sedation with propofol is accompanied by the
prolongationofthetimescalesofintrinsicBOLDsignalspresumablyreflectingenlargedTRWs.Weshowthatthisisaccomplished
by an increase of local and regional signal synchronization, effects that may disrupt information exchange among distant brain
regions. Furthermore, we show that the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep
anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness.

 gradient of scaling and selectivity also exists in the temporal do-
main. Recent studies reveal that environmental events are pro-
cessed on multiple timescales via a hierarchical organization of
temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in the brain (Hasson et al.,
2008; Lerner et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2014). The TRW of a
neuron is defined as the length of time before a response during
which sensory information may affect that response. Therefore,
the TRWs reflect the timescale on which a specific brain region
typically processes information. For example, short TRWs of
early sensory areas process rapid sensory information, whereas
longer TRWs of higher-order brain areas integrate perceptual
and cognitive events that unfold over longer time periods (Has-
son et al., 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2015). Although it has not been
demonstrated conclusively, the size of TRWs in different brain
regions has been assumed to be proportional to the timescales of
intrinsic BOLD signal dynamics (Honey et al., 2012; Stephens et
al., 2013).
The hierarchy of neural timescales permits the brain to link
multiple perceptual timescales, thus constructing a temporal conti-
nuity of conscious experience (Northoff and Huang, 2017). Anes-
thetic drugs induce a reversible suppression of consciousness and
thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate the potential state
dependence of neural timescales. States of reduced consciousness
are marked by a shift toward slowing of neural dynamics (�1 Hz)
in EEG/ECoG signals (Lewis et al., 2012; Ní Mhuircheartaigh et
al., 2013). We hypothesize that such prolongation of intrinsic time-
scales may be also seen in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
signals, which may be linked to simultaneous changes in local and
global neuronal interactions that support the information integra-
tion necessary for consciousness (Alkire et al., 2008; Tononi et al.,
2016).
Most previous studies on anesthetic-induced unconscious-
ness have focused on the spatial aspect of functional alterations
such as functional connectivity using both fMRI (Boveroux et al.,
2010; Schrouff et al., 2011; Schro
¨ter et al., 2012; Guldenmund et
al., 2013, 2016; Liu et al., 2013a; Bonhomme et al., 2016) and
EEG/ECoG (Lee et al., 2009, 2013; Ku et al., 2011; Boly et al.,
2012; Go
´mez et al., 2013; Jordan et al., 2013; Mashour, 2014).
However, the possible relationship between intrinsic functional
timescales and the spatial reconfigurations of connectivity during
diminished consciousness remains largely unknown and there-
fore warrants examination. If anesthetic drugs indeed cause a
prolongation of intrinsic functional timescales of the brain,
which is paralleled by an increase of local neuronal synchroniza-
tion (Supp et al., 2011), then there are at least two possible mech-
anisms linking the temporal and spatial features of neural
dynamics. The first possibility is that, as anesthetics block distant
(long-range) communication, they functionally isolate major brain
areas from each other. This isolation may promote the local syn-
chronization of neuronal populations, reflected in the increase in
temporal autocorrelation of each disconnected brain region. The
second possibility is that anesthetics may exert a direct synchro-
nizing effect on neurons or neuronal networks, increasing local
and/or regional functional connectivity, which then impedes dis-
tant communication.
To test our hypothesis regarding the prolongation of intrinsic
timescales and the postulated two alternative mechanisms, we
examined the relationships between the timescales of intrinsic
BOLD signals (local/voxel level) and its regional (across neigh-
boring voxels) and global/distant (whole brain level) functional
connectivity in experiments performed with resting-state fMRI
in healthy volunteers undergoing graded levels of sedation with
propofol. Intrinsic timescales were measured by mean frequency
(MF) and temporal autocorrelation. Regional, global functional
connectivity and topographical similarity were assessed and com-
pared with the timescale indices. Finally, to interpret these exper-
iments in relation to other unconscious states, we extended our
analysis to data from participants exposed to surgical levels of
general anesthesia and patients with disorders of consciousness
(DOC).
Materials and Methods
Experimental setup and design. We report findings from three sets of data.
The bulk of the report is based on the first dataset (Dataset-1) obtained at
the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). The Institutional Review
Board of MCW approved the experimental protocol. Part of Dataset-1
was previously published using analyses different from those applied
here (Liu et al., 2017a, b). In this study, we used data from 23 healthy
volunteers (male/female 14/9; 19–35 years). Fifteen subjects received
four 15 min scans in wakefulness, propofol-induced light and deep seda-
tion (1–2 �g/ml plasma concentration), and recovery. Transition from
deep sedation to recovery (20 min scans) was recorded in 16 subjects,
eight of which were part of the 15. Additional data for transition states
were obtained from eight other subjects. Two levels of responsiveness
were targeted: light sedation, in which volunteers showed lethargic re-
sponse to verbal commands (observer’s assessment of alertness/sedation,
OAAS, score 4; Chernik et al., 1990), and deep sedation, during which
volunteers showed no response to verbal commands (OAAS score 2-1).
The corresponding target plasma concentrations vary across subjects
(light sedation: 0.98 � 0.18 �g/ml; deep sedation: 1.88 � 0.24 �g/ml)
because of the variability in individual sensitivity to anesthetics. At each
level of sedation, the plasma concentration of propofol was maintained at
equilibrium by continuously adjusting the infusion rate to maintain the
balance between accumulation and elimination of the drug. The infusion
rate was manually controlled as guided by the output of a computer
simulation developed for target-controlled drug infusion (STANPUMP;
Shafer, 1996) based on the pharmacokinetic model (Marsh et al., 1991).
Transition was initiated at the end of deep sedation by stopping the
infusion pump. Eight subjects’ transition data were acquired imme-
diately after the onset of infusion stop and 7 subjects’ transition data
acquisition was started 3 min before the onset of infusion stop. One
subject’s transition data were acquired starting 10 min before the stop of
infusion and an additional 8 min scan was performed after the 20 min
scan. To make the data consistent across subjects, we aligned the time of
infusion stop and used the maximal data length available across all sub-
jects (17 min). Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
monitoring was conducted during the experiment, including electrocar-
diogram, noninvasive blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry, and end tidal
carbon dioxide gas monitoring. Supplemental oxygen was administered
prophylactically via nasal cannula.
fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
data were acquired at the MCW using a 3 T Signa GE 750 scanner (GE
Healthcare) with a standard 32-channel transmit/receive head coil. Func-
tional imaging data were acquired using gradient-echo EPI images of the
whole brain (41 slices, TR/TE � 2000/25 ms, slice thickness � 3.5 mm,
in-plane resolution � 3.5 � 3.5 mm; FOV � 224 mm, flip angle � 77°,
image matrix: 64 � 64). High-resolution spoiled gradient-recalled echo
anatomical images were acquired before the functional scans with TE/
TR/TI, 8.2/3.2/450 ms; slice thickness, 1 mm; number of slices, 150; flip
angle, 12°; field of view, 24 cm; matrix size, 256 � 256.
Preprocessing steps were implemented in AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.
gov/) including: (1) discarding the first two frames of each fMRI run;
(2) physiological noise correction through removal of time-locked car-
diac and respiratory artifacts using RETROICOR (Glover et al., 2000);
(3) slice timing correction; (4) rigid body correction/realignment within
and across runs; (5) coregistration with high-resolution anatomical im-
ages; (6) spatial normalization into Talaraich stereotactic space; (7) resa-
mpling to 3 � 3 � 3 mm 3 voxels; (8) regressing out linear and nonlinear
drift (equivalent to a high-pass filtering of 0.0067 Hz), head motion and
its temporal derivative, and mean time series from the white matter
(WM) and CSF to control for non-neural noise (Fox et al., 2005; the WM

 and CSF masks were eroded by one voxel to minimize partial voluming
with gray matter; Chai et al., 2012); (9) spatial smoothing with 8 mm
full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel; and (10) the time
course per voxel of each run was normalized to zero mean and unit variance
(z-value), accounting for differences in variance of non-neural origin
(e.g., distance from head coil; He, 2011; Stephens et al., 2013).
The issue of head motion artifacts was addressed rigorously based on
prior studies (Power et al., 2012, 2014; van Dijk et al., 2012). The esti-
mated motion parameters per subject were inspected for each frame and
each sliding window (see below for details of sliding window analysis).
Sliding windows that contained head motion larger than 1.5 mm trans-
lation or 1.5° rotation (half voxel size; processed data are 3 mm isotropic
voxels derived from 3.5 � 3.5 � 3.5 mm acquisition voxels) were cen-
sored out from subsequent analysis. The mean proportion of windows
censored out was 5.2% in wakefulness, 9.8% in light sedation, 12.2% in
deep sedation, 8.7% in transition, and 6.3% in recovery. This censoring
was not framewise; it flagged out the entire window (4 min length) if
motion in any of the contained frames exceeded threshold. Therefore,
this censoring did not damage the temporal continuity of the data within
each window. The calculated indices of head motion (shift and rotation)
for each subject (Zang et al., 2007) were similar across conditions.
Applying stricter thresholds for framewise displacement (FD) motion
censoring; for example, FD � 0.15 mm (Power et al., 2014) would dam-
age the temporal continuity of the data and thus introduce artifacts into
the temporal measures including autocorrelation and power spectrum.
To confirm that our relatively liberal motion censoring described above
did not affect the results, we also sought a stricter threshold that allowed
us to preserve �50% subjects (8/15) with �50% continuous data length
(7.5 min/15 min) in wakefulness, light sedation, deep sedation, and re-
covery (excluding transition states). To this end, the FD was first calcu-
lated using framewise Euclidean norm (square root of the sum squares)
of the six-dimension motion derivatives. We then tested multiple FD
thresholds, ranging from stringent (FD � 0.2 mm; Power et al., 2014) to
lenient (FD � 0.5 mm; Power et al., 2012) thresholds with 0.1 mm steps.
We found that FD � 0.4 mm preserved 9 subjects with �249 frames (8.3
min) continuous data across the 4 conditions. To achieve equal degrees
of freedom, we selected equal length of continuous data (249 frames)
across the four conditions and nine subjects. We then calculated all mea-
sures of interest without sliding window analysis and performed group
analyses for confirmation of results. We calculated the mean and SD of
Euclidean norm time series (Mean-enorm and SD-enorm, respectively)
for each subject and each condition and performed group-level repeated-
measures ANOVA. We then tested whether including head motion indi-
ces (Mean-enorm and SD-enorm) as covariants in the group analysis
affected our results (Yan et al., 2013).
Definition of functional networks. We adopted a well established node
template from a previous study (Power et al., 2011) containing 264 pu-
tative functional areas (10 mm diameter spheres, 32 voxels per sphere)
across the whole-brain gray matter. The original template consisted of 11
functional networks plus 36 uncertain areas (Power et al., 2011; Cole et
al., 2014; Huang et al., 2017). In this study, we excluded the cerebellum
and uncertain areas and thus included 10 functional networks (226 func-
tional areas in total), namely, subcortical (Sub), dorsal attention (DA),
ventral attention (VA), default mode (DMN), frontoparietal task control
(FPTC), cingulo-opercular task control (COTC), salience (Sal), sensory/
somatomotor (SS), auditory (Audi), and visual networks (Visual). The
functional mask of the 10 networks’ union was defined as the global
mask, which was used to extract the global value for each of the following
measurement.
Sliding window analysis. We adopted a dynamic sliding window ap-
proachinthefollowinganalyses,whichhasbeenusedpreviously(Hutchison
et al., 2013; Barttfeld et al., 2015; Hudetz et al., 2015). Two considerations
motived us to perform this analysis. First, for the transition data, from
stopping the pump to recovery, we assumed that the measures (see be-
low) should change (either increase or decrease) as a function of time.
The sliding window analysis is an appropriate way to track this dynamic
change. To make it consistent across conditions (wakefulness, light seda-
tion, deep sedation, and recovery), this sliding window analysis was ap-
plied to the entire dataset. Second, we did not assume that a constant
estimated propofol concentration (during light sedation and deep seda-
tion) would necessarily yield a constant anesthetic effect in the brain.
This also supports a sliding window analysis.
One concern with the sliding window approach is the choice of win-
dow size because it has been varied from tens of seconds to several min-
utes in previous practices (Hutchison et al., 2013; Barttfeld et al., 2015;
Hindriks et al., 2016; Laumann et al., 2017; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016).
Smaller window size may capture more transient changes of the dynam-
ics, but it can reduce the statistical reliability and make it more difficult to
perform group averaging of dynamic time courses (Hindriks et al., 2016).
Conversely, longer window size may capture changes that are more static
with larger statistical reliability (e.g., for a given brain state induced by
anesthetics). Because the focus of this study was to delineate the state
transitions as a function of drug effect, we chose a relatively long window
size of 4 min (120 frames) with 20 s (10 frames) time step. Choosing a
longer sliding window permitted us to average the time course of a given
measurement across subjects. In this sense, the time courses yielded by
the longer window size mainly reflect the dynamic changes induced by
the anesthetics instead of intrinsic variabilities. Another consideration
was that the window size provided the sufficient length of data for calcu-
lating the signal’s temporal autocorrelation and power spectrum. Finally,
the commonly used frequency range for analyzing the fluctuations of
spontaneous brain activity has been between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz (Fox and
Raichle, 2007). Because 4 min data may not provide an accurate estima-
tion of the lowest frequencies near 0.01 Hz (with only two cycles in the 4
min’s data), we made a trade-off by band-pass filtering the BOLD signal
in 0.02–0.1 Hz and normalized to zero mean and unit variance for each
sliding window.
Mean Frequency. The power spectrum was obtained by computing the
periodogram of each voxel time series using AFNI program 3dPeriodo-
gram. Tapering was applied using the Hamming window to reduce bias
and error variance for spectral estimation in finite data (Babadi and
Brown, 2014). The MF of a spectrum was calculated as the sum of the
product of the spectrogram power intensity and the frequency, divided
by the total sum of spectrogram power intensity as follows:
MF ��i�0
n PiFi
�i�0
n Pi
Where n is the number of frequency bins in the spectrum, Fi is the
frequency of spectrum at bin i of n, and Pi is the power intensity of
spectrum at bin i of n. Lower MF indicates a shift toward a longer time-
scale or slower dynamics. The MF was calculated for each sliding window
and each voxel in the brain, yielding a time course of 3D MF maps. The
MF time courses were then extracted from the global brain mask and
different networks for secondary group analysis.
Temporal autocorrelation. Temporal autocorrelation of the intrinsic
BOLD signals was first calculated at lag-1 (first-order) as lag-1 temporal
autocorrelation (AC1) � corr( yt, yt�1), where y is the fMRI-BOLD time
course. Lag-1 autocorrelation is a robust measure of the decay of the
autocorrelation function that is commonly used to characterize dynam-
ical systems including neurophysiological and fMRI data (Scheffer et al.,
2009, 2012; Kaneoke et al., 2012; Tagliazucchi et al., 2016; Meisel et al.,
2017a, b). A higher AC1 indicates a shift toward slower dynamics. For a
more comprehensive characterization of BOLD timescales, we also ex-
amined the autocorrelation function from 2 to 50 s (2 s step, given TR �
2 s) yielding 25 correlation coefficients. The 50 s cutoff matched the
upper limit of the filtered fMRI frequency band (0.02–0.1 Hz). We ob-
served two time ranges of interest, 10–18 s and 30–38 s, which showed a
clear difference across conditions (see Fig. 3A for visualization). The
latter range included the previously reported 34 s time lag of interest that
showed the strongest relationship between structural topology and spon-
taneous activity (Sethi et al., 2017). We defined ACR1 and ACR2 by the
sum of the absolute value of correlation coefficients within the two fre-
quency ranges, respectively. AC1, ACR1, and ACR2 were calculated for
each sliding window and each voxel in the brain, yielding respective 3D
time course maps. Similar to the analysis pipeline for MF, autocorrela-
tion time courses were extracted from the global brain mask and different
networks for secondary group analysis.

Huang et al. • Intrinsic Neural Timescales of Unconsciousness
 Regional functional connectivity. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was
calculated at the voxel level using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance
between the BOLD time series for specified voxel and those of its 26
nearest neighbors (�2 mm radius sphere; Zang et al., 2004). ReHo quan-
tifies the intraregional signal correlation. ReHo analysis was performed
for each sliding window with the AFNI program 3dReHo, which yields a
voxelwise ReHo map (Fisher’s Z transformed). Because spatial smooth-
ing could artificially enhance ReHo and reduce its reliability (Zuo et al.,
2013), we calculated ReHo from nonsmoothed BOLD time series. Spatial
smoothing was subsequently applied with an 8 mm full-width at half-
maximum Gaussian kernel to the ReHo maps.
Distant functional connectivity. Functional connectivity in the centi-
meter range was calculated based on the aforementioned node template,
including 10 networks with 226 functional areas (Power et al., 2011),
where the minimal Euclidian distance between 2 centers of any pair of
nodes is 2 cm. Distant connectivity is defined over the range �1.4 cm
(Sepulcre et al., 2010). This is different from ReHo, which reflects con-
nectivity within �2 mm radius sphere. Next, we computed the Pearson
correlation coefficient of the time courses between each pair of nodes,
yielding a pairwise 226 � 226 correlation matrix (Fisher’s Z transformed)
per sliding window. For a measure of global functional connectivity
(GFC), we calculated the average of the triangular of the matrix of size
226 � (226 � 1)/2.
Topographical similarity. Topographical similarity (Topo) was defined
by the correlation coefficient between a reference correlation matrix (tri-
angular) and a correlation matrix for each sliding window of each sub-
ject. The reference correlation matrix was obtained by averaging the
correlation matrix of 15 min rs-fMRI during wakefulness across 15 sub-
jects. Therefore, Topo quantifies the divergence of spatial connectivity
configuration (among the nodes) from baseline over time (see Tagliazuc-
chi et al., 2016 for a similar measurement of similarity between functional
and anatomical topography).
Deep general anesthesia and patients with DOC. For a comparison with
deeper states of unconsciousness, the above analyses (except for the slid-
ing window analysis due to limited data length) were extended to two
other independent datasets. Dataset-2 included 12 subjects (male/
female: 5/7; age: 32–63 years) with three 8 min rs-fMRI scans from
wakefulness, light sedation at 1.3 �g/ml, and deep anesthesia at 4 �g/ml
propofol. This received approval from the Ethics Committee of Huashan
Hospital, Fudan University. All subjects gave written informed consent.
The subjects were selected on elective trans-sphenoidal approach to con-
trol on pituitary microadenoma (�10 mm in diameter without sella
expansion using radiological and plasma endocrinal indicator). Subjects
were ASA physical status I or II grade with no history of craniotomy,
cerebral neuropathy, or vital organ dysfunction. All subjects received
intravenous propofol anesthesia by target-controlled infusion. This
study used a Siemens 3T MAGNETOM scanner with a head coil to ex-
tract whole-brain gradient-echo EPI images (slice number � 33, TR/
TE � 2000/30 ms, slice thickness � 5 mm, field of view � 210 mm, flip
angle � 90°, image matrix: 64 � 64). High-resolution anatomical images
were obtained. Another 23 healthy subjects provided control data (no
propofol infusion) with the same scanning protocol. The latter dataset
was used to calculate the reference correlation matrix for topographical
similarity calculation in both Dataset-2 and the following Dataset-3.
Dataset-3 included 21 patients (male/female: 14/7) with DOC and 28
healthy control subjects (male/female: 14/14). This dataset derives from
our previous published data (Huang et al., 2014, 2016). Because brain
lesions may affect topographical similarity, for this analysis, we included
only 12 DOC subjects who had well preserved anatomical structures (see
Huang et al., 2016 for the inclusion and exclusion criteria).
Statistical analysis. In Dataset-1, the mean (across windows) of each
measured quantity (MF, AC1, ACR1, ACR2, ReHo, GFC, and Topo) for
a given state of consciousness (e.g., light sedation) was tested against the
wakeful baseline (paired-sample t test; except for transition with two-
sample t test). The slope of each measurement (as a function of time;
fraction time unit in percentage of windows) of each state was tested
against zero (one-sample t test). In Dataset-2, the mean of each measure-
ment for a given condition was tested against the wakefulness baseline by
paired-sample t test. In Dataset-3, the mean of each measurement for
DOC group was tested against the healthy control group by two-sample
t test. Unless otherwise stated (e.g., uncorrected), p-values with FDR
correction were reported.
Results
Decrease of MF during sedation
We observed a graded global decrease of MF from wakefulness to
light and deep sedation, followed by an increase during transition
and return to baseline in recovery (Fig. 1A–C). A significant mean
difference of global MF between wakefulness and deep sedation
was found (p � 0.038). We also measured the slope of MF versus
time for each state. A negative slope was seen during light seda-
tion (p � 0.029) and a positive slope was seen during the transi-
tion period (p � 0.004). Significant slopes indicated that, despite
the presumably pharmacokinetically stable propofol plasma con-
centration during light or deep sedation, the reconfiguration of
the power spectrum (and MF) continued to progress with time.
The MF (�0.05 Hz) obtained during wakefulness was consistent
with previous fMRI and computation modeling studies (Glerean
et al., 2012; Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2015) in which 0.04–0.07 Hz in
fMRI contains more robust and functionally relevant signals than
the other bands.
To determine the possible difference in the contribution of
specific networks, we examined the MF values for predefined
functional networks. We found that the MF changes of all net-
works behaved similarly across different states (Fig. 1D).
Increase of temporal autocorrelation during sedation
The timescale of intrinsic BOLD signal was also characterized by
the temporal autocorrelation. Based on the observed changes in
MF, we expected to see an increase of AC1 during sedation. As
anticipated, we observed a graded global increase of AC1 from
wakefulness to light and deep sedation, followed by a decrease
during transition and return to baseline in recovery (Fig. 2A,B).
A significant mean difference of global AC1 between wakefulness
and deep sedation was found (p � 0.042). A positive slope of AC1
was seen during light sedation (p � 0.038, uncorrected) and a
negative slope of AC1 was seen during the transition period (p �
0.004). The AC1 changes of all networks behaved similarly across
different states (Fig. 2C).
In addition to lag-1 temporal autocorrelation, we found two
other time ranges (lags), 10–18 s (ACR1) and 30–38 s (ACR2),
which showed differences across conditions (Fig. 3A). We ob-
served similar results of ACR1 and ACR2 to those in AC1 (Fig.
3B–E), albeit the changes were smaller in ACR2. Significant mean
differences of global ACR1 between wakefulness and deep seda-
tion (p � 0.045) as well as between wakefulness and transition
(p � 0.047) were found. A positive slope of ACR1 was seen dur-
ing light sedation (p � 0.049) and a negative slope of AC1 was
seen during transition (p � 0.007). Last, a negative slope of ACR2
was seen during transition (p � 0.033, uncorrected).
We demonstrated a global decrease of MF and increase of
temporal autocorrelation of intrinsic BOLD signals during seda-
tion, suggesting a prolongation of the brain’s intrinsic functional
timescales.

signals at the single-voxel level may reflect an increase of local
neuronal synchronization (Supp et al., 2011). Although direct
assessment of neuronal synchronization within a single voxel
cannot be determined by fMRI, one would expect that local neu-

 ronal synchronization may extend to an intermediate spatial
scale, such as regional brain areas with tens of voxels as measured
by ReHo. Indeed, we observed that the global ReHo changes
shared a similar trend with AC1, ACR1, and ACR2. That is, ReHo
steadily increased from wakefulness to light/deep sedation, de-
creased during transition, and returned to baseline during recov-
ery (Fig. 4A). We found a positive slope of ReHo during deep
sedation (p � 0.044, uncorrected) and a negative slope during
the transition period (p � 0.049, uncorrected). We did not find a
significant treatment effect of the global ReHo (mean) across
different states by repeated-measures ANOVA. However, when
examining ReHo in different networks, significant treatment ef-
fects were seen in the subcortical (F � 5.44, df � 3, p � 0.003),
ventral attention (F � 2.93, df � 3, p � 0.045), and salience (F �
3.18, df � 3, p � 0.034) networks. This suggests that propofol seda-
tion induced network-specific alterations in regional connectivity
In contrast to ReHo, GFC showed the opposite pattern (Fig.
4B). A significant decrease in GFC was found in transition com-
pared with wakefulness baseline (p � 0.019) and a positive slope
of GFC was seenduringtransition(p�0.012).ThechangesofGFC
in different networks were indistinguishable from each other and
were similar to the global changes.

 The changes of Topo showed a similar pattern to that of GFC
(Fig. 4C). Specifically, significant decreases in Topo were found
during deep sedation (p � 0.017) and transition (p � 0.001)
compared with the wakeful baseline. A positive slope of Topo was
seen during transition (p � 0.002). Collectively, the results of GFC
and Topo indicate a breakdown of distant (long-range) functional
connectivity and spatial configuration during sedation.
It is important to note that the local measures (MF, AC1,
and ACR1) changed during light sedation (significant slopes),
whereas global measures (GFC and Topo) did not (no signif-
icant slopes). The changes of GFC and Topo occurred mostly
during deep sedation and transition rather than light seda-
tion. These results suggest that, during graded sedation, local
changes presumably reflecting local neuronal synchroniza-

 tion occur before global changes affecting distant neuronal
communication.
To illustrate the temporal interdependence of these variables,
the trajectory of the changes of global measures (GFC and Topo)
were plotted as a function of local measures (MF, AC1, ACR1, and
ACR2; Fig. 5). Overall, we observed a positive relationship between
global measures and MF and a negative relationship between global
measures and temporal autocorrelations (AC1, ACR1, and ACR2).
Confirmation of results after framewise motion censoring
To confirm that our results were unaffected by relatively liberal mo-
tion censoring, we performed FD motion censoring in a subject
subgroup (n � 9; 249 frames). The results replicated our main find-
ings with window-wise censoring approach. Specifically, significant
differencesbetweenwakefulnessanddeepsedationwerefoundinall
measures: AC1 (p � 0.012), ACR1 (p � 0.019), ACR2 (p � 0.048),
MF (p � 0.043, uncorrected), ReHo (p � 0.046, uncorrected), GFC
(p � 0.008), and Topo (p � 0.008). We also found significant dif-
ferences between wakefulness and light sedation in Topo (p �
0.048) and between wakefulness and recovery in ACR1 (p � 0.018),
MF(p�0.021),andGFC(p�0.031;Fig.6).Inaddition,wedidnot
observe any difference between conditions in either Mean-enorm
(F � 0.26, p � 0.85, df � 3) or SD-enorm (F � 0.05, p � 0.98, df �
3) of the head motion indices using repeated-measures ANOVA.
Last, we confirmed that all results remained significant by including
the Mean-enorm and SD-enorm as covariance. Together, our find-
ings were robust with different head motion censoring approaches
(window-wise and framewise).
Local, regional, and global alterations in deep general
anesthesia and DOC
We investigated whether the spatiotemporal alterations of local
dynamics and functional connectivity (regional and global) ob-
served in sedation could be seen during a surgical level of deep
general anesthesia (Dataset-2) and in DOC patients (Dataset-3).
We found that all measures obtained during light sedation in
Dataset-2 were consistent with those in Dataset-1. However,
there was a significant increase of MF (p � 0.001) and a signifi-
cant decrease of AC1 (p � 0.001), ACR1 (p � 0.007), and ReHo
(p � 0.014) during deep general anesthesia in Dataset-2. The
other two global measures, GFC and Topo, both showed a signif-
icant decrease (p � 0.012 for GFC; p � 0.007 for Topo) during
deep general anesthesia (Fig. 7, green values). Furthermore, the re-
sults of ACR1 (p � 0.001), ACR2 (p � 0.01), ReHo (p � 0.019),
GFC (p � 0.006), and Topo (p � 0.001) in DOC patients (vs
healthy control group) in Dataset-3 were similar to those during
deep general anesthesia in Dataset-2, whereas the MF (p � 0.001)
and AC1 (p � 0.001) values for DOC were between those in
wakefulness and deep general anesthesia (Fig. 7, blue values).
Collectively, these findings suggest that spatiotemporal altera-
tions of local dynamics and functional connectivity are distinct in
sedation, deep general anesthesia, and DOC.
Discussion
We demonstrated a prolongation of the timescales of intrinsic
BOLD signal dynamics during propofol sedation with a decrease
of MF and an increase of temporal autocorrelation (AC1, ACR1,

 and ACR2). These local changes occurred in association with an
elevated ReHo, a breakdown of GFC, and a departure from the
presumably optimized spatial configuration of the wakeful base-
line (Topo). The local changes seemed to occur before global
functional alterations, suggesting that propofol promotes local
neurons to synchronize, which in turn reconfigures whole-brain
connectivity. Furthermore, we showed that deep general anesthe-
sia and DOC could be distinguished from the sedated state by the
opposite direction of changes of timescale indices.
Prolongation of the brain’s intrinsic functional timescales
during sedation
The global prolongation of the timescales of intrinsic BOLD sig-
nals may indicate an enlarged TRW, acting as a low-pass filter or
sparse sampling of the inputs from extrinsic and intrinsic sources,
reducing the bandwidth of information processing. This is sup-
ported by our behavioral assessment that light sedation was asso-
ciated with lethargic response to verbal commands, whereas deep
sedation was associated with absent response to verbal commands.

Huang et al. • Intrinsic Neural Timescales of Unconsciousness
 The mismatch between the brain’s intrinsic functional timescales
and the timescales of experienced world events may not only affect
information acquisition at relatively short timescales, but may also
impede information integration over longer timescales. This may
best be interpreted as information “received but not perceived”
(Hudetz, 2006), which may also explain disrupted semantic pro-
cessing (Davis et al., 2007; Adapa et al., 2014) and auditory pre-
dictive coding (Uhrig et al., 2016) during sedation.
Differential alterations of local, regional, and global
functional organizations during sedation
The increase of local temporal autocorrelation may indicate an
increase of local neuronal synchronization (Supp et al., 2011;
Honey et al., 2012). This is consistent with previous EEG/ECoG
studies that found an increase of local phase coherence in alpha-,
beta-, and delta-frequency bands during loss of consciousness
(Supp et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Purdon et al., 2013; Ishizawa et
al., 2016; Wollstadt et al., 2017). This was also seen in the neuro-
nal activity of layer 2/3 using two-photon calcium activity imag-
ing (Lissek et al., 2016). Moreover, a recent study provides a link
between neuronal timescales (spiking activity) and large-scale
signals measured by EEG and fMRI (Meisel et al., 2017a, b).
Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that different rhythms
seen in EEG/ECoG signals have distinct functions and the exact
relationship between fMRI slowing and EEG/ECoG slowing dur-
ing sedation requires further investigation.
The increase of local neuronal synchronization was also seen
at the intermediate spatial scale through increases in the ReHo
across neighboring voxels during sedation. This is consistent with
a recent rodent study that found strengthened ReHo in several
brain areas under six different anesthetic regimens (Wu et al.,
2017). The increase of ReHo may be related to an increase of local
self-inhibitory connectivity resulting from the enhancement of
GABAA receptor activity by propofol (Go
´mez et al., 2013), particu-
larly the increasing strength and prolonged decay time of inhibitory
signaling from interneurons to pyramidal cells and from thalamic
reticular neurons to thalamic relay cells (Huguenard and McCor-
mick, 2007; Franks, 2008; Ching et al., 2010).
In contrast to the increase of local/regional signal synchroni-
zation, we observed a global reduction of distant functional con-
nectivity during sedation, which is consistent with previous studies
(Boveroux et al., 2010; Martuzzi et al., 2010; Schrouff et al., 2011;
Schro
¨ter et al., 2012; Guldenmund et al., 2013, 2016; Liu et al.,

 reduced topographical similarity during sedation, suggesting that
the spatial configuration of functional connectivity diverges from
that of baseline over time.
Importantly, our results showed that local temporal dynamics
changeearlierthanglobalfunctionalconnectivityandtopographical
changes. Although the common view is that anesthetics block
distant communication (Boveroux et al., 2010; Bonhomme et al.,
2016; Hudetz, 2012; Lee et al., 2013), our present findings suggest
that the primary effect of anesthetics is the synchronization of
neurons in local circuits, increasing local and/or regional func-
tional connectivity. This in turn impairs the ability of local areas
to functionally couple with distant ones, reducing the brain’s
ability to integrate information. This conclusion should be con-
sidered tentative. Admittedly, a firm causal relationship between
the described events is difficult to assert from our data because of
the poor temporal resolution of fMRI and the lack of direct neu-
ronal evidence. Future studies including those with different or
noncanonical anesthetics such as ketamine combining fMRI with
EEG/ECoG and computational modeling may help to solidify
our conclusion.
Despite the presumed equilibrium of propofol plasma con-
centrations during light and deep sedation, local/regional mea-
sures continued to change as indicated by a slope significantly
different from zero. These changes suggest a dynamic, progres-
sive reconfiguration of intrinsic brain activity during light and
deep sedation, which is unlikely to be a pharmacokinetic effect.
Deep general anesthesia and DOC have distinct
spatiotemporal properties compared with sedation
We examined the spatiotemporal properties at a deeper level of
propofol anesthesia and in patients with DOC. Unlike in seda-
tion, there was an increase of MF and a decrease of temporal
autocorrelation during deep general anesthesia and DOC. These
results suggest that the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals be-
come globally shorter during deep general anesthesia and DOC.
What is the reason for this biphasic behavior of the intrinsic
timescales? Why are they longer during sedation but shorter dur-
ing deep general anesthesia and DOC compared with wakeful-
ness and recovery/emergence? We speculate that this biphasic (or
perhaps even multiphasic as seen in our previous animal study;
Liu et al., 2013b) phenomenon results from two consecutive
stages of functional alterations (Fig. 8). First, an increase of local/
regional synchrony breaks down global connectivity during light
to moderate sedation and, second, both local/regional synchrony
and global connectivity collapse at a high, surgical dose. The two
stages of functional alterations may be associated with distinct
behavioral signatures of anesthetic sedation and deep general
anesthesia. During sedation, subjects can respond purposefully,
albeit in a delayed manner, to verbal commands or to tactile stimu-
lation (Brown et al., 2011). This suggests that the sedated brain may
still preserve a certain capacity for global information integration
(partially preserved long-range functional connectivity), whereas
the processing of especially complex contents becomes slow and
inefficient (increase of temporal autocorrelation). In contrast, dur-
ing deep general anesthesia, the subjects are no longer arousable,
even by painful stimulation, indicating a profound collapse of local,
regional, and long-range functional interactions.
Last, it is noteworthy that the MF and AC1 values in DOC pa-
tients were between those in wakefulness and deep general anesthe-
sia,whereas the values for ReHo, GFC, and Topo in DOC patients
were indistinguishable from those during deep general anesthesia
(Fig. 7). If we assume that some of the DOC patients retained a
certain level of residual consciousness (based on the imprecision
of clinically differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome
from a minimally conscious state) or were at least in a state of
wakefulness (Laureys and Schiff, 2012; Kondziella et al., 2016)

Limitations
Several limitations of our study need to be considered. First, the
assessment of the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals in relation
to the TRWs (defined by cognitive tasks) representing the temporal
dimension of perception was indirect. The effect of the observed
prolongation of intrinsic timescales on behavior, perception, and
phenomenology during sedation remains to be established; for ex-
ample, whether the subject’s temporal perception is altered or their
“stream of consciousness” is fragmented. Second, despite exper-
imental validations of fMRI as a suitable method to probe the
hierarchy of TRWs (Hasson et al., 2008; Lerner et al., 2011; Ste-
phens et al., 2013), the temporal resolution of the fMRI-BOLD
signal is admittedly coarse to quantify the entire spectrum of TRWs,
particularly at the millisecond to subsecond timescales that are
nevertheless associated with important steps of sensory process-
ing. Third, sedation and deep general anesthesia were studied in
separate experiments. Therefore, we cannot determine whether
the biphasic behavior of intrinsic timescales was in part related to
the onset of anesthesia/speed of induction, although this is un-
likely given the equilibration time allowed before each scan. Last,
it remains to be determined whether our present results can be
generalized to other classes of anesthetics, including halogenated
ethers such as sevoflurane (amenable to study with fMRI) or
non-GABAergic drugs such as ketamine.
Conclusions
We demonstrate for the first time that sedation with propofol
synchronizeslocalneuronalinteractionsandprolongsthetimescales
of intrinsic BOLD signals. This in turn disrupts information ex-
change among distant brain regions. The intrinsic timescales have
distinct neural dynamic signatures in sedation, deep general anes-
thesia, and DOC. These results improve our understanding of the
neural mechanisms of unconsciousness in pharmacologic and neu-
ropathologic states.
