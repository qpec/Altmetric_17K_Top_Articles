An objective evaluation of patient performance status (PS) is difficult because patients spend the majority of their time outside of
the clinic, self-report to providers, and undergo dynamic changes throughout their treatment experience. Real-time, objective
activity data may allow for a more accurate assessment of PS and physical function, while reducing the subjectivity and bias
associated with current assessments. Consenting patients with advanced cancer wore a wearble activity monitor for three
consecutive visits in a prospective, single-cohort clinical trial. Provider-assessed PS (ECOG/Karnofsky) and NIH PROMIS® patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed at each visit. Associations between wearable activity monitor metrics (steps, distance,
stairs) and PS, clinical outcomes (adverse events, hospitalizations, survival), and PROs were assessed using correlation statistics and
in multivariable logistic regression models. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated (54% male, median 62 years). Patients averaged
3700 steps, 1.7 miles, and 3 flights of stairs per day. Highest correlations were observed between average daily steps and ECOG-PS
and KPS (r = 0.63 and r = 0.69, respectively p < 0.01). Each 1000 steps/day increase was associated with reduced odds for adverse
events (OR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.94), hospitalizations (OR: 0.21 95% CI 0.56, 0.79), and hazard for death (HR: 0.48 95% CI 0.28–0.83).
Significant correlations were also observed between activity metrics and PROs. Our trial demonstrates the feasibility of using
wearable activity monitors to assess PS in advanced cancer patients and suggests their potential use to predict clinical and patient-
reported outcomes. These findings should be validated in larger, randomized trials.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer patients require an accurate assessment of performance
status and physical function to inform treatment decisions and
determine eligibility into clinical trials. However, an objective
evaluation of physical function and performance status is difficult
because patients spend the majority of their time outside of the
clinic, self-report to providers, and undergo dynamic changes
throughout their treatment experience.
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance
Status (PS) (1960) and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)
(1949) are common scales used for assessing a patient’s level of
function and ability of self-care.1,2 Despite their routine use and
value in oncology, there are several limitations associated with
these scales. First, these scales are subjective and physician-
reported, thus leading to the potential for under- or over-
estimation of a patient’s performance status.3–5 For instance, a
physician’s intent to provide therapy or enroll a patient into a
clinical trial may inadvertently result in overestimation of physical
function and can further increase the patient’s risk for toxicities
and treatment intolerance.5 Conversely, an underestimation of
physical robustness may result in under treatment, which can
subsequently affect a patient’s clinical outcomes and quality of
life. Second, performance status assessment is limited by recall
bias where patients may not have a complete recollection of their
past activity and symptoms, which may be used to inform
performance status ratings.4 Recall may also be influenced by a
patient’s desire to enroll in a trial or receive therapy, thus resulting
in the over reporting of their physical activity levels and function.
A third challenge is the static nature of performance status
assessment, where ECOG-PS and KPS are only captured periodi-
cally during clinic visits. However, a patient’s performance status is
dynamic over the course of treatment and can change on a daily
basis.3 Finally, the quality and consistency of performance status
reporting in oncology is suboptimal and there can be disagree-
ments in performance status ratings between providers and
nurses.5–9
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) offer additional insight into a
patient’s daily activity, and have been shown to have a prognostic
and therapeutic value.9 The NIH PROMIS® scales are increasingly
recognized in oncology as capturing a broad range of relevant
outcomes that may not be recorded in the medical chart.9–12 Thus,
the routine collection of PROs has become an important
component to the assessment of a patient's treatment experi-
ence.9 However, as with all self-reported outcomes, PROs are
associated with the same response and recall biases and may
introduce additional burden related to the frequent administra-
tion and completion of the questionnaires.3,4 Given the prognostic
importance of performance status and PROs in addition to their
impact on treatment decisions, there is a need for feasible, real-
time, objective collection of a patient’s daily activity.3,4
Recent technological advances in wearable activity monitors
have made it possible to collect real-time, objective patient

 activity data in a non-obtrusive manner. Wearable activity
monitors measure the duration, intensity, and frequency of
physical activity and have previously been used in clinical settings
to motivate exercise and behavior.13–15 Consumer-based wearable
activity monitors, such as the Fitbit Charge HR® are relatively
inexpensive, simple devices that can be used to track physical
activity including step counts, stairs climbed, calories, heart rate,
and sleep.16–18 These will be referred to as activity metrics in this
report. While previous studies have used wearable activity
monitors for measuring adherence to a particular exercise
intervention, or to motivate physical activity, their application for
the assessment of patient functional and clinical outcomes has not
previously been reported.15
Our primary objective was to measure the association between
Fitbit Charge HR® activity metrics and performance status. We also
sought to measure the association between the wearable activity
metrics and survival, the occurrence of serious adverse events, as
well as the correlation between the wearable activity metrics and
PROs in the domains of pain, physical functioning, and fatigue.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Thirty-seven patients consented to the study. There were 20 males
and 17 females with a median age of 62 years (range 34–81)
(Table 1). At baseline, patients had provider-assessed ECOG-PS
scores of 0 (24%), 1 (35%), 2 (24%), or 3 (16%). The majority of
patients were diagnosed with gastrointestinal malignancies (n =
27) and had stage 4 disease (n = 34). There were two patients with
locally advanced stage 3 pancreatic disease and one patient with
stage 3B endocervical serous carcinoma. Compared to the
standard cancer population (mean 50, SD: 10), patients in this
study had lower levels of physical functioning by approximately
one standard deviation. Patients also reported higher levels of
pain and fatigue compared to the standard cancer population.
Fatigue, pain, and depression scores increased and reported sleep
quality and physical functioning decreased as ECOG-PS increased.
Additional patient baseline information is provided in Table 1.
Fitbit Charge HR® activity data are correlated with performance
status
On average, patients walked approximately 3700 steps, or 1.7
miles, per day, climbed three flights of stairs per day, and slept
8 h/night as measured with the wearable activity monitor. Average
resting heart rate was 68 beats per minute. Average daily step
counts were significantly different across ECOG-PS categories:
ECOG-PS 0, 5345 steps; ECOG-PS 1, 4835 steps, ECOG-PS 2,
1553 steps, ECOG-PS 3, 902 steps (p < 0.0001). Activity metrics
were correlated with ECOG-PS and KPS in the expected direction
and magnitude: as ECOG-PS increased from 0 (good PS) to 3–4
(poor PS), average daily steps, distance, and stairs decreased (Fig.
1a). An inverse relationship was observed between KPS and
average daily physical activity (Fig. 1b). The largest correlation
coefficients (r) were observed between average steps per day and
increasing ECOG-PS (r = 0.63, p < 0.01) and KPS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01).
Statistically significant correlations were also observed between
average distance travelled, stairs climbed, resting heart rate and
both ECOG-PS and KPS. No significant correlation between device-
assessed sleep duration and performance status was found.
Average patient activity over a 24 h period, sorted by ECOG-PS,
is displayed in Fig. 2. The heat map provides a visual account of
the variation in the average hourly activity of each patient,
including sleep and physical activity, where the intensity and
frequency of physical activity decreases as ECOG-PS worsens.

There were 11 deaths that occurred within 6-month follow-up.
There were 35 treatment-related grade 3+ adverse events
occurring in 13 patients (35%) within 30 days from the patient’s
end-of-study visit (Supplementary Table 3). Most adverse events
and hospitalizations occurred as a result of progressive disease,
treatment side-effects, or other disease-related symptoms. One
patient reported a mild rash on the wrist possibly related to the
study intervention (wearable activity monitor).

 An increase of 1000 steps per day, on average, was associated
with significantly lower odds of hospitalizations (OR: 0.21, 95% CI
0.56, 0.79), reduced grade 3 or 4 adverse events (OR: 0.34, 95% CI
0.13, 0.94), and increased survival (HR: 0.48, 95% CI 0.28, 0.83)
(Table 2) We also performed regressions for each of the outcomes
with steps and either KPS or ECOG included as predictors (data not
shown). The results suggest collinearity of predictors where steps
were stronger predictors of toxicity and hospitalizations while KPS
was a stronger predictor of survival. However, no consistent
pattern emerged from this analysis. Kaplan–Meier survival plots
are shown in Fig. 3. A median survival of approximately 2 months
was observed for patients who walked less than 1000 steps
per day, 5.5 months for patients walking between 1000 and
2000 steps, and the median was not attained in patients walking
>2500 steps. Stairs climbed were also associated with reduced
odds for the occurrence of toxicities and hospitalizations. Night-
time sleep duration was not associated with the occurrence of
adverse events or hospitalization but a statistically significant
association was observed with overall survival.
Wearable monitor activity data are correlated with PROs
PROs were completed at each visit using NIH PROMIS® scales:
physical functioning, fatigue, pain, sleep, and emotional well-
being. All 37 patients completed baseline PROMIS questionnaires
and 31 patients completed the PROMIS questionnaires at end-of-
study.

 ECOG-PS (r = 0.58), and KPS (r = 0.68) (p < 0.01 for both correla-
tions) (Table 3). Higher levels of patient-reported fatigue were also
significantly correlated with decreased step count (r = −0.53),
shorter distance walked (r = −0.51), and fewer stairs climbed (r =
−0.58). While patient-reported depression was not significantly
associated with step count, it was significantly correlated with
stairs climbed (r = 0.50), ECOG-PS (r = 0.58), and KPS (r = −0.67).
There were no significant correlations between reported sleep and
objectively measured sleep. Lower reported quality of sleep was
only significantly associated with poor ECOG-PS.
Reported feasibility and acceptance of the wearable activity
monitor
Step counts were the most reliable activity metrics to obtain from
patients where all 37 patients had recorded step counts that were
properly synced to their device. Heart rate and sleep data were
missing in three patients due to syncing errors or removal of
device during sleep. Based on individual patient responses in the
exit interview, patients described their participation in the study as
a positive experience and they considered the device easy to use,
unobtrusive, and motivating (Table 4). Common complaints
included: difficulty putting on and removing due to the style of
the band clasp, not being waterproof, and flashing green light
being distracting during sleep. Selected patient responses from
the exit interview are provided in Table 4.
DISCUSSION
We examined the use of a consumer-based, wearable activity
monitor to assess provider-assessed performance status, PROs,
and survival in advanced cancer patients. We found that the
wearable activity monitor was feasible for use, especially for the
estimation of step counts over a short period of time. The
statistically significant correlations observed between objectively
measured wearable activity data and validated performance status
scales, namely ECOG-PS and KPS, were consistent with our

•“It’s a motivator. You can’t lie about it, either you’re walking or not walking. Keeping a patient accountable. It makes you want
to. I think it helps you and makes you understand like on those days you’re not feeling well, I know I was sitting on the couch.
Gives you a good measure. You may want to try to walk around the house, or around the living room to get steps in and to help

 proposed hypothesis that the collection of wearable activity
monitor data could supplement clinical evaluation of performance
status. Importantly, the activity data suggested a trend for the
prediction of clinically relevant adverse events, 30-day morbidity,
and 6-month survival. We also observed correlations between
wearable activity monitor metrics and PROs including physical
functioning, pain, fatigue, and emotional distress.
Our findings provide new information regarding the use of an
emerging technology in cancer clinical settings. While other cancer
clinical trials have used wearable activity monitors (e.g., ped-
ometers, biosensors, accelerometers) for the objective measure-
ment of physical activity,14–16 the use of wearable activity monitors
to correlate with functional and clinical outcomes are only
beginning to be reported. As a result of the increase in use of
wearable activity monitors in clinical settings, there are new
oncology trials being developed or currently ongoing that are
exploring the use of biosensors with broader applications.15,19–23
One such study evaluated the feasibility of the Garmin fitness
tracker for predicting hospitalization in cancer patients undergoing
concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with curative
intent.23 Authors reported that patients walked on average
5103 steps per day and an increase in 1000 steps per day was
associated with a 38% reduction in risk for hospitalization. These
findings were consistent with our own and supported the
conclusion that objective activity monitoring in cancer patients is
feasible and may be used to predict clinical outcomes such as
hospitalization, although this would have to be explored in a larger
randomized trial. Clinical trials from other chronic disease areas,
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have also explored
the use for wearable activity monitors to track and obtain objective
measures of activity and reported their utility in a clinical setting.24–
26 Thus, while our findings are described within the context of
cancer clinical trials, the use of wearable activity monitors for the
assessment of physical function and outcome prediction can be
applied to broader healthcare settings.
Our findings have several implications for patients, providers,
and the public. While our results cannot definitively determine
whether activity monitor data can replace ECOG-PS or KPS
assessments, they do support their use as a supplement of
current functionality tools. Not only were step counts and other
activity metrics correlated with performance status, but they also
provided a more detailed and continuous account of the patients’
activity levels with the additional benefit of being recorded in the
patients’ free-living environments. Their use could also minimize
recall biases while removing burden associated with completing
multiple surveys and questionnaires in clinic.4,26,27 Of additional
importance is the possibility of combining objective activity
monitoring data with electronically recorded PROs for the purpose
of monitoring treatment tolerability and response in future clinical
trials. Furthermore, continuous activity monitoring during treat-
ment could help predict and monitor treatment complications
and allow for timely and appropriate intervention.23
Although limited by its small size and short duration, our trial
included participants of varying ECOG-PS and KPS ratings allowing
for activity estimates in each of the performance status categories.
The majority of our participants were diagnosed with advanced
pancreatic cancer disease. Thus, our patients tended to be sicker
with poorer prognosis than what we may expect in other cancer
groups. This also may explain the lower average PRO scores
compared to the standard cancer population and a higher
number of adverse events, hospitalizations, and deaths observed
during the short study period. While this may limit the general-
izability of our findings to healthier and earlier-stage cancer
patients and survivors, our findings address a current research gap
regarding the use of wearable activity monitors in sick and
advanced cancer population. Our population was relatively
homogeneous in terms of overall health and treatment schedules
adding confidence to our findings and allowing us to show
feasibility in a more advanced cancer population. Future studies
should enroll more patients from multiple disease sites and stages
to further generalize our findings to a broader cancer population.
Finally, while device validation will always be a challenge inherent
to the use of consumer-based wearable activity monitors in
research, the Fitbit Charge HR® has been validated for clinical use,
and the accuracy of all wearable activity monitors will continue to
improve over time.28–33
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the feasibility for use of a
wrist-worn, consumer-based activity monitor in advanced cancer
patients to objectively measure physical activity with the additional
purpose to supplement the measurement of clinical outcomes and
PROs. Given the rapid growth in the use of consumer-based fitness
monitors worldwide, these findings could also have a larger public
health impact with regard to prevention, control, and survivorship
programs. For instance, findings from future studies can lead to the
development of individualized treatment and exercise plans that
may ultimately result in increased treatment tolerability and
improved survival outcomes. There is opportunity to enhance
patient engagement and communication between patients and
providers, as well as motivate patients to monitor and improve
their daily activity. Next steps will include studying the longitudinal
use of consumer-based wearable activity monitors for clinical
outcome measurement and prediction in a randomized, controlled
setting across multiple cancer groups.
METHODS
Study population
Eligible patients were 18 years or older, diagnosed with an advanced solid
malignancy (Stage 4 or unresectable advanced Stage 3 cancer) with
measurable disease and were treated at a single institution. Patients were
required to be ambulatory, but permitted to use walking aids (e.g., cane,
crutch) and needed access to a smartphone (personal ownership, family
member, friend, or hospital iPad operated by study staff). Patients were
excluded if they had a history of allergic reactions to surgical steel or
elastomer/rubber or if they had pacemakers and other implantable devices
as a safety precaution.
Study design
We conducted a prospective, single-center, single-cohort trial evaluating
the utility of the Fitbit Charge HR® to measure daily activity in advanced
cancer patients. The FitBit Charge HR® was selected as it was one of the
most popular and inexpensive consumer-based devices during the time
the study was designed and is compatible with most smartphones
including the Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Androids and other tablets. It
is also water-resistant and has a charge capacity that lasts between 3 and
5 days. Patients were seen in clinic for three consecutive clinic visits
(baseline, mid-study, end-of-study), which were no longer than 4 weeks
apart (Supplementary Table 2). The trial did not interfere with the patients’
treatment schedules or participation in other trials. Mid-study and end-of-
study visits were associated with a 7-day activity period preceding each
clinic visit with a total duration of Fitbit activity time of 14 days (2 weeks).
Recruitment duration was 1 year and patients were followed for survival
for 6 months. The study was completed in August 2017.
Assessments
All assessments were completed after receiving Research Ethics Board
approval and investigators obtained consent from each participant.
Consenting patients were provided with a Fitbit Charge HR® and instructed
to wear it continuously for the duration of their study period, removing
only during showering/bathing/swimming.16,17 At each visit, patients
completed the NIH PROMIS® questionnaires, and oncologists and nurses
independently rated the participants’ ECOG-PS and KPS. The attending
oncologist performed a physical exam, collected medical and treatment
history, and assessed for AEs.
Fitbit Charge HR® activity outcomes were transmitted through cloud
technology to the patient’s mobile device in real-time. We used Fitabase,
an online research platform used to manage the multiple Fitbit accounts,
to export activity data.18

 Study objectives and outcome measures
The

objective
was
to
measure
the
association
between
performance status as assessed using ECOG-PS by the oncologist and
average daily step counts as measured using a wearable activity monitor
over a 2-week period. We also evaluated the association between
Karnofsky performance status and daily step counts as it is equally used
in the oncology setting. Secondary objectives included measuring the
association between (1) step count and the occurrence of clinical
outcomes (survival, adverse events, and hospitalization) and (2) between
step count and NIH PROMIS® t-scores for pain, sleep, physical functioning,
fatigue, and depression. We performed exploratory analyses of the
associations between additional activity metrics (stairs climbed, sleep,
heart rate) and clinical outcomes of interest.
Performance status
ECOG-PS (range 0–4) and KPS (range 0–100) were rated at each clinic visit
independently by the attending oncologist and nurse. Increasing ECOG-PS
on the numerical scale is indicative of worsening performance while
increasing KPS is associated with improved performance. A description of
ECOG-PS and KPS ratings and their conversion is included in Supplemen-
tary Table 1.
Clinical outcomes
Survival status was assessed at 6 months from end-of-study visit and the
occurrence of hospitalizations and grade 3/4 adverse events (CTCAE v 4.03)
were measured within 30 days. We also recorded any adverse events
related to the wearable activity monitor during the study period. Clinical
outcomes were analyzed as binary variables.

score, which can subsequently be converted to a t-score using the NIH
PROMIS® toolbox. The PROMIS t-scores are normalized and calibrated
against a US cancer population with a mean of 50, and standard deviation
of 10, making it possible to compare with our own results.12,13
Standardized t-scores for each domain were analyzed as continuous
variables.
Other variables of interest
Patient demographics, medical history, and comorbidities were collected
during the baseline visit. Patient weight, heart rate, and blood pressure
were also evaluated at each visit, as measured in the clinic by the practice
nurse.
Statistical methods
The intended size of the study was based on the expected association
between provider-assessed ECOG-PS and average daily step counts with
an estimated 5000 steps per day and standard deviation of 3300 steps
across four ECOG categories.34 After accounting for dropout and missing
data, a sample size of 30 was required with 80% power and a type I error
rate of 0.05.
Activity monitor data were coded as missing if both heart rate data and
steps data were equal to 0. Patients were included in the analysis for the
primary and secondary outcomes if at least four valid days of activity data
were available. Baseline data and PROs were collected and reported for all
participating patients.
Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate
relationships between activity metrics, ECOG-PS/KPS ratings, and NIH
PROMIS® t-scores. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate
the associations between performance status (ECOG-PS, KPS) and wearable
activity monitor metrics. Logistic regression models were used for binary
outcomes, and linear regression models were used for continuous
outcome variables. Models were adjusted for the potential confounding
effects of age and sex. To account for the longitudinal measurements,
marginal models were employed using generalized estimated equations
with an exchangeable correlation structure under the assumption that
observations would not vary substantially between visits.
Time-to-event analyses were conducted to evaluate the association
between activity measures and 6-month survival and Kaplan–Meier plots
were generated. Step counts were categorized into 1000-step increments.
Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were also used to
evaluate the independent effects of activity data on risk of death. Hazard
ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed for each
metric, and adjusted for the potential confounding effects of age and sex.
All analyses were performed using Stata (Stata Corp, v 14.0).
