Objective: To determine whether paper tape prevents foot blisters
in multistage ultramarathon runners.
Design: Multisite prospective randomized trial.
Setting: The 2014 250-km (155-mile) 6-stage RacingThePlanet
ultramarathons in Jordan, Gobi, Madagascar, and Atacama Deserts.
Participants:
One
hundred
twenty-eight
participants
were
enrolled: 19 (15%) from the Jordan, 35 (27%) from Gobi, 21
(16%) from Madagascar, and 53 (41%) from the Atacama Desert.
The mean age was 39.3 years (22-63) and body mass index was 24.2
kg/m2 (17.4-35.1), with 31 (22.5%) females.
Interventions: Paper tape was applied to a randomly selected foot
before the race, either to participants’ blister-prone areas or randomly
selected location if there was no blister history, with untaped areas of
the same foot used as the control.
Main Outcome Measures: Development of a blister anywhere
on the study foot.
Results: One hundred six (83%) participants developed 117
blisters, with treatment success in 98 (77%) runners. Paper tape
reduced blisters by 40% (P , 0.01, 95% confidence interval, 28-52)
with a number needed to treat of 1.31. Most of the study participants
had 1 blister (78%), with most common locations on the toes (n = 58,
50%) and heel (n = 27, 23%), with 94 (80%) blisters occurring by the
end of stage 2. Treatment success was associated with earlier stages
[odds ratio (OR), 74.9, P , 0.01] and time spent running (OR, 0.66,
P = 0.01).
Conclusion: Paper tape was found to prevent both the incidence
and frequency of foot blisters in runners.

INTRODUCTION
Friction foot blisters are one of the most common
injuries encountered in hikers, runners, and endurance
athletes.1 Although most are of minor medical significance,
they can impair concentration, decrease athletic performance
and enjoyment, and be potentially debilitating. Blister rates in
the outdoor community range from 54% of backpackers to
64% of long-distance hikers.2,3 Blister incidence in marathons
has been reported as high as 39%4 and 76% to 100% in
multistage ultramarathon runners.5,6 Foot blisters have been
the most commonly reported injury in adventure racing7 and
are the most common factor that adversely affects perfor-
mance in single-stage ultramarathon finishers.8 Foot care ac-
counts for 20% of all medical visits in marathons9–12 and up
to 76% of medical visits in multistage ultramarathons.13,14 In
addition to sports and outdoor recreationalists, blister preven-
tion is a problem in both training and active duty military
personnel. Studies report blister rates of 48% to 65% after
short marches15,16 in 57% of trainees17 and 33% during a 12-
month period of deployment.18 Furthermore, 84% of cellulitis
in military recruits was caused by blisters, with an average
loss of 8 training days per case.19 Sixteen percent to 22% of
those affected with blisters received temporary duty restric-
tions, which may impact troop readiness.20 There is currently
no proven efficacious technique for blister prevention.
Blister injury arises from friction between the skin and
another object.21–23 The skin surface is subjected to normal
forces (Fn), the perpendicular force or “force of contact,” and
tangential shear forces.24 When an external force is applied at

 the skin interface, small irregularities create an opposing fric-
tional force (Ff), which prevents sliding across the skin.23,25
The magnitude of a frictional force is defined by the formula:
Ff = m · Fn, where m is the coefficient of friction or ratio of
shear force to normal force.25 When external forces exceed
the opposing frictional force, movement occurs at the skin
surface interface
and shear stress extends horizontally
between the skin layers.26 Repeated sliding at a friction point
causes exfoliation of the stratum corneum with development
of erythema and a sensation of warmth, the “hot spot.”23,24
Continued friction causes delamination between the cells of
the stratum spinosum, and a cleft forms that then fills with
a low-protein transudate resulting in a blister.21,24,27,28
Despite extensive studies on the impact of shear forces
on blister development, there has been scant research on the
efficacy of various blister prevention modalities (eg, powders,
antiperspirants, lubricants, tapes, or adhesive pads). In our
previous blister prevention study in multistage ultramarathon
runners (Pre-TAPED), we found that paper tape applied to the
majority of common blister-prone areas of one foot compared
with the other untaped foot was not efficacious.6 As paper
tape was well tolerated and 84% of the study participants
would choose to use it again for blister prevention, we
believed that the study’s methodology limited insight into
the reduced shear-stress area under the tape itself compared
with the surrounding skin, and subsequently may have under-
estimated the effectiveness of paper tape. Therefore, we
wanted to investigate the individual’s blister-sensitive areas
with focal preventive taping. The objective of this study was
to examine whether paper tape could prevent hot spots and
blisters on specific blister-prone areas in multistage ultramar-
athon runners.
METHODS
Setting and Selection of Participants
This randomized, prospective cohort trial was under-
taken during the 2014 RacingThePlanet 250-km (155-mile),
6-stage, ultramarathon foot races through the Gobi Desert in
China, Atacama Desert of Chile, Jordan, and Madagascar
Deserts. These races had 4 consecutive 25 mile (40 km) days,
a combined fifth and sixth day of 50 miles (80 km), and
finished with a 5 to 6 mile (10 km) day. Participants carried
their own equipment for the duration of the race, including
a minimum of 2000 calories per day and were offered 1.5 L of
water per 6 to 7 miles (10-12 km). As each race had similar
distances and logistical demands, the cohorts were combined
for analysis. Approval was obtained from the institutional
review boards of Stanford University School of Medicine and
Resurrection Medical Center. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01945112.
Research Design
All English-understanding race competitors were pro-
vided the opportunity to enroll at race registration the day
before the race start, and informed consent was obtained
before completing a demographics questionnaire. Exclusion
criteria were any blister or hot spot on either foot at the time
of enrollment or an allergy to paper tape. Each participant had
an intervention foot randomized by coin toss (with the
opposite foot not studied). Paper tape was applied by medical
staff trained in application procedures described by study
manual and on-site researcher the evening before the first day
of racing. The intervention foot was dried and brushed clean
of residual grit, then covered with 2.5-cm (1-inch) 3M

 Micropore™ paper tape (3M, St Paul, Minnesota) at the par-
ticipant’s blister-prone area(s) (directed application). If the
study participant was not susceptible to blisters, 1 randomly
selected area was chosen (undirected application) based on the
most common blister locations: a toe, instep (head of the first
metatarsal), outstep (head of the fifth metatarsal), or the heel
(calcaneal tuberosity).5,6 Toes were taped with a 1.3- to 2.5-cm
(0.5- to 1-inch)-wide longitudinal strip of tape applied along
the dorsum and plantar aspects that covered the distal phalanx
and nail bed. Another piece of tape was applied circumferen-
tially around each toe at the distal phalanx, with the cut ends of
the tape located on the dorsum of the toe. The width of the tape
size depended on adequate coverage based on a subject’s toe
size. The first and fifth metatarsal heads were taped with a 5.1-
cm (2-inch)-wide strip perpendicular to the foot axis, and the
heel was taped with a 5.1-cm (2-inch)-wide horizontal piece of
paper tape covering the calcaneal tuberosity (Figure 1). Tape
corners were smoothed flat. After the initial application of tape,
either the participant or medical personnel could reapply tape at
any time on the course or at the medical tent as necessary for
the duration of the study. The study end point was the devel-
opment of a hot spot or blister (described as “blister”) any-
where on the randomly chosen foot, with the uncovered
portion of the same foot serving as the control. When the study
end point was reached, an exit questionnaire was completed.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was calculated to achieve 80% power
(a = 0.05, 2-tailed test). Based on our previous work with
paper tape in similar races, we assumed that a single foot
would have a blister rate of at least 35%.6 A total of 82
participants were required to detect a significant difference,
defined a priori as a reduction in blister incidence of 25%.
Outcome measures were analyzed by the x2 test and indepen-
dent samples t test, with independent predictors of the number
of blisters analyzed by analysis of variance and logistic
regression for treatment success (defined as no blister devel-
opment underneath the paper tape). Time-adjusted incidence
[incidence density rate (IDR)] of the outcome measure was
calculated by stage times of blister occurrence, and partici-
pants’ performance was analyzed per quintile of finishers (eg,
.10%, .10%-25%, .25%-50%, .50%-75%, .75%). P ,
0.05 was considered significant. All analysis was done with R
statistical computation software version 3.1.1.
RESULTS
One hundred twenty-eight participants were enrolled,
with 19 (15%) participants from the Jordan, 35 (27%) from
Gobi, 21 (16%) from Madagascar, and 53 (41%) from the
Atacama Desert. Table 1 describes the characteristics of the
study cohort, and the participant flow diagram is shown in
Figure 2. For all study participants, there were a total of 240
applications of paper tape (Table 2), with a total of 117 blis-
ters that occurred in the locations described in Table 3, most
commonly on the toes. The majority of participants developed
1 blister (Table 4), with 94 (80%) of all blisters occurring by
the end of stage 2 (Figure 3).

 A total of 109 (85%) participants were compliant with
the study protocol, with 6 reasons for noncompliance found
in 19 participants; the most common being lack of adhesion
(n = 10, 53%). In those compliant with the protocol, there
were 97 blisters (89%), 28 (26%) blisters under the paper
tape, and 74 (68%) on the untaped areas. Blisters occurred at
uncovered areas rather than underneath the paper tape in 81
(74%) runners. The blister incidence and treatment success
per race location is described in Table 5. Intent-to-treat anal-
ysis of the 128 enrolled participants found that 106 (83%)
developed blisters, with treatment success in 98 (77%) run-
ners. Paper tape had an absolute reduction of blister inci-
dence of 40%, with a number needed to treat of 1.31. There
was similar statistical significance observed in both the pro-
tocol compliant and noncompliant groups (Table 6). Of the
97 (89%) who had directed application of paper tape, there
were 89 (92%) blisters, a treatment success in 70 (72%),
with a statistically significant reduction in blister incidence
in the taped versus untaped area [P , 0.01, 95% confidence
interval (CI), 27-55].
Exploratory logistic regression modeling showed that
the stage of race was the best predictor of treatment success
[odds ratio (OR), 74.9, P # 0.01, 95% CI, 4.7-3277.7], fol-
lowed by time spent racing (OR, 0.66, P = 0.01, 95% CI, 0.5-
0.9) (Figure 4) and opposite dominant handedness (relative to
which foot was taped) (OR, 3.7, P = 0.05, 95% CI, 1.1-15.2).
Variables that were not statistically associated with treatment
success included height, age, sex, weight, pack weight, body
mass index (BMI), and race performance.
Multiple linear regression and analysis of variance were
used to test correlation between the number of blisters and
BMI, performance, pack weight, age, and race stage. Stage of
race was most strongly correlated (P , 0.01, R2 = 0.17).
Normalizing for time spent racing, analysis of variance of
the number of blisters per hour shows the strongest relation-
ship for race location (P , 0.01, R2 = 0.19) and whether tape
was reapplied (P , 0.01, R2 = 0.07). Factors that did not have
a significant association with the number of blisters included
age, weight, sex, BMI, use of Injinji socks (San Diego, CA),
and pack weight.
DISCUSSION
We found that paper tape had a robust protective effect
on blister formation on runners’ feet in multistage ultramar-
athons. Paper tape is an inexpensive, readily available, and
easy-to-apply intervention that prevented blisters in approxi-
mately 3-quarters of the people who applied it. This study was
the first to show that a simple adhesive tape can prevent foot
blisters.
Blisters may lead to pain and inability to complete
a race, with 6% to 16% of nonfinishers of ultraendurance
events citing blisters as the primary reason for withdraw-
ing.7,13 These rates of nonfinishers due to blisters may be an
underestimation because the pain associated with blisters may
lead to a modified gait, which can exacerbate underlying in-
juries.5,29 Runners citing sprains or muscle injuries as reasons
for withdrawal may in fact have blisters that are worsening
these injuries. Military trainees with blisters were found to
have a higher incidence of overuse injuries, particularly to
their knees and ankles,17,19 and those with blisters were
50% more likely to experience additional injuries.21
Prospective studies on blister reduction often examined
strategies to decrease friction between the skin and other
objects,21,23,30 because the magnitude of the Ff is the major
factor found to contribute to blister formation.24 Despite over
40 years of clinical trials on blisters, multiple interventions
have not provided a solution to this “enemy of the feet.”
Petroleum jelly was found to increase friction and subsequent
blister formation an hour after application.24 Application of an
emollient combined with antiperspirant was not shown to
reduce blister incidence,31 another attempt with antiperspirant
alone was more successful,15 but the excessive irritation in the
majority of study subjects has discouraged use except in cases
of hyperhidrosis.15,32,33 A comparison of common blister pre-
vention bandages (eg, Band-Aid, Moleskin, New-Skin,
Compeed, Tegaderm) and a proprietary adhesive bandage
Blist-O-Ban (Seaberg Company Inc, Newport, OR) found
the lowest coefficient of friction in the adhesive pad34; how-
ever, paper tape was not included for comparison. Paper tape
has a lower profile than that of most of these commercially
available products, with the added advantage of affordability
and ease of application to the toes and intertriginous areas.
There was high user satisfaction of paper tape in this study,
with 81% of compliant study participants who “agreed” or
“strongly agreed” (on a 5-point Likert scale) to use paper tape
for blister prevention in the future.
Previous ultramarathon studies have found that the
most common location for blisters is the toes, accounting for

 52% to 65% of encountered blisters.5,6 This locational trend
was confirmed in this study with toes representing 56% of
pretaped areas, and 50% of blisters occurring on the toes.
Increased blister rates on the toes may be due to the greater
contact time of this area of the plantar surface, with blister-
prone individuals found to have significantly increased pres-
sure and magnitudes of shear stress.35 Paper tape is uniquely
suited to protect these
blister-prone areas
as its soft
surface minimizes abrasion and friction blister development
to the neighboring toes.36
Contrary to the findings of our smaller previous study,6
there was no correlation with blisters and Injinji socks, likely
because those who wore these toe-separated socks did not get
blisters at that location, so chose not to directly apply paper
tape to the toes. Injinji socks are popular among ultraendur-
ance runners, used by 45% (n = 49) of our compliant study
participants Although we did not see significant correlation
with toe blisters and Injinjis, it seems reasonable to avoid the
use of paper tape on the toes with Injinji socks.
Feet of ultramarathon runners are exposed to heat,
moisture, and repetitive activity for extended periods of time.
The number of times a frictional stress is applied has been
shown to increase blister rates.24 By analysis of IDR, we
found that those who developed a blister under the tape (treat-
ment failure) encountered it early in the race, whereas those
who had treatment success had blisters developing apprecia-
bly later in the race in the noncovered locations. Figure 4
supports the efficacy of paper tape for blister prevention. This
intervention likely minimized the shear stress at the blister
vulnerable areas, as these areas have been found to have
a 50% increase in shear time integral values compared with
nonblistered sites.35
Of the compliant participants, there were 47 people
(43%) who reapplied tape a total of 121 times. The need for
tape reapplication was associated with an increased number of
blisters, although not with treatment success or failure. It
stands to reason that race locations (such as Madagascar and
the Gobi) with wetter courses may have led to treatment
failure by poor tape adhesion as seen by the lowest success
rates. These wet conditions are also more apt to contribute to
increased blister formation, represented by the greater number
of blisters encountered. Repetitive rubbing on moist skin
produces higher Ff than on dry or very wet skin.21,23,27 Wetter
environments likely increased the need for frequent reappli-
cations, possibly minimizing the overall benefit of paper tape.
Although the most common reason for protocol noncompli-
ance was the lack of tape adhesion, there is a benefit of the
weak adhesive qualities of paper tape in that it minimizes the
possibility of unroofing a blister upon its removal. The intact
superficial epidermal cells of the stratum corneum and
stratum granulosum form the blister’s “roof.” In blister

 prevention and treatment, the maintenance of the roof’s integ-
rity optimizes healing rates,28 which highlights the utility of
paper tape for dermatologic maintenance.
There are multiple variables at play over a 155-mile
6-stage ultramarathon that may have an effect on blister
incidence and the success of a prophylactic. There was wide
variation in treatment success between the study sites, which
may be a reflection of these factors, but interrace conclu-
sions are limited by combination of the cohort for study
power. Interrace data were combined for the analysis as each
race had similar design, length, and logistical demands; as
the environmental and race conditions varied between the
study locations, this assumption may have led to disparate
results. However, our cohort grouping was similar to
multiple studies that have combined athletes from different
races for analysis.6,8,38
The Pre-TAPED II study methodology examined the
areas at highest risk for blister development unique to each
runner on 1 randomly assigned foot. The study participants
directed 92% of the taped areas. Although the larger surface
area of the foot that was untaped may have biased the results
toward a positive study outcome, the historical predilection of
blister development in these taped areas offered greatest
protection and thus provided us maximal insight into
intervention efficacy.39
Participants were not blinded to outcomes, as the end-
of-study data collection was by self-reported questionnaire.
This was logistically unavoidable. Although all study partic-
ipants were requested to avoid taping the study foot, we could
not standardize other foot care interventions that could
possibly have led to unknown variables affecting outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrated than an inexpensive and easy-to-
apply adhesive tape prevented foot blisters in runners. Foot
care represents a substantial burden on medical teams at these
races, and blisters cause significant discomfort to athletes,
