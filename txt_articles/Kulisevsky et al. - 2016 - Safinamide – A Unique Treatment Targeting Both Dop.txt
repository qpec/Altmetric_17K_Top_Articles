opaminergic replacement therapies are prescribed widely to improve motor problems in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, as the 
disease progresses, the response to levodopa (l-dopa) doses becomes shorter and patients experience symptom recurrence at 
the end of the dose effect. These so-called OFF periods may become refractory to treatment, and may become associated with 
disabling motor fluctuations or dyskinesias. In addition to dopamine, glutamate excitotoxicity, resulting from disturbance of the homeostatic 
balance of neurotransmitters and elevated extracellular levels of glutamate, is potentially an important therapeutic target. Safinamide has 
been investigated in phase III clinical trials as adjunct therapy to l-dopa in mid- to late-stage fluctuating PD. Adding safinamide to l-dopa 
increases the time patients’ symptoms are controlled – so-called ON time, without increasing troublesome dyskinesia. Although safinamide 
has dopaminergic actions, recent data have suggested that the long-term effects of safinamide on dyskinesia are related to safinamide 
state- and use-dependent inhibition of sodium channels and stimulated glutamate release, rather than reduced dopaminergic stimulation. 
Safinamide’s unique dual mechanism of action makes it a valuable treatment option for fluctuating PD patients.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with a prevalence that 
increases with age: 41 in 100,000 in the age group 40–49, rising to 1,903 in 100,000 in those aged 
over 80 years.1 PD is characterised by striatal dopamine deficiency resulting from progressive 
degeneration of dopaminergic cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, the brain region 
responsible for motor control.2 Symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait and 
postural abnormalities, and speech difficulty,3 as well as non-motor symptoms including cognitive 
dysfunction, mood disorders, sleep disturbance and pain.4 
Although PD is incurable, symptoms can be alleviated using dopaminergic therapies including 
the dopamine precursor levodopa (l-dopa), dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B 
inhibitors that block dopamine degradation, thereby helping restore dopamine levels in the 
brain.5,6 L-dopa is currently the standard treatment for motor symptoms in PD, but its long-term 
use has important limitations.5 As the disease progresses, the response to l-dopa doses becomes 
shorter and patients motor fluctuations, which involve periods of being ON, during which the 
patient experiences a positive response to medication, and being OFF
, during which the patient 
experiences a re-emergence of the symptoms suppressed during the ON state.7,8 Furthermore, 
symptoms of PD, including gait and tremor, gradually become resistant to l-dopa.8 Other limitations 
of the use of l-dopa include the fact that it does not prevent PD progression,9 and many non-motor 
symptoms do not respond well to l-dopa.9 
As well as motor fluctuations, abnormal involuntary movements, known as l-dopa-induced 
dyskinesia (LID), develop with prolonged use of l-dopa; these may occur at peak effect of l-dopa, 
at the beginning and end of dose, or between doses (see Figure 1).8,10–12 These movements usually 
involve the face and the side of the body that is initially affected by the disease, but they commonly 
progress and affect the neck, upper and lower limbs, and body axis. Chorea and dystonia are the 
most frequent forms of LIDs, but ballismus and myoclonus can also appear.13,14 Around 40% of 
patients experience motor fluctuations and LID after 4-6 years of treatment with l-dopa,14 and 60% 
to 100% may experience LID after 10 years.15,16
Motor fluctuations are the result of alterations of the functional organisation of the basal ganglia 
circuitry following long-term exposure to l-dopa. Progressive degeneration of the nigro-striatal 
dopaminergic pathway reduces the ability of nerve terminals to store and release dopamine.17 
As a result of this loss of storage capacity, l-dopa induces a more pulsatile stimulation of 
postsynaptic dopamine receptors, consistent with l-dopa’s short (90-minute) half-life and its 
rapid cycling pharmacokinetics. This pulsatile stimulation causes functional changes within the 
basal ganglia, leading to involuntary movements and altered neural activity in the basal ganglia, 
thalamus cerebral cortex.17

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Review  Parkinson’s Disease
Several risk factors are associated with the development of LID, 
including increased body weight,18 age of onset and severity of PD,19 
higher dose and longer duration of l-dopa therapy.8,19 Dyskinesias are 
associated with substantially decreased quality of life (QoL) for both 
patients and caregivers, and create an additional burden on healthcare 
systems as they require increased monitoring and complex medical 
management.8,20 Moreover, as LIDs worsen, they lead to increased risk 
of injury, exhaustion and fatigue.8 
Patients with motor fluctuations often require add-on therapies, many 
of which improve motor fluctuations, but exacerbate dyskinesia.21 The 
current recommended treatment for dyskinesia is the non-selective 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist amantadine,22 but 
its effects are modest and short in duration. Moreover, it is associated 
with poor tolerance and adverse effects including hallucinations, 
leg oedema and livedo reticularis, requiring careful monitoring.2,23 
Clozapine, a high-affinity serotoninergic agonist used to treat psychosis 
in PD, has also been found to reduce LID24 but it is associated with 
severe adverse effects,25,26 that limit its use in this indication. Non-oral 
treatment includes continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion,27 
levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel28 and transdermal rotigotine 
therapy.29 Deep-brain stimulation may help improve motor fluctuations 
and dyskinesia in advanced PD.30
In a 2009 survey, better treatments for motor symptoms were 
emphasised as a major unmet need in PD therapy.31 Fluctuating response 
to treatment is the most troublesome motor symptom reported by PD 
patients.32 There is therefore an unmet need for additional therapeutic 
options in fluctuating PD patients.
Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying 
dyskinesias in Parkinson’s disease
While the pathogenesis of motor fluctuations has not been fully 
elucidated, in vitro studies suggest that other neurotransmitters in the 
brain, including glutamate, adenosine and serotonin are involved in 
the control of motor symptoms and the development of dyskinesia.11 
Glutamate plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PD. The dendritic 
spines of striatal medium-sized gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-
ergic neurons exhibit both dopamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptors and receive both cortical–striatal glutamatergic 
projections and nigrostriatal dopaminergic fibres.33 Excessive oxidative 
stress in the substantia nigra pars compacta results in a reduction in 
the capacity of nigral neurons to cope with metabolic demands and 
the development of susceptibility to the effects of glutamate. Under 
conditions of impaired cellular energy metabolism, glutamate acts 
as a neurotoxin, causing degeneration of nigral neurons followed by 
striatal dopaminergic denervation.33 This leads to a pathophysiological 
 
cascade of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MTMP)-induced 
neuronal cell death.34 The loss of dopamine neurons is believed to cause 
an increase in glutamatergic activity in the basal ganglia.35 This activates 
the striatopallidal pathway, inhibiting outputs of the basal ganglia and 
resulting in dyskinesia.36 Glutamate excitotoxicity is therefore potentially 
an important therapeutic target.37 Targeting non-dopaminergic systems 
provides complementary approach that may improve and control motor 
complications, while maintaining the efficacy of l-dopa.38
The use of safnamide in Parkinson’s disease
Safinamide (Xadago®, Zambon, Bresso, Italy) is a novel α-aminoamide 
with a unique multi-modal mechanism of action distinct from 
that of amantadine.39 It has antiparkinsonian, anticonvulsant and 
neuroprotective properties. Safinamide offers a unique approach to the 
management of motor symptoms and motor fluctuation/dyskinesia due 
to its unique dual mechanism of action (see Figure 2). Safinamide has 
dopaminergic mechanisms of action, including selective and reversible 
MAO-B and dopamine reuptake inhibition, which are largely responsible 
for its effects on motor symptoms.39–41 However, it also has non-
dopaminergic mechanisms of action. It suppresses repetitive firing by use- 
and state-dependent sodium channel blockade that in turn decreases 
calcium channel opening, and reduces excessive release from synaptic 
terminals of glutamate.42 In this glutamatergic mechanism of action, 
safinamide differs from amantadine and memantine; it has an indirect 
effect on glutamate release through sodium channels blockade, whereas 
amantadine and memantine have a direct effect due to NMDA receptor 
antagonism.39,43,44 It must be stressed that safinamide has a multimodal 
action and is not a pure antidyskinetic drug. In addition, safinamide has 
no effect on l-type calcium channels, and therefore does not affect 
 
blood pressure or heart rate.45

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
Safinamide – A Unique Treatment Targeting Both Dopaminergic and Non-Dopaminergic Systems
Studies investigating safinamide’s anticonvulsant properties in rat brain 
membranes showed that safinamide has high affinity for binding site 2 of 
the sodium channel receptor and exerts its actions through the inhibition 
of sodium and calcium channels, stabilising neuronal membrane 
excitability and inhibiting transmitter release.46 A higher number of 
sodium channels are therefore kept in the inactivated state. In another 
animal study, the sodium channel opener, veratridine, was administered 
for 30 minutes to induce a rapid and transient increased glutamate 
release in the rat hippocampus. Safinamide inhibited glutamate release 
without affecting basal glutamate release.47 
This non-dopaminergic mechanism of action of safinamide might be 
important in terms of the effects of the drug on motor complications. In 
a study of a primate model, both safinamide and amantadine reduced 
LID but only safinamide increased the duration of response of l-dopa.48 
These effects cannot be accounted only for by MAO-B inhibition, since 
the latter is associated with worsening rather than improvement of LID. 
The authors concluded that this finding might be related to a reduction 
in cortical and/or thalamic excitatory inputs resulting from reduced 
presynaptic glutamate release due to the blockade of voltage-gated 
sodium channels.
Safinamide has emerged as a useful add-on therapy for l-dopa following 
the findings of three phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials of patients with mid-to late-
stage PD and motor fluctuations: trials 016, 018 and SETTLE (Safinamide 
in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease With Motor Fluctuations, as add-on to 
Levodopa).49–51 In all studies, treatment with safinamide at daily doses of 
50–100 mg (studies 016 and 018) or 100 mg (SETTLE) for 24 weeks (studies 
016 and SETTLE) or 2 years (study 018) as add-on to l-dopa (alone or with 
other anti-parkinson drugs) increased daily ON time without dyskinesia, 
as assessed by Hauser patient diaries (see Table 1).51 The dose of l-dopa 
remained stable in the majority of patients. 
In study 016 (n=669), there were significant differences in the mean 
change in ON time without dyskinesia versus placebo in both the 
safinamide 50 mg (0.51 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07–0.94; 
p=0.0223) and the safinamide 100 mg (0.55 hours; 95 % CI 0.12–0.99; 
p=0.0130) groups. Both safinamide doses did not increase troublesome 
dyskinesia despite the significant increase in ON time. There were also 
significant improvements in OFF time and Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale (UPDRS)-III (motor) scores. In the 100 mg dosage group there 
were significant increases in UPDRS-II (activities of daily living) scores, 
Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) total score (p=0.0360) and 
subscale scores for emotional wellbeing (p=0.0116), communication 
(p=0.0361), and bodily discomfort. Differences from placebo in ON and 
OFF time were significant for both doses (p=0.0159) from the first post-
baseline evaluation (week 4) onward.49 
Of the patients enrolled in study 016, 81% (n=544) continued into an 
18-month extension study (study 018).50 Inclusion criteria for continuation 
were compliance with treatment and willingness to continue, or 
discontinuation but completion of the scheduled efficacy evaluations 
at weeks 12 and 24. Patients were excluded if they had experienced 
clinically significant adverse events (AEs) or shown clinically significant 
deterioration in motor symptoms during study 016. The primary endpoint 
was the change from baseline in Dyskinesia Rating Scale (DRS) total 
score during ON time over 24 months. The improvements in ON time 
without dyskinesia seen at six months in study 016 were maintained up 
to two years in study 018, as well as the improvements in OFF time and 
in motor scores. Although there was no overall difference in dyskinesias 
between patients and controls, improvement in dyskinesia compared 
with placebo (p=0.0317) was seen in patients at least moderately 
dyskinetic (36% of patients) at baseline.50
In the SETTLE study (n=552), as early as week 2 (first post-baseline 
assessment), a significant increase in median ON time without dyskinesia

and OFF time of one hour was observed for safinamide (50 mg/day) 
compared with 30 minutes for placebo.51 At week 24, the change 
from baseline to 24 weeks in daily ON time with no/non-troublesome 
dyskinesia was significantly different for safinamide 100 mg/day versus 
placebo (0.96 hours; 95% CI 0.56–1.37; p<0.001). Safinamide also 
significantly improved UPDRS-III score, Clinical Global Impression of 
Severity (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), the 39-item 
 
PDQ-39, and OFF time following the first morning l-dopa dose (i.e., 
latency to ON) compared to placebo. In addition, a significantly higher 
proportion of patients achieved improvements of at least one hour in 
motor fluctuations and a percentage of improvement of 30% and more 
in motor symptoms, a clinically meaningful benefit.52
Safinamide was well tolerated in these studies. Common adverse effects 
(reported in ≥5% of patients) included worsening of PD, cataract, back 
pain, pyrexia and hypertension.49,52 In study 016, dose reduction was 
required for 10 patients (4%) in the 100 mg/day group, seven (3%) in 
the 50 mg/day group, and nine (4%) in the placebo group. Completion 
rates were high (87%–90%), and there were no significant between-
group differences for incidences of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Although dyskinesia was reported as 
a TEAE in a minority of patients, this was generally mild or moderate.49 
This seems an incongruous finding, since patient-recorded ON time 
showed that safinamide significantly improved ON time with no or 
non-troublesome dyskinesia, and may be due to differences in data 
collection. Patients recorded ON time in their diaries every 30 minutes 
over an 18-hour period for five consecutive days preceding each visit. 
By contrast, AEs were reported at study visits and may reflect whether a 
patient is experiencing any dyskinesia at that moment, regardless of its 
impact on functioning. 
As a result of these data, safinamide received European Medicines 
Agency approval in 2015, (dosage 50–100 mg/day) for the treatment 
of mid- to late-stage fluctuating PD, as an add-on to l-dopa, alone or in 
combination with other PD medications.53
A post-hoc analysis of studies 016 and 018 aimed to characterise 
further the effects of safinamide on dyskinesia in mid- to late-stage PD 
patients.54 While the effects of the 50 mg/day dosage of safinamide in 
study 016 may be attributable to MAO-B inhibition, the superiority of the 
effects at 100 mg/day suggest that other mechanisms may be involved, 
as a dose of 50 mg/day is sufficient to achieve complete MAO-B 
inhibition. It was therefore postulated that the antidyskinetic effects of 
the higher dose could be attributed to non-dopaminergic mechanisms. 
Patients were therefore stratified by the presence or absence of 
dyskinesia at baseline score >0 or DRS score = 0, respectively), and 
by whether or not the dose of l-dopa had been altered during the 
24-month treatment period. Safinamide 100 mg/day significantly 
improved the DRS versus placebo in the subgroup of patients with or 
without changes in l-dopa dose. In patients with baseline dyskinesia, 
improvements were also significant in patients without changes in 
l-dopa dose (see Figure 3), suggesting that these improvements did not 
result from reduced dosage of l-dopa, but from the action of safinamide 
100 mg on glutamatergic neurotransmission. The authors concluded 
that the higher dose is needed to optimise the dopaminergic and 
 
non-dopaminergic effects of safinamide.54 
A post-hoc analysis of pooled data from studies 016 and SETTLE found 
that safinamide 100 mg significantly increased mean ON time with no 
or non-troublesome dyskinesia by 1.42 
h (95% CI: 1.21 to 1.64) versus 
0.58  
hour (0.37 to 0.80) with placebo (p<0.0001) and reduced mean OFF 
time by -1.49 hour (-1.68 to -1.30) versus -0.63 hour (-0.82 to -0.44) with 
placebo; p<0.0001). Significant changes compared with placebo in ON and 
OFF time were observed whether safinamide used as first or later adjunct 
therapy in l-dopa treated patients, and regardless of whether patients were 
receiving concomitant dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase 
inhibitors or amantadine.55 These findings suggest that safinamide may 
be considered either as a first adjunct therapy in PD patients who are 
not sufficiently controlled on l-dopa, and as an add-on therapy in patients 
taking l-dopa and other concomitant dopaminergic medications.
There is a need for further studies to explore the effect of safinamide 
on LID, as it is an important finding. Patients consider ON time with no 
or non-troublesome dyskinesia as ‘good’ ON time and it correlates with 
patients’ perceived duration of a good response throughout the day.49 
By contrast, the MAO inhibitor rasagiline has shown to increase ON time 
with troublesome dyskinesia, suggesting that targeting the dopaminergic 
pathway alone is effective in controlling motor fluctuations but not 
motor complications.42 In the phase III PRESTO study, the difference 
between the rasagiline dose of 1.0 mg/day and placebo in the ON time 
with dyskinesia was in favour of placebo: 0.37 h (p=0.048).56 
Summary and concluding remarks
PD is a complex condition and recent advances have elucidated 
the pathogenic processes underlying its symptoms. Numerous non-
dopaminergic neurotransmitters are involved in the control of motor 
symptoms and the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias 
following long-term l-dopa therapy. In particular, glutamate plays a key role 
in the pathophysiology of PD and represents a valuable therapeutic target.
Unlike other drugs that can improve motor function, long-term studies 
have shown that safinamide does not lead to an overall worsening of 
dyskinesia. Recent data suggest that this may be a consequence of its a 
unique dual mechanism of action, combining reversible MAO-B inhibition 
with blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, modulation of 
calcium channels and inhibition of abnormal glutamate release. The 
inhibition of sodium and calcium channels by safinamide is an important 
clinical finding and warrants further investigation. In phase III clinical 
studies, safinamide has been shown to significantly increase ON time 
with no/non-troublesome dyskinesias and decrease OFF time, as well as 
having beneficial effects on motor symptoms and QoL. Safinamide has

been investigated in long-term (24-month) studies, and has shown a very 
good safety profile, as well as long-term efficacy. 
In conclusion, safinamide is a unique therapy that combines non-
dopaminergic and dopaminergic mechanisms of action, modulating 
altered dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. There is 
a need for more clinical trial data to assess the effect of safinamide 
in dyskinesias. However, clinical trial findings to date suggest that 
safinamide represents an important therapeutic option for fluctuating 
PD patients. q
