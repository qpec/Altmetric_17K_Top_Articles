Abstract
Background: Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of at least 13 different types of cancer.
Methods: Data from the United States Cancer Statistics for 2014 were used to assess incidence rates, and data from 2005 
to 2014 were used to assess trends for cancers associated with overweight and obesity (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus; 
cancers of the breast [in postmenopausal women], colon and rectum, endometrium, gallbladder, gastric cardia, kidney, 
liver, ovary, pancreas, and thyroid; meningioma; and multiple myeloma) by sex, age, race/ethnicity, state, geographic 
region, and cancer site. Because screening for colorectal cancer can reduce colorectal cancer incidence through detection 
of precancerous polyps before they become cancerous, trends with and without colorectal cancer were analyzed.
Results: In 2014, approximately 631,000 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of a cancer associated with 
overweight and obesity, representing 40% of all cancers diagnosed. Overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence rates 
were higher among older persons (ages ≥50 years) than younger persons; higher among females than males; and higher 
among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white adults compared with other groups. Incidence rates for overweight- 
and obesity-related cancers during 2005–2014 varied by age, cancer site, and state. Excluding colorectal cancer, incidence 
rates increased significantly among persons aged 20–74 years; decreased among those aged ≥75 years; increased in 32 
states; and were stable in 16 states and the District of Columbia.
Conclusions: The burden of overweight- and obesity-related cancer is high in the United States. Incidence rates of 
overweight- and obesity-related cancers except colorectal cancer have increased in some age groups and states.
Implications for Public Health Practice: The burden of overweight- and obesity-related cancers might be reduced through 
efforts to prevent and control overweight and obesity. Comprehensive cancer control strategies, including use of evidence-
based interventions to promote healthy weight, could help decrease the incidence of these cancers in the United States.
Introduction
In 2013–2014, approximately one third of adults in the 
United States were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 
25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and approximately one third had obesity 
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) (1). Approximately half of U.S. residents 
are unaware that adults who are overweight or have obesity 
are at increased risk for cancer (2,3). The International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC) states that there is sufficient 
evidence for an association with excess body fatness, includ-
ing overweight, obesity, and weight gain, and at least 13 
cancers (3). These cancers include adenocarcinoma of the 
esophagus; cancers of the breast (in postmenopausal women), 
colon and rectum, endometrium (corpus uterus), gallbladder, 
gastric cardia, kidney (renal cell), liver, ovary, pancreas, and 
thyroid; meningioma, and multiple myeloma. Overweight 
and obesity might increase cancer risk through induction of 
metabolic and endocrine abnormalities, including increases in 
inflammation and levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor, 
and sex hormones (4).
Data compiled for the United States Cancer Statistics 
(USCS) data set (https://nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/) were used to 
calculate incidence rates in 2014 and trends during 2005–2014 
for cancers associated with overweight and obesity (overweight- 
and obesity-related cancers). In this report, overweight- and 
obesity-related cancers were defined as those classified by 
IARC as having sufficient evidence for an association with 
excess body fatness.
Methods
The USCS is a compilation of data from multiple sources 
that is used to report official federal cancer statistics through 
the USCS web-based report. The USCS data set includes

Key Points
• Overweight and obesity are associated with increased 
risk of at least 13 different types of cancer.
• Overweight- and obesity-related cancers accounted for 
40% of all cancers diagnosed in 2014.
• About 55% of cancers diagnosed in women and 24% 
of those diagnosed in men are overweight- and obesity-
related cancers.
• The incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers 
(excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly 
among persons aged 20–74 years during 2005–2014.
• The findings emphasize the importance of intensifying 
nationwide efforts to prevent and treat overweight 
and obesity.
• Multilevel approaches to comprehensive cancer control 
that address social determinants of health and include 
evidence-based interventions that address healthy 
weight and other cancer risk factors might help reduce 
the burden of cancer and other chronic diseases.

cancer incidence data from CDC’s National Program of 
Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute’s 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. 
Data on new cancer cases diagnosed during 2005–2014 were 
obtained from population-based cancer registries affiliated 
with NPCR and SEER programs in each state and the District 
of Columbia (DC). Data from DC and all states met USCS 
publication criteria for 2014, covering 100% of the U.S. popu-
lation; all states except Nevada met USCS publication criteria 
each year during 2005–2014, covering approximately 99% of 
the U.S. population.* Cancer site for cases was classified by 
anatomic site and histology.† Only cases of invasive cancer were 
included. Postmenopausal breast cancer was defined as breast 
cancer diagnosed in women aged ≥50 years.
* Cancer registries demonstrated that cancer incidence data were of high quality 
by meeting five United States Cancer Statistics publication criteria: 1) ≤5% of 
cases ascertained solely on the basis of death certificate; 2) ≤3% of cases missing 
information on sex; 3) ≤3% of cases missing information on age; 4) ≤5% of 
cases missing information on race; and 5) ≥97% of registry’s records passed a 
set of single-field and inter-field computerized edits that test the validity and 
logic of data components (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_
notes/criteria.htm).
† Cases were first classified by anatomic site using the International Classification 
of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (http://codes.iarc.fr/) then cases with 
hematopoietic histologies were classified using the World Health Organization 
Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, Fourth Edition 
(http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/117/19/5019?sso-checked=true#T1).
Population estimates for rate denominators were a modi-
fication of annual county population estimates by age, sex, 
bridged-race, and ethnicity, produced by the U.S. Census 
Bureau in collaboration with CDC and with support from 
National Cancer Institute, and aggregated to the state and 
national levels.§ Race bridging is a method used to make 
multiple-race and single-race data collection systems suf-
ficiently comparable to permit estimation and analysis of 
race-specific statistics (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/
sr_02/sr02_135.pdf). Ninety-five percent confidence inter-
vals for rates are presented to allow for informal comparisons 
among rates, without specifying a referent group. Joinpoint 
regression (https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/), which 
allowed different slopes for more than one period, was used to 
calculate changes in rates; trends were quantified by average 
annual percent change. Because screening for colorectal cancer 
can reduce colorectal cancer incidence through detection of 
precancerous polyps before they become cancerous (https://
www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/
UpdateSummaryFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2?ds), trends 
with and without colorectal cancer were analyzed. Rates were 
estimated by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and U.S. Census region. 
Trends were age-adjusted and estimated by cancer site, sex, and 
state. To examine the impact of the change in rates, the number 
of cases expected during 2006–2014 if rates had remained at 
2005 levels was subtracted from the actual number of cases 
during this period.
Results
In 2014, approximately 631,604 persons in the United States 
received a diagnosis of an overweight- or obesity-related cancer 
(Table 1). This represents 40% of the nearly 1.6 million 
cancers diagnosed each year (55% of the 799,734 cancers 
among women and 24% of the 796,752 cancers among males). 
Overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence rates were 
higher among older persons (ages ≥50 years) than younger 
persons and two thirds of cases occurred among persons aged 
50–74 years. The overweight- and obesity-related cancer 
incidence rate was higher among females (218.1 per 100,000 
population) than among males (115.0 per 100,000), partially 
because endometrial, ovarian, and postmenopausal female 
breast cancers accounted for 42% (268,091) of overweight-
and obesity-related cancers. The rates also varied by race/
ethnicity, with higher incidence among non-Hispanic blacks 
(black) and non-Hispanic whites (white) compared with other 
groups; however, black males and American Indian/Alaska 
Native males had higher incidence rates than did white males. 
§ Population estimates incorporate bridged single-race estimates derived from 
the original multiple race categories in the 2010 U.S. Census (https://seer.
cancer.gov/popdata/index.html).

Incidence was highest in the Northeast compared with other 
U.S. Census regions.
Among cancers affecting both males and females, incidence 
rates in 2014 were higher among males than among females for 
colorectal cancer (44.1 per 100,000 versus 33.7 per 100,000), 
kidney cancer (20.9 versus 10.6), pancreatic cancer 
(14.4 versus 11.1), liver cancer (11.2 versus 3.4), adenocar-
cinoma of the esophagus (5.4 versus 0.8), multiple myeloma 
(7.5 versus 4.9), and gastric cardia cancer (3.6 versus 0.8) 
(Table 2). Females had higher rates than did males of thyroid 
cancer (21.3 versus 7.4) and gallbladder cancer (1.4 versus 0.8). 
Among the three overweight- and obesity-related cancers 
that affect females only, incidence rates were higher for 
postmenopausal breast cancer (92.6 per 100,000) than for 
endometrial cancer (26.5 per 100,000) and ovarian cancer 
(11.0 per 100,000). By site, incidence rates decreased signifi-
cantly each year for meningioma (-3.8% per year), colorectal 
cancer (-2.9%), and ovarian cancer (-2.0%). Incidence rates 
increased significantly each year during this period for six can-
cers: thyroid cancer (4.0% per year), liver cancer (2.9%), gastric 
cardia cancer (1.2%), endometrial cancer (1.1%), pancreatic 
cancer (0.8%), and kidney cancer (0.7%). The incidence rates 
were stable for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,  gallbladder 
cancer, multiple myeloma, and postmenopausal breast cancer. 
The increase in risk for cancer per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI 
ranged from 1% each for thyroid and ovarian cancers to 9% 
for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. 
During 2005–2014, declines were observed in the overall 
incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers (-2%), 
colorectal cancer (-23%), and cancers not known to be related 
to overweight and obesity (-13%) (Table 2). Increased use of 
colorectal cancer screening tests likely contributed to the decline 
in colorectal cancer; when colorectal cancer was excluded from 
overweight- and obesity-related cancers, a 7% increase in overall 
incidence was observed. The trends varied substantially by age 
group: the rate for all overweight- and obesity-related cancers 
increased significantly among persons aged 20–49 years and 
50–64 years, and decreased among those aged 65–74 years 
and ≥75 years; colorectal cancer rates declined in all age groups 
except in persons aged 20–49 years; and rates for overweight- 
and obesity-related cancers (excluding colorectal cancers) 
increased among all age groups except persons aged ≥75 years 
(Figure 1). Because of reductions in colorectal cancer rates, 
approximately 224,800 cases have been averted since 2005.

* Cancer incidence compiled from cancer registries that meet the data quality criteria for all invasive cancer sites combined for all years during the period 2005 to 
2014 (covering 99% of the U.S. population).
† Per 100,000 persons, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.
§ Significant at p<0.05. Trends were measured with average annual percent change in rates and were considered to increase or decrease if p<0.05; otherwise trends 
were considered stable.
¶ Based on relative risk estimates from pooled epidemiologic studies (reviewed in http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1606602) and in the World Cancer 
Research Fund Continuous Update Project (http://www.wcrf.org/int/research-we-fund/continuous-update-project-cup).
However, during this same period, 211,800 excess cases from 
other overweight- and obesity-related cancers have occurred. 
Incidence rates of overweight- and obesity-related cancers 
(excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly in 32 states 
(0.3%–1.8%), and did not change in 16 states and the District 
of Columbia (Figure 2).
Conclusions and Comments
Overweight- and obesity-related cancers accounted for 
40% of all cancers diagnosed in 2014, and varied substan-
tially across demographic groups. Endometrial, ovarian, and 
postmenopausal female breast cancers accounted for 42% of 
new cases of overweight-and obesity-related cancers in 2014,

* Average annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated using joinpoint regression, which allowed different slopes for two periods; the year at which slopes changed 
could vary by age. All AAPCs were significantly different from zero (p<0.05) except for colorectal cancer in persons aged 20–49 years. 
† Overweight- and obesity-related cancer (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus; cancers of the breast [in postmenopausal women], colon and rectum, endometrium, 
gallbladder, gastric cardia, kidney, liver, ovary, pancreas, and thyroid; meningioma; and multiple myeloma) rates were calculated with and without colorectal cancer 
because colorectal cancer screening can detect precancerous polyps before they become cancerous, which might affect cancer incidence.
§ Cancer incidence compiled from cancer registries that meet the data quality criteria for all invasive cancer sites combined for each year during the period 2005–2014 
(covering 99% of the U.S. population). 
which is reflected in the higher overall incidence of overweight- 
and obesity-related cancers among females. For cancers that 
occurred among both males and females, however, the inci-
dence of most cancers was higher in males.
Meningioma declined the most (-3.8% per year) during 
2005–2014; however, this cancer accounted for <1% of over-
weight- and obesity-related cancers among males and females. 
The second largest decline was in the rate of colorectal cancer, 
which accounted for approximately 22% of overweight- and 
obesity-related cancers; this trend likely influenced the overall 
decline in the incidence of overweight- and obesity-related 
cancers during 2005–2014. National data have demonstrated 
an increase in colorectal cancer screening (5), which might 
have contributed to the decline in colorectal cancer incidence 
through detection of precancerous polyps, which can then 
be removed before becoming cancerous. When colorectal 
cancer was excluded from the trend analysis, overweight- and 
obesity-related cancer incidence increased among all age groups 
except persons aged ≥75 years. The increase in obesity-related 
cancer incidence coincides with an increase in the prevalence 
of obesity since 1960 in the United States with larger absolute 
percentage increases from 1960 to 2004 than from 2005 to 
2014 (1). The prevalence of overweight during this later period 
remained stable. These historical and current trends in over-
weight and obesity and cancers related to excess weight reflect 
the continued need for public health strategies to prevent and 
control overweight and obesity in children and adults and help 
communities make it easier for people to be physically active 
and eat healthfully.
There is consistent evidence that a high BMI is associ-
ated with cancer risk. Persons who are overweight or have 
obesity are nearly twice as likely as are healthy-weight 
(BMI = 18.5–24.9 kg/m2) persons to develop adenocarcinoma 
of the esophagus and cancers of the gastric cardia, liver, and 
kidney (6–9). Persons who have obesity are approximately 30% 
more likely to develop colorectal cancer than are persons with 
healthy weight (10). Women who are overweight or have obe-
sity are approximately two to four times as likely as are women 
with healthy weight to develop endometrial cancer (11).
Observational studies have provided evidence that even a 
5-kg (11 pound) increase in weight since early adulthood is 
associated with increased risk for overweight- and obesity-
related cancers (12). Maintaining a healthy weight throughout 
life has been associated with a reduction in risk of these cancers 
(3). However, the population effect of weight loss interventions 
on cancer risk might not be observable for at least a decade (4). 
In studies evaluating the effect of weight change on risks for 
endometrial cancer and breast cancer after long-term follow-up, 
weight loss was associated with reduced risks for both types of 
cancer among postmenopausal women (13,14).

Without intensified nationwide efforts to prevent and treat 
overweight and obesity, the high prevalence of excess weight 
might impede further declines in overall cancer incidence 
(15). These efforts include investing in addressing both social 
and behavioral determinants of health, such as unemploy-
ment and disparities in education and housing, to achieve 
better population health (https://nam.edu/addressing-social-
determinants-of-health-and-health-disparities-a-vital-direc-
tion-for-health-and-health-care/). Eating a healthy diet and 
engaging in sufficient physical activity are important compo-
nents of behavioral strategies to maintain a healthy weight. 
Population-based strategies to prevent and reduce overweight 
and obesity include helping persons of all ages meet dietary 
(https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines) and 
physical activity (https://health.gov/PAGuidelines) guidelines 
by supporting healthy eating and active living in a variety of 
settings, including communities, worksites, schools, and early 
care and education facilities. Strategies to provide support for 
these settings have been recommended by a number of public 
health entities including CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/
preview/mmwrhtml/rr5807a1.htm), the National Academy 
of Medicine (16), and the Community Preventive Services 
Task Force (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/
obesity). Health care providers could encourage patients to 
maintain healthy weights throughout their lifespans. To help 
treat obesity, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recom-
mends that clinicians screen all adults for obesity and either 
offer patients who have obesity intensive, multicomponent 
behavioral interventions or refer them to programs that offer 
these services (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/
Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/obesity-in-adults-
screening-and-management); similar recommendations exist 
for children aged ≥6 years (https://www.uspreventiveser-
vicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/
obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening).
The CDC’s National Comprehensive Cancer Control 
Program supports comprehensive cancer control efforts in all 
50 states, DC, eight tribes and tribal organizations, and seven 
U.S. territories and Pacific Island jurisdictions; these efforts 
include policy, systems, and environmental changes that 
promote physical activity and healthy food options in com-
munities. A review of cancer control plans implemented by 
grantees revealed that 89% include goals or strategies related to 
nutrition or physical activity to reduce cancer risk, with 82% 
including both (17). Other CDC programs, such as the State 
Public Health Action’s Program, address diet, physical activ-
ity, and obesity more broadly (https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/
dnpao/state-local-programs/state-public-health-action.html). 
Maintaining and strengthening these programmatic activities 
might help reduce the burden of overweight- and obesity-
related cancer.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the weights and BMI histories of cancer patients 
were not known. Second, because race and ethnicity data are 
abstracted from medical records, they are subject to misclas-
sification (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/techni-
cal_notes/interpreting/race.htm). Third, whereas IARC’s most 
recent report was used to define overweight- and obesity-related 
cancer, this might underestimate the actual burden, because 
evidence is still accumulating related to the association of 
overweight and obesity with other cancers (3). Fourth, many 
different risk factors might contribute to development of over-
weight- and obesity-related cancers, such as genetic mutations; 
chronic infections; and tobacco, hormone, and alcohol use 
(2). Changes in these other risks, as well as in cancer screening 
rates, might have affected the number of cancer cases and the 
trends described in this report. Finally, although this report 
tracks overweight- and obesity-related cancers, it does not 
estimate what proportion of these cancers are attributable to 
overweight and obesity.
The incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers 
(excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly among per-
sons aged 20–74 years during 2005–2014, mirroring increases 
of obesity observed since 1960 (1). Multilevel approaches to 
comprehensive cancer control that address social determi-
nants of health and include evidence-based interventions that 
address healthy weight and other cancer risk factors might 
help reduce the burden of cancer and other chronic diseases 
in the United States.
