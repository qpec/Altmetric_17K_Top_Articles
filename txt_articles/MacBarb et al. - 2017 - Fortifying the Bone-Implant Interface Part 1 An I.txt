Abstract
Background
An aging society and concomitant rise in the incidence of impaired bone health have led to the need for advanced
osteoconductive spinal implant surfaces that promote greater biological fixation (e.g. for interbody fusion cages,
sacroiliac joint fusion implants, and artificial disc replacements). Additive manufacturing, i.e. 3D-printing, may im-
prove bone integration by generating biomimetic spinal implant surfaces that mimic bone morphology. Such sur-
faces may foster an enhanced cellular response compared to traditional implant surfacing processes.
Methods
This study investigated the response of human osteoblasts to additive manufactured (AM) trabecular-like titanium
implant surfaces compared to traditionally machined base material with titanium plasma spray (TPS) coated sur-
faces, with and without a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) coating. For TPS-coated discs, wrought Ti6Al4V
ELI was machined and TPS-coating was applied. For AM discs, Ti6Al4V ELI powder was 3D-printed to form a
solid base and trabecular-like porous surface. The HA-coating was applied via a precipitation dip-spin method.
Surface porosity, pore size, thickness, and hydrophilicity were characterized. Initial cell attachment, proliferation,
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and calcium production of hFOB cells (n=5 per group) were measured.
Results
Cells on AM discs exhibited expedited proliferative activity. While there were no differences in mean ALP expres-
sion and calcium production between TPS and AM discs, calcium production on the AM discs trended 48% higher
than on TPS discs (p=0.07). Overall, HA-coating did not further enhance results compared to uncoated TPS and
AM discs.
Conclusions
Results demonstrate that additive manufacturing allows for controlled trabecular-like surfaces that promote earlier
cell proliferation and trends toward higher calcium production than TPS coating. Results further showed that
nanocrystalline HA may not provide an advantage on porous titanium surfaces.
Clinical Relevance
Additive manufactured porous titanium surfaces may induce a more osteogenic environment compared to tradi-
tional TPS, and thus present as an attractive alternative to TPS-coating for orthopedic spinal implants.

Introduction
Many orthopedic spinal implants are strategically de-
signed with specialized surfaces that promote os-
teointegration between the implant and surrounding
host bone. Both short- and long-term stability of such
implants highly depends on how well integrated they
become in situ.1 In spite of the tremendous advances
that have been made in developing implant surfaces
that promote bony integration, implant failure due to
loosening is not uncommon.2 Increasing the degree
of bony ongrowth and ingrowth to spinal implant sur-
faces, however, has the strong potential to decrease
the occurrence of subsidence, pseudoarthrosis,

 stress-shielding, and, ultimately, implant failure.3-5
Further complicating this matter is the rise in poor
host bone quality due to an aging population and a
concomitant rise in the incidence of conditions with
impaired bone health, such as results from osteo-
porosis6 and smoking,7 among other local and sys-
temic factors.8 In light of this, efforts are being made
to develop osteoconductive biomaterials that closely
mimic the complex micro- and macro-scale features
of host bone architecture as a means to improve os-
teointegration.
In developing porous materials for orthopedic spinal
applications, it is critical that they have sufficient
strength to withstand site-specific in vivo loading
conditions. While several methods have been devel-
oped to introduce controlled, interconnected pores
to ceramics and polymers,9 the brittleness of ceram-
ics and ductility of polymers have compromised their
use in load-bearing applications. Metals, particularly
titanium and its alloys, are well known for their
strength and biocompatibility10; however, introducing
highly controlled pores to metallic surfaces has
proven challenging.11 Of the various methods to de-
posit a porous surface to metallic implants, titanium
plasma spray (TPS) coating has been the most wide-
ly used on account of its success in various orthope-
dic applications. Initially, this coating was used for
cementless dental implants, as well as joint prosthe-
ses such as for the hip and knee.12,13 The success of
TPS coatings toward promoting cementless osteoin-
tegration lead to its incorporation in spinal applica-
tions, most notably interbody fusion cages, sacroiliac
joint fusion implants, and artificial disc replace-
ments.14-16 Porous surfaces achieved by TPS-coating
typically have low interconnectivity and small pore
sizes ranging from 100 – 150 μm. Recently, however,
surfaces with open and interconnected macro-scale
porous features, with pores in the range of 200 – 400
μm, have been shown to be essential for promoting
cellular infiltration and vascular ingrowth.17 It is
therefore of interest to develop new methods that al-
low for controlled, fully interconnected porous metal
surfaces that promote osteointegration and help
spinal implants better withstand in vivo loading con-
ditions in both healthy and impaired bone.
The recent introduction of three-dimensional (3D)
metal printing technologies, otherwise known as ad-
ditive manufacturing (AM), may offer an improve-
ment. Additive manufacturing provides the means to
rapidly and repeatedly produce highly-
interconnected and specific porous structures that
mimic natural cancellous bone architecture.18 Fur-
thermore, this technology allows for implants to have
a solid base structure to withstand high loads with an
inherently printed, highly controlled and intercon-
nected porous surface, which may help alleviate the
deleterious effects of stress-shielding.19 Additionally,
the printing process typically utilizes titanium pow-
der sizes ranging from 25 – 50 μm that are melted to-
gether in layers < 150 μm thick.20 These micro-
features fall within the range of native cancellous
bone micro-structures: trabeculae are 100 – 140 μm
thick,21 whereas individual mineralized collage fibers
(i.e. lamellae) are 3 – 7 μm wide.22 Thus, additive
manufacturing provides a means to develop highly
controlled porous metallic surfaces with both macro-
and micro-scale features closely mimicking native
cancellous bone, which may lead to enhanced os-
teointegration.
Aside from modifying titanium surfaces to have
macro- and micro-scale features, another means to
enhance the osteoblastic response to a material is to
improve its bioactivity. One common means to do so
is to apply hydroxyapatite (HA) to surfaces. Hydrox-
yapatite is a naturally occurring inorganic calcium-
based mineral that comprises ~70% of bone.23 Clinical
results of HA have been highly variable. For in-
stance, plasma sprayed HA, the most common
means to apply HA coatings, have been shown to de-
laminate from implants surfaces and to release par-
ticulates.24,25 Further, plasma spraying is a line-of-site
process that is unable to uniformly coat inner porous
surface features. A recent option is to deliver HA in
the form of nanoparticles, which may be beneficial in
that HA is naturally found in this form.26 Deposition
of highly crystalline HA nanoparticles via a recently
developed dip-coating precipitate technique results
in a strongly adhered surface coating typically ≤ 20
nm in thickness. Nanocrystalline HA applied in this
manner has been shown to promote early bone for-
mation on smooth titanium and PEEK implants com-
pared to uncoated implants in vivo.27,28 This tech-
nique may allow for nanocrystalline HA to be applied

 fully throughout a porous surface, adding a level of
nano-scale texture and bioactivity to titanium porous
surfaces that already present macro- and micro-scale
features.
This study evaluated and compared the in vitro os-
teoblastic response of AM titanium discs with an in-
herently printed porous surface to traditional ma-
chined titanium TPS-coated discs, with and without
the addition of nanocrystalline HA. The overall ob-
jective of the study was to identify surfaces that pro-
moted an enhanced osteoblastic response in terms of
initial cell attachment, proliferation, and extracellular
matrix (ECM) production. The hypotheses driving
this study were as follows: 1) that AM discs would
have a similar, if not enhanced, osteoblastic response
compared to TPS-coated discs, and 2) that coating
the discs with HA would further promote this re-
sponse.
Materials & Methods
Titanium Discs
For TPS-coated groups, wrought Ti6AL4V ELI was
machined into discs (15 mm in diameter x 1.25 mm
thick) with a 0.75 mm thick commercially pure (CP)
TPS-coating applied to the surface (Orchid Bio-
Coat, Southfield, MI). AM discs (15 mm in diameter
x 2.0 mm thick) were designed with a 1.25 mm thick
solid base and a 0.75 mm thick porous surface layer
and printed using Ti6Al4V ELI particles via electron
beam melting technology (Arcam AB, Mölndal, Swe-
den). The trabecular topology of the porous layer
was designed using Within Medical software (Au-
todesk, Inc., San Rafael, CA) to have a target pore
size of ~ 300 μm.17 Discs were printed at several dif-
ferent porosities representative of cancellous bone
(60 – 70% porosity),29 with the goal of choosing one
porosity that was closest to the TPS-coated discs for
comparative purposes. For groups having HA-
coating, a layer of nanocrystalline HA (~20 nm thick)
was applied to disc surfaces using a dip, spin, and
heat treatment technique, as previously described.27,28
Surface Characterization
Disc surfaces were analyzed per ASTM F1854 to de-
termine the porosity, pore size, and thickness (tissue
interface height) of methlymethacrylate-embedded
sections. Sections were subsequently used to mea-
sure the available surface area. Briefly, ImageJ (Na-
tional Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used
to quantify the perimeter of each porous surface over
a cumulative area of 15 mm2, which was then nor-
malized to the average area of the cross-section of
each sample and multiplied by the average porous
layer volume. Finally, the approximate surface con-
tact angle of a single deionized (DI) water droplet
(~5 mm in diameter) on each of the surfaces was
measured using ImageJ to determine their hy-
drophilicity (i.e., wettability).30
Cell Culture
Human 1.19 fetal osteoblast-like (hFOB) cells
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured and expanded
at 34°C in a 5% CO2 incubator in base medium con-
taining a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F12 medium and Dul-
becco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) con-
taining 2.5 mM L-glutamine without phenol red, 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Ge-
neticin), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Low pas-
sage cells (less than P4) were used in all experiments.
Each disc was seeded with 50,000 ± 5,000 hFOB
cells/disc (t = 0) and gently flooded with 1 mL of cul-
ture medium (base medium supplemented with 50
μg/ml L-Ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-
glycerolphosphate). Medium was exchanged every 2
to 3 days to ensure ample nutrition.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Disc surfaces were prepared by dehydration in
ethanol, critical point drying, and gold sputter coat-
ing, and investigated via SEM both before cell seed-
ing and after 3 weeks of incubation with the hFOB
cells. Unseeded cancellous human bone allograft
discs (BoneBank Allografts, San Antonio, TX) were
also imaged to serve as a reference for the desired
surface architecture of the AM discs.
Initial cell Attachment
Approximately 4 hours post-seeding, discs were
rinsed 3x with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to re-
move any unattached cells. The remaining adherent
cells were detached from the surface using trypsin/
EDTA (100 μl), after which culture medium (200 μl)
was added to inactivate the trypsin. A hemocytome-
ter was used to count the number of cells in the pre-

 pared cell suspension.
Cell proliferation
To assess the number of cells on the discs over time,
cell proliferation was measured at 2, 7, 14, and 21
days post-seeding to correlate with ALP and calcium
assay time points. At each time point, discs were
washed 3x with PBS. Next, 1 mL 10% v/v alamar-
Blue® solution, which measures the redox state of the
cells as a means to estimate cell number, was added
to each disc for 4 hours at 34°C. Following the ala-
marBlue cell viability kit (Thermo Scientific), 100 μl
triplicates of each prepared sample were read using a
spectrophotometer at 570 nm and 600 nm. Discs
were then rinsed 3x with PBS to remove any residual
alamarBlue®, flooded with 1 mL fresh culture medi-
um, and returned to the incubators until the next
time point. It is important to note that cell seeding
only occurred at t = 0; no additional cells were added
at any of the time points. Cell proliferation on the
discs was determined by normalizing the spectropho-
tometric readings to a standard curve of a known
number of hFOB cells analogously incubated for 4
hours in 1 mL of 10% v/v alamarBlue reagent in cul-
ture medium.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Activity
At 7 and 14 days post-seeding,31 discs were rinsed 3x
with PBS to remove any unattached cells, trypsinized
to remove the remaining attached cells from the sur-
face, and spun down to isolate the cells. The result-
ing cell pellet was isolated and resuspended in 200 μl
assay buffer. Cells were then lysed (i.e., burst) by
freeze-thawing, and used for determining ALP activi-
ty and total protein. ALP activity was measured us-
ing Abcam’s Alkaline Phosphatase Assay Kit
(ab83369). Total protein was determined using the
Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Scien-
tific™ Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay) and a NanoDrop
8000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Calcium Production
At 21 days post-seeding, seeded discs, along with 3
additional unseeded blank non-HA-coated and HA-
coated samples per group, were washed 3x with PBS
and fixed with 70% ethyl alcohol for 1 hour. After
rinsing off the alcohol with DI water, 0.5 mL of 40
mM Alizarin red-S (ARS), which binds to and stains
calcium, was added to each sample for approximately
30 minutes at room temperature. To quantify stain-
ing, each disc was again washed with DI water, after
which 0.5 mL of 10% cetyl pyridinium chloride
(CPC) was added to each well and incubated at room
temperature for approximately 1 hour to lift the stain
from the surface. The resulting solution (100 μl)
from each sample was transferred in triplicate and
the absorbance read at 540 nm. The concentration of
ARS staining in the samples was determined by com-
paring the absorbance values obtained to those in an
ARS standard curve (made using CPC). The average
value of the unseeded blank samples for each group
was subtracted from the average value of the seeded
discs from each group for the Alizarin red quantifica-
tion. In the case of the HA-coated discs, this step
was conducted to subtract out the effects of any HA
eluting from the surface of HA-coated discs. Calcium
deposition was expressed as a molar equivalent of
calcium, whereby one mole of ARS binds two moles
of calcium in the ARS-Ca2+ complex, as previously
described.32
Statistical Methods
This study was statistically analyzed using the soft-
ware package R.33 A two-factor, full factorial study
design was employed, including a manufacturing
method factor (machined versus AM) and a HA fac-
tor (+/- HA). A two-way ANOVA (n = 5 per group)
within each time point for each metric was used. Up-
on finding significance (p < 0.05), a Tukey’s HSD
post hoc test was applied. Data are represented as
mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Results
Surface Characterization
The TPS-coated discs had a mean porosity of 59%;
therefore, AM discs with a mean porosity of 60%
were chosen for this study (Table 1, Figure 1). The
AM discs had an average pore size of approximately
300 μm, while the TPS-coated discs had pores that
were approximately half this value. Tissue interface
height of the AM porous surface was ~ 1 mm thick,
while the TPS-coating thickness was ~ 0.75 mm. The
average available surface area of the AM discs was
1.78x greater than that of the TPS-coated discs. Fi-
nally, the surface contact angle of the AM discs was

 70.1° compared with 105.2° for the TPS-coated
discs; the HA-coated discs had a contact angle near
zero (unable to be measured). The SEM-EDX analy-
sis found all HA-coated discs had a similar amount of
calcium and phosphorus, whereas the uncoated discs
had negligible amounts of calcium and phosphorus.
Similar amounts of oxygen, carbon, and titanium
were also measured on all discs, although vanadium
and aluminum were only measured on the AM discs
since the TPS coated discs were coated with CP tita-
nium.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Imaging the discs pre-seeding showed that the AM
discs more closely mimicked the cancellous allograft
architecture compared to the TPS-coated discs (Fig-
ure 2). Imaging discs at 21 days post-seeding showed
cells growing on both AM and TPS surfaces. Given
the nanocrystallinity of the HA-coating, the HA was
only visible at magnifications greater than 20,000x

and additive manufactured (AM) discs.

due to their near perfect surface wettability.
(Figure 2). The coating appeared consistent regard-
less of disc-type.
Biochemical Analyses
At four hours post-seeding, there were 26% more
cells on AM discs compared to TPS discs (p = 0.48)
(Figure 3A). At 4 hours, AM+HA discs had 31% less
initial cell attachment compared to AM discs (p =
0.37), while TPS+HA discs had 44% less initial cell
attachment compared to TPS discs (p = 0.35). Over-
all, HA was found to be a significant factor toward re-
ducing initial cell attachment (p = 0.03).
At 2 days, there were significantly more cells on AM
discs compared to both TPS (p < 0.01) and TPS+HA
(p < 0.001) groups, with no difference between AM
and AM+HA groups (p = 0.1) (Figure 3B). By 7 days,
the AM group presented with significantly more cells
than the TPS, AM+HA, and TPS+HA groups (p <
0.0001). By 14 days, no significant difference in cell
number existed between AM, TPS, and AM+HA
groups (p = 0.1), with TPS+HA discs having signifi-
cantly fewer cells then all other groups (p < 0.05). Fi-
nally, by day 21, the TPS discs had significantly more
cells than both the AM and AM+HA groups (p <
0.01). Overall, HA was found to be a significant fac-

 tor that decreased proliferation at 2 (p = 0.04), 7 (p <
0.001), and 14 (p = 0.02) days. Further, manufactur-
ing method was found to be a significant factor at all
time points, indicating greater proliferation on AM
surfaces at 2 (p < 0.001), 7 (p < 0.001), and 14 days (p
< 0.02), and on TPS (i.e. machining) (p = 0.002) at
21 days.
Cells on AM discs produced 19% more ALP com-
pared to those on TPS discs at 7 days (p = 0.73) (Fig-
ure 4A). The AM+HA discs had 38% less ALP activi-
ty than the AM discs at this time (p = 0.33). By day
14, the AM discs had 38% more ALP activity com-
pared to TPS discs (p = 0.09), while both the AM
and TPS discs had significantly more ALP activity
than their HA-coated counterparts (p < 0.01). At day
14, HA was found to be a significant factor that de-
creased ALP activity (p < 0.001).
At 21 days, the AM group had 48% and 43% more cal-
cium production compared to TPS discs (p = 0.07)
and AM+HA (p = 0.10) discs, respectively. (Figure
4B). Coating the TPS discs with HA increased the
amount of calcium production compared to uncoated
TPS discs (p = 0.19).
Discussion
Developing spinal orthopedic implant surfaces that
improve osteointegration and promote expedited and
stronger implant fixation remains a significant chal-
lenge. To address this issue, the present study devel-
oped and characterized AM titanium porous surfaces
and compared the in vitro response of osteoblasts on
these surfaces to those grown on TPS-coating. Addi-
tionally, this study investigated whether a nanocrys-
talline HA coating would affect the osteoblastic re-
sponse to these surfaces. AM surfaces were found to
have significantly greater cell numbers at 2 and 7 days
compared to TPS discs, suggesting these surfaces
promote expedited proliferation. While there were
no significant differences in mean ALP expression
and calcium production between TPS and AM discs,
calcium production on the AM discs was found to
trend 48% higher than on TPS discs (p=0.07). The

 HA-coating, on the other hand, was found to be a
significant factor toward decreasing results in almost
all measured metrics on AM and TPS-coated discs.
Taken together, the positive, yet non-significant,
trends observed in this in vitro study suggest that the
highly controlled porous structure achieved on the
AM discs may provide a more osteoconductive envi-
ronment to promote greater early matrix production
compared to TPS, and that nanocrystalline HA may
hinder these effects on porous titanium surfaces.
Upon placing a spinal orthopedic implant designed
for osteointegration into living bone, a complex array
of biological and cellular events take place. Depend-
ing on the implant’s surface, such events may lead to
some degree of bone formation onto and into the sur-
face. Cellular-material interactions follow a similar
pathway in vitro, and can be divided into 4 distinct
phases: 1) cell attachment, adhesion, and spreading;
2) cell proliferation and ECM synthesis; 3) ECM de-
velopment and maturation; and 4) ECM mineraliza-
tion.34 Previous work has found that an implant’s sur-
face topology and roughness can be strategically tai-
lored to optimize and accelerate in vitro cellular-
material interactions.35,36 Inspiration for such work
stems from investigating natural bone turnover and
healing, where osteoclasts prepare the surface to be
remodeled with micron-scale roughness that aids in
initiating subsequent osteoblastic activity.37 There-
fore, spinal implant surfaces modified to have
micron-scale roughness may similarly stimulate os-
teoblasts to form bone matrix on the surface. As seen
under SEM (Figure 2), both the TPS-coated and
AM surfaces display micron-scale surface features.
The micron-scale bumps seen lining the open macro-
pores of the AM surface likely correspond to the in-
dividual Ti6Al4V ELI particles used during the
printing process. Although the TPS coating displays
similarly-sized surface features, they are much more
irregular. Overall, these comparably sized micron-
scale features found on both the TPS and AM sur-
faces likely influenced the osteoblastic responses
measured in this study.
Further comparisons of the AM and TPS-coated
discs revealed macro-scale topological differences be-
tween them. While both surfaces had similar porosi-
ties, the pore sizes measured in the TPS-coated discs
were about half of those achieved in the AM discs
(Table 1). As a result, the overall structure of the AM
surface appeared more similar to that of the cancel-
lous bone allograft, whereas the TPS surface lacked
distinctive open macro-pores. This may account for
the observation of the cells growing down into the
pores of the AM surface under SEM, whereas the
cells formed more of a sheet-like structure conform-
ing to the surface of the TPS-coated discs (Figure 2).
Previous work has likewise shown surfaces with high-
ly interconnecting pores in the range of 200 – 400
μm to have greater cellular infiltration compared to
less porous, low interconnecting surfaces.17 This may
be due, at least in part, to the ~2x greater surface
area of the more porous AM surfaces investigated
herein. Previous work has also shown that os-
teoblasts are sensitive to surfaces that have as little as
a 15° difference in water contact angles, with cells re-
sponding better to more hydrophilic (i.e. a smaller
contact angle) compared to more hydrophobic (i.e. a
larger contact angle) surfaces.38 The TPS surfaces
had a 35° greater water contact angle compared to
AM discs, indicating the TPS-coating to be more hy-
drophobic. Taken together, these results suggest the
highly controlled and interconnected porous surfaces
of the AM discs may be an improvement over the
widely used TPS-coating in regards to promoting os-
teointegration.
Previous studies have suggested that cells will better
adhere to HA-coated substrates due to its strong ad-
sorptive property to proteins, which promotes the
development of focal adhesions and may lead to ac-
celerated growth and differentiation of os-
teoblasts.39,40 Evaluation of AM+HA discs, however,
found the nanocrystalline HA to trend toward de-
creasing almost all metrics of osteoblastic activity
measured. This may be due, at least in part, to the
near perfect hydrophilicity and highly crystalline par-
ticles comprising the HA-coating employed in this
study. Previous work has found that cell-adhesion
mediating molecules bind weakly to extremely hy-
drophilic surfaces. This inhibits stable protein ad-
sorption to a surface, thereby negatively impacting
cellular adhesion and proliferation.41 Further, highly
crystalline HA-coatings have been associated with
lower dissolution rates of HA, which has also been
shown to negatively affect cellular attachment.42 For

 instance, one study found fewer osteoblasts attached
to titanium discs coated with higher crystallinity
nanoscale HA compared to discs with a lower crys-
tallinity nanoscale HA coatings.43 Zhu et al. further
found all nanoscale HA-coatings tested, regardless of
crystallinity, to have comparatively lower osteoblast
attachment and spreading compared to uncoated ti-
tanium discs.43 Thus, while it was anticipated that
the nanocrystalline HA-coating would provide en-
hanced osteoblastic activity, the high crystallinity of
the coating along with its near perfect wettability
may have, in fact, been detrimental to its in vitro per-
formance on the porous AM surfaces.
A review of the literature has found variable results
of HA-coatings. While some in vitro studies have
shown osteoblast attachment and differentiation to
be greater on HA-coated titanium surfaces,44,45 other
studies have shown osteoblast interactions to be ei-
ther the same or greater on non-HA-coated titanium
discs.46 These discrepancies may be due to differ-
ences in cell lines, culturing techniques, coating
methods, and surface preparations employed. For in-
stance, one study found no significant differences in
cell viability and proliferation among uncoated titani-
um discs or discs coated with plasma-sprayed HA,
sputter-coated HA, or sol-gel HA. Further, only the
sol-gel HA coating promoted increased ALP activity
compared to uncoated titanium discs.47 Similar dis-
crepancies have been observed clinically, with some
studies finding little to no advantage of HA-coated
implants,48,49 and others finding promising short- and
long-term outcomes.50,51 These different clinical find-
ings may likewise be the result of different coating
techniques, substrate surfaces, and the clinical indi-
cations they are used for, among others. It is also
worth noting that most work comparing the in vitro
biological effects of HA-coating on titanium surfaces
has been conducted on either smooth or micron-
scale rough titanium surfaces. The limited in vitro
work that has been done to study the effects of HA
on macro-scale AM porous surfaces has shown con-
flicting results.52,53 While the current in vitro study
showed that nanocrystalline HA applied via a dip,
spin, heat technique may not necessarily provide an
added benefit to macro-scale porous titanium alloy
surfaces, it may have a greater effect on non-porous
titanium surfaces or inert surfaces, such as PEEK.
Further investigation in a more physiologic in vivo
model was therefore conducted to verify whether
these results would hold true (see Part II).
Overall, this study found AM porous titanium sur-
faces promote accelerated osteoblastic activity, and a
trend toward greater calcium production compared
to TPS-coated surfaces in vitro. Coating either sur-
face with nanocrystalline HA was found to decrease
cellular responses in almost all cases considered.
Taken together, this study suggests that AM porous
titanium surfaces may induce a more osteogenic en-
vironment compared to traditional TPS-coating
processes, and that nanocrystalline HA provides lit-
tle to no advantage on either surface. Given the many
benefits associated with additive manufacturing,
namely increased design flexibility and the high level
of control over detailed surface features compared to
traditional machining processes, these results pre-
sent additive manufacturing as an attractive option
for generating more osteoconductive spinal biomate-
rials. Further work has been conducted to under-
stand the in vivo response of host bone to AM porous
surfaces to gain a better understanding of their po-
tential clinical utility as an additional, and possibly
improved, option to the widely used and clinically
successful TPS-coating (see Part II).
