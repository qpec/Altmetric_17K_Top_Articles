Tumour metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from the original tumour site followed by
growth of secondary tumours at distant organs, is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths
and remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of CDK4/6 blocks
breast tumour metastasis in the triple-negative breast cancer model, without affecting
tumour growth. Mechanistically, we identify a deubiquitinase, DUB3, as a target of CDK4/6;
CDK4/6-mediated activation of DUB3 is essential to deubiquitinate and stabilize SNAIL1, a
key factor promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition and breast cancer metastasis.
Overall, our study establishes the CDK4/6–DUB3 axis as an important regulatory mechanism
of breast cancer metastasis and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in
the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.

umour metastasis, the spread of cancer cells to distant vital
organs, causes the majority of human cancer-related
deaths1–6. Metastasis occurs through a complex multistep
process
including
local
invasion,
intravasation,
transport,
extravasation and colonization, which requires the concerted
action of many genes and signal pathways7–13. Epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly conserved cellular
process in which polarized, immobile epithelial cells are converted
to migratory mesenchymal cells14; EMT has been accepted as a
critical process during embryogenesis15,16. Numerous studies have
clearly
demonstrated
the
importance
of
EMT
in
tissue
regeneration, tumour progression and metastasis13,16–19, while
some studies suggest a major role of EMT in chemoresistance20–24.
Loss of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is a functional event
of EMT that reinforces the destabilization of adherent junctions.
Loss of E-cadherin and other essential events in the EMT
process alter the phenotype of epithelial cells from noninvasive
to
invasive16,25.
Downregulation
of
E-cadherin
involves
several mechanisms, such as transcriptional repression, mutation
and increased cleavage or degradation of E-cadherin1,16. The
transcription factor SNAIL1 directly represses the expression of
CDH1, the gene encoding E-cadherin, and activates the expression
of invasion-associated genes, thereby promoting EMT26–28. For
example, Peinado et al.29 demonstrated that SNAIL1 interacts with
a co-repressor complex SIN3A, and histone deacetylases HDAC1
and HDAC2, to repress E-cadherin expression by modifying local
chromatin structure. SNAIL1 also interacts with G9a, a major
euchromatin methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me2, and
recruits G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the E-cadherin
promoter for DNA methylation30.
Expression of SNAIL1 is tightly regulated at the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional levels. TGFb, NOTCH and WNT path-
ways can transcriptionally increase SNAIL1 expression by directly
binding to the SNAIL1 promoter, thus inducing EMT in
mammalian cells28,31,32. As a highly unstable protein, SNAIL1 is
post-translationally degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases, including FBXL14, FBXW1
and FBXO11, have been shown to induce SNAIL1 ubiquitination
and degradation33–35. However, whether and how SNAIL1 is
stabilized post-translationally is unclear. Thus, the identification
of the signalling pathway controlling SNAIL1 stabilization will
provide important clues for potential therapeutic targets of cancer
metastasis. Here we demonstrate CDK4/6 inhibition blocks
breast tumour metastasis without affecting tumour growth.
Furthermore, we identify deubiquitinating enzyme 3 (DUB3) as
a new target of CDK4/6; CDK4/6-mediated activation in DUB3 is
essential to deubiquitinate and stabilize SNAIL1. Overall, our
study demonstrates the importance of CDK4/6–DUB3 axis in
regulating breast cancer metastasis and provides a rationale for
potential therapeutic interventions in the treatment of breast
cancer metastasis.
Results
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 decreases human cancer metastasis.
A specific inhibitor of CDK4/6, PD0332991 (palbociclib), is a
potent anti-proliferative agent in multiple cancer cells36–38. More
recently, the US Food and Drug Administration granted
accelerated approval for palbociclib for use in combination with
letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with
oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast
cancers39,40. Tumours that are ER negative, progesterone receptor
negative and HER2 negative, also known as triple-negative breast
cancers (TNBCs), usually grow the fastest and are more
metastatic. In a previous study, compared with ER-positive
breast cancer lines, TNBCs were more resistant to PD0332991
(ref. 36). In our study, PD0332991 treatment inhibited cell
proliferation of T47D cells, but had no effect on cell proliferation
of TNBC cell lines, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary
Fig. 1a–c). Surprisingly, PD0332991 treatment markedly reduced
cell migration of MDA-MB-231 in vitro (Fig. 1a), suggesting a
potential role of CDK4/6 inhibitor in blocking cell metastasis.
PD0332991 was further tested in a patient-derived xenograft
model generated from a triple-negative high-grade invasive ductal
carcinoma (from the Breast Cancer Genome-Guided Therapy
study (BEAUTY) in Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota).
Immunodeficient mice implanted with human breast tumour
biopsy sample HCI001 were found to have liver, lung and ovary
metastases, reflecting the metastatic pattern in the donor
patient. Administration of PD0332991 did not affect the growth
of primary tumour as shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary
Fig. 1d. Strikingly, we found that PD0332991 could significantly
decrease liver (12.5% versus 75%) and lung (25% versus 75%)
metastases compared with the saline group (Fig. 1c–e,f–h). We
also investigated PD0332991 function in a xenograft metastasis
model. MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the mammary fat
pad of immunodeficient mice. When tumours reached 400 mm3
in size, we removed the primary tumours and treated these mice
with either vehicle or PD0332991 for an additional 12 weeks to
examine lung metastases. We found that the administration of
PD0332991 markedly suppressed lung colonization in these mice,
as determined by the number of metastatic lung nodules
(Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). These results demonstrate that the
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 can inhibit TNBC metastasis
without affecting tumour growth in the two models we tested.
This finding could potentially broaden the use of CDK4/6
inhibitor in the treatment of TNBC metastasis.
Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated that EMT is
essential for tumour progression and metastasis. As shown in
Fig. 1i, PD0332991 treatment decreased vimentin (mesenchymal
marker) protein level, while increasing E-cadherin (epithelial
marker) protein level in MDA-MB-231. Interestingly, the protein
level of SNAIL1, a key factor in EMT, decreased upon PD0332991
treatment (Fig. 1i), which could be rescued by the proteasome
inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 1j,k). These results suggest that CDK4/6
inhibition regulates SNAIL1 protein level in a proteasome
dependent
manner.
Furthermore,
PD0332991
treatment
markedly decreased the SNAIL1 protein stability (Fig. 1l,m).
PD0332991 treatment increased the ubiquitination of SNAIL1
(Fig. 1n,o). Previous studies suggested that several E3 ubiquitin
ligases including FBXL14, FBXW1 and FBXO11 regulate SNAIL1
ubiquitination and degradation33–35. Neither the direct interaction
between CDK4/6 and SNAIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 1g) nor CDK4/
6-mediated
phosphorylation
of
SNAIL1
were
detected
(Supplementary Fig. 1h). These results indicate a potential
unidentified factor mediates CDK4/6’s regulation of SNAIL1.
Identification of deubiquitinases for SNAIL1. To identify the
potential
linker
between
CDK4/6
and
SNAIL1,
we
used
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing FLAG-SNAIL1 to perform
tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis.
In addition to known SNAIL1 interacting proteins such as
ATM, DNMT1 and CSNK2A1 (refs 30,41,42), we identified several
DUBs, including USP7, USP10, USP11 and DUB3, as major
SNAIL1-associated proteins (Fig. 2a). Although SNAIL1 interacted
with several DUBs (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d), only overexpression
of DUB3, but not USP7, USP10 or USP11, markedly increased
the protein level of SNAIL1 in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2b). We con-
firmed
the
endogenous
SNAIL1–DUB3
interaction
by
co-immunoprecipitation in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells
(Fig. 2c,d; Supplementary Fig. 2e,f). As shown in Fig. 2c and

 Supplementary Fig. 2e, SNAIL1 co-immunoprecipitated with
DUB3. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with DUB3 antibodies
also brought down SNAIL1 (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 2f).
Moreover,
GST-DUB3
could
interact
with
recombinant
His-SNAIL1 in vitro, indicating a direct interaction between DUB3
and SNAIL1 (Fig. 2e).
DUB3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes SNAIL1. The interaction
of DUB3 and SNAIL1 prompted us to examine a potential role
for DUB3 in the regulation of SNAIL1 stability and function.
First, DUB3 and SNAIL1 protein levels were examined in several
luminal- and basal-like breast cancer cell lines. As shown in
Fig. 3a, DUB3 and SNAIL1 protein levels are higher in basal-like
breast cancer cell lines. To directly test the function of DUB3 on
endogenous SNAIL1 protein stability, we knocked down DUB3
with its specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in MDA-MB-231.
Depletion of DUB3 significantly decreased SNAIL1 protein level
(Fig. 3b). The regulation of SNAIL1 protein stability by DUB3
was not at the level of transcription since no apparent difference
of SNAIL1 mRNA level was detected in cells stably expressing
control and DUB3 shRNAs (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, MG-132
treatment could rescue the decreased SNAIL1 protein level in
cells depleted of DUB3 (Fig. 3d). Moreover, overexpression of
wild-type (WT) DUB3, but not the catalytically inactive C89S
mutant in both MCF-7 and T47D cells, increased SNAIL1 protein
level (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, SNAIL1 protein was less stable in
cells depleted of DUB3 in a cycloheximide pulse-chase assay
(Fig. 3f,g). These results suggest that DUB3 regulates SNAIL1
stability. To further investigate whether DUB3 functions as a
bona fide DUB that deubiquitinates SNAIL1, we performed
a deubiquitination assay by cotransfecting cells with WT DUB3
or the C89S mutant. A significant decrease of polyubiquitylated
SNAIL1 protein was observed in cells transfected with WT
DUB3, whereas the expression of C89S mutant was not able to
decrease SNAIL1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3h). In addition, WT
DUB3, but not the C89S mutant, markedly decreased SNAIL1
ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 3i). On the other hand, depletion of
DUB3 significantly increased SNAIL1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3j;
Supplementary Fig. 3a). When we examined the linkage of
SNAIL1 ubiquitination, we found that SNAIL1 was ubiquitinated
through both K48- and K63-specific chains (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). In addition, we found that DUB3 regulates only K48,
but
not
K63
ubiquitin
chains
(Supplementary
Fig.
3c,d).
Taken together, our results suggest that DUB3 is a bona
fide DUB targeting SNAIL1 protein for deubiquitination and
stabilization.
DUB3 regulates EMT through SNAIL1. Accumulating experi-
mental and clinical evidences demonstrated that SNAIL1 pro-
motes EMT. To investigate the potential function of DUB3 in this
process, we overexpressed DUB3 in two luminal breast cancer cell
lines, MCF-7 and T47D. Expression of WT DUB3 resulted in
decreased E-cadherin (epithelial marker) expression, increased
vimentin (mesenchymal marker) expression and converted
luminal cells into basal-like phenotype (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore,
the effect of DUB3 overexpression on EMT was not observed in
cells transfected with SNAIL1 shRNA, suggesting that DUB3
functions in promoting basal-like phenotype conversion through
SNAIL1 (Fig. 4a,b). Collectively, these results suggest that DUB3
regulates EMT by stabilizing SNAIL1.
DUB3
regulates
cell
migration
and
cancer
metastasis.
Repression of E-cadherin expression by SNAIL1 or other EMT
factors is one of the critical events in EMT induction and cancer
metastasis1,28,43. Since DUB3 deubiquitinates and stabilizes
SNAIL1 and consequently decreases E-cadherin expression, we
hypothesized that DUB3 is critical for breast cancer cell migration

depletion of DUB3 (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e). Altogether, these
results indicate that SNAIL1 is an important factor for DUB3’s
effect on migration.

 We further investigated DUB3 function in a xenograft
metastasis model. We found that knockdown of DUB3 in
MDA-MB-231 cells markedly suppresses lung colonization in
these mice, as determined by intensity of bioluminescence
(Fig. 4g,h) and number of lung nodules present (Fig. 4i,j).
Furthermore, overexpression of SNAIL1 in cells with DUB3
depletion significantly increased lung colonization compared
with those depleted of DUB3, as determined by intensity of
bioluminescence (Supplementary Fig. 4f,g) and number of
lung nodules present (Supplementary Fig. 4h). Together, our
results demonstrate that DUB3 is critical for cell migration,
invasion and lung colonization through stabilizing SNAIL1.
DUB3 is positively correlated to SNAIL1 in breast cancers.
Since SNAIL1 plays a critical role in human breast carcinoma
metastasis33,43,44
and
DUB3
stabilizes
SNAIL1
by
deubiquitinating
SNAIL1,
it
is
possible
that
DUB3
also
facilitates breast carcinoma metastasis. Our results (shown in
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4) demonstrate DUB3’s ability to
increase breast cancer cell migration and metastasis by targeting
SNAIL1, thereby supporting our hypothesis that DUB3 promotes
breast carcinoma metastasis in patients. To further test this
hypothesis, we examined the expression of DUB3 and SNAIL1 in
breast cancer tissue samples by using breast cancer tissue
microarray. Notably, high DUB3 protein expression positively
correlated with metastatic carcinoma (Po0.0001, R ¼ 0.347)
(Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). High SNAIL1 protein expression was
also positively correlated with metastatic carcinoma (Po0.0001,
R ¼ 0.344;
Supplementary
Fig.
5a,c).
Importantly,
DUB3
expression positively correlated with SNAIL1 protein expression
in metastatic carcinoma (Supplementary Fig. 5d). In addition, in
another tissue array with known breast cancer subtypes, high
protein expressions of DUB3 and SNAIL1 were both positively
correlated with basal-like breast cancer type (Supplementary
Fig. 5e,f), which is consistent with the role of DUB3 in promoting
basal-like phenotype conversion we observed in Fig. 4a,b. These
results suggest that DUB3 and SNAIL1 are positively correlated in
metastatic breast carcinoma.
CDK4/6
phosphorylates
Ser41
of
DUB3.
Our
results
demonstrate that both CDK4/6 and DUB3 regulate EMT and
metastasis through stabilizing SNAIL1. We speculated that DUB3
might be the missing link between CDK4/6 and SNAIL1.
Interestingly, we found that PD0332991 could not further induce
decrease
of
SNAIL1
protein
level
in
DUB3
knockdown
cells, suggesting that CDK4/6 may regulate SNAIL1 in a
DUB3-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). The interaction between
CDK4/6
and
DUB3
was
also
detected
by
endogenous
co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull down (Fig. 5b,c). We
hypothesized that CDK4/6 could phosphorylate DUB3. Indeed,
we found that CDK4/6 could phosphorylate DUB3 in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). To further identify the potential
phosphorylation sites in DUB3, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells
stably expressing FLAG-DUB3 to perform tandem affinity
purification
and
mass
spectrometry
analysis
of
potential
phosphorylation events in DUB3. We found that Ser41 is a major
phosphorylation site on DUB3, which matches with a CDK
consensus motif (Supplementary Fig. 6b). To test whether S41 is a
CDK4/6 phosphorylation site, GST-fused WT DUB3 and S41A
mutants were incubated with active CDK4 or CDK6 and an
in vitro kinase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 5d,
mutation at S41 abolished CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of
DUB3
in
vitro.
A
phospho-Ser41-specific
antibody
was
generated to further study the phosphorylation of Ser41 in cells.
HEK293T cells were transfected with DUB3 WT or the S41A
mutant. As shown in Fig. 5e, WT DUB3 was phosphorylated
in cells. However, S41A mutation completely abrogated the
phosphorylation of DUB3 at this site, indicating the specificity of
this antibody. We next tested CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation
of DUB3 in cells. We found that CDK4/6 inhibition markedly
reduces the phosphorylation of DUB3 at Ser41 (Fig. 5f).
Furthermore, depletion of CDK4 or CDK6 in cells only partially
decreased
the
phosphorylation
of
DUB3,
while
double
knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 almost completely abrogated
DUB3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5g). In addition, depletion of CDK4
or CDK6 alone in cells only partially decreased SNAIL1, while
double knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 decreased SNAIL1 more
markedly (Fig. 5h). Interestingly, CDK1 also phosphorylated
DUB3 at Ser41 in vitro and the treatment of Roscovitine could
decrease the phosphorylation of DUB3 (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b).
Thus, the potential function of CDK1 inhibition on EMT
and breast cancer metastasis warrants further investigation.
To assess whether PD0332991 actions are mediated through
CDK4/6–DUB3–SNAIL1 axis, we expressed WT DUB3, S41A or
S41D mutants in cells depleted of endogenous DUB3 and then
treated these cells with either vehicle or PD0332991. We found
that PD0332991 induces decrease in SNAIL1 protein level only in
WT DUB3 reconstituted cells but not in cells reconstituted with
S41A or S41D mutants (Fig. 5i). These findings provide evidence
that Ser41 is the major CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation site
on DUB3, which in turn regulates SNAIL1 protein level.
CDK4/6
phosphorylates
and
activates
DUB3.
Next,
we
investigated whether CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation affects
DUB3 activity. The deubiquitinase activity of WT DUB3 and
S41A or S41D mutants towards fluorogenic substrate, Ub-AMC,
were measured. Compared with the S41A mutant, WT and the
S41D mutant showed much higher activity towards Ub-AMC
(Supplementary
Fig.
8a,b).
This
result
suggests
that
S41
phosphorylation is essential for the deubiquitinase activity of
DUB3. We next tested how CDK4/6 and S41 phosphorylation of
DUB3 affects SNAIL1 ubiquitination. We transfected cells with
FLAG-DUB3 and HA-SNAIL1, treated cells with vehicle or
CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991, and SNAIL1 ubiquitination was
determined. As shown in Fig. 6a, SNAIL1 ubiquitination was
stronger in cells treated with PD0332991 compared to vehicle,
suggesting that CDK4/6 activity is important for the catalytic
activity of DUB3. We further tested whether phosphorylation of
S41 on DUB3 could affect the ubiquitination of SNAIL1 in cells.
As shown in Fig. 6b,c, overexpression of both WT and S41D
mutant DUB3 in cells efficiently decreased the ubiquitination of
SNAIL1; however, S41A mutant failed to do so. Collectively, these
results suggest that phosphorylation of S41 is important for the
deubiquitinase activity of DUB3 towards SNAIL1. We further
tested whether phosphorylation of S41 on DUB3 could affect
the protein level of SNAIL1 in cells. We reconstituted shRNA-
resistant WT, S41A and S41D DUB3 mutants in cells depleted of
endogenous DUB3 and checked SNAIL1 level. As shown in
Fig. 6d, DUB3 knockdown efficiently decreased SNAIL1 protein
level. WT DUB3 and the S41D mutant could rescue SNAIL1
protein level, while the S41A mutant failed to do so. Moreover,
depletion of DUB3 greatly inhibited the migratory ability of
MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells reconstituted with WT DUB3 and
the S41D mutant, but not the S41A mutant could rescue this
phenotype (Fig. 6e,f). Results from the metastasis model showed
that the reconstitution of WT DUB3 and the S41D mutant in
MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing DUB3 shRNA causes
stronger lung colonization than that of S41A mutant, as
determined by the number of lung nodules (Fig. 6g) and by
intensity of bioluminescence (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d). These

 results establish that CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of
DUB3 is important for DUB3 activity and SNAIL1 stability.
Overall, our study demonstrates that the CDK4/6–DUB3 axis
functions as an important regulatory mechanism of breast cancer
metastasis and provides a potential therapeutic approach in the
management of breast cancer metastasis (Fig. 6h).
Discussion
Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, cancer metastasis is
the most common cause of human cancer-related deaths and
remains poorly understood. Metastasis occurs through a complex
multistep process and requires the concerted action of many genes
and signalling pathways7,8. In the past 20 years, accumulated
experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the crucial
role of EMT in metastasis8,9,17,18,45–49. Thus, identification and
characterization of the genes that regulate metastasis and the
associated molecular mechanisms will lead to the development of
new
markers
and
potential
therapeutic
targets
for
cancer
metastasis.
The DUB3 has been reported to regulate DNA damage response
by controlling H2AX ubiquitination50. Moreover, overexpression
DUB3 has oncogenic potential by stabilizing the Cdc25A protein
phosphatase in a subset of human breast cancers and couples G1/S
checkpoint to pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells51,52.
Here our studies indicate that DUB3 is crucial to induce EMT
through the stabilization of SNAIL1 protein in breast cancer. In a
subset of human breast cancer cell lines and patient tumour
samples, the status of DUB3 is correlated with SNAIL1 expression
(Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 5). Interestingly, elevated DUB3 and
SNAIL1 expression are only detected in basal-like type but not
luminal-type breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the correlation
between DUB3 and SNAIL1 only exists in metastatic breast
carcinoma
but
not
in
non-metastatic
breast
carcinoma
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, it will be important to elucidate
how DUB3 expression is under regulatory control in breast cancer
metastasis. Curiously, the DUB3 gene, a part of the highly
polymorphic
RS447
megasatellite
sequence,
is
induced
by
cytokines interleukin (IL-)4 and IL-6 in certain mammalian
cells53,54. IL-6 has been demonstrated to repress E-cadherin
expression, promote EMT, invasion and metastasis in several
different cancer types including breast cancer and colorectal
cancer55,56.
Given
the
link
between
cytokines
and
cancer
metastasis, it will be intriguing to determine the regulatory

 in inflammation-induced breast cancer metastasis is an interesting
avenue that warrants further investigation.
Interestingly, we found that DUB3 is under regulatory control
of CDK4/6 at the post-translational level. We demonstrate that
phosphorylation of DUB3 on Ser41 is critical for activation of the
enzymatic function. S41A mutant decreases DUB3 catalytic
activity towards the fluorogenic substrate, Ub-AMC. Ser41 is
located in an unstructured region of the protein, which is outside
of the ubiquitin hydrolase domain. There are several reports
implicating the regulatory phosphorylation of DUBs57,58. These
post-translational
modifications
may
activate
or
modulate
regulatory subunits, which can control DUB activity and
possibly substrate specificity. In addition, the phosphorylation
modification of DUBs may trigger structural changes and affect
ubiquitin recognition. Further detailed structural studies on
DUB3 should be carried out to better understand the role of
phosphorylation on its catalytic activity. Although we show that
CDK4/6-mediated Ser41 phosphorylation is essential for DUB3
activation, phosphorylation of the other potential sites should be
further investigated.
The mechanisms controlling metastasis can be regulated
independently from primary tumour development. Recent studies
using CDK4/6 inhibitors establish these cell cycle kinases as
anti-cancer drug targets59,60. More recently, the Food and Drug
Administration granted accelerated approval to the specific
inhibitor of CDK 4/6, palbociclib (PD0332991), for use in
combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal
women
with
ER-positive,
HER2-negative
advanced
breast
cancer39,40. TNBCs usually grow the fastest and are more
metastatic36. Our study reveals a potential use of CDK4/6
inhibitor in the treatment of TNBC metastasis. Consistent with
previous studies, PD0332991 does not affect the growth of the
primary tumour derived from human TNBC samples. Instead,
PD0332991 induces the inactivation of DUB3, destablization of
SNAIL1 protein and decrease in cell migration, thereby reducing
metastasis in xenograft models, both from a breast cancer
patient and a TNBC cell line. Given the facts that TNBC is
particularly aggressive and more likely to metastasize, our study
might
introduce
a
new
paradigm
in
the
treatment
of
TNBC metastasis using CDK4/6 inhibitor. However, we only
tested two TNBC breast cancer models here. The effect of
CDK4/6 inhibitor in more TNBC models and other cancers needs
to be further tested.

Patient-derived xenograft model. A patient-derived xenograft model
(HCI001) was generated from an oestrogen receptor-negative, progesterone
receptor-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative
(ER �/PR �/HER2 �) high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma by the Breast Cancer
Genome-Guided Therapy study (BEAUTY) in Mayo Clinic (A17713). Metastasis
in immunodeficient mice implanted with human breast tumour biopsy sample
HCI001 was found in the liver, lung as well as ovary reflecting the metastatic
pattern in the donor patient. In brief, freshly operated human breast tumour
biopsy samples were implanted in the flank of female immunodeficient NSG
(NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice. When tumour size reached
1,000 mm3, mice were killed and tumour fragments (3 mm3) were re-transplanted
into mammary fat pads of additional mice. Passage 3 tumours were used to test the
effect of PD0332991 on metastasis. When primary tumours reached 100–150 mm3,
mice were divided into two groups by stratified randomization and treated either
with saline (n ¼ 8) or PD0332991 (150 mg kg � 1 daily, PO (oral administration),
n ¼ 8) for an additional 5 weeks. Tumour volumes were measured once per week.
After mice were killed, and lung and liver metastatic nodules were examined
macroscopically or detected in paraffin-embedded sections stained with
haematoxylin–eosin. Data were analysed using Student’s t-test. A P value o0.05
was considered significant. Mice were subjected to euthanasia if they displayed pain
or distress, such as lethargy, lying down, not eating or drinking, weight loss 410%
body weight or difficulty breathing. According to the blinding procedures, two
people as a group performed all the mice experiments. One person performed the
experiments and another one totally blinded to the experiment group measured the
tumour volume and weight, number of lung and liver nodules, and analysed
the data.
Denaturating Ni-NTA pulldown. Transiently transfected or virus infected cells
were collected and pellets were washed once in PBS. Cells were lysed in 8 M urea,
0.1 M NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl and 0.01 M Tris (pH 8.0). Lysates were briefly
sonicated to shear DNA and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen)
for 1–2 h at room temperature. Beads were washed five times with 8 M urea, 0.1 M
NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl and 0.01 M Tris (pH 8.0). Input and beads were boiled in
loading buffer and subjected to SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotting.
Denaturing immunoprecipitation for ubiquitination. The cells were lysed in
100 ml 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (PH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 20 mM NEM and 1 mM
iodoacetamide, boiled for 15 min, diluted 10 times with NETN buffer containing
protease inhibitors, 20 mM NEM and 1 mM iodoacetamide and centrifuged to
remove cell debris. The cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with
the indicated antibodies, and blotted as indicated.
Immunofluorescence staining. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips for the
experiment. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 5% goat serum for
1 h, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h and then with secondary antibodies.
The antibodies used in the immunofluorescence staining were E-cadherin
(1:200; Cell Signaling) and vimentin (1:500; Cell Signaling). Localization of
E-cadherin and vimentin were visualized by confocal microscopy.
Statistics. For cell migration, invasion and proliferation experiments, data are
represented as the mean±s.d. of three independent experiments. In the animal
study, data are represented as the mean±s.d. of eight mice. Statistical analyses were
performed with the Student’s t-test, Fisher exact test, analsysi of variance or w2-test.
Statistical significance is represented in figures by: #Po0.05; ##Po0.01.
Data availability. All data generated or analysed during this study are available
