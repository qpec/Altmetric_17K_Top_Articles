The number of births in the United States increased by 1% between 2013 
and 2014, to a total of 3 988 076. The general fertility rate rose 1% to 62.9 
births per 1000 women. The total fertility rate also rose 0.3% in 2014, 
to 1862.5 births per 1000 women. The teenage birth rate fell to another 
historic low in 2014, 24.2 births per 1000 women. The percentage of all 
births to unmarried women declined to 40.2% in 2014, from 40.6% in 
2013. In 2014, the cesarean delivery rate declined to 32.2% from 32.7% in 
2013. The preterm birth rate declined for the seventh straight year in 2014 
to 9.57%; the low birth weight rate was unchanged at 8.00%. The infant 
mortality rate decreased to a historic low of 5.82 infant deaths per 1000 live 
births in 2014. The age-adjusted death rate for 2014 was 7.2 deaths per 1000 
population, down 1% from 2013. Crude death rates for children aged 1 to 
19 years did not change significantly between 2013 and 2014. Unintentional 
injuries and suicide were, respectively, the first and second leading causes of 
death in this age group. These 2 causes of death jointly accounted for 46.5% 
of all deaths to children and adolescents in 2014.

This annual article is a long-standing 
feature in Pediatrics and provides a 
summary of the most recent published 
vital statistics data for the United 
States. Final birth and death data for 
2015 and final infant mortality linked 
file data for 2014 were unavailable 
when this article was prepared. We 
also include a special feature this year 
on recent efforts to improve birth data 
quality.

The data presented in this report were 
obtained from vital records: birth 
certificates, death certificates, and 
reports of fetal death for residents 
in all US states and the District of 
Columbia. More complete descriptions 
of vital statistics data systems are 
available elsewhere.1

Birth and death data for 2014 and fetal 
mortality data for 2013 were collected 
from both the 1989 (unrevised) and 
2003 (revised) versions of the US 
Standard Certificate of Live Birth, 
the US Standard Certificate of Death, 
and the US Standard Report of Fetal 
Death. The 2003 revisions and 
specifics on the 2013 and 2014 revised 
and unrevised reporting areas are 
described in detail elsewhere.1

All birth and mortality data presented 
in this report are considered 
comparable between certificate 
revisions.
Current vital statistics patterns 
and recent trends are presented 
according to age, race, and Hispanic 
origin as well as other birth and death 
characteristics. Hispanic origin and 
race are collected as separate items in 
vital records. People of Hispanic origin 
may be of any race. Most reporting 
areas allowed multiple-race categories 
on birth and death certificates in 
2014. However, until all areas revise 
the certificates to reflect updated 
reporting standards for race,

mother’s marital status was reported 
directly in all reporting areas except 
New York in 2014. Details about 
the reporting of marital status in 
New York and editing methods and 
imputations as applied to other items 
on the birth certificate are presented 
in publications of the National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).15 
National gestational age data are 
based on the obstetric estimate of 
gestation and available only from 
2007 onward.16
Cause-of-death statistics in this 
report are based solely on the 
underlying cause of death compiled 
in accordance with the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision.17 The underlying cause of 
death is defined as “(a) the disease 
or injury which initiated the train 
of morbid events leading directly to 
death, or (b) the circumstances of the 
accident or violence which produced 
the fatal injury.” 
17
Ranking for leading causes of death is 
based on number of deaths.18 Infant 
mortality refers to the death of an 
infant <1 year old. Infant mortality 
rates (IMRs) were computed by 
dividing the total number of infant 
deaths in each calendar year by 
the total number of live births in 
the same year.2 Neonatal mortality 
rates (NMRs) are shown for infant 
deaths that occurred at <28 days, 
and postneonatal mortality rates 
(PNMRs) are shown for infant deaths 
that occurred 28 days to <1 year of 
age.2 The denominator for both rates 
is the total number of live births. 
Perinatal mortality rates (PMRs) 
include fetal deaths at ≥28 weeks’ 
gestation and infant deaths at <7 
days of age.4 Fetal mortality rates 
(FMRs) are shown for fetal deaths at 
≥20, 20 to 27 weeks (early FMR), and 
≥28 weeks’ gestation (late FMR).4 
FMRs and PMRs were computed 
by dividing the number of fetal or 
perinatal deaths by the number 
of live births plus specified fetal 
deaths.4
The latest infant mortality statistics 
available based on the period-linked 
birth and infant death file are for 
data year 2013.19 In this data set, the 
death certificate is linked with the 
corresponding birth certificate for 
each infant who died in the United 
States in 2013. Birth and infant 
death certificates are linked in each 
state vital statistics office based on 
matching of common data fields, such 
as infant’s name and address, date 
of birth, and common data elements. 
The quality of the links is validated at 
NCHS, and records with questionable 
linkages are sent back to states for 
correction. Approximately 99% 
of all infant deaths are linked to 
matching birth certificates. The 
data were adjusted for the 1% of 
records that could not be linked to 
matching birth certificates through a 
record weight computed separately 
by state and age at death.19 The 
purpose of this linkage is to use 
additional variables available from 
the birth certificate, such as birth 
weight, to better interpret infant 
mortality patterns. The linked data 
also provide improved quality of race 
and ethnicity reporting because the 
information is ascertained directly 
from the mother.
The denominators for the calculation 
of birth (per 1000 population), death 
(per 1000 population), and fertility 
(per 1000 women aged 15–44 years 
of age) rates are population estimates 
based on the 2010 census as of July 
1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, provided by 
the US Census Bureau and produced 
under a collaborative arrangement 
with NCHS.1 
– 
3 To calculate a 
consistent series of birth and death 
rates, the population estimates for 
multiple-race people are “bridged” 
to be consistent with 1977 Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) 
race categories.20 The modification 
procedures are described in detail 
elsewhere.13, 
 
14
The estimated life expectancy at 
birth for a given year represents the 
average number of years that a group 
of infants would be expected to live if, 
throughout their lifetime, they were 
to experience the age-specific death 
rates that prevailed during the year 
of their birth.2
Data for the international comparisons 
of births and IMRs were obtained 
primarily from the 2014 United 
Nations Demographic Yearbook 
21 
and Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
iLibrary Health.22
NATURAL INCREASE
In 2014, >1.3 million people were 
added to the US population as a 
result of natural increase, the excess 
of births over deaths (Table 1).1, 
 
2 The 
rate of natural increase in 2014 was 
4.3 persons per 1000 population.
BIRThS
In 2014, the number of births for 
the United States was 3 988 076, 
1% more than in 2013 (Table 1).1 
The general fertility rate (GFR, the 
number of births per 1000 women 
aged 15–44 years) increased slightly 
to 62.9 in 2014, from 62.5 in 2013. 
In 2014, the total fertility rate was 
1862.5 births per 1000 women, 
slightly higher than the rate in 
2013 (1857.5) (Table 2). The total 
fertility rate estimates the number 
of births that a hypothetical group of 
1000 women would have over their 
lifetimes, based on the age-specific 
birth rates observed in a given year. 
It has been below replacement (2100 
per 1000 women, the number of 
births needed to maintain the size 
of a population) since 1972 with the 
exception of 2006 and 2007.1
Racial and Ethnic Composition
The GFR decreased for Hispanic 
women from 2013 to 2014 (from 
72.9 to 72.1) and increased for non-
Hispanic white women (from 58.7 to

 59.5). The change for non-Hispanic 
African American women (from 64.6 
to 64.5) was not significant.1 The rate 
for American Indian and Alaska Native 
women declined 3% in 2014 (from 
46.4 to 44.8), and the rate for Asian 
and Pacific Islander women increased 
3% (from 59.2 to 60.7). The fertility 
rates for these 5 groups ranged from 
44.8 births per 1000 women aged 15 
to 44 for American Indian and Alaska 
Native women to 72.1 for Hispanic 
women in 2014 (Table 2).
Trends in Age-Specific Birth Rates
Teenaged Childbearing
The teenage birth rate (15–19 years) 
dropped 9% from 2013 to 2014, 
continuing a historic decline for 
the United States to 24.2 births per 
1000 women (Table 3).1 The rate 
decreased 61% from 1991 to 2014. 
The birth rate for teenagers aged 
15 to 17 years fell 11% from 2013 
to 10.9 per 1000 in 2014, whereas 
the birth rate for older teenagers 
aged 18 to 19 years dropped 7% to 
43.8 per 1000 (Table 3). The overall 
percentage of first births to women 
<20 years of age declined from 23.1% 
in 2000 to 13.4% in 2014 (Fig 1).23
Childbearing for Women in Their 20s 
and 30s
The birth rate for women aged 20 to 
24 years fell to a record low in the 
United States in 2014, 79.0 births 
per 1000 women, a 2% decline  
from 80.7 in 2013.1 The rate for 
women aged 25 to 29 years was up 
slightly in 2014 to 105.8 (Table 2). 
The birth rate for women aged  
30 to 34 rose 3% from 2013 to  
2014, from 98.0 to 100.8 births per 
1000 women. The birth rate for 
women aged 35 to 39 also rose 3% 
in 2014, to 51.0 per 1000 women 
from 49.3 in 2013.1 The proportion 
of first births to women ≥30 years 
old rose from 24% to 30% from 
2000 to 2014 (Fig 1), reflecting a 
continuing trend in older age at 
marriage and childbearing  
among US women and changing 
demographic characteristics of 
families.23

 Childbearing for Women ≥40 Years Old
The birth rate for women aged 40  
to 44 years was 10.6 births per 
1000 women in 2014, up 2% 
from 2013 (Table 2).1 The rate for 
women aged 45 to 49 years was

1990.1
Unmarried Mothers
The birth rate for unmarried women 
fell for the sixth consecutive year 
in 2014, to 43.9 births per 1000 
unmarried women aged 15 to 44

Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on birth certificates. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Race categories are consistent with the 1977 OMB standards. Forty-
nine states and the District of Columbia in 2014, 41 states and the District of Columbia in 2012 and 2013, and 27 states in 2007 reported multiple-race data. Multiple-race data for these 
states were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 OMB standards for comparability with other states. Data sources: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, and the uS Census 
Bureau.

 (age 15–19) accounted for 14% of 
all nonmarital births, the lowest 
proportion ever reported.1
Cesarean Delivery
The cesarean delivery rate declined 
to 32.2% in 2014 from 32.7% in 
2013 (Table 4). The rate peaked at 
32.9% in 2009, after steady increases 
from 1996.1 The decline in cesarean 
delivery rates was a continuation of 
the trend for the fifth consecutive 
year for non-Hispanic white women 
(to 31.4%); rates also declined from 
2013 to 2014 for non-Hispanic 
African American (to 35.6% in 2014) 
and Hispanic (to 31.9%) women 
(Fig 2). For the second consecutive 
year, non-Hispanic white women 
have a lower cesarean delivery rate 
than Hispanic women (Fig 2); since 
1994, non-Hispanic African American 
women have had the highest rates of 
cesarean delivery.1
The low-risk cesarean delivery 
rate, defined as cesarean deliveries 
among first births, term (≥37 weeks’ 
gestation), singleton, and vertex 
births (not breech), showed a similar 
pattern to the overall changes from 
2013 to 2014 (Fig 2). The low-risk 
cesarean rate declined from 26.8% to 
26.0% from 2013 to 2014. Declines 
were observed for each of the largest 
race and Hispanic origin groups, 
with the largest decline for American 
Indian and Alaska Native women, 
down 6% (23.2–21.9) (Fig 2).1 The 
highest rates remained for non-
Hispanic African American women, 
followed by those for Asian and 
Pacific Islander women.
Multiple Births
In 2014, the twin birth rate was 33.9 
twins per 1000 total births, a new 
high for the United States, but not 
statistically changed from 2013 (33.7) 
(Table 4); the rate was generally 
stable from 2009 to 2012 but rose 2% 
from 2012 to 2013.1 The twin birth 
rate rose steadily by 76% overall 
between 1980 and 2009.1 The triplet 
and higher birth rate (the number 
of births in triplet and higher-order 
multiples per 100 000 total births) 
was 113.5 per 100 000 total births in 
2014, a drop of 5% from 2013 (119.5) 
(Table 4) and the lowest since 1994. 
The rate increased by 400% in the 
1980s and 1990s but has declined 
41% since the 1998 peak (193.5). 
The largest declines in triplet and 
higher-order multiple birth rates since 
1998 have been for non-Hispanic 
white women (down 46%) (Fig 3).24 
The rate for non-Hispanic African 
American women fluctuated over 
this period but was down for 2013 to 
2014, whereas the rate for Hispanic 
women was statistically unchanged 
for 2013 to 2014 but declined 15% 
from 1998 to 2014.
Infants in multigestation pregnancies 
are much more likely to be born 
early and smaller than those born in 
singleton pregnancies. Accordingly, 
they are at greater risk of early death, 
with twins ∼5 times and triplets ∼10 
times as likely to die in infancy.25
Preterm Birth
In 2014, the preterm birth rate 
(infants delivered at <37 completed 
weeks’ gestation per 100 births) was 
9.57%, down <1% from 2013 and 
8% from 2007 (10.44%), the first 
year for which comparable data are 
available (Tables 4 and 5).1 Preterm 
birth rates declined in 38 states and 
the District of Columbia from  
2007 to 2014; 26 states had declines 
>10%.1
Low Birth Weight
The low birth weight (LBW) 
(<2500 g) rate was 8.00% in 2014, 
essentially unchanged from 2013 
(Tables 4 and 5). The percentage of 
LBW infants increased nearly 20% 
from 1990 to 2006 but has declined 
slowly, by 3%, from 2006 through 
2014.1 The very low birth weight 
(<1500 g) rate was stable at 1.40% 
in 2014, as was the moderately low 
birth weight (1500–2499 g) rate 
at 6.60%.1 The LBW rate was not 
significantly changed between 2013 
and 2014 for non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic African American, and 
Hispanic infants (Table 4).

 (≥20 weeks’ gestation) was 5.96 per 
1000 live births plus fetal deaths, 
not significantly different from 
the 2012 level of 6.05.4 Although 
largely unchanged from 2006 to 
2012, the early FMR (20–27 weeks’ 
gestation) declined 3% from 2012 
(3.11) to 2013 (3.01).4 The late 
FMR (≥28 weeks’ gestation), nearly 
stable since 2006, did not change 
significantly from 2012 (2.96) to 
2013 (2.97).4 After declines from 
1990 to 2006, the overall FMR has 
remained largely unchanged since 
2006.4
The 2013 PMR, defined as the 
number of infant deaths before age 7 
days and fetal deaths at ≥28 weeks’ 
gestation per 1000 live births and 
fetal deaths at ≥28 weeks’ gestation, 
was 6.24, statistically unchanged 
from 6.22 in 2012.4 After a decline 
of 4% from 2006 to 2011, the PMR 
has remained statistically unchanged 
since 2011.4
INFANT MORTALITy
In 2014, a total of 23 215 infant 
deaths were reported in the United 
States, with approximately two-
thirds of infant deaths occurring 
during the neonatal period.2 The 
IMR was 5.82 infant deaths per 1000 
live births (IMR was 5.96 in 2013),

 NMR was 3.94 neonatal deaths per 
1000 live births (NMR was 4.04 in 
2013) (Table 5), and PNMR was 
1.88 postneonatal deaths per 1000 
live births (PNMR was 1.93 in 2013) 
(data not shown). From 2013 to 
2014, the IMR decreased 2.3% and 
the NMR decreased 2.5%. The PNMR 
did not change significantly between 
2013 and 2014.
Geographic Variation in Infant 
Outcomes
For 2014, Mississippi had the 
highest LBW (11.29%) and preterm 
(12.91%) rate, whereas Alaska 
had the lowest LBW (5.90%) rate 
and Vermont the lowest preterm 
rate (7.93%) (Table 5). States in 
the southeastern United States had 
the highest IMRs. In 2014, state 
IMRs ranged from 4.30 per 1000 in 
California to 8.68 in Alabama. The 
IMR for the District of Columbia  
was 7.26.
Leading Causes of Infant Death
In 2014, 56.9% of all infant deaths 
(Table 6) were attributable to 
5 leading causes: congenital 
malformations, deformations, and 
chromosomal abnormalities (20.4%); 
disorders related to short gestation 
and LBW, not elsewhere classified 
(18.0%); newborn affected by 
maternal complications of pregnancy 
(6.8%); sudden infant death 
syndrome (6.7%); and accidents 
(unintentional injuries) (5.0%).2 
These 5 leading causes of infant 
death are the same as in 2013.2,

INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS
 
Table 7 shows number of births for 
2013 and IMRs for 2011, 2012, and 
2013 for the United States and 28 
other countries with ≥40 000 births 
and an IMR less than the US rate in 
the years for which data are available. 
In addition, Croatia was included 
in Table 7 to maintain consistency 
with data shown in previous years, 
even though the number of births 
in 2013 for Croatia dropped just 
below 40 000. Belarus was newly 
added to the table this year. Data 
were obtained from the 2014 United 
Nations Demographic Yearbook 
21 
for births in 2013 and for IMRs for 
2011 to 2013 for all countries except 
4. IMRs were obtained from OECD 
data for 2013 for 3 countries, the 
Netherlands, United Kingdom, and 
Switzerland, and for 1 country, the 
Netherlands, for 2012.22 Data on 
the IMR for Canada for 2011 and 
2012 were available from Statistics 
Canada.26
The table shows countries ranked 
from the lowest to highest IMR in 
2013. Nine countries reported an 
IMR half or less than the US rate in 
2013, and only 2 countries besides 
the United States reported an IMR 
of ≥5 or more infant deaths per 
1000 live births. The higher IMR in 
the United States may result from 
a combination of factors including 
differences in reporting of live births 
and fetal deaths, higher preterm 
birth and LBW rates, and higher IMRs 
among term births and PNMRs than 
among other OECD countries.27

DEAThS
There were 2 626 418 deaths in the 
United States in 2014 (Table 1),  
29 425 more than in 2013. The 
crude death rate was 8.2 per 1000 
population in both 2013 and 2014. 
However, age-adjusted death rates 
are better indicators of the risk 
of mortality over time than crude 
death rates because they control 
for changes in the age distribution 
of the US population, especially 
given increases in the older adult 
population in the United States. The 
age-adjusted death rate decreased 
by 1% from 7.3 deaths per 1000 US 
standard population in 2013 to 7.2 in 
2014.2
The 2014 life tables (data not shown) 
show differences in life expectancy 
at birth by gender, race, and Hispanic 
origin. Hispanic women have the 
highest life expectancy at birth (84.0 
years), followed by non-Hispanic white 
women (81.1 years), Hispanic men 
(79.2 years), non-Hispanic African 
American women (78.1), non-Hispanic 
white men (76.5), and non-Hispanic 
African American men (72.0).2
Deaths Among Children
A total of 18 666 children and 
adolescents aged 1 to 19 years died 
in the United States in 2014 (Table 8).  
The death rate for children aged 1 
to 19 years was 23.9 per 100 000 
population in 2014, similar to the 
rate of 24.1 in 2013.
For all children aged 1 to 19 years, 
the leading cause of death was 
accidents (unintentional injuries), 
which accounted for 34.4% of all 
deaths in 2014 and 2013. The second 
leading cause of death was suicide, 
accounting for 12.1% of all deaths in 
2014 and 11.3% in 2013. Between 
2013 and 2014, changes in death 
rates were statistically significant for 
3 of the 10 leading causes of death 
among children. The death rate 
increased for suicide and decreased 
for influenza and pneumonia and 
chronic lower respiratory diseases. 
Changes in rates from 2013 to 2014 
for the other leading causes of death 
among children were not statistically 
significant.

 Deaths Among Adolescents and 
young Adults
Deaths from external causes are a 
major concern among youth aged 15 
to 24. In 2014, >67% of all deaths in 
this age group were attributable to 
motor vehicle accidents, accidental 
poisoning, homicide, and suicide.2 
In 2014, motor vehicle accidents 
accounted for 23.3% of deaths 
among people aged 15 to 24, suicide 
for 17.7%, homicide for 14.5%, and 
accidental poisoning for 12.1%. 
While death rates for youth aged 15 
to 24 from motor vehicle accidents 
dropped by 43% from 2000 to 2014 
(from 26.9 per 100 000 population to 
15.3), 
32 death rates from accidental 
poisoning and suicide continued to 
rise by 163% (from 3.0 to 7.9) and 
14% (from 10.2 to 11.6), respectively 
(Fig 4). Drug-related causes account 
for the majority of accidental 
poisoning deaths. Among those aged 
15 to 24, the number of deaths from 
unintentional drug-related poisoning 
increased from 1045 in 2000 to 3308 
in 2014.32 For all ages, according to 
a recent analysis of multiple-cause 
data, opioids (opioid pain relievers 
and heroin) are the drugs most often 
associated with drug overdose deaths 
in the United States.33 Although death

15 to 24 decreased by 25% between

there were 4171 deaths from this

Feature: Improving Birth Data 
Quality
After more than a decade of delays, 
all states and the District of Columbia 
are reporting birth data as of January 
1, 2016, based on the 2003 US 
Standard Certificate of Live Birth. 
Accordingly, data on numerous key 
demographic and health indicators, 
available for revised states as 
of 2009, will soon be available 
nationally. Information on topics 
such as the timing of prenatal care, 
maternal educational level, tobacco 
use before and during pregnancy, 
maternal BMI, source of payment 
for the delivery (eg, Medicaid), 
pregnancy resulting from infertility 
therapies, breastfeeding, and WIC 
food (Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children) for pregnancy should 
greatly enhance the usefulness of 
data from US birth certificates.
Over the past few years, a large 
effort also has been under way to

 assess and improve the quality of 
birth and fetal death data.34 As the 
result of data quality studies and 
careful review, 12 items, primarily 
medical and health related (eg, 
prolonged labor and significant birth 
injury), have been dropped from 
the national files because of poor 
data quality. These items will no 
longer be available at the national 
level, and vital statistics jurisdictions 
will not be contractually required 
to report these data to the NCHS. 
It is anticipated that the reduced 
reporting burden on hospitals will 
have a positive impact on quality of 
the remaining information. For a list

NCHS, in collaboration with the 
National Association for Public 
Health Statistics and Information 
Systems and its state partners, has 
also developed e-learning training for 
completing the medical and health 
information for the birth certificate 
(see http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
nchs/ 
training/ 
BirthCertificateE 
learning/ 
). This training focuses on the 
importance and widespread uses of 
these data, outlines the best practices 
at the hospital for accurate and 
thorough data reporting, and offers 
continuing education for physicians, 
nurses, and nonmedical staff. It was 
released in the fall of 2016 and is 
accessible on the NCHS Web site.
CONCLUSIONS
Vital statistics are a valuable tool 
for monitoring the health of the US 
population. Efforts are under way 
to assess and improve the quality 
of vital statistics data, particularly 
the birth medical and health 
information.34 As these efforts take 
effect, the quality of the data are 
expected to improve.
