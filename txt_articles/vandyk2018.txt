Investigation performed at Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, Doha, Qatar
Background: Hamstring injuries remain a significant injury burden in sports such as soccer that involve high-speed running. It has
repeatedly been identified as the most common noncontact injury in elite male soccer, representing 12% of all injuries. As the
incidence of hamstring injuries remains high, investigations are aimed at better understanding how to prevent hamstring injuries.
Stretching to improve flexibility is commonly used in elite-level sports, but risk factor studies have reported contradicting results,
leading to unclear conclusions regarding flexibility as a risk factor for hamstring injuries.
Purpose: To investigate the association of lower limb flexibility with the risk of hamstring injuries in professional soccer players.
Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
Methods: All teams (n = 18) eligible to compete in the premier soccer league in Qatar (Qatar Stars League [QSL]) underwent
a comprehensive musculoskeletal assessment during their annual periodic health evaluation at Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports
Medicine Hospital in Doha, Qatar. Variables included passive knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. A clustered
multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify associations with the risk of hamstring injuries. Receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine sensitivity and specificity.
Results: A total of 438 unique players (72.4% of all QSL players) competed for 601 player-seasons (148 players competed both
seasons) and sustained 78 hamstring injuries. Passive knee extension range of motion (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-
0.99]; P = .008) and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99]; P = .02) were independently associated
with the injury risk. The absolute differences between the injured and uninjured players were 1.8� and 1.4 cm, respectively,
with small effect sizes (d \ 0.2). The ROC curve analyses showed an area under the curve of 0.52 for passive knee extension
and 0.61 for ankle dorsiflexion, indicating failed to poor combined sensitivity and specificity of the 2 strength variables identified
in the multivariate Cox regression analysis.
Conclusion: This study identified deficits in passive hamstring and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion as weak risk factors for
a hamstring injury. These findings have little clinical value in predicting the risk of future hamstring injuries, and test results
must therefore be interpreted cautiously in athletic screening.

In elite soccer, hamstring injury is the most common non-
contact injury reported.17,25 The incidence of hamstring
injuries remains high and, at least at the Champions
League level, even seems to rise.18 Although there are pre-
vention programs based on eccentric strength training
indicating positive results,3,35,46,49 the evidence supporting
the use of stretching exercises aimed at improving flexibil-
ity to prevent injuries is limited.32,44,53 Nevertheless, flex-
ibility was the most routine injury risk screening test
reported by the 32 teams participating in the 2014 FIFA
World Cup in Brazil.30 Flexibility testing is also perceived
by European clubs to be important, with 87% of elite clubs

 reporting it as one of the 3 most commonly used injury
screening tests.31 However, prospective studies examining
the relationship between flexibility and the injury risk
have produced conflicting results.28,50-52
The most comprehensive meta-analysis to date identi-
fied high quadriceps muscle strength as the only modifi-
able risk factor to increase the risk of hamstring injuries
(together with the nonmodifiable factors of age and previ-
ous injury).20 Another systematic review confirmed previ-
ous injury as a risk factor but found conflicting evidence
for age and hamstring flexibility.48
No association was found between various flexibility
measures, such as the slump test, lumbar spine flexion,
lumbofemoral ratio, straight-leg raise, or sit-and-reach
test, with the risk of hamstring injuries.20 However, for
the active and passive knee extension tests, quadriceps
flexibility, and the dorsiflexion lunge test, there were
mixed or contradicting results, hampered by small sample
sizes and large heterogeneity between the studies included
in the meta-analyses.20,48 Thus, the relationship between
flexibility and the risk of hamstring injuries is still poorly
understood, and to date, no adequately powered study
exists investigating the relationship between flexibility
and the risk of hamstring injuries.
The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the
relationship between flexibility, measured as hamstring
and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, with the risk of ham-
string injuries in a large cohort of professional soccer players.
METHODS
Study Design
Ethical approval was obtained from an institutional review
board, the Anti-Doping Lab Qatar (F2013000003). This study
covered 2 consecutive soccer seasons (September 2013 to May
2015) of the Qatar Stars League (QSL), the premier soccer
league and highest level of competition in Qatar. All teams
(n = 18) eligible to compete agreed to participate in the study.
Each player from the respective teams underwent an annual
periodic health evaluation (PHE) at Aspetar Orthopaedic and
Sports Medicine Hospital in Doha, Qatar. The PHE was per-
formed from May to September, with the official start of the
season in September of each year. If players underwent the
PHE outside of this period and met the inclusion criteria,
they were still included in the study.
All players over the age of 18 years and eligible to com-
pete in the QSL, who had provided written consent and
were able to undergo testing, were included. Players who
were injured at the time of the PHE and unable to undergo
the tests were excluded. If no musculoskeletal tests were
performed at the start of a season, or no exposure or injury
surveillance data were recorded over an entire season,
players were also excluded. Figure 1 depicts the inclusion
methodology during the 2 study seasons.
Player Information
Nonmodifiable risk factors that were included for analyses
were history of hamstring injuries in the past 12 months,
age, playing season, team, leg dominance, playing position,
and ethnicity. Player height and weight were measured
and body mass index (BMI) calculated during the PHE.
Flexibility Tests
Active Knee Extension Test. The active knee extension
test was performed for both limbs with the player posi-
tioned supine on an examination table and the tested hip
flexed to 90�. A digital handheld inclinometer was posi-
tioned at the anterior tibial border halfway between the
inferior pole of the patella and the line between the 2 mal-
leoli.36 The player was instructed to extend his knee until
reaching maximal tolerable stretch of the hamstring

 muscle, while the examiner maintained the position of the
thigh vertically by reading the inclinometer (90� of ipsilat-
eral hip flexion). At the endpoint of maximal tolerable
stretch, the absolute knee angle was measured with the
inclinometer on the tibia as read out by the tester. The
active knee extension test has been found to be reliable.43
Passive Knee Extension Test. The passive knee extension
test was performed for both limbs in the same starting posi-
tion as for the active test; the hip of the tested limb was posi-
tioned in 90� of flexion, while the contralateral leg remained
flat on the examination table. The examiner extended the
knee until reaching maximal tolerable stretch of the ham-
string muscle as indicated by the tested player while main-
taining the thigh vertically.36 At the endpoint of maximal
tolerable stretch, the absolute knee angle was measured
with the inclinometer on the tibia as read out by the tester.
Excellent interrater reliability and good test-retest reliabil-
ity have been found for this test.23
Dorsiflexion Lunge Test. A measuring tape (in cm) was
placed on the floor with the start point (0 cm) aligned to
the bottom corner of the wall. The player was instructed
to stand facing the wall, positioning his foot so that the
heel line and big toe were aligned on the tape measure
on the floor.9 The players lunged forward so that their
knee touched the wall. They were allowed to hold onto
the wall for balance during the test with the untested leg
free to rest in a comfortable position. The player was
instructed to lunge forward, moving his ipsilateral knee
into flexion and touch the wall while maintaining contact
between the heel and the floor. The examiner observed
the maximum distance in which the player could maintain
this position, measuring the distance from the wall to the
big toe. The measure was repeated for both the left and
right sides. The interrater and intrarater reliability for
this test have been reported as excellent.9
Injury Surveillance
All participating QSL teams were provided with medical
services by the National Sports Medicine Programme,
a department at the Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Med-
icine Hospital. This centralized system with a focal point
for the medical care of each club competing in the QSL
allowed for the standardization of ongoing injury surveil-
lance through the Aspetar Injury and Illness Surveillance
Programme (AIISP).8
The AIISP includes prospective injuries and exposures
(minutes of training and match play) recorded from all QSL
teams. The injury data were collected monthly, with regular
communication with the responsible team physician/physical
therapist
to
encourage
timely
and
accurate
reporting.
Throughout the 2013/2014 season (July-May; 44 weeks),
training and match exposures for each team were recorded
by the team physician (or lead physical therapist if no team
physician was available). At the conclusion of each season,
all the data from the individual clubs were collated into a cen-
tral database, and discrepancies were identified and followed
up at the different clubs to be resolved.
A hamstring injury was defined as acute pain in the pos-
terior thigh that occurred during training or match play
and resulted in an immediate termination of play and
inability to participate in the next training session or
match.47 These injuries were confirmed through a clinical
examination (identifying pain on palpation, pain with iso-
metric contraction, and pain with muscle lengthening) by
the club medical team. If indicated, the clinical diagnosis
was supported by ultrasonography and magnetic reso-
nance imaging at the study center. A recurrent injury
was defined as a hamstring injury that occurred in the
same limb and within 2 months of the initial injury.25
Statistical Analysis
The average of the flexibility measures, as determined by
the active knee extension, passive knee extension, and dor-
siflexion lunge tests, was compared between injured and
uninjured players using independent t tests. Similar com-
parisons were made between the injured limbs and unin-
jured limbs using paired t tests. The effect size, which is
the quantitative measure of the strength of an observed
occurrence,
was
calculated
and
interpreted
as
small
(.0.2), medium (.0.5), or large (.0.8).13
Because of the consistency in our sample, we modeled
the time to the first hamstring injury after the date of test-
ing using Cox regression analysis. Because our study
included repeated measures performed over the 2 seasons,
as well as the fact that not every player had the same num-
ber of measurements (ie, some players might have test
results including both limbs for both seasons, while other
players might only have been tested once), standard errors
would have increased when using generalized estimating
equations in a traditional Cox regression model. Therefore,
we performed a univariate Cox regression analysis using
the limb as the unit of analysis, adjusting for player iden-
tity as a cluster factor (Stata version 11.0; StataCorp).
Each individual player’s exposure was computed as the
total duration in hours for matches and training combined
from the start to the end of each season or time to the first
injury. All variables with a P value �.10 in the univariate
analysis were considered further in a backward stepwise
multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify potential
predictors. Hazard ratios with 95% CIs are presented
with exact P values, and P values �.05 were considered
statistically significant.
We calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves to describe the sensitivity and specificity of the sig-
nificant flexibility variables. The area under the curve
(AUC) indicates how well the strength variables under con-
sideration would discriminate between injured and unin-
jured players and was interpreted as excellent (�0.90 to
�1.00), good (�0.80 to \0.90), fair (�0.70 to \0.80), poor
(�0.60 to \0.70), or fail (�0.50 to \0.60).1,33

kg/m2) reported for screening and were considered for mus-
culoskeletal testing. Players who were unable to undergo
testing (n = 45), who did not provide consent (n = 4), or
had no injury surveillance data recorded during the subse-
quent season (n = 105) were excluded from the final anal-
yses (n = 154; mean age, 25.2 6 4.7 years; mean height,
178 6 9 cm; mean weight, 75.1 6 9.8 kg; mean BMI, 23.4
6 1.9 kg/m2). In total, 438 unique players (72.4% of all
QSL players) competed for 601 player-seasons (163 players
competed both seasons) (Figure 1).
New Hamstring Strain Injuries
In total, 73 of the 438 players sustained 78 index ham-
string injuries. The 5 players who had more than 1 injury
were retained in the analyses; none of these injuries met
the criteria for a reinjury, and all subsequent injuries
were sustained in the second season. All injured players
in season 1 had their previous injury status adjusted
accordingly in season 2.
Nonmodifiable Risk Factors
There were no differences in height, ethnicity, limb domi-
nance, and body composition between injured and uninjured
groups (Table 1). A previous hamstring injury was reported
by 30.1% of the entire cohort (n = 132), with no significant
difference between injured and uninjured players.
The univariate analysis identified age and player posi-
tion as potential risk factors for a hamstring injury (Table
1). Goalkeepers were significantly less likely to sustain
a hamstring injury than defenders, midfielders, or for-
wards. The injured players were, on average, 18 months
older than the uninjured players.
Range of Motion Tests as Potential Risk Factors
The results from the univariate analysis are presented in
Table 2 for both the active and passive knee extension tests
as well as the dorsiflexion lunge test. Both the passive knee
extension test and dorsiflexion lunge test displayed a sig-
nificant difference between the injured and uninjured
groups. These effects were maintained when exposure
was accounted for in the univariate Cox regression analy-
sis (Table 2).
In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, both the
passive knee extension and dorsiflexion lunge tests were
retained from the univariate analysis and significantly
associated with the risk of hamstring injuries, with no
influence on age and player position (Table 3).
ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC of 0.52 and 0.61
for the passive knee extension test and dorsiflexion lunge
test, respectively, indicating failed to poor combined sensi-
tivity and specificity of the 2 strength variables identified
in the Cox regression. The results for both variables were
normally distributed, with complete overlap in the distri-
bution of range of motion between the injured and unin-
jured groups for both passive knee extension range of
motion and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (Figures 2
and 3, respectively).
DISCUSSION
This 2-season prospective cohort study, with 438 players
and 78 hamstring injuries, the largest to date, identified
significant but small associations between hamstring and
ankle range of motion and the risk of injuries. This sug-
gests that limited flexibility represents a weak risk factor
for hamstring injuries and may be considered a causal fac-
tor. The group differences in the range of motion measures
between players who went on to suffer a hamstring injury
and those who did not were small, and the wide overlap
between groups clearly illustrates that it is not possible
to use these tests in screening to identify whether a player
is at risk of hamstring injuries.
Hamstring Range of Motion
Flexibility is consistently described in the literature as the
outcome of range of motion tests. Although factors such as
joint mobility22 and neural dynamics41 might influence the
findings of range of motion tests, the active and passive
knee extension, straight-leg raise, sit-and-reach, or lumbar
spine flexion tests are interpreted to represent muscle flex-
ibility.50,53 Therefore, we might consider how these differ-
ent range of motion tests compare with each other when
used to determine flexibility and the risk of hamstring
injuries.

 Recently, range of motion measured by the sit-and-reach
test was found not to be associated with the risk of ham-
string injuries,50 while range of motion measured by the
straight-leg raise test has been identified as a risk factor
for hamstring injuries.50 A recent meta-analysis of available
prospective cohort studies found no significant difference
between injured and uninjured groups for the lumbar spine
flexion, sit-and-reach, and straight-leg raise tests.20 Simi-
larly, the same meta-analysis did not identify active or pas-
sive knee extension as risk factors for a hamstring injury.20
However, there are 2 key elements that differentiate the
active and passive knee extension tests from other measures
of hamstring flexibility such as the sit-and-reach, lumbar
spine flexion, and straight-leg raise tests. The latter include
(1) pelvic movement and/or (2) the knee being fixed in an
extended position during the test. Because of the biarticular
nature of the hamstrings, allowing the pelvis to move dur-
ing the test and keeping the knee fixed might influence
the resultant range of motion. The results from the knee
extension test, where pelvic movement is constrained and
motion occurs at the knee joint, might more accurately rep-
resent the flexibility of the hamstrings. Although the con-
current validity of these tests is poor, the knee extension
test is recommended as the most valid and reliable measure
for clinicians to use when the aim is to assess hamstring
muscle range of motion.15
The hamstrings are thought to be at the greatest risk of
injuries during the terminal swing phase of high-speed run-
ning,27,39 as the biarticular hamstring muscle undergoes
a stretch-shortening cycle in this phase of the stride cycle.45
During the terminal swing phase, the hamstrings are
lengthening, producing peak force and performing much
negative work.38 The greatest musculotendinous strain is
produced during this phase, making the hamstrings suscep-
tible to injuries during the lengthening (eccentric) contrac-
tion.12 Although pelvic movement is necessary for high-
speed running, the amount of anterior tilt and hip flexion
does not alter dramatically in the late swing phase.14
Although the relationship between measures of flexibility
and high-speed running is unknown, we might consider
whether the active and passive knee extension tests might
represent more valid tests for hamstring flexibility in soccer
players exposed to high-speed running.
Active Knee Extension. Our results support previous
findings that range of motion during active knee extension

 is not associated with the risk of hamstring injuries. The
same test has been investigated for the risk of reinjuries
and potential delayed return to sport.16,28,51 De Vos
et al16 identified an independent association with the
risk of reinjuries. The active component might capture dif-
ferent aspects of apprehension or comfort with the move-
ment, similar to Askling et al’s5 H-test at return to sport.
It might reflect changes in the affected tissue that persist
even when rehabilitation is completed.
Passive Knee Extension. Our results do challenge previ-
ous findings that fail to identify passive knee extension as
a risk factor for hamstring injuries.4,19,37 There are poten-
tial reasons for the contrasting results. Although Enge-
bretsen et al19 included a high number of hamstring
injuries (n = 65), this represented a mix of acute and over-
use hamstring injuries. Also, a small absolute difference
between the groups (0.5�) and a large standard error of
the mean (2.1�) were reported.19 Arnason et al4 included
less than half the number of injuries (n = 31) compared
with our study. Interestingly, they found greater range of
motion (by 3.4�) in the injured group, again with a large
standard error of the mean (2.1�). Rolls and George37
investigated a cohort of youth soccer players, and in their
small sample of only 15 injuries, they observed a difference
of 4.4�; yet, with an SD of 8.3�, there is again the potential
for a type II error. The inclusion of a large number of acute
index injuries in our study allows for the identification of
weaker associations between passive knee extension and
hamstring injuries than may have been possible in previ-
ous studies.
Ankle Dorsiflexion Range of Motion
Gabbe et al21 found restricted ankle dorsiflexion range of
motion on the lunge test to be independently associated
with the risk of hamstring injuries but not when adjusting
for age and previous injury in a multivariate model. Our
results, based on a greater number of injuries (78 vs 31,
respectively), confirm this and suggest that ankle dorsi-
flexion range of motion may represent a risk factor for
hamstring injuries. Adequate ankle dorsiflexion mobility
is a necessary component for running.11 Decreased ankle
mobility changes the touchdown position of the foot during
sprinting, reducing horizontal force production.10 As ham-
string muscle activity is highly correlated with increased
horizontal force production,34 limited ankle dorsiflexion
mobility might lead to increased work required from the
hamstring muscle, predisposing it to injuries.
The neuromuscular coordination of the posterior muscle
chain has been proposed as a potential risk factor for ham-
string injuries.40 Although empirical evidence to support
the theory surrounding the function of the posterior kinetic
chain is lacking, we might consider how knee extension
and ankle dorsiflexion range of motion influence the over-
all flexibility of the posterior lower limb and consequently
the conditions necessary for optimal neuromuscular func-
tion of the posterior kinetic chain.
Strengths and Limitations
While 200 injury cases are needed to detect small to mod-
erate associations between risk factors and injury, 30 to
40 injury cases are needed to detect strong to moderate
associations in prospective cohort studies.7 With 78 inju-
ries, this is as yet the largest prospective study investigat-
ing flexibility as a potential risk factor for acute hamstring
injuries.
These findings suggest that flexibility, measured as
hamstring and ankle range of motion, may be involved in
the causation of hamstring injuries. However, all of the
effect sizes observed were small, too small to have any clin-
ical importance.
All tests were performed by highly experienced asses-
sors in a multinational, multilingual clinical setting for
professional athletes. Although every effort was made to
ensure that players understood the test procedure and
instructions, it is possible that some players did not com-
prehend the instructions fully. However, this is represen-
tative of current clinical practice, which increases the
external validity of the study.
As with every prospective cohort study, we must con-
sider that the one-off baseline test might not necessarily
reflect the status of the player at the time of injury. We
also acknowledge the homogeneity of our study population
of professional male soccer players, which limits the gener-
alizability of these findings to other sports, age groups, or
female players. Other factors such as training culture
and possible prevention strategies within different teams,
or climate specific to the Middle East region, could also
have influenced the results.
Clinical Implications
It is still common practice to include stretching exercises to
prevent injuries in elite-level soccer.29 Stretching improves
compliance of the musculotendinous unit53 and the ability

groups.

 to undergo the stretch-shortening cycle. However, basic
science evidence documenting that improved compliance
increases the ability to absorb energy is lacking.42
Currently, there is no intervention study documenting
that stretching reduces the risk of hamstring injuries.24,54
Although there are studies showing a reduction in injuries,
these were conducted with military recruits aiming at
reducing overuse injuries.2,26 While 2 studies did find an
effect on overuse injuries,2,26 the findings cannot be
extrapolated to elite soccer. In fact, a nonrandomized inter-
vention study found no effect of a program of warm-up
stretching and additional flexibility training on the risk
of hamstring injuries in elite soccer.3 Another investigation
indicated that stretching might be useful as part of
a warm-up.17 However, in this study, the warm-up pro-
gram also included running, calisthenics, and skill exer-
cises with the ball, and it is unclear which component of
the warm-up was responsible for the preventive effect.42
The passive knee extension and dorsiflexion lunge tests
cannot be used to predict who may be at risk of injuries;
there is no suitable cut-off point for either test that can dif-
ferentiate between injured and uninjured legs. The results
display a wide overlap between injured and uninjured
players (Figures 2 and 3), as also demonstrated for other
risk factors.6 However, screening has been shown to be
valuable in detecting ongoing musculoskeletal conditions,8
and flexibility tests may be used to identify underlying
injuries.
CONCLUSION
This study identified deficits in passive hamstring and
ankle dorsiflexion range of motion as weak risk factors
for a hamstring injury. These findings have little clinical
value in predicting the risk of future hamstring injuries,
and test results must therefore be interpreted cautiously
in athletic screening.
