IMPORTANCE Estrogens have neuroprotective and antidepressive effects; however,
associations between indices of reduced endogenous estrogens and risk for postmenopausal
depression have not been systematically explored.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of age at menopause and the duration of the
reproductive period with the risk for depression among postmenopausal women with
naturally occurring menopause.
DATA SOURCES A search strategy for use of MEDLINE was developed (through January 1,
2015) using the key terms menopause, climacteric, reproductive period, depression, and mood
disorders. References of included studies and reviews were also screened; authors were
contacted to maximize synthesized evidence.
STUDY SELECTION A total of 12 323 articles, without language restriction, were screened by
pairs of reviewers to identify observational studies related to the study hypothesis; 14 studies
were eligible for meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Pairs of reviewers independently extracted information
on study design and type of analysis by participants’characteristics and methods of
depression ascertainment. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and
fixed- or random-effects models were implemented.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pooled-effect estimates for depression, defined by
psychiatric evaluation or validated instruments, by age at menopause and duration of the
reproductive period.
RESULTS The 14 studies included in the meta-analysis represented 67 714 women. An inverse
association (reported as odds ratio [OR]; 95% CI of 2-year increments) with depression in
postmenopausal women was shown for increasing age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-0.99
[67 434 unique participants; 13 studies]) and duration of the reproductive period (0.98;
0.96-0.99 [54 715 unique participants; 5 studies]). Menopause at age 40 or more years
compared with premature menopause was associated with a 50% decreased risk for
depression (3033 unique participants; 4 studies). Pooling of studies examining severe
depression showed a 5% decrease in risk of severe depression with increasing (2-year
increment) age at menopause (52 736 unique participants; 3 studies); sensitivity analysis of
studies controlling for past depression revealed similar results for age at menopause (0.98;
0.96-1.00 [48 894 unique participants; 3 studies). No heterogeneity or publication bias was
evident in the main analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, expressed as
older age at menopause and longer reproductive period, is associated with a lower risk of
depression in later life. Identifying women at higher risk for depression due to early
menopause who could benefit from psychiatric intervention or estrogen-based therapies
could be useful in the clinical setting.

M
ental disorders are an important public health issue,1
with the lifetime prevalence of major depression ap-
proximating 15% in high-income countries and 11%
inlow-incomecountries.2Late-lifedepressionaffectsupto10%
oftheelderlypopulation.3Moreover,depressivedisordershave
beenrecognizedasthesecondleadingcauseofdisabilityacross
aperson’
slifespan4andhavebeenconsistentlyassociatedwith
adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease5,6
and all-cause mortality.7
Sex discrepancies have been described in the epidemio-
logic studies2,8 of depression, with a doubled lifetime risk of
major depression among women compared with men; this
disparity is more profound during women’
s reproductive
years.9 Intense fluctuations of ovarian hormones observed
premenstrually,10,11 during pregnancy and postpartum,12 and
perimenopausally13 have been associated with depression and
have been proposed as the reason for this female preponder-
anceduringthespecifiedtimewindows.Estrogensarethought
to exert neuroprotective actions via receptors that have been
recognized in the brain.14 Furthermore, the higher vulnerabil-
ity of women to stressful events and sex differences in stress
response could partly explain the discrepancy.15
Transition in the postmenopausal period is linked to a rela-
tively abrupt decrease in estrogen production16 and a gradual
attenuation of sex differences in the prevalence of depres-
sion in the elderly population.14 Therefore, an advanced age
at menopausal transition as a marker of longer exposure to en-
dogenous estrogens could indicate a longer exposure to neu-
roprotectiveandantidepressiveeffectsofestrogens.Inthiscon-
text, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was
to synthesize and quantify the results of published studies on
the association between age at menopause or the duration of
the reproductive period as markers of cumulative lifelong es-
trogen exposure and the risk of depression in postmeno-
pausal women.
Methods
This systematic review was based on a predefined protocol
(eMethods 1 in the Supplement). It was conducted in accor-
dance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology guidelines17 (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria
Relevant published scientific articles were sought in MEDLINE
through January 1, 2015, using combinations of the following
Medical Subject Headings: menopause, climacteric, reproduc-
tiveperiod,depression,andmooddisorders.Thedetailedsearch
strategy is available in eMethods 2 in the Supplement. No re-
strictions on language, publication year, or study design were
applied. Reference lists of the included studies and relevant
reviews were thereafter hand searched for additional poten-
tially eligible studies (snowball procedure).
Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies explor-
ingtheassociationofdepressionwithageatmenopauseand/or
durationofthereproductiveperiodinpostmenopausalwomen
with naturally occurring menopause were considered eli-
gible. Age at menopause was preferably defined as 1 year fol-
lowing the last menstruation,18 but studies examining age at
final menstruation were also considered for eligibility. Dura-
tion of the reproductive period was determined as the age at
menopause minus the age at menarche. The diagnosis of de-
pression must have been based on clinical diagnostic criteria
or validated cutoff-point questionnaires. Case series, case re-
ports, in vitro studies, animal studies, and investigations using
nonvalidatedinstruments,questionnaireswithnodefinedcut-
off point, or questionnaires assessing depression as a self-
reported symptom by a single question were excluded. Stud-
ies that included only women with depression and those that
examined a population with preexisting severe psychiatric dis-
orderswerenoteligible.Studieswerealsoexcludedifthepopu-
lation was limited to perimenopausal participants, breast can-
cer survivors with medically induced menopause, or women
with surgically induced menopausal transition. When the par-
ticipants included women who underwent naturally occur-
ring or surgically induced menopause, the quantitative syn-
thesis was limited to the cohort with naturally occurring
menopause if those data were available; otherwise, the origi-
nal effect estimates were included. Randomized clinical trials
or intervention studies were considered for eligibility if they
provided depression measurements at the preintervention
phase. The investigators in those studies were contacted to
provide appropriate analyses, potential clarifications, or miss-
ing data.
Investigators in nondirectly eligible studies (ie, including
both exposure and outcome variables) were contacted to pro-
videthemultivariateregressionanalysiseffectestimatesofage
at menopause and/or the duration of the reproductive period
on depression encompassing at least the following adjusting
factors: age, educational level, hormone therapy (HT) use, pre-
menopausal depression history, smoking, body mass index,
marital status, and parity. These variables were principally se-
lected by confounding factors used by the studies included in
this meta-analysis19-24 to achieve homogeneous effect esti-
mates. Reminders were sent to investigators 1 month after the
initial contact. In case of multiple publications referring to the
same cohort, the most recent publication or the one with the
largest sample was selected for inclusion in the meta-
analysis, but information from all relevant studies was re-
tained. The selection of eligible studies was performed by 6
investigators (including M.K.G., T.P.T., A.-A.D, and E.I.K.) in 3
pairs who independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full
text of identified articles; consensus was provisioned to re-
solve any disagreement.
Data Extraction and Assessment of Quality
Abstracted descriptive data included general information
(ie, year, author, title, journal, region of origin, and study pe-
riod), study characteristics (ie, design, duration of follow-up,
and inclusion and exclusion criteria of the participants), and
characteristics of the participants (ie, cohort size and number
of incident cases, number of cases and controls, matching fac-
torsincase-controlstudies,meanage,agerange,ethnicity,defi-
nition and ascertainment of depression, ascertainment of age
at menopause and duration of reproductive period, type of

menopause, and HT use). Statistical analysis of the
abstracted data included adjusting factors, reference cat-
egory, and type of the effect estimate and results (ie, odds
ratios [ORs] and 95% CIs). Maximally adjusted effect esti-
mates were preferred. If the aforementioned data were not
presented in the article, crude effect estimates and 95% CIs
were de novo calculated from 2 × 2 tables using data avail-
able in the article.
The quality of the included studies was evaluated using
the 9-item Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-
control studies.25 However, because the effect estimates of all
eligiblestudieswerederivedfromcross-sectionalanalyses,the
cohort subscale of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (6 items) after
excluding items 4 (“demonstration that outcome of interest
was not present at start of study”), 8 (“was follow-up long
enough for outcomes to occur”), and 9 (“adequacy of fol-
low-up of cohorts”) was used.26 For comparability questions,
age was set a priori as the most important matching or adjust-
ment factor. Publication bias was assessed by the Egger test
in analyses including at least 10 study arms.27 Statistical sig-
nificance was set at P < .10. Four of us (M.K.G., T.P.T., A.-A.D.,
and E.I.K.) performed data abstraction and quality assess-
ment independently in pairs of 2; consensus was reached for
disagreements.
Statistical Analysis
TheORsand95%CIsofthedifferentstudieswerepooledusing
fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel)28 or random-effects
(DerSimonian-Laird)29 models, and pooled-effect estimates
were calculated. Between-study heterogeneity was mea-
sured by the I2 and Cochran Q tests; significance was set at
P < .10. In cases of significant between-study heterogeneity,
a random-effects model was applied regardless of the I2
estimation.30 The significance level for the overall effect was
set at P < .05.
Analysis was conducted separately for the effect of both
independent variables of interest (ie, age at menopause and
duration of the reproductive period) as continuous variables
on the risk of depression. Based on the largest eligible study
(51 088 women),20 2-year increments were chosen for the ex-
posure variables. Different increment effect estimates of other
included studies were thereafter converted to 2-year esti-
mates to safeguard homogeneity. Studies reporting only
category-specific ORs were included following ad hoc estima-
tion of the log-linear trend using the generalized least-
squares approach.31 Because this method requires the num-
ber of cases and controls by category of exposure and the
presence of at least 3 levels of exposure, including baseline, it
could not be applied to all studies. Therefore, an alternative
analysis was carried out that included studies presenting
results for age at menopause as a dichotomous categorical
variable (≥40 vs <40 years).
Two sensitivity analyses were performed retaining stud-
ies controlling for the presence of premenopausal depres-
sion, as well as studies controlling for HT use. In a subanaly-
sis, we examined the effect of age at menopause on severe
postmenopausal depression, as defined by instruments used
by the individual studies. A sensitivity analysis was then con-
ducted including only studies defining age at menopause by
the internationally accepted definition of 1 year following the
last menstruation. Raw data contributed by authors who we
contacted were modeled in multivariate logistic regression
analyses to derive individual effect estimates that were sub-
sequently synthesized in the meta-analysis (eMethods 2 in the
Supplement). All statistical analyses were performed using
Stata, version 11.1 (StataCorp).32 Data analysis was conducted
from June 10 to August 13, 2015.
Results
Search Strategy and Contact of Authors
Figure 1 depicts the flowchart of the study selection process.
The database search yielded 12 323 records; 12 057 of these
were deemed irrelevant by title or abstract. The full text of the
remaining 266 articles was assessed along with 13 potentially
eligible articles derived from the snowball process. Of these
279 articles, 6 were eligible,19-24 133 were excluded (eTable 2
in the Supplement), and the authors of the remaining 140 ar-
ticles were contacted for clarification. Of these 140 articles, 8
studies provided the requested analysis or raw data for analy-
sis by the leading research team.33-40 Details regarding selec-
tion of the studies and contacting of the authors, as well as the
full reference list, are available in eMethods 2 and the eRefer-
ences in the Supplement.
Thirteenofthe14eligiblestudiescontaineddatathatcould
be included in the analysis on treating age at menopause as a
continuous variable,20-24,33-40 and 4 studies were included in
the analysis on treating age at menopause as a categorical
variable.19,22,24,40 Five studies contributed data for analysis of
the duration of the reproductive period, which was consid-
ered a continuous variable.20,21,37,39,40
The Table summarizes the abstracted data of the 14 non-
overlapping eligible studies (67 714 unique women). Ten of
the studies were cross-sectional19,21,22,24,33-38 and 4 were
cohort20,23,39,40 studies. Depression was diagnosed by vali-
dated self-report instruments in 12 studies.19-22,24,33-39 The
DSM-III-R criteria were used for diagnosis of major depres-
sion in one study,40 and a history of physician-diagnosed
depression was used in another study.23 Women not meeting
the criteria determined in studies for the diagnosis of
depression composed the control group. Among 12 studies
reporting the type of menopause, only 4 provided separate
analyses for naturally occurring menopause,33,35,39,40
whereas 8 studies included women who had undergone sur-
gical menopause as well.19-24,36,37 Eight of 9 studies provid-
ing information for HT use included current or past
users,19-21,23,36,37,39,40 and only 1 study included only women
not using HT.35 The main continuous analysis for age at
menopause included 67 434 postmenopausal women,
among whom 8565 were considered to have postmeno-
pausal depression, whereas the alternative main analysis
including the duration of the reproductive period as the
exposure of interest comprised 6591 women with depression
symptoms among the 54 715 participants. All but 2

The most common adjusting factors (eTable 3 in the

Quality of Studies
Quality assessment of the eligible studies using the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale is provided in eTable 4 in the Supplement. One
study scored 6 of 6 possible points,40 8 scored 5 of 6 possible
points,19,21,22,24,35,37-39 and the remaining 5 scored 4 of 6 pos-
sible points.20,23,33,34,36 The quality of the studies was most of-
ten compromised by the assessment of outcome; as expected
in research projects, most studies used validated instru-
ments to assess depression without subsequent clinical evalu-
ation. An additional shortcoming in the 5 lower-quality stud-
ies pertained to the self-administered questionnaires used for
the ascertainment of the 2 exposure variables instead of di-
rect interviews.

respondedto13studieswithageatmenopausetreatedasacon-
tinuous variable,20-24,33-40 increasing age at menopause
(2-year increments) was associated with a 2% decrease in the
risk of depression in postmenopausal women (OR, 0.98; 95%

ity analyses as were performed for age at menopause.
Publication Bias
Inthemeta-analysisforageatmenopauseasacontinuousvari-
able, no publication bias was found (P = .83, Egger test). In the
subsequent analyses and sensitivity analyses, publication bias
was not assessed because fewer than 10 studies were in-
cluded, which could potentially hamper the power of this test.
Discussion
An inverse association between the age at menopause, treated
either as a continuous or categorical variable, and the risk of
subsequent depression in postmenopausal women was shown
in this meta-analysis. This effect was retained after control-
ling for premenopausal depression and HT use and was en-
hanced among studies examining the association of age at
menopausewithseveredepressionoramongwomenwithpre-
mature menopause. The same size effect estimate was found
in alternative analyses using the duration of the reproductive
period as an index of exposure to endogenous estrogens.
These findings indicate that a shorter exposure to endog-
enous estrogens that is linked to a longer duration of estro-
gendeficiency,assessedthroughproxyvariables,increasesthe
riskforsubsequentlate-lifedepressionandemphasizestheim-
portance of the neuroprotective and antidepressive proper-
ties of endogenous estrogens. Even though we excluded stud-
ies of women with surgically induced menopause to reduce
confounding by indication, our findings are in accordance with
previousstudiesreportingthatearlymenopauseduetooopho-
rectomy increases the risk of depression later in life.41,42 Older
age at menopause has also been proposed to be an index of
general health associated with lower risk for all-cause and
cardiovascular-specific mortality.43,44 Age at menarche does
not seem to influence the risk of depression in postmeno-
pausalwomen,20,21possiblybecauseitischaracterizedbylower
variance among women compared with age at menopause.45
Thus, discrepancies in age at menarche may not reflect major
differences in total exposure to endogenous estrogens.
The abundance and wide distribution of estrogen recep-
tors across the brain and the association of their genetic poly-
morphisms with late-life depression46 argue for the role of es-
trogens in the modulation of behavioral effects; however, the
exact pathways for their action remain unclear.47 Direct regu-
lation of monoamine neurotransmitter systems that are in-
volved in the pathogenesis of late-life depression, in addition
to modulating actions on neuroplasticity and the hypothala-
mus-pituitary-adrenal axis, could partially mediate the anti-
depressive properties of estrogens.48,49
When considering the underlying pathologic mecha-
nisms,thedifferentdiseasepropertiesbetweenearly-onsetand
late-life depression should be taken into account. Contrary to
depression that occurs at younger ages, increasing evidence
suggests that geriatric depression is more commonly associ-
ated with generalized cerebral abnormalities attributed to vas-
cular dysregulation and neurodegeneration of frontal-
subcortical neural circuits.50-53 Epidemiologic evidence has
shown that an early age at menopause is an independent risk
factor for cardiovascular disease54; in addition, it has been sug-
gested that early menopause or oophorectomy before meno-
pause increases the risk for subsequent cognitive decline and
dementia.55-57 Therefore, the antidepressive effects of longer
exposure to endogenous estrogens could be mediated through
their action against cerebral atherosclerosis and neurodegen-
eration. Experimental studies have demonstrated a neuropro-
tective role of circulating estradiol, which acts in neurons and
glial cells via the intracellular estrogen receptors α and β,14,49
as well as antiatherogenic actions including enhancement of
endothelial function, blockage of smooth muscle cell prolif-
eration, and inhibition of inflammation.58
Regarding the potentially protective effect of estrogen
supplementationforthetreatmentorpreventionofpostmeno-
pausal depression, estrogens and HT—either as monotherapy
or as adjunct therapy—have been reported to improve the out-
comeofperimenopausaldepression59-61asopposedtothefind-
ings for depression in postmenopausal women,62 indicating
a possible window of opportunity during perimenopause for
the effective use of estrogen therapy in depression.63 Given the
results of our study, it remains to be investigated whether
women with menopause at younger ages could benefit by pre-
ventive use of HT against late-life depression, provided that
adverseeffectsassociatedwithlong-termuseareconsidered.64
In this context, the development of estrogen receptor subtype-
specific ligands could decrease the proportion of estrogen
therapy adverse effects.65,66
A major strength of this meta-analysis lies in its sound
methodologic approach according to current guidelines. Fol-
lowing an independent dual screening of more than 12 000 ar-
ticles, rigorous communication with authors of potentially eli-
gible articles was conducted, offering them the opportunity
to deliver raw data for estimation of the individual study ef-
fect estimates (3 studies) so as to maximize the synthesized
evidence. Eventually, the study participants contributing in-
formation in main analyses were more than 67 000 women,
with no significant heterogeneity noticed among included
studies.Mostofthesestudiesusedimportantconfoundingfac-
tors: age, obesity, HT use, smoking, and marital status. Sen-
sitivity analyses were further performed, when possible, to
assess the effect of remaining potential confounding factors,
whereas no publication bias was evident in the age at meno-
pause analysis.
The meta-analysis bears certain inherent limitations
that are mainly attributed to the design and effect estimates
reporting in the included studies. Despite the absence of
significant heterogeneity among the included studies, vari-
able methods for defining depression were used, including
self-reporting. Depression was determined by different cut-
off points; notably, 3 studies used a cutoff point indicating
severe depression, but the rest defined depression by lower
cutoff points. However, the subsequent sensitivity analysis
led to a higher effect among studies examining exclusively
severe depression. Because the severity of depressive disor-
ders seems to be associated with the severity of underlying
cerebral abnormalities,67,68 the differential risk may indicate

a dose-dependent association of duration of exposure
to endogenous estrogens with underlying lesions and
depression.
Given the cross-sectionally derived effect estimates, the
direction of the causality between depression and exposure
variablescannotbeexplored.Historyofpreexisting(premeno-
pausal)depressionshouldbeconsideredsinceitisastrongpre-
dictor of late-life depression69,70 and has been associated with
earlier menopause and ovarian aging.71,72 To limit this draw-
back, a subanalysis of studies controlling for past depression
was conducted, indicating that the observed inverse associa-
tion of a later menopausal transition with postmenopausal de-
pression remained significant.
Moreover, given the potential effect of exogenous estro-
gen on depression risk, the inclusion of current or past HT us-
ers in most of the studies may have influenced our findings.
Although most of the included studies adjusted for HT use and
a sensitivity analysis restricted to studies controlling for this
factor did not materially change the results, there is a possi-
bility for residual confounding; only studies excluding HT us-
ers could sufficiently control for this factor.
An additional limitation involves the self-reporting of age
at menopause contrasted to determination by direct inter-
view. This difference may have nominally lowered the qual-
ity of several eligible studies, whereas the retrospectively elic-
ited information in different time periods after menopause has
potentially led to differential recall bias.73 Self-recalled age at
menopause has been reported in one study to be in satisfac-
tory agreement with gynecologic medical records,74 but this
assertion cannot preclude recall bias. This finding is of par-
ticular importance when considering that women recruited by
eligiblestudiespotentiallystartedHTusebeforetheirlastmen-
struation, making it cumbersome to determine the time of
menopause. We attempted to assess heterogeneity regarding
ageatmenopausedefinitionthroughasensitivityanalysiscon-
fined to the 7 studies using the internationally accepted defi-
nition of 1 year after the last menstruation; the results re-
mained essentially unchanged.
Because not all studies controlled for factors affecting life-
time estrogen exposure, including oral contraceptive use,
breastfeeding, and number of pregnancies, residual confound-
ing may remain an issue; the paucity of data in the published
studies did not allow for meta-regression analyses. Similarly,
none of the studies controlled for autoimmune diseases, and
no meta-regression analyses could be conducted for cogni-
tion, cardiovascular disease, and psychological parameters,
such as stressful experiences. Another limitation is that sta-
tistical power of the conducted subanalyses may have been
hampered by the low number of included studies. Finally, par-
ticipants in most of the studies were from Western commu-
nities, pointing to the need for more ethnically diverse popu-
lations and more generalizable findings given the geographic
discrepancies in the timing of menopause.75
Conclusions
This meta-analysis suggests a potentially protective effect of
increasing duration of exposure to endogenous estrogens as
assessed by age at menopause as well as by the duration of the
reproductive period. The findings provide epidemiologic sup-
port for the involvement of estrogen deficiency in the patho-
physiology of late-life depression. If confirmed in prospec-
tive and culturally diverse studies controlling for potential
confounders and assessing depression via psychiatric evalu-
ation, these findings could have a significant clinical effect by
allowing for the identification of a group of women at higher
risk for depression who may benefit from psychiatric moni-
toringorestrogen-basedtherapies.Basedonthosedata,health
care professionals and health policy planners may recognize
the extent of depression in the menopausal group and plan
accordingly for treatment.
