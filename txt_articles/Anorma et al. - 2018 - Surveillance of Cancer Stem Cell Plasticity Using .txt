ABSTRACT: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are progenitor cells that contribute to treatment-resistant phenotypes during relapse.
CSCs exist in specific tissue microenvironments that cell cultures and more complex models cannot mimic. Therefore, the
development of new approaches that can detect CSCs and report on specific properties (e.g., stem cell plasticity) in their native
environment have profound implications for studying CSC biology. Herein, we present AlDeSense, a turn-on fluorescent probe
for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and Ctrl-AlDeSense, a matching nonresponsive reagent. Although ALDH1A1
contributes to the detoxification of reactive aldehydes, it is also associated with stemness and is highly elevated in CSCs.
AlDeSense exhibits a 20-fold fluorescent enhancement when treated with ALDH1A1. Moreover, we established that AlDeSense
is selective against a panel of common ALDH isoforms and exhibits exquisite chemostability against a collection of biologically
relevant species. Through the application of surface marker antibody staining, tumorsphere assays, and assessment of
tumorigenicity, we demonstrate that cells exhibiting high AlDeSense signal intensity have properties of CSCs. Using these
probes in tandem, we have identified CSCs at the cellular level via flow cytometry and confocal imaging, as well as monitored
their states in animal models.
■ INTRODUCTION
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) were first discovered in human acute
myelogenous leukemia1 and have since been identified in
breast cancer, glioblastoma, multiple myeloma, gastric cancer,
pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer, among others.2 CSCs
have an increased capacity to activate antiapoptotic and pro-
survival pathways, as well as to overexpress ATP-binding
cassette transporters which act as potent efflux pumps to
extrude small molecules (e.g., chemotherapeutics) from the
cancer cells.3,4 As such, conventional chemotherapeutics can
inadvertently lead to an enrichment of CSCs by killing non-
CSCs, which in turn contributes to the emergence of highly
aggressive and treatment-resistant phenotypes during relapse.5
Unfortunately, the behavior of CSCs, especially in an in vivo
context, is insufficiently understood despite the availability of
cell cultures and three-dimensional (3D) models. A major
drawback of these systems is that they cannot mimic the
complex microenvironment where CSCs are thought to reside.
Moreover, CSCs are rare and represent only a small fraction of

 cells within a tumor. CSCs also exist in a dynamic equilibrium
between undifferentiated and differentiated states,6 which is
modulated by specific properties of the tumor microenviron-
ment (e.g., hypoxia), as well as interactions with a network of
cells, signaling molecules, and the extracellular matrix.7−9 Thus,
methods that can be employed to not only detect CSCs but
also to report on specific in vivo properties such as stem cell
plasticity are highly desirable. One approach to image CSCs is
to target CSC surface biomarkers with a reporter (e.g., optical
dye) conjugated to an antibody.10 However, this can lead to
off-target binding11 and uneven or incomplete staining because
antibody−dye conjugates cannot readily permeate into tumor
regions distal from blood vasculature.12,13 Alternatively,
genetically engineered CSCs expressing fluorescent proteins
(e.g., GFP) or luciferase bioluminescent constructs can
facilitate lineage tracing experiments.14−16 Major limitations
are that it can only be used to visualize CSCs that have been
previously isolated, transfected, and reintroduced into an
animal model, but not all cell types are amenable to genetic
manipulation.
In contrast, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), in partic-
ular, the 1A1 isoform, is believed to be a reliable marker of
CSCs across many cancer types, including prostate, lung,
breast, esophageal, and ovarian cancers.17−22 In these
instances, ALDH1A1 is associated with treatment resistance
and poor clinical outcome. In addition to ALDH1A1, there are
18 other ALDH isoforms in humans, many of which display
promiscuous and overlapping substrate scopes with ALDH1A1
when catalyzing the oxidation of endogenous and xenobiotic
aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acid products.23,24
Although challenging, the development of a selective activity-
based fluorescent probe for ALDH1A1 would enable detection
of CSCs, as well as concurrently report on their degree of
stemness. In this regard, there is a gradient of ALDH1A1
activity ranging from high in CSCs to low in differentiated
cancer cells (infra vide). Several probes have been developed
for
ALDH,
including
BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde
(BAAA).25−27 However, these examples suffer from major
drawbacks. Because BAAA is equally fluorescent compared to
its turned-over carboxylate product, CSCs are identified based
on their ability to retain the BAAA product relative to the
unactivated probe using efflux pump inhibitors. Additionally,
an ALDH inhibitor (i.e., N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB)) must also be used in tandem to distinguish between
signal from ALDH activity and nonspecific accumulation in
cells.28,29 While these are useful tools for isolating CSCs from
solid tumors and cell cultures, introduction of efflux pump and
ALDH inhibitors to live animals will have unintended
consequences. More importantly, BAAA exhibits cross-
reactivity with several ALDH isoforms rendering the

 interpretation of experimental results challenging.18,30,31 Here-
in, we describe the development of a highly selective, activity-
based fluorescent probe to target elevated ALDH1A1 in CSCs.
Through the application of established protocols that include
identifying CSC surface markers, cultivation of tumorspheres,
and assessment of tumorigenicity, we provide evidence that the
brightest AlDeSense cells possess CSC properties. Finally, we
employ our probe to monitor CSC plasticity in a tumor model
using live mice.
■ RESULTS
Design and Synthesis of AlDeSense. Our ALDH1A1
probe, AlDeSense, is based on the photostable Pennsylvania
Green dye platform and is equipped with a pendant
benzaldehyde moiety (Figure 1a).32 Electron deficient aryl
groups such as benzaldehyde can attenuate fluorescence via the
donor-photoinduced electron transfer (d-PeT) quenching
mechanism.33,34 This provides the desired signal enhancement
upon conversion to the unquenched carboxylic acid by
ALDH1A1. We rationally selected the Pennsylvania Green
scaffold because at physiological pH it is negatively charged
(apparent pKa = 4.81). The negative charge on the dye is
expected to negate the need for efflux pump inhibitors because
the turned-over product will be dianionic and less able to cross
the cell membrane.35 The low pKa serves a second purpose
since it can presumably form an ionic interaction with His-293
located at the entrance of the active site (Figure S1).36 This
imparts selectivity against isoforms such as ALDH1A3 where
the corresponding His residue is not present.37−39 As predicted
by the literature, the benzaldehyde moiety will also augment
isoform selectivity, since benzaldehydes are better substrates
for ALDH1A1 than many of the other ALDH isoforms.40
Despite the fact that AlDeSense is weakly fluorescent until
activated, nonspecific staining can still contribute to mis-
identification of non-CSC populations. To account for this and
circumvent the need for ALDH inhibitors, we developed Ctrl-
AlDeSense, a nonresponsive matching control reagent (Figure
1b). Although Ctrl-AlDeSense is structurally similar to
AlDeSense and displays nearly identical physical properties,
replacing the benzaldehyde moiety with an acetophenone
group renders it unreactive to ALDH1A1 (Figure 1c, Figures
S2 and S3).
The synthesis of AlDeSense involved DIBAL reduction of
methyl 4-bromo-3-methylbenzoate 1 to afford the correspond-
ing benzyl alcohol , which was protected with tert-butyldime-
thylsilyl chloride to give 2 in 93% yield over two steps. Lithium
halogen exchange enabled coupling to MEM-protected
difluoroxanthone 3 giving the Pennsylvania Green intermedi-
ate 4 in 48% yield after acid mediated global deprotection. IBX
oxidation of the benzyl alcohol then afforded AlDeSense in
79% yield. Preparation of AlDeSense AM, a cell permeable
derivative, could be achieved via alkylation of AlDeSense with
bromomethyl acetate in 60% yield (Scheme 1). Once
internalized, intracellular esterases can hydrolyze the AM
group to afford the parent AlDeSense reagent. The synthesis of
Ctrl-AlDeSense involved similar chemistry, and the details can
be found in the Supporting Information. Of note, both
AlDeSense and AlDeSense AM will herein be referred to as
AlDeSense for simplicity. AM protected versions were utilized
for all cellular and animal studies.
In Vitro Characterization. With AlDeSense in hand, we
first evaluated its response to purified ALDH1A1. Prior to
activation, AlDeSense was weakly fluorescent (ΦF = 0.04);
however, addition of ALDH1A1 resulted in a robust ∼20-fold
fluorescent enhancement (Figure 1d). Inhibition of ALDH1A1
with DEAB completely abolished the turn-on response, and
the resulting fluorescent signal was comparable to that of Ctrl-
AlDeSense (Figures 1e and S4). Next, we screened for
potential cross-reactivity against a panel of the most common
ALDH isoforms and found that only ALDH1A1 led to probe
activation (Figures 1f and S5). To ensure that AlDeSense is
only activated by ALDH1A1 when in cells, we assessed
potential off-target responses against various biologically
relevant analytes. Although aldehyde groups are prone to
oxidation, we did not observe any oxidized fluorescent
products when screened against a panel of reactive oxygen
species (Figure 1g). Similarly, when AlDeSense was incubated
with various thiols and amines, we did not detect formation of
fluorescent hemithioacetal41,42 and Schiff base43 products,
respectively (Figure 1g). We also established that AlDeSense,
its turned-over product, and the control reagent are nontoxic
using standard cell viability assays (Figure S6). Moreover, LC-
MS shows that AM deprotection, as well as ALDH1A1-
catalyzed oxidation occurs upon cell uptake (Figure S7).
Together, these key experiments indicate that AlDeSense is
suitable for detecting ALDH1A1 activity in living systems.
Detection of ALDH1A1 Activity in K562 Cells. To
investigate the ALDH1A1 sensing capabilities of AlDeSense in
cell culture, we utilized the K562 human chronic myeloid
leukemia cell line, which is known to exhibit high overall
ALDH activity.44 We hypothesized that AlDeSense can be
used to stratify these cells based on ALDH1A1 activity and
that the brightest cells would exhibit CSC markers. First, using
flow cytometry analysis, we found that K562 cells stained with
AlDeSense are significantly brighter compared to those treated
with either AlDeSense with an inhibitor or Ctrl-AlDeSense
(Figures 2a−c and S8). We also identified a population of
AlDeSense positive cells that exhibits the CD34+/CD38-
profile characteristic of leukemic stem cells. The relative
proportion of these cells increased when K562 cells were
cultured under an environment low in oxygen (Figure S9).
Exposure to hypoxia is a common condition to enrich for
CSCs.45,46 We also assessed the utility of AlDeSense for
confocal fluorescence imaging, which in contrast to flow

 cytometry, requires less sample and allows for visual assess-
ment of cell morphology (Figure 2d). First, we determined the
subcellular staining pattern of AlDeSense. ALDH1A1 is a
cytoplasmic enzyme, and therefore, AlDeSense should not be
localized to organelles such as the mitochondria where other
ALDH isoforms (e.g., ALDH2) are present at high abundance.
Co-staining with organelle-specific trackers revealed that
AlDeSense did in fact stain the cytoplasm and was not
extensively localized to various organelles (Figures S10 and
S11). After several minutes, a small population of highly
fluorescent cells began to emerge owing to ALDH1A1-
mediated activation of our probe. Treatment with an ALDH
inhibitor as well as ALDH1A1-specific siRNA knockdown
confirmed that ALDH1A1 is responsible for the fluorescence
enhancement (Figures 2g, S12, S13). Further confirmation of
in cellulo selectivity was obtained by comparing K562 cells
with HEK293T cells, an ALDH1A1 negative cell line (Figure
S14).47 Cells treated with Ctrl-AlDeSense allowed us to
establish baseline microscope settings which account for
fluorescence due to accumulation of dye (Figure S15).
Applying these settings to the AlDeSense-stained population,
any cell which shows fluorescence above baseline can only be
due to the ALDH1A1-catalyzed turnover of AlDeSense (Figure
2d−f). Of note, the brightest cells also displayed the CD34+/
CD38-/CD133+ leukemic stem cell profile (Figure S16),
suggesting that AlDeSense was being activated to the greatest
extent in putative CSCs.
Identification of CSCs in Cell Culture Using AlDe-
Sense. Next, we sought to determine whether our probe
would yield greater fluorescence in CSCs obtained using two
different enrichment strategies. First, we used the well-
established mammosphere assay to cultivate MDA-MB-231
CSCs by growing cells in low serum conditions on non-
adherent plates.48 Under these conditions, non-CSCs die off,
leaving individual CSCs to proliferate into spherical structures.
Mammospheres as well as tumorspheres derived from other
cancer types have been shown to generate cells with nearly all
known CSC characteristicssuch as increased in vivo
tumorigenicity, invasiveness, metastasis rates, EMT transition,
and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Thus, they are widely
used to study CSCs and develop CSC-specific therapeutics.49
Mammospheres stained with AlDeSense were 3-fold brighter
than those stained with Ctrl-AlDeSense, showing increased
levels of ALDH1A1 activity in the mammospheres. In addition,
transferring the mammospheres to normal cell culture media
and allowing them to differentiate led to a gradual decrease of
AlDeSense signal over 36 h, demonstrating that AlDeSense can
be used to monitor CSC differentiation (Figure 3a−e).
For the second model in our study, we chose to enrich CSCs
using a protocol recently published by Kilian and co-workers,50
where they reported that B16F0 melanoma cells cultured on a
spiral-patterned hydrogel platform to mimic mechanical
properties of the tumor microenvironment gave rise to cells
that displayed increased CSC marker expression (e.g.,
CD271), as well as metastatic potency and tumorigenicity.
Only a small fraction of the B16F0 cells cultured under
standard conditions were identified to exhibit elevated
ALDH1A1 activity via flow cytometry and confocal imaging
using AlDeSense. However, when the cells enriched in CSCs
via the patterned platform (herein referred as e-CSCs) were
treated with AlDeSense, they were 11.3-fold brighter than
those grown under standard conditions (referred herein as
non-CSCs). e-CSCs treated with AlDeSense were also 9.0-fold
brighter than e-CSCs treated with Ctrl-AlDeSense, demon-
strating that the signal was due to ALDH1A1 (Figure 3f−j).
Flow cytometry analysis revealed that e-CSCs displayed
colocalization of AlDeSense with CD271, a commonly used
melanoma stem cell marker, when compared to non-CSCs
(Figure S17).51,52
Ex Vivo Imaging of ALDH1A1 Activity in e-CSCs. We
subsequently sought to visualize ALDH1A1 activity in e-CSCs
introduced into whole animal models. First, we intravenously
injected either e-CSCs or non-CSCs into mice via the tail vein
to generate metastatic lesions in the lung. Immunocompetent
mice were used with this syngeneic cell line because the
immune system is known to influence the tumor micro-
environment and hence properties of CSCs in vivo.11 Since e-
CSCs lost many of the stem cell-related properties within 5
days after they were replated on glass slides,50 it was essential
to determine whether ALDH1A1 activity was maintained after

 CSCs were introduced into a living system. Specifically, can
metastatic niches be established within this time frame before
differentiation takes place? We hypothesized that if e-CSCs
retained their stemness, the AlDeSense signal would be higher
for e-CSC lungs compared to non-CSC lungs. At various time
points during tumor progression (day 7 and 11) mice were
sacrificed, their lungs were removed and perfused with
solutions of either AlDeSense or Ctrl-AlDeSense (Figure
4a−d). When stained with AlDeSense, the fluorescence of the
e-CSC-treated lungs was indeed higher than the signal from
non-CSC-treated lungs (Figure 4e). However, it is possible
that e-CSCs simply gave rise to larger metastatic lesions which
could uptake more dye, leading to increased fluorescence
intensity. To resolve this, we compared the signal of e-CSC
and non-CSC lungs stained with Ctrl-AlDeSense and found
that they were not statistically different, allowing us to
confidently rule out this as a possibility (Figure 4f). Moreover,
e-CSC lungs also had a higher signal from AlDeSense versus
Ctrl-AlDeSense (Figure 4g). On the other hand, differences in
intensity were not observed between AlDeSense and Ctrl-
AlDeSense in lungs with non-CSC metastases (Figure 4h).
Results from days 7 and 11 showed consistent patterns (Figure
S18). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the e-
CSCs continue to have higher ALDH1A1 activity levels after
introduction into a living system, and that AlDeSense in
conjunction with Ctrl-AlDeSense can be used to identify e-
CSCs exhibiting this activity.

 In Vivo Imaging of ALDH1A1 Activity in e-CSCs
Implanted into Live Animals. With this information in
hand, we then evaluated the tumorigenicity of e-CSCs and the
corresponding performance of AlDeSense in a live animal
model. Allografts in BALB/c mice were generated via the
subcutaneous injection of e-CSCs and non-CSCs into the right
and left flanks, respectively. Tumors were monitored and
imaged up to 2 weeks using a whole-body fluorescence imager
following an intratumoral injection of AlDeSense or Ctrl-
AlDeSense. Results revealed a consistently higher signal from
AlDeSense in the e-CSCs versus non-CSCs tumors (Figure
5a−c) at both 1 and 2 weeks. Ctrl-AlDeSense, on the other
hand, did not show increased signal from the e-CSC tumor and
had much lower signal over all. This demonstrates that
AlDeSense can be used to image ALDH1A1 activity in vivo,
and more importantly that e-CSCs retained high ALDH1A1
activity after implantation and induction of tumorigenesis.
Moreover, consistent with higher tumorgenicity, implantation
of e-CSCs into mice yielded larger, more aggressive tumors
compared to non-CSCs (Figure 5d).
■ DISCUSSION
In conclusion, we have developed AlDeSense, a powerful new
turn-on fluorescent reagent optimized for the detection of
CSCs and monitoring of stem cell plasticity via ALDH1A1
activity. Unactivated AlDeSense is weakly fluorescent owing to
d-PeT quenching from the pendant benzaldehyde moiety;
however, the fluorescence signal is enhanced by nearly 20-fold
upon oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid product by
ALDH1A1. Importantly, we did not observe cross-reactivity
with any of the other ALDH isoforms tested. This selectivity
can be attributed to benzaldehyde being a better substrate for
ALDH1A1 and a crucial ionic interaction that we postulate to
be forming between the negatively charged dye scaffold and a
positively charged His residue at the entrance of the
ALDH1A1 active site. Attempts to elucidate the exact nature
of this selectivity by cocrystallizing AlDeSense and ALDH1A1
were unsuccessful. The interaction between the active site
cysteine residue (Cys-302) and AlDeSense results in a dynamic
equilibrium between the aldehyde and hemithioacetal forms
which creates too much disorder for crystallographic visual-
ization of the complex. Nevertheless, the exquisite selectivity of
AlDeSense for ALDH1A1 over other isoforms, as well as its
excellent chemoselectivity against a panel of biologically
relevant analytes ensures that any signal above the background
established using Ctrl-AlDeSense is due to ALDH1A1 activity.
This property offers unique advantages over existing
approaches such as those that involve antibody-dye conjugates
for CSC imaging. Dyes that are appended to antibodies
targeting CSCs are always in a fluorescent “on” state, meaning
background signal will be high. In contrast, AlDeSense is
weakly fluorescent until it is activated by ALDH1A1, and any
nonspecific staining can be readily accounted for by employing
the matching control reagent (Ctrl-AlDeSense). Another
advantage is that our probe is compatible with many cancer
cell types because elevated ALDH1A1 activity is a general
property of CSCs. In contrast, CSC surface biomarkers are
unique to specific cancers but are often ill-defined and
heterogeneously displayed. Because AlDeSense is cell-perme-
able and acts intracellularly, it does not directly interfere with
native cell-surface processes through formation of tight-binding
antibody−antigen interactions, offering yet another advantage.
Finally, AlDeSense will only activate if CSCs are viable because
ALDH1A1 depends on availability of NADH. In contrast,
CSCs that are no longer living can still display surface
biomarkers. In comparison to BAAA, a nonselective
commercial reagent designed to also target ALDH activity,
AlDeSense is selective for only the ALDH1A1 isoform. BAAA
on the other hand has been shown to react with a variety of
isoforms, including ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, and
ALDH4A1, both in previous reports18,30,31 and under our
own examination (Figure S19). Furthermore, AlDeSense is a
turn-on probe that localizes in the cytosol, while BAAA is
accumulation-based and localizes to the ER and mitochondria
(Figure S20). This means that unlike BAAA, AlDeSense does
not require either ALDH or efflux pump inhibitors to
selectively label CSCs and will not show false positives from
mitochondrially-located ALDH isoforms, such as ALDH2.
Owing to the unique imaging capabilities of AlDeSense,
CSCs enriched using various approaches can be imaged via
confocal microscopy to approximate the degree of stemness
versus the extent of differentiation. Indeed, we have
demonstrated in this study through the application of surface
marker antibody staining, tumorsphere assays, and assessment
of tumorigenicity, that cells exhibiting high AlDeSense signal
intensity have properties of CSCs. For both chronic
myelogenous leukemia and melanoma, cells exhibiting the
CSC markers CD34+/CD38-/CD133+ and CD271, respec-
tively, were among the brightest cells when stained with
AlDeSense. In addition to costaining with antibodies, we also

 generated CSC-enriched mammospheres and showed that they
displayed elevated ALDH1A1 activity. We also observed a
decrease in ALDH1A1 activity by allowing the mammospheres
to differentiate over time, demonstrating that AlDeSense could
be used as a tool to monitor CSC plasticity. Lastly, we used
AlDeSense to assess CSC plasticity after introduction into
living systems.
Prior to this study, it was unknown whether e-CSCs would
retain properties of stemness such as high ALDH1A1 activity
after introduction into a living system. Our imaging experi-
ments demonstrate that ALDH1A1 activity persists up to
several weeks in e-CSCs after they are introduced into a living
animal, implicating that a niche must be established that
supports this population of cells. Current efforts will focus on
employing AlDeSense to determine parameters of the tumor
microenvironment that govern the transition from a differ-
entiated to CSC state and vice versa. Future work will be
focused on two fronts. First, we will develop red-shifted
congeners to enable higher resolution imaging of CSCs in
deeper tissues. Second, we will generate selective probes for
other ALDH isoforms such as ALDH1A3 that are also believed
to be linked to stemness. Beyond leading to a greater
understanding of fundamental CSC biology, we envision that
AlDeSense and other ALDH activity-based probes can be
utilized as powerful prognostic indicators and assist in the
development of CSC-specific chemotherapeutics.

charged with methyl 4-bromo-3-methylbenzoate (11.5 g, 50.0
mmol, 1.00 equiv) and anhydrous CH2Cl2 (100 mL). A flame-
dried addition funnel was attached to the flask and the system
was flushed with nitrogen. The reaction was cooled to 0 °C
and treated with 1.0 M DIBAL-H in CH2Cl2 (110 mL, 110
mmol, 2.2 equiv) via funnel addition over 23 min. The reaction
was allowed to warm to room temperature. After stirring at
room temperature for 4 h, the reaction was cooled to 0 °C and
quenched via the slow addition of H2O (5 mL), 1 M NaOH (5
mL), and additional H2O (30 mL). The resulting emulsion was
poured over filter paper and washed with CH2Cl2. The
organics were combined, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude residue was eluted through
a silica plug and concentrated to afford a light-yellow oil which
was used without further purification. A solution of this
intermediate in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was treated with
imidazole (6.8 g, 100 mmol, 2.0 equiv) and tert-butyldime-
thylsilyl chloride (8.2 g, 55 mmol, 1.1 equiv). After overnight
stirring, the reaction was filtered and washed with CH2Cl2. The
filtrate was collected, washed with aqueous NH4Cl, and
concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was
purified via flash chromatography on a silica column (2:98 v/v
EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound (14.6 g, 46.3
mmol, 92.6% yield over two-steps beginning from methyl 4-
bromo-3-methylbenzoate). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ

round-bottom flask was charged with 2 (0.348 g, 1.1 mmol,
1.1 equiv) and anhydrous THF (5 mL). The reaction was
cooled to −78 °C and treated with 1.4 M sec-butyllithium in
cyclohexane (0.9 mL, 1.1 mmol, 1.1 equiv). The reaction was
stirred at the same temperature for 30 min and then treated
with a solution of 3 (0.440 g, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in
anhydrous THF (5 mL). The reaction was stirred at the same
temperature for 2 h. The reaction was warmed to room
temperature and treated with 1.0 M aq. HCl (6.0 mL, 6.0
mmol, 6.0 equiv). The reaction was warmed to 50 °C and
stirred for 4 h. The reaction was concentrated under a vacuum
to remove the THF and cyclohexane. The remaining mixture
was poured over filter paper, washed with H2O (100 mL) and
CH2Cl2 (100 mL), and vacuum-dried to yield the title
compound as a red-orange solid (0.176 g, 0.483 mmol,

AlDeSense. A round-bottom flask was charged with 4
(0.368 g, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv), IBX (0.336 g, 1.2 mmol, 1.2
equiv), and DMSO (10 mL). After being stirred for 3 h at
room temperature, the reaction was quenched via the addition
of brine (100 mL). The resulting mixture was poured over
filter paper and vacuum-dried. The red solid was suspended in
H2O (200 mL) and heated to 80 °C. After stirring for 2 h, the
reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured over
filter paper and vacuum-dried to yield the title compound as a

ALDH Isoform Activity Assays. The activity of each
isoform of ALDH was confirmed by monitoring the
production of NADH at 340 nm when incubated with the
most commonly used substrate for that enzyme (propionalde-
hyde for ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3, ALDH2, and
ALDH4A1; benzaldehyde for ALDH3A1, and succinic semi-
aldehyde for ALDH5A1). Each isoform was diluted with 50
mM triethanolamine (TEA, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of
1 μM and placed in a 1 mL quartz cuvette. Directly before
measurement, NAD+ was added to final concentration of 2.5
mM, and the preferred substrate was added to a final
concentration of 1 mM. Absorbance spectra were taken from
300 to 500 nm every half minute for 15 min. Units of activity
for each enzyme were calculated from the slope of absorbance
increase at 340 nm over time, (1 unit = 1 μmol substrate
turned over/ μmol enzyme/min).
AlDeSense Isoform Selectivity Assay. Activation of
AlDeSense was assessed using 20 units of each ALDH isoform.
Activity was determined by activity measurements using each
isoform’s preferred substrate (1 unit = 1 μmol substrate turned
over/μmol enzyme/min). Further details are in the Supporting
Information. All enzymatic reactions were performed in 50
mM triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.4, Thermo Fisher) with 2.5
mM NAD+ (Alfa Aesar) and 5% v/v DMSO (Thermo Fisher)
in a 1 mL quartz cuvette at room temperature.
AlDeSense activation was determined using fluorescence.
Immediately before measurement, AlDeSense (1 μM) was
added to a quartz cuvette. After vigorous mixing, the reaction
was monitored at room temperature for 15 min. Fluorescence
spectra were acquired according to following parameters: λex =
498 nm, and emission range = 505−580 nm. All scans were
normalized to the signal from AlDeSense in 50 mM TEA and
2.5 mM NAD+ (without enzyme). End point measurements at
15 min were performed in triplicate and reported as the
averages ± standard deviation.
Inhibition of ALDH1A1. ALDH1A1 (100 nM) in 50 mM
TEA (pH 7.4) was incubated with 2.5 mM NAD+.
Immediately before measurement, 4-diethylaminobenzalde-
hyde (DEAB) in 95% ethanol was added for a final
concentration of 100 nM. The reaction was initiated with
the addition of AlDeSense (1 μM). The solution was mixed
with vigorous pipetting and fluorescence spectra were
acquired. Fluorescence spectra were acquired according to
following parameters: λex = 498 nm, and emission range =
505−580 nm. Scans were taken periodically for up to 30 min.
The reaction proceeded at room temperature throughout the
experiment. All scans were normalized to the peak of
AlDeSense in 50 mM TEA and 2.5 mM NAD+ without the
addition of enzyme.
siRNA Knockdown of ALDH1A1. K562 cells were grown
to ∼70% confluency in a poly-L-lysine (Trevigen) coated Nunc
Lab-Tek 8-well Chamber Slide system (Thermo Scientific) 1
day before treatment with siRNA. Both the negative control
scrambled siRNA (Sigma-Aldrich, MISSION siRNA Universal
Negative Control #1) as well as the ALDH1A1 siRNA (Sigma-
Aldrich, SASI_Hs01_00244056) was applied at 50 μM
concentrations following the Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo
Fisher) protocol for a 24-well plate. 0.75 μL of the
Lipofectamine 3000 reagent was used per sample. After
treatment, cells incubated with the siRNA in Opti-MEM
(Gibco) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 8 h. At this point, the Opti-
MEM was removed and replaced with full growth media
(IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS). Cells were incubated
further at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h before imaging on the Zeiss
LSM 700 confocal. To stain the cells with each imaging
reagent, 1 μL of 2 mM AlDeSense AM in DMSO was used per
1 mL of serum-free media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with
15 μM HEPES). Growth media was removed from the cells
and replaced with the premixed dye solution. Cell staining
continued for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C), after
which the cells were immediately imaged. The optical
configuration was optimized for the scrambled siRNA samples
and the same optical settings were used for all images.
Mammosphere Culture and Imaging. Mammosphere
formation from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was
performed as described previously with some modifications.
Cells were resuspended and diluted to a density of 2000 cells/
mL in DMEM/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2%
B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher), 40 ng/mL rhFGF-2
(Miltenyi Biotec), and 20 ng/mL rhEGF (Gibco). They
were plated in ultralow attachment six-well plates (Corning)
and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 days or until most
mammospheres were between 60 and 100 nm. At this point,
the mammospheres were transferred to a four-well chamber
slide coated with Poly-L-lysine as described previously. The
mammospheres were then either immediately imaged with
AlDeSense or Ctrl-AlDeSense, or the media was exchanged
with full DMEM media supplement with 10% FBS and
nonessential amino acids to allow differentiation over 36 h.
At various time points, the mammospheres were stained
with 2 μM AlDeSense or Ctrl-AlDeSense as described above.
Staining continued for 1 h at room temperature before imaging
with a wide field fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert
200M). A GFP filter set was used to excite the fluorophores.
Exposure times were set equally for all images taken within a
data set and configured to give low signal in Ctrl-AlDeSense
stained tumorspheres. Only mammospheres greater than 50
μm in diameter were considered in the analysis.
B16F0Melanoma Confocal Imaging. B16F0 murine
melanoma cells were cultured for 5 days on polyacrylamide
hydrogels with or without spiral patterns as described
previously.18 The coverslips on which the hydrogels and cells
were mounted were transferred to a glass-bottomed dish for
confocal imaging, leaving the cells intact. Solutions of either 2
μM AlDeSense AM or 2 μM Ctrl-AlDeSense AM in PBS were
added to the two types of cells. The cells were incubated at
room temperature for 1 h and then immediately imaged.
Confocal imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM700 Confocal
Microscope, utilizing the 488 nm laser line to excite AlDeSense
AM and the 20X/0.8 objective. Three different coverslips of
cells were imaged for each set of conditions and at least six
images were taken for each coverslip. Using ImageJ, ROIs were
drawn around areas covered with cells and mean fluorescence
values were measured for each image.
Ex Vivo Lung Metastases Imaging. Six- to eight-week-
old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory. Experimental metastases were established by
injecting 2 × 105 melanoma cells via lateral tail vein injection.
Mice were euthanized at either 7 or 11 days post injection.
Immediately after euthanization, their lungs were excised and

 perfused with about 1 mL of either 15 μM AlDeSense AM or
15 μM Ctrl-AlDeSense AM in PBS. Outer portions of the
lungs were rinsed in 15 mL of PBS to remove blood or excess
dyes. After 2 h incubation at room temperature (25 °C), the
lungs were imaged on the IVIS spectrum imaging system
(PerkinElmer). Data were processed using Living Image
software (Version 4.1).
In Vivo Melanoma Tumor Fluorescence Imaging. All
in vivo imaging experiments were performed with the approval
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Illinois at Urbana−Champaign. Six- to eight-
week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory for the tumor imaging experiment. Primary
localized tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting
B16F0 cells (5 × 105 cells in 100 μL of Hanks’ balanced salt
solution per injection). For each animal, cells that were grown
on patterned gels were injected on the right lateral flank and
cells grown on nonpatterned gels were injected on the left
lateral flank. At 1 and 2 weeks, mice were intravenously
injected with either 15 μM AlDeSense or Ctrl-AlDeSense.
After 24 h, the mice were imaged using an IVIS spectrum
imaging system for epifluorescence in conjunction with a CT
scan. Data was processed using Living Image software (Version
4.1).
