A
rm weakness is common after stroke, and its treatment is 
recognized as an area of considerable need.1 Approximately 
85% of patients with stroke present with arm weakness,2 and 
60% of stroke survivors with nonfunctional arms at 1 week do 
not recover function by 6 months.3 Current treatment for arm 
weakness typically comprises intensive, task-specific, and 
repetitive rehabilitative interventions or occasionally meth-
ods such as constraint-induced movement therapy and electric 
neurostimulation.4 A recent meta-analysis and large-scale tri-
als show the effects of current treatments for arm weakness to 
be modest.5,6 Novel and more effective treatments are needed. 
Improvement in arm function should improve quality of life for 
stroke survivors, reduce comorbidities associated with loss of 
independence, and reduce cost to the healthcare system.7
Intensive training has been shown to facilitate a range of 
neuroplastic brain events.8 It is possible that augmentation of 
Background and Purpose—Recent animal studies demonstrate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with movement 
induces movement-specific plasticity in motor cortex and improves forelimb function after stroke. We conducted a 
randomized controlled clinical pilot study of VNS paired with rehabilitation on upper-limb function after ischemic stroke.
Methods—Twenty-one participants with ischemic stroke >6 months before and moderate to severe upper-limb impairment 
were randomized to VNS plus rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone. Rehabilitation consisted of three 2-hour sessions per 
week for 6 weeks, each involving >400 movement trials. In the VNS group, movements were paired with 0.5-second 
VNS. The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility. Secondary end points included change in upper-limb 
measures (including the Fugl–Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity).
Results—Nine participants were randomized to VNS plus rehabilitation and 11 to rehabilitation alone. There were no serious 
adverse device effects. One patient had transient vocal cord palsy and dysphagia after implantation. Five had minor adverse 
device effects including nausea and taste disturbance on the evening of therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the change 
in Fugl–Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity scores was not significantly different (between-group difference, 5.7 points; 
95% confidence interval, −0.4 to 11.8). In the per-protocol analysis, there was a significant difference in change in Fugl–
Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity score (between-group difference, 6.5 points; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 12.6).
Conclusions—This study suggests that VNS paired with rehabilitation is feasible and has not raised safety concerns. 
Additional studies of VNS in adults with chronic stroke will now be performed.

neuroplasticity to promote reorganization of neural networks 
is required to more fully recover motor function.9 However, 
no practical and effective method exists to achieve this and 
even if such changes occur, it is unclear whether they are clin-
ically meaningful or long term. This study is a preliminary 
investigation of an intervention designed to promote spe-
cific neuroplasticity; vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired 
with movement to drive task-specific plasticity in the motor 
cortex.10–12 VNS activates neurons in the basal forebrain and 
locus coeruleus and results in release of acetylcholine and 
norepinephrine, respectively, which are known to facilitate 
reorganization of cortical networks.13 We recently demon-
strated in a rat model of ischemic stroke that pairing forelimb 
rehabilitation with VNS significantly increases recovery of 
forelimb speed and strength when compared with rehabilita-
tion alone.14,15 Our subsequent studies demonstrated that VNS 
paired with rehabilitative training also improves recovery in 
a rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage,16 and that precise 
timing of VNS with specific motor movements yields optimal 
recovery.17
We hypothesize that VNS paired with upper-limb reha-
bilitation therapy will result in greater recovery of arm func-
tion than rehabilitation alone in adults with chronic ischemic 
stroke. We performed the first-in-human evaluation of VNS 
paired with upper-limb rehabilitation after ischemic stroke. 
The main objective of the study was to evaluate the safety 
and feasibility of paired VNS therapy after stroke and to 
provide clinical data for sample size calculations for larger 
studies.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We performed a randomized open active comparator study with blind-
ed objective end point assessment. We compared VNS paired with 
rehabilitation with rehabilitation alone in subjects with arm weak-
ness because of chronic ischemic stroke. Participants were enrolled 
at 2 stroke centers in the United Kingdom (NHS Greater Glasgow 
and Clyde and Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust). Study 
approval was granted by the Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory 
Authority and by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee. 
Participants provided voluntary, written informed consent. The trial 
was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01669161) and the protocol 
is at http://www.microtransponder.com/?page_id=972.
Patients with a history of unilateral supratentorial ischemic stroke 
that occurred at least 6 months before, aged ≥18 years and ≤80 years, 
with an Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score of 15 to 50 (in-
clusive, indication moderate to severe arm impairment) were eligible 
for inclusion. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in the 
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement.
Study Visits and Data Collection
Baseline Assessments
Participants had 3 visits before starting rehabilitation therapy. The 
first was performed soon after consent was obtained to confirm eligi-
bility. A second was performed at least 2 weeks later at which point 
randomization and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) were performed. Device implantation was then scheduled in 
participants randomized to the VNS group. A third baseline assess-
ment was performed after device implantation (or before the start of 
rehabilitation in rehabilitation-only participants). Each assessment 
included a detailed medical history and details of the index stroke, as-
sessment of eligibility, and measures of arm function. The measures 
of arm function used were the upper extremity Fugl–Meyer assess-
ment (FMA-UE),18 ARAT,19 grip and pinch strength (via a hand-held 
dynamometer),20 Box and Block test,21 9-hole peg test,22 and robotic 
assessment using an InMotion Technologies robot.23 We also used the 
Stroke Impact Scale.24
All observers received training in these measures before perform-
ing any assessments. This included written materials, practice at an 
investigators meeting, and (for the FMA-UE and ARAT score) review 
and scoring of recorded assessments followed by discussion to agree 
and confirm understanding of scoring rules.
Randomization and Masking
Enrolled participants were randomized, via an interactive voice re-
sponse system (Robertson Center for Biostatistics, University of 
Glasgow), to receive VNS plus rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone. 
Randomization was stratified by site, and block size was variable. 
Because of the nature of surgical device implantation, investigators, 
therapists, and participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. 
We attempted to ensure that outcome assessors were blinded by using 
assessors not involved in other aspects of the trial, by asking partici-
pants not to discuss their treatment allocation and to cover the chest 
and neck. We asked assessors to confirm that they were blinded be-
fore outcomes assessments.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRI data were acquired on 3T MRI scanners. Full details are 
given in the Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. The 
extent of injury to the corticospinal tract (CST) was quantified as 
previously described.25 We defined injury to the CST by the CST 
fractional anisotropy ratio and mean diffusivity ratio between the 
stroke and the nonstroke side and the volume of the stroke lesion 
within the CST.
VNS Device Implantation
Implantation was performed after the second baseline assessment 
in the VNS and rehabilitation group. Participants had a preopera-
tive assessment, which included anesthetic review and fiber optic 
laryngoscopy (Figures I–VII in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Participants were typically admitted on the morning of device in-
sertion and were discharged within 24 hours. Device implantation 
was performed under general anesthesia by either a Consultant Ear 
Nose and Throat surgeon (Glasgow) or a Consultant Neurosurgeon 
(Newcastle). The implantation involved placement of the stimulation 
electrodes of the leads (Model 304; Cyberonics Inc., Houston, TX) 
on the left vagus nerve in the left carotid sheath. The lead is then 
tunnelled subcutaneously to a subcutaneous pocket created in the left 
pectoral region where it is attached the implantable Vivistim pulse 
generator. Full details are available in the Methods in the online-only 
Data Supplement.
Rehabilitation Training
All participants received a 6-week course of 2-hour therapy sessions 
3× per week. All sessions started with 10 to 15 minutes of stretching 
exercises (without VNS). Thereafter, 7 standardized tasks were per-
formed (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). Tasks includ-
ed reach and grasp, handle turning, gross movement, object flipping, 
simulated eating tasks, inserting objects, opening bottles, and addi-
tional tasks selected by participants as priorities for improvement. 
Subjects performed at least 300 to 400 movements in each session 
that were modified or progressed to be achievable, but challenging. 
Each subject spent ≈10 minutes on each of the 7 tasks per during each 
session. All tasks were delivered by a licensed stroke physiothera-
pist. Therapy sessions were video recorded to monitor the treatment 
delivered.
VNS Protocol
A wireless control interface was used to communicate with the VNS 
device and deliver stimulation during therapy sessions. A laptop

 Dawson et al  VNS Stroke Study   145
with the Stroke Application Programming Software was used to 
program the IPG and initiate VNS. The stimulation was manually 
triggered by the therapist using a push button, while the patient 
performed a task (Figure 1). Stroke Application Programming 
Software allows the therapist to control the relative timing of stim-
ulation to therapy exercises using the push button. The software 
also allows the physician to program the stimulation parameters 
(amplitude [mA], frequency [Hz], pulse width [μS], and duration 
[ms]), captures patient programming history, and checks lead im-
pedance and battery status. A 500-ms burst of VNS was delivered 
to the VNS group during each movement (the rehabilitation-only 
group did not have a device implanted). Each simulation consisted 
of fifteen 0.8-mA, constant current, charge balanced pulses (100-
μs pulse width, 30-Hz frequency). These stimulation parameters 
grew out of hypothesis-driven research in humans and animal mod-
els,10–14 including studies of cortical map plasticity and electroen-
cephalogram desynchonization using VNS.12 Note stimulation was 
only delivered to the left vagus nerve to avoid activation of the 
sinoatrial node (which is innervated by the right vagus nerve), but 
bilateral neuronal connections mean stimulation should affect both 
cerebral hemispheres. Full details are given in the Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
Outcome Assessments
These were performed on days 1, 7, and 30 after the conclusion of 
rehabilitation therapy in both groups. The FMA-UE, ARAT, grip, and 
pinch strength via a hand-held dynamometer, Stroke Impact Scale, 
Box and Block test, and 9-hole peg test were assessed. The ARAT, 
grip strength, Box and Block tests, and 9-hole peg test were also mea-
sured at the end of the second and fourth week of the 6-week therapy 
period. Assessments were always performed in the same order, with 
a break halfway through the visit to complete questionnaires. Long-
term follow-up and postimplantation care is described in the Methods 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis and Study End Points
Because this was a pilot study, no formal sample size calculation 
was performed. An intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis 
were performed. The per-protocol analysis included participants 
who had at least 12 of the 18 therapy sessions and who were not 
taking any drugs that may interfere with VNS during the study. 
The numbers of serious and nonserious adverse events (AEs) are 
described, along with the numbers who completed the therapy 
protocol.
The main study safety end point was the number of serious AEs 
related to therapy, and the main feasibility end point was the number 
of participants who completed therapy protocol. The main efficacy 
assessment was change in FMA-UE score between the main baseline 
assessment and the first post-therapy visit. Secondary end points were 
changes in ARAT, Box and Block, 9-hole peg test, and grip strength. 
We also assessed whether participants improved by the minimum 
clinically significant difference in the FMA-UE and ARAT scores. 
This was defined as ≥6 points in the FMA-UE score and ≥5 points 
in the ARAT score. The efficacy end points for change in value were 
compared using ANCOVA with adjustment for the baseline value. To 
compare the percentage of improvers in each group, we used Fisher 
exact test. Finally, we explored the levels of the baseline MRI mea-
sures in relation to clinical response within each group using 2-sam-
ple t tests and Pearson correlations.
Results
Study Participants
Seventy-one patients were screened, of whom 21 were enrolled 
between February 2013 and April 2014 (16 at the Glasgow 
site and 5 at the Newcastle site). Twenty participants were ran-
domized (1 withdrew because of improvement in arm function 
during the baseline assessment phase and no longer wished to 
continue). Nine participants were randomized to VNS and reha-
bilitation and 11 to rehabilitation only. One patient in the VNS 
group received medication that may interfere with VNS so was 
excluded from the per-protocol analysis. A consort diagram is 
shown in Figure 2.
All participants were white and could ambulate indepen-
dently. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Groups 
seemed balanced for time from stroke, age, sex, handedness, 
and baseline ARAT, but there was a 5-point difference in the 
baseline FMA-UE scores (lower in the VNS group).

Feasibility
All randomized participants attended all planned therapy 
sessions. In the VNS group, the average duration of ther-
apy (excluding stretching) was 72 minutes (SD, 8; range 
38–90 minutes). This compared with 79 minutes (SD, 8; 
, range 53–113 minutes) in the rehabilitation-only group. 
Participants performed an average of 414 movements 
paired with VNS during a session in the VNS group (SD, 
124; range, 104–796). This compared with 463 movements 
(SD, 157; range, 165–876) in the rehabilitation-only group. 
One participant, who had a good clinical response, opted 
for device removal at the end of the study. All remaining 
participants have the device in situ and are undergoing lon-
ger-term follow-up.
Safety
There were 22 AEs in the 8 participants in the VNS group (11 
of which were adverse device effects in 5 participants) when 
compared with 10 AEs in 3 participants in the rehabilitation-
only group. Two participants had a serious AE in the VNS 
group, none of which were serious device effects. One par-
ticipant had 4 serious AEs in the rehabilitation group. No AEs 
were related to the rehabilitation therapy itself. The serious 
AEs are summarized in Table 2.
The adverse device effects were minor with the excep-
tion of one (moderate severity) and all resolved. This partici-
pant had a left vocal cord palsy and dysphagia after device 
implantation. Dysphagia settled over a 3-week period. This 
was successfully managed as an outpatient. VNS was stopped 
after 2 weeks in case it would hinder recovery; however, 
the participant continued to receive rehabilitation only. To 
exclude an underlying diagnosis for vocal cord palsy (the 
patient was an ex-smoker), computed tomographic scan of 
the neck and thorax was performed. This excluded any other 
cause but revealed left-sided phrenic nerve palsy, and the 
participant remained under active follow-up to exclude other 
causes. This vocal cord and phrenic nerve palsy had resolved 
at 9-month follow-up. One participant reported nausea after 
a single long session of VNS and rehabilitation. One partici-
pant reported a taste disturbance after surgery (metallic taste) 
that continued during the first 2 weeks of therapy. One par-
ticipant reported mild dysphagia in the evening after therapy 
sessions (manifest as finding it more difficult to swallow a 
capsule that evening only). None of these minor symptoms 
required changes to the therapy protocol, and all resolved on 
the day of the therapy session. Six participants had a slight 
hoarseness or neck tingling during stimulation, 3 were not 
aware of stimulation.
Efficacy
The mean change in FMA-UE scores in the VNS group was 
+8.7 (5.8) versus +3.0 (6.1) in the rehabilitation-only group 
(between-group difference, 5.7 points; 95% CI, −0.4 to 11.8; 
P=0.064; Figure 3). In the per-protocol analysis (n=19), the 
mean change in FMA-UE score was +9.6 points in the VNS 
group (5.3) and +3.0 points (6.1) in the rehabilitation-only 
group (between-group difference, 6.5 points; 95% CI, 0.4 to 
12.6; P=0.038). Six (66.7%) achieved a clinically meaning-
ful response on the FMA-UE score in the VNS group when 
compared with 4 (36.4%) in the rehabilitation-only group 
(P=0.17). There were no significant differences in the other 
secondary efficacy end points (Table 3) including robotic 
kinematic measures (data not shown).
Response in Relation to MRI Measures
There were no significant differences in MRI measures at base-
line between groups although there was a trend for baseline 
infarct volume, CST overlap volume, and mean diffusivity ratio 
to be higher and for fractional anisotropy ratio to be lower in 
VNS participants (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

There was no significant correlation between baseline MRI vari-
ables and change in UEFM score (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement) in either group. However, infarct volume, 
CST overlap volume, fractional anisotropy ratio, and mean dif-
fusivity ratio were significantly worse at baseline (P<0.05) in 
VNS responders compared with rehabilitation-only responders 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
This trial provides initial evidence of safety and feasibility 
of a novel neurostimulation technique, which in conjunction 
with rehabilitation for the upper limb, aims to promote neuro-
plasticity specific to improved upper-limb function. The data 
provide no signal of harm. Our study was not designed to test 
clinical efficacy, and our findings are preliminary. However, 
the per-protocol analysis demonstrated a significantly greater 
improvement in FMA-UE scores in VNS-treated participants 
than in controls. Baseline MRI data showed a significant dif-
ference in baseline MRI variables between responders in the 
VNS group and responders in the rehabilitation-only group. 
Whether this means VNS therapy allows recovery to occur 
in some participants who would not respond to conventional 
rehabilitation techniques requires rigorous testing in further 
randomized clinical trials.
Our innovation is to use short bursts of VNS paired with 
specific movements to restore lost motor skills. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is an entirely novel use of VNS. This 
method of VNS is sharply distinct from the current clini-
cal use of VNS for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and 
depression, where VNS is delivered on 30 seconds and on 5 
minutes off cycle. The stimulation used in the current study 
delivered <1% of the charge delivered with the Food and 
Drug Administration–approved protocols for epilepsy and 
depression. VNS paired with rehabilitation has been shown 
to improve recovery of forelimb function in several models 
of experimental stroke. VNS has also shown promise in a 
small study of participants (n=10) with severe chronic tin-
nitus,26 a disorder of abnormal central auditory system plas-
ticity although this was an open study and confirmatory data 
are needed. We have based our stimulation parameters on 
both animal and human data. We have recently found (in rat 
models) that pairing tones with 0.4 or 0.8 mA is sufficient 
to reorganize auditory cortex, whereas pairing tones with 
1.2 or 1.6 mA do not result in detectable cortical plasticity.27 
This observation closely mimics previous studies in epi-
lepsy patients where moderate but not high VNS current was 
memory enhancing.28 However, further clinical studies will 
be needed to define the optimum stimulation parameters for 
the stroke indication.
The mechanisms by which paired VNS exerts its effects on 
cortical neurons are not completely understood. However, it is 
well known that nucleus basalis and locus coeruleus neurons 
are activated during VNS via activation of nucleus tractus soli-
tarius.11 When stimulated, these neurons release acetylcholine 
and norepinephrine throughout the cortex.14 It is important to 
note that even though acetylcholine and norepinephrine are 
released throughout cortex, cortical plasticity is specific to the 
set of neurons driven by the stimulus (eg, sound or movement). 
Both behavioral and neurophysiologic changes can be observed 
when nucleus basalis or the vagus nerve is directly stimulated 
in short bursts and paired with sound or a movement.10–14 Short-
term stimulation of locus coeruleus neurons before training also 
seems to enhance learning and memory.29 Thus, a reasonable 
mechanistic explanation exists for why pairing VNS with sen-
sory or motor events could be an effective therapeutic approach 
for enhancing specific neuroplastic change.
Tolerability of surgery and stimulation was similar in 
our cohort when compared with that seen in current clinical 
applications although numbers were small. One patient devel-
oped a vocal cord palsy after device implantation. Overall, 
we conclude that there were no significant safety concerns 
that would preclude further study. This does not suggest that 
there are no important considerations for participants consid-
ering participation in future trials, or for patients should this 
treatment be introduced to clinical practice. On the basis of 
extensive experience of VNS in patients with epilepsy, we 
expect to see infection related to device implantation in ≈1% 
of participants,30 and other complications associated with 
anesthesia and surgery could arise.31 We minimized these 
risks by prescribing perioperative low molecular weight hep-
arin in place of oral anticoagulants or by substituting aspirin 
for clopidogrel where appropriate. Some VNS devices are 
MRI compatible, but we excluded patients who had a condi-
tion requiring MRI surveillance and patients who would not 
be able to undergo contrast-based computed tomographic 
imaging.
Although each therapy session in the trial was participant 
and goal specific, the duration and intensity of therapy were

higher in the rehabilitation-only group so is unlikely to have 
confounded the results. The improvement in function seen in 
the control group was similar to that demonstrated in previ-
ous clinical trials of intensive upper-limb therapy including 
robotic therapy and constraint induced movement therapy.6,32 
However, it should be noted that participants recruited to trials 
of treatments such as robotic therapy had stroke symptoms that 
were typically more severe than those included in our study.
When interpreting the results of functional recovery from 
a mechanistic stand point, there is often the question of recov-
ery of actual function versus compensation. To our knowledge, 
there is no measure that distinguishes the difference between 
compensatory and restorative change. Subtle compensatory 
strategies, such as accessory trunk motion, are controlled for 
with the choice of the Fugl–Meyer assessment tool. The nature 
of the Fugl–Meyer test is to measure motor impairment in 
stroke and because of the assessment of isolated movement of 
body parts, thus, typical clinical compensatory strategies are 
well controlled for.19 We found significant differences between 
responders in the VNS group and rehabilitation-only group. 
Infarct volume and measures of CST involvement were worse 
in VNS responders when compared with control responders. 
The CST fractional anisotropy ratio is known to be a predictor 
of long-term motor impairment and was lower in VNS respond-
ers.33 We hypothesize that VNS may be able to generate clinical 
responses in patients who would otherwise not respond to stan-
dard treatments through enhancing neuroplasticity.10–14
There are several strengths to this study. The study was 
randomized reducing the risk of selection bias. Blinded asses-
sors not involved in the day-to-day treatment of participants 
assigned outcomes. We had 98% follow-up, and all par-
ticipants completed the therapy protocol. The control group 
received intense rehabilitation similar to the VNS group, 
rather than typical standard of care.

The difference between groups and 95% confidence interval is shown. Positive values represent greater change in VNS-treated 
participants for all measures except the NHPT. Only participants who could complete the NHPT were included in the NHPT analysis. 
Data are shown for the ITT analysis (n=9 VNS and n=11 rehabilitation-only participants for all assessments [except NHPT where n=5 
and n=7, respectively]) and for the PP analysis (n=8 VNS and n=11 rehabilitation-only participants [except NHPT where n=5 and n=7, 
respectively]). ARAT indicates Action research arm test; FMA-UE, Fugl–Meyer assessment, upper extremity; ITT, intention to treat; NHPT, 
9-hole peg test; PP, per protocol; and VNS, vagus nerve stimulation.

 Dawson et al  VNS Stroke Study   149
There are limitations to consider. This study was not 
blinded to either the physiotherapist delivering the therapy 
or the participant, and there was no sham stimulation group. 
Although we asked participants not to discuss their treat-
ment allocation during outcomes assessments, we cannot 
exclude that assessors picked up on visual cues such as a 
scar in the neck from lead insertion. Furthermore, the study 
was small leading to imprecision in some of the efficacy 
assessments.
In conclusion, VNS paired with rehabilitation therapy is 
feasible in adults with arm weakness ≥6 months after isch-
emic stroke. It also seems to be acceptably safe for further 
study.
