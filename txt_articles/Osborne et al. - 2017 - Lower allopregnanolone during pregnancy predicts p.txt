Abstract
Current evidence is mixed on the role of progesterone and its metabolites in perinatal mood and 
anxiety disorders. We measured second and third trimester (T2 and T3) progesterone (PROG) and 
allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels by ELISA and postpartum depression (PPD) by clinician 
interview (DSM-IV criteria) in 60 pregnant women with a prior diagnosis of a mood disorder. 
Methods included multivariate and logistic regression with general linear mixed effect models. We 
found that, after adjustment, every additional ng/mL of T2 ALLO resulted in a 63% (95% CI 13% 
to 84%, p = 0.022) reduction in the risk of developing PPD. Our findings extend previous work 
connecting ALLO and depression within pregnancy, and indicate that the relationship between 
pregnancy ALLO and PPD is worth further exploration in a larger sample.

1. Introduction
1.1 Hormones and Postpartum Depression
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a debilitating illness that affects up to 15% of women in the 
general population (Yonkers et al., 2011), carries a high mortality (with suicide accounting 
for up to 20% of all postpartum deaths) (Shadigan and Bauer 2005), and has long-term and 
devastating effects on children and on the parent-child relationship (Yonkers et al. 2011). 
There are both biological and psychosocial risk factors for PPD. While now increasingly 
focused on the immune system as well as genetic and epigenetic factors, the bulk of the 
existing literature on biological factors has focused on the hormonal fluctuations (especially 
of estrogen and progesterone) that occur in the immediate postpartum period (Chrousos et 
al., 1998; Glynn et al., 2013; Moses-Kolko et al., 2009). Our group has previously argued for

 a “reproductive subtype of depression” (Payne et al., 2009), which affects vulnerable women 
during reproductive transitions including premenstrual, postpartum, and perimenopausal 
periods. There is evidence that estrogen fluctuations can trigger mood disturbance 
throughout the reproductive life cycle in susceptible women (Douma et al., 2005). Similarly, 
progesterone has long been thought to be anxiolytic and protective against depression 
(Gilbert Evans et al., 2005; Yim et al., 2015), with some studies suggesting that progesterone 
withdrawal may be associated with PPD (Harris et al., 1994). Bloch et al.’s pioneering study 
(2000) demonstrated that vulnerable women have a sensitivity to hormonal fluctuation; in 
this study, 62% of women with a history of PPD developed mood symptoms in response to a 
blinded withdrawal of supraphysiological levels of estrogen and progesterone, compared to 
none of controls.
While a few early studies have pointed to a relationship between hormone levels and 
postpartum blues or depression (Abou-Saleh et al., 1999; Feksi et al., 1984; Harris et al., 
1994), the bulk of the evidence indicates no relationship between either hormone levels 
themselves or the amplitude of hormonal fluctuation and the development of mood 
symptoms (Chatzicharampolous et al., 2011; Harris et al., 1996; Heidrich et al., 1994; Klier 
et al., 2007; Kuevi et al., 1983; for an excellent review, see Yim et al., 2015). Schiller et al. 
(2015) have recently summarized the literature supporting a hormone-sensitive variant of 
PPD, pointing not only to hormonal fluctuation but also to consequent variation in the 
regulation of GABA-A receptors as a factor in PPD.
There are a number of gaps in this literature. First, the published studies have primarily 
included hormonal measurements only in late gestation (Chatzicharalampous et al., 2011), 
when levels for all women are elevated 1000-fold over pre-pregnancy levels, as well as the 
postpartum (Epperson et al., 2006), when levels for all women are at their nadir. Might 
levels earlier in pregnancy, when changes from baseline are more moderate (Gilbert Evans, 
2005), predict PPD? Second, many studies have focused on the hormones themselves rather 
than on any downstream mediators, such as their metabolites.
1.2 Progesterone, Allopregnanolone, and PPD
The neuroprotective, anxiolytic, and sedative properties of progesterone may be due in part 
to the actions of allopregnanolone, one of its 3α-reduced metabolites and a strong allosteric 
modulator of the GABA-A receptor (Bali and Jaggo 2014; Bristot et al., 2014; Schumacher 
et al., 2014). There is considerable animal research on the anxiolytic effects of 
allopregnanolone (see Schule et al., 2014, for an overview). There is also significant 
research linking low levels of allopreganolone with depressed mood (Backstrom et al., 2014; 
Eser et al., 2006; Le Melledo and Baker, 2004; Nappi et al., 2001; Padberg et al., 2002; 
Pinna et al., 2006; Romeo et al., 1998; Schule et al., 2014; Strohle et al., 1999, 2000; 
Uzunova et al., 1998, 2006), and several studies have demonstrated that antidepressant 
treatment can increase allopregnanolone levels (Romeo et al., 1998; Strohle et al., 1999, 
2000; Uzunova et al., 1998). Other studies have also demonstrated alterations in the ratio of 
allopregnanolone to its precursors among depressed women, those with a history of 
depression, or those with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) (Girdler et al., 2001, 
2012; Klatzkin et al., 2006a; Lindgren et al., 2012; Pearson Murphy et al., 2001; Sundstrom 
Osborne et al.

 Poromaa et al., 2002; Schiller et al., 2014), indicating that the metabolism of progesterone 
may be altered in women with depressive symptoms.
Allopregnanolone and other progesterone metabolites change significantly across pregnancy 
and after childbirth (Biggio et al., 2009; Mostallino et al., 2009). Gilbert-Evans et al. (2005) 
found that absolute levels of allopregnanolone (and other metabolites) rise steadily through 
pregnancy before a sudden drop in the postpartum, and that the ratio of allopregnanolone to 
its precursor progesterone begins to drop even before delivery. They and others (Maguire 
and Mody 2008) hypothesize that the rising levels of allopregnanolone in pregnancy may 
down-regulate GABA-A receptors, and that the lag in restoration of receptor function 
following the abrupt decrease in hormones at birth may play an etiological role in PPD. 
Failure to regulate receptors appropriately in pregnancy may be a risk factor for the 
development of PPD.
A number of studies have directly examined the relationship between progesterone and its 
metabolites and PPD. Hellgren et al. (2014) found that women in late pregnancy with 
elevated depressive symptoms (Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale ≥ 13) had 
significantly lower levels of ALLO than those with normal-range scores, while Deligiannidis 
et al. (2013) found no relationship between hormone levels in late pregnancy or the early 
postpartum and the development of PPD in a small sample. Crowley et al. (2016) found that 
lower levels of a progesterone and of a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone in the 
second trimester were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, 
whereas Deligiannidis et al. (2016) found no differences in ALLO but higher levels of 
PROG and pregnanolone in women at risk for PPD compared to healthy controls. The 
present study builds upon this prior work. We hypothesized that women who went on to 
develop PPD would have lower levels of ALLO when measured during the second and third 
trimesters (T2 and T3). We also sought to investigate PROG at the same time points, as prior 
studies (Crowley et al. 2016, Deligiannidis et al. 2016) have had contradictory results 
concerning PROG.
2. Material and Methods
2.1 General Study Procedures
This was a prospective study conducted at The Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, and in collaboration with the University of North 
Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
at The Johns Hopkins University and UNC Chapel Hill. Detailed methods were published in 
Kimmel et al. 2015. Briefly, we followed 93 pregnant women with a history of a mood 
disorder across pregnancy and the postpartum. Participants could enroll at any trimester 
during pregnancy and were managed clinically by their treating psychiatrist. Sixty women 
had data from at least one pregnancy and one postpartum visit and were deemed to be 
eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Of these sixty women, 40 had both hormone and mood 
data at the second trimester visit, and 58 had data from the third trimester. The mean 
gestational age at the second trimester visit was 19.73 weeks (SD 3.94), and mean 
gestational age at the third trimester visit was 33.39 weeks (SD 3.00). Data collection 
included mood scales, measures of stress, clinical history, personality measures, sleep

 quality measures, medication use, blood, and clinician assessment for the presence of a 
mood episode based on DSM-IV criteria.
2.2. Blood Analysis
Participant blood was collected at each visit in four 10ml EDTA tubes. Blood samples were 
non-fasting, and collection times were arranged at the convenience of the participant. All 
occurred during the working day (9:00 am to 5:00 pm). Samples were immediately 
centrifuged at 4 degrees C for 30 minutes. The plasma was then aliquotted in 2 ml 
microcentrifuge tubes, snap frozen on dry ice, and immediately stored in a −80° freezer. 
Blood was analyzed with the allopregnanolone EIA kit from Arbor Assays LLC Cat 3 
KC44-H1 and progesterone EIA kit from Alpco catalogue # PROHU-E01. All samples were 
run in duplicate and the coefficient of variation (CV) among samples was <10%.
2.3 Statistical Methods
All significance tests were conducted as 2-sided tests with a 0.05 statistical significance 
level. Demographic and clinical history characteristics were compared between women 
included in this analysis (n=60) and those in the parent study (n=93) to assess for systematic 
differences. Demographic and clinical history characteristics were also compared between 
subjects who had second trimester samples (n=40) and those with third trimester samples 
(n=58). Relationships between PROG and ALLO levels and study outcomes by visit were 
assessed using scatter plots and locally weighted regression smoothers to assess whether 
linear fit was reasonable. Depression at each visit and postpartum was defined as clinician 
assessment of a major depressive episode based on DSM-IV criteria. Generalized linear 
mixed effects models with random intercept were used to estimate the relationship between 
PROG and ALLO levels and both concurrent depression and PPD while accounting for 
within-person correlation of outcomes over time and adjusting for potential confounders 
(gestational age at time of blood draw, age of participant, and sleep quality as measured by 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)). We used similar models to examine 
relationships between PPD and 1) the ratio of ALLO to PROG during pregnancy and 2) the 
rate of change of ALLO and PROG across pregnancy; in these models we used random 
slope for time period during pregnancy to allow for heterogeneity in outcome trajectories 
over time across women. The models were compared using Akaike Information Criterion 
(AIC). We used multivariate regression and logistic regression models to test the relationship 
between the PPD and the change in ALLO and PROG from 3rd trimester to postpartum. We 
also explored and tabulated patterns of missing data. Assuming missingness at random, we 
performed multiple imputation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) data 
augmentation method for multivariate normal model for women who provided blood 
samples. We generated 40 datasets; the estimates across the imputed datasets were combined 
using Rubin’s rules (Rubin 1987). All analyses were performed using STATA 14 (StataCorp. 
2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.).

 3. Results
3.1 Population
This sample was drawn from a larger study of 93 women. All participants were pregnant 
women between the ages of 18 and 45. The larger sample was a very ill population 
previously described in Kimmel et al. (2015). The majority of women in the parent study 
(57%) had a remitting course of illness; 32.6% had a prior hospitalization; 73% met criteria 
for more than one psychiatric disorder; 76% used psychiatric medications at some point 
during the study; and 75% met criteria for a major depressive episode at some point during 
the study. When demographic and clinical history characteristics were compared between 
women included in this analysis (n=60) and those not included (n=33), the only significant 
difference was in education levels (p = 0.023). Excluded subjects were more likely to have 
less than a high school education (33.3% vs. 8.3% of those included) and less likely to have 
a graduate or professional degree (21.2% vs. 41.7%).
For the group reported on in this paper, the majority (69.9%) were Caucasian, and 21.5% 
were African American. Approximately 50% were employed. All women had a previously 
diagnosed mood disorder. The majority (67.7%) carried a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD; other 
diagnoses included BPI, BPII, and BP-NOS. Table 1 shows demographic and clinical history 
for the women included in this analysis. We compared demographic and clinical 
characteristics for those with data available from the second trimester (T2, N=40) and 
compared them to those with third trimester (T3, N=58) data. Thirty-eight women had data 
at both time points. At the T2 blood draw, 65% of subjects were using antidepressants and 
12.5% were using mood stabilizers. At the T3 blood draw, 53.4% were using antidepressants 
and 12.1% were using mood stabilizers. Rates of obstetric complications were low overall, 
with the exception of fetal stress, which was noted in 35% of participants with T2 data and 
27.6% of those with T3 data. Similar proportions met criteria for an episode of depression at 
either T2 (37.5%) or T3 (43.1%), and similar proportions of those with T2 data (47.5%) and 
those with T3 data (43.1%) went on to develop PPD.
3.2 Hormone Levels and PPD
There was no relationship between either of the hormones measured at either time point and 
concurrent clinician-assessed major depressive episodes. There was no relationship between 
PROG at either time point and PPD. There was no relationship between ALLO measured at 
T3 and PPD. Lower levels of ALLO in the 2nd trimester, however, were associated with 
clinician-assessed PPD measured in the postpartum period. In an unadjusted model, every 
additional ng/mL of T2 ALLO was associated with a 52% reduction in the likelihood of 
developing PPD (95% CI: 5% to 76%, p = 0.034). We considered whether numerous 
confounders, including asthma, smoking, medication use, diagnosis, infection, obstetrical 
risk factors, and other hormones, might affect these results. We performed tests for statistical 
association among these confounders, mood outcomes, and the exposure variables (ALLO 
and PROG) and found no significant relationships; we therefore excluded them from the 
model.

 Age and sleep quality were also found to be significantly related to PPD, so we adjusted our 
analysis for age and sleep quality. The reduction in risk of developing PPD was increased to 
63% for every additional ng/mL of T2 ALLO (95% CI 13% to 84%, p = 0.022) in the 
adjusted analysis (Figure 1). When we restricted our analyses to the small group who had no 
depression in pregnancy (n=15), our findings lost statistical significance.
We also examined the relationship between longitudinal hormone change and clinician-
assessed depression. We examined relationships between clinical depression and three 
longitudinal factors: 1) the ratio of ALLO to PROG at each time point across pregnancy; 2) 
the rate of change of ALLO and PROG across pregnancy; and 3) the change in ALLO and 
PROG from third trimester to the postpartum. We found no significant relationships. We 
repeated all analyses using imputation for missing data and the results did not change.
Discussion and Conclusions
Our principal finding was a significant association between low levels of ALLO in the 
second trimester and the development of PPD (a clinician-assessed major depressive episode 
using DSM-IV criteria in the postpartum) in women with a history of mood disorders. We 
did not find any such relationships between ALLO and concurrent depression in pregnancy, 
nor with PROG and concurrent or future depression, nor with the ratio of ALLO to PROG or 
the rate of change of ALLO across pregnancy.
Our findings differ from some previous research (Deligiannidis et al., 2013), in that we 
found a relationship between postpartum mood state and absolute levels of a metabolite of a 
reproductive hormone during pregnancy. One explanation for this could be the fact that we 
measured hormone levels earlier in pregnancy, rather than at their third trimester high point. 
Our lack of significant predictive findings in the third trimester is more consistent with 
previous research. In addition, all of our participants had a prior diagnosis of a mood 
disorder, with high rates of clinician-assessed depression at most points during the study – 
which may mean that our population is not comparable to a more general population. In fact, 
when we restricted our analyses to those who were not depressed during pregnancy, our 
findings lost statistical significance. This may, however, be related to the small sample size 
(n=15) of non-depressed women, for ALLO was not related to concurrent depression at 
either time point in pregnancy but rather only predictive of PPD, indicating that it cannot 
simply be considered a marker of chronic depression.
This is an exploratory study, an as such there are significant limitations. The sample size is 
small, and most participants were Caucasian with high income and education levels. The 
power of this sample size to answer these particular questions was not calculated, and we 
had missing data (although results did not differ when we imputed for missing data). We 
were unable to control for some clinical confounders that could have affected our results, 
including body mass index, levels of other hormones, and other medical conditions. Blood 
was not collected at the same time point during the day for each subject, and it is possible 
that our results were affected by diurnal variations. (Prior published studies indicate diurnal 
variation in estradiol (McGregor et al. 1999), but evidence is lacking for diurnal variation in 
progesterone and progesterone metabolites.) We did not collect information about fetal sex

 so were unable to examine any differences in either mood or hormone level by sex of the 
fetus.
Our findings can nevertheless point us to future directions of study. Are other progesterone 
metabolites similarly altered in women with low ALLO? If rising ALLO in normal 
pregnancy leads to down-regulation of GABA-A receptors, as some prior research has 
suggested (see Gilbert Evans et al. 2005), what is the receptor profile of women whose 
ALLO is lower than normal during pregnancy? Might PPD vulnerability be conferred by 
failure to regulate receptors appropriately? If ALLO levels measured in the 2nd trimester 
predict PPD, might ALLO measured in the first trimester – or before pregnancy – also be 
predictive? Or might combining ALLO with other biological variables improve our ability to 
predict PPD? Our group has reported separately on epigenetic biomarkers (HP1BP3 and 
TTC9B) that predict PPD with an AUC of 80%, and found that the change in ALLO from 
2nd to 3rd trimester is correlated with those epigenetic biomarkers (Osborne et al. 2015). The 
direction of methylation for HP1BP3 differed between antenatally depressed and euthymic 
women, and was associated with the number of inflammatory cell-type elevations in the 
antenatally depressed women. This may mean that ALLO could be a more useful predictor 
of PPD if combined with markers of inflammation. The present work, when coupled with 
such work in the future, may therefore represent one small step in the path toward greater 
understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the peripartum depressive 
symptoms that affect the functioning and happiness of so many mothers and children.
