Abstract
Background—Ambient air pollutants may increase preterm birth (PTB) risk but critical 
exposure windows are uncertain. The interaction of asthma and pollutant exposure is rarely 
studied.
Objective—To assess the interaction of maternal asthma and air pollutant exposures in relation to 
PTB risk.
Methods—Electronic medical records for 223,502 U.S. deliveries were linked with modified 
Community Multiscale Air Quality model outputs. Logistic regression with generalized estimating 
equations estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PTB based on the 
interaction of maternal asthma and particulate matter <2.5 microns (PM2.5) and <10 microns 
(PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) per 
interquartile range. For each gestational week 23–36, exposures among women who delivered 
were compared to those remaining pregnant. Three-months preconception, whole pregnancy, 
weeks 1–28 and the last six weeks of gestation averages were also evaluated.
Results—Assessing PTB by gestational week, significant asthma interactions were sporadic 
before 30 weeks but more common during weeks 34–36 with higher risk among asthmatic mothers

 for NOx, CO and SO2 exposure and an inverse association with O3 in week 34. Odds of PTB were 
significantly higher among asthmatics for CO and NOx preconception and early in pregnancy. In 
the last six weeks of pregnancy, PM10 risk for PTB was higher among asthmatics.
Conclusion—Asthmatic mothers may experience higher risk for PTB after exposure to traffic-
related pollutants such as CO and NOx particularly for exposures three-months preconception and 
in the early weeks of pregnancy.

Introduction
Environmental factors that contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes have received 
considerable attention, and the current literature regarding risk of preterm birth at <37 
weeks’ gestation is well summarized in several recent review articles (1–5). Overall, the 
evidence for higher preterm birth risk associated with ambient air pollution is mixed, but 
third trimester exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter <10 microns (PM10) was significantly associated with higher preterm birth risk in a 
recent meta8 analysis (2). Other summaries and pooled estimates suggested significantly 
higher risks associated with a range of exposure windows for particulate matter with 
aerodynamic diameter <2.5 microns (PM2.5) (3;4) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) (3). Air toxics, 
particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), may also be related to early delivery 
(1).
Despite the effort in this area (6), no etiologically-relevant critical exposure time-window for 
ambient air to influence preterm birth risk has been determined and the varied time windows 
make comparisons between studies more difficult. A wide range of air pollution exposure 
estimates have been used, ranging from whole pregnancy averages (7;8;9), trimester-specific 
results (8–12) to months(13) or weeks (14–16) before delivery. Several studies evaluated 
multiple windows (9;17–19) and in some early studies, the relevant windows were unclear 
(7). Heterogeneity in study design and exposure metrics may be part of the issue behind the 
lack of consistency in findings across studies (20;21).
Further adding to the complexity is the likelihood that pregnant women are not uniformly 
susceptible to the impact of air pollutants and women with asthma may be particularly 
vulnerable. Asthma exacerbation and perhaps incidence are related to poor air quality (22). 
Asthma prevalence is estimated to be more than 9% among American women (23) and 
maternal asthma is a well-known risk factor for preterm birth (24), a finding also observed in 
our data (25). A study of birth records from 1988–2006, conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, 
found significant preterm birth risks for mothers with and without asthma associated with 
first trimester ozone (O3) exposure, but observed no main effect or interaction with asthma 
for first trimester nitrogen oxides (NOx) exposure (26). Other susceptible subpopulations 
like the elderly or diabetic persons appear to respond differentially to exposure, (27) but air 
pollution effects have also been muted among individuals with preexisting disease.(28) 
Given that the world-wide impact of asthma on the lives of young women continues to

 increase (29) and challenges to control air pollution remain, whether or not pregnant 
asthmatics are also a susceptible subpopulation is an important avenue for investigation.
To address these data gaps, we evaluated the impact of exposure to criteria air pollutants on 
the week-by-week risk of preterm birth and for a range of exposure windows in a large, 
contemporary US obstetric cohort of women with and without asthma.
Methods
Study population
Gestational age, maternal demographics, medical, reproductive and prenatal history, and a 
summary of labor and delivery information were ascertained in the Consortium on Safe 
Labor (CSL, 2002–2008) (30). This retrospective cohort of births at ≥23 weeks’ gestation 
was assembled using electronic medical records from 12 centers (19 hospitals) across the US 
(Figure 1). The cohort included 228,562 deliveries with 233,736 newborns, with 87% of 
births occurring during 2005–2007. We excluded multifetal pregnancies (n=5,050) and 
pregnancies missing air quality data (n=10), resulting in an analytic sample of 223,502 
singleton pregnancies among 204,175 women. Most women (185,785; 91.0%) contributed 
only one pregnancy. The CSL was approved by the institutional review boards of all 
participating institutions. Data collection and validation have been previously described (30).
Outcome and covariates
All outcome and covariate data were derived from the electronic delivery records and 
supplemented with International Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9) codes in the 
hospital discharge summaries. Preterm birth was defined using the best clinical gestational 
age recorded in the medical record. Births at each week from 23 to 36 of gestation were 
compared to ongoing pregnancies. We also examined preterm birth as a dichotomous 
variable with two cut-points, preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and early preterm birth 
(<34 weeks gestation). Asthma diagnosis was recorded in the medical record and/or in the 
discharge summary (ICD-9 code 493.-493.9). Adjusted models include maternal age in years 
(<20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, ≥35, unknown); race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/
Pacific Islander, Other Race, Unknown), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) 
(<18.5 underweight, 18.5–24.9 normal weight, 25–29.9 overweight, ≥30 obese, unknown), 
smoking and alcohol use (both yes/no), study site, parity (nulliparous, primiparous, 
multiparous), insurance status (private, public/government, self-pay/other, unknown), marital 
status (married, divorced/widowed, single, unknown), and maternal comorbidities (chronic 
hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease and HIV). Covariates were selected a priori based on 
earlier analyses of preterm birth in association with maternal asthma (25;31).
Exposure
Ambient air pollutant concentrations were estimated using a modified version of the 
Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model (32), a three-dimensional, regional air 
quality model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). 
Meteorology inputs for the model simulations were generated using the Weather Research 
and Forecasting model, including inputs for hourly temperature, relative humidity and wind

 characteristics. Air pollutant emissions were generated using the U.S. EPA National 
Emission Inventories. Hourly concentrations of ambient air pollutants for the ground-level 
layer (approximately 30 meters high) over the entire continental U.S. for years 2001–2009 
were calculated in the Air Quality and Reproductive Health study. Because the CSL data are 
anonymized, these hourly concentrations were averaged to estimate the mean daily levels 
within each of the 15 distinct delivery hospital referral regions (33) which were then 
averaged to obtain weekly and whole pregnancy exposure estimates. The size of hospital 
referral regions ranged from 415 to 312,644 square kilometers. Estimates were weighted for 
population density to discount exposure in areas where women were unlikely to live or 
work. Modelled data were fused with observed monitor data retrieved from the U.S. EPA Air 
Quality System where available and estimates were adjusted using inverse distance 
weighting for criteria air pollutants: PM2.5 and PM10, O3, NOx, SO2 and CO. Our final 
model results were compared to pollutant level estimates obtained with four other commonly 
used strategies, including one based on monitors alone., Our fused, population-weighted 
model performed very well with better coverage for particles, SO2 and O3 than monitors 
alone and with stronger agreement with measured exposure for both gas phase and particle 
phase species than raw CMAQ models (34). Risk models are based on interquartile range 
(IQR; the difference between the 25–75 percentiles) changes in exposure (Supplemental 
Table 1).
Statistical analyses
Each observed pregnancy was included in the analysis and pregnancy was the unit of 
analysis in all statistical testing. Pregnancies to the same woman were accounted for with 
generalized estimating equations and robust variance estimates to adjust for their lack of 
independence. Descriptive statistics were calculated by preterm status but no significance 
testing was conducted. To study the acute effect of air pollution on preterm birth, we 
performed a conditional logistic regression for each gestational week from 23–36, 
conditioning on women being at risk for delivery at that week (i.e., not previously 
delivered). We then compared exposure among deliveries at that week versus the same 
gestational week of exposure for all ongoing pregnancies. This is akin to a fetuses-at-risk 
approach which employs the idea of discrete-time survival analysis, but we fit saturated 
regression models by fully stratifying on the weeks of delivery. For these analyses, the risk 
estimate is interpreted as the odds of preterm delivery in a particular gestational week when 
exposure to the pollutant increases by one-IQR during that week. This interpretation is 
analogous to an “instantaneous risk ratio” in a survival analysis.
We also conducted analyses to examine the marginal probability of preterm birth (both <34 
and <37 weeks) in association with ambient concentrations of each air pollutant for longer, 
more chronic exposure periods. Preliminary results of analyses of each gestational week 
from 1 to 28 suggested a change in risk over time that was well captured with equal division 
of the first two trimesters into 7-week increments (1–7; 8–14; 15–21; and 22–28). We also 
examined a three-month preconception window, the last six weeks of pregnancy and the total 
pregnancy. In contrast to the fetus-at-risk type of analyses, these logistic regressions 
estimated the marginal increase in the odds of preterm birth (or early preterm birth), per IQR 
increase in air pollution within a specific exposure window. As sensitivity analyses, risks

 associated with peak weekly concentration during each of the 7-week windows were also 
estimated.
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for each week of gestation 23 to 36 and for 
dichotomous preterm birth outcomes (<34 weeks, <37 weeks) were estimated using logistic 
regression. Robust standard errors and generalized estimating equations were used to 
account for multiple births by the same women. Crude, site-adjusted models were generally 
similar to fully adjusted models and only adjusted results are shown. Interactions between 
maternal asthma and each pollutant were included in the models to test for effect 
modification. Odds ratios for women with and without asthma are calculated from the same 
model based on the interaction between maternal asthma status and each pollutant. Analyses 
were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 3.0.2. 
This study also utilized the high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf 
Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (http://biowulf.nih.gov). In 
consideration of the multiple time-windows and pollutants tested, we also evaluated the 
potential for false discovery among our findings using the method of Benjamini and 
Hochberg (35).
Results
Preterm birth occurred in 11.7% of singleton deliveries (Table 1) and 33.6% of those 
deliveries were early preterm births (<34 weeks). As anticipated, preterm birth occurred 
more frequently among women who were Black, at the extremes of maternal age, single, had 
public insurance, smoked or drank alcohol during pregnancy and among women with 
chronic comorbid conditions prior to pregnancy. Women with asthma were more likely to 
deliver preterm, both early and overall.
Examining acute effects for each week of gestation (Figure 2), we found significant 
differences in preterm birth risk by asthma status that were fairly sporadic early in gestation 
with a significant increased risk for asthmatics at week 23 with NOx exposure, week 26 with 
PM2.5, and week 29 with NOx, PM2.5 and PM10. At week 34, the acute risk for asthmatics is 
increased with exposure to NOx and SO2 but decreased for O3 compared to non-asthmatics. 
Asthmatics had significantly higher risk for preterm birth at week 35 associated with NOx 
exposure and at week 36 with increased CO and SO2. When we apply a correction for false 
discovery, significant interactions with maternal asthma remained for NOx at week 35 and 
for PM2.5 at week 29. During some weeks where interaction terms were not significant at 
p<0.05 level, we also observed significantly elevated risk among asthmatic women. 
Regardless of significant interaction, the point estimates for preterm birth among asthmatic 
women are significantly elevated for PM2.5 (weeks 26, 28 and 29), for PM10 (weeks 28 and 
36), for O3 (week 33), for SO2 (week 34 and 36), and elevated for CO in week 36 but 
inverse in week 30 (Supplemental Table 2). For non-asthmatics, inverse associations were 
more common and risks were seen only in relation to O3 (weeks 23, 26, 27, and 28) and 
PM10 (week 25) exposure.

 For longer, more chronic exposure, results for seven-week averages (four windows: weeks 
1–7, 8–14, 15–21 and 22–28), the last six-weeks of pregnancy and the broader 
preconception (3-month) and whole pregnancy windows are reported in Table 2.
With the exception of O3, most risk estimates were higher among asthmatic women for all 
windows studied. Preconception, both CO and NOx effects were higher among asthmatics 
with significant elevations of 12% in total preterm after CO exposure and 28–29% for total 
and early preterm after NOx exposure. In the first seven weeks of pregnancy, exposure to 
ambient concentrations of CO was associated with 8% higher total preterm risk for 
asthmatics (null for non-asthmatics) and NOx was associated with higher risk among 
asthmatics (22% increase for early preterm birth and 13% for total preterm births) while risk 
estimates for non-asthmatics were substantially lower (1–3% increased risk). Risks for 
asthmatics were lower after O3 exposure during gestational weeks 8–21 and significant 
increased risks were observed for non158 asthmatics in several windows for both total and 
early preterm birth. During the last six weeks of pregnancy, we observed statistically 
significant interaction between maternal asthma and CO, NOx, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 but 
only the PM10 estimate was significantly elevated for asthmatic mothers (9% increased risk 
compared to 1% for total preterm and 13% compared to null for early preterm).
After correction for potential false discovery, asthmatics remained at significantly higher 
risk for early preterm birth after exposure to NOx during nearly all time windows studied 
and for total preterm risk the interaction for NOx remained significant for preconception, the 
first seven weeks of pregnancy, the last six weeks of pregnancy and the whole pregnancy 
average. In addition, exposure to both PM10 and PM2.5 in the last six weeks of pregnancy w 
as associated with higher risk among asthmatics for early preterm birth after false discovery 
correction.
Discussion
In this large, contemporary obstetric cohort, we observed a pattern of associations that 
suggested preterm birth risk was higher among asthmatics exposed to most criteria air 
pollutants compared to non-asthmatics. Examining exposure in the last completed week for 
preterm births compared to ongoing pregnancies at the same week, we found significant 
interactions with higher risk for asthmatic mothers associated with NOx, CO, PM2.5, PM10 
and SO2. Only O3 was associated with lower preterm birth risk among asthmatics. 
Asthmatic women also appear to be particularly susceptible to early exposure to CO (8% 
higher risk), NOx (13% higher risk), PM10 (8% higher risk) and PM2.5 (8% higher risk) and 
late pregnancy exposure to PM10 (9% higher risk) whereas O3 exposure appears to increase 
risk in non-asthmatics.
Early preterm birth is less common, occurring in approximately 4% of singleton deliveries, 
but it is associated with greater neonatal mortality and substantial severe morbidity (36). 
Few prior studies have had sufficient power to examine this important group of cases (15) in 
relation to air pollution. Although most of our results were similar for both early and total 
preterm births overall, the risk estimates for women with asthma were somewhat higher for 
early preterm birth, particularly for NOx in weeks 1–7 (OR= 1.22 versus 1.13 for total

 preterm) and for the PM10 whole pregnancy average (OR=1.11 versus 1.05 for total 
preterm).
Our findings for very early pregnancy exposures to NOx and PM10 associated with increased 
preterm birth risks are novel. The developing conceptus is highly susceptible to oxidative 
stress as are the processes involved in establishing utero-placental blood flow (37), and these 
mechanisms could underlie a higher risk for subsequent preterm birth. This time window 
was rarely examined in prior studies and it appears to be important. Consistent with our 
findings, a recent investigation of PM2.5 also observed increased risk for preterm delivery 
associated with early pregnancy exposures in weeks 2–8 of gestation for both early preterm 
and total preterm births (15). Other studies of weekly data (14;16) have focused on the 
weeks prior to delivery rather than these early time windows. Our study is also novel in 
exploring a week-by-week risk estimation from 23 to 36 weeks comparing deliveries to 
exposure in ongoing pregnancies during the same gestational week.
First trimester exposure to SO2 and particles has been associated with increased prematurity 
in the Czech Republic (10), while NO2 was associated with preterm birth in Lithuania (11) 
but not in Spain (9). First trimester exposure to both CO and PM2.5 increased preterm risk in 
California (8). In contrast, our findings for SO2 and CO were null or inversely related to 
preterm birth risk among non-asthmatics across all of the windows we studied, but we did 
observe a 12% increased odds of preterm birth for preconception CO exposure among 
asthmatics.
Our study is the first to examine a preconception window, exploring the notion that these 
very early exposures may indicate a chronic inflammatory or vascular physiologic response 
that could lead to less than optimal conditions for implantation of the embryo and 
placentation – potential upstream factors related to preterm birth. In addition to the effect for 
CO mentioned above, we also observed an effect for NOx that is consistent with this notion 
but for the other criteria pollutants the preconception window risks were null or inverse. 
Chronic effects of air pollution are well known with respect to respiratory and cardiac effects 
( 38), including increased mortality (39), and we have also observed a chronic effect of 
preconception exposure on other pregnancy outcomes (40;41). Collectively, these findings 
suggest further investigation of chronic preconception air pollutant exposure on pregnancy 
outcomes is warranted.
Our study has limitations, including the use of the hospital referral region as the geographic 
unit for our time-windows of exposure to estimate levels of ambient air pollutants. We 
therefore assumed that women lived and spent time in the catchment area of their delivery 
hospital. Averaging ambient pollutant concentrations across referral regions limits peaks and 
generally results in less variation than measurement at a residence which could lower our 
ability to observe a significant effect if one exists. On the other hand, women are likely to 
travel around their local area and a small regional average may provide a better proxy for 
exposure. We acknowledge that our exposure assessment strategy does not allow us to assess 
small area variation in exposure, although we note that our data come from across the US 
with broad geographic representation. Across various windows including the weekly 
analyses in Figure 2, particularly for non-asthmatics, we observe inverse associations

 between pollutants and preterm birth. These findings are not biologically plausible in the 
sense that we do not anticipate that increases in air pollution exposure confer any protection, 
but they may be attributable in part to the correlations between pollutants. A functional 
analysis that included the temporal inter-correlation within pollutant across time windows 
(see Supplemental Table 3) did not appreciably change the estimates suggesting that within 
pollutant correlations were not responsible for the protective effects. On the other hand, O3 
is negatively correlated with other pollutants in our data (Supplemental Table 4) which may 
account for the difference in the pattern of outcomes for this secondary pollutant, including 
the lack of an association between ozone and preterm birth among asthmatics. While 
unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the inverse associations, 
we have controlled for a broad set of covariates and any such confounder is unlikely to be 
strongly related to maternal asthma. Finally, we recognize that although the intrapartum 
electronic medical records provide rich clinical data, they do not provide routine information 
unrelated to pregnancy such as asthma severity or treatment which could have impacted our 
findings. As such, we assume that our results reflect an “average” asthma patient’s 
experience and that stronger effects for women with severe or uncontrolled asthma are 
possible.
The strengths of our study include detailed exposure models which accounted for weather 
and both temporal and spatial dispersion with multiple sites across the US over an 8-year 
period. Preliminary models that also adjusted for season found nearly identical results for 
shorter time windows with some attenuation of findings for whole pregnancy suggesting that 
larger seasonal trends were not a major factor, likely due to the geographic dispersion of 
study sites. The evaluation of our model demonstrated superior performance in estimation of 
ambient pollutant levels compared with several other strategies, including observed monitor 
data (34). We examined a broad range of exposure windows given that there is no consensus 
on which windows are most important for preterm delivery risk. We recognize that this 
approach may lead to some chance findings due to multiple testing. While adjustment for 
multiple comparisons might be too restrictive in a novel exploration (42) where further 
research should be encouraged to confirm or refute potential chance findings, we applied a 
false-discovery correction to our findings (35). All of the interactions we observed with NOx 
remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons as do the interactions between 
maternal asthma and particle exposure in the last six weeks of pregnancy and early preterm 
birth. The large clinical database allowed us to control for detailed data on covariates that are 
not available in administrative sources such as birth certificates or insurance data. Notably, 
our findings for women with asthma suggest that they may be a vulnerable subpopulation 
with respect to air pollution exposure.
Conclusions
Women with asthma have higher risks for preterm birth after acute exposure to most criteria 
air pollutants both early (weeks 23, 26 and 29) and later in gestation (weeks 34–36). 
Preconception and the first weeks of pregnancy appear to be important windows of 
susceptibility for preterm birth risk with respect to CO, NOx, PM10 and PM2.5 exposure. 
Risks associated with O3 appear higher later in gestation and are increased 16% for early 
preterm and 8% for total preterm in relation to whole pregnancy exposure among non-

 asthmatics. Women with asthma often have higher risk associated with air pollutant 
exposures and even after adjustment for potential false discovery due to multiple 
comparisons, we find significantly increased risks for asthmatics after exposure to NOx and 
particles.
Small increases in preterm birth risk associated with air pollution merit attention given that 
asthma is common in the obstetric population and these exposures are difficult to manage at 
the individual level.

 Clinical Implications
Pregnant women with asthma had significantly higher risk of preterm birth compared to 
non-asthmatics after both chronic and short-term exposure to many air pollutants, 
particularly carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides.

 Capsule Summary
In a large U.S. obstetric cohort, asthmatic mothers were more likely to deliver preterm 
after air pollution exposure, particularly carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides 
preconception, in early gestation and in the weeks prior to delivery.
