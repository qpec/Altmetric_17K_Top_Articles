Abstract
Background
Maternal age at pregnancy is increasing worldwide as well as preterm birth. However, the
association between prematurity and advanced maternal age remains controversial.
Objective
To evaluate the impact of maternal age on the occurrence of preterm birth after controlling
for multiple known confounders in a large birth cohort.
Study design
Retrospective cohort study using data from the QUARISMA study, a large Canadian ran-
domized controlled trial, which collected data from 184,000 births in 32 hospitals. Inclusion
criteria were maternal age over 20 years. Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancy, fetal
malformation and intra-uterine fetal death. Five maternal age categories were defined and
compared for maternal characteristics, gestational and obstetric complications, and risk fac-
tors for prematurity. Risk factors for preterm birth <37 weeks, either spontaneous or iatro-
genic, were evaluated for different age groups using multivariate logistic regression.
Results
165,282 births were included in the study. Chronic hypertension, assisted reproduction tech-
niques, pre-gestational diabetes, invasive procedure in pregnancy, gestational diabetes and
placenta praevia were linearly associated with increasing maternal age whereas hyperten-
sive disorders of pregnancy followed a “U” shaped distribution according to maternal age.
Crude rates of preterm birth before 37 weeks followed a “U” shaped curve with a nadir at
5.7% for the group of 30–34 years. In multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of
prematurity stratified by age group followed a “U” shaped distribution with an aOR of 1.08
(95%CI; 1.01–1.15) for 20–24 years, and 1.20 (95% CI; 1.06–1.36) for 40 years and older.

Conclusion
Even after adjustment for confounders, advanced maternal age (40 years and over) was
associated with preterm birth. A maternal age of 30–34 years was associated with the low-
est risk of prematurity.
Introduction
During the last decades, a gradual increase of maternal age has been observed worldwide. In
the United States, between 1970 and 2006, the proportion of pregnant women aged over 35
years has increased almost eight times [1] and therefore researchers have been interested in
outcomes of pregnancy in women of advanced age [2–5]. Pregnancy complications such as
placenta praevia, intra-uterine growth restriction or fetal demise, gestational diabetes, hyper-
tensive disorders of pregnancy, and caesarean delivery are well known to be more common in
older pregnant women [6–10]. Therefore, guidelines have emerged, both in North America
and Europe, for the management of pregnancy in patient with advanced maternal age [11–13].
Preterm birth is the most important factor determining neonatal morbidity and mortality,
and has a major impact on it. However, in literature, the association between prematurity and
advanced maternal age remains controversial. A study on more than 80,000 women revealed
that 36% of the increase in prematurity, between 1990 and 1996 in Canada, was attributable to
the change towards increasing maternal age [10]. Various studies have tried to study the spe-
cific influence of advanced maternal age after adjustment for hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy, maternal medical history or assisted reproduction technologies [9, 14, 15], but the
evidence is still conflicting. Thus, as outlined in a systematic review, further research is needed
to determine if advanced maternal age is an independent factor for prematurity[16].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between advanced maternal age and
prematurity (both spontaneous and iatrogenic) after controlling for multiple confounders.
Materials and methods
This is a retrospective cohort study using data obtained from the QUARISMA randomized
controlled trial [17]. QUARISMA was a cluster intervention trial designed to assess the effec-
tiveness of a complex intervention with background information and audits targeting a general
population in terms of safe and sustainable reduction in the rate of caesarean sections. The
intervention targeted physicians and nurses, involved audits of indications for cesarean deliv-
ery, provision of feedback to health professionals, and implementation of best practices. It
took place in 32 hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada, from 2008 to 2011 and enabled
to collect information on more than 184 000 pregnancies. Trained staff collected information
on standardized individual records. In this trial, hospitals were the units of randomization and
women were the units of analysis. By designating hospitals as the units of randomization (clus-
ters), the study ensured that all women within a given maternity unit were assigned to the
same trial group, thereby reducing the risk of contamination of the intervention effect. Ethics
approval was obtained by the Ethics research board of CHU Sainte-Justine (Montreal) under

 the Study Number 2604, for the completion of the trial, for the creation of the database and for
the present study.
Inclusion criteria were those of the QUARISMA trial: birth at or after 24 gestational weeks
of a fetus weighing >500 grams; and maternal age >20 years. Non-inclusion criteria were mul-
tiple pregnancies, fetal malformations and intra-uterine fetal demise.
Five maternal age categories were defined: 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39 and 40 years and
older. Groups of age were compared based on maternal history: past drug use, nulliparity, and
medical history including chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal and cardiac disease,
thrombophilia, systemic erythematous lupus and inflammatory bowel disease. Characteristics
of the current pregnancy were also studied: drug use, smoking, use of assisted reproductive
technologies, and occurrence of an invasive procedure (chorionic villus sampling or amnio-
centesis). Additionally, groups of age were also compared according to maternal and obstetri-
cal complications: hypertensive complications (gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and
eclampsia), gestational diabetes and placenta praevia. All comparisons used chi-square test.
The odds ratios for preterm birth (<37 weeks) and very preterm birth (< 32 weeks) were
calculated for different age groups before and after adjustment by multivariate logistic regres-
sion for known risk factors, maternal characteristics and gestational complications. For these
analyses, the reference group corresponded to the group with the lowest rate of prematurity.
As our analyses did not focus on the intervention of the primary trial (caesarean section) and
since this intervention did not condition the relationship between the explanatory variables
and the outcome studied in our paper; we did not performed mixed model analyses account-
ing for cluster (hospitals).
Preterm birth <37 weeks was divided into spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth. For
both conditions, risk factors were studied using multivariate logistic analyses after adjustment
on covariates. Iatrogenic delivery was defined as performance of a cesarean delivery before
onset of labor or induction of labor using cervical ripening or oxytocin.
Results were considered significant when p<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed
with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute)
Results
QUARISMA trial reported the outcome of 184,952 deliveries. After exclusions, a total of
165,195 births were finally included in the study and distributed as follows: 24 650 aged 20–24
years; 59 124 aged 25–29 years; 55 867 aged 30–34 years; 21 416 aged 35–39 years; 4138 aged
40 years or more (Fig 1).
Comparison of excluded (19,757) and included (165,195) births did not show any discrep-
ancy regarding maternal distribution of age or maternal characteristics. Risk factors for prema-
turity by age category are presented in Table 1. Compared to the 30–34 years old group, the
rate of chronic hypertension almost tripled in the >40 years group (4.1% versus 1.4%) and the
rate of gestational diabetes more than doubled (19.4% versus 8.7%). The rates of pre-existing
diabetes, assisted reproductive technologies, invasive procedure, placenta praevia and obesity
also increased with maternal age. The prevalence of hypertensive disorders were higher among
extreme of ages: the rates of gestational hypertension were lowest in patients aged 30 to 34
years, and the rates of preeclampsia were lowest in patients aged 25 to 34 years.
Rates of preterm birth <37 weeks and very preterm birth <32 weeks were lowest in the 30–
34 years old group (5.7% and 0.6% respectively) and highest in women over 40 years (7.8%
and 1.0% respectively) (Table 2 and Fig 2). Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs, aORs) for
preterm birth, very preterm birth, iatrogenic and spontaneous preterm delivery before 37
weeks, are presented in Table 2. For mothers younger than 24 years and older than 35 years,

 preterm birth was significantly more frequent compared to the reference group (30–34 years).
There was a trend towards increased risk in women aged 25–29 years. ORs for preterm birth,
extreme preterm birth, and spontaneous preterm birth in the group of 40 years or more were
respectively 1.39 (95% CI 1.24–1.57), 1.68 (95% CI 1.21–1.31) and 1.20 (1.04–1.39). Iatrogenic
prematurity was almost twice as common in this group (OR 1.91 (95% CI 1.56–2.34)).
After adjustment for potential confounders, advanced maternal age (40 years and over),
compared to the reference group (30–34 years), was associated with preterm birth <37 weeks
and iatrogenic preterm birth (aOR 1.20 (95% CI 1.06–1.36) and aOR 1.31 (95% CI 1.05–1.64)
respectively). Age 35–39 years was also associated with iatrogenic prematurity (aOR 1.15
(1.01–1.31)). Younger women (20–24 years) had an increased risk of preterm birth (aOR 1.08
(95% CI 1.01–1.15) and spontaneous preterm birth (aOR 1.09 (95% CI 1.02–1.18). Detailed
results of the multivariate analysis are presented in Table 3. Placenta praevia and hypertensive
disorders were associated with the highest risk for preterm birth <37 weeks, due to the
increase risk in iatrogenic preterm birth<37 weeks.
Discussion
We found that advanced maternal age (40 years and over) was associated with an increased
risk of preterm birth even after adjustment for confounders. The lowest risk of prematurity
was found in mothers aged 30–34 years. Preterm birth was mainly spontaneous in younger
women (20–24 years) whereas it was more frequently of iatrogenic origin in women over 40.
Our results are in accordance with those of two recently published cohort studies. Lawlor
et al, in a population of Danish women, found a U shaped relationship between maternal age

 and risk of preterm birth, with the lowest risk age at 24–30 years [18]. A more recent nation-
wide register-based cohort study in Finland found that the threshold-ages for preterm birth
was 28 years (OR 1.10, 1.02–1.19) [5]. However the authors used different inclusion criteria
and they did not stratify their results according to the onset of preterm birth (spontaneous or
iatrogenic)
Confounders identified in our study are known risk factors for prematurity. Placenta prae-
via, gestational diabetes, medical history, use of assisted reproduction technologies and occur-
rence of an invasive procedure were all more common in aged mothers. On the other hand,
nulliparity, past drug use and smoking were more prevalent in younger mothers. Furthermore,
the prevalence of hypertensive disorders was lowest in middle-aged groups. This distribution
of risks factors probably accounts for the “U” shaped distribution of preterm birth risk among
age groups. Past research has already shown that younger mothers tend to have higher prema-
turity rates, but the persistence of this effect until 30 years old has rarely been identified [19].

 In contrast, some studies have found a higher risk of preterm birth risk among women of the
age group 30–34 years [3, 5, 20–22]. This difference could be explained by variations in socio-
demographic or clinical risk factors across different studies.
A common hypothesis is that the increased risk of preterm birth among aged mothers is
largely explained by early labor induction for medical conditions. However, our analysis of iat-
rogenic versus spontaneous prematurity rates among aged mothers does not confirm this
hypothesis. Khalil et al. found opposite results in a recent cohort study [23]. This discrepancy
could be due to a different definition of iatrogenic preterm birth. In our study, the variable
“iatrogenic preterm birth” was generated using a combination of other variables describing the
method of induction of labor. Such data are exposed to classification bias by data abstractors,
and some preterm births could have been misclassified. For example, preterm births by caesar-
ean section secondary to preterm premature rupture of membranes could have been misclassi-
fied as iatrogenic because of an “elective caesarean section” at 34 or 36 weeks. Iatrogenic
preterm births could have been misclassified as spontaneous if oxytocin induction was con-
founded with oxytocin augmentation. Nevertheless, in light of our results, we cannot rule out
that advanced maternal age is independently associated with spontaneous prematurity, as
McIntyre et al. concluded in a population based cohort study [20]. Regarding younger women
(20–24 years), we confirmed that preterm birth was mainly spontaneous rather than iatro-
genic. As most women delay their first pregnancy at a later age, women who still become preg-
nant at a young age mainly correspond to low socioeconomic status women with higher risk of
medical complication of pregnancy. Even if this study controlled a large number of variables,
we could not adjust on educational level or social insurance as this was not reported in the ini-
tial study.
The principal strength of this study is the size of the cohort with more than 165 000 patients
studied. Furthermore, the sampling represents a broad spectrum of patients, including patients
from rural and urban communities across a Canadian province. This prospective cohort

 the confounding effect of data such as the use of assisted reproductive technologies and occur-
rence of an invasive procedure has rarely been studied. Yet these factors are important, with
aORs for extreme prematurity of 1.58 (95% IC 1.06–2.33) and 1.67 (95% IC 1.29–2.16).
This study has some limitations. Some potential confounders could not be studied. BMI
information was missing in 28% of patients, therefore, it was not used in multivariate analysis.
In the population studied, obesity was more common in advanced maternal age mothers. Pre-
vious research has shown that excess weight is associated with overall prematurity before 32
weeks and induced prematurity before 37 weeks [24]. Thus, controlling for BMI could have
yielded different results. Moreover, socio-economic data were not available in the database we
used. However, a previous study has shown that in older mothers, the association between
maternal age and preterm birth was not explained by a confounding effect of socio-economic
status[18]. Another limitation of the study is that we could not adjust for history of preterm
delivery. Even though this variable was reported in the database, it was excluded from the final
analysis, due to misclassification and lack of reliability after quality control. However, it is
unlikely that previous preterm delivery would be more frequent in older women, thus reduc-
ing the risk of a confounding effect of previous preterm delivery.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study based on a large birth cohort was able to demonstrate that even after
adjustment for many potential confounders known to be associated with preterm birth,
advanced maternal age was independently associated with preterm delivery. Women of 30–34
years had the lowest risk of preterm delivery.
