Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae), was very
common in Europe till the 16th century. Here, we perform an ancient DNA study on medieval
skeletons from Denmark that show lesions specific for lepromatous leprosy (LL). First, we
test the remains for M. leprae DNA to confirm the infection status of the individuals and to
assess the bacterial diversity. We assemble 10 complete M. leprae genomes that all differ
from each other. Second, we evaluate whether the human leukocyte antigen allele
DRB1*15:01, a strong LL susceptibility factor in modern populations, also predisposed med-
ieval Europeans to the disease. The comparison of genotype data from 69 M. leprae DNA-
positive LL cases with those from contemporary and medieval controls reveals a statistically
significant association in both instances. In addition, we observe that DRB1*15:01 co-occurs
with DQB1*06:02 on a haplotype that is a strong risk factor for inflammatory diseases today.

 L
eprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Myco-
bacterium leprae (M. leprae). It was very common during the
Middle Ages in Europe, from where it almost completely
disappeared in the 16th century1. A recent ancient DNA (aDNA)
analysis has revealed a high level of M. leprae genome con-
servation over the past 1000 years, indicating that the leprosy
epidemic during the European Middle Ages was unlikely to be
due to particularly virulent strains2. Instead, other factors such as
malnutrition, co-infections, and host genetics may have increased
disease susceptibility in the medieval period. At present, leprosy is
virtually absent in Europe, but still remains a big health problem
in South-East Asia (e.g., India), North and Central Africa (Central
African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo), Oceania
(Indonesia, Papua New Guinea) and the Americas (Brazil, Mex-
ico)3. All 10 modern human M. leprae genomes sequenced up to
now fall in five distinct phylogenetic branches that show a specific
geographic distribution pattern2.
In addition to environmental factors, predisposition to leprosy
is considerably influenced by variation in immune-related genes4.
Very strong disease associations were reported for the human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) region4–6. Although the involvement of
both HLA class I and class II genes was intensively studied in
leprosy6, class II alleles, particularly in the DRB1 locus, were
shown to be most consistently associated with the disease5–8. Of
these, DRB1*15:01 is the most notable risk factor for lepromatous
leprosy (LL) in India, China, and Brazil today7–9. LL represents a
severe form of the disease, characterized by a high bacterial load
and specific lesions that can reliably be diagnosed on bones1,10.
DRB1*15:01 influences LL susceptibility in very diverse popula-
tions, therefore, it remains an interesting open question whether
the same association also existed in Europeans of the Middle
Ages. We tested this hypothesis by an aDNA analysis in medieval
skeletons with signs of LL.
Here, we isolated aDNA from remains with LL lesions from
one
locale,
the
St.
Jørgen
leprosarium
in
Odense,
Denmark11 (historically dated 1270–1550 AD; Fig. 1). First, we
analyzed extracts for the presence of M. leprae DNA to confirm
the infection status of the individuals and to assess the bacterial
diversity. We assembled 10 complete M. leprae genomes that all
differ from each other and represent three different branches.
Second, we performed an aDNA association study to evaluate
whether the risk allele DRB1*15:01 predisposed medieval Eur-
opeans to LL. The comparison of genotype data from 69 M. leprae
DNA-positive cases with those from contemporary and medieval
controls revealed a statistically significant association in both
instances. In addition, we studied the DRB1 locus and its hap-
lotype structure in more detail in the LL cases. We observed that
DRB1*15:01 co-occurred on a haplotype that also carried
DQB1*06:02; this haplotype is a strong risk factor for inflam-
matory diseases in present-day populations.
Results
Ancient association study with LL. DNA extracts from 85 spe-
cimens with LL-specific bone lesions from the St. Jørgen cemetery
were investigated for the DRB1*15:01 allele (Supplementary
Note 1). Direct Sanger sequencing of the DRB1 exon is not
possible from aDNA, because the length of the relevant exon
coding for the antigen-binding domain far exceeds the average
DNA fragment size of ancient samples and the polymorphic exon
sequence precludes the use of intra-exon primers. However, the
SNP allele rs3135388-T is an established marker for high-
throughput genotyping of DRB1*15:01 in disease studies12,13.
Genotyping a single SNP requires only a very short amplicon size,
which renders this marker much more suitable for analysis of the
highly fragmented aDNA. When we performed PCR-based
Sanger sequencing for the SNP allele in the 85 St. Jørgen speci-
mens, 69 of them contained sufficient endogenous nuclear DNA
to yield genotype data (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary
Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). These 69
LL samples also tested positive for the presence of M. leprae DNA
by shotgun high-throughput sequencing (HTS) (see below and
Supplementary Table 2, 3) and/or screening PCR (Supplementary
Data 1).
We first performed an association test for rs3135388 and
medieval leprosy considering the 69 M. leprae-positive LL
individuals from St. Jørgen as the case group and a large sample
of contemporary northern Germans as controls, using DRB1
genotype information from an extensive bone marrow database.
The rs3135388-T allele frequency in the LL individuals (0.283)
was significantly higher than in the controls (0.138; p = 9.49*10-
06, OR = 2.46; two-sided Fisher’s exact test, Fig. 2, Table 1).
Subsequently, we compared the rs3135388-T frequency in the 69
St. Jørgen individuals with genetic information from those in
medieval controls. Such a case–control study would require—
besides the herein-studied 138 alleles of our cases—another 250
alleles in controls to obtain an a priori power of 75% (see
Methods). We were able to generate genotype data from 152
randomly sampled individuals (i.e., 304 alleles) excavated from
four medieval sites in Denmark and northern Germany (Fig. 1,
Table 1, Supplementary Note 1). Although the rs3135388-T
frequencies
did
not
differ
significantly
between
the
four
cemeteries (p = 0.932, two-sided Fisher’s exact test), LL cases
from St. Jørgen showed a significant enrichment of this allele
compared to the combined set of medieval controls (0.283 vs.
0.184; p = 0.024; OR = 1.74; two-sided Fisher’s exact test, Table 1,
Fig. 2).

 M. leprae genome analysis and metagenomic screening. DNA
extracts from 68 of the 69 specimens with LL-specific bone lesions
were successfully subjected to HTS, without any prior M. leprae
or human genome enrichment (Supplementary Table 4). Damage
patterns of both human and M. leprae reads were consistent with
an ancient origin of the DNA (Supplementary Note 2, 3, Sup-
plementary Table 2, 5–9). Metagenomic analysis of the HTS reads
using MALT14 showed the typical spectrum of soil bacteria and
no signs of bacterial co-infection (Supplementary Note 3, Sup-
plementary Fig. 2, 3). For ten specimens, the M. leprae genome
coverage was sufficient to allow for de novo assemblies of the
HTS data without any enrichment bias (Supplementary Note 3,
Supplementary Table 2, 10-13). Genome-wide comparisons and
SNP effect analysis did not show any variants that would indicate
a change in virulence or function in these ten genomes (Sup-
plementary Note 3, Supplementary Data 2). We then included the
ten well-covered M. leprae genomes together with another gen-
ome from the St. Jørgen cemetery (Jørgen_625), four additional
medieval genomes and 12 modern samples, all published else-
where2, in a phylogenetic analysis. The eleven genomes from St.
Jørgen fell into 3 branches (Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 4, Sup-
plementary Fig. 4–7, Supplementary Data 3).
HTS-based HLA typing. Given the association between LL and
rs3135388-T, which is known to be statistically associated with
the presence of DRB1*15:01 in Europeans, we subsequently
focused on the HLA class II region in more detail in the medieval
LL individuals. We adapted an existing DNA capture15 method
and optimized it for short aDNA fragments. After HTS, we called
HLA alleles using a new aDNA-optimized analysis pipeline
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Depending on each sample’s aDNA
quality and resulting sequence coverage, HLA alleles were called
at two different levels of resolution, following the official HLA
nomenclature16: The broader two-digit (now also called 1st-field)
resolution defines different functional lineages of alleles, yielding
a level of separation largely equivalent to the classical serotyping
used in early transplantation medicine (e.g., DRB1*15 vs.
DRB1*01). The finer four-digit (now also called 2nd field) reso-
lution separates alleles that share functional properties but differ
in their protein sequence (e.g., DRB1*15:01 vs. DRB1*15:02,
differing in 1 out of 89 codons of the molecule’s antigen-binding
groove). Using our target capture and HTS approach, we were
able to determine two- or four-digit resolution for HLA class II
genes (Supplementary Table 14, 15). Of the 136 alleles investi-
gated (= 68 screened individuals), we succeeded in calling 82
DRB1 alleles at the two-digit level and of these, 57 alleles at the
four-digit resolution (Supplementary Table 14). In some samples,
the DNA quality and thus read coverage did not allow for more
precise allele calls. Among the 82 DRB1 alleles at two-digit
resolution, 20 were determined to belong to the DRB1*15 lineage.
In modern Europeans, by far the most common DRB1*15
molecule variant is DRB1*15:01 (allele frequency in northern
Germany: 0.138, compared with 0.007 of the second most com-
mon allele *15:02), rendering it highly likely that those DRB1*15
calls represent the allele DRB1*15:01. This was confirmed as 13 of
the 20 DRB1*15 alleles could also be called at four-digit resolu-
tion, in each case showing DRB1*15:01. If all 20 DRB1*15 alleles
were to consist of the DRB1*15:01 allele, this would result in a
frequency of 0.24, very similar to 0.28 as measured by rs3135388
in the 69 individuals. The deviation between the two frequency
estimates is owing to the much smaller number of LL cases that
could successfully be genotyped by HLA sequencing compared
with SNP genotyping. In the 43 LL samples for which allele calls
were available from both PCR- and HTS-based methods, we
confirmed
that
rs3135388-T
always
co-occurred
with
DRB1*15:01 (r2 = 1.0) (Supplementary Table 15, Supplementary
Data 1), verifying the suitability of the T allele for detecting the
presence
of
DRB1*15:01.
Interestingly,
in
all
carriers
of
DRB1*15:01 (representing 12 individuals, including one homo-
zygote), we also observed the allele DQB1*06:02. The same was
true in reverse, i.e., all individuals for which DQB1*06:02 could be
called (n = 20) also had either DRB1*15:01, DRB1*15 (not

 allowing for more precise allele call), or had an incomplete allele
call (because of insufficient aDNA quality). This observation
suggests strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two loci
(Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Table 15). The two alleles
indeed define a DRB1-DQB1 haplotype that is still found in
modern Europeans at a considerable frequency (13.3%, provided
by DKMS, Supplementary Note 6).
Binding properties of DRB1 alleles. As the binding and pre-
sentation of antigenic peptides to immune effector cells is the key
function of HLA molecules, we also explored the relative binding
properties of the detected HLA alleles17 with regard to potential
M. leprae antigens. We found that among 18 contemporarily
common DRB1 alleles, DRB1*15:01 is predicted to bind the
second-smallest
number
of
potential
M.
leprae
antigens
(DRB1*15:01: 11 out of 5345 peptides, mean of 18 DRB1 alleles:
64.7; Fig. 4). HLA binding-prediction for the entire M. leprae
proteome (516,303 unique peptides) still revealed limited relative
presentation capacity for DRB1*15:01, but to a lesser extent
(Supplementary Fig. 9). The fact that peptide binding of
DRB1*15:01 is relatively more limited when focusing on potential
antigenic proteins suggests that it might be particularly ineffective
in the context of antigen presentation. Limited antigen pre-
sentation could impair specific immunity against M. leprae
infections and thus confer susceptibility to its carriers, which is
exactly what we found in the association analysis above.
Discussion
Leprosy was endemic during the Middle Ages in Europe, where it
reached its greatest prevalence between AD 1200 and 14001. The
disease was greatly feared because it caused visible disfigurement,
was incurable and contagious. Stigmatization and social segre-
gation of patients were common in the medieval period; especially
those affected with the severe form of LL were quarantined in so-
called leprosaria or “leper houses”. Deceased LL patients were
buried in special leprosaria-associated cemeteries as, for instance,
in St. Jørgen in the Danish town of Odense10,11. In the present
aDNA study, we successfully analyzed 69 human remains from
St. Jørgen. All specimens showed typical LL bone lesions and were
M. leprae DNA-positive.
From 10 samples with the best M. leprae DNA content, com-
plete bacterial genomes were generated without any enrichment,
which—together with a previously published one2—resulted in a
total of eleven genomes from St. Jørgen alone. This high success
rate is remarkable and could be due to the very good preservation
of M. leprae DNA in general2 or certain favorable environmental
conditions at this site. It could also be a consequence of the high
bacterial load associated with the severe LL form of leprosy18. Of
note, the number of medieval M. leprae genomes published so far
(n = 15, including this study) exceeds that of modern bacteria
and has led to a considerable increase in the phylogenetic and
temporal resolution. The 11 St. Jørgen genomes differed from
each other and fell into three branches (Fig. 3, Supplementary
Note 3, 4, Supplementary Fig. 4–7). In our relatively small data
set, we did not observe any correlation between M. leprae strains
and the HLA allele DRB*15:01. We identified an ancient strain in
branch 0 with the SNP type 3K. This type has previously been
reported in medieval Hungarians and Byzantinians19,20; today it
shows a wide geographic distribution ranging from the Near East
to Oceania2,19,20. Furthermore, 10 of the 11 St. Jørgen genomes
clustered in branches 2 and 3, representing two types that were
already described in skeletons from the European Middle
Ages2,18,19. Among the St. Jørgen samples, branch 3-strains were
most abundant (n = 9) and very similar to extant strains recently
identified in European red squirrels21 (Fig. 3). Interestingly,
modern branch 3-bacteria have the ability to infect at least three
different hosts including humans and squirrels21. The presence of
so many different strains in one branch and in a rather remote
locale over a few hundred years is surprising. In view of the very
low mutation rate of the pathogen and the relatively short time
window, one would expect more similar, even identical, genomes.
This interesting observation indicates multiple sources of infec-
tion with different strains. In agreement with previous observa-
tions2,22, no variants in the M. leprae genomes were identified
that would suggest a change in bacterial virulence or function. In
particular, there were no apparent changes in the outer mem-
brane peptides that could lead to different binding affinities to
HLA class II proteins. This finding highlights the importance of
investigating host genetic factors to explain the high disease
prevalence in the medieval period.
As the HLA allele DRB1*15:01 is the most notable risk factor
for LL in various modern populations worldwide4,5,7,8, we wanted
to test the hypothesis whether this HLA allele also predisposed
Europeans to the disease during the medieval leprosy epidemic.
To this end, we conducted a two-stage association analysis for
SNP rs3135388. Its T allele is an established and reliable marker
for DRB1*15:0112,13. First, we compared rs3135388 data from 69
St. Jørgen LL samples, which were all M. leprae DNA-positive,
with those from contemporary controls. Such an analysis between
medieval and modern allele frequencies is valid under the
assumption that the common genetic make-up of the Danish
population has not significantly changed since the 11th century.
This assumption is corroborated by the observation that those 53
St. Jørgen samples that were of sufficient data quality fell within
the variability of modern northern Europeans (Fig. 5, Supple-
mentary Note 7). In addition, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
haplogroup frequencies at St. Jørgen were comparable to those of
northern Europeans today (Supplementary Data 1). These find-
ings indicate no major genome-wide changes in the Danish
population structure in the past 1000 years. Furthermore, based

 on estimates for identical-by-decent (IBD) sharing we determined
that the St. Jørgen individuals were not directly related to each
other (Supplementary Data 4, Supplementary Table 16). The
comparison of the rs3135388-T frequencies from the 69 LL cases
with the DRB1*15:01 data from modern controls revealed a sta-
tistically significant association. To strengthen this finding, we
further analyzed whether the allele frequency in the cases was
different from that of medieval controls. The controls (i) were
selected from sites that were geographically close and dated ear-
lier or contemporaneous to St. Jørgen, (ii) showed no osteological
evidence of the severe LL form of the disease and (iii) were M.
leprae DNA-negative (Supplementary Data 1). The rs3135388-T
frequency differed significantly between ancient cases and con-
trols with an odds ratio similar in size to previous reports about
DRB1*15:014,5. Notably, the medieval control frequency was
slightly but significantly higher than today (p = 0.024, OR = 1.41,
Table 1), possibly indicating weak selection against this allele
during or since medieval times. This observation raises the
question of how leprosy might have led to reduced reproductive
fitness given that affected people, at least in modern populations,
rarely die from the disease. Leprosy patients in the Middle Ages
had to endure rejection and isolation in leprosaria and were not
allowed to marry23. In addition, leprosy is known today to result
in a hormone-related decrease in fertility24,25 and a higher
vulnerability to other infections26–29. By contrast, the fact that
this allele is still the most common DRB1 allele in contemporary
northern Germany suggests that it is (and was) associated with
further and likely antagonistic fitness effects that prevented
stronger frequency declines in medieval times.
Taken together, our results demonstrate a significant associa-
tion between the HLA class II region and LL susceptibility in
medieval leprosy patients from northern Europe, involving the
DRB1*15:01 allele. As this allele is predicted to bind only a very
small number of potential M. leprae antigens, this observation
lends support to the hypothesis that limited HLA-presentation of
relevant antigens may have impaired an M. leprae-specific
immune response, leading to increased susceptibility to LL. One
could speculate that, since DRB1*15:01 apparently was one of the
most common DRB1 alleles in medieval northern Europe (or at
least in Denmark, according to the control samples), M. leprae
proteins might have evolved to evade presentation by this com-
mon allele, following a process of negative frequency-dependent
selection. However, further molecular data and comparative work
is required to address this hypothesis.
Interestingly, the DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 haplotype repre-
sents an allele combination that is still common in contemporary
Europeans30,31. Furthermore, in modern populations, it is a
strong risk factor for ulcerative colitis, sarcoidosis, and multiple

These different disease associations highlight the well-known
pleiotropy of HLA variants that affect the population frequency of
specific haplotypes and contribute to the genetic diversity in the
HLA region in general. More generally, our findings provide a
new, temporal layer of evidence for the hypothesis that ancient
epidemics such as leprosy have influenced the present-day fre-
quency of genetic factors associated with modern inflammatory
diseases36,37.
Methods
Selection of archeological specimens. In the current study, human skeletal
remains were obtained from five medieval cemeteries in Denmark and northern
Germany (Fig. 1, Supplementary Note 1). The specimens were analyzed with
permission from the respective museums and collections (Horsens Museum,
Museum Lolland-Falster, Odense Bys Museer, Sydvestjyske Museer, Arch-
äologisches Landesmuseum der Stiftung Schleswig Holsteinische Landesmuseen
Schloss Gottorf). Osteological information (sex, age at death, leprosy status) of all
individuals was collected. Individuals who suffered from LL and were buried at the
leprosarium cemetery of St. Jørgen in Odense are considered cases in our study.
Given the high infection prevalence, people interred at ordinary cemeteries might
also have been infected. However, if this was the case, they were affected with a
milder form of the disease, as evidenced from osteological analysis. These indivi-
duals were here regarded as controls. They were selected from the four sites Ribe,
Revshale, Tirup, and Schleswig/Rathausmarkt that were geographically close and
dated earlier or contemporaneous to Odense/St. Jørgen.
Sample processing. Material from each selected skeleton was collected in person
by a member of the Kiel aDNA group or a member of the Odense ADBOU group
to minimize the risks of contamination. Two different types of samples were taken:
teeth and/or petrous bones (Supplementary Data 1). The DNA extractions and pre-
PCR steps were carried out in clean room facilities dedicated to aDNA research.
Following the guidelines on contamination control in aDNA studies38–40, all sur-
faces and re-usable utensils were extensively cleaned with bleach before and after
work. Besides, UV lights were used to improve the decontamination process. In
addition, negative controls were included in each step involving non-indexed DNA
molecules. Finally, access of staff and objects to the laboratories was restricted to a
one-direction route from the pre-PCR rooms to the post-PCR facility. The post-
PCR room was located in an independent building. This room was used to run the
screening and indexing PCRs (the reaction mixes were prepared beforehand in the
dedicated pre-PCR rooms) and to process the indexed PCR products (purification,
amplification). As for the pre-PCR laboratories, no modern leprosy studies had
ever been conducted there prior to the start of this project.
Whole teeth were cleaned in pure bleach solution (sodium hypochlorite) and
rinsed with purified water. After drying at 37 °C overnight, the samples were
ground in a ball mill homogenizer for 45 s at maximum speed. Petrous bones were
cleaned in pure bleach solution (sodium hypochlorite), rinsed with purified water
and dried overnight at 37 °C. The inner ear (cochlea and vestibule) was cut out with
a bone saw. Subsequently, the cleaned (with bleach analogous to the petrous bone)
and dried inner ear piece was ground in a ball mill homogenizer for 45 s at
maximum speed.
DNA extraction for PCR assays. After grinding, 50 mg of bone powder were
incubated in 500 µL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; pH 8, 0.5 M) and 20
µL proteinase K (0.25 mg/mL) under gentle rotation at 37 °C overnight. The
suspension was centrifuged for 3 min at 6000 rpm and 200 µL of the supernatant
were used for DNA extraction with the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced Investigator Kit
(program setting “Trace”). Purified DNA was eluted in 50 µL TE buffer and stored
at −20 °C until further use. One negative control was processed per five samples41.
DNA extraction for HTS. A total of 50 mg of bone powder were incubated in 960
µL EDTA (pH 8, 0.5 M) and 40 µL proteinase K (0.25 mg/mL) under gentle

published protocol by Dabney et al.42.
PCR-based experiments. For this study, the following three PCR-based setups
were carried out: M. leprae DNA screening (RLEP and 18-kDA), nuclear DNA
SNP rs3135388 and mtDNA (hypervariable regions I and II) analysis. PCRs were
performed in a 25-µL volume containing 1× Immolase buffer (Bioline), 0.04 U/µL
Immolase DNA Polymerase (Bioline), 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Bioline), 4% DMSO, 200
µM dNTP mix (Bioline) and 0.4 µM of each primer (see Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Fig. 1 for primer and amplicon details). For the M. leprae and
the SNP screening, 5 µL of aDNA extract were used as template. For the mtDNA
PCR, the amount of extract added was 1 µL. The annealing temperatures were
52 °C (M. leprae DNA screening), 58 °C (SNP PCR) or 60 °C (mtDNA screening),
respectively. PCR success was evaluated by gel electrophoresis. Subsequent Sanger
sequencing was performed following standard procedures.
PCR-based M. leprae DNA screening. All 85 samples from the St. Jørgen cem-
etery and all 223 controls were subjected to PCR-based M. leprae DNA screen-
ing2,18. Two primer pairs were used to amplify regions coding for RLEP (130 bp)
and the 18-kDa protein (98 bp). A sample was considered positive for M. leprae
when at least one PCR yielded a product of the expected length and sequence. If the
amplicon did not match the expected sequence, a nucleotide BLAST was performed
to identify possible contamination sources.
PCR-based genotyping of rs3135388. According to de Bakker et al. (2006)12, the
T allele at SNP locus rs3135388 is in almost complete LD with the HLA-
DRB1*15:01 allele in the CEU population. With the designed SNP primers (Sup-
plementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1), the T/C variant rs3135388 was detected
on the forward and reverse strand by Sanger sequencing. Three hundred and eight
specimens (85 cases from St. Jørgen and 223 controls) were tested for this locus in
the following manner: (1) For the St. Jørgen samples that provided HLA-DRB1
data (n=43), PCRs were performed independently at least two times per extract.
(2) For the 26 St. Jørgen samples for which no HLA-DRB1 data were available but
SNP amplicons could be generated, PCRs were performed between 7 and 11 times
per specimen using a minimum of two independent extracts (exceptions: sample
G417 only five replicates, sample G859 only six replicates). (3) For the 16
remaining St. Jørgen samples, neither HLA-DRB1 data nor SNP genotypes could
be generated. (4) For the controls, PCRs were performed independently at least two
times per extract. For 43% of control samples, PCRs were performed independently
at least four times.
Only individuals with consistent results were included in the statistical analysis.
However, allelic drop-out is a common problem when amplifying aDNA41, and a
heterozygote might erroneously be determined as a homozygote43,44. We therefore
randomly selected 32 specimens (marked in Supplementary Data 1) that showed
homozygous genotypes (either TT or CC) after the first round of PCR. For each of
them, we performed between 7 and 11 PCRs as recommended43,44 using a
minimum of two independent extracts. For each individual, the homozygous state
was confirmed in all replicates.
PCR-based human mtDNA analysis. MtDNA studies were performed with all
308 samples by sequencing parts of the hypervariable regions I (150 bp and 183 bp)
and II (253 bp)45. For a random subset of 27 samples, new aDNA extracts were
generated and used for a replication. In these cases, the haplogroup classification
was confirmed. Haplogroups were assigned with Haplogrep 2.0 (http://haplogrep.
uibk.ac.at/). Haplogroups showing a quality score below 100% were manually re-
evaluated by consulting the established mtDNA phylogeny (www.phylotree.org).
Statistical association analysis. For the recruitment of medieval controls, the
required sample size was calculated with the software G*Power, v3.1.9.2. For the
available 138 alleles of our medieval LL samples and under the assumption of an
odds ratio of 2.04,5, another 250 alleles in controls are required to obtain an a priori
power of 75% at a significance level of 0.05. The comparisons of allele frequencies
of DRB1*15:01/rs3135388 between different populations were performed with
Fisher’s exact test with the software R, v3.2.246.
Shotgun HTS. For each sample, two double-stranded DNA sequencing libraries
were prepared according to an established, but slightly modified protocol for
multiplex high-throughput sequencing47.
First library: UDG-treated libraries were prepared in a 50-µL volume containing
20 µL of DNA extract, 1× NEB buffer 2 (New England Biolabs), 300 µM dNTPs
(each), 0.005 mg/mL BSA, 1mM ATP, 20 U T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and 3 U USER enzyme (Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent, New
England Biolabs). The reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, 6
U T4 DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added and the reaction
mix was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and at 10 °C for 5 min.
Second library: non-UDG-treated libraries were prepared in a 50-µL volume
containing 20 µL of DNA extract, 1× NEB buffer 2 (New England Biolabs), 300 µM
dNTPs (each), 0.005 mg/mL BSA, 1mM ATP, 20 U T4 Polynucleotide Kinase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1.2 U T4 Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
Both library preparations were continued as follows: After purification with the
MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) (elution volume 18 µL), adapter ligation
was done in a 40-µL volume containing 18 µL DNA, 1× Quick Ligase buffer (New
England Biolabs), 2.5 µM adapter mix (Solexa) and 0.5 U Quick Ligase (New
England Biolabs). The mix was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After
another MinElute purification step (elution volume 20 µL), adapter fill-in was
performed in a 40-µL volume containing 1× ThermoPol buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 125 µM dNTPs and 16 U BSM DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then at 80 °C
for 20 min.
Sample-specific indices were added to both library adapters via amplification
with two index primers (i7, i5). Extraction and library blanks were treated in the
same manner.
For UDG-treated libraries, indexing PCRs were performed in a 50-µL volume
containing 10 µL template DNA, 1× AccuPrime Pfx reaction mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 1.25 U AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.3
µM P5 DNA primer and 0.3 µM P7 DNA primer. PCR conditions were as follows:
95 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of (95 °C for 15 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds, 68 °C for
70 seconds).
For non-UDG-treated libraries, indexing PCRs were performed in a 50 µL
volume containing 10 µL template DNA, 1× PfuTurbo Cx reaction buffer, 200 µM
dNTPs, 2.5 U PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies), 0.3
µM i7 DNA primer and 0.3 µM i5 DNA primer. PCR conditions were as follows:
95 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of (95 °C for 30 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for
60 seconds), elongation step of 72 °C for 10 min.
Both indexed DNA libraries were purified with the MinElute PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 50 µL
elution buffer.
A second amplification step was performed for all indexed libraries in 50-µL
reactions containing 5 µL indexed library template, 1.25 U AccuPrime Pfx DNA
Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× AccuPrime Pfx reaction mix (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and 0.3 µM IS5 (5’-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA-3’) and IS6
(5’-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3’) primers that bind to the adapters of the
indexed libraries. Amplified products were purified with the MinElute PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen) (elution volume 53 µL) and quantified using the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip. The sequencing was carried out on the Illumina
HiSeq 2500 (2 × 125 bp) and HiSeq 4000 (2 × 75 bp) platform at the Institute of
Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel University, using the HiSeq v4 chemistry and the
manufacturer’s protocol for multiplex sequencing.
HLA capture and HTS. In this study, HLA regions were enriched with an in-
solution bait capture and the SureSelectXT Target Enrichment System (Illumina)
for the Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing library. Using a UDG-treated
sequencing library and a custom bait library designed by Michael Wittig et al.15,
the classical class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and class II HLA genes (HLA-DRB1,
HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA, and HLA-DPB1) were enriched in 68 St.
Jørgen samples. Samples were pooled (up to four) per capture with 800 ng of
library DNA per pool in a volume of 3.4 µL. Hybridization buffer and blocking
reagent were handled according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As the captured
samples were indexed already, 1 µL of each IS5 and IS6 primers (100 µM) were
used for indexing/amplification instead of the primers provided in the capture kit.
The post-capture PCR cycle number was set to 12. Purification of the amplified
captured libraries was performed according to the protocol using AMPure XP
beads. The quality of the captured library pools was assessed on the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity DNA Assay. The sequencing was carried out
on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 (2 × 75 cycles) platform at the Institute of Clinical
Molecular Biology, Kiel University, using the HiSeq v4 chemistry and the manu-
facturer’s protocol for multiplex sequencing.
Bioinformatic analysis. Multiple HTS data sets were generated for the 68 indi-
viduals from St. Jørgen. The data sets were pre-processed (adapter clipping, mer-
ging, trimming) according to published protocols specific for aDNA using the
EAGER pipeline48.
Genome-wide analysis of M. leprae. Multiple HTS data sets were generated for
68 of the 85 individuals from St. Jørgen. These data sets were pre-processed
according to published protocols specific for aDNA48. The reads were then aligned
to the M. leprae TN reference genomes applying established algorithms. Post-
processing included the identification of genomic variation, effect prediction of
SNPs, the de novo assembly of the bacterial genomes and metagenomic screening
as well as phylogenetic analyses and the identification of HLA allele combinations.
A detailed description of each step is given below.
Pre-processing of ancient genomes: The data sets produced for all ancient
samples contained paired-end reads with varying numbers of overlapping
nucleotides as well as artificial adapter sequences. We used ClipAndMerge v1.7.3, a
module of the EAGER pipeline48, to clip adapter sequences, merge corresponding
paired-end reads in overlapping regions and to trim the resulting reads. These steps

 are explained in detail below. We used the default options with the following
command:
java -jar ClipAndMerge.jar -in1 $FASTQ1 -in2 $FASTQ2 \
-f AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC \
-r AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTA \
-l 25 -qt -q 20 -o $output_file
where $FASTQ1 and $FASTQ2 are the two gzipped FASTQ input files.
ClipAndMerge uses an overlap alignment of the respective forward or reverse
adapter with the 3′ end of each read in order to remove sequencing adapter
sequences. Regions at the 3′ end of each read that were contained in the alignment
were clipped. Reads that were shorter than 25 nucleotides after adapter clipping or
contained only adapter sequences (adapter dimmers) were removed. All remaining
reads were then used in the merging step. Merging was performed for all remaining
paired reads with a minimum overlap of 10 nucleotides and at most 5%
mismatches in the overlap region. The algorithm selected the maximal overlap
fulfilling these criteria. The consensus sequence was generated using the
nucleotides in the overlap regions from the read with the higher PHRED quality
score, maximizing the quality of the resulting read. In a final step, ClipAndMerge
performed quality trimming of the reads and all nucleotides with PHRED scores
smaller than 20 were trimmed from the 3′ end of each read. Finally, all reads with
fewer than 25 nucleotides after quality trimming were removed. The resulting high-
quality reads were used for the alignment against the M. leprae TN reference
genome (NC_002677) with Bowtie249 v2.2.7. In this step, all reads were treated as
single-end reads and mapping was performed using semi-global alignment mode
and default parameters. The following command was used:
bowtie2 -t –mp 1,1 –ignore-quals –score-min L,0,-0.05 \
–no-unal -x $REF -U $FASTQ – S $SAM
where $REF is the reference FASTA file, $FASTQ is the gzipped input FASTQ
file and $SAM is the output SAM file.
After the alignment, the SAM files were converted into BAM files, which were
sorted and indexed using SAMtools v1.3 with default parameters and the following
commands:
samtools view -h -q 0 -bS $SAM -o $BAM
samtools sort -o $OUT -T $TMP $BAM
samtools index $OUT
where $SAM is the bowtie2 output, $BAM is the converted BAM file, $TMP is a
temporary file and $OUT is the final sorted BAM file.
All individual-specific final BAM files were concatenated using the
MergeSamFiles algorithm of picard tools v1.139 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/
picard) and indexed using SAMtools. We used the default parameters with the
following commands:
java -jar picard.jar MergeSamFiles I=$BAMs O=$OUT
samtools index $OUT
where $BAMs is a string containing all individual-specific BAM files to be
concatenated, separated by whitespace, and $OUT is the concatenated BAM file.
We used DeDup v0.9.9, part of the EAGER pipeline48, to identify and remove
all duplicate reads in the individual-specific BAM files with the default options and
the following command:
java -jar DeDup.jar -i $IN -o $OUT
where $IN is the input BAM file and $OUT is the output BAM file.
To authenticate aDNA data sets, we evaluated the presence of postmortem
DNA damage signatures from read alignments using mapDamage50 v2.0.6 with
default parameters and the following command:
mapDamage -v -i $BAM -r $REF -l 100 -d $PREFIX
where $BAM is the input BAM file containing only merged reads, $REF is the
reference FASTA file used for the alignment and $PREFIX is a string containing
the full path and an optional prefix for the output.
After alignment and duplicate removal, genomic variation was identified with
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)51 v3.6. First, a local realignment of the
individual-specific BAM files was performed with the RealignerTargetCreator and
the IndelRealigner modules of GATK51. Subsequently, the UnifiedGenotyper
module was applied to call reference bases and variants from the alignment.
Default parameters were used in the following commands:
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator \
-R $REF -I $BAM -o $INTERVALS
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T IndelRealigner \
-R $REF -I $BAM -targetIntervals $INTERVALS -o $REALIGNED
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T UnifiedGenotyper \
-R $REF -I $REALIGNED -o $VCF -mbq 15 -rf MappingQuality \
-mmq 20 -strand_call_conf 50 –sample_ploidy 2 -dcov 250 \
–output_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES
where the variable $REF is the FASTA file of the used reference genome, $BAM
is the final alignment BAM file after duplicate removal, $INTERVALS are the
target intervals for the local realignment, $REALIGNED is the output from the
local realignment and $VFC is the output variant call set in VCF format.
To annotate an estimated effect of identified genomic variation, the software
SnpEff52 v4.2 was applied. We used the default parameters and the following
command line:
java -jar snpEff.jar eff $GFF $VCF
where $GFF is a previously set up database based on a GFF file and $VCF is the
out VCF file. We used the GFF file from NCBI for M. leprae (NC_002677) to build
the database for SnpEff52.
To analyze the effects of single SNPs, the VCF files containing the lists of
annotated SNPs for each sample were merged using the following command
available from VCFtools53:
vcf-merge sample1.vcf.gz [...] sampleX.vcf.gz | \
bgzip –c > merged.all.emit.confident.sites.vcf.gz
Variant annotations of upstream and downstream SNPs located further than
100 bases away from a gene were ignored. The annotations were manually
completed with information about transcript type and function available on the
NCBI and Mycobrowser databases. The results were compiled into a table
containing information for each SNP regarding its effect on the genes in the strains
in which the SNP occurs (Supplementary Data 2). In vivo phenotypic studies
confirming the in silico annotations are rare because it is currently impossible to
grow M. leprae in culture. Therefore, most of the predicted gene functions are
based on comparisons with M. tuberculosis and numerous genes remain annotated
as hypothetical proteins whose functions are unknown. Variants for which there is
enough information available to perform in silico evaluation of the variant effects
were selected by removing all variants with the following annotated effects: (1)
Intergenic, upstream, downstream: The understanding of M. leprae intergenic
regions is insufficient at present to estimate the effects of the intergenic variants on
gene expression genes. (2) Hypothetical protein and pseudogene: No sufficient
information was available on the transcripts. (3) Stable RNAs: The variants in
annotated stable RNAs were removed so that the focus was on protein variants. (4)
Variants present in only one genome: This filtering step was performed to focus on
common variants.
Extracted mapping reads of ten high-coverage data sets (G34, G154, G404,
G427, G507, G533, G722, G749, G1083, and G1149), covering the complete M.
leprae reference genome (NC_002677.1) at least 10-fold, were de novo assembled
using the SPAdes genome assembler54 v3.5.0 with the following settings:
spades.py -t 8 -m 60 -k 121 –careful -s $IN -o $OUT
where $IN is a FASTQ file containing the mapped reads and $OUT is the
output folder for SPAdes54.
Other samples were not assembled as their respective data sets did not match
the previously described threshold of a 10-fold coverage of the complete M. leprae
reference genome. All possible values for the k parameter were tried with k = 121
yielding the best result with respect to the contig mean, N50, maximal contig size
and number of produced contigs. The multiple genome alignment software Mauve
v.2.4.055,56 was used to reorder the resulting contigs relative to the M. leprae TN
reference genome for subsequent calculation of the genomic coverage. The
reordering in Mauve55,56 was executed with default parameters for the Mauve
Contig Mover (MCM).
Shotgun sequencing data of multiple sequencing runs was pooled after pre-
processing for the samples G34, G154, G404, G427, G507, G533, G722, G749,
G1083, and G1149. The pooled reads were used to carry out a metagenomic
de novo assembly with the Megahit assembler v1.0.3-8-g4b5271e57. The following
command line was used:
megahit --presets meta -r IN -o OUT, where IN is a file containing the pre
−processed reads, OUT is the output directory.
For subsequent calculation of the genome coverage, contigs from the assemblies
with a length of > 500 bases were blasted (v2.2.30) against the M. leprae strain TN
genome. The following command line was used:
blastn -evalue 10e-6 -perc_identity 95 -outfmt "6 qseqid" \
-query $IN -out $OUT -db $REF
where $IN is a file containing the contigs, $OUT is the output file of blast and
$REF is the blast database. Subsequently, the MCM was used as described above to
calculate the genomic coverage for the contigs that mapped to the M. leprae TN
genome.
Metagenome screening. All UDG-treated samples derived from teeth (n=68)
were screened for their metagenomic content with the alignment tool MALT14 and
the metagenome analyzer MEGAN [58]. After pre-processing, as described above,
MALT14 v0_3_6 was used to align all samples against a collection of all complete
bacterial genomes in FASTA format downloaded from the NCBI FTP server (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/). We used MALT14 in BlastN mode
with the following command line:
malt-run –inFile $IN –index $REF –output $OUT -id 85.0 -v \
-m BlastN -at SemiGlobal -top 1 -supp 0 \
-mq 100 -ssc -sps
where $IN is a FASTQ file after pre-processing, $REF is the MALT index,
$OUT is output folder for MALT14.
Subsequently, MEGAN58 v6_4_15 was used to compute the taxonomical
content, while pathogen screening was performed manually. Potentially interesting
bacteria were selected for a specific alignment against the respective reference
genome with Bowtie249 v2.2.7. The following parameters were used:

 positions that were covered by at least five reads. Genome drafts were generated
using the respective variant or reference alleles of these loci. Variant alleles were
only used if the fraction of mapped reads containing the variation was at least 90%,
otherwise the reference allele was used instead. If a reference locus was not
sufficiently covered, the character “N” was inserted at the respective position.
A multiple genome alignment of 33 M. leprae genomes was computed using the
progressive Mauve algorithm55 integrated in the whole genome alignment software
Mauve56 v2.4.0. The sequences of the ten medieval genomes G34, G154, G404,
G427, G507, G533, G722, G749, G1083, and G1149, five previously published
medieval genomes (3077, Jorgen_625, Refshale_16, SK2, and SK8) and seventeen
previously published modern genomes2,21 (S2, S9, S10, S11, S13, S14, S15, Brw-01,
Brw-05, Brw-10, Brw-12, Brw-20, Brw-25, TN, BR4923, Thai53, and NHDP63)
were included in the alignment. Mauve’s SNP export function was used to generate
FASTA files for each data set that contained all sites that were variable among all
genomes. These SNP assemblies were merged into a multi FASTA file and then
used as input for MEGA759 to perform the phylogenetic analyses.
MEGA759 v7.0.18 was used to create maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor-
joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) trees. All sequences included in the
multiple alignment were used in all three tree reconstructions. In a separate
analysis rooted MP, NJ, and ML trees were generated using M. avium 104
(NC_008595.1) as outgroup.
Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm (search level 1) was applied to construct
the MP tree. Random addition of sequence (10 replicates) was used to obtain the
initial trees. Maximum likelihood model selection analysis of the MEGA package
(default parameters) was used to assess the best model for the evolutionary
distances in the NJ and ML tree. The model with the lowest BIC value was chosen
(Supplementary Data 3). The Tamura 3-parameter model60 and uniform rate for
all sites was the best model for the alignment without the outgroup. This model was
also used for the alignment including the outgroup. The NJ and ML trees were then
constructed using the Tamura 3-parameter model60, uniform rates and default
settings in MEGA59. Bootstrap values were inferred from 500 replicates in all three
reconstruction methods.
The analysis involved 32 (33 with outgroup) nucleotide sequences. In the
alignments, positions were not used that had less than 95% site coverage. The final
data set comprised a total of 955 (547,078 with outgroup) informative positions.
Genome-wide analysis of Homo sapiens and population genetics. Each of the
68 individual-specific HTS data sets was pre-processed during the genome-wide
analysis of M. leprae, as described above. After adapter clipping, merging, quality
trimming, and quality control, the reads were additionally aligned to the human
reference genome hg38. Post-processing included the identification of genomic
variation, mtDNA haplotyping, sex assignment, principal component analysis and
the estimation of IBD. A detailed description of these methods follows below.
After pre-processing, the resulting high-quality reads were mapped for each
data set individually against the H. sapiens reference genome hg38 (GRCh38),
downloaded from UCSC (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/
bigZips/) using Bowtie249 v2.2.7. In this step, all reads were treated as single-end
reads and mapping was performed using semi-global alignment mode and default
parameters. The following command was used:
bowtie2 -t –mp 1,1 –ignore-quals –score-min L,0,-0.05 \
–no-unal -x $REF -U $FASTQ – S $SAM
where $REF is the reference FASTA file, $FASTQ is the gzipped input FASTQ
file and $SAM is the output SAM file.
After the alignment, the SAM files were converted into BAM files which were
sorted and indexed using SAMtools v1.3 with default parameters and the following
commands:
samtools view -h -q 0 -bS $SAM -o $BAM
samtools sort -o $OUT -T $TMP $BAM
samtools index $OUT
where $SAM is the bowtie249 output, $BAM is the converted BAM file, $TMP is
a temporary file, and $OUT is the final sorted BAM file.
All individual-specific final BAM files were concatenated using the
MergeSamFiles algorithm of picard tools v1.139 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/
picard) and indexed with SAMtools. We used the default parameters with the
following commands:
java -jar picard.jar MergeSamFiles I=$BAMs O=$OUT
samtools index $OUT
where $BAMs is a string containing all individual-specific BAM files to be
concatenated, separated by whitespace, and $OUT is the concatenated BAM file.
We used DeDup v0.9.9, part of the EAGER pipeline48, to identify and remove
all duplicate reads in the individual-specific BAM files with the default options and
the following command:
java -jar DeDup.jar -i $IN -o $OUT
where $IN is the input BAM file and $OUT is the output BAM file.
To authenticate aDNA data sets, we evaluated the presence of postmortem
DNA damage signatures from read alignments using mapDamage50 v2.0.6 with
default parameters and the following command:
mapDamage -v -i $BAM -r $REF -l 100 -d $PREFIX
where $BAM is the input BAM file containing only merged reads, $REF is the
reference FASTA file used for the alignment, and $PREFIX is a string containing
the full path and an optional prefix for the output.
The alignment of high-quality reads against the H. sapiens reference genome
hg38 was performed analogous to the M. leprae alignment using bowtie249 and the
same settings as described above. The removal of duplicates and the evaluation of
damage patterns with DeDup and mapDamage, respectively, were also performed
according to the protocols described above. Genomic variation was identified using
the haplotype caller module of GATK51 v3.6 based on the alignment data sets.
First, a local realignment of the individual-specific BAM files was performed with
the RealignerTargetCreator and the IndelRealigner modules of GATK51.
Subsequently, the UnifiedGenotyper module was applied to call reference bases and
variants from the alignment. Default parameters were used in the following
commands:
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T RealignerTargetCreator \
-R $REF -I $BAM -o $INTERVALS
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T IndelRealigner \
-R $REF -I $BAM -targetIntervals $INTERVALS -o $REALIGNED
java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T UnifiedGenotyper \
-R $REF -I $REALIGNED -o $VCF -mbq 15 -rf MappingQuality \
-mmq 20 -strand_call_conf 50 –sample_ploidy 2 -dcov 250 \
–output_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES
where the variable $REF is the FASTA file of the used reference genome, $BAM
is the final alignment BAM file after duplicate removal, $INTERVALS are the
target intervals for the local realignment, $REALIGNED is the output from the
local realignment, and $VFC is the output variant call set in VCF format.
For determination of sex, we computed the “read densities” dX, dY for the X
and Y chromosomes, respectively, as the ratio of the number of reads mapped to
the respective chromosome by its total chromosomal length (156,040,895 and
57,227,415 bp, respectively).
We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to pseudohomozygous calls
obtained by randomly sampling alleles at genomic positions that are biallelic in the
European individuals in the 1000 Genomes data set (release 20130502)61.
Genotypes with alleles other than those observed in the European samples from the
1000 Genomes project were excluded as likely errors. We used the smartpca
software (v13050) with default parameters for outlier detection (numoutlierevec 10,
outliersigmathresh 6) to conduct the PCA. Overall, 463 of 503 European samples
from the 1000 Genomes project and 53 of 68 individuals from St. Jørgen remained
for analysis. The lsqproject parameter was used for projection of samples with
differentially missing genotypes onto a single plot.
To assess the degree of relatedness between individuals, we used the software
lcmlkin62 v0.5.0 for estimating expected IBD sharing, π ̂, between pairs of
individuals and the accompanying script SNPbam2vcf for computing genotype
likelihoods. The set of SNPs included in these calculations was restricted to
positions that were reported as being biallelic in the European 1000 Genomes
populations. In addition, only those SNPs that were covered by at least four reads
(after removal of duplicates) in at least two individuals were considered for the
computations. Finally, default quality filters were applied using SNPbam2vcf (MQ
≥ 20, BQ ≥ 5, GQ ≥ 0.1).
Identification of HLA allele combinations. Even after enrichment and deep
sequencing, the highly degraded and fragmented nature of aDNA led to a low and
incomplete coverage of the HLA region. This prevents the use of most computa-
tional HLA genotyping algorithms that are designed for high-coverage and high-
quality sequence data. Furthermore, the allele combinations present in the samples
might include unknown alleles that are undetectable by approaches that compare
the reads only to modern reference sequences. We therefore used a semi-manual
approach, where we performed an automated read selection and sorting procedure,
followed by manual filtering and allele identification. These steps are described in
detail below.
To select all reads from DNA fragments belonging to the HLA class II region in
our data sets, we first generated a comprehensive reference file, containing all
known four-digit (2nd field resolution) alleles of the exon coding for the peptide-
binding groove of the classical HLA class II genes (HLA-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1,
-DQB1, -DRA, -DRB1). In order to prevent mis-mapping and the resulting mis-
identification of reads due to paralogous sequence similarity, we also included all
known corresponding alleles for the non-classical genes HLA-DRB3, -DRB4,
-DRB5, -DRB6, -DRB7, and -DRB9. Sequences were downloaded from the IMGT/
HLA database63 (accessed 28 July 15). In addition, we included a corresponding
exon sequence of HLA-DQB2 from the human reference genome (not represented
in the IMGT/HLA database), again to prevent their reads to be mis-identified as
HLA-DQB1 variants. We did not consider intron sequences, as these evolve rather
neutrally and may contain ancient variation that could be misleading during the
identification of functional HLA alleles. All sequence variants for a given locus were
initially aligned using MUSCLE64 and then evaluated manually in BioEdit65.
The actual read alignment was performed using Bowtie249 v2.2.7 in local
alignment and ‘-a reporting mode’, allowing each read to map against multiple
alleles. We used the following command:
bowtie2 -a -t --ma 1 --mp 1,1 --local --ignore-quals \
--score-min L,0,1 --no-unal -x $REF -U $FASTQ –S $SAM
where $REF is the reference FASTA file, $FASTQ is the gzipped input FASTQ
file and $SAM is the output SAM file.
The resulting alignment contained all mapped reads and, in case of an
unspecific mapping, multiple instances of the same read sequence, one for each

9
 distinct mapping locus. All instances of the same sequence fragment (representing
PCR duplicates) were noted and then collapsed per gene. The name and number of
all mapping loci and alleles, respectively, were also noted. The sequences were then
grouped by gene specificity—for each gene, the resulting set of sequences was
inversely ordered according to the number of genes they would map to and then
sorted by the starting position within the corresponding allele (Supplementary
Fig. 7). This set of sequences was saved to a FASTA file for each sample.
Sample-specific FASTA files were used for each HLA gene to generate
consensus sequences of the allele combination present in the sample. The GUI-
based sequence alignment editor BioEdit v7.2.565 was used to display and sort the
sequence reads representing the two alleles and identify sequences with PCR/
sequencing errors (Supplementary Fig. 7). Overlapping reads that shared the same
combination of variation were collapsed into a consensus sequence. If a read
showed variants that were not supported by other overlapping reads, most likely
representing PCR or sequencing errors, the read was discarded. Most emphasis was
given to reads that were specific to the evaluated locus (i.e., did not map to other
HLA genes) and to reads that were represented by multiple exact PCR duplicates
(making it less likely that they represent sequencing errors).
The consensus sequences were manually compared with a reference alignment
of all known four-digit alleles of the corresponding HLA gene and matching alleles
were identified. Here we made use of the allele frequency information implicitly
included in the HLA nomenclature: As four-digit alleles were named with a
consecutive numbering scheme in the order of their discovery, the second set of
digits roughly indicates their frequency (common alleles were discovered earlier
than rare alleles). We therefore focused first on the first 10 four-digit alleles of each
two-digit allele group, and if we identified one or more alleles that perfectly
matched the given consensus sequences, we did not look for additional matches in
the rarer alleles. In case of multiple equally well matching known alleles, we first
recorded all of them, but eventually reported only the two-digit allele name (we
never found equally well matching alleles from different two-digit allele groups).
The identified full-length allele sequences were then again compared to a sample’s
given read alignment to verify that the identified alleles were supported by all high
confidence reads. As there was an a priori expectation to find certain DRB1 alleles
among the leprosy cases, we recoded the names of all known alleles in the DRB1
reference alignment to allow for an observer-blinded allele call. The true allele
names were only revealed after allele calls for DRB1 had been completed.
Replication of manual allele call for DRB1. The manual read filtering and allele
call for each sample was performed by one of three different researchers. In order
to evaluate reproducibility of our allele call approach, we obtained consistent DRB1
genotype calls by two different researchers for 14 of the 68 samples. Of the 28 allele
calls, 28 (100%) matched at the two-digit level (representing functional serotypes)
and 14 (50%) matched exactly at the four-digit level (identical protein sequences).
In 12 of the 14 called alleles that did not match exactly, the two replicate calls could
not identify a unique four-digit allele sequence but overlapped in the range of
possible four-digit alleles. Only in two cases did the allele calls lead to two different
four-digit alleles, resulting in one and two nucleotide mismatches, respectively,
over the length of the entire typed exon sequence (270 bp). Overall, this results in
99.96% reproducibility at the nucleotide level (3/7560 mismatches).
Prediction of M. leprae peptide binding by HLA-DRB1 variants. We used the
IEDB-AR consensus algorithm66 to computationally predict the repertoire of
bound M. leprae peptides for all DRB1 variants (at 2nd field resolution) with a
frequency of >1% in representative population samples from Schleswig-Holstein/
Germany (n = 129,336) and a Danish minority population from northern Ger-
many (n = 918), both included in the DKMS database. We first predicted DRB1
allele-specific binding (rank threshold for binding: ≤0.5) to all possible 15-mer
peptides (n = 5345) of 19 M. leprae outer membrane proteins that were previously
identified as likely antigenic, harboring known T- and B-cell epitopes67 (Fig. 3). We
subsequently also predicted DRB1 allele-specific binding to all possible 15-mer
peptides using the entire M. leprae proteome (n = 516,303 peptides; Ensembl
accession: ASM19585v1, Supplementary Fig. 9).
