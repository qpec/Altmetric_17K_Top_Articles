The small intestine contains CD4+CD8aa+ double-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes
(DP IELs), which originate from intestinal CD4+ T cells through down-regulation of
the transcription factor Thpok and have regulatory functions. DP IELs are absent in
germ-free mice, which suggests that their differentiation depends on microbial factors.
We found that DP IEL numbers in mice varied in different vivaria, correlating with
the presence of Lactobacillus reuteri. This species induced DP IELs in germ-free mice
and conventionally-raised mice lacking these cells. L. reuteri did not shape the
DP-IEL-TCR (TCR, T cell receptor) repertoire but generated indole derivatives of
tryptophan that activated the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor in CD4+ T cells, allowing
Thpok down-regulation and differentiation into DP IELs. Thus, L. reuteri, together
with a tryptophan-rich diet, can reprogram intraepithelial CD4+ T cells into
immunoregulatory T cells.
T
he gut microbiota drives maturation and
function of the immune system (1–3). Sev-
eral bacterial taxa shape the differentiation
of naïve T cells: Segmented filamentous
bacteria (SFB) bias CD4+ T cells toward a
T helper 17 (TH17) cell fate (4), Clostridia clusters
IV and XIVa promote CD4+ regulatory T cell (Treg)
differentiation (5, 6), and Bacteroides fragilis
(7, 8) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (9) in-
duce CD4+ T cells that secrete interleukin-10
(IL-10). The small intestinal epithelium contains
a distinctive population of CD4+CD8aa+ T cell
receptor (TCR) ab T cells [referred to as double-
positive intraepithelial lymphocytes (DP IELs)]
(10). These cells have a regulatory function com-
plementary to that of Tregs and promote toler-
ance to dietary antigens (11). DP IELs originate
from lamina propria CD4+ T cells that include
but are not limited to Tregs (11). Upon reaching
the epithelium, these cells reactivate the CD8+
T cell lineage program through down-regulation
of Thpok and up-regulation of Runx3 and T-bet
(12–14). This process is facilitated in part by
transforming growth factor–b (TGFb), retinoic
acid, interferon-g (IFN-g), and IL-27 (12, 14). The
lack of DP IELs in germ-free (GF) mice (11, 13)
indicates that the intestinal microbiota is re-
quired for their differentiation, although the
bacterial taxa and metabolites required are not
known.
We observed that mice born at one of our
vivaria [specialized research facility (SRF)] har-
bored substantial numbers of DP IELs (DP+),
whereas DP IELs were negligible or absent (DP–)
in mice from another vivarium [clinical sciences
research building (CSRB)] (Fig. 1A). Moreover,
DP IELs in SRF mice expressed low levels of
the transcription factor Thpok (Thpoklo), whereas
CSRB mice lacked CD4+ Thpoklo IELs (13), con-
sistent with the observed lack of DP IELs (fig. S1).
Thus, the microbiota in SRF mice may contain
taxa capable of inducing DP IELs. Consistent
with this, DP IELs appeared in CSRB mice after
gavage with fecal or ileal microbiota from SRF
but not CSRB animals (Fig. 1B).
Most SRF (DP+) mice are embryo-rederived
using female recipient mice from Charles River
(CR) Laboratories and thus acquire a CR micro-
biota. In contrast, most CSRB (DP–) mice origi-
nate from the Jackson Laboratories (JAX). Thus,
taxa present in CR but not JAX mice may in-
duce DP IELs. C57BL/6 mice purchased from CR
had a DP+ phenotype, whereas C57BL/6 mice
purchased from JAX had a DP– phenotype (Fig.
1C). DP+ and DP– phenotypes were vertically
transmissible (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the DP+ phe-
notype was laterally transferable from CR to
JAX mice by cohousing animals (Fig. 1E) or
by colonizing JAX mice with CR ileal or fecal
microbiota (Fig. 1F). Treatment of CR mice with
vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metro-
nidazole (VNAM) abrogated DP IELs (Fig. 1G),
as did ampicillin and vancomycin alone, which
target Gram-positive bacteria. Treatment with
neomycin, which targets Gram-negative bacte-
ria, led to a slight increase in DP IELs (Fig. 1H);
metronidazole did not affect DP IELs. Thus, DP
IELs are induced by neomycin-resistant Gram-
positive bacterial taxa.
To define bacterial taxa that induce DP IELs, we
sequenced polymerase chain reaction amplicons
from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes present
in the ileum of CR and JAX mice, as well as
neomycin-treated and untreated CR animals.
Six operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were se-
lectively present in the CR microbiota and were
also present or enriched after neomycin treatment
(fig. S2A). These OTUs included L. reuteri and
five members of the Bacteroidales S24-7 lineage
(Fig. 2A, fig. S2A, and table S1). L. reuteri was
present in the ileum of CR control mice and CR
mice treated with neomycin or metronidazole but
absent in CR mice treated with ampicillin plus
vancomycin (fig. S2B).
Two L. reuteri strains (WU and 100-23) in-
duced DP IELs after colonization of JAX mice
(Fig. 2B), whereas L. johnsonii, L. murinus (Fig.
2C), and various Bacteroides species (Fig. 2D) did
not. As expected, DP IELs were absent through-
out the small intestines of GF animals (11, 13)
(Fig. 2E). Concurrent inoculation of GF mice
with L. reuteri (WU strain) and ileal microbiota
from JAX mice induced DP IELs, whereas JAX
ileal microbiota alone was ineffective (Fig. 2F).
Monocolonization with L. reuteri resulted in
a slight increase of DP IELs. As expected, the
transfer of CR intestinal microbiota induced
DP IELs. Thus, L. reuteri induces DP IELs, but
the presence of other microbes enhances this
effect, perhaps by expanding the CD4+ T cells
in the lamina propria and epithelium.
We next examined how L. reuteri induces DP
IELs. If L. reuteri antigens shape the specificity
of DP IELs, these cells would express quasi-clonal
TCR ab repertoires, as shown for SFB-specific
TH17 cells (15). Analysis of TCR Vb expression on
DP IELs, CD4+ IELs, and mesenteric lymph node
(MLN) naïve CD4+ T cells showed that TCR Vb
usage of DP IELs resembled that of CD4+ IELs
but was different from that of naïve CD4+ T cells
(Fig. 3A). In each mouse analyzed, DP IELs
exhibited a preferential Vb usage (more than
twofold compared with MLN), although no en-
richment for a specific Vb pattern was shared by
all mice, suggesting mouse-to-mouse variability
in DP IEL TCRs (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S3A).
Because the great diversity of polyclonal T cells
complicates analysis at the individual TCR level,
we analyzed the TCR a repertoires of DP IELs,
CD4+ IELs, CD8+ IELs, and MLN naïve CD4+
T cells from mice that express a fixed transgenic
TCR ab chain (Tcli+ mice) (16, 17). Tcli+ T cells
were very similar in phenotype and frequency
to wild-type (WT) T cells (fig. S3B). TCR Renyi
diversity profiles showed both decreased diver-
sity (lower entropy at each order) and evidence
for increased clonal expansion (greater down-
ward slope) in the repertoires of all three IEL
subsets compared with the repertoire of naïve
CD4+ T cells (fig. S3C). The TCR a repertoires of
CD4+ IELs, CD8+ IELs, and DP IELs were distinct

Downloaded from 
 from those of naïve CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3C), con-
sistent with the expansion of T cell clones in
response to specific antigens. Moreover, the
TCR a repertoires of DP IELs and CD4+ IELs
were similar but distinct from those of CD8+
IELs (Fig. 3, D and E), corroborating that DP
IELs differentiate from CD4+ IELs. Although
the TCR a repertoires of naïve T cells were sim-
ilar in all mice analyzed, the TCR a repertoires
of DP IELs and CD4+ IELs were quite distinct
in each mouse (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the spec-
ificity of CD4+ IELs and DP IELs is shaped by
various environmental and/or self-antigens in
each mouse, rather than by a single antigen.
Some bacterial taxa shape T cell differentia-
tion via their physical components [e.g., poly-
saccharide A (7, 18)] or their metabolic products
[e.g., short-chain fatty acids (19–21)]. L. reuteri
releases reuterin (22) and histamine (23) and
also has the ability to metabolize tryptophan
(L-Trp) to indole derivatives, some of which ac-
tivate the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in
group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) (24, 25).
Accordingly, culture supernatants of L. reuteri
grown in L-Trp–containing medium activated an
AhR reporter cell line, whereas supernatants
of L. johnsonii or L. murinus did not (Fig. 4A).
To determine whether L. reuteri induces DP
IELs through the release of AhR ligands, we
added L. reuteri culture supernatants to naïve
ovalbumin-specific CD4+ T cells (OTII) stimu-
lated with ovalbumin peptide-pulsed dendritic
cells (DCs) with or without TGFb (12). L. reuteri
culture supernatant induced CD8aa+CD4+ T cell
differentiation of OTII T cells, as did the AhR
agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD)
(Fig. 4B and fig. S4A), but only in the presence of
TGFb. The AhR antagonist CH223191 inhibited
CD8aa+CD4+ T cell differentiation, confirming
that the L. reuteri supernatant acts through AhR.
AhR agonists in combination with TGFb were
as effective as TGFb plus retinoic acid and IFN-g
(12, 14) (Fig. 4B). We also generated a strain of
L. reuteri lacking a functional aromatic amino-
transferase and, hence, the ability to convert
amino acids into indolic AhR ligands (L. reuteri
DArAT) (24, 26). Culture supernatants from
L. reuteri DArAT failed to stimulate the AhR re-
porter cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, L. reuteri DArAT
did not induce DP IELs in JAX mice (Fig. 4D),
although this strain colonized mice efficiently
(fig. S4B).
We next assessed the impact of dietary L-Trp
levels in DP IEL development. More DP IELs
were observed in CR mice fed a diet high in L-Trp
(0.48%) compared with mice fed standard (0.24%)
or low (0.11%) L-Trp diets (Fig. 4E). However, a
high L-Trp diet failed to induce DP IELs in GF
mice monocolonized with either L. reuteri 100-23
or L. reuteri DArAT (fig. S4C). Thus, L. reuteri acts
together with a complex microbiota and dietary
L-Trp to induce DP IELs. Bioactivity-guided frac-
tionation of L. reuteri 100-23 supernatant iden-
tified the presence of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA),
an indole derivative of L-Trp, which activated the
AhR reporter cell line and induced CD8aa+CD4+
T cells (fig. S5). This compound was as effective
as indole-3-aldehyde, which activates AhR in
ILC3s (24) (Fig. 4F and fig. S4D). Ahr–/– mice
lacked DP IELs, whereas these cells were present
in Ahr+/– littermates and WT controls, supporting
our observation that L. reuteri induces DP IELs
through the release of AhR ligands (Fig. 4G). We
next asked whether AhR drives DP IEL differen-
tiation in a T cell–intrinsic or –extrinsic fashion.

 TGFb with either L. reuteri culture supernatant
or TCDD induced CD8aa+CD4+ T cells from
naïve WT CD4+ T cells stimulated in vitro with
Ahr–/– or WT splenic DCs pulsed with a combi-
nation of three superantigens. In contrast, Ahr–/–
T cells did not differentiate into CD8aa+CD4+
T cells, regardless of whether DCs lacked AhR,
implying that AhR is required in T cells (Fig. 4H).
Moreover, stimulation of OTII T cells with Ahr–/–
or WT DCs in the presence of TGFb and ei-
ther L. reuteri supernatant or TCDD induced
CD8aa+CD4+ T cells (fig. S4E). Finally, DP
IELs were significantly reduced in Ahr fl/fl ×
Rorc-Cre mice (which lack AhR in T cells and
ILCs), as well as in Ahr fl/fl × Cd4-Cre mice (which
lack AhR in T cells) in comparison with littermate
controls (Fig. 4I and fig. S4, F and G), demonstrat-
ing that DP IEL development requires AhR
activation in T cells. To determine when AhR
signaling intervenes in the DP IEL developmental
pathway, we analyzed the expression of Thpok
in IELs from Ahr+/– and Ahr–/– mice. Thpokhi
CD8aa–CD4+ IELs, Thpoklo CD8aa+CD4+ IELs
(DP IELs), and a small intermediate population
of Thpoklo CD8aa–CD4+ IELs were evident in
Ahr+/– mice, whereas a single Thpokhi CD4+ IEL
population predominated in Ahr–/– mice (Fig. 4J).
Thus, a lack of AhR signaling arrests DP IEL de-
velopment before Thpok down-regulation occurs.
Our study reveals that L. reuteri provides
indole derivatives of dietary L-Trp, such as ILA,
which activate AhR and lead to the down-
regulation of Thpok and reprogramming of

Fig. 4. L. reuteri induces DP IELs through AhR activation in T cells.
(A) Representative plots and quantification of green fluorescent protein–
positive (GFP+) cells in an AhR reporter cell line after stimulation with
medium (minimum essential medium +10% bovine calf serum),
peptone-tryptone water + L-Trp (PT-T), L. reuteri WU, L. reuteri (L.r.)
100-23, L. johnsonii (L.j.), or L. murinus (L.m.) supernatants (grown in
PT-T) or TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin). FSC, forward scatter.
(B) CD4+CD8b–CD8a+ T cell frequencies after culture of naïve OTII CD4+
T cells with spleen CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), OVA329-337 peptide, and
the indicated stimuli. T, TGFb; L.r., L. reuteri WU supernatant; CH,
CH223191; R, retinoic acid. (C) Quantification of GFP+ cells in an AhR
reporter cell line after stimulation with medium, PT-T, L. reuteri 100-23
supernatant, L. reuteri DArAT supernatant, or TCDD. (D) DP IEL
frequencies in JAX C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks after colonization with either
L. reuteri 100-23 or L. reuteri DArAT, or in mice that were not colonized (ctrl).
(E) DP IEL frequencies in CR C57BL/6 mice fed for 4 weeks with diets low
(0.11%), standard (0.24%), or high (0.48%) in L-Trp. (F) CD4+CD8aa+
T cell frequencies after culture of naïve OTII CD4+ T cells with spleen CD11c+
DCs, OVA329-337 peptide, and the indicated stimuli. IAId, indole-3-aldehyde;
ILA, indole-3-lactic acid. (G) DP IEL frequencies in cohoused WT, Ahr+/–, and
Ahr–/– littermate mice. (H) CD4+CD8aa+ T cell frequencies after culture of
WTor Ahr–/– CD4+ Tcells with WTor Ahr–/– DCs; a combination of SEB, SEE,
and TSST1 superantigens; and the indicated stimuli. (I) DP IEL frequencies in
Rorc-Cre+ × Ahrfl/fl and Rorc-Cre– × Ahrfl/fl littermates. (J) Representative
flow cytometry plots showing DP IELs and CD4+ IELs (left) and Thpok
expression (right) in CD4+ IELs (blue) and DP IELs (green) in Ahr+/– and
Ahr–/– littermates. Symbols represent single animals; data have been
pooled from two or three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was
performed using a Mann-Whitney U test (I), a Kruskal-Wallis test [(D), (E), and
(G)], and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with T
ukey’s post hoc test
[(A), (B), (C), (F), and (H)]. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P <

Downloaded from 
 CD4+ IELs into DP IELs. Other indole derivatives
may have a similar effect. This Ahr-mediated
mechanism is distinct from those by which AhR
affects other T cells with regulatory functions
(Tr1, Tregs), intraepithelial gd T cells, and DCs
(27–32). Yet undefined microbial species and
dietary and/or self-antigens are necessary to
expand the CD4+ IEL population with a diverse
TCR repertoire that converts into DP IELs. The
complete reliance of DP IELs on a single species
(L. reuteri) and its tryptophan metabolites for
their final maturation may provide a basis for the
use of L. reuteri as a probiotic and tryptophan-
rich food to treat disorders that may be modifi-
able by DP IELs, such as inflammatory bowel
diseases (11).
