Study Objectives: Nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux (nGER) is common among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Previous studies 
demonstrated that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces symptoms of nGER. However, improvement in nGER symptoms based on objective 
CPAP compliance has not been documented. We have examined the polysomnographic characteristics of patients with nGER and OSA and looked for 
association of OSA severity and CPAP compliance with improvement in nGER symptoms.
Methods: We interviewed 85 veterans with OSA to assess their daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness scale [ESS]) and nGER symptom frequency 
after their polysomnography and polysomnographic data were reviewed. At 6 months’ follow-up, ESS score, nGER score, and CPAP machine compliance 
data were reassessed. Data from 6 subjects were dropped from final analysis due to their initiation of new medication for nGER symptom since 
the initial evaluation.
Results: Sixty-two of 79 (78%) patients complained of nGER symptoms during initial visit. At baseline, nGER score was correlated with sleep efficiency 
(r = 0.43), and BMI correlated with the severity of OSA (r = 0.41). ESS and nGER improved (p < 0.0001) in all patients after 6 months, but more significantly in 
CPAP compliant patients. A minimum CPAP compliance of 25% was needed to achieve any benefit in nGER improvement.
Conclusions: Nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux is common among patients with OSA which increases sleep disruption and worsens the symptoms of 
daytime sleepiness. CPAP therapy may help improve the symptoms of both nocturnal acid reflux and daytime sleepiness, but adherence to CPAP is crucial to 
achieve this benefit.

INTRODUCTION
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repeated 
collapse of the upper airway, leading to complete (apnea) 
or partial cessation (hypopnea) of breathing during sleep. 
Approximately 4% of men and 2% of women suffer from 
this condition in USA.1 Nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux 
(nGER) is also a common condition. In a population based 
survey, about 79% of general population have reported to suf-
fer from it, and 63% of them felt that their sleep is disturbed 
due to their reflux symptom.2 nGER is also diagnosed fre-
quently among patients with OSA.3,4 It has been postulated 
that OSA may predispose to nGER by lowering intrathoracic 
pressure and causing leakage of lower esophageal sphinc-
ter.5 A few studies have reported that continuous positive 
airway pressure therapy (CPAP) reduces the frequency and 
duration of nGER during sleep.6,7 Self-reported CPAP com-
pliance has been reported to be a strong predictor of nGER 
improvement, but objective measurement would be crucial 
to examine its effect on nGER symptoms. Polysomnographic 
characteristics of these patients have not been studied in the 
past. In our study, we compared the polysomnographic char-
acteristics of OSA patients with and without nGER. We in-
vestigated the effects of OSA severity, rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep, and supine position on nGER symptoms. We

also examined the effect of CPAP therapy and CPAP compli-

METHODS
We prospectively evaluated 101 patients who had been diag-
nosed with OSA by nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) in the 
G.V (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center, Jackson, Mis-
sissippi, between May 2011 and December 2014. The research 
proposal has been reviewed and approved by the IRB of the 
same institution. The patients were approached for the study

BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Nocturnal gastroesophageal 
reflux (nGER) frequently coexists in patients with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA). Previous studies reported some improvement in nGER 
symptoms with CPAP therapy but no objective measurement of 
CPAP compliance was documented.
Study Impact: Our study revealed that CPAP therapy with adequate 
compliance (as documented by the downloaded machine data) helps 
improve the symptoms of both nocturnal acid reflux and daytime 
sleepiness. Clinicians should encourage all patients with OSA and 
nGER to maintain a good CPAP compliance to achieve this benefit.

study result and receive the CPAP equipment after their noc-
turnal PSG. The patients who were already on a proton pump 
inhibitors (PPI) or an H2 blocker were excluded from the study. 
After exclusion, 85 patients were enrolled in the study, and 
their written informed consents were obtained. OSA was di-
agnosed if a patient had an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 
events/h, or AHI ≥ 5 but < 15 events/h with any of the follow-
ing: excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood 
disorder, insomnia, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or 
history of stroke. All of these patients were prescribed CPAP 
therapy for treatment of their OSA. Polysomnography reports 
of these patients were reviewed and information about the fol-
lowing variables were collected: total AHI, supine and non-su-
pine AHI, REM sleep and NREM sleep AHI, sleep efficiency 
(SE), and total sleep time (TST).
During the initial visit, patients were asked to fill out a ques-
tionnaire to assess their heartburn, which is widely used to as-
sess nGER in population based research.8–10 They were asked 
if they had a specific set of symptoms suggestive of nGER and 
at what frequency. The instruction in the questionnaire asked 
the respondent to “consider the question as applying to the pre-
vious 6 months of their life.” The question stated, “My sleep 
is disturbed by severe heartburn and choking (regurgitation/
bringing up bitter stomach fluid).” The answer to this ques-
tion was recorded by asking the respondent to agree to the 
statement by circling a number from 1 to 5, with the following 
keys: “1 = never; 2 = rarely; 3 = sometimes; 4 = usually; and 
5 = always.” These symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgita-
tion are considered to be specific for gastroesophageal reflux 
(GERD). Patients with initial response ≥ 2 were considered to 
have nGER. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) question-
naire, which is widely used in the literature for assessing day-
time sleepiness, was also given to the patients on the same visit. 
Demographic data including age, gender, BMI, and race were 
also obtained.
All patients were re-evaluated in the sleep clinic during fol-
low-up visits after 6 months of initial enrollment. Six patients 
reported to have started on either a PPI or an H2 blocker since 
their initial evaluation for their worsening heartburn symptoms 
and they were excluded from the study, reducing our total sam-
ple size to 79. Data from the CPAP machines were downloaded 
by the sleep technicians for accurate compliance documenta-
tion. We have used standard Medicare criteria to define CPAP 
compliance. The patients who demonstrated CPAP use ≥ 4 h/
night for ≥ 70% of the nights were considered compliant. The 
nGER questionnaire and ESS questionnaire were given again 
to everyone to assess the change in nGER symptoms and day-
time sleepiness. The study design has been described in the 
flow diagram in Figure 1. Data were analyzed with statistical 
analysis system (Stata 14.1). Chi-square was used for categori-
cal variables and t-test for continuous variables. Regression 
analysis was performed to show effect of different variables 
on outcome data. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULTS
Sixty-two of 79 patients (78%) with OSA had symptoms of 
nGER at baseline. Patients with OSA with and without nGER 
were fairly similar in demographic and polysomnographic 
characteristics, which are summarized in Table 1. There was 
no significant difference in mean age, AHI, BMI, total sleep 
time (TST), or sleep efficiency (SE) between CPAP compliant 
and noncompliant groups. BMI had a positive correlation with 
total AHI (r = 0.41), which means that the degree of obesity

S Tamanna, D Campbell, R Warren et al. Effect of CPAP on Symptoms of GERD among Patients with Sleep Apnea
was associated with the severity of OSA (Figure 2). The BMI 
was much lower (mean = 28.98 kg/m2, n = 24) in patients with 
mild OSA (AHI < 15, p < 0.001) than those with moderate to 
severe OSA (mean = 34.17 kg/m2, n = 55). In multiple linear re-
gression, sleep effi
 ciency (R2 = 0.14, p = 0.001) was found to be 
negatively associated with nGER severity, after adjusting for 
total AHI, supine AHI, age, and BMI (Figure 3). The daytime 
sleepiness (ESS) was higher (p = 0.04) in patients with nGER 
(13.06) than those without nGER (10.1) before CPAP therapy.
Even though supine position generally worsens the noctur-
nal refl
 ux symptoms,11 supine AHI (p = 0.81) in our study was 
not statistically signifi
 cant in predicting severity of nGER. On 
the other hand, we found an interesting observation about the 
relationship of OSA severity (total AHI) in predicting baseline 
nGER in simple linear regression model. When we used the 
total AHI of all subjects (n = 79) to predict nGER, it failed 
to show any statistically signifi
 cant relationship (R2 = 0.002, 
p = 0.186). But when we analyzed the data in 2 separate groups 
(mild OSA with AHI < 15, and moderate-severe OSA with 
AHI ≥ 15), the fi
 ndings were slightly different. It revealed a 
weak, yet statistically signifi
 cant positive linear association 
between AHI and nGER score among patients who had mod-
erate-severe OSA (R2 = 0.11, p = 0.011).
Among the patients with nGER, 49% (n = 39) were compli-
ant with the use of CPAP for ≥ 4 h/night for ≥ 70% of the nights. 
Characteristics of patients by compliance of CPAP have been 
summarized in Table 2. There was no difference in mean age, 
BMI, CPAP pressure requirement, total AHI, supine AHI, or 
REM AHI between compliant and noncompliant groups ex-
cept for mean ESS score and nGER which were higher in the 
noncompliant group (p < 0.01). Both of these scores decreased 
after CPAP therapy in both groups, but these improvements 
were much more prominent in the CPAP compliant group 
(Figures 4 and 5). The mean ESS decreased by 43% (from 
12.05 to 6.95, p = 0.0001) in the CPAP compliant group, and by 
23% (from 12.75 to 9.85, p = 0.001) in the noncompliant group. 
The mean heartburn score decreased by 62% (from 3.69 to 1.38, 
p = 0.0001) in the CPAP compliant group, and by 29% (from 
3.75 to 2.65, p = 0.01) in the noncompliant group.
CPAP compliance was also the only signifi
 cant predictor 
for nGER score reduction in the multiple regression analysis

S Tamanna, D Campbell, R Warren et al. Effect of CPAP on Symptoms of GERD among Patients with Sleep Apnea
(p = 0.001). There was a progressive reduction in nGER score 
with increase in CPAP compliance (Figure 4). We stratifi
 ed 
the CPAP compliance at 4 quartiles (Q1 = compliance ≤ 25%, 
Q2 = compliance 26% to 50%, Q3 = compliance 51% to 75% 
and Q4 = compliance > 75%) to see the effect of different lev-
els CPAP compliance on nGER improvement. Patients who 
had ≤ 25% of CPAP compliance (Q1) did not show any sig-
nifi
 cant improvement in their nGER score (Figure 6) despite 
CPAP treatment (p = 0.07).
DISCUSSION
Our study confi
 rms that CPAP therapy improves the symp-
toms of nocturnal esophageal refl
 ux in patients with coexisting 
OSA. This is consistent with previous studies that reported that 
symptoms of nGER improves with CPAP therapy regardless of 
the presence or absence of OSA.7,10,12,13 Respiratory disturbance 
and thoraco-abdominal paradoxical movements during sleep 
in OSA cause arousals and stimulate swallowing, which leads 
to vagally mediated esophageal peristalsis and refl
 ex opening 
of the LES.5,6 The CPAP therapy prevents apnea/hypopnea by 
creating a continuous fl
 ow of air which acts like a pneumatic 
stent to keep the pharyngeal airway patent preventing recur-
rent arousals and swallowing refl
 exes.
Our study is possibly the fi
 rst assessing the effect of objec-
tive CPAP compliance on nocturnal gastroesophageal refl
 ux 
symptoms. Previous studies showing improvement of nGER 
by CPAP therapy were primarily based on subjective reports of 
patients on their nightly use of CPAP. This self-reported com-
pliance of CPAP use is not a reliable tool compared to mea-
sured compliance from CPAP device, as majority of patients 
often overestimate their CPAP use.14,15 This study shows that 
improvement of nGER score from better CPAP compliance is 
not linear. While higher CPAP compliance leads to better im-
provement in nGER score, low CPAP compliance (< 25%) does 
not result in any improvement (Figure 5)
There was no statistically signifi
 cant association between 
OSA severity (total AHI) and baseline nGER score when all 
patients were analyzed together. This is consistent with fi
 nd-
ings of multiple studies in the past which showed lack of as-
sociation between overall AHI and nGER severity.16–18 The 
most recent study by Shepherd and Orr reported such fi
 nding 
by documenting the nGER by esophageal pH monitoring dur-
ing polysomnography and suggested that obesity rather than 
AHI may have a greater role in the relationship between OSA 
and nGER.17 This prompted us to perform further subgroup 
analyses, which revealed that the BMI of our patients with 
moderate-severe OSA (mean = 34.17 kg/m2) was much higher 
than those with mild OSA (mean = 28.98 kg/m2). The total 
AHI revealed a linear positive association with nGER score 
among patients with moderate to severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15), but 
not among those with mild OSA (AHI < 15). This observation 
is similar to the fi
 ndings by Rodrigues et al., who reported that 
obese patients with moderate to severe OSA had more severe 
nGER symptoms than non-obese patients.19 Obesity is a com-
mon risk factor for both OSA and nGER and BMI has been 
found to be positively associated with postprandial transient 
lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.20 But there are other 
numerous risk factors that contribute to these two conditions.

In fact, Ing et al. reported that less than half of all apneas were 
temporally related to acid reflux, and only 43.8% of arousals 
were related to nGER events in their study.12 Therefore, AHI 
may have not correlated with nGER in patients with lower BMI 
in our study because of the complex interactions of other vari-
ables. Future studies may be done to look at the association of 
AHI and nGER by varying degrees of OSA and BMI to further 
verify our observation.
CONCLUSIONS
Nocturnal gastroesophageal acid reflux is common among pa-
tients with OSA which increases sleep disruption and wors-
ens the symptoms of daytime sleepiness. CPAP therapy may 
help improve the symptoms of both nocturnal acid reflux and 
daytime sleepiness. Adherence to CPAP is crucial to achieve 
this benefit. The patients with nGER may benefit from being 
screened for symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea as treating 
this condition will also help control nGER symptoms.
