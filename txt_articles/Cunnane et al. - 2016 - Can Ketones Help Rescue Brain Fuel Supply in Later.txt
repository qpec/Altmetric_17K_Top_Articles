We propose that brain energy deficit is an important pre-symptomatic feature of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that requires closer attention in the development of AD
therapeutics. Our rationale is fourfold: (i) Glucose uptake is lower in the frontal cortex
of people >65 years-old despite cognitive scores that are normal for age. (ii) The
regional deficit in brain glucose uptake is present in adults <40 years-old who have
genetic or lifestyle risk factors for AD but in whom cognitive decline has not yet started.
Examples include young adult carriers of presenilin-1 or apolipoprotein E4, and young
adults with mild insulin resistance or with a maternal family history of AD. (iii) Regional
brain glucose uptake is impaired in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but brain
uptake of ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), remains the same in AD
and MCI as in cognitively healthy age-matched controls. These observations point to
a brain fuel deficit which appears to be specific to glucose, precedes cognitive decline
associated with AD, and becomes more severe as MCI progresses toward AD. Since
glucose is the brain’s main fuel, we suggest that gradual brain glucose exhaustion is
contributing significantly to the onset or progression of AD. (iv) Interventions that raise
ketone availability to the brain improve cognitive outcomes in both MCI and AD as well
as in acute experimental hypoglycemia. Ketones are the brain’s main alternative fuel to
glucose and brain ketone uptake is still normal in MCI and in early AD, which would help
explain why ketogenic interventions improve some cognitive outcomes in MCI and AD.
We suggest that the brain energy deficit needs to be overcome in order to successfully
develop more effective therapeutics for AD. At present, oral ketogenic supplements are
the most promising means of achieving this goal.

Brain Energy and Alzheimer’s Disease
INTRODUCTION
Compensating for deteriorating brain energy metabolism is the
core feature of an emerging strategy aimed at delaying the onset
and/or progression of AD. Relative to its size, the adult human
brain requires a disproportionately large amount of energy that
is provided principally by glucose. In those at risk of AD
including cognitively healthy older people, regional brain glucose
hypometabolism can be present long before the clinical diagnosis
of AD. The brain’
s alternative energy supply to glucose is unique
compared to other organs in that it specifically requires ketones
(also known as ketone bodies) to compensate for occasions when
glucose supply to the brain is inadequate. In contrast to glucose,
brain uptake of ketones appears to still be normal in AD. Hence,
ketogenic interventions may help delay AD.
An AD treatment strategy focused on preventing brain energy
starvation during aging is based on research that started at least
40 years ago. For instance, the unique dependence of the brain on
ketones to replace low glucose supply has been known since the
1960s (Cahill, 2006). It has been proposed since the early 1980s
that failing brain glucose supply to or metabolism by the brain
could be contributing to AD risk or progression (Hoyer et al.,
1988; Veech et al., 2001; Cunnane et al., 2011, 2016). Concrete
clinical efforts to develop a ‘
keto-neurotherapeutic’strategy to
bypass the problem with brain glucose metabolism in AD were
first reported a decade ago (Reger et al., 2004; Henderson,
2008; Krikorian et al., 2012; Newport et al., 2015). Despite these
pioneering studies, this approach to combat AD is still very much
a novel area of research.
We see the challenge facing brain energy metabolism during
aging through the lens of the similar challenge of assuring
sufficient energy supply to the rapidly growing brain of the infant.
At no time in our life cycle is the challenge of supplying the
brain with sufficient energy more acute than in early human brain
development. Indeed, the human species must have confronted
this energy constraint for normal brain development when the
brain started to triple in size more than 2 million years ago
(Cunnane and Crawford, 2014). We suggest that the energetic
(glucose) deficit confronted by the aging brain today is essentially
the same as the challenge faced during brain expansion at the
dawn of our species and that ketones were part of the solution
then as now. Hence, it makes physiological sense to apply
what we know about the importance of ketones in early brain
development to the challenge of maintaining brain energy supply
and brain function during aging.
This review will therefore focus on providing the rationale
for proposing that deteriorating brain energy metabolism is
a constraint for healthy cognitive aging that will have to be
overcome in order to successfully limit the impact of AD no
matter what therapeutic strategy is used (neurotransmitter-based,
anti-amyloid, exercise, etc.). We will describe here our brain
ketone PET studies in aging and AD with the ketone tracer, 11C-
acetoacetate, because this tracer provides a valuable window on
brain energy metabolism to compare with glucose. As we and
others have previously proposed, the pre-symptomatic presence
of brain glucose hypometabolism in people at risk of AD has clear
implications for potential therapeutic strategies (Gibson et al.,
2000; Veech et al., 2001; Blass, 2008; Henderson et al., 2009;
Cunnane et al., 2011, 2016). We will also refer to a number of
issues that will need to be addressed as this field matures.
DETERIORATING BRAIN GLUCOSE
SUPPLY IN THOSE AT RISK OF AD
The concept that ketones could be of therapeutic value during
brain aging hinges on demonstrating that there is a pre-
symptomatic problem with brain glucose metabolism in people
at risk of AD but who are still cognitively normal. Older people
are a key focus of this work because they are at the highest
risk of AD but this concept applies to any genetic, lifestyle, or
demographic risk factor for AD. PET imaging with the glucose
tracer, FDG, and oxygen tracer, 15O-oxygen, was first used to
image brain energy metabolism in the late 1970s with reports
on AD first appearing in the early 1980s (Benson et al., 1983).
Since then, PET-FDG has been a cornerstone of human and
animal studies on brain energy metabolism in aging and AD
(Cunnane et al., 2011). Indeed, without PET-FDG, it is doubtful
that brain glucose hypometabolism in AD would have become so
widely studied because the only option besides PET, the arterio-
venous difference method, is highly invasive and is used less and
less in research today. Nevertheless, the arterio-venous difference
method was the first to be used to assess brain oxygen and glucose
uptake during aging (Dastur, 1985) and the first to show that
specifically brain glucose uptake and not brain ketone uptake
was significantly impaired in AD (Lying-Tunell et al., 1981;
Table 1 and Figure 1). The arterio-venous difference method
also produced several ground-breaking reports comparing brain
ketone and glucose uptake. These studies laid the foundation
for our current understanding that ketones are an essential
physiological brain fuel working in tandem with glucose to assure
that brain energy requirements are being met on a daily basis,
not just in infants or during starvation (Cunnane et al., 2016).
The advantage of the arterio-venous difference method is that it
permits quantification of global brain energy metabolism. Aside
from its invasiveness, its disadvantage is that it provides no
information about brain regions that are most or least affected
in AD.
Decades of research with PET-FDG have made it abundantly
clear that regional brain glucose uptake is defective in AD
(Cunnane et al., 2011, 2016). This AD-type pattern is particularly
evident in the parietal, posterior cingulate and temporal cortex
and much less present in the occipital cortex and cerebellum.
Indeed, the parieto-temporal pattern is relatively specific to AD
itself and distinct from the pattern in other forms of dementia
and from normal aging itself. This regional pattern of brain
glucose hypometabolism in AD has generally been interpreted as
a consequence of neuronal failure and death because, logically,
brain regions with dysfunctional or dead brain cells need less fuel.
However, this interpretation is insufficient because it does not
take into account multiple examples of conditions in which the
risk of AD is elevated and in which the regional brain glucose
hypometabolism is present before the clinical (cognitive) onset
of the disease. Examples of conditions in which regional brain

carriers of the Pre-senilin-1 mutation, carriers of apolipoprotein
E4, maternal family history of AD, cognitively healthy aging, and
insulin resistance in both young and older persons (Table 2).
Since regional brain glucose hypometabolism is present before
measurable cognitive deficit in these conditions, it is clearly
pre-symptomatic and therefore cannot only be a consequence of
neuronal loss caused by AD. As such, it is plausible that brain
glucose hypometabolism could increase the risk of developing
AD. This argument has previously been made in detail (Cunnane

et al., 2011, 2016) so we will focus here on two examples that
collectively represent the populations at highest overall risk for
AD –older people and those with insulin resistance (Ronnemaa
et al., 2008; Craft, 2009, 2012; Matsuzaki et al., 2010; Schrijvers
et al., 2010; Baker et al., 2011).
DETERIORATING BRAIN GLUCOSE
UPTAKE DURING AGING
The risk of AD increases with advancing age but it has not
been clear until recently whether healthy aging per se, i.e.,
cognitively normal and relatively free of overt risk factors for
AD, is associated with deteriorating brain glucose uptake. This
uncertainty has been due to a lack of a standard definition of
healthy aging, a lack of sufficient verification in several reports as
to whether or not cognition was normal in the older group, as well
as infrequent quantification of brain glucose uptake to determine
the actual magnitude of the problem (Nugent et al., 2014a).
Knowing that there is a statistical difference in brain glucose
across brain regions or between two groups is not sufficient; being
able to assess the magnitude of the problem is essential in order
to set a therapeutic target to counteract the problem.
We have therefore developed a database on brain ketone and
glucose uptake in cohorts of cognitively normal young and older
people. The older group had a minimum age of 65 years and
was relatively free of overt disease. A detailed neuropsychological
assessment showed that they were cognitively normal and had a
metabolic profile as closely matched to healthy young adults as
possible (Tables 3 and 4). Brain glucose uptake was quantified
as CMRg with the units, µmol/100 g/min, both globally and
regionally in each participant. This cognitively healthy older
cohort had 9% lower global brain glucose uptake compared
to our younger controls, a deficit that was mostly though not
exclusively limited to the frontal cortex (−14%) and the caudate
(−18%; Nugent et al., 2014a, 2016; Figure 2). This pattern is
regionally different from the situation in AD where glucose
hypometabolism is not only in the frontal cortex but includes
glucose uptake that was as much as 33% lower in parts of the

26% lower in the posterior cingulate cortex (Castellano et al.,

therefore commonly present in cognitively healthy older persons
despite the absence of any clinical sign of AD.
DETERIORATING BRAIN GLUCOSE
UPTAKE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE
The metabolic profile of the older cohort described above
was moderately well matched to the younger group but
some parameters did differ significantly, i.e., body-mass index,
blood pressure, homocysteine, and some measures of glucose
homeostasis were not identical and could have adversely
influenced brain glucose metabolism (Nugent et al., 2016;
Table 3). However, it is difficult to find older people in whom
the metabolic profile is strictly within the same limits as adults
<35 years-old. Mild insulin resistance seems to be a common
feature of aging, but it is by no means limited to the older
population. The importance of this point became clear to us
when we studied young women with mild insulin resistance
due to PCOS. They had a brain glucose uptake deficit in the
superior and middle frontal cortex of about 14%, i.e., a profile
resembling that of people in their 70 and 80s (Castellano et al.,
2015a). PCOS is a multi-factorial endocrine disease involving
not only mild-moderate insulin resistance but also infertility and
hyperandrogenism. The mild insulin resistance was of particular
interest to us because it is associated with increased risk of AD

in middle-aged and older adults (Ronnemaa et al., 2008; Craft,
2009, 2012; Matsuzaki et al., 2010; Schrijvers et al., 2010; Baker
et al., 2011).
In our women with PCOS, glucose uptake in several brain
regions was significantly inversely correlated to both the mild
insulin resistance and to fasting plasma glucose. Recent studies
in young women with PCOS demonstrate that insulin resistance
is associated not only with impaired brain glucose metabolism
but also with altered white matter microstructure and cognitive
performance (especially working memory) in young adults
(Castellano et al., 2015a; Rees et al., 2016). These results suggest
that glucose dysregulation and the development of a pattern
of deteriorating brain glucose in older people can start in the
second to third decade of life (Burns et al., 2013; Ishibashi et al.,
2015). Whether women with PCOS are predisposed to a higher
risk of cognitive decline as they age and whether this apparently
increased risk of cognitive decline can be prevented or reversed
requires further attention.
Thus, regional brain glucose hypometabolism can be present
in those at risk of AD due to old age, or to insulin resistance
regardless of age. Multiple mechanisms are undoubtedly involved
in the mechanism by which insulin resistance affects the
onset and/or progression of AD (Schioth et al., 2012). This
pre-symptomatic glucose uptake deficit is commonly but not
exclusively in the frontal cortex and its magnitude is of the
order of 12–
15% (Cunnane et al., 2011; Castellano et al., 2015b;
Nugent et al., 2016). We interpret these findings to mean that
a vicious cycle can develop in which chronic pre-symptomatic
brain glucose hypometabolism develops and then contributes
to deteriorating neuronal function, further decline in demand
for glucose, and the emergence of cognitive decline which then
further decreases brain glucose consumption (Figure 3; Cunnane
et al., 2011, 2016). Chronic sedentarity commonly contributes to
chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance which not only
compromise tissue glucose uptake but also decreased ketogenesis
and ketone metabolism (Fukao et al., 2004; Bickerton et al., 2008).
In effect, this puts the aging brain at risk of exhaustion because
now it is not only getting insufficient glucose but is also less
ketones (Cunnane et al., 2011, 2016; Mamelak, 2012).

FIGURE 3 | Latent brain glucose hypometabolism leading to a vicious
cycle of accelerating metabolic deterioration, neuroinflammation and
neuronal dysfunction that increases the risk of developing AD
(Cunnane et al., 2016). Lower brain glucose uptake is a direct reflection of
lower glycolysis in brain cells. Lower glycolysis contributes to impaired brain
function (ATP generation and neurotransmitter production) which in turn
contributes to cognitive symptoms. Deteriorating cognitive function then
reduces demand for glucose turning this sequence into a vicious cycle.
whole body. Like other organs, the brain has a back-up fuel for
occasions when glucose supply is insufficient, i.e., during fasting,
starvation, strenuous exercise, or malnutrition. Ketones are the
only significant alternative fuel to glucose for the brain, which
is a unique situation because as far as is known all other organs
use free fatty acids to replace insufficient availability of glucose
(Cunnane et al., 2011). β-HBA and AcAc are the two ketones
that replace glucose for the brain. The third ketone, acetone, is
a decarboxylation product of AcAc that is mainly excreted on
breath but can also potentially enter intermediary metabolism.
The focus here will be on β-HBA and AcAc; neither acetone nor
the less common five carbon ketones derived from odd-chain
fatty acids will be discussed further.
Unlike in the human adult in whom the brain appears to use
ketones only to compensate for periodic insufficiency in glucose
supply, in the developing infant, ketones are essential both as a
major fuel and also as the main substrate for brain lipid synthesis
(Cunnane et al., 2003, 2016). Ketones are an essential fuel for
the human neonatal brain because there is insufficient glucose
available to meet its brain energy requirements (Settergren et al.,
1976; Robinson and Williamson, 1980; Bougneres et al., 1986).
This important role of ketones in infant brain development and
energy metabolism starts to develop in the fetus (Adam et al.,
1975). Postnatally, the brain’
s dependence on ketones is made
possible because infants are normally in a sustained state of mild
ketosis (0.2–
0.5 mM β-HBA). This neonatal ketosis is present
regardless of whether the infant has just been fed or is in a post-
prandial state, i.e., the ketosis is not a function of food restriction
or hypoglycemia (Settergren et al., 1976). This contrasts with the
adult human in whom 0.5 mM β-HBA in plasma is normally only
achieved after 24–
48 h fasting accompanied by hypoglycemia and
hypoinsulinemia.
The constant state of ketosis in infants is due mostly to MCFAs
supplied in breast milk; indeed, the milk of most (probably
all) mammalian species contains 10–
20% of all fatty acids as
MCFA (Hilditch and Meara, 1944; Insull and Ahrens, 1959;
Breckenridge and Kuksis, 1967). Some of the MCFA in breast
milk end up in the adipose stores of the infant and can be used
days or weeks later, thereby in effect extending lactation for some
period of time with respect to the availability of ready-made
ketone substrates (Sarda et al., 1987). However, unlike in humans,
the offspring of other terrestrial mammals have virtually no
adipose tissue so they have very limited ability to store MCFA and,
hence, poor ability to generate ketones post-weaning (Robinson
and Williamson, 1980). Human babies on the other hand have
significant subcutaneous fat stores, i.e., 500–
600 g if they are
born at term, but markedly less if they are born pre-term. After
lactation ends, the long chain fatty acids and the small amount of
MCFA stored in adipose tissue provide the substrate to prolong
mild ketonemia for many months. Incidentally, in addition to
the liver, the infant gut can also synthesize ketones (Bekesi and
Williamson, 1990).
KETONES: THE BRAIN’S PREFERRED
FUEL
That ketones are the main reserve fuel for the adult human
brain when glucose supply is compromised by starvation was
convincingly demonstrated in the now classic studies of medically
supervised long-term starvation reported by Owen et al. (1967)
and Drenick et al. (1972). The brain’
s need for energy during
prolonged starvation can be met by the high ketogenic capacity
of the liver which can produce up to 150 g ketones/day (Flatt,
1972; Reichard et al., 1974). Despite the liver’
s high energy
consumption, it cannot catabolize ketones, so they diffuse into the
circulation where they become available to all organs. However, as
starvation progresses, other organs, particularly skeletal muscle,
come to use free fatty acids more efficiently so ketones therefore
become increasingly available for the brain which has no other
energy substrate to replace low glucose (Owen and Reichard,
1971; Drenick et al., 1972).
In adults, long chain fatty acids stored in adipose tissue are
the main substrate for ketogenesis. They are released as free fatty
acids when low blood glucose in turn causes hypoinsulinemia
(Mitchell et al., 1995). Free fatty acids entering the liver are beta-
oxidized, generating acetyl-CoA. As hypoinsulinemia continues,
free fatty acid delivery to the liver continues and acetyl-CoA
starts to accumulate because its concentration exceeds the
capacity of the citric acid cycle to metabolize it. Acetyl-CoA
accumulation in the liver leads to condensation of two acetyl-
CoAs to ketones via hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl CoA. During
short-term fasting, ketone metabolism generally matches ketone
synthesis so plasma ketones usually do not rise much above
≤0.3 mM (Hall et al., 1984; Balasse and Fery, 1989; Avogaro et al.,

1990; Table 5). Greatly increased ketogenesis relative to ketone
clearance after 3–
5 days fasting causes plasma ketones to rise
about 10-fold. In the presence of hypoglycemia, the liver depends
on gluconeogenesis to support the energy costs of ketogenesis
(Flatt, 1972; Garber et al., 1974).
Ketone transport into tissues including the brain occurs via
monocarboxylic acid transporters of which there are several sub-
types (Simpson et al., 2007). Monocarboxylic acid transporter
expression in the brain responds rapidly to hyperketonemia
(Halestrap and Price, 1999; Pan et al., 2001). Thus, brain uptake
of ketones is normally directly proportional to their plasma
concentration over at least the range of 0.02–
12 mM (Cunnane
et al., 2011, 2016; Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2013). In contrast
to ketones which are ‘
pushed’into the brain in proportion to
their plasma concentration, glucose is ‘
pulled’
into the brain in
proportion to its utilization by astrocytes and neurons (Figure 4).
The ‘
push-pull’
strategy assures that ketones will enter the brain
under conditions in which glucose availability is decreased and
ketone synthesis is stimulated.
Both short-term PET and arterio-venous difference studies in
humans show that brain glucose consumption decreases as ketone
availability to the brain increases (Hasselbalch et al., 1995). These
results suggest that ketones are actually the preferred energy
substrate for the brain because they enter the brain in proportion
to their plasma concentration irrespective of glucose availability;
if the energy needs of the brain are being increasingly met by
ketones, glucose uptake decreases accordingly. This decrease in
brain glucose uptake when both ketones and glucose are available
supports the notion that ketones are the brain’
s preferred fuel.
Nevertheless, it is uncommon for both ketones and glucose to
be available; normally, when one is increased in the blood the
other is decreased. Under conditions of normal energy sufficiency
and three meals per day, ketogenesis is supressed and glucose
supplies >95% of the brain’
s energy requirements; hence, glucose
(or fuels derived from glucose, i.e., lactate or pyruvate) is the
brain’
s dominant but not actually its preferred fuel.
The problem for the aging brain is that low glucose
supply in the blood is not the same as low brain glucose
utilization. When blood glucose decreases, ketogenesis normally
occurs rapidly in response to decreased insulin. However, when
brain glucose utilization is decreased, plasma insulin does not
necessarily decrease; indeed, during aging, plasma insulin and
glucose are commonly mildly elevated and there is a state
of mild-moderate insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia inhibits
the normal ketogenic response (Bickerton et al., 2008), thereby
putting the aging brain in double jeopardy of being deprived
of both its primary fuels. We believe that this problem is at
the root of the vicious cycle between deteriorating brain fuel
uptake/availability and deteriorating brain function that leads
to AD.
KETOSIS, MCT, AND BRAIN FUNCTION
In discussing keto-neurotherapeutics, it is essential to distinguish
between nutritional or dietary ketosis and pathological ketosis;
they differ in origin, in severity of ketosis and in medical
consequences. Nutritional ketosis is a physiological response
to sustained low carbohydrate intake resulting in low plasma
glucose and insulin, and plasma ketones of 2–
5 mM after a
week or so. Nutritional ketosis has never been shown to induce
ketoacidosis, i.e., to alter acid-base balance or to lower blood pH
whether after experimental ketone infusion (Hasselbalch et al.,
1995) or during medically supervised starvation lasting as long as
60 days (Drenick et al., 1972). Nutritional ketosis can be sustained
for weeks, months, or even years; indeed, there are numerous
metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of nutritional ketosis in
addition to the clinical benefits that are well-documented for
intractable epilepsy. Experimental ketone infusion shows that
nutritional ketosis is usually self-limiting because raising ketones
to about 3–
5 mM by sodium-AcAc infusion stimulates insulin
secretion which in turn rapidly reduces plasma ketones (Owen
et al., 1973). Experimental insulin infusion can be used to induce
severe hypoglycemia but in the presence of prolonged starvation
does not induce ketoacidosis (Drenick et al., 1972).
Pathological ketoacidosis on the other hand is a medical
emergency arising in type 1 diabetes because of acute severe
insulin deficiency due usually to interruption of insulin injection.
Plasma ketones generally exceed 10–
15 mM and blood pH may
decrease to 7. Comorbidities such as alcoholism, malnutrition
and/or serious infection often contribute to exacerbating insulin
deficiency and increase the severity of the ketoacidosis. Hence,
unlike pathological ketosis, nutritional ketosis is a safe and
sustainable condition in which insulin decreases due to low
carbohydrate intake not because of a disease process. It can be
undertaken with medical supervision and usually involves low to
negligible risk to the individual. Nutritional ketosis can also be
rapidly reversed by consuming carbohydrate.
Long chain fatty acids (14–
22 carbons) stored in adipose
tissue are normally the main substrate for ketogenesis in adults
because the diet rarely contains MCFA. However, breast-feeding
infants are in mild ketosis principally because of the MCFA

they are consuming from breast milk (Cunnane and Crawford,
2014). There are two reasons why MCFA are particularly effective
ketogenic substrates (Figure 5): first, an oral dose of MCFA
is mostly absorbed from the gut directly into the portal vein.
This is a more rapid route to the liver than for dietary long
chain fatty acids which are absorbed as chylomicrons via the
lymphatic system and pass into the peripheral circulation before
reaching the liver. Second, unlike a long chain fatty acid which

requires carnitine-dependant activation to a Coenzyme A before
accessing the mitochondria, beta-oxidation of MCFA occurs
without activation by carnitine. The net result is more rapid beta-
oxidation and ketogenesis of MCFA than from long chain fatty
acids (Guillot et al., 1993).
The potential clinical benefit of MCTs as a rapid energy source
was initially reported for surgically stressed and/or malnourished
patients (Bach and Babayan, 1982; De Gaetano et al., 1994; St-
Onge and Jones, 2002). The ketogenic effect of MCT was already
well-known (Freund and Weinsier, 1966; Bach and Babayan,
1982) but was not clinically exploited until they were tried as an
alternative ketogenic approach to the ketogenic diet in refractory
childhood epilepsy (Huttenlocher, 1976). At about the same time,
MCT started to be introduced into formula milk for infants.
Owing to the interest in ketones as possible brain fuels to bypass
deteriorating brain glucose, the effects of MCT supplementation
on cognitive outcomes has been investigated in mild-moderate
AD in studies lasting several months (Henderson et al., 2009) but
also after just a single dose of MCT (Reger et al., 2004). Very high
fat diets are also ketogenic by virtue of their low carbohydrate
content and have been reported to have beneficial effects
on cognitive and cardiovascular outcomes in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), the prodromal state to AD (Krikorian et al.,
2012). In Type 1 diabetics undergoing controlled experimental
hypoglycemia caused by insulin infusion, MCT improve several
cognitive outcomes (Page et al., 2009). Collectively, these reports
suggest that beyond the well-established role of MCFA in infant
development and the use of MCT in parenteral and enteral
nutrition and intractable epilepsy, several aspects of cognitive
function that deteriorate during acute hyperinsulinemia or
with cognitive decline associated with AD can be partially or
completely normalized when ketones contribute to fuelling the
brain (Table 6).
Salts or esters of AcAc and β-HBA can also be directly
administered orally or by intra-venous infusion (Hasselbalch
et al., 1996; Plecko et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2012), and
inhibit the autonomic and neurological symptoms of acute
severe experimental hypoglycemia in humans (Amiel et al., 1991;
Veneman et al., 1994). The safety of sustained oral use of a
β-HBA-monoester and its anecdotal utility in improving some
aspects of cognitive function in an advanced case of early onset
AD have recently been reported (Newport et al., 2015) and are
being increasingly investigated in animal models (D’
Agostino
et al., 2013; Viggiano et al., 2015).
MCT: A SAFE, EFFICIENT KETOGENIC
SUBSTRATE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN
There is normally no further opportunity to consume MCFA
once breast-feeding is terminated. However, coconut and palm
kernel oils contain MCFA. The MCFA-enriched fraction of
these ‘
tropical’oils can be concentrated resulting in a generic
MCT product containing mostly fatty acids of eight (octanoic
or caprylic acid) and 10 carbons (decanoic or capric acid).
The ratio of caprylic and capric acids and their proportion of
the total can vary widely from one MCT product to another.
Notwithstanding the generic nature of MCT and different study

designs to assess their metabolism, there is a significant positive
correlation between the oral dose of MCT taken and the maximal
plasma β-HBA level achieved (Figure 6). This dose-response
relationship can be used to estimate a therapeutic dose of MCT
needed to achieve particular plasma ketone level. Octanoic acid
can be taken up by the brain (Kuge et al., 1995; Ebert et al., 2003)
so it may have direct effects on brain function including but not
limited to conversion to ketones by astrocytes (Auestad et al.,
1991).
Healthy older people have the same plasma ketone response
and beta-oxidize 13C-β-HBA to 13C-CO2 to the same extent after
a standard high fat ketogenic breakfast containing 70 g MCT as
middle aged or young adults (76 years-old vs. 50 or 23 years-
old, respectively; Freemantle et al., 2009). Another report suggests
that the plasma ketone response to 18 h fasting is somewhat
higher in older compared to younger adults (London et al., 1986).
However, in our experience, plasma β-HBA and AcAc tend to be
lower after an overnight fast in cognitively healthy older vs. young
adults but so far the trend is not significant owing to wide inter-
individual variability in plasma ketone data (Nugent et al., 2014b,
2016; Table 2). Hence, it seems likely that the capacity to produce

aging but this still requires further work.
Medium chain triglyceride are saturated fats and, as such,
their consumption is commonly associated with increased
cardiovascular risk. However, consuming 30 g/d of MCT for
30 days does not adversely affect serum glucose, insulin,
triglycerides, cholesterol, free fatty acids, body weight, or body-
mass index (Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2013). In extensive tests,
the safety of oral MCT at up to 1 g/kg/day is well-established
in all species including humans (Bach and Babayan, 1982; Traul
et al., 2000). MCT have important uses in parenteral nutrition and
are widely present in infant formula. Nevertheless, they can have
secondary side effects involving gastrointestinal distress, gastric
reflux, and possible diarrhea, issues that can usually be mitigated
by gradual dose titration.
REGIONAL BRAIN KETONE UPTAKE IN AD
The aforementioned clinical reports of a cognitive benefit of MCT
in AD (Reger et al., 2004; Henderson, 2008; Krikorian et al., 2012;
Newport et al., 2015) are still preliminary and require replication
on a larger scale. Nevertheless, they provisionally support the
hypothesis that a regional brain glucose deficit contributes to
impaired cognition associated with aging and that this deficit
can at least in part be bypassed by ketogenic treatments. A core
element of this interpretation is that brain cells and/or networks
that were previously dysfunctional can start to function more
normally again once they are provided with more fuel, i.e., they
were starving or exhausting but not dead; otherwise this cognitive
improvement would not be possible.

step in building the case that ketones could have beneficial

β-HBA uptake (solid line, R2 = 0.97; Y = 1.57X – 0.20; p < 0.0001; A–D), and the other for plasma acetoacetate vs. the rate of brain acetoacetate uptake

et al., 2002), as well as after a 40 day fast (L) (Owen et al., 1967), or 60 day fast (�) (Drenick et al., 1972). (B) Two studies of plasma β-HBA vs. brain uptake in AD

plasma β-HBA and the percent of brain energy consumption supplied by β-HBA in adults is broadly as follows: at plasma β-HBA values around 0.1 mM, ketones
supply >5% of brain energy; at 1 mM β-HBA, they supply about 10–15%; at 5–7 mM β-HBA, 50–65% and over 7–8 mM β-HBA, >75% of brain energy
consumption. For a given plasma acetoacetate concentration, acetoacetate is taken up by the brain more rapidly than β-HBA which explains why the dotted
regression line for acetoacetate lies above that of the solid line for β-HBA.

of ketones in disease and before and after ketogenic interventions.
We developed a PET research program using the ketone tracer,
11C-AcAc, to better understand the relation between brain fuel
uptake and brain function in people with or at risk of AD. We
use this dual tracer PET protocol to compare the brain uptake
of 11C-AcAc to that of FDG in each individual studied. We
quantify the magnitude of FDG and 11C-AcAc uptake regionally
throughout the brain. The kinetics of brain ketone metabolism
assessed using PET or arterio-venous difference suggest a one-
tissue compartment model in which brain utilization essentially
matches brain uptake (Lying-Tunell et al., 1981; Blomqvist et al.,
1995; Ogawa et al., 1996). PET studies of brain 11C-β-HBA uptake
in humans have already confirmed the earlier arterio-venous
difference studies showing that the brain uptake of β-HBA is
directly proportional to plasma β-HBA over a wide range of
plasma ketone concentrations 20 µM to >10 mM (Lying-Tunell
et al., 1981; Blomqvist et al., 1995, 2002; Figure 7). However,

technique allows for a quantitative same-day comparison of brain
uptake of glucose and ketones thereby avoiding the unnecessary
inconvenience to the participant of returning a second time, as

aims: first, to confirm for the first time using PET methodology
the arterio-venous difference reports of normal ketone but low
brain glucose uptake early in AD (Ogawa et al., 1996). Second,
to assess brain fuel metabolism early in AD rather than the

of both fuels under post-prandial conditions, information that
arterio-venous difference studies cannot provide. Our FDG and
11C-AcAc PET studies have so far confirmed several important
points: first, as reported previously by arterio-venous difference
in the brain taken as a whole (Figure 1), global CMRg was
14% lower in early AD vs. cognitively normal, age-matched
controls. Second, and as also previously shown by PET, this
global CMRg deficit in AD was primarily confined to the parietal
cortex, posterior cingulate and thalamus. Third, neither 11C-
AcAc uptake (CMRa) nor the AcAc uptake constant (Ka) were
significantly different in the brain as a whole or in any brain
region in AD or MCI vs. the age-matched cognitively healthy
controls (Figure 7). Fourth, plasma AcAc and CMRa were
significantly positively correlated, the slope of which did not
differ between early AD and cognitively healthy age-matched
controls or young adults (Castellano et al., 2015b; Figure 5).
Since brain ketone utilization in AD was proportional to plasma
concentration and this relationship had the same slope as in
age-matched controls (Figure 7), we conclude that brain ketone
uptake is not significantly disrupted early in AD.
As our database grows, we see a trend emerging toward a lower
AcAc uptake constant for the brain as a whole in cognitively
normal older people vs. young adults. However, when analyzed
region by region, the results are not significant but pooled for the
whole brain they are (Figure 9). So far, there is no trend toward
lower brain 11C-AcAc uptake or a lower AcAc uptake constant
in MCI or AD compared to our healthy older controls. Hence,
caution is needed in comparing either brain ketone uptake results
across age groups or in aging-associated cognitive decline for
the whole brain vs. measurements focused more on major brain
regions, specific nuclei or parts of the cortex.
COMPLIMENTARY APPROACHES TO
INCREASE KETOGENESIS?
We have investigated whether substances that increase fatty
acid availability to or oxidation by the liver might also increase
ketogenesis. If so, this would have the potential benefit of either
reducing the dose of MCT needed thereby reducing side-effects,
or increasing the ketogenic effect of the same dose of MCT. Three
such substances we have tested are alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-
3) and bezafibrate, two PPAR-alpha stimulators, and caffeine,
which stimulates lipolysis thereby raising plasma free fatty acids
(Acheson et al., 2004). Alpha-linolenic acid is also potentially
ketogenic because it is the most beta-oxidized of the common
dietary long chain fatty acids (Mamelak, 2012). Consuming 2 g
of alpha-linolenic acid daily in the form of flaxseed over 4 weeks
didn’
t change overnight fasting plasma ketones. However, it did
raise post-prandial ketone production by 26% but only in young
adults; there was no significant effect in older adults (Hennebelle
et al., 2016). Treatment with 400 mg of bezafibrate daily for
12 weeks was mildly ketogenic and increased fatty acid oxidation.
Bezafibrate reduced plasma insulin and glucose suggesting that it
may have a mild insulin-sensitizing effect. Plasma long chain fatty
acids were also significantly lower after bezafibrate (Tremblay-
Mercier et al., 2010). Co-treatment with bezafibrate (400 mg/d for
8 weeks) and 60 g/day of MCT transiently increased AcAc/β-HBA
more than MCT alone (Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2015). A 2.5
or 5.0 mg/kg dose of caffeine taken with a small breakfast
was moderately ketogenic 2–
4 h post-dose. During the 4 h test
period, plasma ketones and free fatty acids rose significantly
more on caffeine than in the control test and the rise was
broadly proportional to the dose of caffeine (Figure 10). We have
not yet explored whether caffeine affects the ketogenic effect of
MCT. Overall, these effects are modest but may merit further
investigation in a clinical population.
NEURONAL HYPEREXCITABILITY,
EPILEPTIC SEIZURES AND AD
Epileptic seizures are more prevalent in the aging population that
at any other age, a situation that seems to be related to a higher
incidence of cerebrovascular disease in older people. Sporadic
or late-onset AD is associated with higher risk of seizures

than in the general population (Amatniek et al., 2006; Vossel
et al., 2013; Zilberter et al., 2013). Higher genetic or familial
risk of AD is associated with hippocampal hyperexcitability
and may be linked to neuronal loss and reorganization and
to greater medial temporal lobe atrophy than in controls
(Lapointe et al., 2016). Other factors that may contribute to this
hyperexcitability include weakening of the inhibitory effect of
GABA, and neuronal hypometabolism in the brain (Zilberter
et al., 2013). Hyperexcitability in turn can further disrupt brain
energy metabolism thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of
deteriorating brain function and energy exhaustion. Given the
efficacy of ketogenic treatments in controlling refractory epileptic
seizures, especially in children, and their emerging utility for
cognitive decline in AD, it would therefore seem to be worth
assessing the efficacy of ketogenic treatments for seizures in the
geriatric population.
ISSUE – IS MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION
IMPAIRED EARLY IN AD?
The bulk of the ATP needed during energy metabolism
is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.
Glucose can also produce some ATP via glycolysis, a process
occurring outside mitochondria, whereas ketones produce
ATP uniquely via oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial
damage and increased production of reactive oxygen species
have been proposed to underlie beta-amyloid accumulation
and cognitive deterioration in AD (Gibson et al., 2000;
Swerdlow
and
Khan,
2004;
Yao
et
al.,
2009;
Swerdlow
et al., 2014). Ketone catabolism is entirely mitochondrial,
so normal whole body ketone oxidation in older humans
(Freemantle et al., 2009) argues for largely intact mitochondrial
function in reasonably healthy older people. Normal brain
ketone metabolism in AD (Figure 7) also suggests that the
enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the
brain continue to function relatively normally, at least early
in AD. Hence, early in AD, the problem with brain glucose
metabolism is not necessarily at the mitochondrial level but
possibly more because of lower glycolysis to acetyl CoA (see
Issue – Brain Glucose Uptake or Glycolysis or Both?). Lower
production of acetyl CoA would impair neuronal function
thereby accounting for the well-known observation of lower
glucose transport into the brain in AD. Oxidative damage to
mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction would also tend to
increase.
The
11C-AcAc used in our PET studies is chemically
identical to AcAc produced by the body and is metabolized
to 11C-CO2. Since the combined process of both brain uptake
and metabolism of 11C-AcAc is still normal in early AD, and
since ketone metabolism is uniquely mitochondrial, these
results indirectly support the speculation nearly 30 years
ago by Hoyer et al. (1988) that oxidative phosphorylation
and therefore mitochondrial function is relatively normal
early
in
AD.
Such
an
interpretation
is
also
supported
by
the
clinical
studies
showing
better
cognitive
scores
in
AD
when
more
ketones
are
provided
to
the
brain
(Table 6) because otherwise ketones would not have clinical
benefit.
The very high fat ketogenic diet increases various parameters
that represent the overall energy status of the brain, including
ATP and brain/blood glucose (DeVivo et al., 1978; Veech
et al., 2001; Cahill, 2006), as well as citric acid cycle activity
(Roy et al., 2015). Neural protection by ketones may also be
related to improved mitochondrial biogenesis and improved
respiratory function (Bough et al., 2006), as well as reduced
mitochondrial
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
in
response to glutamate (Maalouf et al., 2009). Since oxidative
phosphorylation
in
mitochondria
generates
free
radicals
and
ketone
metabolism
is
uniquely
oxidative,
it
could
also be argued that ketogenic supplements should actually
make
mitochondrial
dysfunction
worse,
which
should
in
turn
cause
cognitive
deterioration.
This
doesn’
t
happen
so,
again,
mitochondrial
function
can
apparently
cope
with the increased oxidative load caused by metabolizing
ketones.
Nevertheless,
this
topic
definitely
needs
further
investigation.
ISSUE – BRAIN GLUCOSE UPTAKE OR
GLYCOLYSIS OR BOTH?
The magnitude of the lower glucose metabolism by the AD
brain was well-established by arterio-venous difference studies
done 20–
30 years ago (Lying-Tunell et al., 1981; Hoyer et al.,
1988; Ogawa et al., 1996). However, these studies could
not establish whether the glucose problem was with glucose
transport into the brain via GLUT, or with glycolysis, i.e., the
metabolism of glucose to pyruvate within the brain, or both.
PET studies clearly show that glucose (FDG) uptake into the
brain and its conversion to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase
is lower in AD. However, FDG-PET cannot establish whether
the glycolytic steps are also impaired. Since mitochondrial
function seems to be normal in early AD and glucose transport
in the brain is dependent on neuronal activity, the brain
glucose hypometabolism problem in AD seems at least initially
to be with glycolysis because several glycolytic enzymes are
impaired in AD, including phosphofructokinase (Bowen et al.,
1979; Iwangoff et al., 1980), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex (Gibson et al., 2000), and pyruvate dehydrogenase
(Perry et al., 1980; Sorbi et al., 1983; Cunnane et al., 2011). If
the problem in AD starts with deteriorating glycolysis, neural
viability would eventually decrease, which would in turn decrease
glucose transport into the brain because it depends on neural
activity (Cunnane et al., 2011). As proposed many years ago
by Hoyer et al. (1988), lower glycolysis to acetyl CoA would
increase the brain’
s dependence on other routes to generate
ATP, including lactate and possibly even gluconeogenesis. The
brain’
s dependence on these routes to generate ATP could help
account for the adverse changes in brain amino acid metabolism
and neurotransmitter production including acetylcholine (Hoyer
et al., 1988). Hence, our perspective is that the AD brain must be
gradually pushed toward starvation mostly due to deteriorating
glycolysis.

ISSUE – IS EXCESSIVE CATAPLEROSIS
AN IMPEDIMENT TO SUCCESSFUL
KETO-NEUROTHERAPEUTICS?
In addition to generating ATP, the citric acid cycle also has a
key role in providing intermediates for several brain molecules
including the neurotransmitters, gamma-aminobutyric acid and
acetylcholine. The use of intermediates in the citric acid cycle to
make molecules other than ATP is known as cataplerosis (Owen
et al., 2002). Cataplerosis is usually balanced by anaplerosis,
which is the net contribution of carbon from various sources
to synthesize molecules derived from intermediates in the citric
acid cycle. Glucose and oxaloacetate are anaplerotic so when
both are insufficiently available, cataplerosis rapidly depletes
the citric acid cycle (Wilkins et al., 2016). Unlike glucose,
glutamine, pyruvate and precursors to propionyl CoA, the four
carbon ketones (AcAc and β-HBA) do not contribute any
carbon to anaplerosis (Brunengraber and Roe, 2006). Indeed,
ketones are probably cataplerotic in part because they increase
citric acid cycle activity (Roy et al., 2015). Hence, glucose
itself or an alternative anaplerotic substrate is essential in
order to metabolize ketones, especially as ketosis becomes more
extreme.
When glucose supply to the brain is severely limited,
such as in inherited GLUT-1 deficiency, there is insufficient
glucose entering tissues to support energy production. Providing
a ketogenic supplement is clinically beneficial but without
anaplerotic input, chronic ketosis could potentially exhaust the
citric acid cycle (Mochel et al., 2005; Brunengraber and Roe, 2006;
Roe and Mochel, 2006). Triheptanoin (triglyceride with three
heptanoic acids) is an odd-carbon MCT that is both ketogenic
and anaplerotic and has clinically significant beneficial effects
in GLUT-1 transporter deficiency and in Huntington’
s disease
(Mochel et al., 2005, 2010; Pascual et al., 2014). Furthermore,
ketogenesis in the liver requires about 150 g/day of glucose that
needs to be supplied by gluconeogenesis (Garber et al., 1974;
Fukao et al., 2004). An alternative route of gluconeogenesis
of unknown importance during nutritional ketosis involves
increased acetone production which can be converted to glucose
(Owen and Reichard, 1971; Reichard et al., 1974), thereby
potentially contributing to sustaining both ketogenesis and
anaplerosis.
This question of ketogenesis and anaplerosis is relevant
to brain hypometabolism in AD because as AD becomes
more severe, brain glucose uptake and/or utilization continue
to deteriorate thereby further compromising both energy
production
and
anaplerosis
which
are
both
needed
for
neurotransmitter
synthesis.
This
adverse
situation
could
potentially improve or worsen with sustained ketosis; it all
depends on the trade-off between supplying more ketones to
compensate for the glucose deficit and generate ATP, vs. burning
out the citric acid cycle and depleting acetylcholine and GABA if
cataplerosis exceed anaplerosis. Nevertheless, ketones are not the
only fuel that bypasses impaired glycolysis: recent animal studies
suggest that direct administration of pyruvate could be beneficial
component of a ketogenic intervention for AD (Zilberter et al.,
2013). In vitro studies show that exogenous oxaloacetate may also
help bypass issues with glycolysis and maintain mitochondrial
respiration (Wilkins et al., 2016).
ISSUE – IS THE KETOGENIC RESPONSE
TO ALL MCT THE SAME?
Medium chain triglyceride are a generic product that varies
widely in composition. They are usually concentrated in caprylic
and capric acids but the ratio of these two fatty acids can
vary from 70:30 to 30:70. Despite this variability, a compilation
of various studies shows a significant positive correlation
between the oral dose of MCT given and the resulting maximal
plasma ketone response (Figure 6). Although MCT are most
commonly a combination of caprylic and capric acids, these
two fatty acids are also available separately. In unpublished
work, we have observed that the net plasma ketone response
to an equal dose of essentially pure caprylic acid exceeds by
15–
20% that of an MCT containing caprylic:capric acid at
60:40 which in turn exceeded that of coconut oil by a wide
margin (manuscript in preparation). At the same time, the
change in plasma AcAc/β-HBA was actually significantly higher
for coconut oil than for caprylic acid. This was an acute
metabolic study conducted during an 8 h period with a 20 ml
dose of the test ketogenic substance taken at breakfast and a
second 20 ml dose taken at mid-day without a meal; whether
the same changes occur in the long-term still needs to be
evaluated.
The formulation of the oral dose of MCT may also impact
on the ketone response. We have observed that a 30 g
dose of MCT in one formulation can generate a 40% higher
plasma ketone response over 4 h than a different formulation
containing 50 g of MCT (Figure 11). These results raise the
questions of whether it matters which MCT is consumed, the
bioequivalence of coconut oil vs. MCT, and what metric is
most important in assessing the metabolic response to ketogenic
supplements; β-HBA, AcAc, both combined, their ratio, or
something else.
ISSUE – METABOLIC PHENOTYPE OF
THE COGNITIVELY HEALTHY OLDER
PERSON OR RED FLAG?
Age-normalization is a standard procedure with cognitive scores
for older people and in MCI and AD. Hence, a lower raw
cognitive score in an older person is not necessarily indicative
of progression toward AD; rather, it depends on the type of
test and the degree that the score is lower relative to age-
normalized values. In the same vein, should regional brain
glucose uptake (CMRg) also be normalized for age because
CMRg too declines with age even in cognitively healthy older
persons? In order to determine whether a lower CMRg value
with age is normal or represents a risk for AD, age-normalized
reference values need to be established so as to be able to

distinguish a physiologically normal from a pathological change
in CMRg.
Changes in peripheral glucose metabolism leading toward
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of
AD (Craft, 2009, 2012; Baker et al., 2011). As with low
cognitive scores, should metabolic parameters be considered
in including or excluding older persons from a reference
group of cognitively healthy older people? In other words,
from an energy metabolism perspective, how should we define
‘
normal’or ‘
healthy’brain aging? The answer affects not only
how data on brain energy metabolism in MCI and AD are
interpreted but whether lower brain energy metabolism during
‘
normal’
aging is truly physiological or imminently pathological.
Such age-normalization would have two goals – to facilitate
the early diagnosis of AD and, if such age-normalized brain
glucose hypometabolism were present, to implement a pre-
emptive intervention, whether ketone-based or other. One of
the challenges with age-normalization of cognitive or metabolic
data is that those in whom the onset of AD is imminent cannot
presently be distinguished from those who may not get it for
10–
20 years (or at all).
Our work shows that older people classified as cognitively
normal by conventional neuropsychological tests corrected for
age and education have significant brain atrophy, cortical
thinning and lower brain glucose metabolism compared to
cognitively normal younger adults (Nugent et al., 2014b, 2016).
The differences were region-specific and more widespread for
regional gray matter atrophy and cortical thinning than for
CMRg. The age-related difference in CMRg was similar to the
decline in volume and cortical thickness, and represents a decline
of 0.3–
0.4%/year (Nugent et al., 2016). Our work confirms several
previous reports and suggests that the most consistent finding
for CMRg during normal aging is glucose hypometabolism in
the frontal cortex (De Santi et al., 1995; Moeller et al., 1996;
Petit-Taboue et al., 1998; Garraux et al., 1999; Herholz et al.,
2002; Zuendorf et al., 2003; Kalpouzos et al., 2009; Nugent et al.,
2014a,b). Lower CMRg in the frontal cortex may be contributing
to less efficient executive function in older people, i.e., greater
recruitment or less inhibition of frontal regions for the same task
than in younger adults (Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004). However,
our older group still had cognitive test scores that were normal-
for-age.
Quite a few neurometabolic differences can be expected
between cognitively healthy older adults (Table 3). There were
no diabetics or pre-diabetics in either group but our measure
of insulin resistance, the HOMA2-IR, tended toward the high
end of the normal range and was positively associated with
higher CMRg, but only in the older group (Nugent et al., 2016).
A HOMA2-IR toward the high end of the normal range and
body fat content of at least 30% were both associated with
normal cognitive function in older adults in this particular
population (Nugent et al., 2016). Do these metabolic differences
with age suggest that higher plasma insulin and a higher
metabolic rheostat are necessary to maintain normal cognition
in older people? Alternatively, do declining (though normal-for-
age) cognitive scores with age represent a red flag because they
drive up the metabolic rheostat? Either way, more work needs
to be done evaluating the relation between changing metabolic-
endocrine status and cognition regardless of age.
PERSPECTIVE
We
make
the
case
here
that
regional
brain
glucose
hypometabolism can definitely be present in those at risk of AD
but decades before the onset of cognitive decline associated with
AD, i.e., that it is a pre-symptomatic problem (Figure 3). Hence,
it is incorrect to perceive of brain glucose hypometabolism in
AD as being uniquely a consequence of irreversible neuronal
failure or death. Pre-symptomatic brain glucose hypometabolism
isn’
t necessarily the cause of AD or even the first step in the
pathogenesis of AD. However, two points are clear –(i) AD is at
least in part exacerbated by (if not actually caused by) chronic,
progressive brain fuel starvation due specifically to brain glucose
deficit, and (ii) attempting to treat the cognitive deficit early in
AD using ketogenic interventions in clinical trials is safe, ethical,
and scientifically well-founded (Henderson et al., 2009; Rebello
et al., 2015; see also ClinicalTrials.gov).
A number of issues have been flagged here that will require
further work in order to optimize keto-neurotherapeutics in
AD. They include the state of brain mitochondrial respiration,
whether the problem with brain glucose utilization starts with
impaired glycolysis, the importance of balancing anaplerosis
and cataplerosis, differential ketone responses to MCT mixtures
depending on formulation, and the significance of lower CMRg in
the frontal cortex during cognitively normal aging. The elephant
in the room that we have intentionally not discussed till now
is the beta-amyloid hypothesis of AD. Suffice it to note here
that beta-amyloid accumulation occurs as a result of either

impaired brain glucose availability to the brain (Velliquette et al.,
2005) or impaired glycolysis within the brain (Meier-Ruge et al.,
1994). Beta-amyloid also contributes to impaired glycolysis in the
AD brain (Meier-Ruge and Bertoni-Freddari, 1997). Ketogenic
treatments reduce amyloid burden in animal models of AD
(Kashiwaya et al., 2000; Hertz et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016)
but this extremely encouraging effect remains to be verified in
humans. Clinical trials with ketogenic interventions in AD, MCI
or insulin-induced hypoglycemia start to improve some cognitive
outcomes within hours to days (Hasselbalch et al., 1996; Reger
et al., 2004; Henderson, 2008; Newport et al., 2015), arguing that
if they also reduce amyloid burden, it is a secondary effect. Hence,
we feel that dealing with the brain energy deficit would help the
brain metabolize beta-amyloid as it normally should.
The challenge that immune function and neuroinflammation
may pose with respect to providing the brain with sufficient
energy during aging also deserves comment. We and others have
previously proposed that immunosenescence in older people can
tip toward a pro-inflammatory condition. Since the activated
immune system consumes a lot of energy, heightened immune
surveillance during aging constitutes a potentially important
energy sink in the body which can compete with the brain
for a fixed (or declining) energy intake in older people. This
situation is probably exacerbated by infection, inflammation,
or other chronic response of the immune system. Under such
circumstances, it takes little to tip the body’
s energy intake
more toward supporting the immune response and away from
the brain, which then contributes to brain energy starvation
and increased risk of cognitive decline during aging (Fulop
et al., 2013, 2015). Apart from the greatly increased need for
energy by activated immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines
impair ketone production (Pailla et al., 2001), making the brain’
s
energy supply even more vulnerable. Hence, brain energy deficit,
neuropathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive decline all
feed off each other in a vicious cycle that can lead to rapid
progression of AD (Figure 3). Ketogenic treatments help elicit a
protective response to neuroinflammation (Rahman et al., 2014),
an encouraging observation that needs confirmation and further
work.
Several different ketogenic interventions including prolonged
fasting, a very high fat ketogenic diet containing no MCT, or a
regular diet to which MCT or ketone esters all have a broadly
similar neurological/cognitive benefit (Table 6). The cognitive
benefit of ketones is observed under different conditions
including in the presence of chronically impaired brain glucose
availability or utilization due to disease (i.e., MCI or AD), or
when the brain glucose deficit is acute, i.e., severe hypoglycemia
experimentally induced by insulin infusion and starvation (Owen
et al., 1967). The wide range of ketogenic conditions that protect
cognition suggests that ketones themselves (rather than MCFAs)
are central to their beneficial effect but this needs to be confirmed
along with determining the actual mechanism. At present,
a keto-neurotherapeutic approach is a safe and scientifically
well-supported strategy to bypass deteriorating brain energy
metabolism arising during aging; time will tell whether it is truly
clinically effective to limit the onset or progression of cognitive
decline in AD.
