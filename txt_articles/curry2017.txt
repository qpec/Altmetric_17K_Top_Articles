IMPORTANCE Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into
adolescence, when motor vehicle crash risk peaks. We know little about when adolescents
with ADHD get licensed and, once they do, the extent to which they have increased crash risk
compared with adolescents without ADHD.
OBJECTIVES To examine the association between ADHD and both driver licensing and crash
involvement and whether it varies by sex, licensing age, and/or being prescribed ADHD
medication at licensure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 6
primary care practices of the Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia, a large pediatric health care
network in southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. Using electronic health
records, we defined a cohort of 2479 adolescents and young adults with ADHD and 15 865
without ADHD who were (1) born from 1987 to 1997; (2) residents of New Jersey and patients
at 1 of 6 New Jersey primary care practices at age 12 years or older; and (3) age-eligible to
obtain a driver’
s license from 2004 through 2014. Electronic health records data were then
linked with New Jersey’
s statewide driver licensing and crash databases for 2004 through
2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acquisition of a driver’
s license and first involvement as a
driver in a police-reported crash. Survival analysis was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios
for licensing and crash outcomes through age 25 years.
RESULTS The median age of individuals at the end of the study was 22.2 years (interquartile
range, 19.7-24.8). Compared with individuals without ADHD, the licensing probability of
individuals with ADHD 6 months after eligibility was 35% lower (for males: adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.61-0.70; females: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.70).
Among individuals with a driver’
s license, 764 of 1785 with ADHD (42.8%) and 4715 of 13 221
without ADHD (35.7%) crashed during the study period. The adjusted risk for first crash
among licensed drivers with ADHD was 1.36 times higher than for those without ADHD (95%
CI, 1.25-1.48) and did not vary by sex, licensing age, or over time. Only 129 individuals with
ADHD (12.1%) were prescribed medication in the 30 days before licensure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents with ADHD get licensed less often and at an
older age. Once licensed, this cohort has a greater risk of crashing. Additional research is
needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which ADHD influences crash risk.

 A
ttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a
common childhood disorder,1-3 often persists into
adolescence,4 a period in which many individuals get
licensed to drive.5 Along with benefits of mobility and inde-
pendence, driving increases the risk of a motor vehicle crash,
the leading cause of death among US adolescents.6 Of particu-
lar concern is that defining symptoms of ADHD—inattention,
hyperactivity, and impulsivity—have been linked to unsafe
driving behaviors,7,8 creating the potential for heightened
adverse health risk for adolescents with ADHD.
Previous studies revealed more driving errors and
unsafe driving behaviors (in simulator-based and naturalistic
studies)7,9,10 and an increased crash risk among those with
ADHD,11-15 with a 1993 study citing a 4-fold increase.15 How-
ever, previous crash studies11-15 have substantial methodologi-
cal limitations: inclusion of small samples from specialty clin-
ics; self- or parent-reported driving outcomes with long recall
periods; lack of adjustment for important confounders (eg,
disruptive behavioral disorder and driving experience); and
almost entirely samples of male drivers. Additionally, all but 1
study14 were conducted before 2001 when distractions, par-
ticularlyfromhandheldandin-vehicleelectronicdevices,were
less prevalent and before Graduated Driver Licensing systems,
which increased the minimum driving age and introduced an
intermediate licensing phase to restrict exposure to hazardous
conditions, were widely implemented. Thus, we know little
aboutwhenadolescentswithADHDgetlicensedand,oncethey
do, the extent to which they are at increased crash risk.
To our knowledge, we conducted the first longitudinal
study specifically designed to examine crash risk among ado-
lescents and young adults with community-identified ADHD
over their initial years of licensure. Specifically, we linked elec-
tronic health records (EHRs) to state traffic safety databases
for a cohort of more than 18 000 primary care patients of the
Children’
s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) health care net-
work. We also determined whether the ADHD-crash associa-
tion varies by sex, licensing age, and/or being prescribed ADHD
medication given that ADHD prevalence and crash risk both
vary by sex, there are substantial variations in crash risk by
licensing age,16,17 and ADHD medication may improve driv-
ing behavior.18,19
Methods
Study Design and Sample
Individuals for this retrospective cohort study were identi-
fied from the 6 New Jersey CHOP primary care practices within
CHOP’
s network, which encompasses more than 50 locations
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Clinicians manage all as-
pects of clinical care using a linked EHR system, which was
fully implemented in New Jersey primary care by 2005. We
queried CHOP’
s EHR database to select individuals who
(1) were born from 1987 to 1997; (2) were patients at a New
Jersey primary care practice; and (3) had a CHOP network visit
(to any location) as a New Jersey resident within 4 years of be-
coming eligible for their learner’
s permit at age 16 years and
maintained a New Jersey address through their last network
visit to establish New Jersey residency. We identified 19 588
individuals. We excluded 73 individuals with an intellectual
disability given that this essentially removed them from the
pool of eligible drivers; intellectual disability was defined as
thepresenceofanInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code be-
ginning with 317, 318, or 319 either at a CHOP visit or on the
listofknownconditions(ie,problemlist).Additionally,welim-
ited our population to individuals who had 2 or more primary
care visits to minimize ADHD misclassification and those who
had their last primary care visit at age 12 years or older to en-
sure individuals were seen by a primary care clinician at an age
old enough to confirm ADHD status (Diagnostic and Statistical
ManualofMentalDisorders[FifthEdition]criteriacallforADHD
symptom onset by age 12 years).20 The study cohort included
18 522 primary care patients (Figure 1). This study was
approved by CHOP’
s institutional review board, and 1 of the
authors (K.B.M.) analyzed the data. Consent was waived by the
institutional review board because the study included link-
ing of 2 databases, with a total of over 10 million records.
ADHD Classification
Individuals were classified as having ADHD if their EHR indi-
cated an ICD-9-CM code beginning with 314 either at a CHOP
network visit or on their problem list; 2503 individuals with
ADHD were identified. We formally validated this algorithm
using manual review of EHRs; estimated sensitivity was 0.96,
and specificity was 0.98.21 For 2021 of 2503 (80.7%) of indi-
viduals, we found an independent source in the EHR confirm-
ingADHDstatus(eg,letters,medicationortestresults).Of2503
individuals, 2357 with ADHD (94.2%) were classified based on
visit-level ICD-9-CM codes.
Licensing and Crash Data
We obtained records for all individuals who received a New
Jersey driver’
s license through December 2014 from the New
Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission’
s Licensing Database,
including exact dates of birth and licensure. The minimum
licensure age in New Jersey is 17 years. Detailed data on police-
reported crashes occurring in New Jersey from 2004 to 2014
Key Points
Questions What is the association between attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and crash involvement among
adolescent and young adult drivers, and does this vary by sex,
licensing age, and/or being prescribed ADHD medication?
Findings In this cohort study of 2479 adolescents and young
adults with ADHD and 15 865 without ADHD, the crash hazard
among newly licensed drivers with ADHD was 36% higher. Hazard
ratios persisted over licensure and did not vary by sex, licensing
age, or medication.
Meaning Crash risk is heightened for young drivers with ADHD;
research is critically needed to identify the specific mechanisms by
which ADHD influences crash risk to develop effective
countermeasures.

 were obtained from the New Jersey Department of Transpor-
tation’
s Crash Database. These databases were linked in a pre-
vious study.22 In total, 98% of New Jersey drivers who were
involved in crashes were linked to a licensing record. The link-
age process was validated, and we concluded that the
process was conducted with high quality.
Linkage of EHR and Driving Data
Data from the EHR for a larger cohort of CHOP patients who
were New Jersey residents were individually linked with
licensing-crash data via a hierarchical deterministic linkage.
Data elements included date of birth, full name, sex, zip code,
city, and street number of residence. Based on a hand review
of 3348 records, we estimated the true match rate (ie, true
matches/original matches) to be 99.95%. The false nonmatch
rate (ie, true matches that were not found), assessed by search-
ing for the 5 most likely potential matches for a sample of 474
unmatched individuals, was estimated to be 1.5%.
Variables
Main outcome measures were time to acquisition of a New
Jerseydriver’
slicenseandfirstinvolvementasadriverinaNew
Jersey police-reported crash. A crash is reportable if it results
in an injury or more than $500 in property damage.23
Sex, date of birth, race/ethnicity, and insurance payor at
last visit were determined from the EHR. We used ICD-9-CM
codes to determine the presence of seizure disorder (345x) and
disruptive behavior disorders (conduct disorder [312x] and op-
positional defiant disorder [313.81]). For each participant with
ADHD, we determined from the EHR whether an ADHD medi-
cation was prescribed by a CHOP clinician within 12 months
of licensure (a proxy for ADHD severity) and within 30 days
of licensure (given that ADHD stimulant medications prescrip-
tions cover 30 days and cannot be refilled). We used the 2010
US Census Gazetteer Files and 2007 to 2011 American
Community Survey data to categorize residence zip code at
last visit into quintiles of population density and median
household income, respectively.24,25
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were restricted to 2479 individuals with ADHD and
15 865 individuals without ADHD who had at least 1 full month
offollow-upafterbecomingage-eligibleforlicensure(Figure1).
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate cumula-
tive probability of licensure and crash involvement over time;
the log-rank test was used to compare differences. Multivari-
able Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted
hazard ratios (aHRs). The proportionality assumption was as-
sessed using Kolmogorov-type supremum tests and by consid-
ering the interaction of ADHD status with follow-up time. The
association between ADHD and time to licensure was ob-
served to vary temporally in males (supremum test: P < .001),
but not females (P = .10); thus, to account for time depen-
dence among males only, final Cox models that used linear and
quadratic terms determined to provide the best model fit by
likelihood ratio tests. The association between ADHD and time
to first crash did not vary over time (P = .40). Adjusted models
include potential confounders chosen a priori based on known
or suspected associations with ADHD (or its clinical diagnosis)
and driving outcomes including sex, race/ethnicity, insurance
payor, disruptive behavior and seizure disorders, licensure age
(for crash outcome), primary care practice, birth year, and zip
code–level income and population density. Multiplicative
interaction was assessed using likelihood ratio tests. We exam-
ined the association between medication and crashes among
the 1036 licensed drivers with ADHD who had a CHOP net-
work visit in the year before licensure. We compared crash haz-
ards in the 2 years after licensure for 3 groups: those not
prescribed ADHD medication within the year before licensure;
thoseprescribedmedicationintheyearbeforelicensurebutnot
in the 30 days before licensure; and those prescribed medica-
tionwithin30daysoflicensure.Estimateswereconsideredsig-
nificant at the .05 level, and hypothesis tests were 2-sided.

Results
Study Population
Individuals had a median of 19 primary care visits (interquar-
tile range [IQR], 10-33), had their last visit at a median age of
18.0 years (IQR, 16.0-18.9), and were a median age of 22.2 years
(IQR, 19.7-24.8) at the end of the study period (Table 1). Indi-
viduals with ADHD had a median of 2 primary care visits (IQR,
1-5) that included an ADHD-specific ICD-9-CM code. Table 1
shows comparisons of relevant characteristics.
Licensing Rates
Overall,222of691femaleswithADHD(32.1%)and3874of8323
females without ADHD (46.5%) were licensed in their first
month of eligibility, and 311 of 391 (79.5%) and 4502 of 5210
(86.4%), respectively, were licensed by age 21 years. Table 2
shows the unadjusted cumulative probability of licensure by
select ages. Licensing rates among males were lower in ADHD

 and non-ADHD groups but followed a similar pattern. Unad-
justed curves of time to licensure by ADHD status and sex are
shown in Figure 2. Among males, adjusted Cox models indi-
cated that differences in licensure between ADHD and non-
ADHD groups diminished over time (by age 17.5 years:
aHR, 0.65;95%CI,0.61-0.70vsbyage19years:aHR,1.00;95%
CI, 0.87-1.14). Among females, the difference remained con-
stant over time (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.70). Among indi-
viduals ultimately licensed, females with ADHD were older at
licensure than females without ADHD (median age, 17.2 years;
IQR, 17.0-17.8 years vs 17.0 years; IQR, 17.0-17.5 years; P < .001)
and males with ADHD were older than males without ADHD
(median age, 17.4 years; IQR, 17.0-18.0 years vs 17.1 years; IQR,
17.0-17.6 years; P < .001).
Crash Rates
Crash analyses were limited to those licensed: 1785 individu-
als with ADHD and 13 221 without ADHD. Of these, 764 with
ADHD (42.8%) and 4715 without ADHD (35.7%) crashed by the
end of the study period. Unadjusted cumulative probabilities
ofcrashinvolvementbyselectpostlicensuremonthsareshown
in Table 2. Figure 3 shows the proportion of licensed drivers
who remained crash-free over time by ADHD status and sex;
both males and females with ADHD were more likely to crash
earlier and at higher frequencies than those without ADHD.
In adjusted Cox models, the overall aHR for crash risk among
adolescent drivers with ADHD was 1.36 (95% CI, 1.25-1.48).
Further, there was no evidence that the ADHD-crash relation-
ship varied on the multiplicative scale by licensing age

 (χ2 = 0.26; P = .97) or sex (χ2 = 2.05; P = .15). The crash hazard
among males with ADHD was 1.42 times higher (95% CI,
1.28-1.56) than among males without ADHD and 1.25 times
higher (95% CI, 1.08-1.45) for females with ADHD than
females without ADHD.

work visit in the year before licensure, 267 (25.1%) were pre-
scribedADHDmedicationinthatyearand129(12.1%)werepre-

We conducted sensitivity analyses by reclassifying 482
individuals with ADHD who did not have independent con-
firming evidence of ADHD into the non-ADHD group. Results
did not meaningfully change; estimated aHRs for crash were
attenuated by less than 1%. We also reweighted the time vari-
able in Cox regression models to assess potential bias owing
to differences in driving exposure (mileage) and estimated that
individuals with ADHD would have to drive a mean of 48%
more miles than those without ADHD before the 95% CIs of
aHRs included 1.0.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to esti-
mate licensing probability and crash likelihood throughout

 adolescence and young adulthood among individuals with
ADHD identified in a community setting. Results indicate that
individualswithADHDarelicensedsomewhatlessandlaterthan
those without ADHD. Further, licensed individuals with ADHD
experienced an estimated 36% increase in the risk of first crash
involvement than those without ADHD, an increase that exists
regardless of licensure age and persists into early adulthood.
Only 12.1% of individuals with ADHD were prescribed medica-
tion by a CHOP clinician in the 30 days before licensure; medi-
cation status at licensure did not significantly alter crash risk.
Using a rigorous epidemiologic design, this study over-
came limitations of previous studies by including objective
measures of license and crash occurrence over an extended
period, accounting for sex, licensing age, driving experience,
comorbid conditions, and other potential confounders and
increasing generalizability to the general population of ado-
lescents with ADHD via use of a community-identified co-
hort. In 1993, a small clinic-based investigation of this topic
suggested “an almost fourfold increase in the average fre-
quency of [crash involvement]” for adolescents with ADHD,15
a finding frequently cited in other studies and media.7,26,27
However, it is likely that internal and/or external validity were
compromised in that and other previous studies given poten-
tial of confounding and limited generalizability owing to com-
paring specialized clinic-based ADHD samples to conve-
niently sampled comparison groups; no or inadequate control
for driving experience and/or comorbid conditions; small
sample sizes; and lack of females.11-15 Additionally, these stud-
ies assessed crash outcomes via self-report surveys with long
recall periods.11-14 This may be of particular concern among
those with ADHD given findings of “positive illusory bias,” or
overestimation of performance and abilities, in driving and
other domains.28,29 A 2006 meta-analysis of self-report driv-
ing studies among adolescent and young adult drivers esti-
mated a risk ratio for crash involvement of 1.88 (95% CI,
1.42-2.50)30; a 2014 meta-analysis that included adult stud-
ies but accounted for driving exposure estimated a risk ratio
of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.04-1.46).31 Two population-based studies of
crash-related hospital visits published in 2010 and 2014 esti-
mated a 34% to 47% increased risk among adolescent male
drivers with ADHD and adult drivers with ADHD.32,33
The large population included in this study made it, to our
knowledge, the first sufficiently powered to examine how the
effect of ADHD on crash rates varied by both sex and licens-
ing age. We did not find evidence that HRs varied signifi-
cantly by either factor. However, studies34-37 among commu-
nity samples of children with ADHD have suggested that
symptom profiles may differ in ways that would affect driv-
ing. Boys may experience greater hyperactivity, impulsivity,
and externalizing problems, and girls may experience more in-
ternalizing problems (eg, anxiety, depression) and poten-
tially higher levels of inattention.34-37 Future research should
examine male and female drivers separately to uncover
potential sex-based mechanisms underlying increased crash
risk among adolescent drivers with ADHD. In addition, al-
though initial crash risk is generally lower for adolescents
licensed later,16 we found no evidence that crash risk differs
multiplicatively by licensing age for adolescents and young
adults with and without ADHD. More in-depth analyses should
be conducted to determine why adolescents with ADHD get
licensed later and whether the potential benefits of later li-
censure might be enhanced by extending the intermediate
phase of Graduated Driver Licensing, which lowers crash risk
by restricting exposure to high-risk situations.38
Study results demonstrate the need to provide guidance
for families around reducing the elevated crash risk among
young drivers with ADHD,39 yet foundational research and evi-
dence-based recommendations are lacking. Several efficacy
studies,primarilyusingdrivingsimulators,indicatethatADHD
medication improves driving behavior.18,19 Further, a prior
study found that medication statistically significantly re-
duced the risk of serious transport crashes in male but not
female patients with ADHD.33 Our study found that prescrip-
tion rates at licensure were low and did not reveal a differ-

 ence in crash risk among those prescribed medication at
licensure. Notably, however, we were not able to capture pre-
scriptions from non-CHOP clinicians, and sample size was
limited. The real-world effectiveness of medication may be
attenuated because of known inconsistent adherence among
adolescents and failure to use medication, which is generally
short-acting,whendriving(eg,afterschool).40-43On-roadcrash
studies that capture medication use more precisely than or-
dered or dispensed prescriptions and at the time of the crash
are critically needed. Other studies have explored aspects of
driver training and parental monitoring with some early sug-
gestion of benefit,44,45 but none have demonstrated clear posi-
tive effects on objective measures of risky driving or crashes.
Additional work is critically needed to provide clinicians with
evidence-based guidance on appropriate age of licensure and
specific practice guidelines to reduce crashes in this popula-
tion (including training, monitoring, and medication use).
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study. Diagnoses relied on
assessmentbyprimarycarecliniciansratherthanrigoroustest-
ing using criterion standard as set by Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition); however, we vali-
dated ADHD diagnosis codes with high sensitivity and speci-
ficity, and most individuals continued to have primary care
visits after becoming eligible for licensure.21 Given that our
sample includes individuals who were identified before ado-
lescence, a certain percentage may not have impairments ow-
ing to ADHD symptoms by the time of licensure46; thus, this
sample more appropriately reflects individuals with a life-
time history of ADHD. Additionally, we did not directly mea-
sure driving exposure. Young adults with ADHD reported driv-
ing more in 2 of 3 previous studies that assessed mileage.11,12,47
However, these assessments involved surveys of usual driv-
ing patterns at the time of survey, potentially years after crash
occurrence, or total mileage driven in the 3 to 5 years since
licensureandmaybesubjecttopositiveillusorybias.Ouranaly-
ses inherently accounted for time since licensure, which has
been used as a proxy for exposure and itself is a critically im-
portantvariablegivenrapiddeclinesincrashratesoverthefirst
few years of driving. Adolescents and young adults with ADHD
may also be less likely to attend college, and hence move out
of state after high school, than their counterparts without
ADHD48,49; however, significant associations were constant
overtimeandincludetheperiodjustafterlicensurewhenmost
individuals were still in high school. Finally, there may be lim-
its to generalizability. New Jersey has the oldest licensing age
intheUnitedStatesandishighlyurbanized.Further,thepreva-
lence of ADHD in our primary care cohort (14%) was some-
what higher than US-based estimates,50 perhaps reflecting
parental decisions to seek care within the CHOP network.
Conclusions
Adolescents and young adults with ADHD experience an
estimated 36% higher motor vehicle crash risk than their coun-
terparts without ADHD regardless of licensure age or sex; risk
persists over the first few years of licensure. Few individuals
with ADHD had active ADHD prescriptions at the time of
licensure. Future research is needed to examine parent and
clinician management of licensure decisions and crash risk
among patients with ADHD, elucidate sex-specific mecha-
nisms by which ADHD influences crash risk to develop coun-
termeasures, and examine real-world effectiveness of medi-
cation use and detrimental effects of distractions.
