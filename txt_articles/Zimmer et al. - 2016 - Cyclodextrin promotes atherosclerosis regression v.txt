Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease linked to elevated blood cholesterol concentrations. Despite ongoing
advances in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of
death worldwide. Continuous retention of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins in the subendothelial space causes
a local overabundance of free cholesterol. Because cholesterol accumulation and deposition of cholesterol crystals (CCs)
trigger a complex inflammatory response, we tested the efficacy of the cyclic oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-
b-cyclodextrin (CD), a compound that increases cholesterol solubility in preventing and reversing atherosclerosis.
We showed that CD treatment of murine atherosclerosis reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and CC load and
promoted plaque regression even with a continued cholesterol-rich diet. Mechanistically, CD increased oxysterol
production in both macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques and promoted liver X receptor (LXR)–
mediated transcriptional reprogramming to improve cholesterol efflux and exert anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo,
this CD-mediated LXR agonism was required for the antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD as well as
for augmented reverse cholesterol transport. Because CD treatment in humans is safe and CD beneficially affects key
mechanisms of atherogenesis, it may therefore be used clinically to prevent or treat human atherosclerosis.
INTRODUCTION
Atherosclerosis is the underlying pathology that causes heart attacks,
stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Collectively, these conditions
represent a common health problem, and current treatments are in-
sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of disease development. Phar-
macologic reduction (1–3) of high-cholesterol concentrations is among
the most successful therapeutic approaches to reduce the risk of devel-
oping cardiovascular disease and stroke, but adequate reduction of low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is not possible in all patients.
Atherosclerosis is characterized by arterial wall remodeling, which
is initiated by the retention and accumulation of different classes of
lipids in the subendothelial layer. Lipid deposition and the appearance
of cholesterol crystals (CCs) have been associated with the induction
of an inflammatory reaction in the vessel wall, which contributes to
the pathogenesis (4, 5). Patients with increased systemic inflammation
have increased risk of cardiovascular death, and studies are under way
to test whether anti-inflammatory treatment can reduce cardiovascular
event rates (6).
CCs, which can result from excessive cholesterol deposition in ather-
osclerotic lesions, are among the proinflammatory triggers that con-
tribute to the inflammatory response during atherogenesis (7). CCs
can trigger complement activation and neutrophil extracellular trap
(NET) formation, as well as induction of innate immune pathways
(4, 5, 8–10). Hence, therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention of
cholesterol phase transition or the removal of CCs could reduce tissue
inflammation and disease progression.
Genetic approaches to increase the capacity of macrophages to re-
move free cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions have proven to be
highly successful in preclinical trials (11). This prompted us to test
whether pharmacologically increasing cholesterol solubility, clearance,
and catabolism can be exploited for the prevention or treatment of
atherosclerosis. 2-Hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (CD) is a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved substance used to solubilize
and entrap numerous lipophilic pharmaceutical agents for therapeutic
delivery in humans (12, 13). Although it has previously been shown that
CD increases cholesterol solubility, promotes the removal of cholesterol
from foam cells in vitro, and initiates anti-inflammatory mechanisms
(14–16), it remains unknown whether CD can exert antiatherogenic
effects in vivo.

 Here, we found that subcutaneous administration of CD pro-
foundly reduced atherogenesis and induced regression of established
atherosclerosis in mouse models. CD augmented dissolution of CCs,
reducing their appearance in lesions. Furthermore, CD increased cho-
lesterol metabolism and liver X receptor (LXR)–dependent cellular re-
programming, which resulted in more efficient reverse cholesterol
transport (RCT) as well as reduced proinflammatory gene expression.
The atheroprotective effect of CD was dependent on LXR expression
in myeloid cells transplanted into LDL receptor (LDLR)–deficient mice.
These studies suggest that CD mediates atheroprotection by increasing
production of oxysterols and LXR-dependent cellular reprogramming
and provide preclinical evidence that CD could be developed into an
effective therapy for atherosclerosis in humans.
RESULTS
CD treatment impairs atherogenesis
To investigate the efficacy of CD treatment in murine atherosclerosis,
apolipoprotein E (ApoE−/−) deficient mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet
and concomitantly treated subcutaneously with CD or vehicle control for
8 weeks. Although plasma cholesterol, the main driver of atherosclerosis,
remained unaffected (Fig. 1A), CD treatment profoundly reduced ather-
osclerotic lesions within the aortic root (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found
reduced amounts of CCs in atherosclerotic plaques of CD-treated mice
as assessed by laser reflection microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D). CD did not
influence weight gain, blood pressure, heart rate, or the number of bone
marrow–derived or circulating sca1/flk1-positive cells (fig. S1, A to E).
Moreover, plasma concentrations of phytosterols, cholestanol, and cho-
lesterol precursors were not influenced by CD treatment, indirectly
showing that CD did not alter enteric cholesterol uptake or overall
endogenous biosynthesis (fig. S1F) (17). CD also did not change the
relative plaque composition, including cellularity and macrophage
content (Fig. 1, E and F). However, the production of aortic reactive
oxygen species (Fig. 1G) and plasma concentrations of proinflammatory
cytokines were reduced by CD treatment (Fig. 1, H to J), suggesting that
CD may reduce the inflammatory response during atherogenesis.
CD treatment mediates regression
of atherosclerotic plaques
Although continuous drug administration in parallel to Western diet
feeding of mice is a standard protocol to investigate potential athero-
protective substances (18), patients are generally not treated in early
stages of atherogenesis. Therefore, we tested the effect of CD treatment
on atherosclerosis regression. ApoE−/− mice are hypercholesterolemic
even on normal or lipid-reduced chow, and thus, most murine ather-
osclerotic regression models rely on interventional strategies that
normalize plasma lipids, such as viral gene transfer, transplantation,

 or infusion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (19). We
adapted a less invasive regression protocol (20) in which ApoE−/− mice
were first fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 8 weeks to induce advanced
atherosclerotic lesions and then switched to a normal chow diet for
another 4 weeks during which CD or vehicle control was administered
(Fig. 2A). As expected, plasma cholesterol concentrations were de-
creased in both groups compared to baseline, but no difference between
control and CD treatment was observed (Fig. 2B and fig. S2A). Al-
though switching to a normal chow diet had no effect on athero-
sclerotic lesion size in vehicle-treated mice, CD treatment resulted
in a regression of atherosclerotic plaques by about 45% (Fig. 2C). Al-
though CC load in lesions was already decreased in vehicle-treated
animals compared to the load before treatment, CC amounts were further
reduced by CD treatment (Fig. 2D). Because patients with cardiovascular
disease often do not adhere to the recommended lifestyle changes,
which include dietary modifications, we next investigated whether
CD treatment can affect atherosclerosis regression during continuous
enteric cholesterol challenge. CD or vehicle treatment was started after
8 weeks of cholesterol-rich diet, which was continued for the entire
12 weeks (Fig. 2E). Although plasma cholesterol and general cholesterol
metabolism were not altered (Fig. 2F and fig. S2B), atherosclerotic
plaque size and CC load were decreased in CD-treated mice on contin-
uous cholesterol-rich diet (Fig. 2, G and H). These data demonstrate
that CD treatment is effective in reducing established plaques.
CD dissolves extra- and intracellular CCs
There are several possibilities to explain the protective effects of CD
treatment on both atherogenesis and established atherosclerosis. Be-
cause CD is known to form soluble inclusion complexes with choles-
terol, thereby enhancing its solubility in aqueous solutions by about
150,000-fold, we tested whether CD increases the solubility of CCs.
Fluorescent CD bound to the surface of CCs (Fig. 3, A and B) and
CD mediated the solubilization of CCs in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3C). To be effective in atherosclerotic plaques, CD must also act on
intracellular CCs. Macrophages rapidly internalized fluorescent CD (Fig.
3D) and concentrated it in intracellular compartments (Fig. 3E). Further-
more, incubation with 10 mM CD, a subtoxic dose (fig. S3), enhanced
the dissolution of intracellular CCs over time (Fig. 3F and fig. S4).
Metabolism of crystal-derived cholesterol is increased by CD
Macrophages within the arterial wall take up excessive amounts of
cholesterol and transform into foam cells, a process that can impair
macrophage function and promote atherogenesis (21). This can be
mimicked in vitro by loading macrophages with CCs (fig. S5). After
uptake of CCs into phagosomes, cholesterol is moved from the lysosome
via the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) transporter to the endoplasmic
reticulum, where acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) acetyltransferase catalyzes
the formation of cholesteryl esters. This mechanism turns excess free
cholesterol, which forms crystals and is cytotoxic, into cholesteryl esters
that can be stored in lipid droplets. A second pathway to metabolize
free cholesterol is the formation of water-soluble oxysterols. Oxysterols
can diffuse across cell membranes and are known to reprogram macro-
phages through activation of LXR, which in turn modulates the inflam-
matory response and supports RCT to HDL (22–24). To study how CD
influences the ability of macrophages to reduce the amount of cholesterol
derived from CCs, we incubated macrophages with CCs prepared from
D6-cholesterol (D6-CCs) and followed D6-cholesterol metabolism
products in cells and cellular supernatants by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry selective ion monitoring (GC-MS-SIM) (Fig. 4A). This
analysis revealed that CD treatment promoted esterification of crystal-
derived D6-cholesterol (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, CD amplified D6-cholesterol
concentrations in supernatants while reducing the overall cellular pool
of D6-cholesterol (Fig. 4C). Hence, CD treatment increased the cho-
lesterol efflux capacity of macrophages, which represents an important
protective factor in patients with coronary artery disease (25, 26).
Active cholesterol transport is mediated primarily by the adenosine
5′-triphosphate–binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1
and ABCG1), which transfer free cholesterol to ApoA1 and mature
HDL particles, respectively (27). In line with the observed increase
in cholesterol efflux capacity, macrophages incubated with CCs had
increased expression of both ABCA1 and ABCG1, which was even
further enhanced by CD treatment (Fig. 4, D to F). Genes involved
in driving cholesterol efflux, including Abca1 and Abcg1, are under
the control of the LXR/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) transcription
apparatus (22, 28). Because the transcriptional activities of LXRs are
positively regulated by oxysterols, we next analyzed whether CD can
potentiate cholesterol oxidation. We found that CD treatment of
D6-CC–loaded macrophages resulted in a marked 15-fold increase in

 D6-cholesterol–derived 27-hydroxycholesterol (D5-27-hydroxycholesterol)
(Fig. 4G), although the expression of Cyp27a1 was not altered (fig. S6).
Unexpectedly, CD also increased 27-hydroxycholesterol production
and secretion from macrophages under normocholesterolemic condi-
tions, meaning macrophages not treated with D6-CCs (Fig. 4H). Hence,
CD increases the metabolism of free cholesterol and could thereby
lower the potential for its phase transition into crystals.
CD induces LXR target gene expression in macrophages
The drastic CD-mediated increase in oxysterol production upon D6-CC
loading and the unanticipated finding that CD can increase oxysterols
in normocholesterolemic macrophages prompted us to comprehensively
investigate whether CD influences the expression profiles of LXR-
regulated genes. Wild-type or LXRa−/−b−/− macrophages were ex-
posed to CD, CC, or CC and CD, and gene expression was assessed
by genome-wide mRNA profiling. To investigate whether CD changes
LXR target gene expression in macrophages, we performed gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) (29) with a set of 533 of previously iden-
tified LXR target genes (30) (Fig. 5A and table S1). Enrichment of LXR
target gene sets was identified when wild-type macrophages were
incubated with CCs (Fig. 5B), presumably because of cholesterol over-
loading of macrophages. Consistent with the strong induction of CC-
derived 27-hydroxycholesterol and the observed increase in cholesterol
efflux by CD, LXR target gene sets were enriched when CD was added
together with CCs (Fig. 5B). CD treatment alone also resulted in LXR
gene set enrichment under normocholesterolemic conditions, which
correlates with the observed induction of cellular 27-hydroxycholesterol
(Fig. 4H). In LXRa−/−b−/− macrophages, none of the conditions resulted
in significant enrichments of LXR target gene sets (Fig. 5C). Further-
more, these findings could be confirmed for the key LXR target genes

CD increases in vivo RCT
To test whether CD-induced LXR reprogramming of macrophages im-
proves macrophage cholesterol efflux in vivo, bone marrow–derived
macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type or LXRa−/−b−/− mice were loaded
with D6-CCs ex vivo and injected into the peritoneum of wild-type mice.
The mice carrying crystal-loaded macrophages were then treated with CD
orvehiclecontrol,andD6-cholesterolexcretionintothefecesandurinewas
monitoredbyGC-MS-SIM(Fig.6A). CDincreasedRCTofcrystal-derived
D6-cholesterol from wild-type and, to a lower extent, LXRa−/−b−/− macro-
phages (Fig. 6B). Of note, CD treatment not only induced D6-cholesterol
excretion into the feces but also promoted urinary D6-cholesterol elimina-
tion (Fig. 6C), a process that is normally not observed during RCT. Prior
work on NPC disease, a rare genetic disorder in which cholesterol cannot
escapethelysosome,hasshownthatCDcanmobilizelysosomalcholesterol
and activate LXR-dependent gene expression (32, 33). NPC1-deficient
patients receive weekly injections of CD with the aim of overcoming this
cholesterol transport defect. To investigate whether CDcan also stimulate
urinary cholesterol excretion in humans, we monitored urinary choles-
terol excretion of patients with NPC1 mutations after CD infusion over
time. CD, which is primarily excreted through the urinary tract, resulted
in a time-dependent cholesterol excretion into the urine (Fig. 6D). These
data suggest that CD enhances in vivo RCT from macrophages, partially
in an LXR-dependent manner, but can also directly extract and transport
cholesterol for excretion.
CD modifies human plaque cholesterol metabolism and
gene expression
To test whether the protective functions of CD on murine macrophages
are also exerted in human atherosclerotic plaques, we next performed
lipid and genomic analyses on biopsy specimens obtained from carotid
endarterectomies (Fig. 7A). Comparable to our findings in murine

Fig. 4. CD mediates metabolism and efflux of crystal-derived cholesterol.
(A) Macrophages loaded with CCs prepared from D6-cholesterol (D6-CC) can
reduce the amount of free, crystal-derived D6-cholesterol by three main
mechanisms. First, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT-1) can catalyze the
formation of D6-cholesteryl esters, the storage form of cholesterol, which are
deposited in lipid droplets. Second, the mitochondrial enzyme 27-hydroxylase
(Cyp27A1) can catalyze the formation of D5-27-hydroxycholesterol, which can
passively diffuse across cell membranes. Third, D5-27-hydroxycholesterol is a
potent activator of LXR transcription factors, which in turn mediate the up-
regulation of the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. (B and C)

 macrophages,incubationofhumanatheroscleroticplaqueswithCDresulted
in a transfer of cholesterol from plaques to supernatants (Fig. 7B). More-
over, we observed an increase in the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol,
which was mainly released into the supernatants of the CD-treated pla-
ques (Fig. 7C). Gene expression profiling of a large panel of human
immunology–related genes and selected LXR target genes (table S3) was
performed in resting or treated plaque tissue. These gene expression
data were analyzed by several bioinformatics approaches. First, we per-
formed gene ontology enrichment analysis (GOEA) using the genes dif-
ferentially expressed (DE) after treatment with CD or vehicle control.
Consistent with our lipid results, we found that genes involved in lipid
transport, storage, metabolism, and efflux were up-regulated upon CD
exposure. Conversely, genes known to regulate immune responses, repre-
sented by terms such as “regulation of immune responses in lympho-
cytes,” “regulation of leukocyte-mediated immunity,” or “interleukin
response, T cell, and natural killer cell regulation,” were down-regulated
afterCDtreatment(Fig.7D).FurtherinterrogationoftheGOEArevealed
that CD treatment of human plaques affected many key genes in the GO
term “regulation of inflammatory response” (GO:0050727). These in-
cluded innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2,
3,4,7,and9;theTLRadapterMyD88;theinflammasomesensorNLRP3;
and the inflammasome-dependent proinflammatory cytokines inter-
leukin-1b (IL-1b) and IL-18 (Fig. 7E). Because we observed that CD
increased the endogenous LXR agonist 27-hydroxycholesterol, we next
analyzed whether CD regulates the expression of LXR target genes in
human atherosclerotic plaques. GSEA revealed an enrichment of LXR
target genes after CD treatment when compared to control-treated pla-
ques (Fig. 7F and table S2). Additionally, many LXR target genes were
found among the most DE genes (Fig. 7G, red or blue gene labels). Of
note, the inflammasome sensor NLRP3 and the inflammasome inhibi-
tor HSP90 (34) are bothLXRtargetgenes(24) andCDtreatment resulted
in NLRP3 down-regulation and an up-regulation of HSP90 when com-
pared to control (Fig. 7H). Together, these data show that CD activates
LXR-dependent transcriptional programs in human plaques, influenc-
ing both cholesterol transport and several inflammatory processes,
which are relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

 Atheroprotection by CD is LXR-dependent
We next tested whether the CD-mediated effects in isolated macro-
phages in vitro– or in ex vivo–treated human plaque material reflect
the atheroprotective effects of CD in mice. Because CD treatment
lowered the systemic concentrations of LXR-modulated cytokines
[IL-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor–a (TNF-a)] (Fig. 1, H to J)
and also resulted in increased Abca1 and Abcg1 mRNA in the aortic
arches of ApoE−/− mice fed a cholesterol-rich diet (fig. S7), we determined
whether CD-mediated atheroprotection in vivo requires LXR activation
and cholesterol efflux from macrophages through ABCA1 and ABCG1.
We therefore transplanted wild-type, LXRa−/−b−/−, or macrophage-specific
ABCA1 and ABCG1 knockout (MAC-ABCDKO) bone marrow into
irradiated LDLR−/− mice. After bone marrow engraftment, the trans-
planted mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet and were concomitantly
treated with CD or vehicle control for 8 weeks. CD treatment did not
influence plasma cholesterol concentrations in the different transplant
groups (Fig. 8, A to C). The lipoprotein profiles also remained un-
changed, except that CD treatment slightly decreased the amount of
HDL in LDLR−/− mice transplanted with MAC-ABCDKO bone marrow
(fig. S8). LDLR−/− mice carrying wild-type bone marrow showed re-
duced atherosclerotic plaque size, demonstrating that CD is also effec-
tive in the LDLR−/− model of atherosclerosis (Fig. 8D). Of note, CD
treatment did not influence lesion development in LDLR−/− mice
carrying LXRa−/−b−/− bone marrow, highlighting that LXR agonism
is critical for CD-mediated atheroprotection (Fig. 8E). In contrast, de-
ficiency of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in macrophages did not influence the
effectiveness of CD treatment (Fig. 8F), suggesting that CD can bypass
these cholesterol efflux pathways.
To better understand how CD-dependent LXR agonism can amelio-
rate atherosclerosis, we performed agenome-wide gene expression anal-
ysis on aortic tissue from LDLR−/− mice transplanted with wild-type or
LXRa−/−b−/−bonemarrow.GOEAofDEgenesdemonstratedthatimpor-
tant pathways involved in atherogenesis, including lipid metabolism and
inflammation, were regulated by CD treatment in an LXR-dependent
manner (Fig. 8G). Similar to our studies on human plaques, LXR target
genes were found among the top DE genes upon CD treatment (Fig. 8H).
Moreover, we confirmed our observation from human plaques that CD
promoted up-regulation of the NLRP3 inhibitor Hsp90aa1 and down-
regulationofNLRP3inflammasomegenesinanLXR-dependentmanner
(Fig. 8I). Together, these data suggest that the CD-mediated athero-
protection observed in murine atherosclerosis is dependent on LXR
activation and that CD exerts multiple anti-inflammatory effects in ath-
erosclerotic plaques.
DISCUSSION
Here, we tested the hypothesis that increasing the solubility of cholesterol
by pharmacological means can have beneficial effects on diet-induced
atherosclerosis. The large effect observed and the unexpected ability of
CD to promote regression of established atherosclerosis even under the
extreme hypercholesterolemic conditions observed during a cholesterol-
rich diet cannot be explained by simple mass action of CD alone. The
results from the lipid and genomic discovery approaches combined with
in vivo studies in gene-deficient mice suggest that CD exerts its potent
effect mainly by reprogramming cells in atherosclerotic plaques. By
increasing the amount of endogenous LXR ligands, CD acts akin to a pro-
drug except that it is not metabolized itself but rather promotes the me-
tabolism of its cargo cholesterol into pharmacologically active metabolites.
It appears that transitory changes in cholesterol metabolism and
inflammatory pathways are linked and that the activity of LXR is a
key rheostat in this system. For example, innate immune activation by
microbial components or the acute-phase response can suppress the ex-
pression of LXR target genes, such as ABCA1 and ABCG1, causing cho-
lesterol retention, which can augment an inflammatory reaction in
various ways (35, 36). It is conceivable that this type of innate immune
amplification could be part of an evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial
defense mechanism (23). The resulting cholesterol accumulation increases
LXR agonists, which in turn can counterbalance the inflammatory re-
sponse and increase cholesterol efflux, restoring cholesterol and immune
homeostasis. However, because of the overabundance of proinflamma-
tory dietary factors and an excess of cholesterol, this balance may be
shifted toward chronic inflammation and cholesterol retention, which
drive atherogenesis. By promoting cholesterol solubility, enhancing LXR
activity, and mobilizing cholesterol efflux, CD could therefore normal-
ize both cholesterol and immune homeostasis in the vasculature.
The effect of CD on macrophages resembles that of the antiathero-
genic factor HDL. HDL relieves cells of excess cholesterol through
ABC transporters; in addition, HDL can have marked anti-inflammatory

 effects on macrophages (37). However, HDL does not activate LXR
but increases the expression of activating transcription factor 3, a
key repressor of innate immune pathways (37). In contrast, although
CD has the ability to increase HDL-mediated RCT, it can also mobilize
cholesterol for direct excretion into the urine and feces. These data sug-
gest that CD can bypass ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated active choles-
terol efflux. Consistent with these observations, our bone marrow
transplantation studies indicate that the atheroprotective effects of
CD are independent of the active cholesterol efflux process mediated
by ABCA1 and ABCG1. This is in line with recent findings demonstrating
that synthetic LXR agonists mediate atheroprotection independent of mac-
rophage ABCA1 and ABCG1 (38).
There are several limitations to our study. First, although our data
demonstrate that CD promotes LXR activation in plaque macro-
phages and that LXR is required in myeloid cells for CD-mediated
atheroprotection, we cannot exclude other unidentified pathways. It
is likely that CD-mediated atheroprotection is multifactorial and that
the differential effects of CD such as physically increasing cholesterol
solubility and promoting cholesterol metabolism and efflux in macro-
phages, as well as its anti-inflammatory properties, cannot easily be iso-
lated. Second, although our data identified 27-hydroxycholesterol as the
primary LXR agonist upon CD treatment, other endogenous oxysterols
may also contribute to LXR activation. In this context, the functional
activity of regulatory enzymes such as Cyp27A1 and the differential ef-
fects in specific cell types would be interesting. Third, although our ex
vivo experiments with carotid artery plaques suggest that CD can in-
duce atheroprotective pathways in human disease, specific clinical trials
are necessary to validate these findings.
Preclinical models showing the effectiveness of LXR agonism in
preventing murine atherosclerosis (39) and promoting atherosclerosis
regression (40) provided promising prospects for clinical use of LXR
agonists in atherosclerosis treatment, but the progression of therapeutic
molecules into the clinic was hampered by liver toxicity and lipogenic
effects (41). CD, on the other hand, is already in clinical use in humans
for the delivery of lipophilic drugs and has not shown relevant toxicity.
Hence, repurposing CD for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis
would be feasible. Our studies provide a proof of principle that therapies
aimed at increasing the solubility and removal of macrophage cholesterol
could be an effective strategy for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
