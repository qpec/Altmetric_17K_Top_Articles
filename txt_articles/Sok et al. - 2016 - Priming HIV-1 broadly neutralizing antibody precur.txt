A major obstacle to a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)–based HIV vaccine is the
activation of appropriate B cell precursors. Germline-targeting immunogens must be capable
of priming rare bnAb precursors in the physiological setting. We tested the ability of the
VRC01-class bnAb germline-targeting immunogen eOD-GT8 60mer (60-subunit self-assembling
nanoparticle) to activate appropriate precursors in mice transgenic for human immunoglobulin
(Ig) loci. Despite an average frequency of, at most, about one VRC01-class precursor per
mouse, we found that at least 29% of singly immunized mice produced a VRC01-class
memory response, suggesting that priming generally succeeded when at least one precursor
was present. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using germline targeting to prime
specific and exceedingly rare bnAb-precursor B cells within a humanlike repertoire.
I
t is widely thought that vaccine elicitation
of sustained levels of potent broadly neutral-
izing antibodies (bnAbs) may protect humans
against HIV (1, 2). HIV bnAbs from natural in-
fection show extensive somatic mutation (1–9),
and this maturation is required for cross-reactivity
to diverse isolates: bnAb inferred-germline var-
iants typically show detectable affinity for few if
any HIV envelope protein (Env) antigens tested
(3–5, 7, 10–21). Most wild-type Env proteins are
therefore poor immunogens to prime bnAb re-
sponses (3–5, 17, 22, 23). Reliable vaccine ini-
tiation of bnAb responses will likely require
design or discovery of “germline-targeting” priming
immunogens with appreciable affinity for bnAb
germline precursors (3–5, 10, 11, 17, 22–29). Fur-
thermore, consistent bnAb priming may only be
possible for bnAb precursors present at reasonable
frequency in all or most vaccine recipients (27).
Proof of principle that a germline-targeting im-
munogen canprime relatively rare bnAb-precursor
B cells was shown with the eOD-GT8 60-subunit
self-assembling nanoparticle (60mer) that targets
precursors of CD4–binding- site–directed VRC01-
class bnAbs (26). VRC01-class precursors are de-
fined by their use of a heavy-chain VH1-2*02 (or
*03 or *04) gene and light chains with unusually
shortcomplementarity-determiningregion3(CDR3)
loops of five amino acids (5, 30–32). In a trans-
genicmousemodelexpressingthegermline-reverted
VRC01 heavy chain paired with wild-type mouse
light chains (VRC01 gH mouse), in which the fre-
quency of VRC01-class precursor B cells was esti-
mated to be higher than in humans by a factor of
as little as ~5, a single immunization with eOD-
GT8 60mer activated VRC01-class precursors and
generatedVRC01-classmemoryresponsesinnearly
all immunized mice, whereas control immunogens
presenting a native CD4 binding site failed to
activate such precursors (26). The eOD-GT8 60mer
activated target precursors less robustly in a dif-
ferent VRC01-class inferred-germline heavy-chain
transgenic mouse (25). Several properties of both
mouse models lowered the bar for germline tar-
geting compared to the challenges confronted in a
human: elevated bnAb precursor frequency, re-
duced competition from other B cell specificities,
limited diversity of bnAb precursors owing to their
uniform recombined heavy chains, and an affinity
advantage conferred on bnAb precursors due to
their mature H-CDR3s.
To better model the conditions for initiation
of a VRC01-class bnAb response in humans, we
investigated immunization with eOD-GT8 60mer
in Kymab mice transgenic for the complete un-
rearranged human antibody germline gene rep-
ertoire (33). Kymab mice contain human heavy
chains paired with either human kappa light
chains (HK mice) or human lambda light chains
(HL mice), or both (HKL mice). To determine the
level of difficulty for VRC01-class bnAb priming
in Kymab mice, we first measured the frequency

 of VRC01-class precursors in the above mouse
strains. Using B cell sorting methods, we previ-
ously detected eOD-GT8–specific VRC01-class pre-
cursors at a frequency of 1 in 2.4 million among
human naïve B cells expressing kappa light chains
(27). Using similar methods to probe a total of
~300 million naïve B cells from the spleens and
lymph nodes of unimmunized HK and HL mice
(n = 3 each), we were unable to isolate any VRC01-
class B cells, suggesting that the frequency of such
B cells was considerably lower than in humans.
The frequency of the VH1-2*02, *03, or *04 alleles
among HK B cells was previously measured as
0.9% (33, 34), lower than the frequency in hu-
mans (2.9 ± 1.3%) (fig. S1) (35, 36) by a factor
of only ~3. Therefore, to explain the reduced
frequency of VRC01-class B cells in Kymab mice,
we analyzed the light-chain variable gene (VL)
usage and CDR3 length distributions from immu-
noglobulin M–positive (IgM+) or IgG+ B cells for
five HK mice and four healthy humans by next-
generation sequencing (NGS) (37). The kappa
light chain–CDR3 (L-CDR3) length distributions
were broadly similar in HK mice and humans
(Fig. 1A), but the frequency of five–amino acid
L-CDR3s was lower in HK mice (0.018 ± 0.013%)
than in humans (0.95 ± 0.57%) by a factor of ~50
(Fig. 1B). The cumulative frequency of Vk genes
used by known VRC01-class bnAbs [IGVK3-20,
IGVK1-33, and IGVK3-15 (32, 38)] was 24.0 ± 3.5%
in HK mice, similar to the 23.2 ± 4.9% that we
measured in humans (Fig. 1C). However, the fre-
quency of five–amino acid L-CDR3s associated
with known VRC01-class kappa chains was re-
duced by a factor of ~300 in HK mice (0.00089 ±
0.00079%) compared to humans (0.27 ± 0.13%)
(Fig. 1D). Restricting the analysis to light chains
with five or fewer VL nucleotide mutations pro-
duced similar conclusions (fig. S2). Whatever the
cause, our data indicate that VRC01-class precur-
sors are less frequent in HK mice than in humans
by a factor of 150 to 900.
Although we previously detected eOD-GT8–
specific VRC01-class precursors at a frequency of
1 in 2.4 million naïve human kappa light-chain B
cells, by correcting for cell sorter and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) losses, we estimated the true
frequency as 1 in 400,000 (27). Based on this num-
ber and the calculations above, we conclude that
the frequency of VRC01-class precursors in HK
mice is unlikely to be higher than 1 in 60 million
(=150 × 400,000) B cells and might be as low
as 1 in 360 million (=900 × 400,000) B cells. The
spleens of HK and HL mice (7 to 18 weeks of age)
contain 50 million B220+ B cells, of which ~60%
are mature B cells (33) that are thought prepared
to respond to antigen. By also accounting for the
lymph nodes and periphery, we estimate that
each mouse contains ~75 million B cells, of which
45 million are mature. Thus, we expect a very low
average frequency of 0.2 (≈75/360) to 1.3 (≈75/60)
eOD-GT8–specific VRC01-class precursors per HK
mouse at any given time. Modeling the number of
precursors per mouse with Poisson distributions
predicts that 27 to 82% of HK mice will have zero
precursors and the remainder one to four precur-
sors (Fig. 1E). Thus, priming VRC01-class responses
in HK mice appears substantially more difficult
than in humans, as the precursor frequency is
lower (by a factor of 150 to 900) and the number
of precursors per individual is lower [by 3000
to 30,000 precursors (27)]. Frequency analysis in
one HL mouse and two HKL mice reached similar
conclusions that were only slightly more favor-
able for VRC01-class priming (table S1).
We conducted immunization experiments to
determine if eOD-GT8 60mer could prime rare
VRC01-class precursors in Kymab mice. Our first
experiment (Fig. 2A), in both HK and HL mice
(28 mice each), evaluated differences in antigen
dose (20 versus 4 mg), adjuvant formulation, and
route (Iscomatrix/subcutaneous versus Sigma Ad-
juvant system, also known as “Ribi”/intraperitoneal),
and time point of analysis (14 days versus 42 days
after immunization). Unimmunized mice (three
HK and three HL) and mice immunized with
20 mg of non–germline-targeting eOD-17 60mer
in Iscomatrix were controls. Serum enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay showed robust responses to
eOD-GT8 [endpoint titers of (1 to 5) × 10−5 and
half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of (5 to
13) × 10−4 at day 42] and lower responses to eOD-
GT8 KO (fig. S3), a mutant with reduced binding
to VRC01-class antibodies (26), indicating epitope-
specific responses (fig. S4) (37). Spleens and lymph
nodes from culled mice were processed, stained,
and single-cell sorted for IgM–/IgD– memory
B cells that bound to eOD-GT8 tetramers but not
to eOD-GT8 KO tetramers (27, 37). Only eOD-
GT8 60mer-immunized mice showed evidence of
epitope-specific (eOD-GT8+/eOD-GT8 KO–) mem-
ory B cells (Fig. 2B). A control sort of eOD-17 60mer-
immunized samples with eOD-17/eOD-17-KO probes
identified memory B cells reactive with eOD-17 but
not eOD-GT8.
We performed a second experiment (Fig. 2A),
in HK and HKL mice, with eOD-GT8 60mer,
eOD-17 60mer, the native-like trimer BG505
SOSIP (39–44), and eOD-GT8 d41m3 60mer, a
variant of eOD-GT8 60mer with disulfide stabi-
lization and modification of the underlying nano-
particle (fig. S5). The results for eOD-GT8 d41m3
60mer are combined with those of eOD-GT8
60mer, as the two were indistinguishable (fig.
S6). Although epitope-specific memory B cell
frequencies were slightly (factor of ~3) lower
in the second experiment, potentially because of
sorting with a different eOD-GT8 KO bait [eOD-
GT8 KO2 (fig. S3)], comparison of frequencies
between groups (Fig. 2C) supported the findings
from the first experiment (Fig. 2B).

 60mer immunization contained VRC01-class mem-
ory B cells, RNA from single eOD-GT8+/eOD-
GT8 KO– sorted memory B cells was reverse
transcribed and IgG variable genes were ampli-
fied and sequenced by NGS (37). The two exper-
iments yielded a total of 10,816 wells from which
unique heavy- and/or light-chain nucleotide se-
quences could be determined, and of these, 3122
wells contained a heavy- and light-chain pair
(2526 pairs for eOD-GT8 60mer-immunized mice,
537 pairs for control-immunized mice, and 59 pairs
for unimmunized mice) (Fig. 3A and tables S2
to S4). From these sequences, we identified 28
nucleotide-unique (26 amino acid–unique) VRC01-
class heavy-light paired memory responses among
29% (17 of 58) of eOD-GT8 60mer-immunized
mice (aggregating across different doses, adju-
vants, time points, types of mice, and the two
experiments) (Fig. 3B, fig. S7, and table S5). In
contrast, we detected no VRC01-class responses
from 32 control mice. eOD-GT8 60mer–induced
VRC01-class responses were found at approx-
imately similar frequencies in HK, HL, and HKL
mice (Fig. 3C).
Whereas only 21% (28/136) of paired sequences
with VH1-2*04 heavy chains had L-CDR3s of five
amino acids, 88% (28/32) of paired sequences with
a five–amino acid L-CDR3 included a VH1-2*04
heavy chain (Fig. 3A), suggesting that five–amino
acid L-CDR3s in memory B cells may serve as
a proxy for VRC01-like responses. Therefore,
we examined the frequency of five–amino acid
L-CDR3s among all paired and unpaired light-
chain sequences. We identified 62 light chains
with 5-amino acid L-CDR3s from 48% (28 out
of 58) of eOD-GT8 60mer-immunized mice,
whereas we found no five–amino acid L-CDR3s
among control mice (Fig. 3, A and D). eOD-GT8
60mer induced memory B cells with five–amino
acid L-CDR3s at substantial frequencies in all
three types of mice (Fig. 3E). All combinations
of dose, adjuvant, and time point produced
VRC01-class responses and five–amino acid L-CDR3
responses (fig. S8). Given the very low frequency
of VRC01-class precursors, these results indicate
that VRC01-class priming by eOD-GT8 60mer
was highly efficient and may have succeeded in
all or most mice in which at least one precursor
was present.
The VRC01-class antibodies induced by eOD-
GT8 60mer shared other characteristic features
of VRC01-class bnAbs in addition to the VH1-2
alleles and five–amino acid L-CDR3. The L-CDR3
is a key site of affinity maturation in VRC01-class
bnAbs (32), and the 28 VRC01-class antibodies
showed clear signs of selection toward bnAb se-
quences in both kappa and lambda L-CDR3
(Fig. 3F). In addition, 21 of 28 VRC01-class pairs had
L-CDR1 lengths matching those of the germline
VL genes of known VRC01-class bnAbs (Fig. 3G)
(32). Further, 18 of these 28 antibodies used known
VRC01-class VL genes (Fig. 3H), and the H-CDR3
lengths among the VRC01-class pairs (9 to 16
amino acids) were similar to those of known
VRC01-class bnAbs (12 to 18 amino acids) (Fig. 3I).
Consistent with a VRC01-class binding mode,
all 20 VRC01-class antibodies that we expressed
bound to eOD-GT8 but had no detectable affinity
for either eOD-GT8 mutant, eOD-GT8 KO, or
eOD-GT8 KO2 (fig. S9). These VRC01-class anti-
bodies had geometric mean (GM) affinity for
eOD-GT8 of 134 nM [geometric standard devi-
ation (GSD), 9.4], a factor of 25 higher than the
geometric mean eOD-GT8 affinities of VRC01-
class antibodies isolated from naïve human B
cells (3.4 mM; GSD, 5.6) (27), possibly due to
maturation of the immunogen-induced anti-
bodies (mean ± SD mutation levels were 0.8 ±
1.1% in VH and 1.5 ± 1.1% in VL). eOD-GT8 60mer-
induced VRC01-class antibodies in the VRC01 gH
mouse had similar mutation levels (VH: 1.3 ±
3.2%; VL:2.1 ± 1.9%) but higher GM affinity for
eOD-GT8 by a factor of 22 (GM, 6.0 nM; GSD,
38.7) (26), probably due at least in part to the

 engineering of eOD-GT8 for ultrahigh affinity
(9 pM) to germline-reverted VRC01 (27). Thus,
the Kymab antibody affinities are likely better
predictors of the affinities of human responses
to a single immunization of eOD-GT8 60mer.
Ultimate elicitation of bnAbs will probably
require sequential boosting with more native-
like epitope variants to select sufficient bnAb-
like mutations (1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 26).
Consistent with this expectation and with results
of eOD-GT8 60mer priming experiments in knock-
in mice (25, 26), the primed VRC01-class anti-
bodies in this study showed no affinity for the
native-like trimer BG505 SOSIP (fig. S10) and
no neutralizing activity against the VRC01-sensitive
HXB2 HIV strain from which eOD-GT8 was derived
(fig. S11). That only ~1% (28/2526) of epitope-specific
antibodies were VRC01-class (Fig. 3A) suggests
that immunofocusing strategies may be needed
to suppress competing responses during boost-
ing (1, 45)—though in humans, the higher VRC01-
class precursor frequency may mitigate this
challenge.
Germline targeting is a promising vaccine
strategy, but developing suitable model systems
to evaluate targeting of human germline B cells
is difficult. Kymab human immunoglobulin loci
transgenic mice offer a more stringent and human-
like model compared to most knock-in mice.
Although Kymab mice underrepresent the fre-
quency of VRC01-class precursor B cells com-
pared to humans and possess an average of at
most 1.3 such precursors per mouse, the eOD-
GT8 60mer still proved capable of priming. The
seemingly high targeting efficiency of eOD-GT8
60mer in this mouse model encourages human
testing wherein the VRC01-class precursor fre-
quency among B cells and the number of pre-
cursors per individual are more favorable for
bnAb priming. The results of this study should
also encourage germline targeting for other bnAbs
with lower human precursor frequencies.
