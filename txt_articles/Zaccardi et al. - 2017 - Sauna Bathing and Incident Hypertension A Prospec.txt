Sauna bathing may have various health benefits including a 
reduced cardiovascular risk. We have previously shown that 
regular sauna bathing could be a protective factor against the 
development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).1 Specifically, 
participants reporting 4 to 7 sauna sessions per week had 
a markedly reduced risk of fatal CVD events compared to 
participants with 1 sauna session per week, independently of 
well-established risk factors as well as several other potential 
confounders. The underlying physiological mechanisms for 
this protective effect, however, are still unknown. Prior stud-
ies have shown that sauna bathing is associated with better 
cardiovascular function2–5 and produces positive short-term 
effects on systemic blood pressure,6 although the long-term 
effects of habitual sauna bathing on the risk of hypertension 
have not been previously investigated.
Tight control of blood pressure is a cornerstone in the 
prevention of CVDs. Recent studies have confirmed the 
importance of blood pressure reduction, suggesting addi-
tional cardiovascular benefits for systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) of less than 120 mm Hg as compared with less than 
140 mm Hg.7 As sauna bathing produces acute vasodilation 
which leads to a significant drop in blood pressure,4 regular 
sauna bathing could potentially result in long-term reduc-
tion of blood pressure. This mechanism may further explain 
the protective effects of sauna bathing on the cardiovascu-
lar system. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether 
sauna bathing was associated with a reduced risk of incident 
hypertension using a long-term prospective cohort study 
comprising of apparently healthy middle-aged Finnish men 
without a history of hypertension at baseline.

BACKGROUND
Sauna bathing is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk, but the 
mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect are not entirely under-
stood. We aimed to assess the relationship between sauna bathing and 
risk of incident hypertension.
METHODS
Frequency of sauna bathing was ascertained using questionnaires in 
the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study, a prospective cohort study 
conducted in Eastern Finland that comprised a population-based sam-
ple of 1,621 men aged 42 to 60 years without hypertension at baseline. 
The incidence of hypertension was defined as a physician diagnosis 
of hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP) >140 mm Hg, diastolic 
blood pressure >90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medication.
RESULTS
During a median follow-up of 24.7 years, 251 incident cases (15.5%) 
were recorded. In Cox regression analysis adjusted for baseline age, 
smoking, body mass index, and SBP; compared to participants reporting 
1 sauna session per week, the hazard ratio for incident hypertension in 
participants reporting 2 to 3 sessions and 4 to 7 sessions was 0.76 (95% 
confidence interval: 0.57–1.02) and 0.54 (0.32–0.91), respectively. The 
corresponding hazard ratios were similar after further adjustment for 
glucose, creatinine, alcohol consumption, heart rate, family history of 
hypertension, socioeconomic status, and cardiorespiratory fitness: 0.83 
(95% confidence interval: 0.59–1.18) and 0.53 (0.28–0.98), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
Regular sauna bathing is associated with reduced risk of hypertension, 
which may be a mechanism underlying the decreased cardiovascular 
risk associated with sauna use. Further epidemiological and experimen-
tal studies could help elucidate the effects of sauna bathing on cardio-
vascular function.

Sauna and Hypertension
METHODS
Study population
The Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease (KIHD) study was 
designed to investigate risk predictors for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular outcomes in a population-based sample of 
men from Eastern Finland. Participants were a randomly 
selected sample of 3,433 men aged 42 to 60 years who resided 
in the town of Kuopio or its surrounding rural communi-
ties.8 Of those invited, 2,682 (83%) participated in the study. 
Participants with baseline hypertension (n = 811), reporting 
no regular sauna bathing (n = 8) or with missing data on 
sauna (n = 242) were excluded, leaving 1,621 participants for 
the analyses. Prevalent hypertension at baseline was defined 
as physician diagnosis of hypertension, SBP >140 mm Hg, 
diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg, or antihypertensive 
therapy.
Men who participated (n = 1,621) were younger (age 
52.9 years vs. 53.3 years, P = 0.029) and their BMI (26.3 vs. 
27.8 kg/m2, P < 0.001), plasma glucose levels (4.7 vs. 4.9 
mmol/l, P < 0.001), socioeconomic status (SES) (8.3 vs. 8.6, 
P = 0.002), proportion with a family history of hypertension 
(42.1 vs. 57.4 %, P = 0.001), alcohol consumption (69.7 vs. 
86.7 grams/week, P = 0.002), and SBP (129.7 vs. 141.0, P < 
0.001) were lower compared with men who were excluded (n 
= 1,061) in the final study analysis. Cardiorespiratory fitness 
as assessed by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) (31.7 vs. 
27.8 ml/kg/min, P < 0.001) was higher among men included 
in the analyses. All other main variables including serum 
creatinine and lipid levels, smoking habits, and resting heart 
rate did not differ statistically significantly. Baseline exami-
nations were conducted between March 1984 and December 
1989. The study was approved by the research ethics com-
mittee of the University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. 
Each participant gave written informed consent. This study 
was performed following the STrengthening the Reporting 
of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-
lines for reporting observational studies in epidemiology 
(Supplementary Appendix).
Assessment of sauna bathing
The characteristics of typical sauna bathing have been pre-
viously reported.1 Briefly, the recommended temperature for 
sauna is usually from 80 °C to 100 °C. The temperature in the 
sauna room was measured using a thermometer located in 
the sauna room and was self-reported. Baseline sauna bath-
ing habits were assessed by self-administrated questionnaires 
based on weekly sauna sessions, duration, and temperature.1 
The questionnaires were checked by an experienced nurse at 
the time of baseline examination.
Assessment of risk factors
Covariates were assessed at baseline. A participant was 
defined as a smoker if he had ever smoked on a regular 
basis. Resting blood pressure was measured between 8:00 
and 10:00 am with a random-zero sphygmomanometer 
using a standardized protocol. After a supine rest of 5 
minutes, blood pressure was measured 3 times in supine 
position, once in standing position, and twice in sitting 
position with 5-minute intervals, and the arithmetic mean 
of all available measurements was taken. The collection of 
blood specimens and the measurement of serum lipids, 
glucose, and creatinine have been described previously.1,9 
Body mass index was computed as the ratio of measured 
weight in kilograms to the square of measured height in 
meters. Alcohol consumption was assessed using the 
Nordic Alcohol Consumption Inventory.9 SES was assessed 
by self-administered questionnaires.1,9 Heart rate from the 
electrocardiogram was recorded at rest.9 Maximal oxygen 
uptake was used as a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, 
which was defined as the highest value or the plateau of 
oxygen uptake10,11 during a standardized cycle testing 
protocol comprising an increase in the workload of 20 W 
per minute with the direct analyses of respiratory gases 
(Medical Graphics, St. Paul, MN).
Ascertainment of incident hypertension
Incident hypertension was ascertained through record 
linkage to 2 sources: (i) the national hospital discharge reg-
istry, and (ii) the Social Insurance Institution of Finland 
register, which contains information on the reimbursement 
of expenses for antihypertensive medication. Hypertension 
was defined as a physician diagnosis of hypertension, SBP 
>140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg, or use of 
antihypertensive medication (beta-blockers, calcium chan-
nel blockers, diuretics, or ACE/angiotensinogen receptor 
antagonists). There were no losses to follow-up.
Statistical analysis
Differences in clinical characteristics according to inci-
dent hypertension events were examined using the analy-
sis of variance and the chi-squared test, as appropriate. 
Descriptive data are presented as mean (SD) and number 
(percentage). Time-to-event analysis was conducted using 
Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association 
of sauna bathing with incident hypertension, after confirm-
ing assumptions of proportionality of hazards which was 
examined by plotting the hazard functions in different cat-
egories of risk factors over time. Participants were divided 
into 3 groups on the basis of the frequency of sauna bathing 
(once, 2–3 times, and 4–7 times per week). Three complete-
case multivariable Cox models were progressively adjusted 
for baseline values of: age, smoking, BMI, and SBP (model 
1); model 1 plus glucose, creatinine, alcohol consumption, 
and resting heart rate (model 2); model 2 plus family history 
of hypertension, SES, and cardiorespiratory fitness (model 
3). These confounders were selected based on their previ-
ously established role as risk factors for hypertension and 
CVD, evidence from previous research, or their potential as 
confounders based on known associations with hyperten-
sion and observed associations with sauna frequency using 
the available data. The linearity assumption was satisfied for 
all continuous variables and it was assessed with Martingale 
residuals for each continuous variable against survival

time. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14.1 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
The mean (SD) age of included subjects was 52.9 (5.2) 
years. Two-thirds of participants reported 2 to 3 sauna ses-
sions per week while 9% of participants reported 4 to 7 
sessions per week. An average duration of a single sauna 
session was 14.4 (7.8, range 2–90) minutes. Comparing 
men using sauna only once per week with those with at 
least 2 sauna sessions per week, the mean duration of a 
single sauna session was 14.4 (8.5) vs. 14.5 (7.6) minutes 
(P = 0.779) and the mean temperature of sauna was 80.9 
(10.9) vs. 78.3 (8.9) °C (P < 0.001). The number of partici-
pants without regular use of sauna was very low (12 men, 
8 without hypertension). With the exception of BMI and 
serum creatinine, other baseline characteristics were not 
significantly different between men who developed hyper-
tension during follow-up and those who did not develop 
hypertension (Table 1). In this male population without 
prevalent hypertension at baseline, mean SBP was 130 (15) 
mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was 84 (10) mm Hg, 
respectively.
Sauna bathing and risk of hypertension
The mean follow-up time to diagnosis of hypertension or 
the end of follow-up was 22.0 years (median 24.7 years, inter-
quartile range 18.4–26.9 years). The number (percentage) of 
new cases of hypertension was 66 (26.3%), 166 (66.1%), and 
19 (7.6%) according to the 3 groups of frequency of sauna 
bathing (once, 2–3, and 4–7 times per week, respectively; 
Table 1). The corresponding numbers for nonincident cases 
were 323 (23.6%), 921 (67.2%), and 126 (9.2%). On adjust-
ment for age, smoking, BMI, and SBP (model 1), the hazard 
ratio for hypertension was 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 
0.57–1.02) for 2–3 sauna bathing sessions per week and 0.54 
(0.32–0.91) for 4–7 sauna bathing sessions per week com-
pared with men reporting 1 sauna bathing session per week 
(Figure 1). Further adjustment for other risk factors (model 
2 and 3) did not materially change the estimates; compared 
with 1 session, 2–3 and 4–7 sauna sessions per week were 
respectively associated with hazard ratios of 0.78 (0.56 to 
1.09) and 0.48 (0.26 to 0.87) for model 2 and 0.83 (0.59 to 
1.18) and 0.53 (0.28 to 0.98) for model 3 (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study of Finnish middle-
aged men without a history of hypertension at baseline, we 
found that higher frequency of sauna bathing is independently

Sauna and Hypertension
associated with a lower risk of incident hypertension in a 
dose-response manner. These findings could help elucidate 
the potential mechanisms underlying the long-term reduction 
of cardiovascular mortality associated with sauna bathing.
Clinical implications
Sauna bathing is associated with beneficial physiologic 
changes, most notably reduction in resting blood pressure. 
During a hot sauna session, the blood volume to the periph-
ery and skin is increased and the heart rate increases so that 
the blood pressure in internal organs can be maintained. In 
patients with slightly elevated blood pressure, a single sauna 
session produces positive effects on systemic blood pressure, 
including 24-hour blood pressure levels.12 Heat therapy such 
as hot water immersion is associated with several health 
benefits including lower levels of resting blood pressure and 
decrease in peripheral resistance potentially reducing the 
risk of CVD.13 In this study, sauna bathing was employed 
as the mode of heat therapy. Further studies are needed to 
show if other kinds of heat therapies can produce similar risk 
reductions in hypertension and CVD as recent epidemiolog-
ical evidence is based on traditional Finnish sauna use only. 
Consistent with these findings, there is some evidence indi-
cating that blood pressure levels are lower among those who 
live in warm conditions based on ambient temperatures.14
Mechanisms
Regular sauna bathing may have beneficial effects on the 
cardiovascular system such as blood pressure reduction via 
a number of potential mechanisms. Firstly, repeated sauna 
sessions improve vascular endothelial function in patients 
at high CVD risk, suggesting a beneficial role of thermal 
therapy on the endothelium.12,15,16 Secondly, sauna bathing 
also affects the autonomic nervous system. A typical Finnish 
sauna session is indeed characterized by warming up in 
the sauna with subsequent cooling and relaxation; this can 
positively modulate the autonomic system and may further 
explain the effects on blood pressure reduction.17,18 Thirdly, 
heart rate may increase up to 100–150 beats per minute dur-
ing sauna bathing session4,19–22 which increases vasodilatation 
and improves function of the vasculature; these are the same 
benefits that are associated with low and moderate intensity 
physical exercise training. However, there is no active func-
tion of skeletal muscles during sauna bathing, which is in 
contrast to the training response experienced during physical 
exercise. Sauna bathing leads to skin sweating-induced body 
fluid loss, which is a physiological response to hot tempera-
ture.23 Taken together, these experimental findings suggest 
a biological plausibility to the inverse association between 
sauna and risk of hypertension. Our findings also suggest 
that the protective effect of sauna bathing on CVD may be 
via the blood pressure lowering effects of regular sauna bath-
ing. Appropriate interventional studies in animal models or 
clinical trials are needed to confirm any causal associations.
Limitations
Our findings on the association between sauna bathing and 
the risk of hypertension cannot be directly applied to other 
types of saunas, all kind of stem rooms or hot tubes; which 
may operate at a lower temperature than a typical Finnish 
sauna. Although we adjusted our analyses for many other 
potential confounders and risk factors for future hypertension 
to test the robustness of our results, the potential for resid-
ual confounding cannot be entirely eliminated. On the other 
hand, the results were carefully adjusted for confounders in 
the association with hypertension, such as BMI, smoking, 
cardiorespiratory fitness, alcohol intake, and SES. Notably,

fitness. Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval.

majority of Finnish people use sauna regularly and access to 
sauna is not limited by socioeconomic background or other 
reasons.1,24 The view of sauna as an indicator of SES is indeed 
stronger and more common in non-Finnish cultures than in 
Finland. Although we accounted for SES, it is not possible 
to exclude completely that sauna is not an indicator of eco-
nomic, familial, or working traits. These results could in part 
be explained by divergent educational background, economic 
facilities, family engagement, professional commitment, or 
“attention” to lifestyle among people reporting different sauna 
use. In the interpretations of our findings, these aspects should 
be considered along with well-known beneficial physiological 
changes of the cardiovascular function. In this study, it was 
not possible to correct for regression dilution bias which may 
have underestimated the associations demonstrated, as we 
had only a 1-time questionnaire-based assessment of sauna 
bathing during a typical week. Sauna bathing habits may have 
changed during follow-up due to probable changes in other 
health habits of participants occurring over the long period of 
observation. It is unlikely that this would have any consider-
able effect on the main findings, given that sauna bathing is a 
tradition and embedded in the culture of the Finnish people. 
Lastly, although sauna bathing seems to be safe and most peo-
ple can tolerate a typical relatively hot and dry sauna (includ-
ing patients with previous CVD),5 it should be noted that 
participants included in this study had resting blood pressure 
ranging within normal limits and were not on antihyperten-
sive medication. Individuals with known orthostatic hypo-
tension should be cautious because of a rapid drop in blood 
pressure, which may occur just after warm sauna bathing.2,25
In conclusions, this study provides prospective evidence that 
sauna bathing is inversely associated with the risk of hyperten-
sion in the general male population and suggests a potential 
mechanism underlying the long-term cardiovascular benefi-
cial effects of sauna bathing. Our current results suggest that 
sauna bathing, an activity that promotes relaxation and well-
being, may be a recommendable habit in the prevention of 
future hypertension. Further studies are needed to confirm our 
results in different population settings, including women, and 
among those who are not familiar to regular sauna bathing.
