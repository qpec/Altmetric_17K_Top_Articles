BACKGROUND: Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that 
significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated 
cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a 
history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary prevention) were prespecified 
for evaluation.
METHODS: The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) 
randomly assigned 10 
142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or 
placebo. The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with 
≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and 
the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior 
cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart 
failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).
RESULTS: Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 
64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration 
of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants 
(N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary prevention 
group compared with the primary prevention group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-
years, P<0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin 
compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority, P=0.02 for superiority) with 
no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (interaction P value=0.18) between the primary 
(HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) 
cohorts. Renal outcomes (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.79 versus HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39–
1.02; interaction P value=0.73) and heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–
0.90 versus HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35–1.15; interaction P value=0.91) were similarly reduced 
in the secondary and primary prevention cohorts, respectively. Lower extremity amputations 
were similarly increased in the secondary and primary prevention cohorts (HR, 2.07; 95% 
CI, 1.43–3.00 versus HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.70–3.29; interaction P value=0.63).
CONCLUSIONS:  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior cardiovascular events 
had higher rates of cardiovascular outcomes compared with the primary prevention 
patients. Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes with no statistical 
evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect across the primary and secondary 
prevention groups. Additional studies will provide further insights into the effects of 
canagliflozin in these patient populations.

P
atients with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffer sub-
stantial morbidity and mortality from cardiovascu-
lar and renal disease.1,2 Current drug therapies and 
lifestyle interventions are not adequate, with elevated 
relative and absolute risks of serious disease outcomes 
observed for both primary and secondary prevention 
cohorts. Although the largest absolute benefits of in-
terventions for individual patients are achieved among 
those with established disease (secondary prevention), 
the large number of patients with diabetes mellitus 
without overt cardiovascular disease (primary preven-
tion) makes knowledge about the effects of therapies 
on first events an additional priority.
The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovas-
cular Assessment Study) was designed to assess the 
cardiovascular safety and efficacy of canagliflozin in 
a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes melli-
tus.3–6 The main results demonstrated that canagliflozin 
reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular death, non-
fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke by 
14% (P=0.02 for superiority) compared with placebo.6 
In addition, hospitalized heart failure and serious de-
clines in renal function were reduced by 33% and 40%, 
respectively.6 An unanticipated ≈2-fold increase in the 
risk of amputation was also observed.
By design, the CANVAS Program enrolled patients 
with and without prior cardiovascular disease to pro-
vide insight into the effects of canagliflozin in the pri-
mary and secondary prevention settings. In the analyses 
presented here, the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin 
are described separately for the primary and secondary 
prevention cohorts enrolled in the CANVAS Program.
METHODS
Data from the CANVAS Program will be made available in 
the public domain via the Yale University Open Data Access 
Project (http://yoda.yale.edu/) once the product and relevant 
indication studied have been approved by regulators in the 
United States and European Union and the study has been 
completed for 18 months. The trial protocols and statistical 
analysis plans were published along with the primary CANVAS 
Program article.6
The design of the CANVAS Program has been published.3–6 
In brief, the CANVAS Program was a double-blind comparison 
of the effects of canagliflozin versus placebo made by com-
bining data from 2 large-scale trials. The CANVAS Program 
was sponsored by Janssen Research & Development, LLC, and 
was conducted as a partnership between Janssen Research 
& Development, LLC, an academic Steering Committee 
(Appendix in the online-only Data Supplement), and an 
Academic Research Organization, George Clinical. The first 
draft of this article was written by the first author, with all coau-
thors contributing comments and approving the final draft for 
submission. The authors had access to all the data and ensured 
the accuracy of the analyses. All participants provided informed 
consent, and ethics approval was obtained for every center.
Participants
The criteria for inclusion and exclusion have been previously 
published.3–6 Participants were men and women with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (glycohemoglobin ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) who 
were either ≥30 years of age with a history of symptomatic ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular events defined as stroke, MI, hospi-
talization for unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, 
percutaneous coronary intervention, peripheral revascularization 
(surgical or percutaneous), and symptomatic with documented 
hemodynamically significant carotid or peripheral vascular dis-
ease or amputation secondary to vascular disease (secondary 
prevention cohort); or ≥50 years of age with no prior cardio-
vascular events but with ≥2 of the following cardiovascular risk 
factors: duration of diabetes mellitus ≥10 years, systolic blood 
pressure >140 mm 
Hg on ≥1 antihypertensive agents, current 
smoker, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria, or high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol <1 mmol/L (primary prevention cohort). 
The primary and secondary prevention participants were cat-
egorized based on a review of their medical histories.
Randomized Treatment
Randomization was performed through a central web-based 
system and used a computer-generated randomization sched-
ule. Participants were assigned to canagliflozin or placebo, and 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Canagliflozin reduces cardiovascular and renal out-
comes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• No statistical evidence of heterogeneity was 
observed for the effects of canagliflozin on cardio-
vascular and renal outcomes in participants with 
prior cardiovascular events (secondary preven-
tion) and without prior cardiovascular events but 
at elevated risk (primary prevention), although the 
power to detect differences was limited.
• Lower extremity amputations were uncommon 
but increased with canagliflozin without statistical 
evidence of heterogeneity between the secondary 
and primary prevention cohorts.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at high 
risk for cardiovascular and renal outcomes.
• Canagliflozin should be considered to manage dia-
betes mellitus in patients at high risk for cardio-
vascular events to reduce cardiovascular and renal 
outcomes.
• Further study of canagliflozin in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus without prior cardiac events is 
needed to better define the benefits on cardio-
vascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke 
outcomes.
• Caution should be used in patients at risk for 
amputations.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE
use of other background therapy for glycemic management and 
other risk factor control was according to best practice instituted 
in line with local guidelines. By design, the secondary prevention 
cohort was to be ≈70% (minimum of 60%) of all patients.
Follow-Up
Follow-up after enrollment was scheduled quarterly for 1 year 
and then every 6 months until the end of the study. Every 
follow-up included inquiry about primary and secondary out-
come events and serious adverse events. Serum creatinine 
measurement with estimated glomerular filtration rate was 
performed at least every 26 weeks.
Outcomes
The efficacy outcomes for these analyses were the composite 
of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke; 
the individual components of the composite; hospitalization 
for heart failure; and all-cause mortality. Effects on the kid-
ney were assessed using a composite renal outcome compris-
ing a 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
requirement for renal replacement therapy, or renal death. 
The safety events of interest were adverse events attributable 
to genital infection, urinary tract infection, volume depletion 
events, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute pancreati-
tis, renal adverse events, thromboembolism, cancer, fracture, 
and lower extremity amputation.
All major cardiovascular events, renal outcomes, and 
deaths as well as selected safety outcomes (diabetic keto-
acidosis, acute pancreatitis, and fracture) were assessed by 
Endpoint Adjudication Committees (Appendix in the online-
only Data Supplement) blinded to therapy. The definitions 
that were used for the clinical events have been published.3–6
Statistical Analysis
Evaluation of outcomes in the primary and secondary preven-
tion participants was prespecified. Rates of cardiovascular dis-
ease, kidney disease, death outcomes, and selected adverse 
events were estimated for active and placebo groups com-
bined. All analyses of the effects of canagliflozin compared 
with placebo on cardiovascular and renal outcomes were 
based on the intention-to-treat principle using all follow-up 
time (on or off study treatment) for all randomized partici-
pants. Safety outcomes were analyzed using an on-treatment 
approach (based on patient time and events accrued while 
on study drug or within 30 days of study drug discontinu-
ation) except for diabetic ketoacidosis, fracture, cancer, and 
amputation outcomes, which were assessed using all follow-
up time (on or off study treatment).
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were estimated for participants assigned to canagliflozin 
versus participants assigned to placebo separately for the 
primary and secondary prevention cohorts. Cardiovascular, 
death, and safety outcomes were analyzed using a stratified 
Cox proportional hazards regression model, with treatment as 
the exploratory variable and study as the stratification factor. 
Renal outcomes were analyzed using a stratified Cox propor-
tional hazards model with treatment and the stage of base-
line chronic kidney disease measured by estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) as the exploratory 
variables and study as the stratification factor. Homogeneity 
of treatment effects across the primary and secondary pre-
vention groups was examined via a test for the treatment-by-
prevention interaction by adding this term and the prevention 
cohort as covariates to the respective Cox proportional haz-
ards model. The risk differences were calculated by subtract-
ing the incidence rate (per 1000 patient-years) with placebo 
from the incidence rate with canagliflozin and multiplying 
by 5 years. Similarly, the CI was estimated by multiplying the 
lower and upper CI values by 5 years. Analyses were under-
taken using SAS version 9.2 and SAS Enterprise Guide ver-
sion 7.11. Analyses were performed by statisticians at Janssen 
with verification by a statistician at George Clinical.
RESULTS
Overall, 10 
142 participants at 667 centers in 30 coun-
tries were enrolled in the CANVAS Program.6 Mean 
follow-up was 188 weeks. Discontinuation of the study 
drug was similar with placebo and canagliflozin in 
the overall population (30% versus 29%) and in the 
secondary prevention (29% versus 30%) and primary 
prevention cohorts (31% versus 28%). Vital status was 
available for 99.6% of patients.6
Primary prevention participants (N = 3486; 34%) were 
younger (63 versus 64 years), were more often female 
(45% versus 31%), and had longer duration of diabetes 
mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary 
prevention participants (N = 6656; 66%). Participants in 
the secondary prevention group had higher use of com-
mon cardiac medications, including statins, β-blockers, 
and antiplatelet agents, as well as insulin, but lower 
use of oral antihyperglycemic agents (Table 1). Within 
each of the primary and secondary prevention cohorts, 
participant characteristics were all well balanced across 
canagliflozin and placebo groups (Table 1).
Risks of Cardiovascular, Renal, Death, 
and Safety Outcomes in the Primary and 
Secondary Prevention Cohorts
Secondary prevention participants had higher rates of 
the primary cardiovascular composite outcome com-
pared with the primary prevention participants (HR, 
2.36; 95% CI, 2.03‒2.74; P<0.001) (Table 2). There 
were also more hospitalizations for heart failure (HR, 
2.64; 95% CI, 1.90‒3.65), more deaths (HR, 1.86; 
95% CI, 1.57‒2.22), and more of the composite renal 
outcome (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.18‒2.06) in the second-
ary prevention compared with the primary prevention 
group. Rates of safety outcomes were not different ex-
cept for lower extremity amputation (HR, 2.85; 95% 
CI, 1.95‒4.16) and volume depletion events (HR, 1.42; 
95% CI, 1.10‒1.83), which were more frequent among 
the secondary prevention participants, and urinary tract 
infection, which was less common in the secondary 
prevention participants (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67‒0.97).

The primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin 
compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-
years; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75‒0.97; P<0.001 for non-
inferiority, P=0.02 for superiority) in the total cohort, 
with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (P=0.18) 
between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74‒1.30) 
and secondary (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72‒0.95) preven-
tion groups (Figure 1). Likewise, no statistical evidence 
of heterogeneity was found between the primary and 
secondary prevention cohorts for hospitalization for 
heart failure, all-cause mortality, and the composite re-
nal outcome (all P values for homogeneity ≥0.10) (Fig-
ure 1). Kaplan-Meier curves for the composite cardio-
vascular outcome, cardiovascular death, hospitalization 
for heart failure, all-cause mortality, and the composite 
renal outcome are shown in Figure 2.

reduction achieved for the primary and secondary pre-
vention participants.
Some large cardiovascular outcome clinical trials in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have included 
primary and secondary prevention cohorts by design 
using various inclusion and exclusion criteria.7–11 How-
ever, others did not include a primary prevention co-
hort.12,13 For the CANVAS Program, the primary pre-
vention cohort included participants ≥50 years of age, 
whereas other programs typically used 40 or 50 years 
of age to define the entry criteria. Compared with tri-
als with primary prevention participants,7–11 the CAN-
VAS Program included a higher proportion in the pri-
mary prevention group (≈35% versus ≈15% to 25%). 
Similar to other programs, cardiovascular event rates 
were lower in the primary prevention participants, 
but there was no evidence of heterogeneity in rela-
tive treatment effects in the primary and secondary 
prevention groups by statistical testing. The design 
and results from the CANVAS Program suggest that 
a broader group of patients has been studied with 
canagliflozin compared with other drugs, including an 
SGLT2 inhibitor.12
The absolute reductions in cardiovascular events with 
canagliflozin were numerically greater in patients in the 
secondary prevention cohort compared with the primary 
prevention cohort. The relative reductions in cardiovas-
cular events, however, showed no statistical evidence of 
heterogeneity between the 2 prevention groups. There 
appeared to be consistent reductions in hospitalization 
for heart failure and renal outcomes in the primary and 
secondary prevention participants, as well as increases 
in amputations in both groups that were numerically 
less frequent than the reductions in cardiovascular and 
renal outcomes. The composite outcome (cardiovascu-
lar death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) was also clearly 
reduced in the secondary prevention population. Al-
though formal statistical testing did not find evidence 
of heterogeneity in the results for this outcome in the 
primary prevention population, more data are required 
because the interaction testing has limited power based 
on the size of the subpopulation. The ongoing CRE-
DENCE study (Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in 
Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evalua-
tion; ClinicalTrials.org; NCT02065791) will provide more 
evidence on the effects of canagliflozin on clinical renal

center Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the 
Incidence of Cardiovascular Events; ClinicalTrials.org; 
 
NCT01730534) will provide additional data regarding 
the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in primary prevention.
The general safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors has been 
well described.6,14 The rates of common adverse events 
in the CANVAS Program were generally similar in partici-
pants in the primary and secondary prevention groups. 
Bone fractures have been reported previously with 
canagliflozin,6,15 and consistent findings were observed 
in the primary and secondary prevention participants 
in the CANVAS Program. The rate of lower extremity 
amputation was ≈3-fold higher in the secondary pre-
vention group compared with the primary prevention 
group. A statistically significant 2-fold increase in lower 
extremity amputation with canagliflozin versus placebo 
was observed in the secondary prevention group, with a 
statistically similar result between canagliflozin and pla-
cebo in the primary prevention group, although only 33 
events were reported in that group. Additional analyses 
of these findings are ongoing to understand the poten-
tial mechanism for amputations with canagliflozin. Until

further information is available, caution should be used 
in patients at risk for amputations.
The balance of cardiovascular and renal benefits 
compared with the major safety event of amputations 
was evaluated by calculating the number of patients 
with events prevented or caused over 5 years for 1000 
treated patients. A favorable profile was observed for 
the overall study population, with 23 fewer cardiovas-
cular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke events; 16 
fewer hospitalizations for heart failure; and 18 fewer 
renal outcomes (40% reduction in estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate, requirement for renal replacement 
therapy, or renal death) occurring in canagliflozin-treat-
ed patients compared with placebo, with an excess of 
15 lower extremity amputations (10 toe or metatarsal, 
5 above the ankle). As expected, numerically more 
events were prevented in the higher risk secondary pre-
vention group compared with the primary prevention 
participants, and in both cohorts the number of excess 
amputation events was numerically lower than the 
number of cardiorenal outcomes that were prevented. 
These data may be helpful to clinicians and patients for 
shared clinical decisions in the management of diabetes 
mellitus to reduce cardiovascular and renal outcomes.
Limitations
These analyses have several limitations. The trial was 
not designed with appropriate statistical power to 
show definitive treatment differences in the outcomes

in primary and secondary prevention participants. The 
primary prevention cohort was smaller, was lower-risk, 
and accrued fewer events than the secondary preven-
tion cohort, and therefore the ability to exclude hetero-
geneity between the primary and secondary prevention 
cohorts is limited. The primary and secondary preven-
tion participants were categorized based on investiga-
tor-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria and were 
not confirmed. We did not screen patients for subclini-
cal atherosclerotic vascular disease in this large inter-
national trial, so patients with asymptomatic cardio-
vascular disease or clinically silent prior cardiovascular 
events could have been included in the primary preven-
tion cohort. We followed participants for ≈3.5 years; 
however, glucose-lowering agents are often used for a 
much longer duration, well beyond the horizon of this 
study. Further study with longer follow-up in a primary 
prevention population could potentially identify more 
long-term benefits because of greater life expectancy.
Conclusions
In the CANVAS Program, which evaluated patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular 
risk, participants with prior cardiovascular events (sec-
ondary prevention) compared with those without prior 
cardiovascular events (primary prevention) had greater 
absolute rates of cardiovascular, renal, and death out-
comes. Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and renal 
outcomes overall, with no statistical evidence of het-
erogeneity of canagliflozin effects between the primary 
and secondary prevention participants.
