Objective Recent evidence suggests the existence 
of a physical activity paradox, with beneficial health 
outcomes associated with leisure time physical activity, 
but detrimental health outcomes for those engaging in 
high level occupational physical activity. This is the first 
quantitative systematic review of evidence regarding the 
association between occupational physical activity and 
all-cause mortality.
Design Systematic review with meta-analysis.
Data source A literature search was performed 
in electronic databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, 
PsycINFO and Cochrane.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We 
screened for peer reviewed articles from prospective 
studies assessing the association of occupational 
physical activity with all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis 
assessed the association of high (compared with low) 
level occupational physical activity with all-cause 
mortality, estimating pooled hazard ratios (HR) (with 
95% CI).
Results 2490 unique articles were screened and 33 
(from 26 studies) were included. Data from 17 studies 
(with 193 696 participants) were used in a meta-
analysis, showing that men with high level occupational 
physical activity had an 18% increased risk of early 
mortality compared with those engaging in low level 
occupational physical activity (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 
1.34). No such association was observed among women, 
for whom instead a tendency for an inverse association 
was found (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01).
Conclusions The results of this review indicate 
detrimental health consequences associated with high 
level occupational physical activity in men, even when 
adjusting for relevant factors (such as leisure time 
physical activity). These findings suggest that research 
and physical activity guidelines may differentiate 
between occupational and leisure time physical activity.
InTRODuCTIOn
Physical activity (PA) is considered an important 
preventive 
behaviour 
for 
non-communicable 
diseases.1–4 Physical inactivity has been estimated 
to account for ~7% of the global health burden,5 
accompanied by considerable economic costs for 
society.6 Based on this knowledge, international 
guidelines encourage people to engage in ≥30 
min 
of at least moderate intensity PA daily.7 Such guide-
lines, however, do not distinguish between occu-
pational, leisure time and transportation related 
domains of PA.
Until recently, the health effects associated with 
different domains of PA were considered to be alike 
and beneficial, as exemplified by a meta-analysis of 
cohort studies published until 20108. Evidence on 
the beneficial health effects of PA started to develop 
in the 1950s, with pioneering studies identifying 
active jobs (among workers of the London public 
transport system9 and San Francisco longshore 
men10) as being associated with a lower risk of 
mortality. Subsequently, traditional PA research has 
primarily focused on leisure time PA and/or total 
PA, and less often on occupational PA.
New evidence, however, suggests a contrast 
between the health effects of leisure time and 
occupational PA,11 12 suggesting a PA paradox.13 
Specifically, while beneficial health outcomes have 
been associated with high level leisure time PA, 
detrimental health consequences have been docu-
mented for high level occupational PA, regarding 
cardiovascular disorders,14–17 sickness absence12 
and mortality.18–21 However, other studies could 
not confirm this, or even showed opposing find-
ings.22–24 If confirmed, such a paradox would 
require revision of current PA public health guide-
lines,7 because meeting current guidelines that fail 
to take the different domains of PA into account 
might not always be health enhancing.
Until now, the possible existence of a PA paradox 
has received little attention, and no systematic 
review has specifically examined the association of 
occupational PA with mortality. Although there is a 
trend towards a reduction of occupational PA over 
the past decades, substantial proportions of the 
global workforce still operate in physically active 
jobs.25 A thorough understanding of the health 
consequences of occupational PA is therefore highly 
important. The aim of this study was to summarise 
evidence from prospective studies regarding the 
association between occupational PA and all-cause 
mortality in a meta-analysis.

Data sources, literature search and study 
selection
This systematic review was a priori registered26 
and was executed according to the PRISMA state-
ment27 guidelines. Systematic searches of the liter-
ature were performed in bibliographic databases 
of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and 
Cochrane, from inception to 20 September 2017, 
with search terms expressing PA, occupational and 
mortality (see online supplementary material 1).

Review
T
wo reviewers (PC and MAH) independently screened all 
potentially relevant titles and abstracts and, if necessary, full text 
articles, for eligibility. In cases of disagreement, consensus was 
reached, possibly by consulting with a third reviewer (AJvdB). 
Articles were included if they met the following criteria: published 
in the English language, description of original research with a 
prospective assessment of the association of occupational PA with 
all-cause mortality in adult workers (ie, aged 18–65 years at the 
time of occupational PA assessment) from a general population 
sample (eg, excluding clinical patient samples). Occupational PA 
assessed by self-report or objective measures (eg, using acceler-
ometers or heart rate monitors) was included. To enable evalua-
tion of occupational PA at the level of the individual worker, we 
excluded studies that did not use self-reports but instead used 
register based job title or occupational class (eg, blue collar vs 
white collar, or manual vs non-manual) to estimate occupational 
PA. Studies with a focus on occupational sedentary behaviour 
(rather than PA) were included only in cases with relevant refer-
ence groups engaging in at least moderate level occupational PA 
(ie, excluding studies assessing various durations of sedentary 
behaviour). Moreover, only studies that sufficiently adjusted 
for relevant factors were included, with sufficiently adjusted 
being defined as adjustment for age and gender, and at least one 
other relevant factor, including socioeconomic (eg, education/
income), lifestyle (eg, smoking, alcohol use or leisure time PA) or 
health related factors (eg, adiposity or blood pressure).
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
We extracted the following: first author and year of publication, 
study name and design (and follow-up period), sample descrip-
tion (number of participants, inclusion/exclusion criteria, per 
cent female, age, country, type of work), adjustment, description 
of occupational PA (method and calendar year of assessment, 
and exposure categories), description of mortality (method of 
assessment and incidence) and effect measures (eg, hazard ratio 
(HR)). T
wo reviewers (PC and MAH) independently extracted 
the relevant data and assessed the risk of bias of the included 
articles. In cases of disagreement, consensus was reached during 
a meeting, and possibly by consulting with a third reviewer 
(AJvdB). In instances where the above mentioned study informa-
tion could not be retrieved from the published articles, respec-
tive authors were asked for additional information.
For risk of bias assessment, we used a previously published and 
often used scoring system28 with 12 criteria related to reporting 
of study methods and results (see online supplementary mate-
rial 2). This scoring system has shown inter-rater agreement in 
individual items, ranging from 60% to 100%. Summary scores 
were calculated (ranging from 0% to 100%) according to the 
published system, with studies scoring >75% considered to be 
of high methodological quality, and hence low risk of bias.
Data analysis
Included studies were described according to their extracted data 
and risk of bias. If multiple articles reported on the same study 
data, only those data from articles with the longest follow-up 
period were used for further quantitative analyses (with longer 
exposure periods expected to be more likely to influence 
mortality than short term exposures).
Quantitative analyses of homogenous studies with sufficient 
overlap in exposure, outcome and sample were performed in a 
meta-analysis, using effect measures from time to event anal-
yses, such as Cox models (typically expressed in HRs).29 Due 
to differences in the definition of occupational PA, during a 
consensus meeting (with authors PC, MAH and AJvdB) categor-
ical occupational PA exposure variables from each study were 
harmonised, classifying them into one of the four PA catego-
ries from the PA continuum (see online supplementary material 
3).30 31 These four PA categories are: occupational sedentary 
behaviour, low level occupational PA, moderate level occupa-
tional PA and high level occupational PA, to which (based on 
postures and energy expenditure) all occupational PA levels 
provided by the original articles were assigned exclusively. For 
example, Etemadi et al's22 four categories of ‘sedentary work’, 
‘standing or occasional walking’, ‘mild increase in heart rate’ and 
‘significant elevation in heart rate’ were categorised as seden-
tary, low, moderate and high occupational PA, respectively. The 
exposures of ‘not active–light’ and ‘moderate–hard’ by Harari 
et al19 were, on the other hand, categorised as low and high 
level occupational PA, respectively. Since we aimed to assess the 
risk of all-cause mortality in highly physically active workers, 
only the high category of occupational PA was compared with 
the low category of occupational PA (as shown in online supple-
mentary material 3). Authors were asked to re-analyse their data 
in cases where information on such a comparison was not avail-
able from the published articles (eg, when the association with 
all-cause mortality was only presented for the high level occupa-
tional PA compared with occupational sedentary behaviour, but 
not compared with low level occupational PA). Also, authors 
from articles in which effect sizes were not stratified by gender 
were asked to provide these additional stratified analyses. 
Authors of three studies provided such extra data (as indicated 
in online supplementary material 6).
Analyses were performed with inverse variance random effects 
models using Review Manager (RevMan, the Cochrane Collab-
oration, Copenhagen) V
.5.3. HRs with 95% CI were reported, 
depicting individual study and pooled associations of high 
(compared with low) level occupational PA with all-cause 
mortality in forest plots. Due to apparent gender differences in 
occupational PA levels32 and physiological responses to PA,33 
analyses were stratified by gender (as stipulated in our a priori 
registered protocol26). Funnel plots were generated to assess 
publication bias.34 Heterogeneity of the findings was assessed 
using I2 statistics and by visual inspection of the forest plots. 
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the association of indi-
vidual study findings on the pooled results, in which we assessed 
whether any particular study influenced the pooled effect size 
by systematically excluding each single study effect sizes, one at 
a time.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted, comparing subgroups 
using χ2 statistics, in which we addressed the following issues. 
First, we tested whether our results were affected by studies that 
did assess relatively healthy study samples (in which the original 
authors excluded participants with certain diseases or those who 
deceased early in the follow-up period) compared with studies 
that did not. Second, we tested whether the choice of the refer-
ence group (ie, sedentary behaviour rather than low level occupa-
tional PA) affected the results in those studies reporting on both 
the comparison of sedentary versus high occupational PA and 
low versus high occupational PA. Sedentary behaviour (defined 
as low intensity activities or sitting30) is known to be conceptu-
ally different from physical inactivity, and has been shown to 
be an (at least partially) independent risk factor for ill health.35 
Thirdly, we tested whether effect sizes differed in studies that 
did adjust for leisure time PA compared with studies that did 
not. According to the a priori registered protocol,26 we aimed 
to assess whether adjustments of relevant other variables (eg, 
smoking or alcohol use) and risk of bias impacted on the overall

REsulTs
A flowchart of the search and selection process is presented 
in figure 1. The literature search generated a total of 3646 
references. After removing duplicates, 2490 unique refer-
ences were screened by their title and abstract, and 174 arti-
cles by full text. Of the latter, 143 were excluded for various 
reasons (see online supplementary material 4), yielding 31 
eligible articles. T

Review
(ranging from 4 to 50 years, mean 19.9). In all studies, mortality 
was ascertained using official national or regional registers, and 
occupational PA exposure was obtained by individual self-re-
port. Calendar year of exposure assessment ranged from 1960 
to 2010. Fifteen studies examined both genders, 10 were limited 
to men and 1 to women. Fifteen studies used a relatively healthy 
sample and 11 a sample representative of health in the general 
population. Only two studies reported on specific working 
populations (ie, industry18 and manufacturing workers56); other 
studies used either a random working population sample or a 
sample holding a range of jobs.
Quantitative analysis
We statistically pooled data from 17 studies (1 
93 
696 partici-
pants).15 16 18–20 22 23 36 40 43 44 50 52 54 Data from three of these 
studies were retrieved after the original authors re-analysed their 
study data on request.36 40 43
Pooled results showed that male workers with high level 
occupational PA had a statistically significant higher mortality 
risk than those engaging in low level occupational PA (HR 
1.18, 95%  
CI 1.05 to 1.34, I2=76%) (figure 2). A non-sig-
nificant tendency for an inverse association was found among 
women (HR 0.90,  95% CI 0.80 to 1.01, I2=0%). Individual 
study data did not substantially influence the pooled effect size 
and/or the heterogeneity of our findings. Visual inspection of 
funnel plots (online supplementary material 7) suggested some 
degree of asymmetry, with larger samples showing lower HRs 
than smaller samples (in particular among men).
Sensitivity analyses showed higher HRs in relatively healthy 
compared with relatively unhealthy populations (online supple-
mentary material 8), with statistically significant subgroup 
differences among men (χ2=4.64, P=0.03, I2=78.5) but not 
women (χ2=3.38, P=0.07; I2=70.4). Associations tended to 
be stronger among studies that adjusted for leisure time PA,

especially among men (HR 1.25, 95% 
CI 1.07 to 1.47, I2=75%) 
compared with studies that did not (HR 1.12, 95% 
CI 0.93 
to 1.34) (online supplementary material 9). Moreover, we 
showed an attenuated (but non-significant subgroup differ-
ence) risk of mortality in men engaging in high level occupa-
tional PA when compared with sedentary behaviour instead 
of low level occupational PA (HR 1.04, 95% 
CI 0.69 to 1.55, 
I2=70% and HR 1.11, 95% 
CI 0.85 to 1.45, I2=85%, respec-
tively) (online supplementary material 10).
Of nine studies not eligible for pooling, two studies did not 
report high level occupational PA at all37 49 and showed a reduced 
mortality risk for moderate compared with low occupational PA 
(HR 0.69, 95% 
CI 0.48 to 1.0037) and no effect for occupational 
standing/walking compared with sitting (HR 0.97, 95% 
CI 0.78 
to 1.19 for men only49). Four studies neither reported on the 
association of high (compared with low) level occupational PA 
with mortality nor were the authors able to provide us with a 
re-analysis of their data.38 39 42 51 T
wo studies did not use any 
time to event analyses,41 48 and one study did not sufficiently 
adjust for potential confounders.46 Some of these studies showed 
(univariate) associations of higher longevity for those engaging 
in high occupational PA compared with low occupational PA 
(HR 0.77, 95% 
CI 0.71 0.8438). Other studies showed high 
intensity occupational PA being associated with an increased risk 
of early mortality (HR 1.10, 95% 
CI 0.73 1.6451), while there 
were also studies showing no clear associations of occupational 
PA with all-cause mortality.48 41
DIsCussIOn
Our meta-analysis of 1 
93 
696 participants showed that men 
engaging in high (compared with low) level occupational PA 
have an 18% increased risk of all-cause mortality, even after 
adjustment for relevant confounders, such as leisure time PA. 
These findings suggest that a PA paradox may exist in male 
workers, with high levels of occupational PA being associated 
with detrimental health consequences, in contrast with the 
existing evidence of beneficial health consequences with 
moderate and/or high level leisure time PA.1–4 This study is the 
first to systematically synthesise the respective epidemiological 
evidence for all-cause mortality. If the observed association is 
causal, then PA guidelines need to differentiate between occu-
pational and leisure time PA because meeting current PA guide-
lines via occupational PA may not provide the intended health 
benefits or even confer a health risk. PA guidelines recommend 
increasing moderate intensity PA up to 300 
min per week.7 
Workers who engage in high level occupational PA are likely to 
exceed this duration. This is particularly important as (despite 
a general trend of a reduction in energy expenditure at work 
over the past decades) a large fraction of the working population 
worldwide is still engaging in high level occupational PA,25 with 
even higher effective workloads for those working in outdoor 
or in insufficiently controlled indoor climate environments.57 
Workers who are active at work are furthermore known to be 
fairly inactive during their leisure time.58 When the empirical 
evidence for the PA paradox is confirmed in more high quality 
studies, specific guidance on the appropriate type of PA and on 
safe levels of occupational PA are needed, especially for physi-
cally active workers.
Our results are consistent with those from studies that have 
classified occupational PA based on job or occupational sector 
(eg, blue collar vs white collar, or manual vs non-manual),59 60 
including studies that were excluded from this review.61–63 These 
studies, in general, showed increased mortality risks for workers 
in physically active (ie, blue collar or manual) jobs and/or from 
low socioeconomic classes compared with workers in inactive 
jobs and/or high socioeconomic classes. This is however in 
contrast with early research on workers of the London public 
transport system9 and San Francisco longshore men.10 Moreover, 
our findings are in contrast with the evidence from studies on 
the association of total PA that show an inverse association of PA 
with all-cause mortality64 65 despite the fact that occupational PA 
contributes a large share to PA in these studies for many workers.
An explanation for the PA paradox may be differences in the 
nature of occupational and leisure time PA.32 High levels of 
occupational PA, commonly reached by tasks involving manual 
handling, repetitive work and prolonged static postures, elevate 
heart rate and blood pressure and are performed over long 
periods of time (often ≥40 
hours/week), with insufficient time 
for recovery. Leisure time PA, on the other hand, typically takes 
place in short moderate or high intensity bouts of predominantly 
aerobic activities, accompanied by much longer recovery periods. 
Because of these differences, occupational and leisure time PA 
are likely to differ in acute and chronic physiological responses. 
For example, it has been shown in a sample of cleaners that, 
even though highly active at work, occupational PA levels did 
not reach intensity levels required to achieve cardiorespiratory 
fitness improvements.66 High level occupational PA can, on the 
other hand, lead to chronic exhaustion and elevated resting 
blood pressure67 and heart rate,68 established risk factors for 
cardiovascular diseases69 70 and haemodynamic phenomena that 
are typically related to suboptimal arterial wall stress, endothe-
lial injury and inflammatory processes, that may ultimately result 
in atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases.56 71
Although these hypothesised mechanisms hold for blue collar 
occupations, involving manual handling, lifting, prolonged 
postures and/or prolonged activity, they may not apply to all high 
level occupational PA jobs. A distinct occupational group is, for 
example, that of the elite athlete, for which the evidence suggests 
they may have a superior longevity, at least when compared 
with the general population.72 Also, the aforementioned mech-
anisms apply mainly to cardiovascular disease and findings 
are in line with studies on cardiovascular health outcomes,11 
although they differ from those on other health outcomes (eg, 
type 2 diabetes,73 and colon and breast cancer74 75). Our findings 
regarding all-cause mortality indicate that the potential detri-
mental effects on cardiovascular health may outweigh the poten-
tial beneficial effects on these other health outcomes. Moreover, 
neither our hypotheses nor the studies described in this review 
addressed other health risks associated with jobs of high occupa-
tional PA, such as fatal work related injuries or illnesses, that are 
relatively prevalent in some occupational sectors (eg, construc-
tion and agriculture).76 Future work should therefore assess the 
role of occupational PA on specific cause of death outcomes.
Another explanation for the association of occupational 
PA with mortality (in men) may be the possibility of residual 
confounding, as high intensity occupational PA is typically prev-
alent among blue collar workers from lower socioeconomic 
positions77 and low socioeconomic status is associated with 
higher mortality.60 However, instead of being a confounder, 
occupational PA may actually be one pathway for the known 
mortality risks associated with low socioeconomic status, and 
adjustment for socioeconomic position would thus constitute 
an over-adjustment, introducing a conservative bias. Socioeco-
nomic position may also exert its effects through other pathways. 
Compared with high socioeconomic position groups, those with 
a lower socioeconomic position are known to live for shorter 
times and in poorer health.60 This may be related to lifestyle (eg,

smoking, diet and leisure time PA) and other factors. Certain 
lifestyle factors may or may not have been sufficiently adjusted 
for in the currently presented data, despite the fact that we only 
included studies that adjusted for a minimum number of relevant 
factors. Moreover, some of these factors might actually be effect 
modifiers or pathway variables, for which interaction or medi-
ation analyses would be more appropriate. These types of anal-
yses have recently been performed with regard to leisure time 
PA71 and should be one focus of future occupational PA research.
The positive association of occupational PA with all-cause 
mortality appears to be present in men but not in women (with 
even a tendency for an inverse association). Men are more likely 
to be involved in physically demanding work than women,32 
causing dissimilar stress on the cardiovascular system according 
to the aforementioned mechanisms. This notion may be rein-
forced by the fact that occupational PA was assessed by self-re-
ports in all studies and the intensity of occupational PA may be 
perceived differently by women than by men. Moreover, the 
differences in jobs performed by men and women may bring 
along a different set of (socioeconomic and associated lifestyle) 
factors, possibly explaining the gender differences found in our 
study. Finally, as it has been shown that men and women respond 
differently to cardiovascular risk factors,78 including PA,33 a 
different response to occupational PA by gender is possible.
Apart from gender differences, the adverse health effect 
appears to be stronger in workers with low compared with high 
cardiorespiratory fitness,17 54 however, due to insufficient data 
we could not statistically test this in a sensitivity analysis. Only 
one study used relative aerobic workload as an occupational PA 
exposure measure that inherently accounts for individual fitness 
level, and this measure was more predictive of mortality than 
exposure assessment by energy expenditure based on metabolic 
equivalents of occupational PA alone in the same study.21 These 
findings suggest that future research on occupational PA needs 
to take individual fitness into account. It also implies that jobs 
need to be designed to meet individual worker capacities and 
that good fitness for those being active at work (possibly by 
being physically active during leisure time) is also important. 
Adverse health effects were also stronger in studies of relatively 
healthy compared with relatively unhealthy study subjects55 
(online supplementary material 8). This finding should not be 
interpreted that those with a relatively good health are more 
vulnerable to the risks of high level occupational PA. Instead, 
this finding is probably due to so-called healthy worker effect, 
a form of selection bias were more healthy subjects select into 
and remain in the most physically strenuous occupations. The 
presence of this effect was demonstrated in one of the reviewed 
studies21 and in a previous study on occupational PA and cardio-
vascular disease incidence.17
When using sedentary behaviour as the reference category 
instead of low occupational PA, we found a weaker association 
of high level occupational PA with all-cause mortality. Sedentary 
behaviour is suggested to be a risk factor for all-cause mortality, 
which is (at least partially) independent from being physically 
inactive.35 It is therefore likely that in the continuum of occupa-
tional activities, both sedentary and high level occupational PA 
may pose increased health risks for workers. Non-linear associ-
ations of PA with health outcomes such as U-shaped or J-shaped 
dose–response relationships have previously been reported for 
leisure time79 and occupational PA.43 It is, however, also known 
that a longer sitting time (in particular during work related 
computer tasks) is more frequent in higher socioeconomic 
groups,80 while high occupational PA occurs more often among 
lower socioeconomic groups.
strengths and limitations
The results presented in this review were obtained from low risk 
of bias studies using prospective data from 193 
696 participants 
in the meta-analysis. On request, study data were re-analysed by 
the original authors in a harmonised manner to be able to include 
as much study data as possible. Sensitivity analyses showed the 
robustness of our findings, notably our findings remained rela-
tively stable when adjusting for leisure time PA (if anything, HRs 
were higher).
A previously reported scoring tool with documented good 
inter-rater agreement was used for risk of bias assessment.28 
However, the sum scores of methodological quality obtained 
with this tool (in accordance with the authors’ score scale and 
with our pre-registered study protocol) were not able to clearly 
differentiate studies of high from low risk of bias, due to inclu-
sion of criteria reflecting complete reporting rather than bias 
risk and thus identifying very few studies that did not meet the 
‘high’ quality criterion of a sum score ≥75%. Other risk assess-
ment tools may be better able to do so and should be explored 
in future research. However, in order to be able to assess the 
role of risk of bias on the current study findings, some of the 
methodological components that were also included in the scale 
(ie, sample selection, adjustment for confounders and exposure 
assessment) were separately addressed by the sensitivity analyses 
(ie, in online supplementary material 8–10, respectively).
There was considerable heterogeneity in our pooled study 
findings, with up to 77% heterogeneity in the main findings. 
Visual inspection of funnel plots (online supplementary mate-
rial 7) indicated some risk of publication bias with under-pub-
lication of negative and underpowered results. Such a bias may 
have been reinforced by studies in which occupational PA did 
not end up in the final multivariate model,46 53 and because we 
were not able to pool data from several studies with null find-
ings.38 39 42 48 Alternatively, the counterintuitive nature of the PA 
paradox may have caused a bias towards under-publication of 
positive findings.
When multiple articles were published on the same cohort, 
only data from articles with the longest follow-up period 
were included in our quantitative analysis. As such, short term 
effects among the most vulnerable workers may have been 
missed. Furthermore, it has previously been shown that expo-
sure outcome associations may attenuate over time in prospec-
tive studies,81 as a result of which even stronger associations 
may have been found if we had reported on shorter follow-up 
periods. In fact, data from the only study that allowed for a direct 
comparison of effect sizes between short (8 
years; HR 1.82, 
95% CI 1.48 to 2.81)45 and long follow-up periods (22 
years; 
HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.74),19 confirm this notion. Insuffi-
cient information on cumulative dose–response associations (in 
terms of years of occupational PA) is currently available. Due to 
a lack of repeated measurements of occupational PA in the iden-
tified studies, the effect of changes in occupational PA over time 
(eg, on retirement) could not be accounted for.
Studies included in this review were based only on self-reports 
of occupational PA and all but one21 used crude categories (with 
heterogeneous definitions) to operationalise occupational PA 
exposure. The reduction of continuous data or multiple occu-
pational PA categories into a dichotomous variable as performed 
either by the original study authors or by us for the purpose of 
our meta-analysis may have resulted in a conservative misclas-
sification bias, leading to an underestimation of the magnitude 
of the association of occupational PA with mortality. A better 
understanding of this phenomenon requires future studies

Review
using objectively and continuously measured occupational PA, 
re-analyses of existing data and full utilisation of rank ordered 
occupational PA categories when available. Moreover, future 
research should clearly distinguish PA domains (ie, work and 
leisure time, as well as transportation) when studying the asso-
ciation of PA with health outcomes. This can, for example, be 
done by combining accelerometer based measurements with logs 
or self-reported diaries regarding time use (eg, the time spent at 
work).82 Consistent reporting of PA outcomes, across different 
domains of PA, can facilitate future harmonisation of data.
In future studies, more detailed information on various causes 
of death, and studies on physiological outcomes (eg, heart rate, 
blood pressure) and more proximal (early non-symptomatic) 
disease outcomes (eg, arterial intima media thickness, heart rate 
variability, pulse wave velocity) should be examined. Studies of 
non-symptomatic outcomes are less vulnerable to healthy worker 
selection bias, and may be advantageous to further elucidate the 
underlying mechanisms of the association of occupational PA 
with adverse health outcomes.
COnClusIOn
This systematic review shows that men with high levels of occu-
pational PA experience higher mortality risks from all causes 
compared with those engaging in low levels of occupational PA, 
even after controlling for relevant factors (including leisure time 
PA). These findings suggest that a PA paradox may exist in male 
workers. The mechanisms behind this should be explored further. 
If the observed associations are causal, then PA guidelines should 
differentiate between occupational and leisure time PA. Meeting 
current general PA guidelines through occupational PA instead 
of leisure time PA may not provide the intended health benefits 
or may even confer health risks.

What is already known?
 
► The importance of physical activity for the prevention of 
non-communicable diseases has been well described.
 
► Health effects associated with different (ie, occupational, 
leisure time and transportation) domains of physical activity 
are considered to be beneficial and alike.
 
► New evidence, however, suggests a physical activity paradox 
with a contrast between the health effects associated with 
leisure time and occupational physical activity.
 
► This evidence, surprisingly, suggests beneficial health 
outcomes associated with high level leisure time physical 
activity, but detrimental health consequences associated with 
those exposed to high level occupational physical activity.
What are the new findings?
 
► We are the first to find evidence consistent with the physical 
activity paradox in a systematic review with meta-analysis, 
summarising evidence from 17 longitudinal studies with 
1 93 696 participants.
 
► We showed that men engaging in high (compared with low) 
level occupational physical activity have a 18% increased 
risk of all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for relevant 
factors, such as leisure time physical activity.
 
► This evidence indicates that physical activity guidelines 
should differentiate between occupational and leisure time 
physical activity.
