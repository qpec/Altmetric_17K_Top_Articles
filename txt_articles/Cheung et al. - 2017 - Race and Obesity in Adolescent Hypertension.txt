abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The overall prevalence of essential hypertension in adolescents 
may be growing. Differences in blood pressure (BP) are well established in adults, but are 
less clear in adolescents. We hypothesize that the prevalence of hypertension differs by 
race/ethnicity among adolescents at school-based screenings.
METHODS: We performed school-based BP screening in over 20 000 adolescents from 2000 
to 2015. Race/ethnicity was self-reported. Height and weight were measured to determine 
BMI, and BP status was confirmed on 3 occasions to diagnose sustained hypertension 
according to Fourth Working Group Report criteria.
RESULTS: We successfully screened 21 062 adolescents aged 10 to 19 years (mean, 13.8 years). 
The final prevalence of sustained hypertension in all subjects was 2.7%. Obesity rates were 
highest among African American (3.1%) and Hispanic (2.7%) adolescents. The highest rate 
of hypertension was seen in Hispanic (3.1%), followed by African American (2.7%), white 
(2.6%), and Asian (1.7%) adolescents (P = .019). However, obese white adolescents had 
the highest prevalence of sustained hypertension (7.4%) compared with obese African 
American adolescents (4.5%, P < .001). At lower BMI percentiles (<60th percentile), 
Hispanic adolescents actually had the lowest predicted prevalence of hypertension among 
the 4 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypertension varies among different race/ethnicities. 
Although obesity remains the strongest predictor of early hypertension, the strength of 
this relationship is intensified in Hispanic and white adolescents, whereas it is lessened in 
African American adolescents.

WhaT’s KnOWn On ThIs subjecT: The prevalence 
of adolescent obesity and hypertension has seen 
a marked rise in the last 40 years. Surveys of the 
pediatric population in the United States show a 
disproportionate rise among minority groups.
WhaT ThIs sTuDy aDDs: Although an increasing 
BMI continues to be strongly predictive of rising 
hypertension prevalence across all racial and ethnic 
groups, we have shown that Asian, African American, 
Hispanic, and white children exhibit different 
degrees of synergism between blood pressure and 
BMI.

Overweight and obesity has tripled 
in prevalence among children in 
the United States since the 1960s.1 
Currently one-third of US children 
are overweight or obese, with 
adolescent obesity exceeding 18.4% 
nationally.2 Although the overweight 
incidence has plateaued since 2000, 
the rate of obesity continues to rise.3 
One consequence of rising obesity is 
an epidemiologic shift in pediatric 
hypertension.
The burden of pediatric obesity 
falls more often on minorities in 
the United States2, 
 
3 but most of 
what is known about the racial/
ethnic disparities in hypertension 
comes from studies in adults. In 
children, data suggest that the 
risk of hypertension is greater in 
minority groups, with Hispanic and 
African American children having 
the highest incidence, followed white 
children, respectively.4 
–6 However, 
there remains a paucity of data, 
particularly in Asian populations, in 
defining the role of race/ethnicity 
in childhood hypertension in the 
context of BMI.
MeThODs
Between 2000 and 2015, the 
Houston Pediatric and Adolescent 
Hypertension Program at the 
University of Texas McGovern 
Medical School at Houston completed 
school-based blood pressure (BP) 
screenings in 27 secondary education 
schools. Schools were selected by 
convenience sampling with the goal 
of identifying a population with 
similar racial/ethnic distribution 
as the Houston population at large. 
All students enrolled at selected 
schools were eligible to participate, 
with physical education classes as 
the primary point of contact. The 
screening study was performed in 
lieu of regular physical education 
activities. Our screening protocols 
were approved by the Committee for 
Protection of Human Subjects at the 
University of Texas Health Science 
Center at Houston, as well as local 
school district institutional review 
boards where required. Individual 
consents were obtained from each 
student’s primary caretaker per local 
school district policy. In schools that 
did not require individual consents, 
all students were screened unless 
either the student or legal guardian 
declined.
Participating students completed 
an open-ended questionnaire 
that identified age, sex, racial/
ethnic background, and use of 
antihypertensive medications. Our 
study personnel was composed 
of paramedics, medical students, 
pediatric residents, fellows, clinic 
nurses, and attending staff. All 
persons responsible for obtaining 
readings were trained in the 
proper use of the equipment. Study 
personnel then measured arm 
circumference (cm), height (cm), 
and weight (kg). A minimum of 2 
oscillometric BP readings were 
obtained with a Spacelabs 90217 
(Snoqualmie, WA) or Dinamap 
Critikon (Tampa, FL) monitor 
with at least 1 minute between 
measurements. All measurements 
were conducted while participants 
were seated and used an 
appropriately sized cuff as outlined 
in the Fourth Working Group Report 
on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure in 
Children and Adolescents guidelines.7 
Our study protocol required a 
minimum of 2 BP readings on the 
initial visit. In our final data set, 
3.6% of the students had only 2 BP 
readings, with the remaining 96% 
having ≥3 readings. All first BP 
measurements were discarded, and 
a mean of the remaining readings 
was calculated. The results were 
compared with the Fourth Working 
Group Report criteria to classify BP 
according to sex, age, and height 
for each individual student. All 
students with BP ≥90th percentile 
or ≥120/80 mm Hg were classified 
as having an initial abnormal BP. 
Students with abnormal BPs on the 
initial screening day subsequently 
had repeated measurements on 
up to 2 additional occasions to 
confirm the presence of sustained 
hypertension as recommended by 
the Fourth Working Group Report. 
All follow-up BP measurements 
were performed within 2 months of 
the initial screening date to reduce 
potential confounding from changes 
in body habitus. After the 3 screening 
sessions, subjects were classified 
as follows: (1) normotensive: mean 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90th 
percentile for age, height, and sex 
at first screening, (2) hypertensive: 
mean SBP or DBP ≥95th percentile 
(or ≥140/90 mm Hg for subjects ≥18 
years) for all 3 screenings, or (3) at 
risk: elevated BP at the first visit but 
not meeting criteria for hypertension. 
For the majority of the analysis, 
normotensive and at risk groups 
were collapsed into 1 category. 
BMI percentiles representing 
conventional pediatric categories 
(<85th percentile: normal, 85th–94th 
percentile: overweight, ≥95th 
percentile: obese) were based on the 
2000 Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention growth charts.
Continuous variables are reported as 
mean ± SD (minimum–maximum); 
categorical variables are reported 
as count (n) and/or percentage (%) 
and tested by χ2 test. A binomial 
regression with log link was fit 
for the outcome of sustained 
hypertension with the predictors 
of age, sex, BMI percentile, and 
race/ethnicity. All main effects and 
pairwise interactions were tested 
for model inclusion in a backward 
stepwise fashion. Two models 
were fit to assess the consistency 
of the effect of BMI percentile as a 
continuous variable and categorical 
variable. Minimization of Bayesian 
information criterion was used to 
determine the best-fit model. The 
variance–covariance matrix was 
adjusted for intracorrelation clusters

within schools. Average predicted 
effects from the final model are 
reported. A two-sided P value of .05 
was used to determine statistical 
significance for all tests.
ResulTs
Between 2000 and 2015, 22 382 
students participated in our BP 
screening program. Students were 
excluded if they were hypertensive 
on the first visit, but failed to 
complete subsequent follow-ups for 
confirmation (n = 825). Students 
were also excluded if they reported 
any use of antihypertensive 
medications or were missing sex, 
race/ethnicity, age, height, or weight 
(n = 11). Due to the small sample size, 
we also excluded students who self-
identified as mixed race/ethnicity, 
Hispanic-African American, Pacific 
Islander, Native American, or other 
(n = 484). Because the vast majority 
of Hispanic students identified 
themselves as Hispanic-white, we 
will refer to this category as simply 
Hispanic for the remainder of the 
study. After exclusions, our final 
cohort consisted of 21 062 students 
from 27 secondary schools in the 
greater Houston area.
The final data set used in our analysis 
was composed of 21 062 students 
(48% boys) with a mean age of 13.8 ±  
1.7 (10–19) years (Table 1). There 
were 6943 white students (33%), 
7394 Hispanic students (35%), 
5259 African American students 
(25%), and 1466 Asian students 
(7%). Approximately one-third of 
students were overweight (18%) or 
obese (19%), aligning with national 
estimates from NHANES.2
Hispanic students had the highest 
prevalence of overweight/obesity 
(20%/23%), followed by African 
American students (19%/21%), 
white students (16%/13%), and 
Asian students (16%/10%) (Fig 1). 
The largest percentage of obesity was 
composed of Hispanic (44%) and 
African American (29%) students. 
Similarly, Hispanic and African 
American students also contributed 
disproportionately to the overall 
prevalence of hypertension when 
compared with white and Asian 
students. Hispanic students made 
up 35% of the study population, but 
accounted for 40% all hypertensive 
students. Conversely, Asian students 
accounted for 7% of the student 
population, but only 4% of all 
hypertensive students.
The final prevalence of sustained 
hypertension was 2.7% (2% stage 1 
and 0.7% stage 2) across all BMIs  
and races/ethnicities (Table 1).

hypertension at first screening 
exhibited isolated systolic 
hypertension (2006 or 92%), 
followed by combined systolic/
diastolic hypertension (140 or 6%) 
and isolated diastolic hypertensives 
(43 or 2%). Boys had a higher rate of 
hypertension (3.3%) compared with 
girls (2.1%). Interestingly, the rate of 
hypertension increased with age in 
boys, but decreased with age in girls. 
Hypertension prevalence at each 
screen increased with increasing 
BMI (Fig 2). Among students with 
normal BMI, 1.6% had hypertension. 
Overweight and obese students had 
a higher prevalence of hypertension 
at 2.6% and 6.6%, respectively (P < 
.001). Correspondingly, groups with 
a higher proportion of overweight or 
obese students were more likely to 
be hypertensive. The highest rate of 
hypertension was seen in Hispanic 
students (3.1%), then African 
American students (2.7%), white 
students (2.6%), and Asian students 
(1.7%) (P = .019).
Nearly one-third of obese  
adolescents remained hypertensive 
from initial to final screen, whereas 
only 23% of adolescents with  
BMI percentiles between the  
25th and 95th remained  
hypertensive (Fig 2). Those 
most likely to show normalized 
BPs were subjects with BMI 
percentiles between the fifth and 
25th. Interestingly, underweight 
adolescents (BMI <5th percentile) 
with an initial high BP also exhibited 
a high rate of sustained hypertension 
(31%) similar to that seen in obese 
adolescents. When stratified by race/
ethnicity, this finding in underweight 
adolescents was accounted for by 
the white and African American 
populations exclusively (41.3% 
and 25.5%, respectively) and was 
not seen in the Hispanic and Asian 
populations (0%).
When BMI and race/ethnicity data 
were compared, a disproportionate 
increase in the prevalence of 
hypertension was noted among obese 
Hispanic and white students (7.7% 
and 7.4%, respectively) (Fig 3). These 
high rates of hypertension seen 
specifically in obese Hispanic and 
white subjects were not seen in their 
nonobese counterparts. Conversely, 
although African American students 
had the highest prevalence of 
hypertension among normal (2%) 
and overweight (2.8%) subjects, they 
had the lowest rate of hypertension 
among obese subjects (4.5%). The 
Asian cohort exhibited a trend of 
lower hypertension rates across all 
BMI groups.
These varying relationships between 
BMI and BPs are obscured when we 
fail to account for race/ethnicity  
(Fig 4). Among the 4 groups sampled, 
the Hispanic population showed 
the steepest rise in hypertension 
prevalence when plotted against 
BMI percentiles. At lower BMI 
percentiles (<60th percentile), 
Hispanic adolescents actually had 
the lowest predicted prevalence of 
hypertension among the 4 groups. 
Similar to the white population, 
the Hispanic population followed a 
trend of slowly rising hypertension 
prevalence until they reached a BMI 
of approximately the 60th percentile, 
where they experienced a rapid rise. 
Once they reached approximately the 
90th percentile for BMI, the Hispanic 
population transitioned from having 
the lowest rate of hypertension to 
the highest rate among the 4 groups, 
more than doubling the incidence of 
hypertension in the Asian group at 
BMIs >95th percentile.
This disproportionate burden of 
hypertension seen in obese  
Hispanic and white adolescents 
was confirmed in multivariate 
analysis with BMI percentile as 
a categorical factor. The relative 
risk of hypertension due to obesity 
varied significantly by racial/
ethnic group (Fig 5). Specifically, in 
Hispanic adolescents, the relative 
risk of hypertension was 5.8 times 
higher in obese adolescents and 
2.2 times higher in overweight 
adolescents compared with those 
with normal weights. Similarly, 
obese white adolescents had 
an increased relative risk of 4.1 
and obese African American 
adolescents had a relative risk of 2.3

compared with their normal weight 
counterparts. Although at slightly 
increased risk, being overweight 
was not a significant risk factor for 
hypertension in any group except for 
the Hispanic population.
DIscussIOn
In this study, we found 2.7% 
of students have sustained 
hypertension. Additionally, we 
report that the introduction of race/
ethnicity significantly alters the 
established BMI-BP relationship. 
Although an increasing BMI 
continues to be strongly predictive 
of an increase in hypertension 
prevalence across all racial/ethnic 
groups, it appears to have a smaller 
impact on African American and 
Asian populations. Many studies 
have considered only additive effects 
of both race/ethnicity and BMI 
independently on BP. This study 
confirms race/ethnic-specific BMI-BP 
associations in a large pediatric 
sample.
Several of our findings have been 
corroborated in other studies. The 
excess of hypertension among 
normal-weight African American 
children compared with white 
children was shown by Rosner  
et al8 in a large study of the US 
Task Force data. Rosner et al8 and a 
longitudinal study of 2379 adolescent 
girls have also reported the blunted 
effect of increasing BMI on BP in 
African American adolescents, 
9 as 
well as in several historical studies 
in African American and white 
adults.10, 
11 Interestingly, some 
studies have found the opposite to 
be true, where the association of 
BMI with BP may be stronger in the 
Chinese-Asian population than in 
non-Asian populations.12, 
 
13 It should 
be noted that these studies draw data 
from adults in mainland China, and 
therefore may not be analogous to 
the Asian-American population.
The prevalence of obesity in our 
study of adolescents was 19%, which 
is similar to the national estimate 
of 20.5% (95% confidence interval, 
17.1%–24.4%) reported from the 
NHANES conducted in 2011 to 
2012.2 Given that the NHANES was 
designed to be a representative 
sample of the US population, this 
consistency with the NHANES 
demographic data suggests that our 
findings may be generalizable to 
other US regions. The prevalence of 
obesity was found to be highest in

the Hispanic population, followed 
by the African American, white, and 
Asians populations, respectively. The 
Hispanic population had the highest 
median BMI (81st percentile), 
followed by the African American 
(78th percentile), white (67th 
percentile), and Asian populations 
(66th percentile). This pattern of 
obesity prevalence among the 4 
groups has also been reported in a 
clinical electronic medical record–
based study of 117 618 children 
between the ages of 6 and 17 
years in California, Colorado, and 
Minnesota.14 Other diverse cohorts 
have also demonstrated a higher 
prevalence of obesity in Hispanic 
and African American populations 
relative to the non-Hispanic white 
population.15, 
 
16
We observed a spike in sustained 
hypertension prevalence among 
adolescents with a BMI <5th 
percentile (Fig 2). As noted in the 
results, this finding is accounted for 
by the white and African American 
populations exclusively and is 
not seen in the Hispanic or Asian 
populations. Given the existing 
limitations of our data set, we can 
only speculate as to the reasons for 
this finding. Studies have supported 
the concept of the fetal origins 
hypothesis, which proposes that  
an inverse relationship exists 
between low birth weight and 
subsequent hypertension.17, 
 
18  
This finding certainly warrants 
additional study.
The final prevalence of sustained 
hypertension after 3 visits was 2.7%, 
higher than the 1.7% reported in 
the most recent NHANES data set 
from 2009 to 2012. The discrepancy 
between the studies may simply 
be a reflection of population 
characteristics unique to Houston. 
Alternatively, because our study

was conducted from 2000 through 
2015, our data may reflect a higher 
hypertension prevalence due to 
the inclusion of data earlier in the 
decade. NHANES has reported a 
significant decline in hypertension 
prevalence from 2.9%, to 2.7%, to 
1.7% obtained from 2001 through 
2004, 2005 through 2008, and 2009 
through 2012, respectively.2
When separated by racial/ethnic 
group, we noted a significantly higher 
prevalence of hypertension among 
African American and Hispanic 
students when compared with white 
and Asian students, mirroring the 
trends mentioned earlier in average 
BMI. The higher risk for hypertension 
among minority groups (excluding 
the Asian population), has been 
demonstrated in several  
studies.4, 
 
19 
– 
21 More so than height or 
weight, BMI has consistently been 
shown to be a strong independent 
predictor of hypertension. In the 
Bogalusa heart study, African 
American men and women who were 
overweight in adolescence were 
52% and 62%, respectively, more 
likely to become obese adults.14, 
 
22 
– 
24 
These adolescents are more likely to 
develop hypertension, obstructive 
sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and 
dyslipidemia, conditions which all 
accelerate the onset of cardiovascular 
disease.25– 
27
Our data show that the relationship 
between BMI and hypertension 
differs markedly among each group. 
At normal weights, hypertension 
is most common among African 
American adolescents (2%), and 
lowest in Asian adolescents (1.3%). 
Although Hispanic adolescents 
have the lowest prevalence of 
hypertension among adolescents 
with a BMI <60th percentile, they 
have the highest hypertension 
prevalence among those with a 
BMI >60th percentile. Overweight 
and obese (BMI >85th percentile) 
Hispanic and white adolescents 
quickly surpass African American 
and Asian adolescents in terms of 
hypertension prevalence, suggesting 
a stronger association between BMI 
and BP in these 2 groups. Therefore, 
although African American 
adolescents have the highest rate of 
hypertension overall, obesity does 
not seem to affect BPs as markedly as 
it does in other groups.
The consideration of race/ethnicity 
also introduces a set of variables  
that extend beyond genetics. 
Differences in culture and social 
expectations exert influences on 
health behaviors, environmental 
exposures, and access to health 
care. All these factors may affect 
weight gain and, in turn, BP. As the 
demographics of the United States 
continue to evolve, studies need to 
account for increasingly prevalent 
minorities such as Hispanic and Asian 
people. To our knowledge, this is the 
first study that compares adolescent 
BPs in relation to BMI from 4 major 
racial/ethnic groups in the United 
States (white, African American, 
Hispanic, and Asian).
One limitation in our study is that 
the cross-sectional nature only 
allows us to describe differences and 
hypothesize causality. In addition, 
we relied on students to self-identify 
race/ethnicity. There has also been 
much debate regarding the effects 
of sexual maturation on BP.28 
Without data on pubertal status in 
this adolescent population, we were 
unable to test its effect on BMI and 
BP. Testing of interactions between 
race/ethnicity and age were not 
significant in the multiple logistic 
regression analysis.
The use of BMI in our study 
carries limitations as a suboptimal 
measure for weight classification 
when applied uniformly among 
different races/ethnicities. 
Race-specific body composition 
differences have been demonstrated 
in adult populations.29 
– 
31 Such 
disparities may result in the over/
underestimation of obesity in 
our African American and Asian 
students, respectively. In turn, this 
could conceivably blunt the rise of 
hypertension prevalence with rising 
BMI in African American adolescents 
while amplifying the prevalence 
among Asian adolescents.
The particular strengths of our 
study are its large size and diverse 
sampling of adolescents from all 
socioeconomic groups in Houston. 
The sample size enabled statistically 
powerful comparisons between 
several major racial/ethnic groups. 
Our goal was to obtain a cross-
sectional survey of the adolescent 
population in the greater Houston 
area, which could be extrapolated 
to other population centers in the 
United States. We minimized the 
white-coat effect by screening 
subjects in a nonclinical setting, 
discarding the first BP measurement, 
and defining hypertension as 
having sustained elevations in BP 
over 3 consecutive screenings. By 
including adolescents from varied 
socioeconomic backgrounds, we 
captured populations with both 
regular and limited access to  
health care.
cOnclusIOns
Despite the plateau seen over the last 
decade in the prevalence of childhood 
hypertension, the prevalence remains 
unacceptably high. In our cross-
sectional analysis of adolescents in 
Houston, we sought to gain a better 
understanding of the differences in 
obesity and hypertension among 
the major racial/ethnic groups 
represented in the United States 
today. We have demonstrated that 
these groups clearly show different 
degrees of synergism between BP 
and BMI.
Our understanding of how race/
ethnicity and BMI relate to other 
diagnoses remains incomplete. 
Additional studies are needed to 
evaluate the relationships of BMI 
with other diagnoses, such as 
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and 
obstructive sleep apnea. Because

current trends only promise a new 
generation of young adults with 
early-onset cardiovascular disease, 
a reliable model for determining 
individual risk for hypertension in

additionally support the need 
for a variable approach to BMI 
interpretation in a racially and 
ethnically diverse population.
