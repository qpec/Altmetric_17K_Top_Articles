Abstract
Many lifestyle patterns are established when children are young. Research has focused on
the potential role of parents as a risk factor for non communicable disease in children, but
there is limited investigation of the role of other caregivers, such as grandparents. The aim
of this review was to identify and synthesise evidence for any influence grandparents’ care
practices may have on their grandchildren’s long term cancer risk factors. A systematic
review was carried out with searches across four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of
Science, PsycINFO) as well as searches of reference lists and citing articles, and Google
Scholar. Search terms were based on six areas of risk that family care could potentially influ-
ence–weight, diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol and sun exposure. All study designs
were included, as were studies that provided an indication of the interaction of grandparents
with their grandchildren. Studies were excluded if grandparents were primary caregivers
and if children had serious health conditions. Study quality was assessed using National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence checklists. Grandparent impact was categorised as
beneficial, adverse, mixed or as having no impact. Due to study heterogeneity a meta-analy-
sis was not possible. Qualitative studies underwent a thematic synthesis of their results.
Results from all included studies indicated that there was a sufficient evidence base for
weight, diet, physical activity and tobacco studies to draw conclusions about grandparents’
influence. One study examined alcohol and no studies examined sun exposure. Evidence
indicated that, overall, grandparents had an adverse impact on their grandchildren’s cancer
risk factors. The theoretical work in the included studies was limited. Theoretically under-
pinned interventions designed to reduce these risk factors must consider grandparents’
role, as well as parents’, and be evaluated robustly to inform the evidence base further.

 Introduction
Many lifestyle patterns are established when children are young. This is especially true for diet
and physical activity patterns [1, 2], two lifestyle areas where there is substantial evidence for
the important influence of parental and other role models [3–7]. For a practice such as smok-
ing, it is during the teenage years that this habit is generally established [8]. Smoking, diet and
physical activity, along with excess weight, have been identified as risk factors for non commu-
nicable disease, particularly cancer [9]. Cancer is the leading cause of death in many countries
in Western Europe [10], however, up to 40% of cancer cases could potentially be prevented
through healthier lifestyles [9]. Research evidence on cancer prevention is limited compared
with that of cancer treatment, however, there is evidence to suggest that exposure to risk fac-
tors in childhood increases an individual’s likelihood of cancer morbidity or mortality in
adulthood [11–16].
Factors associated with children’s long term cancer risk are first experienced within the
family setting. The nuclear family of a father, mother and their children, has been the domi-
nant family model in Western societies in more recent generations [17]. Nevertheless, changes
in social conditions, such as an increase in lone parenting, more women in the workforce and
prohibitive childcare costs, have led to an increased focus on the role of grandparents’ in their
grandchildren’s lives. Health improvements have resulted in greater life expectancy enabling
grandparents to support their families by providing childcare, or spending more time with
their grandchildren as they are growing up.
Around one fifth of 0–12 year olds in Australia [18], and a quarter of pre-school children in
the US [19], are regularly cared for by grandparents. In the UK, it is estimated that grandpar-
ent care saves parents around £1700bn per year in childcare costs [20]. The extent of grandpar-
ent involvement can vary based on cultural and societal differences. For example, when
comparing childcare practices across Europe, Hank and Buber [21] found that grandparents
in Greece, Italy and Spain were more likely to provide regular childcare to their grandchildren,
and that grandparents in the Netherlands, France and Nordic countries were least likely to.
These patterns reflect the differing social and cultural contexts in these countries, such as
labour market participation by older women and state provision of formal childcare [22].
Within the UK, the important childcare role that grandparents provide has been recognised at
government level with grandparents caring for grandchildren entitled to receive National
Insurance Credits towards their state-provided pension [23]. Forthcoming legislation will also
allow grandparents to share parental leave with parents in a child’s first year of life, and for
employed grandparents to have the right to work flexibly to allow them to care for their grand-
children [24].
There is a significant literature around the impact of caring for grandchildren on grandpar-
ents’ health, particularly when grandparents are called upon to become primary carers to
grandchildren. While some studies indicate that caring for grandchildren can have an adverse
impact on grandparents’ health [25–27], there is evidence that after controlling for sociodemo-
graphic factors, this caring role can have a beneficial impact on physical health [28]. It is less
clear how grandparents’ care influence their grandchildren’s health. While there is some evi-
dence that grandparents can play a significant role in supporting their grandchildren’s social
and emotional wellbeing [29, 30], there is also evidence that the multifaceted nature of these
relationships can have both beneficial and adverse impacts [31, 32].
The influence of grandparents’ care practices on grandchildren’s physical health is also
unclear, particularly for non-communicable diseases like cancer which are more likely to be
experienced later in their grandchildren’s lives. With greater recognition of the key role of
grandparents in grandchildren’s lives, there have been calls for parenting advice to be

 broadened to encompass grandparents. For example, in Scotland, this has been proposed as a
potential strategy to help tackle health and educational inequalities in communities with high
levels of disadvantage [33]. There is therefore a need to identify, review and synthesise the liter-
ature on grandparents’ influence on their grandchildren to inform practitioners, policy makers
and academics further about family dynamics that impact on health outcomes.
The aim of this systematic review was to identify and synthesise evidence for the influence
of grandparents on their grandchildren’s long term cancer risk factors. Key objectives were:
1. To examine the availability of evidence for grandparents’ influence on a range of grandchil-
dren’s cancer risk factors;
2. To identify whether this evidence indicates that grandparents have a beneficial or adverse
impact on grandchildren’s cancer risk factors.
3. To identify theoretical frameworks used to inform research in this area.
Methods
The breadth of factors considered in the review was determined via Cancer Research UK’s
research on key preventable risk factors for cancer [9]. Cancer risk factors applicable to chil-
dren that could potentially be influenced by grandparents were selected. These included
tobacco (smoking or exposure), obesity, diet, alcohol consumption, sun exposure and inactiv-
ity. PRISMA guidelines were followed in reporting this review [34].
Search strategy
Searches were carried out using defined terms in Web of Science, Medline, Embase and Psy-
cInfo from database start dates to May 2017. The research team hand searched the reference
lists of included papers, and citing papers, and carried out a search of Google Scholar using
variations of the search terms in S1 Table.
Search terms
Synonyms were identified around the Population (grandparents and grandchildren) and Out-
come (cancer risk factors) components of the PICOS framework (see S1 Table). MeSH terms
and subject headings were used where appropriate. The Boolean operator OR was used to
combine within Population and Outcome search results, with AND used to combine these two
blocks, to search titles and abstracts.
Selection of articles
All study years and designs were included if the relevant risk factors were examined. A further
inclusion criterion was that publications must provide an indication that grandparents spent
time with their grandchildren, either by providing childcare, living with children or during vis-
its. Exclusion criteria included grandparents who acted as primary caregivers, grandchildren
with serious medical conditions, and studies examining grandparents’ health outcomes only.
Abstracts, newspaper reports and non-English language publications were also excluded.
Quality assessment
Study quality was assessed using National Institute for Health and Care Excellence checklists
relevant to the particular study design [35]. For quantitative studies (including observational,

 cohort and intervention studies), quality assessment focused around the representativeness of
the study population, the method of selection, reliability of outcomes, and appropriate analy-
ses. For qualitative studies, assessment was made based on aim, design, data collection,
researcher role, description of context, appropriate methods and analysis, richness of findings
and conclusions. Assessment of review articles was based on a focused question, relevance of
included studies, rigour of search, study assessment and appropriately described methods. An
overall study quality measure was also provided (high, medium or low) based on scores for the
individual components assessed in each of the studies.
Data extraction
Data was extracted using a predefined form adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration [36].
Extracted data included study geography, participant characteristics, sample size, study aim,
theoretical framework, outcome measures, main findings, and for qualitative data, participant
quotations and author syntheses that discussed grandparent impact on grandchildren for the
relevant risk factors.
Data synthesis
Given the range of potential outcome measures in the included quantitative studies, meta-
analysis of data was not carried out. Instead, grandparent impact was defined as beneficial,
adverse, mixed (some beneficial and some adverse outcomes) or as having no impact for all
study types. Qualitative data then underwent further synthesis through a thematic analysis of
both participants’ quotations and article syntheses. Extracted text was read and reread by two
reviewers. They each identified key themes and shared these with all study authors. Final
themes were then agreed upon, and text coded under each theme. Themes were reorganised
and structured hierarchically where possible.
Results
The searches yielded 5745 publications after removal of duplicates (Fig 1). All titles and
abstracts were screened by two reviewers, with a third reviewer providing advice when dis-
agreements on inclusion arose. This resulted in 134 publications retrieved for full text inspec-
tion, and 44 included in the analysis. A further 12 were retrieved from reference list and
Google Scholar searches. A total of 56 publications were included. Explanations for exclusion
of studies at full text stage were no indication of grandparents spending time with their grand-
children, or grandparents being primary caregivers, and no focus on children’s cancer risk
factors.
No studies examined sun protection. A single study examined alcohol [37]. There was evi-
dence examining grandparent impact on tobacco smoking or exposure [37–52] (n = 16),
weight [32, 53–68] (n = 17), diet [57, 61, 65, 66, 69–89] (n = 26), and physical activity [52, 57,
58, 61, 65, 71, 76, 79, 90] (n = 9). Study details for publications examining weight, diet and
physical activity are discussed together, although the main study results are discussed sepa-
rately for each of these areas. Tobacco studies are discussed separately, as is the single alcohol
study. Study details can be found in Tables 1–4.
Weight, diet and physical activity
Geography.
The majority of weight, diet and physical activity studies were from western
countries, including the USA [54, 56, 61, 62, 71, 75, 77, 79, 81–83, 85, 86, 89], UK [55, 59, 63,
69, 87], Australia [72, 73, 80], Canada [70], Norway [64], Hungary [90], Poland [84], and two

 reviews reported on studies from a number of different countries [32, 60]. Seven studies
reported results from China [52, 53, 57, 58, 67, 74, 88], and four studies from Japan [65, 66, 68,
76], reflecting three generational living in these two countries. A single study reported results
from Egypt [78].
Study designs.
The majority of studies contained qualitative information (n = 22) and
three studies were reviews [32, 53, 60], one of which provided a review of Chinese language
studies [53]. Of the qualitative studies, 13 included data collected from indepth interviews [58,
64, 71–75, 78, 80, 85, 86, 88, 90], 11 included data collected from focus group discussions [54,
56, 58, 69, 70, 72, 77, 79, 80, 82, 89] and one from a ethnographic study [84]. Quantitative

 studies included a mixture of cross-sectional [52, 57, 58, 61, 65, 81, 87, 88, 90], longitudinal
[55, 59, 62, 63, 66, 68, 76, 83] and a case control design [67].
Participants.
Study sample sizes ranged from 7 [75] to 300 [69] for qualitative studies,
and from 62 [81] to 43046 [68] for quantitative studies. Although some studies focused on low
income groups, the majority included participants of mixed socio-economic status, generally
measured by income, educational level or occupation. Studies predominantly gathered data
from parents [52, 54–59, 61–63, 65–68, 70–90] (n = 36), with information gathered from
grandparents in 15 studies [58, 71, 72, 74, 77, 78, 81, 82, 84–90], children in seven [68, 69, 72,
77, 80, 84, 90], from health providers in one study [78], and school staff in two studies [58, 84].
Study aims.
Nineteen studies had a specific aim of investigating the influence of grand-
parents on their grandchildren’s diet, physical activity or weight outcomes [32, 52, 58, 61, 63,
65, 66, 68, 71, 74, 75, 77, 81, 83, 85–88, 90]. These studies included a mix of qualitative and
quantitative approaches. Three studies were literature reviews. One aimed to provide an over-
view of the evidence on interventions to reduce overweight and obesity in children within
China [53]. The second aimed to synthesise qualitative literature on parental perceptions
around weight-related behaviours [60]. The third aimed to gather and synthesise research
findings on the effects of grandparent involvement on children’s physical health outcomes
[32]. Other studies’ aims included investigating a range of factors (with grandparents included
as one of a number) that might impact on children’s weight or weight-related behaviours, and
were all quantitative [55, 57, 59, 62, 67, 76]. The remaining studies were qualitative and sought
to gain a general understanding or additional insight into general weight, diet and food related
issues in children [54, 56, 64, 69, 70, 72–74, 78–80, 82, 84, 89].
Theoretical framework.
Five studies outlined or used a theoretical framework to guide
and/or analyse their investigation. Goh et al. [88] used the Intergenerational Parenting Coali-
tion approach to guide the study, that is the recognition that three-generational living forms
part of China’s embedded cultural context, and that the interactions between generations are
dialectical in influence. Sowan and Stember [62] drew on the Web of Causation Model [91] to
examine how parental characteristics can impact children’s risk of obesity. This model focuses
on risk and the interrelationships between risk factors. Styles et al. [82] used the socio-ecologi-
cal approach [92] (the different levels that impact on an individuals’ health practices) to exam-
ine parents’ and grandparents’ concerns around obesity prevention, classifying them around
intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational and environmental levels. Boni [84] drew on Prac-
tice Theory in an ethnographic study that examined children’s food cultures in post-Soviet
Poland, whilst Eli et al. [71] used a conceptual framework of familial homeostasis to discuss
intergenerational feeding of children.

 Physical activity—The evidence relating to children’s activity was less conclusive than for
diet and weight, however, there was still greater evidence that grandparents’ actions had an
adverse impact on grandchildren’s outcomes. Four studies identified adverse outcomes [52,
58, 76, 79], one study found mixed outcomes [71], one adverse/no impact [58], and a single
study found no impact [65]. Lako [90] was the only study to find beneficial outcomes. They
described both grandparents’ practical and support roles in transporting grandchildren to
sporting activities, and actively cheering them on.
Study quality (see S2–S4 Tables).
For weight, diet and physical activity quantitative stud-
ies, seven were rated as high quality [55, 59, 62, 63, 65, 76, 83], demonstrating unbiased and
externally valid results; seven were rated as medium quality [52, 57, 58, 66–68, 87], and three
as low [61, 81, 90]. Low quality studies tended to have unreliable measures, low sample sizes
and/or did not control adequately for confounding factors. Eight qualitative studies were rated
as high quality [56, 58, 70, 71, 73, 75, 79, 86], ten were medium [54, 64, 72, 74, 78, 82, 84, 85,
88, 89] and four were low quality [69, 77, 80, 90]. Low quality studies had not adequately
described the study context, the researchers’ roles, used reliable methods or conducted and/or
reported the results of a rigorous analysis. These studies tended to inadequately report ethical
procedures and approvals. All three review studies were rated as medium quality [32, 53, 60],
with the search and inclusion of studies strong.
Thematic synthesis.
Thematic analysis of extracted weight related qualitative data identi-
fied two broad themes describing grandparent impact: 1) Influence on family relationships
and 2) Grandchildren’s diet. A more specific theme on physical activity was also identified. All
studies reported some adverse impacts, with parents and grandparents reporting divergent
views on appropriate eating behaviour [54, 56, 58, 64, 69, 70, 73–75, 78–80, 82, 84, 85, 88, 89].
This included the type of food provided, for example, high sugar or fat foods, or providing too
much food. Parents reported feeling frustrated and undermined, and described these practices

 as ‘spoiling’ grandchildren. The need to rely on grandparents for childcare often resulted in
grandparents’ practices prevailing [73, 75], however in other instances, grandparents reported
that they followed parents’ rules. Johnson et al. [75] and Eli et al. [71] reported both adverse
(eg, disconnected, ambivalent) and beneficial influences on family relationships. Where rela-
tionships were disconnected or ambivalent, mothers described rejecting some or all of the
food practices that were modelled by grandmothers. These parents wished to provide their
children with healthier foods, or to change mealtime practices, such as the rule that children
must clear their plate. Conversely grandparents could also reject parents’ healthier food prac-
tices. Beneficial relationships were described through the intergenerational transmission of
cooking skills and practices, but also through grandmothers being mindful of parents’ wish for
children to eat healthily.
Four different roles around grandchildren’s diets were identified for grandparents’, (1) Buy-
ing and preparing food 2) Excessive and non-recommended feeding 3) Food as control/love 4)
Promoting healthy food choices. 1) Buying and preparing food—A number of studies
described grandparents as a source of support for parents either in buying, preparing and
cooking food [71, 72, 74, 86, 88]. While the preparation of meals from scratch with fresh ingre-
dients could be seen as a positive, this was undermined by the role grandparents could play in
overfeeding children or feeding less healthy foods [71, 74, 79, 82, 85]. 2) Excessive and non-
recommended feeding—Jiang et al. [74] and Li et al. [58] described grandparents’ excessively
feeding children as a form of nurturing, where grandparents believed that overfeeding and
excess weight were signs of health, and that this was a response to poverty and hunger experi-
enced by grandparents in their youth. The feeding of non-recommended foods was demon-
strated by grandmothers in Egypt, where they believed that children needed to eat ‘light’,
sugary foods to thrive [78]. 3) Food as control/love—Related to overfeeding was grandparents
using food to demonstrate their love for their grandchild [71, 74, 84]. This included practices
such as physically feeding children who were capable of carrying this out for themselves, or
providing foods prohibited by parents. Grandparents also said they used food a means through
which to control grandchildren’s behaviour and to reward them for achievements. Roberts
and Pettigrew [80] found that Australian parents reported that grandparents provided
unhealthy food as a strategy to create a stronger bond between them and their grandchildren.
Strategies to reduce tensions between parents and grandparents were not discussed in any
studies. 4) Promoting healthy food choices—This theme was described in two studies [75, 77],

 and involved grandparents engaging with children in interactive ways to promote healthy eat-
ing, such as through humour, or by involving them in meal planning and preparation.
A final theme was grandparents’ impact on children’s activity-related practices. These
included, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and screen time, and were discussed in three
studies [58, 71, 90]. There was no overall direction in which grandparents appeared to impact
these practices. Some grandparents put limits on children’s screen time, whist others allowed
the same access as that provided at home. Physical activity levels appeared to be related to
whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where
children could be active. Grandparents were supportive of children’s participation in physical
activity, and often enabled it through facilitating children’s access to spaces in which they
could carry this out. In contrast to food, there appeared to be less tension in relation to parent-
ing practices around activity.
Tobacco studies
Geography.
Similar to weight-related studies, the majority of tobacco studies drew on
data from developed countries. Four studies were from the USA [38–41], three from China
[42, 50, 52], two each from Spain [49, 51], South Africa [37, 46] and Sweden [44, 45], and one
each from the UK [47], Czech Republic [43] and Thailand [48].
Study designs.
Four studies reported qualitative findings [39, 47, 48, 50], Carlsson et al.
[45] reported on the results of an intervention with parents around secondhand smoke (SHS),
and the remaining studies were cross-sectional surveys [37, 38, 40–44, 46, 49, 51, 52].
Participants.
Study sample sizes for the qualitative studies were 20 parents from low
income families [39], 50 smokers and non smokers living with smokers and nine of their rela-
tives [47], interviews with 22 Chinese families (n = 16 mothers, 5 grandmothers, 4 fathers, 4
grandfathers) [50], and 25 women smokers [48]. Quantitative studies ranged in study size
from 174 [38] to 46,982 [40]. The majority of quantitative studies included representative or
random samples. Parents were interviewed in seven studies [38–41, 47, 50, 52], and children in
seven studies [37, 42, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51]. Two studies carried out research with grandparents
[47, 50]. One study interviewed child healthcare nurses [44].
Study aims.
Four studies examined the impact of grandparents on children’s smoking, or
their exposure to secondhand smoke [37, 49–51]. Other studies aimed to examine the relation-
ship between children’s levels of SHS exposure [38–41, 44, 47, 52] or respiratory ill health [39,
42] and a range of possible environmental exposures (including grandparents), or potential
influences on children’s smoking behaviour [43, 46, 48]. The intervention study evaluated new
methods for nurses to support parents in protecting their children from SHS [45].
Theoretical framework.
Four studies made reference to theory. Robinson et al. [47] ana-
lysed in-depth interview data drawing from aspects of social theory, though this was not speci-
fied further. Escario and Wilkinson and Duarte et al. (using data from the same survey) used
social learning theory to frame their cross-sectional analyses of in-home influences on chil-
dren’s smoking practices. Mao [50] used theories of gender inequality to investigate the role of
mothers’ and grandmothers’ in regulating grandfathers’ smoking around young children.
Study results.
Nine studies out of 16 found that there was an adverse impact of grandpar-
ents on children’s smoking or exposure to SHS [38, 39, 41, 44–46, 48, 51, 52]. Three additional
studies found a mix of adverse impacts for some outcomes and no impact for others [40, 42,
43]. Living with a grandparent who smoked was problematic [37, 40, 42, 49–51], as was visiting
grandparents who smoked [38, 39, 41, 44, 45]. Mao [50] found that living with grandfathers
who smoked increased children’s secondhand smoke exposure, but that living with grand-
mothers was protective. Profe and Wild [37] found no impact of grandparent involvement on

 smoking. Robinson et al. [47] identified a beneficial impact of grandparents, with participants
reporting that becoming a grandparent had prompted grandparent smokers to reassess their
habits, and to no longer smoke indoors when their grandchildren were present. Escario and
Wilkinson [49] found that living with a grandparent reduced the likelihood that a child would
smoke, but had no impact on the consumption levels of children who did smoke.
Study quality (see S5–S7 Tables).
For quantitative tobacco studies, three were rated as
high quality [40, 42, 46], four were rated as medium quality [44, 49, 51, 52] and four as low [37,
38, 41, 43]. Low quality studies had low sample sizes or unrepresentative samples and/or did
not control adequately for confounding. Two qualitative studies were rated as high quality [39,
47], and two medium quality [48, 50]. The single intervention study (a before/after design)
was rated as medium quality [45], with weaknesses explicitly around analysis.
Thematic synthesis.
The four qualitative studies provided only limited data for the the-
matic synthesis [39, 47, 48, 50]. The three themes were, 1) parents limiting grandparent access
to grandchildren who smoke, 2) grandparents protecting children from SHS, and 3) grandpar-
ents acting as negative role models. For the first theme, parents described their inability to
enforce rules around grandparents smoking in the home, and that this resulted in parents lim-
iting grandparent interaction with grandchildren [39, 50]. In contrast Robinson et al. [47],
found that the birth of grandchildren was a catalyst that encouraged grandparents to stop
smoking completely, or to stop smoking indoors when their grandchildren were present. This
was also true of some grandparents in Mao’s study of Chinese grandparents [50]. The third
theme of grandparents acting as negative role models was discussed by Thai women [48] who
described growing up around grandparents who smoked. As well as seeing smoking practices
frequently, they became more involved through buying or rolling tobacco for grandparents.
Women said they believed this early exposure and involvement in smoking practices partly
explained their own smoking as an adult.
Alcohol
A single study examined the impact of grandparents on children’s alcohol consumption
(Table 4). Prof and Wilde [37] used cross-sectional data gathered from adolescents in South
Africa to investigate whether grandparent involvement predicted use of alcohol. The results
found no significant impact, and the study was rated as low quality.
Discussion
This review has been the first to identify and synthesise evidence for the influence of grandpar-
ents on their grandchildren’s long term cancer risk factors. Results indicated that there was a
sufficient evidence base for weight, diet, physical activity and tobacco studies to draw conclu-
sions about grandparents’ impact. There was minimal evidence for alcohol and no evidence
for sun exposure.
Evidence for weight, diet, physical activity and tobacco studies strongly suggest that grand-
parents had an adverse impact on their grandchildren’s health in these areas [52–54, 56, 57, 59,
60, 63, 67, 69, 70, 72–74, 76, 78–80, 85, 88, 89]. In the tobacco studies reviewed, grandparents
smoked around grandchildren, did not comply with parents’ wishes regarding SHS, and role
modelled negative behaviour which led to grandchildren taking up smoking [38–46, 48, 51,
52]. For weight-related studies, grandparents were characterised by parents as indulgent, mis-
informed and as using food as an emotional tool within their relationships with grandchildren
[74, 79, 80, 82]. However, much of the evidence for these studies came from parents, with a rel-
atively small number of studies representing grandparents’ perspectives [58, 71, 72, 74, 77, 78,
81, 82, 84–90]. Nevertheless, quantitative studies also provided evidence for an adverse impact,

 in some cases using objective measures [52, 55, 57, 59, 61–63, 66–68]. For example, Pearce
et al.[59] found that children looked after in informal childcare, the majority of which was
provided by grandparents, were more likely to be overweight. It is noteworthy that this rela-
tionship was only found in families where parents were described as socio-economically
advantaged.
Studies that showed a beneficial impact highlighted that grandparents did not always
undermine parents, and could play a role in promoting healthy eating practices [32, 57, 61, 64,
65, 71, 75, 77, 81, 82, 84, 86, 87, 90]. Robinson et al. [47] provided a high quality in-depth
study of smokers, ex-smokers and their families, identifying grandparenthood as a pivotal
point for behaviour change, either by deciding to stop smoking completely or stop smoking in
the home. It was not possible to identify under what circumstances these beneficial impacts
took place due to the heterogeneity of the included studies.
The results indicate a lack of theoretical rigour in most of the studies in this area. Only nine
studies used or made reference to an explicit theoretical framework. These included the inter-
generational parenting coalition [88], web of causation [62], socio-ecological models [82],
social learning theory [49, 51], practice theory [84], familial homeostasis [71] and theories of
gender inequality [50]. In identifying grandparents as impacting adversely on their grandchil-
dren’s cancer risk factors, studies failed to take into account the wider context in which the
results are to be understood. Grandparents are likely to be one of many influences on health
outcomes, and are located at the interpersonal level of the socio-ecological impacts on health
[92]. Indeed grandparenting exists within a complex social system in which it interacts with
influences at a variety of levels in children’s lives. Few of the studies above discuss these in
depth, but they suggest some potentially important influences, such as parents’ working pat-
terns, societal norms and lack of other childcare options.
The studies included in the review do not take into account the more general beneficial
role grandparents may play in their grandchildren’s lives. Grandparents may be better able to
spend time with their grandchildren in ways that parents are unable to. This can help facilitate
good social and emotional wellbeing in grandchildren, and therefore, any recommendation to
limit grandparent interaction with their grandchildren would be misplaced. Instead, as sug-
gested by results from the Growing Up in Scotland cohort studies [33], parenting advice and
support needs to be broadened to encompass grandparents as well as parents. Grandparents’
roles must be recognised and practical steps put in place to facilitate optimal intergenerational
parenting. In some studies, there were hints that tensions could arise between parents and
grandparents, with little suggestion of how communication between generations could be
enhanced to ensure that shared understandings around parenting could be realised. In addi-
tion, there were no interventions identified that sought to encompass grandparents as a poten-
tial mechanism through which to improve grandchildren’s diets. With the caring role of
grandparents now being recognised within the UK legislation and benefits system, and the
expectation that grandparents’ involvement in their grandchildren’s lives will only increase,
there is a need for theoretically grounded interventions to be designed that include significant
communication-based components.
Strengths and limitations
This study has integrated the evidence-base on the impact of grandparents on grandchildren’s
cancer risk factors. Cancer research has focused more on treatment of disease rather than the
full range of factors that might play a role in cancer prevention over the life course. The review
therefore took a broad approach to the types of evidence considered for syntheses, with quali-
tative literature synthesised through a thematic analysis of participant quotations and author

 analyses. A thorough quality appraisal also took place using appropriate tools for each of the
study types included. A larger proportion of qualitative studies were rated as lower quality
compared with quantitative studies.
While the review used a range of key databases to identify relevant articles, it did not ask
authors or experts to identify additional studies, and did not include findings from the grey lit-
erature. In addition, non-English language studies were not included, which limits the applica-
bility of the review findings across cultures. An additional limitation was that many studies
contained only a limited description of grandparents’ impact, and/or provided little indication
of the extent to which the amount of time grandchildren spent with grandparents was associ-
ated with more adverse outcomes or behaviours.
Conclusion
The weight of the evidence within this review found that grandparents had an adverse impact
on their grandchildren’s cancer risk factors. Future work should focus on realising the poten-
tial for grandparents to be a positive influence on their grandchildren’s health through the
design of realistic, theoretically underpinned interventions. Interventions should ideally
include components that aid facilitating family communication around areas of tension. The
formative stages of this work should include the perspectives of both grandparents and grand-
children to enhance the likelihood of success.
