Aggression*

Abstract
Sexually active men, who are not in a monogamous relationship, may be at a greater risk for 
violence than men who are sexually active within monogamous relationships and men who are not 
sexually active. The current study examines changes in sexual behavior and violence in 
adolescence to early adulthood. Data on male (n = 4,597) and female (n = 5,523) respondents were 
drawn from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (Add 
Health). HLM regression models indicate that men who transition to a monogamous, or less 
competitive, mode of sexual behavior (fewer partners since last wave), reduce their risk for 
violence. The same results were not replicated for females. Further, results were not accounted for 
by marital status or other more readily accepted explanations of violence. Findings suggest that 
competition for sex be further examined as a potential cause of male violence.
Introduction
Since its publication, Sampson and Laub’s (1990) landmark study of previously incarcerated 
males has generated a flurry of research on marriage and crime. This research generally 
finds that after men marry they report less criminal behavior, are less likely to be arrested or 
incarcerated, and are less involved with drugs and deviant peer groups (see Blokland and 
Schipper, 2016 for a recent review). Marriage also demands of men that they no longer 
compete against one another for sexual partners, which historically has been a source of 
male aggression and continues to engender conflict (Campbell, 2005; Betzig, 1986; Buss, 
2006; Keegan, 2004; van der Dennen, 1995).
The current study augments prior life course related theories (e.g., Laub and Sampson, 2003) 
by discussing sex, in addition to marriage, in relationship to violent behavior. While prior 
research shows that marriage may indeed reduce male criminal offending, there are at least 
two problems posed by focusing on marital unions in criminological research. The first 
problem is demographic. The median age of first-time marriage in the United States is about

 26 for women and 28 for men (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Desistence from criminal 
behavior, on the other hand, typically begins in mid to late adolescence (Gottfredson and 
Hirschi, 1990). Early marriages may reduce involvement in crime and violence (e.g., 
Siennick et al., 2014; Theobald and Farrington, 2010); however, this subset of unions is not 
statistically representative of the youth population. Furthermore, cohabitation has come to 
replace marriage in recent decades as the type of union many young people engage in during 
their early adult years (Smock, 2000; Lesthaeghe and Neidert, 2006); yet rates of violent 
crime have declined despite this major social change (Zimring, 2006).
A second problem, related but not specific to the research on marriage, is that most 
criminological studies that have examined intimate relationships among adolescents and 
young adults have focused heavily on the qualities of a single union (Capaldi, Hyoun, and 
Owen, 2008; Eklund, Kerr, Stattin, 2010; Haynie et al., 2005; Giordano et al., 2010; 
McCarthy and Casey, 2008). Criminologists who conduct peer research by comparison 
rarely focus on the influence of a single friendship, even though these dyads tend to be 
longer lived than dating relationships (Giordano, 2003; Warr, 2002). While this singular 
focus makes sense in the context of marriage and perhaps cohabitation, it is far less 
applicable when studying youthful populations and patterns of sexual behavior. Over the 
course of adolescence and early adulthood, individuals will likely experience multiple 
intimate relationships. Relatively high levels of sexual exclusivity and emotional attachment 
may characterize some of these relationships, while others may be more fleeting as well as 
sexually non-exclusive (Manning, Longmore, and Giordano, 2005).
The perspective brought to bear on the data is grounded in research on evolved differences 
between the sexes (e.g., Darwin, 1871; Buss, 2003; Puts, 2010; Trivers, 1972; Zahavi, 1975). 
As a general rule of sexual behavior, also known as Bateman’s principle (1948), males often 
attempt to have sex frequently and with a variety of partners if given the opportunity, while 
females by comparison are more judicious in selecting partners and will reject sexual 
advances under a variety of circumstances, individual and cultural variation notwithstanding 
(Brown et al., 2009). A consequence of these divergent strategies is that males may need to 
compete against other males for a chance to be selected by a female. Sexual competition 
therefore holds the potential for violence, particularly when the romantic and sexual interests 
of one man are at odds with another.
Women are also competing for desirable partners, and whose choice of partners may play a 
significant role in the link between sex and violence. Men who show a willingness to take 
risks, have a high self-esteem, and a body that is physically imposing possess qualities that 
women may find desirable, but these qualities are also correlated with aggressive behavior 
(Apicella, 2014; Brewer and Howarth, 2012; Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Sell et al., 2009; 
Baumeister, Smart, and Boden, 1996). A broadly held preference among women for partners 
who embody these qualities may result in physically aggressive men being favored for sex. 
Thus because of female biases in mate selection, it follows that any observed link between 
men’s sexual behavior and their involvement in violence may be explained not as a direct 
result of men competing, but rather as a by-product of women choosing men on the basis of 
qualities which happen to correlate with physical aggression.

 There is also the possibility that male competition and female choice conspire to create the 
link between sex and violence. If aggressive behavior in men is correlated with qualities that 
women find desirable, all that is needed for an aggressive competition to ensue is for young 
women to exercise a preference for desirable men, and for men to want sex. From this 
perspective both genders are culpable for the link between sexual behavior and violence—
men for competing against each other for sexual partners and women for choosing the most 
desirable competitors. Monogamy offers men an escape from this unwitting conspiracy and 
is therefore central to the issues being explored in the current study.
The current study integrates prior research on sexual competition and violence with findings 
from criminology to advance a competition-violence hypothesis. It states that sexually active 
men, who are not in a monogamous relationship, are in competition against other men for 
access to females, and when challenged by a rival, denied access by a third party, or 
humiliated men may seek violent retribution. Women, by selecting partners on a non-random 
basis, play a central role in men’s competition for sex that inadvertently and 
disproportionately favors men who have a history of violence as well as the potential for 
being violent in the future. Transitioning to a monogamous, or less competitive, mode of 
sexual behavior may reduce men’s risk for violence. The hypothesis is tested in a 
longitudinal sample of males and females over a period of about twelve years. The current 
study looks to Thomas Hobbes’s (1651) principle causes of quarrel, routine activities theory 
(Cohen and Felson, R, 1979; Felson, M and Boba, 2009), as well as sexual selection theory 
(Darwin, 1871; Puts, 2010; Trivers, 1972; Zahavi, 1975) to expound on the competition-
violence hypothesis.
Background
Prior evidence linking men’s sexual behavior to violence can be found in research that varies 
in method and approach. Historians and anthropologists note that competition for wives and 
conflict over adulterous behavior is chief among the reasons for primitive warfare in non-
state and tribal societies (Betzig, 1986; Keegan, 2004; van der Dennen, 1995). While 
modern governments may no longer endorse sexual jealousy as a justification for war, men’s 
participation in violence often has a sexual motive, which is clearly present in cases of 
homicide throughout the industrialized world. Daly and Wilson (1988), for example, in a 
comprehensive analysis of homicide, conclude that sexual jealousy and competition among 
males are motivating factors in a large proportion of cases. Buss (2006) reports similar 
findings in research that asked a large sample of culturally diverse participants to describe 
scenarios in which they might want to kill someone (or may be killed). A reoccurring theme 
in the participants’ narratives often concerned sex and intimate relationships in which there 
was infidelity, a jilted lover, and the pursuit of justice to right these wrongs. Finally, research 
into the social behavior of men and women in bars and nightclubs confirms what was long 
suspected about violence in and around these places, that incidents are especially likely to 
occur when the romantic and sexual interests of different parties conflict (Graham et al., 
2014, 2011, 2010).
The notion that one’s sexual and romantic interests may be linked to violence is also 
supported by research that employs experimental designs. Research conducted by Ariely and 
Seffrin

 Loewenstein (2006) suggests that when men are aroused by the prospect of a sexual 
encounter they may behave more aggressively toward rival males as well as female partners, 
lending credibility to the notion that acts of violence are experienced by perpetrators as 
“crimes of passion” and seem to happen in the “heat of the moment”. Ainsworth and Maner 
(2012) present similar findings that males, but not females, are more likely to act out in an 
aggressive manner towards other males after being primed by researchers to think about 
sexual encounters. Furthermore, Thompson et al. (2006) finds that men, after being exposed 
to arginine vasopressin— a peptide thought to be linked to aggression and sexual arousal in 
men— exhibit facial expressions that are angrier and more threatening than controls and 
perceive less friendliness in the faces of other men. The women in this study, by contrast, 
reacted to the same peptide with friendlier facial expressions and perceived less animosity in 
the faces of other women. Collectively, these studies suggest that situations in which men’s 
sexual and romantic interests are at the forefront are the very situations in which violent 
behavior is likely to occur.
Male Competition
While violence and the situations in which it occurs are well documented, there are no 
established criminological theories for linking sexual competition to observed patterns of 
violence. Hobbes’s (1651) principle causes of quarrel continue to be widely discussed in the 
literature on violence (Pinker, 2011), and because of their general applicability, they serve as 
a useful starting place for unpacking the competition-violence hypothesis. Consider 
Hobbes’s first cause of quarrel, which is in fact competition. This first cause, applied to 
sexual competition, may be understood from a “routine activities” perspective on crime, 
which is focused on the interplay of motivated offenders, suitable targets, and capable 
guardians (Cohen and Felson, R. 1979; Felson, M. and Boba, 2009). Here the motivated 
offender is a male, who targets females that he believes will be receptive to his advances. He 
may be blocked, however, in pursing this goal by a guardian, who prevents his access, or by 
a rival male who has taken his place. If he persists despite resistance from third parties, 
violent confrontation may result (Parks et al., 2013).
Violence resulting from sexual competition may also be embedded within a longer timeline 
of events and may not be resolved in a single incident. As Buss’s (2006) research on 
homicide suggests, men may stew over a perceived indiscretion that kept them achieving 
their romantic or sexual goals, but then an opportunity arises to balance the scales of justice. 
In the mind of the aggrieved party, justice is achieved through violent retribution, but from 
the perspective of his rivals justice will not be done until this aggression is repaid in kind. 
This much is true of violence generally, which can produce vicious cycles of revenge, 
despite its initial causes being trivial and sometimes sexual in nature (Black, 1983; Harris, 
2003; Kanazawa and Still, 2000; Katz, 1988; Wolfgang, Ferracuti, and Mannheim, 1967).
Hobbes’s two other principle causes of quarrel are fear and reputation. Reputation, or honor, 
is a re-occurring theme in the research on violence. Ethnographic descriptions of urban 
crime, studies on the differences in violent crime rates between northern and southern states, 
and historical analyses of violence all emphasize honor, and the fear of being dishonored or 
victimized, as a basis of male aggression (e.g., Anderson, 2000; Eisner, 2003; Elias, 1978;

 Nisbett and Cohen, 1996; Ruff, 2001). Fear and reputation may also play a role in the 
violence that is associated with sexual competition. The injury to honor that men may feel 
for failing to defend a current or potential partner against the sexual advances of rival men 
may give rise to retaliatory violence, to restore one’s reputation, as well as preemptive 
violence, for fear that the offense may happen again or simply to keep it from happening in 
the first place (Black, 1983; Felson, 1997; Mullins, Wright, and Jacobs, 2004).
Female Choice
While sexual competition may be important for explaining male aggression, female choice 
plays an integral role. Men who would use physical violence to gain a competitive advantage 
may possess other qualities that are sexually appealing to women, at least in the short-term. 
This much has been suggested in research by Rebellon and Manasse (2004) who found that 
highly delinquent males report relative success in attracting female dating partners. Rebellon 
and Manasse (2004) interpret these findings using a derivative of sexual selection theory 
known as the “handicap principle” (Zahavi, 1975). The handicap principle suggests that 
behaviors that are potentially costly to males—such as fighting and showing disregard for 
authority, but which are valued by females, perhaps for the strength and bravado they 
symbolize—will be implemented as tactics in male sexual competition (see also Palmer and 
Tilley 1995). Research on sexual selection theory also suggests that a preference for these 
qualities may have itself been selected for in females (Puts, 2010). This would help to 
explain why men have a penchant for violent behavior in the first place, in the sense that 
male aggression, and a preference for it among females, were selected for in the course of 
human prehistory.
Partnering with an aggressive and/or criminally involved male may have its advantages, 
especially in an unsafe environment where threats of violence are commonplace. Yet 
displays of dominance and physical aggression play just as well to an all male audience, 
who serve as a source of encouragement and validation, thereby reinforcing the behavior as 
well as its symbolic value in the peer culture (Messerschmidt, 1993). Furthermore, qualities 
in males that are correlated with aggressive behavior, such as confidence, bravado, and an 
athletic physique, may be attractive to women in the short-term, but in the long-term these 
are not necessarily the same qualities that women look for in a spouse or that would sustain 
a committed relationship (Buss, 2003).
Women’s choice of partners is further constrained by unfavorable economic conditions 
which can make men less desirable as marital partners (Wilson, 2011), and the sex ratio 
itself (Barber, 2009; Walsh, 2003), which may contain few men relative to the number of 
women, thus favoring men’s preference for frequent sex with a variety of partners, for which 
they may face competition from other men who are similarly inclined. And so without 
purpose or malicious intent, and while acting within the constraints of their environments, 
men and women conspire to make the pursuit of sex and romance a potentially violent affair.
Desistance
Desistance from sexual competition, and the violence that it produces, may require men to 
reassess definitions of what it means to act manly (Carlsson, 2013; Giordano, 2014; Rocque, 
Seffrin

 Posick, and Paternoster, 2016; Messerschmidt,1993; Simons and Barr, 2014). Men, after all, 
do not pursue sexual opportunities endlessly as Batman’s principle might suggest. Men play 
more conventional heterosexual roles as well, such as husband, father, and reliable partner 
and provider. These role transformations however, like the pro-social effect of marriage 
itself, may depend on the level of commitment within relationships as well as a general 
departure from competitive modes of sexual behavior, which may prove difficult for men 
who feel that long-term relationships are inaccessible because of their poor economic status 
and/or inexperience with stable heterosexual unions (Parker and Reckenwald, 2008). 
Nevertheless, prior research shows that young males commit fewer delinquent acts while in 
a romantic relationship with a loved partner, but sex outside of relationships increases the 
risk of criminal offending (McCarthy and Casey, 2008). Further, males who do not begin a 
new relationship shortly after breaking up with a girlfriend increase their risk of future 
criminal offending (Laursen and Sweeten, 2012).
The break-up effect, noted previously, may highlight that newly single males are likely 
competing again for female partners, possibly in high risk places, such as bars, nightclubs, 
and parties, where social barriers are less defined and authority figures lacking (e.g., 
Leonard, Quigley, and Collins, 2002; Kim, 2013; Miller, 2012; Miller et al., 2005; Osgood 
and Anderson, 2004; Pridemore and Grubesic, 2011). Thus, changes in men’s sexual 
behavior may signal changes in their routine activities, and more importantly in their 
willingness to compete for female partners, thereby making them vulnerable to Hobbesian 
quarreling, selective female biases, and ultimately a greater risk of violent confrontation.
Current Study
The current study examines sexual behavior and violence in a longitudinal sample of males 
and females. The analyses are focused primarily on males, although results are also 
presented for females. The effects of sexual behavior are compared to other, more readily 
accepted, explanations of violence. Drug and alcohol use may increase the likelihood of 
violence, especially when used in social contexts such as parties and nightclubs, where 
relaxed social norms are paired with opportunities for males to make sexual advances 
(Graham et al., 2014, 2011, 2010). Childhood trauma, emotional attachment to caregivers, 
and local risk factors have also been shown to influence patterns of violence and risky sexual 
behavior (Harris, 2003; MacMillan 2001; Maimon and Browning, 2012; Widom, 2000). 
Retrospective reports of childhood physical and sexual abuse are controlled in the regression 
models, as are community levels of poverty and the proportion of unmarried males and 
females (Parker and Reckenwald, 2008; Porter and Purser, 2010). Emotional attachment to 
caregivers is controlled for in wave 1 of the data. Finally, marriage and full-time 
employment, which prior research suggests may deter men from criminal behavior, are 
controlled for in all waves (Laub and Sampson, 2003; Uggen, 2000).
The competition –violence hypothesis makes five statements that are tested in the analyses 
to follow:
1.
Changing to a monogamous, or less competitive, mode of sexual behavior (fewer 
partners since last wave), reduces violence.

 2.
Changing to a more competitive mode of sexual behavior (multiple partners 
since last wave), increases violence.
3.
Men with a history of violence are selected for sex more often than their less 
aggressive peers.
4.
Both male competition and female choice contribute to the link between sex and 
violence.
5.
The influence of sexual behavior on violence cannot be accounted for by marital 
status or any other more readily accepted explanation of violent behavior.
Data
The National Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (Add Health) is the data source for the 
current study.1 The Add Health study is a nationally representative sample of adolescent 
youth containing four waves of longitudinal data. The sampling frame consisted of all high 
schools in the United States. A sample of 80 high schools and 52 middle schools was 
selected with unequal probability of selection. Respondents from grades 7 through 12 were 
initially surveyed during the 1994–1995 academic year. Waves 1 thru 4 of the restricted 
version of this dataset were used in the current study. The analytic sample includes males (n 
= 4,597) and females (n = 5,523) who participated in all four waves of the data. Fifty-four 
and one-half percent of the analytic sample is White/non-Hispanic; 19.5% African 
American/Black; 16% Hispanic/Latino; 7% Asian; 3% other.
Measures
Violence is measured with a 4-item index that asks respondents how often they have pulled a 
knife or gun on someone, seriously injured someone in a fight, gotten into a group fight, and 
shot or stabbed someone. These four items were selected because they appear in all waves of 
the data. Violence items were coded as “0” or “1” to eliminate differences in measurement 
and then summed to create a 5-point index, range 0–4 (see Table 1). While some of the 
violence items were originally coded dichotomously, with “yes” or “no” responses, other 
items were de facto dichotomous due to the high degree of right-skew in the distributions, 
and were re-coded as such. The violence index is therefore an approximate indicator of 
one’s ranking on an underlying continuum of violence potential, with high scores suggesting 
involvement in violence that is varied in type (some incidents more serious than others) and 
occurs with some regularity.
Sexual behavior is measured in terms of different modes, with each mode represented by a 
dichotomous or discrete variable. In waves 2–4 of the data, respondents were asked how 
many sexual partners they had since the last interview. In wave 1, the number of lifetime sex 
partners was recorded. Respondents reporting zero sex partners represent the sexually non-

Adolescent to Adult Health: Research Design [WWW document]. URL: http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/design. The 
sampling weight variables provided by Add Health were not used in this study due to the use of male and female subsamples and the 
implementation of hierarchical linear models that account for the complex error structure in the data. Missing cases for certain 
variables constituted less than two percent of the analytic sample. The mean was imputed for the census-block variables, percent 
below the poverty line and percent never married, while zero was imputed for all other variables with missing cases and was 
interpreted as ‘no evidence for the behavior in question’

 active mode. Virgins were included in the non-active mode. Respondents with one sex 
partner represent the monogamous mode, and respondents with more than one sex partner 
represent the competitive mode. The competitive mode is further decomposed into 
categories of 2–3 partners (low competitive), 4–5 partners (mid competitive), and 6 or more 
partners (highly competitive). The highly competitive mode makes up a small but consistent 
percentage of the sample in each wave (3–4 percent), however large enough to be treated as 
a discrete variable. Sexual behavior is therefore represented with variables that are mutually 
exclusive and exhaustive of the sex partner variable. Furthermore, while the number of 
sexual partners reported is an imperfect proxy for degrees of competitiveness, the concept is 
similar to dating/mating effort, or the extent to which individuals express interest and 
involvement in dating and sex, which is shown in prior research to be predictive of 
delinquent behavior (Rowe et al., 1997; Seffrin et al., 2009).
Marriage is measured with a dichotomous indicator. In waves 3 and 4 of the data, 
respondents indicated the month and year in which they were married. Respondents were 
coded as being married in waves 1–4, provided they were married for at least twelve months 
at the time of the interview. In each wave, respondents were recorded as employed if they 
indicated current and fulltime employment, defined as working 35 hours or more in a week.
Drug use is measured with a 4-item index that asks respondents how often, since the last 
interview, have they used marijuana, cocaine, injection drugs, and hallucinogens or other 
drugs. In wave 1, lifetime drug use was recorded. These four items were selected because 
they appear in all waves of the data. Drug items were coded as “0” or “1” to eliminate 
differences in measurement and then summed to create a 5-point index, range 0–4. Similar 
to the violence items, several of the drug items were de facto dichotomous due to the high 
degree of right-skew in the distribution, and were re-coded as such. Alcohol use 
“drunkenness” is measured with a single item which ranges from 0 “never” to 6 “almost 
every day” and asks respondents how often in the past 12 months they got drunk. This item 
appears in all waves of the data.
Childhood abuse is measured with two items that appear in wave 3 of the data. These items 
refer to experiences that occurred prior to the 6th grade. Respondents were asked how often a 
parent or caregiver hit, kicked, or slapped them (i.e., physical abuse), and how often they 
were forced to engage in sexual relations with a parent or caregiver (i.e., sexual abuse). Each 
item ranges 0 “never” to 5 “more than ten times.” Attachment to caregivers is measured with 
a 6-item scale, recorded in wave 1 of the data. Respondents were asked if they feel that their 
mother, father, caregiver are warm and loving, cares about them, and how close they are to 
mother, father, and/or other caregiver. Each item ranges 1 “not at all” to 5 “very much.” 
Cronbach’s alpha for the scale is 0.81.
Local risk factors are measured with two items that appear in wave 1 of the data. The 
percent of residents living below the poverty line and percent of never married adults were 
recorded in the census-block groups where respondents were living shortly before the time 
of the wave 1 interview.

 Age is measured in years, and months is measured as the number of months since the wave 1 
interview. The longitudinal design of the current study requires that time-varying 
observations are demarcated in terms of the length of time that has elapsed between waves. 
Thus at wave 1, months equals “0” for all respondents, but then varies between respondents 
in the three subsequent follow-up interviews, depending on the respondents’ respective 
interview dates. Further, the months variable was logged before being entered into the 
regression analyses (Singer and Willet, 2003).
Analytic Strategy
Descriptive statistics are presented for the male sample in Table 1. Results from longitudinal 
HLM regression models are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Fixed and random effects are used 
to statistically control for the influence of individual characteristics that are relatively stable 
over time but which may be correlated with variations in violence and sexual behavior (e.g., 
Gottfredson and Hirschi’s conception of ‘low self-control’).2 Within-individual and 
between-individual effects for sexual behavior are presented in Tables 2 and 3, along with 
control variables. Within-individual components are created by subtracting each 
respondent’s average on X (the between-individual average) from each time-ordered 
observation of X. This technique allows the within-individual components to be interpreted 
as fixed effect regression estimates, as change in the dependent variable caused by a change 
in an independent variable (Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002). Once within-individual effects are 
statistically controlled, the between-individual effects for sexual competitiveness suggest the 
degree to which violent males are successful at attracting sexual partners, or likewise, the 
degree to which non-violence is associated with monogamous commitment. However, given 
that women usually choose who they have sex with, a statistically significant link between 
violence and male sexual behavior would suggest a bias among females for sexual partners 
who happen to be relatively aggressive. If both within-individual and between-individual 
effects for sexual behavior are statistically significant, this would suggest that male 
competition, as well as female choice, contribute to the link between sex and violence.
Results
Table 1 shows the distribution of modes of male sexual behavior in each wave of the data. 
Participation in the highly competitive mode (6 or more partners) remains fairly constant, 
with roughly 4 percent of males involved in this mode over the course of the study. The 
same goes for mid-level competitiveness (4–5 partners), whereas participation in low levels

 of competitiveness (2–3 partners) rises from about 9 percent in wave 1 to 18 percent in wave 
4. Monogamous involvement (1 partner) also increases over time, with about 8 percent 
monogamous in wave 1 and 53 percent in wave 4. Participation in the non-active mode (0 
partners) decreases over time, with about 75 percent non-active in wave 1, down to 17.4 
percent in wave 4.
Table 2 presents a longitudinal HLM regression analysis that includes both between-
individual and within-individual effects for the different modes of sexual behavior. Model 1 
compares the highly competitive mode to all other modes of sexual behavior. Findings 
suggest that when boys and young men transition from a highly competitive mode of sexual 
behavior to one that is monogamous violence declines by 0.312 points on a 5-point index. 
Transitioning from monogamy to a highly competitive mode increases violence by the same 
amount (result not shown). Violence also declines when men transition from a highly 
competitive mode to one that less competitive or non-active.
Model 2 controls for marital status and employment, drug and alcohol use, childhood abuse 
and attachment to caregivers, poverty, and the proportion of never married adults in the 
respondents’ census-block group. The interaction term (marriage × months) is also included 
in the model to account for the time-sensitive effect of marriage found in prior research (e.g., 
Theobald and Farrington, 2010). Marriage is shown here to reduce violence (b = −0.201), 
but according to the positive and significant interaction term ‘marriage × months’ (b = 
0.049) its effect on violence diminishes the later men wait to marry. Employment status is 
not statistically significant. Drug use, drunkenness, and childhood abuse are all statistically 
significant whereas attachment to caregivers is not. Local levels of poverty are significant, 
whereas percent never married is not. All together these more readily accepted explanations 
of violence explain only about five additional percentage points in the overall variation in 
violence. Further, the effect of monogamy is reduced in size, but remains statistically 
significant, net of these controls.3
The significant between-individual effects indicate that men with little history of violence 
are more likely to be monogamous or non-active than competitive, whereas men with 
extensive histories of violent behavior are more likely to be highly competitive than 
monogamous or non-active. Both within-individual and between-individual effects are 
statistically significant, which suggests that female choice also plays a role in linking sex to 
violence. More specifically, the models suggest that women are more likely to have sex with 
men who have been violent in the past, and may be violent in the future, than with men who 
are less physically aggressive.
Post-Hoc Analysis
Post-hoc analyses were conducted to examine whether and to what degree the research 
hypotheses apply to women and how prior sexual experience may influence the link between 
3The results from the HLM models were compared to results from a GEE logit model (general estimating equation), fit for repeated 
observations as well as to a general linear model for estimating fixed effects. The “genmod” SAS procedure produced the GEE model 
estimates. The SAS “general linear model” procedure was used to estimate the fixed effects regression parameters. The SAS “mixed” 
procedure was used to estimate the HLM regression parameters shown in Tables 2 and 3. Results from these alternative models were 
nearly identical to that of the HLM models.

 sex and violence. Table 3 shows results for male and female respondents who were already 
sexually active at the time of the wave 1 interview (i.e., at least one lifetime sexual partner 
reported), as well as results for respondents who were sexual virgins at the time of wave 1. 
The former of these two groups constitutes a subset of respondents who are sexually 
precocious compared to their peers, which according to prior research may indicate an 
increased risk for delinquent behavior (e.g., Downing and Bellis, 2009). Results for virgin 
males and males who were sexually active at wave 1 are similar to each other and to the 
results shown in Table 2. However for sexually active females the within-individual effects 
are not statistically significant. Marriage is non-significant for precocious males, and non-
significant for females in both models.
When the sample is limited to virgin females, changes in sexual behavior are found to have a 
significant relationship with violence, which may suggest that peer networks and routine 
activities have also changed to include hanging out with boys and partying (e.g., McGloin 
and DiPietro, 2013). The more precocious females, on the other hand, may have already 
made these transitions and may not compete as males do for sexual partners. Further, the 
significant between-individual effects for virgin females suggest that physically aggressive 
women have more sexual partners, on average, than less aggressive women, which is similar 
to what was found for men, however the same findings do not hold consistent for sexually 
precocious females.
Discussion of Findings
Sex is a defining feature of intimate relationships as well as a source of violent conflict, yet 
prior research on criminal desistance has ignored the influence of sexual behavior, focusing 
instead on marriage and employment to explain changes in criminal offending. Findings 
from the current study indicate that males, who transition to a less competitive mode of 
sexual behavior as evidenced by a reduction in sex partners from previous waves, reduced 
their risk for violent behavior. Changes in sexual behavior were shown to be more consistent 
and stronger in predicting violence than marriage and employment. The pro-social effect of 
marriage was not explained by changes in sexual behavior however, which suggests that 
marriage reduces male aggression for reasons other than monogamous commitment (e.g., 
Laub and Sampson, 2003). Findings also indicate that violent men tend to have more sexual 
partners than men who are less aggressive, which suggests that female choice, in addition to 
male competition, plays a role in linking sexual behavior to violence. The same findings 
were not replicated for females. This suggests that female competition does not carry the 
same potential for violence as male competition, if for no other reason than the fact that men 
are competing against other men, and women against women (Felson, 1996). As prior 
research suggests, in a competition for desirable partners, the malicious actions that transpire 
between women are more likely to take the form of psychological rather than physical 
aggression, such as manipulation and character assassination (Archer, 2004; Salmivalli and 
Kaukiainen, 2004; Vaillancourt, 2013). Furthermore, the results of the analyses were drawn 
from longitudinal data, which controlled for changes in drug and alcohol use as well as early 
childhood factors that may have accounted for the sex-violence link, but did not. Thus, the 
findings of this study are in support of the research hypotheses and suggest that competition 
for sex be further examined as a potential cause of male violence.

 Limitations and Directions for Future Research
The current study is limited in several respects, foremost by the ambiguity introduced when 
attempting to interpret changes in sexual behavior. While changes in sexual behavior were 
shown to have a statistically significant influence on changes in violence, the data cannot say 
for sure that sexual competition is the reason why. For a male to accumulate a relatively high 
number of sexual partners in a short time suggests competition—fighting and wrangling 
with other men—although the same outcome could be achieved with little to no violence. 
Further, a growing body of research suggests that, rather than marriage and monogamous 
unions affecting violence, the relationship may also work the other way around, with crime 
and antisocial behavior affecting union formation and stability (Barnes et al., 2014; Bersani 
and Doherty, 2013; Lyngstad and Skardhamar, 2013). Unfortunately, detailed information on 
specific relationships was limited to a small sample of sexual partners, making it difficult to 
discern why some of the men became monogamous while others did not. More research is 
needed here on the conditions that push men and women in and out of committed 
relationships as it may relate to involvement in crime and violence.
A second set of limitations concerns the treatment of sexual behavior as an independent 
influence on violence, although prior research suggests that both behaviors may be 
influenced by the same social conditions. Men with a history of violence often have unstable 
and short-term relationships with women and come disproportionately from segments of 
society that have been marginalized by poverty and racial segregation (Wilson, 2011). 
Although marriage and monogamous relationships may offer men a healthier lifestyle, these 
are long-term and costly investments, whose formation and stability may therefore depend 
on life being predictable and free of violence (Daly and Wilson, 2005). Furthermore, high 
crime rates and staggering levels of unemployment can make marriage and monogamous 
relationships inaccessible to men who would otherwise benefit from a stable heterosexual 
union. A more inclusive theory of sex and violence will need to pay special attention to 
high-risk and marginalized groups of men and women who live under conditions of legal 
and economic dysfunction.
The current study was also focused primarily on male behavior; however women are not 
passive agents in the arena of sexual competition. Campbell (1995) for example explains that 
women may become violent when defending a male partner from the sexual advances of a 
rival female. Women can also be the victims of competitive male aggression, especially if 
they are believed to have been unfaithful to a partner (Archer, 2014; Capaldi et al., 2012). 
Further, the hypothesis that females prefer males who possess qualities which happen to 
correlate with aggressive behavior was tested through indirect means by examining the 
between-individual effects of male sexual behavior on violence. A more direct test of this 
hypothesis would require an assessment of women’s preferences in men as well as the 
situations in which they may be likely to partner with an aggressive male. Finally, women’s 
risk of criminal involvement is disproportionately affected by male associates (McGloin and 
DiPietro, 2013). Co-offending occurs frequently among youthful offenders, and for women 
in particular, criminal involvement often involves male co-offenders (Warr, 2002). The 
female gender and the composition of peer networks should be considered more thoroughly 
in future research on crime and intimate relationships.

 The violence analyzed in the current study is self-reported, along with most all of the other 
measures, and is almost certainly non-lethal. However incidents of non-lethal violence are 
relatively high in the same places and within the same socio-demographic groups that have 
high homicide rates and official crime statistics are generally correlated with self-reports 
(Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990; Zimring, 2006). Thus, the competition-violence hypothesis, 
by focusing on sex in addition to marriage, suggests a broader scope of behavior for 
criminologists to consider in future research on violence and criminal desistance.
