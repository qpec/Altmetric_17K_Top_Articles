Rates and Trends of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia — 
United States, 2001–2014

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent 
cancer among children and adolescents in the United States, 
representing 20% of all cancers diagnosed in persons aged 
<20 years, or >3,000 new cases each year (1). Past studies 
reported increasing trends of ALL overall and among Hispanics, 
but these represented ≤28% of the U.S. population and did 
not provide state-based estimates (1–3). To describe U.S. ALL 
incidence rates and trends among persons aged <20 years during 
2001–2014, CDC analyzed rigorous data (based on established 
publication criteria) from the United States Cancer Statistics data 
set, which includes incidence data on approximately 15,000 new 
cases per year of all types of invasive cancer among children and 
adolescents aged <20 years (4). The data set represented 98% of 
the U.S. population during the study period. Overall incidence 
of pediatric ALL during 2001–2014 was 34.0 cases per 1 mil-
lion persons and among all racial/ethnic groups was highest 
among Hispanics (42.9 per 1 million). Both overall and among 
Hispanics, pediatric ALL incidence increased during 2001–2008 
and remained stable during 2008–2014. ALL incidence was 
higher in the West than in any other U.S. Census region. State-
specific data indicated that the highest rates of pediatric ALL 
incidence were in California, New Mexico, and Vermont. These 
demographic and geographic ALL incidence data might better 
inform public health interventions targeting the following areas: 
exposures to recognized risk factors for leukemia; ALL treatment, 
including clinical trial enrollment; survivorship care planning; 
and studies designed to understand the factors affecting changes 
in pediatric cancer incidence.
The United States Cancer Statistics data set includes can-
cer incidence data from CDC’s National Program of Cancer 
Registries and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program (4). Data on new cases 
of cancer diagnosed during 2001–2014 were obtained from 
population-based cancer registries affiliated with the National 
Program of Cancer Registries or Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results programs. Incidence data for all registries 
except the District of Colombia, Mississippi, and Nevada 
met United States Cancer Statistics publication criteria during 
2001–2014, and represented 98% of the U.S population.* This 
* Cancer registries’ incidence data met the following five United States Cancer
Statistics criteria: 1) ≤5% of cases ascertained solely on the basis of death
certificate; 2) ≤3% of cases missing information on sex; 3) ≤3% of cases missing
information on age; 4) ≤5% of cases missing information on race; and 5) ≥97% 
of registry’s records passed a set of single-field and inter-field computerized edits 
that test the validity and logic of data components. https://nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/.
report includes cases diagnosed among children and adoles-
cents aged <20 years and includes International Classification 
of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition† codes 9728–9729, 
9811–9818, and 9835–9837 as grouped by the International 
Classification of Childhood Cancer.§ Cases were included if 
ALL was the first or only cancer diagnosed and was confirmed 
microscopically or by positive laboratory test or marker study. 
Recurrent cases of ALL were not included in this report.
Age-adjusted rates were calculated using statistical software. 
All rates were expressed per 1 million persons and were age-
adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population.¶ Age-adjusted 
incidence trends were quantified using annual percent change 
(APC) calculated using joinpoint regression. Statistically 
significant APCs were different from zero (p<0.05). A maxi-
mum of two joinpoints were used to determine a change of 
direction in trends during the study period. Rates and trends 
were estimated by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, state, U.S. 
Census region,** county-level economic status, and rural/
urban status.
During 2001–2014, a total of 38,136 new pediatric ALL 
cases were diagnosed in the United States (Table). Overall 
incidence of ALL was 34.0 cases per 1 million. Rates were 
highest in children aged 1–4 years (75.2 per 1 million) and were 
higher in males (38.0) than in females (29.7). Among all racial/
ethnic groups, the highest incidence rate (42.9 per 1 million) 
was among Hispanics, followed by non-Hispanic whites (34.2 
per 1 million). The lowest incidence (18.7) occurred among 
non-Hispanic blacks. Pediatric ALL incidence rates in the 25% 
of U.S. counties with the highest economic status were higher 
than rates in the 25% of counties with the lowest economic 
status and were higher in metropolitan areas with ≥1 million 
persons than in nonmetropolitan areas. Rates were highest in 
the West (38.5) followed by the Northeast (34.8), Midwest 
(32.4), and South (31.6) Census regions, and, among states, 
were highest in Vermont (41.9), California (40.8), and New

and among children aged 5–9 years and 10–14 years during
2001–2010 and 2001–2014, respectively, as well as in metro-
politan areas with populations ≥1 million during 2001–2008
(Table). Among Hispanics, rates increased during 2001–2008
(APC 2.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.3–4.7) and were stable
(nonsignificant decrease) during 2008–2014; pediatric ALL
incidence rates were stable in all other racial/ethnic groups. State-
specific analysis indicated that pediatric ALL incidence increased 
during all or part of 2001–2014 in four states: Alabama,
Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York (Supplementary
Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/47662).
Discussion
Consistent with other published data, this analysis found that 
rates of ALL were highest in males, children aged 1–4 years, and 
Hispanics (1). Rates varied by state and region and were high-
est in the West U.S. Census Region. This report, using more 
recent data with broader population coverage than past studies 
(1–3), confirms an increase in pediatric ALL overall and among 
Hispanics (2001–2008) and also documents a subsequent period 
of stable trends overall and among Hispanics (2008–2014).
High rates of pediatric ALL in the Hispanic population 
might explain high ALL rates in the West U.S. Census Region 
and in other specific states, given the high proportion of 
Hispanics in many of these areas.†† Past studies documenting 
increasing incidence of pediatric ALL in Hispanics focused

on earlier periods using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results database or the California Cancer Registry (2,3). 
Recent stable trends in ALL rates in Hispanic populations 
(2008–2014) might indicate a change after 2 decades of docu-
mented increasing trends. The cause for the higher rates of ALL 
in Hispanic populations and the increase during 2001–2008 
is unknown; however, past studies have evaluated such factors 
as genetic susceptibility, disproportionate environmental expo-
sure to household chemicals, or racial and ethnic disparities in 
parents’ exposures to chemicals at work (2,3). Other studies 
have hypothesized that the increasing trends in obesity among 
Hispanics might explain the increasing trends of ALL incidence 
among this population (2).
This report documents higher rates of ALL in persons 
aged <20 years living in counties in metropolitan areas with 
≥1 million population and in counties in the top 25th income 
percentile. Past studies of pediatric leukemia have investigated 
possible associations with higher economic status or increased 
exposure to air pollution that is often found in large metropoli-
tan areas (5,6). Etiologic studies examining potential causes 
of pediatric leukemia have documented associations between 
leukemia and exposures to solvents, traffic, pesticides, tobacco 
smoke, or radiation, or to specific nutritional exposures (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the District of Columbia, Mississippi, and Nevada 
were excluded because of incomplete trend data, which limits 
the representativeness of the results. Second, although the 
United States Cancer Statistics data publication standards 
yield high quality data, misclassifications of race and ethnic-
ity exist and might underestimate rates in American Indians, 
Alaska Natives, and Hispanics (8); ongoing procedures are 
used to ensure that this information is as accurate as pos-
sible. Third, the U.S. Census population estimates used in 
rate denominators might undercount some groups, including 
children and Hispanics, which could artificially raise incidence 
rates (3). Fourth, improvement in case ascertainment through 
advancements in electronic pathology reporting might affect 
trends: rates might appear to increase because current cancer 
registration methods are more accurately recording cases that 
were previously under-recorded. Finally, the possibility of a 
statistical error exists when analyzing subgroups with small 
numbers. Although APCs that are close to the significance 
cutoff might be truly significant, future studies will be needed 
to validate and monitor trends.
These recent state-based demographic cancer data can help 
local and national cancer control programs assess needs, allocate 
resources, and guide policy and public health strategies that 
can reduce cancer risk and improve the care of children and 
adolescents with ALL. Because cancer clinical trial participation 
has become an increasingly important part of quality clinical

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer 
in children and adolescents in the United States. Past studies 
using ≤28% population coverage have described increasing 
incidence of pediatric ALL, especially in Hispanic populations.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of data covering 98% of the U.S. population indicated 
that the incidence of pediatric ALL increased during 2001–2008 
overall and for Hispanics, but then was stable during 2008–
2014. The cause for the higher rates of ALL in Hispanic popula-
tions and the increase during 2001–2008 is unknown. Incidence 
of pediatric leukemia during 2001–2014 was highest in the West 
U.S. Census Region, possibly reflecting the high proportion of 
Hispanics in many of the region’s constituent states.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Increasing incidence of pediatric ALL in certain demographic 
groups might necessitate changes to cancer control planning, 
affecting treatment and survivorship care. Continued cancer 
surveillance will be important in guiding future research, 
including etiologic studies.
care (9), many state health departments have created cancer 
control plans that aim to address the economic and sociocul-
tural barriers that limit certain groups enrolling in these trials.§§ 
Knowledge about rates and trends of pediatric ALL might 
help tailor the goals of these programs to address local and 
disease-specific needs. In addition, as incidence and survival of 
pediatric ALL increase (1), public health professionals can use 
recent ALL incidence data to improve local cancer survivorship 
programs that address chronic disease management, screen for 
late effects, and provide resources to help patients maintain a 
high quality of life (10). Public health planners can prioritize 
issues pertinent to pediatric cancer survivors such as transi-
tioning to adult care and accessing the educational resources 
that might be available to these patients. Finally, health care 
professionals and researchers can use surveillance data to inform 
research questions. Continued surveillance data will be needed 
to further track incidence changes and public health needs 
relative to specific demographic groups and geographic areas.
