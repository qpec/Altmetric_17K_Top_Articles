sleep-wake cycle

Wakefulness is driven by the widespread release of neuromodulators by the ascending
arousal system. Yet, it is unclear how these substances orchestrate state-dependent,
global changes in neuronal activity. Here, we show that neuromodulators induce
increases in the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) in cortical slices electrically
silenced by tetrodotoxin. In vivo, arousal was linked to AMPA receptor–independent
elevations of [K+]e concomitant with decreases in [Ca2+]e, [Mg2+]e, [H+]e, and the
extracellular volume. Opposite, natural sleep and anesthesia reduced [K+]e while
increasing [Ca2+]e, [Mg2+]e, and [H+]e as well as the extracellular volume. Local
cortical activity of sleeping mice could be readily converted to the stereotypical
electroencephalography pattern of wakefulness by simply imposing a change in the
extracellular ion composition. Thus, extracellular ions control the state-dependent
patterns of neural activity.
W
akefulness and sleep represent two fun-
damentally different behavioral states
(1). While awake, we are responsive to
our surroundings, integrate sensory in-
put, recall memories, and make deci-
sions, whereas contact with the outside world is
limited during sleep. These two states of brain
activity show characteristic patterns of cortical
electroencephalography (EEG), gene expression,
and metabolic signature (2, 3). The concerted
release of neuromodulators—including norepi-
nephrine, acetylcholine, histamine, dopamine,
and orexin—mediates arousal (4). All of these
neuromodulators individually alter the mem-
brane properties, spiking activity, and intra-
cellular signaling pathways of subpopulations
of neurons and glia (5), but how they imple-
ment the striking stereotypic patterns of EEG
activity characterizing wakefulness versus sleep
is not understood (6).
Neuronal excitability can be modulated by
changes in the composition of extracellular ions.
For example, moderate elevations of [K+] in the
bath solution (1 to 2 mM) increase spontaneous
and evoked excitatory activity in hippocampal
slices, and more robust elevations (2 to 5 mM)
trigger seizure-like activity (7). Lowering extra-
cellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e) and extracellular Mg2+
([Mg2+]e) also potently alters excitability (7).
Neuromodulators increase extracellular
K+ independently of synaptic activity
It is not known whether the changes in extra-
cellular ion concentrations that occur during
the natural sleep-wake cycle (8) are primary or
secondary to alterations in electrical activity.
In fact, the changes in extracellular ions that
accompany behavioral states would be consid-
ered by most to be a consequence of different
patterns of neuronal activity. However, ion trans-
port is regulated by catecholamines outside
the central nervous system (CNS) (5). We asked
whether neuromodulators also regulate ion
transport in the CNS and thereby the concen-
tration of extracellular ions. We first recorded
extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) in corti-
cal slices prepared from adult mice using K+-
sensitive microelectrodes (K+-ISMs). Superfusion
of a cocktail of neuromodulators at a concen-
tration comparable with previous slice studies
containing norepinephrine, acetylcholine, do-
pamine, orexin, and histamine triggered a rapid
increase in [K+]e, averaging 0.43 ± 0.07 mM.
Surprisingly, blocking neuronal activity by ad-
dition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 mM) neither al-
tered basal [K+]e nor significantly suppressed
the neuromodulator cocktail–induced [K+]e in-
crease, despite completely blocking spontaneous
and evoked activity (Fig. 1). As a positive control,
we inhibited energy metabolism by short-lasting
exposure to the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate
(10 min, 3.5 mM), triggering an abrupt increase in
[K+]e, which partly recovered during washout
(Fig. 1F). As expected, TTX suppressed the in-
crease in [K+]e induced by inhibition of glycolysis
(9). The insensitivity of neuromodulator-induced
[K+]e elevations to TTX raises the question as to
whether the concerted release of neuromodulators
during arousal and wakefulness also drives an
increase in [K+]e in vivo, and if so, whether this
elevation is upstream of excitatory transmission
or merely secondary to changes in local neuronal
activity.
Wakefulness triggers an increase in
extracellular K+ that is independent of
AMPA receptors
We next measured state-dependent changes in
extracellular ion concentrations in vivo (fig. S2A).
All recordings were collected between zeitgeber
times (ZT) 4 and 8 (ZT times are based on a
24-hour diurnal cycle standardized so that ZT0
is the beginning of the sleep period and ZT12 is
the beginning of the awake period). Sleep was de-
fined as periods with high electrocorticography
(ECoG) delta activity and low electromyography
(EMG) activity relative to periods when animals
were awake. Starting from sleep, [K+]e rose rapidly
by 0.40 ± 0.05 mM (Fig. 2, A and B) as animals
awoke, before returning to baseline as animals
fell back asleep. These transitions occurred quickly,
with increases peaking within 1.3 ± 0.02 s (range
0.1 to 8.6 s, n = 27 transitions), whereas the tran-
sition back to sleep was substantially slower and
more variable, 13.9 ± 2.7 s [range 1.8 to 45.9 s,
t(55) = 3.22, P = 0.002].
We next investigated the effect of isoflurane
anesthesia on [K+]e and collected recordings
during the animals’ natural wake period (ZT16
to ZT20). After obtaining a stable awake [K+]e
baseline, 2% isoflurane was administered, which
consistently triggered a sharp decrease in [K+]e
of 0.37 ± 0.06 mM (Fig. 2C). This decrease in [K+]e
remained stable throughout isoflurane adminis-
tration and recovered to pre-anesthesia awake
levels over 148 ± 41 s after cessation of anesthesia
(n = 9 animals). Both the shift into and recovery
from anesthesia mirrored changes in ECoG and
EMG activity (Fig. 2C).
To critically evaluate the stability of state-
dependent ion shifts, microdialysis samples of
the extracellular fluid were collected in freely
behaving, unrestrained mice. We used the no-net
flux paradigm to estimate [K+]e, with five sam-
ples collected over several hours in which the
[K+] in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was
stepwise altered (Fig. 2D). Estimates of [K+]e
were comparable with those recorded with K+-
ISMs in the cortex, 4.00 ± 0.17 mM versus 4.16 ±
0.09 mM in awake mice [t(44) = 0.903, P = 0.371,
Student’s t test]. Microdialysis also showed a sig-
nificant reduction in [K+]e during sleep and iso-
flurane periods, with values decreasing to 3.44 ±
0.11 mM in sleep and 3.26 ± 0.12 mM in isoflurane
(Fig. 2D).
To test whether state-dependent [K+]e shifts
are the result of changes in excitatory activity
in vivo, we applied the AMPA receptor antag-
onist6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione(CNQX)
(200 mM). Although CNQX potently and rapidly

 suppressed the ECoG power of awake mice, only
a transient and short-lasting (<10 min) decrease
in [K+]e was observed, with [K+]e returning to
pre-CNQX concentrations despite continued sup-
pression of synaptic activity (fig. S2, B, C, and F).
Subsequent administration of isoflurane in the
presence of CNQX decreased [K+]e by 0.26 ±
0.02 mM (fig. S2C). Thus, regulation of [K+]e is de-
pendent on state-modulation and not a direct
measure of local glutamatergic activity. State-
dependent transitions in brain activity are also
linked to changes in the extracellular space vol-
ume (10). Because the Na+- and K+-dependent
adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+-ATPase) is
the chief regulator of both [K+]e and cell vol-
ume (7), we asked whether the decreased [K+]e
in response to isoflurane anesthesia is linked to
expanded extracellular space. Despite markedly
reducing ECoG power throughout recordings,
CNQX neither changed awake extracellular space
nor inhibited isoflurane-induced expansion (fig.
S2E). This indicates that local synaptic trans-
mission (ECoG power) is not the primary de-
terminant of state-dependent changes of either
[K+]e or the extracellular space volume.
Together, cortical recordings of [K+]e as well
as sampling of the extracellular fluid by means
of microdialysis showed consistent decreases in
[K+]e as animals transitioned from the awake
state to sleep. Blocking local synaptic transmis-
sion with CNQX did not affect state-dependent
changes in [K+]e (Fig. 2E).
Extracellular Ca2+ decreases
during wakefulness
Are cortical extracellular Ca2+ concentrations
also regulated by the sleep-wake cycle? Oppo-
site to the rise in [K+]e, [Ca2+]e consistently de-
creased 0.13 ± 0.02 mM as mice transitioned
from sleep to awake states and, conversely, in-
creased by 0.11 ± 0.01 mM as the mice returned
to sleep (Fig. 3, A and B). These state-dependent
[Ca2+]e shifts were slow compared with those
of [K+]e, with sleep-to-awake transitions taking
51.5 ± 8.8 s [[Ca2+]e, 4.5 to 156.0 s, Student’s t
test; versus [K+]e, t(20) = 5.379, P < 0.0001] and
awake-to-sleep occurring over 63.3 ± 8.9 s [[Ca2+]e,
19.3 to 116.1 s, Student’s t test; versus [K+]e, t(16) =
6.696, P < 0.0001]. Isoflurane administered to
awake mice drove a slow increase in [Ca2+]e
throughout the duration of anesthesia, with levels
rising by 0.26 ± 0.02 mM (Fig. 3C). This rise in
[Ca2+]e continued throughout and past the ces-
sation of anesthesia, peaking at 1.2 ± 1.6 min
(–6.2 to 12.4 min, n = 11 animals) and taking 22.6 ±
4.8 min (4.3 to 49.2 min, n = 10 animals) to recover.
Microdialysis was used to assess the stability
of state-dependent [Ca2+]e shifts by using the
no-net flux method. Because of the slow time-
course of [Ca2+]e transitions and short awaken-
ings associated with sample collection, we pooled
sleep and awake samples and compared them
with isoflurane, finding that [Ca2+]e increases by
0.25 ± 0.08 mM under isoflurane anesthesia
(Fig. 3D), which is comparable with in vivo [Ca2+]e
isoflurane recordings (Fig. 3E).
CNQX suppressed ECoG power by >60%
but did not alter awake [Ca2+]e or isoflurane-
induced [Ca2+]e increases (Fig. 3E), indicating
that local glutamatergic activity did not control
the shifts in [Ca2+]e. Together, all shifts from
awake to isoflurane-anesthetized states showed
surprising consistency (Fig. 3E). However, state-
dependent changes in [Ca2+]e could be secondary
to shifts in [K+]e. We therefore increased [K+]e in
the ACSF covering the cranial window from 2.8 to
4.5 mM, increasing [K+]e 200 mm below the pial
surface by 0.47 ± 0.07 mM [Student’s t test, t(7) =
6.861, P < 0.0001]. However, imposing this in-
crease in [K+]e had no detectable effect on the
local [Ca2+]e concentration, suggesting that [Ca2+]e
changes are not secondary to state-dependent [K+]e
changes [paired t test, t(2) = 0.855, P = 0.483].
Extracellular Mg2+ is low during
wakefulness and increases during sleep
and anesthesia
In sleep and awake states, minor but consist-
ent shifts in free [Mg2+]e were identified, with
[Mg2+]e decreasing by 0.11 ± 0.01 mM (Fig. 4A)
as mice transitioned from sleep to awake and
increasing again by 0.13 ± 0.02 mM (Fig. 4B) as
animals were observed to return to sleep. Tran-
sitions occurred slowly from both sleep to awake
(68.9 ± 8.8 s; 5 to 342 s; n = 55 transitions) and
awake to sleep (141.1 ± 14.8 s; 15.1 to 470 s; n = 49
transitions). Isoflurane anesthesia also increased
[Mg2+]e by 0.44 ± 0.07 mM in awake mice (Fig.
4C) before gradually returning to baseline over
26.7 ± 5.7 min (9.6 to 66.3 min, n = 9 animals)
after the cessation of anesthesia.
Microdialysis samples were collected during
the sleep (ZT2 to ZT8) and awake (ZT14 to ZT20)
periods and were pooled and compared with
isoflurane-induced shifts in [Mg2+]e, demonstrat-
ing an increase of 0.32 ± 0.13 mM [Mg2+]e in isoflu-
rane samples (Fig. 4D). CNQX neither altered basal
[Mg2+]e nor the previously observed isoflurane-
induced increase in [Mg2+]e (Fig. 4E). Thus, across
all experiments [Mg2+]e increased as mice went
from awake to sleep or isoflurane (Fig. 4E).
Robust changes in pH were also noted with iso-
flurane anesthesia. Recordings with pH-sensitive

 microelectrodes showed that pH decreased from
an awake level of 7.39 ± 0.03 to a stable isoflurane-
anesthetized level of 7.26 ± 0.02 (fig. S3).
Local manipulation of extracellular ions
controls neuronal activity and
extracellular space volume
Can interstitial ion composition be locally al-
tered to mimic natural sleep or awake concen-
trations? Because ions in the ACSF covering the
cranial window continuously exchange with those
in the interstitial fluid, we formulated awake-
inducing and sleep-inducing ACSFs (table S1)
to drive local cortex to the ionic composition of
the state opposite the overarching behavioral
state (fig. S4). In sleeping mice (ZT4 to ZT8),
the awake-inducing ACSF increased [K+]e by
0.47 ± 0.07 mM (versus 0.37 ± 0.06 mM in awake-
to-isoflurane transitions), decreased [Ca2+]e by
0.31 ± 0.06 mM (versus 0.26 ± 0.02 mM), and
decreased [Mg2+]e by 0.35 ± 0.02 mM (versus
0.44 ± 0.07 mM). Sleep-inducing ACSF applied
to cortex of awake mice (ZT16 to ZT20) resulted
in similar shifts, although in the opposite direc-
tion. Thus, both solutions could elicit local changes
in [K+]e, [Ca2+]e, and [Mg2+]e comparable with
those seen in transitions from awake to iso-
flurane anesthesia (fig. S4, B and D). It was not
possible to produce pH shifts of the magnitude
seen in awake-to-isoflurane transitions with
moderate changes in ACSF pH (∼1 pH), likely
reflecting the efficacy by which CO2/HCO3

system buffer pH (fig. S4, B and D) (7).

 Can local manipulation of extracellular ions
in itself drive sleep- or awake-like patterns of
neuronal activity? We prepared mice with two
separate cranial windows located over the left
and right hemisphere and recorded ECoG sym-
metrically from each (Fig. 5A). Starting in sleep-
ing mice (ZT4 to ZT8) with sleep ACSF (table S1)
over each window, recordings were collected
from each hemisphere. After this baseline pe-
riod, the ACSF over the left window was re-
moved and replaced with awake-inducing ACSF.
When activity in the left hemisphere was nor-
malized to the right in order to preclude changes
from global state transitions, we observed a
34 ± 5% decrease in 1- to 4-Hz ECoG power after
application of awake-inducing ACSF, with no
change in activity in the contralateral hemisphere
(Fig. 5B). In comparison, natural sleep-to-wake
transitions decrease the 1- to 4-Hz power by 31.1
± 3.1% (mean ± SEM of all data, n = 128 tran-
sitions). Conversely, could sleep-inducing ACSF
increase local delta power in awake mice? Rec-
ording between ZT16 and ZT20, awake mice
were prepared with awake ACSF covering each
cranial window. After a baseline recording, the
ACSF over the left hemisphere was replaced with
sleep-inducing ACSF, resulting in a 43 ± 13%
relative increase in 1- to 4-Hz delta power in the
left hemisphere exposed to the sleep-inducing
ACSF (Fig. 5C).
Because state-dependent changes in brain ac-
tivity are also linked to marked changes in the
extracellular space volume (10), we asked whether
altering the local ion composition can drive ex-
tracellular space volume changes. Tetramethyl-
ammonium (TMA+) recordings showed that in
lightly anesthetized mice (1% isoflurane admin-
istered so as to avoid arousal episodes), changing
ACSF from sleep ACSF to awake-inducing in-
duced a 21.7 ± 1.2% decrease in the local extra-
cellular space volume (Fig. 5D). Tortuosity (l)
was consistent with previous studies (11). Con-
versely, the extracellular space volume increased
by 32.2 ± 2.9% from baseline recordings ob-
tained with awake ACSF to those recorded by
using sleep-inducing ACSF in awake mice, de-
spite mice remaining awake and mobile, with
tortuosity remaining unchanged (Fig. 5D).
Brain-wide manipulations of
extracellular ions can override
behavioral states
Would global manipulation of the extracellular
ion composition be sufficient to change the be-
havioral state of mice? We implanted EEG and
EMG electrodes, as well as a cannula in cisterna
magna (10). In sleeping mice (ZT4), a baseline
recording was acquired by infusing sleep ACSF
followed by a switch to a modified awake-inducing
ACSF (Fig. 5E). This switch triggered a robust
change in EEG/EMG activity (Fig. 5E), with de-
creased EEG amplitude and delta prevalence
and increased EMG activity, indicative of an
awake-phenotype. Infusion rates were compa-
rable with CSF production, and ion concentra-
tions were chosen to account for total brain and
CSF volume (supplementary materials, materials
and methods). Typically, ACSF infusion itself did
not alter EEG activity (fig. S5, A and B). Mice
returned to sleep shortly after discontinuation
of awake-inducing ACSF infusion (Fig. 5F). We
next tested whether infusion of a modified sleep-
inducing ACSF could alter the behavioral state
of mice during their awake-period. Baseline
EEG/EMG activity characteristic of awake mice
was recorded while infusing awake ACSF fol-
lowed by a modified sleep-inducing ACSF. In-
fusion induced a sharp reduction in EMG activity
coupled to a marked increase in slow-wave EEG
activity, indicating a shifttoward sleep. EEG/EMG
activity typical of wakefulness rapidly recovered
upon stopping infusion of the modified sleep-
inducing ACSF (Fig. 5G).
Discussion
Understanding what drives arousal is essential
for deciphering key aspects of consciousness
and the lack thereof during sleep and anesthe-
sia. We found that the transition from wake-
fulness to sleep is accompanied by a marked
and sustained change in the concentration of
key extracellular ions and the volume of the ex-
tracellular space. Arousal triggers a rapid rise
in [K+]e, combined with a decrease in [Ca2+]e,
[Mg2+]e, and [H+]e and a shrinkage of extra-
cellular space. Natural sleep or anesthesia in-
duces the inverse changes in extracellular ion
concentrations and is accompanied by an ex-
pansion of extracellular space volume. State-
dependent shifts in [K+]e occurred within seconds,
whereas the changes in [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e were
slow, taking 51.5 ± 8.8 s and 68.9 ± 8.8 s, respec-
tively, for sleep-to-awake transitions. Extracellu-
lar fluid samples from microdialysis confirmed
and extended the in vivo recordings by docu-
menting that state-dependent differences in
extracellular [K+]e, [Ca2+]e, and [Mg2+]e con-
centrations persisted over prolonged period of
hours in freely behaving animals (Figs. 2 to 4).
Microdialysis experiments suggested that state-
dependent changes in extracellular ions included

were collected by 2-mm-long probes.
All ions exhibited far more consistent, rapid
transitions during arousal relative to falling
asleep. This is consistent with the need to quickly
shift from sleep to awake states when presented
with novel, threatening, or unexpected stimuli,
and with the overarching ability of brainstem neu-
romodulatory centers to drive near-immediate
responses to behaviorally relevant events (12).
Relative to [K+]e, the fivefold slower transition
of [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e may reflect differences
in the transport or buffering of these ions and
suggests that beyond the immediate capacity of
neuromodulators to drive quick arousal, it takes
longer for composition of interstitial ions to fully
stabilize. [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e exhibited very slow
recoveries after anesthesia, often lasting 10 to
30 min. Ions appeared to exhibit larger shifts
in the immediate post-induction and recovery
period. This biphasic activity may suggest a com-
plex shift in neuromodulatory activity during
these anesthetic transitions and, with [Ca2+]e
and [Mg2+]e taking much longer than [K+]e to
return to a stable awake concentration, may re-
late to the confusion and postoperative delirium
that follows general anesthesia. In fact, high lev-
els of serum [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e can manifest as
subacute delirium (7).
Previous studies have shown that [Mg2+]e
in the CNS is in the range of ~0.8 to 1.2 mM or
slightly lower than in plasma (13, 14), but [Mg2+]e
homeostasis has received little attention (15).
In electrophysiological studies, manipulation of
[Mg2+]e is commonly used because low [Mg2+]e
relieves the depolarization block of the N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and facilitates in-
duction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and, in
more extreme cases, seizure (7, 16). Wakefulness
and sleep deprivation are linked to up-regulation
of pathways downstream of NMDA receptor ac-
tivation, including CamKII, extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK), and pCreb (1, 17). The
decline in [Mg2+]e during wakefulness may there-
by, in combination with membrane depolariza-
tion induced by the elevation of [K+]e, contribute
to the gene expression pattern characteristic of
wakefulness. The finding that [Mg2+]e increases
during sleep is consistent with the observation
that changes in dietary magnesium can have a
profound impact on learning and memory, pos-
sibly by improving both the amount and quality
of sleep (18, 19).
Arousal is triggered by the concerted activity
of neurons located in the brainstem, hypothal-
amus, and basal forebrain (1, 4). Projections from
these clusters of neurons release norepinephrine,
acetylcholine, orexin, serotonin, dopamine, and
histamine over widespread areas of the CNS (12).
Considerable redundancy exists in the system;
acute antagonism, ablation, or activation has
documented the importance of the individual
components in regulating arousal, but such per-
turbations rarely produce long-term effects (12).
An unanswered question is how these neuro-
modulators drive global changes in EEG activity.
Conventional thinking is that the neuromodula-
tors alter the membrane properties and spiking
activity of select subtypes of neurons (5). Our
findings show that a parallel path exists: A cock-
tail of neuromodulators consistently increased
[K+]e in cortical slices, and TTX did not signifi-
cantly suppress the [K+]e increase, suggesting
that this shift is not merely a consequence of
local synaptic activity. In vivo, inhibition of AMPA
receptors only transiently reduced [K+]e, with
levels returning to baseline in <10 min despite
continued suppression of ECoG activity by >60%
(Fig. 2E and fig. S2). This response to an exter-
nal challenge suggests that ionic homeostasis
is tightly regulated in a state-dependent, neu-
ronal activity–independent manner. On the basis
of this, we propose that the neuromodulators—
in addition to their well-documented, direct ef-
fect on neuronal activity—maintain sleep and
awake states by creating a state-dependent set-
point for interstitial ion concentrations that
stabilize over seconds to minutes, minimizing
changes that result from transient burst firing or
suppression of these brainstem nuclei. In sleep
and anesthesia, lower concentrations of [K+]e
will tend to hyperpolarize neurons, with high
[Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e enhancing this effect through

 surface-charge screening and inactivation of
the NALCN channel–dependent Na+-leak cur-
rent (20). High [Mg2+]e in combination with
hyperpolarization will reduce the likelihood of
NMDA receptor activation during sleep, reducing
the brain’s ability to undergo activity-dependent
changes in excitatory transmission (LTP). Ma-
nipulation of [K+]e, [Ca2+]e, and [Mg2+]e in the
CSF bathing the brain drove behavioral shifts
between sleep and awake states (Fig. 5). Astro-
cytic Ca2+ signaling is also enhanced by lowering
of [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e (21–23) and is strongly
inhibited by anesthesia (24).These observations
suggest that regulation of extracellular ion ho-
meostasis is sufficient to alter behavioral state
both locally and globally, providing a path for
neuromodulators to exert consistent, stable
shifts in neuronal and astrocytic activity across
the brain.
A myriad of electrophysiological slice studies
have in the past taken advantage of minor mod-
ifications in the ion composition of the bath
solution to induce stable and highly reprodu-
cible changes in neural excitability. The observa-
tions presented here suggest that the CNS itself
uses the same trick to control state-dependent
changes in neuronal activity. One advantage of
this “ionostatic control” of neural activity is to
provide a backdrop for coordinating shifts in be-
havioral state through the widespread regulation
of excitability without relying on complex recep-
tor activation in diverse subclasses of neurons.
The characteristic state-dependent pattern of
EEG activity can, at least in part, be explained
by differences in extracellular ion composition
in sleep versus wakefulness. Our observations
add new and critical insight into understanding
what drives arousal, as well as the loss of con-
sciousness during sleep and anesthesia. Future
studies should define whether changes in extra-
cellular ion concentrations are involved in dis-
orders such as stupor and coma.

Unconventional endocannabinoid
signaling governs sperm activation
via the sex hormone progesterone

Steroids regulate cell proliferation, tissue development, and cell signaling via two
pathways: a nuclear receptor mechanism and genome-independent signaling.
Sperm activation, egg maturation, and steroid-induced anesthesia are executed via the
latter pathway, the key components of which remain unknown. Here, we present
characterization of the human sperm progesterone receptor that is conveyed by the
orphan enzyme a/b hydrolase domain–containing protein 2 (ABHD2). We show
that ABHD2 is highly expressed in spermatozoa, binds progesterone, and acts as
a progesterone-dependent lipid hydrolase by depleting the endocannabinoid
2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) from plasma membrane. The 2AG inhibits the sperm
calcium channel (CatSper), and its removal leads to calcium influx via CatSper
and ensures sperm activation. This study reveals that progesterone-activated
endocannabinoid depletion by ABHD2 is a general mechanism by which progesterone
exerts its genome-independent action and primes sperm for fertilization.
A
ccording to the conventional model of
steroid signaling, steroid hormones act
through their corresponding genomic re-
ceptors to regulate gene expression in de-
velopment, metabolism, and reproduction
(1, 2). The time scale of these signaling events
ranges from hours to days (2). However, there
is a much faster pathway that alters ion chan-
nel activity through steroid activation of mem-
brane receptors. Nongenomic signaling of the
steroid hormone progesterone (P4) occurs on a
time scale of seconds and is required for dis-
tinct physiological events, such as oocyte matu-
ration (3) and human sperm cell activation (4, 5),
and P4 likely triggers anesthesia in rodents (6).
Many tissues have both nuclear and membrane
progesterone receptors, which complicates iden-
tification of the latter. Because sperm are tran-
scriptionally silent cells and, therefore, lack the
nuclear progesterone receptor effect, we used
human spermatozoa as a cellular model to iden-
tify the nongenomic progesterone receptor.
Progesterone is a major component of follic-
ular fluid and is released by ovaries and cumu-
lus cells that surround the oocyte. Nanomolar
concentrations of P4 act through the nongenomic
P4 receptor pathway and cause robust elevation
of sperm cytoplasmic [Ca2+] (7–9) through the
activation of the cation channel, CatSper (10–14).
This rise in intracellular [Ca2+] leads to changes
in sperm motility, known as hyperactivation, and
primes sperm for acrosomal exocytosis (4, 5, 15).
Here, we show that the orphan enzyme a/b hy-
drolase domain–containing protein 2 (ABHD2)
serves as a sperm progesterone receptor. It func-
tions as a lipid hydrolase by removing endogenous
CatSper inhibitors upon association with P4. Thus,
