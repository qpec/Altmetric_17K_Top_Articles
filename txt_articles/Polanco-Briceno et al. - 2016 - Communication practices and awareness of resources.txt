Purpose: This study was designed to assess the awareness and utilization of resources to 
improve patients’ treatment experiences among endocrinologists who currently treat patients 
with acromegaly.
Methods: A total of 4,280 US endocrinologists were randomly selected from the CMS National 
Plan and Provider Enumeration System and were invited by mail to participate in a 20-minute 
online survey. In order to qualify, respondents had to be the primary physician making treatment 
decisions for at least one patient for their acromegaly.
Results: Results are based on responses from 126 physicians from primarily urban and suburban 
practices, with a median of five acromegaly patients. A total of 70% of patients are currently 
receiving drug therapy; among these, 91% are on octreotide (51%), lanreotide (29%), or pasi-
reotide (11%), alone or in combination with another therapy. Nearly half of the respondents 
thought that the impact of patient adherence on therapy outcome for acromegaly was either 
not very (40%) or not at all (7%) significant. Respondents who believe patient adherence 
significantly impacts treatment outcome were significantly more likely to discuss automated 
adherence reminders (50% vs 26%; P=0.015), mobile administration programs (57% vs 35%; 
P=0.029), and symptom tracking (72% vs 42%; P=0.002). Overall, 44% of respondents routinely 
recommend education/emotional support programs, and 25% routinely recommend financial 
assistance programs. Respondents who believe patient adherence significantly impacts treat-
ment outcome generally were more familiar with individual education and emotional support 
programs compared to those who do not, although they were not more likely to routinely refer 
patients to any of these resources.
Conclusion: There are unmet needs with respect to increasing awareness among physicians 
of the importance of patient adherence to therapy, resources available to patients, and how 
collaboration among patients, nurses, and physicians can improve adherence and overall treat-
ment experiences.
Keywords: financial support programs, emotional support programs, referrals
Introduction
Acromegaly, a complex disorder caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone by 
somatotrophs in the pituitary gland, often due to a pituitary tumor,1,2 is associated with 
significantly impaired quality of life (QoL).3 Symptoms of acromegaly, which com-
monly include fatigue, joint pain, snoring, excessive sweating, and headaches, often 
interfere with daily life activities.1,4 Acromegaly-related comorbidities and complica-
tions (eg, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney failure, hypothyroidism, 
bone/joint abnormalities, and sleep apnea)1,5–9 further contribute to decreased QoL10

and are associated with a high economic burden7,8 and 
increased mortality risk.11,12
Acromegaly treatment guidelines recommend the use of 
pharmacotherapy as adjuvant therapy in cases of persistent 
disease following surgery or as primary therapy in cases 
for which surgery is not feasible.13 Treatment is aimed at 
achieving a biochemical target goal of an age-normalized 
serum insulin-like growth factor-1 value; an additional thera-
peutic goal is a random growth hormone ,1.0 μg/L, which 
correlates with control of acromegaly.13 Recommended treat-
ments include somatostatin analogs (SSAs, eg, octreotide, 
lanreotide, or pasireotide) or pegvisomant as initial therapy in 
patients with significant disease, and dopamine agonists (usu-
ally cabergoline) for patients with mild to moderate disease.13 
A study using claims data from a database of commercially 
insured patients from 2006 to 2013 found that over half of 
patients diagnosed with acromegaly received acromegaly-
specific pharmacotherapy, with cabergoline and octreotide 
prescribed most frequently.7
Achieving biochemical control has been associated 
with reduction of symptoms and complications and reduced 
mortality risk and may improve QoL.14,15 Therefore, adher-
ence to therapy is an important component in successful long-
term treatment. However, the aforementioned claims database 
study found that adherence rates to pharmacologic treatment 
were generally low (,40%); rates of persistence (remaining 
on therapy for the minimum recommended time) were also 
low (,65%).7 The SSAs and pegvisomant are administered 
 
parenterally, with dosing frequency that varies from 
four times per day to once every 4 weeks, which may contrib-
ute to nonadherence.7 Other aspects of acromegaly treatment 
can be burdensome to patients, such as injection-related signs 
and symptoms (eg, injection-related pain, which may last 
several days after injection), emotional impact (eg, some 
patients report feeling a loss of independence), disruptions to 
everyday life (eg, inconvenience of transportation to and from 
the general practitioner’s office or clinic to receive injections, 
work loss, and problems with preparation and administration 
of injections),4 or the financial burden of treatment;7 these 
burdens may also present barriers to adherence. Finally, some 
patients may independently discontinue treatment when their 
acromegaly symptoms appear to resolve or are mild and do 
not improve with therapy.16
Establishment of a partnership with health care provid-
ers is important to patients,17 and effective communication 
may help to improve adherence.18 In addition, a number 
of patient education, support, and financial resources are 
available for patients which may help to overcome some 
barriers to adherence.18 A survey was undertaken to assess 
communication practices, along with awareness and utilization 
of acromegaly-related patient resources among endocrinolo-
gists who currently treat patients with acromegaly.
Materials and methods
survey design
A national online survey was developed and administered. 
A total of 4,280 endocrinologists were randomly selected 
from the database of 8,301 endocrinologists, based on the 
CMS National Plan and Provider Enumeration System. 
United States-licensed physicians were invited by mail to 
participate in a 20-minute, online national survey. The topic 
of the survey mentioned on the invitation was generalized 
to treatments for acromegaly. The eligibility criteria to par-
ticipate in the survey were as follows: physicians had to be 
the primary physicians making treatment decisions for at 
least one patient for their acromegaly. They also had to be 
willing to provide accurate responses to questions about their 
professional experiences. It was assumed that participation 
in this survey was random and represented basic interest and 
knowledge in acromegaly. No physician data were excluded 
from the analysis based on their response to the screener 
questions.
ethics, consent, and permissions
Physicians were offered an industry-standard honorarium for 
their time to complete the survey. By opting into the survey, 
the respondents provided consent to use their anonymized 
responses to the survey questions. Because this study did not 
involve patients or patient data, Institutional Review Board 
approval and patient consent were not required.
All survey research conducted for this article was done in 
accordance with the ethics practices outlined by the Council 
of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO).19
survey and data collection
The survey was live from March 9, 2016, to April 5, 2016 
(the survey was left open for 4 weeks and was closed once 
fewer than one response every 3 days was received, and once 
no substantial increase in number of respondents completing 
was expected based on previous experience), and comprised 
41 quantitative and qualitative questions. Quantitative ques-
tions were asked about the following topics: the number of 
patients diagnosed and treated for acromegaly, treatments of 
acromegaly, patient communication practices, and referrals 
to patient education and support resources. Qualitative ques-
tions were asked about opinions on patient adherence as it 
relates to treatment outcomes, awareness of patient education 
and support resources, and satisfaction with currently

available treatments. Additional questions not included in 
this analysis included questions about use of surgery and pre-
operative treatments, familiarity with treatment guidelines, 
and opinions on potential new therapies. The survey also 
contained a short demographic section that asked respondents 
to provide their gender, the number of years in practice, and 
the location and the setting of their practice.
Data analysis
The individual identities of physician survey respondents 
were blinded to the study authors. All survey data were 
analyzed in the aggregate. Responses to the closed questions 
were analyzed quantitatively. A response that addressed 
multiple categories was counted as multiple comments. 
SPSS Version 20 was used. All continuous variables were 
analyzed using Student’s t-test after testing for homogene-
ity of variance using Levene’s Test of Equality of Vari-
ances. All categorical variables for which the expected 
cell frequencies were .5 were analyzed using the Pearson 
chi-square test. Fisher’s exact test was used whenever the 
expected cell frequencies were #5. P,0.05 was considered 
significant.
Results
respondents, practice information, 
patient information, and prescribed 
treatments
Of the 146 respondents who entered the screener, 133 quali-
fied based on currently being the primary physician making 
treatment decisions specifically for acromegaly for at least 
one patient. Results are based on 126 physicians who com-
pleted the survey at the time of the analysis. Respondents 
were mostly (63%) male and in practice for a mean of 
17.3 years. Urban and suburban practices were about equally 
represented; group practice was the most common practice 
type (50%). Approximately one third of respondents reported 
an academic affiliation, whereas only 10% were affiliated 
with a pituitary center (Table 1).
Information regarding the respondents’ acromegaly 
patients (ie, those for whom each respondent was the pri-
mary physician making treatment decisions) is summarized 
in Table 1. Respondents reported managing a median of 
five acromegaly patients (mean, 11.3). The majority of 
patients (71%) were aged 30–59 years (data not shown). 
A total of 70% of patients are currently receiving drug 
therapy. Of these, .90% are on octreotide (51%), lanreotide 
(29%), or pasireotide (11%), either alone or in combination 
with another therapy (Figure 1A and B). The majority of 
patients (64%) receive treatment at home.
Physician satisfaction with current 
treatments and perspective on the impact 
of patient adherence on therapy outcome
A total of 48% of respondents indicated that they were very 
or extremely satisfied with the efficacy, and 56% were very 
or extremely satisfied with the safety of currently available 
acromegaly treatments, but 45% and 39%, respectively, 
were only somewhat satisfied, and 7% and 6%, respectively, 
were not very or not at all satisfied. 
Nearly half of the respondents thought that the impact of 
patient adherence on therapy outcome for acromegaly was 
either not very (41%) or not at all (7%) significant, whereas

42% thought it was very significant and 10% extremely 
significant. Responses to questions regarding communication 
with patients and use of patient resources were analyzed to 
compare the responses between the respondents who did 
and did not believe that patient adherence has a significant 
impact on outcome.
communication with patients
Respondents indicated that 27% of patients speak with a 
nurse the same day they are diagnosed. However, respon-
dents discussed a patient’s support structure (either during 
diagnosis or when discussing treatment options) with 69% of 
their patients, on average (Figure 2). There was no difference 
in these practices between physicians who believe that 
patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome 
(M=31.2, SD=40.5) and those who believe that it does not 
(M=22.7, SD=38.7); t(124) =1.208, P=0.229, in terms of 
the proportion of patients who speak with a nurse the same 
day they are diagnosed. Similarly, there was no difference 
in these practices between physicians who believe that 
patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome 
(M=71.0, SD=38.1) and those who believe that it does not 
(M=67.2, SD=38.9); t(124) =0.556, P=0.480, in terms of the 
proportion of patients with whom they discussed a patient’s 
support structure (either during diagnosis or when discussing 
treatment options).

communication practices for acromegaly patients
The survey also explored the degree to which physicians 
recommend programs or practices that may improve patient 
adherence – automated adherence reminders, a mobile 
administration program that allows health care providers 
to deliver injections at home or a convenient location, or 
a diary for symptom tracking – including whether there is 
a dedicated nurse who discusses these topics with patients 
(Table 2). Most physicians did not have a dedicated nurse 
to discuss these topics (24% mentioned for automated 
adherence reminders, 17% for the mobile administration 
program, and 14% for symptom tracking). There was only 
a marginal difference between physicians who do or do not 
believe patient adherence significantly impacts treatment 
outcome with regard to the percentage having a dedicated 
nurse to discuss automated adherence reminders: X 2 
(1, N=126) =3.22, P=0.073, and symptom tracking, X 
2 (1, 
N=126) =3.31, P=0.069. There was no significant difference 
between these groups with regard to the percentage having a 
dedicated nurse to discuss the mobile administration program, 
X 
2 (1, N=126) =0.481, P=0.488. Among physicians without 
a dedicated nurse, those who believe patient adherence 
significantly impacts treatment outcome were significantly 
more likely to, 1) discuss automated adherence reminders 
 
(eg, e-mails, phone calls, letters, and text messages) (50% vs 
26%, X 
2 [1, N=96] =5.888, P=0.015); 2) discuss the mobile 
administration program (57% vs 35%; X 
2 [1, N=104] =4.749, 
P=0.029); and 3) discuss symptom tracking (72% vs 42%; 
X 
2 [1, N=108] =9.804, P=0.002).
Awareness and referrals by physicians 
to patient education/emotional support 
programs
Only 14% of the respondents indicated that they routinely 
recommend education/emotional support programs to 
patients; however, after being presented with a list of 
nine examples of education/emotional support programs, 
this increased to 44%, with 40% being familiar with at least 
one (though not routinely referring patients to any), and 
17% not familiar with any (Figure 3A). There was no sig-
nificant difference between the respondents who believe that 
patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome 
and those who do not in the proportion who routinely refer 
patients to at least one program, the proportion familiar with 
at least one program, and the proportion being familiar with 
any program; X 
2 (2, N=126) =0.654, P=0.721. Top patient

patients to “Hormone Health Network (www.hormone.org)” 
and “Pituitary Network Association (www.pituitary.org),” 
with 21% of respondents referring patients to each of these 
(Figure 3B). An additional 37% are familiar with “Hormone 
Health Network,” but are not routinely referring patients to 
it, versus an additional 18% familiar with “Pituitary Network 
Association,” but not routinely referring patients to it. 
Furthermore, 44% mention being familiar with “Pituitary 
Society (www.pituitary-society.org)” although only 9% 
routinely refer patients to this. Overall, respondents who 
believe that patient adherence significantly impacts treatment 
outcome were more familiar with individual education and 
emotional support programs compared to those who do not, 
although they were generally not more likely to routinely 
refer patients to any of these resources. There was a signifi-
cant difference in familiarity with “Acromegaly Info (www.
acromegalyinfo.com)” (P=0.015, Fisher’s exact test) and 
“Pituitary Disorders (www.pituitarydisorder.net)” (X 
2 [2, 
N=126] =8.769, P=0.012); physicians who believe that 
patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome 
were significantly more likely than those who do not to be 
familiar with both resources (33% vs 17% familiar with 
“Acromegaly Info,” respectively, and 35% vs 18% familiar 
with “Pituitary Disorders,” respectively), although there 
was no difference in routine referrals (11% vs 3% routinely 
referring to “Acromegaly Info,” respectively, and 14% vs 5% 
routinely referring to “Pituitary Disorders,” respectively). 
Awareness and referrals by physicians 
to patient financial support programs
As previously described, the vast majority of patients cur-
rently receiving drug therapy (.90%; Figure 1A and B) 
are on octreotide, lanreotide, or pasireotide (alone or in 
combination with other treatments). The survey inquired 
about physicians’ awareness of financial assistance programs 
offered by the drug manufacturers. Only 17% of physicians 
mention routinely recommending financial resources for 
patients without publicly funded health care. This increases 
to 25% when presented with a list of examples, although 
34% mention being familiar with at least one (though not 
routinely referring patients to any), and 41% mention not 
being familiar with any (Figure 4A and B). There was no 
significant difference between respondents who believe that 
patient adherence significantly impacts treatment outcome 
and those who do not in the proportion who routinely refer 
patients to at least one program, the proportion familiar 
with at least one program (though not routinely referring 
patients to any), and the proportion being familiar with

any program, X 
2 (2, N=126) =0.214, P=0.898. There was 
a significant difference in familiarity with and referrals to 
information found through endocrine societies (P=0.004, 
Fisher’s exact test); physicians who believe that patient 
adherence has a significant impact on outcomes were more 
likely to be familiar with these resources compared to those 
who do not (36% vs 17%, respectively), although there was 
no difference in routine referrals (6% vs 0%, respectively). 
Looking specifically at those currently prescribing either 
octreotide or pasireotide, which are produced by the same

prescribing lanreotide (n=69), 29% routinely referred patients 
to the financial assistance program offered by the manufac-
turer, while 35% were aware but did not refer patients, and 
36% were not familiar with this program.
Discussion
Patients with acromegaly face a significant burden from 
the symptoms and complications of the disease itself; this 
burden can be further increased by the need for chronic 
therapy. In this study, the majority (70%) of patients were 
currently on treatment, and the vast majority (.90%) of those 
patients were prescribed SSAs or pegvisomant. Recent claims 
database studies have also reported SSAs and pegvisomant 
(collectively) among the most common treatments.8,20,21 All of 
these treatments are injectable therapies, which can be associ-
ated with various patient concerns18 and difficulties in terms 
of side effects, adherence, and overall impact on QoL;4 
these treatments are also associated with substantial costs.7,8 
Thus, adherence to therapy with these commonly prescribed 
treatments may be challenging for patients.

communication practices for acromegaly patients
About half of the respondents indicated that they were 
very or extremely satisfied with the efficacy (48%) and safety 
(56%) of currently available treatments, and about half of 
the respondents (52%) indicated that they believe patient 
treatment adherence has a significant impact on treatment 
outcomes. Data regarding treatment adherence and outcomes 
specific to acromegaly are scarce, although one registry study 
reported that nonadherence accounted for ~20% of patients 
with uncontrolled disease.22 There is also evidence suggesting 
a need for improved adherence to follow-up and monitoring;23 
patients may not be aware of the need for follow-up24 or may 
think treatment and/or follow-up are unnecessary due to an 
absence of subjective symptoms,16 and the inability to closely 
monitor patients seems to be associated with a lower rate of 
treatment and high rate of active disease.16,23,24 From a broader 
perspective, an association between adherence to therapy 
and treatment outcomes has been demonstrated in multiple 
disease states, including chronic diseases,25–31 suggesting 
the same would be true in acromegaly. Although, a recent 
study using a web-based survey of health care providers 
with experience in treating acromegaly (n=23) found that 
75% were concerned about adherence to pharmacotherapy 
and identified inconvenience of treatment and financial 
issues as being among the top barriers to adherence from 
the provider perspective.32 The results of this study suggest 
that it is necessary to increase awareness of the importance 
of treatment adherence among physicians who treat patients 
with acromegaly.
Effective communication with patients has been shown 
to improve medication adherence,33 and for patients with 
acromegaly, discussions regarding the diagnosis, patient 
concerns, treatment and treatment goals, and available 
resources (such as the ones included in the survey) may help 
to address potential barriers to adherence34,35 and improve the 
overall treatment experience.18 Indeed, offering counseling 
and informing newly diagnosed patients about the acro-
megaly community are valued by patients.17 In this study, 
approximately two thirds of respondents indicated that they 
discuss a patient’s support structure. However, only about 
one third of their patients speak with a nurse the same day 
they are diagnosed, respondents (or their dedicated nurses) 
discuss tools such as adherence reminders with about half 
of patients, and less than half of respondents routinely refer 
patients to patient education and support resources. Despite 
the large percentage of patients for whom respondents 
prescribed medications that have a financial assistance 
program offered by the manufacturer (ie, SSAs), only 25% 
of respondents routinely refer patients to financial resources, 
and 41% indicated they were not familiar with any of 
these resources. The finding that there was no significant 
difference between respondents who believe patient adher-
ence significantly impacts treatment outcome and those who 
do not in the proportion who routinely refer patients to at 
least one program or are familiar with at least one program 
indicates a need to increase awareness among physicians 
of the different resources available to patients and how 
patients, nurses, and physicians can collaborate for success-
ful treatment experiences (eg, using approaches described 
by Plunkett and Barkan).18 
Limitations of this study include possible enrollment bias 
(participants could be a selected group and not necessarily 
representative of all endocrinologists) and inherent limita-
tions of self-reported data. Because the survey did not inquire 
about treatment outcomes, it is not known whether patient 
treatment outcomes differed depending on whether respon-
dents do or do not discuss and refer patients to the various 
resources included. The study did not specifically address 
treatment adherence rates or potential barriers to adherence 
observed in the respondents’ practices. The survey did not 
gather information regarding a respondent’s rationale for 
not discussing various topics (eg, adherence reminders) 
or for not referring patients to a support resource that they 
were familiar with; as such, whether respondents believe 
the resources are reliable or helpful is not clear. The spe-
cific resources included in the survey may not represent a 
comprehensive list of all resources available, and the degree 
to which patients find these particular resources useful is 
not known.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest an unmet need for increased 
awareness among endocrinologists with respect to the impor-
tance of patient adherence to therapy and the availability of 
education, support, and financial resources for patients with 
acromegaly. Additional research is needed to understand 
which resources patients identify as most helpful, to evaluate 
barriers to adherence and the effect of utilization of patient 
resources and medication/disease management tools on 
treatment adherence, and to quantify the impact of adherence 
on treatment outcomes for patients with acromegaly.
