Abstract
Background—The epidemiologic characteristics of children and young adults with acute kidney 
injury have been described in single-center and retrospective studies. We conducted a 
multinational, prospective study involving patients admitted to pediatric intensive care units to 
define the incremental risk of death and complications associated with severe acute kidney injury.
Methods—We used the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria to define acute 
kidney injury. Severe acute kidney injury was defined as stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury (plasma 
creatinine level ≥2 times the baseline level or urine output <0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight 
per hour for ≥12 hours) and was assessed for the first 7 days of intensive care. All patients 3 
months to 25 years of age who were admitted to 1 of 32 participating units were screened during 3 
consecutive months. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
Results—A total of 4683 patients were evaluated; acute kidney injury developed in 1261 patients 
(26.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6 to 28.2), and severe acute kidney injury developed in 
543 patients (11.6%; 95% CI, 10.7 to 12.5). Severe acute kidney injury conferred an increased risk 
of death by day 28 after adjustment for 16 covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.17 to 
2.68); death occurred in 60 of the 543 patients (11.0%) with severe acute kidney injury versus 105 
of the 4140 patients (2.5%) without severe acute kidney injury (P<0.001). Severe acute kidney 
injury was associated with increased use of mechanical ventilation and renal-replacement therapy. 
A stepwise increase in 28-day mortality was associated with worsening severity of acute kidney 
injury (P<0.001 by log-rank test). Assessment of acute kidney injury according to the plasma 
creatinine level alone failed to identify acute kidney injury in 67.2% of the patients with low urine 
output.
Conclusions—Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with poor outcomes, including 
increased mortality, among critically ill children and young adults. (Funded by the Pe-diatric

Epidemiologic studies involving adults have shown that acute kidney injury is associated 
with increased mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and prolonged length of stay in 
intensive care units (ICUs).1–3 A multinational, prospective study involving 1802 adults3 
initiated the use of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to 
describe the epidemiology of acute kidney injury; the guidelines4 define and stage acute 
kidney injury according to the plasma creatinine level and urine output (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). That study 
showed graded associations between the severity of acute kidney injury and outcomes. A 
single-center study involving adults revealed that mortality and morbidity were higher when 
both the plasma creatinine level and urine output were used to diagnose acute kidney injury 
than when either was used alone.5 In comparison, the study of acute kidney injury in 
children has been limited.6–9 Four single-center, retrospective studies involving children 
have used the KDIGO criteria,10–13 but none of those assessed urine output in the diagnosis 
of acute kidney injury.
In studies involving adults, chronic coexisting conditions (e.g., diabetes and cirrhosis) 
commonly confound the interpretation of the risk that acute kidney injury confers with 
respect to mortality. Children generally do not have chronic coexisting conditions, so 
pediatric studies provide a unique opportunity to show a direct role of acute kidney injury in 
mediating an increased risk of death.
We conducted the Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina, and 
Epidemiology (AWARE) study14 to define the epidemiology of acute kidney injury and to 
characterize risk factors for acute kidney injury and associated morbidity in a multinational 
cohort of critically ill children and young adults. We hypothesized that severe acute kidney 
injury was common and would increase the risk of death.
Methods
Study Design and Cohort
This was a prospective, observational study that recruited patients in 32 pediatric ICUs 
across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America for 3 consecutive months in 2014; the 
design has been published previously.14 In brief, all patients between 3 months and 25 years 
of age with a predicted ICU stay of at least 48 hours were eligible. Exclusion criteria were 
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-
surface area, maintenance dialysis, or receipt of a kidney transplant in the preceding 90 days. 
We reviewed the medical records of eligible patients to collect data for the following time 
periods: up to 3 months before admission (plasma creatinine level only), daily during the 
first 7 days after ICU admission, and on day 28 after admission. Data on 28-day outcomes 
were recorded regardless of whether the patient was still in the ICU or had been discharged 
or had died. All centers obtained approval from health research ethics boards before 
commencement of the study.

 Definitions and Measurements
The baseline plasma creatinine level was defined as the lowest level in the 3 months before 
admission. The estimated GFR was calculated with the use of the original Schwartz 
formula.15 When the baseline plasma creatinine level was unavailable, the estimated GFR 
was assumed to be 120 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, as validated previously.16 We applied 
KDIGO criteria for the plasma creatinine level and urine output to define and classify acute 
kidney injury; however, use of renal-replacement therapy was a secondary outcome and was 
omitted from the definition of stage 3 kidney injury.4 We required at least one plasma 
creatinine measurement or at least 12 hours of recorded urine output in the first 7 days after 
admission to assess for acute kidney injury. When the two criteria resulted in different 
stages, we chose the higher stage. We defined severe acute kidney injury as stage 2 or 3 
acute kidney injury (plasma creatinine level ≥2 times the baseline level or urine output <0.5 
ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for ≥12 hours), because these stages have been 
associated with increased mortality in studies involving children.7,11,17 To evaluate the effect 
of the severity of acute kidney injury on secondary outcomes, we defined the maximum 
stage of acute kidney injury as the highest stage observed during the first 7 days after ICU 
admission.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay in the 
ICU, receipt and duration of mechanical ventilation, receipt of extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation, and receipt of renal-replacement therapy.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical data are presented as counts and percentages and were analyzed with the 
chisquare test and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Normality was tested with the 
Kolmogorov– Smirnov test. Skewed distributions are described with medians and 
interquartile ranges and were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and 
Kruskal–Wallis test. Normal distributions are described with means and standard deviations 
and were compared with the use of Student’s t-test. The two-sided alpha level was set at 
0.05. With respect to missing data, we performed sensitivity analyses to assess for 
differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, the rate of acute kidney injury, and 
secondary outcomes when data on the 28-day outcome (alive vs. dead) were unavailable and 
to assess for differences in 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes when data on the 
baseline plasma creatinine level were unavailable (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
We used multivariable logistic-regression models for the primary analysis to determine the 
association between the maximum stage of acute kidney injury and risk of death, with 
adjustment for risk factors that differed between survivors and nonsurvivors. Variables were 
entered into models when the alpha level of the risk factor was less than 0.15 in bivariate 
analysis. Kaplan– Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to describe the effect 
of the maximum stage of acute kidney injury on 28-day mortality. The preferred illness-
severity scoring system at each center (the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III [PRISM-III] score, 
Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction [PELOD] score, or Pediatric Index of Mortality 2

 [PIM-2] score)18 was incorporated in the model for the patients at that center. The risk of 
death associated with acute kidney injury was evaluated as a categorical variable. In this 
multivariate analysis, a maximum stage of 2 or 3 was considered to be severe acute kidney 
injury, and no acute kidney injury or stage 1 was the reference. Linear regression models 
were created to determine the predictors of length of stay in the ICU. Analyses were 
conducted with the use of JMP software, version 11.0.0 (SAS Institute), and Microsoft Excel 
2010. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available at NEJM.org.
Results
Patient Characteristics
We screened 6821 patients, of whom 5237 (76.8%) met the eligibility criteria. Data on 28-
day outcomes were available for 4984 patients (95.2%). Figure 1 shows the process from 
screening to assessment of the primary outcome. Patient demographic and clinical 
characteristics are shown in Table 1.
A total of 4683 patients had known status with respect to both acute kidney injury and 28-
day outcome; among these patients, acute kidney injury developed in 1261 patients (26.9%; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6 to 28.2) and severe acute kidney injury developed in 543 
(11.6%; 95% CI, 10.7 to 12.5) during the first 7 days after ICU admission. The maximum 
stage of acute kidney injury was stage 1 in 718 patients (15.3%), stage 2 in 294 patients 
(6.3%), and stage 3 in 249 patients (5.3%).
Of the 4984 patients with data on 28-day outcomes, 73 (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8) received 
renal-replacement therapy. A total of 169 patients (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9) died within 28 
days (148 in the ICU and 21 after discharge from the ICU). Nearly all clinical factors were 
similar in patients with available data on mortality and the 253 patients with missing data on 
mortality, and mortality was identical when we included these 253 patients after estimating 
their mortality on the basis of their identified risk factors for death (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The 2533 patients without an available measured baseline 
plasma creatinine level had shorter stays in the ICU and lower use of renal-replacement 
therapy and mechanical ventilation than the 2451 patients for whom a baseline plasma 
creatinine level was available. No such associations were seen in the subgroup of 102 
patients with a known renal or urologic coexisting condition; within that subgroup, there 
were no significant differences in these variables between those who did not have an 
available measured baseline plasma creatinine level and those who did (Table S3A and S3B 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Severe Acute Kidney Injury as an Independent Risk Factor for Death
Comparative analyses between survivors and non-survivors are shown in Table 2. On 
average, the maximum stage of acute kidney injury was higher in nonsurvivors than in 
survivors. Severe acute kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death (odds 
ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.68) after adjustment for 16 covariates. Death occurred in 60 of 
the 543 patients (11.0%) with severe acute kidney injury as compared with 105 of the 4140 
patients (2.5%) without severe acute kidney injury (P<0.001). The use of renal-replacement

 therapy was the second strongest predictor (after the use of vasoactive support) of death by 
day 28 after admission (odds ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.74 to 6.54). Severe acute kidney injury 
conferred an increased risk of death after adjustment for center-preferred illness-severity 
scores (P<0.001 for each score: PRISM-III [1263 patients], PIM-2 [1363 patients] and 
PELOD [859 patients]), with odds ratios ranging from 2.41 to 5.12 (P<0.05 across scores) 
(Table S4A in the Supplementary Appendix).
Maximum Stage of Acute Kidney Injury and Outcomes
A stepwise increase in the maximum stage of acute kidney injury conferred an incremental 
risk of death (P<0.001) (Fig. 2). The risk of death associated with a maximum stage of 3 
exceeded the corresponding risk associated with no acute kidney injury or a maximum stage 
of 1 or 2 (P<0.001 for all comparisons). A maximum stage of 2 carried increased risk when 
compared with no acute kidney injury but not when compared with a maximum stage of 1. 
Patients with a maximum stage of 1 had longer ICU stays and greater provision and duration 
of mechanical ventilation than patients without acute kidney injury. Increases in the 
maximum stage of acute kidney injury were associated with increased length of stay after 
adjustment for illness-severity scores (Table S4B in the Supplementary Appendix). An 
increase in the maximum stage of acute kidney injury was associated with increased use of 
renal-replacement therapy, increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 
increased use and duration of mechanical ventilation (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Comparison of Plasma Creatinine Level and Urine Output in Defining Acute Kidney Injury
Data on the plasma creatinine level (4036 patients) or urine output (3965 patients) were 
available to assess for acute kidney injury in 94% of the patients with known 28-day 
outcomes; 3318 patients had data on both. Mortality was higher among patients with stage 3 
acute kidney injury defined according to urine output than among those with stage 3 acute 
kidney injury defined according to the plasma creatinine level (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
In patients with data on both the plasma creatinine level and urine output, acute kidney 
injury defined according to the plasma creatinine level developed in 738 patients (22.2%) 
and acute kidney injury defined according to urine output developed in 528 patients (15.9%). 
In 355 of the 528 patients (67.2%) who met the urine-output criteria for acute kidney injury, 
the diagnosis of acute kidney injury would have been missed if only the plasma creatinine 
criteria had been used. Mortality was higher among patients with low urine output than 
among those with normal urine output (7.8% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.02).
Progression of Acute Kidney Injury
The daily prevalence of acute kidney injury increased progressively from 14.5% to 20.4% 
over a period of 7 days (Fig. 3). Patients with stage 1 acute kidney injury on day 1 were 
more likely to have progression to stage 2 or 3 by day 7 than patients without acute kidney 
injury on day 1 (14.1% vs. 2.9%, P<0.001).

 Predictors of Severe Acute Kidney Injury
Several factors were associated with severe acute kidney injury (Table S6 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Transplantation was associated with the highest risk (odds ratio, 
2.43; 95% CI, 1.71 to 3.40). The distribution of severe acute kidney injury was similar in 
patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation and those who had undergone bone 
marrow transplantation (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Center Variability
Characteristics of the ICUs are shown in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix. We 
observed in-tercenter variability in the rate of severe acute kidney injury (median, 10.4%; 
interquartile range, 7.8 to 16.7) and in the rate of death (median, 3.2%; interquartile range, 
2.0 to 6.1). The rates for each individual center and the rates pooled according to country are 
shown in Figures S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
This large, prospective, multinational study of the epidemiology of acute kidney injury in 
children and young adults in ICUs showed that acute kidney injury occurred in one quarter 
of patients during the first 7 days after ICU admission. Severe acute kidney injury conferred 
an incremental risk of death by day 28 and was associated with increased use of renal-
replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation and longer stays in the ICU. Assessment of 
acute kidney injury according to the plasma creatinine level alone failed to identify acute 
kidney injury in two thirds of the patients with low urine output, and low urine output alone 
conferred an increased risk of death.
The presence of chronic systemic diseases contributes to residual confounding in studies of 
acute kidney injury in adults. Children have a low prevalence of such chronic diseases; thus, 
although the incremental association between acute kidney injury and risk of death mirrors 
that seen in adults, our study suggests that acute kidney injury itself may be key to the 
associated morbidity and mortality.
The common and early occurrence of acute kidney injury reinforces the need for systematic 
surveillance for acute kidney injury at the time of admission to the ICU. Early identification 
of modifiable risk factors for acute kidney injury (e.g., nephrotoxic medications) or adverse 
sequelae (e.g., fluid overload) has the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality.19–21 
Previously reported rates of acute kidney injury among children and young adults vary 
widely — from 5% to 82%.6,7,11,12,22 This variation probably results from differences in 
case mix, illness severity, coexisting conditions, and definitions of acute kidney injury. A 5% 
rate of acute kidney injury was reported in a single-center study that used a 100% rise in the 
plasma creatinine level to define acute kidney injury,22 whereas in another study, 82% of 
patients receiving at least one vasoactive medication and mechanical ventilation had acute 
kidney injury as defined by a 33% rise in the plasma creatinine level.6 Since the adoption of 
standardized classification criteria for acute kidney injury, reported rates among critically ill 
children have ranged from 10 to 40%.6,7,10–12 Although we observed intercenter variation in 
rates of severe acute kidney injury and death, the 95% confidence intervals overlap for the

 vast majority of sites and countries. The pooled 26.9% rate of acute kidney injury in the 
current study may therefore be regarded as a valid benchmark, given the large sample and 
multinational composition.
Our study results provide informative comparisons with those of a recent multicenter study 
in adults, the Acute Kidney Injury–Epidemiologic Prospective Investigation (AKI-EPI) 
study.3 Although the rates of overall and severe acute kidney injury (57.3% and 38.9%, 
respectively) were higher in the adult study than the corresponding rates in our study, the 
associations between acute kidney injury and mortality and morbidity are similar.3 We 
speculate that the relatively lower rates of acute kidney injury observed in our study 
represent greater renal reserve in children. Although both studies show an increased risk of 
death with higher KDIGO stages (odds ratios ranged from 1.18 at stage 1 to 8.21 at stage 3 
in our study and from 2.19 at stage 1 to 7.18 at stage 3 in the AKI-EPI study), our study did 
not show an association between stage 1 acute kidney injury and mortality. The multiple 
coexisting conditions seen in adults may confer greater susceptibility to acute kidney injury–
associated outcomes, which is, in part, supported by the higher overall mortality seen in the 
AKI-EPI study than in our study (18.4% vs. 3.4%). The current study reinforces the 
importance of using both the plasma creatinine level and urine output to define acute kidney 
injury.5 This finding questions nationwide efforts to prevent urinary tract infections by not 
placing indwelling bladder catheters, or removing them early, in all critically ill children.23 
Our data suggest that children are more likely to survive severe acute kidney injury than 
adults. Because children who survive acute kidney injury are at risk for chronic kidney 
disease, long-term follow-up of these survivors is warranted.24,25
Although the daily prevalence of acute kidney injury increased from 14.5% on day 1 to 
20.4% on day 7, approximately 75% of the increase occurred within 4 days after admission. 
This increase probably results from the earlier discharge of less severely ill patients who 
would be at lower risk for multiorgan failure and acute kidney injury. Such data may support 
the use of a 4-day time frame for future focused studies of acute kidney injury in children.
Our study has a number of strengths. It involved a large, multicenter cohort of children and 
young adults, which enabled a robust evaluation of relationships between exposure and 
outcome, and it had a prespecified protocol, operational definitions, and an analysis plan and 
enumerated complete standardized diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury. The overall 
mortality of 3.4% is similar to the rate reported in epidemiologic studies conducted in 
pediatric ICUs,26,27 which suggests that our cohort is representative.
The study also has some limitations. First, because it is an observational cohort study, we 
cannot make statements regarding causal relationships among acute kidney injury, 
exposures, and outcomes observed. Second, we cannot generalize our findings outside 
pediatric ICU settings. Third, we did not assess for the potential effect of the specific cause 
of acute kidney injury on patient outcomes. Fourth, we have no detailed information on 
interventions (e.g., use of diuretics) that could increase urinary output and thereby alter the 
observed prevalence of acute kidney injury. Fifth, we required one plasma creatinine 
measurement or 12 hours of recorded urine output in the ICU to constitute sufficient data for 
assessment of acute kidney injury. Although more data could alter the perceived rates, 94%

 of patients with data on 28-day outcomes met the assessment requirements for the plasma 
creatinine level or urine output. Sixth, assessment for acute kidney injury stopped at day 7 in 
our study, and it is possible that we missed events of acute kidney injury occurring later. 
Seventh, secondary outcomes (e.g., provision of renal-replacement therapy or mechanical 
ventilation) were driven by local care practice and therefore were potentially biased by 
pediatric inten-sivists who were interested in acute kidney injury. Finally, although the 
current study represents a large international pediatric study, two thirds of the centers were 
from North America; we were unable to recruit centers from Africa and South America.
In conclusion, our study involving critically ill children and young adults showed that acute 
kidney injury is common and is associated with poor outcomes, including increased 
mortality.

 Figure 1. Screening, Eligibility, and 28-Day Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was death by day 28 after admission to the pediatric intensive care 
unit (ICU). The 253 patients who did not have 28-day data were excluded from outcome 
analyses. The maximum stage of acute kidney injury was defined as the highest stage 
observed during the first 7 days after ICU admission. The stages of acute kidney injury were 
defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes plasma creatinine 
criteria (stage 1: an increase in the creatinine level to 1.5 to 1.9 times the baseline level that 
is known or presumed to have occurred within the past 7 days or an increase by ≥0.3 mg per 
deciliter [26.5 µmol per liter] within the past 48 hours; stage 2: a level 2.0 to 2.9 times the 
baseline level; stage 3: a level 3.0 times the baseline level, an increase to ≥4.0 mg per 
deciliter [354 µmol per liter], or, in patients <18 years of age, a decrease in the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate to <35 ml per minute per 1.73 m2) and urine-output criteria (stage 
1: <0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for 6 to <12 hours; stage 2: <0.5 ml per 
kilogram per hour for ≥12 hours; stage 3: <0.3 ml per kilogram per hour for ≥24 hours or 
anuria for ≥12 hours).

 Figure 3. Prevalence of Acute Kidney Injury, According to Stage, during the First Week of ICU 
Admission
For day 0, only the serum creatinine level was used to assess for acute kidney injury because 
data on urine output were not available. Patients with missing data to assess for acute kidney 
injury were excluded from analysis.

*The reference for the odds ratio is the absence of the corresponding risk factor. Variables were entered into the multivariable logistic-regression 
model (and, therefore, odds ratios were calculated) when the alpha level of the risk factor was less than 0.15 in bivariate analysis.
†Patients could be part of more than one diagnosis group or have more than one coexisting condition.
‡The analysis was limited to patients with known status with respect to both acute kidney injury and 28-day outcome (alive vs. dead). The stages of 
acute kidney injury were defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes plasma creatinine criteria (stage 1: an increase in 
the creatinine level to 1.5 to 1.9 times the baseline level that is known or presumed to have occurred within the past 7 days or an increase by ≥0.3 
mg per deciliter [26.5 µmol per liter] within the past 48 hours; stage 2: a level 2.0 to 2.9 times the baseline level; stage 3: a level 3.0 times the 
baseline level, an increase to ≥4.0 mg per deciliter [354 µmol per liter], or, in patients <18 years of age, a decrease in the estimated GFR to <35 ml 
per minute per 1.73 m2) and urine-output criteria (stage 1: <0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for 6 to <12 hours; stage 2: <0.5 ml per 
kilogram per hour for ≥12 hours; stage 3: <0.3 ml per kilogram per hour for ≥24 hours or anuria for ≥12 hours). The 16 covariates assessed for the 
multivariable logistic-regression model were a diagnosis at ICU admission of shock, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, surgical or trauma, 
central nervous system disorder, or pain or sedation; the presence of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncologic, immunologic, or infectious conditions 
at baseline; a history of transplantation; and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal-replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, or 
vasoactive support.
