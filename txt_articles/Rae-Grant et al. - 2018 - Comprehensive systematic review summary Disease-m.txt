Abstract
Objective
To review evidence on starting, switching, and stopping disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)
for multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS
(RRMS), and progressive MS forms.
Methods
Relevant, peer-reviewed research articles, systematic reviews, and abstracts were identified
(MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE searched from inception to November 2016). Studies were
rated using the therapeutic classification scheme. Prior published Cochrane reviews were also used.
Results
Twenty Cochrane reviews and an additional 73 full-text articles were selected for data extraction
through an updated systematic review (completed November 2016). For people with RRMS,
many DMTs are superior to placebo (annualized relapses rates [ARRs], new disease activity
[new MRI T2 lesion burden], and in-study disease progression) (see summary and full text
publications). For people with RRMS who experienced a relapse on interferon-β (IFN-β) or
glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab is more effective than IFN-β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous 3 times per
week in reducing the ARR. For people with primary progressive MS, ocrelizumab is probably
more effective than placebo (in-study disease progression). DMTs for MS have varying adverse
effects. In people with CIS, glatiramer acetate and IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times per week are
more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS. Cladribine, immunoglob-
ulins, IFN-β-1a 30 μg intramuscular weekly, IFN-β-1b subcutaneous alternate day, and teri-
flunomide are probably more effective than placebo in decreasing risk of conversion to MS.
Suggestions for future research include studies considering comparative effectiveness, usefulness
of high-efficacy treatment vs stepped-care protocols, and research into predictive biomarkers.

 This article summarizes the findings and conclusions of an
American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice guideline
on the efficacy and safety of disease-modifying therapies
(DMTs) in multiple sclerosis (MS). References e1 through
e49, cited here, are available at links.lww.com/WNL/A374 as
a data supplement to this summary article.
A companion article presents the recommendations and
suggestions for future research.1 The complete practice
guideline (systematic review, recommendations, and sugges-
tions for future research) is available at links.lww.com/WNL/
A429 as a data supplement to the companion recom-
mendations article. This guideline, although not a formal
update to the 2002 AAN guideline on DMTs,2 replaces that
earlier guideline. The complete guideline includes full details
of the methodology used, including risk of bias classification
for each study, confidence in the evidence determinations,
and rationales for recommendation strength; space restric-
tions precluded more detailed description in this article.
MS affects more than 400,000 people in the United States and
more than 2.3 million people worldwide.3 Since 1993, DMTs
have been approved in the United States for treating relapsing
forms of MS; most of these therapies are approved for use in
other countries. Many additional medications have been used
off-label for MS disease modification.
Multiple new DMTs have become available since publication of
the 2002 AAN practice guideline on DMTs in MS.2 Clinicians
and people with MS may now choose from several medications,
with differing mechanisms of action, risk profiles, and moni-
toring requirements. Before recommending a specific therapy,
the clinician must navigate these complexities while carefully
balancing the potential for therapeutic benefits of a medication
with patient preferences, monitoring recommendations, drug-
and individual-specific risk factors, and concerns regarding the
long-term risk of MS-related disability and morbidity.
The new practice guideline,1 based on the systematic review
summarized here, provides guidance concerning current issues
surrounding DMT for MS prescribing, specifically addressing
the following questions pertinent to clinically isolated syn-
dromes of demyelination (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS
(RRMS), and progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive
MS [SPMS] and primary progressive MS [PPMS]):
1.
In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to placebo or
other DMTs as measured by annualized relapse rates
(ARRs) and the relative risk of relapse at 2 years?
2.
In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to placebo or
other DMTs in reducing MRI-detected new disease activity
as measured by new T2 lesion burden or atrophy measures?
3.
In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to placebo or
other DMTs in preventing disease progression as
measured by in-study disease progression measures?
4.
In people with RRMS who experience disease activity
while on a DMT, is changing to a different DMT superior
to continuing the present DMT in terms of relapse rateand
MRI-detected T2 or gadolinium-enhanced lesion activity?
5.
In people with progressive MS, are DMTs superior to
placebo or other DMTs as measured by relapse rate or in-
study disease progression?
6.
What are the adverse effects (AEs) of DMTs in people
with MS compared with placebo (AE-related discontin-
uation and serious or life-threatening AEs)?
7.
In people with CIS, are DMTs superior to placebo in
decreasing the risk of conversion to MS?
Description of the analytic process
In May 2015, the AAN guideline subcommittee recruited
a multidisciplinary panel to develop the guideline on which
this systematic review is based. The panel consists of 12 AAN
physician and nurse members, 2 representatives from the
Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers, and 3 patient
representatives. Two AAN staff representatives were also
appointed to the panel. Conflicts of interest were reviewed by
the panel leadership; panelists with conflicts did not partici-
pate in systematic review development.
The practice guideline follows the methodologies described in
the 2011 edition of the AAN’s guideline development process
manual, as amended to include an updated classification
scheme for therapeutic studies, a formalized prioritization
process for guideline topic nominations, and a change in the
order of steps for the external (peer) review process.4 Institute
of Medicine standards for systematic review and clinical prac-
tice guideline development were adhered to throughout the

 development process, including posting of the protocol and
draft document with recommendations for public review and
active solicitation of patient input.5,6 For the systematic review,
the panel used appropriate Cochrane reviews (assessed by 2
panelists working independently of each other and using A
Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews quality)7 in
addition to treatment-specific systematic reviews. Two non-
conflicted panelists working independently reviewed abstracts
for article inclusion. From their review, full-text articles were
obtained for data extraction, and risk of bias was established by
2 panelists rating articles independently of each other. Data
extraction was performed by the AAN staff guideline meth-
odologist and confirmed by panel members. The panel con-
sidered data for efficacy outcomes from randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). For harms, the panel considered data from
RCTs, cohort studies, case reports, and case series. Meta-
analyses were performed when appropriate. Before data anal-
ysis, the panel completed an anonymous survey to establish the
minimal clinically meaningful difference for measures of DMT
efficacy and AEs; this information was used in the analytic
portion of the guideline. Conclusions were developed using
a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, De-
velopment and Evaluation process.8
Analysis of evidence
Twenty Cochrane systematic reviews were identified and used in
the evidence review process. These systematic reviews included
data from 70 RCTs, which were included in the panel’s evidence
synthesis. For the update of the Cochrane reviews and de novo
systematic review (completed November 2016), the combined
searches yielded 4,301 abstracts. Each abstract was reviewed for
relevance by at least 2 panel members, who deemed 284 as
relevant. The corresponding articles were obtained for full-text
review by 2 panelists working independently of each other. An
additional 73 articles were identified for data extraction.
All trials included individuals with MS aged 18 years or older.
The maximum age of participants varied across trials but was
usually between 50 and 60 years. Most studies were 2 years in
length (range 6 months–3 years). Trials occurred in multiple
countries worldwide. Twenty-three DMTs were systemati-
cally reviewed: methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, pulsed
corticosteroids for disease modification, interferon-β (IFN-β)
(4 types: IFN-β-1b subcutaneous alternate day, IFN-β-1a
intramuscular [IM] subcutaneous, pegylated IFN sub-
cutaneous every other week, IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times
per week), glatiramer acetate (3 types: proprietary daily
20-mg subcutaneous form, proprietary 3-day-per-week 40-mg
subcutaneous form, generic 20-mg subcutaneous daily form),
natalizumab, azathioprine, teriflunomide, mycophenolate
mofetil, rituximab, ocrelizumab, daclizumab, mitoxantrone,
alemtuzumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, IV immuno-
globulin for disease modification, and cladribine.
Safety note: After US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval was received, daclizumab (ZINBRYTA) was
voluntarily removed from the market on March 2, 2018, by its
manufacturers, Biogen and AbbVie, due to serious adverse
events in relapsing MS.8a
The results of the systematic review support the following
evidence-based conclusions. All recommendations are pro-
vided in the companion publication.1
1. In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to
placebo or other DMTs as measured by ARRs
and the relative risk of relapse at 2 years?
For this question, figure 1 presents the data regarding ARRs,
and figure 2 presents the data on the relative risk of relapse at 2
years. The table shows the findings and conclusions for both
the ARRs and the relative risk of relapse at 2 years.
2. In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to
placebo or other DMTs in reducing MRI new
disease activity as measured by new T2 lesion
burden or atrophy measures?
Risk of new or enlarging T2 lesions
The following DMTs are more effective than placebo in re-
ducing the risk of MRI-detected new or enlarging T2 lesions
(high confidence): fingolimod,9,10 IFN-β-1a 44 μg sub-
cutaneous 3 times weekly,11 and natalizumab.12
Ocrelizumab13 is more effective than IFN-β-1a subcutaneous
3 times per week in reducing the risk of new or enlarging T2
lesions detected by MRI (high confidence).
Cladribine14 is probably more effective than placebo in re-
ducing the risk of new or enlarging T2 lesions detected by
MRI (moderate confidence).
The following DMTs are probably more effective than other
DMTs in reducing the risk of MRI-detected new or enlarging
T2 lesions (moderate confidence): alemtuzumab (vs IFN-
β-1a subcutaneous 3 times per week),15 fingolimod (vs IFN-
β-1a IM once weekly),16 IFN-β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous
3 times weekly (vs IFN-β-1a IM once weekly).17
IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times per week is possibly no more
effective than glatiramer acetate in decreasing the risk of MRI-
detected new or enlarging T2 lesions (low confidence).18
There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of
azathioprine compared with IFN-β19 in reducing the risk of MRI-
detected new or enlarging T2 lesions (very low confidence).
Reducing the volume or number of T2 lesions
The following DMTs are more effective than placebo in
reducing the volume or number of MRI-detected T2 lesions
(high confidence): daclizumab high-yield process (HYP),20
dimethyl fumarate,18,21 glatiramer acetate,18 IFN-β-1a
30 μg IM weekly,22 mitoxantrone,23 natalizumab,12 and
pegylated IFN.24 See the safety note on this page.8a

cutaneous 3 times weekly in reducing loss of parenchymal
volume (high confidence).
Alemtuzumab is probably more effective than IFN-β-1a 44 μg

renchymal volume (very low confidence): IFN-β-1a 30 μg IM
weekly22 and mycophenolate mofetil added to IFN-β-1a 30 μg
IM weekly.31
3. In people with RRMS, are DMTs superior to
placebo or other DMTs in preventing disease
progression as measured by in-study disease
progression measures?
The most consistently reported measure for in-study
disability progression was the proportion of people with
MS with disability progression. Disability progression was
defined
by
an
increase
in
the
Expanded
Disability
Status Scale (EDSS) of 1 point in those with a baseline
EDSS score of 5.0 or lower, or an increase of 0.5 point in
those with a baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or higher, sustained
for 3 or 6 months, and detected over a 2-year study period
(figure 3).
The following DMTs are more effective than placebo in re-
ducing the risk of disability progression in people with RRMS
(high
confidence):
daclizumab
HYP,20
dimethyl
fumarate,18,21 fingolimod,9,10 IFN-β-1a 30 μg IM weekly,22,32

The following DMTs are more effective than other DMTs in
reducing the risk of disability progression in people with
RRMS (high confidence): alemtuzumab (vs IFN-β-1a 44 μg
subcutaneous 3 times weekly) 15,29 and ocrelizumab (vs IFN-
β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous 3 times weekly).13
Cladribine14 is probably more effective than placebo in re-
ducing the risk of disability progression in people with RRMS
(moderate confidence).

subcutaneous alternate day,e1 and methotrexate.e2
IFN-β-1b alternate day is probably less effective than glatir-
amer acetate in reducing the risk of disability progression over

4. In people with RRMS who experience disease
activity while on a DMT, is changing to
a different DMT superior to continuing the
present DMT in terms of relapse rate and MRI-
detected T2 or gadolinium-enhanced
lesion activity?
For individuals with RRMS who experienced a relapse on
IFN-β or glatiramer acetate, alemtuzumab is more effective
than IFN-β-1a 44 μg subcutaneous 3 times per week in re-
ducing the ARR, the relapse risk, disability progression, and
risk of new or enlarging T2 lesions over 2 years (high
confidence).15
In individuals with RRMS who experience 1 or more relapses
in the preceding 12 months on IFN-β, adding natalizumab is
more effective than adding placebo in decreasing the risk of
relapse over 2 years, the ARR, the risk of disability progression
over 2 years, and the risk of new or enlarging T2 lesions at
1 year (high confidence).e3
In individuals with RRMS who experienced one or
more relapses in the preceding 12 months on glatiramer ac-
etate, there is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of
natalizumab added to glatiramer acetate compared with pla-
cebo added to glatiramer acetate in decreasing the risk of
relapse at 6 months (very low confidence).e4
Natalizumab added to glatiramer acetate is probably more
effective than placebo added to glatiramer acetate in

lesions at 6 months (moderate confidence).e4
Note
that
natalizumab
is
not
presently
approved/
recommended as an add-on therapy to other DMTs owing
to potential safety concerns associated with combined use of
this medication.
5. In people with progressive MS, are DMTs
superior to placebo or other DMTs as measured
by relapse rate or in-study
disease progression?
Risk of relapse
Figure 4 presents these data regarding risk of relapse. IFN-
β-1b subcutaneous alternate day (SPMS) is more effective
than placebo in reducing the risk of relapse in people with
progressive MS (high confidence).e5,e6
The following DMTs are probably more effective than placebo
in reducing the risk of relapse in people with progressive MS
(moderate confidence): IFN-β-1a 60 μg IM weekly (SPMS)e7
and mitoxantrone (worsening RRMS and SPMS).e8
There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of the
following DMTs compared with placebo in reducing the risk
of relapse in people with progressive MS (very low confi-
dence): azathioprine,38 immunoglobulins,e9,e10 and metho-
trexate (chronic progressive MS, older terminology that is
undefined but included present PPMS and SPMS disease
types).e11 There is insufficient evidence to determine the
efficacy of high-dose corticosteroids compared with low-dose
corticosteroidse12 in reducing the risk of relapse in people
with SPMS (very low confidence).
Disability progression
The following DMTs are probably more effective than pla-
cebo in reducing the risk of in-study disability progression in
people with progressive MS (RRMS or SPMS; moderate
confidence): mitoxantrone (worsening RRMS and SPMS)e13
and ocrelizumab (PPMS).e14
The following DMTs are possibly no more effective than
placebo in reducing the risk of in-study disability progression
in people with progressive MS (low confidence): cladribine
(SPMS),e15
fingolimod
(PPMS),e16
glatiramer
acetate
(progressive forms of MSe17 and PPMSe18), IFN-β-1a 30 μg
IM weekly (SPMSe7 and PPMSe19), IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3
times per week (SPMS),e20 IFN-β-1b subcutaneous alternate
day (SPMSe5,e6 and PPMSe21), and rituximab (PPMS).e22
There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of the
following DMTs relative to placebo in reducing the risk of in-
study disability progression in people with progressive MS
(very low confidence): azathioprine,38 corticosteroids added
to mitoxantrone,e23 cyclophosphamide,e24,e25 immunoglobu-
lins,e9,e10 and methotrexate (CPMS [PPMS]).e11
There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of
high-dose corticosteroids relative to low-dose cortico-
steroidse26 in reducing the risk of in-study disability pro-
gression
in
people
with
progressive
MS
(very
low
confidence).
6. What are the AEs of DMTs in people with MS
compared with placebo (AE-related
discontinuation and serious or life-
threatening AEs)?
A comprehensive review of adverse effects associated with
DMTs is included in the full-text document (data supplement
to the companion recommendations article, links.lww.com/
WNL/A429) and table.
7. In people with CIS, are DMTs superior to
placebo in decreasing the risk of conversion
to MS?
Figure 5 presents the data regarding risk of conversion to MS
in people with CIS. For individuals with CIS, the following
DMTs are more effective than placebo in reducing the pro-
portion of individuals converting to MS (high confidence):
glatiramer acetatee27 and IFN-β-1a subcutaneous 3 times
weekly.e28

Discussion
Multiple DMTs are now approved for use in CIS or MS,
allowing people with MS and clinicians to consider DMT
mechanism of action, efficacy, and AE profile in the decision-
making process. This systematic review was used to develop
a practice guideline for the use of DMT for MS, acknowl-
edging the limits of current evidence. Measures of efficacy
such as long-term disability, patient satisfaction, quality of life,
and effects on MS symptoms may be important to the
decision-making process but ultimately remain inadequately
studied. Similarly, there is a dearth of high-quality evidence
pertaining to the comparative efficacy of specific DMTs or
various treatment strategies (e.g., high-efficacy treatment vs
stepped-care treatment protocols). Future studies addressing
these and other questions are needed to further inform
treatment recommendations, particularly those pertaining to
when to switch or stop DMTs.
