ardiovascular disease is a leading mortality cause, 
which, despite a recent decline, still contributes to 
4 million deaths per year, that is, almost half of all deaths 
in Europe, whereof ≈30% occurred at <65 years of age.1 
It contributes to 22% of all disability-adjusted life-years 
lost in the European Union and a hospital discharge rate 
of 2400/100 000 inhabitants.2 Although traditional risk fac-
tors are behind a substantial proportion of cardiovascular 
disease, other factors are important.3 Chronic inflammation 
accelerates the progress of atherosclerosis, and inflamma-
tory activation increases the risk for plaque rupture leading 
to acute coronary syndromes.4,5

Clinical Perspective on p 583
Periodontal diseases are inflammatory conditions ranging 
from gingivitis to severe periodontitis, the latter with a prevalence 
of 9% in the western European population.6 The prevalence is 
age dependent as exemplified by a survey from the United States 
where it increased from 11% in the age group 50 to 65 years to 
20% among those >75 years.7 The disease, which is diagnosed 
by clinical and radiographic examination,8 is a chronic tissue-
destructive inflammatory state, predominantly induced by Gram-
negative bacteria colonizing the gingival crevice.9
Background—The relationship between periodontitis (PD) and cardiovascular disease is debated. PD is common in patients 
with cardiovascular disease. It has been postulated that PD could be causally related to the risk for cardiovascular disease, 
a hypothesis tested in the Periodontitis and Its Relation to Coronary Artery Disease (PAROKRANK) study.
Methods and Results—Eight hundred five patients (<75 years of age) with a first myocardial infarction (MI) and 805 
age- (mean 62±8), sex- (male 81%), and area-matched controls without MI underwent standardized dental examination 
including panoramic x-ray. The periodontal status was defined as healthy (≥80% remaining bone) or as mild-moderate 
(from 79% to 66%) or severe PD (<66%). Great efforts were made to collect information on possibly related confounders 
(≈100 variables). Statistical comparisons included the Student pairwise t test and the McNemar test in 2×2 contingency 
tables. Contingency tables exceeding 2×2 with ranked alternatives were tested by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Odds ratios 
(95% confidence intervals) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. PD was more common (43%) in patients 
than in controls (33%; P<0.001). There was an increased risk for MI among those with PD (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.21–1.83), which remained significant (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.60) after 
adjusting for variables that differed between patients and controls (smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, years of education, 
and marital status).
Conclusions—In this large case–control study of PD, verified by radiographic bone loss and with a careful consideration 
of potential confounders, the risk of a first MI was significantly increased in patients with PD even after adjustment 
for confounding factors. These findings strengthen the possibility of an independent relationship between PD and 
MI.

 Rydén et al  Periodontitis and Myocardial Infarction  577
There is an association between periodontitis and cardio-
vascular disease.10,11 The character of this association is under 
debate. An obvious possibility is that the diseases are promoted 
by shared risk factors, but it has also been postulated, although 
not confirmed, that periodontitis in itself may cause cardiovas-
cular disease. In support of a causal relationship, it has been 
claimed that periodontal treatment lowers C-reactive protein and 
low-density lipoproteins and improves endothelial function.12–15 
Such findings, addressing surrogate end points and not cardio-
vascular events, must be interpreted with caution, leaving an 
uncertainty regarding the true nature of the association between 
periodontal and cardiovascular disease. This knowledge gap was 
recently recognized by the American Heart Association in the 
following way …“statements that imply a causative association 
between periodontal disease and specific atherosclerotic vascu-
lar disease events or claim that therapeutic interventions may be 
useful on the basis of that assumption are unwarranted.”16
The hypothesis behind the present investigation, 
Periodontitis and Its Relation to Coronary Artery Disease 
(PAROKRANK), was that there could be an independent rela-
tionship between periodontitis and the development of a first 
myocardial infarction.
Methods
PAROKRANK is a multicenter case–control study, recruiting patients 
May 2010 through February 2014 at 17 Swedish hospitals. The study 
centers all had a coronary care unit linked to the Swedish National 
quality registry SWEDEHEART17 and a dental care unit at the hos-
pital or in its close proximity. The study was coordinated from the 
Cardiology Unit, Department of Medicine at Karolinska Institutet, 
Stockholm.
Patients <75 years of age hospitalized for a first myocardial 
infarction according to international criteria18,19 were included follow-
ing informed consent. Exclusion criteria were previous myocardial 
infarction, previous heart valve replacement, and any other condition 
that, according to the judgment of the investigator, could limit the 
ability to cope with the protocol.
Controls from the same postal code area as the corresponding 
patient were randomly selected from the national population registry. 
They were of the same sex and age (±3 months). A list of candidates 
was generated from which contact was started with the person clos-
est in age. A research nurse at the PAROKRANK coordinating center 
approached this person by telephone providing study information and 
collecting information on the relevant medical history. To be selected as 
a control, the contacted person had to be willing to participate and free 
from previous myocardial infarction and heart valve replacement. The 
next person on the list was approached if the first contacted person could 
not be reached, refused, or did not fit the criteria. Contact information 
to the selected control persons was subsequently sent to the local study 
center where written informed consent to participate was obtained. The 
number of persons approached to recruit 1 control was ≈4.
Study Protocol
Patients were recruited during their hospital stay and scheduled for 
outpatient visits 6 to 10 weeks later at the local departments of car-
diology and dental medicine. To perform the investigations during 
the same season, the matched control persons were contacted usually 
within 10 days after the outpatient visit of their corresponding patients.
Study participants, patients and controls, fasted 12 hours, includ-
ing no smoking, before the visit at the cardiology department where 
a physical examination including heart rate, blood pressure follow-
ing 5 minutes of rest in a sitting position, height, body weight, and 
waist circumference was performed. Venous blood was sampled for 
the following analyses performed at the local laboratory: complete 
blood count, P-lipids (total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
and triglycerides), P-creatinine, P-fibrinogen, P-glucose, and glyco-
hemoglobin A1c. Study participants without known diabetes melli-
tus underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (75 g glucose in 200 
mL water) with venous P-glucose measured in the fasting state and 2 
hours after glucose intake. The point-of-care HemoCue 201 System 
(HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) was used for the P-glucose 
analysis. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was analyzed at a central 
laboratory (redhot diagnostics, Södertälje, Sweden) by means of an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (MP Biomedicals, New 
York, NY) intended for quantitative determination of C-reactive pro-
tein, with the functional sensitivity of 0.1 mg/L. In addition, whole 
blood (4 mL) and plasma (6 mL) were collected and stored at –70°C 
in a central bio bank at Karolinska Institutet. A set of questionnaires 
including information on family and medical history, risk, and health-
preserving factors were completed together with the Montgomery 
Åsberg Depression Rating Scale20.
The national quality registry SWEDEHEART (www.swedeheart.
se) was used to amass medical information from the patients at the 
time of their initial hospitalization (Swedish Register of Information 
and Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions 
[RIKS-HIA]) and at the secondary prevention follow-up (Secondary 
Prevention after Heart Intensive Care Admission [SEPHIA]) 6 to 10 
weeks after the myocardial infarction.17 The registry was modified to 
comply with the study needs. Equivalent information was collected 
for the control population with data entered into a separate database. 
Smoking habits were defined as current, previous (stopped >1 month 
ago), or never, and are for patients, as ongoing pharmacological treat-
ment, presented both at the time for hospital admission and follow-up.
Definitions
Myocardial infarction was diagnosed by the physician in charge 
according to international criteria on an acute ST or non–ST-segment–
elevation myocardial infarction as issued during the study period.18,19
The presence of a family history of cardiovascular disease (close 
relative with cardiovascular disease at <60 years of age) and the pres-
ence of peripheral artery, rheumatic, pulmonary, and kidney disease, 
and cancer and depression, as well, was based on self-reported infor-
mation in standardized questionnaires. The diagnoses of hyperten-
sion, diabetes mellitus, and stroke were based on a medical history 
obtained by the study personnel.
Dental Examinations
The dental examination followed a standardized protocol. The maxi-
mum number of teeth was 28 because the third molars were excluded. 
Dentures, complete, partial, and a complete implant bridge, in either 
jaw, were classified as removable dentures. Analogue or digital pan-
oramic radiographs were taken from both dentate and edentulous 
subjects at the local centers for central analysis at the Department 
of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet Huddinge, by means of 
a computer program, ImageJ (Image Tool 3.0 software program, 
Department of Dental Diagnostics Science, University of Texas 
Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Measurements were per-
formed with a high-resolution computer monitor in a darkened room. 
Each tooth was measured at the site with the most pronounced bone 
loss. Measurements were, as delineated in the Figure, made from the 
marginal bone crest to the tooth apex (total bone height) and from the 
cementoenamel junction to the tooth apex (total root length) mesi-
ally and distally.21 The arithmetic mean, calculated from the total root 
length and bone height, was used as a measure of the proportion of 
remaining bone height supporting each tooth. Measurements were 
made of all teeth with visible cementoenamel junctions and visible 
apices. Dental implants were not examined. Participants were sub-
sequently, based on the mean value of all teeth, allocated to the fol-
lowing groups: healthy (≥80% remaining bone), mild to moderate 
periodontitis (from 79% to 66%), and severe periodontitis (<66%). 
The radiographic examinations were performed by 3 dentists blinded 
to whether the panoramic radiograph came from a patient or a control 
and trained in the use of the equipment. For interindividual calibra-
tion purposes, 42 randomly selected panoramic radiographs were

examined. These dental x-rays were graded by 3 dentists, ie, in 126 
separate observations. The 3 graders were in complete agreement in 
121 of these observations (96%). The correlation between dentist 1 
and 2 was 0.95, the correlation between 1 and 3 was 0.90, and the 
correlation between 2 and 3 was 0.90 (κ value, 0.82).
Ethical Approval
The PAROKRANK study was approved by the Regional Ethics 
Committee at Stockholm (Dnr:2008/152-31/2) before the study, 
and all patients provided written informed consent. PAROKRANK 
was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Helsinki 
Declaration.
Statistical Considerations
Calculations based on an assumed prevalence of severe periodontitis 
in the Swedish population22 supported by an analysis of the first 120 
patients and 120 controls in PAROKRANK revealed that, to detect 
an increased risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.4) among 
subjects with periodontitis with a power of 80%, there was a need for 
800 patients and a similar number of matched controls.
Statistical comparisons to test differences between the 2 groups 
were made by use of the Student t test for matched pairs, and, to 
evaluate hypotheses of variables in 2×2 contingency tables for 
matched pairs, the McNemar test was used. Contingency tables 
larger than 2×2 with ranked ordered alternatives were tested by the 
use of the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Odds ratios, crude and adjusted 
for confounders, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 
calculated by the use of conditional logistic regression. In addition, 
descriptive statistics were used to characterize the data. All analy-
ses were performed by the use of the SAS system (The SAS system 
for Windows 9.4, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), and the 5% level of 
significance was considered. In the case of a statistically significant 
result, the P value has been given.
Results
When first asked, 922 patients accepted participation, but 117 
(13%) withdrew their consent before follow-up, leaving 805 
fully investigated patients and 805 controls according to the 
protocol. Their mean age was 62±8 years and 81% were men.
Clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. Several 
variables, eg, a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
kidney disease, and rheumatic disease did not differ between 
the 2 groups. A family history of cardiovascular disorders 
was more common in patients than controls. In comparison 
with the control population, smoking was more frequent 
among patients at admission. Pulmonary diseases (chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and asthma) did 
not differ between the groups. Of the components, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease was more common among 
patients than controls (4.4 versus 1.9%; P=0.005). The oral 
glucose tolerance test disclosed that 74 patients (9.3%) and 42 
controls (5.2%; P<0.003) had previously undetected diabetes 
mellitus. When added to the participants with already known 
diabetes mellitus (see Table 1), the total number of patients 
and controls with diabetes mellitus was 153 (19.1%) and 107 
(13.3%; P<0.002). The use of cardiovascular treatment (aspi-
rin, β-blockade, renin-angiotensin inhibitors, and statins) did 
not differ significantly in comparison between the patients at 
the time for admission and controls. The use of these drugs 
was, at the time of follow-up, significantly more common 
among patients than controls, which resulted in a lower blood 
pressure and lipids among patients than controls (Table 1). 
Factors expressing socioeconomic status (Table 2) showed a 
higher number with low education (66% versus 62%) and a 
higher rate of divorce among patients (15% versus 10%).
The number of remaining teeth was 24±6 in patients and 
25±5 (P<0.001) in controls. Dental x-rays were available in 
797 (99%) of the patients and 796 (99%) of the controls. Mild 
to moderate or severe periodontitis was present in 43% of the 
patients and 33% of the controls (P<0.001). The distribution 
on the 2 groups is presented in Table 3. The risk for myo-
cardial infarction was significantly increased among subjects 
with periodontitis with a crude odds ratio of 1.49 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.21–1.83). When edentulous participants 
(patients, 12; controls, 4) were excluded from the analysis of 
periodontal status, the corresponding prevalence was 41% 
versus 33% and the odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarc-
tion risk was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.19–1.80). Following statisti-
cal adjustments for confounders (diabetes mellitus, smoking 
habits, years of education, and marital status) and including 
edentulous participants, there was still a positive association 
between periodontitis and the risk of myocardial infarction 
with an OR of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.03–1.60).
Discussion
In this large study of the relation between periodontal disease 
and a first myocardial infarction, the risk was significantly 
increased in patients with moderate to severe periodontitis, 
objectively verified by radiographic bone loss and with a careful 
consideration of potential confounders. This finding strength-
ens the possibility of an independent relationship between peri-
odontitis and cardiovascular disease manifestations.
Several cross-sectional and case–control investigations 
have reported on a relation between periodontitis and cardio-
vascular disease. In an extensive meta-analysis by Blaizot et 
al,10 the pooled odds ratio from 22 case–control and cross-
sectional studies was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.87–2.96) and somewhat 
less in 7 cohort studies (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27–1.42). There 
was, however, a considerable heterogeneity in reported odds 
ratios from insignificant (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.77–1.51) to 
rather strong (OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 1.37–19.27) risk associations 
in other studies.23,24 This discrepancy is reasonably explained 
by 2 factors. The first relates to methodological issues such 
as too-small study populations, less strict definitions of 
Figure. Radiographic measurements were made from the 
marginal alveolar bone to the tooth apex (yellow line) and from 
the cementoenamel junction to the tooth apex (blue line). The 
examples show the left normal bone height and the right alveolar 
bone loss.

periodontitis, and information based on data retrieved from 
registries or questionnaires rather than examinations.25 The 
second is a suboptimal gathering of risk factors such as diet, 
smoking, overweight, diabetes mellitus, and stress, important 
for the development of cardiovascular and periodontal dis-
ease, as well.26 Incomplete adjustment for confounders may 
spuriously reinforce associations suggesting causality.11,16,27 
Thus, previous data are, as underlined by the American Heart 
Association,16 inconclusive regarding whether the relationship 
between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease is causal or 
coincidental and, therefore, in need of further evaluation.
The ideal study design to provide proof for the assump-
tion that periodontics is causally related to cardiovascular 
disease is a prospective trial randomly assigning people with 
periodontitis who are free from cardiovascular disease to den-
tal treatment or to be left untouched and with a composite of 
cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction and 
stroke as the primary end point. Such a study does not exist28 
and would be very difficult if at all possible to conduct. The 
major obstacles are the demands of a very large sample size 
of screen-detected subjects with periodontitis followed for a 
long time, probably in the magnitude of decades.29 Moreover, 
it may be considered unethical to deny people with estab-
lished dental disease treatment. A study design that could 
provide useful information on associations between various 
risk markers and myocardial infarction would be a carefully 
conducted case–control study as, for example, demonstrated 
over the years by the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program 
(SHEEP) a population-based case-referent study of causes of 
a first myocardial infarction.30–32 Experiences gained from 
SHEEP were used in the PAROKRANK protocol.
Several design features support the strength of the observed 
outcome in PAROKRANK, to the best of our knowledge the 
largest study of its kind. The study population was recruited 
from a large geographical area with the intention to cover 
the broadest possible distribution of participants representing 
a variety of educational and socioeconomic conditions. The 
cardiovascular disease manifestation was a first myocardial 
infarction, covering the 2 expressions of cardiovascular dis-
ease possibly influenced by periodontal disease, progressive 
atherosclerosis, and plaque rupture.4,5 An upper age limit of 
75 years was instituted to avoid a multiplicity of concomi-
tant disorders in people with more advanced cardiovascular 
disease. Great emphasis was put on careful characterization 
of patients and controls, ruling out, so far, less-well-studied 
confounders, eg, glucometabolic state, socioeconomic fac-
tors, stress, and mental health, and by defining periodontitis 
with an objective, radiographic method, evaluated at a core 
center. To balance basic disturbing factors, age, sex, and geo-
graphic location, we matched 1 control to each patient. In this 
respect, we got 2 well-balanced groups (Table 1). Accounting 
for previous observations on the importance of diabetes mel-
litus, not only for myocardial infarction, but also periodontal 
disease,33–35 the presence of diabetes mellitus was extensively 
covered by including participants with previously undetected 
diabetes mellitus. The method used for grading the peri-
odontal disease, digital panoramic radiographs, has good 
agreement with other radiographic methods36,37 and good 
compatibility with other measures of periodontal disease and 
diagnostic methods.38–40
The primary goal of the study was to assess the rela-
tive risks for first-time myocardial infarction based on 
calculations of odds ratios using patients with myocardial 
infarction and their controls. When checking for clinically 
relevant confounders in the univariate and multivariate anal-
yses, only factors unaffected by treatment administered to 
the patients were included. Based on the opinion that the 
presence of periodontitis in patients and controls are inde-
pendent of each other, we used methods for independent 
measures when testing our primary hypothesis. Diabetes 
mellitus, smoking habits, years of education, and marital 
status were considered as relevant confounders and there-
fore included in the adjusted statistical model. Other factors 
that possibly could be mediators between periodontal and 
cardiovascular disease, ie, reflecting reversed causality such 
as markers of inflammatory activation, were not included 
and, by similar reason, the Montgomery Åsberg Depression 
Rating Scale was omitted.
The decision to investigate the patients 6 to 10 weeks 
after the index infarction was based on several reasons. First, 
periodontitis usually starts by the age of 35 to 40 years and 
progression to the in PAROKRANK as moderate to severe 
defined states takes many years.11 Accordingly, a potential 
difference between patients and controls can be considered 
independent of this delay. Another and important reason was

to avoid the influence of the acute infarction on inflammatory 
activation and glucose metabolism. Finally, an earlier investi-
gation had to be balanced against the increased risk for bleed-
ing with dental examinations in the immediate postinfarction 
period. Information gained from questionnaires, the medical 
history, and the use of pharmacological treatment at admission 
should reflect the period during which the periodontal disease 
may provoke atherosclerosis and the development of myocar-
dial infarction. As demonstrated in Table 1, it seems as if such 
cardiovascular risk factors as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and 
(known) diabetes mellitus had been detected and treated in 
similar proportions of patients and controls, thereby limiting 
their confounding influence in this fairly homogeneous popu-
lation, apart from smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, and fam-
ily history.
PAROKRANK showed a positive association between 
periodontitis and a first myocardial infarction, which 
remained following adjustment for the differences in clinical 
characteristics between patients and controls. This strength-
ens the possibility of an independent relationship between 
periodontitis and the risk for cardiovascular disease pres-
ently expressed as myocardial infarction. There are several 
possible reasons for a potential causal relationship. Chewing, 
tooth brushing, and dental treatments transfer microorgan-
isms from dental pockets into the blood stream causing 
bacteremia and systemic inflammation.11 This may provoke 
accelerated atherosclerotic vascular damage, aggregation of 
platelets, and the development of thrombotic material, all of 
which are important for the development of acute myocar-
dial infarction.41 DNA from oral microorganisms has indeed 
been identified in atherosclerotic plaques.42,43 The outcome 
of PAROKRANK makes further and more detailed analy-
ses of the character of the association of great interest. Such 
studies, including a close look at the importance of diabe-
tes mellitus and other forms of dysglycemia and of various 
inflammatory markers, are underway in an attempt to find 
the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the connection 
between the 2 diseases.
The ongoing long-term follow-up of PAROKRANK, 
looking both at risk for recurrent cardiovascular events among 
cases and risks for cardiovascular events among patients and 
controls with and without periodontitis, as well, will be of con-
siderable interest in the light of the present findings. A positive 
relationship between the severity of periodontal disease and 
subsequent cardiovascular events would further strengthen a 
potential causal character of the relation between periodontitis 
and cardiovascular disease.
Strength and Limitations
The careful case–control design with patients and controls 
recruited from a representative sample of Swedish hospitals 
and with a large number of important variables covered is the 
major strength of the present study. Another strength is the 
use of bone loss as an objective indication of the severity of 
the periodontal disease. Moreover, and to avoid interpretation 
bias, trained and blinded dentists examined all radiographs 
centrally according to predefined definitions. Clinical evalua-
tion of periodontitis was also performed, but not used as a cri-
terion in this study because of the difficulties in controlling the 
representativity of this type of classification, which depends 
on the investigator to a considerable extent. The major limita-
tion is that PAROKRANK is an observational study, which 
can support but not prove the concept of a causal relationship. 
This limitation will, at least in part, be overcome by the ongo-
ing follow-up for which Sweden offers excellent possibili-
ties through the nationwide registries of hospital admissions, 
myocardial infarctions, and coronary interventions. Thus, a 
follow-up may continue over a considerable period of time, 
which may be necessary because the contemporary prognosis 
after a first myocardial infarction is fairly benign.15
In conclusion, PAROKRANK makes it likely that peri-
odontitis could be looked on as a risk factor of first-time 
myocardial infarction, which seemingly is independent of 
a multitude of other risk factors. This observation should 
increase the interest in preventing and treating periodontal 
disease with the intention to improve both dental and cardio-
vascular health in the population.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
PAROKRANK, a Swedish case–control study recruiting 805 patients with a first myocardial infarction and the same number 
of controls matched for age, sex, and geographical area, explored whether the relation between periodontitis and cardio-
vascular disease is related to shared risk factors or if there may be a causal relationship. The presence of periodontitis was 
significantly higher among patients than controls, and the risk to develop myocardial infarction was significantly higher in 
the presence of moderate to severe periodontal disease even after adjustment for potential confounders, of which smoking 
and dysglycemia were the most important. These findings strengthen the concept that the relation between periodontal and 
cardiovascular disease may be causal, thereby opening the way for further exploration of pathophysiological mechanisms. 
In clinical practice, these findings confirm that periodontal disease should be searched for and treated, not only to improve 
dental health, but also to improve cardiovascular health, as well.
