Abstract
Respiratory syncytia virus (RSV) infection is a common respiratory infection in infants and children for which there
is a need for new therapies. Viral attachment appears to be mediated by interaction of the G protein with negatively
charged carbohydrates such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the cell surface. DAS181 is a bifunctional fusion
protein comprised of a sialidase linked to a polycationic sequence derived from human amphiregulin (hAR) that
allows the molecule to target the sialidase enzymatic activity to GAGs. Based on the ability of DAS181 to bind to
cell-surface GAGs we investigated whether DAS181 might interrupt RSV infection of Hep-2 cells by virtue of its
unique hAR sequence. We report here that pre-exposure of Hep-2 cells to DAS181 appears to block infectivity of
RSV of Hep-2 cells with an estimated IC50 value of 13.40 µM (p=0.009). In comparison, ribavirin exhibited an IC50
of 44.55 µM (p=0.004) under the same conditions. These data suggest that the expression of the hAR sequence
may be sufficient to block RSV infection of Hep-2 cells and thus may provide a novel approach to target RSV
infection.

Introduction
RSV is the major cause of respiratory infections in infants and
children as well as infections in elderly and immunocompromised
subjects [1-5]. The only approved treatment is ribavirin, a nucleoside
inhibitor [5]. Recent studies have suggested that the humanized mAb
palivizumab, which targets the fusion protein of RSV, may be effective
for prophylaxis of RSV in high risk infants [6] to prevent
hospitalization. However, a need still exists for new agents to prevent
and treat RSV infection.
The first step in RSV infection is the binding of RSV (G)
glycoprotein to cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) particularly
heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the target cell [7,8].
Interrupting this initial step in viral infection could provide a viable
target to treat RSV infection. HSPG’s are present on normal human
bronchial epithelial cells [9,10] and basal cells [11] but not on cultured
human airway epithelial cells (HAEs). Soluble heparin can inhibit the
initial culture passage of primary isolates of RSV presumably through
the biding of the anionic heparin to the G protein of RSV [12]. This
ability to bind heparin has also been reported for the fusion protein of
RSV [13]. Unfortunately, targeting the virus G protein with heparin
based compounds is not feasible due to the potential side effects of
heparin and its derivatives.
DAS181 is a 44kD novel fusion protein comprised of a sialidase
catalytic domain fused to a GAG-binding domain from human
amphiregulin (hAR), which localizes and retains the fusion protein to
the respiratory epithelium [3]. Amphiregulin (AR) is composed of a C-
terminal EGF-like domain and an N-terminal GAG-binding domain
[14]. DAS181 expresses only a portion of the N-terminal GAG-binding
sequence of amphiregulin, which enables DAS181 to bind to heparin-
like polysaccharides but does not confer the EGF-like activity of the
full length amphiregulin.
Sialic acids have not been reported to play a role in RSV infectivity.
Recently it has been reported that cationic sequences derived from
chemokines have the ability to block RSV infection, via competition
with cell surface GAGs [15]. Based on its ability to bind to cell-surface
GAGs we investigated whether constructs expressing the hAR GAG
binding sequence with (DAS181) or without (DAS185) sialidase
activity could inhibit infection of Hep-2 cells. These results were
compared to the activity of ribavirin under the same experimental
conditions. Our results suggest that these hAR expressing compounds
may inhibit RSV infection of Hep-2 cells at concentrations superior to
ribavirin.
Materials and Methods
DAS180, DAS181, DAS185
Test compounds (DAS181, DAS185 and DAS180) were kindly
provided by Ansun Biopharma. DAS181 consists of a GAG binding
domain derived from amphiregulin (amino acid residues 125 to 145 in
GenBank entry AAH09799) fused via its N terminus to the catalytic
domain of A. viscosus sialidase (AvCD, amino acid residues 274 to 667
in GenBank entry X62276) [4]. DAS185 is a mutated (Y348F) sialidase
expressing construct that has the identical GAG binding amphiregulin
tag but exhibits 400 fold reduced sialidase activity compared to
DAS181. DAS180 is a sialidase expressing construct without the GAG
binding amphiregulin tag. The drugs were supplied as a dry powder
and solubilized in sterile PBS to a stock concentration of 50 mg/ml.
Cell and virus
Hep-2 cells were maintained at 37oC, 5% CO2 in MEM+10% FBS.
The RSV strain A2 was amplified in Hep-2 cells at 37oC, 5% CO2 in
Opti-MEM+2% FBS. The viral stock was titrated with methylcellulose
0.8% in 24-well plates and diluted to 40 PFU/ml (MOI 0.00016) in
order to perform the assay.

 Binding of DAS181 and 185 to human airway epithelial cells
To detect levels of cell surface binding of DAS180, DAS181and
DAS185 HAE monolayers were treated with increasing concentrations
(μg/mL) of each of the constructs at 37ºC for 2 h. Binding was revealed
by staining the cells with sialidase specific affinity purified sheep anti-
DAS sialidase sequence specific antibody followed by an HRP
conjugated mouse anti-sheep antibody.
Determination of IC50 of compounds on Hep-2 cells
Hep-2 cells were seeded in 24-well plates to 90% confluence.
DAS180, DAS181 and DAS185 compounds were diluted in MEM+10%
FBS at concentrations ranging from 20 µM to 0.3125 µM and added to
the plates. Ribavirin was used as a positive control drug and tested
from 100 µM to 1 µM as described above. Assays for the three test
compounds and the positive control were performed in triplicate.
Plates were incubated at 37oC, 5% CO2 for 24 hours, washed with PBS
and then 500 µl of RSV containing 40 PFU/ml in Opti-MEM + 2% FBS
were added to the cells for 1.5 hr at 37oC, 5% CO2. The medium was
removed and cells were washed with PBS. An overlay of Opti-MEM 2x
+methylcellulose 1.6% 1:1 containing the same concentrations of DAS
compounds as in the pre-treatment step was added to the wells. The
plates were incubated at 37oC, 5% CO2 for 5 days. After the incubation
period, cells were fixed with 7% formalin for 1 h at room temperature.
RSV titers were determined using Goat anti-RSV Cederlane
MD-05-0391 antibody at 1/1000 followed by donkey anti-goat
Cederlane PA1-86326 antibody at 1/1000 and developed with KPL
True Blue to reveal infected cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration
(IC50) value was determined from the dose-response curve using the
program Excel. Statistical significance of the plaque reduction at the
highest concentration of DAS181, DAS185 and DAS180 relative to no
drug was determined by paired T test.
Results
As shown in Figure 1, both DAS181 and DAS185 bound to human
airway epithelium cells, while the amphiregulin derived sequence
deficient molecule DAS180 did not.
Figure 1:
Figure 1: DAS181 (hAR tag+), DAS185 (hAR tag+) and DAS180
(hAR tag-) binding to HAE cells.
These results demonstrate that expression of the hAR tag sequence
allows for binding of the DAS181 and DAS 185 molecules to the target
cell. To determine if these any of constructs could inhibit RSV
infection of Hep-2 cells, the test compounds were pre-incubated with
Hep-2 cells at descending concentrations starting at 20 uM. Hep-2 cells
were exposed to ribavirin in a similar fashion starting at 100uM as a
positive control for inhibition of RSV infection of Hep-2 cells. As seen
in Figure 2 both DAS181 (2A) and DAS185 (2B) inhibited RSV in a
dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 13.40 µM (p=0.009)
and 12.74 µM (p=0.001) respectively. Suppression of RSV was not
observed with DAS180 (p=0.13), which expresses sialidase activity but
lacks the GAG binding domain (Figure 2C). The positive control
ribavirin exhibited an IC50 of 44.55 µM (p=0.004) under the same
conditions (Figure 3). No detectable cytotoxicity of DAS181, DAS185
or DAS180 on the Hep-2 cell line was observed in these studies. Based
on these results, we conclude that both DAS181 and DAS185 are
slightly more potent than ribavirin for inhibition of RSV infection of
Hep-2 cells.

Discussion
We show here that DAS181 is capable of blocking RSV infection of
Hep-2 cells by virtue of the hAR GAG binding portion of the molecule.
Similar activity was observed with DAS185, a control construct with a
mutated sialidase but a functional hAR tag. Previous reports have
shown a lack of sensitivity to sialic acid cleavage for Hep-2 cell
infection [16,17]. As predicted, DAS180, an analogue which contains
an active sialidase without the hAR GAG binding domain showed no
activity in this system. Based on the results presented here we conclude
that the inhibition of infection is due to the blocking of cell-surface
GAGs by DAS181 thereby prohibiting the binding of RSV to the Hep-2
cell membrane. RSV includes two subtypes (A and B) that are
distinguishable serologically due to differences in the structure of the G
protein [18]. This study only evaluated the activity of DAS181 on
subtype A. While it is possible that differences in the relative affinity
for GAGs could exist between A and B subtypes for DAS181
inhibition, DAS181 should be equally potent on both subtypes based
on the proposed mechanism of action described here. Studies with
clinical isolates can be undertaken in the future to examine the breadth
of activity against circulating strains of RSV. Finally, although the
possibility exists that the hAR tag could also bind to an as yet
unidentified viral-associated GAGs, to date no report of this moiety
has been reported on RSV particles.
One of the confounding factors with respiratory virus infection is
the identification of the causative pathogen (s). DAS181 has shown in-
vitro and in-vivo activity against influenza [19,20], parainfluenza [21]
and EV68 [22]. DAS181 has been examined in clinical trials for
influenza and parainfluenza viruses [23,24] with encouraging results.
These viruses all use sialic acid as the primary receptor. Negatively
charged 
glycosaminoglycans 
(GAGs), 
such 
as 
the 
sulfated
polysaccharides including heparin sulfate or keratin sulfate, are
ubiquitously present on the surface of respiratory epithelium and
function as a receptor for a number of viruses [12]. Thus, DAS181 may
also be useful in treating viruses that target GAGs for entry.
The advantages of using a host directed therapy are important to
note. Since DAS181 targets the host-cell respiratory epithelium and not
the virus [3], the chance for the generation of resistant viruses is
markedly lower. In addition, the ability of DAS181 to target binding,
the initial step in viral replication, allows for the potential combination
of DAS181 with other replication-specific drugs. These data presented
suggest that DAS181, an investigational host-directed antiviral, may
also be active against RSV. Additional studies are underway to further
test this hypothesis.
