Abstract
Background: Previous studies have suggested that modern obesogenic environments
accentuate the genetic risk of obesity. However, these studies have proven controversial
as to which, if any, measures of the environment accentuate genetic susceptibility to
high body mass index (BMI).
Methods: We used up to 120 000 adults from the UK Biobank study to test the hypothesis
that high-risk obesogenic environments and behaviours accentuate genetic susceptibility
to obesity. We used BMI as the outcome and a 69-variant genetic risk score (GRS) for
obesity and 12 measures of the obesogenic environment as exposures. These measures
included Townsend deprivation index (TDI) as a measure of socio-economic position, TV
watching, a ‘Westernized’ diet and physical activity. We performed several negative

simulated environment and including sun-protection use as an environment.
Results: We found gene–environment interactions with TDI (Pinteraction¼ 3 � 10–10), self-
reported

(Pinteraction ¼ 7� 10–5)
and
self-reported
physical
activity
(Pinteraction¼ 5 � 10–6). Within the group of 50% living in the most relatively deprived situ-
ations, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately 3.8 kg
extra weight in someone 1.73 m tall. In contrast, within the group of 50% living in the least
deprivation, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately
2.9 kg extra weight. The interactions were weaker, but present, with the negative controls,
including sun-protection use, indicating that residual confounding is likely.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the obesogenic environment accentuates the risk
of obesity in genetically susceptible adults. Of the factors we tested, relative social de-
privation best captures the aspects of the obesogenic environment responsible.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity is set to dramatically exceed tar-
gets set by the World Health Organization and place an in-
creasingly large burden on health services throughout the
world.1 Whilst environmental influences, including diet and
lifestyle, have caused the obesity epidemic,2 twin and family
studies show that genetic factors influence susceptibility to
obesity in today’s environment.3,4 Recent genetic studies
have identified many common genetic variants associated
with body mass index (BMI)5 but the role of genetic suscep-
tibility in different modern-day environments has proven
controversial. Different studies have concluded that phys-
ical inactivity6,7 and consuming more fried food,8 more
fizzy drinks9 or more protein10 accentuates the risk of obes-
ity in those genetically predisposed. These studies have
often concluded that their results highlight the need for
public health interventions targeted at the specific environ-
mental factors, e.g. ‘highlighting the particular importance
of reducing fried food consumption in individuals genetic-
ally predisposed to obesity’.8 Other studies have not identi-
fied interactions, most recently between the FTO variant
and weight loss.11 Previous studies have often had to rely
on
meta-analysis
of
data
from
many
heterogeneous
studies.6,7,12–14
Most
importantly,
unlike
main
effect
Mendelian randomization studies, gene x environment
interaction studies are susceptible to confounding.15,16 A re-
cent study, testing only the variant in the FTO locus, over-
came many of these issues by using a single large, relatively
homogeneous study—the UK Biobank—and testing many
measures of the environment in the same statistical
model.17
One objective but broad measure of the obesogenic envir-
onment is relative social deprivation. Social deprivation is
correlated with obesity in children18 and adults,19 and studies
show that people from more deprived backgrounds make
poorer food choices20 and tend to be less active.21 Whilst
people from more socially deprived backgrounds are more
overweight on average, few studies have tested the hypothesis
that deprivation accentuates genetic susceptibility to obesity.
An exception is the recent study using the UK Biobank that
nominally suggested that deprivation accentuates the BMI ef-
fect of the variant at the FTO locus (P ¼ 0.035).17
The UK Biobank study was designed to improve our
understanding of the interaction between genes and the en-
vironment in health and disease. It provides a unique op-
portunity
to
investigate
a
range
of
obesogenic
Key Messages
• This study suggests that something about the obesogenic environment accentuates the genetic risk of obesity.
• Caution needs to be taken when interpreting gene–environment interactions, as they are not immune from confound-
ing. We have illustrated this point by using a negative control ‘environment’ that is implausibly causal to obesity.
• In contrast to the conclusions from previous studies, this study demonstrates that there is unlikely to be any one par-
ticular aspect of the environment or behaviour that, if altered, would have a preferential benefit over others.
• It is premature to use genetic interaction studies to suggest that public health measures should be targeted specific-
ally at fried-food reduction, fizzy-drink consumption and diet in those genetically predisposed to obesity.

 environments and behaviours in a single large, relatively
homogeneous study. Here, we hypothesized that genetic
susceptibility to high BMI interacts with aspects of the obe-
sogenic environment and obesogenic behaviours to accen-
tuate the risk of obesity.
Materials and methods
UK Biobank participants
The UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 adults aged 37–73
years in 2006–10 from across the UK. Participants pro-
vided samples and a range of information via question-
naires, interviews and measurements.22 We used up to
119 733 adults of White British descent with genetic data,
BMI and at least one obesogenic variable available. We did
not include other ethnic groups, because individually they
were underpowered to detect previously reported effects.
British descent was defined as individuals who both self-
identified as White British and were confirmed as ances-
trally Caucasian using principal components analyses
(PCA) of genome-wide genetic information. This dataset
underwent extensive central quality control (http://bio
bank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk) including the exclusion of the majority
of third-degree or closer relatives from a genetic kinship
analysis of 96% of individuals. We performed an add-
itional round of PCA on these 120 286 UK Biobank partici-
pants. We selected 95 535 independent single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (pairwise r2< 0.1) directly geno-
typed with a minor allele frequency (MAF) � 2.5% and
missingness < 1.5% across all UK Biobank participants
with genetic data available at the time of this study
(n ¼ 152 732), and with HWE P > 1 � 10–6 within the
White British participants. Principal components were sub-
sequently generated using FlashPCA13 and the first five ad-
justed for in all analyses.
Patient involvement
Details of patient and public involvement in the UK
Biobank are available online (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.

nx6).
Phenotypes
BMI
The UK Biobank measured weight and height in all partici-
pants and calculated BMI. BMI was available for 119 883
individuals of White descent with genetic data available.
We performed analyses of BMI on both its natural (kg/m2)
and an inverse normalized scale to account for differences
in variances.
BMI, genetic data and at least one obesogenic meas-
ure
was
available
for
up
to
119 733
individuals
(Supplementary Table 1, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
Obesogenic environment and behaviour variables
The obesogenic environment refers to an environment that
promotes gaining weight and that is not conducive to
weight loss.23 Here we use the term ‘environment’ to refer
to any variable that describes a component to obesity that
is not genetic variation. Many of these measures are likely
to be a complex mixture of environment and behaviour.
For example, the number of fizzy drinks a person con-
sumes could be a mix of availability in the environment
and satiety.
We selected 12 measures of the obesogenic environment
including Townsend deprivation index (TDI) as a measure
of socio-economic position, sedentary time, TV watching,
physical activity (three measures), Western diet, percentage
protein and fat intake, fried-food consumption, fizzy-drink
consumption and a composite score of TV watching, sed-
entary time, physical activity and Westernized diet. As a
negative control, we chose a variable with an implausible
causal link to BMI: sun-protection use in the summer.
These measures were all self-reported at the same time as
BMI was measured with the exception of TDI and the ac-
celerometer data used to measure activity in a subset of in-
dividuals (n ¼ 19 229). Several measures were correlated
with each other, with a maximum correlation of R ¼ 0.64
between TV watching and sedentary time (Supplementary
Table 2, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
For presentation purposes, each obesogenic variable was
dichotomized to represent high and low exposure either at
the median or a specific cut-off as close to the median as
possible. For testing of interactions, we used continuous
measures of the environment because using thresholds to
select groups of individuals can inflate gene-BMI effect es-
timates if the variance of the environmental measure is
lower in the selected group than the comparison group.
The 12 measures of the obesogenic environment are
described below. All self-report measures were associated
with factors such as sex, measures of socio-economic pos-
ition (TDI) and type 2 diabetes in the expected directions,
(Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
TDI
The TDI is a composite measure of deprivation based on
unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership

 and household overcrowding; a negative value represents
high socio-economic position.24 TDI was calculated prior
to joining the UK Biobank and was based on the preceding
national census data, with each participant assigned a
score
corresponding
to
the
postcode
of
their
home
dwelling.
The TDI variable was skewed (Supplementary Figure 1,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online) and there-
fore we single inverse normalized this variable for use in
sensitivity analyses.
Job class
On finding an interaction with TDI, we tested more spe-
cific variables related to TDI including job class and num-
ber of years in education. The UK Biobank asked people to
select their current or most recent job. This was classified
into one of the following strata: elementary occupations,
process plant and machine operatives, sales and customer
service occupations, leisure and other personal service oc-
cupations, personal service occupations, skilled trades,
admin and secretarial roles, business and public sector as-
sociate professionals, associate professionals, professional
occupations, and managers and senior officials. Data were
available for 76 374 individuals.
Years in education
A variable based on the standardized 1997 International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) of the
United
Nations
Educational,
Scientific
and
Cultural
Organisation was created in the UK Biobank, using previ-
ously published guidelines.25 Data were available for
118 775 individuals.
Replication with TDI: CoLaus Study
The CoLaus Study26 is a population-based study including
over 6500 participants from Lausanne (Switzerland). This
study included inhabitants aged 35–75 years at baseline
(2003–06) and they were followed up between 2009 and
2012 (mean follow-up 5.5 years). Within this cohort, TDI
was available for 5237 individuals with BMI and BMI gen-
etic variants available. The use of TDI in Lausanne may
capture socio-economic position in a different way to the
UK Biobank, because e.g. not owning a car is not necessar-
ily correlated with precarity. The CoLaus Study complied
with Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
local Institutional Ethics Committee.
Replication with job class: 1958 Birth Cohort
The 1958 Birth Cohort27 has followed persons born in
England, Scotland and Wales during one week in 1958
from birth into middle age. Within this cohort, 6171 indi-
viduals had information on social class based on their own
current or most recent occupation (at age 42), BMI (meas-
ured at age 44–45) and genetic data.
Dietary information
All participants completed a generic diet questionnaire
during recruitment and a subset of 46 526 individuals com-
pleted up to five 24-h food frequency questionnaires
(FFQ). The FFQ focused on the consumption of approxi-
mately 200 commonly consumed food and drinks (http://
biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?i ¼118240).
For
each participant completing the food frequency question-
naire, nutrient intakes were estimated by multiplying the
quantity consumed by the nutrient composition of the food
or beverage, as taken from the UK food composition data-
base.28 The 46 526 participants with genetic data complet-
ing at least one standard (i.e. normal diet) FFQ were
included in this study. Where participants had completed
more than one FFQ for a standard day’s diet, an average
was calculated for the food group of interest.
Fizzy-drink consumption
Fizzy-drink consumption was determined from the FFQ
and represented number of glasses of fizzy drink consumed
on an average day. This was dichotomized at the median,
resulting in two groups: low risk (no fizzy drinks daily,
n ¼ 40 107) and high risk (at least one fizzy drink a day,
n ¼ 6419). No data on type of fizzy drink were available.
Fried-food intake
Fried-food intake was determined from the FFQ and com-
bined the reported intake of fried chicken and fried potato.
Percentage fat
Fat (in grams) consumed was taken from the UK Biobank-
derived nutrients information in the FFQ. The variable was
then divided by total energy intake (in kJ).
Percentage protein
Protein (in grams) consumed was taken from the UK
Biobank-derived nutrients information in the FFQ. The
variable was then divided by total energy intake (in kJ).
Calorie-dense ‘Western’ diet
The generic diet questionnaire was used to calculate the
average consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish (oily and
non-oily), meat (processed, poultry, beef, lamb and pork),
cheese, milk, bread, cereal, tea, coffee and water. To con-
dense this information, we performed a principal compo-
nent factor analysis. Seven eigenvalues were greater than 1,
factor 1 was considered to represent a calorie-dense
‘Western’ diet (high intake of prepared meals, processed
meats, crisps, etc.) and factor 2 represented a prudent diet

 (high intake of vegetables, fruit and fish). This information
was available for 94 040 individuals of White origin with
genetic data available.
Physical activity
International Physical Activity Questionnaire
The UK Biobank asked a range of questions about physical
activity questions to all participants. We derived the total
metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes of exercise
per week [based on the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ)]. This is calculated using the num-
ber of days and minutes per day spent walking, performing
moderate or vigorous activity and the speed of walking
variable. Individuals reporting more than 16 h of walking
and/or moderate and/or vigorous activity a day were
excluded (n ¼ 1589) on the grounds that these values were
likely to be an error or misreporting. All individuals report-
ing more than 3 h per day of walking, moderate or vigor-
ous activity were re-coded to 3 h as per IPAQ guidelines.29
The MET is a physiological measure expressing the en-
ergy cost (or calories) of physical activities. The numbers
of minutes per week for each level of exercise intensity
(walking, moderate and vigorous) are multiplied by spe-
cific MET values.30 MET values used for the short IPAQ
are 2.5 for slow walking, 3.3 for moderate walking and 5
for fast walking, 4 for moderate exercise and 8 for vigor-
ous exercise. Total MET minutes are calculated by sum-
ming MET minutes per week for walking, moderate and
vigorous exercise. The short form of IPAQ is validated30,31
and utilized in many studies into physical activity.32
Sedentary behaviour
The UK Biobank asked all participants about the hours per
day they spent (i) driving, (ii) using a computer and (iii) watch-
ing television. These three variables were summed to provide
the hours per day that participants spent sat down. Values
greater than 24h per day were excluded. Those reporting over
16h were re-coded to 16h. Sedentary time was available for
119688 individuals with genetic data available. We dichotom-
ized individuals into those who spent less than 5h a day seden-
tary (n¼ 63631) and those who spent 5 or more hours a day
sedentary (n¼ 56655).
TV watching
Participants in the UK Biobank were asked to report how
many hours they spent watching TV in a typical day. We
dichotomized individuals into those watching 4 or more
hours of TV per day (n ¼ 37 029) and those watching 3 h
or less (n ¼ 82 392). This was based on the median value
(3 h) but, due to lots of tied values, this resulted in imbal-
anced groups.
Vigorous activity
The minutes of vigorous activity per week were calculated
and, for display purposes, a dichotomous variable was also
derived denoting participants who performed more than
1 h of vigorous activity per week or not. Of the available
individuals, 35 242 reported more than 1 h of vigorous ac-
tivity per week, whilst 74 128 did not. This was the most
balanced way of dichotomizing this variable because only
21 676 individuals reported more than 2 h.
Measured physical activity with accelerometer data
Daily accelerometer data were available for 19 229 individ-
uals of White British origin with genetic data available for
a period of 6 d. A variable was derived from these data rep-
resenting the mean levels of moderate physical activity per
day for each individual.
Composite score of the obesogenic environment and
behaviour
Physical activity (as measured by IPAQ), sedentary time,
TV watching and Westernized diet were available in
86 549 individuals with BMI genetic variants available. We
did not use other variables, as they were only available in
smaller numbers. The obesogenic variables were combined
using a principle components factor analysis in STATA.
Only one factor had an eigenvalue of greater than 1 and
this was used as a composite score of the obesogenic
environment.
Negative control ‘environments’
We performed three negative control experiments.
Self-reported sun-protection use
First, we used sun-protection use as a negative control vari-
able to assess residual confounding. UK Biobank partici-
pants were asked ‘Do you wear sun protection (e.g.
sunscreen lotion, hat) when you spend time outdoors in the
summer?’ with the options: Never, Sometimes, Most of the
time, Always, Don’t go out in the sun, Don’t know and
Prefer not to answer. The variable was correlated with TDI
and BMI but is implausible as a mechanism (see the
Discussion section for why vitamin D exposure is unlikely
to be a mechanism in this context) (Supplementary Table
3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).

 Randomly selecting groups of individuals to be of different
average BMI
Second, we used a meta-heuristic sampling approach to
randomly select two groups of individuals with BMI distri-
butions identical to the high and low groups for observed
obesogenic
environment measures. For
example, this
method was used to select 59 712 individuals with a mean
BMI of 27.86 and a standard deviation of 5.12 represent-
ing the 50% of individuals in the lowest socio-economic
position and a group of 59 754 individuals with a mean
BMI of 27.19 and a standard deviation of 4.47 represent-
ing the 50% of individuals in the highest socio-economic
position. There was no overlap between individuals se-
lected for the two groups. Meta-heuristic sampling was re-
peated 100 times and the interaction P-values were
calculated each time. Here we report the results from the
median analysis based on the interaction P-value. We re-
peated this process 100 times to match average BMIs to
those for five dichotomized measures of the environment:
four that interacted (at P < 0.05): the composite score, self-
report physical activity, socio-economic position (TDI) and
TV watching; and one that did not interact (at P > 0.05)
but where BMI differences were substantial: fizzy-drink
consumption.
BMI GRS interactions with dummy ‘environments’
Third, we created dummy continuous variables as random
‘environments’. The new variables were created in STATA
by regressing the obesogenic variables on BMI, the BMI
GRS and a range of covariates (age, age2, sex) and taking
the fitted values and the residuals. The fitted value from
the regression was then added to random permutations of
the residuals (n ¼ 10 000) to produce 10 000 simulated
variables that associate with BMI in a similar way to the
real obesogenic variable, but are only minimally associated
with the real variable itself. This ensures that the simulated
variable has the same conditional expectations and same
residual distributions as the five real variables (physical ac-
tivity, TDI, TV watching, the composite score and fizzy-
drink consumption). Further information on this method is
provided
in
the
Supplementary
data
(available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). The interaction model
was run for all 10 000 simulations. Here we report the re-
sults from the median simulation (based on the interaction
P-values).
Selection of genetic variants associated with BMI
and GRS
We selected 69 of 76 common genetic variants that were
associated with BMI at genome-wide significance in the
GIANT consortium in studies of up to 339 224 individuals
(Supplementary Table 4, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).5 We used these variants to create a GRS to
represent genetic susceptibility to high BMI—we were not
testing specific variants for interaction, but instead how
genetic susceptibility overall may be influenced by environ-
mental and behavioural exposures. We used genotypes
imputed by UK Biobank. We limited the BMI SNPs to
those that were associated with BMI in the analysis of all
European ancestry individuals. Variants were excluded if
known to be classified as a secondary signal within a locus.
Three variants were excluded from the score due to poten-
tial pleiotropy [rs11030104 (BDNF reward phenotypes),
rs13107325 (SLC39A8 lipids, blood pressure), rs3888190
(SH2B1
multiple
traits)],
three
SNPs
not
in

Weinberg
Equilibrium
(P < 1 � 10–6;
rs17001654,
rs2075650, rs9925964) or the SNP was unavailable
(rs2033529).
The imputed dosages for each SNP were re-coded to
represent the number of BMI-increasing alleles for that
particular SNP. A BMI genetic risk score (GRS) was cre-
ated using the SNPs. Each allele associated with high BMI
was weighted by its relative effect size (b-coefficient) ob-
tained from the previously reported BMI meta-analysis
data.5 A weighted score was created [Equation (1)] in
which b is the b-coefficient representing the association be-
tween each SNP and BMI:
Weighted score ¼ b1 � SNP1 þ b2 � SNP2 þ . . . bn
� SNPn:
(1)
The weighted score was rescaled to reflect the number
of BMI-increasing alleles [Equation (2)]:
Weighted GRS ¼ weighted score x number of available SNPs
sum of the b coefficients of available SNPs :
(2)
Statistical analysis
The mean and standard deviation of BMI were calculated
in each of the pairs of obesogenic exposures.
For each of the measures of the obesogenic environ-
ment, we calculated the association between the 69 SNP
BMI GRS and BMI in the high-risk and low-risk environ-
ments using linear regression models. BMI was adjusted
for age, sex, five ancestry principal components and assess-
ment centre location. We additionally adjusted the full
model for genotyping platform (two were used).
Interactions between the genetic variables and the obe-
sogenic environment variables on BMI were tested by
including the respective interaction terms in the models

 [e.g. interaction term ¼ GRS � physical activity (continu-
ous)]. Continuous measures were used to limit spurious re-
sults
from
the
gene
x
environment
interactions
(Supplementary Methods, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
We performed the analyses in two ways. First, we ana-
lysed the data with BMI on its natural scale (kg/m2) (resi-
dualized for age, sex, centre location and five ancestry
principal components). Second, we inverse normalized the
data so that BMI, in all 20 strata, had a mean BMI of 0
and a SD of 1. This analysis allowed us to account for the
differences in BMI variation observed in high- and low-risk
strata. We present primary results from the inverse normal-
ized data. To further assess the extent to which differences
in BMI variation could influence our results, we tested for
heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test as imple-
mented with the estat hettest in STATA.33 Standard regres-
sion analysis can produce biased standard errors if
heteroscedasticity is present.34 If heteroscedasticity was
present, we used robust standard errors, using the vce(ro-
bust) option in STATA, which relaxes the assumption that
errors are both independent and identically distributed and
are therefore more robust.
For the TDI analyses, we also repeated the analysis ad-
justing for other measures of the environment previously
associated with interactions, including self-reported phys-
ical activity, TV watching and diet7,9,10,35 and corrected
for interaction terms with other environmental measures.
Finally, we investigated each of the 69 SNPs individu-
ally. Interactions between each SNP and the TDI on
BMI were tested by including the respective interaction
terms in the models [e.g. interaction term ¼ SNP � TDI
(continuous)].
Identical analyses were performed in the CoLaus Study
and the 1958 Birth Cohort.
Testing for potential reverse causality
Genetic variants could influence BMI through primary ef-
fects on physical activity or diet-related variables, espe-
cially when BMI is measured at the same time as the
exposure. For example, alleles that reduce activity could
increase BMI and result in estimates of self-reported activ-
ity biased towards higher activity. This direction of causal-
ity could result in alleles associated with higher BMI being
associated with stronger effects on BMI in people reporting
more activity. To attempt to test for this possibility, we
looked for evidence that BMI-associated variants had pri-
mary effects on levels of activity and measures of diet.
None of the BMI-associated variants had effects on activity
that were disproportionately larger than their BMI effects
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure 2,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). The BMI
GRS was associated with some of the obesogenic measures
of the environment (3 of 12 below the threshold of 0.004;
Supplementary Table 5, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).
Results
Measures of the obesogenic environment and
behaviour are associated with BMI and variance
in BMI in the UK Biobank study
We used 12 measures of the obesogenic environment and
behaviour that were associated with BMI in the UK
Biobank in the expected directions (Table 1). All self-
reported measures were associated with sex, measures of
socio-economic status and type 2 diabetes in the expected
directions, suggesting that over-reporting of healthy and
underreporting of unhealthy behaviour had not completely
biased
the
associations
with
self-reported
measures
(Supplementary Table 3, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online). In each case, the group of people in the
higher-risk environment had a larger mean BMI but also a
larger variation in BMI, as measured by the standard devi-
ation, compared with people in the lower risk environment
(Table
1
and
Supplementary
Figure
3,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). For example, the 50%
least (self-reporting) physically active people (n ¼ 54 569)
had an average BMI of 27.9 kg/m2, and 95% had a BMI
between 21.3 and 37.3 kg/m2 (a range of 16) whereas the
50% most physically active people (n ¼ 54 573) had an
average BMI of 26.9 kg/m2, and 95% had a BMI between
21.9 and 34.7 kg/m2 (a range of 12.8).
Genetic variants are associated with BMI in the
UK Biobank study
The BMI GRS, consisting of 69 known BMI-associated
variants, was associated with higher BMI and explained
1.5% of the variation in BMI—a figure consistent with
previous studies.5
Measures of high-risk obesogenic environments
and behaviours are associated with an
accentuated risk of high BMI in genetically
susceptible individuals
We observed interactions between measures of the obeso-
genic environment and genetic susceptibility to high BMI
in the following scenarios (Table 2, Figures 1 and 2, and
Supplementary Figure 4, available as Supplementary data
at IJE online).

 TDI
A higher level of deprivation was associated with an accentu-
ated genetic susceptibility to higher BMI. The effect of the
BMI GRS on BMI was larger in the group of 50% living in
the most relatively deprived situations {0.025 standard devi-
ations per allele [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.023–0.027]}
compared with the group of 50% living in the least deprived
situations [0.022 SDs per allele (95% CI: 0.020–0.024)]
(Table 2 and Figure 2a). When performing the analysis with
TDI on a continuous scale (a more robust analysis than using
dichotomized
measures),
the
interaction
was
strong:
Pinteraction 2� 10–10. This apparent gene x deprivation inter-
action meant that, compared with below-average deprivation
(in the UK Biobank), above-average deprivation was associ-
ated with a 0.92kg/m2 higher BMI in people with the highest
genetic risk (top decile) but a 0.35kg/m2 higher BMI in
people at least genetic risk (bottom decile) (Table 2 and
Figure 2a). Another way of expressing the interaction is that,
within the 50% group living in the most deprived situations,
carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles (weighted by effect
size) was associated with 3.8kg extra weight in someone
1.73m tall. In contrast, within the 50% group living in the
least deprived situations, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising
alleles was associated with 2.9kg extra weight in someone
1.73m tall. These differences were even stronger when using
a cut-off that reflected the UK population average TDI36
(Supplementary Table 6, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online) and were consistent across different age groups
(Supplementary Table 7, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). We also noted that the interaction effect was not
driven by specific BMI-associated variants, but was a feature
of general genetic susceptibility to higher BMI, as measured
by the 69 SNP BMI risk score (Supplementary Table 8 and
Supplementary Figure 5, available as Supplementary data at

 IJE online). Excluding the FTO variant did not alter the evi-
dence of interaction.
In
the
CoLaus
Study
of
5237
individuals
from
Switzerland, we did not observe any TDI–BMI GRS
interaction, but the effect estimates overlap those in
the UK Biobank (Supplementary Table 9, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Lower occupational job class and less time spent in
education were not associated with an accentuated
genetic susceptibility to higher BMI
To further explore possible reasons for the TDI inter-
action, we tested job class and time spent in education. In
both the UK Biobank and the 1958 Birth Cohort, people
with lower job classes had a higher mean and standard de-
viation for BMI. However, there, we found no interaction
between job class and GRS in determining BMI in either
study (Supplementary Table 9, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). Using the UK Biobank data, there was
no interaction between time in education and GRS in
influencing BMI (Supplementary Table 9, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Self-reported physical activity
The effect of the BMI GRS on BMI was larger in the 50%
of people reporting less physical activity [0.025 standard
deviations per allele (0.023–0.027)] compared with the
50% reporting more physical activity [0.022 (0.020–
0.024)] (Pinteraction 5 � 10–6; IPAQ on a continuous scale)
(Table 2 and Figure 2b).
In a subsample (n ¼ 19 229) of people we used an ob-
jective, accelerometer-based measure of physical activity
recorded over 6 d. We noted a similar trend with a larger
effect of the BMI GRS on BMI in less physically active peo-
ple [0.026 standard deviations per allele (0.022–0.029)]
compared with those doing more physical activity [0.023
(0.019–0.027)], although the evidence of interaction was
weak (Pinteraction 0.11; Table 2).

 TV watching
The effect of the BMI GRS on BMI was larger in people
watching 4 or more hours of TV per day [0.026 standard
deviations per allele (0.024–0.028)] compared with those
watching 3 h or less [0.022 (0.021–0.024)] (Pinteraction
7 � 10–5; using TV watching on a continuous scale)
(Table 2 and Figure 2c).
Other self-reported measures of the obesogenic
environment
We did not find any gene x obesogenic environment inter-
action when considering sedentary time, vigorous activity,
Westernized diet, percentage protein or fat in diet, fried-
food or fizzy-drink consumption at Bonferroni-adjusted
thresholds (P < 0.004; Table 2). In six of these seven

not possible to use a continuous measure in the calculation of the interaction term. This figure is based on a similar way of showing interaction data
with a BMI GRS from 12. SEP, socioeconomic position.

 measures (exception percentage fat consumption), the
trend was towards the high-risk obesogenic environments
accentuating the risk of high BMI in genetically susceptible
individuals.
A composite measure of the obesogenic environment
We next tested a composite score consisting of four self-
report variables available in the majority of people: seden-
tary
time,
TV
watching,
physical
inactivity
and
Westernized diet. The 50% of people with a high compos-
ite score were on average 2.2 kg/m2 BMI units heavier than
the 50% with a low composite score. The effect of the BMI
GRS on BMI was larger in people with a high composite
score [0.025 standard deviations per allele (0.023, 0.027)]
compared with those with a low composite score [0.022
(0.021–0.024)] (Pinteraction 2 � 10–4; composite score on a
continuous scale) (Table 2 and Figure 2d).
The gene x environment interactions may not be specific to
the environments tested: using negative controls
We next hypothesized that the interactions observed may
not be specific to the obesogenic environment tested, but a
general feature of selecting groups of individuals of higher
BMI and comparing them to groups of individuals of lower
BMI. For example, previous studies have observed stronger
effects of BMI-raising alleles in groups of individuals who
are less active, eating more fried food and consuming more
sugary drinks.6,9,35 However, all these groups were more
overweight on average than those with the healthier life-
styles and environments, and any interaction observed may
have been a feature of higher BMI and the general environ-
ment, not the specific environment tested. We therefore
performed three additional, negative control analyses to
test the specificity of the interactions observed. These tests
represented ‘impossible by the proposed mechanism’ nega-
tive controls.37,38 These analyses also help to test whether
or not statistical artefacts were influencing our results,
such as different variances in BMI.
Sun-protection use as a negative control
First, we tested sun-protection use as a negative control
that has no plausible role in obesity but is associated with
deprivation, the measure with the strongest evidence of
interaction. Using less sun protection in the summer was
associated with higher deprivation and there was an inter-
action with genetic susceptibility to higher BMI, before
(Pinteraction 1 � 10–4) and after adjustment for TDI (Table 2
and Figure 2e).
Individuals randomly selected to be of different BMIs
Second, we sampled individuals so that they had identical
BMI distributions (means and standard deviations) to the
high and low TDI groups, but were otherwise randomized
to all other variables. We then tested for evidence of inter-
action using these randomly selected groups. These ana-
lyses were repeated 100 times. The associations between
the BMI GRS and BMI in these randomly selected individ-
uals were similar to those observed when we selected based
on Townsend deprivation index, but none of the 100 iter-
ations showed an interaction P-value lower than the real
TDI interaction (median P ¼ 9 � 10–4; Table 3, Figure 2f
and Figure 3a). We repeated this analysis by selecting indi-
viduals to have similar BMI distributions to those in the
high- and low-physical-activity, TV-watching, fizzy-drink-
consumption or the high- and low-composite-score groups
but who were otherwise randomized to all other variables.
We saw some interaction with the BMI GRS having larger
effects on BMI in the fatter group compared with thinner
group (median of 100 permutations P ¼ 0.003, P ¼ 0.047
and P ¼ 0.028 for those selected to have similar BMIs to
the physical activity (IPAQ), TV-watching and composite-
score groups, respectively) (Table 3 and Supplementary
Figure 6, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
No interaction was found for groups based on the high-
and low-fizzy-drink groups (a real variable with no evi-
dence of interaction) (Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 6,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). We note
that these analyses are not completely representative of
the real analyses because the interaction term is a binary
variable (presence or absence of the individual in the
randomly selected groups of higher and lower BMI), not
continuous.
A dummy environment
Third, we generated a dummy continuous environment
associated with BMI but not TDI, physical activity or any
of the other measures of the obesogenic environment. We
forced this variable to have a similar correlation to BMI as
the observed real TDI, physical-activity, TV-watching, the
composite-score and the fizzy-drink variables, but that was
only very minimally associated with those real measures of
the environment (see the ‘Methods’ section). We then
tested the hypothesis that the BMI GRS would have stron-
ger effects on BMI in the individuals ‘exposed’ to high lev-
els of this dummy obesogenic environment. We observed
some interaction, with the BMI GRS having stronger ef-
fects on BMI in the fatter groups (P ¼ 0.10, P ¼ 0.025,
P ¼ 0.08 and P ¼ 0.003 for the dummy environments cor-
related with BMI to the same extent as TDI, physical activ-
ity, TV watching and the composite score, respectively,
based on the median of 10 000 dummy environments
tested) (Figure 2g, Figure 3b, Table 3 and Supplementary
Figure 7, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
No interaction was observed for the dummy environment

 correlated with BMI to the same extent as fizzy drinks
(Table
3
and
Supplementary
Figure
7,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). However, the evidence
of interaction with these dummy environments tended to
be weaker than that for the real variables. For example,
in the 10 000 permutations of a dummy environment,
we
never
observed
interactions
as
strong
as
that
observed with real TDI, providing evidence at P < 0.0001
that the TDI effect was capturing a genuine interaction
(Figure 3b).

 Sensitivity analyses
We next performed several sensitivity analyses to further
test the interaction of TDI, TV-hours, physical activity and
a composite measure of the obesogenic environment with
the BMI GRS. We explored a potential source of error—
the correlation between the risk factors and the outcomes.
In this study, risk factors in the interaction model—
measures of the obesogenic environment—were associated
with the outcome—BMI. In theory, this problem could
have created false positive interactions but a number of
sensitivity analyses suggested that this was not the case
(Supplementary information and Supplementary Table 10,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). We showed
that the interactions for each of the four measures (IPAQ,
TDI, TV watching and the composite score) were similar
when correcting for smoking and the other three measures.
We also showed that the interaction with TDI remained
strong when correcting for the interaction terms of the
other three variables. In contrast, the interaction was atte-
nuated for IPAQ, TV watching and the composite score
when including the TDI interaction term (Supplementary
Table 11, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Inflated interactions when analysing BMI on the
kg/m2 scale
When analysed on the natural BMI scale (kg/m2), the evi-
dence of interaction was stronger than when using an in-
verse normalized scale, but likely partly artefactual. The
BMI GRS was associated with even larger effects on BMI
in high-risk obesogenic environments compared with low-
risk environments, and there were apparent interactions
(at P < 0.05) in seven of the 12 tests (Supplementary Table
12
and
Supplementary
Figure
8,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). This potential artefact
occurs because the variance in BMI was higher in individ-
uals in the high-risk environment groups and this hetero-
scedasticity inflates effect estimates (Supplementary Figure
9, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
In the UK Biobank, we found that aspects of the obesogenic
environment accentuate genetic susceptibility to higher BMI.
The corollary of this finding, if true, is that exposure to low-
risk obesogenic environments partially attenuates the effects
of genetic susceptibility to obesity. Of the factors we tested,
relatively low socio-economic position, as measured by the
TDI, best captured the relevant environmental factors. Our
results provide some evidence for public health campaigns
aimed at reducing obesity but suggest that measures that tar-
get more deprived individuals may have proportionally higher
impact. We were not testing for specific gene variant–
environment interactions, but instead asking a question of
public health relevance—are people at higher risk of obesity
due to their genetics more susceptible to the obesogenic envir-
onment? We used a BMI GRS as a measure of genetic suscep-
tibility, and the data suggested that no individual variants
contributed disproportionately to the evidence of interaction.
The relevant components of higher levels of deprivation
that accentuate the genetic risk of obesity are uncertain.
When adjusting for measures of self-report physical activ-
ity, a more calorie-dense ‘Westernized’ diet and sedentary
activity, the evidence of interaction remained strong. This
observation, and the interaction with a composite score,
suggests that no one aspect of the obesogenic environment
we tested can explain the interaction effect with TDI, al-
though a caveat to this argument is that these other meas-
ures were self-reported. This conclusion contrasts with
Figure 3. Histograms showing the -log10(P-values) for the interactions from (a) the 100 iterations of the individuals selected to be of different BMIs at
random and (b) the 10 000 iterations of a simulated environment with a similar association to BMI as TDI. The dashed line represents the median
value and the solid line represents the P-value obtained from the real interactions with TDI.

 those from some previous studies that have suggested (in
separate papers) that fried-food and sugary-drink con-
sumption and TV watching specifically interact with BMI
genetics.7–10,35
The
evidence
of
interaction
remained
strong when adjusting for urban vs rural dwelling—an ob-
jective measure associated with obesity in the UK Biobank
and previously proposed as a contributory factor to the
obesogenic environment (through reduced exposure to
open spaces, e.g. 39).
Our results are consistent with data from twins, where
the genetic component to obesity is stronger in young UK
children exposed to the modern environment (twins born
in the 1990s and measured at the age of 9), compared with
measures from twin studies in earlier generations3 and that
the genetic and environmental components to common
traits varies by UK region.40
The use of negative controls provided two additional
pieces of evidence about the nature of the gene x obeso-
genic environment interactions. First, when compared with
the real data, the evidence of interaction was weaker when
using a simulated environment or randomly selecting
groups to be of different BMIs. For example, for TDI, we
never observed the actual interaction in 10 000 simulations
of a dummy environment or 100 iterations of selecting
groups of different BMIs. These control experiments mim-
icked almost perfectly the observed differences in BMI, but
still the evidence of interaction was weaker than when
using the real obesogenic environments. These results sug-
gest that something about the real obesogenic environ-
ment, captured by TDI, accentuates genetic risk of obesity.
Second, the use of a control measure implausibly linked
to obesity, sun-protection use, helped us establish the pos-
sibility that residual confounding has affected the results.
The importance of using negative controls in epidemiology
to control for this residual confounding has been dis-
cussed37,38 and is closely related to the use of one of Hill’s
original criteria for causal inference in epidemiology—that
of specificity of the exposure–outcome association.41 The
fact that this negative control showed evidence of inter-
action, even after adjustment for TDI, suggests that either
it is a bad negative control or it is correlated with other
obesogenic factors not captured by TDI—residual con-
founding. We believe that sun-protection use is a good
negative control: low vitamin D levels (which would be
caused by high use of sun protection) are associated with
higher BMI, but there is genetic evidence that this is not a
causal relationship42 and, even if it were, would have re-
sulted in evidence of interaction in the opposite direction
to our observation.
The observation of some evidence of interaction in all
our negative control experiments indicates that genetic
variants altering BMI may have larger effects in any group
of individuals of higher BMI compared with those with
lower BMI. Our results show that the greater the mean and
variance of BMI, the greater the apparent effects of genetic
variants. These effects may be driven by statistical artefacts
that can affect gene x environment interaction studies, and
we note that the evidence is sensitive to the scale on which
the non-genetic factors are analysed. Further work, includ-
ing the use of negative controls that are likely associated
with unmeasured confounders but are implausible, will
help disentangle which aspects of the environment are
causally interacting with BMI genetics to accentuate the
risk of high BMI.
Our analysis had a number of strengths. The major
strength was the availability of a single large study, which
was beneficial for two main reasons. First, it provided us
with relatively homogenous measures of the environment.
Several previous studies were limited to meta-analyses of
summary statistics from many studies with heterogeneous
measures of the environment.6,8–10 An exception is a recent
study that also used the UK Biobank and individual-level
data to jointly model multiple exposures and provide evi-
dence that some measures that we did not test, including
frequency of alcohol consumption and adding salt to food,
remain interacting when adjusting for TDI.17 Second, it
allowed us to test the robustness and specificity of our re-
sults by using a composite measure of the environment,
randomly selecting individuals and testing interactions
using a dummy, simulated environment. A third advantage
is that we used an objective measure of the environment:
TDI, which provides a cleaner interpretation of results
compared with those from previous studies that have had
to rely on subjective measures such as self-reported diet
and physical activity. These subjective measures are often
complex mixtures of environment and behaviour and may
be subject to reporting biases. The fourth advantage of our
study is that we used a negative control variable—sun-pro-
tection use—which helps control for residual confounding.
Finally, we performed extensive analyses to account for
potential statistical artefacts that can plague gene x envir-
onment interaction studies. For example, we have ac-
counted for the effects of heteroscedasticity—a statistical
term that describes unequal variance in data. Groups of
overweight individuals have a wider variance in BMI than
groups of thinner individuals and these differences in BMI
can create false positive evidence of interaction. Previous
studies have not necessarily accounted for these ‘scale’ ef-
fects and are likely to have overestimated the effects of any
interactions.
The major limitation of our study, as with most previ-
ous studies, is that the majority of the obesogenic variables
were based on self-reported measures, and that these self-
reports were made at the same time as BMI was measured.

 A more objective measure of physical activity demon-
strated similar results to the self-reported physical activity,
but accelerometer-based measures of activity were only
available in one-fifth of the dataset. Other limitations of
our study include (i) the possibility of reverse causality—
genetic variants that predispose to higher BMI may in turn
lead to a stronger association with BMI if they make peo-
ple less active (Supplementary Table 9, available as
Supplementary data at IJE online); (ii) subtle effects—from
Figure 3, we can see that the correlation between BMI gen-
etics and BMI is only slightly larger in the high-risk com-
pared with low-risk environment groups. However, the
differences are still such that carrying an additional 10
BMI-raising alleles can increase weight by up to 3.6 kg in a
high-risk environment compared with 2.8 kg in a low-risk
environment (for a person of average height); (iii) the use
of cross-sectional data, with self-reported measures of the
obesogenic environment made at the same time as BMI
was measured—bias may be introduced by individuals
with higher BMIs trying to lose weight through diet and
exercise; (iv) missing data—not all participants responded
to diet and physical activity questions which may introduce
further bias into the study; individuals not reporting were
more likely to be older, female and with higher BMI; and
(v) the measures of the obesogenic environment were cor-
related with each other and therefore the tests were not in-
dependent. For example, TV watching and sedentary time
were the most correlated measures (r ¼ 0.64). We also can-
not rule out collider bias43 affecting the results because in-
dividuals participating in the UK Biobank study are biased
towards those from higher socio-economic positions and
with lower BMIs.
Our results provide an advance for gene x environment
interaction studies. We highlight many of the statistical
and methodological issues that can make interpretation of
GxE results very difficult. One aspect that we can be very
confident about, and that contrasts with the conclusions
from previous studies, is that there is no evidence that one
particular aspect of the environment or behaviour, if
altered, would have a preferential benefit over others. It is
premature to use genetic interaction studies to suggest that
public health measures should be targeted specifically at
fried-food reduction, fizzy-drink consumption or diet in
those genetically predisposed to obesity.8,9 However, our
data suggest that something about the obesogenic environ-
ment accentuates the genetic susceptibility to obesity and
that, of the factors we tested, socio-economic position best
captures the relevant factors.
