Abstract
Altered infant human gut microbiome composition and metabolic activity are implicated in 
childhood atopy and asthma1. We hypothesized that compositionally distinct neonatal human gut 
microbiota exist and are differentially related to relative–risk (RR) of childhood atopy and asthma. 
Using stool samples (n = 298; aged 1–11 months) from a US birth cohort and 16S rRNA 
sequencing, neonates (median age 35 days) were divisible into three microbiota–composition 
states (NGM1–3). Each incurred significantly different RR for multi–sensitized atopy at age–two 
years and doctor–diagnosed asthma at age–four years. The highest risk group, NGM3, showed 
lower relative abundance of certain bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and 
Faecalibacterium), higher relative abundance of particular fungi (Candida and Rhodotorula), and a 
distinct fecal metabolome enriched for pro-inflammatory metabolites. Ex vivo culture of adult

 human peripheral T–cells with sterile fecal water from NGM3 subjects increased the proportion of 
CD4+ cells producing interleukin–4 and reduced the relative abundance of Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ 
cells. 12,13 DiHOME which discriminated NGM3 from lower–risk NGMs, recapitulated the effect 
of NGM3 fecal water on Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ cell relative abundance. These findings suggest that 
neonatal gut microbiome dysbiosis drives CD4+ T–cell dysfunction associated with childhood 
atopy.
Atopy, the propensity to produce IgE antibodies in response to allergens, is one of the most 
common chronic health issues2, considered a significant risk factor for childhood asthma 
development3 and has recently been linked to bacterial taxonomic depletions in the gut 
microbiota at 3, but not 12 months of age1. We therefore hypothesized that distinct neonatal 
(~1 month of age) gut microbiota exist and idiosyncratically influence CD4+ populations in 
a manner that differentially relates to RR of childhood atopy and asthma. Independent fecal 
samples collected during a study visit targeting 1–month of age (median age 35 days; range 
16–138 days; n = 130; “neonates”), or 6–months of age (median age 201 days; range 170–
322 days; n = 168; “infants”) from participants in the racially and socio–economically 
diverse Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study birth–
cohort4 were studied. Atopic status at age–two years was defined using latent–class analysis, 
an unsupervised statistical algorithm that clusters subjects based on their pattern of serum 
IgE responses to a panel of ten food and aeroallergens5 (Supplementary Table 1; 
Supplementary Fig. 1).
At the population level (independent of atopy status) bacterial community α–diversity 
(taxon number and distribution) expanded with increasing age (Pearson’s correlation r = 
0.47, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 2a). In parallel fungal α–diversity contracted 
(Pearson’s correlation, r = −0.23, P = 0.0014; Supplementary Fig. 2b), and a reciprocal 
relationship between these microbial kingdoms existed (Shannon’s Index; Pearson’s 
correlation r = −0.24, P < 0.001; Fig. 1a). Both bacterial and fungal β–diversity (inter–
personal taxonomic composition), were related to participant age (PERMANOVA; R2 = 
0.056, P < 0.001 and R2 = 0.034, P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 1b–c). Neonatal fecal 
microbiota were typically dominated by Bifidobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 1d), 
Malasseziales (Malassezia) and Saccharomycetales (Saccharomyces; Fig. 1e). Infant 
participants exhibited sustained presence, though diminished relative abundance of 
Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, an expansion of Lachnospiraceae (Blautia and 
Ruminococcus) and fungal communities characteristically dominated by Saccharomycetales 
(Saccharomyces and Candida; Fig. 1e), the dominant fungal order in healthy adults6. These 
findings indicate an inter–kingdom gut microbial co–evolution along an age–associated 
developmental gradient, over the first year of life.
To address our primary hypothesis a Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model was used 
to group participants based on bacterial community composition7; three distinct neonatal gut 
microbiota–states (NGM1, 2 and 3) represented the best model fit (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
PERMANOVA confirmed that NGM designation explained a small but non–trivial 
proportion of bacterial β–diversity (PERMANOVA; R2 = 0.09, P < 0.001; Fig. 2a), 
indicating that these compositional states (which did not differ in age [Kruskal–Wallis; P =

 0.256; Fig. 2b]) may represent a gradient of neonatal gut microbiota compositions. NGMs 
trended towards a significant relationship with fungal β–diversity (Bray Curtis; 
PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.037, P = 0.068), signifying that each co–associates with a mycobiota 
that primarily varies in the relative abundance of the dominant fungal taxa present. Infant 
samples were divisible into two compositionally distinct gut microbiota–states, IGM1 
(Bifidobacteriaceae–dominated) and IGM2 (Lachnospiraceae–dominated (unweighted 
UniFrac; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.032, P = 0.001), which did differ in age (Wilcoxon rank 
sum, P = 0.0257); IGM1 participants were younger. IGMs were not related to fungal 
community β–diversity (Bray–Curtis; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.011, P = 0.33), presumably 
because infant subjects were consistently enriched for Saccharomycetales. Using the 
conventional atopy definition (IgE > 0.35 IU ml−1), no significant difference in RR between 
NGMs was observed (Table 1). However when the asthma predictive5 PM–atopy definition 
was used, NGM3 participants incurred a higher RR of atopy at age two-years compared with 
either NGM1 (RR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.42–6.09 P = 0.004; Table 1) or NGM2 groups (RR = 
2.06; 95% CI 1.01–4.19 P = 0.048; Table 1). Even larger effect sizes for NGM3 were 
observed for parental reported doctor–diagnosed asthma at age–four years (Table 1). NGM–
associated RR of PM–atopy was supported by the sum of specific IgE responses at age–two 
years (Fig. 2c). As hypothesized, IGMs did not exhibit different RR for PM–atopy (RR = 
1.02; 95% CI 0.59–1.75, P = 0.94; Supplementary Table 2) or asthma (RR = 0.51; 95% CI 
0.22–1.17 P = 0.11). Using available early–life characteristics, we identified maternal 
education, season of birth, gestational age, age at sample collection and breastfeeding to be 
significantly distinct across IGMs (Supplementary Table 3). Only detectable dog allergen 
(Can f 1) concentrations in the home during the neonatal study visit (lowest in the NGM3 
group), and baby gender (NGM3 was almost entirely male) were significantly associated 
with NGM state (Supplementary Table 4). Despite adjustment for these and other early–life 
factors commonly related to allergic disease, the relationship between NGM and atopy or 
asthma remained (Supplementary Table 5). Only one other large pediatric gut microbiota–
atopy study exists1, the youngest participants of which were substantially older (~100 days) 
than neonates in our cohort (median age 35 days). Application of our DMM model 
parameters to this dataset identified two compositionally distinct groups (Bifidobacteria-
dominated NGM1 and Lachnospiraceae-dominated IGM2 [Supplementary information]), 
indicating that neonatal examination of gut microbiota is necessary to identify distinct 
pioneer microbiota related to differential RR.
NGM3 microbiota were characteristically depleted of bacterial taxa including Bifidobacteria 
(Bifidobacteriaceae), Lactobacillus (Lactobacillaceae), Faecalibacterium (Clostridiaceae) 
and Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobiaceae) when compared with NGM1 (zero–inflated 
negative binomial regression (ZINB), Benjamini–Hochberg q < 0.05; Fig. 2d; 
Supplementary Table 6). These observations were consistent when NGM3 was compared to 
NGM2 (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 7) and with previously described 
atopy–associated taxonomic depletions1. Mycologically, NGM3 subjects were consistently 
depleted of multiple Malassezia taxa (Fig. 2e; ZINB; Benjamini–Hochberg q < 0.05; 
Supplementary Tables 8–9), striking given our population–based observation that this genus 
is characteristically enriched in the neonatal gut microbiota. Fungal taxonomic enrichments 
in the NGM3 group were also consistent when compared to either of the lower–risk groups,

 and included members of the Saccharomycetales, Rhodotorula, Pleosporales and Candida 
(Supplementary Table 8–9). Hence neonatal inter–kingdom microbiota dysbiosis is 
characteristic of PM–atopy and asthma development in childhood.
NGM3 microbiota were predicted8 to lack an extensive range of bacterial amino acid, lipid 
and xenobiotic metabolism pathways (Supplementary Fig. 5). Un–targeted liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry identified fecal metabolites present in a subset (n = 28) 
of the representative subjects from each NGM (those with the highest posterior probability 
of NGM membership). A significant relationship existed between 16S rRNA profile, 
predicted metagenome and the metabolome of the NGMs (Procrustes; Supplementary Table 
10), indicating a deterministic relationship between community composition and the 
metabolic microenvironment of the neonatal gut. Between–group comparisons identified 
specific metabolites enriched in each NGM (Welch’s t–test; P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 6, 
Supplementary Table 11–12). As previously reported in the urine of atopic subjects1, NGM3 
participants exhibited fecal enrichment of primary and secondary bile metabolites. However 
more expansive metabolic dysfunction involving lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, peptide, 
xenobiotic, nucleotide, vitamin and energy metabolism pathways, essentially those bacterial 
pathways predicted to be deficient in NGM3, was evident. Though NGM1 and NGM2 
exhibited distinct metabolic programs, a common subset of metabolites differentiated them 
from NGM3. These included anti–inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
docosapentaenoate (n3 DPA; 22 n5) and dihomo–γ–linolenate9,10 (DGLA; 20:3n3 or n6), 
succinate, and the breast–milk oligosaccharides, 3–fucosyllactose and lacto–N–fucopentaose 
II known to influence gut epithelial colonization11,12 (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary 
Table 11–12). In contrast, NGM3 participants were consistently enriched for 12,13 
DiHOME, stigma– and sito–sterols, 8–hydroxyoctanoate, α–CEHC and γ–tocopherol.
Compared with NGM1, sterile fecal water from NGM3 participants decreased the ratio of 
CD4+IFNγ+:CD4+IL–4+ cells (LME, P = 0.095; Supplementary Fig. 7), increased the 
proportion of CD4+IL–4+ cells (LME, P < 0.001; Fig. 3a), the concentration of IL–4 
released (LME, P = 0.045; Fig. 3b) and reduced the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells 
(compared to control; Fig. 3c) ex vivo, indicating that the NGM3 gut microenvironment 
promotes adaptive immune dysfunction associated with established atopic asthma. Weighted 
correlation network analysis identified 32 metabolic modules (Supplementary Fig. 8), one of 
which discriminated the NGMs (ANOVA; P = 0.038; Fig. 3d) and contained 12,13 
DiHOME, which was identified both as a hub metabolite (MM = 0.91; Fig. 3e) and 
relatively enriched in NGM3 subjects compared with the other two NGMs (P < 0.05; 
Supplementary Fig. 6 and 9, Supplementary Table 11–12). All concentrations of 12,13 
DiHOME examined reduced the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells compared to 
vehicle–treatment (LME, P = 0.04, P < 0.001, P = 0.001 respectively; Fig 3f).
Thus these findings indicate that the neonatal gut microbiota influences susceptibility to 
childhood allergic asthma, via alterations in the gut microenvironment that influence CD4+ 
T–cell populations and function. These data suggest that very-early life interventions to 
manipulate the composition and function of the gut microbiome may offer a viable strategy 
for disease prevention.

 Methods
Study population
Pregnant women (N = 1,258) between the ages of 21–49 were recruited from August 2003–
November 2007 as part of the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma 
Longitudinal Study (WHEALS). WHEALS is a prospective birth cohort from southeastern 
Michigan designed to investigate early life risk factors for allergic diseases as previously 
described4. Briefly, women were considered eligible if they lived in a predefined cluster of 
contiguous zip codes in, and surrounding Detroit, MI, had no intention of moving out of the 
area and provided informed written consent. Five follow–up contacts were conducted at 1, 6, 
12, 24, and 48–months after the birth of their child, with the 24–month appointment being at 
a standardized study clinic for the child to be evaluated by a board–certified allergist. Stool 
samples were collected from the child at the 1– and 6–month home visits. All aspects of this 
research were approved by the Henry Ford Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Sub–sample criteria of WHEALS subjects for stool microbiome analyses
Children who had completed their 24–month clinic visit, which included a blood draw for 
IgE measurements and had dust samples collected from their homes at the same time as their 
stool sample collection were selected for this study (n = 308). Stool samples from children 
ranging from 1–11 months were collected from field staff during home visits and stored at 
−80 °C. Samples were randomized prior to being shipped to UCSF on dry ice where they 
were also stored at −80 °C until processed.
PM–atopy and asthma definition
Blood drawn at the 2–year clinic visit was used to determine levels of total and 10 allergen–
specific IgEs (sIgE): Alternaria (Alternaria alternata), German cockroach (Blattella 
germanica Bla g 2), dog (Canis lupus familiaris Can f 1), house dust mites 
(Dermatophagoides farinae Der f 1), hen’s egg (egg), cat (Felis domesticus Fel d 1), cow’s 
milk (milk), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), and 
Timothy grass (Phleum pratense). Specific IgEs were measured using the Pharmacia 
UniCAP system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Latent class analysis was 
used to group participants into four discrete atopic–classes based on sensitization patterns of 
the 10 allergen sIgEs as with the entire WHEALS cohort3. Our subset was assigned to one 
of four latent classes: 1. Low–no sensitization (n = 226); 2. Highly sensitized (both food and 
inhalant allergens; n = 9); 3. Milk and egg dominated (n = 50), or 4. Peanut and inhalant(s) 
dominated (n = 13) sensitization. Due to sample size, latent classes 2–4 were collapsed and 
considered “predominately multi–sensitized” (PM–atopy; n = 72), remaining subjects 
represented the “low–no sensitization” group. The conventional definition of atopy (least 
one positive test (sIgE ≥ 0.35 IU ml−1) to any of the 10 allergens) was also used for 
comparative purposes. Children were defined as asthmatic using parental reported doctor 
diagnosis of asthma at the 4–year interview.

 Bacterial and fungal community profiling, PICRUSt and metabolomic analyses
DNA Extraction—Stool samples from 308 infants were extracted using a modified 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer based protocol13. Briefly, 0.5 ml of 
modified CTAB extraction buffer were added to 25 mg of stool in a 2 ml Lysing Matrix E 
tube (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) then incubated (65 °C, 15 min). Samples were 
bead–beaten (5.5 m s−1, 30 sec) in a Fastprep–24 (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) 
followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). 
Following centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was added to a heavy phase–
lock gel tube (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) and chloroform (v:v) was added. Samples were 
centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 5 min); resulting supernatants were added to fresh tubes, followed 
by addition of 1 μl of linear acrylamide prior to PEG–NaCl (2v:v). Samples were incubated 
(21 °C, 2 h), washed with 70% EtOH and resuspended in 10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.5.
Sequencing preparation—The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified as 
designed in Caporaso et al.14. PCR reactions were performed in 25 μl reactions using 0.025 
U Takara Hot Start ExTaq (Takara Mirus Bio Inc, Madison, WI), 1X Takara buffer with 
MgCl2, 0.4 pmol μl−1 of F515 and R806 primers, 0.56 mg ml−1 of bovine serum albumin 
(BSA; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 200 μM of dNTPs, and 10 ng of gDNA. 
Reactions were performed in triplicate with the following: initial denaturation (98 °C, 2 
min), 30 cycles of 98 °C (20 sec), annealing at 50 °C (30 sec), extension at 72 °C (45 sec) 
and final extension at 72 °C (10 min). Amplicons were pooled and verified using a 2% TBE 
agarose e—gel (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), prior to purification using AMPure 
SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), quality checked with the Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 
Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and the 
dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Samples were pooled and 
sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform as previously described15.
The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)2 of the rRNA gene was amplified using the 
primer pair fITS7 (5′–GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG–3′) and ITS4 (5′–
TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC–3′). Primers were designed for the Illumina MiSeq 
platform as described above. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate in 25 μl reaction 
with 1X Takara buffer (Takara Mirus Bio), 200 nM of each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 2.75 
mM of MgCl2, 0.56 mg ml−1 of BSA (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 0.025 U 
Takara Hot Start ExTaq and 50 ng of gDNA. Reactions were conducted under the following 
conditions: initial denaturation (94 °C, 5 min),30 cycles of 94 °C (30 sec), annealing at 
54 °C (30 sec), extension at 72 °C (30 sec) and a final extension at 72 °C (7 min). PCR 
verification and purification were performed as described above. Samples were quantified 
using KAPA SYBR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) qPCR following manufacturer’s 
protocol. Samples were pooled in equal moles (50 ng) and prepped and denatured libraries 
with PhiX spike–in control, as described above, were loaded onto the Illumina MiSeq 
cartridge.
Sequence data processing and quality control—For bacterial sequences, paired–end 
sequences were assembled using FLASH16 v 1.2.7, demultiplexed by barcode, and low 
quality reads (Q–score < 30) were discarded in QIIME17 1.8. If three consecutive bases were

 < Q30, then the read was truncated and the resulting read retained in the data set only if it 
was at least 75% of the original length. Sequences were checked for chimeras using 
UCHIME18 and filtered from the dataset prior to OTU picking at 97% sequence 
identification using UCLUST19 against the Greengenes database20 version 13_5. Those 
sequence reads that failed to cluster with a reference sequence were clustered de novo. 
Sequences were aligned using PyNAST21, and taxonomy assigned using the RDP classifier 
and Greengenes reference database version20 13_5. To de–noise the OTU table, taxa with 
less than 5 total sequences across all samples were removed. A bacterial phylogenetic tree 
was built using FastTree22 2.1.3.
Fungal sequences were quality trimmed (Q–score < 25) and adapter sequences removed 
using cutadapt23 prior to assembling paired–end reads with FLASH16. Sequences were de–
multiplexed by barcode and truncated to 150 bp prior to clustering using USEARCH vers. 7 
pipeline, specifically the UPARSE24 function, and chimera–checked using UCHIME. 
Taxonomy was assigned using UNITE25 vers. 6.
To normalize variation in read depth across samples, data were rarefied to the minimum read 
depth of 202,367 sequences per sample for bacteria (n = 298) and 30,590 for fungi (n = 
188). To ensure that a truly representative community was used for analysis for each sample, 
sequence sub–sampling at these defined depths was rarefied 100 times. The representative 
community composition for each sample was defined as that which exhibited the minimum 
average Euclidean distance to all other OTU vectors generated from all sub–samplings for 
that particular sample. Investigators at UCSF were blinded to sample identity until 
microbiota datasets underwent the aforementioned processing and were ready for statistical 
analyses.
Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)
PICRUSt8 was used to predict pathways of those taxa significantly enriched in each neonatal 
gut microbiota–state based on zero–inflated negative binomial regression and corrected for 
multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate26. These taxa were used 
to generate a new OTU table normalized in PICRUSt, and discriminatory pathways were 
illustrated in a heatmap constructed in R.
Metabolomic profiling
Stool samples (200 mg) from each of the three microbiota–states, 8 NGM3 subjects and 10 
from each of NGM1 and NGM2, were provided to Metabolon (Durham, NC) for Ultrahigh 
Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) and 
Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) using their standard protocol (http://
www.metabolon.com/). These samples were chosen based on their exhibiting the highest 
posterior probability of belonging to a given NGM group and possessing sufficient sample 
volume for UPLC–MS/MS analysis. Compounds were compared to Metabolon’s in–house 
library of purified standards, including more than 3,300 commercially available compounds.

 Ex vivo dendritic cell challenge and T–cell co–culture
Fecal samples (1 g ml−1) from five of ten NGM1 and seven of eight from NGM3 neonates 
that had undergone metabolically profiling were used (biological replicate). Samples were 
excluded due to lack of availability. Fecal samples were homogenized in w:v pre–warmed 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Samples were 
vortexed, incubated (37 °C, 10 min) and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 30 min). Supernatant was 
filter–sterilized through a 0.2 μm filter, prior to use in the DC–T–cell assay described below. 
PBS was used as the negative control. Treatment conditions used for the DiHOME 
experiment included: 75 μM, 130 μM, and 200 μM 12,13 DiHOME (Cayman Chemical, 
Ann Arbor, MI) solubilized in 0.4%, 0.15% and 0.05% DMSO respectively. Controls 
included PBS and DMSO at corresponding percentages used to dissolve the different 
concentrations of DiHOME. Treatment group size was determined based on preliminary 
assays that demonstrated the effect size for suppression of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ using 130 
μM of 12, 13 DiHOME was approximately seven, indicating that least two samples per 
group was required to achieve a power > 0.80.
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy, de–identified human donors (PBMCs; 
Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, CA) through the cell–sourcing program that 
ensures donor confidentiality. Donors signed an agreement acknowledging that their blood 
may be used for research. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll–Hypaque gradient 
centrifugation, washed twice with R10 media (RPMI 1640 with 10% heat–inactivated FBS 
[antigen activator] with 2 mM L–glutamine and 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin; Life 
Technologies) and incubated for 18 h. Dendritic cells were isolated from PBMCs using the 
EasySep™ Human Pan–DC Pre–Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, 
BC). DCs (0.5 × 106 cells ml−1) from two donors (biological replication) were treated in 3–
sets with either cell–free fecal water (treatment replicate; excluded if were < 50% of the T–
cells were alive) or DiHOME treatment and cultured in R10 media supplemented with 10 ng 
ml−1 GM–CSF and 20 ng ml−1 IL–4 at 37 °C27 for 3 d for the fecal water assay, and 5 d for 
the DiHOME experiment. Treatment replicates were also considered biological replicates 
because the donor cells are not clonal. For the fecal water experiment, the assay was 
repeated twice on one donor (technical replicates) and once on donor B due to insufficient 
cells.
The DC treatment media was freshly prepared and replaced every 48 h. After 3 d (or 5 d for 
DiHOME treatment) of DC challenge, DC maturation was stimulated using DC growth 
mediators (10 ng ml−1 tumor nuclear factor–α [TNF–α], 10 ng ml−1 IL–1b, 10 ng ml−1 IL–
6, and 1 mM prostaglandin E2 [PGE2]) which were added to the culture for 24 h prior to co–
culture with T–cells. In preparation for co–culture, DCs were washed in fresh R10 media, 
counted via flow cytometry and plated in TexMACs Medium (Miltenyi Biotec, San Diego, 
CA) at 0.5 × 106 live CD45+ cells per well.
Autologous T lymphocytes were purified from the PBMCs using a Naïve CD4 T–cell 
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Following purification, naïve autologous CD4+ T–cells were

ratio of 10:1 in the presence of soluble anti–CD28 and anti–CD49d (1 mg ml−1). T and DC

 assess cytokine production, the co–cultures were mixed with Phorbol Myristate Acetate–
Ionomycin (SIGSa, St. Louis, MO) and GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 16 h 
prior to flow cytometry. Cell–free media from the co–cultures were collected at 48 h and 5 d, 
prior to PMA–Gplug addition, to assess cytokine secretion. Cytokine secretion was 
evaluated by cytometric bead array following the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Biosciences).
For flow cytometry, single–cell suspensions were stained using a panel of antibodies 
including anti–CD3 (SP34–2), anti–CD4 (L200), anti–CD25 (M–A251), anti–IFNγ (B27; 
BD Biosciences); anti–CD8a (RPA–T8; BioLegend, San Diego, CA); anti–IL4 (7A3–3; 
Miltenyi Biotec); anti–IL–17A (64DEC17) and anti–FoxP3 (PCH101; Affymetrix 
eBioscience, Santa Clara, CA). Validation for each primary antibody is provided on the 
manufacturers’ websites. Dead cells were stained positive with LIVE–DEAD® Aqua Dead 
Cell Stain (Life Technologies). Permeabilization buffer (Affymetrix eBioscience) was used 
to permeabilize cell prior to staining for intracellular markers, IFNγ, IL–4, IL–17A, FoxP3. 
For flow analysis, live T–cells were gated as CD3+CD4+ cells. Among CD4+ T–cells 
subpopulations, Th1 were IFNγ+, Th2 were IL–4+, Th17 were IL–17A+, and T–regs were 
both CD25hi and FoxP3hi. Stained cells were assayed via flow cytometer on a BD LSR II 
(BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis
Shannon’s diversity was calculated using QIIME. Pearson’s correlation was used to test for 
a relationship between bacterial and fungal Shannon’s diversity. Distance matrices 
(unweighted UniFrac28 and Bray–Curtis) were calculated in QIIME to assess compositional 
dissimilarity between samples and visualized using PCoA plots constructed in Emperor29. 
Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed using 
Adonis in the R environment to determine factors that significantly explained variation in 
microbiota β–diversity.
To identify clusters of subjects based on bacterial taxon relative abundance, Dirichlet 
Multinomial Mixture (DMM) models were used, which implement an unsupervised 
Bayesian approach based on a Dirichlet prior7. The best–fitting DMM model was 
determined using the Laplace approximation to the negative log model evidence, testing up 
to 10 underlying microbiota–states. Each sample was assigned to a particular microbiota–
state based upon the maximum posterior probability of microbiota–state membership. 
Kruskal–Wallis was used to test if age differentiated the microbiota states. Relative risk 
ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using PROC 
GENMOD in SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). Unadjusted and adjusted RRs were calculated 
based on log–binomial regression using maximum likelihood estimation or robust Poisson 
regression when prevalence ratios were near one, or the log–binomial model did not 
converge. Two–tailed Welch’s t–test was used to test if sIgE concentrations (log–
transformed) were significantly different between the three NGMs.
To determine which OTUs were significantly different between NGMs, the zero–inflated 
negative binomial regression (pscl package) was used as a primary modeling strategy, 
appropriate for sequence count data; in cases where OTU distributions were not zero–
inflated and the model failed to converge, the standard negative binomial was used as a

 secondary modeling strategy. These were corrected for multiple testing using the minimum 
positive false discovery rate26. Results were natural log transformed for illustration on 
phylogenetic trees using iTOL30 v3.0. When examining the association between early life 
factor and different microbiota states, P values were calculated based on covariate 
distribution by ANOVA (numerical, normally distributed), Kruskal–Wallis (numerical, 
skewed), chi–square (categorical), or Fisher’s exact (sparse categorical). Log–binomial 
regression model was used to test for confounding factors when assessing the relative risk of 
microbiota states developing atopy or asthma (PROC GENMOD in SAS version 9.4). 
Fisher’s exact 2–tailed test was conducted to test if breastfeeding was practiced significantly 
more in any of the microbiota–states.
Metabolites exhibiting significant different concentrations (log–transformed) between 
lower–risk NGMs and NGM3 were identified using 2–tailed Welch’s t–test. Shared and 
distinct super– and sub–pathway products amongst NGMs were illustrated using Cytoscape, 
vers. 3.2.131. Co–occurrence networks of metabolites were constructed using weighted 
correlation network analysis (WGCNA) with the R package WGCNA to find modules of 
highly interconnected, mutually exclusive metabolites. Pearson correlations were used to 
determine inter–metabolite relationships, where modules are composed of positively 
correlated metabolites. To avoid spurious modules, the minimum module size was set to five. 
Module “eigenmetabolites” (referred to as eigengenes), were defined as the first principal 
component of a given module and considered as a representative measure of the joint 
metabolic profile of that module. Each eigenmetabolite was used to test (ANOVA) the 
association between its respective module and NGM, Module membership was used to 
determine the interconnectedness of each metabolite to its assigned module and to identify 
“hub” metabolites: this was defined as the correlation between each metabolite and the 
eigenmetabolite (strong positive values indicate high interconnectedness).
Procrustes was used to test for concurrence between communities described by 16S 
phylogeny, PICRUSt and metabolomics datasets.
To test for T–cell and cytokine differences, linear mixed–effects model was used (R package 
lmerTest) and adjusted for donors. Except where indicated, all analyses were conducted in 
the R statistical programming language.

 Fig. 2. Compositionally distinct, age-independent bacterial gut microbiota–states (NGMs) exist in 
neonates, exhibit significant differences in fungal taxonomy and are related to relative risk of 
atopy at age–2 years
(a) NGM designation significantly explains observed variation (n = 130; PERMANOVA 
with unweighted UniFrac R2 = 0.09; P < 0.001) in bacterial β–diversity. (b) NGM 
participants do not differ significantly in age (n = 130; Kruskal–Wallis; P = 0.256). Boxplots 
are defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles with the center line representing the median (50th 
percentile). Lines that extend from the box are defined as 1.5 times the interquartile range 
(IQR, 75th–25th percentile), plus or minus the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. (c) The 
sum of allergen–specific serum IgE concentrations measures at two–years of age (n = 130) is 
significantly higher in NGM3 versus NGM1 participants (Welch’s t–test; P = 0.034). 
Boxplots are constructed as defined in (b). (d) Taxonomic comparison of NGM3 with 
NGM1 subjects; taxa exhibiting significant difference (ZINB; Benjamini–Hochberg, q <

 Fig. 3. NGMs significantly differ in CD4+ cell differentiation
Dendritic cells and autologously purified naïve CD4+ cells from serum of two healthy adult 
donors (biological replicates), were incubated with sterile fecal water from NGM1 (n = 7; 
three biological replicates per sample) or NGM3 (n = 5; three biological replicates per 
sample) participants. NGM3 induced significantly increased (a) proportions of CD4+IL–4+ 
(LME, P < 0.001; center line represents mean) and (b) expression of IL–4 (LME; P = 
0.045). (c) Both NGMs expressed significantly increased proportions of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ 
cells (LME; P < 0.001 for NGM1 and P = 0.017 for NGM3) compared to control. (d) 
Weighted correlation network analysis identified a metabolic module that differentiated 
NGM3 from NGM 2 and NGM1 participants (n = 28; ANOVA; P = 0.038). Boxplots define 
the 25th and 75th percentiles, median represented by centerline. IQR (75th–25th percentile) 
represented by whiskers. (e) Scatterplot of metabolite significance versus module 
membership (MM) of the 12 metabolites in the NGM3 discriminating metabolic module. 
Metabolites with a value of P < 0.05, significantly discriminate NGM3 from other NGMs. 
MM value indicates the degree of inter-connectedness of a specific metabolite to other 
metabolites in the module (higher MM value indicates greater inter-connectedness). (f) 
Using the same ex vivo assay as performed in 3a–c, 12, 13 DiHOME significantly reduced 
the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells at three different concentrations (LME; P = 0.04, 
P < 0.001, P = 0.001 for concentrations of 75, 130 and 200 μM respectively).
