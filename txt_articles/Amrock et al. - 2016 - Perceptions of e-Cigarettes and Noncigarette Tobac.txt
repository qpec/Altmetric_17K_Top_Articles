abstract
BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are now the most commonly used tobacco 
product among US youth. The extent to which perceptions of e-cigarettes’ harm and 
addictiveness differ from those of other products remains unknown, as does whether these 
perceptions have changed over time.
METHODS: Data from the 2012 and 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey, a repeated 
cross-sectional survey of grade 6 to 12 students, were used. Cross-tabulations and 
logistic regression models were used to describe correlates of perceptions of harm and 
addictiveness of e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco compared with cigarettes. 
Trends in perceptions of e-cigarettes’ harm among different demographic groups were also 
assessed.
RESULTS: In 2014, 73.0% believed that e-cigarettes were less harmful than cigarettes, 
compared with 20.2% for smokeless tobacco and 25.8% for cigars. By comparison, 47.1% 
believed that e-cigarettes were less addictive than cigarettes, compared with only 14.0% 
for smokeless tobacco and 31.5% for cigars. Use of each product was associated with a 
perception of decreased harm and addictiveness in adjusted analyses, as was being male, 
being a non-Hispanic white, and residing with a household member who used that product. 
Between 2012 and 2014, increasing numbers of US youth thought they were able to assess 
the relative harm of e-cigarettes and increasingly believed that e-cigarettes are less 
harmful than cigarettes.
CONCLUSIONS: Most US youth view e-cigarettes as less harmful and addictive than cigarettes. 
Far fewer think similarly about cigars and smokeless tobacco. Increases in e-cigarettes’ 
perceived safety mirrors rapid increases observed in their use. Perceived safety correlates 
with use of each tobacco product.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Noncigarette tobacco 
products including electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are increasingly used by US youth. However, little is 
known about youth beliefs regarding their safety and 
addictiveness, how such views might be changing, and 
how such perceptions relate to these products’ use.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Most US youth view 
e-cigarettes as less harmful and addictive than 
cigarettes. Far fewer feel similarly about cigars and 
smokeless tobacco. Perceived safety correlates 
with product use. Increases in perceived safety of 
e-cigarettes mirror rapid increases observed in 
e-cigarette use.

Although youth cigarette smoking 
rates have declined over the past 
decade, use of electronic cigarettes 
(e-cigarettes) has increased. 
1, 
 
2 Such 
trends are concerning in light of the 
marked uncertainty surrounding the 
safety of these products. 
3 
– 
6 Although 
e-cigarettes may aid smoking 
cessation efforts by adults, 
 
7 concerns 
have been raised about these 
products’ safety profile, potentially 
misleading advertisement to youth, 
and potential to predispose youth to 
later combustible tobacco use.

Because some have postulated 
that tobacco use is becoming 
renormalized, 
 
16 attempts to 
characterize youth perception of 
these products may prove important 
both for understanding the observed 
shifts in tobacco use and for public 
health planning. Perception of a 
product’s harm influences consumer 
behavior. 
17 For example, previous 
research has noted that social norms 
and exposure to tobacco-related 
media influence adolescents’ later 
tobacco use patterns, probably by 
influencing how individuals perceive 
such products. 
17, 
 
18 Recent research 
has demonstrated associations 
between youth perceptions of 
comparative harm and tobacco 
product use in the cases of light and 
intermittent smoking patterns19 
and e-cigarettes. 
20 
– 
22 Perceptions 
of relative safety regarding 
e-cigarettes may lead to unintended 
consequences. For example, some 
have suggested that perceptions of 
e-cigarette safety may inadvertently 
expose developing fetuses to 
nicotine, the substance primarily 
linked to adverse fetal effects. 
23
In light of the potential widespread 
implications of harm perceptions, 
we sought to provide an updated 
analysis on youth perceptions of 
relative harm and addictiveness 
of multiple noncigarette tobacco 
products, including a novel analysis 
of how such perceptions may have 
changed over time. By using data 
from the 2014 National Youth 
Tobacco Survey (NYTS), we provide 
nationally representative estimates 
of the perceived relative harm and 
addictiveness of e-cigarettes, cigars, 
and smokeless tobacco compared 
with traditional cigarettes and, in 
so doing, examine demographic 
and tobacco use correlates of those 
perceptions. By using comparable 
data from the 2012 NYTS, we 
examine trends in perceptions of 
e-cigarettes in an effort to assess 
whether perceptions of that product 
have changed concomitantly with 
their increasing use.
METHODS
Study Population
Data from the 2012 and 2014 NYTS 
were used. NYTS is designed to 
provide nationally representative 
estimates of US middle and high 
school students’ tobacco-related 
knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. 
It is conducted by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, and 
its methodology was approved by 
that institution’s institutional review 
board. Described elsewhere, 
 
24, 
 
25 
NYTS used a stratified cluster 
sample of sixth- to twelfth-grade 
students enrolled in public, secular, 
or nonsecular private schools. 
Respondents completed a pencil-
and-paper, self-administered 
questionnaire. Participation at 
the school and student level was 
voluntary. In 2012 and 2014, 
respectively, the school participation 
rates were 80.3% and 80.2%. The 
student participation rates were 
91.7% and 91.4%, respectively.
Variables
Dependent Variables
Two sets of survey questions were 
used as dependent variables. Each set 
of questions was asked in turn about 
e-cigarettes; cigars, cigarillos, or little 
cigars; and chewing tobacco, snuff, 
dip, or snus.
The first set of questions assessed 
respondents’ perceptions of the 
relative harm of each tobacco 
product compared with traditional 
cigarettes. Subjects were asked 
whether they believed the product 
was “less harmful, equally harmful, 
or more harmful than cigarettes, 
” 
to which they could respond with 
any of the above choices, “I have 
never heard of [these products], 
” or 
“I don’t know enough about [these 
products].”
The second set of questions assessed 
respondents’ perceptions of the 
addictiveness of tobacco products 
compared with traditional cigarettes. 
Subjects were asked whether they 
believed the product was “less 
addictive, equally addictive, or more 
addictive than cigarettes, 
” to which 
they could respond with any of the 
above choices, “I have never heard 
of [these products], 
” or “I don’t know 
enough about [these products].”
Given the variations in NYTS 
questioning, only questions 
about perceived relative harm of 
e-cigarettes were similarly phrased 
in the 2012 and 2014 NYTS. 
Consequently, assessments of trends 
are limited to e-cigarettes for these 
2 years. For questions about both 
harm and addictiveness, we denoted 
subjects’ confidence to provide such 
assessments if they were able to 
state a perception in lieu of reporting 
that they were unaware or did not 
know enough about the respective 
tobacco products. In logistic 
regression models, perceptions 
of specific products as being less 
harmful or addictive than cigarettes 
were assessed among subjects who 
were aware of and able to assess 
the analyzed products. Those who 
viewed products as equally or more 
harmful or addictive were analyzed 
as single comparator groups in the 
respective logistic models.
Independent Variables
Because norms and perceptions may 
differ along the lines of students’

demographic characteristics and 
use of and exposure to tobacco 
products, 
 
26 these were included 
as independent variables in our 
analysis. Demographic variables 
included students’ gender, age, and 
ethnicity.
Respondents’ self-report of ever 
using certain tobacco products was 
derived from a series of questions. 
For cigarettes, they were asked, 
“Have you ever tried cigarette 
smoking, even one or two puffs?” For 
e-cigarettes, respondents were asked, 
“Have you ever tried an electronic 
cigarette or e-cigarette such as Blu, 
21st Century Smoke or NJOY?” For 
cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars, 
the question read, “Have you ever 
tried smoking cigars, cigarillos, or 
little cigars, such as Black and Mild, 
Swisher Sweets, Dutch Masters, 
White Owl, or Phillies Blunts, even 
one or two puffs?” Finally, for 
smokeless tobacco, subjects were 
asked whether they had “ever used 
chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip, such 
as Redman, Levi Garrett, Beechnut, 
Skoal, Skoal Bandits, or Copenhagen, 
even just a small amount.” The 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention assessed consistency 
of responses to these questions in 
light of responses to other survey 
questions; inconsistent responses 
were excluded from the publicly 
available data set.
For e-cigarettes and cigars, cigarillos, 
or little cigars, subjects were also 
asked 2 questions about intended 
future use and potential social 
influence on that use. They were 
asked, “Do you think that you 
will try an electronic cigarette or 
e-cigarette soon?” and “If one of your 
best friends were to offer you an 
electronic cigarette or e-cigarette, 
would you use it?” Similarly phrased 
questions were asked about subjects’ 
thoughts on cigars, cigarillos, or 
little cigars. To each, subjects could 
respond on a 4-point Likert scale, 
“definitely yes, 
” “probably yes, 
” 
“probably no, 
” or “definitely no.”
Because living with a user of a 
specific tobacco product may also 
influence a youth’s perception 
and use of that product, variables 
assessing whether a respondent 
lived with a person who used the 
studied products was derived from 
the question, “Does anyone who 
lives with you now . . ., 
” to which 
respondents could select cigars, 
cigarillos, or little cigars; chewing 
tobacco, snuff, dip, or snus; and 
e-cigarettes.
Statistical Methods
Because of NYTS’s complex survey 
design, analyses were weighted 
to adjust for nonresponse and 
probability of selection and to match 
the sample’s sociodemographic 
characteristics with those of 
middle and high school students 
nationwide. 
24, 
 
25 Standard errors 
were calculated by Taylor series 
linearization to account for clustering 
of responses. 
27 Using Stata 11.2 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX), 
we assessed cross-tabulations and 
constructed logistic regression 
models. Average marginal effects 
were also reported to estimate 
the average percentage point (pp) 
change in harm or addictiveness 
perception by altering each covariate 
among the study’s sample.
RESULTS
Results from 22 007 students were 
analyzed from the 2014 NYTS. 
Data from an additional 24 658 
respondents in the 2012 NYTS, 
used in our assessment of trends 
in perceptions about e-cigarettes, 
were also used. Each year’s tally 
corresponds to ~27 million US youth.
Displayed in  
Table 1 are 
respondents’ beliefs about the 
harm of e-cigarettes, cigars, and 
smokeless tobacco compared with 
traditional cigarettes. Whereas only 
26.2% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 25.1% to 28.5%) of youth felt 
unable to provide an opinion on the 
comparative safety of e-cigarettes, 
roughly one-third reported that 
they did not know enough about 
cigars (33.2%; 95% CI, 32.0% to 
34.4%) and smokeless tobacco 
(32.5%; 95% CI, 31.0% to 34.0%) 
to comment on the relative harm 
of those products compared with 
tobacco. Of those holding opinions 
on the comparative harm of these 
products, opinions varied markedly 
by product (Supplemental Table 5). 
Although nearly 73.0% (95% CI, 
71.4% to 74.6%) of such students 
viewed e-cigarettes as less harmful 
than cigarettes, only 25.8% (95% CI, 
24.4% to 27.3%) and 20.2% (95% 
CI, 18.5% to 22.0%) viewed cigars 
and smokeless tobacco products, 
respectively, as similarly less harmful 
than cigarettes.
Opinions about comparative 
safety differed by demographic 
characteristics. Male students, older 
students, and non-Hispanic white 
students were consistently surer 
about their views on the comparative 
harm of tobacco products. In each 
case, those groups were more 
likely than their peers to view the 
alternative products studied as less 
harmful ( 
Table 1).
When changing views about 
e-cigarettes nationally were 
examined, increasing numbers of 
youth believe that e-cigarettes were 
less harmful than cigarettes ( 
Fig 
1) and appeared, moreover, to be 
increasingly sure of their views on 
the subject (Supplemental Table 6). 
In nearly all cases, except girls <15 
years of age who had previously used 
an e-cigarette, respondents were 
significantly more likely in 2014 than 
in 2012 to believe that e-cigarettes 
were less harmful.
Adjusted analyses from logistic 
regression models assessing subjects 
who provided an opinion on the 
comparative harm of the studied 
products are shown in  
Table 2. When 
adjusted for other covariates, use of 
each studied product was associated 
with a decreased perception of that

AMROCK et al 
product’s harm. Of all products, use 
of smokeless tobacco most markedly 
increased the likelihood of perceiving 
that that product was less harmful 
than cigarettes among the study’s 
sample. Believing that one would 
soon try the product was associated 
with the perception that cigars 
were less harmful, although this 
association was not clearly observed 
in the case of e-cigarettes. Responses 
to questions about what one would 
do if offered a particular product by 
a friend were also informative. The 
extent to which a respondent agreed 
that he or she would definitely try 
a cigar if a best friend were to offer 
it was associated with a perception 
that cigars were harmful, with an 
even stronger association observed 
for e-cigarettes. On average, such 
students were 23.1 pp (95% CI, 
18.1 to 28.1 pp) more likely to view 
e-cigarettes as less harmful than 
cigarettes compared with those who 
would definitely not agree to try a 
peer’s e-cigarette.
Variations were also noted by 
demographic characteristics. 
Compared with their female peers, 
male students on average viewed 
cigars (3.5 pp; 95% CI, 1.2 to 5.9 pp), 
smokeless tobacco (4.0 pp; 95% CI, 
2.1 to 5.9 pp), and e-cigarettes (7.6 pp; 
95% CI, 5.7 to 9.5 pp) as less harmful 
than cigarettes. After we accounted 
for other factors, age did not alter 
respondents’ perceptions. Compared 
with non-Hispanic white students, 
those of other ethnicities consistently 
viewed noncigarette tobacco products 
as more harmful than cigarettes. 
Regarding e-cigarettes, for example, 
non-Hispanic white students were, 
respectively, 4.9 pp (95% CI, 1.0 to 
8.6), 9.5 pp (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.0), and

3.9 pp (95% CI, 0.8 to 7.0) more likely 
to view e-cigarettes as less harmful 
than did non-Hispanic black students, 
Hispanic students, and those of other 
ethnicities. Living with a household 
member who used an noncigarette 
tobacco product also consistently 
reduced a student’s perception that 
that product was harmful.
Results regarding students’ 
perceptions of the addictiveness of 
e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless 
tobacco compared with cigarettes 
were largely similar to those regarding 
those products’ harms, although 
greater numbers of respondents 
felt unable to assess these products’ 
addictiveness ( 
Table 3). Roughly two-
fifths felt unable to assess cigars or 
smokeless tobacco. Greater numbers 
of subjects felt able to assess the 
addictiveness of e-cigarettes, with 
less than one-third feeling unready 
to do so. Of those holding opinions 
(Supplemental Table 7), more than 
half thought cigars were as addictive 
as cigarettes, and roughly one-third 
believed that cigars were less addictive 
than cigarettes. For smokeless tobacco, 
however, 63.2% of respondents 
believed it to be similarly addictive 
to cigarettes; nearly one-quarter 
believed it to be more addictive, 
and only 14.0% viewed it as less 
addictive than cigarettes. By contrast, 
e-cigarettes were widely perceived as 
less addictive than cigarettes; 47.1% of 
respondents thought e-cigarettes were 
less addictive, compared with 44.8% 
who viewed e-cigarettes as equally 
addictive to cigarettes. Only 8.1% 
viewed e-cigarettes as more addictive 
than traditional cigarettes. Patterns 
in beliefs about addictiveness largely 
mirrored those espoused regarding 
harm, discussed above.
Results from assessing views of 
the comparative addictiveness of 
e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless 
tobacco among those who held views 
were globally similar to perceptions 
of harm for cigars and smokeless 
tobacco ( 
Table 4). For e-cigarettes, 
some minor differences were 
noted. In contrast to perceptions 
of e-cigarette harm, in which non-
Hispanic black students were on 
average more likely than their 
non-Hispanic white peers to perceive 
e-cigarettes as less harmful, black 
students were more likely than white 
students to perceive e-cigarettes as 
less addictive than cigarettes (6.8 pp; 
95% CI, 3.2 to 10.5 pp).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined 
adolescents’ assessments of harm 
and addictiveness of multiple 
noncigarette tobacco products 
compared with cigarettes. With 
each product examined, a majority 
felt sufficiently informed to make 
such assessments, and, in the case 
of e-cigarettes, an even greater 
number of US youth felt able to 
do so. Among those who stated an 
opinion, and in contrast to views 
on cigars and smokeless tobacco, 
nearly 3 out of 4 youths believed that 
e-cigarettes were less harmful than 
cigarettes, and nearly half believed 
that e-cigarettes were less addictive 
than cigarettes. Strikingly, from 
2012 to 2014, US youth have become 
more confident that e-cigarettes are 
a safer and less addictive alternative 
to cigarettes. Such perceptions may 
underlie the recent rise in popularity 
of e-cigarettes among US youth.
Our results should be interpreted 
in light of existing data. Certain 
noncigarette tobacco products are 
increasingly used, with e-cigarettes 
now the most common regularly 
used tobacco product by US youth. 
28 
Their rise in popularity, alongside 
the rise in perceived safety 
documented here, has occurred 
despite ongoing controversies about 
these products’ safety.

16 Although 
what has engendered changing 
views on these products remains 
undetermined and is probably 
multifactorial, previous research on 
cigarettes suggests that social and 
physical environments play a key 
role in establishing tobacco-related 
norms. 
17 The ease of access to and 
increasing ubiquity of such products 
has probably been influential,

implicit, if not explicit, attempts to 
destigmatize tobacco use.16
We believe that our results 
complement others’ analyses of 
tobacco use patterns. The influential 
roles of tobacco-related media 
18 and 
targeted cigarette advertising 
30, 
 
31 
on adolescents’ tobacco use patterns 
have been previously noted. Likewise, 
perceptions of a lack of tobacco 
addictiveness have correlated with 
adolescent tobacco use. 
32 Unchecked 
by the public health community, 
10 
e-cigarette advertisement has 
ballooned in recent years 
15; 
moreover, manufacturers routinely 
make health claims unsupported by 
existing evidence. 
33 At the same time, 
perceptions of relative safety have 
blossomed. As a consequence, many 
adolescents who might otherwise 
have avoided tobacco products 
now use alternative products such 
as e-cigarettes, develop nicotine 
addictions, and later may move on to 
cigarette use. 
11 
–13
Results from the comparative cross-
sectional analysis also substantiate 
the notion that perception 
correlates highly with use. Across 
all noncigarette tobacco products 
assessed, having used, intending to 
use, or feeling susceptible to using the 
studied products was associated with 
a belief that they were safer and less 
addictive than cigarettes. Conversely, 
cigarette use was associated with 
beliefs that noncigarette products 
were more harmful, underscoring 
how adolescents perceive whichever 
product they use as less harmful.

adolescent tobacco perceptions,

to multiple tobacco products an 
association between perceived safety 
and use.
Analyses of specific populations 
also corroborate these and previous 
findings. Those who lived with 
a household member who used 
these tobacco products were more 
likely to contend that products 
were less harmful and addictive, 
findings previously observed. 
19, 
 
21, 
 
34 
Differences by ethnicity and gender 
also reflect this finding, with adjusted 
analyses finding that non-Hispanic 
white and male students, groups 
with the highest rates of e-cigarette 
use, 
28 were more likely to view 
e-cigarettes, as well as smokeless 
tobacco products, as less harmful 
than cigarettes. Nonetheless, in 
all subgroups of e-cigarette–naive 
respondents and in most subgroups 
of e-cigarette users assessed, 
perception of relative safety has 
increased over the past few years, 
seemingly indicating a global change 
in youth attitudes toward these 
products.
Despite the robustness of the results 
presented, our study’s findings 
should be interpreted in light of 
potential limitations. Because NYTS 
uses a repeated cross-sectional 
survey design, we were unable to 
make inferences about causality 
or fully differentiate between 
possible underlying period, age, or 
cohort effects. Nor were we able to 
investigate individual-level changes 
in perception and e-cigarette 
use over time. Data rely on self-
report, and residual confounding 
might remain to bias results in 
an unknown direction. Moreover, 
survey questions assessing risk were 
not comparable across all tobacco 
products and years analyzed, limiting 
our ability to discern how views on 
other noncigarette products have 
changed over time. Nor, given the 
questionnaire format, were we 
able to discern explicitly whether 
views had changed on e-cigarettes, 
cigarettes, or both; our analysis 
relies on respondents’ comparative 
assessments between those products. 
Furthermore, potential influential 
socioeconomic factors such as 
household income were not available 
in the data sets analyzed.
Nonetheless, we believe this study has 
significant strengths. By using a large, 
nationally representative sample of 
US youth, we depicted associations 
between the perceived relative 
harm and addictiveness of multiple 
noncigarette tobacco products and 
their use. Moreover, we demonstrated 
that youth views on e-cigarettes have 
changed, a finding that coincides 
with a marked increase in their use 
nationwide. US youth appear more 
confident that e-cigarettes are less 
harmful than cigarettes, raising 
concern that, absent regulation 
and public health efforts to combat 
changing social mores, e-cigarette use 
may continue to increase.
CONCLUSIONS
We examined views of the 
comparative harm of multiple 
noncigarette tobacco products 
including e-cigarettes in a nationally 
representative sample of US youth. 
Compared with their views on 
cigars and smokeless tobacco 
products, adolescents nationwide 
are more confident in their views 
on e-cigarettes and see e-cigarettes 
as less harmful than cigarettes. We 
document that beliefs about the 
comparative safety of e-cigarettes 
have increased markedly over the 
past few years, coinciding with 
increased use of these products.
