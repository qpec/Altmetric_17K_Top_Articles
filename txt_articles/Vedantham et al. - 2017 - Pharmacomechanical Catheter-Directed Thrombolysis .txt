BACKGROUND
The post-thrombotic syndrome frequently develops in patients with proximal deep-vein 
thrombosis despite treatment with anticoagulant therapy. Pharmacomechanical catheter-
directed thrombolysis (hereafter “pharmacomechanical thrombolysis”) rapidly removes 
thrombus and is hypothesized to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 692 patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis to re-
ceive either anticoagulation alone (control group) or anticoagulation plus pharmaco-
mechanical thrombolysis (catheter-mediated or device-mediated intrathrombus de-
livery of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and thrombus aspiration or 
maceration, with or without stenting). The primary outcome was development of the 
post-thrombotic syndrome between 6 and 24 months of follow-up.
RESULTS
Between 6 and 24 months, there was no significant between-group difference in the 
percentage of patients with the post-thrombotic syndrome (47% in the pharmacome-
chanical-thrombolysis group and 48% in the control group; risk ratio, 0.96; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.56). Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis led 
to more major bleeding events within 10 days (1.7% vs. 0.3% of patients, P 
= 
0.049), 
but no significant difference in recurrent venous thromboembolism was seen over the 
24-month follow-up period (12% in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group and 
8% in the control group, P 
= 
0.09). Moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome oc-
curred in 18% of patients in the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group versus 24% 
of those in the control group (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.04). Severity 
scores for the post-thrombotic syndrome were lower in the pharmacomechanical-
thrombolysis group than in the control group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up 
(P<0.01 for the comparison of the Villalta scores at each time point), but the improve-
ment in quality of life from baseline to 24 months did not differ significantly between 
the treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with acute proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of phar-
macomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis to anticoagulation did not result in 
a lower risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but did result in a higher risk of 
major bleeding. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others;

Pharmacomechanical Thrombolysis for Deep-Vein Thrombosis
D
espite the use of anticoagulant 
therapy, the post-thrombotic syndrome 
develops within 2 years in approximately 
half of patients with proximal deep-vein throm-
bosis.1-4 The post-thrombotic syndrome common-
ly causes chronic limb pain and swelling and 
can progress to cause major disability, leg ulcers, 
and impaired quality of life.5,6 Small randomized 
trials have suggested that active removal of acute 
thrombus may preserve venous function and pre-
vent the post-thrombotic syndrome (the “open-
vein hypothesis”).3,7,8
Pharmacomechanical catheter-directed throm-
bolysis (hereafter “pharmacomechanical throm-
bolysis”) is the delivery of a fibrinolytic drug 
into the thrombus with concomitant thrombus 
aspiration or maceration.9 The objective of phar-
macomechanical thrombolysis is to diminish the 
thrombus burden by means of low-dose fibrino-
lysis and mechanical therapy, thereby reducing 
the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome while 
minimizing the risk of bleeding.10-13 We per-
formed the Acute Venous Thrombosis: Throm-
bus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-Directed 
Thrombolysis (ATTRACT) trial to determine 
whether pharmacomechanical thrombolysis pre-
vents the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients 
with proximal deep-vein thrombosis.
Methods
Trial Organization
We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, random-
ized, open-label, assessor-blinded, controlled 
clinical trial sponsored by the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Insti-
tutes of Health. Boston Scientific and Covidien 
(now Medtronic) provided supplemental funding. 
The trial drug and additional funding were pro-
vided by Genentech. Compression stockings were 
donated by BSN Medical. These companies played 
no role in the design or conduct of the trial or 
in the analysis or reporting of the data.
The trial was approved by the institutional 
review boards at all participating centers. The 
steering committee and site investigators were 
responsible for the design14 and conduct of the 
trial, respectively. The contract research organi-
zation Inclinix provided guidance to support 
participant-recruitment efforts, and data analy-
ses were conducted by the trial statistical staff 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The 
steering committee vouches for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and the analyses and 
for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, which 
is available at NEJM.org.
Patient Population
Patients with symptomatic proximal deep-vein 
thrombosis involving the femoral, common fem-
oral, or iliac vein (with or without other involved 
ipsilateral veins) were enrolled at 56 clinical cen-
ters in the United States. Patients were excluded 
if they were younger than 16 or older than 75 
years of age, were pregnant, had had symptoms 
for more than 14 days, were at high bleeding risk, 
had active cancer, had established post-throm-
botic syndrome, or had had ipsilateral deep-vein 
thrombosis in the previous 2 years. The full list 
of eligibility criteria, investigators, and sites is 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. All 
the patients provided written informed consent.
Randomization
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group or 
the control group (no procedural intervention) 
with the use of a Web-based central randomiza-
tion system that ensured concealment of the treat-
ment assignments. Randomization was stratified 
according to clinical center and thrombus extent 
(i.e., whether thrombosis involved the common 
femoral or iliac vein [iliofemoral deep-vein 
thrombosis] or not [femoropopliteal deep-vein 
thrombosis]). The randomization sequence, with 
varying block sizes, was computer-generated by 
an independent statistician.
Treatment and Outcome Assessments
Patients in each treatment group received initial 
and long-term anticoagulant therapy consistent 
with published guidelines, including the option 
of rivaroxaban when it became available, and were 
provided sized-to-fit, knee-high, elastic compres-
sion stockings providing 30 to 40 mm Hg of 
pressure (BSN Medical) at the 10-day follow-up 
visit and every 6 months.15,16 Pharmacomechanical 
catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed in 
a manner consistent with published guidelines by 
board-certified physicians whose credentials were 
approved by the trial leadership.14,17,18 A detailed 
description of these methods is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
of <35 mg) was delivered into the thrombus by 
one of three methods. If the popliteal vein was 
occluded or the inferior vena cava was involved, 
physicians were required to use “infusion-first” 
therapy, which started with rt-PA infusion 
through a multi-sidehole catheter of the physi-
cian’s choice for no longer than 30 hours. For 
the remaining patients, physicians were required 
to first attempt single-session thrombus removal 
with rapid delivery of rt-PA through the AngioJet 
Rheolytic Thrombectomy System (Boston Scien-
tific) or the Trellis Peripheral Infusion System 
(Covidien) and then to infuse rt-PA for no longer 
than 24 hours if residual thrombus was present.
After the initial delivery of rt-PA, physicians 
could use balloon maceration, catheter aspiration, 
thrombectomy with the use of the AngioJet or 
Trellis system, percutaneous transluminal balloon 
venoplasty, stent placement (iliac or common 
femoral vein), or a combination of procedures to 
clear residual thrombus and treat obstructive 
lesions.17,18 Stenting was encouraged for lesions 
that were causing 50% or greater narrowing of the 
diameter of the vein, robust collateral filling, or a 
mean pressure gradient of more than 2 mm Hg. 
Treatment was discontinued when there was at 
least 90% thrombus removal with restoration of 
flow or when there was a serious complication.
The international normalized ratio was re-
quired to be 1.6 or lower at the start of pharmaco-
mechanical thrombolysis. During the procedure, 
patients received twice-daily subcutaneous injec-
tions of low-molecular-weight heparin in thera-
peutic doses or unfractionated heparin infusions 
(with the dose reduced to 6 to 12 units per kilo-
gram of body weight per hour [maximum, 1000 
units per hour] during rt-PA infusions). Additional 
unfractionated heparin boluses (up to 50 units 
per kilogram) were given during the procedure 
at the physician’s discretion.
Trial outcomes were assessed at 10 and 30 days 
and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomiza-
tion. The clinical personnel who performed as-
sessments of efficacy outcomes and the adjudica-
tors of safety and efficacy outcomes were unaware 
of the treatment assignments.
Primary Efficacy Outcome
Development of the post-thrombotic syndrome, 
the primary efficacy outcome, was defined as a 
Villalta score of 5 or higher or an ulcer in the leg 
with the index deep-vein thrombosis, at any time 
between the 6-month follow-up visit and the 
24-month follow-up visit.19,20 The Villalta scale 
ranges from 0 to 33, with higher scores indicat-
ing more severe post-thrombotic syndrome (de-
tails are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Patients were also counted as having the 
post-thrombotic syndrome if they underwent an 
unplanned endovascular procedure to treat se-
vere venous symptoms beyond 6 months after 
randomization, unless a Villalta score within the 
previous 4 weeks was lower than 5.
Secondary Efficacy and Safety Outcomes
The occurrence of the post-thrombotic syndrome 
at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was counted if the 
Villalta score at that visit was 5 or higher. The 
severity of the post-thrombotic syndrome was 
evaluated at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months with the 
use of the Villalta scale and the Venous Clinical 
Severity Score21 (scores range from 0 to 27, with 
higher scores indicating more severe post-
thrombotic syndrome). The proportion of pa-
tients with moderate-to-severe post-thrombotic 
syndrome (Villalta score, ≥10) was also assessed.
A major non–post-thrombotic syndrome treat-
ment failure was assessed when any of three 
events occurred in the index leg: an unplanned 
endovascular procedure to treat severe venous 
symptoms within 6 months, venous gangrene 
within 6 months, or an amputation within 24 
months. The combined outcome of the post-
thrombotic syndrome or major non–post-throm-
botic syndrome treatment failure was also as-
sessed.
Patient-reported health-related quality of life 
at baseline and 24 months was assessed with the 
use of the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-
Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)22 and the 
venous disease–specific Venous Insufficiency 
Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of 
Life (VEINES-QOL) measure.23 Leg pain and leg 
swelling at baseline, 10 days, and 30 days were 
assessed with the use of a 7-point Likert pain 
scale (with higher scores indicating more severe 
pain)24 and by measuring calf circumference, 
respectively.
In the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis 
group, thrombus removal was quantified by in-
dependent central readers who scored venograms 
obtained before and after the procedure, using 
the proximal-vein components of the Marder 
score.25 The modified Marder score ranges from

Pharmacomechanical Thrombolysis for Deep-Vein Thrombosis
0 to 24, with 0 representing no thrombus and 24 
representing complete thrombosis.
Safety outcomes included bleeding, recurrent 
venous thromboembolism, and death, which were 
reported throughout follow-up and summarized 
through 10 days and 24 months.26 A detailed 
description of all trial outcomes is provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that the post-thrombotic syndrome 
would develop in 30% of the patients in the 
control group between 6 and 24 months1,27-29 and 
hypothesized that pharmacomechanical throm-
bolysis would reduce this percentage to 20% or 
lower.30-33 Assuming a 10% loss to follow-up, we 
calculated that 692 patients would be required in 
order for the trial to have 80% power to detect 
the hypothesized treatment effect at a two-sided 
α of 0.05.
Two types of analyses were performed: a modi-
fied intention-to-treat analysis that included all 
patients who underwent randomization except 
those who did not have deep-vein thrombosis at 
enrollment, and a per-protocol analysis that ex-
cluded patients who, within 7 days after random-
ization, were randomly assigned to receive phar-
macomechanical thrombolysis but did not receive 
it or who were randomly assigned to the control 
group but had skin puncture for pharmacomechan-
ical thrombolysis or any thrombolytic therapy.
The primary analysis was a modified intention-
to-treat analysis that compared the cumulative 
proportion of patients who had development of 
the post-thrombotic syndrome within 24 months 
between the treatment groups with the use of the 
Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with adjustment 
for the two stratification variables. A two-sided 
P value of 0.05 or lower was considered to indi-
cate statistical significance. The treatment effects 
are summarized with the use of stratum-adjusted 
risk ratios and their corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals. To account for the missing as-
sessments during follow-up, a sensitivity analysis 
with multiple imputation, under the assumption 
that data were missing at random, was conducted 
on the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel risk-ratio esti-
mates with the use of prespecified auxiliary 
variables (age, sex, body-mass index, extent of 
deep-vein thrombosis, the maximum Villalta score 
observed at assessments from 6 to 24 months, 
and available Villalta scores at baseline, 10 days, 
or 30 days). Details are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Prespecified secondary analyses included a per-
protocol analysis of the primary outcome and 
modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analy-
ses of each of the secondary efficacy outcomes. 
Stratum-adjusted Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests 
were used for the analysis of each of the categor-
ical secondary outcomes and safety outcomes. 
The mean Villalta and Venous Clinical Severity 
Score assessments at each visit were estimated 
with the use of piecewise linear-regression 
growth-curve models with adjustment for strata 
and prespecified baseline covariates (age, sex, 
body-mass index, and Villalta score). Changes 
from baseline to 24 months in quality-of-life 
scores and from baseline to 10 and 30 days in 
leg-pain scores and calf circumferences were 
compared between the two treatment groups by 
means of linear regression with adjustment for 
strata. To account for multiple testing, a two-
sided P value of 0.01 or lower was considered to 
indicate statistical significance for the secondary 
efficacy analyses. A two-sided P value of 0.05 or 
lower was considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance for the safety analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline
From December 2009 through December 2014, a 
total of 692 patients underwent randomization 
(337 to the pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis 
group and 355 to the control group) (Fig. 1). One 
patient who was assigned to the pharmaco-
mechanical-thrombolysis group was excluded from 
all analyses; on review of prerandomization 
assessments by personnel who were unaware of 
the treatment assignments, this patient was found 
not to have a qualifying deep-vein thrombosis. 
The baseline characteristics of the patients were 
similar in the treatment groups (Table 1, and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Protocol and Treatment Adherence
Within 7 days after randomization, 5 patients who 
had been assigned to the control group under-
went pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and 11 
patients who had been assigned to the pharmaco-
mechanical-thrombolysis group did not undergo 
the procedure. These patients were excluded from 
the per-protocol analysis. The use of anticoagula-

tion and compression stockings and the elements 
of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis are sum-
marized in Table 2. The mean duration of anti-
coagulation before the first permanent cessation 
was similar in the two treatment groups (median 
days to stopping, 211 days in the pharmaco-
mechanical-thrombolysis group and 231 days in 
the control group; P 
= 
0.16) (Table 2). Pharmaco-
mechanical thrombolysis was performed at a me-
dian of 1 day after randomization. The mean 
degree of thrombus removal was 76% (mean pre-
procedure Marder score, 11.4; mean postproce-
dure Marder score, 2.7; change, −8.7; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], −8.1 to −9.4; P<0.001).
Post-Thrombotic Syndrome
In the primary analysis, the post-thrombotic syn-
drome developed over the 24-month period in 
157 of 336 patients (47%) assigned to the phar-
macomechanical-thrombolysis group and in 171 
of 355 patients (48%) assigned to the control 
group (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.11; 
P 
= 
0.56) (Table 3). The findings were similar in 
a per-protocol analysis (151 of 325 patients who 
underwent pharmacomechanical thrombolysis 
and 169 of 350 who did not undergo pharmaco-
mechanical thrombolysis; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% 
CI, 0.81 to 1.10) and in a sensitivity analysis with 
multiple imputation (risk ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.78 to 1.02) (Tables S3 and S4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The results were similar in 
prespecified subgroups (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix), except for a suggestion that 
patients 65 years of age or older were less likely 
to benefit from pharmacomechanical thrombo-
lysis than younger patients (P 
= 
0.04 for the inter-
action).
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in the percentage of patients who had ma-
jor non–post-thrombotic syndrome treatment 
failure or overall treatment failure (P≤0.01 was 
considered to indicate statistical significance for 
the secondary efficacy analyses) (Table 3). Moder-
ate-to-severe post-thrombotic syndrome (Villalta 
score, ≥10) occurred in 18% of the patients in 
the pharmacomechanical thrombolysis group and 
24% of those in the control group (risk ratio, 
0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P 
= 
0.04). The severity 
of the post-thrombotic syndrome, as assessed by 
the mean Villalta score and mean Venous Clini-
cal Severity Score, was significantly lower in the 
pharmacomechanical-thrombolysis group than 
in the control group at all visits between 6 and 
24 months (P≤0.01 for the between-group com-
parison at each time point, with the exception of 
the comparison of the Venous Clinical Severity 
Score at 24 months, for which P=0.03) (Table 4). 
Over the 24-month period, there was no signifi-

The reasons for the exclusion of patients before randomization are shown 
in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. Randomization was stratified 
according to clinical center and extent of deep-vein thrombosis. Two patients 
(one in each treatment group) missed all four assessments for the post-
thrombotic syndrome (PTS) because they died before 6 months. LEP denotes 
late endovascular procedure.

The Villalta scale is an assessment of five patient-reported symptoms (cramps, itching, pins and needles, leg heaviness, and pain) and six 
signs reported by clinicians who were unaware of the treatment assignments (pretibial edema, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, venous 
ectasia, redness, and pain during calf compression), scored on a 4-point scale (a score of 0 denotes none or minimal, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 
and 3 severe) and summed into a total score for each leg; a leg with an ulcer was assigned a minimum score of 15 points. Total scores range 
from 0 to 33, with higher scores indicating more severe post-thrombotic syndrome; a score of 0 to 4 denotes none or minimal, 5 to 9 mild, 
10 to 14 moderate, and 15 or higher severe. Two patients in the control group were not assessed.

venous disease–specific quality of life (P 
= 
0.08) 
or general quality of life (P 
= 
0.37). The mean 
decreases in leg pain from baseline in the 
pharmaco 
mechanical-thrombolysis group and 
the control group were 1.62 and 1.29 Likert 
points at 10 days, respectively (P 
= 
0.02), and 2.17 
and 1.83 Likert points at 30 days, respectively 
(P 
= 
0.03). For leg circumference, a decrease of 
0.26 cm and an increase of 0.27 cm from base-
line at 10 days occurred in the pharmacomechan-
ical-thrombo 
lysis group and the control group, 
respectively (P 
= 
0.02), and decreases from base-
line of 0.74 cm and 0.28 cm had occurred at 30 
days, respectively (P 
= 
0.05). The results of the 
per-protocol analyses were similar to those of 
the modified intention-to-treat analyses (Tables 
S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety Outcomes
Major bleeding within 10 days occurred in 6 pa-
tients (1.7%) assigned to the pharmacomechanical-
thrombolysis group, as compared with 1 patient 
(0.3%) assigned to the control group (P 
= 
0.049) 
(Table 3). Details of the bleeding events are 
shown in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Recurrent venous thromboembolism within 
24 months occurred in 42 patients (12%) as-
signed to the pharmacomechanical-thromboly-
sis group (including 1 fatal pulmonary embo-
lism at 6 months) and in 30 patients (8%) 
assigned to the control group (P 
= 
0.09). Of the 
15 deaths that occurred (7 in the pharmaco-
mechanical thrombolysis group and 8 in the 
control group), none occurred within 10 days 
after randomization (Table 3, and Table S8 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

Discussion
In this trial, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis 
did not prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome in 
patients with acute proximal deep-vein throm-
bosis; this finding persisted in per-protocol 
analyses and was consistent across all prespeci-
fied subgroups. In the pharmacomechanical-
thrombolysis group, there were more early major 
bleeds than in the control group, but less major 
bleeding (1.7% of patients, with no fatal or intra-
cranial bleeds) occurred in association with the

patients), its geographic and demographic scope 
(56 U.S. centers vs. 4 Norwegian centers), and 
our greater use of mechanical therapies versus 
the longer rt-PA infusions used in the CAVENT 
trial. Inadequate thrombus removal is unlikely 
to explain the failure of pharmacomechanical 
thrombolysis to prevent the post-thrombotic syn-
drome in our trial, since venography showed 
effective thrombus removal. Standard care for 
deep-vein thrombosis did not substantially differ 
between the two treatment groups and would 
not explain the observed lack of a beneficial ef-
fect of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis in pre-
venting the post-thrombotic syndrome.
Our trial had several limitations. There was a 
substantial number of missing assessments of 
the post-thrombotic syndrome. As expected, there 
were occasional missed visits among patients 
who returned for follow-up, which were balanced 
between the treatment groups. However, among 
the 80 patients with no post-thrombotic syn-
drome assessments, two thirds were in the con-
trol group, which is likely to have resulted in an 
underestimate of the treatment effect. Although 
the sensitivity analysis conducted with the use of 
methods to impute assessments of the post-
thrombotic syndrome in these patients yielded 
findings similar to those in the primary analy-
sis, the extent of incomplete follow-up is still a 
limitation of the trial.
A large number of patients had to be screened 
in order to enroll our target sample; this largely 
reflects the exclusion of patients who would not 
receive pharmacomechanical thrombolysis in clin-
ical practice (e.g., patients with a high bleeding 
risk), but it could reduce the generalizability of 
the trial. The trial was medium-sized, but given 
the risks of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, 
it was unlikely to miss a treatment effect of suf-
ficient size to influence clinical practice. How-
ever, the trial had limited power to examine treat-
ment effects within subgroups. Although many 
elements of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis 
were standardized, there was variation in how the 
procedure was performed, in order to accommo-
date patient-specific differences and physician 
preferences. We did not randomly assign patients 
to specific treatment methods, which precluded 
a direct comparison of outcomes among the 
methods. Finally, most patients received warfa-
rin; although direct oral anticoagulants are now 
frequently used, this change should not have 
affected the rates of the post-thrombotic syn-
drome, since both types of anticoagulation are 
similarly effective at preventing recurrent deep-
vein thrombosis.15,37
Because the post-thrombotic syndrome varies 
in its clinical manifestations, we evaluated its 
presence and severity in complementary ways. 
Assessments made with the use of the Villalta 
scale and the Venous Clinical Severity Score were 
consistent in suggesting that pharmacomechan-
ical thrombolysis reduced the severity of the 
post-thrombotic syndrome, which raises the pos-
sibility that the etiologic factors that predispose 
patients to the development of the post-throm-
botic syndrome may differ at least partly from 
those that determine progression to advanced 
post-thrombotic syndrome. Further study of the 
open-vein hypothesis may help to define the 
pathophysiological basis of the post-thrombotic 
syndrome and identify opportunities to reduce 
progression or alleviate disabling symptoms.
In conclusion, among patients with acute 
proximal deep-vein thrombosis, the addition of 
pharmacomechanical catheter-directed throm-
bolysis to anticoagulation did not result in a 
lower risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome but 
did result in a higher risk of major bleeding.

clinical trial registration
The Journal requires investigators to register their clinical trials  
in a public trials registry. The members of the International Committee  
of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) will consider most reports of clinical  
trials for publication only if the trials have been registered.  
Current information on requirements and appropriate registries  
is available at www.icmje.org/faq_clinical.html.
