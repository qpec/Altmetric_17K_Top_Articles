Abstract
Background: Socio-economic inequalities are associated with unequal exposure to social, economic and
environmental risk factors, which in turn contribute to health inequalities. Understanding the impact of specific
public health policy interventions will help to establish causality in terms of the effects on health inequalities.
Methods: Systematic review methodology was used to identify systematic reviews from high-income countries
that describe the health equity effects of upstream public health interventions. Twenty databases were searched
from their start date until May 2017. The quality of the included articles was determined using the Assessment of
Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR).
Results: Twenty-nine systematic reviews were identified reporting 150 unique relevant primary studies. The reviews
summarised evidence of all types of primary and secondary prevention policies (fiscal, regulation, education,
preventative treatment and screening) across seven public health domains (tobacco, alcohol, food and nutrition,
reproductive health services, the control of infectious diseases, the environment and workplace regulations). There
were no systematic reviews of interventions targeting mental health. Results were mixed across the public health
domains; some policy interventions were shown to reduce health inequalities (e.g. food subsidy programmes,
immunisations), others have no effect and some interventions appear to increase inequalities (e.g. 20 mph and low
emission zones). The quality of the included reviews (and their primary studies) were generally poor and clear gaps
in the evidence base have been highlighted.
Conclusions: The review does tentatively suggest interventions that policy makers might use to reduce health
inequalities, although whether the programmes are transferable between high-income countries remains unclear.

Background
In high-income countries like the UK, USA and Sweden,
the welfare state plays an integral role in influencing the
social determinants of health. The welfare state relates
to post-World War Two government measures for the
provision of key services and social transfers including
the state’s role in education, health, housing, poor relief,
social insurance, and public health policy in high-income
countries [1]. The most encompassing and extensive
welfare states are found in Europe where countries are
able to use a variety of policy mechanisms - namely public
health policies, social policies (e.g. cash transfers, housing
and education) and healthcare services - to improve the
health of their citizens and mitigate the health effects of
socio-economic inequalities [2]. Previous research con-
ducted in this area has generally found that countries with
welfare provision, such as Sweden or Norway, have better
population health than those with less generous social

 safety nets [2]. However, socio-economic inequalities in
health
still
remain
widespread
across
Europe
and
elsewhere; for example, people with higher income, occu-
pation or education have lower mortality and morbidity
[2–4]. In addition, comparative research examining how
differences in the magnitude of health inequalities vary by
welfare state has not found consistent evidence of lower
health inequalities in the more extensive welfare states –
this observation has been termed the Nordic public health
puzzle [5, 6]. The majority of this research, however, has
examined general associations between welfare state re-
gime types and health inequalities. There has been very lit-
tle research examining the effects of specific welfare state
policies on health inequalities – especially in respect to
public health policies. Consequently, this review aims to
examine the effects of public health policies on health in-
equalities in high-income welfare states.
Methods
Conceptual framework
Hawe and Potvin [7] describe public health policy inter-
ventions as ‘policies or programs that shift the distribu-
tion of health risk by addressing the underlying social,
economic and environmental conditions’ (pg. 8) acting at
both primary and secondary prevention levels [8]. Fur-
ther, Main et al. [9] define population-level interventions
as those applied to populations, groups, areas, jurisdic-
tions or institutions. Mackenbach and McKee [10] iden-
tify several key public health policy domains: tobacco,
alcohol, food and nutrition, reproductive health services,
the control of infectious diseases, mental health, the
environment (road traffic injuries, air, land and water
pollution) and workplace regulations. We further cat-
egorise public health policies by specific mechanisms of
delivery into: fiscal policy, regulation, education, pre-
ventative treatment and screening. The interactions of
these levels of intervention, the specific policy domains,
and the delivery mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1 – the
framework which informs our umbrella review.
Design
Umbrella reviews - overviews of systematic reviews -
build on the strengths of individual reviews and add
scale by integrating the findings of multiple reviews
together [11]. The full methodology has been previously
described in the published protocol [12]; the review was
registered with PROSPERO, the International Prospect-
ive Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:
CRD42016025283).

 were tailored to the specific host site, and are detailed in
Additional file 1: Appendix S2. Citation follow up was
conducted on the bibliographies of all included articles
and relevant previous umbrella reviews. We did not
exclude papers on the basis of language, country or pub-
lication date. Searches were limited to peer-reviewed
publications only. Authors were contacted to obtain any
relevant information that was missing. However, if
reviews did not have sufficient equity data, they were
excluded from further analysis. In addition, experts were
contacted to identify any additional relevant information
on unpublished and in-progress research from key
experts in the field.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for the review were determined a
priori in terms of PICOS (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, Outcome and Setting; [13]):
� Population: Children and adults (all ages) in any
high-income country (defined as OECD members),
and additional EU-28 members.
� Intervention: Upstream, population-level (e.g. coun-
try, state/region/province, municipality), public
health policies defined as primary and secondary
level interventions, in eight policy domains (tobacco,
alcohol, food and nutrition, reproductive health ser-
vices, control of infectious diseases, mental health,
the environment [road traffic injuries, air, land and
water pollution] and workplace regulations) utilising
fiscal policy, regulation, education, preventative
treatment and screening delivery mechanisms.
� Comparison: We included systematic reviews that
include studies with and without controls.
Acceptable controls include randomised or matched
designs.
� Outcomes: Primary outcome measures included
inequalities by socio-economic status (SES, defined
as: individual income, wealth, education, employ-
ment or occupational status, benefit receipt; area-
level economic indicators and ethnicity given the
strong relationship between ethnicity and lower SES
particularly in the USA [14]) in morbidity, mortality,
health behaviours, accidents, or injuries. When avail-
able, cost effectiveness data was also collected.
� Study design: Systematic reviews of quantitative
intervention studies. Following the methods of
previous umbrella reviews [15], publications had to
meet the two mandatory criteria of Database of
Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE): (i) that
there is a defined review question (with definition of
at least two of, the participants, interventions,
outcomes or study designs) and (ii) that the search
strategy included at least one named database, in
conjunction with either reference checking, hand-
searching, citation searching or contact with authors
in the field.
Study selection and data extraction
The initial screening of titles and abstracts was con-
ducted by two reviewers (KT and FHB), with a random
10% of the sample checked by a third reviewer (CM).
Agreement between the reviewers was excellent (κ
= 0.77) [16]. The screening of the full papers was con-
ducted by two reviewers (KT and FHB) with input from
other members of the research team (AT, TH, CM). The
methods and main findings were extracted using a be-
spoke data extraction form (detailed in Additional file 1:
Appendix S3). Data extraction was conducted by four
reviewers (CM: food and nutrition; AT: screening and
infectious diseases; KT and FHB: all others). A full check
of the data extraction was completed by FHB and KT.
Any discrepancies on selection and extraction were re-
solved through discussion between the lead reviewers
(KT and FHB) and the project lead (CB). Figure 2 details
the process of inclusion and exclusion of studies from the
review and the reasons for exclusion at the full paper stage
(n = 636) are available in Additional file 1: Appendix S4.
Quality appraisal and data synthesis
The
Assessment
of
Multiple
Systematic
Reviews
(AMSTAR)
[17]
tool
was
used
to
determine
the
methodological quality of the systematic reviews. We
also used the revised version of AMSTAR (R-AMSTAR)
[18] which assigns an overall quality score to the systematic
review (Additional file 1: Appendix S5). The R-AMSTAR
scores were converted to low (11–22), medium (23–33)
and high (34–44) quality ratings to aid interpretation.
Data extraction only utilised the information from the sys-
tematic review (and any relevant supplementary material);
we did not extract data from the original primary studies.
The systematic reviews were narratively synthesised in ac-
cordance with the conceptual framework shown in Fig. 1
[12]. In relation to each domain/intervention, we highlight
three sets of public health policy interventions which
frame our discussion section: (1) those that are effective
in reducing health inequalities; (2) those that do not
have any effect on health inequalities or where the system-
atic review level evidence is unclear; and (3) those inter-
ventions that appear to increase health inequalities. In the
results and discussion sections that follows, primary stud-
ies refers to empirical research studies evaluating the im-
pact of a particular intervention. We typically use
systematic review (or simply review) to highlight the con-
clusions of a particular systematic review, that often sum-
marise the evidence of primary studies for a particular
domain/intervention.

 Results
A total of 53,510 citations were retrieved from the 20
databases
searched
and
downloaded
to
Endnote.
De-deduplication using a combination of Endnote, a
web-based software package entitled the ‘Systematic
Review Assistant-Deduplication Module’ by Rathbone
and colleagues [19] and further manual extraction re-
sulted in 27,781 unique citations. In total, 29 systematic
reviews were included in our review (Fig. 2) – reporting
on 150 unique primary studies. In terms of the levels of
intervention, there were 26 reviews focusing on primary
prevention
[20–45]
and
three reviews
focusing
on
secondary prevention [46–48]. In respect to the different
delivery mechanisms, there were five reviews of fiscal
policy [21–24, 44], eight of regulation [29, 34–40], six of
education [27, 33, 41–43, 45], one of preventative treat-
ment [47] and one of screening [48]. There were eight
reviews that also assessed multiple delivery mechanisms
[20, 25, 26, 28, 30–32, 46]. In terms of policy domains,
there were four systematic reviews of tobacco interven-
tions [20, 29, 30, 41] (53 unique relevant primary stud-
ies); one review reporting alcohol interventions [44] (one
primary study), fourteen reviews of food and nutrition inter-
ventions [21–25, 27, 28, 31–36, 42] (63 unique relevant
primary
studies);
three
reviews
of
interventions
controlling infectious diseases [26, 46, 47] (21 unique
relevant primary studies); three reviews of interventions
associated with reproductive health services [43, 45, 48]
(8 unique primary references); three reviews of environ-
mental interventions [37–39] (3 relevant unique primary
studies) and one of workplace regulations [40] (one
unique study). No relevant equality reviews were located
for the mental health domain. Only six primary studies
were included in more than one systematic review
and care was taken not to duplicate their findings.
Studies were located in a range of high-income coun-
tries, including across the EU-28 members, although
as is common, the majority of studies were conducted
in the USA. The earliest review was published in
2000 and the latest in 2017. Using the R-AMSTAR
tool, nine reviews were considered low quality (score
11–22) [23, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 46–48], sixteen medium
quality (score 23–33) [20–22, 24–26, 29–32, 34, 35, 40, 42,
44, 45] and four high quality (score 34–44) [27, 28, 36, 38].
The reviews were narratively synthesised below by (i)
level of intervention - primary and secondary; (ii)
delivery mechanisms - fiscal policy, regulation, educa-
tion, preventative treatment and screening; and (iii) pol-
icy domains - tobacco, food and nutrition, control of
infectious diseases, cancer control and prevention, the

 environment and workplace regulation. The results are
also summarised in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
Primary prevention delivery mechanism 1: fiscal
Fiscal strategies employed by the state use the tax sys-
tem to change demand for products deemed healthy/un-
healthy by increasing or decreasing price or rewarding/
punishing particular behaviours. Eight reviews of the
health inequality effects of fiscal policies in the domains of
tobacco (n = 1), alcohol (n = 1), food and nutrition (n = 5)
and the control of infectious diseases (n = 1) were included
and the results are summarised below and in Table 1.
Tobacco
One large review by Brown et al. [20] explored the
effects on health inequalities of population-level inter-
ventions and policies to reduce smoking in adults.
Twelve studies in the review reported on fiscal measures.
These found mixed success in terms of the effects on
health inequalities of increasing cigarette or tobacco
taxes. However, the higher quality primary studies
generally found that smoking or tobacco use reduced in
all
groups
with
no
strong
trends
associated
with
socio-economic status, although one study found par-
ticular decreases amongst the lowest educated.
Alcohol
A single review by Jackson et al. [44] investigated the
effect of fiscal interventions on public health in the
domain of alcohol. This systematic review included one
primary study that investigated the role of a large reduc-
tion in alcohol price in Finland (taxes fell by an average
of 33%). It noted an increase in alcohol-related deaths in
men by 16% and in women by 31%, with deaths amongst
the 30–59 age group greatest for those individuals with
lower levels of education, social class and income.
Food and nutrition
Five reviews examined the effects on health inequalities
of fiscal interventions in the domain of food and nutri-
tion. A review by Alagiyawanna et al. [21] explored the
effect of food taxes and subsidies on health behaviours
and
other
health
outcomes.
Two
primary
studies
included in this review examined effects of the USA
Food Stamp Programme (subsidy), finding that it had a
positive impacts on fetal survival and weight gain during
pregnancy of low-income populations. Food subsidies
were also assessed in another review by Black et al. [22]
which included nine relevant studies. These predomin-
antly evaluated the Special Supplemental Nutrition Pro-
gram for Women, Infants and Children in the USA. The
review found that participants of food subsidy programs
had a 10–20% increased intake of targeted foods or nu-
trients. Two of the higher quality studies also found a
small but significant increase in mean birthweight (23 g
– 29 g). Another review by de Sa and Lock [23] exam-
ined school fruit and vegetable subsidy programmes. It
included a single relevant study which found that the
UK’s National School Fruit scheme pilot increased fruit
and
vegetable
intake
in
the
short-
and
long-term
amongst children aged 4–6 years in low-income neigh-
bourhoods who received one free piece of fruit each
school day. A review exploring the effectiveness of
interventions in reducing inequalities in obesity by
Hillier-Brown et al. [24], and contained two relevant
studies to our review. These studies from the USA
assessed the impact of a nutrition prevention interven-
tion (Food Stamp Programme) on body weight and BMI.
The studies had no intervention effect. Another review
by Olstad et al. [25] also explored the effects of policies
on socioeconomic inequalities in obesity. It contained
ten studies relevant to this umbrella review: four studies
of taxes on unhealthy foods and drink showed positive
equity effects on diet outcomes, but not weight out-
comes, whilst six studies of school free fruit or breakfast
schemes found no effects on inequalities.
Control of infectious diseases
A review by National Collaborating Centre for Women’s
and Children’s [26] (commissioned by the National Insti-
tute of Health and Clinical Excellence, NICE) reviewed
the effectiveness of interventions to reduce differences
in the uptake of immunisations in children and young
people. It included two studies of fiscal interventions tar-
geting parents and providers. For example, parents were
offered incentives in the form of maternity allowance or
childcare benefits for ensuring their child immunisations
were up to date. Therefore, there is some evidence that
incentive schemes may decrease inequalities in vaccin-
ation rates.
Primary prevention delivery mechanism 2: regulation
These interventions were concerned with making and
enforcing regulation to encourage/discourage products
and services deemed healthy/unhealthy. Fourteen re-
views of the effects on health inequalities of regulation
in the domains of tobacco (n = 3), food and nutrition
(n = 6), environment (n = 3), workplace (n = 1) and the
control of infectious diseases (n = 1) were included
and the results are summarised below and are de-
scribed in Table 2.
Tobacco
Three reviews investigated the impact of regulatory
interventions on tobacco, particularly in relation to
workplace, bars and public smoking bans, as well as restric-
tions on advertising. One review by Brown et al. [20] iden-
tified twenty-three relevant studies of regulation policies,

have smaller effects on cycle casualties with
increasing levels of social deprivation of the
area in which the collision occurred (no
evidence demonstrated on adjacent roads).
Over the period, the decline in road
casualties was greater in less deprived areas
despite the 20 mph zones causing
socioeconomic inequalities to widen over
time.

 while another review by Frazer et al. [29] identified three
relevant studies (three studies were included in both re-
views). The evidence base was mixed with the higher qual-
ity evidence tending to find negative effects on health
inequalities of national and state-wide legislation and pol-
icies that restricted smoking in workplaces and enclosed
public places – with disproportionate gains in the highest
groups/areas. Some of the lower quality studies found that
smoking bans can have positive effects on health inequal-
ities (e.g. reductions in hospital admissions, particulate
matter in bars and smoking prevalence in the most de-
prived areas and lowest educated groups). The four studies
of restrictions on tobacco and cigarette advertising and
promotion were more conclusive with equally positive ef-
fects on awareness, quit ratios, smoking behaviour, motiv-
ation to quit, compliance with legislation across SES levels.
A further review by Thomas et al. [30] included two rele-
vant studies and found no evidence of differential health ef-
fects (exposure to tobacco smoke, second-hand smoking,
cessation) by education or ethnicity of restrictions on
smoking in workplaces and public places.
Food and nutrition
In terms of food and nutrition, seven reviews investi-
gated how regulatory interventions impacted on health
inequalities. One review by Sumar and McLaren [31]
assessed the role of mandatory fortification to increase
folate intake, and included five relevant studies, which
provided mixed support for the effects of mandatory
fortification policies. Two studies found a reduction in
health inequalities by socioeconomic status or race/
ethnicity, while a further three found largely negative
effects on absolute health inequalities. Another review
by McGill et al. [32] included a study which found
that the implementation of a national salt reduction
strategy (whereby manufacturers, retailers, trade asso-
ciations and the catering sector were committed to
salt reduction) had no effect on inequalities by social
class. Hillier-Brown et al. [34] investigated the role of
regulatory interventions to control the fat content of
fast food purchases. These studies centred on the mu-
nicipal restrictions imposed by the New York City
Board of Health on the trans and saturated fat con-
tent of fast-food purchases in restaurants. At a result
of the legislation, food service establishments cannot
store or serve food that contains partially hydroge-
nated vegetable oil and has a total of more than 0.5 g
or more trans-fat per serving. In addition, the Board
of
Health
approved
a
separate
measure
requiring
some restaurants (mostly fast food outlets), to display
clearly the caloric content of each menu item on
menu boards or near cash registers. The authors

 found no difference in the mean trans-fat per pur-
chase rate by neighbourhood poverty level as a result
of the trans-fatty acid ban. Mixed results were re-
ported for mandatory calorie labelling on menus: one
study found greater decreases in calories purchased in
areas with residents of higher income and education,
while another study found no differential effect on
calories purchased by ethnicity. Another review by
Hendry et al. [35], which examined the effect of the
New York City legislation included one study that ex-
plored the effect of restricting the consumption of
trans fats between high- and low-poverty neighbour-
hoods. The study showed there was no difference in
trans-fatty acids per purchase between high-and low
poverty neighbourhoods. A further review by Olstad
et al. [25] provided analysis of a range of nutrition
policies, and included minimum standards, particu-
larly in school environments and the menu labelling
law in New York City. The results of the 19 studies
collated in this review demonstrate negative effects on
health
inequalities.
Finally,
another
review
by
Iheozor-Ejiofor [36] investigated the effects of water
fluoridation on the prevention of dental caries, and
examined the differences by area-level deprivation. It
found that fluoridation improved the percentage of
children
caries-free
and
reduced
the
number
of
decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth/surfaces
in all areas.
The environment
Regulating the environment includes measures such as
regulating traffic speeds and street design, controlling
air, water and land pollution levels. Three reviews were
included in our umbrella review; the reviews examined
roads (n = 2) and air pollution (n = 1). Two reviews in-
vestigated the role of road and street design-based inter-
ventions on casualty numbers. The first review by
Ashton et al. [37] assessed the effectiveness of traffic
calming measures on reducing unintentional injuries in
children. Only one study within this review reported on
health inequalities and found there was significant drop
in casualties in the more deprived areas, compared to
the less deprived areas. The second review by Mulvaney
et al. [38] explored how increasing the cycling infra-
structure can reduce traffic injuries amongst cyclists:
one study included in this review investigated the effects
of implementing 20 mph zones on cycle causalities by
ethnicity and social deprivation. The study found that al-
though cycle accidents fell as a result of 20 mph zones,
overall, the decline in road causalities were greater in
more affluent areas compared to more deprived areas. A
final systematic review by Benmarhnia et al. [39] explor-
ing air pollution interventions included one relevant pri-
mary study that investigated the effects of low emission
zones by neighbourhood socioeconomic status. The
study showed that, overall, low emission zones improved
air quality and had positive effects on standardised

Workplace
Workplace regulations include health and safety laws,
employment rights, as well as legislation around owner-

investigated the health effects of the mandatory privat-
isation of public utilities and industries. This review in-
cluded just one primary study that reported on health
inequality outcomes. This study, which related to the
privatisation of the UK’s water industry, found a worsen-
ing in mental health among clerical and administrative
staff, but no detrimental effects on manual workers or
managers thereby having a negative intervention effect.

Infectious diseases are subject to regulation including,
for example, mandatory immunisation. A review con-
ducted
by
the
National

for
Women’s and Children’s Health [26] included two rele-
vant studies for our umbrella review, which assessed the
effects of requiring proof of immunisation for school

proving vaccination rates in disadvantaged groups, while
the other study showed much clearer evidence of redu-
cing
inequalities
in
terms
of

rates

Primary prevention delivery mechanism 3: education
Education, communication and mass media are other
policy delivery mechanisms available to governments to
encourage/discourage products and services deemed
healthy/unhealthy. Twelve reviews were included relat-
ing to the tobacco (n = 3), food and nutrition (n = 8) and
reproductive health services (n = 1) domains. The results
are summarised below and are described in Table 3.
Tobacco
Three reviews included mass media public health educa-
tion interventions. One review by Brown et al. [20], ex-
ploring the effects of national mass-media (educational)
campaigns, included five studies relevant to our um-
brella review. These studies examined the impacts of
state, or national smoking cessation campaigns in the
USA and The Netherlands, and focused on interventions
through the television, the radio, and the internet. The
results were inconclusive: there was some evidence of
widening inequalities, and some evidence of reducing in-
equalities in terms of smoking quit rates. Another sys-
tematic review by Thomas et al. [30] identified one
study,
which
evaluated
an
education
approach
to
reducing smoking rates (health warnings on packaging).
Although the intervention was effective in reducing
smoking behaviour overall, there were no consistent
differential effects on smoking behaviour by education.
The final systematic review by Niederdeppe et al. [41]
examined the effects of media campaigns to promote
smoking cessation amongst socioeconomically disadvan-
taged populations. The two key studies in this review re-
lated to government campaigns of smoking cessation:
one of the studies showed a positive intervention effect
amongst low educated women, while the other study
had
no
effect
on
smoking
quit
rates
or
health
inequalities.
Food and nutrition
Eight systematic reviews investigated the role of mass
media and education campaigns in relation to food and
nutrition. One review by Beauchamp et al. [42] included
two studies relevant to this umbrella review: both studies
evaluated the effects of education campaigns on inequal-
ities in obesity prevention. One study showed no inter-
vention effect on inequalities in abdominal adiposity
amongst children, whilst another study showed no effect
of the intervention on the prevalence of overweight/
obesity rates amongst low SES adults, although there
was a beneficial effect among higher SES groups. Two
studies reported the impact on educational campaigns to
increase folate intake (two studies were included in both
reviews). One review by Sumar and McLaren [31] in-
cluded four relevant studies of government-sponsored
public information campaigns to increase folate intake.
Another review by Stockley and Lund [43] focused on
the role of a state-initiated education campaign concern-
ing folic acid for the prevention of birth defects. Three
studies describing one intervention) comprised adver-
tisements, commercials and posters, with an additional
local campaign targeting low SES women. The authors
documented a widening of socio-economic inequalities
in pre-conception folic acid use from the national
campaign (which persisted for 3 years), however socio-
economic differences were unaffected by the local cam-
paign. The studies showed worsening health inequality
effects in terms of folate uptake by education level, and
the prevalence of neural tube defects by ethnicity. A re-
view by McGill et al. [32] assessed the effects of public
information campaigns to promote healthy eating: one
study detailed the French ‘five a day’ health information
campaign, which the review authors concluded widened
inequalities by education. The systematic review by
Olstad et al. [25] identified one relevant study of the
UK’s ‘five a day’ campaign that showed positive effects
health inequalities in terms of diet outcomes (self-reported
fruit and vegetable purchases). A further review by
McLaren et al. [28] contained two studies that investigated
Thomson et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:869 
Page 13 of 21
 the effects of education campaigns on dietary sodium re-
duction: one study – based in Canada – showed that the
campaign increased salt intake overall; men with higher
incomes were less likely to use table salt compared to men
with lower incomes. Another study, based in the USA,
showed non-significant changes in salt intake overall,
which was reported amongst different ethnic populations.
A review by de Silva et al. [27] included one study that re-
ported on the impact of a mandatory national tooth
brushing education programme whereby 5-year-old chil-
dren were supervised daily to brush their teeth (fluoride
toothpaste was also distributed for home use). The results
of the programme reduced absolute inequalities in terms
of dental caries between the most affluent and least afflu-
ent areas. Another systematic review, conducted by Ciliska
et al. [33], detailed the effectiveness of community inter-
ventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in
children aged 4 and over. Only one state-level interven-
tion was included, this provided an evaluation of the
Expanded
Food
and
Nutrition
Education
Program
(EFNEP) – a federal community outreach program. The
intervention, which was targeted at low-income families,
was shown to increase fruit and vegetable consumption,
and therefore had a positive effect on health inequalities.
Reproductive health services
A systematic review by Black et al. [45] highlighted
how educational campaigns can be used to reduce
inequalities in reproductive cancer screening amongst
women. Two primary studies in this review found
that
interventions
targeted
toward
disadvantaged
groups
increased
screening
rates
–
particularly
amongst lower socio-economic groups.
Secondary prevention delivery mechanism 1: preventative
treatment
These interventions were concerned with increasing the
uptake of preventative health care services. Two reviews
of the effects of preventative treatment on health in-
equalities in the domain of infectious disease control
were included in our umbrella review; the results are
summarised below and are described in Table 4.
Infectious disease control
A review conducted by Crocker-Buque et al. [46] exam-
ined the effectiveness of interventions to reduce inequal-
ities in vaccine uptake in children and adolescents. Four
studies included in this review provided some evidence
of positive effects of ‘reminder and recall’ systems when
targeted at disadvantaged groups, but universal systems
had no effect on reducing inequalities in vaccine uptake
rates. An additional review by Menzies and McIntyre
[47] examined vaccine preventable diseases and vaccin-
ation policy for indigenous populations. Their review on
the impact of vaccination policies for indigenous adults and
children comprising seven studies. The review showed that
a combination of targeted and universal immunisations im-
proved health outcomes for indigenous populations; im-
provements using this approach were particularly evident
for viral diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B). However, the systematic
review concluded that universal interventions for children
appear to widen inequalities between indigenous and non-
indigenous populations for pneumococcal diseases.
Secondary prevention delivery mechanism 2: screening
Screening involves offering age-appropriate population-level
testing for certain diseases. One review showed the impact
of interventions on cancer control and prevention (n = 1);
this is summarised below, and are described in Table 5.
Reproductive health services
A review of interventions to improve attendance in sexual
cancer screening among lower socioeconomic women by
Spadea et al. [48] included five primary studies that
explored the effectiveness of screening programmes. The
studies all showed that population wide programmes in-
creased screening rates across all socio-economic groups;
there was no differential effects by SES.
Primary and secondary prevention: multiple intervention
studies
Three systematic reviews also included studies that
involved multiple types of policy mechanisms simultan-
eously. These results are summarised below and are
described in Table 6. The smoking review by Brown et al.
[20] included four studies on the effects of multiple
policies, including a combination of fiscal, regulation and
education approaches. The effects of these approaches
were generally equal across socio-economic groups, with
the exception of one primary study that found a combin-
ation of a smoking ban and two tax increases reduced
smoking in those in paid employment, but had no effect
amongst those without paid work. The food and nutrition
review by McLaren et al. [28] included two primary stud-
ies investigating the effects of education campaigns and
nutritional labelling in combination with an intervention
directed towards lowering the salt content in food
products. No statistically significant changes were noted
between socio-economic groups so the policy had a
neutral health inequalities effect. The control of infectious
diseases systematic review by Crocker-Burque et al. [46]
included five primary studies detailing a complex inter-
vention, which incorporated both education and preventa-
tive health services. The study showed some mixed
evidence by age group, however there is evidence that tar-
geted interventions were effective in encouraging child-
hood vaccination when specifically targeted at lower SES
groups of younger children (≤2 years) and especially boys.

 Discussion
Effects of public health policies on health inequalities
Twenty-nine systemic reviews were included in this um-
brella review, comprising 150 unique primary studies.
This is a large increase on the seven studies located by
Lorenc and colleagues [49] in a previous umbrella review
published in 2013. Following our framework for how the
welfare state can influence health inequalities through
public health policies, we grouped interventions in terms
of primary and secondary prevention levels; working
through five policy mechanisms (fiscal policy, regulation,
education, preventative treatment and screening) and
within eight policy domains (tobacco, alcohol, food and
nutrition, reproductive health services, the control of in-
fectious diseases, mental health, the environment and
workplace regulations). The distribution of systematic
reviews across our framework is shown in Table 7. There
was considerable heterogeneity in terms of volume of
evidence available on the different types of interventions,
between the nature of the interventions, and between
the primary studies within each of the systematic reviews
examined. As a result of these issues, and the paucity of
repeated evaluations of the same interventions, it is only
possible to make a cautious assessment of the overall ef-
fectiveness of public health policies in reducing health
inequalities. However, when examining the review as a
whole, a tentative pattern emerges and it is possible to
identify (1) public health policy interventions that are ef-
fective in reducing health inequalities; (2) those that do
not have any effect on health inequalities or where the
systematic review level evidence is unclear; and (3) those
interventions that appear to increase health inequalities.
In terms of public health policy interventions for redu-
cing health inequalities, there is evidence of effectiveness
of this welfare state approach from across all five of our
policy mechanisms: fiscal, regulatory, education, preventa-
tive treatment and screening. In terms of fiscal approaches,
this umbrella review has identified systematic review level
evidence to suggest that taxes on unhealthy food and
drinks, food subsidy programmes for low-SES women, and
fiscal incentive schemes for childhood vaccinations are
effective in reducing health inequalities – largely by
improving the health or health behaviours of the most
vulnerable. In terms of regulatory interventions, we have
identified review level evidence of the effectiveness of con-
trolling tobacco advertising, water fluoridisation, requiring
proof of immunisation for school entry (to increase vaccin-
ation rates amongst the lowest SES groups), and regulating
traffic speeds to reduce SES inequalities in child accidents
(but not cycling accidents). In terms of mass education
interventions,
a
national
tooth
brushing
education
programme was found to be effective in improving dental
hygiene amongst children from lower SES backgrounds
and a nutrition programme, targeted at low-income
families, was shown to increase fruit and vegetable
consumption. Reproductive cancer screening information
campaigns were also demonstrated to decrease health
inequalities. Concerning preventative treatment, universal
and targeted vaccinations to indigenous and disadvantaged
youth were effective in improving vaccination uptake.
In
terms
of
screening,
there
was
evidence
that
population-wide programmes increased screening rates
for reproductive cancers across all socio-economic groups.
There is also evidence though of public health policies,
whilst effective in terms of improving overall population
health have no effect on health inequalities - either from
a positive or negative viewpoint. The systematic review
level evidence synthesised in this review suggests fiscal
interventions that have no overall effect on health in-
equalities include tobacco taxes and free fruit provision
in schools. Regulatory interventions with no effect on
health inequalities include mandatory fortification to in-
crease
folate
intake;
legislative
salt
reduction;
and
trans-fat ban and calorie labelling in restaurants. Educa-
tional interventions found to have limited effect on health
inequalities included smoking cessation campaigns, health
information campaigns and the promotion of childhood
vaccinations through the media. For some policy areas,
the evidence base was small or uncertain. This included
the role of some regulation interventions – specifically
smoking bans, and the effects of the privatisation of indus-
tries on occupational health inequalities as well as some
education campaigns – specifically in regards to cam-
paigns to reduce smoking. These interventions need fur-
ther investigation to ascertain why they are positive for
overall population health, but yet are ineffective in terms
of reducing inequalities in health.
Thirdly, this umbrella review has identified a smaller
set of public health policies that systematic review level
evidence suggests could increase health inequalities –
potentially leading to so-called ‘intervention generated
inequalities’ [49]. Lowering alcohol tax by 33% was
shown to increase inequalities in mortality amongst low
SES groups in Finland. In terms of regulation policy
mechanisms, some of the environmental interventions
(20 mph zones and low emission zones) increased in-
equalities in cycle accidents and mortality between more
and less deprived neighbourhoods. Some education in-
terventions also had mixed results, specifically health
eating programmes campaigns to increase folate intake.
State of the evidence base
The review aimed to identify systematic review literature
addressing health inequalities in population-based public
health interventions. The study is robust, and compre-
hensive and the systematic reviews presented above
demonstrate the state of the research literature to date

 in this field. Compared to the volume of material investi-
gating overall health outcomes across all public health
domains, very few relevant reviews have been conducted
which examine health inequalities, with the majority of
included studies coming from reviews that looked at
general health effects and only had health inequality ef-
fects as a secondary health outcome. Whilst this may be
the result of the systematic reviews failing to report all
relevant published subgroup outcomes, it is more likely
to reflect the primary study evidence base, particularly
the failing to report by PROGRESS-PLUS. In the proto-
col, we detailed that cost-effectiveness data would be
collected, if available. Unfortunately, none of the system-
atic reviews included in this umbrella review included
data about cost-effectiveness. Therefore, whilst we have
been able to identify some potentially effective interven-
tions, the cost-effectiveness of these interventions re-
mains unclear.
Many of the primary studies were conducted in the
USA – this is in keeping with other reviews and results
from the higher number of evaluations conducted in the
USA. However, the wider welfare system in the United
States is different than other liberal regimes (e.g. the UK,
Ireland, Canada and Australia) – with lower levels of
benefits, public health regulation and health care access
[50, 51] - and also fundamentally different than the con-
servative, social democratic and Southern welfare sys-
tems operational in the rest of Europe [5]. Recognising
that the welfare system is an important contextual deter-
minant of health, we must acknowledge that the effect-
ive interventions found in this umbrella review may not
easily be transferable from one country/system context
to another [52]. For example, in the US, the Supplemen-
tal
Nutrition
Assistance
Program
(SNAP;
formally
known as the Food Stamp Program) is a federal aid pro-
gram for low-income households providing food assist-
ance. However, in the UK and other European countries,
targeted food assistance is not provided, as instead in-
come protection in the form of cash benefits (such as
Income Support or more recently Universal Credit) is
used to maintain overall income. Interventions are not
conducted in a policy vacuum but form part of a wider,
complex system [53]. Similarly, interventions from the
UK or other European countries might not be effective if
transferred in a standalone way to the US context.
There are two aspects to the quality of evidence in this
umbrella review - the quality of the included systematic
reviews and of the primary studies included therein.
Many of the systematic reviews failed to adequately de-
scribe their methods. The use of R-AMSTAR highlighted
that only four of the reviews were classed as ‘high’ qual-
ity. A third of the reviews were deemed ‘low’ in quality
having not provided sufficient detail of their methods
and/or the studies with the remaining reviews rated as
‘medium’. Future reviews should more consistently and
transparently describe their methodologies using a stan-
dardised approach, such as PRISMA [54]. In terms of
assessing the quality of the primary studies included in
the reviews, a variety of tools were utilised: some used
validated measures of quality, while others reviews did
not; further, some reviews did not report on the quality
of included studies. Many of the underpinning primary
studies were considered to be weak in quality, which ap-
peared to be largely due to the reliance on observational
study
designs.
Given
the
nature
of
state-led
population-level interventions that this review sought to
identify, the ‘gold standard’ randomised control trials
were absent, and typically repeat cross-sectional studies,
or interrupted time series were the most robust study
design which were available. The systematic review au-
thors used a variety of different criteria or toolkits to as-
sess the quality of the underlying primary studies.
Whilst some were graded ‘high’ and ‘moderate’
, the ma-
jority of studies were identified as ‘low’ in quality.
There are also some significant evidence gaps that this
umbrella review has highlighted. The majority of evi-
dence that this review presents is drawn from tobacco
and food/nutrition domains, followed by control of in-
fectious diseases. In terms of intervention types that
were the dominant, most evidence is for regulation and
education policy mechanisms. In addition, there is a
small amount of evidence for the environment, repro-
ductive health and workplace interventions. No reviews
met our criteria for mental health, and a single review
investigated the impact on health inequalities in alcohol
interventions. There was also no data presented on the
cost effectiveness of interventions. So, there are some
clear evidence gaps within the health inequality litera-
ture regarding the effects of public health policy inter-
ventions that could be explored by future research. For
example, pressing policy questions such as the effective-
ness of alcohol-related policy changes on inequalities in
alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm [55].
Further, many of the effective interventions identified
in this umbrella review were targeted ones – focusing
resource on those most at risk (e.g. the lowest SES
groups). This is one way of conceptualising health
inequalities – as the health of the most disadvantaged
(targeted approach). However, health inequalities can
also be conceptualised in terms of the gap between the
least and most disadvantaged (gap approach) or as the
entire social gradient in health – which reaches from the
bottom to the top of society (gradient approach [56]).
However, only a few studies in this review took a ‘gap’
approach and none took a ‘gradient’ approach. The wider
health inequalities literature suggests that a gradient
approach
(using
universal
interventions
–
perhaps
proportionately applied to the most in need) are likely to
Thomson et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:869 
Page 17 of 21
 be the most effective in terms of reducing health
inequalities across the whole population [57]. Targeted
interventions, by their very nature, are only able to raise
the health of those targeted, and so do little for those in
the middle of the health inequalities spectrum.
Implications for research and practice
There is ongoing interest in public health practice and
policy making environments to reduce health inequal-
ities through action on the social determinants of health.
This umbrella review has provided a synthesis of evi-
dence relating to the effectiveness of a specific welfare
state policy arena – public health policy - where policy-
makers can intervene. It has therefore overcome prob-
lems with the existing research on the effects of welfare
states on health inequalities as it goes beyond the ‘black
box’ of associational studies (that examine the social de-
terminants of health and health inequalities by welfare
state type) by looking at the effects of specific interven-
tions that could in turn be implemented into practice
[6]. This review however, also highlights the complexities
involved in developing and evaluating population-level
public health policy interventions to reduce health in-
equalities – not least in regards to the transferability of
interventions across different contexts and the fact that
interventions which might improve overall population
health are not necessarily always successful in simultan-
eously reducing health inequalities [58].
Nonetheless, some potentially promising interventions
have been identified that policymakers could consider
implementing – in the context of simultaneous evalu-
ation. This includes food subsidy programmes; taxes on
unhealthy food and drinks; fiscal incentive schemes;
proof of immunisation; control on tobacco advertising;
targeted
vaccinations;
regulating traffic
speeds; oral
health and some nutritional education programmes; and
some population and targeted screening interventions.
However, there is also some evidence from this review
and elsewhere [59, 60], that some strategies may actually
worsen inequalities: leading to so-called ‘intervention--
generated inequalities’ [49]. Our review highlights some
of these such as lowering the tax on alcohol; 20 mph
zones and low emission zones; as well as some education
interventions specifically in regards to increasing folate
intakes. Policy makers and commissioners should be
cautious in implementing such approaches until further
evaluations are conducted and the effects on health in-
equalities are more fully understood. Likewise, there are
some policies where our review suggests that the evi-
dence base is mixed, conflicting, absent or unclear. Fur-
ther research is needed in these areas in order to ensure
effective evidence based policy. The priority areas for
such future research include alcohol related policies;
mental health policies; smoking bans; calorie labelling;
and workplace regulation. Future reviews and primary
evaluations of the effects of public health policies on
health inequalities should also include cost effectiveness
data and apply suitable quality appraisal techniques.
More widely, the public health research community
should start to more thoroughly apply an equity lens to
evaluations – looking at differences in intervention ef-
fects by, for example, SES [61].
The focus for this review of systematic reviews has
been upstream, population level public health policies.
We considered all state-level interventions whether they
focused on policies instigated by central government
(e.g. raising the price of tobacco) or devolved to munici-
palities (e.g. trans-fat ban in New York City). In reality,
the distinction between policies organised centrally or
regionally has changed over time and is specific to indi-
vidual countries. For example, in the Nordic States from
the mid-1990s, municipalities have had a dual role of
both implementing national policy goals and deciding
how to prioritise their funding according to local opin-
ion [62]. In the UK however, the shift in power to local
governments came later in response to the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 which reconfigured the structure
of public health (see [63] for further details). Conse-
quently, the primary reviews that underpin the system-
atic reviews are often time and context specific. Due to
the low numbers of reviews for each of the separate do-
mains/interventions (and the large proportion of reviews
that reported mixed effects), it was not possible to ascer-
tain whether the time of publication influenced the suc-
cess of an intervention. The transferability of successful
interventions to other welfare states with differing
modes of delivery is complex also. Implementation and
enforcement would be a driver of success or otherwise,
and often the level of detail provided by the systematic
review was inadequate to ascertain the specifics of how
an intervention was executed. Going forward, future pri-
mary studies and subsequent systematic reviews should
provide clear evidence of the precise nature of interven-
tions, including details of how the intervention was de-
livered
and
whether
additional
administration
was
required to ensure compliance [64].
Strengths and limitations
There are several strengths of this umbrella review pre-
sented. We believe our methodological approach to this
umbrella review was robust: our search was broad and
wide-ranging, which included an inclusive database and
grey literature search with no details of specific interven-
tions, or health inequality terminology, which would
otherwise limit the search. In addition, no language or
date restrictions were applied to our search strategy.
Consequently, the reviews presented here, and the list of
primary studies which they report detail the health
Thomson et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:869 
Page 18 of 21
 inequality effects for the majority of the relevant studies
available at the time of our search. This review of exist-
ing systematic reviews pooled the best available review
level evidence of high-level (national and state-wide)
policy interventions (no small scale ‘policy’ interventions
e.g. single school, workplace). These are likely to repre-
sent the most effective strategies that governments have
employed to address health inequalities, and could be
used as template to improve health amongst some of the
poorest and deprived people in high-income countries.
However, there are also several limitations to our um-
brella review. We deviated from our published protocol
in two areas. Due to the larger than expected number of
hits, the review focuses only on socio-economic inequal-
ities in health not population health in general. In
addition, we used the Assessment of Multiple Systematic
Reviews (AMSTAR) [17] to conduct quality appraisal
and not GRADE [65] as described in the protocol in
keeping with best practice. Furthermore, a major limita-
tion of the final included reviews was their design, as
many did not assess the quality of the included primary
studies. Further, a high number of reviews of potentially
relevant policy interventions were excluded because they
failed to report outcomes by SES or ethnicity. We would
recommend that future primary studies should follow
guidance by PROGRESS-PLUS and report how health
outcomes for specific interventions differ by subgroup.
Many potentially relevant studies to this work were ex-
cluded on the basis of insufficient health or SES out-
come data. Like all umbrella reviews, we have only
synthesised the results of systematic reviews and the
relevant primary studies included within them. It is very
likely that in a number of policy domains, additional pri-
mary evaluations have been conducted either after the
systematic reviews have been completed, or perhaps they
did not fit the criteria for inclusion in the systematic re-
views. Furthermore, it is possible that there is publica-
tion bias (that negative results are less likely to be
published) with regards to the primary studies. Positive
intervention effects in primary studies are compounded
in systematic reviews and umbrella reviews as the pri-
mary study evidence base may be skewed. This umbrella
review is, therefore, a synthesis of the results of system-
atic reviews not a synthesis of all primary evaluations of
such interventions.
Conclusion
Understanding the role of the welfare state in reducing
health inequalities is a longstanding theme within com-
parative public health research. However, the majority of
work has examined general associations between welfare
state types and health inequalities. There has been very
little research examining the effects of specific welfare
state policies on health inequalities. This umbrella
review has sought to fill this gap by investigating how
welfare states influence the social determinants of health
inequalities institutionally through specific public health
policies – examining both primary prevention (fiscal,
regulation and education) and secondary prevention
(preventative treatment and screening) interventions.
The evidence from this review though suggests that
some public health policies – using fiscal, regulatory,
education, preventative treatment or screening mecha-
nisms - may be effective in improving health inequalities.
Key examples include: taxes on unhealthy food and
drinks; food subsidy programmes for low-income fam-
ilies; fiscal incentive schemes liked to immunisation sta-
tus;
proof
of
immunisation
for
school
admission;
tobacco advertising control measures; traffic calming
measures; oral health (water fluoridation and tooth
brushing campaign); some nutritional and cancer educa-
tion programmes; universal and targeted vaccinations
for indigenous populations; and targeted and population
screening
interventions.
However,
we
also
found
evidence of policies that were ineffective and some that
actually increased health inequalities, such as lowering
tax on alcohol; 20 mph zones and low emission zones;
as well as some education interventions specifically cam-
paigns aimed at increasing folate intakes. Therefore, our
umbrella review has found evidence that suggested thir-
teen interventions can reduce health inequalities but also
that in some cases they might increase them. As the
evidence base reviewed here is on the small side and of
varying quality, there is a need for further evaluations -
particularly
evaluations
that
undertake
sub-group
analysis by SES and which assess cost-effectiveness.
There is also a need for systematic reviews in public health
to assess the effects of interventions on health inequalities.
