Abstract
Background—Evidence suggests there are important sexual-orientation differences in alcohol 
consumption, particularly among women. Little is known about where gay/lesbian and bisexual 
college students drink or differences in patterns of alcohol use between heterosexual, gay/lesbian, 
and bisexual students. The goal of this analysis was to examine patterns of alcohol consumption—
including drinking prevalence, quantity, frequency, and contexts of use—by sexual orientation.
Methods—Data on sexual identity, gender, drinking behaviors, and drinking contexts were 
examined from repeated cross-sectional samples of undergraduate students attending 14 public 
California universities from 2003–2011 (n=58,903). Multivariable statistical techniques were 
employed to examine sexual-orientation differences stratified by gender.
Results—Gay males, lesbians, and bisexual females were significantly more likely to report 
drinking alcohol in the current semester than their same-gender heterosexual peers (relative risks 
ranged from 1.07 to 1.10, p-values<0.01). Among current drinkers, bisexual females consumed 7 
or more drinks and lesbians consumed 10 or more drinks on significantly more days than 
heterosexual females. On the other hand, gay male drinkers consumed 8 or more drinks on

 significantly fewer days than heterosexual male drinkers. Compared to their same-gender 
heterosexual peers: lesbian/gay and bisexual students drank less frequently at Greek parties 
(incidence rate ratios [IRRs] ranged from 0.52 to 0.73, p-values<0.01); lesbians (IRR=0.84, 
p=0.043) and bisexual males (IRR=0.82, p=0.009) drank less frequently at off-campus parties; and 
gay males drank more frequently outdoors (IRR=1.63, p<0.001) and at bars/restaurants 
(IRR=1.21, p=0.013).
Conclusions—Alcohol prevention programs and future research should consider sexual-
orientation differences in drinking patterns and drinking contexts.

1. INTRODUCTION
Mounting evidence suggests that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations are more 
likely to drink alcohol and engage in heavy episodic use when compared with their 
heterosexual counterparts (Blosnich et al., 2014; Burgard et al., 2005; Case et al., 2004; 
Conron et al., 2010; Corliss et al., 2008; Marshal et al., 2008; Talley et al., 2014). However, 
the findings concerning sexual-orientation drinking disparities among college students are 
inconsistent (Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2014; 
McCabe et al., 2003, 2005; Reed et al., 2010; Ridner et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2013; 
Talley et al., 2010, 2012). We know even less about whether LGB and heterosexual students 
drink in similar or different contexts (e.g., bars, Greek parties, off-campus parties). Drinking 
locations matter because they can influence the amounts of alcohol consumed (Clapp et al., 
2000; Paschall and Saltz, 2007) and risks of certain alcohol-related problems (e.g., intimate 
partner violence; Cunradi et al., 2012; Mair et al., 2013; Studer et al., 2014). Drinking 
contexts also have implications for how targeted prevention programs are designed, 
implemented, and evaluated (Wechsler and Nelson, 2008). The aims of this paper are to 
examine sexual-orientation differences in (1) drinking frequency patterns and (2) use of 
specific drinking contexts in a large, random sample of college students from many 
campuses.
Alcohol use is a major public health problem among college students. Young adults (aged 
18 to 25) have a higher prevalence of heavy episodic alcohol use compared to other age 
groups in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010; Fryar et al., 
2006; Naimi et al., 2003; Schoenborn et al., 2013; Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, 2011). Furthermore, college students have a higher prevalence of 
alcohol use and heavy episodic use than their non-college-attending counterparts (Slutske, 
2005). Heavy alcohol use has myriad short-term consequences, such as unintentional 
injuries, violence, alcohol poisoning, and sexually transmitted infections, and deleterious 
long-term effects, including cancers and neurological problems (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2014). As a result, alcohol use is the cause of approximately 100,000 deaths 
per year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of preventable death 
(Mokdad et al., 2004).

 Sexual-minority college students (i.e., those who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) may 
exhibit riskier drinking patterns than heterosexual students. Importantly, sexual-orientation 
differences often vary by gender, with larger differences found among sexual-minority 
women compared to heterosexual women than differences among sexual-minority men 
compared to heterosexual men (Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; 
Kerr et al., 2014; McCabe et al., 2003, 2005; Ridner et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2013; Talley 
et al., 2012). Specifically, several studies have shown that lesbians have a higher prevalence 
of alcohol use and are more likely to engage in heavy episodic use than heterosexual females 
(Ridner et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2013; Talley et al., 2010), and there is some evidence 
that bisexual and “mostly heterosexual” females are also at substantially elevated risk 
(Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; Kerr et al., 2014; McCabe et al., 2005; Talley et al., 2010, 
2012). Contrastingly, other studies have reported no differences in alcohol consumption by 
sexual orientation among female college students (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; McCabe et 
al., 2003; Reed et al., 2010; Talley et al., 2012). For male college students, who generally 
drink greater volumes of alcohol than their female peers (American College Health 
Association, 2014; Ham and Hope, 2003; O’Malley and Johnston, 2002; Pedersen, 2013), 
many studies have found no differences in the prevalence of alcohol use or heavy episodic 
use by sexual orientation (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; McCabe et al., 2005; Reed et al., 
2010; Ridner et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2013; Talley et al., 2010, 2012); however, one 
cross-sectional study has reported that gay and bisexual men had higher prevalence of 
drinking (Kerr et al., 2014). Though two prospective studies have found that gay and 
bisexual males were more likely to report heavy episodic use and drinking to intoxication 
(Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Talley et al., 2010), other studies have found less heavy 
episodic use among gay (McCabe et al., 2003) and bisexual men (Eisenberg and Wechsler, 
2003; McCabe et al., 2003; McCabe et al., 2005) than heterosexual men.
There are likely multiple reasons for these divergent findings. First, many previous studies 
sampled populations from a single institution (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Reed et al., 2010; 
Ridner et al., 2006; Talley et al., 2010, 2012), and alcohol use is shown to vary widely by 
campus (Wechsler et al., 1994). Second, sexual orientation has been measured using a 
variety of constructs (i.e., sexual identity, attraction, or behavior), which have been shown to 
produce varied results (McCabe et al., 2005, 2012). Third, several studies have aggregated 
same-gender lesbian/gay and bisexual people into a single category (Hatzenbuehler et al., 
2008; McCabe et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2010; Ridner et al., 2006; Talley et al., 2012), which 
may hide important subgroup differences. In spite of the diverse methodologies and 
findings, there is enough evidence to suggest that important sexual-orientation differences in 
alcohol consumption exist, particularly among women.
Previous studies about sexual-orientation differences in alcohol use often employed 
quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; McCabe 
et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2010; Talley et al., 2010, 2012) or a single-item measure about 
heavy episodic use (Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; McCabe et al., 2005; Reed et al., 2010; 
Schauer et al., 2013; Talley et al., 2010). While these measures are informative about 
average consumption and heavy episodic alcohol use, graduated frequency measures provide 
more specific information about drinking patterns and are able to illustrate the wide range of 
drinking behaviors of populations (Gmel and Rehm, 2004; Gruenewald and Nephew, 1994).

 For example, graduated frequency measures can examine the number of days in which 
people consumed specific quantities of alcohol, providing rich descriptions of drinking 
patterns.
Colleges have been successful in developing, implementing, and evaluating targeted 
drinking prevention programs with specific high-risk student populations (e.g., Greek 
fraternity/sorority members; Toomey et al., 2007; Toomey and Wagenaar, 2002; Turrisi et 
al., 2006), but, to our knowledge, there are no effective drinking interventions that 
specifically target LGB college students. One reason for this may be that we know little 
about where LGB college students are drinking. A previous study showed that gay men and 
LGB women drank more frequently at bars, and LGB women also drank more frequently at 
parties than heterosexual people (Trocki et al., 2005). However, this study was conducted 
with a probability sample of adults, and no studies to our knowledge have investigated 
differences specific to college students and college drinking environments. Knowing if there 
are sexual-orientation differences in use of certain drinking environments might assist 
interventionists in directing interventions to specific populations and contexts.
To extend the knowledge about sexual-orientation differences in drinking among college 
students, we analyzed data from random cross-sectional samples of undergraduate students 
from 14 University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses 
collected over a 9-year period. The aims of this study were to: (1) examine the prevalence of 
alcohol use by sexual orientation; (2) among drinkers, investigate the relative sexual-
orientation differences in the number of days in which specific quantities of alcohol were 
consumed using graduated frequency measures of alcohol consumption; and (3) examine 
sexual-orientation differences in the settings where college students drank. Our analyses 
investigated sexual-orientation subgroup differences by examining self-identified 
heterosexuals, gays/lesbians, and bisexuals separately, and were stratified by gender because 
previous research showed that sexual-orientation differences in alcohol use varied by gender 
(Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2014; McCabe et al., 
2003, 2005; O’Malley and Johnston, 2002; Ridner et al., 2006; Schauer et al., 2013; Talley 
et al., 2012).
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Design
Serial cross-sectional data were collected from random samples of undergraduate students at 
14 UC and CSU campuses annually in the fall semester from 2003 through 2011. Data were 
collected to assess the effectiveness of environmental alcohol prevention interventions using 
a randomized controlled trial design (Saltz et al., 2010). Interventions were implemented in 
seven campuses in 2005–2006 and the remaining seven campuses in 2008. The purpose of 
the current investigation was not to evaluate intervention effects, but to examine sexual-
orientation differences in drinking patterns and use of drinking contexts; thus, we adjusted 
for intervention effects in all analyses. The intervention is described elsewhere (Saltz et al., 
2010)—but campuses implemented interventions in specific years, thus we dichotomously 
coded for presence/absence of intervention for each campus and year. Original study 
procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the [blinded].

 There were 60,898 participants who completed the survey 10.8 weeks, on average, into their 
semester. Response rates ranged from 50% in 2003 to 39% in 2008. Since these were less 
than optimal, post-hoc sample weights correcting for gender, ethnic group, age, and grade 
distributions by campus were developed to adjust for differences in non-response. In total, 
only 3.3% of participants were missing data on sociodemographic characteristics or alcohol 
use, making a total analytic sample of 58,903 students.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Sociodemographic characteristics—We selected sociodemographic 
characteristics associated with sexual orientation, drinking behaviors, and/or contexts of use 
in previous studies (Saltz et al., 2010; Wechsler et al., 1995), as they may confound the 
relationships we planned to examine. Gender was reported as male or female, and sexual 
orientation was measured with the following question: “Which of the following best 
describes your sexual orientation?” Response options were heterosexual, lesbian/gay, and 
bisexual. Henceforth, females who selected “lesbian/gay” are referred to as “lesbian”, and 
males who selected “lesbian/gay” are referred to as “gay.” Participants also reported their 
age (treated here as less than 21 years and greater than or equal to 21 years); class 
(freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and not seeking a degree or “other”); race/ethnicity 
(treated here as White, Latino, Asian, Black, or other); Greek sorority/fraternity membership 
(yes/no); employment status (full- or part-time vs. none); and whether they had a vehicle at 
school (yes/no).
2.2.2. Alcohol use—Participants were first asked about their alcohol use in the past year. 
Participants who drank at least monthly were asked about their drinking behaviors in the 
past 28 days, and participants who drank in the past year but less than monthly were asked 
about their drinking behaviors in the time period between the start of the current semester 
and the time they completed the survey. Participants who reported consuming at least one 
drink in the current semester were classified as current drinkers.
Using a graduated frequency scale, current drinkers were asked to report the number of 
occasions on which they had consumed 1 or more, 2 or more, 3 or more, 6 or more, and 9 or 
more drinks. Participants’ responses were scaled to a 28-day equivalent metric. An 
estimated continued drinking function for each respondent was fit and used to obtain a 
drinking probability distribution (for details, see Gruenewald et al., 2003; Gruenewald and 
Nephew, 1994). This probability distribution was used to estimate the proportion of 
occasions on which respondents drank exactly 1, 2, 3, etc. drinks. The number of occasions 
on which drinking at each level was expected to occur was calculated by multiplying these 
proportions by the frequency of drinking for each individual. Thus, for every student and 
drinking level, a specific rate of drinking was available (Gruenewald et al., 2003).
2.2.3. Drinking contexts—Participants were asked how many times in the current 
semester they drank alcohol in 6 different campus contexts: Greek fraternity/sorority parties; 
residence hall parties; on-campus events (e.g., sporting events); off-campus parties (e.g., 
house parties); bars/restaurants; and outdoor settings (e.g., parks).

 2.3. Data Analyses
We conducted our analyses using Stata version 13 (College Station, TX). We described the 
characteristics of the total sample with percentages and chi-square tests to examine if there 
were differences by sexual orientation. To test if there were statistical differences in current 
drinking status after adjusting for sociodemographics, campus, survey year, and 
intervention, we used the modified Poisson regression approach to estimate risk ratios for 
lesbian/gay and bisexual students vs. heterosexual students, stratified by gender (Zou, 2004). 
All multivariable analyses in this study were stratified by gender because of previous 
research showing alcohol use differences by gender and sexual orientation (e.g., McCabe et 
al., 2005).
To investigate our second and third study aims, we restricted subsequent analyses to 
participants who reported past-semester drinking. Because data were overdispersed 
according to the likelihood-ratio test of alpha=0 (p-values<0.05 for all models) and zero was 
not an option, we used zero-truncated negative binomial regression models to test if average 
frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption among drinkers differed by sexual 
orientation, adjusting for sociodemographics, campus, survey year, and intervention 
condition. To test for differences by sexual orientation in the number of days in which 
specific volumes of alcohol were consumed, we used negative binomial regression models.
To examine sexual-orientation differences in use of drinking contexts, we used negative 
binomial models because data were overdispersed according to the likelihood-ratio test of 
alpha=0 (p-values<0.05 for all models). We adjusted for sociodemographics, campus, 
survey year, intervention condition, and the number of days students consumed alcohol (i.e., 
exposure).
3. RESULTS
Among females, 1.0% identified as lesbian, 3.2% as bisexual, and 95.8% as heterosexual 
(data not shown); among males, 2.9% identified as gay, 1.7% as bisexual, and 95.5% as 
heterosexual (data not shown). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of the 
sample, and sexual-orientation differences in these characteristics.
3.1. Prevalence of current alcohol use
Table 2 shows the overall prevalence and multivariable risk ratios of current alcohol use by 
sexual orientation. Among females, lesbians and bisexuals were more likely to be current 
drinkers than their heterosexual counterparts. Among males, gays were more likely to be 
current drinkers than their heterosexual counterparts.
3.2. Average frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption
Table 2 also shows the average past 28 day frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption 
among current drinkers. Among female drinkers, bisexuals used alcohol on a greater number 
of days than their heterosexual counterparts. There were no differences in the average 
number of drinking days between lesbian and heterosexual female drinkers. There were no

 differences in average quantity of consumption for lesbian and bisexual females compared 
to heterosexual females.
Among male drinkers, gays had a lower average quantity of alcohol consumption than 
heterosexuals, but there were no differences in their average frequency of alcohol 
consumption. Bisexual and heterosexual males had similar average frequency and quantity 
of alcohol consumption.
3.3. Frequency of Consuming Specific Alcohol Quantities
Figure 1 shows the incidence rate ratios for the frequency of consuming quantities of alcohol 
in an average 28-day period. Compared to heterosexual female drinkers, bisexual females 
more frequently consumed four or fewer drinks per occasion and seven or more drinks per 
occasion. Lesbians were significantly more likely than heterosexual female drinkers to 
consume two drinks per occasion and ten or more drinks per occasion, yet were less likely to 
consume four and six drinks per occasion.
Compared to heterosexual male drinkers, gay men less frequently consumed eight or more 
drinks per occasion. Gay males also less frequently had four drinks per occasion than 
heterosexual males. Bisexual and heterosexual males consumed specific quantities of 
alcohol at similar rates.
3.4. Drinking Contexts
Table 3 shows the differences in drinking contexts by sexual orientation and stratified by 
gender. Multivariable models show that, compared to heterosexual female drinkers, lesbians 
and bisexual females drank less often at Greek parties, lesbians drank less often at off-
campus parties, and bisexual females drank less often at bars/restaurants.
Among male drinkers, gay and bisexuals drank less often at Greek parties than heterosexual 
males. Gay males drank more frequently than heterosexual males at bars/restaurants and 
outdoor settings. Compared to heterosexuals, bisexual males drank less often at off-campus 
parties, but more frequently at on-campus events.
4. DISCUSSION
4.1 Sexual-Orientation Differences in Drinking
We found distinct sexual-orientation differences in both prevalence of drinking and 
frequency of consuming specific alcohol quantities among college students. Importantly, 
these differences vary by gender, as shown in previous studies (e.g., McCabe et al., 2005). 
For females, our results show that lesbian and bisexual college students are more likely to be 
current drinkers than their heterosexual peers. We found that, among drinkers, drinking 
pattern differences are bimodal in character for bisexuals compared to heterosexual females: 
bisexual females more frequently drink at low levels (four or fewer drinks) and high levels 
(seven or more drinks) than heterosexual females. On the other hand, lesbian drinkers more 
frequently consume 10 or more drinks than heterosexual female drinkers. Previous studies 
found lesbian and bisexual female college student drinkers to be at higher risk for 
consuming four or more drinks (Eisenberg and Wechsler, 2003; McCabe et al., 2005; 
Coulter et al.

 Schauer et al., 2013), but our findings show lesbian and bisexual female drinkers consumed 
10 or greater drinks more frequently than their heterosexual counterparts. These disparities 
display how critical it is to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions aimed at 
reducing heavy drinking among lesbian and bisexual females.
Our study also elucidated sexual-orientation differences in alcohol consumption among 
males. We found that gay males are more likely to be current drinkers than their 
heterosexual counterparts. However, among current drinkers, gay males are less likely to 
consume alcohol at high levels than heterosexual males (eight or more drinks). Meanwhile, 
drinking patterns are similar for heterosexual and bisexual males. Though sexual-orientation 
disparities in alcohol use are smaller for males than females, it is well established that larger 
proportions of male than female college students drink heavily (American College Health 
Association, 2014; Ham and Hope, 2003; O’Malley and Johnston, 2002; Pedersen, 2013). 
Drinking among male college students is a great public health problem, and it is critical that 
college drinking interventions aim to reduce gay and bisexual males’ heavy drinking just as 
much as heterosexual males’ drinking.
Prior studies found divergent results on sexual-orientation disparities in alcohol use among 
college students (see Section 1 for a review). Thus, our study’s findings are aligned with 
some, but not all results from previous investigations. Our study used graduated frequency 
measures of alcohol consumption, thereby prohibiting strict comparisons to previous studies, 
as this is a new approach in the sexual-orientation disparities literature. Our study design 
was particularly strong because we were able to disaggregate LGB people into specific 
subgroups, and data were collected from random samples of undergraduate students at 14 
public universities.
Sexual-orientation differences in alcohol use are often explained by minority stress theory 
(Meyer, 2003), which posits that LGB people are at greater risk of experiencing 
discrimination, victimization, and stress than heterosexuals, thereby negatively impacting 
LGB wellbeing and making them more apt to drink alcohol to cope (Keyes et al., 2011). 
Empirical evidence of this is common in the literature (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, 2009). Gender 
expression also contributes to sexual-orientation drinking differences. For example, LGB 
women are more masculine than heterosexual women on average (but not always; e.g., 
Rieger and Savin-Williams, 2012), and because heavy drinking is more common among 
men than women (e.g., Pedersen, 2013), drinking is sometimes deemed a more masculine 
behavior—and therefore LGB women may more frequently consume 10+ drinks. A previous 
study (Rosario et al., 2008) showed that more frequent and heavier drinking is found among 
butch versus femme (i.e., more masculine versus more feminine) LGB women, empirically 
showing that gender expression contributes to drinking differences.
4.2 Sexual-Orientation Differences in Use of Contexts
Our study also examined differences in drinking settings by sexual orientation. Specifically, 
LGB males and females are less likely to drink at Greek parties than their heterosexual 
counterparts. Gay males drink more frequently at bars/restaurants, while bisexual females 
drink less often at bars/restaurants than their same-gender heterosexual peers. Lesbians and 
bisexual males drink less often at off-campus parties, gay males drink more frequently

 outdoors, and bisexual males drink more often at on-campus events. While we controlled for 
campus in our analyses, it is important to remember that each individual campus’ built 
environment is unique and influences where students drink—and may also affect sexual-
orientation differences in use of drinking contexts.
Sexual-orientation differences in use of drinking contexts may be best understood in relation 
to niche theory and assortative drinking (Gruenewald, 2007; Gruenewald et al., 2014). Niche 
theory suggests that drinking contexts attract people with specific characteristics. For 
example, Greek parties may be more likely to attract heterosexual students because these 
venues have historically been places for people to meet potential opposite-gender partners. 
Assortative drinking suggests that drinkers return to specific drinking settings because they 
can find people like themselves. LGB people may not see people like themselves at Greek 
parties or may not even be welcome to attend such events, and are therefore less likely to 
attend in the future. Because fraternities and sororities are historically heterosexist (Garrett, 
2002; Hesp and Brooks, 2009), it is not surprising that LGB populations frequent these 
venues less often than heterosexuals.
On the other hand, “gay bars” (or places catering to sexual-minority people) are more likely 
to attract LGB people, and thus LGB people may return to these bars for future drinking 
occasions; this may explain why gay males more frequently attended bars/restaurants in our 
study, which aligns with another study investigating sexual-orientation differences in 
contexts among adults (Trocki et al., 2005). The previous study showed that LGB females 
more frequently drank at bars, which is not what we found. This difference may be 
explained by different study populations (i.e., college students vs. adults in general). 
Additional details about why off-campus parties might be less appealing and drinking 
outdoors might be more appealing to certain LGB subgroups may best be answered through 
future investigations using qualitative methods.
4.3 Intervention and Research Implications
Our study highlights that LGB populations, especially LGB women, should be priority 
populations for drinking interventions. But compared with heterosexuals, LGB populations 
less frequently attend Greek parties—which are contexts with the highest frequency of risky 
drinking among college students (Glindemann and Geller, 2003; Park et al., 2009) and are 
commonly targeted contexts for drinking interventions (Toomey et al., 2007; Toomey and 
Wagenaar, 2002; Turrisi et al., 2006). Furthermore, LGB students are less likely to be 
members of Greek fraternities and sororities. Therefore, interventions aimed at reducing 
heavy drinking within the Greek system may not adequately reach LGB college students, 
leaving sexual-orientation drinking disparities untouched at best. Despite attending Greek 
parties less frequently, LGB women still consume 10 or more drinks more frequently than 
heterosexual females—so the question remains: in which contexts are LGB women 
engaging in heavy drinking? While our study does not specifically answer this question, 
future research among college students can investigate sexual-orientation differences in 
consumption patterns by drinking contexts—and this will provide interventionists with more 
information about which drinking contexts would be best to target to lower sexual-
orientation drinking disparities.

 Future research can also utilize a framework that focuses on context-specific risk and 
protective factors. There may be context-specific reasons for (and consequences of) heavy 
drinking (Cunradi et al., 2012; Jones-Webb et al., 2013; Levitt and Cooper, 2010; Mair et 
al., 2013; Neighbors et al., 2006; Zamboanga and Ham, 2008)—but no studies to our 
knowledge have investigated how these may differ by sexual orientation. Considering 
minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) within a contextual perspective, we can see that some 
minority stressors (e.g., internalized homophobia/biphobia) and related processes (e.g., 
expectations of rejection, social norms) may be more prevalent and potent in certain settings, 
thereby influencing alcohol use within certain contexts for LGB populations. Adopting this 
perspective may provide fruitful insights into observed patterns about where and how much 
LGB populations drink—and may be applicable to other areas of health heightened among 
LGB students, like mental health problems and use of other drugs (Kerr et al., 2014; Oswalt 
and Wyatt, 2011).
4.4 Limitations
Despite our study’s strengths, it is not without limitations. Our results may not be 
generalizable to college campuses throughout the nation; however, the probability sampling 
method used in 14 college campuses was rigorous. We were also unable to explore effect 
modification by race/ethnicity due to small sample sizes. There may also be social 
desirability bias, but likely none more than is present in other studies of self-reported alcohol 
use. Finally, data for this study are cross-sectional in nature. Thus, longitudinal intra-
individual changes in drinking patterns and settings cannot be assessed in this study.
4.5. Conclusions
Our study highlights the necessity of interventions to be tailored specifically for LGB 
college students, especially given that, to our knowledge, no effective drinking interventions 
have carefully considered these populations. Because some alcohol-related problems (e.g., 
sexual assault and considering suicide after drinking) are higher for LGB college drinkers 
than heterosexuals (Kerr et al., 2014), interventions that reduce alcohol consumption among 
LGB people may have robust effects that last beyond the college years. College health 
professionals, administrators, and researchers should carefully consider sexual-orientation 
differences in drinking patterns and settings while designing, implementing, and evaluating 
interventions.

Note. sd = standard deviation; ref = referent. For adjusted models, boldface indicates statistically significant findings (p < 0.05). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are adjusted 
for race/ethnicity, age, class, fraternity/sorority membership, employment status, vehicle on campus, campus, survey year, and intervention condition. Adjusted models also adjust for the number of days 
each participant consumed alcohol (i.e., the exposure period). There were no key differences by sexual orientation between those missing and not missing data on drinking in each setting.
