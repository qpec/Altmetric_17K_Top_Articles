Abstract
Amyloid-β (Aβ) is a peptide deposited in the brain parenchyma in Alzheimer’s disease and in cerebral blood vessels, causing 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Aβ pathology is transmissible experimentally in animals and through medical procedures 
in humans, such as contaminated growth hormone or dura mater transplantation in the context of iatrogenic prion disease. 
Here, we present four patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures during childhood or teenage years and presented 
with intracerebral haemorrhage approximately three decades later, caused by severe CAA. None of these patients carried 
pathogenic mutations associated with early Aβ pathology development. In addition, we identified in the literature four patients 
with a history of neurosurgical intervention and subsequent development of CAA. These findings raise the possibility that 
Aβ pathology may be transmissible, as prion disease is, through neurosurgical procedures.

Introduction
Prions, the causative agent of prion diseases, are infectious 
pathogens of humans and animals which are thought to com-
prise of stable, misfolded and multimeric forms of a normal 
protein. The paradigm for transmissible human neurode-
generative diseases is the acquired prion disease, such as 
iatrogenic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (iCJD), as a result of 
prion-contaminated medical procedures, kuru, in the context 
of ritual cannibalism, or variant CJD due to dietary expo-
sure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions [10]. The 
experimental seeding of amyloid-β (Aβ), the most common 
misfolded protein in the ageing brain, has been demonstrated 
in animal models [1, 17, 26].
Recently, we found Aβ in the parenchyma and blood 
vessel walls in the brains of young patients who had died 
of iCJD after treatment with cadaveric human pituitary-
derived growth hormone (c-hGH) [22]. Subsequently this 
was confirmed by Ritchie et al. [40], and Cali et al. [7] in 
c-hGH-treated patients with iCJD and those who did not 
develop iCJD [40]. The source of the transmitted Aβ was

demonstrated by Duyckaerts et al. [13] in batches of growth 
hormone extracted from pituitary glands which were used 
for the treatment. Furthermore, significant parenchymal and 
vascular Aβ pathology has been demonstrated in dura mater 
grafting-associated iCJD patients [7, 18, 20, 28]. These stud-
ies suggest that some aspects of Aβ pathology may be trans-
missible in certain circumstances. Proteopathic seeding is a 
useful term to describe these phenomena as it distinguishes 
these experimental and pathological case observations from 
the transmission of a fatal neurodegenerative disorder as 
occurs in prion diseases. Another well-known mode of iat-
rogenic prion disease transmission is through contaminated 
neurosurgical instruments [4, 11, 19], which raises the ques-
tion whether Aβ proteopathic seeds may also be transmitted 
via this route.
To investigate this possibility, we asked if Aβ pathology 
occurs in young patients with a past medical history of neu-
rosurgical intervention, and without predisposing genetic 
risk factors. We searched the pathology archive at our hospi-
tal to identify those with pathologically confirmed parenchy-
mal and/or vascular Aβ pathology. In addition, we searched 
the literature for reported young-onset CAA patients. The 
search in our archive identified three patients in their thirties 
and one patient in her fifties, who presented with cerebral 
amyloid-β angiopathy (Aβ-CAA, in short CAA)-related 
intracerebral haemorrhages. Four patients were identified 
from a literature search. Case reports of males in their thir-
ties and forties presenting with spontaneous brain haemor-
rhages had suggested that the cause of the underlying CAA 
was male gender and childhood head trauma. Instead, we 
show here that young-onset CAA is not restricted to male 
patients with head trauma; rather, we found all cases had a 
history of neurosurgery during childhood. We demonstrate 
that similar Aβ pathology is not seen in neurosurgical biop-
sies of age-matched patients who were treated for various 
vascular and developmental cortical malformations, and a 
history of childhood neurosurgery is unusual. We discuss the 
lack of robust neuropathological evidence of a causal asso-
ciation between a single episode of head trauma and CAA, 
and raise the possibility that Aβ proteopathic seeds, similar 
to prions, may be transmissible through surgical instruments.
Materials and methods
Case selection and literature search
Informed consent to use the tissue for research was obtained 
in all cases. Ethical approval for these studies was obtained 
from the Local Research Ethics Committee of the UCL 
Institute of Neurology/National Hospital for Neurology and 
Neurosurgery.
We searched the local pathology archive at our hos-
pital, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neuro-
surgery (NHNN), from January 2002 to March 2016 for 
pathologically confirmed parenchymal and/or vascular Aβ 
pathology on biopsy material. These diagnostic biopsies 
were obtained during evacuation of intracerebral haema-
toma or to investigate cognitive decline. Two biopsies 
were referred from other hospitals. We also searched our 
pathology archive from January 2007 to December 2017 
for pathologically confirmed vascular Aβ pathology on 
autopsy material. Patients with pathologically confirmed 
prion disease were excluded from this search as many of 
these patients have been reported previously [22]. The lit-
erature search for young-onset cerebral amyloid angiopa-
thy cases was performed in PubMed (Keywords “young 
onset” “young”, “early onset” or “early”, “cerebral amy-
loid angiopathy”, or “CAA”) and subsequent literature was 
identified from the list of references in these case reports.
As CAA occurs sporadically in individuals above the 
age of 55 years [27], we studied biopsy samples with Aβ 
pathology from patients aged 55 and younger.
To investigate whether the history of childhood neuro-
surgery in our CAA cases was exceptional, we established 
a control group of 50 consecutive age-matched patients 
who underwent brain biopsy for vascular or developmental 
malformations at our hospital (search term “malforma-
tion”, date of birth cohort: 1967–1987). In this control 
group we reviewed the past medical histories and looked 
for evidence of CAA in brain samples (Supplementary 
Table 2). Of these 50 cases, 24 were females and 26 were 
males. The mean age was 34 and median age 32 (range 
24–47). These cases were selected to specifically test 
whether (1) CAA and childhood neurosurgery are associ-
ated (our hypothesis), (2) having a brain biopsy in middle 
age is associated with childhood neurosurgery (alternative 
hypothesis), or (3) there is no association at all.
Neuropathological examination
CAA was classified according to the location of the 
affected vessels (leptomeninges or parenchyma), size 
(arteries/arterioles and capillaries), extent, and presence of 
associated vasculopathies [31, 48]. Parenchymal Aβ (dif-
fuse deposits and deposits with central amyloid cores) and 
tau pathology (neurofibrillary tangles, threads and neuritic 
plaques, i.e., Aβ plaques with a dense peripheral rim of tau 
positive neuropil threads) were scored semi-quantitatively. 
The topographical distribution of parenchymal Aβ in case 
4 was assessed according to Thal [45]. The CERAD score 
was based on neuritic plaque density [34]. Neurofibrillary 
tangle tau pathology was staged according to Braak and 
Braak [6].

Immunohistochemistry
Aβ, hyperphosphorylated tau and macrophages were 
detected on paraffin tissue sections with antibody 6F3D 
(DAKO, 1:50), AT8, (Invitrogen MN1020, 1:100) and 
CD68 (DAKO PG-M1, 1:100), respectively, on a ROCHE 
Ventana Discovery automated staining platform following 
the manufacturer’s guidelines, using biotinylated secondary 
antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated strepta-
vidin complex and diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. All 
immunostainings were carried with appropriate controls.
Clinical history and genetic testing for risk factors
Past medical history of previous surgical intervention was 
identified from the clinical notes. The genetic data were 
sought for mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 genes in Case 
1 and Case 2. Next generation sequencing analysis of a 
panel of 17 genes involved in different forms of dementia 
[2], including APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 genes was carried out 
on patients reported as Case 3 and Case 4. APOE polymor-
phism was determined in all four patients.
Results
In our neuropathology archive, we identified 37 patients 
operated between 2002 and 2016, aged 31–90 years, with 
neuropathologically confirmed CAA. Of these, five were 
younger than 55 years (Fig. 1). Review of the clinical notes 
showed a pathogenic mutation in the PSEN1 gene in one of 
the patients and no clinical information could be obtained 
from another patient. The remaining three archival cases 
included two patients referred to us from Portugal and Bel-
gium. All three patients had a neurosurgical intervention 
during childhood. Whilst it is established that for one of 
the patients [case 1, (#1)] no dural graft was used during 
surgery, it is not known if dural grafts were used in the other 
three patients or blood transfusions had been administered. 
One patient’s neurosurgery took place in a centre with com-
bined paediatric and adult service, whilst for the other two 
patients this information could not be obtained. None of 
these patients had a family history of stroke or dementia, and 
none had any pathogenic mutation in the APP, PSEN1 and 
PSEN2 genes to explain early Aβ pathology. A fourth patient 
was identified in the autopsy cohort. Review of the pathol-
ogy notes of all patients who had undergone brain autopsy 
at our hospital between 2007 and 2017 revealed 45 patients 
with CAA, one of whom was 57 years old and all others 
were 63–96 years old. The youngest (57 years old) patient 
(case 4, (#4) had died from the complications of a large 
intracerebral haemorrhage with severe widespread CAA 
confirmed at autopsy. Despite a family history of stroke in 
this patient, genetic studies did not reveal any pathogenic 
mutations in the APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2 genes.
Below are the descriptions of clinical details and the 
APOE status of these four patients. The case ID numbers 
(#) correspond to those in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1:
Case 1 (#1)
This 39-year-old cognitively intact Portuguese female 
suffered a severe brain injury at the age of one, requiring 
multiple cranioplasties at age of three (titanium allograft), 
seven (platinum allograft) and eight (autograft with iliac 
bone). Three decades later, at the age of 33, she suffered 
from her first spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. At the 
age of 39, she presented with a second brain haemorrhage 
which prompted a diagnostic brain biopsy. In the following 
2 months, she suffered further multiple spontaneous bleeds 
and died soon after. During lifetime, the patient had been 
extensively investigated, including cerebral angiography 
on two occasions. Histology of the brain biopsy revealed 
widespread, severe CAA affecting leptomeningeal and corti-
cal blood vessels, including frequent capillaries in the brain 
parenchyma, occasional diffuse parenchymal Aβ deposits

and rare plaques with central Aβ cores, but no neuritic 
plaques (CERAD score 0) and no neurofibrillary tangles 
(Fig. 3). The APOE genotype was ε3/ε4.
Case 2 (#2)
A 31-year-old cognitively intact Belgian male was operated 
at the age of one on a brain tumour, reportedly a meningi-
oma. At the age of 11, he was involved in an accident requir-
ing intra-abdominal surgery to stop a liver haemorrhage, 
but no head injury or post-operative neurological complica-
tions were reported. The patient presented at the age of 31 
with an acute spontaneous parieto-occipital haemorrhage 
for which he underwent emergency haematoma evacuation 
and a diagnostic biopsy of surrounding leptomeninges and 
brain parenchyma. The bleed had developed within and 
around the resection cavity of the brain tumour. Histology 
revealed widespread leptomeningeal and parenchymal CAA 
of moderate severity with no capillary involvement and no 
parenchymal Aβ deposits (CERAD score 0) (Fig. 3). There 
was no tau pathology. Further, PiB-PET imaging revealed 
abnormal signal consistent with deposition of fibrillar Aβ 
throughout the brain. The APOE genotype was ε2/ε3.
Case 3 (#3)
This 37-year-old British female was born with an 
Arnold–Chiari malformation, spina bifida and hydrocepha-
lus for which she underwent laminectomy of the cervical 
spine, repair of a spinal myelomeningocele and ventricular 
shunting in the first year of life. She presented at the age 
of 36 with spontaneous left frontal haemorrhage followed 
by a further bleed in the right frontal lobe several months 
later, prompting a diagnostic right frontal brain biopsy. In 
the following months, she had intracerebral haemorrhages at 
multiple sites, which led to her death at the age of 37. His-
tology of the brain biopsy showed widespread leptomenin-
geal and parenchymal CAA of moderate severity, frequent 
diffuse parenchymal Aβ deposits and several plaques with 
central amyloid cores. There was no capillary deposition 
of Aβ (Fig. 3). Tau pathology was restricted to occasional 
neuropil threads, but no neuritic plaques (CERAD score 0) 
or neurofibrillary tangles. The APOE genotype was ε3/ε4. 
Next generation sequencing of a panel of 17 genes associ-
ated with different forms of dementia revealed a TREM2 
R62H variant, a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but no 
other alterations.
Case 4 (#4)
This 57-year-old British female was diagnosed with syrin-
gomyelia at age of 17 for which she underwent neurosur-
gery at age of 20. Subsequently at the age of 40, the patient 
was also diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation 
involving the right insular region, which was initially 
treated with radiosurgery followed by intravascular coil-
ing 2 years later. The patient presented acutely with a large 
intracerebral haemorrhage, centred in the left thalamus, 
but also involving the ventricles, and she died soon after. 
Post-mortem examination of the brain revealed widespread 
severe leptomeningeal and parenchymal CAA as the 
underlying cause of the haemorrhage. There were multiple 
additional micro-infarcts and micro-haemorrhages across 
the brain and there was focal leptomeningeal CAA-related

Fig. 3  CAA in biopsy and autopsy tissue of the four patients from our 
cohort. The cortex in case 1 (a, a1) shows widespread CAA, includ-
ing capillary involvement (blue arrows in a1) and occasional diffuse 
parenchymal deposits (red arrow in a1). In case 2 (b, b1), there is 
CAA in leptomeninges and cortex but no diffuse Aβ. In case 3 (c, c1), 
there are in addition frequent diffuse parenchymal deposits (red arrow 
in c1). The autopsy case (Patient 4, d, d1–d8) shows widespread 
CAA in the cerebral leptomeninges and neocortex (d) and focally in 
the cerebral white matter (d1, WM white matter). In the leptomenin-
ges, there is also focal multinucleated giant cell inflammation (blue 
arrow in d2). Amyloid angiopathy is also present across the medial 
temporal lobe, including CA4 hippocampal sub-region (d3), in the 
putamen (d4), thalamus, including within the haemorrhage (d5) and 
in the midbrain near the substantia nigra (blue arrow in d6, SN sub-
stantia nigra). CAA is also seen in the cerebellar leptomeninges, and 
to a lesser extent in the cerebellar cortex (d7) and focally in the sub-
cortical cerebellar white matter (d8; GL granule cell layer, ML molec-
ular layer). All sections are immunostained for amyloid-β. Section d2 
is double-labelled for amyloid-β (brown) and macrophages (CD68, 
red). All sections are counterstained with haematoxylin. Scale bar: 
450 µm in a, b, c, d; 200 µm in d1, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8 and 50 µm

inflammation. CAA was also present in cerebral deep grey 
nuclei (including the origin of the haemorrhage), midbrain 
parenchyma, and focally in the subcortical cerebral and 
cerebellar white matter (Fig. 3). There were also wide-
spread parenchymal Aβ deposits corresponding to Thal 
phase 5 and CERAD score 1, whilst neurofibrillary tangle 
tau pathology did not exceed Braak and Braak stage II, in 
keeping with low level Alzheimer’s disease neuropatho-
logical change [21, 35]. There was also Lewy pathology 
restricted to the brainstem, but no evidence of TDP43 
proteinopathy. The APOE genotype was ε3/ε3. Next gen-
eration sequencing of the panel of 17 genes associated 
with different forms of dementia revealed no pathogenic 
mutations.
Case controls
Patients who have a brain biopsy may be more likely to 
have a history of previous neurosurgery for several rea-
sons, for example, long-term or recurrent conditions, or 
complications of an old procedure. On review of the brain 
tissue samples, CAA or parenchymal Aβ pathology was 
not seen in any of the 50 patients (Supplementary Table 2). 
In 46 of the 50 age-matched patients, either childhood neu-
rosurgery was specifically stated in the clinical notes not 
to have happened, or the medical records did not indicate 
prior neurosurgery. In three of the 50 patients, previous 
childhood neurosurgery was documented: two patients had 
intraventricular shunts and one had an anterior communi-
cating artery aneurysm clipped. In one patient, there was a 
history of severe head trauma, but no details of neurosur-
gical intervention could be traced. Making a conservative 
assumption that neurosurgery was done on this patient, 
four of 50 biopsy patients had evidence of a history of neu-
rosurgery (P = 0.0002; 4/50 neurosurgery without CAA 
vs 4/4 with CAA; Fisher’s exact test).
Review of the literature
We went on to question whether cases of early onset 
(age < 55) Aβ CAA were also associated with childhood 
neurosurgery in the literature. We identified six case reports 
of CAA in young male adults. Their past medical histories 
all included a single episode of severe skull bone-penetrating 
traumatic brain injury (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). 
Two of these six individuals definitively had childhood 
neurosurgery and this was likely, as supported by neuro-
imaging, in a further two. One of the six individuals did not 
have neurosurgery in childhood and details of past medical 
history were not provided for another one. The age of the 
patients described below is as stated in the publications, or 
was calculated from the data provided and in these instances 
may be approximate.
Literature case 1 (#5) [15]
This 40-year-old man had a past medical history of traumatic 
brain injury during childhood, requiring craniotomy. At the 
age of 38, he developed a left posterior temporal haemor-
rhage with intraventricular extension. Further haemorrhages 
occurred in the same year and 2 years later, at the age of 
40, requiring haematoma evacuation. Histology confirmed 
CAA and genetic analysis of PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP was 
negative. APOE genotype was ε3/ε3.
Literature cases 2 (#6) and 3 (#7) [39]
Patient “A” (#6), a 42-year-old male had a history of trau-
matic brain injury during childhood, with radiological evi-
dence of a residual bone defect suggesting prior surgery. At 
the age of 37, he presented with the first episode of intrac-
erebral haemorrhage with nine further episodes over the 
following 6 years. A brain biopsy confirmed CAA. Gene 
sequencing of APP showed no pathogenic mutations.
Patient “B” (#7), a 46-year-old male, suffered from a pen-
etrating head injury at the age of 2 years and presented with 
a right parietal lobar haemorrhage 40 years later, at the age 
of 42. Histology confirmed CAA. A further, left temporal 
haemorrhage with ventricular extension occurred at the age 
of 46.
Literature case 4 (#8) [36]
A male, aged 32, had a history of head trauma at the age of 
one requiring neurosurgical repair. He presented with two 
episodes of intracerebral haemorrhage, aged 32. Histologi-
cal and ultrastructural examination of a small tissue sample 
confirmed CAA and his APOE genotype was ε3/ε3.
Discussion
We present here four young adults of both genders, who 
presented with CAA-related cerebral haemorrhages. All had 
undergone neurosurgical procedures several decades earlier, 
for trauma, correction of a congenital malformation, resec-
tion of a brain tumour or syringomyelia. In addition, four 
young adults with CAA and a history of head trauma were 
identified in the literature: two of these patients had a docu-
mented neurosurgical repair [15, 36] and in two there was 
circumstantial evidence of neurosurgical intervention [39]. 
None of the patients from our centre had any known muta-
tions predisposing them to early Aβ pathology such as muta-
tions in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes [9]. Although 
 677
Acta Neuropathologica (2018) 135:671–679 
1 3
three out of four patients from our centre were heterozygous 
for either ε2 or ε4 alleles of APOE—known CAA suscepti-
bility alleles [3, 9], widespread CAA and presentation with 
intracerebral haemorrhages at such a young age would still 
be highly unusual even for carriers of APOE risk alleles. In 
a study by Pletnikova et al. [37], none of the 154 patients 
who had died aged between 30 and 50, showed significant 
CAA: in the stratum of 40–49 years one patient homozygous 
for APOE ε4 had moderate CAA and four patients homo- or 
heterozygous for APOE ε4 had minimal CAA only.
The TREM2 R62H variant, found in one of our patients, 
is associated with increased late onset Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) risk [23], whilst only the TREM2 R47H variant is asso-
ciated with early onset AD [38, 43].
In our group of patients, there is no confirmatory evi-
dence that dural grafts, a possible source of Aβ seeds, were 
used during neurosurgery. Thus, whilst in some patients with 
iCJD Aβ transmission has occurred through insertion of con-
taminated dural grafts [7, 18, 20, 28], alternative routes of 
Aβ transmission need to be considered.
As described above, patients from our cohort had under-
gone neurosurgical interventions during childhood for vari-
ous reasons, and only one had a history of head trauma. The 
history of a single episode of head trauma in all previously 
reported young-onset CAA male patients [15, 36, 39] has 
raised speculations as to the causal relation between male 
gender, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and development of 
Aβ pathology. Head trauma, however, is a common cause 
of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide and a 
proportion of them require neurosurgical intervention for 
either skull fracture or associated brain injury [5]. Further-
more, male preponderance in patients with head trauma 
is well documented in the literature, and the male–female 
ratio increases with age [47]. Nevertheless, it has long been 
debated if a history of head trauma, either single and severe, 
or mild and repetitive, could represent a risk factor for AD, 
often with contradictory findings between studies, due to dif-
ferent inclusion criteria and outcome measures. In patients 
with dementia and a history of chronic mild repetitive head 
trauma, the neuropathological changes have been character-
ised in detail [32]: the hallmark pathology in these patients 
is the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau. As these 
neuropathological changes are distinct from those in AD 
and, in fact, from any other primary tauopathy, this condition 
has been termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). 
Recently CTE with concomitant pathologies, such as TDP43 
pathology, primary tauopathy, Lewy body pathology and 
AD have been reported in demented retired soccer players 
[30]. Expectedly, the majority of elderly patients with at 
least intermediate level of AD neuropathological change and 
a history of chronic mild repetitive head injury [30] also had 
concomitant widespread CAA, as also seen in patients with 
sporadic AD and no history of head trauma. In a study by 
Stein et al. [44], Aβ pathology, reported in approximately 
half of patients with CTE, was strongly associated with the 
presence of an APOE ε4 allele and older age at symptom 
onset. Whilst these data [44] indeed support that Aβ pathol-
ogy occurs more frequently in elderly individuals with a 
history of chronic mild repetitive head trauma, when com-
pared with the normal ageing population, there is no robust 
evidence for a similar association in patients with history 
of a single episode of traumatic brain injury. Whilst paren-
chymal Aβ can be found at early stages after brain trauma 
[41], only a trend towards increased Aβ plaque pathology 
has been reported as a long-term consequence after a single 
TBI in a proportion of patients [24]. Specifically, CAA has 
been reported only in few patients with fatal head injury, 
predominantly in individuals carrying at least one APOE 
ε4 allele [25, 29], suggesting that these patients probably 
had CAA prior to the trauma and that the actual traumatic 
insult causing brain contusions and haemorrhages leading 
to a poor outcome was aggravated by the pre-existing APOE 
ε4-driven CAA. Importantly, no association between self-
reported history of TBI and risk of development of autopsy-
confirmed amyloid angiopathy was found in a large cohort 
of 213 individuals (P > 0.09, Table 4 in [12]). Similarly, 
no increase of amyloid levels was found in 74 cognitively 
normal individuals with self-reported history of TBI using 
PiB-PET imaging [33].
A recent post-mortem study of patients suffering from 
schizophrenia who underwent leucotomy, which can be 
considered as a form of single traumatic brain injury with 
a severe axonal damage, has demonstrated scattered Aβ 
plaques restricted to the lesional site only in patients with 
the APOE ε4 genotype and minimal CAA in 2 of 10 patients 
with APOE ε3/ε4 genotype (67 and 86 years old with and 
without leucotomy, respectively) [42]. These findings argue 
against the notion that mechanical damage through a neu-
rosurgical procedure could have interfered with glymphatic 
or perivascular Aβ clearance, making neurosurgery per se 
an unlikely risk factor for the development of widespread 
CAA later in life. Likewise, a much higher prevalence of 
CAA would be expected if Aβ oligomerisation and propa-
gation was induced by diathermy or by various haemostatic 
sealants.
Remarkably little tau pathology in our patients and 
in published iCJD cohorts [7, 20, 22, 28, 40], suggests, 
amongst other possibilities, differences in the mechanisms 
or dynamics of tau transmission.
In conclusion, the history of neurosurgical procedures, 
the absence of known pathogenic mutations and develop-
ment of CAA-related brain haemorrhages three decades later 
raises the possibility that Aβ proteopathic seeds may have 
been historically transmitted by surgical instruments carry-
ing traces of misfolded Aβ protein. This possibility is under-
pinned by experimental evidence and case data: intracerebral

inoculation of Aβ-rich extracts or implantation of Aβ-coated 
steel wires into animals caused Aβ pathology [1, 16] and 
transmission has occurred in humans through administra-
tion of cadaveric human growth hormone [7, 22, 40] or 
dura mater grafting [18, 20, 28]. The increasing frequency 
of neurosurgical interventions on aged, cognitively intact 
individuals with cerebral Aβ may pose a risk of onward Aβ 
proteopathic seed transmission.
Our study is limited by its small size and because it 
was retrospective could be affected by bias in selection of 
cases, controls or evidence from the literature. We propose 
a hypothesis that might be tested by larger epidemiological 
studies to consider the risk of neurodegenerative disorders 
after neurosurgery. As it takes more than two decades to 
develop pathologically detectable Aβ deposits and for CAA 
to manifest clinically, this has to be considered when plan-
ning such epidemiological studies, and it is unlikely that 
this work can be done prospectively. Any hypothetical trans-
mission during neurosurgery would have occurred at a time 
when instrument cleaning and sterilisation was done differ-
ently from how it is today. Larger, more definitive epidemio-
logical studies are now required to confirm the prevalence 
of vascular Aβ pathology in patients with a past medical 
history of neurosurgery. The possibility of transmission of 
Aβ proteopathic seeds should be taken into account when 
assessing the safety of surgical procedures, including the 
adequate sterilisation of reusable surgical instruments [14, 
46] and use of disposable instruments where appropriate.
