Objectives. To determine if blight remediation of abandoned buildings and vacant lots
can be a cost-beneficial solution to firearm violence in US cities.
Methods. We performed quasi-experimental analyses of the impacts and economic
returns on investment of urban blight remediation programs involving 5112 abandoned
buildings and vacant lots on the occurrence of firearm and nonfirearm violence in Phil-
adelphia, Pennsylvania,from1999to2013.Weadjustedbefore–afterpercent changesand
returns on investment in treated versus control groups for sociodemographic factors.
Results. Abandoned building remediation significantly reduced firearm violence
–39% (95% confidence interval [CI] = –28%, –50%; P < .05) as did vacant lot re-
mediation (–4.6%; 95% CI = –4.2%, –5.0%; P < .001). Neither program significantly
affected nonfirearm violence. Respectively, taxpayer and societal returns on in-
vestment for the prevention of firearm violence were $5 and $79 for every dollar
spent on abandoned building remediation and $26 and $333 for every dollar spent on
vacant lot remediation.
Conclusions. Abandoned buildings and vacant lots are blighted structures seen daily by
urban residents that may create physical opportunities for violence by sheltering illegal
activity and illegal firearms. Urban blight remediation programs can be cost-beneficial
strategies that significantly and sustainably reduce firearm violence. (Am J Public Health.

T
he rate of firearm violence in the United
States is estimated to be larger than that in
any other developed nation, and the majority
of fatal violence committed in the United
States involves firearms.1–5 As a public health
issue, the costs of firearm violence in the
United States are large and extend beyond the
loss of life and emotional burden for affected
individuals and families. Significant costs are
also borne by taxpayers and society at large,
with more than $48 billion per year in medical
and work-loss costs alone.6
Combined fatal-plus-nonfatal firearm
violence has been increasing in the United
States over the past decade7 and cost-
beneficial interventions have been in short
supply. Most attempts to reduce firearm
violence in the United States have focused
directly on the firearms themselves, the users
of firearms, or the victims of firearm violence.
The few interventions that have been shown
to reduce firearm violence are often costly to
sustain, politically impractical, or potentially
infringe on Constitutional protections.8–12
Only a modicum of attention has been
paid to intervening upon the context within
which firearm violence occurs and the urban
environments in which it thrives. It is now
commonly accepted that changing the
context within which health problems occur
is a leading opportunity for high-impact
change, often better than focusing on in-
dividuals and lifestyles.13–17 This may also
apply to firearm violence—individuals who
are simply instructed to adhere to safety
practices are unlikely to be successful if the
unsafe context within which they find
themselves day after day does not permit it.
Directly changing the contexts and envi-
ronments that promote firearm violence is
a potentially potent solution to explore in
reducing the persistent problem of firearm
violence in the United States. Such contex-
tual changes may take the form of actual,
in-situ changes to the environments them-
selves, an approach that may be more polit-
ically feasible, economically viable, and have
a greater probability of widespread
implementation.13,18
Cities in the United States experience
a heavily disproportionate burden of the
nation’s interpersonal firearm violence.19
Urban shootings are concentrated in neigh-
borhoods stricken by poverty and neglect,
and a growing body of scientific evidence
suggests that blighted neighborhood envi-
ronments are strongly tied to firearm violence
in US cities.9,20–25 It is very possible that
directly treating aspects of these blighted
environments in inexpensive ways could
produce lasting reductions in urban firearm
violence. However, to our knowledge, no
research has yet investigated the cost benefits,

 returns on investment, and sustainability of
these blight-reduction treatments on urban
firearm violence.
Interventions that produce sustained re-
ductions in firearm violence for US cities
could produce reductions for the nation as
a whole. Given the promising public health
opportunity and potential cost benefits posed
by addressing the blighted urban contexts
within which firearm violence often occurs,
as well as the disproportionately high and
persistent burden of firearm violence in US
cities, we conducted quasi-experimental an-
alyses to determine the impacts and economic
returns on investment of key urban blight
remediation programs on the occurrence
of firearm violence.
METHODS
We completed 2 quasi-experimental
difference-in-differences analyses of specific
urban blight remediation programs with
regard to firearm and nonfirearm violence
outcomes. One program remediated aban-
doned buildings26 and the other vacant lots of
land.27 Both programs made straightforward
changes to blighted structures in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, following standardized
protocols.
Abandoned Building Remediation
Philadelphia passed an ordinance in 2010
requiring owners of abandoned buildings to
install working doors and windows in all
structural openings and clean the facades of
their buildings. One impetus for the ordi-
nance was that traditional plywood coverings
deteriorate quickly, look disheveled, signal
obvious blight, and are often penetrated to
allow illegal entry into abandoned buildings
(Figure 1).28 Buildings were inspected
approximately once each month to assess
maintenance.
The Philadelphia Department of Licenses
and Inspections provided data on 2356
building addresses that were in violation of
the ordinance. We enrolled all abandoned
buildings that had complied with the ordi-
nance and remediated their blighted windows
and doors in our study as treatment sites
(n = 676). We compared these treated
buildings to a randomly selected and matched
group of control buildings that had received
citations but that had not been treated
(n = 676). After initial 1-to-1 treatment-to-
control matching, we removed and replaced
any control lot within a quarter mile of its
matched treatment lot to avoid treatment
contamination and dilution of effect because
of proximity.
We completed random matching sepa-
rately within 4 sections of the city (North,
Northwest, West, and South) to control for
confounding variables related to geography.
Within matched sets, we assigned the same
treatment dates to control buildings as their
matched treatment buildings so that each
1-to-1 set would have the same pre and
post periods. We measured outcomes on
a monthly basis around treatment and control
groups for a 3-year period, from July 1, 2010,
to July 31, 2013. The mean posttreatment
period was 12 months.
Vacant Lot Remediation
Vacant lots are abandoned parcels of open
land with no buildings on them. Philadelphia
and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society
(PHS) used the city’s antiblight ordinance to
identify and remediate vacant lots. Vacant lots
with illegal dumping, untended vegetation
above a certain height, excess trash, etc. were
cited as in violation of the ordinance. If the
city is the owner of record, PHS can re-
mediate forthwith. If the owner of record is
a private party, then they are given 10 days to
respond to the violation; consent or non-
response allows the city to issue a legal right
of entry for PHS to remediate.
Remediation involves removing trash and
debris, grading the land, planting grass and
trees to create a park-like setting, and in-
stalling low wooden post-and-rail fences with
walk-in openings around each lot’s perimeter
to show that the lot was cared for, permit
recreational use, and deter illegal dumping.
Landscapers return approximately once
each month to perform basic maintenance
(Figure 1).
The PHS provided data on 4436 reme-
diated vacant lot addresses, which we enrolled
in our study as treatment sites. We compared
these treatedlots with a randomly selected and
matched group of lots that were also in vi-
olation and eligible for treatment, but that had
not been treated.29 To choose these control
lots, a master database of 49 690 untreated
vacant lots was assembled from data at the
Philadelphia Bureau of Revision of Taxes,
Department of Licenses and Inspections, and
US Postal Service. Over the study period,
3.5% of vacant lots were excluded because
they had housing or other structures de-
veloped on them, had become inaccessible or
unmaintainable, or were in a part of the city in
which a trivial number (< 0.2%) of vacant lots
had been treated.
We randomly selected and matched 3
control vacant lots (n = 13 308) to each
treated vacant lot. We completed this random
matching process separately within each of
the 4 sections of the city to control for
confounding variables related to geography.
We chose the 3-to-1 ratio because at most
3 control lots per treated lot were available
for random selection, without replacement,
in all 4 sections of the city. Within matched
sets, we assigned the same treatment dates
to controls as their matched treatment lots so
that each 3-to-1 comparison would have the
same pre and post periods. We measured
outcomes on a yearly basis, around treatment
and control groups for a full 10-year period,
from January 1, 1999, to December 31,
2008. The mean posttreatment period was
46 months.
Outcomes and Sociodemographic
Data
We examined the effect of the 2 blight
remediation programs on firearm and non-
firearm assault outcomes. The Philadelphia
Police Department provided the dates and
longitude–latitude coordinates for aggravated
assaults, aggravated assaults involving fire-
arms, and aggravated assaults not involving
firearms from 1999 to 2013. We obtained
confounding sociodemographic factors—
age, education, poverty, and income—
annually at the block group level for 1999 to
2013 from Geolytics Incorporated and the US
Census Bureau. We defined age as median
years for all residents, education as the per-
centage of residents aged 25 years or older
with at least some college, poverty as the
percentage of residents living below the
federal poverty level,30 and income as median
annual household income.
We calculated point-based, distance-
weighted geographic metrics for the crime

 outcomes and sociodemographic factors in
the areas surrounding each building or lot by
using ArcGIS. For the abandoned buildings,
we calculated these metrics monthly, and for
the vacant lots, we calculated these yearly. We
used the longitude–latitude locations of all
assault outcomes to calculate a kernel density
estimate and interpolate the assaults per square
mile at the centroid of each building or lot.
We assigned the value of each sociodemo-
graphic factor to the longitude–latitude
location of the centroid of its block group
and then we used an inverse-distance
weighting calculation to interpolate the
value of the sociodemographic factor at the
centroid of each building or lot. In this
way, crime and sociodemographic measures
that were farther away from a vacant lot
or abandoned building received lower
weights. These point-based GIS methods
precisely and uniquely estimated the
magnitude of factors at the point locations
of each building and lot, avoiding the need
for multilevel statistical adjustments and
biases created by administrative data
aggregated into polygons.31–35
Study Design and Analyses
We used a quasi-experimental difference-
in-differences study design and analysis. We
subtracted 2 differences, a pre–post and an
intervention–control group difference,
thereby reducing various threats to validity
and attempting to isolate the true causal effect
of the intervention on the outcome.29,36
We first conducted unadjusted analyses and
tests for multicollinearity, which was minimal
(all variance-inflation factors < 4.0). We then
used Poisson random-effects regression models
to estimate the impact of blight remediation on
crime, while controlling for sociodemographic
factors.37 Huber/White/sandwich estimators
provided robust standard errors.
Each regression model included a crime
outcome, Yit, where i represents the units of
analysis, either abandoned buildings or vacant
lots, and t represents the units of time; a
pre–post intervention term, b1Pit;
a treatment-control status term, b2Rit;
a difference-in-differences interaction term,

We calculated the b3 difference-in-
differences terms and interpreted them as the
effect of abandoned housing or vacant lot
remediation on crime. Using the previously
fit regression models, we then estimated the
marginal effects where b3 = 1 and where
b3 = 0. These marginal effects were expo-
nentiated and differenced to obtain absolute
magnitudes of reduction for each outcome in
the postperiod, m1. Absolute magnitudes of
reduction were then divided by the total
magnitude of occurrence for each outcome
in the postperiod to obtain percentage
reductions, 100 * (m1 / mtotal).
The direct and indirect economic costs of
crime are incurred by victims (e.g., medical
expenses, property loss or damage), the criminal
justice system (e.g., police, court, and in-
carceration costs), and society at large (including
the aforementioned costs as well as other indirect
costs; e.g., productivity losses resulting from
criminals choosing to engage in illegal activities
instead of legal activities that contribute to gross
domestic product, pain, and suffering costs).44
We calculated average annual returns on in-
vestmentforeachremediationprogramfromthe
perspectives of taxpayers and society at large as
the net benefit associated with an investment,
divided by the cost of the investment.
To calculate the average annual cost sav-
ings to the taxpayer, the value assigned to each
assault reflected the relevant costs incurred by
the criminal justice system, and the societal
value reflected all the direct and indirect costs
discussed previously. Unit cost estimates
were adjusted for inflation to 2014 US dollars
and followed a standard approach from
previous work that included tangible and
intangible losses as well as cost-of-illness and
jury compensation methods in calculating the
costs of various criminal acts.44 Because the
mean posttreatment observation periods
differed between the 2 remediation programs,
we took 2 approaches to estimating returns on
investment for the purpose of comparability.
First, we estimated the average annual
return on investment by using only the mean
costs incurred in the initial remediation
(i.e., the first-year costs of the program).
Because the average annual cost of each
program should fall over time given the
relatively large initial fixed costs of remediation,
this is the more conservative approach, and the
primary focus of our discussion. The second
approach used the average annual cost of re-
mediation calculated over the longer observed
posttreatment period of 46 months that was
associatedwiththevacantlotprogram.Thiscost
included the initial upfront cost as well as annual
maintenance costs. We completed all
calculations with Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
In unadjusted analyses of abandoned
building remediations, we found statistically
significant reductions for firearm assaults
(P < .05), although not for all assaults or
nonfirearm assaults. Unadjusted analyses of
vacant lot remediations demonstrated statis-
tically significant reductions for firearm
assaults and all assault (P < .001), although not
for nonfirearm assaults.
Regression-adjusted analyses showed that
the abandoned building remediation treat-
ment significantly reduced firearm assaults
(–1.7 firearm assaults per square mile per year;
95% confidence interval [CI] = –1.2, –2.2;
P < .05), but not nonfirearm assaults or total
assaults. This absolute number of significantly
reduced firearm assaults translated into
–39% (95% CI = –28%, –50%; P < .05)
fewer firearm assaults at or near abandoned
buildings after they had been remediated
(Tables 1 and 2).
Regression-adjusted analyses showed
that the vacant lot remediation treatment
also significantly reduced firearm assaults
(–4.5 firearm assaults per square mile per year;
95% CI = –4.2, –4.9; P < .001) as well as total
assaults (–5.6 firearm assaults per square mile
per year; 95% CI = –4.9, –6.3; P < .001),
but not nonfirearm assaults. These significant
absolute numbers translated into –4.6% (95%
CI = –4.2%, –5.0%; P < .001) fewer firearm
assaults and –2.2% (95% CI = –1.9%, –2.4%;
P < .001) fewer assaults at or near vacant
lots after they had been remediated (Tables 1
and 2).
We followed abandoned buildings for 1
year after remediation and they had a median
of 4 door or window openings. We followed
vacant lots for an average of 3.8 years after
remediation and they had a median area of
1078 square feet. The typical remediation
costs for an abandoned building and vacant lot
are $2550 and $1597, respectively, and
both cost approximately $180 per year
thereafter to maintain.45
The average annual cost offsets to the
criminal justice system associated with the
statistically significant reduction in firearm
assaults were $16 554 (95% CI = –$11 587,
–$21 151) per abandoned building re-
mediation and $43 037 (95% CI = –$39 507,
–$46 523) per vacant lot greening. Society’s
cost offsets for an abandoned building re-
mediation and a vacant lot greening were
$205 019 (95% CI = –$143 504, –$261 952)

Based on these figures and the initial cost of
remediation, the first-year return on in-
vestment to taxpayers for firearm assaults
averted was $5 (95% CI = $4, $7; P < .05) per
abandoned building and $26 (95% CI = $24,

observed for the vacant-lot program raises the

to $20 (95% CI = $14, $25; P < .05) per

assaults.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to our knowledge to
report cost-benefit and percentage reduction
estimates for urban blight remediation pro-
grams and firearm violence. Both key blight
remediation programs tested here were found
to be high-value, high-return strategies that
significantly and sustainably reduced firearm
violence. Neither program significantly re-
duced nonfirearm violence, suggesting that
there is something unique to firearm violence
that makes it especially treatable with
programs that transform blighted urban
environments.
Philadelphia experienced a large, statis-
tically significant, –39% reduction in fire-
arm violence in and around abandoned
buildings that had been remediated. The
city also experienced a smaller, but more
statistically significant, –5% reduction in
firearm violence in and around vacant lots
that had been remediated. These significant
reductions were sustained from 1 to almost
4 years.
Urban blight remediation is a low-cost,
high-return solution to firearm violence.
Simple treatments of abandoned buildings
and vacant lots returned conservative esti-
mates of between $5.00 and $26.00 in net
benefits to taxpayers and between $79.00 and
$333.00 to society at large, for every dollar
invested. Other firearm violence prevention
programs have either been unsuccessful or
require more costly human resources to be
active and ever-present for them to work.8–12
Blight remediation may outperform many of
these other programs in terms of value and
sustainability.
Urban residents see abandoned buildings
and vacant lots every day outside their homes
or on their way to work or school, and have
called for and led the blight remediation
solutions described here. They describe these
undesirable structures as, foremost, hyper-
visible detractors to health, eroding their sense
of community and generating trash, vermin,
fear, drug abuse, prostitution, and crime.25
Acute, biologic stress responses to seeing these
blighted spaces have also been documented
among residents in their communities.46
Broken windows and collective efficacy
theories also support this positing that blight
visibly signals that a community is uncared-
for, that incivilities and crime are tolerated,
and that residents are unable to engage in
shared expectations of social control over
problems. As a result, unhealthy behaviors,
such as firearm violence, can become
sheltered and prevalent.47–49
Perhaps an even more compelling expla-
nation for our findings is the actual, physical
opportunities that blighted urban environ-
ments offer for firearms violence to pro-
liferate. Abandoned buildings and vacant lots
may shelter or hide individuals who partici-
pate in illegal activity. These individuals often
have previous criminal records and cannot
legally carry firearms, despite needing some
means to settle business or other disputes.
Abandoned buildings and vacant lots can thus
serve as out-of-sight staging or storage areas
for their illegal firearms until they are
needed.25,27 This may also help explain why
firearm violence, but not nonfirearm vio-
lence, was significantly reduced after the
treatment of blighted spaces.

 Study Limitations and Future
Directions
One concern is that an abandoned
building or a vacant lot remediated in one
location may displace the firearm violence it
was thought to eliminate to another, nearby
location. However, previous research in
other cities and additional spatial displace-
ment tests of the effects of abandoned
building and vacant lot remediation con-
ducted as part of our analyses in Philadelphia
suggest that firearm violence displacement
effects like this had little impact on our
findings.26,27,50,51
Another concern is that the blight re-
mediation strategies presented here may have
led to gentrification and the displacement of
low- and middle-income residents and that
this may affect our findings. To be clear, the
blight remediation strategies studied here
were specifically chosen because they were
inexpensive, scalable, and designed to be
installed immediately proximal to where
residents lived, oftentimes in low-income
neighborhoods.18 They were not luxury
housing developments or expensive, single-
location destination amenities such as upscale
parks and recreation facilities.
Accompanying analyses have found
property taxes to be unchanged and, if any-
thing, reduced, after blighted properties
were remediated with the inexpensive in-
terventions described here.27 These findings
were based on differenced trends comparing
treated and control spaces limiting the pos-
sibility that the effects found were attributable
to gentrification, something that was further
controlled by the inclusion of various soci-
odemographic covariates measured over
time. Cities like Philadelphia have also passed
municipal legislation to limit property tax
increases for longtime residents in curtailing
displacement because of gentrification52 and
only a very small percentage (< 5%) of the
properties remediated as part of the programs
described here have been developed into
luxury homes or commercial businesses.53
This suggests that the beneficial effects of
these basic remediation strategies endure with
few of the unwanted negative consequences
of gentrification.
Although our quasi-experimental study
design allowed reasonable estimates of
the true changes in violence tied to the
implementation of blight remediation pro-
grams, unmeasured covariates could still have
confounded our findings. This may have
included unaccounted differentials by which
abandoned buildings and vacant lots ulti-
mately fell into the treatment group and
which did not. We carefully matched treated
and control units and included a set of key
covariates in our regression models to mini-
mize this, but randomized controlled trials of
abandoned building and vacant lot re-
mediation are now warranted to fully address
this limitation. Trials and additional
quasi-experimental studies also should be
conducted in other cities to demonstrate
replicability and further investigate specific
types of neighborhoods and implementation
processes by which blight remediation works
to reduce firearm violence.54
Finally, we distinguish our use of the word
“blight” from previous negative connota-
tions.55 Our use of the word is in line with the
existing federal lexicon56 and numerous
municipal ordinances. Rather than pro-
moting unwanted relocation of residents, as
has been associated with uses of the word
blight in previous urban development pro-
grams,55,57 the in situ, low-cost blight re-
mediation strategies studied here encourage
residents to remain in their homes and not
to relocate (or be relocated) because their
neighborhoods are chronically dilapidated
and threatened by firearm violence.25
Conclusions
Tens of millions of vacant and abandoned
properties exist in the United States. These
blighted properties represent tens of billions
of dollars in lost tax revenues and municipal
costs. They also erode community connect-
edness, create stress and fear among
residents, and, given the findings here, pro-
mote firearm violence. For these and other
reasons, blight remediation programs have
been recognized by multiple organizations
interested in reducing violence and pro-
moting urban health, including the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, the
Institute of Medicine, and the National
Institutes of Health.9,13,15,58,59
Simple remediation of abandoned build-
ings and vacant lots is a high-value in-
tervention to reduce firearm violence. By
design, these remediation programs make
structural improvements to the very context
within which city residents are exposed on
a daily basis. They involve straightforward,
inexpensive, and reproducible implementa-
tion and maintenance protocols that are
scalable to entire cities, ask little if anything of
local residents to be sustained over time,13,18
and allow residents to remain in their home
neighborhoods without the need for ex-
pensive and unwanted relocation.60,61
