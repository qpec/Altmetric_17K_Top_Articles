Talazoparib inhibits PARP catalytic activity, trapping PARP1 on damaged DNA and 
causing cell death in BRCA1/2-mutated cells. We evaluated talazoparib therapy in 
this two-part, phase I, first-in-human trial. Antitumor activity, MTD, pharmacokinetics, and pharma-
codynamics of once-daily talazoparib were determined in an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation 
study (NCT01286987). The MTD was 1.0 mg/day, with an elimination half-life of 50 hours. Treatment-
related adverse events included fatigue (26/71 patients; 37%) and anemia (25/71 patients; 35%). 
Grade 3 to 4 adverse events included anemia (17/71 patients; 24%) and thrombocytopenia (13/71 
patients; 18%). Sustained PARP inhibition was observed at doses ≥0.60 mg/day. At 1.0 mg/day, con-
firmed responses were observed in 7 of 14 (50%) and 5 of 12 (42%) patients with BRCA mutation–
associated breast and ovarian cancers, respectively, and in patients with pancreatic and small cell lung 
cancer. Talazoparib demonstrated single-agent antitumor activity and was well tolerated in patients at 
the recommended dose of 1.0 mg/day.
SIGNIFICANCE: In this clinical trial, we show that talazoparib has single-agent antitumor activity and a 
tolerable safety profile. At its recommended phase II dose of 1.0 mg/day, confirmed responses were 
observed in patients with BRCA mutation–associated breast and ovarian cancers and in patients with 
pancreatic and small cell lung cancer. Cancer Discov; 7(6); 620–9. ©2017 AACR.

iNtRODUctiON
The most-studied PARP enzymes are PARP1 and PARP2, 
which play critical roles in DNA damage detection and repair 
(1, 2), including the repair of single-strand DNA breaks 
through the base excision repair pathway (3–5). It has been 
hypothesized that single-strand DNA breaks persist when 
PARP function is compromised, leading to the creation of 
double-strand DNA breaks during replication (6); these dou-
ble-strand DNA breaks are usually repaired by homologous 
recombination repair (HRR), allowing replication to continue 
(6). However, loss of PARP activity becomes lethal when 
HRR is compromised. This phenomenon, known as synthetic 
lethality, is well established for deleterious mutations of 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (7–9).
The PARP inhibitor olaparib was recently approved for the 
treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and remains the only 
approved agent. PARP inhibitors have also demonstrated 
antitumor activity against other tumor types with DNA 
repair deficiencies, including breast and prostate cancers 
(10–13). Talazoparib (also known as MDV3800 and BMN 
673) is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of PARP1/2 
that achieves antitumor cell responses and elicits DNA repair 
markers at notably lower concentrations than earlier-gener-
ation PARP1/2 inhibitors (14, 15). In addition to inhibiting 
PARP catalytic activity, talazoparib is currently the most 
potent PARP1/2 inhibitor in vitro at trapping PARP–DNA 
complexes at sites of single-strand DNA breaks (16). Preclini-
cally, talazoparib has favorable metabolic stability, oral bio-
availability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) that support its daily 
schedule in clinical trials (14).
We conducted a first-in-human, phase I dose-escalation 
(Part 1) trial of talazoparib in patients with advanced solid 
malignancies and an expansion cohort (Part 2) in patients 
with tumors predicted to be potentially sensitive to PARP 
inhibition. These included tumors harboring germline 
BRCA1/2 mutations; triple-negative breast cancers; high-
grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or peritoneal cancers; and castration-resistant prostate and 
pancreatic cancers. Patients with Ewing sarcoma or small cell 
lung cancer (SCLC) were also studied; the former was based 
on a 1,000-cell line screen demonstrating antitumor activity

(17, 18), and the latter was based on SCLC platinum sensitiv-
ity, increased PARP1 expression, and sensitivity of SCLC cell 
lines and animal models to PARP inhibition (19, 20).
ResUlts
Between January 3, 2011, and August 21, 2014, 113 patients 
with advanced solid tumors were enrolled at a total of six 
 
centers: five in the United States and one in the United King-
dom. A total of 110 patients received talazoparib (Table 1). 
Thirty-nine patients participated in Part 1 and received tala-
zoparib at nine dose levels ranging from 0.025 to 1.1 mg/day 
(Fig. 1). An additional 71 patients were treated with talazo-
parib 1.0 mg/day in Part 2. As of the date of database cutoff 
(March 31, 2015), 2 patients in Part 1 and 5 patients in Part 2 
continue to be treated (Fig. 1).

Safety
The number of patients per dose level, observed dose-
limiting toxicities (DLT), dose reductions, and median time 
on study are provided in Table 2. Dose-limiting thrombocyto-
penia in cycle 1 occurred in 1 of 6 patients at 0.9 mg/day and 
2 of 6 patients assessable for DLT at 1.1 mg/day. The patient 
treated at 0.9 mg/day experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
with grade 3 anemia. Of the 2 patients treated at 1.1 mg/day, 
both experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia; for 1 of these 
patients, it became grade 4 thrombocytopenia. All DLTs 
resolved after temporary interruption of study drug; no hem-
orrhage was noted. Because 2 patients experienced a DLT at the 
 
1.1 mg/day dose level, an interim dose of 1.0 mg/day was 
investigated. No DLTs were observed at this dose level in a 
group of 6 assessable patients. This dose was therefore deter-
mined to be the MTD and the recommended dose for Part 2.
In Part 2, 71 patients received talazoparib at 1.0 mg/day via 
continuous daily dosing. The median relative dose intensity 
was high at 97.2%, and the dose was well tolerated. Table 2  
presents the most common toxicities at this dose related 
to the study drug, including fatigue (37%), anemia (35%), 
nausea (32%), thrombocytopenia (21%), alopecia (20%), and 
neutropenia (15%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AE) assessed 
by investigator as related were reported in 32 (45%) patients, 
with the most frequent being anemia (23%), thrombocytope-
nia (18%), and neutropenia (10%).
Of the 77 patients receiving the 1.0 mg/day dose, 26 
patients (34%) reported at least one dose reduction, the major-
ity of whom (20 patients) had reductions due to an AE such 
 
as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Although 
transient dose holidays were needed as a result of these AEs, 
no patients permanently withdrew from treatment because of 
them in either Part 1 or Part 2 of the trial.
There were eight deaths associated with an AE during the 
study, none of which were considered to be related to study 
treatment. Two of the deaths occurred in patients with breast 
cancer enrolled in Part 1 at the entry dose of 1.1 mg/day 
talazoparib (both related to disease progression). Six of the 
deaths occurred in patients in Part 2 at the 1.0 mg/day dose 
of talazoparib (2 patients with pancreatic cancer, both from 
disease progression; 2 patients with Ewing sarcoma, 1 from 
dyspnea and the other from respiratory failure; and 2 patients 
with SCLC, 1 from hypoxia secondary to lung metastases and 
the other from lung infection).

Pharmacokinetics
Mean talazoparib plasma concentration–time profiles fol-
lowing single and multiple doses of talazoparib are provided 
in Fig. 2A–D. Talazoparib PK parameters resulting from the 
analysis of the plasma concentration–time profiles are pro-
vided in Table 3.
Talazoparib demonstrated rapid absorption, with maxi-
mum plasma concentration (Cmax) generally reached within 2 
hours after all evaluated doses and following both single and 
multiple daily dosing. Steady-state plasma concentrations 
were reached by 2 weeks of daily dosing across all doses evalu-
ated. Talazoparib was well distributed into tissue compart-
ments, with apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) estimates 
well in excess of the volume of the systemic circulatory space. 
Plasma elimination followed biphasic kinetics with a long 
terminal half-life (t1/2). Linear elimination across dose levels 
was apparent following both single and multiple daily dos-
ing as evidenced by parallel terminal phases of the log-linear 
profiles and similar apparent oral clearance (CL/F) estimates 
across dose levels. At the MTD dose of 1.0 mg/day, t1/2 was 
approximately 2 days, and mean accumulation ratio was 
 
2.4-fold at steady state.

table 3. PK parameters and PARP inhibition following single and multiple daily dosing
Plasma concentrations, Cmax, and area under the plasma 
concentration–time curve (AUC) estimates increased approxi-
mately with doses ranging from 0.025 to 1.1 mg following 
multiple daily dosing as shown in Fig. 2E–H. Estimates [95% 
confidence interval (CI)] of the dose proportionality param-
eter, β, for Cmax and AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24) follow-
ing multiple daily doses of talazoparib were 1.11 (1.01–1.20) 
and 0.95 (0.84–1.05), respectively.
Results for urinary elimination of the parent compound 
suggest linear urinary elimination kinetics after daily tala-
zoparib dosing between the 0.025 and 1.1 mg dose levels. 
Following single doses in Part 1, mean values for the amount 
of the analyte excreted in urine from 0 to 24 hours (Ae0–24) 
and the fraction of urine excretion from 0 to 24 hours (Fe0–24) 
generally increased with dose, and average renal clearance 
from time 0 to 24 hours postdose (ARC0–24) values were simi-
lar across dose levels. Following multiple daily doses in Part 
1, Ae0–24 increased with increasing dose, whereas mean Fe0–24 
and ARC0–24 values were generally similar across the 0.025 
and 1.1 mg/day dose levels.

by dose level are provided in Table 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Overall, PBMC PARP activity decreased with talazoparib dose 
across the evaluated dose range.
The dose–response and concentration–response relation-
ships between talazoparib and PBMC PARP activity are 
shown in Fig. 2E–H, and maximum inhibitory effect model 
parameter estimates are provided in Supplementary Table S1. 
In the exposure–response curve, an estimated half maximal 
inhibitory concentration of AUC0–24 was 19,000 pg · h/mL.
Efficacy
In 14 patients with breast cancer (all with deleterious 
BRCA1/2 mutations) treated with talazoparib at 1.0 mg/day, 
the objective response rate (ORR) was 50% and included one 
complete response (CR; Table 4). Five patients had stable 
disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks, resulting in a clini-
cal benefit rate (CBR) of 86% for at least 24 weeks. Median 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 34.6 weeks (95% CI, 27.1–
54.0; Table 4). For the total of 18 patients with breast cancer 
with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations treated at any talazo-
parib dose level, the ORR and CBR were higher in patients 
whose tumors carried the BRCA2 mutation (ORR, 55%, 6/11 
patients; CBR, 91%, 10/11 patients) compared with those 
who had the BRCA1 mutation (ORR, 38%, 3/8 patients; CBR, 
50%, 4/8 patients; percentage change in target lesion size 
summarized in Fig. 3A). Of note, 1 patient had aberrations 
in both BRCA1 and BRCA2, although the BRCA2 aberration 
detected may not be deleterious (Y3098X). Interestingly, in 
the patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer, higher anti-
tumor activity was observed in patients with non–triple-neg-
ative breast cancer (n = 9) than in those with triple-negative 
disease [n = 9; CBR, 89% vs. 56% ≥24 weeks; median PFS, 38.3 
weeks (95% CI, 2.6–67.4) vs. 20.4 weeks (95% CI, 3.1–36.1)]. 
Six of the 18 patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer had 
received prior platinum therapy, of whom 2 had an objective 
response.
In 12 patients with ovarian cancer with deleterious ger-
mline BRCA1/2 mutations with measurable disease treated 
with talazoparib 1.0 mg/day, ORR and CBR lasting at least 24 
weeks equaled 42% and 67%, respectively, with a median PFS 
of 36.4 weeks (Table 4). For all patients with BRCA-mutated 
ovarian cancer treated at any talazoparib dose level with 
measurable disease (n = 25), ORR and CBR lasting at least 
24 weeks were 48% (including one CR) and 76%, respectively 
(percentage change in target lesion size is summarized in 
Fig. 3B). All 25 patients had received prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy; the ORR in platinum-sensitive patients was 
55% (11/20 patients) compared with 20% (1/5 patients) in 
platinum-resistant patients.
All 23 patients with SCLC were enrolled in Part 2 and 
treated with 1.0 mg/day. Median number of prior regimens 
was 1, ranging from 0 to 2. Two patients had a partial 
response (PR; ORR, 9%, with duration of response 12.0 and 
15.3 weeks, respectively), and a further 4 had SD lasting 
at least 16 weeks (CBR, 26% ≥16 weeks; Table 4). For the 2 
patients with an objective response, both had had an objective 
response to the last prior platinum therapy, with a platinum-
free interval of 6 months or less. Median PFS for this group 
was 11.1 weeks (95% CI, 4.3–13.0).
Of the 13 patients with pancreatic cancer from Part 1 and Part 
2, 4 had clinical benefit (CBR, 31% ≥16 weeks): Two patients had 
a PR, 1 with BRCA2 mutation, the other with a PALB2 mutation 
(Table 4). For patients with Ewing sarcoma, no objective response 
was observed, and the CBR (SD ≥ 16 weeks) was 23%.
For the 7 patients currently receiving talazoparib on the 
study as of the data cutoff of March 31, 2015, 4 have ovar-
ian cancer (continuing on study for 27.4, 28.1, 31.5, and 36.6 
months), and 1 patient each has breast, pancreatic, or prostate 
cancer (24.2, 22.8, and 8.4 months, respectively). The starting 
dose for these patients ranged between 0.9 and 1.0 mg/day; 
current dose is between 0.5 and 1.0 mg/day.

 Talazoparib in Patients with Advanced/Recurrent Solid Tumors
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
JUNE  2017 CANCER DISCOVERY | 627 
is superior in trapping PARP–DNA at the site of DNA dam-
age by comparison (16). This first-in-human study demon-
strated that talazoparib results in single-agent activity in 
patients harboring germline deleterious BRCA mutations 
or whose tumors harbor other mutations sensitive to PARP 
inhibition. The clinical activity observed with talazoparib 
suggests that targeting PARP1/2 may also be an effective 
strategy for those patients whose tumors harbor other 
genomic abnormalities involved in DNA repair mecha-
nisms (13).
Talazoparib was well tolerated overall. The primary tox-
icity of talazoparib was hematologic, with transient and 
reversible cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
anemia), primarily managed with drug interruption and/or 
dose reduction and otherwise routine medical intervention; 
transfusions were uncommon. All episodes of DLT involved 
brief thrombocytopenia without hemorrhage. Nonhemato-
logic toxic effects were mild in severity and manageable. The 
relative dose intensity was high at 97.2%, and overall the dose 
was well tolerated. Furthermore, no patients permanently 
withdrew from talazoparib treatment because of toxicity, in 
either Part 1 or Part 2 of this study.
Talazoparib demonstrated favorable PK properties with 
good oral bioavailability, rapid absorption, and dose-propor-
tional increases in total exposure (AUC) over a wide dose range 
(0.025–1.1 mg/day). Steady state was reached approximately 
 
2 weeks after initiation of daily dosing. Linear urinary elimina-
tion kinetics were reported with daily dosing. At the recom-
mended phase II dose of 1.0 mg/day, the t1/2 was approximately 
2 days upon multiple dosing; trough talazoparib plasma con-
centrations were maintained above 10 nmol/L, suggesting that 
systemic concentrations of talazoparib are sufficient to inhibit 
PARP activity.
In pharmacodynamic (PD) testing, talazoparib demon-
strated PARP inhibition in PBMCs over a relatively wide 
range of doses. For doses at and above 0.6 mg/day, PARP 
activity was consistently inhibited in all patients evaluated. 
PD results suggest that effective PARP inhibition could still 
be achieved at reduced dose levels.
Talazoparib demonstrated promising antitumor activ-
ity in patients with heavily pretreated breast and ovar-
ian cancers associated with deleterious germline BRCA1/2 
mutations. Single-agent activity in patients with advanced 
breast cancer (including patients with triple-negative dis-
ease) equaled 50% (ORR) and 86% (CBR). Similarly, in the 
12 patients with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer treated with 
1.0 mg/day of talazoparib, ORR and CBR equaled 42% and 
67%, respectively.
Of note, 1 responding patient with pancreatic cancer har-
bored a PALB2 mutation (21); as this mutation is known 
to recruit BRCA2 and RAD51 to DNA breaks, such findings 
support a trial in a broader population (those with addi-
tional DNA repair deficiencies as opposed to BRCA muta-
tions only), potentially expanding applications for PARP 
inhibitor therapy.
In conclusion, the findings from this study demonstrate 
the effectiveness of single-agent talazoparib for the treat-
ment of patients with and without germline BRCA1/2 muta-
tions in ovarian, breast, small cell lung, and pancreatic 
cancers. Talazoparib has a tolerable safety profile in multiple 
patients seen over a treatment period exceeding 2 years. The 
PK properties of talazoparib support once-daily dosing. Data 
from this phase I trial support a role for talazoparib in the 
treatment of patients with advanced tumors (inherited and 
sporadic cancers with DNA repair deficiencies). Talazoparib 
is currently undergoing further clinical investigation against 
multiple tumor types, including a phase III trial in patients 
with metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious BRCA1/2 
mutation.
MethODs
Study Design and Participants
We undertook a phase I study of talazoparib in patients with 
advanced solid tumors and either germline BRCA1/2 mutations or 
a strong preclinical rationale for use of a PARP inhibitor. Eligible 
patients were age 18 years or older and had histologically or cyto-
logically documented unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic 
solid tumors not suitable for established therapy or for which 
standard therapy had failed; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status of 0 or 1; and adequate hematologic and liver 
function.

Patients enrolled in Part 1 (dose escalation) had tumors known 
to harbor DNA repair deficiencies (Supplementary Methods); provi-
sion of documentation (genomic or immunohistochemistry) was 
not required. Enrollment in Part 2 was restricted to patients with 
selected tumors with confirmed BRCA1/2 germline pathogenic or 
deleterious mutations by BRACAnalysis (Myriad Genetics) or local 
laboratory evaluation (ovarian or peritoneal, breast, prostate, or 
pancreatic cancers), patients with DNA repair deficiency, or patients 
with SCLC or Ewing sarcoma (Supplementary Methods). Patient 
eligibility, including a full list of exclusion criteria, is provided in 
Supplementary Methods.
The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, good 
clinical practice standards, and the Declaration of Helsinki and the 
International Conference on Harmonisation. The appropriate Insti-
tutional Review Board or ethics committee at each participating insti-
tution approved the protocol. All enrolled patients provided written 
informed consent before undergoing study-specific procedures.
Study Treatment
For Part 1, fasted patients received a single dose of talazoparib at 
the start of the study and then underwent PK and PD assessments 
 
1 week later. Following assessments, patients received talazoparib 
once daily, continuously for 28 days, again followed by a 1-week break 
from treatment (defined as cycle 1) to assess PK and PD. Dosing was 
continuous thereafter without breaks except as needed for toxicity. A 
standard 3+3 design was used for dose escalation (22), with a starting 
talazoparib dose of 0.025 mg/day. Dose doubling occurred provided 
toxicities were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
grade 1 or less during cycle 1; dose escalations were limited to 25% 
to 50% once grade 2 drug-related toxicities were observed (25% for 
grade 3 drug-related toxicity). For each cohort, the first patient was 
observed for 15 days prior to additional patient enrollment. To be 
eligible for DLT assessment, a patient must have received at least 24 
of the planned 28 doses of talazoparib between days 8 and 35. A DLT 
was defined as any of the following events occurring during cycle 1: 
grade 4 neutropenia associated with grade 2 or greater infection or 
lasting at least 5 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia (or grade 3 with 
either hemorrhage or dose interruption for ≥5 days); any AE of grade 3 
or greater considered related to talazoparib, except a nonhematologic 
asymptomatic grade 3 laboratory AE, grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and/
or diarrhea medically managed to grade 2 or less within 24 hours, 
or grade 3 fatigue that improved to grade 2 or less in no more than 
 
5 days (additional information provided in Supplementary Methods).
Enrollment in Part 2 proceeded once the MTD was determined. 
Patients received talazoparib at the MTD of 1.0 mg/day starting 
from cycle 1, day 1 (28-day cycles). Participation in the study could 
be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator and 
in accordance with clinical judgment.
AEs were recorded from the time of first dose of talazoparib until 
30 days after the last dose.
Study Procedures
At screening, patients underwent physical examination (with vital 
signs and performance status assessment). Safety laboratory tests 
(complete blood count with differential and platelets, chemistry) 
were obtained weekly; coagulation and urinalysis were obtained 
weekly (cycle 1) and at the beginning of each cycle thereafter. Hema-
tology evaluations were conducted more frequently upon observa-
tion of grade 2 or greater neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Further 
details of study procedures are given in Supplementary Methods.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma and urine samples were assayed for talazoparib concen-
trations using a validated high-performance LC/MS-MS detection 
method. For plasma, the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 
5.0 pg/mL; for urine, the LLOQ was 25.0 pg/mL. Talazoparib PK 
parameters (following single and multiple daily dosing) were obtained 
using standard noncompartmental analysis methods in Phoenix Win-
Nonlin Version 6.4 (Certara L.P.). PK parameters estimated included 
Cmax; time to Cmax; AUC0–24, AUC from time 0 to time of last quantifi-
able concentration, and AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity; 
CL/F; Vz/F; and t1/2. The multiple-dose PK parameters also estimated 
included minimum plasma concentration and CL/F at steady state. 
Dose proportionality following single and multiple daily dosing of 
talazoparib was assessed using a power model approach (23).
Pharmacodynamic Analysis
See Supplementary Methods for details.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective in Part 1 of this study was to determine the 
MTD and recommended dose of daily oral talazoparib; secondary objec-
tives included safety, PK, and PD profiles. For Part 2, efficacy parameters 
in the selected tumor types were investigated per a prespecified analysis 
based on RECIST version 1.1 through investigator assessment of lesion 
measurements, including ORR (in patients with measurable disease) or 
disease-specific changes in tumor markers using standard definitions 
(24–26). The number and percentage of patients achieving a response 
were summarized with an exact 95% CI calculated using the Clopper–
Pearson method. The PFS was summarized using the Kaplan–Meier 
method. The data cutoff was March 31, 2015. SAS Analytics Software 
(version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc.) was used for data analyses.
