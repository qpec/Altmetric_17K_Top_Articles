Abstract ApoE4 genotype is the most prevalent and also clinically most important risk factor for
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Available evidence suggests that the root cause for this
increased risk is a trafficking defect at the level of the early endosome. ApoE4 differs from the
most common ApoE3 isoform by a single amino acid that increases its isoelectric point and
promotes unfolding of ApoE4 upon endosomal vesicle acidification. We found that pharmacological
and genetic inhibition of NHE6, the primary proton leak channel in the early endosome, in rodents
completely reverses the ApoE4-induced recycling block of the ApoE receptor Apoer2/Lrp8 and the
AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are regulated by, and co-endocytosed in a
complex with, Apoer2. Moreover, NHE6 inhibition restores the Reelin-mediated modulation of
excitatory synapses that is impaired by ApoE4. Our findings suggest a novel potential approach for
the prevention of late-onset AD.

Introduction
Over the course of the last 30 years, we have learned much about the genetics of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD), yet the pathological mechanisms that cause the onset of the disease and that define its
progression culminating in massive neurodegeneration and debilitating dementia remain poorly
understood. We know that amyloid-b (Ab), an aggregation-prone proteolytic processing product
that consists of juxtamembrane sequences and approximately 2/3 of the transmembrane segment of
the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a central role early on, while during later stages of
the disease – through mechanisms that are completely obscure – the microtubule-associated protein
t begins to form intraneuronal aggregates, that is the neurofibrillary tangles, that can spread transsy-
naptically (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). It is this t-aggregation, not the amyloid plaques, which occur
early in the disease process, that is thought to be primarily responsible for the neuronal cell death
and brain mass loss and that most closely tracks with dementia progression. Before they become vis-
ible as the telltale plaques and tangles that cement the AD diagnosis for the pathologist, Ab and t
are present as smaller oligomeric aggregates that can directly and profoundly impair neuronal func-
tions, by disrupting synaptic Ca2+ homeostasis (Kuchibhotla et al., 2008). The resulting synaptic

 dysfunction is widely thought to represent the earliest stage of the AD pathogenic process and to
be a major cause of its clinical manifestation as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Palop and Mucke,
2010; Shankar and Walsh, 2009).
Although AD almost certainly involves early Ab accumulation, only a vanishingly small number of
individuals suffering from the vicious and dominant early-onset form of AD carry mutations in APP
(Campion et al., 1999). These missense mutations invariably increase Ab production and lead to
early plaque deposition, while a similarly small number of people have a genetic variation in APP
that lowers Ab production and hence protects from the much more frequent late-onset form of AD
(LOAD) (Jonsson et al., 2012). Numerous other genetic determinants contribute to the bulk of
LOAD, which typically develops after the 6th decade. The most important of these is Apolipoprotein
E e4 (ApoE4) genotype (Corder et al., 1993; Strittmatter et al., 1993).
ApoE is a lipid and cholesterol carrying protein that is primarily produced by the liver and is
responsible for plasma lipid homeostasis (Mahley, 1988). It occurs in three major isoforms in humans
known as ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4, with ApoE3 being the most frequent allele (~77% homozygos-
ity) followed by ApoE4 (~15 – 20% allele frequency) which is present in >50% of LOAD (Liu et al.,
2013). The effect of ApoE4 on Ab accumulation through impaired Ab turnover, increased aggrega-
tion and thus plaque formation is allele dosage-dependent and this can partly explain its effect on
the earlier age of disease onset (Corder et al., 1993). However, ApoE4 can independently impair
synapse function and Ca2+ homeostasis by disrupting the endocytic transport and recycling of synap-
tic ApoE receptors and the excitatory AMPA and NMDA type glutamate receptors that are regu-
lated by those ApoE receptors and that are consequently trapped with them in the same vesicles
(Chen et al., 2010).
eLife digest Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative condition that destroys connections between
brain cells leading to memory loss, confusion and difficulties in thinking. Apolipoprotein E is a
protein that carries fatty substances called lipids and cholesterol around the brain, and plays an
important role in repair mechanisms. There are three major forms of Apolipoprotein E, and
individuals who carry a version known as ApoE4 are up to 10 times more likely to develop
Alzheimer’s disease than those who carry other variations.
In nerve cells, or neurons, Apolipoprotein E binds to a specific family of receptors. One of these
receptors, called Apoer2, is found in the synaptic gap between neurons, where it regulates their
activities. Both Apolipoprotein E and Apoer2 are taken into the cell within compartments known as
endosomal vesicles. Usually, the Apoer2 receptor is quickly recycled back to the surface of the cell,
but this recycling process is delayed in individuals with the ApoE4 version of Apolipoprotein E.
Apoer2 is just one of many different receptors on the surface of neurons that are taken into
vesicles before being recycled back to the cell surface. The fluid inside these vesicles becomes
progressively more acidic as they move through the cell. This process helps to control the
interaction of these receptors with their binding partners and to regulate their movement and
recycling. Here, Xian, Pohlkamp et al. investigated whether changing the acidity of vesicles in rat
neurons could overcome the block in recycling Apoer2 – and other receptors that travel with Apoer2
in the same compartments – in the presence of ApoE4.
A protein called NHE6 is embedded in the membrane of vesicles called early endosomes and
acts to make the vesicles less acidic. Xian, Pohlkamp et al. used drugs to block the activity of NHE6,
which led to the vesicles becoming more acidic and allowed Apoer2 to be recycled faster. Using a
genetic approach known as siRNA knockdown to decrease the amount of NHE6 produced in
neurons also had a similar effect on Apoer2 recycling.
Together these findings suggest that drugs that make vesicles in neurons more acidic may have
the potential to help prevent individuals that carry the ApoE4 protein from developing Alzheimer’s
disease. Current drugs that target NHE6 also affect other molecules, which can often lead to side
effects. A next step will be to develop tailor-made, small molecule drugs that can enter the brain
efficiently and selectively block NHE6.

 Most ApoE receptors, which are all members of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene
family, are expressed in the brain and several are intrinsic components of excitatory synapses where
they
are
present
in
the
presynaptic
and
postsynaptic
compartments
(reviewed
in
Lane-
Donovan et al., 2014; Pohlkamp et al., 2017). Of these, ApoE receptor-2 (Apoer2, a.k.a. LRP8) is
the best characterized. It is present both pre- as well as postsynaptically where it primarily functions
as a receptor for Reelin (Bal et al., 2013; Beffert et al., 2005; Lane-Donovan and Herz, 2017).
Reelin is a large secreted protein that is essential for the formation of cortical layers during embry-
onic brain development where it serves as a guidance molecule in the regulation of neuronal migra-
tion (D’Arcangelo et al., 1995; Del Rı
´o et al., 1997). As the brain continues to develop and mature
postnatally, its expression pattern changes and Reelin is now produced by a subset of GABAergic
interneurons that are interspersed throughout the neocortex and the hippocampus (Alca
´ntara et al.,
1998; Pesold et al., 1998; Pohlkamp et al., 2014). In the adult brain, this secreted Reelin now func-
tions as a neuromodulator by signaling through Apoer2 and its closely related family member Vldlr
to activate Src-family tyrosine kinases directly in the synapse, which results in increased Ca2+ influx
through NMDA receptors and thus the robust elevation and maintenance of synaptic potentiation
(Chen et al., 2005; Hiesberger et al., 1999; Wasser and Herz, 2017). This is the key event in the
maintenance of synaptic homeostasis that is impaired by ApoE4 and which occurs independent of
Ab accumulation (Chen et al., 2005). Indeed, ApoE4-specific alterations in brain structure have been
found in <2 year old children (Dean et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2007).
The molecular basis by which ApoE4 causes the disruption of normal endosomal vesicle transport
and recycling is most likely the result of its propensity to unfold and assume a ‘molten-globule’ con-
formation upon entering an acidic environment (Morrow et al., 2002). ApoE4 differs from ApoE3
by a single amino acid, which alters its isoelectric point to coincide with the pH of ~6.5 that is pres-
ent in the early endosome (Casey et al., 2010; Ordovas et al., 1987). We hypothesized that this iso-
electric charge neutralization would make ApoE4 prone to aggregation, which could be the
molecular basis for the ApoE4-induced and gene dosage-dependent recycling defect.
pH in the early endosome is maintained by the opposing functions of the proton pump, which
decreases vesicular pH, and the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6, which increases it (Fuster and Alexander,
2014). Here, we have investigated the role of NHE6 inhibition as a means of lowering endosomal
pH, away from the isoelectric point of ApoE4. We found that this simple pharmacological interven-
tion releases the endosomal ApoE4 block, restores the normal trafficking of ApoE receptors and glu-
tamate receptors in neurons and corrects the functional defects in vitro and in vivo. These findings
suggest NHE6 inhibition as a novel rational therapeutic approach for reversing the AD risk imposed
by ApoE4.
Results
ApoE interacts and colocalizes with Apoer2 in neurons
ApoE generically interacts with cysteine-rich ligand binding-type repeats that are ubiquitously pres-
ent in all LDL receptor family members (Blacklow, 2007). We first investigated the interaction
between ApoE and its ligand-receptor Apoer2 using a solid phase interaction assay. For this pur-
pose, we used naturally secreted ApoE particles containing the three common ApoE isoforms in
humans (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4). We found that ApoE3 and ApoE4 strongly interact with
Apoer2, whereas ApoE2 binding was much weaker (Figure 1A and B). These results are consistent
with the established similarly high-affinity binding of ApoE3 and ApoE4 to the LDL receptor and the
100-fold reduced affinity of ApoE2 (Rall and Mahley, 1992; Weisgraber, 1994). Thus, Apoer2 is a
high-affinity ApoE receptor and immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons treated with GFP-
tagged ApoE3 accordingly showed co-localization of Apoer2 and ApoE3 in endosomes (Figure 1C,
Videos 1 and 2).
ApoE4 selectively reduces cell surface expression of neuronal Apoer2
We have previously reported that the presence of receptor binding competent ApoE4 particles at
physiological concentrations impairs the recycling and consequently surface expression of neuronal
Apoer2 (Chen et al., 2010). To test whether other unrelated receptors that do not interact with
ApoE may be also affected in their plasma membrane expression and recycling properties, we

 performed the cell surface biotinylation experiments outlined in Figure 2A. Briefly, primary rat corti-
cal neurons were incubated in the absence (Figure 2B, lane 1) or presence of cell-derived, naturally
secreted recombinant ApoE3 (lane 2) or ApoE4 (lane 3) particles for 1 hr at 37˚C, purified Reelin was
then added to induce the rapid endocytosis of Apoer2, and after 30 min the cells were transferred
to 4˚C and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cell surface biotinylation was performed, biotinylated proteins
were isolated and detected by immunoblotting. While Apoer2 quickly recycled in the presence of
ApoE3, its reappearance on the cell surface was greatly delayed in the presence of ApoE4
(Figure 2B,C). By contrast, other endocytic cell surface receptors that do not bind ApoE, such as the
insulin receptor (IR) or the transferrin receptor (TfR), or that do not interact with Reelin and therefore
do not undergo ligand-induced endocytosis (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(Lrp1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)), were not significantly affected by the presence of
ApoE (Figure 2B,C).
Prolonged retention and activation of Apoer2 by ApoE4
The delayed recycling of Apoer2 was also apparent by the prolonged retention of cell-derived
ApoE4 compared to cell-derived ApoE3 in Apoer2-containing intracellular compartments as shown
by co-immunoprecipitation of neuronal lysates (Figure 2D,E). That this prolonged retention may be
caused by the partial unfolding of ApoE4 is further supported by an experiment in which increasing
amounts of naturally secreted, receptor binding-competent ApoE4 particles were added to primary
cortical neurons and tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 was measured. Dab1 binds to the NPxY motif
in the cytoplasmic domain of Apoer2 and when
the receptors are clustered, for example by
interacting with Reelin, Dab1 undergoes trans-
phosphorylation
on
tyrosine
residues
(Hiesberger et al., 1999; Howell et al., 1997).
We hypothesized that ApoE4 in its molten-glob-
ule state, that is in acidic endosomes, might simi-
larly
induce
receptor
clustering
in
a
dose-
dependent manner, whereas ApoE3 would not.
When we treated primary neurons with ApoE4,
Dab1 phosphorylation was indeed increased as
expected (Figure 2F,G).
Pharmacological NHE inhibition
and acidification of vesicular pH
restores Apoer2 trafficking in the
presence of ApoE4
The pioneering work of Weisgraber and col-
leagues revealed the propensity of ApoE4 to
become structurally labile and undergo transfor-
mation to a molten-globule state in a low pH
environment, while ApoE2 and ApoE3 were far
more resistant to low pH-induced unfolding
(Morrow et al., 2002). In addition, we noticed
that the isoelectric point (IEP) of ApoE4 lies

 (Figure 3A). Many proteins are known to lose
hydrophilicity near their IEP. Indeed, the first
purification of insulin depended upon this bio-
physical
phenomenon
(Wintersteiner
and
Abramson, 1933). We thus hypothesized that
the structural lability of ApoE4, combined with a
reduced solubility in the acidic endosomal envi-
ronment, might be a driver for the resulting recy-
cling block. pH regulation in the endosome is
achieved by a combination of two primary mech-
anisms: the activity of the proton pump, that is
v-ATPase and the exchange of protons for Na+
or K+ through the activity of Na+/H+ exchangers
(NHEs) (Figure 3B). Functional disruption of the
endosomal NHE6 isoform thus lowers endoso-
mal pH (Brett et al., 2002) and would be pre-
dicted to restore ApoE4 solubility and thus
vesicle trafficking (Figure 3C).
NHE6-specific
inhibitors

not
presently
exist, however, there is a large number of inhibi-
tors for the abundant NHE1 isoform, which is
expressed on the plasma membrane of most cell
types
and
which
regulates
cytosolic
pH
(Masereel et al., 2003). NHE1 inhibitors, such as
the epithelial sodium channel blocker and guani-
dinium derivative amiloride, have been used in
clinical practice for half a century as diuretics,
and numerous analogues have been developed over the years. We reasoned that some of these ana-
logues might cross-inhibit NHE6 and thus decided to test them in our Apoer2 recycling assay. We
found several amiloride analogues to be effective at restoring Apoer2 recycling and chose
EMD87580 for detailed analysis (Figure 4A). Increasing concentrations progressively restored nor-
mal surface recycling of Apoer2 in the presence of ApoE4 (Figure 4B,C). As shown in Figure 4D
and E, physiological concentrations of ApoE3 (5 mg/ml) also impaired Apoer2 recycling to a small,
but significant extent. This was also prevented by EMD87580 at the same concentration (3 mM) at
which the effect of ApoE4 on Apoer2 recycling was completely neutralized (Figure 4D,E), suggest-
ing that ApoE3 also, although to a minor extent, may lose solubility upon entering the early endo-
some, and that this is also prevented by pH lowering. To confirm that the effect of the NHE inhibitor
was caused by altering the pH and not by an unrelated mode of action we did the converse experi-
ment. We incubated the neurons with ApoE4 in the presence of 3 mM EMD87580 and increasing
concentrations of Bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the proton pump. Figure 4F and G show that the
resulting increase of the endosomal pH reverses the correction of the ApoE4 recycling deficit by
EMD87580 and results in renewed impairment of Apoer2 trafficking. This was further confirmed by
an additional experiment in which we incubated the neurons in the presence of a fixed concentration
of ApoE4 in the presence or absence of 50 nM Bafilomycin. In the presence of this partial inhibition
of proton pump activity, higher concentrations of EMD87580 were required to restore normal
Apoer2 recycling (Figure 4H) as evident by the right-shift of the dose-response curve (Figure 4I).
Taken together, these data show that vesicular pH is the primary driving factor that determines to
what extent ApoE4 alters endosomal trafficking.
shRNA knockdown of NHE6 is sufficient to restore normal Apoer2
trafficking
More than 10 different NHEs exist in mammals (Fuster and Alexander, 2014), which function in
intracellular, organellar and extracellular pH regulation in all cells of the body and in a variety of
organs. EMD87580, as most other commercially available NHE inhibitors, was developed with the
goal of inhibiting NHE1 (Chen et al., 2004) and its ability to cross inhibit other NHE forms is
unknown. Because ApoE4 blocks Apoer2 and glutamate receptor recycling, and the early endosome

 is the first acidic organelle ApoE4 encounters during endocytosis, we suspected that the effect of
EMD87580 to restore normal receptor trafficking is due to NHE6 inhibition. However, we could not
exclude that other vesicular NHEs, in particular the NHE9, which resides in the Golgi and the late
endosome, participate in the release of the recycling block. To determine whether NHE6 inhibition
is sufficient to restore normal Apoer2 recycling, we used shRNAs designed against all the vesicular
NHEs present in intracellular compartments which ApoE and Apoer2 might encounter during their
passage through the recycling pathway. Figure 5A–D shows that of all NHEs (1 and 5 through 9)
that were targeted by shRNA inhibition, only NHE6-specific shRNAs were able to completely restore
Apoer2 expression at the plasma membrane in the presence of ApoE4 (Figure 5A, lane 6, 5C, lanes
8, 10, 12, and quantified in Panels B and D). Three different shRNAs directed against NHE6 were
used in Figure 5C and D. None of the shRNAs directed against NHE1, 5, 7, 8 or 9 had any effect on
surface Apoer2 expression, neither in the absence of ApoE4 or in its presence.
shRNA knockdown of NHE6 restores normal trafficking of Apoer2,
AMPA and NMDA receptors in the presence of ApoE4
Next, we determined whether shRNA-mediated inhibition of NHE6 function would also restore the
normal recycling of AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptors in primary neurons treated with
ApoE4 and Reelin. Three different shRNAs which efficiently reduced NHE6 protein expression by at
least 90% (Figure 6A) and a scrambled control shRNA were used in the receptor surface recycling
assay (Figure 6B, lanes 4 – 8). Pharmacological inhibition of NHE function with EMD87580 was used
as a control (lane 3). EMD87580 and the NHE6-specific shRNAs completely restored Apoer2 and
glutamate receptor surface expression, while the scrambled shRNA had no effect (Panel B and quan-
tified in Panels C-F). These findings suggested that NHE6 inhibition might be effective in restoring a
normal synaptic response in ApoE4 targeted replacement mice, which we have previously shown are
completely resistant to long-term potentiation (LTP) enhancement by Reelin (Chen et al., 2010;
Lane-Donovan et al., 2014).
Pharmacological NHE inhibition restores Reelin-enhanced LTP in the
presence of ApoE4
To test if restored glutamate receptor trafficking by NHE6 inhibition improves synapse function, we
measured hippocampal LTP in acute slices of human ApoE targeted replacement mice: ApoE3-
knockin (ApoE3-KI) and ApoE4-knockin (ApoE4-KI). Mice were treated with or without EMD87580
by simultaneous intraperitoneal and intranasal application, the brains were subsequently harvested
and electrophysiological field recordings were performed. We chose to complement the intraperito-
neal injections with intranasal delivery since EMD87580, as all existing guanidine-based NHEs, have
poor blood-brain-barrier penetration and intranasal delivery of small molecules and peptides includ-
ing insulin has been shown to increase their biological effect in the brain (Grassin-Delyle et al.,
2012). Consistent with previous results (Ro
¨nicke et al., 2009), we found that EMD87580 increased
input-output (I/O) ratios in the ApoE3-KI mice (Figure 7A). In the ApoE4-KI mice, baseline I/O ratios

on LTP in ApoE4-KI slices (Figure 7D). In contrast to ApoE3-KI, ApoE4-KI slices treated with
EMD87580 exhibited reduced LTP. Importantly, ApoE4-KI slices with EMD87580 readily responded
to Reelin, and LTP was increased. Therefore, on the ApoE4 knockin background, EMD87580 restores
electrophysiological parameters comparable to the ApoE3 and wild-type background.
NHE inhibition counteracts Ab-induced LTP suppression in ApoE4-KI
mice
These data suggest that endosomal NHE inhibition can neutralize the effect of ApoE4 on vesicle traf-
ficking and concomitant synaptic dysfunction. Can it also reverse the persistent synaptic suppression
caused by oligomeric b-amyloid in the presence of ApoE4? Ab42 oligomers potently suppress synap-
tic potentiation (Townsend et al., 2006), but this can be averted by preincubation of hippocampal
slices with Reelin, which can by itself potentiate the synapse and thus counteract the Ab induced
suppression (Durakoglugil et al., 2009). In Figure 8, we repeated these experiments again in the
absence as well as in the presence of EMD87580. As we had found previously, AD patient brain
extracts containing Ab oligomers, but not control brain extracts, potently suppressed LTP in hippo-
campal slices from ApoE3-KI and in ApoE4-KI mice. Reelin prevented this suppression in the ApoE3
slices, while the slices from ApoE4 mice were almost completely resistant to Reelin and LTP
remained suppressed (Figure 8, solid triangles in Panels A and B). By striking contrast, this LTP sup-
pression in the presence of Ab and Reelin in ApoE4 slices was completely abolished when the slices
were perfused with EMD87580 for 4 hr prior to LTP induction. In data not shown here we observed
at 30-min preperfusion with EMD87580 a trend toward alleviating the ApoE4-mediated Reelin resis-
tance that was, however, not yet significant. This may suggest that relief of the ApoE4 endosomal
recycling block requires some time, perhaps to ‘flush out’ the vesicles that are already stuck and
clog up the recycling route.
Discussion
We have used insights into the molecular structure and biophysical properties of ApoE isoforms to
develop a novel rational drug identification approach to reverse the increased AD risk inherent to
the ApoE4 allele. In earlier studies, we found that ApoE4 impairs endosomal vesicle recycling
(Chen et al., 2010). While investigating the molecular basis for this trafficking delay, we recognized
that the predicted isoelectric point of ApoE4 closely matches the prevailing pH in the early endo-
some. We hypothesized that ApoE4, which is known to assume a molten-globule state under low pH
conditions, might lose solubility as it enters the lower pH environment of the early endosome. This in
turn could impair vesicle propagation through the endosomal recycling pathway and result in the
observed sequestration of ApoE receptors and associated excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in
cortical neurons (Chen et al., 2010). We predicted that changing endosomal pH away from the iso-
electric point of ApoE4 should prevent this isoelectric precipitation and resolve the recycling block.
Since raising endosomal pH using alkalinizing agents, such as ammonium chloride or chloroquine, is
known to arrest endosomal trafficking by preventing lipoprotein release from lipoprotein receptors
(Goldstein et al., 1985), we investigated approaches to lower endosomal pH instead. Two possible
mechanisms for this are i) activation of the proton pump, or ii) preventing proton efflux from the
endosome by inhibiting the endosomal sodium/potassium hydrogen exchanger NHE6. Our results
now show that pharmacological as well as genetic inhibition of NHE activity in the early endosome is
Figure 3 continued
Endosomal pH is regulated by the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (vATPase, proton pump) and organellar Na+/H
+ exchangers (NHEs, proton leak). After binding to ApoE4, Apoer2 undergoes endocytosis, is sequestered in
endosomes and recycling is delayed. (C) Endosomal ApoE4/Apoer2 resolve when the pH is lowered further.
Accelerated acidification through NHE6 inhibition activity promotes dissociation of ApoE4 and Apoer2, resulting
in the efficient recycling of Apoer2 back to cell plasma membrane.

 sufficient to completely resolve the ApoE4 induced endosomal recycling block and restore the nor-
mal cell surface recycling rate of the synaptic ApoE receptor Apoer2 and the excitatory AMPA- and
NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are regulated by Apoer2 and that traffic together with Apoer2
through the endosomal recycling compartments (illustrated by the model shown in Figure 9).
Previously, we and others have shown that ApoE4-KI mice exhibit enhanced LTP while the neuro-
modulator Reelin has no potentiating effect on LTP expression in this genotype (Durakoglugil et al.,
2009), suggesting that ApoE4 impairs the physiological response to Reelin. Here, we show that NHE
inhibition with EMD87580 in ApoE4-KI mice reverses the ApoE4 induced Reelin resistance (Figure 7)
and restores the ability of Reelin to protect against Ab toxicity (Figure 8). ApoE3-KI slices treated
with EMD87580 exhibit increased LTP consistent with previous findings that have shown that the
NHE inhibitor ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) can enhance theta-burst-induced LTP (Ro
¨nicke et al.,
2009). NHE activity was proposed to be a negative feedback mechanism that can regulate neuronal
excitability as well as plasticity. In ApoE4-KI mice, EMD87580 decreased LTP to baseline levels of
control ApoE3-KI mice and importantly LTP became now responsive to Reelin-facilitation. This obser-
vation suggests that it is the restoration of normal release of ApoE4 from Apoer2 in acidified endo-
somal compartments and the subsequent normalization of endosomal trafficking that reestablishes
optimal synaptic homeostasis in the presence of ApoE4.
Although more than 20 genetic loci that modify the risk for late-onset AD have been discovered
to date (Karch et al., 2014), ApoE4 genotype is by far the major genetic risk factor for late-onset
AD besides aging, affecting almost 1/5th of the human population, and hence it is clinically the most
important one. The molecular mechanisms by which ApoE4 imposes this risk remain under debate.
Early work following the seminal discovery of this striking genetic association by the Roses group
(Corder et al., 1993) focused on the differential ability of ApoE isoforms to interact with Ab and
affect fibril formation. Efforts in our own laboratory were based on the rationale that ApoE recep-
tors, that is the LDL receptor gene family, are highly likely to be involved in the disease process. This
hypothesis was the initial driver that defined a plethora of surprising functions of LDL receptor-
related proteins (LRPs) in the central and peripheral nervous system (Bal et al., 2013; Beffert et al.,
2005; Bell et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2008; Lane-Donovan and Herz, 2017;

Pohlkamp et al., 2015; Pohlkamp et al., 2017; Trommsdorff et al., 1999; Wasser and Herz,
2017; Wasser et al., 2014; Weeber et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2017). They
included unprecedented roles as direct signal-transducing receptors (Hiesberger et al., 1999;
Trommsdorff et al., 1999) and regulators of central and peripheral synaptic transmission
(Beffert et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2013; Weeber et al., 2002) and have established a strong ratio-
nale and mechanistic basis by which ApoE isoforms and ApoE receptors can directly affect synaptic
homeostasis, neuronal survival and thus the cognitive impairment and progressive neurodegenera-
tion that underlie LOAD.
Presynaptic and postsynaptic vesicle recycling is a central element of synaptic transmission
(Harris et al., 2012; Kawasaki et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 1993; Sontag et al., 1994; Sud-
hof, 2004). Intriguingly, enlarged endosomal compartments and impaired endolysosomal functions
are also a prominent feature of APP expression, processing and early AD (Cataldo et al., 2000;
Decourt et al., 2013; Ishigaki et al., 2000; Nixon et al., 2001; Salehi et al., 2006). Our original

 possibly also presynaptic) recycling vesicles that contain ApoE receptors was inspired by the original
observations of Heeren, Beisiegel and colleagues who first described a prolonged intracellular reten-
tion of ApoE4 in a hepatoma cell line (Heeren et al., 2004). In a series of experiments, we showed
that ApoE4 impairs NMDA receptor activation and neuronal Ca2+ conductance by the neuromodula-
tor and ApoE receptor ligand Reelin. This was caused by the dramatically delayed recycling of the
Reelin receptor and regulator of glutamate receptor trafficking Apoer2 in the presence of ApoE4
and, notably, also to a smaller extent by ApoE3 and less by ApoE2 (Chen et al., 2010). The

 dramatically altered recycling kinetics in the presence of ApoE4 lead to an altered state of synaptic
homeostasis, which we have termed ‘Reelin resistance’ (Lane-Donovan et al., 2014) and which pre-
vents the synapse from adequately adapting to the rising levels of synapse-suppressing Ab oligom-
ers as they accumulate in the aging brain. The compensatory increase in synaptic and network
activity (Palop and Mucke, 2010) would further drive Ab production (Cirrito et al., 2008), thereby
accelerating a self-reinforcing cycle that would be predicted to contribute to the earlier amyloid
accumulation in ApoE4 carriers. Moreover, a second mechanism by which impaired ApoE4-contain-
ing vesicle recycling would be predicted to contribute to accelerated amyloid accumulation and pla-
que deposition (Fagan et al., 2002) involves the reduced turnover rate of Ab in the brains of ApoE4
targeted replacement mice (Castellano et al., 2011) and humans (Wildsmith et al., 2012).
Recently, the Bu laboratory reported a direct interaction of ApoE with insulin receptors in the
brain, which also resulted in their intracellular retention and impaired insulin signaling (Zhao et al.,
2017). Although in our experiments we did not detect impaired insulin receptor trafficking
(Figure 2B and C), and there is also no evidence that ApoE4 carriers are predisposed to the pre-
dicted insulin resistance that would be expected to result from intracellular insulin receptor trapping,
these data add nevertheless further support to our model which postulates impaired neuronal endo-
somal vesicle trafficking as the root cause for the increased AD risk imposed by ApoE4 (Chen et al.,
2005; Chen et al., 2010; Lane-Donovan and Herz, 2017; Lane-Donovan et al., 2014).
Our data indicate that ApoE4 induces endosomal trafficking deficits. Consistently, alkalinizing
drugs, such as ammonium chloride or chloroquine, which increase vesicular pH in the cell, lead to an
arrest
of
endosomal
trafficking
by
preventing
lipoprotein
release
from
their
receptors
(Goldstein et al., 1985). We therefore chose to explore the effect of acidification of endosomes as a
means to overcome the trafficking impairments caused by ApoE4. By contrast, a recent study in
astrocytes has proposed that the presence of ApoE4 results in endosomal acidification caused by
NHE6 reduction, leading to impaired Ab-clearance (Prasad and Rao, 2018). These authors further
reported that increased NHE6 expression, which would elevate endosomal pH, induced by HDAC-
inhibition alleviated the impaired of Ab-clearance.
We show here that Ab-induced synaptic impairment could be abolished by the NHE inhibitor
EMD87580 (Figure 8). Both studies show that manipulation of endosomal pH can affect the endoso-
mal trafficking of ApoE. We show that in neurons this alters cell surface Apoer2 expression levels
and thus synaptic plasticity. Prasad and Rao (2018) showed that in astrocytes a similar mechanism
may mediate Ab clearance involving the ApoE receptor Lrp1. The isoelectric point of ApoE4, but not
ApoE2 and ApoE3, matches the physiological pH present in early endosomes and reduced solubility
at or near their isoelectric point is a general property of many proteins including insulin
(Wintersteiner and Abramson, 1933). In contrast to ApoE2 and ApoE3, the conformation of ApoE4
in the early endosome might be particularly vulnerable, because it alone has been shown to be
prone to unfolding under low pH conditions resulting in a molten-globule state (Morrow et al.,
2002).
Along the same lines, ApoE4 increased the number and size of early endosomes in AD patients
(Cataldo et al., 2000) and in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (Lin et al., 2018).
These data suggest that manipulating endosomal pH represents a promising therapeutic target to
improve endosomal trafficking deficits induced by ApoE4.
In order to fully address the physiological functions of NHE6 and understand its role in ApoE4
induced neurodegenerative processes, it will be necessary to develop NHE6 specific inhibitors that
can pharmacologically modulate NHE6 - as opposed to switching it on or off in a binary fashion - to
achieve the optimal pH for ApoE4 trafficking without undue interference with essential cellular

 transport processes or the function of other NHEs. Such inhibitors must also be capable of crossing
the blood brain barrier, something the presently available non-specific inhibitor classes are incapable
of doing.
In summary, we have shown that the conformational change of ApoE4 to a molten-globule state
(Morrow et al., 2002) in a low pH environment, which correlates with the impaired endosomal vesi-
cle recycling in the presence of ApoE4 (Chen et al., 2010; Heeren et al., 2004; Lane-Donovan and
Herz, 2017; Lane-Donovan et al., 2014; Rellin et al., 2008), can be reversed by changing endoso-
mal pH (Herz et al., 2010). As a mechanistic basis we propose the propensity of many proteins to
lose hydrophilicity at or near their isoelectric point, which makes them prone to aggregation and
precipitation, a seminal discovery that made the purification of insulin on an industrial scale possible
(Wintersteiner and Abramson, 1933). By altering endosomal pH, ApoE4 maintains its solubility and
the recycling block is avoided. This simple biophysical property can explain in a straightforward man-
ner many observations by which ApoE isoforms differentially affect neuronal functions and AD-rele-
vant mechanisms. Our findings also point toward NHE6-specific inhibitors as a rational basis for a
novel approach to erase the AD risk imposed by ApoE4.

NMDAR tyrosine phosphorylation by activating tyrosine phosphatases. This panel has been reproduced from Chen et al. (2010). (B) When NHE6 (red)
is functioning normally, early endosomal pH is maintained at ~6.5 by the action of the proton pump and proton leakage through NHE6. This pH level is
close to the isoelectric point (pI) of ApoE4, which is particularly sensitive to structural unfolding into a molten globule state upon entering acidic
compartments (Morrow et al., 2002). The resulting reduced solubility may hamper efficient release of ApoE4 from its receptors (such as Apoer2 in
neurons). Upon NHE6 inhibition, endosomal pH is further reduced, resulting in the release of ApoE4 from its receptors through improved solubility and
the repulsion forces proteins exert upon each other when the pH is below their pI. Thus, trafficking and recycling of Apoer2 and the neurotransmitter
receptors it associates with is restored. It should be noted that this property of ApoE4 to undergo impaired trafficking through endosomal
compartments is universal and not restricted to neurons. Therefore, NHE6 inhibition may also aid in the clearance of amyloid-b in the brain and LDL
removal in the liver.

Neuroscience
 Human cortical brain extracts
Deidentified human cortical brain extracts (IRB exempt) from a non-AD, normal subject (Control) and
a clinically and histopathologically confirmed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) case were prepared as
described previously (Durakoglugil et al., 2009). Briefly, control brain extract contained monomeric
Ab, but no detectable oligomers and only a trace amount of higher order aggregates; by contrast,
AD brain extract contained monomeric Ab in addition to Ab dimers and higher order aggregates.
One gram of brain tissue was homogenized in 4 ml of Tris buffered saline and centrifuged at
175,000 x g as described by Shankar et al. (2008). The supernatant was designated ‘extract’. The
genotype of the brain tissue was ApoE3/3 for the control and ApoE3/4 for the AD tissue.
Primary neurons
Primary rat (Sprague-Dawley) cortical neurons (E18) were prepared as described previously
(Chen et al., 2005) and cultured in six-well plates (1 million neurons/9 cm2) or on Poly-D-Lysine
coated coverslips (30,000 neurons/1.1 cm2) in Neurobasal/B27 medium at 37˚C and 5% CO2. At 9–
14 days in vitro (DIV) primary neurons were used for experiments.
Plasmid constructs
All primers used for cloning are listed in the Key Resources Table.
pcDNA3.1-Apoer2-Fc: The mouse ApoER2-Fc construct (secreted Apoer2 ectodomain), tagged
with the V5 epitope and Fc, was described previously (Hiesberger et al., 1999). To produce recom-
binant Apoer2-Fc, HEK 293 cells were transfected and the medium was harvested as described
(Chen et al., 2010).
pLKO.1-shRNA constructs: pLKO.1-constructs containing shRNA targeting different NHE sub-
types were purchased from Sigma or created by inserting aligned oligos (for shRNA sequence refer
to Key Resources Table) into the pLKO.1-TRC, as described elsewhere (Moffat et al., 2006). pLVX-
mCherry-Apoer2: SalI and XbaI cloning sites were inserted into a plasmid containing the Apoer2 full-
length cDNA immediately downstream of the Apoer2 signal peptide (N-terminus, NT) by site-
directed mutagenesis. In a second step, PCR-amplified mCherry was inserted into the newly created
SalI and XbaI sites. NT-mCherry-Apoer2 was then amplified by PCR and cloned into the NheI and
EcoRI sites of lentiviral vector that was generated by modifying pLVXCMV100 by removing an NheI
site through site-directed mutagenesis and replacing the truncated CMV100 with a full length CMV
promoter (inserted into the ClaI and NheI sites). pcDNA3.1-ApoE3-GFP: ApoE3 was PCR-amplified
and inserted into pEGFP-N1 using EcoR1 and BamHI cloning sites.
Generation of recombinant proteins
Reelin
HEK 293 cells stably expressing Reelin (pCrl) were cultured in DMEM medium (D’Arcangelo et al.,
1995; Fo
¨rster et al., 1998). Medium containing Reelin was harvested and purified as described pre-
viously (Weeber et al., 2002). Authenticated by their ability to secrete Reelin. Mycoplasma status
ascertained annually, last negative result after submission of this manuscript.
The ApoE used in this study was contained in lipoprotein particles naturally secreted from trans-
fected cells in a minimally lipidated state and produced as follows: HEK 293 cells were transfected
(FuGENE) with pcDNA3.1 vector containing full length human ApoE (ApoE2, ApoE3, ApoE4,
ApoE4P, mutant ApoE3, or mutant ApoE4) cDNA or empty pcDNA3.1 (control). 24 hr post-transfec-
tion DMEM medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium. After 3 days, the medium containing
the different ApoE isoforms was collected and analyzed on SDS-PAGE to calculate ApoE concentra-
tions using commercial human ApoE3 as a standard. The proteins were immunoblotted for ApoE
and detected with IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (Li-Cor). ApoE levels were quantified Odyssey
infrared imaging.
Western blots
After treatment, neurons were washed three times with cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; phosphatase and protease inhibitors) for 20 min
on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4˚C in an Eppen-
dorff centrifuge. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).

Neuroscience
 After adding 4x SDS loading buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, 10%
glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) the samples were boiled at 95˚C for 10 min. For immunoblot-
ting of NHE6, samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature instead of boiling. 4x SDS
loading buffer was added to the media to detect secreted proteins. After boiling (95˚C for 10 min)
samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for
western blotting with the indicated antibodies.
Confocal microscopy
For imaging DIV9 neurons on 12 mm coverslips were infected with lentiviral DNA encoding NT-
mCherry-Apoer2. Lentivirus containing medium was removed 14 hr after infection. On DIV12
ApoE3-GFP containing supernatant of 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-ApoE3-GFP (FuGENE)
was added. On DIV13 neurons were washed 2x with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA. Coverslips were
mounted using Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI. Z-stack images were obtained
using a Confocal Zeiss LSM880 Airyscan microscope and a 63x objective and a step size of 1 mm. 3D
projections and orthogonal views were generated using NIH Fiji/ImageJ software.
Surface biotinylation/Apoer2 recycling
Primary neurons were pre-treated for 30 min with ApoE-conditioned medium (5 mg/ml unless stated
differently), then incubated with Reelin (2 mg/ml) for an additional 30 min (see timeline in
Figure 2A). After treatment cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated in PBS containing sulfo-
NHS-SS-biotin (1.0 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4˚C. Excess reagent was quenched by rinsing the neurons
with cold PBS containing 100 mM glycine. Neurons were lysed in 160 ml/9 cm2 lysis buffer (PBS with
0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) at 4˚C for 20 min. Cell debris was removed by
centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4˚C in an Eppendorff centrifuge. The protein concentra-
tion was measured using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and 100 mg of total protein was incu-
bated with 50 ml of NeutrAvidin agarose at 4˚C for 1 hr. Agarose pellets were washed three times
using washing buffer (500 mM NaCl; 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.5% Triton X-100), biotinylated sur-
face proteins were eluted from agarose beads by boiling in 2x SDS sample loading buffer and
loaded on SDS-PAGE for western blot analysis. For drug treatments, cells were pre-incubated with
EMD87580 and/or Bafilomycin for 1 hr prior to ApoE and Reelin addition. 3 mM EMD87580 (3 mM
stock in PBS) was used unless stated differently.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Apoer2-Fc/ApoE interaction: Protein G Sepharose (50 ml) was added to 1 ml culture supernatant
containing ApoER2-Fc from HEK 293 cells at 4˚C overnight. Beads were then sedimented by brief
centrifugation, and then 500 ml culture supernatant containing ApoE and CaCl2 (final concentration 1
mM) was added to the beads. The mixture was incubated for an additional 4 hr at 4˚C. Beads were
washed three times using washing buffer (500 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris.HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100
(pH8.0)), and bound proteins were separated on 4 – 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for ApoE.
Apoer2-ApoE interaction: ApoE-treated (5 mg/ml for 3 hr at 37˚C) neurons were washed with ice
cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. For immunoprecipitation 600 mg of lysate were co-incubated with
anti-Apoer2 rabbit serum or control rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads at 4˚C overnight.
Precipitated beads were washed 3x in RIPA buffer, resuspended in 2x SDS sample buffer and boiled
at 95˚C for 10 min. Eluted proteins were probed for Apoer2 and ApoE.
Dab1 phosphorylation
Primary neurons were treated with Reelin (2 mg/ml for 30 min) or ApoE3 or ApoE4 at 37˚C for 3 hr.
After treatment, neurons were lysed and prepared for western blotting as described above and
probed with antibodies raised against total Dab1 and phospho-Tyrosine (4G10) to identify phospho-
Dab1 (Masereel et al., 2003).
Preparation of lentiviral particles
HEK 293 T cells were co-transfected with psPAX2, pMD2.G, and the individual transfer constructs
(pLKO.1-shRNA or pLVX-mCherry-Apoer2). Media was replaced after 12 – 15 hr. Viral particle con-
taining media was collected and cell debris spun down. The virus was concentrated by ultra-

 centrifugation and re-suspension in DMEM (1/10th volume). To transfect neurons 100 ml of concen-
trated virus was added per ml of medium in the culture dish. Transduction media were replaced
12 – 15 hr after infection and neurons were incubated for 3 days before experiments were
conducted.
In vivo EMD87580 treatment
For in vivo treatment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with EMD87580 (1 mg/ml in PBS) at a
dose of 5 mg/kg. Additionally, mice received intranasal application of 10 ml of 1 mg/ml EMD87580.
Animals were treated twice a day for 2 consecutive days (in the morning and evening, 12 hr interval).
On the third day, mice were treated with EMD87580 in the morning and sacrificed 2 hr later for
extracellular field recordings of hippocampal slices.
Extracellular field recordings
Hippocampal slices were prepared from 2 to 3 months old ApoE3-KI or ApoE4-KI mice. Brains were
quickly removed and placed in cold high sucrose cutting solution (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM NaCl, 3
mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 28 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 0.6 mM Ascorbic acid,
7 mM MgSO4). 400 mm transverse sections were cut using a vibratome. Slices were then transferred
into an incubation chamber containing 50% aCSF (124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26
mM NaHCO3, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4) and 50% sucrose cutting solution. For
electrophysiological recordings a final concentration of 3 mM EMD87580 was used. For combined
treatment with Reelin, AD brain extract and EMD87580 (Figure 8), slices were pretreated with
EMD87580 for 3 hr and that concentration was maintained during recording in the presence or
absence of Reelin and/or AD extract. Slices were transferred to the interface recording chamber
where they were kept in aCSF at 31˚C and a flow rate of 2 – 3 ml/min. In the recording chamber, dif-
ferent combinations of treatment with AD brain extract, Reelin, and EMD87580 were used. Slices
were perfused with the different final components for an additional ~30 min until they stabilized in
the recording chamber before application of theta burst stimulation and one hour thereafter
throughout the recording period. For stimulation concentric bipolar electrodes were used (FHC, Cat-
alog no CBBRC75, 1201 Main St Bowdoin, ME 04287, USA) and placed into the stratum radiatum.
Stimulus intensity was set at 40 – 60% maximum response and delivered through an Isolated Pulse
Stimulator (A-M Systems, Model 2100. A custom written program in Labview 7.0 was used for
recording and analysis of LTP experiments (courtesy of Dr Jay Gibson). A theta burst (TBS; train of 4
pulses at 100 Hz repeated 10 times with 200 ms intervals and again repeated 5 times at 10 s inter-
vals) was used as conditioning stimulus. For input/output analysis data were binned and fitted line-
arly. Slopes were calculated using regression analysis.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM and evaluated using two-tailed Student’s t test for two
groups with one variable tested and equal variances, or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Dunnett’s post-hoc for multiple groups with only variable tested. The differences were considered to
be significant at p<0.05 (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).
