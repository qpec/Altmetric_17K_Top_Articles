ABSTRACT
In this study, we characterize the area and personal air concentrations of combustion byproducts
produced during controlled residential fires with furnishings common in 21st century single family
structures. Area air measurements were collected from the structure during active fire and over-
haul (post suppression) and on the fireground where personnel were operating without any respi-
ratory protection. Personal air measurements were collected from firefighters assigned to fire attack,
victim search, overhaul, outside ventilation, and command/pump operator positions. Two different
fire attack tactics were conducted for the fires (6 interior and 6 transitional) and exposures were
compared between the tactics. For each of the 12 fires, firefighters were paired up to conduct each
job assignment, except for overhaul that was conducted by 4 firefighters. Sampled compounds
included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g., benzene),
hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and particulate (area air sampling only). Median personal air concentrations
for the attack and search firefighters were generally well above applicable short-term occupational
exposure limits, with the exception of HCN measured from search firefighters. Area air concentrations
of all measured compounds decreased after suppression. Personal air concentrations of total PAHs
and benzene measured from some overhaul firefighters exceeded exposure limits. Median personal
air concentrations of HCN (16,300 ppb) exceeded the exposure limit for outside vent firefighters, with
maximum levels (72,900 ppb) higher than the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level.
Median air concentrations on the fireground (including particle count) were above background levels
and highest when collected downwind of the structure and when ground-level smoke was the heav-
iest. No statistically significant differences in personal air concentrations were found between the 2
attack tactics. The results underscore the importance of wearing self-contained breathing apparatus
when conducting overhaul or outside ventilation activities. Firefighters should also try to establish
command upwind of the structure fire, and if this cannot be done, respiratory protection should be
considered.
Introduction
Two of the most pressing health concerns in the fire
service are sudden cardiac events and cancer. Sudden
cardiac events are the leading cause of on-duty deaths
in the fire service, accounting for 42% of such fatalities
in the last 10 years.[1] For every on-duty sudden cardiac
death, almost 17 non-fatal cardiac events occur during or
immediately after firefighting work.[2] The risk of sudden
cardiac death is 10–100 times higher during fire suppres-
sion responses than non-emergency events, and this risk

remains elevated (2- to 10-fold) during the recovery time
after a response.[3,4]
A combination of factors increases the risk of a sudden
cardiac event during fire suppression activities, including
physical exertion, strenuous work, heat stress, dehydra-
tion, and emotional stress. These stressors when coupled
with underlying morbidity, could result in pathological
changes increasing the risk of thrombosis, plaque rupture,
or arrhythmia.[2] This risk may be further compounded
by exposure to pollutants on the fireground, such as

particulate and chemical asphyxiants. The mechanistic
role that air pollutants play in triggering a cardiovascular
event is not well understood,[5] but numerous epidemio-
logic studies have consistently shown strong associations
between elevations in ambient fine particulate concen-
trations and increases in hospital admissions (morbidity)
and mortality rates in the general population.[6–8]
A number of epidemiologic studies have found
an increased risk for specific types of cancer in
firefighters.[9–12] Daniels et al.[13] found a dose-response
relationship between fire-runs and leukemia mortality
and between fire-hours and lung cancer mortality and
incidence. In 2010, the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) classified occupational exposure as a
firefighter as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group
2B),[14] and this determination was made before many
of the aforementioned epidemiology studies.[9–13] Like
cardiovascular disease, numerous risk factors exist for
different types of cancer. The plethora of chemical expo-
sures encountered during fire responses is certainly one
factor that may increase firefighters’risk of cancer.
The primary goal of this study was to gain a better
understanding of the time-course in the evolution, trans-
port, and dissipation of airborne contaminants during
realistic residential fire responses. Fire smoke is a complex
mixture of substances and varies depending on the fuel
being burned, combustion temperature, and ventilation
conditions.[15,16] Toxic substances identified in fire smoke
in the United States include polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), poly-
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, plasticizers, flame
retardants, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen cyanide
(HCN), hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen
oxides, sulfur dioxide, heavy metals, asbestos, and other
respirable particulates.[16–26] Many of these compounds
are known or potential human carcinogens and/or have
important cardiovascular implications. Some compounds
(e.g., CO, formaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, nitrogen diox-
ide, sulfur dioxide) have been measured during overhaul
of structure fires at concentrations exceeding short-term
exposure limits (STELs) or ceiling limits.[27] Overhaul is
the period of the response after fire suppression when
firefighters search for any residual flames or smoldering
items. Historically, firefighters might remove their SCBA
during overhaul because of the weight and increased heat
stress associated with wearing this respiratory protection.
In recent years, many departments have begun to require
SCBA use during overhaul. Still, many departments are
seeking guidance on when conditions are such that res-
piratory protection may no longer be necessary in an
attempt to balance firefighter’
s risk for chemical exposure
and heat stress.[30]
More work is needed to fully characterize the haz-
ardous atmospheres encountered by firefighters. The
materials found in 21st century buildings and furnishings
are increasingly synthetic and can generate many toxic
combustion byproducts when they burn.[15,16,28] We are
not aware of any study that has investigated the magnitude
of airborne contaminants over each phase of the response,
the effects that firefighting tactics have on potential expo-
sures, or airborne exposures by job assignment. In addi-
tion, the literature is void of information on the potential
airborne exposures to personnel on the fireground who
are not directly engaged with the fire building (e.g., pump
operator, incident commander, and paramedics). These
personnel rarely, if ever, wear respiratory protection, even
though it is certainly possible that they could be exposed
to smoke from the fire or diesel exhaust (IARC Group 1
carcinogen)[29] from the apparatus.
The purpose of this study was to measure the air con-
centrations of combustion byproducts (i.e., PAHs, VOCs,
HCN, and acid gases) and particulate produced during
residential fires involving modern furnishings and sup-
pressed with two different firefighting tactics in a con-
trolled setting (at a firefighting training ground). Mea-
surements were collected from the structure during active
fire and overhaul, as well as on the fireground (near the
apparatus). Personal air samples were also collected from
operating firefighters in each job assignment and those
results are provided to compare among jobs, tactics used,
and to put the area air measurements into perspective.
Data on environmental conditions (e.g., wind direction
and ground level smoke) were also collected to explore
their effect on the air concentrations on the fireground.
Methods

This

performed
at
the
University
of
Illinois Fire Service Institute (IFSI) with collabora-
tion from the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) and Underwriters Laboratories
(UL) Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI). The
study design is described in detail elsewhere.[25,30,31]
Briefly, using a repeated-measures design, study partic-
ipants were grouped into 6 crews of 12 firefighters and
each crew was deployed to a pair of fire scenarios using
2 different fire attack tactics (order of introduction was
balanced). Six fire scenarios were suppressed using an
interior attack from the “unburned side” (advancement
through the front door to extinguish the fire) and 6 fires
were suppressed with transitional attack (water applied
into the bedroom fires through an exterior window prior
 JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE

to advancing through the front door to extinguish the
fire).
The 12 firefighters were paired up to complete 6 fire-
ground job assignments including inside operations (fire
attack, and search and rescue), outside operations (com-
mand, pump operator, and outside ventilation), and over-
haul operations. “Inside” and “outside” operations were
conducted during active fire suppression. After the fire
was fully suppressed (as determined by the incident
commander), the “overhaul” firefighters then entered the
structure to search for smoldering items and remove dry-
wall and other items from the structure. Drywall and fur-
niture was replaced with identical items (from a single
source) after each fire.
The fire scenarios took place inside a 111 m2 residen-
tial structure (Figure 1).[30] The 2 bedrooms where the
fires were ignited were furnished with a double bed (cov-
ered with a foam mattress topper, comforter and pillow),
stuffed chair, side table, lamp, dresser, and flat screen tele-
vision. The floors were covered with polyurethane foam
padding and polyester carpet. After ignition, the fires were
allowed to grow until the rooms flashed over and became
ventilation limited (typically 4–5 min) and then the fire-
fighters were dispatched.
Area air sampling
Table 1 provides a summary of our substrate-based
and whole-gas area air sample collection and analysis
methods. An insulated cooler was modified for use in
sampling the air during the fire period (Figure 2). Holes
were drilled through the cooler so that Tygon tubing
could be inserted at various locations in the cooler.
Sampling media was placed into the cooler and separate
sections of tubing were used to connect the inlet of the
media to the interior of the structure (through pre-drilled
hole in the wall) and outlet of the media to sampling
pumps. Use of tubing to collect air from the structure was
done to protect the sampling media from hot gases and
water. After each fire scenario, all sampling media were
capped and stored in a −20°C freezer prior to shipment
(on ice) to the analytical laboratory.
For the live-fire portion of data collection, samples
were collected 0.9 m above the floor in the living room to
approximate firefighters’crawling/crouching height. The
tubing was wrapped in insulation to minimize aerosol
condensation. The sampling pumps were started just
before ignition. Initially, ice packs were included in the
cooler, but this practice was stopped after water conden-
sate was found to accumulate in the sampling media. Sam-
ple tubing was rinsed with water and dish soap mixture
after each fire and then dried by running compressed air
through the tubing. If this did not appear to effectively
remove soot deposits, the sample tubing was replaced
prior to the next fire. As the study progressed, we became
concerned about sample loss within the sample tubing.
Hence, for the last three fires, PAH sampling media was
positioned directly in the structure (next to the sample
tubing from the tubing method) to compare the two sam-
ple methods.
Evacuated glass bottles (1 L Bottle-Vacs, Entech) were
used to sample the air inside the structure for VOCs.
Prior to sampling, a 15-min regulator (containing a
fritted pre-filter) was attached to the bottle. Tygon tubing
(1.3 m in length) was attached to the inlet of the regulator
and the other end of the tubing was inserted into the
structure through the hole that was 0.9 m above the floor.
Once the fire was ignited, the regulator was opened to
permit air to be collected over a ∼15 min period. After
this duration, the remaining pressure was recorded and
the regulator removed (bottle closed).

to measure air concentrations inside the structure during the fire
period.
After the fire had been suppressed and overhaul
firefighters began entering the structure, another set of
sampling trains were attached to the exterior wall of the
structure and the sampling media was inserted through
a pre-drilled hole in the wall of the bedroom where the
fire was ignited. This hole was 1.8 m above the floor to
approximate standing height. The pumps were promptly
started and ran until a few minutes after the overhaul
firefighters exited the structure. An evacuated glass bottle
with Tygon tubing (2 m in length) was also used to sample
for VOCs (over ∼15 min) through the same hole.
Area air samples were also collected in the fireground.
An effort was made to place these samples downwind
of the structure and in a location where fire personnel
not directly involved in firefighting (e.g., pump operator
and command) commonly operate. These samples were
located either near the engine apparatus (northeast of the
structure) or truck apparatus (southeast of the structure),
depending on the wind direction. Additionally, PAH and
VOC samples were collected 12 hr before eight of the sce-
narios to provide an estimate of background levels.
Table 2 provides a summary of the direct-reading par-
ticle measurements. Particles were sampled through the
front wall of the burn structure using insulated stainless
steel sample lines attached to a mobile particle sampling
platform previously described in detail.[32] The platform,
adapted from similar work[21–23] but custom configured
for this application, utilized a two-stage dilution with
bypass for different phases of the fire response. Particle

respirable and thoracic mass, and active surface area.
Personal air sampling
Personal air samples were collected for PAHs and HCN
using the same analytical methods and flow rates
described in Table 1. Personal air samples for VOCs
(benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes) were col-
lected using charcoal tubes (SKC 226-01) at 200 mL/min,
analyzed by NIOSH method 1501.[33] The sampling
pumps were stored in pockets or straps on the outer
shell of the turnout jackets, and sampling media were
positioned near the collar of the jackets. Unlike the area
air samples, collected air did not travel through tubing
before entering the personal sampling media. For all 12
fires, firefighters assigned to fire attack (2 per fire), search
(2 per fire), overhaul (4 per fire), outside ventilation (2
per fire), and command/pump (2 per fire) were sampled.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics and other data analyses were carried
out using SAS 9.4 software. For the personal air samples,
which were started several minutes before each scenario,
the time the pumps ran from dispatch until the firefight-
ers were released from their assignments were used to
calculate the volume of air collected. For the area air sam-
ples, the pumps were started and stopped at the begin-
ning and end of each response period (i.e., fire and over-
haul periods). Pump faults due to overloading of sampling
media with particulate were common for the area air sam-
ples (PAHs, HCN, and acid gases) collected during the
fire period and for the personal air samples (PAHs, HCN,
and VOCs) collected from the attack and search firefight-
ers. For samples with pump faults, sample durations were
adjusted accordingly. Time of dispatch for attack firefight-
ers was a median of 4.5 min after ignition, and water was
applied to the fire a median of 6.5 and 7.3 min after igni-
tion for transitional and interior attack, respectively.[30]
Hence, personal air samples that did not run for at least
3 min of the response were excluded because they may not
represent the average concentrations during the most crit-
ical phase of the response (including suppression). This
resulted in the exclusion of 6 HCN, 3 VOC, and 2 PAH
personal air samples (data provided in Supplemental File).
All area air samples ran for 4 min or longer (near the time
of dispatch), which we deemed to be sufficient for charac-
terizing the fire atmosphere.
Total PAHs were calculated by summing the 15
quantified PAHs. Zero was used for non-detectable con-
centrations in this summation. The analytical limit of
detection for naphthalene (0.5 µg) was used in calcu-
lating the minimum detectable concentration for total
PAHs. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test whether
personal air concentrations varied by tactic (interior vs.
transitional attack) for the attack and search firefighters.
Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the
effect of sampling time on area air concentrations during
the fire period and personal air concentrations for the
attack and search firefighters.
Because the direct-reading particle instruments took
measurements every 10 sec or less, summary statis-
tics (i.e., median and range) for particle number, res-
pirable mass, thoracic mass, and active surface area were
conducted on the arithmetic means calculated for each
response phase. To assess the influence of environmen-
tal conditions on the fireground air concentrations, the
presence of ground level smoke was determined each day
of the study by a single investigator using visual evidence
(i.e., smoke hanging near the ground vs. rising into the
air) and wind direction was determined with a portable
weather station (Omega WMS-23).

Results
Table 3 provides the personal air concentrations of HCN,
PAHs, and benzene by job assignment. The most protec-
tive short-term occupational exposure limits are also pro-
vided for comparison. The median personal air concen-
trations for attack firefighters exceeded the NIOSH STEL
for HCN of 4,700 ppb, the ACGIH excursion limit for coal
tar pitch volatiles of 1,000 µg/m3, and the NIOSH STEL
for benzene of 1,000 ppb.[34,35] Results were similar for
search firefighters, except that median HCN concentra-
tions were below the NIOSH STEL. Maximum personal
air concentrations of HCN were well above IDLH levels
(50,000 ppb)[33] for the attack, search, and—somewhat
surprisingly—outside vent firefighters. The maximum
personal air concentrations of total PAHs and benzene for
the overhaul firefighters were above the ACGIH excursion
limit for coal tar pitch volatiles (1,000 µg/m3)[34] and the
NIOSH STEL for benzene (1,000 ppb), respectively.[34]
Statistically
significant
correlations
were
found
between sample time and personal air concentrations
of benzene (r = −0.71; P < 0.001) and HCN (r = −0.83;
P < 0.001) for search firefighters and between sample
time and personal air concentrations of HCN (r = −0.61;
P = 0.026) for attack firefighters, whereby increasing
sample time was related to decreasing personal air con-
centrations. No statistically significant correlations were
found between sample time and area air concentrations
for any of the sampled compounds (P > 0.15 for all
comparisons). The personal air concentrations of total
PAHs, HCN, and benzene for the attack and search
firefighters were compared by fire attack tactic (interior
vs. transitional). No statistically significant differences
were observed by this stratification (P > 0.10 for all
comparisons).
Table 4 provides a summary of the area air con-
centrations measured from the living room during the
fire period. As expected, median concentrations for sev-
eral compounds exceeded their ceiling limits or STELs,
including HCN, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride,
and benzene.[34,35] Occupational exposure limits do not
exist for particulate in general; although ACGIH recom-
mends that even biologically inert particulate should be
kept below 3,000 µg/m3 as a respirable fraction and below
10,000 µg/m3 as an inhalable fraction (as a time-weighted
average over an 8-hr workday).[35] While the particulate
produced in these fires should not be considered bio-
logically inert, inhalation exposure lasting <3 min could
result in an 8-hr time-weighted average concentration of
respirable particulate above the limit. However, as is typ-
ically the case, the firefighters wore SCBA while inside
the structure during fire attack and were protected from
inhaling these substances.
Figure 3 presents the individual PAH concentra-
tions measured using the direct-sampling method (media
inside the structure) and the tubing method (media in
cooler outside structure). These samples were collected
side-by-side during active fire for the last 3 scenarios.
On average, the tubing method resulted in lower con-
centrations of total PAHs (13% of the direct-sampling
method), but the differences varied by PAH species with
the largest differences observed for acenaphthene (0.7%),
fluorene (5%), naphthalene (0.6%), phenanthrene (23%),
and anthracene (24%), which are all composed of 3 rings
or fewer (greater volatility). All other PAH concentrations
measured by the direct-sampling method were � 34%

It is important to note that the tubing method samples
ran ∼5 min past suppression, while the direct-sampling
method samples ran a few minutes shy of suppression.
Because PAH concentrations are expected to decrease
rapidly after suppression, the tubing method samples may
have become diluted compared to the direct-sampling
method. However, even if we adjust the sample volumes
of the tubing method downward to essentially match the
direct-sampling method (see Supplemental File), we still
find that the tubing method underestimates the total PAH
concentrations (20% of the direct-sampling method).

also contributed particulate, gases, and vapors to our

tions were elevated (6 to >10 fold) above ambient back-
ground (in some cases >100,000 particles/cc) prior to fire
ignition.

Discussion
This study provides a thorough characterization of air-
borne exposures during structural firefighting. We eval-
uated firefighters’airborne exposures by job assignment
and attack tactics used during realistic residential fire
responses. We also performed area air sampling for a vari-
ety of compounds during active fire, overhaul, and on the
fireground. Important determinants (environmental fac-
tors) of the fireground concentrations were also identified.
Although this study has a number of limitations, includ-
ing potential sample losses from the use of tubing to draw
air from the structure, the findings are useful to the fire
service in identifying exposure risks and ways to mini-
mize those exposures.
The personal air sampling results indicate that expo-
sures will vary greatly by job assignment. The attack and
search firefighters had the highest airborne exposures but
were also wearing SCBA during the response. While fire-
fighters’lungs may be protected by SCBA, some airborne
chemicals could penetrate or permeate the turnout gear
and be absorbed through skin.[31,36] These results, as well
as the area air concentrations measured inside the struc-
ture during the fire, are also important for understand-
ing the potential risks to trapped occupants or firefighters
who run out of air or otherwise remove SCBA.
The personal air concentrations of PAHs (attack
median 23,800 µg/m3; search median 17,800 µg/m3)
measured during the fires were comparable or higher
than those measured in other studies (ranging from
<5–22,000 µg/m3).[26, 37–40] During a limited ventilation
living room fire, investigators at Underwriters Laborato-
ries measured 624 µg/m3 of total PAHs, and naphthalene
and phenanthrene constituted the majority of the mix-
ture (77% and 10%, respectively). Naphthalene (median
50%) and phenanthrene (median 13%) were also the
most abundant PAH species during the fires in our study
according to the direct-sampling method, which should
provide a more reliable estimate of the PAH composition
than the tubing method. According to this method, >50%
of the PAHs that were produced were known (1), probable
(2A), or possible (2B) human carcinogens as classified by
IARC.
The personal air concentrations of benzene (attack
median 40,300 ppb; search median 37,900 ppb) dur-
ing the fires appear to be higher than the levels mea-
sured in a study of structural firefighters’ exposures
by Jankovic et al.[26] (ranging up to 22,000 ppb). This
study also reported HCN concentrations ranging up
to 23,000 ppb.[26] Much higher maximum concentra-
tions of HCN were measured from attack firefighters
(100,400 ppb) and search firefighters (106,000 ppb) in our
study. It is important to note that the Jankovic study was
performed in the 1980s and may not represent current
conditions or fuel loads for today’
s residential fires. Com-
bustion of polyurethane foams, plastics, resins, and glues
used in the modern furnishings may have contributed to
the higher levels found in our study.
Because HCN is lighter than air (vapor density = 0.9),
it likely partitioned more heavily into the upper smoke
layer. As is normal practice, the interior firefighters tried
to remain below the upper smoke layer. However, the
attack firefighters were often closer to the fires and in more
upright positions during water application than the search
firefighters. This could explain why attack firefighters had
higher median HCN concentrations (33,500 ppb) than
search firefighters (85 ppb).
The partitioning of HCN into the upper smoke layer
may also explain why the outside vent firefighters had
the second highest personal air concentrations of HCN of
all positions. Opening windows and ventilating the roof
while standing near the openings and/or in elevated posi-
tions likely exposed these firefighters to rising gases. The
median personal air concentration of HCN (16,300 ppb)
for the outside vent firefighters was well above the NIOSH
short-term exposure limit of 4,700 ppb. Because median
area air concentrations inside the structure were greater
than 160,000 ppb, transient concentrations in excess of the
IDLH level of 50,000 ppb[34] are possible for firefighters
who encounter heavy smoke even when they are immedi-
ately outside the structure conducting assignments such
as outside vent. In fact, the maximum time weighted aver-
age personal air concentration (over 9 min) for outside
vent firefighters was 72,900 ppb. These results provide
strong justification that SCBA should be used when con-
ducting ventilation of a structure during the firefight.
As with outside ventilation activities, firefighters may
not always wear respiratory protection during overhaul
and rarely wear respiratory protection during exterior
support/command activities. Three of the 43 personal
total PAH air concentrations measured during overhaul
(1,230 µg/m3 for one fire and 1,330 and 2,220 µg/m3 for
another fire) exceeded the ACGIH excursion limit for coal
tar pitch volatiles (1,000 µg/m3).[35] In a study of fire-
fighters’exposures during the overhaul phase of actual
fire responses, Bolstad-Johnson et al.[27] found that this
same limit was exceeded in 2 of 25 structure fires. Twenty-
three of 47 personal air concentrations of benzene mea-
sured during overhaul in our study (ranging from 1,040–
2,970 ppb, collected during 9 separate fires) exceeded the
NIOSH STEL (1,000 ppb).[34] This is within the range
of benzene concentrations measured by Bolstad-Johnson
et al.[27] (ranging from <70–2,000 ppb).
The maximum area and personal air concentrations of
HCN during overhaul (906 and 1,380 ppb, respectively) in
our study were below the NIOSH STEL (4,700 ppb).[34]
 410
K.W. FENT ET AL.
In 2 separate studies, Jankovic et al.[26] measured lower
levels of HCN (ranging up to 400 ppb) and Bolstad-
Johnson et al.[27] did not detect HCN (<900 ppb) dur-
ing overhaul. Ventilation conditions in the structure are
likely to significantly impact how quickly residual gases
are removed from the structure. In these scenarios, the fire
bedroom where samples were collected had 2 relatively
large windows and an open front door. Visible smoke
within the structure generally dissipated within the first
minute or two of overhaul. If less ventilation were avail-
able or if the attack crews had not completed suppression
as thoroughly as done here, these concentrations could
have been even higher during overhaul.
Using tubing to draw air from the structure during the
fires appeared to result in underestimation of the actual
concentrations as evidenced by the comparison of PAH
concentrations measured with media inside the structure
(direct-sampling method) vs. those measured using the
tubing method (Figure 3). Estimates of potential parti-
cle losses due to impaction, settling, and diffusion in the
tubing based on particle size, tube velocity, tube bends,
and area of tube inlet were calculated. Particle losses were
likely negligible from 1–10 µm. As a worst case, diffusion
losses of 10% were possible for particles 10 nm in diame-
ter; however, these particles would compose only a small
fraction of the total count and an insignificant fraction of
the total mass. Hence, we believe the particle losses in the
sample tubes were negligible for both the substrate-based
samples and direct-reading particle measurements.
The length of tubing used for the area air samples
could have essentially diluted the samples because “clean
air” in the tubing would have been collected during the
initial sampling period. However, based on calculated
air velocities within the tubing, no samples would have
been diluted more than 15:16. Also, because tubing was
cleaned and then reused for some of the scenarios, it is
possible that the tubing was not completely free of con-
taminants. This could have contributed to the air mea-
surements; although, we would expect any off-gassing
contaminant concentrations in the tubing to be much
lower than the air concentrations inside the structure dur-
ing fire and overhaul.
Most likely, losses in the tubing were due to conden-
sation of vapors to the tubing walls. Tubing was used
for area air sampling during the fire period for all com-
pounds and during the overhaul period for VOCs. Insu-
lation was used around the tubing to minimize condensa-
tion losses, but the temperature gradient was probably too
great to fully prevent condensation. Temperatures inside
the structure were measured using strategically placed
thermocouples.[30] The maximum temperatures near the
inlet of the tubing during the fires were 114–198°C,
while temperatures at the location of the sampling media
(outdoors) ranged from 13–20°C. Condensation of
vapors to the tubing walls would explain why apparent
losses were greater for the more volatile PAHs (those likely
to be in gas-phase during collection) than the non-volatile
PAHs (those likely to be in solid-phase). Condensation
losses would also be expected for the VOCs (i.e., benzene,
toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes). With the exception
of phosphoric acid (boiling point ∼158°C), condensation
losses should be negligible for the acid gases (most with
boiling points <20°C) and HCN (boiling point ∼26°C)
as they should have remained in gas-phase until they
adsorbed to the sampling media.
Although no exposure limits exist for general particu-
late, the median sub-micrometer particle count and res-
pirable mass concentrations during overhaul were well
above background levels. Particulate in this size range
are capable of penetrating and depositing into the gas-
exchange regions of the respiratory system where clear-
ance mechanisms are less effective and lung inflammation
could occur.[41] The exact composition of this particulate
is unknown, though it would likely be composed of large
hydrocarbon molecules and a variety of adsorbed toxi-
cants. Hence, inhalation exposures should be minimized
as much as possible.
While fireground concentrations were below any
applicable occupational exposure limits, median particle
count, respirable mass, total PAH, and benzene concen-
trations were above background levels and could con-
tribute to a firefighter’
s dose. Numerous other chemicals
will also be produced (e.g., aldehydes),[26] but were not
measured in this study. Exposure to multiple chemicals
(as is likely during fire responses) could have additive
or even synergistic health effects, especially if the chem-
icals affect the same target organs. The toxicity of mix-
tures is an area of active research and is not well under-
stood. According to our findings, the magnitude of the
fireground exposures will depend on the firefighters’posi-
tion relative to the wind direction and atmospheric con-
ditions affecting the mixing/dilution of the smoke (e.g.,
superadiabatic atmosphere resulting in fumigation). Dur-
ing fire responses where ground level smoke is evident, it
is prudent for firefighters to establish command upwind
of the structure if possible and/or to wear respiratory
protection.
In addition to the condensation losses of vapors in
the sample tubing, another limitation of this study was
sampling pump faults due to the extreme conditions
and particulate loading onto the media. Several area and
personal air samples only ran for a portion of the fire
response (�4 min or �3 min, respectively). Thus, results
with shorter sampling times likely better represent the
 JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE
411
growth phase of the fire and initial attack, which would be
influenced more by peak smoke production levels, while
results with longer sampling times would better represent
the entire response (including post-suppression). Corre-
lation analysis between the sample times and personal air
concentrations indicated—at least for some compounds
and positions—that air concentrations were highest dur-
ing the first few minutes of the response. Also, many of
the samples that were excluded (due to inadequate sample
durations) measured higher concentrations than the max-
imum levels reported here. This is an important consid-
eration, especially for acutely toxic compounds that have
IDLH levels or ceiling limits (e.g., HCN).
Conclusions
Personal and area air concentrations collected within the
structure during the fire period were well above short-
term occupational exposure limits for most of the mea-
sured compounds and exceeded the IDLH level for HCN.
Firefighters performing outside ventilation were exposed
to HCN concentrations near or above the IDLH level.
Air concentrations of all measured compounds decreased
after suppression; however, some personal air concentra-
tions of PAHs and benzene measured from overhaul fire-
fighters exceeded applicable exposure limits. Median fire-
ground concentrations of benzene, total PAHs, and active
particle surface area were above background levels and
highest when collected downwind of the structure with
heavy ground-level smoke. Firefighters can protect them-
selves from these inhalation exposures by wearing SCBA
throughout the entire response, including during over-
haul and outside ventilation activities, as well as by estab-
lishing command upwind of the structure. If the latter
cannot be accomplished and ground level smoke is evi-
dent, command/support personnel should wear respira-
tory protection.
