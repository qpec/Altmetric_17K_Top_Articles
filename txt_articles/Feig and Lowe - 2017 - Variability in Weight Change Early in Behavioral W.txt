 Variability in Weight Change Early in Behavioral Weight
Loss Treatment: Theoretical and Clinical Implications
Emily H. Feig and Michael R. Lowe
Objective: Response early in weight loss treatment predicts long-term weight change. Weight variability,
independent of absolute early weight change, may also relate to long-term outcomes. This study exam-
ined whether weight variability early in treatment predicted later weight loss and maintenance.
Methods: Participants were 183 completers of a yearlong behavioral weight loss program (mean age 5
51, 81% female, 69% white, mean BMI 5 35 kg/m2). Weight variability was calculated using weights from
the first 6 and 12 weekly treatment sessions. Multiple linear regressions examined whether weight vari-
ability predicted subsequent weight change 6, 12, and 24 months later.
Results: Weight variability over 6- and 12-week periods predicted less subsequent weight loss at 12
months (6-week: b 5 0.18, P 5 0.02; 12-week: b 5 0.33, P < 0.01) and 24 months (6-week: b 5 0.17,
P 5 0.03; 12-week: b 5 0.15, P 5 0.05). Relationships held when adjusting for covariates. Weight variability
was more strongly associated with 6-month weight change in men than women (b 5 0.27, P 5 0.01).
Conclusions: Elevated weight variability early in a weight loss program predicted poor long-term out-
comes, possibly reflecting inconsistent weight control behaviors. Tracking weight variability could prove
useful for improving treatment outcomes.

Introduction
Behavioral weight loss programs reliably produce clinically signifi-
cant weight losses (1). However, weight loss outcomes are variable,
and those who lose a clinically significant amount of weight (5%-
10%) typically regain it (2). Early identification of individuals most
at risk for smaller losses and/or weight regain would allow for
potential benefits from more intensive or tailored interventions. Fail-
ure to achieve meaningful weight loss early in treatment has repeat-
edly been associated with poor long-term outcomes (3-5). Variability
in weight early in treatment, independent of total early weight loss,
might
provide
additional
predictive
information
about
later
outcomes.
Higher fluctuation in weight may signal less consistency in weight
control behaviors (6). However, research regarding the benefit of
short-term weight consistency is mixed. On the one hand, Orsama
and colleagues (7) found that people typically have higher weights
on weekends than weekdays, a pattern that was strongest in those
who lost or maintained, rather than gained, weight over time. These
authors suggested that compensating for increased weekend intake
contributes to successful weight control. On the other hand, success-
ful weight loss maintainers have typically reported consistent daily
diets, with higher consistency associated with less weight regain in
this group (8). These findings are in line with the strategy taught in
most behavioral weight control programs: eating a similar amount
with similar timing each day. For example, the LEARN manual, the
gold standard of behavioral weight loss treatment, advises meeting a
daily calorie goal set 500 to 1,000 calories below one’s energy
expenditure (9). Fluctuation in body weight could be a proxy for
inconsistent caloric intake, which is counter to teachings in standard
behavioral programs. Additionally, Lowe and colleagues (10) found
that, in young women concerned with their weight, higher weight
variability over 6 months predicted the amount of weight gained
over the following 1.5 years. Higher variability in weight may be
detrimental for long-term weight control, although the association
may depend on the time period over which it is measured (e.g.,
within-week fluctuation may be less concerning than longer-term
variability).
The present study examined whether weekly weight variability early
in treatment was associated with long-term weight outcomes. Based
on the framework presented by Brownell (9) and others (11,12), we
expected that relatively consistent week-to-week weight reductions
would bode well for long-term weight control. While large weekly
weight losses contribute more to total weight loss and are typically
viewed favorably, we hypothesized that consistency in weight
changes would independently predict greater long-term weight loss.

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 Because of the lack of consensus about the most meaningful length
of time over which to measure weight variability, we chose to mea-
sure it over 6 and 12 weeks. These windows were chosen to better
identify what length of time includes sufficient data to maximize the
accuracy and clinical relevance of the variability measure while
keeping the measurement time short enough to allow for supplemen-
tary clinical interventions as warranted. It was hypothesized that,
controlling for total 6-week (or 12-week) weight loss, higher weight
variability during the first 6 (or 12) weeks of treatment would pre-
dict smaller subsequent weight losses 6 months into treatment and
poorer weight loss maintenance 1 and 2 years later. Gender differen-
ces in weight variability and gender as a moderator between weight
variability and later weight loss were tested in an exploratory man-
ner, as research to inform directional hypotheses is lacking. Addi-
tionally, weight variability’s relation with self-report measures of
eating and appetite is largely untested, so we examined this in an
exploratory manner to better understand weight variability.
Methods
Participants
Adults (N 5 262) living near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were recru-
ited to participate in a behavioral weight loss treatment study
located at two local universities. Eligible participants were between
age 18 and 65 with a BMI between 27 and 45 kg/m2. Exclusion cri-
teria included current enrollment in another organized weight loss
program, lactose intolerance (as meal replacements provided to par-
ticipants included dairy), taking medications that affect appetite
(unless dosage was stable for at least 6 months), history of a surgi-
cal weight loss procedure, major diseases, pregnancy or pregnancy
plans during the next 2 years, breastfeeding, and excessive alcohol
consumption (unless willing and judged able by study clinicians to
reduce that amount).
Procedure
Participants completed a phone screening, a group-based orientation,
and an individual in-person screening visit to confirm eligibility and
provide informed consent. Enrolled participants were randomly
assigned to one of three treatment conditions. Each was based on
standard behavioral treatment adapted from the LEARN manual (9).
Participants were given behavioral goals such as self-monitoring,
calorie monitoring, and increasing physical activity. One condition
was based strictly on standard behavioral treatment. The second con-
dition built on these guidelines with instruction to use two meal
replacements per day during the first 6 months of the study. The
third condition focused on modifying individuals’ personal food
environments by decreasing the energy density of foods, increasing
protein and fiber intake, and decreasing the variety of foods with
high
energy
density
(results
from
parent
trial
submitted
for
publication).
Treatment lasted 1 year and was delivered by two leaders through
75-minute sessions in small groups. Treatment was administered
weekly for months 1 through 6, biweekly for months 7 through 9,
and monthly for months 10 through 12. The first 6 months focused
on weight loss, with the final 6 months shifting toward weight loss
maintenance. Participants attended assessment visits at 6, 12, and 24
months from study initiation. The Drexel University Institutional
Review Board approved this study.
Measures
Weight was measured at every assessment and treatment session.
The following self-report measures were administered at each
assessment. Scores from the baseline assessment were used in the
present study.
General Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (GFCQ-T).
This
assessed four factors of food cravings: preoccupation with food; loss
of control; positive outcome expectancy; and emotional craving (13).
The GFCQ-T demonstrates adequate test-retest reliability, internal
consistency, and construct validity (13).
Power of Food Scale (PFS).
This assessed hedonic hunger, or
the extent to which palatable foods in one’s environment influence the
desire to consume such foods (14). It includes three subscales: food
available, food present, and food tasted. The PFS shows adequate
internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent discrimi-
nant validity (14).
Binge Eating Scale (BES).
This assessed behavioral manifesta-
tions and feelings/cognitions surrounding a binge episode (15). The
BES has good test-retest reliability and is moderately associated with
binge eating severity indicated from food records (16).
Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS).
This assessed signs of
addiction to certain types of foods (17). The YFAS exhibits adequate
internal reliability and good convergent and discriminant validity with
other similar and dissimilar constructs, respectively (17).
Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire (WEL).
This assessed
self-efficacy for regulating food intake across various situations
(negative emotions, availability, social pressure, physical discomfort,
and positive activities) (18). The WEL shows significant validity
and reliability (19).
Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, revised edition (TFEQ-
18).
This assessed cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and
emotional eating (20). The TFEQ-18 has a strong factor structure
and adequate reliability (20).
Analysis plan
Data were analyzed from treatment completers. Treatment dropouts
were excluded to minimize variance in weight outcomes and because
they were usually missing follow-up data. Additionally, two partici-
pants were excluded from analyses due to missing more than 4 of the
first 12 intervention sessions, limiting data available to calculate
weight variability.
As neither weight variability nor early weight change differed between
intervention groups, groups were combined for all analyses. All par-
ticipants with available data were included in each analysis. Weight
variability was calculated based on methodology from Lowe and
colleagues (10). Growth curve analysis modeled weight change trajec-
tories over the first 6 and first 12 weeks of treatment, using partici-
pants’ weekly weights. Weight variability was the root mean (M)
square error around each participant’s regression line. When data were
missing, the model appropriately spaced recorded weights. An

 participants to determine differences in demographics and early
weight
change/variability
(for

with

data
for

Next, the associations of the weight variability measures with poten-
tially confounding variables (baseline BMI, 6-week [or 12-week]
weight change, and number of missed sessions) were tested with
Spearman’s rank correlations (q) due to non-normal distributions.
Partial correlations tested the relationship of weight variability with
baseline GFCQ-T, PFS, TFEQ-18, YFAS, BES, and WEL scores,
controlling for baseline BMI. A one-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) tested for gender differences in weight variability, con-
trolling for baseline BMI.
Bivariate linear regressions tested the independent relationship between
each weight variability measure and future weight change. For 6-week
weight variability, weight change was calculated from 1.5 to 6, 1.5 to
12, and 1.5 to 24 months. For 12-week weight variability, it was meas-
ured from 3 to 6, 3 to 12, and 3 to 24 months. Outcome variables started
after the variability measure ended to avoid overlap in timing of the
independent and dependent variables. Next, multiple linear regressions
tested the relationship between each weight variability measure and the
three outcome variables, controlling for covariates. In addition to
weight change during the weight variability period, number of missed
weights, treatment condition, and gender, all baseline measures with a
significant or trending relationship to weight variability were included
as covariates. Finally, the interaction between weight variability and
gender was tested on the three weight change outcomes for each weight
variability measure, controlling for covariates.
Results
Included (n 5 183) and excluded (n 5 79) participants had similar
starting BMI and gender proportions. Treatment completers were
older than dropouts (t [128.41] 5 22.13, P 5 0.04), and groups dif-
fered in racial/ethnic breakdown, with 41.8% of black and 23.2% of
white participants in the excluded group (v2 5 14.27, P 5 0.03).
Included participants had a higher 6-week percent weight loss than
excluded participants (t [252] 5 5.35, P < 0.01), but groups did not
differ on 6-week weight variability (t [243] 5 0.14, P 5 0.89).
Characteristics of the included sample are shown in Table 1. Figure
1 shows examples of one individual with low and one individual
with high 12-week weight variability. Controlling for baseline BMI,
6- and 12-week weight variability was higher in men (6-week:
M 5 1.30, SD 5 0.55; 12-week: M 5 1.58, SD 5 0.51) than women
(6-week: M 5 1.04, SD 5 0.54; 12-week: M 5 1.27, SD 5 0.48; 6-
week: F [1,180] 5 6.14, P 5 0.01; 12-week: F [1,180] 5 12.11,

 P < 0.01). Weight variability over the first and second 6 weeks of
treatment was correlated (rs 5 0.23, P < 0.01). In addition, weight
variability at 6 and 12 weeks positively correlated with baseline
BMI (rs 5 0.19 and rs5 0.27, respectively; P < 0.01). Weight vari-
ability was unrelated to the number of first sessions missed or to the
initial percent weight change. The number of the first 12 sessions
missed was associated with percent weight change over the first 12
weeks (rs 5 0.28, P < 0.01), such that those who missed more meet-
ings lost less weight.
Weight variability at both 6 and 12 weeks was positively associated
with subsequent weight change at 12 and 24 months. In addition,
both were unrelated to subsequent weight change at 6 months. Per-
cent weight change was calculated such that negative values indicate

 more weight loss (see Tables 2 and 3). Correlations between weight
variability and baseline self-report questionnaires can be found in
Table 4. Negative associations indicate that those higher in weight
variability reported fewer of these aspects of eating behavior.
In the adjusted models, 6-week weight variability was still unrelated
to 1.5- to 6-month percent weight change and continued to predict
1.5- to 12-month and 1.5- to 24-month percent weight change (Table
2). Weight variability at 12 months still significantly predicted 3- to
12-month and 3- to 24-month percent weight change and was unre-
lated to 3- to 6-month percent weight change (Table 3). Figure 2
shows scatterplots of weight variability with percent weight change
at 12 and 24 months.
The gender-by-weight variability interaction was significant with 6-
week weight variability on weight change from 1.5 to 6 months
(b 5 0.04, SEb 5 0.01, b 5 0.27, P 5 0.01, R2 change 5 0.03), con-
trolling for the 6-week weight variability covariates. This interaction
signifies that 6-week weight variability was more strongly associated
with 6-month weight change for men than women. The interaction
did not predict percent weight change over any of the time periods
with
12-week
weight
variability,
controlling
for
the
12-week
covariates.
Discussion
This study assessed the relationship of weight variability over the
initial 6 and 12 weeks of weight loss treatment with subsequent
weight outcomes up to 2 years later. Higher weight variability meas-
ured over both the first 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment predicted
poorer subsequent long-term weight control at 12 and 24 months.
Relationships held when controlling for total weight change over the
weight variability period and other covariates. Further, weight vari-
ability and percent weight change over the weight variability period
were themselves unrelated. Findings suggest that the pattern of
weight changes early in treatment, above and beyond amount of
weight lost, is important in predicting outcomes. Those who lost
similar amounts of weight each week early on were likely to have
subsequently lost more weight after 12 and 24 months compared to
those whose early weekly weight changes were more variable.
While weight variability did not predict weight change at the end of
active treatment (6 months) when controlling for covariates, a
gender-by-6-week weight variability interaction was significant,
indicating that the relationship between 6-week weight variability
and weight change at 6 months was stronger for men than for
women. Further, weight variability was higher for men than women,
controlling for BMI. As the sample was 81% women, these findings
should be interpreted with some caution; however, they suggest that
weekly variability in weight change may be particularly concerning
for men.
The correlation between weight variability and future weight change
does not necessarily indicate that weight variability causes weight
gain. Research on dietary restraint supports the notion that strict die-
tary restriction, characterized as a “dichotomous, rule-based, all-or-
nothing approach to eating” (11), which may result in large short-
term
weight
losses,
is
often
followed
by
disinhibition
and
regain(11,21,22). Those with higher weight variability could be
using stricter, rigid dieting practices resulting in larger drops in
weight. Rigid dieting could then spur periods of increased disinhibi-
tion and regain (23). Additionally, a period of regain may cause dis-
tress and a recommitment to rigid dieting. Over time, bidirectional
forces between strict restraint and disinhibition could create a pat-
tern of high weight variability. Participants following this pattern
may not learn sustainable practices to maintain their weight loss
over the subsequent months, as strict restraint has been associated
with poorer long-term weight control (11,23). Alternatively, these
results could be driven by a stronger drive to eat, which produces
greater energy intake and makes restraint harder to sustain. Another
hypothesis is that physiological differences cause some to lose
weight more consistently than others, leading to occasions when
someone has followed recommendations consistently but does not
immediately see the effects in their weight. Such occasions could
lead one to feel disheartened, reducing motivation and causing
weight regain.
Individuals reporting lower emotional eating, hedonic hunger, and
preoccupation with food showed more variability in weight during
the first 6 weeks of weight loss, and those with lower emotional eat-
ing also showed more weight variability in the first 12 weeks of
treatment. This pattern is contrary to our expectation that individuals
who reported more difficulty controlling their food intake would
experience more weight variability. Lowe and colleagues similarly
found that reports of disinhibition and restraint did not explain the
relationship between weight variability and future weight gain (10).
Thus, the reason that weight fluctuation predicts future weight gain
(10) or poorer weight loss maintenance is enigmatic. Actual varia-
tion in body weight may provide a superior predictive ability com-
pared to reported eating patterns that could contribute to weight pat-
terns. However, as restraint and disinhibition ratings typically

 change during participation in a weight loss program (24,25),
weekly measures of these and similar constructs could be more
informative than baseline-only measures in testing the relationship
between those dimensions and variation in weight.
A secondary aim of this study was to measure weight variability
over two lengths of time in order to identify a timespan that
included sufficient data to be reliable while providing clinical infor-
mation relatively early in treatment. The percent of variance in
long-term outcomes explained by 6-week and 12-week weight vari-
ability was similar and fairly small (between 2% and 7%). As
weight variability over the first and second 6-week periods was cor-
related, and 6-week and 12-week weight variability was similarly
related to long-term weight change, 6 weeks of weights is likely suf-
ficient to identify individuals at risk for greater challenges for long-
term weight loss. On the other hand, the fact that the 6-week, but
not the 12-week, results seemed to be influenced more by several
nonstatistical outliers suggests that the longer measurement of
weight variability may be more stable (30). Using shorter periods to
measure weight variability is preferable for potential clinical rele-
vance. The sooner it is measured, the earlier individuals at greater
risk for weight regain can be identified and helped, should further
research support the utility of weight variability as an indicator of
poor outcome. More research is needed to identify the ideal balance
between reliability and clinical usefulness in weight variability
measurement.
While this study was not designed to examine the relationship
between early weight loss and long-term outcomes, findings from
this trial are consistent with others’ conclusions that weight loss
early in treatment strongly predicts long-term weight change (3,4).
We found that percent weight change over the first 6 weeks of treat-
ment was significantly associated with subsequent weight loss at 6,
12, and 24 months, controlling for the covariates relevant to weight
variability calculations. Those who are struggling to lose weight
early on may benefit from extra intervention.
Despite the fact that early weight loss is undoubtedly easier to cal-
culate than weight variability and may be more strongly associated
with future weight change, we see a strong rationale to study weight
variability from both a theoretical and, potentially, clinical perspec-
tive. For example, even one small weight gain during treatment has
been shown to predict poorer outcomes (26). Weight loss programs
may be able to increase efficacy by placing a higher focus on
Figure 2 Scatterplots of weight variability (x-axis) and subsequent percent weight change (y-axis). Higher weight variability was associated
with less weight loss. Top: 6-week weight variability. Bottom: 12-week weight variability. Left: percent weight change at 12 months. Right:
percent weight change at 24 months. Scatterplots suggested several possible outliers with either high weight variability values or large
amounts of weight loss. Statistical analysis of outliers suggested that these values are within a reasonable range (Cook’s D < 1 and P > 0.05
for all participants) (30). However, analyses were run excluding visual outliers (defined as weight variability > 3 or percent weight loss > 30). All
12-week weight variability significance levels remained the same. The relationship between 6-week weight variability and weight change
weakened, with a nonsignificant relationship between weight variability and 1.5- to 12-month weight loss (P 5 0.23) and a marginal independ-
ent relationship between weight variability and 1.5- to 24-month weight loss (P 5 0.06). Both relationships were nonsignificant after controlling
for covariates.

 consistency in weight losses week to week, but a better understand-
ing of the importance of a steady weight trajectory is needed.
An important question for future research is whether losing weight
in a more variable fashion itself is harmful, or whether it is a marker
for something else that leads to poorer long-term weight control.
The literature on intermittent fasting has suggested that purposeful
variety between strict and lenient restriction may produce similar
outcomes to traditional behavioral weight loss prescriptions (see
review) (27). If reliable, this finding suggests that weight variability
is not itself responsible for poorer weight outcomes; instead, it sug-
gests that another characteristic may cause both greater variability
and poorer long-term weight control. For example, weight variability
may indicate inconsistent adherence to dietary prescriptions. The
manipulation of degree of weight variability during a weight loss
program would be the best way of determining its causal status.
Strengths of this study included the relatively large sample of indi-
viduals in a behavioral weight loss program with objectively meas-
ured weights over 2 years. Weaknesses included the correlational
nature of the data, which limited causal interpretations. Additionally,
a substantial portion of those who entered the study did not contrib-
ute body weights at all assessment points. In particular, black and
younger participants were more likely to drop out of treatment than
white and older participants, suggesting that results may not general-
ize across age and race. Racial disparities in weight loss outcomes
have been a common pattern (28,29). Further, the fact that 6-week
weight variability results weakened when excluding visual (but not
statistically significant) outliers is important to acknowledge.
Conclusion
Higher variability in weekly weights during the first 6 and 12 weeks
of treatment predicted poorer subsequent weight loss 1 and 2 years
after treatment initiation. Future research should examine replicability
of these findings and should clarify whether measuring weight vari-
ability adds to interventionists’ ability to identify individuals unlikely
to achieve meaningful and sustainable weight loss. If found to be reli-
able and useful, weight variability early in treatment may be cause for
supplemental intervention. An algorithm could be created to calculate
weight variability after each week (or even after each day, given the
development of new technologies to monitor weight at home) of a
weight loss program to be used by program leaders as a clinical indica-
tor for risk of poor outcomes. Future research should also examine the
behavioral and/or metabolic basis for weight variability and whether
increasing the stability of week-to-week weight losses improves long-
term outcomes. If this is the case, behavioral interventions may benefit
from a stronger focus on consistent weekly weight losses.O
