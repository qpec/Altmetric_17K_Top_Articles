STUDY QUESTION: How has the mean paternal age in the USA changed over the past 4 decades?
SUMMARY ANSWER: The age at which men are fathering children in the USA has been increasing over time, although it varies by race,
geographic region and paternal education level.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While the rise in mean maternal age and its implications for fertility, birth outcomes and public health
have been well documented, little is known about paternal characteristics of births within the USA.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective data analysis of paternal age and reporting patterns for 168 867 480 live births
within the USA since 1972 was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All live births within the USA collected through the National Vital Statistics
System (NVSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were evaluated. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to
reduce bias due to missing paternal records.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Mean paternal age has increased over the past 44 years from 27.4 to 30.9 years.
College education and Northeastern birth states were associated with higher paternal age. Racial/ethnic differences were also identified,
whereby Asian fathers were the oldest and Black fathers were the youngest. The parental age difference (paternal age minus maternal age)
has decreased over the past 44 years. Births to Black and Native American mothers were most often lacking paternal data, implying low
paternal reporting. Paternal reporting was higher for older and more educated women.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although we utilized IPW to reduce the impact of paternal reporting bias, our estimates
may still be influenced by the missing data in the NVSS.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Paternal age is rising within the USA among all regions, races and education levels. Given
the implications for offspring health and demographic patterns, further research on this trend is warranted.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No funding was received for this study and there are no competing interests.

 Introduction
Parental age influences reproductive outcomes. Older women have
higher rates of primary and secondary infertility and are more likely to
suffer from pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, pre-
eclampsia and cesarean delivery (Paulson et al., 2012; Sauer, 2015).
Recent studies have demonstrated that the mean ages of first union
and first birth for women have been rising (Matthews and Hamilton,
2009; Manning et al., 2014). Indeed, women have delayed child-
bearing since the 1970s, likely due to increased assimilation into the
workforce, improved contraception, and better access to higher edu-
cation, while ARTs have extended their reproductive window (de la
Rochebrochard and Thonneau, 2002). In contrast, literature on pater-
nal demographics remains limited given that most birth data are col-
lected primarily at the maternal level. Since advanced paternal age has
been associated with higher rates of chromosomal abnormalities, neu-
rocognitive disorders and spontaneous abortions, there is a need to
evaluate temporal trends in paternal demographics within the USA (de
la Rochebrochard and Thonneau, 2002; Toriello and Meck, 2008;
Wiener-Megnazi et al., 2012a; Reichenberg et al., 2017).
We utilized natality data from the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) to identify fathers of live births within the US from
1972 to 2015 and characterized trends in paternal age over time
among different races and birth regions.
Materials and Methods
Data source
This study draws on data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS),
an inter-governmental data sharing program that is provided by the NCHS
of the Center for Disease Control (CDC). All institutions and birth atten-
dants are required to file birth certificates reporting on parental demo-
graphics, pregnancy and infant health. This national initiative makes
certificate data from nearly all live births within the USA publicly available.
While legal jurisdiction over vitality records reside with individual states,
contracts between the NCHS and vital registration systems within each
state permit use of this data for medical research. Comprehensive birth
data files were available from 1972 to 2015 (Schoendorf and Branum,
2006). This study was exempt from our Institutional Review Board
approval as all data analyzed were de-identified.
Study cohort and outcome variables
Our study population included all reported births within the USA available
through the NVSS from 1972 to 2015. Demographic variables for both
parents for each birth were extracted, including age, race, education and
birth state. The racial categories, provided by the NVSS, were defined by
the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and are based on how
individuals self-identify. States were regionalized as per the United States
Census Bureau (Northeast, Midwest, South and West). Data on paternal
education and offspring birth state were unavailable between 1994 and
2009, and after 2004, respectively, due to collection policy changes. Since
1985, 100% of births were reported; however, some states submitted a
50% sample of all births between 1972 and 1984. For these states, the
reported data were double weighted using the inverse probability weight-
ing (IPW) method to form statistical estimates accounting for births with
incomplete reporting (Ali and Altman, 2016). A sensitivity analysis was also
performed and presented to evaluate the effects of extreme imputations
on the overall paternal age trends.
Statistical analysis
The annual natality data files from 1972 through 2015 were compiled into
a single dataset. Temporal trends of paternal age, parental age difference

 (paternal age minus maternal age), and paternal reporting were calculated
and presented in both tabular and graphic forms as means with standard
deviations. Given the inconsistent reporting of paternal data on birth certi-
ficates by certain demographics, a logistic regression model was con-
structed to model the probability of paternal reporting for each birth as
a function of maternal age, race, education level and reporting period. IPW
was applied to observed paternal data in all statistical analyses to adjust for
missing paternal data (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983; Ali and Altman, 2016).
All statistical analysis was carried out using Stata version 14 (College
Station, TX).
Results
A weighted total of 168 867 480 births were evaluated within the
United States between 1972 and 2015. The mean age of fathers
increased from 27.4 years to 30.9 years over the course of the study
period (Fig. 1). The percentages of fathers of newborns older than 40
and 50 also increased from 4.1 and 0.5% to 8.9 and 0.9%, respectively
(Table I). While mean paternal age of all races/ethnicities increased
substantially, Asians were found to be the oldest while Blacks and
Hispanics tended to be the youngest. Japanese fathers had the largest
increase in mean age from 30.7 years in 1972 to 36.3 years in 2015.
Fathers of less than high school, high school or college level educa-
tion all displayed increases in mean paternal age over the study period.
Fathers with college degrees were older, 33.3 years on average,
compared to fathers with only a high school diploma, 29.2 years,
between 2011 and 2015. These educational differences at the time of
birth were present for all years within our study. Paternal age
increased across all regions of the USA as well. On average, the
Northeast had the oldest fathers (Table I).
The mean age difference between parents for all births dropped
during the study period. In 1972, fathers were an average of 2.7 years
older than the mothers of their children compared to 2.3 years in
2015. This trend appeared across all races (White, Black and Asian)
(Table II).
The proportion of paternal data reporting on all birth certificates is
currently at 88.4% which is an increase from the nadir of 85.5% in
1991. The rate of reporting from 1985 to 2015 varied by the mother’s
race/ethnicity (e.g. White (90–93%), Black (58–71%) and Chinese
(96–99%)). Importantly, the rate of paternal reporting for births to
Black mothers has increased from 63.9% in 1985 to 70.9% in 2015.
The nadir for White mothers was in 2007 at 89.3%. Paternal reporting
also varied based on maternal age and education. Over the past dec-
ade, mothers younger than 20 years had the lowest proportion of
reported paternal identity at 67.7% with Black mothers under 20 years
reporting paternity only 50.4% of the time (Table III).
Given the significant variation in paternal reporting, a sensitivity ana-
lysis was conducted to determine the influence of missing data. When
all missing paternal ages were replaced with the minimum reported
paternal age (11 years), mean paternal age still rose between

Paternal age is rising

 1972–1975 and 2011–2015 from 25.9 to 27.6 years. Mean paternal
age also rose when the median (29 years) and maximum (88 years)
ages were replaced, from 27.8 to 30.7 years, and from 33.9 to 40.9
years, respectively. Replacing the missing ages of Black fathers with the
minimum paternal age or the missing ages of White fathers with the
maximum paternal age did not affect the overall trend. When all Black
fathers with unreported ages were assumed to be 11 years old, the
mean paternal age increased from 27.5 to 31.0 years and the age of
Black fathers in particular increased from 26.0 to 30.1 years over the
study period. A similar analysis with White fathers also demonstrated
an increasing temporal trend in paternal age over the study period.
Discussion
The mean paternal age in the USA has increased since 1972. This
trend is present among all races/ethnicities, levels of educational
attainment, and geographic regions in the USA. The current paternal
age trend is similar to that reported for US mothers (Matthews and
Hamilton, 2009; Martin et al., 2015). In addition, the age difference
between fathers and mothers has declined over the past 4 decades.
While paternal reporting on birth certificates has improved in recent
years, paternal data remain absent on over 10% of births in the USA.
Known paternity is associated with maternal characteristics (e.g. age,
race and education). In an effort to reduce the bias introduced by pater-
nal under-reporting, we utilized IPW to adjust our estimates. We also
performed a sensitivity analysis to impute missing data by the minimum,
median and maximum values of paternal ages. As expected, the paternal
age was still found to rise and no qualitative changes in our results were
noted.
Similar trends of increasing paternal age have been reported in other
countries. In Germany, the median age of fathers was found to rise
from 31.3 to 33.1 years between 1991 and 1999. Reasons cited for
this delay were similar to those espoused by researchers within the
USA: increased use of contraception, increased entry of women into
the labor force, and longer life expectancy (Kühnert and Nieschlag,
2004). In England, a similar trend was noted with fathers aged 35–54
years accounting for 25% of live births in 1993 compared to 40% in
2003 (Bray et al., 2006). And between 1997 and 2007, the proportion
of married men with a live birth between the ages of 45 and 49 was
found to increase from 2.1 to 3.3% (‘Birth statistics: births and patterns
of family building England and Wales (FM1),’ 2008). As in the USA,
paternal age in these two European countries appeared to be increas-
ing with more men fathering children in the fifth and sixth decades of
their lives. A study from the National Health Statistics Report released
a report in 2012 of cross sectional data involving paternal age of first
birth during 2006–2010 (Martinez et al., 2012). The authors reported

 the mean age to be 25.1 years, unchanged from 2002. Similar to the
current report, the authors identified a higher mean paternal age for
first births in men with higher educational attainment. Changing demo-
graphics may help explain these findings. College educated fathers had
the highest mean paternal age and may have delayed having children
based on their or their partners’ career goals. However this correl-
ation cannot be appropriately confirmed by our study and remains
purely speculative. Regional differences were also apparent as the
Northeastern and Western states had the highest mean paternal age.
In addition to implications for demographic and public health factors,
in recent years, the impact of paternal aging directly on fetal health and
pregnancy outcomes has been extensively studied (Matthews and
Hamilton, 2009). As men age, the quality of their semen declines
(Wiener-Megnazi et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2015). In addition to
delayed time to conception, the effects of advanced paternal age on
offspring health can be significant. Numerous reports have found
increased risk of autism, psychiatric illness, neurologic disease such as
neurofibromatosis, pediatric cancer and chromosomal abnormalities
in children born to older fathers (Bray et al., 2006; Croen et al., 2007;
Puleo et al., 2012; Snajderova et al., 2012; Gratten et al., 2016). In fact,
it is estimated that the male germline develops two mutations every
year (Kong et al., 2012). Thus, as paternal age increases, the inherited
mutations in the population will also rise which may have public health
implications. Indeed, births to fathers over 40, a definition many
researchers suggest constitutes an ‘older father’ has more than
doubled over the past 4 decades and now comprises nearly 9% of all
births in the USA (Bray et al., 2006; Toriello and Meck, 2008; Frans
et al., 2015). Importantly, our study is limited to live births and thus
will not include pregnancies ending in miscarriage (to which older men
contribute a higher risk) (Bray et al., 2006).
However, there may also be benefits to increasing paternal age. The
percentage of births with a known father, as specified by the child’s birth
certificate, has risen relatively concurrently with paternal age with a few
exceptions. A report by the National Survey of Family Growth con-
cluded that fathers aged 35–44 were indeed more likely to live with their
children, thus having more involvement in child rearing, than fathers
aged 15–24 (Jones and Mosher, 2013). Furthermore, evidence suggests
that the presence of the father’s name on a child’s birth certificate is
associated with improved fetal health and lower infant mortality, though
the reason remains unknown (Gaudino et al., 1999). The rising rates of
known paternity (especially among races with historically low paternal
reporting) is certainly reassuring but deserves further investigation.
The limitations of the Vital Statistics System for perinatal research are
well delineated. Although birth certificates are comprehensive for mater-
nal and infant characteristics, data on the father are occasionally missing
or incomplete. While missing data are associated with certain sociodemo-
graphic factors (e.g. maternal age, education and race), the trends of
increasing paternal age were present across all demographic strata quer-
ied suggesting a universal trend. We also performed a sensitivity analysis
substituting the highest and lowest possible paternal ages for births with
missing data and identified similar temporal trends. In addition, as the
racial/ethnicity categories varied over the study period, some trends may
have experienced small fluctuations as categories were broadened. And
finally, before 1985 some states only partially reported natality data
detracting from the comprehensiveness of our findings.
Nevertheless, by utilizing the birth data from the NCHS and imputa-
tional analysis, we were able to identify the increasing paternal age
over the past 44 years in the USA. Our findings substantiate the need
for further research on the health and social implications of older
fathers, as paternal age is indeed rising within the USA.
