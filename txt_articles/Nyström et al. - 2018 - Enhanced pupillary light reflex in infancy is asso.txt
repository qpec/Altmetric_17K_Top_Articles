Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting around 1% of
the population. We previously discovered that infant siblings of children with ASD had
stronger pupillary light reflexes compared to low-risk infants, a result which contrasts sharply
with the weak pupillary light reflex typically seen in both children and adults with ASD.
Here, we show that on average the relative constriction of the pupillary light reflex is larger in
9–10-month-old high risk infant siblings who receive an ASD diagnosis at 36 months,
compared both to those who do not and to low-risk controls. We also found that the
magnitude of the pupillary light reflex in infancy is associated with symptom severity at
follow-up. This study indicates an important role of sensory atypicalities in the etiology of
ASD, and suggests that pupillometry, if further developed and refined, could facilitate risk
assessment in infants.

 A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous, heri-
table, and common condition characterized by early
onset alterations in social communication and interaction
alongside stereotyped behaviors, intense interests, and sensory
atypicalities1. ASD is typically chronic, and associated with
functional impairment, mental health issues, and low quality
of life. Although the etiology of ASD is both complex and
heterogeneous, genetic, and environmental factors are believed to
converge in a limited number of biological pathways related to
brain development during the first years of life2,3. Yet, the precise
mechanisms involved remain uncertain. Moreover, there is
no
evidence-based
pharmacological
treatment
convincingly
demonstrating improvement of the core symptoms of ASD, and
behavioral interventions are time consuming and typically of
moderate effect4. Consequently, there is a strong need to identify
new measures that can illuminate the underlying biological
processes, assist early risk assessment, and facilitate clinical
stratification and evaluation of treatment efficacy5.
The pupillary light reflex (PLR) regulates the amount of light
that reaches the retina, and the reflex pathway involves the
ganglion
cells
of
the
retina,
the
Pretectal
nucleus,
the
Edinger–Westphal nucleus, and the Cilary ganglia6. Several stu-
dies indicate an attenuated PLR in children and adults with an
ASD diagnosis relative to controls7,8. In children with ASD, the
relative constriction (but not the latency) of the reflex is corre-
lated to the amount of their sensory atypicalities9. Surprisingly,
we recently discovered that unlike children and adults with an
ASD diagnosis7,8, 10-month-old infants at high risk for ASD (due
to having an older sibling with the disorder) had stronger PLRs
than low-risk-control infants with no family history of ASD10.
This finding raised the possibility that the PLR might not only
associate with ASD, it might also describe neurodevelopmental
processes that are on an atypical trajectory in infants that will
develop this disorder. However, the previous study10 did not
include any outcome data, neither in terms of categorical
diagnostic outcome nor dimensional measures of ASD traits,
which is crucial in order to confirm the hypothesized link
between enhanced PLRs in infancy and ASD.
Here, we followed up the infants in our previous study (the
EASE sample)10 to 3 years, an age when ASD can be diagnosed
with high accuracy. To increase the sample size we also included a
second dataset from the BASIS group (BASIS sample). Our
combined sample of n = 187, with 29 ASD participants, offered
increased power for testing our main hypothesis—that infants
with later ASD have stronger PLRs than typically developing
(TD) infants10. Unless otherwise specified, we will report the
results based on the combined EASE and BASIS samples
(see Supplementary Methods for site-specific information), using
three groups: 1) high risk infants later diagnosed with ASD
(HR-ASD); 2) high risk infants who did not receive an ASD
diagnosis at follow up (HR-no-ASD); 3) a control group of TD
infants. We also analyzed the pupil data longitudinally in infancy
to see if we could find support for the presence of different
developmental trajectories of the reflex in ASD vs. controls.
Results
PLR at 9–10 months in relation to later diagnosis. The statis-
tical analysis revealed a significant main effects of group in terms
of the relative constriction of the PLR, F(2, 184) = 6.4, P = 0.002,
ηp² = 0.065. Planned comparisons between groups showed that
the HR-ASD group differed from the other groups: HR-ASD vs.
TD, P = 0.001, 95% CI (0.087 to 0.307); HR-ASD vs. HR-no-
ASD, P = 0.006, 95% CI (0.039 to 0.226); HR-no-ASD vs. TD,
P = 0.122, 95% CI (−0.018 to 0.0.147). The following statistics
represent the data as plotted in Fig. 1b: TD, n = 40, mean = 1.00,
SD = 0.21;
HR-no-ASD,
n = 118,
mean = 1.06,
SD = 0.23;
HR-ASD, n = 29, mean = 1.20, SD = 0.24. Adding the Mullen
Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) 10 months total score, data
quality (amount of missing data) or gender as covariates did
not change these results (see Supplementary Note 1 and
Supplementary Figs. 1-2 for details).
No significant effects of group on PLR latency were found:
F = (2,
184) = 2.268,
P = 0.106,
ηp² = 0.024,
and
planned
comparisons showed no significant differences between any pair
of groups. More details about the latency results, as well as an
analysis of the baseline pupil size (which did not differ between
groups) is found in Supplementary Note 2, and details for each
site separately is found in Supplementary Note 3.

Autism

Interview-Revised
(ADI-R) algorithm scores and Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) comparison scores (CS) and the PLR
measures. We excluded the TD group in these dimensional
analyses. No significant correlations were found for the latency
measure, but there were significant correlations between ADI-R
and relative constriction (n = 142, r = 0.197, P = 0.019), and
between
ADOS-2
CS
and
relative
constriction
(n = 144,
r = 0.196, P = 0.018; Fig. 2a, b). We also assessed the relation
between relative constriction and the two subscales of the ADOS-
2, and found that relative constriction was significantly associated
with the social affect comparison scores (SA CS) (n = 144,
r = 0.218, P = 0.009), but not the restrictive repetitive behaviors
(RRB) algorithm scores (n = 144, r = 0.136, P = 0.103; Fig. 2c, d).
Site did not moderate these correlations. Including the TD group
in the analysis (i.e., analyzing all children together) resulted in a
similar result, except that the RRB scale now showed a trend in
the same direction (ADI-R total n = 175, r = 0.193, P = 0.010;
ADOS CS n = 179, r = 0.216, P = 0.004; ADOS SA CS n = 179,
r = 0.230, P = 0.002; ADOS RRB n = 179, r = 0.140, P = 0.062;
Supplementary Fig. 3).
Longitudinal analysis of the PLR. Finally, we tested if group
difference in pupil relative constriction changed over time8,10.
This was possible because the infants had longitudinal pupil
assessments available at 14 months (EASE sample) and at
15 months (BASIS sample). As above, the TD group’s perfor-
mance at the first time point was used for normalization for all
groups/timepoints within sites. As a measure of change, we
subtracted each infant’s relative constriction measure at the first
time point from that individual’s relative constriction measure at
the second time point. Values >0 indicated increased constriction
over time and values <0 indicated decreased constriction
(descriptive statistics: HR-ASD n = 21, mean = -0.057, SD =
0.214;
HR-no-ASD
n = 93,
mean = 0.051,
SD = 0.256;
TD
n = 27, mean = 0.102, SD = 0.248). Using this difference score as
our dependent measure and group as fixed factor, we found a
marginally significant main effect of group, F(2, 138) = 2.51,
P = 0.085, ηp² = 0.035 (this is analogous to an interaction effect
using repeated measures ANOVA with a group factor and an age
factor: the statistics are identical). Planned comparisons between
the groups showed a significant difference between the HR-ASD
group and the TD group, P = 0.030 (95% CI (−0.303 to −0.016)),
and marginally between the HR-ASD and the HR-no-ASD
groups, P = 0.074 (95% CI (−0.228 to 0.011)), but not between
the HR-no-ASD and TD groups, P = 0.352 (95% CI (−0.159 to
0.057)). This longitudinal analysis supported the hypothesis of
different developmental trajectories in terms of the relative con-
striction of the PLR constriction for the TD and HR-ASD group.
This finding is generally in line with the possibility that group
differences in the PLR reverse over time (see Supplementary
Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4 for more descriptive statistics).
Discussion
The results of this study show that that the magnitude of
constriction of the pupil in response to changes in light in infancy
is associated with ASD diagnosis at 3 years of age. The HR-ASD
group differed both from the HR-no-ASD group and the TD
group. The HR-no-ASD group is at elevated risk for a range of
developmental difficulties such as cognitive and motor delays,
language
problems,
and
difficulties
with
attention
and
hyperactivity;11 hence it is a clinically relevant comparison group.
That the group differences were paralleled by the results of the
dimensional analysis (Fig. 2) suggests that the PLR is associated
with later ASD symptom severity, not only categorically defined
ASD. This finding is consistent with the view that ASD should be
seen as the extreme end of a neurodevelopmental continuum
encompassing the whole population12 (see also Supplementary
Fig. 3).
An atypical PLR appears more likely to index general
atypicalities in brain development than selective disruptions of
the so-called ‘social brain’ (for discussion, see ref. 13). More

 specifically, because the PLR relative constriction reliably tracks
the amount of sensory atypicalities in older children with ASD9,
our finding suggests that atypicalities in neural systems involved
in sensory processing could play an important role in the early
development of ASD3,14. We found significant prospective cor-
relations for the SA (social affect) domain of the ADOS-2, but it
should be noted that a (non-significant) trend in the same
direction was also found for the behavioral flexibility (RRB)
domain. Although more research is needed to clarify these rela-
tions, our results are generally in line with the idea that early
emerging atypicalities in sensory processing constitute a unitary
explanation for multiple symptom domains in ASD.
It has been hypothesized that because the PLR pathway is
acetylcholine dependent, PLR atypicalities in ASD could reflect
the disruptions of the cholinergic system10,15–17, which plays a
key role in the regulation of excitatory–inhibitory balance early in
life18,19. A recent small sample study indicated that maternal
phosphatidylcholine
treatment
altered
sensory
processing
(prepulse
inhibition)
in
infancy
and
prevented
social
withdrawal in early childhood via activation of the a7-nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor19—a receptor type which mediates the
PLR in some animal species20. However, cholinergic disruption is
not the only possible explanation for the results. For example,
one study indicated that the reflex is mediated in part by
N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in humans21, a
receptor type that has been linked to ASD in several studies
(e.g., ref. 22). Top down influences, originating outside the reflex
arc itself, could also contribute to the observed effects23,24.
Most likely, a combination
of animal,
molecular genetic,
and human behavior/imaging research is best suited to shine
light on the exact mechanisms driving the atypicalities observed
here5.
Our result supports the idea that group differences in PLR
parameters may change over time (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Although we did not observe a crossing over within our samples,
we did observe a significant difference between the change scores
in the TD and the HR-ASD groups, which is rather striking given
that this analysis was based on data spanning only a few months
in infancy. These findings are theoretically important, as any
explanation for the result would need to encompass the devel-
opmental unfolding of these processes. These results are also
encouraging from a clinical point of view, as they suggest that
group differences may be even more pronounced earlier in
development which could facilitate early detection.
The study has some important limitations. First, the results are
based on pupil data from two sites using a non-identical meth-
odology. Future studies would benefit from including data from a
larger number of infants being tested under similar conditions.
However, the use of different paradigms to elicit the PLR is also a
strong point of this research, since it demonstrates that this
finding is robust to experimental changes. PLR was opportunis-
tically measured in the BASIS sample. This will hopefully
encourage other groups to take a similar approach to existing data
and replicate our findings. Second, the combination of data from
two sites can be done in different ways, and we used the TD
group as basis for normalization across sites. This builds on the
assumption that the characteristics of the TD group are similar in
both sites. However, we do show that the overall pattern of result
remains when using any of the other groups as a basis for nor-
malization (Supplementary Note 1). Although the results need to
be interpreted with some caution due to these constraints, the
findings nevertheless provide strong initial evidence that early
pupillary atypicalities are related to later neurodevelopmental
problems.
In sum, this study indicates that the pupil provides a unique
and
previously
unrecognized
window
into
the
neural
development of human infants, and could contribute to early
detection of ASD. Other and larger studies of infants at risk are
ongoing; these studies may illuminate whether the PLR is useful
for defining sub-groups within the ASD population5.
Methods
Subjects and procedures. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Board
in Stockholm (EASE sample) and UK National Health Service, National Research
Ethics Service London REC 08/H0718/76 (BASIS sample). Parents provided
written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki.
A total of 208 9–10-month-old participated in the experiments at the two sites.
High risk infants with an older sibling with ASD (n = 163, 77 girls) (HR infants)
were recruited from the projects’ websites, advertisements, and via clinical units.
Low-risk-control infants with typical development (TD infants) with no family
history (up to second degree) of ASD (n = 45, 21 girls) were recruited from birth
records or advertisements. All infants were born full-term (≥36 weeks), and did not
have any confirmed or suspected medical conditions, including visual/auditory
impairments. Of the initial sample of 208 infants, 187 contributed data to the final
analyses (Table 1; see Supplementary Methods for details).
At 36 months, we collected standardized information on medical history,
current developmental, and adaptive level, as well as autistic symptoms using the
ADI-R25, the ADOS-226, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales27, and MSEL28.
The clinical evaluation was conducted without blindness to risk group by
experienced clinical researchers (psychologists) with demonstrated research-level
reliability. Based on the information, final DSM-5 judgements were made by a
senior clinical researcher, and participants were assigned either to the ASD group, a
high-risk without ASD group or a low-risk control group (Table 1).
In the EASE sample, pupil data were collected on a Tobii 1750 eye tracker
(Tobii Technology, Danderyd, Sweden) with a sampling rate of 50 Hz in a room
with a controlled ambient light level of 0.9 lux. The stimulus lasted ~6 s and
consisted of a small central fixation point on a black background (0.9 lux) that
flashed white (190 lux) for 75 ms with a random onset between 1600 and 2400 ms.
The stimulus was presented 16 times to each infant. In the BASIS sample, pupil
data were collected on a Tobii T120 eye tracker (Tobii Technology, Danderyd,
Sweden) with a sampling rate of 60 Hz. The stimulus was presented 32 times to the
participants and consisted in a small 1 s animation presented on a white
background, followed by a black screen with a mean duration of 313 ms (SD = 140
ms), followed by another white background stimulus, lasting for 1.5 s(the same
stimuli used in ref. 29), which induced a reliable PLR response.
Data analysis. In line with previous research, the PLR was evaluated both in terms
of its relative constriction and its latency7,8,10. The relative pupil constriction was
calculated as in Fan et al.7 by the formula (A02 − Am2)/A02, where A0 is the average
pupil diameter before onset of the PLR (during an interval starting 100 ms before
and ending at the PLR onset, as determined by the PLR latency) and Am is the
minimum pupil diameter in the interval 500–1500 ms relative to the stimulus onset
(Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Methods). In accordance with previous work10,30, the
PLR latency was defined at the acceleration minimum between flash onset and
minimum pupil diameter for each trial. All PLR response values were normalized
through division by the average of the TD group in each site separately; i.e., values
>1 are higher than the TD average and values <1 are lower (see Supplementary
Note 1 for more details of the transformation and raw data from both sites). This
approach was used to account for differences in experimental settings between the
EASE and BASIS cohort. All statistical tests were performed in SPSS (IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0) using two-tailed (α = 0.05) general linear
models (GLMs) with group as fixed factor. Preliminary models tested whether site
(EASE/BASIS) or baseline pupil size (as covariate) interacted with group status, but
because these variables did not moderate the group differences, neither for the
relative constriction measure (group X site F(2, 178) = 1.945, P = 0.146; group X
baseline F(2, 178) = 0.512, P = 0.600) nor for the latency measure (group X site F
(2, 178) = 2.027, P = 0.135; group X baseline F(2, 178) = 1.798, P = 0.169), the site
and baseline factors were therefore dropped from the final models. All measures
met the assumption of equal error variances as assessed by the Levene’s test unless
otherwise stated, and the normality of model residual distributions were confirmed
using Q–Q plots. The mean value from all trials for each subject was used as the
dependent variable.
Data availability. The PLR analysis workflow was implemented in the TimeStudio
framework31 and is publicly available with sensitive information removed
(uwid=ts-100-71f) through the TimeStudio software. Relevant data are available
