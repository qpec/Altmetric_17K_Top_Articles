IMPORTANCE Estimates of lifetime risk may help raise awareness of the extent to which
educational inequalities are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
OBJECTIVE To estimate lifetime risks of CVD according to categories of educational
attainment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants were followed from 1987 through
December 31, 2013. All CVD events (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) were
confirmed by physician review and International Classification of Diseases codes. A total of
13 948 whites and African Americans who were 45 to 64 years old and free of CVD at baseline
were included from 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North
Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota). The data analysis was
performed from June 7 to August 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES Educational attainment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used a life table approach to estimate lifetime risks of
CVD from age 45 through 85 years according to educational attainment. We adjusted for
competing risks of death from underlying causes other than CVD.
RESULTS The sample of 13 948 participants was 56% female and 27% African American.
During 269 210 person-years of follow-up, we documented 4512 CVD events and 2401
non-CVD deaths. Educational attainment displayed an inverse dose-response relation with
cumulative risk of CVD, which became evident in middle age, with the most striking gap
between those not completing vs completing high school. In men, lifetime risks of CVD were
59.0% (95% CI, 54.0%-64.1%) for grade school, 52.5% (95% CI, 47.7%-56.8%) for high
school education without graduation, 50.9% (95% CI, 47.3%-53.9%) for high school
graduation, 47.2% (95% CI, 41.5%-52.5%) for vocational school, 46.4% (95% CI,
42.8%-49.6%) for college with or without graduation, and 42.2% (95% CI, 36.6%-47.0%) for
graduate/professional school; in women, 50.8% (95% CI, 45.7%-55.8%), 49.3% (95% CI,
45.1%-53.1%), 36.3% (95% CI, 33.4%-39.1%), 32.2% (95% CI, 26.0%-37.3%), 32.8% (95% CI,
29.1%-35.9%), and 28.0% (95% CI, 21.9%-33.3%), respectively. Educational attainment was
inversely associated with CVD even within categories of family income, income change,
occupation, or parental educational level.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More than 1 in 2 individuals with less than high school
education had a lifetime CVD event. Educational attainment was inversely associated with
the lifetime risk of CVD, regardless of other important socioeconomic characteristics. Our
findings emphasize the need for further efforts to reduce CVD inequalities related to
educational disparities.

 I
nequalities in cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the
leading cause of death in the world, are due in part to in-
equalities in socioeconomic status such as education, oc-
cupation, and income, and present a major and persistent pub-
lic health challenge across industrialized nations.1 Educational
inequality is one of the most important socioeconomic fac-
tors contributing to CVD.2,3 Greater education tends to be as-
sociated with healthier behaviors, occupations with healthier
working conditions, and better access to health care.4-8 Be-
cause education is typically completed by young adulthood,
educational inequality may affect risk of CVD early in the life
course7 and thus increase the probability of premature death.
Therefore, interventions to correct educational inequalities at
the community or individual level may not only reduce CVD
rates but also improve life expectancy.9
One way to convey the importance of educational attain-
ment is to calculate the lifetime risk of CVD according to edu-
cational levels. Lifetime risk estimates, that is, absolute risks
through various ages, can readily convey the burden of CVD
in a population10 and potentially increase public awareness,
as demonstrated for lifetime risk of breast cancer.11 Yet, to our
knowledge, there has been no study so far estimating life-
time risks of CVD according to educational attainment.
We evaluated the association between educational attain-
mentandCVDriskbyestimatingthelifetimerisksofCVD(coro-
nary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) in a large biracial
cohort study. In addition, we also assessed how other impor-
tant socioeconomic factors (income, occupation, and paren-
tal education) were related to the association between educa-
tional attainment and lifetime CVD risk.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Population
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is an
ongoing population-based prospective study of CVD.12 In 1987
through 1989, the ARIC study recruited and examined 15 792
mostly white or African American men and women aged 45
to 64 years from 4 US communities. The participants were re-
examined in 1996 through 1998 (visit 4, 80% return). See
eMethods in the Supplement for additional details. The insti-
tutional review boards of the collaborating institutions (Uni-
versityofNorthCarolinaatChapelHill,ChapelHill,NorthCaro-
lina;WakeForestBaptistMedicalCenter,Winston-Salem,North
Carolina; University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson,
Mississippi; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minne-
sota; and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland)
approved the study protocol, and each participant provided
written informed consent.
Risk Factor Measurements
The main exposure of interest was self-reported educational
attainment, ascertained at ARIC baseline, and categorized into
6 levels: (1) grade school, (2) high school without graduation,
(3) high school with graduation, (4) vocational school, (5) col-
lege with or without graduation, and (6) graduate or profes-
sional school.
We assessed other potential CVD risk factors as follows: so-
cioeconomic status; family income (<$5000, $5000-$7999,
$8000-$11 999, $12 000-$15 999, $16 000-$23 999, $24 000-
$34 999, $35 000-$49 999, or >$50 000); occupation for the
longest period (“precision jobs” [mechanic, repairman, con-
structionworker,orcraftsman],“servicejobs”[hairdresser,do-
mestic, restaurant, or security], “machine-operating jobs”
[driver, machine operator, sanitation, or laborer], “technical
andsalesjobs”[technician,sales,orclerical],“professionaland
managerial jobs,” and “homemaker”); and parental educa-
tional attainment (using the aforementioned levels). See
eMethods in the Supplement for additional details.
Confirmation of CVD
We defined incident CVD events as coronary heart disease,
heart failure, and stroke. ARIC staff contacted participants an-
nually by telephone to capture all hospitalizations and deaths
related to possible CVD.13 See eMethods in the Supplement for
additional details.
Statistical Analysis
SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc) was used for sta-
tistical analyses. All statistical tests were 2 sided and P< .05
was regarded as significant.
We excluded participants who self-reported prebaseline
CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke) or had
electrocardiographic evidence of prebaseline coronary heart
disease (n = 1553) and participants whose data on educa-
tionalattainmentoroutcomestatusweremissing(n = 291).Af-
ter exclusions, 13 948 participants were available for these
analyses.
Participants were observed from age at baseline to age at
CVD event, age at last follow-up contact, or December 31,
2013, whichever came first. We included the first-ever coro-
nary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke event as the inci-
dent CVD event. We estimated remaining lifetime risks of
CVD using a modified version of survival analysis.14 See
eMethods in the Supplement for additional details. Results
unadjusted and adjusted for competing risks in relation to
educational attainment and lifetime risk of CVD are given in
the eTable in the Supplement. We also estimated the lifetime
risk of CVD according to family income, occupation, and
parental educational attainment and evaluated the associa-
tions of these variables and individual educational attain-
Key Points
Question What are lifetime risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
according to educational attainment?
Findings This population-based observational study found that in
men, lifetime CVD risks from 45 through 85 years ranged from
59.0% for grade school to 42.2% for graduate/professional school
education; in women, from 50.8% to 28.0%, respectively.
Educational attainment was inversely associated with lifetime CVD
risks, regardless of other important socioeconomic characteristics.
Meaning Our findings emphasize the need for further efforts to
reduce CVD inequalities related to educational disparities.

 ment jointly with the lifetime CVD risk. After identical exclu-
sions as described herein, 13 128 participants (94%) had
baseline income data. Similarly, 9381, 9609, and 8963 par-
ticipants who were free of CVD at that time completed the
visit 4 questionnaire on income, occupation, and parental
education, respectively, among whom we estimated lifetime
risk of CVD from age 55 to 85 years.
In sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated the association
between educational attainment and lifetime risk of CVD by
stratifying on CVD risk factors (family income [<$35 000 vs
≥$35 000],occupation[occupationswiththe3highestvs3low-
est lifetime risks of CVD], parental educational attainment
[non–high school graduates vs high school graduates], mari-
tal status, smoking status [current vs former vs never], drink-
ing status [current vs former vs never], physical inactivity, diet
[healthy diet score ≤1 vs healthy diet score ≥2], obesity, hy-
pertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, subclinical ath-
erosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and chronic kid-
neydisease).Next,weestimatedlifetimerisksofCVDaccording
to family income at visit 4 instead of visit 1. Finally, we also
evaluatedtheassociationbetweeneducationalattainmentand
lifetimerisksofCVDbystratifyingbirthyears(individualsborn
before1935[55-64yearsatbaseline]vsafter1935[45-54years])
to assess birth cohort effects.

Educational Attainment and Risk Factors for CVD
As presented in Table 1, individuals with a higher educational
attainmentwerelikelytohavehighersocioeconomicstatusand
were less likely to have unhealthy lifestyle factors, health im-
pairments, and subclinical organ damage. Those with higher
educational attainment were more likely to be current drink-
ers, but current drinkers with lower educational attainment
consumed more alcohol.
Educational Attainment and Lifetime Risk of CVD
During 1987 through 2013, 13 948 participants (6108 men and
7840 women) provided 269 210 person-years of observation.
Duringthefollow-up,wedocumented4512incidentCVD(coro-
nary heart disease, heart failure, or stroke) events and 2401
non-CVD deaths. The overall lifetime risks to age 85 years of
CVD were 48.6% (95% CI, 46.5%-50.4%) for white men, 34.3%
(95%CI,32.3%-36.2%)forwhitewomen,51.8%(95%CI,47.8%-
55.1%) for African American men, and 44.8% (95% CI, 41.6%-
47.6%) for African American women.
The lifetime risks of CVD after age 45 years according to
educational attainment are given in Table 2 and illustrated in
Figure 1. Educational attainment displayed inverse dose-
response relations with lifetime risks of CVD in both men and
women. Lifetime risk estimates though 85 years were 55.0%
(95% CI, 51.4%-58.6%) in all participants, 59.0% (95% CI,
54.0%-64.1%) in men, and 50.8% (95% CI, 45.7%-55.8%) in
women for the lowest attainment (grade school) and 36.1%
(95% CI, 31.9%-39.7%) in all participants, 42.2% (95% CI,
36.6%-47.0%) in men, and 28.0% (95% CI, 21.9%-33.3%) in
women for the highest attainment (graduate/professional
school). Through age 65 years, the cumulative CVD risk esti-
mates were 25.6% (95% CI, 21.2%-30.0%) in all participants,
30.2% (95% CI, 23.5%-36.9%) in men, and 21.2% (95% CI,
15.6%-26.9%) in women for the lowest educational attain-
ment vs 10.1% (95% CI, 8.3%-12.0%) in all participants, 13.8%
(95% CI, 10.9%-16.6%) in men, and 5.6% (95% CI, 3.5%-7.7%)
in women for the highest educational attainment. Race-
specific educational attainment showed similar inverse dose-
response relations with lifetime CVD risks (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). A wide gap in the lifetime risks of CVD was ob-
served between those without high school graduation vs with
high school graduation, particularly in women. In all partici-
pants, the lifetime risks of CVD from 45 through 85 years were
51.9% (95% CI, 49.5%-54.1%) for non–high school graduates
and 39.9% (95% CI, 38.4%-41.2%) for high school graduates;
in men, 54.9% (95% CI, 51.5%-58.1%) and 47.4% (95% CI,
45.2%-49.3%); and in women, 49.4% (95% CI, 46.2%-52.3%)
and 33.8% (95% CI, 31.9%-35.6%), respectively (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement).
Joint Associations
As shown in Figure 2A, family income also showed inverse
dose-response relations with lifetime risk of CVD. For ex-
ample, lifetime risks of CVD at age 45 to 85 years were 45.2%
(95% CI, 42.1%-48.0%) for those with annual income of
$16 000-23 999, 39.5% (95% CI, 36.5-42.3%) for $35 000-
49 999,and36.2%(95%CI,33.3-38.7%)formorethan$50 000.
We also assessed the association of income changes from visit
1tovisit4withlifetimeCVDriskfrom55to85years(Figure2B).
Lifetime risks of CVD were 45.6% (95% CI, 40.8%-51.6%) for
individuals with income consistently less than $35 000, 45.9%
(95% CI, 39.7%-52.4%) for those whose income increased from
less than $35 000 to $35 000 or more, 44.1% (95% CI, 38.7%-
49.2%) for those whose income decreased from $35 000 or
more to less than $35 000, and 36.3% (95% CI, 34.5%-37.9%)

risk between 55 and 85 years (compare slopes in Figure 2B).
As shown in Figure 3, high school graduates had lower life-
time risks of CVD than non–high school graduates, regardless
of their family income or income changes. Lifetime risks from
45 to 85 years were 52.4% (95% CI, 49.8%-54.9%) for non–
high school graduates with family income less than $35 000,
48.7% (95% CI, 41.5%-54.8%) for non–high school graduates
with income of at least $35 000, 43.3% (95% CI, 41.2%-
45.2%) for high school graduates with income less than
$35 000, and 36.7% (95% CI, 34.5%-38.6%) for high school
graduates with income of at least $35 000. The cumulative risk
of CVD for non–high school graduates whose income de-
creased from at least $35 000 to less than $35 000 increased
more during their remaining life course, and their lifetime risk
was 53.7% (95% CI, 45.1%-61.8%). In contrast, the cumula-
tive risk for those with more than high school education whose
income decreased from at least $35 000 to less than $35 000
had a less steep rise in lifetime CVD risk, and their lifetime risk
was 38.8% (95% CI, 31.8%-45.1%).
We also assessed the associations of occupation and pa-
rental educational attainment with lifetime risks of CVD (eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement). Lifetime risks of CVD were higher
successively for “precision jobs,” “service jobs,” “machine-
operating jobs,” “technical and sales jobs,” “professional and
managerial jobs,” and “homemaker.” Parental educational at-
tainment showed an inverse dose-response relation with life-
time risks of CVD. Participants who were at least high school
graduateshadlowerlifetimerisksofCVDthannon–highschool

cational attainment (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analysis
Analyses stratified by CVD risk factors all showed similar in-
verse dose-response relations between educational attain-
ment and lifetime risk of CVD (data not shown). Income data
at visit 4 showed an inverse dose-response relation with CVD

 lifetime risk from 55 to 85 years similar to that for visit 1 in-
come (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Finally, lifetime risks of
CVD in individuals born before and after 1935 showed similar
inverse-dose response relations with educational attain-
ment, but differences of lifetime CVD risks between educa-
tion levels appeared smaller in the older age category (eFig-
ure 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Principal Findings
Educational attainment showed an inverse dose-response re-
lation with lifetime risk of CVD. Men and women with the low-
est education level had lifetime CVD risks of approximately
60% and 50%, respectively, while those with the highest edu-
cationlevelhadapproximately40%and30%lifetimeCVDrisks
(ie, 20% lower “attributable risk” in the highest educational
attainment group). This gap in cumulative risk was already evi-
dent during middle age. Individuals with more than a high
school education had a lower lifetime risk than those with less
educational attainment, regardless of their income, income
change, occupation, or parental educational attainment. Al-
though socioeconomic disparities in CVD risk are well estab-
lished, this is the first estimate of how these disparities trans-
late into lifetime CVD risk in a US cohort.
Interpretation and Public Health Implications
Allowing for variability by CVD risk factor, the following
2 mechanisms have been proposed for an association between
educational attainment and CVD risk.15 First, CVD risk factors
plausibly mediate the association of low education with
CVD5-7,16-18andgreatereducationcontributestocognitiveskills,
problem-solving ability, learned effectiveness, personal con-
trol, and economic resources.19 In fact, educational attain-
ment in ARIC was correlated with other socioeconomic status
variables and CVD risk factors. In this scenario, interventions
toenhancehigheducationalattainmentmightbeeffective.Sec-
ond,someCVDriskfactorsmayalsooperateasconfoundingfac-
tors, rather than as mediators, between low educational attain-
ment and CVD. For example, disabilities, including learning
disabilities, may make educational achievements difficult and
at the same time increase lifestyle-related CVD risk. Under this
scenario, we may have overestimated the association between
educational attainment and lifetime CVD risk to some extent.
It seems unlikely however that reverse causality (ie, subclini-
cal CVD leading to lower educational attainment) played a big
role in this or similar studies, as most educational attainment
is finished before chronic diseases become prevalent, and we
excluded participants with a clinical history of CVD.
The lifetime risk method cannot directly assess which in-
termediate risk factors explain the association of education
with lifetime CVD risk. However, our Table 1 and multiple pub-
lications have shown that people with less formal education
tend to have poorer CVD risk factor levels. In prior publica-
tions, the major risk factors explain much of the association
between education and CVD.6,20-22
A previous study estimated that the lifetime risks of CVD
of individuals aged 45 years who had at least 2 major risk fac-
tors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterol-
emia) were approximately 60% for men and 50% for women,
respectively,23 which correspond to lifetime CVD risks for ARIC
men and women with the lowest education level. In contrast,
lifetime CVD risks for ARIC men and women with the highest
education level were similar to those for men with only hy-
pertensionorwomenwithoutanymajorriskfactor.Thus,strat-
egies targeting individuals with lower educational attain-
ment for CVD risk factor prevention, as well as early CVD risk
factor management, might also be beneficial for correction of
inequalities in CVD.
A noteworthy finding of the present study is that educa-
tional inequalities were associated with inequalities in CVD
evenatyoungmiddleage.Infact,educationalinequalitieshave

 been shown to relate to the rate of atherosclerosis progres-
sion even in youth.7 This may also suggest the importance of
education for correction of inequalities in CVD.
Income, occupation, and parental educational attain-
ment are also important socioeconomic determinants of CVD
andlifeexpectancy.1,24,25However,thosewhocompletedmore
than high school education had a lower lifetime risk of CVD,
regardless of their income, occupation, or parental educa-
tional attainment compared with those who did not com-
plete high school. These results may suggest that whereas in-
equalities in CVD may be in part due to variation in income,
occupation, and parental education levels, an individual’
s own
educational attainment, and the associated health knowl-
edge and behaviors that education promotes, may be a criti-
cal socioeconomic determinant of CVD risk.
Income increase during middle age appeared not to be as-
sociated with CVD cumulative risk. It could be that low in-
come at younger ages might have exposed individuals to CVD
risk factors to the extent that they developed atherosclerosis,
and even if they earned more money later, they might not have
been able to reverse their risk trajectory. In contrast, income
decrease appeared to accelerate CVD cumulative risk. We
speculate that an income decrease might have led to an un-
healthier lifestyle and less access to better health resources.
However, CVD cumulative risk for individuals in those with
high educational attainment appeared to be less affected by
income change. Those with higher educational attainment
might have pursued a healthy lifestyle regardless of their per-
sonal economic changes. Thus, these findings seem to rein-
force the importance of education in lifetime CVD risk.
Our result about the association between occupations and
CVD risk is similar to a previous finding.26 Homemakers had
the lowest lifetime risk of CVD, probably because homemak-
ers in the present study included mainly women and in gen-
eral women have a lower risk of CVD than men.
Limitations
Some limitations of our study need to be mentioned. Esti-
mates of lifetime risks of CVD should be interpreted carefully
because they may be to some degree confounded by other
CVD risk factors, although as mentioned, most risk factors
would be considered mediators rather than confounders.
Even with such a proviso, our estimates of lifetime risk can
help in elucidating the association between education and
CVD risk. A second potential limitation is that estimates of
lifetime risk are subject to birth cohort effects and therefore
can change over time. For example, older participants would
have been in grade school (or even have completed their edu-
cation) during the Depression. The youngest would have
been born by the end of the Second World War, and thus in
many parts of the country they would have attended racially
segregated schools. Although the relative importance of level
of education may still be the same, where or how much the
biggest benefits occur in terms of CVD risk may have changed
over time, as shown in the present study. Finally, we had no
information on the age at which participants completed their
education. Although we may presume that most participants
completed grade school and high school at similar ages, they
might have completed any higher education at different ages.
In addition, we surveyed educational attainment only at
ARIC baseline. Thus, we cannot completely negate the possi-
bility that some participants might have had further educa-
tion even after age 45 years, during follow-up. It is unclear
whether this missing information might have affected our
findings.
Conclusions
For the first time, to our knowledge, we report the population
CVD burden for various categories of educational attainment
using lifetime risk estimates. More than 1 in 2 individuals with
less than high school education had a CVD event during his or
her lifetime. Educational attainment was inversely associ-
ated with the lifetime risk of CVD, regardless of other impor-
tantsocioeconomiccharacteristics.Ourfindingsemphasizethe
need for further efforts to reduce CVD inequalities related to
educational disparities.
