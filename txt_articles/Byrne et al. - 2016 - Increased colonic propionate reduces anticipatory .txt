ABSTRACT
Background: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites pro-
duced through the microbial fermentation of nondigestible dietary
components, have key roles in energy homeostasis. Animal research
suggests that colon-derived SCFAs modulate feeding behavior via
central mechanisms. In humans, increased colonic production of the
SCFA propionate acutely reduces energy intake. However, evidence
of an effect of colonic propionate on the human brain or reward-
based eating behavior is currently unavailable.
Objectives: We investigated the effect of increased colonic propi-
onate production on brain anticipatory reward responses during food
picture evaluation. We hypothesized that elevated colonic propionate
would reduce both reward responses and ad libitum energy intake via
stimulation of anorexigenic gut hormone secretion.
Design: In a randomized crossover design, 20 healthy nonobese men
completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) food picture
evaluation task after consumption of control inulin or inulin-propionate
ester, a unique dietary compound that selectively augments colonic pro-
pionate production. The blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal
was measured in a priori brain regions involved in reward processing,
including the caudate, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, anterior insula, and
orbitofrontal cortex (n = 18 had analyzable fMRI data).
Results: Increasing colonic propionate production reduced BOLD signal
during food picture evaluation in the caudate and nucleus accumbens. In
the caudate, the reduction in BOLD signal was driven specifically by
a lowering of the response to high-energy food. These central effects
were partnered with a decrease in subjective appeal of high-energy food
pictures and reduced energy intake during an ad libitum meal. These
observations were not related to changes in blood peptide YY (PYY),
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose, or insulin concentrations.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that colonic propionate production
may play an important role in attenuating reward-based eating behavior
via striatal pathways, independent of changes in plasma PYYand GLP-1.

INTRODUCTION
Peripheral signals communicate information about current energy
balance to the brain to maintain energy homeostasis (1). The hedonic
properties and constant availability of highly palatable energy-dense
foods promote their overconsumption and weight gain, whereas
hedonic and reward-based eating behaviors are in turn influenced by
peripheral homeostatic signals such as gut hormones (2–4). Hedonic
responses to food are thought to involve a network of corticolimbic
brain structures, and are modulated by emotional and cognitive
factors, as well as sensory cues and anticipated reward.

 There is increasing evidence that metabolites produced by the
colonic microbiota may affect central appetite regulation (5–7).
Resistant starch (RS)12 supplementation alters activation in hy-
pothalamic nuclei and gene expression of neuropeptides in-
volved in appetite regulation in rodents (5, 6). The consumption
of nondigestible carbohydrates (NDCs) also reduces energy in-
take and weight gain in animal models (8–10). Several physio-
logic benefits associated with the consumption of RS and other
NDCs may be mediated through the actions of their fermenta-
tion products, namely, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The
principal SCFAs produced via bacterial fermentation are acetate,
propionate, and butyrate, present in the colon in the approximate
molar ratio of 60:20:20 (11). Our research group demonstrated
that increasing circulating acetate directly suppresses appetite
via central hypothalamic mechanisms in rodents (7). Our recent
findings from human studies suggest that propionate may also be
an important SCFA contributing to appetite regulation (12). The
acute intake of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), which selec-
tively increases colonic propionate production, reduced ad
libitum energy intake and increased plasma concentrations of
the anorexigenic gut hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
and peptide YY (PYY), supporting results of in vitro experi-
ments (12, 13). Furthermore, a long-term elevation in colonic
propionate production protected against weight gain and re-
duced hepatic lipid content (12).
The exogenous administration of GLP-1 or its analogs and/or
PYY reduces brain reward system responses to viewing food
pictures in humans (4, 14). However, to date, to our knowledge,
there are no studies demonstrating an effect of SCFAs on human
brain food-reward responses to influence eating behavior. In the
present study, we examined the effect of an acute increase in
colonic propionate production on energy intake and brain regions
involved with reward processing and hedonic eating, includ-
ing caudate, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, anterior insula, and
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (15, 16), in healthy nonobese men in
a randomized crossover design (Figure 1). We used fMRI to
measure activation by the BOLD signal in these regions of in-
terest during an established food evaluation task that used high
energy (HE)– and low energy (LE)–density food pictures (pri-
mary outcome measure) (3, 17–19). We hypothesized that in-
creasing colonic propionate production after intake of IPE would
reduce anticipatory reward responses during evaluation of food
pictures, a measure of food cue reactivity, compared with control
inulin via the stimulation of the anorexigenic gut hormones GLP-1
and PYY (4), and would reduce ad libitum energy intake.
METHODS
Further details are given in Supplemental Methods. The
study was approved by the West London Research Ethics
Committee (08/H0707/99) (NCT00750438).
Participants
Subjects were recruited via public advertisement and
a healthy volunteer database. Healthy men aged 18–65 y with
BMI (in kg/m2) 20–35 were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion
criteria included the following: weight gain or loss .3 kg in the
previous 3 mo, any chronic illness or gastrointestinal disorder,
history of drug or alcohol abuse in the previous 2 y, use of an-
tibiotics or medications likely to interfere with energy homeo-
stasis in the previous 3 mo, claustrophobia, contraindications for
MRI scanning, daily smoking, gluten or lactose intolerance,
consumption of a vegan or vegetarian diet, or depression as
assessed by a Beck Depression Inventory II score .10 (20).
Food supplements
IPE designed for targeted delivery of propionate to the colon
was produced as previously described (12). Inulin was chosen as
a control supplement, with the use of the same inulin used to
prepare both the IPE and control supplements. This controlled for
residual fermentation of the backbone NDC. In vitro fermenta-
tions of IPE and inulin suggest comparable increases in acetate
and butyrate production; thus, any differences in our outcome
measures can be attributed to the preferential increase in pro-
pionate production with IPE (12).
Study day protocol
Twenty healthy men participated in this randomized, placebo-
controlled, within-subject, single-blind crossover study. Subjects
attended 2 separate study visits $6 d apart after an overnight
fast. Subjects were asked to record their dietary intake; avoid
caffeine, alcohol, and strenuous exercise for 24 h before each
visit; and not smoke cigarettes for $48 h before each visit.
Study visits were conducted between April and December
2014 in the National Institute for Health Research/Wellcome
Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility, Hammersmith Hos-
pital, London, United Kingdom. Weight, height, and body fat
measurements were collected with the use of bioimpedance
analysis (BC-418 analyzer; Tanita UK). At each visit, subjects
completed a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule to measure
mood during the previous week (21). Serial venous blood
samples were collected via a peripheral cannula to assay plasma
and serum metabolite and hormone concentrations over study
visits (Figure 1).
Breath hydrogen concentration, a marker of colonic fermen-
tation (22), was measured with the use of a handheld breath
hydrogen analyzer (EC60 Gastrolyser Breath Hydrogen Monitor;
Bedfont Scientific), and twelve 100-mm visual analog scales
were completed to assess serial subjective appetite and mood
ratings (Figure 1).
At 0 min, a standard breakfast containing 10 g IPE (treatment)
or 10 g inulin (control) was provided to subjects in a randomized
order (via sealed envelope). Breakfast was a chocolate milkshake
and snack bar (574.5 kcal; 86.4 g carbohydrate, 18.8 g fat, 14.7 g
protein, and 3.2 g fiber). Lunch (180 min) was a cheese sandwich
and snack bar (558 kcal; 62.3 g carbohydrate, 24.9 g fat, 21.7 g
protein, and 2.8 g fiber).
At 300 min, subjects completed a 60-min MRI session (Sie-
mens 3T Verio MRI scanner) in the Imperial Clinical Imaging
Facility. This time point was chosen based on previous results

 from an acute study that suggest successful delivery of IPE to
the colon and increased plasma gut hormone concentrations after
240 min (12).
Finally, a savory meal of tomato and mozzarella pasta bake
(per 100 g: 129 kcal; 17.0 g carbohydrate, 3.9 g fat, 4.8 g protein,
and 3.4 g fiber) was served to subjects. Subjects were instructed to
eat until they felt comfortably full. Five of the first 12 subjects
who completed the study consumed all of the food presented at
the meal. As a result, data on food intake for these 5 subjects were
removed from analysis of ad libitum food consumption and the
amount of food presented to the final 8 subjects was increased.
fMRI scanning protocol
All subjects underwent an MRI scan from 300 to 360 min as
previously described (17–19). After an initial practice run with
the use of pictures of animals, subjects had a resting-state fMRI
scan lasting 10 min followed by the food picture fMRI paradigm
at 320 min (Figure 1). Subjects had an auditory–motor–visual
(AMV) fMRI task at 350 min, followed by collection of struc-
tural magnetic resonance brain scans, including high-resolution
T1-weighted scans for image registration (Figure 1). Whole-
brain fMRI data were acquired with T2*-weighted gradient-
echo echoplanar imaging (EPI).
Food evaluation fMRI paradigm
During the fMRI food picture paradigm, 4 types of color
photographs were presented in a block design (6 pictures/block;
each image displayed for 2500 ms) split across 2 runs as follows:
1) 60 HE foods (e.g., pizza, cakes, and chocolate), 2) 60 LE
foods (e.g., salads, vegetables, and fish), 3) 60 non–food-related
household objects (e.g., furniture and clothing), and 4) 180
blurred images of the other pictures (as a low-level baseline) in
blocks after every food or object block (17–19). While each
image was on display in the scanner, subjects were asked to rate
simultaneously how appealing each picture was to them with the
use of a 5-button hand-held keypad (1 = not at all; 5 = a lot).
Exclusion of subjects with a failure to rate .10% of the food
and object pictures at either study visit was a predefined cutoff
to ensure exclusion of data for subjects who may not be at-
tending to the task.
AMV control fMRI paradigm
An AMV control task was performed to exclude nonspecific
changes in the BOLD signal between visits, as previously de-
scribed (17–19). In a block design, subjects performed 2 of each
of the following tasks simultaneously: 1) listening to a story, 2)
tapping their right index finger once every second, or 3)
watching a 4-Hz color-flashing checkerboard.
Image processing
fMRI data processing was carried out with the use of FEAT
version 6.00, part of FSL (Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) software library; www.fmrib.ox.
ac.uk/fsl), including field map–based EPI unwarping and tem-
poral derivative and motion variables as covariates in the general
linear model, boundary-based registration of EPI to high reso-
lution structural space, and nonlinear registration to standard
space. Higher-level analysis used a fixed-effect model to com-
bine the 2 runs to determine activation for the following contrasts:
HE food . object, LE food . object, or any food (HE or LE)
compared with objects. Similar analysis was performed for the
single-run AMV paradigm including the onsets of each task
(auditory, motor, and visual) to contrast activation during per-
formance of each task with that when it was not being performed.
Whole-brain analysis
Whole-brain analysis was performed separately with the use of
FEAT v6.00 for the HE and LE contrasts with the use of a paired t
test to identify regions with significant differences in the BOLD
signal between control inulin and IPE treatments with the use of
both a voxel-wise correction false discovery rate, P , 0.05, and
a cluster-wise correction family-wise error, Z . 2.3, P , 0.05.
fMRI regions of interest
Functional regions of interest (fROIs) were determined from
average group activation in a separate cohort of 21 nonobese

 healthy subjects from a previous study (17) for any food (HE or
LE) . object in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, insula (an-
terior), caudate, and OFC brain regions (Supplemental Figure 1
and Supplemental Table 1). Similar fROIs were made for the
AMV control task as follows: superior temporal gyrus posterior
division for the secondary auditory cortex; precentral gyrus for
the primary motor cortex; and lingual gyrus for the primary
visual cortex (Supplemental Figure 2). An anatomic region of
interest for the hypothalamus was also generated with the use of
the mean of all anatomical T1 scans for the subjects in the
current study.
Comparison of fMRI activation between groups
The mean bilateral BOLD signal within each a priori fROI was
then extracted for each individual subject for the HE and LE
contrasts at each visit to measure differences between treatments.
Similar analysis was performed to compare activation in the
relevant fROIs between treatments in the AMV task.
Composite appetite score
A composite score was calculated with the use of the following
formula (23): [hunger + (100 – fullness) + desire to eat + appetite
for meal] O 4.
Blood sample preparation
Ten milliliters of blood was collected at each time point for
assay of plasma glucose (EDTA), serum insulin, and plasma gut
hormones (5 mL in lithium heparin tube containing 100 mL
aprotinin protease inhibitor; Nordic Pharma UK). All tubes were
centrifuged at 2590 3 g for 10 min at 48C. Samples were sep-
arated and frozen at 2208C until analysis.
Metabolic and hormone analysis
Glucose analysis was performed at the Department of Bio-
chemistry, Hammersmith Hospital, with the use of a ci8200
analyzer enzymatic method (Abbott Diagnostics). A human in-
sulin radioimmunoassay kit (Millipore) was used for insulin
analysis according to manufacturer’s guidelines with 50 mL
serum. PYY and GLP-1 were measured with the use of previ-
ously established in-house specific and sensitive radioimmuno-
assay (24, 25). SCFAs were measured at the Department of
Cancer and Surgery with the use of an Agilent 7000C Triple
Quadrupole GC/MS System according to a previously published
method (26). Values are expressed as means 6 SEMs.
RESULTS
Participants
Subject characteristics are given in Table 1. Two of the 20
men were removed from fMRI analysis because of poor com-
pliance with the picture evaluation task (predefined as failure to
rate overall .10% of the food and object pictures during either
study visit), leaving 18 subjects with data for fMRI analysis.
Breath hydrogen
Breath hydrogen concentrations were significantly elevated
above baseline concentrations 210 min after subjects received
either inulin or IPE and stayed significantly elevated until the end
of the study visit (Figure 2). This suggests that the fermentation
of IPE and the release of propionate in the colon occurred in
a time course similar to that previously reported (12). As ex-
pected, in a repeated-measures ANOVA, including treatment
and time as within-subject factors, there was a significant
treatment 3 time interaction in that breath hydrogen concen-
trations were significantly higher after receiving the control in-
ulin than with IPE [F(1, 19) = 3.83, P , 0.01] because of the
greater amount of fermentable carbohydrate in the control inulin
than in the IPE (10 g compared with 7.3 g).
Ad libitum energy intake
Data on energy intake for 5 subjects were removed from
analysis of ad libitum energy intake because these subjects
consumed all presented food during one or both visits (see
Methods). IPE treatment significantly reduced energy intake by
9.5% 6 5.3% [control 810.4 6 83.4 kcal (95% CI: 631.6, 989.2
kcal) compared with IPE 711.1 6 79.9 kcal (95% CI: 539.7,
882.6 kcal), t(14) = 2.41, P = 0.030] (Figure 3).
BOLD signal in food evaluation fMRI task
In 2-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA, including energy
density (ED) of food pictures and treatment as within-subject
factors and visit order as a covariate, there was a significant ED 3
treatment interaction for the BOLD signal in the caudate [F(1,
16) = 8.86, P = 0.009, Bonferroni correction P = 0.045 for
multiple regions of interest] and nucleus accumbens [F(1, 16) =
10.81, P = 0.005, Bonferroni correction P = 0.025] that favored
HE foods (Figure 4A and B), but not in the amygdala [F(1, 16)
= 1.65, P = 0.22], anterior insula [F(1, 16) = 2.65, P = 0.12], or
OFC [F(1, 16) = 0.76, P = 0.40] (Figure 4C–E).
In the caudate (Figure 4A), post hoc analysis revealed that IPE
treatment significantly reduced the BOLD signal to HE foods
[effect size: 20.078 6 0.032 (95% CI: 20.147, 20.009), P =
0.029] but not to LE foods [effect size: 20.057 6 0.037 (95%
CI: 20.134, 0.021), P = 0.14]. However, in post hoc analysis in
the nucleus accumbens (Figure 4B), IPE treatment did not sig-
nificantly reduce the BOLD signal to HE foods [effect size:
20.082 6 0.055 (95% CI: 20.198, 0.035), P = 0.16] or to LE
foods [effect size: 20.064 6 0.038 (95% CI: 20.144, 0.016),

 P = 0.11], although the direction of the IPE effect was similar to
that for the caudate.
Independent of ED, there was no significant effect of treatment
on the BOLD signal in the amygdala [F(1, 16) = 0.54, P = 0.47],
anterior insula [F(1, 16) = 0.02, P = 0.89], or OFC [F(1, 16) =
1.56, P = 0.23] (Figure 4C–E).
There was no significant correlation between the difference in
the BOLD signal to HE foods alone, or any food (HE or LE), in
the caudate (r = 20.11, P = 0.74; and r = 20.41, P = 0.18,
respectively) or nucleus accumbens (r = 20.19, P = 0.56; and
r = 20.35, P = 0.27, respectively) between treatments and the
difference in energy intake between treatments (n = 13).
In 2-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA, including ED of food
pictures and treatment as within-subject factors and visit order as
a covariate, there was no significant ED 3 treatment interaction for
the BOLD signal in the hypothalamus anatomic region of interest
[F(1, 16) = 1.61, P = 0.22] (Supplemental Figure 3). Independent
of ED, there was also no significant effect of treatment on the
BOLD signal in the hypothalamus [F(1, 16) = 1.16, P = 0.30].
In whole-brain analysis, there were no significant regional
differences in the BOLD signal for either the HE or LE food
contrasts surviving correction for multiple comparisons with the
use of a voxel-wise false discovery rate of P , 0.05 or a cluster-
wise family-wise error of Z . 2.3, P , 0.05.
BOLD signal in control fMRI task
An AMV control task was performed to look for nonspecific
changes in the BOLD signal between treatments, as previously
described (17–19). There was no significant difference in the
BOLD signal in any fROI between treatments during the control
fMRI task (1-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA including visit
order as covariate, P = 0.15–0.86; Figure 4F).
Food appeal ratings and reaction time
In 2-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA, including ED of
food pictures and treatment as within-subject factors and visit
order as a covariate, there was a significant ED 3 treatment
interaction for food appeal ratings, with a greater effect for HE
foods [F(1, 16) = 5.50, P = 0.032] (Figure 5A). Within HE food
subcategories, there was no significant HE food subcategory 3
treatment interaction for food appeal ratings [F(2, 16) = 2.49,
P = 0.099] (Figure 5B). However, independent of HE food sub-
category, HE foods were rated significantly less appealing when
patients received IPE than when they received the control [F(1,
16) = 4.69, P = 0.046] (Figure 5B). By contrast, there was no
difference in appeal ratings of object pictures between treat-
ments when including visit order as a covariate [F(1, 16) = 0.02,
P = 0.88].
There was no significant ED 3 treatment interaction for the
reaction time for subjects to rate the food pictures [F(1, 16) =
0.24, P = 0.63] (Figure 5C). However, independent of ED of
food pictures, IPE treatment significantly increased the reaction
time to food pictures [F(1, 16) = 13.82, P = 0.002] (Figure 5C).
Within HE food subcategories, there was no significant HE food
subcategory 3 treatment interaction for reaction time to food
pictures [F(2, 16) = 1.57, P = 0.22] (Figure 5D). However, in-
dependent of HE food subcategory, the reaction time for HE
food pictures was significantly increased after subjects received
IPE [F(1, 16) = 14.54, P = 0.002] (Figure 5D). By contrast, there
was no difference in reaction times for subjects to rate object
pictures between treatments when including visit order as a co-
variate [F(1, 16) = 2.40] (P = 0.14).
Blood hormones and metabolites
There was no significant difference in the AUC0–360 min for
plasma PYY, GLP-1, or glucose or serum insulin after subjects

 received IPE compared with control inulin (Supplemental
Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 2). Furthermore, 2-factor
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no time 3 treatment in-
teractions for plasma PYY, GLP-1, or glucose or serum insulin
(P = 0.25–0.58).
Serum SCFAs
Compared with baseline, there was no significant increase in
serum acetate or propionate concentrations 240 min after subjects
received IPE or control inulin (Table 2). For serum butyrate,
there was a significant increase in concentrations 240 min after
subjects received both IPE and control inulin compared with
baseline. There was no difference in SCFA concentrations be-
tween treatments at baseline (P = 0.25–0.87) or at 240 min (P =
0.10–0.88).
Confounding variables
There was no significant effect of IPE treatment on composite
appetite visual analog scale ratings (Supplemental Figure 5).
There were no significant differences between treatment visits in
potential confounding variables that may have affected the
BOLD signal or hedonic response to food pictures, including in
BMI, percentage body fat, mood, total energy intake on the
previous day, ratings of nausea, sleepiness, stress or anxiety, or
head motion during the fMRI task (Supplemental Table 3).
Correlations between outcome measures
As expected, the change in energy intake between treatments
was positively correlated with the change in composite appetite
visual analog scale ratings between treatments (Supplemental

elevated colonic propionate on the BOLD signal to HE food in
the caudate or nucleus accumbens, or in the mean of both re-
gions, and the effect of increased colonic propionate on HE food
appeal, or in composite appetite visual analog scale ratings
(Supplemental Table 4).
DISCUSSION
We used an established fMRI food evaluation paradigm to
assess the effects of elevated colonic propionate on brain re-
sponses during food picture evaluation in a priori regions of
interest previously associated with reward processing and

 hedonic eating behavior. An acute increase in colonic propionate
reduced the BOLD signal during an evaluation of food pictures in
the caudate (dorsal striatum) and nucleus accumbens (ventral
striatum) in nonobese men, which was greater for HE than for LE
foods. Indeed, in the caudate, elevated colonic propionate spe-
cifically reduced the BOLD signal during evaluation of HE but
not LE food pictures. Increased colonic propionate production
also reduced the appeal of HE food pictures and prolonged the
time taken to rate their appeal, an implicit measure that suggested
reduced wanting (17, 27). Furthermore, this reduced activation in
striatal brain reward systems was accompanied by a reduction in
ad libitum energy intake. This is the first time, to our knowledge,
that an acute increase in colonic propionate or any other SCFA
has been shown to significantly reduce anticipatory food hedonic
responses and associated BOLD signal changes in brain regions
associated with reward processing in humans.
Changes in striatal the BOLD signal to food cues previously
have been associated with physiologically relevant alterations in
food reward processing and eating behavior (3, 28–30). In the
satiated fed compared with fasted state, there is a reduction in
the ventral striatum BOLD signal during evaluation of HE
compared with LE food pictures, and a preferential reduction in
the appeal of HE foods, when an fMRI paradigm identical to
that of the current study is used (3). The reduced ventral striatum
BOLD signal to HE food pictures in the fed compared with
fasted state has also been correlated with a subsequent reduction
in ad libitum energy intake (28). Similarly, satiation decreases
BOLD responses to food taste in the nucleus accumbens (31),
whereas duration of food deprivation correlates with a greater
caudate BOLD signal in response to actual and anticipated re-
ceipt of palatable food (29). Satiation also decreases regional
cerebral blood flow at rest, another marker of neuronal activity,
in the caudate and nucleus accumbens (32). Greater activation in
the nucleus accumbens to food pictures is predictive of future
snack consumption and reduced weight loss success in an obe-
sity lifestyle intervention (30, 33). Alterations in caudate acti-
vation to actual or anticipated receipt of HE palatable food have
been linked to genetic variations in the dopamine receptor D2
(DRD2) gene, which is highly expressed in the striatum and
linked to increased BMI, familial risk of obesity, and prospective

PROPIONATE AND STRIATAL FOOD REWARD RESPONSES

 weight gain (34–36). In addition, after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(RYGB) surgery, obese patients have lower activation in the
caudate and nucleus accumbens when HE foods are evaluated,
and have lower HE food appeal than patients after gastric banding
surgery (18). Acute suppression of plasma PYY and GLP-1 in
patients after RYGB surgery increases food reward responses in
the nucleus accumbens (19). RYGB has been associated with
increased colonic propionate production in animal models (37).
This evidence supports a role of the striatum in altered reward
processing and food consumption patterns. It suggests that in-
creased colonic propionate may modulate the engagement of this
brain-reward circuit, resulting in a reduction in energy intake,
although we could not demonstrate a direct correlation between
changes in the BOLD signal and energy intake in our study.
Previous research in animal models supports the role of NDCs
and SCFAs in central appetite regulation. RS supplementation
reduces activity in hypothalamic appetite regulation centers as
assessed by manganese-enhanced MRI and stimulates anorexi-
genic hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin expression in rodents
(5, 6). Acetate itself suppresses appetite via central hypothalamic
mechanisms (7) and also has been shown to have other central
effects (38). By contrast, no known studies have investigated the
effect of SCFAs on central appetite regulation in humans. We did
not find any significant effect of elevated colonic propionate on
the hypothalamic BOLD signal during food picture evaluation in
the current study. However, BOLD imaging in the hypothalamus
has poor reliability related to its small-size, partial-volume effects
because of close proximity to the third ventricle and cerebro-
spinal fluid spaces, and artifact from the internal carotid artery.
Furthermore, an interpretation of changes in the overall BOLD
signal in the hypothalamus may be complicated by the multiple
smaller hypothalamic nuclei containing both orexigenic and
anorexigenic feeding neurons.
One of the major limitations of NDC supplementation is that
large doses are needed to observe effects that are in line with
those noted in animal studies. For example, our research group
previously has shown that .35 g NDC/d is needed to suppress
appetite and stimulate an increase in plasma PYY concentrations
(39). However, the development of IPE uniquely allows for the
targeted delivery of a known amount of propionate directly to
the colon, which normally only would be obtained from a high-
fiber diet, without the associated gastrointestinal side effects
(e.g., abdominal bloating or flatulence). We have previously
shown with the use of a 13C-labeled variant of IPE that .80% of
the bound propionate is released coincident with breath hydro-
gen. This suggests delivery of the majority of bound propionate
to the colon (12). We estimate that a 10-g dose of IPE delivers
2.36 g propionate to the colon, which is 2.5 times habitual daily
propionate production. In the current study, the breath hydrogen
data suggests significant fermentation by 210 min and at the
time of the MRI session. Despite this, we were unable to detect
any difference in serum propionate between treatments. Our
current measurement may have lacked sensitivity to record
minor increases in peripheral circulatory propionate, particularly
when measured at a single postprandial time point. This is un-
surprising, because .95% propionate present in the portal vein
is extracted by the liver, resulting in only a minor fraction
reaching the peripheral circulation (40). Nevertheless, we have
previously demonstrated a significant increase in propionate 13C
enrichment in the peripheral circulation, revealing that the
bound propionate from IPE is absorbed from the gut and is
available systemically (12). The significant increase in butyrate
observed after both treatments could be explained by the inter-
conversion of acetate to butyrate from microbial fermentation of
inulin (41). However, it is unclear why this would be reflected in
serum butyrate when splanchnic extraction has been shown to
balance gut butyrate production (42).
In addition to reduced striatal responses to food pictures, we
observed a 9.5% reduction in energy intake after subjects re-
ceived IPE, in line with previous observations (12). However,
there was no difference in plasma PYY and GLP-1 concen-
trations between treatments, a finding that is not in line with our
original hypothesis. It previously has been demonstrated that
an increased intake of NDCs and colonic SCFA production
can improve body composition and reduce energy intake in-
dependent of changes in peripheral gut hormone concentrations
in mice (6, 7, 43). This suggests that alternative mechanisms are
responsible for the appetite-regulating effects associated with
the consumption of NDCs and SCFAs, and for the changes in the
striatal BOLD signal and food appeal during food picture
evaluation in the current study. Propionate is a gluconeogenic
precursor, both at the gut epithelium and liver, and ruminant
studies consistently have demonstrated that an elevated portal
concentration of propionate depresses energy intake, which
is abolished with hepatic vagotomy or total hepatic innerva-
tion (44, 45). However, we did not identify any difference in
blood glucose or insulin concentrations between treatments, in
agreement with previous reports (12). Other possible mechanisms
driving our observations may be via the induction of vagal
signaling in the gut or portal vein through stimulation of free fatty
acid receptor 3 (46–48). Further work is needed to gain a better
understanding of the gut–liver–brain signaling pathways in re-
sponse to increased colonic propionate. This would provide in-
formation about whether our observations are a direct effect of
propionate on neural pathways or a secondary response mech-
anism to propionate metabolism.
We believe the major strengths of our study are the following: 1)
the use of fMRI, a well-validated noninvasive measure of human
brain activity; 2) the incorporation of a well-established food
evaluation paradigm that is sensitive to peripheral signals
influencing appetite and reward-based eating behavior, such as
gut hormones and after bariatric surgery (17–19); 3) the exclu-
sion of nonspecific effects on the BOLD signal with the use of
a control fMRI task; and 4) the within-subject crossover design.
A limitation of our study is the lack of energy intake data for 5
subjects, which may have reduced the ability to detect correla-
tions between outcome measures. Another limitation was the
inclusion of only a nonobese male cohort. The findings will need
confirmation in an obese cohort and in women, who may have
altered reward and emotional responses to food. The effect of
long-term IPE supplementation on striatal reward responses also
remains to be elucidated.
In conclusion, elevated colonic propionate significantly re-
duced the striatal BOLD signal during evaluation of HE foods,
reduced HE food picture appeal, and reduced energy intake at an
ad libitum meal in nonobese men, an effect that was independent
of changes in plasma PYY, GLP-1, and glucose and serum in-
sulin. These results suggest that colonic propionate may play an
important role in human appetitive and reward-based eating
behavior at least in part through brain striatal pathways.
