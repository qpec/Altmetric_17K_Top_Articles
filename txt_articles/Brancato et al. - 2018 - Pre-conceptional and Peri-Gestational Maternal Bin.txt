Although binge drinking is on the rise in women of reproductive age and during
pregnancy, the consequences in the offspring, in particular the inheritance of
alcohol-related mood disturbances and alcohol abuse vulnerability, are still poorly
investigated. In this study, we modeled both Habitual- and Binge Alcohol Drinking
(HAD and BAD) in female rats by employing a two-bottle choice paradigm, with 20%
alcohol and water. The exposure started 12 weeks before pregnancy and continued
during gestation and lactation. The consequences induced by the two alcohol drinking
patterns in female rats were assessed before conception in terms of behavioral
reactivity, anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Afterwards, from adolescence to
young-adulthood, male offspring was assessed for behavioral phenotype and alcohol
abuse vulnerability. At pre-conceptional time BAD female rats showed higher mean
alcohol intake and preference than HAD group; differences in drinking trajectories were
attenuated during pregnancy and lactation. Pre-conceptional BAD induced a prevalent
depressive/anhedonic-like behavior in female rats, rather than an increase in anxiety-like
behavior, as observed in HAD rats. In the adolescent offspring, peri-gestational BAD
did not affect behavioral reactivity in the open field and anxiety-like behavior in the
elevated plus maze. Rather, BAD dams offspring displayed higher despair-behavior and
lower social interaction with respect to control- and HAD dams progeny. Notably, only
binge drinking exposure increased offspring vulnerability to alcohol abuse and relapse
following forced abstinence. This is the first report showing that binge-like alcohol
consumption from pre-conceptional until weaning induces relevant consequences in
the affective phenotype of both the mothers and the offspring, and that such effects
include heightened alcohol abuse vulnerability in the offspring. These findings highlight
the need for more incisive public education campaigns about detrimental consequences
of peri-gestational alcohol exposure.

Inheritance of Alcohol-Related Vulnerability
INTRODUCTION
Despite the increased awareness about the teratogenic effect
of in utero exposure to psychotropic drugs [1–7], prenatal
alcohol exposure represents one of the most common early brain
insults [8–10]. Globally, about 10% of women consume alcohol
during pregnancy [11], between 5 and 10% admit binge drinking
incidents [12] and between 1 and 2% deliver a child with fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), whose lifelong consequences
can range from minor to severe disabilities [13]. Notably, binge
drinking (i.e., four to five or more drinks per occasion) prior
to pregnancy represents a relevant predictor of perinatal alcohol
exposure that might put the development of the offspring in
jeopardy [14].
Although several studies have investigated the clinical
consequences of alcohol abuse as well as the incidence of FASD,
very few is known about the impact of binge alcohol drinking
(BAD) on the affective and emotional pattern of females of
reproductive age [15].
This is an important issue since modifications in the affective
and emotional response of the mothers, as a consequence of long-
term alcohol intake, can be inherited by the progeny [16, 17].
Rodent models of alcohol exposure, which can mimic
both habitual- and binge human drinking patterns, allow
the investigation of the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie
dysfunctional emotional and affective behavior, as well as
heritable stress-related phenotypes [18–23]. In this regard,
well-established behavioral paradigms are essential tools to
search specific endophenotypes and provide cues to investigate
the neuropathology of mood disturbances. For instance, the
exploratory behavior of novel and challenging environments
such as the open field and the elevated plus maze, can
provide
a
reliable
readout
of
unconditioned
anxiety-like
behavior [24–26]; in addition, the animal unconditioned
preference
for
natural
rewards,
such
as
sweet
solution
[27] or social interaction toward a conspecific [28], can
be
altered
in
anhedonic-like
states,
such
as
depression;
lastly, despair behavior in the forced swim test is a largely
employed measure of depression-like behavior and has been
traditionally used to detect antidepressant properties of drugs
[29].
Thus, the first aim of this research was to model pre-
conceptional habitual- and binge-like alcohol consumption in
female rats, in order to investigate the consequences on their
emotional and affective behavior. We employed a long-term, two-
bottle choice paradigm with continuous or intermittent access
to 20% alcohol and water, and tested the animals for: drinking
trajectories, behavioral reactivity, reward sensitivity, anxiety- and
depression-like behavior.
It has been reported that mothers who drink before pregnancy
often indulge in alcohol consumption during pregnancy and
while breastfeeding, transferring alcohol to infants through the
maternal milk [30]. Thus, in the present study, female rats
continued habitual and binge-like alcohol self-administration
along pregnancy and lactation. Notably, the duration of pre- and
postnatal alcohol treatment allows to model human fetal alcohol
exposure along the whole gestational period, since the first two
postnatal weeks in rodents approximately correspond to the last
gestational trimester in humans [31, 32].
In spite of the well-established association between in utero
alcohol exposure and psychiatric risk in the progeny, experience
suggests that mental health practitioners infrequently identify
FASD before adolescence [33]. The Seattle longitudinal study
revealed that 21-year young adults whose mothers reported
a binge pattern of alcohol use, displayed significantly higher
overall levels of psychiatric symptoms, than those exposed to
low or moderate levels of alcohol in utero [34]. Adolescents’
most substantial deficits, according to the Vineland Adaptive
Behavior Scale [35] lied in the socialization domain, reflecting
both social anxiety and social avoidance. A similar prospective
study highlighted the association between maternal alcohol
use during pregnancy and offspring early drinking, suggesting
genetic inheritance of alcohol abuse behavior [36–38].
Based on this evidence, we investigated the occurrence of
specific variations in the affective and emotional phenotypes
of the offspring during adolescence, as a consequence of
the perinatal exposure to the two distinct alcohol drinking
paradigms. The offspring was tested for social interaction, which
explores social reward and embarrassment that may occur in
novel social environments [39, 40]. Eventually, the occurrence of
a vulnerability to alcohol abuse was investigated by exposing the
adolescent offspring to the two-bottle choice paradigm until early
adulthood.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the affective and
emotional consequences of long-term binge- alcohol drinking by
voluntary self-administration in female rats, and the inheritance
of mood disturbances and alcohol vulnerability in the adolescent
progeny.
This evidence strengthens the translational value of binge-like
alcohol self-administration by the two-bottle choice procedure,
in search of mechanisms of multigenerational inheritance of
alcohol detrimental consequences [41].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Housing Conditions
Adult female nulliparous Wistar rats (200–220 g, Harlan, Udine,
Italy) were housed individually in standard rat cages (40 ×
60 cm, 20 cm in height), with ad libitum access to water and
food, in a temperature- (22 ± 2◦C) and humidity- (55 ±
5%) controlled room, on 12 h inverted light/dark cycle (08:00–
20:00). Rats were gently handled for 3 min per day for a week
before the experimental procedures, when they were randomly
assigned to one of the three experimental groups, according to the
self-administration paradigm: habitual alcohol drinking (HAD),
BAD, water drinking controls (CTR).
At the end of the behavioral assessments, each female rat was
housed with a breeder male rat.
On gestational day 1 (GD1; i.e., the day when pregnancy
was confirmed) eight female rats randomly selected from
each experimental group and housed in standard maternity
cages, filled with wood shavings. Alcohol consumption was
not measured when the male rat was present in the cage
[42]. Female rats underwent the self-administration procedure

Inheritance of Alcohol-Related Vulnerability
throughout pregnancy, accordingly to the respective two-bottle
choice paradigm. Dams were inspected twice daily for delivery
until the day of parturition, considered as postnatal day 0 (PND
0); dams and litters were kept in a nursery (24 ± 2◦C) and not
separated until weaning, in order to avoid confounding effects
due to cross-fostering procedure [43–45] and model the human
condition.
One male rat from each alcohol drinking- and control
litter was randomly chosen to undergo behavioral testing,
beginning on PND 23, so that experimental groups of rat
offspring were: perinatally habitual alcohol-exposed rats (p-HAD,
n = 8), perinatally binge alcohol-exposed rats (p-BAD, n = 8),
perinatally water-exposed controls (p-CTR, n = 8).
All the experiments were approved by the Committee for the
Protection and Use of Animals of the University of Palermo,
in accordance with the current Italian legislation on animal
experimentation (D.L. 116/92) and the European directives
(2010/63/EU).
Two-Bottle “20% Alcohol vs. Water”
Choice Drinking Paradigms
Female rats underwent home cage two-bottle “alcohol vs. water”
choice regimen, according to the experimental group assigned.
Indeed, HAD rats were given 24 h free choice between one bottle
of alcohol (20% v/v) and one of tap water, 7 days per week,
except during the behavioral tests (weeks 8–11) when they were
given 5 drinking sessions per week; BAD rats were given 24 h
alcohol (20% v/v) access during 3 sessions per week, i.e., on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, while they received 2 bottles of
tap water on the intervening days. CTR rats received two bottles
of water. Overall, HAD rats underwent 76 pre-conceptional-, 21
gestational, and 21 post-gestational drinking sessions. On the
other hand, BAD rats had 36 pre-conceptional-, 9 gestational, and
9 post-gestational drinking sessions.
Alcoholic solution (20% v/v) was daily prepared by diluting
alcohol 96◦ (Carlo Erba Reagenti, Italy) with tap water.
Plastic bottles (120 ml; metal cap 0.8 mm diameter hole,
Tecniplast, Italy) were filled every day with 100 ml of freshly
prepared solution, in alternative left-right position, to avoid side
preference, and presented at lights off. Alcohol- and water intake
were measured 1 h after lights off and the day after, immediately
before lights-off, by weighing the bottles. Possible, fluid spillage
was monitored by using multiple bottles filled with water and
alcohol 20%, allocated in empty cages interspersed in the racks
[46]. During the paradigm, rats were daily monitored for body
weight. For each drinking session, alcohol consumption (g/kg)
and preference % over total fluid consumption were measured.
Mean alcohol consumption, at 24 and at 1 h after alcohol
presentation, was then calculated considering the total number
of drinking sessions in each group during pre-conceptional time,
gestation, and lactation.
Behavioral Procedures
Starting from week 8 of the two-bottle choice paradigm, female
rats underwent a battery of behavioral assessments that started
following 12 h of acute abstinence, during the weekend, and
included open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim tests
(Figure 1). Saccharin preference was employed to as a measure
of sensitivity to natural rewards, rather the social interaction test,
in order to avoid confounding effects due to altered behavioral
reactivity as a result of alcohol abstinence.
Male offspring were tested in the open field, elevated plus
maze, social interaction, and forced swim test starting from PND
23. Afterwards, they were also tested for alcohol vulnerability,
starting from PND 32.
On the test days, the animals were acclimatized for 60 min
before the experimental session. The experiments were carried
out in a soundproof room between 9:00 and 14:00. Animal
performance was recorded and monitored in an adjacent room.
The equipment was thoroughly cleaned before animal’s entry to
ensure that rat’s behavior was not affected by the detection of
another rat’s scent.
Open Field Test
Behavioral reactivity in a novel open field arena was measured
in a Plexiglas square box (44 cm long, 44 cm wide, and 20 cm
high) by employing an automatic video-tracking system (Any
Maze, Ugo Basile, Italy), in a mean light (100 lx) illuminated
chamber. Each experimental session lasted 5 min [25]. The test
produces a qualitative mapping of the motor pattern, measuring
total distance traveled (TDT), as a measure of locomotor activity,
number of transitions (NTC) from peripheral to central squares

of the arena, and amount of time spent on the central areas (ATC)
as measures of explorative behavior.
Elevated Plus Maze Test
Unconditioned anxiety-like behavior was assessed in the elevated
plus maze (EPM). EPM apparatus consisted of a plus-shaped
platform from dark-gray PVC elevated to a height of 70 cm above
the floor. Two of the opposing arms (50 × 10 cm) were closed
by 40 cm-high side end-walls (closed arms), whereas the two
other arms had no walls (open arms). The arms were oriented
perpendicular to each other and connected by an open central
area (10 × 10 cm). At the beginning of each session, rats were
placed in the center of the maze facing one of the open arms.
Time spent on each arm and number of entries were recorded
by using ANY MAZE Video Tracking System (Ugo Basile, Italy)
along the 5 min test duration. An entry was scored when all
the four paws entered into each single arm. The percentage
of time spent on the open arms/total time spent on open and
closed arms, and of number of entries in the open arms/number
of entries in the open and closed arms were analyzed, as they
constituted the primary indices of trait anxiety-like behavior
in rodents. Information on general activity was obtained by
measuring closed arm and total entries [26].
Saccharin Preference Test
Anhedonia was assessed using the saccharin preference test [27].
Briefly, during the habituation phase, each cage was supplied
with two drinking bottles filled with water to avoid place
preference. On the next day, a bottle of water was replaced by one
containing 0.2% (w/v) saccharin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy).
Saccharin- and water intake were measured by weighing the
bottles 24 h later. The location of the two bottles was randomly
alternated to avoid location preference bias. Saccharin preference
was calculated as percentage of the volume of the saccharin
solution consumed divided by the total fluid volume (water plus
saccharin).
Forced Swim Test
Porsolt test was conducted as already described in Plescia
et al. [47]. Briefly, each rat was placed individually in a glass
cylinder (40 cm high, 18 cm inside diameter) containing ≈5 l
of clean water. Water temperature was maintained at 22–23◦C.
Rats were forced to swim for 15 min (pre-test). Animals were
then allowed to return to their home cages. On the next day,
each rat was placed into the water and forced to swim for
5 min (test). The session was videotaped and the duration of
immobility, swimming and climbing was recorded (sec). The
rat was considered as immobile when it stopped struggling and
remained floating in the water, keeping its head above the water.
Climbing was defined by active attempts to climb the walls of the
cylinder to escape.
Social Interaction Test
Social reward was measured by the social interaction test, adapted
from Christoffel et al. [48]. The offspring was placed into a novel
arena equipped with a small animal cage (10 × 10 cm) at one
end. Rat movements were monitored for 5 min in the absence
of a social stimulus into the cage (used to determine baseline
exploratory behavior), followed by 5 min in the presence of a
caged conspecific male rat, matched for age. Partners had not
been socially isolated prior to testing and were unfamiliar with
both the apparatus and the experimental animal with which they
were paired for testing. We measured duration of time spent
in the interaction zone, including 2 cm2 surrounding the small
animal cage, by using Anymaze software (Ugo Basile, Italy).
Social interaction was calculated as a ratio between the time spent
on the interaction zone when the stimulus rat was present, over
the time spent when the stimulus rat was absent.
Alcohol Vulnerability in the Offspring
Male offspring underwent home cage two-bottle “alcohol vs.
water” choice regimen, and were given 24 h free choice between
one bottle of alcohol (10% v/v) and one of tap water, 7 days
per week, for 4 weeks, followed by a relapse-like week, after
deprivation. Alcoholic solution (10% v/v) was daily prepared
by diluting alcohol 96◦ (Carlo Erba Reagenti, Italy) with
tap water. Plastic bottles (120 ml; metal cap 0.8 mm diameter
hole, Tecniplast, Italy) were refilled with 100 ml fresh solution
every day, and presented at lights off in alternative left-right
position, to avoid side preference. Alcohol- and water intake
were measured by weighing the bottles. Possible fluid spillage
was monitored by using multiple bottles filled with water and
alcohol 10%, positioned in empty cages interspersed in the cage
racks. During the paradigm, rats were daily monitored for body
weight.
Statistical Analysis
The analysis included results from rat dams whose pups were
assessed along different phases of the experimental design.
The differences in mean alcohol consumption and preference
of female rats were analyzed by Student’s t-test or Mann–
Whitney test, when appropriate. The analysis of drinking
trajectories of female rats, starting from the last 3 weeks of
pre-conceptional time to the end of the drinking paradigm,
was performed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures
(RM 2-way ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test,
on both mean alcohol consumption per week, including
“alcohol drinking pattern” as the between-subject factor and
“week” as the within-subject factor, and mean weekly alcohol
consumption during pre-conceptional time, gestation and
lactation, including “alcohol drinking pattern” as the between-
subject factor and “period” as the repeated measure factor.
Data analysis on behavioral experiments was performed by one-
way ANOVA, including “treatment” as the between subjects
factor. Data analysis on alcohol vulnerability experiments
was performed by RM 2-way ANOVA, including “maternal
alcohol drinking pattern” as the between-subject factor and
“week” as the within-subject factor. Bonferroni post-hoc test
was employed, when necessary. Kruskal–Wallis test, followed
by Dunn’s multiple comparison test, was employed for the
analysis of alcohol deprivation effect. Data are reported as
mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05
(α = 0.05).

RESULTS
Pre-conceptional and Peri-Gestational
Alcohol Drinking Patterns in Female Rats
Female
rats
had
habitual—continuous—or
binge—
intermittent—access
to
the
“two-bottle
choice”
paradigm
during 12 weeks, before mating, during pregnancy and lactation.
Fluid spillage, constantly monitored by using multiple bottles
filled with water and alcohol 20%, allocated in empty cages
interspersed in the racks, was neither relevant nor systematic.
Measures of alcohol intake along the paradigm are reported
in Table 1. As expected pre-conceptional time BAD paradigm
induced higher means alcohol consumption and preference,
at both time points considered, 1 and 24 h after alcohol
presentation, with respect to HAD. After fecundation, as well
as during post-partum days, BAD rats increase in mean alcohol
consumption and preference was attenuated with respect to
HAD rats.
In order to have a more detailed insight into drinking
trajectories, mean alcohol intake of HAD and BAD rats, from
the last three pre-conceptional weeks throughout peri-gestational
time was analyzed. The RM 2-way ANOVA on mean alcohol
consumption during the 9 weeks considered showed a significant
effect of alcohol drinking pattern [F(1, 14) = 71.07, p < 0.0001],
weeks [F(8, 112) = 7.465, p < 0.0001], and their interaction
[F(8, 112) = 3.453, p = 0.0014]. In particular, BAD rats displayed
increased alcohol consumption with respect to HAD rats on
week 10, 11, and 12 of pre-conceptional period (t = 6.091,
p < 0.001; t = 4.099, p = 0.0007; t = 5.354, p < 0.001);
during gestational week 3 (t = 2.877, p = 0.0424) and post-
gestational weeks 1 and 3 (t = 3.015, p = 0.0279; t = 4.788,
p < 0.001).
Moreover, when we analyzed the effects of the three periods
considered, the RM 2-way ANOVA showed a significant effect
of period [F(2, 4) = 51.53, p = 0.0014], alcohol drinking pattern
[F(1, 2) = 45.05, p = 0.0215], and their interaction [F(2, 4) = 21.33,
p = 0.0073]. After fecundation, BAD rats decreased their
alcohol consumption with respect to their pre-conceptional levels
(t = 9.70, p = 0.0020). During post-partum days, the drinking
trajectories of both groups increased with respect to gestational
period (HAD: t = 4.688, p = 0.0282; BAD: t = 9.715, p = 0.0019),
and reproduced a similar pattern as on pre-conceptional time
(Figure 2).
Behavioral Assessment in Female Rats
Open Field Test
At the end of week 8, female rats’ performance in the open
field was assessed as a measure of locomotor activity and
behavioral
reactivity
in
a
novel
environment,
following
12 h alcohol deprivation. Results from a one-way ANOVA
showed
no
significant
differences
in
locomotor
activity,
in terms of TDT, among the three experimental groups
[F(2, 21) = 0.1032, p = 0.9024; Figure 3A]. Statistical analysis
indicated significant differences in NTC [F(2, 21) = 3.895,
p = 0.0364], and ATC [F(2, 21) = 4.516, p = 0.0234]. In
particular, Bonferroni post-hoc test highlighted a significant
decrease in both NTC (t = 2.721, p < 0.05) and ATC
(t =
3.005, p < 0.05) in HAD- with respect to CTR rats
(Figures 3B,C).
Elevated Plus Maze Test
At the end of week 9, female rats were tested in the EPM
to evaluate anxiety-like behavior at 12 h alcohol deprivation.
One-way ANOVA, performed on data from the percentage
of time spent on open arm/time on open and closed arms,
showed significant differences among the experimental groups
[F(2, 21) = 14.42, p = 0.0001]. In particular, Bonferroni post-
hoc test indicated a significant lower preference for the open
arms in HAD rats, compared to CTR (t = 3.959, p < 0.01),
while BAD rats spent more time in the open arms than HAD
group (t = 5.121, p < 0.001; Figure 3D). When the percentage
of open arm entries out of total entries was analyzed, one-
way ANOVA showed significant differences among the three
experimental groups [F(2, 21) = 26.13, p < 0.0001]. In particular,
Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed a significant decrease in
HAD rats, with respect to CTR (t = 5.604, p < 0.001), and an
increase in BAD-, with respect to HAD rats (t = 6.758, p <
0.001; Figure 3E). No significant differences among the three
experimental groups in number of total entries were observed
[F(2, 21) = 2.579, p = 0.0997; Figure 3F).
Saccharin Preference Test
At the end of week 10, female rats underwent 12 h of alcohol
deprivation and were subjected to saccharin preference test,
in order to evaluate their response to a natural reward
during abstinence. Results from one-way ANOVA showed
significant differences among the three experimental groups

Inheritance of Alcohol-Related Vulnerability
FIGURE 2 | Female rat alcohol drinking trajectories. Binge alcohol drinking (BAD) rats showed higher alcohol consumption than habitual alcohol drinking (HAD) rats
during the last three pre-conceptional weeks, gestation and post-gestation. During gestation, BAD rats displayed a significant decrease in alcohol consumption with
respect to the last three pre-gestational weeks. During post-partum days, drinking consumption of both groups increased with respect to gestational period,
reproducing similar trajectories as recorded on pre-conceptional time. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of n = 8 rats. ∧p < 0.05, ∧∧∧p < 0.001 vs. HAD rats; ◦p
< 0.05 within HAD group; •••p < 0.001 within BAD group.
[F(2, 21) = 581.0, p < 0.001]. In details, Bonferroni post-hoc test
highlighted a significant decrease in saccharin preference in both
HAD-(t = 7.961, p < 0.001) and BAD rats (t = 32.71, p < 0.001),
with respect to CTR. Moreover, BAD rats displayed a significant
decrease in saccharin preference when compared to HAD rats
(t = 24.74, p < 0.001; Figure 3G).
Forced Swim Test
The experimental groups were evaluated for depressive-like
behavior in the Porsolt test at the end of week 11. After 12 h
of alcohol abstinence, rats were exposed to the pretest and,
at 36 h abstinence, rats underwent the 5-min Test session,
when immobility, swimming, and climbing time were recorded.
One-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment on
immobility [F(2, 21) = 30.92, p < 0.0001]. Bonferroni post-hoc
test highlighted a significant increase both in HAD (t = 6.441,
p < 0.001) and in BAD rats (t = 7.127, p < 0.001) with
respect to CTR. In line with these results, a significant effect
of treatment was observed on swimming time [F(2, 21) = 15.36,
p < 0.001], with a significant decrease in both HAD- (t = 4.375,
p < 0.001) and BAD-rats (t = 4.019, p < 0.01), when compared
to controls. Furthermore, when the parameter climbing was
analyzed, significant differences were observed among groups
[F(2, 21) = 10.87, p = 0.0006]: HAD rats displayed a significant
increase in climbing with respect to CTR (t = 4.491, p < 0.001),
and BAD-rats (t = 3.331, p < 0.01). Figure 3H shows the
composite behavioral pattern of the three experimental groups.
Behavioral Assessment in the Offspring
Open Field Test
Offspring’s performance in the open field was assessed as a
measure of locomotor activity and behavioral reactivity in
a novel environment. One-way ANOVA showed significant
effects of maternal alcohol drinking pattern on locomotor
activity, in terms of TDT, among the three experimental groups
[F(2, 21) = 4.915, p = 0.0177]; indeed, p-HAD offspring showed
decreased locomotor activity, with respect to both p-CTR
(t = 2.776, p < 0.05) and p-BAD offspring (t = 2.65, p <
0.05; Figure 4A). Moreover, significant differences in NTC were
observed [F(2, 21) = 14.8, p < 0.001], with a decrease in p-HAD
when compared to p-CTR (t = 5.396, p < 0.001) and p-BAD
offspring (t = 3.293, p < 0.05).
Analysis of ATC data also showed significant differences
[F(2, 21) = 5.441, p = 0.0125]. In particular, Bonferroni post-hoc
test highlighted a significant decrease in p-HAD offspring with
respect to p-CTR rats (t = 3.155, p < 0.05; Figures 4B,C).
Elevated Plus Maze Test
Animals were tested in the EPM to evaluate anxiety-like behavior.
One-way ANOVA, performed on data from the percentage
of time spent on open arm/time on open and closed arms,
showed significant differences among the experimental groups
[F(2, 21) = 16.05, p < 0.0001]. In particular, Bonferroni post-
hoc test indicated a significant lower preference for the open
arms in p-HAD offspring, compared to p-CTR (t = 4.466, p <
0.001), while p-BAD offspring spent more time in the open arms
than p-HAD ones (t = 5.253, p < 0.001; Figure 4D). When the
percentage of open arm entries out of total entries was analyzed,
one-way ANOVA showed significant differences among the three
experimental groups [F(2, 21) = 6.559, p = 0.0061]. In particular,
Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed a significant decrease in
p-HAD offspring, with respect to p-CTR (t = 3.284, p < 0.05),
and an increase in p-BAD, with respect to p-HAD offspring
(t = 2.965, p < 0.05; Figure 4E). No significant differences among
the three experimental groups in number of total entries were
observed [F(2, 21) = 0.6072, p = 0.5542; Figure 4F].

In agreement with these results, a significant effect of

Inheritance of Alcohol-Related Vulnerability
Alcohol Vulnerability
Offspring had access to the “two-bottle choice” paradigm from
PND 32 for 4 weeks, followed by a relapse-like week, after
deprivation in order to test them for alcohol deprivation effect.
RM 2-way ANOVA on mean alcohol intake (g/kg) along the
first 4 weeks of the paradigm showed a significant effect of
maternal alcohol drinking pattern [F(2, 21) = 36.73, p < 0.0001],
weeks [F(3,63) = 4.856, p = 0.0042], and their interaction
[F(6,63) = 3.825, p = 0.0026]. In particular, offspring from
BAD dams showed higher alcohol intake with respect to p-CTR
on week 1, 3, and 4 (t = 4.091, p = 0.0003; t = 6.164,
p < 0.0001; t = 7.548, p < 0.0001), and with respect to
p-HAD offspring on week 1 and 4 (t = 3.325, p =
0.0039;
t = 4.192, p = 0.0002). Moreover, p-HAD offspring showed
increased alcohol intake with respect to p-CTR rats on week
3 and 4 (t = 4.096, p = 0.0003; t = 3.356, p = 0.0036).
When alcohol deprivation effect was measured as mean alcohol
intake (g/kg) during the relapse-like time window, following
a week of alcohol abstinence, Kruskal–Wallis test showed a
significant effect of maternal alcohol drinking pattern (p <
0.001). In details, Dunn’s multiple comparison test showed an
increase in alcohol consumption in p-BAD- when compared
with p-HAD-offspring (p < 0.01) and p-CTR ones (p = 0.0295;
Figure 4I).
DISCUSSION
The present study aimed at evaluating the consequences of pre-
conceptional long-term binge-like alcohol self-administration
on different behavioral dimensions in female rats; moreover,
we prolonged alcohol exposure during pregnancy and lactation
in order to evaluate the occurrence of relevant effects on
adolescent male offspring’s phenotype, including the inheritance
of alcohol abuse. Our results show that the experimental
model of BAD provides a robust opportunity to explore the
discrete consequences of this worldwide spread, excessive alcohol
drinking habit, and highlight the occurrence of the inheritance of
mood- and reward-related disturbances in the offspring.
Indeed, we modeled binge drinking in female rats by using a
two-bottle choice paradigm with water and intermittent access
to 20% alcohol, over 12 weeks. In order to explore discrete
pattern-related effects, a continuous/habitual alcohol-drinking
group was included, as positive control. In accordance with
previous reports in both male and female rats [21, 46, 49–
51], the intermittent access to alcohol reliably models excessive
binge-like alcohol consumption. Indeed, BAD rats showed a
significantly higher alcohol intake than HAD rats [52]: within the
first hour of alcohol access they drank intoxicating amounts of
alcohol [46], in accordance with the definition of binge drinking
[53]. The “limited-access” model appropriately recreates the
binging patterns observed in some human alcoholics [53–55]
and, importantly, the voluntary self-administration prevents rats
from undergoing stressful procedures that may contribute to the
alteration of the subsequent behavioral outcomes. Indeed, once
rats acquired a steady drinking behavior, a characterization of the
affective phenotype was carried out on alcohol deprivation days.
Our data show that alcohol-drinking pattern is a determiner
in the discrete modifications of the emotional and affective
homeostasis in female rats here observed. Indeed, whether
in the open field both HAD- and BAD female rats did not
differ from CTR in terms of locomotor activity, HAD rats
showed a significant avoidance of the central zone of the arena,
while BAD rats did not differ from controls. This finding was
confirmed by the results of the elevated-plus maze, where only
HAD rats displayed increased anxiety-like behavior. Notably, the
intermittent pattern of alcohol consumption is not associated to
overt typical signs of alcohol withdrawal: mainly, rats trained
in the intermittent model display cognitive deficits rather than
increased anxiety-like behavior during acute abstinence [56, 57].
However, no significant differences appeared in the number of
total arm entries, ruling out any impairment in locomotor activity
[58].
To further analyze the consequences of binge-like alcohol
consumption, anhedonia, and depression-like behavior were
assessed. Anhedonia, i.e., the decreased experience of pleasure in
response to nondrug reward [59], is a key symptom of depressive
disorders, commonly described in subjects who are long-term
abstinent from drugs of abuse: the development of a negative
effect, such as anhedonia associated to dysphoria, is a relevant
vulnerability factor for relapse (DSM-V, [60, 61]). In the saccharin
preference test we evaluated animals’ preference between regular
water and a sweet solution, which represents a highly rewarding
natural stimulus for rodents. Interestingly, whether habitual
alcohol exposure induced a lower preference for the natural
reward with respect to CTR, the most anhedonic response was
observed in BAD rats which showed significant lower preference
for saccharin than HAD rats. The reduction in the affective tone
was confirmed by the results of the forced swim test, where BAD
rats showed longer immobility score, when compared both to
CTR and HAD rats, suggesting the occurrence of “despair-like
behavior” as a consequence of the binge-like drinking exposure.
On the other hand, HAD rats displayed a less defined picture, in
that they showed a lower immobility time with respect to BAD
rats and an increase in climbing, which suggests the expression
of lower behavioral despair [62].
Overall, binge-like alcohol drinking seems to be responsible
for a depressive-oriented phenotype, when animals are tested
on abstinence days, which includes anhedonia- and despair-,
whereas HAD rather induces an anxiety-oriented behavior. The
repeated cycles of alcohol exposure and withdrawal typical of
binge-like drinking may lead to enduring aberrant plasticity in
strategic brain circuitries that drive a transition from positive to
negative reinforcement-based alcohol seeking, and abstinence-
induced affective disturbances [57, 63–74]. Supplementary and
in depth evidence on the subject are available on seminal reviews
[75].

was
evidently modified and differences in drinking trajectories were
attenuated during pregnancy and lactation. This observation
is in agreement with data showing that in the general female
population the reproductive state is able to modulate alcohol
intake and preference [76]. In accordance with our previous
reports (51), during post-partum days, the drinking patterns

Inheritance of Alcohol-Related Vulnerability
reproduced similar trajectories as recorded on pre-conceptional
time. The following aim of this research was the investigation of
the consequences of perinatal alcohol exposure on the behavioral
phenotype of the offspring. Few studies have addressed the
multigenerational effects of maternal binge drinking; among
them, a recent research demonstrated that maternal binge
drinking induces a subtle range of cognitive defects, mainly
referred to working memory deficits, associated with persistent
neuroinflammation and myelin damage [77]. The present
research widens the extent of the detrimental consequences
of maternal binge drinking to the affective dimension: indeed,
maternal binge-like alcohol drinking resulted in the inheritance
of a depression-like phenotype in the offspring, when tested
in adolescence. In details, whereas p-HAD offspring showed
anxiety-like behavior in the open field and in the EPM, a dramatic
decrease in social reward sensitivity in the social interaction, and
a higher despair-like behavior in the FST characterized p-BAD
progeny as adolescents. As a matter of fact, p-HAD progeny
displayed the same alterations in coping with inescapable stress
as their mothers, and a higher social interaction ratio than
p-BAD offspring but lower than p-CTR.
Social interaction, which allows studying social attitudes in
the experimental model, is experienced as a rewarding event in
animals as in humans [78, 79]. In particular, whereas an age-
typical inhibition of social behavior occurs in adulthood [80],
social interactions are considered highly rewarding in young
mammals [28]. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that
the activation of the reward system mediates the processing of
social stimuli in a similar manner as nonsocial rewards and thus
motivates social behavior [81]. Early experiences, such as prenatal
alcohol exposure, may influence the ongoing development of
reward-related circuitries (reviewed in [82, 83]). The evidence
that the major disruption in social behavior occurred in BAD
progeny is not easy to explain. We can hypothesize that the
long-term binge-like alcohol drinking affects the physiological
response to natural rewarding stimuli in the mothers and that the
inheritance of such disturbance may alter future social behavior
in the offspring. In accordance, a longitudinal prospective study
showed that pre-gestational exposure to alcohol binge drinking
may be a risk factor for decreased social interaction, attention,
hyperactivity in childhood [84], and is associated with substance
dependence or abuse disorders vulnerability in early adulthood
[34]. Consistently, our data show, for the first time, a specific
vulnerability to alcohol abuse in the offspring of BAD dams.
Indeed, when all groups were exposed to the two-bottle choice
with alcohol solution and water, from adolescence to early
adulthood, p-BAD progeny displayed a relevant increase in
alcohol consumption compared to p-HAD- and CTR progeny
along the paradigm, which suggests a faster acceptance and
a higher preference for alcohol. Moreover, p-BAD progeny
displayed a significant increase in voluntary alcohol consumption
after a week of forced abstinence, resembling the so called
“alcohol deprivation effect” (ADE). This phenomenon is well-
established as a robust and reliable measure of the motivation to
seek and consume alcohol, loss of control, and relapse in rats [85].
The evidence of ADE only in p-BAD offspring is suggestive of
the occurrence of peculiar signs of vulnerability to alcohol abuse,
such as compulsive alcohol-seeking and reinstatement behavior.
Unfortunately, the time window for ADE assessment had to be
short in order to study the phenomenon from adolescence to
early adulthood. This allowed us to parallel clinical evidence
of equivalent 14–25 years human subjects, along the temporal
window when maturation of cortical and limbic regions is under
completion [86]. A longer exposure to the drinking procedure
and/or to the operant chamber will help to further investigate
the reward-related responses to alcohol of p-BAD progeny, in the
next future.
Overall, the idea that the progeny can epigenetically inherit
aberrant functions due to parental alcohol abuse is not a
novel issue. Recently, pre-conceptional alcohol intake has been
reported to negatively affect offspring adult health by increasing
stress hormone response to an immune challenge and altering the
expression and methylation profiles of stress regulatory genes in
various brain areas: this evidence suggests that pre-conceptional
alcohol intake may play a role in the inheritance of stress-related
diseases [87]. Moreover, clinical and epidemiological studies
indicate that pre-conceptional exposure to alcohol is not only
associated with the risk for alcohol abuse in adolescent and young
adult humans [88, 89], but is perhaps the best predictor of later
alcohol abuse [90, 91].
In conclusion, this study shows that pre-conceptional and
peri-gestational habitual and binge-like alcohol consumption
induce respectively an anxiety-like and a depression-like oriented
phenotype in the mothers, which can be accordingly inherited by
the adolescent male progeny. These preclinical findings prompt
the early detection of discrete psychopathological traits that
may represent predictive signs of alcohol vulnerability in the
adolescents, in order to carry out rescue strategies for at risk
endophenotypes [92–98]. The occurrence of similar inheritance
in the female progeny is still to be ascertained. Ultimately, our
findings highlight the need for more incisive public educational
campaigns that can educate women of childbearing age avoiding
binge—and continuous—alcohol drinking during pregnancy, in
order to increase their awareness on the severe consequences they
may expose their offspring, even at a later developmental epoch.
