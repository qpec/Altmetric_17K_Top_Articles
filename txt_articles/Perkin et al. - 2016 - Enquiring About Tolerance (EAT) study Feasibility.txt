Background: The influence of early exposure to allergenic foods
on the subsequent development of food allergy remains uncertain.
Objective: We sought to determine the feasibility of the early
introduction of multiple allergenic foods to exclusively breast-
fed infants from 3 months of age and the effect on breastfeeding
performance.
Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial. The early
introduction group (EIG) continued breastfeeding with
sequential introduction of 6 allergenic foods: cow’s milk, peanut,
hard-boiled hen’s egg, sesame, whitefish (cod), and wheat; the
standard introduction group followed the UK infant feeding
recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding for around 6 months
with no introduction of allergenic foods before 6 months of age.
Results: One thousand three hundred three infants were enrolled.
By 5 months of age, the median frequency of consumption of all 6
foods was 2 to 3 times per week for every food in the EIG and no
consumption for every food in the standard introduction group
(P <.001 for every comparison). By 6 months of age,
nonintroduction of the allergenic foods in the EIG was less than
5% for each of the 6 foods. Achievement of the stringent per-
protocol consumption target for the EIG proved more difficult
(42% of evaluable EIG participants). Breastfeeding rates in both
groups significantly exceeded UK government data for equivalent
mothers (P <.001 at 6 and at 9 months of age).
Conclusion: Early introduction, before 6 months of age, of at
least some amount of multiple allergenic foods appears
achievable and did not affect breastfeeding. This has important
implications for the evaluation of food allergy prevention
strategies. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2016;137:1477-86.)

The point prevalence of self-reported food allergy in a recent
systematic review was around 6%,1 and that for particular foods is
increasing.2 The role of allergen consumption in early infancy and
its effect on the development of allergy or tolerance to food
proteins remains uncertain.
The World Health Organization Global Strategy for Infant and
Young Child Feeding,3 which is endorsed by the United Kingdom
(UK) Government,4 recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the
first 6 months with nutritious complementary foods introduced
thereafter and continued breastfeeding up to the age of 2 years
or beyond.5 The UK Government infant feeding information
leaflet for parents, ‘‘Weaning—starting solid food,’’ adopts a
more pragmatic target of around 6 months of exclusive breast-
feeding.6 It also states that if a mother decides to introduce com-
plementary foods before 6 months of age, there are some foods
that should be avoided because they can cause allergies, including
‘‘wheat-based foods...eggs, fish, shellfish, nuts (and) seeds.’’
There is little evidence that this reduces allergic disease.7 Inter-
ventions involving maternal diet during pregnancy alone8 or preg-
nancy and lactation9 and alterations to the timing and type of solid
food introduction in infants10 have thus far not halted the increase
in food allergy. Furthermore, there is now observational evidence
that early introduction of cow’s milk,11 peanut,12 or egg13 during
infancy might prevent the development of food allergies.
In 2010, the UK government published the latest of its
quinquennial reviews of infant feeding practice in the country
(Infant Feeding Survey 2010 [IFS2010]).14 Although the UK
Government guidelines no longer stipulate delaying the introduc-
tion of allergenic foods beyond 6 months of age, the current
feeding regimen of UK mothers clearly does delay introduction.
At 8 to 10 months of age, only 8% of infants had been given
peanuts or peanut products.14
The significant trend toward later introduction of solid foods
and longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding in the UK has
coincided with the prevalence of food allergy appearing to

increase.15 Although delayed introduction of allergenic foods
prevents occurrence of an allergic reaction, there is no evidence
to suggest it prevents the development of allergies and might
simply delay the manifestation of a pre-existing allergy.
The Solids Timing for Allergy Research study suggested that
induction of immune tolerance pathways is possible through early
introduction of egg and resulted in a reduction, although a
nonsignificant one, in egg allergy incidence.16 The Learning
Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) study found that early
introduction of peanut into the diets of high-risk atopic infants
protects against the development of peanut allergy.17,18
The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study has a wider remit,
namely to test the hypothesis that the early introduction of
multiple allergenic foods from 3 months of age in an unselected
population of exclusively breastfed infants will, as a primary
outcome, reduce the prevalence of food allergy and, as a
secondary outcome, influence asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis,
and the prevalence of combined allergic disease by 3 years of age.
The
EAT
study
has
completed
enrollment
with
1303
participants. All participants are now beyond 2 years of age,
and this milestone affords the opportunity to present the study
methodology and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the
introduction regimen in this unique cohort.
METHODS
The EAT study is a population-based randomized controlled trial that
enrolled exclusively breastfed infants from England and Wales regardless of
atopic status or family history of allergy. Infants who had consumed anything
other than breast milk or water since birth, were part of multiple births, were
born prematurely, had any serious medical condition, or were participating in
other medical research were not eligible for enrollment. A current household
member with a food allergy was not an exclusion criterion.
Ethical approval for the EAT study was provided by St Thomas’ Hospital
REC (REC reference 08/H0802/93), and the study is registered with the
International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register
(14254740). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children
enrolled in the study, and safety data were regularly reviewed by the EAT
study’s independent data monitoring committee.
Families were recruited to the study from those who responded to a flyer
mailed to parents of young infants throughout England and Wales (Fig 1). The
6 allergenic foods selected to form the trial’s intervention, cow’s milk, peanut,
hen’s egg, sesame, whitefish (cod), and wheat, were chosen from the foods
most commonly found to be responsible for IgE-mediated food reactions in
children.19,20 The trial’s primary outcome is the prevalence of IgE-mediated
food allergy, which we aimed to confirm using double-blind, placebo-
controlled food challenge to 1 or more of the 6 intervention foods at between
1 and 3 years of age (see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.
jacionline.org). The trial is powered at 80% to detect a halving of food allergy
prevalence between the study groups. At study commencement, the expected
food allergy prevalence in the standard introduction group (SIG) was 6%. An
analysis undertaken after 3 months of recruitment indicated that the EAT
parental atopy rate was higher than that of a contemporary UK population-
based study.21 Data from the Early Prevention of Asthma in Atopic Children
study was used to extrapolate the expected SIG food allergy rate based on the
observed prevalence of 30% visible eczema among these initial participants.22
Taken together, the revised estimate of expected food allergy prevalence in the
SIG group was 8%. A principle intention-to-treat analysis will be undertaken
for children evaluable for the primary outcome, with a secondary per-protocol
analysis assessing the effect of degree of compliance on the primary outcome.
Trial design
Between 13 and 17 weeks of age, enrolled infants were randomly assigned
to either the SIG or the early introduction group (EIG). Fig 2 shows the overall
EAT study design.
SIG
Those randomized to the SIG were asked to comply completely with the
current UK government infant feeding guidelines of exclusive breastfeeding
until around 6 months of age and no consumption of allergenic foods before
6 months of age. After 6 months of age, introduction of allergenic foods was
left to parental discretion.
EIG
Infants in the EIG were randomized to the sequential introduction of the 6
chosen allergenic foods alongside continued breastfeeding (see Fig E4 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Infants in this group un-
derwent skin prick tests (SPTs) in duplicate to the 6 intervention foods and
an open incremental food challenge if they showed any sensitization (SPT
response >0 mm, no upper limit). Children who were not sensitized or who
were sensitized but had a subsequent negative food challenge result were
asked to follow the EIG introduction regimen. Those given a diagnosis of al-
lergy based on results of a food challenge were advised to avoid that food and
continue the introduction regimen for the other allergenic foods. Fundamental
to the trial design was the intention that breast milk should remain an
important source of nutrition until at least 6 months of age, regardless of study
group. The EIG introduction regimen is described in more detail in the
Methods section in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.
Online interim questionnaires
An online questionnaire completed monthly until 12 months of age and every
3 months between 12 and 36 months of age by the infants’ parents was the main
portalofcommunicatinginformationaboutthehealthanddietoftheparticipants
tothestudyteam.Parentsreportedanyatopicsymptomsintheirchildrenandany
adverse events (serious and nonserious) through the online questionnaire.
Consumption monitoring
Within this online questionnaire, both groups completed a food frequency
questionnaire section assessing how frequently foods containing the 6 study
allergens were being consumed (see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jacionline.org).
EIG families kept a weekly diary until 1 year of age and monthly thereafter
to assess the degree to which they were meeting the consumption target of 4 g
of each allergenic food protein per week. For each of the last 4 complete weeks
preceding the child’s monthly birthday and for each of the allergenic foods,
parents recorded the percentage of the recommended amount of food their
child was consuming (100%, 75%, 50%, <
_25%, or not tried yet), with
guidance provided on the amount of each food constituting those percentages.
These diary data were then entered into the online questionnaires.
Per-protocol compliance: Overall and food specific
The overall per-protocol compliance criteria for the SIG and EIG are listed
in Table I. Further information about how the responses from the online
questionnaires were used to determine whether per-protocol compliance
was assessable for each participant and whether the criteria in Table I had

 been fulfilled in each group is explained in more detail in the Methods section
in this article’s Online Repository.
Holistic assessment
Participants in the study undergo a comprehensive series of investigations
aimed at understanding what causes sensitization and food allergy to emerge
in children (see the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository).
RESULTS
The EAT study recruited a cohort of 1303 three-month-old
infants who were both geographically and demographically
representative
of
the
population
of
England
and
Wales
(Table II).14,21,23-27 The prevalence of visible eczema at the
3-month enrollment visit was 24.4%, and filaggrin mutation
carriage was 11.9%. Parental history of atopy (any eczema,
asthma, or hay fever in either parent) affected 81.9% of the cohort.
Prevalence of sensitization (SPT >0 mm) in the EIG at the
enrollment visit was 5.1% (33/652). Nine children were sensitized
to cow’s milk (SPT range, 2.5-7 mm), 9 to peanut (SPT range,
1-4 mm), 24 to egg (SPTrange, 1.75-16 mm), none to sesame, 1 to
cod (SPT range, 2.75 mm), and 2 to wheat (SPT range,
1.5-2.25 mm). Eight children were sensitized to 2 or more foods
(milk/egg, 3 infants; milk/peanut, 2 infants; egg/cod, 1 infant;
peanut/egg/wheat, 1 infant; and milk/peanut/egg, 1 infant).
Histamine, like the food allergens, was tested in duplicate. There
were no children with double-negative histamine responses.
Breastfeeding in the EAT study
The EAT study aimed to maintain high breastfeeding rates in
the EIG and achieve high levels of exclusive breastfeeding in the
SIG, in line with UK Government infant feeding policy. For the
EIG, the intention was that exclusive breastfeeding ceased with
the introduction of baby rice (or something similar) shortly after
enrollment. In the EIG 97% (593/610) of infants were still being
breastfed alongside solid food consumption at 6 months of age.
This is significantly higher than the 81% reported to be
breastfeeding at 6 months of age by IFS2010 (P < .001) among
those mothers who had breastfed to 4 months of age (Fig 3).
In the SIG 67% (425/636) of infants were still being
exclusively breastfed at 5 months of age versus 27% in the
IFS2010 by using the baseline of IFS2010 infants exclusively
breastfed at 3 months of age (P <.001). At 6 months of age, 29%
(137/636) of infants were still being exclusively breastfed
compared with only 4% in the equivalent IFS2010 infants
(P < .001). Similar to the EIG, 98% (618/633) of mothers in the
SIG were still breastfeeding by the time their child was 6 months
of age (Fig 3).
Allergenic food consumption
Allergenic food consumption in the EIG from enrollment to
6 months of age is presented in Fig 4. The data are taken from the
4-, 5-, and 6-month online questionnaires and refer to the 4 weeks
previous to the participant’s monthly birthday. Questionnaire
completion rates were high (EIG: 90% at 4 months and 84% at
5 and 6 months). By 6 months, consumption of each allergenic
food had occurred in more than 95% of EIG infants (Fig 4).
The quantity of allergenic food consumed and the speed of intro-
duction varied for each food. The protocol introduced cow’s milk
(as yogurt) as the first allergenic food, and this also being a
familiar infant food was reflected in the consumption results.
Wheat was introduced last and not before 4 months of age, and
adherence to this instruction was 100%. The proportion of EIG
infants consuming the recommended amount of 4 g of food
protein per week by 6 months of age was as follows: cow’s
milk, 85%; peanut, whitefish, and wheat, 65%; and egg and
sesame, 50% (Fig 4).
Cow’s milk formula introduction was minimal in both groups
before 6 months of age: 2% in the SIG and 3% in the EIG ever
having had cow’s milk formula by 4 months of age and 7% in both
groups ever having had cow’s milk formula by 5 months of age. It
was unknown whether mothers would adhere to the SIG regimen
and avoid early introduction of the allergenic foods. Fig 5 shows
the differences between frequency of consumption of allergenic
foods in the SIG and EIG at 4, 5, and 6 months of age. For every
allergenic food, in each age group there was significantly higher
consumption in the EIG than the SIG (P < .001 for each food).
There was minimal consumption of all allergenic foods in the
SIG until 6 months of age, when there was an increase in
consumption of milk and wheat, although these were still
consumed
significantly
less
frequently
than
in
the
EIG
(P < .0005). Only 2.6% of evaluable SIG participants had
introduced any peanut, egg, sesame, fish, or wheat before
FIG 1. EAT study recruitment. *Direct mailing of families with infants aged
5 to 11 weeks in England and Wales. �Exclusively breastfed at enrollment,
37 or more weeks’ gestation, singleton birth, no parental report of major
health concerns, not taking part in other research, willing to attend 3 study
visits over a 3-year period, willing to be randomized to either study group,
and not planning to move from the UK for the study’s duration. �Reasons
included concerns about participation requirements on reading of the full
patient information sheet, wanting to have more flexibility with early
feeding, concerns about traveling to London, child’s father not happy with
participation, unable to reach enrollment visit without introducing formula
and/or solid food, and too many other commitments. §Eight infants
randomized to each group were found to have significant health issues
either on blood testing or the clinical examination at the enrollment visit
rendering them ineligible for enrollment: conditions included severe
vitamin D deficiency, severe iron deficiency, severe failure to thrive, familial
hypercholesterolemia, congenital stridor,

 5 months of age (Table I, criterion C). By 6 months of age, 5.6% of
evaluable SIG participants had been given cow’s milk formula in
a volume exceeding 300 mL for 1 day or more (Table I, criterion
D), 8.8% had been given less than 300 mL/d, and 85.6% had never
had any cow’s milk formula.
In the EIG consumption was low for all allergenic foods except
milk at 4 months of age but increased to a median of at least twice-
weekly consumption for all allergenic foods at 5 and 6 months of
age. However, although the median frequency of consumption of
the 6 allergenic foods was at least twice weekly at 5 and 6 months
of age, 4 of the 6 foods (peanut, egg, sesame, and whitefish) at
5 months and 2 (egg and whitefish) at 6 months of age were being
consumed by 25% of EIG participants only once a week.
Overall per-protocol compliance
For more information on overall per-protocol compliance, see
Table I. The combination of the enhanced difficulty of being
compliance assessable in the EIG (see section on per-protocol
compliance status appraisal in the Methods section in this article’s
Online Repository) and a lower questionnaire completion rate in
the EIG (data not shown) meant that there was a difference in the
proportion whose compliance status was nonevaluable between
the 2 groups (SIG, 7%; EIG, 19%). Hence participants in both
groups in the EAT study fell into 3 compliance categories:
compliant, noncompliant, and compliance not evaluable (not
having completed the requisite questionnaires or formal dropouts
from the study).
Ninety-two percent (558/606) of compliance-evaluable chil-
dren in the SIG met the definition of per-protocol compliance
(Table I). Forty-two percent (223/529) of compliance-evaluable
EIG children complied entirely with the protocol and consumed
3 g or more of the allergenic food protein for 5 of more of the
intervention foods for 5 or more weeks between 3 and 6 months
of age (Table I). These figures represent 86% (558/651) and
34% (223/652) of the whole SIG and EIG groups, respectively.
For the non–compliance-evaluable EIG participants, it is
possible to look at individual interim questionnaire responses to
assess how much of each allergenic food they were consuming for
the questionnaires that were completed (see Fig E2 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This clearly indicates
that allergenic food consumption levels in the nonevaluable
children were similar to those in the noncompliant EIG
participants.

 Food-specific per-protocol compliance
Food-specific per-protocol compliance in the EIG reflected the
relative ease of the introduction of the different foods observed in
Fig 4, and the results for the compliance-evaluable children were
as follows: milk, 84% (451/537); peanut, 61% (336/549);
egg, 42% (234/551); sesame, 52% (288/550); whitefish, 59%
(318/543); and wheat, 39% (216/553). As a percentage of the
whole EIG group (n 5 652), these figures represent the following:
milk, 69%; peanut, 52%; egg, 36%; sesame, 44%; whitefish, 49%;
and wheat, 33%.
By 6 months of age, the per-protocol consumption target of
3 g of allergenic food protein per week was being by
approximately 60% of EIG participants for egg and sesame,
75% for peanut and whitefish, 80% for wheat, and 90% for cow’s
milk (Fig 4).
The effect of altering the number of foods eaten, both
quantity and frequency, during this period is shown in Fig E3
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.
Compliance with the different permutations ranged from 6% to
81% depending on the stringency of the criteria used.

 of the EAT study: however, stopping the study was not considered
at any time point for safety reasons. The independent data
monitoring committee did not raise any concerns regarding either
group.
DISCUSSION
The infant diet in developed countries, such as the UK, is one in
which consumption of many of the principal allergenic foods is
minimal or absent during the first 6 months of life. Among 8- to
10-month-old infants in the IFS2010, egg and fish were being
consumed less than once a week or never in 73% and 44% of
infants, respectively.14 Remarkably, 45% of all mothers in the
IFS2010 actively avoided giving at least 1 particular ingredient.
The most common allergenic food avoided was as follows: nuts
(peanuts and tree nuts), 41% of all mothers; eggs, 12%; dairy,
11%; fish/seafood, 8%; and gluten/wheat, 3%. Concern about
allergies (36%) was the most common reason for avoidance
overall, but this varied by food: egg, 40%; dairy, 47%; and nuts,
63%. Concern about the infant being too young for the food
and the presence of eczema were also common reasons for
avoidance.
However, there are countries in which early allergenic food
exposure is different. Observational evidence has emerged from
both developed countries, such as Israel,19 and developing
countries, such as Ghana,28 where high amounts of peanut are
consumed in a variety of forms during infancy, yet peanut allergy
rates remain very low, suggesting a possible route of tolerance
induction. Among Jewish children, genetic influences are not
responsible because the prevalence of peanut allergy in Jewish
children in the UK at 1.85% was significantly higher than the
Israeli prevalence of 0.17%.12 It is interesting to note that the
incidence of food allergy is believed to be increasing in Africa,29
and a delay in introduction and reduced quantity of consumption
of peanut has been postulated as a possible cause.30,31
Despite the fear of allergy expressed in the IFS2010 survey,
particularly with regard to peanut, we have demonstrated that
parents were prepared to introduce peanuts and other allergenic
foods into their infant’s diet at less than 6 months of age.
Comments on the ability of EIG families to fulfill the overall
per-protocol compliance targets have to take account of the
compliance status being nonevaluable for 19% of the EIG
participants. Consumption data from the questionnaires that
were completed in this group demonstrate that their consumption

Data were available for 4 (581 [89.1%]), 5 (548 [84.0%]), and 6 (537 [82.4%]) months.

PERKIN ET AL 1483
 pattern was similar to the noncompliant EIG participants, and
hence the true overall per-protocol compliance target in the EIG
group was likely to have been closer to 34% than 42%.
This difficulty in achieving the overall per-protocol target of 5 or
more foods at 3 g of allergenic protein or more per week for 5 or
more weeks was not a clear dichotomy of no consumption versus
per-protocol target consumption because we have demonstrated
thatamong EIG families completingthe 6-monthquestionnaire, the
percentage who had never tried each of the allergenic foods was
minimal. However, clearly for at least 58% of EIG participants, the
amount consumed during this early period was less than the overall
per-protocol target we had set. For 4 foods at 5 months of age and 2
foods at 6 months of age, 25% of EIG participants were not
consuming the foods twice weekly, as requested, making it
significantly harder to achieve the per-protocol target in only 1
meal per week (Fig 5). However, the proportion of EIG participants
not reaching the 3-g per week per-protocol target by 6 months was
greater than 25% for egg and sesame, suggesting that although
once-weekly consumption might partly explain why 58% did not
meet the target, for other EIG participants, the amount being
consumed at their 2 (or more) weekly meals clearly was not
sufficient to meet the 3-g per-protocol target when the consumption
for that week was combined.
Despitethe low figure foroverallEIGper-protocolcompliance,at
anindividual-food level, for evaluable EIG participants, compliance
with our per-protocol target varied from 42% for egg to 84% for
milk. Wheat compliance was lower than that for egg but was
distorted by the introduction regimen, which did not allow wheat
introduction before 4 months, hence leaving less weeks available to
achieve the target level of consumption by 6 months of age.
We deliberately set the bar high for overall per-protocol
compliance in the EIG because the amount of allergen protein
needed to potentially induce oral tolerance is unknown. We
wanted to ensure that the majority of those not meeting the 3-g
per-protocol weekly target were still consuming allergenic food
protein in a quantity that might induce tolerance (1 g of peanut
protein twice weekly in our previous research).12 Our weekly
per-protocol target had to balance the need to be recommending
portion sizes appropriate for young infants with a frequency of
consumption that was manageable for families given 6 foods
were being introduced. Eighty-one percent of compliance-
evaluable EIG children were consuming at least 2 g of protein a
week (1 g of protein twice weekly) from at least 4 allergenic
foods for at least 4 weeks between 4 and 6 months of age (see
Fig E3).
Although overall compliance with the UK breastfeeding
recommendations remains poor, the IFS2010 showed a continued
increase in exclusive breastfeeding in the UK, with 69% of
mothers exclusively breastfeeding at birth, up from 65% in
2005.32 Exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age remains
rare, with only 1% achieving this, but rates of nonexclusive
breastfeeding have increased from 25% at 6 months in 2005 to
34% in 2010. Within this context, the breastfeeding performance
in the EAT study exceeded that observed in equivalent mothers in
the IFS2010 at every time point, demonstrating the commitment
of the participants and the study team to promote breast-
feeding. For the first time in a randomized trial, our study
demonstrates that early solid food introduction has no deleterious
effect on breastfeeding duration, which is consistent with the
findings in the observational study by H€
ornell et al.33 This is
particularly important because murine research has suggested
that breastfeeding might be a vital component in the mechanism
to induce tolerance in patients with allergic disease,34 and
therefore the fact that 97% of EIG mothers continued to
breastfeed while introducing allergenic foods might be a key
part of our study findings.
The cohort’s atopy status, as one would anticipate from the
nature of the study, was enriched.35 Eighty-two percent of EAT
participants had a parental history of atopy (mother and/or father
with self-reported asthma, eczema, or hay fever) that was greater
than the 51% rate of allergy (the above conditions and
self-reported food allergy in either parent or a sibling) reported
in the IFS2010. In the latter the rate in mothers with a
managerial/professional
occupation
(more
similar
to
EAT
mothers) was 56%, which was still significantly less than in
EAT. At the 3-year visit, EAT parents undergo SPTs to a panel
of airborne allergens, as well as to any food to which the parent
suspects they are allergic. This will allow an objective measure
of the degree of atopy in EAT parents and the extent to which
this corresponds with the high parent-reported atopy rate. Our
filaggrin mutation inheritance rate (11.9%) was slightly higher
than that observed in the Isle of Wight cohort study (10.3%)36
and a recent Irish birth cohort study (10.5%).25 Studies assessing
unselected cohorts of 3-month-old infants are rare. The EAT

 visible eczema rate at age 3 months (24.4%) was higher than in
the 6-month-old infants examined in the Irish cohort study
(18.7%) by using the same diagnostic criteria, although the
mean SCORAD score among those with eczema was significantly
higher in the Irish study than in our study. The sensitization rate in
the EIG in the EAT study was higher than the 1.2% observation in
the Danish Allergy Research Centre cohort,26 but the latter only
tested for 2 foods, milk and egg, and used only a commercial
SPT solution for the latter.
The EAT study differs from the LEAP study in a number of
important ways. First, the EAT study is conducted on unselected
infants, whereas the LEAP study onlystudied high-risk infants with
severe eczema, egg allergy, or both. Second, the EAT EIG receives
multiple food allergens, as opposed to only peanut. Third, the EAT
study introduces complementary feeding earlier from 3 months of
age. It is noteworthy that the window of opportunity to induce
tolerance to peanut might be narrow. In the LEAP screening study a
significant number of infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or
both could not enter the study or adhere to the study protocol
because of potential or proved pre-existing peanut allergy (SPT
>4 mm and those infants who reacted at baseline).17 The possibility
of earlier introduction of peanut (as early as 3 months of age) could
potentially enhance prevention of peanut allergy in the general
population by inducing tolerance in those children who would
otherwise have peanut allergy early in the first year of life. It
remains unknown whether the window of opportunity to induce
tolerance varies by food. Observational studies have suggested a
protective effect of introducing egg between 4 and 6 months of
age13 and for introducing cow’s milk protein–based formula milk
before 14 days of age.11 Among the randomized controlled trials
published thus far, the Solids Timing for Allergy Research study
introduced egg to 4-month-old infants with a nonsignificant
reduction in egg allergy incidence,16 and the LEAP study achieved
peanut tolerance with introduction between 4 and 10 months of
age.18
The EAT study has created 2 groups with significantly different
early allergenic food exposure. This has been achieved without
any adverse influence on breastfeeding performance. Although
compliance with the early introduction of multiple foods in the
amounts recommended proved difficult, at an individual food
level, early introduction was more favorable. The EAT study
design will allow us to assess the relative importance of the
quantity, frequency, and number of allergenic foods in influencing
food allergy development. We will also be able to investigate
whether factors exist that can predict the likelihood of complying
with the recommended EIG regimen. These findings will help
inform future guidelines regarding early infant feeding policy.

 METHODS
EIG introduction regimen
After normal blood test results at enrollment (complete blood count,
bone, liver, renal, and lipid profile tests), EIG infants proceeded to
introduce baby rice, pureed fruits or vegetables, or both during the first
week until they were established on solid food. They then continued with these
solids and additionally introduced cow’s milk yogurt on 2 days of the second
week. During weeks 3 and 4 of the early introduction regimen, peanut,
hard-boiled egg, sesame, and whitefish (cod) were introduced sequentially in a
random order, with 2 new foods introduced per week. Finally, wheat was
introduced in week 5, reflecting the guidance on optimal timing of
wheat introduction after 4 months of age,E1 and by week 6, infants were
ideally consuming the required amount of all 6 allergenic foods each week
(Fig E4).
Introduction of nonallergenic foods was not restricted during this process,
and the allergenic foods could be given in combination with other foods or
each other once the allergenic foods had been successfully introduced and well
tolerated.
The exact volume of allergen protein necessary to induce oral tolerance is
unknown, but participants were asked to consume the equivalent of 2 g of each
allergenic food protein twice each week (4 g of allergen protein per food per
week). Therefore the full weekly amount for the allergenic foods consisted of
2 small 40- to 60-g portions of cow’s milk yogurt, 3 rounded teaspoons of
peanut butter, 1 small hard-boiled egg (<53 g), 3 rounded teaspoons of sesame
paste, 25 g of whitefish, and 2 wheat-based cereal biscuits (eg, Weetabix).
Allergenic protein dose
The 2 g of allergen protein per dose is based on our earlier research
investigating peanut consumption among Israeli and UK Jewish children.E2 In
that study the median frequency of peanut consumption was 8 times per month
(ie, twice per week), and the median monthly consumption amount was 7.1 g
(ie, about 1 g per dose). Although the Jewish infants were older than those in
our study (8-14 months), research also showed that significant numbers were
eating much bigger doses than the 1-g average.
Therefore we elected to adopt a twice-weekly consumption regimen per
food in accordance with this earlier research. We set our dose target at 2 g. This
allowed for infants falling short of this target to still achieve a level of
consumption that our earlier research had shown appeared to be tolerance
inducing.
Per-protocol compliance status: Definitions
SIG overall per-protocol compliance criteria. For the
SIG, the criteria in Table I reflect a pragmatic interpretation of the current UK
status quo: an incomplete following of the infant feeding recommendations.
Thus allergenic food introduction from 5 months (criterion C), by which point
75% of mothers in IFS2010 have introduced solids to their baby, including
rusks (hard, dry infant biscuits) and yogurts, as well as up to 300 mL/d
cow’s milk formula consumption after enrollment (criterion D), was considered
acceptable. The volume was chosen such that the majority of milk consumed by
the infant was still breast milk. The amount of breast milk consumed
by exclusively breastfed infants was evaluated in a recent systematic review.E3
At 3 to 4 months of age, the mean transfer volume of breast milk was 779 g/d
(SD, 40 g/d); at 5 months, it was 827 g/d (SD, 39 g/d); and at 6 months, it
was 894 g/d (SD, 87 g/d).
EIG overall per-protocol compliance criteria. For the
EIG, criterion C aimed for consumption of at least 5 of the 6 allergenic foods
in at least 75% of the 4-g recommended amount (3 g of allergen protein
per food per week) for at least 5 individual weeks between 3 and 6 months
of age.
EIG food-specific per-protocol compliance criteria. In
the EIG food-specific per-protocol compliance was determined by using the
same threshold as criterion C: consumption of a specific allergenic food in at
least 75% of the recommended amount (3 g of allergen protein/wk) for at least
5 weeks between 3 and 6 months of age.
Per-protocol compliance status: Appraisal
Criterion A for both groups, exclusive breastfeeding at the point of
enrollment, was a prerequisite to taking part in the study, and hence
compliance with this was complete. The ability to determine compliance
with the other individual criteria relied on data being available from the online
questionnaires.
SIG: Overall per-protocol compliance. For the SIG, crite-
rion B (continued breastfeeding up to 5 months) and criterion D (no or
minimal introduction of cow’s milk formula between 3 and 6 months of age)
could be determined from any of the interim questionnaires because every
questionnaire asked at what age the participant stopped breastfeeding and at
what age they started giving their child formula milk. Criterion C (no
consumption of peanut, egg, sesame, fish, or wheat before age 5 months)
required the SIG mother to have completed both the 4- and the 5-month
interim questionnaires for their compliance with this criterion to be evaluable.
EIG: Overall per-protocol compliance. For the EIG, crite-
rion B was the same as for the SIG and hence could be determined from the
response to any interim questionnaire. However, it was criterion C that made
assessment of compliance in the EIG more difficult to be achieved than in the
SIG. Criterion C was consumption of at least 5 of the allergenic foods in at
least 75% of the recommended amount (3 g of allergen protein/wk) for at least
5 weeks between 3 and 6 months of age. For this to be determined, the EIG
family needed to have completed all 3 of the 4-, 5-, and 6-month interim
questionnaires.
Sensitization status
At the enrollment visit, EIG infants underwent SPTs in duplicate to whole
foods for fresh cow’s milk, raw egg white, and tahini (sesame paste) and to
cod, wheat, and peanut by using commercial solutions (Stallergenes, Didcot,
United Kingdom). At 1 year of age, SPTs were undertaken for the whole
cohort with commercial solutions only to a panel of foods (the 6 intervention
foods, soya, and kiwi) and aeroallergens (house dust mite, cat, dog, 6-grass
pollen mix, and 3-tree pollen mix). At 3 years of age, the 1-year investigations
were repeated with additional SPTs to commercial solutions of Brazil nut,
hazel nut, cashew, almond, and walnut and also to salmonella-free raw egg
white. SPT wheal size was the mean wheal size of the duplicate tests.
Attending parents underwent SPTs and blood tests at the 3 year visit.
Food allergy status
All participants underwent an assessment of their allergy status at 1 and
3 years of age with SPTs to all 6 study foods as above and double-blind,
placebo-controlled food challenges where sensitized (SPT >0 mm) and not
consuming the food regularly or open challenges if they fulfilled the study’s
frequent consumer criteria (consumption of an EAT portion [2 g of protein] in
the last month and >
_3 times ever). Any participants with a positive open
challenge result then underwent a double-blind challenge. At any time during
the study, parents could report any allergy symptoms, in which case an
unscheduled clinic visit with skin prick testing and food challenge, if
indicated, was undertaken. The primary outcome, IgE-mediated (positive
SPT response) allergy to 1 or more of the 6 early introduction foods, will be
determined as outlined in Table E1.
Skin assessment
All children were examined for eczema by using the UK diagnostic
criteria–based photographic protocol of the International Study of Asthma and
Allergies in Childhood Phase 2.E4 Disease severity was determined by using
the SCORAD index,E5 and measurement of transepidermal water loss was
done by using the Biox AquaFlux AF200 closed condenser chamber device
(Biox Systems Ltd, London, United Kingdom) on the unaffected skin of the
volar aspect of the forearm.E6
Microbiome
The infant microbiome was assessed through collection of skin swabs at 3
and 12 months and stool samples at 3, 5, and 12 months of age.

 Dust samples
To corroborate reported consumption of egg and peanut, dust samples were
collected fromthe infants’ bedsatenrollmentand at1 year of age tomeasure egg
and peanut protein levels in dust by means of ELISA.E7 Measurement of peanut
in household dust has been used to assess the infants’ consumption of peanut
because the levels of this protein in dust have been shown to correlate well
with results on a food frequency questionnaire for consumption of peanutE8
and were also used to corroborate peanut consumption in the LEAP study.E9
Growth
A broad panel of anthropometric measurements were made, including
length/height, weight, head circumference, triceps and subscapular skin fold
thickness, and mid-upper arm circumference.
Blood sampling
Venous blood was obtained at the 3 visits. The enrollment sample was
screened for the 6 most common FLG mutations (R501X, 2282del4, R2447X,
S3247X, 3673delC, and 3702delG).E10 After safety blood measurements (full
blood count, renal and liver function, and bone metabolism), spare serum was
stored (2708C) for determination of levels of specific IgE to the allergic foods
and component-resolved diagnostics to peanut. PBMCs were stored in liquid
nitrogen for subsequent lymphocyte studies.
Food diary
At 6, 12, and 36 months of age, parents completed a 5-day food diary,
recording in detail their child’s diet, including portion sizes, ingredients,
and commercial food brands, to allow a full nutritional breakdown of
macronutrients during the trial.

FIG E2. EIG compliance status and early introduction of allergenic foods. The mean dose of allergenic
protein consumed each week from enrollment to 12 months of age for each allergenic food is presented for
the EIG group. The EIG group is divided into those who were overall compliant (34%; blue line), those who
were overall noncompliant (47%; red line), and those in whom compliance was nonevaluable (19%; green
line). The nonevaluable EIG participants are shown to have consumption rates similar to those of the non-
compliant EIG participants.

 TABLE E1. Definition of IgE-mediated food allergy for the primary end point
Primary end point definition: Period prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy to the 6 intervention foods between 1 and 3 years of age in both arms
d Category 1A: Positive DBPCFC result at 1 or 3 years of age in a child sensitized to 1 of the 6 intervention foods
d Category 1B: Positive DBPCFC result between 1 and 3 years of age in a child attending an unscheduled clinic visit who was child sensitized to 1 of the 6
intervention foods
Although the first 2 categories relate to events at between 1 and 3 years of age, we will include children potentially outside of this range in 2 exceptional
circumstances:
d Category 2: Positive challenge (open or DBPCFC) result at between 6 months and 1 year of age that occurs in a child sensitized to 1 of the 6 intervention
foods who subsequently refuses a DBPCFC at 1 and 3 years of age
Rationale: Before 6 months of age, only intervention children have challenges, and therefore this category is restricted to those infants who are 6 months or
older.
d Category 3: History of food-induced allergy in a child with an SPT >
_5 mm
Rationale: There will be a small number of children who have an immediate-type allergic reaction and are significantly sensitized whose parents refuse to
allow them to undergo any further challenge.
The relative contributions of children to the final outcome in each of these 4 categories will be presented separately, as well as the overall cumulative figure.

 TABLE E2. Stopping rules in the EAT study
Enrollment in the trial will be stopped pending review if:
d any death occurs;
d a participant is admitted to an intensive care unit for an adverse event related (NCI-CTCAE attribution of adverse events code 4 or 5) to study inter-
vention; or
d a participant randomly assigned to the allergenic food consumption group experiences life-threatening anaphylaxis during the first 3 weeks of admin-
istration of the allergenic food.
Enrollment in the trial will be stopped pending review if any of the following occurs for the EIG:
d an analysis is performed when 100 such participants in the EIG have been followed for 3 months demonstrates that the lower bound of the 95% CI for the
proportion of participants in the EIG with IgE-mediated food allergy, as determined in an unscheduled clinic visit, is greater than 6%;
d an analysis is performed when 200 participants per group have been followed up to 12 months of age demonstrates that the rate of serious adverse events
is significantly greater at the .05 significance level in the allergenic food consumption group than in the SIG; or
d an analysis is performed when 10 such participants in the allergenic food consumption group have been followed until 12 months of age demonstrates
that 4 or more participants have experienced a related (NCI-CTCAE attribution of adverse events code 4 or 5) serious adverse event.
