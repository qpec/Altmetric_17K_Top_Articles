Abstract  
Cardiologists have traditionally paid less attention to commencement of diabetes drugs in their 
patients.  Recently, treatment with two newer classes of diabetes drugs were found to reduce events in 
patients with diabetes and cardiovascular (CV) disease, a group common in cardiology clinics.  The 
sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, markedly and rapidly reduced CV 
death and heart failure hospitalization, likely with hemodynamic/metabolic-driven mechanisms of 
action.  More recently, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide and semaglutide 
also reduced CV death and major adverse CV events, but did so more slowly, suggesting benefits on 
atherothrombosis and/or hypoglycemia avoidance.  We will discuss drug therapy for diabetes relative 
to CV risk, briefly summarize key findings of CV benefit from recent trials, discuss potential 
mechanisms for benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists, and suggest how such drugs might 
be embraced by Cardiovascular specialists to reduce CV and mortality in their patients.

Most cardiologists have focused their efforts on managing traditional risk factors and paid less 
attention to diabetes therapies whose primary role was to lower glucose.  This may be because until 
recently diabetes therapies had little obvious impact on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, the principal 
cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Indeed for cardiologists the most common 
diabetes drug intervention was to stop drugs that may cause heart failure (for example glitazones); 
initiation or titration of drugs for diabetes care was most commonly relegated to primary caregivers or 
diabetes specialists.  If anything, concerns about cardiovascular safety were more prevalent than 
potential benefits of these agents. 
The rise of cardiovascular safety and outcome trials in diabetes care 
In light of concerns regarding cardiovascular safety of new glucose lowering drugs being developed, 
the United States Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency mandated new 
therapies for diabetes had to demonstrate CV safety in prospective, randomized controlled outcome 
trials.  Current recommendations for trial design of new therapies for T2D have been recently 
reviewed (1) and include iterative assessment of drug safety, with initially liberal pre-approval 
statistical boundaries to exclude unacceptable CV risk, followed by more restrictive boundaries post-
approval.  For phase 4 post-marketing outcome trials, ultimately, the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for any T2D treatment should not exceed 1.30 for major adverse CV events 
(MACE), while a 1.80 upper limit applies to phase 3 trials.  Additionally, the recommendation was 
made that trials evaluating novel T2D therapies should focus on high-risk populations (such as those 
with vascular disease, with renal impairment, or at advanced age), should include long-term data, and 
all MACE events measured in such trials should be adjudicated by an independent committee. 
Though designed to detect a risk signal, remarkably, results from recent “cardiovascular outcomes 
trials” (CVOTs) may lead to a meaningful change in how cardiologists might approach the patient 
with diabetes mellitus, as these CVOTs have shown not only CV safety but reduced CV and all-cause 
mortality in some studies (2–4).  These trials include patients who are common to cardiologists’ 
practice and the magnitude of the results compare favorably with the landmark cardiology trials that 
have shaped our international cardiology guidelines (5,6).   
Clearly, cardiologists would do well to keep up with this evolving area of diabetes CVOT to ensure 
that their patients potentially benefit from newer therapies for diabetes care.  In addition, a good 
understanding of the potential risks of diabetes drugs in treating patients with CV disease is also 
important.  Before discussing newer therapies, reviewing experience of the CV effects of older drugs 
is helpful. 
Diabetes drugs that have less favorable or uncertain cardiovascular or mortality risk benefits  
Although meta-analyses of landmark glucose lowering trials suggest intensive glycemic control does 
reduce risk for CV disease events (7), improved CV outcomes as a function of intensive glucose 
control appear modest in comparison to the calculated CV benefits from lipid and blood pressure 
management (8).  In addition, some concerning signals for risk from CV events have been associated 
with certain widely used diabetes medications, including sulfonylureas, thiazoladinediones, 
dipeptidylpeptidase 4 inhibitors, and insulin. 
Sulfonylureas 
Though widely used for care of T2D, drugs from the sulfonylurea class of drugs (though perhaps less 
so for the lesser used gliclazide) (9) have been associated with higher risk for CV events, notably 
 5 
 
including a higher risk for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CV death relative to other diabetes 
drugs (10).  For example, a meta-analysis of 72 small or modest sized randomized controlled trials 
found that all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and a composite of MI, stroke, and CV mortality were 
all increased in patients treated with glibenclamide, glipizide, and tolbutamide, compared to 
metformin (11).  Based on these and other data, sulfonylurea medications carry a ‘black box’ CV 
warning from the FDA regarding heightened risk for CV events, although the same is not true in 
many non-US countries. 
Thiazolidinediones 
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are agonists for the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors that 
regulate gene expression, resulting in improved glucose utilization and reduced glucose production.  
TZDs improve a number of CV risk factors and became widely used at one point; however reports of 
significant CV risk increased following reports of fluid retention with incident heart failure, as well as 
a possible increased risk for incident MI (12), and earlier reports of excess bladder cancer risk now 
debated (13), led to reduction in their use.  For example, the Rosiglitazone Evaluated for Cardiac 
Outcomes and Regulation of Glycemia in Diabetes (RECORD) trial reported an adjusted risk for 
incident heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2.25; 95% CI= 1.27-3.97) (14), similar to findings in a meta-
analysis (15).  The MI risks for rosiglitazone have now been largely dispelled (16) whereas 
pioglitazone does have trial evidence to show net CV benefit (17) but the heightened HF risk as well 
as weight gain and potential risks for fractures with this class of drugs has led to a reduction in their 
use (18).   
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors 
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is an enzyme that degrades many peptides, including glucagon-like 
peptide (GLP)-1; thus, pharmacologic inhibition of DPP-4 prolongs the half-life and biological 
activity of GLP-1.  Inhibitors of DPP-4 have modest glucose lowering effects, but while three recent 
CVOTs did show evidence of CV safety according to FDA criteria, they did not demonstrate net CV 
benefits (19–21) contradicting an earlier meta-analysis (22).  Furthermore, because of recent data 
suggesting a higher risk for incident heart failure associated with use of saxagliptin and alogliptin, 
recent regulatory warnings have been put in place for these two agents.  While meta-analyses suggest 
the risk for incident heart failure to be significant with this class of drug (RR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.01-
1.26) (23), not all DPP-4 inhibitors have been linked to heart failure risk; for example, recent data 
suggest no increased risk for incident heart failure related to sitagliptin use (24). 
Insulin 
Insulin is effective for glucose lowering and is very widely used for the treatment of advanced T2D.  
Therapy with insulin commonly leads to increased body weight and is associated with greater 
hypoglycaemia risks.  Thus, though insulin might improve glycemic control, its other effects may 
theoretically attenuate its clear glucose lowering benefits in subgroups with particular susceptibility to 
hypoglycemia or the adverse effects of hypoglycemia.  There was also some expectation that 
exogenous insulin administration early in the course of T2D may have beneficial effects on CV 
outcomes, however the results of the ORIGIN trial failed to demonstrate any CV benefit (25). 
Diabetes drugs recently reported to reduce cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality risk 
While numerous therapies for T2D have been associated with an increased risk of CV events, three 
recent CVOTs have shown benefit in terms of hard clinical end points (Table 1) (2–4).  We discuss 
 6 
 
first the results for the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, before 
discussing results for two GLP-1 receptor agonists.   
Of course, before we discuss these drugs, it should be noted that up until these recent trials reported, 
metformin was the only drug with trial evidence for CV benefit, albeit modest: in the UKPDS trial 
metformin-treated patients had a 30% lower risk for macrovascular disease than did patients not given 
metformin (26).  Importantly, metformin does not cause weight gain or increased risk for 
hypoglycemia, has many years of safety evidence, and is inexpensive; thus, it is widely used as a first-
line therapy for the patient with CV disease.   
SGLT2 inhibitors 
SGLT2 is a low-affinity, high capacity glucose transporter located in the proximal tubule of the 
nephron; SGLT2 is responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption.  Inhibition of SGLT2 results in 
decrease of blood glucose due to glucosuria.  Secondary effects of SGLT2 inhibition include a modest 
diuretic effect (sodium loss is also promoted), weight loss, and lowering of blood pressure. 
The only available CVOT for SGLT2 inhibitors recently reported reduction in CV events following 
treatment with empagliflozin compared to placebo.  The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial included 7020 
patients with established CV disease and randomized them to placebo, empagliflozin 10mg or 
empagliflozin 25mg.  All study participants had established CV disease.  The primary end point of 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME was 3-point MACE (CV mortality, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke).  
Patients randomized to empagliflozin had a modest reduction in the primary end point (HR 0.86; 95% 
CI 0.74-0.99, p=0.04 for superiority; absolute risk reduction 1.6%; Figure 1).  The reduction in the 
primary end point was driven almost exclusively by a substantial reduction in CV death (HR 0.62; 
95% CI 0.49-0.77, p<0.001; absolute risk reduction 2.2%), whereas non-fatal MI and stroke were not 
significantly altered; a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality was also observed.  In recognition of the 
statistically robust impact on CV mortality, the US FDA recently granted an indication to 
empagliflozin to reduce risk for CV death (27). 
Notably, in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, heart failure hospitalization was reduced by 35% (HR: 0.65; 
95% CI 0.50-0.85, p=0.002; absolute risk reduction 1.4%), with a rapid separation in the survival 
curves suggesting acute benefit of the drug (Figure 1).  The reduction in heart failure events was 
particularly clinically relevant as drugs from other classes of glucose-lowering drugs with very 
different mechanisms of action (in particular saxagliptin and rosiglitazone) had previously been found 
to be associated with an increase in hospitalizations for heart failure (15,19). 
While compelling, there are several reasons heart failure outcome results should be interpreted 
cautiously.  Although hospitalization for heart failure was a pre-specified outcome in EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME, it was not the primary outcome and did not have the rigor characteristic of heart failure 
trials.  Patients could be recruited on the basis of investigator-reported heart failure, but there was no 
formal assessment of heart failure status or cardiac structure or function at baseline; for example, no 
natriuretic peptide measurement or echocardiography was performed.  No understanding regarding 
forms of heart failure (e.g. preserved versus reduced ejection fraction) was established.  Further, it is 
possible some of the 76% of patients included on the basis of coronary artery disease at baseline 
(including 47% with prior MI) may have had unrecognized left ventricular dysfunction.   
In short, the finding of reduced hospitalization for heart failure is impressive but further detail 
documenting the patient characteristic and biomarkers of heart failure is unavailable.  It is possible 
that in some cases empagliflozin prevented the onset of clinical heart failure in those with 
 7 
 
unrecognised left ventricular dysfunction, but also that in some cases empagliflozin treated patients 
who already had unrecognised clinical heart failure.  Mechanistic, or “bedside to bench”, studies are 
now trying to clarify the mechanistic relationship between empagliflozin and heart failure while large 
outcome trials investigating the possible efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in treating heart failure, both 
preserved and reduced ejection fraction, are also underway (28,29). 
Other benefits seen in EMPA-REG OUTCOME may help to understand the impact of empagliflozin 
on CV outcomes.  For example, empagliflozin also had favorable effect on renal end points (30), with 
reduction in incident or worsening nephropathy and incident albuminuria.  Whether these beneficial 
renal effects (thought to reflect reversal of maladaptive tubulo-glomerular renal feedback) are 
secondary to improved perfusion by cardiac or cardiovascular mechanisms or whether they are due to 
primary renal effects is unknown, although most consider renal effects to be critical.   
The mechanism of benefit of empagliflozin is not fully known but several are speculated (Figure 2).  
As noted, empagliflozin has numerous possibly beneficial CV effects including the hemodynamic 
effects of a diuretic, as well as beneficial renal (reduction in intraglomerular pressure) (31), blood 
pressure, and weight effects as well as many others, as recently reviewed (32,33).  Most experts 
believe the rapid reduction in CV death and heart failure hospitalizations seen in EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME is best explained by a rapid hemodynamic effect (33,34).  Natriuresis, in combination 
with renal glucose losses, are thought to lead to a reduction in circulating volume and possibly 
extracellular fluid load with a consequent lowering of cardiac filling and pre- and after-load pressures.  
Supporting this concept was the rapid and sustained increase in hematocrit demonstrated in EMPA-
REG OUTCOME (2), as well as preliminary evidence for empagaflozin-induced  improvements in 
left ventricular mass and diastolic function (35).  
In a more general sense, the data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME suggest many patients with diabetes 
and CV disease may have previously unrecognised excessive fluid overload, often in association with 
cardiac dysfunction, and that these patients benefit rapidly from intravascular decongestion.  Some 
have suggested that less left ventricular stretch, arising from corrections in intravascular fluid load, 
might also decrease the incidence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.  Another potential mechanism 
of benefit is that patients randomized to empagliflozin were less likely to receive other glucose-
lowering therapies (e.g. insulin and sulfonylureas), drugs which increase weight and hypoglycemia 
risks.  Possibly avoidance of these therapies in the treatment arm could have contributed to the 
positive outcome. A further proposed mechanism of benefit of empagliflozin, the ketone hypothesis, 
whereby slightly increased ketones with SGLT2 inhibitors serve as a better fuel supply for the failing 
heart, has been proposed.(36)   
It is important to understand the potential side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.  The most notable adverse 
effect in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was an absolute 4.6% increase in genital infections; a greater 
incidence was noted in females.  Fortunately, these infections are not generally serious and resolve 
with a course of anti-fungal agents.  Once treated they uncommonly recur.  From the perspective of a 
cardiologist, patients should be informed of this risk and shared care with primary care physicians 
(who manage these conditions on a regular basis) is recommended.  It would not be prudent to use 
SGLT2 inhibitors in women or men with a history of recurrent genital infections.  In EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME there was no increase in urinary tract infections, hypoglycemic episodes or diabetic 
ketoacidosis.  Some concern does remain as to whether or not SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk 
of diabetic ketoacidosis outside the tightly monitored environment of a clinical trial, particularly in 
T2D individuals treated with insulin.  It should be noted cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in 
 8 
 
the off label use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1D (37).  Patients given these agents should be 
educated about simple warning signs and symptoms of potential diabetic ketoacidosis.     
It is worthwhile to emphasize EMPA-REG OUTCOME was not a primary prevention trial.  Though 
tempting to speculate, it is impossible to conclude similar benefits would be seen in patients without 
CV disease.  This makes the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME all the more important to the 
practicing cardiovascular specialist, given high prevalence of T2D in those with established CV 
disease (38).  Several other similar safety trials are being conducted with SGLT2 inhibitors with 
slightly differing pharmacology.  However, these trials also differ in size and patient composition.  
For example, 60% of participants in DECLARE [https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01730534] do 
not have prior CVD, which is important.  These trials will report over the next few years. 
GLP-1 receptor agonists  
Although empagliflozin was the first drug for T2D to be proven to reduce CV events, two other drugs, 
both from the GLP-1 receptor agonist family, have been shown to improve CV outcomes, albeit in a 
different pattern to EMPA-REG OUTCOME.   
Liraglutide is a once daily injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist.  It is also associated with weight loss 
and blood pressure lowering.  In the recent Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of 
Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial, 9340 patients with an HbA1c of >7.0% (either 
aged >50 years of age with established CV disease or >60 with one or more CV risk factors) were 
randomized to liraglutide or placebo (3).  The primary end point of MACE was reduced by 13% (HR 
0.87 95% CI: 0.78-0.97; absolute risk reduction 1.9%; p for superiority p=0.01) (Figure 3).  The 
components of the primary end point were all numerically in favor of liraglutide but only CV 
mortality was statistically significantly reduced (HR 0.78 95% CI 0.66-0.93, p=0.007; absolute risk 
reduction 1.3%); all-cause mortality was also reduced (HR 0.85 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97).  Subgroup 
analysis did suggest a greater benefit in those with established CV disease rather than those with risk 
factors in the absence of clinically evident disease.  Nephropathy events were less common with 
liraglutide (1.5 v 1.9/ 100 patient-years) but, in contrast to the widespread renal benefits with 
empagliflozin, liraglutide-driven renal benefits were largely driven by reduction in new-onset 
persistent macroalbuminuria with little discernible effects on other renal outcomes. 
Subsequently, the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide 
in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN)-6 trial investigated the safety of the once weekly GLP-
1 receptor agonist, semaglutide.  In this phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial, 
3297 study participants were treated with semaglutide or placebo.  The inclusion criteria were very 
similar to those used in LEADER, as was the primary end point of three point MACE.  Treatment 
with semaglutide reduced the primary end point by 2.3% (HR 0.74 95% CI 0.58-0.95, p<0.001 for 
non-inferiority; p=0.01 for superiority).  The contribution of the components of MACE to the 
reduction in the primary end point was somewhat different to that seen in LEADER in that CV 
mortality was not affected by semaglutide, but non-fatal stroke was improved (ARR 1.1%; HR 0.61 
95% CI 0.38-0.99) along with a non-significant trend toward lower rates of incident MI.  It is 
important to draw an important distinction between LEADER and SUSTAIN-6, as the latter study 
was a much smaller non-inferiority design, increasing risk for Type 1 and Type 2 error due to 
underpowering. 
It is not yet understood how GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce CV events.  Compared to trials of 
SGLT2 inhibitors, the relative benefit of GLP-1 agonists appeared at a later time following 
 9 
 
randomization (note differences in divergence of Kaplan Meier curves in Figures 1 and 3); this slower 
appearance of CV benefits is more in line with atherothrombotic rather than hemodynamic effects.  
However, both MI and stroke were numerically but not statistically lower with liraglutide than 
placebo in LEADER.  If this was the predominant mechanism of action explaining LEADER results, 
a more convincing reduction in MI or stroke might have been anticipated.  Other possible mechanisms 
are blood pressure reduction, lessening of arterial stiffness (in keeping with lower SBP but higher 
DBP so narrowing of pulse pressure), weight loss and beneficial renal effects.  The reduction in blood 
glucose was more pronounced in the early years in LEADER than in other recent diabetes CVOTs so 
one cannot rule out that glucose-lowering contributed to its beneficial effects; patients randomized to 
liraglutide were less likely to be exposed to insulin or sulphonylureas, prompting speculation that 
preventing exposure to these potentially harmful (or less “net” beneficial) drugs in such patients may 
also be a contributory mechanism.  As well, severe hypoglycemia was significantly lower in patients 
randomized to liraglutide; emerging evidence indicates hypoglycemia may be more harmful in 
patients with existing CV disease, so less hypoglycemia could help explain the CV mortality 
reduction in LEADER.  Other direct vascular or cardiac effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist have been 
proposed and could have contributed to the CV benefits seen (39).   
Taken together and accepting the caveats mentioned above, the somewhat different pattern of CV 
benefits in LEADER versus SUSTAIN-6 suggests that a class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on 
CV outcomes cannot be assumed; rather, benefits and potential harms may differ between different 
GLP-1 receptor agonists. The results of Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering Trial 
(EXSCEL; testing once-weekly exenatide) are eagerly awaited (40). It should also be noted that the 
Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) CVOT did not reduce MACE in 
T2D patients following acute coronary syndrome (41) but whether these results were due to the short 
acting nature of lixisenatide compared to other GLP-1 agonists requires further research.  
As with the SGLT2 inhibitors, a good understanding of the potential side effects of GLP-1 receptor 
agonists should be known.  In trials of these agents, more patients discontinued liraglutide or 
semaglutide than placebo due to adverse events.  This was primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse 
effects, a known side effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs.  There was a slight numerical excess of 
retinopathy events with liraglutide versus placebo (0.6 v 0.5 per 100 patient years); rates of 
retinopathy events were higher in those treated with semaglutide (HR 1.76 95% CI 1.11-2.78), which 
is a concern, although the number of events is rather small.  The more rapid glucose reduction seen 
with semaglutide is theorized to explain increased retinopathy but more work is needed to confirm 
findings, and if confirmed, examine the mechanisms.  There was a concern prior to the trial that 
liraglutide might increase pancreatic conditions but these concerns were not realized. 
Broader lessons learned from recent and prior CV outcome trials of drugs for diabetes 
Diabetes is associated with a higher rates of incident CV disease which most have thought to be due 
to excess atherothrombotic risk with hyperglycemia adding fire to a background of hypertension, 
dyslipidemia and obesity.  However, as MI and stroke rates have declined substantially (42), due in 
considerable part to much better treatments with statins and anti-hypertensives, heart failure and 
peripheral arterial disease have become the two commonest first presentations of CV disease in those 
with T2D (43).  Moreover, once patients with T2D develop CV disease, their risk of premature 
mortality escalates substantially (44) and it is here that the unexpected and rapid CV mortality and 
heart failure benefits in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial have emerged.  These benefits support far 
greater roles of cardiac structural abnormalities and excess fluid loads in driving premature death in 
such patients.  Parallel improvements in renal, CV death and heart failure hospitalization also 
 10 
 
emphasize the importance of cardio-renal interactions in patients with T2D and CV disease.  Though 
cardiologists appreciate the role of kidney dysfunction in heart failure (45) a re-calibration towards 
appreciating overlapping mechanisms with the heart, kidney and T2D is worthwhile. 
The recent positive CVOTs have also taught diabetologists that it is not necessarily lowering glucose 
per se (or even how much one lowers glucose) that only matters.  In addition, the mechanism by 
which any particular diabetes drugs work and its associated multiple effects on other pathways may 
matter more to observed CVD benefits.  EMPA-REG OUTCOME, LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 have 
shown blood glucose, CV and total mortality can be lowered in parallel with specific drugs that might 
improve hemodynamic status of patients or else lower glucose in conjunction with reduced weight, 
lower risk for hypoglycemia and improved blood pressure; possible direct beneficial direct effects on 
atherosclerosis may also be considered (Figure 4).  
Clinical implications for the practicing cardiologist 
It is impossible for cardiologists to assume full responsibility of blood glucose management; however, 
a change in thinking regarding initiation and titration of therapies with CV benefits is necessary, 
particularly since most patients with T2D develop CV disease and are frequently encountered in 
cardiology practice.  As well, the patient with CV disease frequently has unrecognized or undertreated 
T2D: in the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) 
study, in addition to the 27% of patients with recognized T2D, 11% of patients with heart failure had 
unrecognized T2D (46).  
In light of the new trial evidence of clinical benefit over and above existing therapies, and with the 
emergence of recent guidelines mentioning these CV benefits (47,48), it seems logical to suggest 
cardiologists perform routine, systematic measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in all those with 
established CV disease (Figure 5; Central Figure).  Measurement of HbA1c should be performed 
both to diagnose T2D and to identify those that would have met the inclusion criteria for the positive 
CVOTs (e.g. HbA1c 7-10% in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and >7% in LEADER and SUSTAIN). Care 
of patients with T2D and CV disease should involve strong consideration for use of glucose lowering 
drugs that improve CV outcomes over and above existing therapies and not solely on the glucose-
lowering abilities of therapies.  In this regard, beyond their glucose lowering effects, empagliflozin, 
liraglutide or semaglutide (when available) might be considered for eligible patients for their proven 
CV benefits.  Of course, one should also recognize identifying new diabetes in patients with CVD will 
also have other beneficial implications including, where relevant, the choice of revascularization 
(CABG vs. PCI), and the aggressiveness of management of other risk factors.  
In analogy to the “heart team” approach used for those with other forms of heart disease, collaboration 
between cardiologists, primary care physicians and diabetologists will be necessary to achieve the 
goal of more widespread treatment of vulnerable patients with T2D.  Management of adverse effects 
such as genital infections are an obvious example where this approach is likely to be beneficial.  
There is no reason that cardiologists cannot initiate SGLT2 inhibitors with the patient then monitored 
by colleagues in primary care or diabetology.  While cardiologists might recommend GLP-1 receptor 
agonists, specialized teaching by primary care physicians and/or diabetologists might be needed.  If 
the CV specialist does not feel comfortable prescribing these drugs, they should not only inform the 
patients but also the primary care physician (and other health care professionals involved in the 
patient's care) of the potential benefits of adding these drugs.  
Clinical implications for the practicing diabetes specialist 
 11 
 
Diabetologists have lowered CV risk by prescribing statins and anti-hypertensive for decades, but 
these have conventionally been started to lower cholesterol or blood pressure rather than because of 
recognition of CV disease.  Based on present data, if a diabetes specialist recognizes a patient has CV 
disease, they have identified a patient who might benefit from therapy with newer agents such as 
SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.  While numerous therapies exist to lower blood 
glucose, it will take a continued shift in philosophy towards using therapies that not only lower blood 
glucose modestly, but significantly reduce CV risk.  Our view is that given empagaflozin is oral 
(rather than injectable) and has a more marked effect on CVD and total mortality, it should be the 
preferred choice (along with metformin) in most patients with CVD and diabetes.  Of course, 
treatments need to be individualised and other factors such as renal function, and patient preference 
may mean a GLP-1 receptor agonist is prescribed.     
The future 
There are an array of ongoing safety CV outcome trials with DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor 
agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors in similar populations to the trials described in this manuscript, but 
also, importantly, including patients without CVD (49).  The knowledge of the pros and cons of other 
agents in varying populations will evolve over the next 1-5 years. Trials with SGLT2 inhibitors are 
also underway in patients with heart failure, including those with T2D, pre-diabetes, as well as those 
without T2D.  Trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease are also underway.  
Trials of the combined effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists may also be 
reasonable, given the possible (and potentially additive) differences in mechanism of benefit of these 
agents. 
Ultimately, studies of newer drugs for T2D must shift to focus on patients without prevalent CV 
disease (49).  It is typically harder to prove CV benefit in such trials, given lower rates of incident 
events; enrichment of patient populations with tools to identify higher risk for CV events might be a 
way that can identify subgroups that potentially benefit.  Circulating biomarkers might be such a tool.  
When measured in patients with T2D concentrations of amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide 
and highly sensitive troponin may be helpful to predict future CV events, including heart failure and 
atherothrombotic events (50–52).  Thus it may be possible to envision a strategy of biomarker-guided 
screening and treatment of patients with T2D at high risk for CV events.   
Conclusion 
When the first few CVOTs of newer diabetes drugs began to report CV safety without reduction in 
CV risk, some started to question the value of these clinical trials.  However, recent CVOTs have 
shown convincing evidence of CV benefit with an SGLT2 inhibitor and two classes of GLP-1 
receptor agonists.  Cardiologists should make note of the substantial reduction in CV events and CV 
mortality in these trials.  If clinical experience follows the results of studies such as EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME (SGLT2 inhibitor) or LEADER (GLP-1 receptor agonist), a sizeable proportion of 
patients seen and managed by cardiologists on a daily basis might benefit from treatment with these 
novel agents.  Consequently, cardiologists would do well to familiarize themselves with these drug 
classes as many of their patients (i.e. T2D plus CV disease) stand to benefit from their use. 
Cardiologists should also consider screening more widely for T2D, to identify patients who could 
benefit sooner from such drugs.  By doing so it will be possible to better impact upon the rising 
burden of patients with both T2D and CV disease.

Figure 2: Potential pathway linking empagliflozin (and possibly other SGLT2 inhibitors) with 
lower risks for heart failure hospitalization and death due to cardiovascular disease. Adapted 
from reference (28).  By increasing fluid losses via urinary glucose and sodium losses, intravascular 
volumes and systolic blood pressure are reduced, and there is a significant rise in haematocrit and 
modest weight loss. These changes in turn lessen cardiac stressors (pre- and afterload) and may help 
improve myocardial oxygen supply. The net result is a likely improvement in cardiac systolic and 
diastolic function, lessening chances of pulmonary congestion, thus lowering risks of hospitalization 
for heart failure and fatal arrhythmias. These cardiac function benefits could, in turn, feedback to 
improve renal function.

Figure 4:  Summary of new diabetes drugs and patterns of CV benefits in patients with T2DM 
and CV disease.   In patients with CV and T2DM, a combination of atherogenic and hemodynamic 
disturbances (the latter driven by combinations of renal disease, cardiac dysfunction and potentially 
obesity) likely contribute to accelerated CV and total mortality risks.  If this is correct, SGLT2 
inhibitors might be more likely to correct hemodynamic processes whereas GLP-1 receptors may act 
more to lessen atherogenic processes over time; both may aid hypoglycemia avoidance. This 
schematic also predicts the combination of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists may be 
yield additive benefits in patients with T2D and CV disease but further research is needed to test this 
supposition.

Figure 5 (Central Figure): The novel paradigm for care of the patient with CV disease and T2D.  
The cardiologist will need to take a more active role in patient care by more frequent testing for T2D 
using HbA1c in patients with CV disease to identify suitable patients for newer T2D therapies.  
Cardiologists should also prescribe T2D drugs with proven CV benefits and work more efficiently 
with diabetologists and primary care physicians to manage their patients.
