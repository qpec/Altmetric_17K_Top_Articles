ABSTRACT
Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) results from an exacerbated immuno-
logical response that is highlighted by a burst in the production of inflammatory
mediators known as a “cytokine storm.” Previous reports have suggested that non-
specific activation of T lymphocytes may play a central role in this phenomenon.
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 1 (Tim-1) has recently
been shown to interact with virion-associated phosphatidylserine to promote infec-
tion. Here, we demonstrate the central role of Tim-1 in EBOV pathogenesis, as Tim-
1�/� mice exhibited increased survival rates and reduced disease severity; surpris-
ingly, only a limited decrease in viremia was detected. Tim-1�/� mice exhibited a
modified inflammatory response as evidenced by changes in serum cytokines and
activation of T helper subsets. A series of in vitro assays based on the Tim-1 expres-
sion profile on T cells demonstrated that despite the apparent absence of detectable
viral replication in T lymphocytes, EBOV directly binds to isolated T lymphocytes in a
phosphatidylserine–Tim-1-dependent manner. Exposure to EBOV resulted in the
rapid development of a CD4Hi CD3Low population, non-antigen-specific activation,
and cytokine production. Transcriptome and Western blot analysis of EBOV-
stimulated CD4� T cells confirmed the induction of the Tim-1 signaling pathway.
Furthermore, comparative analysis of transcriptome data and cytokine/chemokine
analysis of supernatants highlight the similarities associated with EBOV-stimulated T
cells and the onset of a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry revealed virtually exclusive
binding and activation of central memory CD4� T cells. These findings provide evi-
dence for the role of Tim-1 in the induction of a cytokine storm phenomenon and
the pathogenesis of EVD.
IMPORTANCE
Ebola virus infection is characterized by a massive release of inflam-
matory mediators, which has come to be known as a cytokine storm. The severity of
the cytokine storm is consistently linked with fatal disease outcome. Previous find-
ings have demonstrated that specific T-cell subsets are key contributors to the onset
of a cytokine storm. In this study, we investigated the role of Tim-1, a T-cell-
receptor-independent trigger of T-cell activation. We first demonstrated that Tim-1-
knockout (KO) mice survive lethal Ebola virus challenge. We then used a series of in
vitro assays to demonstrate that Ebola virus directly binds primary T cells in a Tim-1–
phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. We noted that binding induces a cytokine
storm-like phenomenon and that blocking Tim-1–phosphatidylserine interactions re-
duces viral binding, T-cell activation, and cytokine production. These findings high-

T
he recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa has resulted in more than
27,000 infections with more than 11,000 fatalities (1). While the efficacies of several
EBOV candidate vaccines and therapeutic strategies are currently being assessed,
supportive care remains the primary method of treatment (2). Moreover, despite a
moderate efficiency, EBOV candidate vaccines are associated with harmful side effects,
including high levels of inflammation and lymphopenia (3–6). Unraveling the complex
and multiple mechanisms employed by EBOV that lead to rapid disease progression
remains critical to the development of postexposure therapeutic interventions.
Copious EBOV replication within dendritic cells (DCs) and the monocyte-macrophage
lineage (7, 8) renders both the innate and adaptive immune responses ineffective
shortly following infection. Several groups, including ours, have shown that EBOV-
infected DCs are incapable of functional maturation (9–11), resulting in an impaired
ability to activate antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses (12, 13). A characteristic
feature of EBOV infections is lymphopenia, which is observed in both humans and
experimentally infected nonhuman primates (NHP) (8, 14–20). Lymphopenia is typically
observed in EBOV patients who succumb to disease, whereas survivors have been
shown to maintain CD3� T-lymphocyte populations throughout the course of disease
(21, 22). Strikingly, lymphopenia occurs despite the inability of EBOV to infect lympho-
cytes (14, 23).
Several clinical and experimental studies have correlated the massive burst in
immunological mediators, known as a cytokine storm, with morbidity and mortality
associated with influenza, bacterial sepsis, and viral hemorrhagic fever diseases (24–29).
Cytokine storm has also been implicated as a central factor contributing to EBOV
disease (EVD) (21). A cytokine storm in response to viral infections is characterized by
induction of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. Inflammatory mediators in-
duced during a severe cytokine storm usually include interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis
factors (TNFs), interleukins (ILs), and chemokines (24, 30, 31). Overall, more than 150
cytokines have been proposed to contribute to the development of a cytokine storm,
which, in combination with a relative redundancy of cytokine/chemokine signaling, has
been highly detrimental to the development of effective treatments (24).
The precise mechanisms of induction of cytokine storm are largely unknown.
However, it is known that numerous unrelated viruses and bacteria trigger cytokine
storm by engagement of T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 or by activation of pathogen-
associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognition pathways, such as Toll-like receptors
(32–35). Furthermore, it has been suggested that following the release of proinflam-
matory mediators by virus-infected macrophages, T lymphocytes respond by further
contributing to the accumulation of the proinflammatory mediators which contribute
to the immunopathology associated with the onset of a cytokine storm and further
activate macrophages (36, 37). This suggests that the development of a cytokine storm
is the result of a feed-forward loop.
Monocytes and DCs are among primary target cells of EBOV (7); despite infection,
their ability to secrete cytokines and chemokines and undergo maturation is limited
(9–11), which further limits their capacity to activate an adaptive immune response.
This suggests that other cell types may contribute to the mass production of pro- and
anti-inflammatory mediators during EBOV infection, although the identity of these cells
and the mechanism by which they contribute to the development of a cytokine storm
remain to be elucidated.
The membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) has been identified as an endo-
somal receptor that is required for EBOV entry into target cells (38, 39). Recently, the
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 1 (Tim-1) was identified

 as an EBOV attachment factor (40). Both human and murine macrophages have been
shown to express Tim-1 and phagocytose apoptotic bodies via interaction with its
membrane-associated phosphatidylserine (PS) (41). Similarly, EBOV entry in vitro was
shown to be dependent on virion-associated PS (42). Due to the roles of Tim-1 in
enveloped-virus binding (40, 42) and immunomodulation of the inflammatory re-
sponses following activation of its signaling pathway (43, 44), we investigated the role
of Tim-1 in the pathogenesis of EVD in vivo and extended our analysis ex vivo to
determine what effects, if any, EBOV may have directly on CD4� T cells.
RESULTS
Tim-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of EVD. In order to determine the extent
to which Tim-1 is associated with EVD pathogenesis, Tim-1�/� mice were infected with
a mouse-adapted strain of EBOV (45). One hundred percent of control, wild-type (WT)
mice died or were moribund and euthanized as required by protocol by day 8
postinfection (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, 80% of Tim-1-knockout (KO) mice survived, with only
one fatality occurring at day 11 postinfection. An increase of illness scores (Fig. 1B) and
weight loss (Fig. 1C) was observed in both groups; however, the surviving Tim-1�/�
mice completely recovered by day 16 postinfection. Based on these findings and
previous reports regarding the known functions of Tim-1, we conducted in-depth
analysis to determine whether the absence of Tim-1 altered the inflammatory response.

 We first examined the relative cytokine and chemokine levels in serum samples
collected 6 days following EBOV challenge by using a multiplex-based bead assay.
Quantitative analysis revealed that multiple Th1 cytokines, including gamma interferon
(IFN-�), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), were significantly
reduced in Tim-1�/� mice compared to EBOV-infected wild-type mice (Fig. 2A to C),
while IL-12p40 was increased (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were
also significantly reduced (Fig. 2C). We also detected a significant reduction of
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (see Table S1 in the sup-
plemental material), which stimulates stem cells to differentiate into granulocytes and
monocytes (46). Following activation, prolonged Tim-1 expression was shown on both
Th1 (~1 week) and Th2 (~3 weeks) cells (47); hence, the decrease in production of most
of the Th1 and Th2 cytokines may be due to the absence of the costimulatory function
of Tim-1, which normally occurs following TCR engagement with antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) through upregulation of a Tim-1 ligand, Tim-4 (reviewed in reference 48).
Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that at day 6, gated CD4� T cells from Tim-1�/�
mice appeared to produce elevated levels of IL-2, IFN-�, and TNF-� compared to
wild-type, EBOV-infected mice (Fig. 2D). Unexpectedly, analysis of viremia indicated
that Tim-1�/� mice had nearly equivalent levels of viral genomes per milliliter of serum
(Fig. 2E). These findings suggest that (i) Tim-1 may be one of several receptors that
support viral attachment and/or entry and (ii) despite high plasma viremia, the de-
crease of inflammatory mediators or the development of an altered immunological
response may have led to survival of Tim-1�/� mice. Taken together, our data suggest
that Tim-1 is critically involved in EVD; however, Tim-1�/� mice exhibited clinical signs
associated with EVD during the early phase of disease despite the significant increase

 in survival. Furthermore, a robust, albeit altered, inflammatory response and the
presence of nearly equivalent viremia levels in Tim-1�/� mice in comparison to WT
mice are consistent with the presence of additional attachment factors for EBOV.
Previous studies have identified the lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (49–51), folate receptor
� (52), and Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinases (53) as attachment factors for the virus.
EBOV directly binds to T lymphocytes, inducing a “superagonist-like” effect. As
noted, despite the ability of EBOV to lead to lymphopenia, the virus does not infect
lymphocytes. Due to the involvement of Tim-1 signaling in the stimulatory effects on
CD4� T cells, we next sought to investigate if EBOV directly interacts with T cells. Flow
cytometry binding assays were developed and validated using Vero-E6 and 293T cells,
both of which are susceptible to EBOV infection. Cells were incubated with EBOV-green
fluorescent protein (GFP) for 2 h at 4°
C, washed, stained with anti-EBOV serum, and
analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. S1A). A high percentage of EBOV binding was
observed with Vero-E6 cells (�60%), while 293T cells exhibited a reduced binding of
~16%. Unexpectedly, EBOV binding was similarly observed on primary CD4� T cells and
Jurkat cells (Fig. 3A). When cells were exposed to EBOV at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 1 PFU/cell, a shift in the bulk population of cells and the development of an
EBOV glycoprotein (GP)Hi population were detected in both CD4� T cells (13.3%) and
Jurkat cells (12.7%) (Fig. 3B). The MOI of 3 PFU/cell resulted in an increase of the GPHi
population to 34% (Fig. S1B), suggesting that the effect is dose dependent. Confocal
microscopy was then performed to determine the relative distribution of cell-bound
EBOV at the plasma membrane. This analysis further confirmed a direct binding of EBOV
particles to purified human CD4� T cells and Jurkat cells, as well as 293T cells (Fig. 3C).
We noted that the short 2-h-long incubation of primary CD4� T lymphocytes with EBOV
resulted in a rapid development of a CD4Hi CD3Low population in isolated primary
CD4� T cells and Jurkat cells (Fig. 3D and E). Overnight CD3/CD28 bead activation
followed by 2-h GP binding analysis resulted in an increase in the CD4Hi CD3Low
population of EBOV-positive cells compared to nonstimulated cells (Fig. 3D, lower
panel). Back-gating of GP-bound cells revealed that the vast majority of binding
occurred in the CD4Hi CD3Low population (Fig. 3D and E, back-gated). A rapid and
specific downregulation of CD3 is a major characteristic feature of the effect of
staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) superantigen (54); we therefore compared the
effects of EBOV and SEB on the expression of CD4 and CD3. Following 4 days of culture,
a striking similarity between the effects of EBOV and SEB was observed, the former
being clearly dose dependent (Fig. 3F).
Recent findings demonstrated that virion-associated phosphatidylserine (PS) is suf-
ficient to permit EBOV binding to cells susceptible to the virus, which is followed by
internalization of virions attached to PS-binding receptors (40, 42). We therefore sought
to determine if binding of EBOV to CD4� T cells triggers PS-associated signaling
pathways. Indeed, transcriptome analysis demonstrated that EBOV stimulation induced
PS-related signaling as early as 24 h postinfection, the earliest time point analyzed, and
Tim-1 (HAVCR1) was among the significantly differentially expressed genes (Fig. 3G).
We therefore examined whether EBOV binding to T lymphocytes could be inhibited
through the addition of PS-containing liposomes to cell cultures. Indeed, when PS-
liposomes were added to purified CD4� T cells 1 h prior to the addition of EBOV, viral
binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no reduction was ob-
served following the addition of phosphatidylcholine (PC)-containing vesicles (Fig. 3H).
PS is present on the EBOV membrane (55); the addition of annexin V, a PS-binding
substrate, to virions prior to addition to T cells also reduced EBOV binding. Consistent
with the decreased binding, the addition of PS-containing liposomes significantly
reduced the development of the CD4Hi CD3Low population observed in our binding
assay (Fig. 3I).
Next, we attempted to determine if EBOV internalized together with the TCR
complex. CD4� T cells were cultured with EBOV for 2 h at 4°
C to promote binding,
washed, and treated with trypsin either immediately or following a 1-h incubation at

C. Western blot analysis demonstrated that EBOV NP protein was detectable only in
control nontreated cells and samples cultured at 37°
C prior to trypsin digestion,
suggesting that the viral particles were internalized (Fig. 3J). Consistent with our flow
cytometry analysis, the CD3� subunit of the TCR complex was higher in EBOV-treated
samples, further providing evidence of rapid TCR internalization. Similarly, EBOV stim-
ulation of naive and CD3/CD28-activated CD4� T cells resulted in the reduction of
full-length CD3�, with an increase in cleavage product of CD3� being detected in
EBOV-stimulated samples (Fig. S1C). Taken together, these results indicate that the TCR
complex is internalized and degraded rapidly following exposure to EBOV. Confocal

 microscopy experiments further demonstrated colocalization of EBOV and CD3� within
Rab7� late endosomes (Fig. S1D). Despite EBOV internalization, no viral replication was
detected in T cells (Fig. S2). Consistent with these results, comparative transcriptome
analysis indicated that EBOV stimulation of CD4� T cells induced a significant upregu-
lation of genes whose interactions together enrich for functional pathways known to be
induced by superagonists (Fig. S3). Significantly upregulated genes in this pathway,
including IRF1, IRF7, and ZBP1, have been previously described as participants in global
host transcriptional responses to superagonist (56).
Binding of EBOV induces T-cell activation and cytokine production. We next
determined the relative extent of EBOV-induced activation of T cells by comparing
populations positive for markers of activation and proliferation in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), PBMCs depleted of target cells (DCs and monocytes), and
isolated CD4� T cells (Fig. 4). A 48-h-long incubation of these cells in the presence of
EBOV resulted in upregulation of the percentages of CD25�, CD69�, and Ki-67�
populations compared to cells incubated without the virus. Typically, addition of EBOV
to PBMC cultures resulted in less than a 2-fold increase in the percentages of activated
CD4� T cells, and when DCs and monocytes were depleted, a 2- to 2.5-fold increase was
detected (Fig. S4). However, the addition of EBOV to isolated CD4� T cells resulted in
the highest relative increase of populations positive for all three activation markers,
with a 3.5- to 4.5-fold increase being observed (Fig. 4A to C). These findings indicate
that CD4� T cells are activated more efficiently in the absence of known target cells,
demonstrating that EBOV directly stimulates CD4� T cells.
As noted, we observed a striking similarity between stimulation of CD4� T cells by
EBOV and known superagonists. A characteristic feature of superagonist activity is the
release of inflammatory mediators. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is the key
transcriptional regulator of inflammatory mediators (57). We therefore examined the
phosphorylation kinetics of NFAT-1 following incubation of CD4� T cells and Jurkat
cells with EBOV. We found that EBOV stimulation results in the induction of the NFAT
signaling pathway, as evidenced by a rapid induction of the activated, monophosphor-
ylated form of NFAT-1; a similar effect was detected following addition of known
inducers of NFAT, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)–ionomycin or staphylo-
coccal enterotoxin B (SEB) (Fig. S5A and B). Consistent with these findings, EBOV
stimulation of Jurkat cells transfected with a construct expressing luciferase under the
control of an NFAT promoter resulted in increased luciferase activity (Fig. S5C). In order
to directly assess the resulting activation of T cells contributing to inflammatory
response, CD4� T cells were incubated in the presence of EBOV for 48 h and analyzed
by flow cytometry. The analysis demonstrated the increased percentages of cells
positive for IL-2, IFN-�, and TNF-� compared to cells incubated without the virus
(Fig. 4D to F).
Analysis of supernatants of EBOV-infected PBMCs using a bead-based multiplex
assay demonstrated the increased production with both Th1 and Th2 cytokines and
CXCL8 chemokine (IL-8), also produced by T cells (58), compared to uninfected PBMCs.
The effect was strongly increased when macrophages and DCs were depleted and was
maximal with purified CD4� T cells (Fig. 4G and H and S6A and B and Table S2). This
is consistent with the greater fold increase in activation markers detected in isolated
CD4� T cells in comparison to EBOV-infected total PBMCs and PBMCs with DCs and
macrophages depleted (Fig. 4A to C and S4). Analysis of cells after stimulation with SEB
demonstrated greater concentrations of cytokines in supernatants; however, intracel-
lular cytokine levels were lower as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 4D to F and S6C
to H), which suggests a more rapid kinetics of activation. Comparative transcriptome
analysis of previously identified pathways at days 1 and 4 after stimulation of CD4� T
cells with EBOV indicated that the response is consistent with the coordinated upregu-
lation of genes characteristic of a cytokine storm (Fig. 4I). While the response in this
inflammation network was much more pronounced on day 1, many of these genes still
remained significantly upregulated on day 4.

 EBOV binding and activation of primary CD4� T cells is associated with Tim-1.
Previous reports indicated that Tim-1 signaling is sufficient to activate primary CD4� T
cells, and under certain conditions, Tim-1 may act as a costimulator of T cells, leading
to increased activity (59). We therefore analyzed the role of Tim-1 in activation of
primary CD4� T cells exposed to EBOV. Targeting of Tim-1 by small interfering RNA
(siRNA) significantly reduced activation of T cells, based on expression of CD25 and
CD69 (Fig. 5A and B). Signal transduction through Tim-1 was shown to result in Lck (Src
kinase family)-dependent phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Tim-1, resulting in
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (59). Consistent with the
role of Lck signaling, exposure of the Jurkat-derived cell line deficient for Lck, J.Cam1.6,
to EBOV did not result in the downregulation of plasma membrane-associated CD3 or
the upregulation of CD25 or CD69 and showed almost no binding of GP (Fig. S7A to D).
Moreover, the addition of the Src kinase inhibitor Ly294 or the PI3K inhibitor PP2
significantly reduced the expression of both CD25 and CD69 (Fig. 5C and D). Unex-
pectedly, treatment with Ly294 or PP2 also resulted in a decrease in EBOV binding,
which coincided with a significant drop in the development of the previously observed
CD4Hi CD3Low population (Fig. 5E) and reduction in Tim-1 expression (Fig. S7E and F).
Therefore, the reduction of both EBOV binding and the CD4Hi CD3Low population is
likely associated with the reduced Tim-1 expression. The ability of Lck and PI3K
inhibitors to block cellular activation was further verified with primary CD4� T cells and
Jurkat cells following stimulation with CD3/CD28 beads in the presence or absence of
the inhibitors (Fig. S8A to D). Moreover, expression of Tim-1 in J.Cam1.6 cells was lower
than in Jurkat cells, suggesting that Tim-1 expression may be associated with basal Lck
activity during a nonproliferative state. Further demonstrating the role of the PI3K

 pathway in EBOV-induced activation, both PP2 and Ly294 blocked EBOV-induced
activation and phosphorylation of Akt, which is dependent upon PI3K activity (60)
(Fig. 5F and S8E to H). These findings demonstrate that binding of EBOV to Tim-1 on the
surface of primary T lymphocytes results in their direct activation, suggesting a direct
role of Tim-1 in the development of a cytokine storm and pathogenesis associated with
EBOV-infection.
EBOV predominantly binds to TCM cells and activates CD4� T cells in the
absence of target cells. We next sought to determine whether EBOV binding was
random or if specific CD4� T-cell subsets were targeted. A reduced MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell
was used to prevent saturation of binding; otherwise, the binding was performed as
previously described. As indicated in Fig. 6A (left panel), the addition of EBOV induced
the development of a distinct population staining double positive for HLA-DR and
CD38, which represents an activated CD4� T-cell subset. The GP� population (middle
panel) was then back-gated onto the HLA-DR-versus-CD38 plots (right panel). A clear
overlap between the GP� population and the activated subset was apparent, further
indicating that EBOV directly activates primary human CD4� T cells. To determine if
EBOV preferentially bound and activated naive or memory cells, cells were stained with
CD45RO and HLA-DR (Fig. 6B). The majority of GP� cells staining positive for HLA-DR
costained for CD45RO, indicating that EBOV binding was associated with CD4� memory
T cells. We then assessed whether EBOV bound to a specific subset of memory cells
following costaining with CD45RO and CCR7 (Fig. 6C). GP binding was assessed in the
three quadrants representing CD45RO� CCR7� effector memory T cells (TEM), CD45RO�
CCR7� central memory cells (TCM), and CD45RO� CCR7� naive cells (TNaï
ve). A GP�
population was primarily observed in TCM cells cultured in the presence of EBOV;
back-gating to CCR7-versus-CD45RO plots revealed a distinct population within the
central memory quadrant. These findings indicate that EBOV preferentially binds to a
specific subset of TCM cells. Further investigation is under way to determine the precise
phenotype and identity of this subset of EBOV-binding T cells; however, as previously
reported, Tim-1 expression was highest on TCM cells (Fig. 6D).
We next examined the effects of short-term (1- and 4-day) cultures of isolated CD4�
T cells in the presence of EBOV (MOI of 0.3 PFU/cell) on the relative percentages of
Th2/Th17 cells versus Th1 cells by flow cytometry. A decrease in the percentages of the
Th1 (CD45RO� CXCR3�) cells was consistently observed at both time points (Fig. 6E).
This finding suggests that EBOV may preferentially reduce the Th1 cells or lead to
expansion of the Th2/Th17 cells. During our analysis, we noted an increase in CD4
expression, which is consistent with cellular activation and division of stimulated cells
(61). The majority of CD4Hi cells costained for the activation marker CD38 (Fig. 6F,
bottom left panel). Of note, the addition of EBOV to cells prestimulated with CD3/CD28
activation beads consistently resulted in higher levels of activation than that for cells
stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads alone (Fig. 6F, top right versus bottom right). As
expected, stimulation with CD3/CD28 beads further upregulated the CD4 receptor on
EBOV-exposed T cells. Further analysis revealed a greater increase in the percentages of
HLA-DR� CD38� T cells when cells were costimulated with activation beads and EBOV
than when stimulated with beads alone (Fig. 6G). Overall, these findings indicate that
EBOV preferentially binds and activates a subset within the TCM population and also
further stimulates CD4� T cells following TCR-mediated activation.
DISCUSSION
Our in vivo studies demonstrated the central role of Tim-1 in EVD pathogenesis and
indicate a putative therapeutic intervention strategy. Previous in vivo studies have
demonstrated that simultaneous infusion of an agonistic Tim-1-specific antibody with
antigen results in increased IL-4- and IFN-�-expressing CD4� T cells and prevents the
development of respiratory tolerance and increased pulmonary inflammation (47). We
note that while both IL-4 and IFN-� were significantly elevated in wild-type EBOV-
infected mice, a statistically significant decrease in both cytokines was detected in
serum of EBOV-infected Tim-1�/� mice. Similarly, another study demonstrated that

 administration of a Tim-1 natural ligand, Tim-4–Ig fusion protein, resulted in hyper-
proliferation of T cells (62). In the course of EVD, it is likely that EBOV acts as both an
antigen (e.g., following infection of APCs and viral peptide presentation on major
histocompatibility complexes [MHCs]) and a Tim-1 activator through interactions with
virion-associated PS. In this regard, EBOV fulfills the requirement for both the initial
MHC-TCR-dependent activation of T cells and a secondary, costimulating signal

 through virion-associated engagement with Tim-1, which may lead to the hyperacti-
vation observed in recent human cases (63) and contribute to the cytokine storm
following EBOV infection.
As evidenced in these studies, however, the combination of our cytokine/chemokine
analyses, flow cytometry data, transcriptome profile, and the observed rapid internal-
ization of CD3 suggests that EBOV possesses a “superagonist-like”activity, as activation
is observed in the absence of detectable viral infection/replication in CD4� T cells or the
Jurkat cell line, indicating TCR-independent activation. We note that this is consistent
with relative effects of anti-Tim-1 antibodies (59), which showed TCR-independent
activation. These findings have demonstrated that Tim-1 signaling can directly activate
T cells without concomitant TCR-dependent costimulation. Tim-4, a ligand for Tim-1,
has been shown to induce CD4� T-cell expansion and phosphorylation of Akt and
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) while promoting release of both
Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, which is consistent with our findings (64, 65). In addition,
a study by Mariat et al. demonstrated that antibody stimulation of Tim-1 induces CD4�
T-cell proliferation in the absence of MHC class II-dependent signals both in vitro and
in vivo (66). Interestingly, and in support of our findings, the study also indicated that
Tim-1 stimulation also induced NFAT signaling and cytokine production (66). Further-
more, de Souza et al. demonstrated that anti-Tim-1 antibodies induce CD69 and CD25
expression on naive murine CD4� T cells in the absence of TCR stimulus (59). As shown
in our study, siRNA targeting of Tim-1 reduced both CD69 and CD25 (Fig. 5A and B).
Notably, non-TCR-dependent activation of CD4� T cells has been previously reported,
as anti-CD28 antibodies alone are sufficient to induce mass proliferation of T cells (67).
Interestingly, activation with anti-CD28 antibodies primarily induced activation of
central memory CD4� T cells, which, as indicated previously, are the subset to which
EBOV preferentially binds in our in vitro binding assays (Fig. 3C).
As we noted, EBOV stimulation of CD4� T cells appears to be dependent on both
Tim-1 expression and Lck, as Tim-1–siRNA knockdown and pharmaceutical inhibitors
reduced EBOV binding and activation. These results are consistent with the previous
observations demonstrating that Tim-1 signaling events are Lck dependent (59). Within
the TCR complex, Tim-1 is directly associated with CD3 (65); given this physical
interaction, it is logical to assume that cross-linking of Tim-1 would have similar effects
as TCR engagement (66). The rapid internalization of the CD3 complex, as observed by
flow cytometry and trypsin digestion assays, is consistent with TCR-complex down-
regulation following activation. Although previous studies have suggested that EBOV
GP may shield MHC detection (68, 69), we note that these studies were performed in
transduced and transfected DCs where GP is highly expressed; as CD4� T cells are
refractory to infection and a relatively low MOI of 1.0 was used for the majority of these
studies, it is highly improbable that the decrease in CD3 expression is due to shielding
effects.
We suggest that EBOV triggers Tim-1 signaling in a manner similar to anti-Tim-1
antibodies; however, it is likely that numerous PS–Tim-1 interactions between the long,
filamentous EBOV virions and the surface of T cells result in localized cross-linking at the
plasma membrane, which may further promote activation. Furthermore, the additive
effect of culturing T cells in the presence of EBOV and CD3/CD28 beads is consistent
with findings showing that anti-Tim-1 and CD3/CD28 costimulation results in a syner-
gistic increase in activation (36). We note that although antibody stimulation of Tim-1
alone induces activation of T cells, it is feasible and perhaps likely that EBOV binding
may induce secondary signals, which cumulatively result in an increased activation.
Tim-1 is upregulated on both activated Th1 and Th2 cells, although its extended
expression following activation is normally observed in the Th2 cells (1 versus 3 weeks);
importantly, several abovementioned studies, which utilized anti-Tim-1 antibodies to
activate CD4� T cells, demonstrated a basal level of Tim-1 expression by both primary
CD4� T cells and Jurkat cells (47, 59, 62). As observed in this study, activation of primary
CD4� T cells prior to incubation with EBOV resulted in increased binding (Fig. 3D),
which is consistent with the increased surface expression of Tim-1 following T-cell

 activation (45). Furthermore, we show that the majority of EBOV binding was detected
in the central memory subset, which is consistent with the elevated Tim-1 expression
levels on this specific subset as shown in Fig. 6D and as previously observed in murine
memory cells (47). It is important to note that other cell types expressing Tim-1,
including DCs, monocytes, B cells, and epithelial cells (48, 70), may contribute to the
onset of a cytokine storm following PS-dependent activation. Thus, our data indicate a
putative role of PS-dependent signaling in the development of a cytokine storm
through direct interaction with virion-associated PS. Additionally, the high levels of
circulating apoptotic bodies and released cellular components exposing surface PS may
further contribute to the onset of a cytokine storm by further stimulating the PS-
dependent signaling pathways in CD4� T cells and other cell types.
The findings presented here demonstrate for the first time that despite the rapid
loss and limited cytokine secretion by EBOV-infected monocytes and DCs, EBOV directly
binds to and activates CD4� T cells in a TCR-independent manner, leading to the
release of inflammatory mediators. We propose that the combination of nonspecific
activation and increase of inflammatory mediators is among the primary contributing
factors in the development of a cytokine storm. As our recent study demonstrates that
EBOV glycoprotein directly triggers T-cell death (23), some of the cytokines associated
with cell death, such as TNF-�, are likely to contribute to cytokine storm. These findings
are supported in part by a recent report demonstrating that EBOV-infected patients
exhibited relatively high levels of T-lymphocyte activation despite experimental ther-
apies (63). As EBOV-infected DCs and monocytes fail to efficiently activate T cells (13),
we suggest that EBOV directly activates T cells in vivo. Since the extent of the
inflammatory response to EBOV is highly correlative with severity of disease and fatal
outcomes (21, 71, 72), identification of factors contributing to the onset of the cytokine
storm phenomenon may enable the development of novel therapeutics. In this regard,
our data suggest that interfering with EBOV binding and/or activation of Tim-1 signal-
ing appears to be a viable therapeutic strategy. This possibility is further supported by
previous findings that have shown that inhibiting Tim-1 signaling on CD4� T cells can
reduce proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators, which may reduce the
deleterious effects associated with a cytokine storm (32, 37, 54, 55).
The complexity of a cytokine storm response, which is characterized by the pro-
duction of a series of overlapping and often redundant pro- and anti-inflammatory
mediators, has limited the development of therapeutic intervention strategies (24, 37).
Hence, strategies aimed at dampening the global inflammatory response to EBOV by
limiting activation of the cells associated with cytokine production may provide a
course of treatment. In this regard, tipping the scale in favor of maintaining immune
homeostasis may be central to promoting recovery. Conversely, premature termination
of an inflammatory response or therapeutically promoting an anti-inflammatory re-
sponse following EBOV exposure may further contribute to “immune paralysis” and
thereby lead to insufficient viremic control in recovering patients (24). A paradox exists
between the induction of an aggressive immune response against EBOV and develop-
ing therapeutic strategies aimed at stemming the immune response, as survival or
mortality requires an intricately balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory response.
Overall, our data suggest a putative role of PS sensing in the development of a
cytokine storm response during the course of infection; however, based on our
transcriptome analysis, it is feasible that EBOV directly stimulates additional, non-PS-
dependent signaling pathways that lead to the production of cytokines following
binding to T cells. The role of PS signaling in T lymphocytes is not well characterized.
However, PS signaling has been shown to enhance TCR-dependent stimulation, leading
to more robust activation (43). PS signaling is triggered by its ligands of the Tim family,
which are expressed by many cell types (73). Engagement of T-cell-associated Tim-1 is
linked to susceptibility to allergic and asthma responses. Conversely, Tim-3, which is
primarily expressed by the Th1 cells, triggers mainly inhibitory signals that result in their
apoptosis (reviewed in reference 73). Thus, virion-associated PS may trigger immune
activation or tolerance, depending on the cell type and Tim expression profile.

 Our data indicate that the phenotypic changes observed in CD4� T cells stimulated
with EBOV represent a novel, Tim-1-dependent signaling pathway triggered by EBOV
that may contribute to the onset of a cytokine storm and activation-induced T-cell
death (74), which may further contribute to the observed lymphopenia in EVD. Taken
together, our results suggest that EBOV directly binds to and activates CD4� T cells in
a Tim-1-dependent manner. Although EBOV is readily internalized following PS-
dependent binding, no productive viral replication occurs in T cells, suggesting the
presence of a cellular restriction factor or the absence of a factor required for viral
replication. These results also indicate that EBOV possesses “superagonist-like” activity
due to increased proliferation in comparison to engagement following stimulation with
anti-Tim-1 antibodies. It is feasible that EBOV binding to CD4� T cells triggers addi-
tional, non-Tim-1-dependent signaling pathways, which may act as costimulators.
Although disabling of Tim-1 dramatically increased survival (Fig. 1), disease was still
observed, indicating that other pathways important for pathogenesis remain to be
identified. Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of PS signaling
in vivo and its putative role in the onset of a cytokine storm. Overall, these data
contribute to understanding of the “immune paralysis” during EBOV infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
BSL-4 work. All work with EBOV was performed within the Galveston National Laboratory biosafety
level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. For removal of mouse serum and cell-free supernatants of EBOV-infected cells
from BSL-4, they were gamma irradiated using the 5-Mrad dose according to the approved University of
Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) standard operating procedure protocol. Either flow cytometry was per-
formed in BSL-4 using the Canto-II instrument (BD Biosciences), or cells were treated with 4% buffered
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 48 h according to the approved UTMB standard
operating procedure protocol and removed from BSL-4 for analysis with flow cytometers available in the
UTMB Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Cell lysates for Western blot analysis were prepared by lysis of cells
with 4� SDS-Laemmli buffer, followed by incubation at 95°
C for 15 min, vortexing, and removal from
BSL-4 laboratories. Cells for confocal microscopy were placed on slides; stained; fixed in 4% paraformal-
dehyde for 24 h, which was replaced with a fresh solution; incubated for an additional 48 h; and taken
out of BSL-4. Staining and mounting procedures are described below.
Mouse studies. Infection of mice with mouse-adapted EBOV was approved by the University of
Texas Medical Branch at Galveston Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in the
BSL-4 containment facilities of the Galveston National Laboratory. Tim-1�/� mice were kindly provided
by Suzanne Cassel, University of Iowa, and described previously (75). Control C57BL/6J mice were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Eight- to 9-week-old mice were infected by intraperitoneal
injection with 1,000 PFU of mouse-adapted EBOV, strain Mayinga, which in a previous study was found
to be equal to ~30,000 50% lethal doses (45). Mice were monitored twice daily from day 0 to day 14
postchallenge, followed by once-daily monitoring from day 15 to the end of the study at day 28. Clinical
score was assessed as follows: (i) body weight, normal, 0; �10% loss, 1; 10 to 15% loss, 2; �20% loss, 3;
(ii) appearance, normal, 0; lack of grooming, 1; rough coat, possible nasal and or ocular discharge, 2; very
rough coat, abnormal posture, enlarged pupils, 3; (iii) clinical signs, normal, 0; small change of potential
significance, 1; 25% rise in respiratory/heart rates, 2; 30% rise in respiratory/heart rates or markedly
reduced/shallow respiratory/heart rates, paralysis, 3; (iv) unprovoked behavior, normal, 0; minor changes,
1; abnormal behavior, less mobile, less alert, inactive when activity expected, 2; unsolicited vocalization,
extreme self-mutilation, 3; (v) behavior response to external stimuli, normal, 0; minor exaggerated
response, 1; moderate abnormal response, 2. The overall score was tabulated and used to help interpret
our assessment of each animal. A total score of 3 or less was considered normal; 4 to 7 indicated some
evidence of pain or discomfort. Any animal reaching a total score of 8 or a score of 3 in any individual
category was euthanized.
Flow cytometry analysis of mouse lymphocytes. Peripheral blood was collected in tubes contain-
ing EDTA (Kent Scientific Corp.; catalog identifier MTSC-EDTA) at day 6 postchallenge. Erythrocytes were
lysed using lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were pelleted at
400 � g, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), and stained with the following antibodies: CD3-brilliant UV 395 (BUV395) (145-2C11; BD
Biosciences), CD4-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)/Cy5.5 (RM4-5; BD Biosciences), IFN-�–phycoeryth-
rin (PE) (XMG1.2; BD Biosciences), TNF-�–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (MP6-XT22; BD Biosciences),
and IL-2–allophycocyanin (APC) (JES6-5H4; BD Biosciences).
Multiplex analysis of serum cytokines and chemokine. Serum samples were collected on day 6
post-EBOV infection. Samples were gamma irradiated with the 5-Mrad dose according to the UTMB
standard operating procedure protocol, removed from the BSL-4 laboratory, and analyzed using a
Multiplex-32 magnetic bead-based assay (Millipore) by Eve Technologies.
Analysis of viremia. Total RNA was isolated from serum samples taken at day 6 post-EBOV challenge
using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit per the manufacturer’
s protocol (Qiagen). EBOV was quantified with
the one-step reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) advanced kit for probes (Bio-Rad), with
probes specific for the NP gene fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2095 to 2153 of EBOV genomic

C
for 60 min and 95°
C for 10 min, followed by 39 cycles of 95°

which quantifies the number of positive and negative droplets in each sample. Analysis was performed
using QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad) to get the final concentrations in each sample.
Viruses. Recombinant EBOV, strain Mayinga, expressing GFP (76), was recovered from transfection of
endotoxin-free plasmids harboring viral cDNA as previously described (11) and propagated by 3 passages
in Vero-E6 cell monolayers. Viral stocks were quantified by plaque titration in Vero-E6 monolayers as
previously described (77). Mouse-adapted EBOV, strain Mayinga (45), was obtained from the U.S. Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Frederick, MD), deposited at the World Reference
Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (housed at UTMB), and amplified by a single passage in
Vero-E6 cells.
Cell lines. Human embryonic kidney 293T (293T) and Vero-E6 cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) and
minimal essential medium (MEM), respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (HI-FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% HEPES (Corning), 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma-
Aldrich), 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% penicillin-streptomycin mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Jurkat human T-lymphocyte lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% HI-FBS (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and 1% HEPES (Corning).
Isolation and culture of primary T lymphocytes. Unidentified buffy coats, obtained from the blood
of healthy adult donors according to a clinical protocol approved by the University of Texas Medical
Branch at Galveston (UTMB) Institutional Review Board, were provided by the UTMB Blood Bank.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated with a Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich) gradient as
recommended by the manufacturer. Fresh PBMCs were used for isolation of CD4� and CD8� T
lymphocytes by negative selection using magnetic microbead separation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). “No-
target”PBMCs were made devoid of monocytes and dendritic cells using positive selection for CD14 and
CD11c to remove known EBOV target cells. Purity typically ranged from 93% to 95% as determined by
flow cytometry. T-lymphocyte activation was induced with Dynabeads human transactivator CD3/CD28
beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’
s recommendations. In some experi-
ments, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control at a concentration of
1 �g/ml.
Flow cytometry analysis of GP binding. Isolated CD4� T lymphocytes or Jurkat, 293T, or Vero-E6
cells were plated at the concentration of 1 � 106 cells per well in U-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and placed on ice (to prevent internalization of viruses). EBOV was added at the indicated
MOIs. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°
C and washed with PBS containing 2% HI-FBS. Thereafter, cells
were immunostained with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 labeled with brilliant UV 395 (BUV395)
clone UCHT1 (BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 labeled with PerCP-Cy5.5 clone 4 Oktober (BioLegend) or
anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 clone RPA-T8 (BioLegend), and rabbit antibodies raised against EBOV virus-like
particles (VLP) (Integrated BioTherapeutics). For subset binding and depletion assays, the following
antibodies were used in addition to the CD3 and CD4 antibodies previously described: CD38-Alexa.488
clone HIT2 (BioLegend), HLA-DR.APC clone L243 (BioLegend), CD45RO-BVLT.786 clone UCH-L1
(BioLegend), CCR7-PE clone G043H7 (BioLegend), and CXCR3-Alexa.Fluoro.700 clone 1C6/CXCR3 (Bio-
Legend). After staining, cells were washed three times with PBS containing 2% HI-FBS, fixed in 10%
formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), stained with goat anti-rabbit antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 647
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and washed again 3 times in PBS with 2% HI-FBS. Following surface receptor
staining, LIVE/DEAD (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining was performed according to the manufacturer’
s
recommendation, and cells were fixed with 10% formalin. Flow cytometry was performed using a
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Fortessa (BD Biosciences) instrument.
Analysis of markers of activation and cytokine analysis. Following CD4� T-cell isolation, cells
were stimulated with EBOV at the indicated MOI for 48 h and surface stained for CD25-Alexa.Fluoro.700
clone M-A251 (BioLegend) and CD69-PE/Dazzle clone fn50 (BioLegend). Cells were fixed and permeabil-

BVLT.421 clone B56 (BD Biosciences), IL-2–APC clone MQ1-17H12 (BD Biosciences), TNF-�–FITC clone
Mab11 (BD Biosciences), and IFN-�–PE clone B27 (BD Biosciences). Samples were then analyzed using a
FACS Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences). Cytokines and chemokines were detected and quantitated
from supernatants by Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, CA). Heat maps were generated using GENE-E
(Broad Institute; http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html).
Intracellular accumulation of EBOV. Viral binding assays were performed as described under “Flow
cytometry analysis of GP binding” above with the additional step being performed prior to harvesting
cell lysates. Following incubation on ice, cells were either immediately trypsinized or shifted to 37°
C for
1 h to promote internalization of virions prior to trypsin digestion; nontrypsinized samples were used as
a control. Cells were pelleted, washed in PBS, lysed as described under “BSL-4 work”above, and analyzed
by Western blotting with antibodies specific to EBOV NP (IBT Bioservices; catalog no. 301-012), CD3�

 (Santa Cruz Biotech; clone M-20), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Cell Sig-
naling; clone 14C10). To further confirm reduction in TCR levels, EBOV stimulation was followed by
Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for CD3� (Santa Cruz Biotech; clone 6B10.2).
Analysis of NFAT-1 signaling. CD4� T cells or Jurkat T lymphocytes were plated at a concentration
of 1 � 106 cells per well in 96-well plates and mock treated or stimulated for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min with
one of the following: 25 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 0.5 �M ionomycin, 10 �M
cyclosporine (CsA), 1 �g/ml SEB, or EBOV at an MOI of 5. Cells were collected, lysed in Laemmli buffer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated at 95°
C for 15 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using
4 to 12% gradient gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) using the I-blot system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5%
milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at 37°
C and stained with antibodies specific for mono- (activated)
and hyperphosphorylated (nonactivated) NFAT-1 (Novus Biologicals, Inc.; catalog no. NB300-504) and
GAPDH (Cell Signaling; catalog no. 8884S) diluted according to manufacturer’
s recommendations in PBS
with 0.1% Tween 20. Luciferase-based detection of NFAT activity was performed 24 h following
electroporation of Jurkat cells with pGL3.NFAT-luciferase (78) (Addgene; catalog no. 17870) using the
Neon transfection system per the manufacturer’
s recommendation for the Jurkat cell line (Invitrogen).
EBOV was added at an MOI of 3 while PMA-ionomycin was used as a positive control at 1 �g/ml each.
Complete medium was added to control wells. Nontransfected Jurkat cells were used for background
subtraction. Samples were harvested and lysed in 200 �l of passive lysis buffer 6 h following stimulation.
Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega; catalog no. E1500). Data
were normalized to control wells.
Confocal microscopy. Isolated primary CD4� T cells were grown in suspension at 1 � 106 cells/well
in 12-well plates and loaded on positively charged coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 37°
C.
In some experiments, chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to cell cultures at a concentration of 10 �M
prior to the addition of EBOV. Cells were stimulated with EBOV at the indicated MOIs at 37°
C, placed on
ice, washed 3 times with PBS, and fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Alfa Aesar) solution in PBS for 15 min. Then, cells were washed with PBS,
incubated with 0.5 M glycine in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and washed 3 times with PBS.
Antigen blocking was performed using 5% donkey serum diluted with PBS with 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (stain buffer) for 1 h. Mouse monoclonal CD3�, Rab7, and rabbit
immune serum against EBOV VLP (Integrated BioTherapeutics) were diluted at 1:100 in stain buffer. After
a 1-h incubation at room temperature, slides were washed 3 times in stain buffer, incubated with the
mixture of two secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 [Thermo
Fisher Scientific] and donkey anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 [Thermo Fisher Scientific])
diluted at 1:200 in stain buffer for 1 h, and washed as described above. Next, cells were incubated with
6-diamine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1 �g/ml for 2 min and
washed 3 times in PBS. Slides were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and removed from BSL-4 as
described above. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using PermaFluor mounting medium
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy using an Olympus FV1000
confocal microscope. Laser beams with 405-nm wavelengths were used for DAPI excitation, 488 nm was
used for Alexa Fluor 488, and 635 nm was used for Alexa Fluor 647. Emission filters were 425/25 nm for
DAPI, 515/30 nm for Alexa Fluor 488, and 610/50 nm for Alexa Fluor 647 detection. All images were
acquired using a 60� oil objective.
Phosphatidylserine-dependent binding assays. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine were
obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster) and used to generate liposomes as previously described
(79). CD4� T cells were preincubated with liposomes at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to the
addition of EBOV. Annexin V (EBioscience) was added to EBOV for 1 h prior to the addition to isolated
CD4� T cells. Flow cytometry analysis of EBOV GP was performed as described above.
Gene knockdown experiments were performed using pooled control or Tim-1-specific siRNA (Santa
Cruz Biotech). Jurkat cells were electroporated using the Neon transfection system as recommended by
the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Tim-1 levels were assessed by flow cytometry using anti-Tim-1–PE (R&D
Systems; clone 219211). Assays were performed 48 h following electroporation using previously de-
scribed culture conditions. The Lck inhibitor, Ly294, and PI3K inhibitor, PP2, were used at final concen-
trations of 10 �M (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates for Western blot analysis were collected 2 h following EBOV
or CD3/28 stimulation. Monoclonal rabbit antibodies for detecting Akt (clone C67E7), phospho-Akt (D9E),
PI3K (19H8), and polyclonal phospho-PI3K were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies.
Transcriptome deep sequencing. Isolated CD4� T cells from four donors were cultured in RPMI
1640 medium in the presence or absence of EBOV at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. At 24 and 96 h poststimu-
lation, cells were washed with PBS 3 times, lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and stored
at �80°
C. Samples were processed for RNA isolation using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo
Research) according to the manufacturer’
s recommendations. RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer using the nanochip format, and only intact RNA was used for constructing the mRNA
libraries. Libraries were constructed using the Kapa Stranded mRNA-Seq kit (Kapa Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer’
s instructions. Libraries were quality controlled and quantitated using the BioAnalyzer 2100
system and Qubit (Invitrogen). The libraries were clonally amplified and sequenced on an Illumina
NextSeq 500 sequencer to achieve a target density of approximately 200,000 to 220,000 clusters/mm2 on
the flow cell with dual-index paired-end sequencing at a 75-bp length using NextSeq 500 NCS v1.3
software. Raw reads (75 bp) had their adapter sequences removed.
Read processing. General quality control of the raw reads was performed using FastQC (http://www
.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). rRNA reads were removed via mapping by Bowtie
Younan et al.

 (v2.1.0) using an index of human, mouse, and rat rRNA sequences. On average, ~10% of the reads from
each sample were identified as mapping to rRNA and were removed from downstream analysis. Reads
were then mapped against a human reference genome (hg19, build GRCh37, from the UCSC genome
browser [http://genome.ucsc.edu/]) using STAR (version 2.4.0h1). Quantitative gene counts were pro-
duced from this alignment using HTSeq (http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/) utilizing the
human annotation associated with the genome.
Differential expression analysis. Gene counts for 25,237 genes for each sample were loaded into
the R statistical environment (http://www.r-project.org). Genes with no counts were removed, and counts
across samples were normalized with edgeR (version 3.10.2) using the weighted trimmed mean of M
values. Remaining genes without at least three samples with counts were removed, leaving 14,932 genes
with an average of ~106 reads per sample. Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR
between treatments and time points and defined by using an absolute fold change cutoff of 1.5 and a
P value of �0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Additional
clustering, creation of heat maps, and other statistical analyses were performed using R. In the
comparison between EBOV-treated samples and mock samples at day 1, 2,591 (1,581 upregulated, 1,010
downregulated) differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified. Between EBOV-treated and mock
samples at day 4, 1,534 (789 upregulated, 745 downregulated) DE genes were identified.
Functional enrichment analysis. Functional analysis of the differential gene expression data was
performed with Qiagen’
s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Functional
annotation of genes for specific biological functions was assigned through querying AmiGO (version
2.20). Canonical pathway names were collected by searching for human genes with search queries as
described in the text.
Network analysis. Functional analysis from IPA provided foundations for generating networks based
on differentially expressed genes. DE genes with the most interactions with other DE genes were
connected together to form networks with molecules from both the experimental expression data and
IPA Knowledge databases. Each network was scored with a P value indicating its likelihood that these
genes in the network could be found by random chance. IPA network scores of 2 or higher have at least
a 99% confidence interval of not being generated by chance alone. The interactions within the network
are based on IPA’
s Knowledge Base and consist of direct and indirect relationships assigned based on
primary literature sources. A top-scoring network (score of 41) with functions related to inflammation
was used as the basis for the network depicting the cytokine storm response in Fig. 4F. A network (score
of 33) with functions for cell cycle regulation was used in conjunction with its relationship with
phosphatidylserine to form the phosphatidylserine regulation network in Fig. 5A. A network for cell
signaling and interaction (score of 29) was used as a basis for a superantigen response (Fig. S3).
Additionally, significant canonical pathways identified from IPA were assigned a Z score, which deter-
mines if gene expression changes from the expression data are consistent with the IPA Knowledge Base.
Functions with a Z score of �2, indicating a strong predicted activation of that function, were chosen to
form networks. Genes and interactions were additionally added or removed from these networks to
highlight genes with the largest changes in expression and for clarity. Genes contributing to the
construction of the cytokine storm networks were created from stricter absolute log 2-fold change
cutoffs of �2� to focus on the interactions between the most highly activated genes.
Statistical analyses. Each independent experiment (donor) was performed in triplicate to rule out
experimental bias or random error. Data were analyzed using statistical methods described in the figure
legends using GraphPad Prism 6. P values of �0.05 were considered statistically significant. Mean and
standard error (SE) of the mean were calculated for all graphs.
